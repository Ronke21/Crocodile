<text>Cirencester ( , ; see below for more variations) is a market town and civil parish in the Cotswold District of Gloucestershire, England. Cirencester lies on the River Churn, a tributary of the River Thames. It is the eighth largest settlement in Gloucestershire and the largest town within the Cotswolds. It is the home of the Royal Agricultural University, the oldest agricultural college in the English-speaking world, founded in 1840. The town had a population of 20,229 in 2021. The town is northwest of Swindon, southeast of Gloucester, west of Oxford and northeast of Bristol.

The Roman name for the town was Corinium, which is thought to have been associated with the ancient British tribe of the &quot;Dobunni&quot;, having the same root word as the River Churn. The earliest known reference to the town was by Ptolemy in AD 150. The town&#x27;s Corinium Museum has an extensive Roman collection.

Cirencester is twinned with the town of Itzehoe, in the Steinburg region of Germany.

==Local geography==
Cirencester lies on the lower dip slopes of the Cotswold Hills, an outcrop of oolitic limestone. Natural drainage is into the River Churn, which flows roughly north to south through the eastern side of the town and joins the River Thames near Cricklade, a little to the south. The Thames itself rises just a few miles west of Cirencester.

The town is split into five main areas: the town centre, the village of Stratton, the suburb of Chesterton (originally a village outside the town), Watermoor and The Beeches. The village of Siddington to the south of the town is now almost contiguous with Watermoor. Other suburbs include Bowling Green and New Mills. The area and population of these five electoral wards are identical to that quoted above. The town serves as a centre for surrounding villages, providing employment, amenities, shops, commerce and education; it is a commuter town for larger centres such as Cheltenham, Gloucester, Swindon and Stroud.

==Etymology==
Cirencester&#x27;s name is first attested by Ptolemy around 150 CE, though the earliest surviving manuscripts are from the thirteenth century. These give various slightly different spellings, of which the original seems to have been (). The etymology of this name is, however, unknown. The same name is found in River Churn, which passes through the town (and which, with the addition of the Old English word (&#x27;river&#x27;) in turn gave its name to North Cerney, South Cerney, and Cerney Wick).

As the Celtic languages changed, this name became Proto-Welsh &quot;Cerin&quot;. This proto-Welsh name was adopted into English in the course of Celtic language-death in England with the addition of the Old English word (&#x27;Roman fortification&#x27;), and is first attested in this form as &quot;Cirenceaster&quot; in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; (a text which took its present form in the later ninth century). The name also persisted in Welsh, also first being attested in the ninth century, in writings of Asser, in the form &quot;Cair Ceri&quot;.

==History==

===Roman Corinium===

Cirencester is known to have been an important early Roman area, along with St Albans and Colchester, and the town includes evidence of significant area roadworks. The Romans built a &quot;castra&quot; (fort) where the Fosse Way crossed the Churn, to hold two quingenary (i.e. 500 men) alae tasked with helping to defend the provincial frontier around AD 49, and native Dobunni were drawn from Bagendon, a settlement to the north, to create a civil settlement near the fort. When the frontier moved to the north after the conquest of Wales, this fort was closed and its fortifications levelled around the year 70, but the town persisted and flourished under the name Corinium.

Even in Roman times, there was a thriving wool trade and industry, which contributed to the growth of Corinium. A large forum and basilica were built over the site of the fort, and archaeological evidence shows signs of further civic growth. There are many Roman remains in the surrounding area, including several Roman villas near the villages of Chedworth and Withington. When a defensive wall was built around the Roman city in the late 2nd century, it enclosed making Corinium the second-largest city by area in Roman Britain. The details of the provinces of Britain following the Diocletian Reforms around 296 remain unclear, but Corinium is now generally thought to have been the capital of Britannia Prima. Some historians would date to this period the pillar erected by the governor Lucius Septimus to the god Jupiter, a local sign of the pagan reaction against Christianity during the principate of Julian the Apostate.

===Post-Roman and Saxon===

The Roman amphitheatre still exists in an area known as the Querns to the south-west of the town, but has only been partially excavated. Investigations in the town show that it was fortified in the 5th or 6th centuries. Andrew Breeze argued that Gildas received his later education in Cirencester in the early 6th century, showing that it was still able to provide an education in Latin rhetoric and law at that time. Possibly this was the palace of one of the British kings defeated by Ceawlin in 577. It was later the scene of the Battle of Cirencester, this time between the Mercian king Penda and the West Saxon kings Cynegils and Cwichelm in 628.

The minster church of Cirencester, founded in the 9th or 10th century, was probably a royal foundation. It was made over to Augustinian canons in the 12th century and replaced by the great abbey church.

===Norman===
At the Norman Conquest the royal manor of Cirencester was granted to the Earl of Hereford, William Fitz-Osbern, but by 1075 it had reverted to the Crown. The manor was granted to Cirencester Abbey, founded by Henry I in 1117, and following half a century of building work during which the minster church was demolished, the abbey church was finally dedicated in 1176. The manor was granted to the Abbey in 1189, although a royal charter dated 1133 speaks of burgesses in the town. The abbots obtained charters in 1215 and 1253 for fairs during the octaves of All Saints and St Thomas the Martyr, and the significant wool trade gave these great importance.

The struggle of the townsmen to gain the rights and privileges of a borough for Cirencester probably began with the grant of 1189, when they were amerced for a false presentment, meaning that they had presented false information. Four inquisitions during the 13th century supported the abbot&#x27;s claims, yet the townspeople remained unwavering in their quest for borough status: in 1342, they lodged a Bill of complaint in Chancery. Twenty townspeople were ordered to Westminster, where they declared under oath that successive abbots had bought up many burgage tenements, and made the borough into an appendage of the manor, depriving it of its separate court. They claimed that the royal charter that conferred on the men of Cirencester the liberties of Winchester had been destroyed 50 years earlier, when the abbot had bribed the burgess who held the charter to give it to him, whereupon the abbot had had it burned. In reply, the abbot refuted these claims, and the case passed on to the King&#x27;s Bench. When ordered to produce the foundation charter of his abbey the abbot refused, apparently because that document would be fatal to his case, and instead played a winning card. In return for a fine of £300, he obtained a new royal charter confirming his privileges and a writ of &quot;supersedeas&quot;.

The townspeople continued in their fight: in return for their aid to the Crown against the earls of Kent and Salisbury, Henry IV in 1403 gave the townsmen a Merchant&#x27;s Guild, although two inquisitions reiterated the abbot&#x27;s rights. The struggle between the abbot and the townspeople continued, with the abbot&#x27;s privileges confirmed in 1408–1409 and 1413, and in 1418 the abbot finally removed this thorn in his side when the guild merchant was annulled. In 1477 parliament declared that Cirencester was not corporate. After several unsuccessful attempts to re-establish the guild merchant, in 1592 the government of the town was vested in the bailiff of the Lord of the manor.

===Tudor===
As part of the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539, Henry VIII ordered the total demolition of the Abbey buildings. Today only the Norman Arch and parts of the precinct wall remain above ground, forming the perimeter of a public park in the middle of town. Despite this, the freedom of a borough continued to elude the townspeople, and they only saw the old lord of the manor replaced by a new lord of the manor as the king acquired the abbey&#x27;s title. Cirencester became a parliamentary borough in 1572, returning two members, although this was deprived of representation in 1885.

Sheep rearing, wool sales, weaving and woollen broadcloth and cloth-making were the main strengths of England&#x27;s trade in the Middle Ages, and not only the abbey but many of Cirencester&#x27;s merchants and clothiers gained wealth and prosperity from the national and international trade. The tombs of these merchants can be seen in the parish church, while their fine houses of Cotswold stone still stand in and around Coxwell Street and Dollar Street. Their wealth funded the rebuilding of the nave of the parish church in 1515–1530, to create the large building sometimes referred to as the &quot;Cathedral of the Cotswolds&quot;. Other wool churches can be seen in neighbouring Northleach and Chipping Campden.

===Civil War===
The Civil War came to Cirencester in February 1643 when Royalists and Parliamentarians came to blows in the streets. Over 300 were killed, and 1,200 prisoners were held captive in the church. The townsfolk supported the Parliamentarians but gentry and clergy were for the old order, so that when Charles I of England was executed in 1649 the minister, Alexander Gregory, wrote on behalf of the gentry in the parish register, &quot;O England what did&#x27;st thou do, the 30th of this month&quot;.

At the end of the war, King Charles II spent the night of 11 September 1651 in Cirencester, during his escape after the Battle of Worcester on his way to France.

===Modern history===
At the end of the 18th century, Cirencester was a thriving market town, at the centre of a network of turnpike roads with easy access to markets for its produce of grain and wool. From 1461, Cirencester Grammar School provided a grammar school education for those who could afford it, and businesses thrived in the town, which was the market town for the surrounding area.

In 1789, the opening of the Cirencester branch (or &quot;arm&quot;) of the Thames and Severn Canal provided access to markets further afield, by way of a link through the River Thames. In 1841, a branch railway line was opened to Kemble to provide a link to the Great Western Railway at Swindon. The Midland and South Western Junction Railway opened a station at Watermoor in 1883. Cirencester thus was served by two railway lines until the 1960s.

The loss of the canal and the direct rail link encouraged dependency on road transport. An inner ring road system was completed in 1975 in an attempt to reduce congestion in the town centre, which has since been augmented by an outer bypass with the expansion of the A417 road. Coaches depart from London Road for Victoria Bus Station in central London and Heathrow Airport, taking advantage of the M4 Motorway. Kemble Station to the west of the town, distinguished by a sheltered garden, is served by fast trains from Paddington station via Swindon.

The passing of the Local Government Act 1894 at last brought into existence the town&#x27;s first independent elected body, the Cirencester Urban District Council. A reorganisation of local government in 1974 replaced the Urban District Council with the present two-tiers of Cotswold District Council and Cirencester Town Council, sitting below Gloucestershire County Council.

Under the patronage of the Bathurst family, the Cirencester area, notably Sapperton, became a major centre for the Arts and Crafts movement in the Cotswolds, when the furniture designer and architect-craftsman Ernest Gimson opened workshops in the early 20th century, and Norman Jewson, his foremost student, practised in the town.

=== Archaeology ===
A 3,500-year-old Bronze Age spear was found in 2022 during landscaping at a Thames Water sewage works. Archaeologists also uncovered prehistoric pottery fragments, flint tools, and animal bones from the Bronze Age, Iron Age, and Roman period.

==Name==
The name stem &quot;Corin&quot; is cognate with &quot;Churn&quot; (the modern name of the river on which the town is built) and with the stem &quot;Cerne&quot; in the nearby villages of North Cerney, South Cerney, and Cerney Wick; also on the River Churn. The modern name &quot;Cirencester&quot; is derived from the cognate root &quot;Ciren&quot; and the standard &quot;-cester&quot; ending indicating a Roman fortress or encampment. It seems certain that this name root goes back to pre-Roman times and is similar to the original Brythonic name for the river, and perhaps the settlement. An early Welsh language ecclesiastical list from St David&#x27;s gives another form of the name &quot;Caerceri&quot; where &quot;Caer&quot; is the Welsh for fortress and &quot;Ceri&quot; is cognate with the other forms of the name.

===Pronunciation===

In ninth-century Old Welsh the city was known as &quot;Cair Ceri&quot; (literally &quot;Fort Ceri&quot;), translated &quot;Cirrenceaster&quot;, &quot;Cirneceaster&quot;, or &quot;Cyrneceaster&quot; (dative &quot;Cirrenceastre&quot;, &quot;Cirneceastre&quot;, &quot;Cyrneceastre&quot;) in the Old English of the Anglo-Saxons, where &quot;ceaster&quot; means &quot;fort&quot; or &quot;fortress&quot;. The Old English &quot;c&quot; was pronounced . The Normans mispronounced the sound as , resulting in the modern name &quot;Cirencester&quot; (). The form , spelled &quot;Cirencester&quot; or &quot;Ciceter&quot;, was once used locally. This pronunciation is humorously highlighted in a 1928 limerick from &quot;Punch&quot;:

Sometimes the form &quot;Cicester&quot; () was heard instead. These forms are now very rarely used, while many local people abbreviate the name to &quot;Ciren&quot; ().

Today it is usually (as it is spelt) or , although occasionally it is , or .

==Sites of interest==

The Grade I listed Church of St. John the Baptist is renowned for its Perpendicular Gothic porch, fan vaults and merchants&#x27; tombs.

The town also has a Roman Catholic church dedicated to St Peter; the foundation stone was laid on 20 June 1895. Coxwell Street to the north of Market Square was the original home of the Baptist Church that was founded in 1651, making it one of the oldest Baptist churches in England; the church moved in January 2017 to a new building on Chesterton Lane. The town&#x27;s Salvation Army hall in Thomas Street occupies the former Temperance Hall built by the Quaker Christopher Bowly in 1846, and is the oldest such hall in the West of England. The Salvation Army first met in Cirencester in 1881.

To the west of the town is Cirencester Park, the seat of Earl Bathurst and the site of one of the finest landscape gardens in England, laid out by Allen Bathurst, 1st Earl Bathurst after 1714. He inherited the estate from his father, Sir Benjamin Bathurst, a Tory Member of Parliament and statesman who made his wealth from his involvement in the slave trade through the Royal Africa Company and the East India Company.

Abbey House was a country house built on the site of the former Cirencester Abbey following its dissolution and demolition at the Reformation in the 1530s. The site was granted in 1564 to Richard Master, physician to Elizabeth I. The house was rebuilt and altered at several dates by the Master family, who still own the agricultural estate. By 1897 the house was let, and it remained in the occupation of tenants until shortly after the Second World War. It was demolished in 1964.

On Cotswold Avenue is the site of a Roman amphitheatre which, while buried, retains its shape in the earthen topography of the small park setting. Cirencester was one of the most substantial cities of Roman-era Britain.

The Corn Hall was designed by Medland, Maberly and Medland and completed in 1863.

==Local politics==
Before 1974 the town was administered by Cirencester Urban District Council, which was initially based in the upper floors of the south porch of the Church of St. John the Baptist. The council moved to offices in Castle Street in 1897 and to offices in Gosditch Street in 1932. In the 1974 reorganisation of local government, the urban district council was replaced by the new Cotswold District Council and Cirencester Town Council was created as the first tier of local government.

The Liberal Democrats won all of the eight available Cirencester seats on Cotswold District Council in May 2013.

Liberal Democrat candidate Joe Harris, aged 18, was elected to the district council for Cirencester Park Ward in May 2011, and became the youngest councillor in the country. Harris was also elected to the county council in the 2013 elections, winning the Cirencester Park Division.

===Railway===

Since Cirencester Watermoor station was closed in 1961 and the Kemble to Cirencester branch line to Cirencester Town station was closed to passengers in 1964, the town has been without its own station. The nearest station is now at Kemble, away. It is served by regular Great Western Railway trains between London Paddington and .

There is an active campaign to restore the line from Kemble to Cirencester.

The town and the surrounding area have several primary schools and two secondary schools, Cirencester Deer Park School on Stroud Road and Cirencester Kingshill School on Kingshill Lane. It also has an independent school, Rendcomb College, catering for 3 to 18-year-olds. The town used to have a 500-year-old grammar school, which in 1966 joined with the secondary modern to form Cirencester Deer Park School. In 1991, Cirencester College was created, taking over the joint sixth form of Cirencester Deer Park and Cirencester Kingshill schools and the Cirencester site of Stroud College; it is adjacent to Deer Park School on Stroud Road.

Until 1994, the town had a private preparatory school, Oakley Hall. Run in its later years by the Letts family, it closed in 1994 shortly after the retirement of R. F. B. Letts who had led the school since 1962. The grounds of the school are now occupied by housing.

The Royal Agricultural University campus is between the Stroud and Tetbury Roads.

<text>City of Angels is a 1998 American romantic fantasy film directed by Brad Silberling, and starring Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan. Set in Los Angeles, California, the film is a loose remake of Wim Wenders&#x27;s 1987 film &quot;Wings of Desire&quot; (&quot;Der Himmel über Berlin&quot;). As with the original, &quot;City of Angels&quot; tells the story of an angel (Cage) who falls in love with a mortal woman (Ryan), and wishes to become human to be with her. With the guidance of a man (Dennis Franz) who has already made the transition from immortality, the angel falls and begins the human experience.

When producer Dawn Steel saw potential to pursue more story ideas in Wenders&#x27;s original concept, she and her husband Charles Roven acquired the rights for an English-language adaptation. After years of delay, they found support from Warner Bros. and recruited Silberling and screenwriter Dana Stevens to execute the project. Themes were borrowed from Wenders&#x27;s work, though the ending was altered, to a more tragic effect. &quot;City of Angels&quot; was filmed around California and dedicated to Steel, who died before the premiere.

The remake was released to financial success, but mixed reviews, with some critics judging it to be a mawkish adaptation. It was also noted for its soundtrack, and nominated for several awards, particularly for its performances and soundtrack.

==Plot==
In Los Angeles, California, Seth is one of many angels who watch over humans, protecting them in unseen ways. His main responsibility is to appear to those who are close to death and guide them to the next life.

During this task, Seth and one of his fellow angels, Cassiel, ask people what their favorite thing in life was. Despite these daily encounters, they have trouble understanding human beings and their ways, as angels lack human senses.

While waiting to escort a man undergoing heart surgery to the other world, Seth is impressed by the vigorous efforts of the surgeon, Maggie Rice, to save the ill-fated man&#x27;s life and her sincere anguish at her failure to do so. Seth soon becomes focused on Maggie and becomes visible to her. They develop a connection, which soon turns to mutual attraction, although she is already involved with one of her colleagues, Jordan Ferris.

Seth then meets Nathaniel Messinger, one of Maggie&#x27;s patients, who senses Seth&#x27;s presence. He tells him that he, too, had once been an angel. But, as free will is granted equally to mortals and angels, Nathaniel decided to become human by &quot;falling&quot;. Seth begins to consider being with Maggie, and she learns that he is an angel.
Seth becomes human by jumping from the top of a skyscraper. Immediately upon awakening, he starts to experience many human feelings and sensations that he had never been able to understand, beginning with physical pain. As a human, Seth heads to the hospital to see Maggie but is told she has gone to her uncle&#x27;s mountain cabin at Lake Tahoe.

Penniless and naïve, he cannot pay for the journey and gets mugged. He eventually hitches a ride to Lake Tahoe and appears, soaked and cold, at Maggie&#x27;s doorstep. She realizes he has become mortal for her love, and they have sex. The next morning, as Seth is showering, Maggie rides her bicycle to a local store. On her way back, happy and fulfilled, she rides her bicycle with her eyes closed and her arms wide open. Her happiness is cut short when she fails to notice a logging truck crossing her path and is gravely wounded in the collision.

Seth senses that Maggie is in trouble and runs to her aid. He arrives in time for her to tell him she sees the angel who has come to accompany her. Although Seth can no longer see angels, he senses one nearby and frantically begs Maggie not to look at them. She tells him she is not afraid anymore and that when they ask her what her favorite thing in life was, she will say it was Seth, and she then dies.

Grieving and alone, Seth is visited by Cassiel. He asks if he is being punished for becoming human, which Cassiel assures him is not the case. Sometime later, Seth expresses his joy in being human and the fact that he has accepted his new life by running into the ocean, feeling the waves at dawn, in sight of the angels.

==Themes==

&quot;City of Angels&quot; invokes the idea of the fallen angel in Seth&#x27;s transformation into a human. However, author Scott Culpepper argues this is not related to evil or exile from heaven, and is instead based on free will. The fact that Maggie is killed very shortly after Seth&#x27;s transformation poses the question of whether Seth left &quot;heaven for ashes&quot;, but the conclusion is that &quot;the very temporality of relationships, experiences and feelings are what make them meaningful&quot;. Seth&#x27;s realization is followed by the concluding scene in which he dives into the ocean, and the otherwise &quot;stoic&quot; Cassiel smiles for him. Sociologists Albert Bergesen and Andrew Greeley write that this communicates &quot;not only the glory of being alive ... but the seeming approval by heaven of that choice&quot;.

Writer Brian Godawa interprets the film as having a &quot;humanistic worldview&quot; in which physical experiences humans can enjoy have more value to angels than the spiritual. However, Godawa feels this contradicts 1 Peter 1:12, where &quot;things which angels desire to look into&quot; are spiritual truths in the gospel of the Holy Spirit. Encyclopedist Andrew Tate writes Maggie is a surgeon with no spiritual faith and, through Seth, she &quot;learns to trust the invisible&quot;, while Seth learns the wonders of life through her.
Professor Christopher R. Miller observes Seth&#x27;s book recommendation for Maggie is Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;A Moveable Feast&quot;, but Miller suggests John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; would have been more interesting. Miller contrasted Milton&#x27;s epic, in which &quot;angels were matter and spirit&quot; and &quot;sybaritic show-offs&quot;, with the depiction of the supernatural beings in the film.

Tate believes the fact that angels reside in libraries indicates that they represent &quot;an age of reason, order and learning&quot;, though these principles led to decline in faith, contemplating Nathaniel&#x27;s line &quot;They don&#x27;t believe in us anymore&quot;. Miller questions the &quot;no one believes&quot; line, pointing to 1998 New Age book sales, the play &quot;Angels in America&quot; and the television series &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;.

On the choice of Los Angeles as a setting, Gabriel Solomons contrasts the depiction of the city as a door to heaven to other films depicting it as a &quot;psychological dead end&quot; or actual hell (as in &quot;Constantine&quot;). However, Professor Jeff Malpas says that, whereas &quot;Wings of Desire&quot; was informed by Berlin, Los Angeles, sometimes known in real life as the &quot;City of Angels&quot;, &quot;provides nothing more than a convenient location&quot;.

==Production==
===Development===
Director Brad Silberling praised Wim Wenders&#x27; 1987 Franco-German film &quot;Wings of Desire&quot;, calling it &quot;truly the most incredible cinematic experience of observation of human detail&quot;. Silberling, while acknowledging Wenders&#x27; film was meant as a tribute to West Berlin, remarked that it became &quot;a larger human discussion&quot;. In 1989, at the initiative of producer Dawn Steel, her company reached out to Wenders to purchase the rights for an adaptation. However, production was delayed, as Steel took the project to The Walt Disney Company and Turner Entertainment before finally settling at Warner Bros. Silberling secured the position of director after his success with the 1995 film adaptation of &quot;Casper&quot;.

While Steel&#x27;s husband Charles Roven said she &quot;felt that there was another movie in the idea for &quot;Wings of Desire&quot;&quot;, screenplay drafts by various authors dissatisfied her. She subsequently selected Dana Stevens as screenwriter. Stevens professed admiration for Wenders&#x27; original and believed she could &quot;capture its essence&quot;, while reconsidering its nonlinear narrative. She also defended the California setting, saying &quot;Los Angeles is metaphorically more representative of America than any other city ... It has every personality, and I like the idea of angels being among all these different ethnic cultures&quot;.
Star Nicolas Cage said that moving the setting from Berlin in the time of the Wall to Los Angeles demanded story changes, with heavier focus on romance. Silberling and Cage noted the project followed other angel-themed films, such as &quot;Michael&quot; and &quot;The Preacher&#x27;s Wife&quot;, both released in 1996. They were unimpressed with these earlier films, and drew angel wings in the &quot;City of Angels&quot; screenplay to identify parts they felt needed improvement.

Though Silberling did not use the black-and-white the angels see in the original &quot;Wings of Desire&quot; and &quot;Faraway, So Close!&quot;, the remake does borrow the idea of angels inhabiting libraries. Wenders and his crew also developed the costume design of overcoats for angels, with Wenders telling Silberling they experimented with costumes during production before deciding on this look. The ending of the story was altered, so Maggie is killed, a less happy conclusion than the original. Silberling equated this to a scene in &quot;Wings of Desire&quot; where the angel protagonist goes to the side of a motorcyclist near death.

Silberling claimed there was minimal supervision from Warner Bros. throughout writing and filming, due to priority given to the &quot;Batman&quot; film franchise. &quot;City of Angels&quot; was the last film produced by Steel and Roven before her death, and it is dedicated to her.

===Casting===
Originally, Silberling envisioned employing novice actors in the lead roles, but acknowledged performers with the level of recognition of Cage and Meg Ryan would attract support for the production. After having completed action-oriented roles in &quot;The Rock,&quot; &quot;Con Air&quot; and &quot;Face/Off&quot;, Cage was eager to star in a more profound film when he received Stevens&#x27; screenplay. He agreed to accept the role, noting the spiritual issues in the story and the impact it had on him, but not elaborating on his own beliefs. Ryan also agreed to accept the role of Maggie, remarking &quot;I don&#x27;t know if angels are floating around, but the idea that there&#x27;s a guiding force is something I embrace&quot;.

Andre Braugher, an actor on the television series &quot;&quot;, was able to work on the project while &quot;Homicide&quot; was on break before the beginning of its . His new co-star Dennis Franz was also starring on a police procedural series, &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;.

===Filming===

Cage said that with this role, he had to switch from his regular methods of constant movements to trying to be &quot;effective&quot; while often still. He remarked on having to adopt the mindset of a child, and act impressed by commonplace experiences such as feeling rain or sunlight. A rig for the camera was built for the scene where the angelic Seth sees Maggie look in the mirror, and the crew shot the mirror without the actors for one take so Cage&#x27;s reflection could be edited out from the take with both.

Other special effects involved a &quot;going to the light&quot; afterlife depiction, in which Seth walks with a little girl, played by Sarah Dampf, who has died. After cinematographer John Seale shot the scene in a hallway, Sony Pictures Imageworks&#x27; John Nelson increased the brightness to end in white, adding splinters of light.

Some of the film was shot at Lake Tahoe&#x27;s surrounding areas and Kern County. The &quot;falling&quot; scene was partially shot at the Los Angeles Bank of America, while Cage was placed on a moving rig over a bluescreen. Ryan&#x27;s death scene was filmed on Old Mill Road in Crestline, California. The library scenes were shot at San Francisco Public Library. For angel scenes shot at Malibu Beach, though the characters are not physical beings, it was decided that the angels would have briefly visible footprints to avoid the perception that the sand was too hard to leave imprints. Thus, Nelson erased the footprints soon after they are first seen.
===Music===

The score was composed by Gabriel Yared, often using three notes to convey ascent. Pop synthesizers, pianos and strings were used for the three-note compositions where the angels observe Los Angeles, where the child in the prologue dies and where Seth experiences Maggie&#x27;s despair, respectively. Yared also employed violins and celli, sometimes using one to accompany a line of voice-over dialogue and another for follow-up dialogue. Choirs and distant voices reminiscent of Jürgen Knieper&#x27;s &quot;Wings of Desire&quot; score can be heard.

The soundtrack debuted at number 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart on the issue dated April 18, 1998. Its two singles, the Goo Goo Dolls&#x27; &quot;Iris&quot; and Alanis Morissette&#x27;s &quot;Uninvited&quot;, were released to U.S. radio in March and were still receiving substantial radio airplay by August.

While composing &quot;Iris&quot; for the film, songwriter John Rzeznik described feeling inspired to write the lyrics from the point of view of a character, rather than in his own voice. Music author John Braheny wrote that Rzeznik&#x27;s composition in &quot;Iris&quot; follows a form where a melody, represented by A, is given AAA repetition, with an added repeating chorus lyric.

==Release==
In test screenings, Silberling said the film had favorable reactions, though with some confused viewers. &quot;City of Angels&quot; had its debut at Los Angeles&#x27; Mann Theatres on April 8, 1998. The screening was held to benefit the Dawn Steel Putting Girls in the Picture Fund, in honor of Steel, who died in December 1997. Silberling, Roven and the stars were in attendance. The film&#x27;s wider release in the United States took place during the weekend, distributed by Warner Bros.

Warner Home Video published a special edition DVD in December 1998. In 2014, Warner Home Video released a Blu-ray in Region A, with audio commentary from Silberling, Roven and Stevens.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film opened first in the box office, making $16.1 million in its opening weekend. It displaced &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, which was first in the box office for one week, after overtaking &quot;Titanic&quot;, first for 15 weeks. &quot;Titanic&quot; ranked third behind &quot;City of Angels&quot; and &quot;Lost in Space&quot;. &quot;City of Angels&quot; reached the $100 million mark by October 26, 1998.

It finished its run after grossing $78,685,114 in North America and $120 million in other territories, for a total of nearly $200 million. Writer Craig Detweiler concluded the remake drew more viewers than the original.

===Aggregated critical reception===
Meg Ryan received positive reviews for her performance.
The film has a 58% score on Rotten Tomatoes based on 60 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;City of Angels&quot; may not tug the heartstrings as effortlessly as it aims to, but the end results will still leave more than a few viewers in tears.&quot; The film has a rating a 54 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 22 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

===Professional critical reception===

Roger Ebert gave &quot;City of Angels&quot; three stars, saying Meg Ryan was at her best here, but the film was &quot;more of a formula story&quot; than the original &quot;Wings of Desire&quot;, and that many of its qualities were lifted from there. In &quot;Variety&quot;, Emanuel Levy positively reviewed Cage as &quot;endlessly resourceful&quot; and Ryan as &quot;terrifically engaging&quot;. In &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;, Jennifer Wolcott compared it to &quot;Ghost&quot; (1990) and &quot;Contact&quot; (1997) as a U.S. film that could explore religion and love, highlighting Maggie&#x27;s realization that her life will continue after the death of her blood cells, and that love is more than &quot;a chemical reaction&quot;. &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot; reviewer Roger Hurlburt praised the acting, direction and &quot;profound&quot; feelings, and advised readers, &quot;don&#x27;t forget the Kleenex&quot;. Wenders was satisfied with the adaptation of his work, remarking, &quot;It&#x27;s done with respect, with a sense of discovery all its own&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; Stephen Holden wrote the standard romantic clichés were &quot;sumptuously&quot; displayed, Cage resembled a serial killer more than an angel, and he preferred Ryan. David Denby wrote in &quot;New York&quot; that unlike Berlin, Los Angeles offers &quot;the sunlit paradise&quot; where people do not need convincing as to how nice life can be. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a C, with Owen Gleiberman describing it as &quot;a hymn to sappiness&quot;. CNN&#x27;s Paul Clinton dismissed the remake as a &quot;schmaltzy&quot; and &quot;vapid&quot; version of &quot;Wings of Desire&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Michael O&#x27;Sullivan dismissed it as &quot;a mawkish debasement of its source material&quot;, asking &quot;When will Hollywood learn to leave well enough alone?&quot; Michael Wilmington gave it two and a half stars in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, enjoying the appearance of the film but concluding it feels &quot;forced and mechanically weepy&quot;. Writing for &quot;Empire&quot;, William Thomas credited Silberling for &quot;a fresh eye&quot;, but felt the film fell short in &quot;philosophical claptrap&quot;. Andrew Johnston writing in Time Out New York concluded: &quot;In the final reel, what began as a philosophical study of death and longing becomes a blatant tearjerker, but even then the accumulated momentum sweeps you along. Mainstream films are seldom more lyrical.&quot;

In 2012, &quot;Time&quot; included it in its Top ten On-Screen Depictions of Heaven list, for its portrayal of the &quot;go toward the light&quot; afterlife experience. In his &quot;2015 Movie Guide&quot;, Leonard Maltin gave it two and a half stars, judging it &quot;still intriguing&quot; though losing much of the atmosphere of the original. That year, &quot;Indiewire&quot;, in reviewing remakes, called &quot;City of Angels&quot; &quot;a sickly bastardization&quot; of its source material, though remarking Wenders himself was unable to duplicate its success with his 1993 sequel, &quot;Faraway, So Close!&quot;. In 2017, MSN included it in its 20 All-Time Worst Movie Remakes list, acknowledging it as a financial hit but &quot;a schmaltzy tearjerker&quot; compared to the poetry of the original.

===Accolades===
&quot;City of Angels: Music from the Motion Picture&quot; received nominations at the 41st Grammy Awards, and the film received nominations and awards at ceremonies honoring cinema:

<text>Iron Maiden are an English heavy metal band formed in Leyton, East London, in 1975 by bassist and primary songwriter Steve Harris. Although fluid in the early years of the band, the line-up for most of the band&#x27;s history has consisted of Harris, lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson, drummer Nicko McBrain, and guitarists Dave Murray, Adrian Smith and Janick Gers. As pioneers of the new wave of British heavy metal movement, Iron Maiden released a series of UK and US Platinum and Gold albums, including 1980&#x27;s debut album, 1981&#x27;s &quot;Killers&quot;, and 1982&#x27;s &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; – its first album with Dickinson, who in 1981 replaced Paul Di&#x27;Anno as lead singer. The addition of Dickinson was a turning point in their career, establishing them as one of heavy metal&#x27;s most important bands. &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; is among the most popular heavy metal albums of all time, having sold almost 20 million copies worldwide.

After some turbulence in the 1990s, the return of lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith in 1999 saw the band undergo a resurgence in popularity, with a series of new albums and highly successful tours. Their three most recent albums — &quot;The Final Frontier&quot; (2010), &quot;The Book of Souls&quot; (2015), and &quot;Senjutsu&quot; (2021) — have all reached number 1 in more than 25 countries. Iron Maiden have sold over 130 million copies of their albums worldwide and have obtained over 600 certifications. The band is considered to be one of the most influential and revered heavy metal bands of all time. They have received multiple industry awards, including the Grammy and Brit Awards.

The band have released 41 albums, including 17 studio albums, 13 live albums, four EPs and seven compilations. They have also released 47 singles and 20 video albums, and two video games. Iron Maiden&#x27;s lyrics cover such topics as history, literature, war, mythology, dark fantasy, science fiction, society and religion. , the band have played 2,500 live shows. For over 40 years the band have featured their signature mascot, &quot;Eddie&quot;, on the covers of almost all of their releases.

==History==

===Early years (1975–1978)===
Iron Maiden were formed on Christmas Day, 25 December 1975, by bassist Steve Harris shortly after he left his previous group, Smiler. Harris attributed the band&#x27;s name to a film adaptation of &quot;The Man in the Iron Mask&quot; from the novel by Alexandre Dumas, as the title reminded him of the iron maiden torture device. They originally used the name Ash Mountain, but most of the band members preferred the name Iron Maiden. After months of rehearsal, Iron Maiden made their debut at St. Nicks Hall in Poplar on 1 May 1976, before taking up a semi-residency at the Cart and Horses Pub in Maryland, Stratford. The original line-up was short-lived, with vocalist Paul Day being the first to go as, according to Harris, he lacked &quot;energy or charisma on stage&quot;. He was replaced by Dennis Wilcock, a Kiss fan who used makeup and fake blood during live performances and had earlier played with Harris and Doug Sampson in the band Smiler. Wilcock&#x27;s friend, guitarist Dave Murray, was invited to join, much to the dismay of the band&#x27;s guitarists Dave Sullivan and Terry Rance. Their frustration led Harris to temporarily disband Iron Maiden in 1976, though the group reformed soon after with Murray as the sole guitarist. Harris and Murray remain the band&#x27;s longest-serving members and have performed on all of their releases.
Iron Maiden recruited another guitarist in 1977, Bob Sawyer, who was sacked for embarrassing the band on stage by pretending to play guitar with his teeth. Tension ensued again, causing a rift between Murray and Wilcock, who convinced Harris to fire Murray, as well as original drummer Ron Matthews. A new line-up was put together, including future Cutting Crew member Tony Moore on keyboards, Terry Wapram on guitar and drummer Barry Purkis (better known today as Thunderstick). After a single gig with the band in January 1978, Moore was asked to leave as Harris decided keyboards did not suit the band&#x27;s sound. Dave Murray rejoined in late March 1978, and when Terry Wapram disapproved he was sacked. A few weeks later, Dennis Wilcock decided to leave Iron Maiden to form his own band, V1, with Wapram, and drummer Barry Purkis also left. Former Smiler drummer Doug Sampson was at Dennis&#x27; and Thunderstick&#x27;s last gig, and joined the band afterwards.

Harris, Murray and Sampson spent the summer and autumn of 1978 rehearsing while they searched for a singer to complete the band&#x27;s new line-up. A chance meeting at the Red Lion, a pub in Leytonstone, in November 1978 evolved into a successful audition for vocalist Paul Di&#x27;Anno. Steve Harris said, &quot;There&#x27;s sort of a quality in Paul&#x27;s voice, a raspiness in his voice, or whatever you want to call it, that just gave it this great edge&quot;. At this time, Murray would typically act as their sole guitarist, with Harris commenting, &quot;Davey was so good he could do a lot of it on his own. The plan was always to get a second guitarist in, but finding one that could match Davey was really difficult&quot;.

===Record contract and early releases (1978–1981)===
On New Year&#x27;s Eve, 1978, Iron Maiden recorded a four-song demo at Spaceward Studios in Cambridge. Hoping the recording would help them secure more gigs, the band gave a copy to Neal Kay, who, at the time, was managing a heavy metal club called &quot;Bandwagon Heavy Metal Soundhouse&quot;. After hearing the tape, Kay began playing the demo regularly at the Bandwagon, and one of the songs, &quot;Prowler&quot;, eventually went to number 1 in the Soundhouse charts, which were published weekly in &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine. A copy was also acquired by Rod Smallwood, who soon became the band&#x27;s manager. As Iron Maiden&#x27;s popularity increased, they released the demo on their own record label as &quot;The Soundhouse Tapes&quot;, named after the club. Featuring only three tracks (one song, &quot;Strange World&quot;, was excluded as the band were unsatisfied with its production), all 5,000 copies sold out within weeks.
In December 1979, the band secured a major record deal with EMI and asked Dave Murray&#x27;s childhood friend, Adrian Smith of Urchin, to join the group as their second guitarist. Busy with his own band, Smith declined and Dennis Stratton was hired instead. Shortly after, Doug Sampson left due to health issues and was replaced by ex-Samson drummer Clive Burr at Stratton&#x27;s suggestion on 26 December 1979. Iron Maiden&#x27;s first appearance on an EMI album was on the &quot;Metal for Muthas&quot; compilation (released on 15 February 1980) with two early versions of &quot;Sanctuary&quot; and &quot;Wrathchild&quot;. The release led to a tour including several other bands linked with the new wave of British heavy metal movement.

Iron Maiden released their self-titled album in 1980, which debuted at number 4 in the UK Albums Chart. In addition to the title track, the album included other early favourites such as &quot;Running Free&quot;, &quot;Transylvania&quot;, &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; and &quot;Sanctuary&quot; – which was not on the original UK release, but appeared on the US version and subsequent remasters. The band embarked on a headline tour of the UK, before opening for Kiss on their 1980 Unmasked Tour&#x27;s European leg as well as supporting Judas Priest on select dates. After the Kiss tour, Dennis Stratton was dismissed from the band as a result of creative and personal differences, and was replaced by Smith in October 1980. In December, the band played at the Rainbow Theatre in London, where their first live video was filmed. &quot;Live at the Rainbow&quot; was released in May 1981, and &quot;Iron Maiden&quot; and &quot;Wrathchild&quot; from this video received heavy rotation on MTV during its first hours on the air as the first metal videos ever.
In 1981, Iron Maiden released their second studio album, &quot;Killers&quot;. Although many tracks were written prior to their debut release, it had two new songs: &quot;Prodigal Son&quot; and &quot;Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot; (the latter&#x27;s title was taken from the short story by Edgar Allan Poe). Unsatisfied with the production on their debut album, the band hired veteran producer Martin Birch, who would continue to work with Iron Maiden until his retirement in 1992. The record was followed by the band&#x27;s first world tour with their debut performance in the United States opening for Judas Priest at The Aladdin Casino in Las Vegas. &quot;Killers&quot; marked the band&#x27;s USA album charts debut, reaching number 78 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and they booked 132 shows to promote the album, including their first concert in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. During the summer, Iron Maiden played several festivals in Europe, including at the Golden Summernights 1981 festivals at Zeppelinfeld in Nuremberg in front of 100,000 people.

===Success (1981–1985)===

By 1981, Paul Di&#x27;Anno was demonstrating increasingly erratic behaviour, particularly due to his drug usage, about which Di&#x27;Anno comments, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t just that I was snorting a bit of coke, though; I was just going for it non-stop, 24 hours a day, every day ... the band had commitments piling up that went on for months, years, and I just couldn&#x27;t see my way to the end of it. I knew I&#x27;d never last the whole tour. It was too much&quot;. Di&#x27;Anno was dismissed following the Killer World Tour with the band already having selected his replacement. After a meeting with Rod Smallwood at the Reading Festival, Bruce Dickinson, formerly of Samson, auditioned for Iron Maiden in September 1981 and was immediately hired. The following month, Dickinson went out on the road with the band on a small headlining tour in Italy and a one-off show at the Rainbow Theatre in the UK. For the last show, and in anticipation of their forthcoming album, the band played &quot;Children of the Damned&quot; and &quot;22 Acacia Avenue&quot;, introducing fans to their new material.

In 1982, Iron Maiden released their third studio album, &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;, which became the band&#x27;s first number 1 record on the UK Albums Chart, was a Top 10 hit in many other countries, and reached number 33 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. At the time, Dickinson was in the midst of legal difficulties with Samson&#x27;s management and was not permitted to add his name to any of the songwriting credits, although he still made what he described as a &quot;moral contribution&quot; to &quot;Children of the Damned&quot;, &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, and &quot;Run to the Hills&quot;. The band embarked on a world tour, dubbed The Beast on the Road, with shows in North America, Japan, Australia and Europe, including a headline appearance for 40,000 people at the Reading Festival. Iron Maiden played 188 shows in 10 months. The Beast on the Road&#x27;s US leg proved controversial when an American conservative political lobbying group claimed Iron Maiden were Satanic because of the new album&#x27;s title track and &quot;demonic&quot; cover art, and a group of Christian activists destroyed Iron Maiden records in protest. Dickinson later said the band treated this as &quot;silliness&quot; and the demonstrations in fact gave them &quot;loads of publicity&quot;. &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; sold 2.5 million copies in its first year, 14 million by 2010, and 20 million by 2022.
In December 1982, drummer Clive Burr was fired from the band and replaced by Nicko McBrain, who previously played for Trust. Although Harris said the dismissal took place because his live performances were affected by offstage activities, Burr later claimed he was unfairly ousted from the band. The band then recorded the first of three consecutive albums at Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas. In 1983, they released their fourth studio album, &quot;Piece of Mind&quot;, which reached the number 3 spot in the UK and number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Piece of Mind&quot; features the singles &quot;The Trooper&quot; and &quot;Flight of Icarus&quot;, the latter being one of the band&#x27;s few songs to gain substantial airplay in the US. Iron Maiden played 147 concerts in Europe and North America as a part of the World Piece Tour. This was also their first major North American tour as headliners, selling out Madison Square Garden with a crowd of 20,000.

After the success of &quot;Piece of Mind&quot; and its supporting tour, the band released their fifth studio album, &quot;Powerslave&quot;, on 9 September 1984. The album features the singles &quot;2 Minutes to Midnight&quot; and &quot;Aces High&quot;, the title track, and &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; (based on Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s poem &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;). &quot;Powerslave&quot; was another chart success, reaching number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and eventually number 1 in the UK. The band&#x27;s fifth studio album sold over 4 million copies in its first year after the premiere. The tour following the album, called World Slavery Tour, was the band&#x27;s largest to date with 193 shows in 28 countries over 13 months, playing to an estimated 3,500,000 people. Many shows were played back to back in the same city, such as in Long Beach, California, where the band played four consecutive concerts at Long Beach Arena for a combined audience of 54,000 fans. Iron Maiden also made their debut appearance in South America, where they co-headlined the Rock in Rio festival with Queen for an audience estimated at 350,000–500,000 people. The tour started in August 1984 with five shows in Poland. Iron Maiden were the first Western artists to bring full-scale production behind the Iron Curtain. The band&#x27;s third official video, entitled &quot;Behind the Iron Curtain&quot;, was released in October 1984. The World Slavery Tour documentary brought footage of the band touring Eastern Europe in 1984, performing shows in the countries visited, &quot;Behind the Iron Curtain&quot; was the first documentary ever published by a Western artist that showed them touring the countries of Eastern Bloc. The documentary movie was broadcast by MTV and local TV stations around the world.

The tour was physically gruelling for the band, who demanded six months off when it ended (although this was later reduced to four months). This was the first substantial touring break in the group&#x27;s history, including the cancellation of a proposed supporting tour for the new live album, with Bruce Dickinson threatening to quit unless the tour ended. In October 1985, Iron Maiden released the double live album and home video, &quot;Live After Death&quot;. A critical and commercial success, it peaked at number 19 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; and number 2 in the UK. The album was recorded at Long Beach Arena and also features additional tracks from four nights at London&#x27;s Hammersmith Apollo. In November 1985, Iron Maiden were named the best rock and metal band in the world and awarded at Public Choice International.

===Experimentation (1986–1989)===

Returning from their time off, the band added different musical elements to their 1986 studio album, &quot;Somewhere in Time.&quot; These focused on synthesised bass and guitars to add textures and layers to the sound. The release performed well across the world, particularly the single &quot;Wasted Years&quot;, but included no writing credits from Dickinson, whose material was rejected by the rest of the band. The album was the band&#x27;s biggest American chart success to date, reaching number 11 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; and number 2 in the UK charts. The Somewhere on Tour was also a success. The band played 157 shows for over two and a half million fans, including eighty-one shows in North America. Once again, Iron Maiden visited Poland, Hungary and Yugoslavia to play for tens of thousands of fans in each country. The experimentation evident on &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; continued on their next album, &quot;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son&quot;, which was released in 1988. A concept album recorded at Musicland Studios in Munich and based on the 1987 novel &quot;Seventh Son&quot; by Orson Scott Card, it was the band&#x27;s first record to include keyboards, which were performed by Harris and Smith. Dickinson&#x27;s enthusiasm was also renewed as his ideas were accepted for this album. Another popular release, it became Iron Maiden&#x27;s third album to hit number 1 in the UK charts and reached number 12 on the &quot;Billboard 200.&quot;

During the following tour, the band headlined the Monsters of Rock festival at Donington Park on 20 August 1988, playing to the largest crowd in the festival&#x27;s history (107,000). The tour concluded with several headline shows in the UK in November and December 1988, with the concerts at the NEC Arena, Birmingham, recorded for a live video, entitled &quot;Maiden England&quot;. The video debuted at top spots of worldwide music videos charts. In May, the group set out on a supporting tour, which saw them perform 103 shows to well over two million people worldwide over seven months. To recreate the album&#x27;s keyboards onstage throughout the tour, the group recruited Michael Kenney, Steve Harris&#x27; bass technician; Kenney has served as the band&#x27;s live keyboard player ever since, also performing on the band&#x27;s four following albums.

===Upheaval (1989–1994)===
During a break in 1989, guitarist Adrian Smith released a solo album with his band ASAP, entitled &quot;Silver and Gold.&quot; Vocalist Bruce Dickinson also began work on a solo album with former Gillan guitarist Janick Gers, releasing &quot;Tattooed Millionaire&quot; in 1990, followed by a tour. At the same time, to mark the band&#x27;s 10-year recording anniversary, Iron Maiden released a compilation collection, &quot;The First Ten Years&quot;, a series of 10 CDs and double 12-inch singles. Between 24 February and 28 April 1990, the individual parts were released one by one, each containing two of Iron Maiden&#x27;s singles, including the original B-sides.

Iron Maiden then began work on a new studio record. During the pre-production stages, Adrian Smith left the band due to differences with Steve Harris regarding the direction the band should be taking. Smith disagreed with the &quot;stripped down&quot; style they were leaning towards. Janick Gers, having worked on Dickinson&#x27;s solo project, was chosen to replace Smith and became the band&#x27;s first new member in seven years. The album &quot;No Prayer for the Dying&quot; was released in October 1990. It contained the hit singles &quot;Holy Smoke&quot; and &quot;Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter&quot;, the band&#x27;s first – and, to date, only – UK Singles Chart number 1, originally recorded by Dickinson&#x27;s solo project for the soundtrack of &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child&quot;. Iron Maiden&#x27;s eighth studio album debuted at number 2 on the UK albums chart and number 17 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;. &quot;No Prayer for the Dying&quot; was a return to their musical roots, especially in the simplicity of composition. The No Prayer on the Road tour was booked for 120 shows in Europe, North America, and Japan. Thirty-three shows in continental Europe were sold out with a reported 530,000 fans attending. In total, Iron Maiden played for some two million fans.

After another break, the band recorded their next studio album, &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot;, which was released in 1992. The title track became a regular part of the band&#x27;s concert setlists. Achieving their fourth number 1 on the UK albums chart and number 12 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;, the release also included the number 2 single &quot;Be Quick or Be Dead&quot;, the number 21 single &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot;, and the softer &quot;Wasting Love&quot;. The album featured the first songwriting by Gers, and no collaboration between Harris and Dickinson on songs. The extensive worldwide tour that followed included their first-ever Latin American leg, although Christian organisations prevented Iron Maiden from performing in Chile and accused them of being &quot;emissaries of satanic propaganda&quot;, and headlining the Monsters of Rock festivals in seven European countries. Iron Maiden&#x27;s second performance at Donington Park, for a sold-out audience of 75,000, was filmed for the audio and video release &quot;Live at Donington&quot; and featured a guest appearance by Adrian Smith, who joined the band to perform &quot;Running Free&quot;. The tour also saw conflicts between Bruce Dickinson and rest of the band.

In 1993, Dickinson left the band to pursue his solo career, but agreed to remain for a farewell tour and two live albums (later re-released in one package). The first, &quot;A Real Live One&quot;, was released in March 1993 and featured songs from 1986 to 1992, and the second, &quot;A Real Dead One&quot;, was released after Dickinson left the band and featured songs from 1980 to 1984. The tour did not go well, with Steve Harris claiming Dickinson would only perform properly for high-profile shows, and that at several concerts, he would only mumble into the microphone. Dickinson denied he was under-performing, saying it was impossible to &quot;make like Mr. Happy Face if the vibe wasn&#x27;t right&quot;, and that news of his exit from the band had prevented any chance of a good atmosphere during the tour. Dickinson played his farewell show with Iron Maiden on 28 August 1993. The show was filmed, broadcast by the BBC, MTV and released on video under the name &quot;Raising Hell&quot;.

===Difficulties (1994–1999)===

In 1994, the title track from the &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot; album received a Grammy Awards nomination for &quot;Best Metal Performance&quot;, a first for Iron Maiden. The band listened to the thousands of tapes sent in by vocalists before convincing Blaze Bayley, formerly of the band Wolfsbane, who had supported Iron Maiden in 1990, to audition for them. Harris&#x27; preferred choice from the outset, Bayley had a different vocal style from his predecessor and ultimately received a mixed reception among fans.

After a three-year hiatus – a record for the band at the time – Iron Maiden released their next studio album, &quot;The X Factor&quot;. The band had their lowest chart position since 1981 for an album in the UK, debuting at number 8; however, the album went on to win &quot;Album of the Year&quot; awards in France, Spain and Germany. The record included the 11-minute epic &quot;Sign of the Cross&quot;, the band&#x27;s longest song since &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;, as well as the singles &quot;Man on the Edge&quot; (based on the film &quot;Falling Down&quot;) and &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, based on the novel &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;. The release is notable for its &quot;dark&quot; tone, inspired by Steve Harris&#x27; divorce. The band toured for the rest of 1995 and 1996, playing their first shows in Israel and South Africa as well as Malta, Bulgaria and Romania in Europe, before concluding in the Americas. The biggest show of the whole tour was a headline appearance for 60,000 people at the Monsters of Rock festival in São Paulo, Brazil.&quot;The X Factor&quot; sold 1.3 million copies, the lowest sales result since 1981. After the tour, Iron Maiden released a compilation album, &quot;Best of the Beast&quot;. The band&#x27;s first compilation, it included a new single, &quot;Virus&quot;, in which the lyrics attack critics who had recently written off the band.

In 1998, Iron Maiden released &quot;Virtual XI&quot;, whose chart scores were the band&#x27;s lowest to date. The album peaked at number 16 in the UK, the band&#x27;s lowest for a new studio record. At the same time, Steve Harris assisted in remastering the band&#x27;s entire discography, up to and including &quot;Live at Donington&quot;. Bayley&#x27;s tenure in Iron Maiden ended in January 1999 when he was asked to leave during a band meeting. The dismissal took place due to issues Bayley had experienced with his voice during the Virtual XI World Tour, although Janick Gers said this was partly the band&#x27;s fault for forcing him to perform songs pitched outside the natural range of his voice.

===Reunion and renewed success (1999–2005)===
The band entered into talks with Dickinson, who agreed to rejoin during a meeting in Brighton in January 1999, along with guitarist Adrian Smith, who was telephoned a few hours later. With Gers remaining, Iron Maiden now had a three-guitar line-up (nicknamed &quot;The Three Amigos&quot;), and embarked on a hugely successful reunion tour. Dubbed The Ed Hunter Tour, it tied in with the band&#x27;s newly released greatest hits collection, &quot;Ed Hunter&quot;, whose track listing was decided by a poll on the group&#x27;s website, and also contained a computer game starring Eddie, the band&#x27;s mascot.

Not satisfied with the results from Harris&#x27; Barnyard Studios, located on his property in Essex, which had been used for the last four Iron Maiden studio albums, the band recorded the new release, &quot;Brave New World&quot;, at Guillaume Tell Studios in Paris, France in November 1999 with producer Kevin Shirley. Iron Maiden continued to find inspiration in movies and books, as shown in songs like &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; – based on the 1973 British cult film &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; – and &quot;Brave New World&quot; – a title taken from the Aldous Huxley novel &quot;Brave New World&quot;. The album revisited the more progressive and melodic sound featured in some earlier recordings, along with elaborate song structures and keyboard orchestration. The album was a commercial and artistic success.

The reunion world tour that followed had over 100 dates (including 31 shows of the 1999 tour), and culminated on 19 January 2001 in a show at the Rock in Rio festival in Brazil, where Iron Maiden played to an audience of over 250,000. While the performance was being produced for a CD and DVD release in March 2002, under the name &quot;Rock in Rio&quot;, the band took a year off from touring, although they played three consecutive shows at Brixton Academy to raise funds for former drummer Clive Burr, who had recently announced that he had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. The band performed two further concerts for Burr&#x27;s MS Trust Fund charity in 2005, and 2007, before his death in 2013. During the 2000–2002 tour, Iron Maiden played 91 shows for over two million people in 33 countries. In addition to their touring success, the band was nominated twice for the annual Grammy Awards and received the International Achievement Award at the 2001 Ivor Novello Awards. In November 2001, a documentary movie about the making of &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; album was produced by BBC as a part of the &quot;Classic Album series&quot;.

Following their summer 2003 Give Me Ed... &#x27;Til I&#x27;m Dead Tour, with 57 shows in Europe and North America and headlining large festivals such as Roskilde, Heineken Jammin&#x27; Festival, Rock am Ring and Rock im Park (combined attendance of 130,000) and the first Download Festival held at Donington Park; a successor to Monsters of Rock, Iron Maiden released &quot;Dance of Death&quot;, their thirteenth studio album. It met with worldwide critical and commercial success, reaching number 2 on the UK Albums Chart and number 18 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;. Produced by Kevin Shirley, now the band&#x27;s regular producer, many critics felt this release reached the standard of their earlier efforts. Historical and literary references were present, with &quot;Montségur&quot; focussing on the Cathar stronghold conquered in 1244, and &quot;Paschendale&quot; relating to the First World War battle.

During the Dance of Death Tour 2003–04, which began in September 2003, Iron Maiden played 53 shows across Europe, North America, Latin America and Japan. The band&#x27;s performance at Westfalenhalle, in Dortmund, Germany, was recorded and released in August 2005 as a live album and DVD entitled &quot;Death on the Road&quot;. In 2005, the band announced the Eddie Rips Up the World Tour, which, tying in with their 2004 DVD entitled &quot;The History of Iron Maiden – Part 1: The Early Days&quot;, only featured material from their first four albums. As part of this celebration of their earlier years, &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; single was re-released and went straight to number 3 on the UK Chart. The tour featured many headlining stadium and festival dates, including a performance at Ullevi Stadium in Sweden to an audience of almost 60,000. This concert was also broadcast live on satellite television across Europe to approximately 60 million viewers. The band completed the tour by headlining the Reading and Leeds Festivals on 26–28 August, and the RDS Stadium in Ireland on 31 August.

===Continued success and expanded tours (2005–2014)===
At the end of 2005, Iron Maiden began work on &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot;, their fourteenth studio album, which was released in autumn 2006. War and religion are recurring themes in the lyrics and the cover artwork. The release was a critical and commercial success, marking the band&#x27;s first top ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and debuting at number one in the album charts of 13 countries. The supporting tour saw mixed critical reception, but included the band&#x27;s first performance in Dubai at the Dubai Desert Rock Festival for 25,000 people, followed by a concert in Bangalore Palace Grounds, the first of any heavy metal band in India. The band then played a string of European dates, including an appearance at Download Festival, their fourth headline performance at Donington Park, to approximately 80,000 people.
On 5 September 2007, the band announced their Somewhere Back in Time World Tour, tying in with the DVD release of their &quot;Live After Death&quot; album. The setlist for the tour consisted of songs from the 1980s. They played their first concerts in Costa Rica and Colombia and their first shows in Australia and Puerto Rico since 1992. The tour led to the release of a new compilation album, entitled &quot;Somewhere Back in Time&quot;, which included a selection of tracks from their 1980 eponymous debut to 1988&#x27;s &quot;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son&quot;, as well as several live versions from &quot;Live After Death&quot;. In 2008–09 in Latin America the band played 27 concerts for about a million people in total, a record for a heavy rock performer. The tour continued with two legs in the US and Europe in the summer of 2008. The sole UK concert took place at Twickenham Stadium, marking the first time the band would headline a stadium in their own country. The 2008 tour was the second highest-grossing tour of the year for a British artist. The final leg included the band&#x27;s first appearances in Peru and Ecuador, as well as their return to Venezuela and New Zealand after 17 years. The band also played another show in India at the Rock in India festival to a crowd of 20,000. At their concert in São Paulo on 15 March, Dickinson announced on stage that it was the largest non-festival show of their career, with an overall attendance of 100,000 people. The final leg ended in Florida on 2 April after which the band took a break. Overall, the tour reportedly had an attendance of over two and a half million people worldwide over both years. At the 2009 Brit Awards, Iron Maiden won the award for best British live act.

On 20 January 2009, the band announced they were planning to release a full-length documentary film in select cinemas on 21 April 2009. Entitled &quot;Iron Maiden: Flight 666&quot;, it documented the first part of the Somewhere Back in Time World Tour (between February and March 2008). &quot;Flight 666&quot; was co-produced by Banger Productions and was distributed in cinemas by Arts Alliance Media and EMI, with D&amp;E Entertainment sub-distributing in the US. The film went on to have a Blu-ray, DVD, and CD release in May and June, topping the music DVD charts in 25 countries. In most of them the release went Gold, Platinum or Multi-Platinum.

The band had begun composing new material and booked studio time in early 2010 with Kevin Shirley producing, and &quot;The Final Frontier&quot; was announced on 4 March and featured three singles &quot;The Final Frontier&quot;, &quot;El Dorado&quot; and &quot;Coming Home&quot;, as well as epic, progressive opuses &quot;Isle of Avalon&quot;, &quot;The Talisman&quot; and &quot;When The Wild Wind Blows&quot;. The album, the band&#x27;s fifteenth, was released on 16 August to critical acclaim. It was also the band&#x27;s greatest commercial success to that point, reaching number 1 in twenty-eight countries worldwide, including a debut at number 4 on &quot;Billboard 200&quot;.

The album&#x27;s supporting tour saw the band perform 101 shows across the globe to an estimated audience of over two and a half million, including their first visits to Singapore, Indonesia, and South Korea. &quot;El Dorado&quot; won the Best Metal Performance award at the 2011 Grammy Awards, the band&#x27;s first win after two previous nominations. On 15 March, a new compilation to accompany 2009&#x27;s &quot;Somewhere Back in Time&quot; was announced. The double disc set covers the period 1990–2010 (the band&#x27;s most recent eight studio albums). In 2012, the band announced a new live album and DVD release entitled &quot;En Vivo!&quot;, based on footage from the Chile concert. The DVD topped the music video charts around the world. In addition to the concert footage, the video release includes an 88-minute tour documentary, entitled Behind The Beast, containing interviews with the band and their crew. In December 2012, one song from the release (&quot;Blood Brothers&quot;) was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance at the 2013 Grammy Awards.

On 15 February, the band announced their third retrospective Maiden England World Tour 2012–14, which was based around the video &quot;Maiden England&quot;. The tour commenced in North America in the summer of 2012 and was followed by further dates in 2013 and 2014, and included the band&#x27;s fifth headline performance at Donington Park with 100,000 fans in attendance. Iron Maiden closed the tour in July 2014 at Sonisphere Festival, Knebworth, having undertaken 100 shows in 32 countries before an estimated audience of more than 2.7 million people.

===Latest albums and tours (2015–present)===
The band&#x27;s 2015 album, &quot;The Book of Souls&quot;, was released on 4 September. The band&#x27;s first original studio album not to be issued by EMI outside North America, following Parlophone&#x27;s acquisition by Warner Music Group in 2013, it was a critical and commercial success, becoming the band&#x27;s fifth UK number 1 album and hit number 4 on &quot;Billboard 200&quot; in the US. The new release reached the number one position in the album charts of 43 countries. The new record was recorded at Guillaume Tell Studios in late summer 2014; its closing song, &quot;Empire of the Clouds&quot;, penned by Dickinson, surpassed &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; (from 1984&#x27;s &quot;Powerslave&quot;) as Iron Maiden&#x27;s longest song, at 18 minutes in length.
In February 2016, the band embarked on The Book of Souls World Tour, with shows in 35 countries across six continents, including their first performances in China, El Salvador, and Lithuania. It was the band&#x27;s biggest album tour since 1996. In total, Iron Maiden played 117 shows on six continents for well over two and a half million people. The band then launched the Legacy of the Beast World Tour in Europe in 2018, with North and South American shows following in 2019. The tour was inspired by the band&#x27;s new mobile game and comic series released in 2017, entitled &quot;Legacy of the Beast&quot;. The tour was received very positively by fans and critics, spanning up to three years with 140 shows, performing to over 3.5 million fans.

The COVID-19 pandemic forced the rescheduling of nearly one million tickets from 2020, first to 2021, and then to 2022. In October 2020, the band announced they would release a live album from the Legacy of the Beast World Tour called &quot;Nights of the Dead, Legacy of the Beast: Live in Mexico City&quot;. The double concert album was recorded during three sold-out concerts in Mexico City&#x27;s Palacio de los Deportes for a combined audience of over 70,000 people.

On 15 July 2021, Iron Maiden released a video for their first song in six years, &quot;The Writing on the Wall&quot;, which was directed by Nicos Livesey. Four days later, the band announced their seventeenth studio album, &quot;Senjutsu&quot;, would be released on 3 September 2021. &quot;Senjutsu&quot; eventually reached the top of the best-seller lists in 27 countries, but it was the band&#x27;s first album in fifteen years not to reach number one on the UK charts, although it did top the UK Rock &amp; Metal Singles and Albums Charts. In total, &quot;Senjutsu&quot; reached the top three in 55 countries and the top five in 63 countries.

On 1 February 2023, the band received their second nomination for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band started their 25th global tour, The Future Past World Tour, with a concert in Ljubljana in May 2023. On 6 October, the band performed at the Power Trip festival which drew nearly 100,000 people. Throughout the 2023–24 world tour, Iron Maiden performed 81 shows for almost two million fans. Following the conclusion of the tour in São Paulo in December 2024, McBrain retired from touring, but would still remain a member of Iron Maiden and be involved with various upcoming band-related projects in the studio. The following day, it was announced that British Lion drummer Simon Dawson would be his touring replacement for any further tours.

On 19 September 2024, the band announced their 26th global tour, Run For Your Lives World Tour, which is set to start in May 2025, to celebrate the band&#x27;s 50th anniversary and is set to be focused on the band&#x27;s first nine studio albums.

==Image and legacy==
Iron Maiden have received numerous nominations, honours and awards including Grammy Awards and equivalents awards in many countries, Brit Awards, Ivor Novello Awards, and Juno Awards. They have ranked highly in many polls of the greatest metal artists of all time. In 2012 &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; was voted as Best British Album Ever by the British public as part of Elizabeth II&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee celebrations. Iron Maiden have an exhibit at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and Rock in Rio Wall of Fame.

Iron Maiden were inducted into Hollywood RockWalk, BPI Hall of Fame and Kerrang! Hall of Fame. Band&#x27;s mascot Eddie the Head is a part of the British Music Experience permanent exhibition. In April 2021, the band&#x27;s former members (Paul Di&#x27;Anno, Blaze Bayley, and illustrator Derek Riggs) were inducted into the Metal Hall of Fame. They have twice been nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In January 2023 Iron Maiden were honoured by Royal Mail UK with dedicated postal stamps and cards.

Iron Maiden have sold over 130 million copies of their albums worldwide, despite little radio or television support. According to many sources all audio-visual catalogue of the band have sold in over 200 million copies worldwide, including regular albums, singles, compilations, and videos. Their third studio album, &quot;The Number of the Beast,&quot; is among the most popular heavy metal albums of all time and the most commercially successful release of the band, having sold almost 20 million copies worldwide. As of 2022 their releases have been certified silver, gold and platinum around 600 times worldwide.
In 1979–1980, visual artist Derek Riggs created the macabre mascot named Eddie The Head. Since then, Eddie has been an integral part of the stage and media image of the group. Originally a papier-mâché mask which would squirt fake blood during their live shows, the character featured on the band&#x27;s debut album cover, also done by Derek Riggs. Eddie was painted exclusively by Riggs until 1992, at which point the band began using artwork from other artists, including Melvyn Grant.

A large puppet version of Eddie has appeared many times during carnival celebrations in Rio de Janeiro and other South American cities. During the Cavalcade of Magi 2021 in the Spanish city of Cadiz, next to dolls representing characters known from the world of pop culture, there was a huge, inflatable mummy inspired by the image of the Iron Maiden mascot from 1985.
Iron Maiden&#x27;s distinct logo has adorned all of the band&#x27;s releases since their debut, 1979&#x27;s &quot;The Soundhouse Tapes&quot; EP. The typeface originates with Vic Fair&#x27;s poster design for the 1976 science fiction film, &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot;, also used by Gordon Giltrap, although Steve Harris claims he designed it himself, using his training as an architectural draughtsman.

===Influence on other artists and the genre===
Iron Maiden have influenced numerous artists and bands representing different genres of rock and metal music. Kiss co-founder Paul Stanley said Iron Maiden &quot;have helped spawn an entire genre of music&quot; and influenced literally thousands of other artists. According to &quot;Guitar World&quot;, Iron Maiden&#x27;s music has &quot;influenced generations of newer metal acts, from legends like Metallica to current stars like Avenged Sevenfold.&quot; Metallica members Lars Ulrich, Kirk Hammett, and Jason Newsted have cited Iron Maiden as a major influence on their work. Other bands and artists directly influenced by Iron Maiden include Ghost, Avenged Sevenfold, In Flames, Anthrax, Exodus, and Alice in Chains.

Journalist Geoff Barton says the band&#x27;s music constituted an important passage between the classic heavy rock school during the 1960s and 1970s, based on rhythm and blues, and contemporary heavy metal, characterised by sub-genre diversification and stylistic eclecticism. Music journalist Götz Kühnemund said &quot;Iron Maiden were (and still are) the inspiration for all the heavy metal bands we know today because they&#x27;re an intrinsically heavy metal group. They&#x27;re equally important for those who play power metal, speed, thrash, death, black, nu metal, metal core and hard rock – almost every genre.&quot; The journalist stated the band introduced a DIY approach to all rock music. According to Rock &#x27;n Roll Fantasy Camp the style and attitude of Iron Maiden drummer Nicko McBrain has inspired generations of heavy-metal drummers that followed. Music writer, heavy metal expert and radio broadcaster Scott Penfold stated band&#x27;s &quot;influence on the genre is immeasurable, as they not only inspired subsequent generations of metal bands but also revolutionized live shows with their elaborate stage productions, further cementing their status as pioneers of heavy metal.&quot;

Music journalist and the writer Neil Daniels said Iron Maiden &quot;redefined the whole genre blending classic heavy rock influence with punky vibe, twin guitars attack and progressive approach which finally have created the new quality. [The] Band&#x27;s influence on generations of rock and metal bands cannot be overstated. They elevated metal to an art form, proving that academic and musical inspirations can coexist.&quot; The band&#x27;s profile by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame says &quot;in the 1980s, Iron Maiden released seven high-octane albums that cemented them as one of the greatest rock bands – creating a blueprint for how heavy metal bands should look, sound and tour.&quot; According to &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; Iron Maiden is the second band to Black Sabbath, which has had the most significant impact on metal and heavy rock music.

===Appearance in media===
The first heavy metal videos broadcast by MTV were the live versions of &quot;Iron Maiden&quot; and &quot;Wrathchild&quot; taken from the official VHS &quot;Live at the Rainbow (Iron Maiden)&quot;. In 1989, Iron Maiden took part in the Rock Aid Armenia project (also known as Live Aid Armenia) - a humanitarian project by the British music industry. The project aimed to raise funds to help people affected by the earthquake in Armenia in 1988.

The number of releases in tribute to the British band can be estimated in the hundreds, with an extremely wide range of stylistic variants. In 2008, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; released &quot;Maiden Heaven: A Tribute to Iron Maiden&quot;, an album composed of Iron Maiden cover songs performed by Metallica, Machine Head, Dream Theater, Trivium, Coheed and Cambria, Avenged Sevenfold, and other groups influenced by the band. In 2010, Maiden uniteD, an acoustic tribute band consisting of members of Ayreon, Threshold and Within Temptation, released &quot;Mind the Acoustic Pieces&quot;, a re-interpretation of the entire &quot;Piece of Mind&quot; album. As of 2021 nearly 200 Iron Maiden cover audio-visual releases exist (each featuring various artists), including piano, electro, string quartet and hip-hop tributes.

In March 2025, Netflix will release &quot;Run to the Hills&quot;, a documentary celebrating Iron Maiden&#x27;s 50th anniversary. Directed by David Morgan, it will explore the band&#x27;s rise from their early days in London to global heavy metal icons. The exact release date is yet to be confirmed.

===Claims of Satanic references===
The 1982 release of &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; created some controversy for the band. The artwork and title track led to Christian groups in the United States branding the band as Satanists, encouraging people to destroy copies of the release. The band&#x27;s manager, Rod Smallwood, later said the groups initially burnt the records, but later decided to destroy them with hammers due to fear of breathing in the melting vinyl&#x27;s fumes. The protests were not restricted to the US, with Christian organisations preventing Iron Maiden from performing in Chile in 1992.

The band have always denied the notion they are Satanists, with lead vocalist, Bruce Dickinson, doing so on-stage in the &quot;Live After Death&quot; concert video. Steve Harris has since commented that, &quot;It was mad. They completely got the wrong end of the stick. They obviously hadn&#x27;t read the lyrics. They just wanted to believe all that rubbish about us being Satanists.&quot; Harris has also said that &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; song was inspired by a nightmare he had after watching &quot;&quot;, and also influenced by Robert Burns&#x27; &quot;Tam o&#x27; Shanter&quot;. The band&#x27;s drummer, Nicko McBrain, has been a born-again Christian since 1999.

===Ed Force One===
For their Somewhere Back in Time World Tour in 2008 and 2009, Iron Maiden commissioned an Astraeus Airlines Boeing 757 as transport. The aeroplane was converted into a combi configuration, which enabled it to carry the band, their crew and stage production, allowing the group to perform in countries which were previously deemed unreachable logistically. It was also repainted with a special Iron Maiden livery, which the airline decided to retain after receiving positive feedback from customers.
The aircraft, named &quot;Ed Force One&quot; after a competition on the band&#x27;s website, was flown by Dickinson until 2022, as he was also a commercial airline pilot for Astraeus; the plane also appears in the documentary &quot;Iron Maiden: Flight 666&quot;. For The Book of Souls World Tour in 2016, the band upgraded to an ex-Air France Boeing 747-400 jumbo jet which allows for more space without the aircraft having to undergo a significant conversion to carry their equipment.

==Musical style and influences==

Steve Harris, Iron Maiden&#x27;s bassist and primary songwriter, has said his influences include Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Uriah Heep, Pink Floyd, Genesis, Yes, Jethro Tull, Thin Lizzy, UFO, Queen, and Wishbone Ash. In 2010 Harris said, &quot;I think if anyone wants to understand Maiden&#x27;s early thing, in particular the harmony guitars, all they have to do is listen to Wishbone Ash&#x27;s &quot;Argus&quot; album. Thin Lizzy too, but not as much. And then we wanted to have a bit of a prog thing thrown in as well, because I was really into bands like Genesis and Jethro Tull. So you combine all that with the heavy riffs and the speed, and you&#x27;ve got it.&quot; In 2004, Harris explained the band&#x27;s &quot;heaviness&quot; was inspired by &quot;Black Sabbath and Deep Purple with a bit of Zeppelin thrown in.&quot; Harris also developed his own playing style, which guitarist Janick Gers describes as &quot;more like a rhythm guitar.&quot; Harris&#x27;s bass technique is responsible for the band&#x27;s galloping style, heard in such songs as &quot;The Trooper&quot; and &quot;Run to the Hills&quot;.

The band&#x27;s guitarists, Dave Murray, Adrian Smith, and Janick Gers, each have their own individual influences and playing styles. Dave Murray is known for his legato technique which, he says, &quot;evolved naturally. I&#x27;d heard Jimi Hendrix using legato when I was growing up, and I liked that style of playing.&quot; Stating that he &quot;was inspired by blues rock rather than metal,&quot; Adrian Smith was influenced by Johnny Winter and Pat Travers, leading to him becoming a &quot;melodic player.&quot; Janick Gers prefers a more improvised style, largely inspired by Ritchie Blackmore, which he says is in contrast to Smith&#x27;s &quot;rhythmic&quot; sound.

Singer Bruce Dickinson, who typically works in collaboration with guitarist Adrian Smith, has an operatic vocal style, inspired by Arthur Brown, Peter Hammill, Ian Anderson and Ian Gillan, and is often considered to be one of the best heavy metal vocalists of all time. Although Nicko McBrain has only received one writing credit, on the &quot;Dance of Death&quot; album, Harris often relies on him while developing songs. Adrian Smith commented, &quot;Steve loves playing with him. [They] used to work for hours going over these bass and drum patterns.&quot;

Throughout their career, the band&#x27;s style has remained largely unchanged, although the addition of guitar synthesisers on 1986&#x27;s &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;, keyboards on 1988&#x27;s &quot;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son&quot;, and an attempt to return to the &quot;stripped down&quot; production of their earlier material on &quot;No Prayer for the Dying&quot; marked some experimentation. In recent years, however, the band have begun using more progressive elements in their songs, which Steve Harris describes as not progressive &quot;in the modern sense, but like Dream Theater, more in a 70s way&quot;. Greg Prato of Ultimate-Guitar wrote, &quot;By and large, Iron Maiden&#x27;s long and lengthy career can be categorized into two separate eras: &quot;punk Maiden&quot; and &quot;prog Maiden&quot;. According to Harris, &quot;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son&quot; was the band&#x27;s first album which was &quot;more progressive&quot;, and they would return to this style in 1995&#x27;s &quot;The X Factor&quot;, which he states is &quot;like an extension of &quot;Seventh Son&quot;..., in the sense of the progressive element to it&quot;. The development contrasts with the band&#x27;s raw-sounding earlier material, which AllMusic states was &quot;clearly drawing from elements of punk rock&quot;, although Harris firmly denies this.

<doc id="159178" wikidata="Q7617455" url="?curid=159178" title="Stinking badges">
<text>&quot;Stinkin&#x27; badges&quot; is a paraphrase of a line of dialogue from the 1948 film &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot;. That line was in turn derived from dialogue in the 1927 novel of the same name, which was the basis for the film.

In 2005, the full quote from the film was chosen as #36 on the American Film Institute list, AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes. The shorter, better-known version of the quote was first heard in the 1967 episode of the TV series &quot;The Monkees&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s a Nice Place to Visit&quot;. It was also included in the 1974 Mel Brooks film &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;, and has since been included in many other films and television shows.

==History==
The original version of the line appeared in B. Traven&#x27;s novel &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot; (1927):

The line was popularized by John Huston&#x27;s 1948 film adaptation of the novel, which was altered from its content in the novel to meet the Motion Picture Production Code regulations severely limiting profanity in film. In one scene, a Mexican bandit leader named &quot;Gold Hat&quot; (portrayed by Alfonso Bedoya) tries to convince Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) that he and his company are &quot;Federales&quot;:
==Appearances in media==

===Comics===
*In one issue of the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; Archie comics, the Malignoid drones Scul and Bean meet with the nihilistic industrian Null to discuss the contract between him and the Malignoid queen Maligna. When Null insists on consolidating the contract through his lawyers, either Scul or Bean yells out: &quot;Lawyers?! We don&#x27;t need no stinkin&#x27; lawyers!!&quot;
*In the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles &quot;series from Image Comics, Donatello paraphrases a variation of that sentence (&quot;Plans?! I don&#x27;t need no stinking plans!&quot;) whilst using his cyborg systems to restore a stripped-down aircar.

===Games===
* In the game &quot;Leisure Suit Larry 6: Shape Up or Slip Out!&quot; (1993), the main protagonist has the line of dialogue, &quot;Badges? Ve don&#x27; need no steenkin&#x27; badges!&quot; to Cavaricchi, the aerobics instructor.

===Literature===
* The Luis Valdez play &quot;I Don&#x27;t Have to Show You No Stinkin&#x27; Badges&quot; (1987) draws its title from this quote, and makes a specific reference to &quot;Sierra Madre&quot;.
* In &quot;Eldest&quot; (2005), the second novel in Christopher Paolini&#x27;s The Inheritance Cycle series, a cobbler named Loring eschews the use of barges as a means of human transportation, saying, &quot;Barges? We don&#x27;t want no stinking barges.&quot;
* In William S. Burroughs&#x27; report on the 1968 Democratic Convention for &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine, Burroughs has a cop demand to see the permit of the candidate&#x27;s entourage. The response is: &quot;Permits? We don&#x27;t have any permits. We don&#x27;t have to show you any stinking permits. You are talking suh to the future President of America.&quot;

<text>Ali Shariati Mazinani (, 23 November 1933 – 18 June 1977) was an Iranian revolutionary and sociologist who focused on the sociology of religion. He is held as one of the most influential Iranian intellectuals of the 20th century, and has been called the &quot;ideologue of the Islamic Revolution&quot;, although his ideas did not end up forming the basis of the Islamic Republic.

==Biography==
Ali Shariati (Ali Masharati) was born in 1933 in Mazinan, a suburb of Sabzevar, in northeastern Iran. His father&#x27;s family were clerics. His father, Mohammad-Taqi, was a teacher and Islamic scholar. In 1947, he opened the Centre for the Propagation of Islamic Truths in Mashhad, in Khorasan Province. It was a social Islamic forum which became embroiled in the oil nationalisation movement of the 1950s. Shariati&#x27;s mother was a small land-owning family, stemming from Sabzevar, a little town near Mashhad.

In his years at the Teacher&#x27;s Training College in Mashhad, Shariati came into contact with young people who were from less privileged economic classes of society, and for the first time saw the poverty and hardship that existed in Iran during that period. At the same time, he was exposed to many aspects of Western philosophical and political thought. He attempted to explain and offer solutions for the problems faced by Muslim societies through traditional Islamic principles interwoven with, and understood from, the point of view of modern sociology and philosophy. His articles from this period for the Mashhad daily newspaper, &quot;Khorasan&quot;, display his developing eclecticism and acquaintance with the ideas of modernist thinkers such as Jamal al-Din al-Afghani, Sir Allama Muhammad Iqbal of Pakistan, among the Muslim community, and Sigmund Freud and Alexis Carrel.

In 1952, he became a high-school teacher and founded the Islamic Students&#x27; Association, which led to his arrest following a demonstration. In 1953, the year of Mossadeq&#x27;s overthrow, he became a member of the National Front. He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Mashhad in 1955. In 1957, he was arrested again by the Iranian police, along with sixteen other members of the National Resistance Movement.

Shariati then earned a scholarship to continue his graduate studies at University of Paris under the supervision of the Iranist Gilbert Lazard. He left Paris after earning a PhD in Persian language in 1964. During this period in Paris, Shariati started collaborating with the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) in 1959. The following year, he began to read Frantz Fanon and translated an anthology of his work into Persian. Shariati introduced Fanon&#x27;s thought into Iranian revolutionary émigrée circles. He was arrested in Paris on 17 January 1961 during a demonstration in honour of Patrice Lumumba.

The same year he joined Ebrahim Yazdi, Mostafa Chamran and Sadegh Qotbzadeh in founding the Freedom Movement of Iran abroad. In 1962, he continued studying sociology and the history of religions in Paris, and followed the courses of Islamic scholar Louis Massignon, Jacques Berque and the sociologist Georges Gurvitch. He also came to know the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre that same year, and published Jalal Al-e Ahmad&#x27;s book &quot;Gharbzadegi&quot; (or &quot;Occidentosis&quot;) in Iran.

Shariati then returned to Iran in 1964, where he was arrested and imprisoned for engaging in subversive political activities while in France. He was released after a few weeks, at which point he began teaching at the University of Mashhad.

Shariati next went to Tehran, where he began lecturing at the Hosseiniye Ershad Institute. These lectures were hugely popular among his students and were spread by word of mouth throughout all economic sectors of society, including the middle and upper classes, where interest in his teachings began to grow.

His continued success again aroused the interest of the government, which arrested him, along with many of his students. Widespread pressure from the people, and an international outcry, eventually led to his release on 20 March 1975, after eighteen months in solitary confinement.

Shariati was allowed to leave for England. Shortly after, on June 18, 1977, he was found dead in Southampton at the house he was renting from psychology professor Dr. Butterworth. He is believed to have been killed by the SAVAK, the Iranian security service during the time of the Shah. However, in Ali Rahnema&#x27;s biography of Shariati, he is said to have died of a heart attack under mysterious circumstances, although no hospital or medical records have been found. He is buried next to Sayyidah Zaynab, the granddaughter of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and the daughter of Ali, in Damascus, where Iranian pilgrims often visit.

===Views and popularity===

Shariati sought to revive the revolutionary currents of Shiism. His interpretation of Shiism encouraged revolution in the world, and promised salvation after death. He referred to his brand of Shiism as &quot;red Shiism&quot; which he contrasted with non-revolutionary &quot;black Shiism&quot; or Safavid Shiism. His ideas have been compared to the Catholic Liberation Theology movement founded in South America by Peruvian Gustavo Gutierrez and Brazilian Leonardo Boff.

Shariati was a prominent philosopher of Islam, who argued that a good society would conform to Islamic values. He suggested that the role of government was to guide society in the best possible manner rather than manage it in the best possible way. He believed that the most learned members of the Ulema (clergy) should play a leadership role in guiding society because they best understand how to administer an Islamic value system based on the teachings of the Prophets of God and the 12 Shia Twelver Imams. He argued that the role of the clergy was to guide society in accordance with Islamic values to advance human beings towards reaching their highest potential—not to provide/serve the hedonistic desires of individuals as in the West.

At the same time, Shariati was very critical of some clerics and defended the Marxists. &quot;Our mosques, the revolutionary left and our preachers,&quot; he declared, &quot;work for the benefit of the deprived people and against the lavish and lush... Our clerics who teach jurisprudence and issue &quot;fatwas&quot; are right-wingers, capitalist, and conservative; simply our &quot;fiqh&quot; is at the service of capitalism.&quot;

Shariati&#x27;s works were highly influenced by Louis Massignon and the Third Worldism that he encountered as a student in Paris—ideas that class war and revolution would bring about a just and classless society—from one side, and the epistemic decolonisation thinking of his time from the other side. He is said to have adopted the idea of &quot;Gharbzadegi&quot; from Jalal Al-e Ahmad and given it &quot;its most vibrant and influential second life&quot;.

He sought to translate these ideas into cultural symbols of Shiism that Iranians could relate to. Shariati believed Shia should not merely await the return of the 12th Imam, but should actively work to hasten his return by fighting for social justice, &quot;even to the point of embracing martyrdom,&quot; saying &quot;every day is Ashoura, every place is the Karbala&quot;.

When he was writing the three letters to Fanon, unlike him, Shariati believed that it is not true that one must put away religion to fight imperialism. He felt that people could fight imperialism solely by recovering their cultural identity. In some countries, such an identity was intertwined with fundamental religious beliefs. Shariati refers to the maxim of returning to ourselves.

Social theorist Asef Bayat has recorded his observations as a witness and participant in the Iranian revolution of 1979. He asserts that Shariati emerged at the time of the revolution as &quot;an unparalleled revolutionary intellectual&quot; with his portraits widely present during the marches and protests and his nickname as &quot;mo&#x27;allem-e enqilab&quot; (revolutionary mentor) chanted by millions and whose literature and tapes had already been widely available before the revolution. &quot;My father&quot; recalls Bayat, &quot;barely literate, had his own copies&quot; of Shariati&#x27;s works.

====On the role of women====
In Expectations from the Muslim Woman, also called &quot;Our Expectations of the Muslim Woman&quot;, first given in 1975, Shariati discusses women&#x27;s rights in Islam. The point of his lecture is not to show that women&#x27;s rights do not exist in Islam, but to show that what Shariati saw as anti-Islamic traditions have had tragic results for Muslim women. He uses Fatima Zahra, the daughter of Muhammad, as an example of a woman who played a significant role in political life.

He begins his lecture by stating that:

Most often, we are satisfied by pointing out that Islam gives great value to science or establishes progressive rights for women. Unfortunately we never actually use or benefit from this value or these rights.

He continues by stating that:

From the 18th through to the 20th century (particularly after World War 2) any attempt to address the special problem of the social rights of women and their specific characteristics has been seen as a mere by-product of a spiritual or psychic shock or the result of a revolutionary crisis in centers of learning or as a response to political currents and international movements. Thus, traditional societies, historical societies, religious societies, either in the East or in the West (be they tribal, Bedouin, civilized Muslim or non-Muslim societies, in whatever social or cultural stage of civilization they may be) have all been directly or indirectly influenced by these thoughts, intellectual currents and even new social realities.

He argues that the liberation of women has begun in the West, and many fear it occurring in the Muslim world, in part because they are misinformed, and have not looked at Islam through an historical perspective, and are relying on their own misinterpretation of Islam:

In such societies the newly-educated class, the pseudo-intellectuals, who are in the majority, strongly and vigorously welcome this crisis. They themselves even act as one of the forces that strengthen this corrupting and destructive transformation.

Shariati believed that women in Iran under the Shah were only sexually liberated and did not have any social freedom. He attributed this in part to the &quot;rather bourgeois cognition&quot;, and in part to the Freudian ideal of sexual liberation. To Shariati, Freud was one of the agents of the bourgeois:

Up to the appearance of Freud (who was one of the agents of the bourgeoisie), it was through the liberal bourgeois spirit that scientific sexualism was manifested. It must be taken into consideration that the bourgeoisie is always an inferior class.

He concludes that a scholar or scientist who lives, thinks, and studies during the bourgeois age, measures collective, cultural, and spiritual values based on the economy, production and consumption.

===Shariati and socialism===
It seems that his eagerness to explore socialism began with the translation of the book &quot;Abu Zarr: The God-Worshipping Socialist&quot; by the Egyptian thinker Abdul Hamid Jowdat-al-Sahar. According to this book, Abu Dhar was the very first socialist. Then, Shariati&#x27;s father declared that his son believed that the principles of Abu Dhar are fundamental. Even some thinkers described Shariati as the modern-day Abu Dhar in Iran. Of all his thoughts, there is his insistence on the necessity of revolutionary action. Shariati believed that Marxism could not provide the Third World with the ideological means for its own liberation. One of his premises was that Islam by nature is a revolutionary ideology. Therefore, Islam could relate to the modern world as an ideology. According to Shariati, the historical and original origin of human problems was the emergence of private ownership. He believed that in the modern era, the appearance of the machine was the second most fundamental change in the human condition. In fact, private ownership and the emergence of the machine, if considered one of two curves of history, belong to the second period of history. The first period is collective ownership. However, Shariati gave a critique of the historical development of religion and the modern philosophical and ideological movements and their relationship to both private ownership and the emergence of the machine.

====Epistemology====

Shariati developed the idea of the social, cultural and historical contingencies of religious knowledge in sociology. He believed in the earthly religion and in the social context in which the meaning of society is construed. He also emphasized that he understood religion historically because he was a sociologist. He said he was concerned with the historical and social Tawhid, not with the truth of the Quran or of Muhammad or Ali.

==Political philosophy==
In the first place, Shariati criticised western liberal democracy. He pointed out that there is a direct relationship between democracy, liberalism and the plundering of nations. He believed that liberal democracy is the enemy of humankind. He also referred to the fact that the ruling economic system of liberal democracy is unjust and contrary to the rights of people. He maintained that in such a society, someone who is weak is already subjected to defeat and annihilation. There are basic foundations in Shariati&#x27;s thoughts and his criticism of liberal democracy. The first foundation is related to the contrast between the religious worldview and the non-religious one. He explained history, society and humanity according to a monistic worldview. He explained liberalism as something with inequality and discrimination. Freedom and equality based on spirituality were the very basis of pre-modern societies which were devastated in one period of history.

Shariati believed that the government of Imam Ali could be considered the best form of democracy. On this occasion, he tried to interpret the behaviour of Imam Ali in contrast with his enemy. He called this democracy Commitment democracy. It appears that Shariati did not accept the western definition of democracy although he had no problem with democracy. According to him, a religious government is a democratic right of Muslim citizens. He believed that one of the basic problems of western democracy is demagogy. Nowadays the votes of voters are directed to special channels with the help of advertising instruments. In such a condition only one who is critically conscious can dispose of distractions and surface-level arguments, and vote effectively for themselves and their communities. He maintains that the western democracy based on gold, cruelty and tricking (Zar, Zour va Tazvir) is an anti-revolutionary regime that is different from ideological Guidance.

===Commitment to democracy===

For explaining better the commitment to democracy, he at first divides between two concepts. One of them is Syasat and the other is politic. Syasat is a philosophy by which the government would have the responsibility of changing and building the society. In fact, Syasat is a progressive and dynamic thing. The aim of the government in the philosophy of Syasat is to change social foundations, institutions and even all the norms of society (including culture, morality and desires etc.). In simple words, Syasat entails the construction of the people&#x27;s existence. On contrary, there is no construction in politics. In other words, politics follows from the people. Politics does not construct the experience of people. Of course, Shariati prefers Syasat over politics because the former is more progressive. He considers making humanity (Ensan Sazi) important. In fact, his utopia is constructed with three concepts of Gnosis, equality and freedom. Commitment democracy appeared out of his lecture in Hoseyniyeh Ershad; a famous lecture with the name of Ummah and Imamate. According to him, Imam is one who wants to guide humans not only in political, l, social economic dimensions but also in all existential dimensions. He believes that Imam is alive everywhere and every time. On one hand, Imamate is not a metaphysical belief but a revolutionary guide philosophy. He added that Imam has to guide people not according to his desire like a dictator but to Islamic ideology and authentic values.

==Sociology==
Some scholars classify him among the current religious neo-thinkers. According to this standpoint, Shariati accepted the rationality of the West. Shariati called the theoretical foundation of the West as civilization and called its appearances as &quot;Tajadod&quot; [Renewal]. He emphasized accepting civilization and criticised &quot;Tajadod&quot;. He also believed that civilization has to be considered as something deep. He also highly acknowledged the importance of empirical science and knowledge. He appreciated the empirical methodology, and criticised traditionalism for its disregard for scientific methodology. On another hand, he criticised the Modernists because they confuse the Western ideological theories with valid scientific epistemology. According to Shariati, the knowledge of reason is self-evident. Therefore, he suggested thinking of reason as the axiom for understanding the other sources namely the holy book or Quran, ḥadīth (&#x27;tradition&#x27;), sīra (Prophetic biography) and ijmāʿ (consensus). Shariati also dismissed consensus as a source for understanding religion. He insisted on the concepts of knowledge and time along with the holy book and tradition and stressed the important role of methodology and changing of viewpoint.

Shariati, who was a fan of Georges Gurvitch in his analysis of sociology, believed that there was no special pattern for the analysis of social affairs and historical events. He thought that there was no unity of religion and society, but rather there were many religions and societies. He referred to the active role of the scholar of human science during investigation and scientific research. He believed that there was a relationship between the values of scholarship and the effects of those values on the conclusions of an investigation. He believed that it was not necessary to extend the other conclusions of other Western scholars to Iranian society. However, he criticised the Western ideological schools such as nationalism, liberalism, Marxism, etc. He maintained that there was conformity and correspondence between the Western philosophy and Iranian society. According to Shariati, democracy is inconsistent with revolutionary evolution and progress. One of his criticism of Western ideology is its [regardless imitation of those ideologies - check translation]. One of his other criticisms is the denial of spirituality in Western philosophy. In fact, those ideologies attempt to prevent humans from achieving transcendental goals and any [evolutionary movements - check translation]. In this vein, he firmly criticised capitalism, and at the same time, he admired socialism because it would lead humanity to evolution and free it from utilitarianism. However, he firmly criticised Karl Marx. According to Shariati, Karl Marx&#x27;s theory on the economy as the infrastructure and foundation of human and society was strayed. Conversely, Sharia places the human, not the economy, as the foundation and origin of society.

==Modern problems==
According to Shariati, human history is composed of two stages: the stage of collectivity and the stage of private ownership. He explained that the first stage, collectivity, was concerned with social equality and spiritual oneness. But the second stage, which is the current era, could be considered as the domination of the many by one. The second stage began with the emergence of private ownership. The various types of private ownership in history have included slavery, serfdom, feudalism, and capitalism among others. According to the concept of social ownership, all material and spiritual resources are accessible to everyone. But monopoly polarised the human community. In fact, according to Shariati, private ownership is the main cause of all modern problems. These problems change men&#x27;s brotherhood and love to duplicity, deceit, hatred, exploitation, colonisation, and massacre. The polarisation by monopoly manifested itself in different forms throughout history. For example, in ancient times there were slave economies that transferred to capitalist society in modern times. In other words, machinism, or the dependence on machines, can be considered the latest stage of private ownership. Machinism began in the nineteenth century and human beings have had to confront the many anxieties and problems arousing from it.

==Legacy==
There are many adherents and opponents of Shariati&#x27;s views and Shariati&#x27;s personality is largely unknown. Ali Khamenei knew Shariati as a pioneer of Islamic teaching according to the requirements of his generation. According to Sayyed Ali Khamenei, Shariati had both positive and negative characteristics. Khamenei believes that it is unfair to consider Shariati as someone who firmly disagreed with the Mullahs. One of the positive sides of Shariati was his ability to explain his thoughts with suitable and simple language for his generation. Shariati was somewhat supportive of Mullahs in Iran. Some Scholars like Elizabeth F. Thompson try to envisage some similarities between Shariati and his role in the Islamic revolution in Iran with Sayyed Qutb&#x27;s role in Egypt. One similarity is that both of them paved the way for the imminent revolution in Iran and Egypt. Both desired Islamic cultural dominance. Both were fans of being revolutionary about ruling values and norms. They considered Islamism a third way between those of America and the Soviet Union. At the same time, they were not wholly utopian and they were partly Islamic. Of course there are differences between them - Shariati was a leftist while Qutb was a conservative. According to Mahmoud Taleghani, Ali Shariati was a thinker who created a school for revolution. The school guided young people to revolutionary action. Beheshti believes that Shariati&#x27;s work was fundamental to the Islamic revolution.

According to Hamid Enayat, Shariati was not only a theorist but also an adherent of Islamic radicalism. Enayat believes that Shariati can be considered the founder of Islamic socialism. Enayat considers him to be one of the most beloved and popular individuals in Islamic radicalism and socialism.

According to Hamid Algar, Shariati was the number one ideologue of the Islamic revolution.

Despite Shariati&#x27;s early death, he authored some 200 publications including &quot;articles, seminar papers, and lecture series&quot; in addition to more than a hundred books.

<doc id="159184" wikidata="Q310920" url="?curid=159184" title="Edgar Cayce">
<text>Edgar Cayce (; March 18, 1877 – January 3, 1945) was an American clairvoyant who claimed to diagnose diseases and recommend treatments for ailments while asleep. During thousands of transcribed sessions, Cayce would answer questions on a variety of subjects such as healing, reincarnation, dreams, the afterlife, past lives, nutrition, Atlantis, and future events. Cayce described himself as a devout Christian and denied being a Spiritualist or communicating with spirits. Cayce is regarded as a founder and a principal source of many characteristic beliefs of the New Age movement.

As a clairvoyant, Cayce collaborated with a variety of individuals including osteopath Al Layne, homeopath Wesley Ketchum, printer Arthur Lammers, and Wall Street broker Morton Blumenthal. In 1931, Cayce founded a non-profit organization, the Association for Research and Enlightenment.&lt;ref name=&#x27;ARE About/Mission&#x27;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, a popular and highly-sympathetic biography of Cayce titled &quot;There is a River&quot; was published by journalist Thomas Sugrue.

==Background==

Cayce was influenced by a variety of traditions and sources. During the Second Great Awakening, Thomas and Alexander Campbell founded the Disciples of Christ, a church which sought to restore the original Christian teachings and practices.

Mesmerism influenced Phineas Parkhurst Quimby&#x27;s New Thought Movement which promoted the practice of medical clairvoyants. One of Quimby&#x27;s patients, Mary Baker Eddy, later founded her own new religious movement, Christian Science. The Fox sisters&#x27;s Spiritualism influenced Helena Blavatsky, the founder of Theosophy. Blavatksy&#x27;s writings detailed topics like reincarnation, Atlantis, Root races. and the Akashic Records.

Homeopathy and Osteopathy were pseudoscientific forms of alternative medicine prevalent in Cayce&#x27;s lifetime.

==Life==
===Overview===
Edgar Cayce first achieved local notoriety for having lost his voice yet having been able to speak during hypnosis. After initially reporting his voice had spontaneously and inexplicably returned on its own, he later began publicly crediting a local osteopath with having restored his voice. The osteopath began employing Cayce as a medical clairvoyant who could reportedly diagnose patients at a distance through supernatural means. After declaring bankruptcy, Cayce returned to the role of medical clairvoyant, collaborating with homeopath Wesley Ketchum. In 1910, Ketchum&#x27;s description of Cayce&#x27;s readings was covered in a widely reprinted story in the New York Times. When a falling out with Ketchum occurred, Cayce travelled to Selma, Alabama. An additional collaboration with printer Arthur Lammers led Cayce to Dayton, Ohio. The final chapter of his life was spent in Virginia Beach, Virginia, where he oversaw an institute of his own creation.

An October 10, 1922 &quot;Birmingham Post-Herald&quot; article quotes Cayce as saying that he had given 8,056 readings to date. He recorded some 13,000 to 14,000 readings after that date. Other abilities attributed to Cayce include astral projection, prophecy, mediumship, access to the Akashic records, Book of Life, and seeing auras, astrology and dreamwork.

===Early life in Kentucky===
Cayce was born on March 18, 1877, in Christian County, Kentucky. His parents, Carrie Elizabeth (née Major) and Leslie Burr Cayce, were farmers and the parents of six children. Cayce was raised in the Disciples of Christ.

In December 1893, the Cayce family moved to Hopkinsville, Kentucky; they lived at 705 West Seventh, on the southeast corner of Seventh and Young Streets. Cayce received an eighth-grade education. Cayce&#x27;s education ended in ninth grade because his family could not afford the cost.

On March 14, 1897, Cayce became engaged to Gertrude Evans.
In September, papers announced Cayce had taken a position with John P. Morton and left for Louisville. He began an apprenticeship at the photography studio of W. R. Bowles in Hopkinsville, and became proficient in his trade.

===1900 loss of voice===
In February 1900, Hart the Laugh King, a stage hypnotist, performed in Hopkinsville. He would return to Hopkinsville in 1903. Decades later, Hart would be named as having hypnotized Cayce in an attempt to restore his voice.

According to a 1901 newspaper account, on the night of April 18, 1900, Cayce lost his voice and was unable to speak above a whisper. The condition reportedly forced him to leave his job as a salesman for work in photography instead. In May 1900, the local paper reported that Cayce had been unable to speak above a whisper except when under hypnosis, when his voice returned. In June, papers reported Cayce was attending business college in Louisville. On February 12, 1901, papers reported Cayce had awoken with his voice spontaneously and inexplicably recovered.

===Relationship with Al Layne===

The following year, in April 1902, Cayce authored a public endorsement that attributed his cured voice to the treatment of &quot;Osteopath and Electro-Magnetical Doctor&quot; A.C. Layne.

In May 1902, Cayce got a job in a bookshop in Bowling Green, Kentucky. He returned to Hopkinsville to visit his parents in September. The following January, he returned to the town to attend his sister&#x27;s wedding.

Cayce and Gertrude Evans married on June 17, 1903, and she moved to Bowling Green. By June 24, papers published stories of Cayce going into a trance to help osteopath A.C. Lane diagnosis a patient who was not physically present. Cayce denied being a spiritualist, saying he was an active member of the Christian Church. A 1904 article mentioned his refusal to charge for readings. In 1904, Cayce claimed he had developed the card game Pit and sent it to Parker Brothers. 

They had three children: Hugh Lynn Cayce (1907–1982), Milton Porter Cayce (1911–1911), and Edgar Evans Cayce (1918–2013). Layne revealed the activity to the professionals at the boarding house (one of whom was a magistrate and journalist), and the state medical authorities forced him to close his practice. He left to acquire osteopathic qualifications in Franklin. 

Cayce and a relative opened a photographic studio in Bowling Green. On December 25, 1906, a fire burned down the Cayce photo studio. His first son was born on March 16, 1907. Later that year, a second fire burned down his studio. In January 1908, he authored a query to the newspaper about the phase of the moon at a certain time in 1864. In 1908, he declared bankruptcy.

===Relationship with Wesley Ketchum===
Wesley Harrington Ketchum was a homeopath who worked with Cayce from 1910 to 1912. Cayce found work at the H. P. Tresslar photography firm.

In the fall of 1910, Cayce was the subject of increasing publicity for his medical readings.
On October 10, 1910, Cayce was profiled by &quot;The New York Times&quot; in a story titled &quot;Illiterate Man Becomes a Doctor When Hypnotized&quot;.

“The medical fraternity of the country is taking a lively interest in the strange power said to be possessed by Edgar Cayce of Hopkinsville, Ky., to diagnose difficult diseases while in a semi-conscious state, though he has not the slightest knowledge of medicine when not in this condition.

During a visit to California last Summer Dr. W. H. Ketchum, who was attending a meeting of the National Society of Homeopathic Physicians had occasion to mention the young man&#x27;s case and I was invited to discuss it at a banquet attended by about thirty-five of the doctors of the Greek letter fraternity given at Pasadena.

Dr. Ketchum made a speech of considerable length, giving an explanation of the strange psychic powers manifested by Cayce during the last four years during which time he has been more or less under his observation. This talk created such widespread interest among the 700 doctors present that one of the leading Boston medical men who heard his speech invited Dr. Ketchum to prepare a paper as a part of the programme of the September meeting of the American Society of Clinical Research. Dr. Ketchum sent the paper, but did not go to Boston. The paper was read by Henry E. Harpower, M.D., of Chicago, a contributor to the Journal of the American Medical Association, published in Chicago. Its presentation created a sensation, and almost before Dr. Ketchum knew that the paper had been given to the press he was deluged with letters and telegrams inquiring about the strange case. …

Dr. Ketchum wishes it distinctly understood that his presentation is purely ethical, and that he attempts no explanation of what must be classed as a mysterious mental phenomena.

Dr. Ketchum is not the only physician who has had opportunity to observe the workings of Mr. Cayce&#x27;s subconscious mind. For nearly ten years and strange power has been known to local physicians of all the recognized schools. An explanation of the case is best understood from Dr. Ketchum&#x27;s description in his paper read in Boston a few days ago, which follows:

‘About four years ago I made the acquaintance of a young man 28 years old, who had the reputation of being a ‘freak.’ They said he told wonderful truths while he was asleep. I, being interested, immediately began to investigate, and as I was ‘from Missouri,’ I had to be shown.

‘And truly, when it comes to anything psychical, every layman is a disbeliever from the start, and most of our chosen professions will not accept anything of a psychic nature, hypnotism, mesmerism, or what not, unless vouched for by some M.D. away up in the professions and one whose orthodox standing is questioned.

‘By suggestion he becomes unconscious to pain of any sort, and, strange to say, his best work is done when he is seemingly ‘dead to the world.’

‘My subject simply lies down and folds his arms, and by auto-suggestion goes to sleep. While in this sleep, which to all intents and purposes is a natural sleep, his objective mind is completely inactive and only his subjective is working.

‘I next give him the name of my subject and the exact location of the same, and in a few minutes he begins to talk as clearly and distinctly as any one. He usually goes into minute detail in diagnosing a case, and especially if it is a very serious case.

His language is usually of the best, and his psychologic terms and description of the nervous anatomy would do credit to any professor of nervous anatomy, and there is no faltering in his speech and all his statements are clear and concise. He handles the most complex ‘jaw breakers’ with as much ease as any Boston physician, which to me is quite wonderful, in view of the fact that while in his normal state he is an illiterate man, especially along the line of medicine, surgery, or pharmacy, of which he knows nothing.&#x27;”

On October 20, 1910, Hopkinsville papers announced Cayce&#x27;s return to town, with his father handling with the &quot;business end of his hypnotic readings&quot; as part of stock company that had been set up. In November 1910, Cayce&#x27;s photography studio was advertised in the local paper.

In 1911, press accounts told of Layne having cured Cayce by consulting Cayce&#x27;s own reading while under hypnosis.
On January 17, 1911, Cayce and his father gave a public demonstration at a suite in Louisville&#x27;s Seelbach Hotel. In June, a Nashville newspapers advertised Cayce&#x27;s readings.

In 1911, Cayce was briefly mentioned in an encyclopedia. In 1912, Cayce and his father filed suit for $28,000 against A.D. Noe Sr. and Jr. who had been under contract to assist in the medical clairvoyant practice.
On March 28, a second child was born; the baby died on May 17. Gertrude later became ill with tuberculosis. According to Cayce&#x27;s account, in 1912 he discovered that Ketchum had gambled with their money. As a result, Cayce quit the company immediately and returned to the Tresslar photography firm in Selma, Alabama.
In March 1913, papers covered a breach of contract lawsuit involving Cayce&#x27;s business.

===1912–1923: Selma period===
On July 31, 1912, Cayce was elected as an officer of a Sunday School organization in Selma. In February 1915, local papers reported Cayce&#x27;s voice had returned after three months of silence.
On February 8, 1917, an event in New York was held supposedly receiving a telepathic message from Cayce, who was in Alabama. In 1920, Cayce&#x27;s claims were published along with a suggestion that he would soon host Arthur Conan Doyle.

Cayce&#x27;s increasing popularity attracted entrepreneurs who wanted to use his reported clairvoyance. Although he was reluctant to help them, he was persuaded to give readings; this left him dissatisfied with himself. A cotton merchant offered him a hundred dollars a day for readings about the cotton market but, despite his poor finances, Cayce refused the merchant&#x27;s offer. Some people wanted to know where to hunt for treasure, and others wanted to know the outcome of horse races.

From 1920 to 1922, Cayce participated in attempts to use psychic powers to drill oil wells in San Saba, Texas. In May 1921, Texas papers announced plans for the Cayce Petroleum Company to begin drilling about six miles north of San Saba.

In June 1922, Cayce advertised free baby picture day at his studio in Selma. On October 10, 1922, Cayce was profiled about his medical clairvoyance. On October 18, papers reported Cayce had addressed a local writers group, covering topics like reincarnation and evolution of the soul. That month, Cayce addressed the Birmingham Theosophical Society. In November, he gave a talk to a Birmingham women&#x27;s group. A local paper ran a statement by the &quot;friends of Edgar Cayce&quot; mentioning plans for a hospital in Birmingham.

In September 1923 he hired Gladys Davis, who would serve as his secretary for the next two decades, transcribing his readings in shorthand.
By October, he was associated with the &quot;Cayce Institute of Psychic Research&quot;.

===Arthur Lammers and Ohio period===
Arthur Lammers, a wealthy printer and student of metaphysics, persuaded Cayce to give readings on philosophical subjects in 1923. He told Cayce that in his trance state, he spoke about Lammers&#x27; past lives and reincarnation (in which Lammers believed). Reincarnation was a popular contemporary subject, but is not an accepted part of Christian doctrine. Because of this, Cayce questioned his stenographer about what he said in his trance state and remained unconvinced. He challenged Lammers&#x27; statement that he had validated astrology and reincarnation:

:Cayce: I said all that? ... I couldn&#x27;t have said all that in one reading.
:Lammers: No. But you confirmed it. You see, I have been studying metaphysics for years, and I was able by a few questions, by the facts you gave, to check what is right and what is wrong with a whole lot of the stuff I&#x27;ve been reading. The important thing is that the basic system which runs through all the religions, is backed up by you.
Cayce&#x27;s stenographer recorded the following:

:In this we see the plan of development of those individuals set upon this plane, meaning the ability to enter again into the presence of the Creator and become a full part of that creation.
:Insofar as this entity is concerned, this is the third appearance on this plane, and before this one, as the monk. We see glimpses in the life of the entity now as were shown in the monk, in this mode of living. The body is only the vehicle ever of that spirit and soul that waft through all times and ever remain the same.

Cayce was unconvinced that he had been referring to reincarnation, but Lammers believed that the reading &quot;open[ed] up the door&quot; and continued to share his beliefs and knowledge with him. Lammers seemed intent upon convincing Cayce, because he felt that the reading confirmed his own strongly-held beliefs.

Lammers asked Cayce to come to Dayton, Ohio to pursue metaphysical truth via the readings, and Cayce eventually agreed. Cayce produced considerable metaphysical information in Dayton, which he tried to reconcile with Christianity.

Lammers, who wanted to determine the purpose of Cayce&#x27;s clairvoyant readings, wanted to put up money for an organization supporting Cayce&#x27;s healing methods. Cayce decided to accept the work, and asked his family to join him in Dayton as soon as possible. By the time the Cayce family arrived near the end of 1923, however, Lammers was in financial difficulties.

At this time, Cayce directed himself to readings centered around health. The remedies reportedly channeled often involved electrotherapy, ultraviolet light, diet, massage, less mental work and more relaxation. They were noticed by the American Medical Association, and Cayce felt that it was time to legitimize his operations with the aid of licensed medical practitioners. He reported that in a trance in 1925, &quot;the voice&quot; advised him to move to Virginia Beach, Virginia.

===Blumenthal as patron: 1926–1931 ===

By 1925, Cayce was a professional psychic with a small staff of employees and volunteers. Cayce&#x27;s readings increasingly had occult or esoteric themes. Morton Blumenthal (who worked at the New York Stock Exchange with his trader brother) became interested in the readings, shared Cayce&#x27;s outlook, and offered to finance his vision; Blumenthal bought the Cayces a house in Virginia Beach.

The Association of National Investigations was incorporated in Virginia on May 6, 1927. Blumenthal was the president, and his brother and several others were vice presidents. Cayce was secretary and treasurer, and Gladys was assistant secretary. To protect against prosecution, anyone requesting a reading was required to join the association and agree that they were participating in an experiment in psychic research. Moseley Brown, head of the psychology department at Washington and Lee University, became convinced of the readings and joined the association in early 1928.

In August 1928, Dr. Edgar Cayce was listed as bible class teacher affiliated with the local presbyterian church.
On October 11, 1928, the dedication ceremony of the hospital complex was held. The complex contained a lecture hall, library, vault for storage of the readings, and offices for researchers. There was also a large living room, a 12-car garage, servants&#x27; quarters, and a tennis court. It contained &quot;the largest lawn, in fact the only lawn, between the Cavalier and Cape Henry&quot;. Its first patient was admitted the following day.

The facility enabled checking and rechecking the remedies, Cayce&#x27;s goal. There were consistent remedies for many illnesses (regardless of the patient), and Cayce hoped to produce a compendium for use by the medical profession. Shankar A. Bhisey, a chemist who also used &quot;clairvoyant knowledge&quot; to produce medicines, collaborated with Cayce to produce atomidine.

The &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot; for the cures was the &quot;assimilation of needed properties through the digestive system, from food taken into the body ... [All treatments, including all schools and types of treatment, were given in order to establish] the proper equilibrium of the assimilating system.&quot; Salt packs, poultices, hot compresses, chromotherapy, magnetism, vibrator treatment, massage, osteopathic manipulation, dental therapy, colonics, enemas, antiseptics, inhalants, homeopathy, essential oils, and mud baths were prescribed. Substances included oils, salts, herbs, iodine, witch hazel, magnesia, bismuth, alcohol, castoria, lactated pepsin, turpentine, charcoal, animated ash, soda, cream of tartar, aconite, laudanum, camphor, and gold solution. These were prescribed to overcome conditions that prevented proper digestion and assimilation of needed nutrients from the prescribed diet. The aim of the readings was to produce a healthy body, removing the cause of a specific ailment. Readings would indicate if the patient&#x27;s recovery was problematic.

There was a months-long waiting list. Blumenthal and Brown had ambitious plans for a university dwarfing the hospital and a &quot;parallel service for the mind and spirit&quot;, rivaling other universities in respectability. The university was scheduled to open on September 22, 1930. On September 16, Blumenthal called a meeting of the association and took over the hospital to curb expenses. He ended his support of the university after the first semester, and closed the association on February 26, 1931. Cayce removed the files of his readings from the hospital and brought them home.

During the Depression, Cayce turned his attention to spiritual teachings. In 1931, his friends and family asked him how they could become psychic. Out of this apparently-simple question came an eleven-year discourse which led to the creation of &quot;study groups&quot;. In his altered state, Cayce relayed to the groups that the purpose of life is not to become psychic, but to become a more spiritually-aware and loving person. Study group number one was told that they could &quot;bring light to a waiting world&quot;, and the lessons would still be studied in a hundred years. The readings were now about dreams, coincidence (synchronicity), developing intuition, the Akashic records, astrology, past-life relationships, soul mates and other esoteric subjects.

===1931 non-profit (A.R.E) formed ===
On June 6, 1931, 61 people attended a meeting to carry on Cayce&#x27;s work and form the Association for Research and Enlightenment (A.R.E.) In July, the new association was incorporated; Cayce returned his house to Blumenthal, and bought another. In 1931, Cayce promoted a quack medicine formulation called Atomidine or nascent iodine.

People seeking a reading from Cayce were asked to join the A.R.E. This helped insulate Cayce from charges of fortune-telling, which was illegal in some U.S. states, as he was not directly charging a fee for his services but receiving a salary from the member-supported A.R.E. Apart from supporting Cayce and his staff, a major emphasis of the early A.R.E. was the encouragement of small groups devoted to spiritual study, prayer, and meditation.

In November 1931, Cayce, wife Gertrude and secretary Gladys Davis were arrested for &quot;pretending to tell fortunes.&quot; When charges were dismissed, papers noted that Cayce&#x27;s readings included tales of ancient civilizations, including Ancient Egypt, El Dorado, and Atlantis; Cayces&#x27; readings described Bimini island as a mountaintop of Atlantis. In February 1932, Cayce gave a public lecture on the &quot;Lost Continent of Atlantis&quot;.

The association&#x27;s first annual congress was held in June 1932. Speakers discussed metaphysical and psychic subjects, and Cayce performed public readings.

====Earth changes====

From 1932 to 1936, Cayce predicted that the year 1936 would be a year of cataclysmic changes. In February 1933, Cayce predicted that San Francisco would be destroyed by earthquake in 1936. In April 1935, he lectured in the District of Columbia.

In 1935, they were again arrested, this time in Detroit for practicing medicine without a license; Cayce was given probation. 
 In January 1936, Cayce gave a reading predicting the destruction of Los Angeles and San Francisco, followed by New York City. In March 1936, Cayce reported a dream: 
I had been born again in 2100 A.D. in Nebraska. The sea apparently covered all of the western part of the country, as the city where I lived was on the coast. The family name was a strange one. At an early age as a child I declared myself to be Edgar Cayce who had lived 200 years before. Scientists, men with long beads, little hair, and thick glasses, were called in to observe me. They decided to visit the places where I said I had been born, lived, and worked in Kentucky, Alabama, New York, Michigan, and Virginia. Taking me with them the group of scientists visited these places in a long, cigar-shaped metal flying ship which moved at a high speed. Water covered part of Alabama. Norfolk, Virginia, had become an immense seaport. New York had been destroyed either by war or an immense earthquake and was being rebuilt. Industries were scattered over the countryside. Most of the houses were built of glass. Many records of my work as Edgar Cayce were discovered and collected. The group returned to Nebraska, taking the records with them to study... These changes in the earth will come to pass, for the time and times and half times are at an end, and there begins those periods for the readjustments.

====Research library====
Cayce&#x27;s son Hugh Lynn proposed that they develop a library of research into the phenomena and sponsor study groups, with Cayce doing two readings a day. The association accepted this, and Hugh Lynn began publishing a monthly bulletin for association members. The bulletin contained readings on general-interest subjects, interesting cases, book reviews on psychic subjects, health hints from readings, and news about psychic phenomena in other fields.

Hugh Lynn continued to build files of case histories, parallel studies in psychic phenomena, and research readings for the study groups.

Association activities remained simple. Members raised funds for an office, library and vault, which they added to the Cayce residence in 1940–41. Association membership averaged 500 to 600, with the annual turnover about 50 percent. The other half was a solid basis for research, an audience for case studies, pamphlets, and bulletins, including the congress bulletin, which was a yearbook and record of congress events. A mailing list of several thousand served people who remained interested in Cayce&#x27;s activities.
Members were drawn from a wide variety of Christian denominations, theosophy, Christian Science, and Spiritualism. A.R.E. did not oppose any religious organization.
Both sons served in the military during World War II, and both married: Hugh Lynn in 1941, and Edgar Evans in 1942.

===1942 biography===
A 1942 limited edition preceded the first trade edition of the only biography written during Cayce&#x27;s lifetime: Thomas Sugrue&#x27;s &quot;There is a River&quot;, published in March 1943. Interest in Cayce increased.

; Angelic visitation
According to the book, in May 1889, while reading the Bible in his hut in the woods, a young Cayce &#x27;saw&#x27; a woman with wings who told him that his prayers were answered, and asked him what he wanted most of all. He was frightened, but he said that most of all he wanted to help others, especially sick children. He decided he would like to be a missionary.

; Sleep-learning
According to the book, the next night, after a complaint from the school teacher, his father ruthlessly tested him for spelling, eventually knocking him out of his chair with exasperation. At that point, Cayce &#x27;heard&#x27; the voice of the lady who had appeared the day before. She told him that if he could sleep a little &#x27;they&#x27; could help him. He begged for a rest and put his head on the spelling book. When his father came back into the room and woke him up, he knew all the answers. In fact, he could repeat anything in the book. His father thought he had been fooling before and knocked him out of the chair again. Eventually, Cayce used all his school books that way. 
By 1892, the teacher regarded Cayce as his best student. On being questioned, Cayce told the teacher that he saw pictures of the pages in the books. His father became proud of this accomplishment and spread it around, resulting in Cayce becoming &quot;different&quot; from his peers.

; First self-healing
According to the book, shortly after this, Cayce exhibited an ability to diagnose in his sleep. He was struck on the base of the spine by a ball in a school game, after which he began to act very strangely, and eventually was put to bed. He went to sleep and diagnosed the cure, which his family prepared and which cured him as he slept. However, this ability was not demonstrated again for several years.

; Voice restored
According to Sugrue&#x27;s text, local hypnotist Al Layne offered to help Cayce regain his voice. When Layne put Cayce into trance, Cayce communicated vocally. Cayce told Layne to give him (Cayce) a suggestion to increase blood circulation to his throat. Layne gave the suggestion; Cayce&#x27;s throat reportedly turned bright red, and after 20 minutes Cayce (still in a trance) declared the treatment over. On awakening, his voice was said to have remained normal. Relapses occurred, but were reportedly corrected by Layne until the cure was eventually permanent.

Layne asked Cayce to describe Layne&#x27;s ailments and suggest cures, and reportedly found the results accurate and effective. Layne considered Cayce&#x27;s ability clairvoyance, and suggested that he offer his psychic diagnostic service to the public. Cayce was reluctant, since he had no idea what he was prescribing while asleep and did not know if his remedies were safe. He told Layne that he did not want to know anything about a patient, since it was not relevant. He agreed on the condition that readings would be free, and specified that if the readings ever hurt anyone, he would never do another. He began, with Layne&#x27;s help, to offer free treatments to the townspeople. Layne described Cayce&#x27;s method as &quot;...a self-imposed hypnotic trance which induces clairvoyance&quot;. Reports of Cayce&#x27;s work appeared in newspapers, which prompted a number of postal inquiries. Cayce said that he could work as effectively with a letter from an individual as with a person present in the room. Given a person&#x27;s name and location, Cayce claimed that he could diagnose the physical and mental conditions of what he called &quot;the entity&quot; and provide a remedy. Cayce was still reticent and worried, because &quot;one dead patient was all he needed to become a murderer&quot;. His fiancée agreed, and few people knew what he was doing. Hypnotic subjects were commonly believed to be susceptible to insanity or poor physical health.

===Final years===
Cayce attained further national prominence in 1943 after the publication of &quot;Miracle Man of Virginia Beach&quot; in &quot;Coronet&quot; magazine. 

From June 1943 to June 1944, Cayce did 1,385 readings. 

In August 1944, Cayce collapsed. When he took a reading on his situation, he was instructed to rest until he was well or dead. He and Gertrude went to the Virginia mountains, where he had a stroke in September. He died on January 3, 1945, at age 67. Cayce was buried in Riverside Cemetery in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. His wife Gertrude died three months later.

==Legacy==
Gina Cerminara wrote the 1950 book, &quot;Many Mansions&quot;, which explores Cayce&#x27;s work. In 1963, psychic Ruth Montgomery popularized Cayce&#x27;s catastrophic predictions she described as a &#x27;polar shift&#x27;. In 1967, journalist Jess Stearn authored a Cayce biography titled &quot;The Sleeping Prophet&quot;. A book on Cayce and Atlantis was published in 1968. 
In 1968, Curt Gentry&#x27;s novel &quot;The Last Days of the Late, Great State of California&quot; told of a cataclysmic California earthquake that had been foretold by Cayce in 1941.

In 1970, David Kahn&#x27;s work &quot;My Life With Edgar Cayce&quot; was posthumously published. 1970 saw the publication of a book on Cayce&#x27;s readings on the Dead Sea Scrolls. Cayce&#x27;s two sons, Edgar Evans Cayce and Hugh Lynn Cayce, wrote &quot;The Outer Limits of Edgar Cayce&#x27;s Power&quot; in 1971. In 1974, Cayce&#x27;s predictions were cited in a book titled &quot;California Superquake: 1975-77&quot;. In 1978, Cayce&#x27;s followers reported a collaboration with Stanford Research Institute, a psychic research group unaffiliated with Stanford University. In the 1980s, New Age author Lori Toye popularized the &quot;I Am America&quot; map inspired by Cayce&#x27;s prediction of Earth Changes.

==Reception and controversy==

===Pseudohistory===

Cayce advocated pseudohistorical ideas in his trance readings, such as the existence of lost continents Lemuria, Mu and Atlantis and the discredited theory of polygenism. In many trance sessions, he reinterpreted the history of life on earth. One of Cayce&#x27;s controversial theories was polygenism. According to Cayce, five races (white, black, red, brown, and yellow) were created separately and simultaneously on different parts of Earth. He accepted the existence of aliens and Atlantis (saying that &quot;the red race developed in Atlantis and its development was rapid&quot;), and believed that &quot;soul-entities&quot; on Earth intermingled with animals to produce &quot;things&quot; such as giants which were as tall as .
Cayce predicted &quot;Earth Changes&quot;, a series of cataclysmic events including a polar shift that would lead Atlantis to rise from the sea.

In his 2003 book &quot;The Skeptic&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;, philosopher and skeptic Robert Todd Carroll wrote: &quot;Cayce is one of the main people responsible for some of the sillier notions about Atlantis.&quot; Carroll cited some of Cayce&#x27;s discredited ideas, including his belief in a giant crystal (activated by the sun to harness energy and provide power on Atlantis) and his prediction that in 1958, the United States would rediscover a death ray which had been used on Atlantis.

During the 1930s, Cayce incorrectly predicted that North America would experience existential chaos: &quot;Los Angeles, San Francisco ... will be among those that will be destroyed before New York&quot;. He also predicted that the Second Coming of Christ would occur in 1998.

===Clairvoyance===

Science writers and skeptics say that Cayce&#x27;s reported psychic abilities were faked or non-existent.

Evidence of Cayce&#x27;s reported clairvoyance was derived from newspaper articles, affidavits, anecdotes, testimonials and books, rather than empirical evidence which can be independently evaluated. Martin Gardner wrote that the &quot;verified&quot; claims and descriptions from Cayce&#x27;s trances can be traced to ideas in books he had been reading by authors such as Carl Jung, P. D. Ouspensky, and Helena Blavatsky. Gardner concluded that Cayce&#x27;s trance readings contain &quot;little bits of information gleaned from here and there in the occult literature, spiced with occasional novelties from Cayce&#x27;s unconscious&quot;.

Michael Shermer wrote in &quot;Why People Believe Weird Things&quot; (1997), &quot;Uneducated beyond the ninth grade, Cayce acquired his broad knowledge through voracious reading and from this he wove elaborate tales.&quot; According to Shermer, &quot;Cayce was fantasy-prone from his youth, often talking with angels and receiving visions of his dead grandfather.&quot; Magician James Randi said, &quot;Cayce was fond of expressions like &#x27;I feel that&#x27; and &#x27;perhaps&#x27;—qualifying words used to avoid positive declarations.&quot; According to investigator Joe Nickell,

Cayce&#x27;s Association for Research and Enlightenment has also been criticized for promoting pseudoscience.

===Diet===

Health experts are critical of Cayce&#x27;s unorthodox treatments, such as his promotion of pseudoscientific dieting and homeopathic remedies, which they consider quackery. Science writer Karen Stollznow wrote,

Cayce advocated the pseudoscientific ideas of food combining and the alkaline diet. He emphasized maintaining an acid-alkaline balance by eating a diet of 80% alkaline forming foods. He stated that certain foods should not be eaten together for example, milk cannot be consumed with citrus fruits, coffee must not be taken with cream or milk and sugary foods cannot be taken with starchy foods. Cayce also held the view that even nutritious foods can poison the body if the person is in a negative frame of mind.

<text>An apple pie is a pie in which the principal filling is apples. Apple pie is often served with whipped cream, ice cream (&quot;apple pie à la mode&quot;), custard or cheddar cheese. It is generally double-crusted, with pastry both above and below the filling; the upper crust may be solid or latticed (woven of crosswise strips). The bottom crust may be baked separately (&quot;blind&quot;) to prevent it from getting soggy. Tarte Tatin is baked with the crust on top, but served with it on the bottom.

Originating in the 14th century in England, apple pie recipes are now a standard part of cuisines in many countries where apples grow. Apple pies are an unofficial symbol of the United States and one of its signature comfort foods.

==Ingredients==

Apple pie can be made with many different sorts of apples. The more popular cooking apples include Braeburn, Gala, Cortland, Bramley, Empire, Northern Spy, Granny Smith, and McIntosh. The fruit for the pie can be fresh, canned, or reconstituted from dried apples. Dried or preserved apples were originally substituted only at times when fresh fruit was unavailable. The basic ingredients of the filling are sugar, butter, a thickener like cornstarch and an acidic ingredient like lemon juice. Spices are added most commonly cinnamon, nutmeg. and lemon juice which is used to prevent oxidation of the apples when macerating the filling. Many older recipes call for honey in place of the then-expensive sugar.

==Serving==

Apple pie is often served &quot;à la mode&quot;, that is, topped with ice cream.

In another serving style, a piece of sharp cheddar cheese is placed on top of or alongside a slice of the finished pie. Apple pie with cheddar is popular in the American Midwest and New England, particularly in Vermont, where it is considered the state dish. In the north of England, Cheddar or Wensleydale cheese is often used.

==Nutrition==

A commercially prepared apple pie is 52% water, 34% carbohydrates, 2% protein, and 11% fat (table). A 100-gram serving supplies 237 Calories and 13% of the US recommended Daily Value of sodium, with no other micronutrients in significant content (table).

==English style==

The 14th century recipe collection the &quot;Forme of Cury&quot; gives a recipe including &quot;good apples, good spices, figs, raisins and pears&quot; in a , a casing of pastry. Saffron colours the filling.

Lattice pastry styles were found from the 17th century alongside the more traditional dome shaped pie crust. Modern English versions incorporate thick layers of sweetened slices of, usually, Bramley apple; layered into a dome shape to allow for downward shrinkage, and thus avoid a saggy middle; then topped with butter or lard shortcrust pastry; and baked until the apple filling is cooked.

In English-speaking countries, apple pie, often considered a comfort food, is a popular dessert, eaten hot or cold, on its own or with ice cream, double cream, or custard. Apple pies are often sold as mini versions in multipacks.

==Dutch style==
Recipes for Dutch apple pie go back to the Middle Ages. An early Dutch language cookbook from 1514, (&quot;A notable little cookery book&quot;), letterpress printed in Brussels by Thomas van der Noot, who may also have been the author, documents a recipe for (modern Dutch &#x27;apple pies&#x27;). This early recipe was simple, requiring only a standard pie crust, slices of especially soft apples with their skin and seeds removed, and (more of the same dough) on top. It was then baked in a typical Dutch oven. Once baked, the top crust (except at the edges) would be cut out from the middle, after which the apple slices were potentially put through a sieve before the pie was stirred with a wooden spoon. At this point the book recommends adding several spices to the pie, namely: cardamom, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, mace and powdered sugar. Finally, after mixing the ingredients into the pie with cream, it is once again put into the oven to dry.

Traditional Dutch apple pie comes in two varieties, a crumb () and a lattice () style pie. Both recipes are distinct in that they typically call for flavourings of cinnamon and lemon juice to be added and differ in texture, not taste. Dutch apple pies may include ingredients such as full-cream butter, raisins and almond paste, in addition to ingredients such as apples and sugar, which they have in common with other recipes.

The basis of Dutch apple pie is a crust on the bottom and around the edges. This crust is then filled with pieces or slices of apple, usually a crisp and mildly tart variety such as Goudreinet or Elstar. Cinnamon and sugar are generally mixed in with the apple filling. Atop the filling, strands of dough cover the pie in a lattice holding the filling in place but keeping it visible or cover the pie with crumbs. It can be eaten warm or cold, sometimes with a dash of whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. In the US, &quot;Dutch apple pie&quot; refers specifically to the apple pie style with a crumb, streusel, topping.

== French style ==

One kind of French style apple pie is very different compared to the typical version of the sweet dessert. Instead of it being right side up with crust on top and bottom, it actually is upside down, with the fruit being caramelised. This can be made not only with apples but other fruits or vegetables as well, for example, pears or tomatoes.
&quot;See Tarte Tatin.&quot;

Others use a more traditional presentation, including variants like the Norman tart.

==Swedish style==

The Swedish style apple pie is predominantly a variety of apple crumble, rather than a traditional pastry pie. Often, breadcrumbs are used (wholly or partially) instead of flour, and sometimes rolled oats. It is usually flavoured with cinnamon and served with vanilla custard or ice cream. There is also a very popular version called (apple cake), which differs from the pie in that it is a sponge cake baked with fresh apple pieces in it.
==In American culture==

Apple pie was brought to the colonies by the English, the Dutch, and the Swedes during the 17th and 18th centuries. Two recipes for apple pie appear in America&#x27;s first cookbook, &quot;American Cookery&quot; by Amelia Simmons, which was published in 1796.What America&#x27;s First Cookbook Says About Our Country and Its Cuisine

The apple pie had to wait for the planting of European varieties, brought across the Atlantic, to become fruit-bearing apple trees, to be selected for their cooking qualities as there were no native apples except crabapples, which yield very small and sour fruit. In the meantime, the colonists were more likely to make their pies, or &quot;pasties&quot;, from meat, calling them coffins (meaning basket) rather than fruit; and the main use for apples, once they were available, was in cider. However, there are American apple pie recipes, both manuscript and printed, from the 18th century, and it has since become a very popular dessert. Apple varieties are usually propagated by grafting, as clones, but in the New World, planting from seeds was more popular, which quickly led to the development of hundreds of new native varieties.

Apple pie was a common food in 18th-century Delaware. As noted by the New Sweden historian Dr. Israel Acrelius in a letter: &quot;Apple pie is used throughout the whole year, and when fresh Apples are no longer to be had, dried ones are used. It is the evening meal of children.&quot;

The mock apple pie, made from crackers, was probably invented for use aboard ships, as it was known to the British Royal Navy as early as 1812. The earliest known published recipes for mock apple pie date from the antebellum period of the 1850s. In the 1930s, and for many years afterwards, Ritz Crackers promoted a recipe for mock apple pie using its product, along with sugar and various spices.

Apple pie was one of the dishes that Rhode Island army officers ate for their Fourth of July celebrations during the Siege of Petersburg.

Although eaten in Europe since long before the European colonization of the Americas, apple pie as used in the phrase &quot;as American as apple pie&quot; describes something as being &quot;typically American&quot;. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, apple pie became a symbol of American prosperity and national pride. A newspaper article published in 1902 declared that &quot;No pie-eating people can be permanently vanquished.&quot; The dish was also commemorated in the phrase &quot;for Mom and apple pie&quot;—supposedly the stock answer of American soldiers in World War II, whenever journalists asked why they were going to war. Jack Holden and Frances Kay sang in their patriotic 1950 song &quot;The Fiery Bear&quot;, creating contrast between this symbol of U.S. culture and the Russian bear of the Soviet Union:

:We love our baseball and apple pie
:We love our county fair
:We&#x27;ll keep Old Glory waving high
:There&#x27;s no place here for a bear

Advertisers exploited the patriotic connection in the 1970s with the commercial jingle &quot;baseball, hot dogs, apple pie and Chevrolet&quot;.

One out of five Americans surveyed (19%) prefer apple pie over all others, followed by pumpkin (13%)
and pecan (12%).

The unincorporated community of Pie Town, New Mexico, is named after apple pie.

<text>The Arecibo Observatory, also known as the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center (NAIC) and formerly known as the Arecibo Ionosphere Observatory, is an observatory in Barrio Esperanza, Arecibo, Puerto Rico owned by the US National Science Foundation (NSF).

The observatory&#x27;s main instrument was the Arecibo Telescope, a spherical reflector dish built into a natural sinkhole, with a cable-mount steerable receiver and several radar transmitters for emitting signals mounted above the dish. Completed in 1963, it was the world&#x27;s largest single-aperture telescope for 53 years, surpassed in July 2016 by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) in China. On August 10 and November 6, 2020, two of the receiver&#x27;s support cables broke and the NSF announced that it would decommission the telescope. The telescope collapsed on December 1, 2020. In 2022, the NSF announced the telescope will not be rebuilt, with an educational facility to be established on the site.

The observatory also includes a smaller radio telescope, a LIDAR facility, and a visitor center, which remained operational after the telescope&#x27;s collapse. The asteroid 4337 Arecibo is named after the observatory by Steven J. Ostro, in recognition of the observatory&#x27;s contributions to the characterization of Solar System bodies.

==History==

In the 1950s, the United States Department of Defense (DoD)&#x27;s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) was seeking a means to detect missiles in Earth&#x27;s ionosphere. On November 6, 1959, Cornell University entered into a contract with ARPA to carry out development studies for a large-scale ionospheric radar probe. The Arecibo Telescope was consequently built to study the ionosphere as well as to serve as a general-purpose radio telescope. Construction of the telescope was started in September 1960. The telescope and supporting observatory were formally opened as the Arecibo Ionospheric Observatory on November 1, 1963.

DoD transferred the observatory to the National Science Foundation on October 1, 1969. NSF appointed Cornell University to manage the observatory. By September 1971, NSF had renamed the observatory the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center (NAIC) and had made it a federally funded research and development center (FFRDC). NASA began contributing funds to the observatory alongside NSF for its planetary radar mission.

In the early 2000s, NASA eliminated funding for the Arecibo Observatory. In 2006, NSF indicated that it would reduce funding for the observatory, and decommission it if other funding could not be found. Academics and politicians lobbied to stave off its closure, and NASA recommitted funding in 2011 for study of near-earth objects. In 2011, NSF delisted Arecibo as an FFRDC, which allowed the observatory to seek funding from a wider variety of sources; the agency also replaced Cornell as the site operator with a team led by SRI International.

Damage to the telescope by 2017&#x27;s Hurricane Maria led NSF again to suggest closing the observatory. A consortium led by the University of Central Florida (UCF) proposed to manage the observatory and cover much of the operations and maintenance costs, and in 2018, NSF made UCF&#x27;s consortium the new site operators, though no specific actions or funding were announced.

On August 6, 2020, an auxiliary cable broke on the telescope, followed by a main cable on November 7. The NSF announced that they would decommission the telescope through controlled demolition, but that the other facilities on the observatory would remain operational. Before demolition could occur, remaining support cables from one tower rapidly failed in the morning of December 1, 2020, causing the instrument platform to crash through the dish, shearing off the tops of the support towers, and partially damaging some of the other buildings, though with no injuries. NSF officials said in 2020 that they aimed to have the other observatory facilities operational as soon as possible and were considering rebuilding a new telescope instrument in its place. However, in 2022, the NSF announced the telescope will not be rebuilt but an educational facility would be established on the site. The following year, NSF picked a consortium of universitiesCold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York; the University of Maryland, Baltimore County; the University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras Campus in San Juan; and the University of the Sacred Heart, also in San Juanto set up and run an education center called Arecibo C3 (Arecibo Center for Culturally Relevant and Inclusive Science Education, Computational Skills, and Community Engagement).

==Facilities==
===Arecibo Telescope===

The observatory&#x27;s main feature was its large radio telescope, whose main collecting dish was an inverted spherical dome in diameter with an radius of curvature, constructed inside a karst sinkhole. The dish&#x27;s surface was made of 38,778 perforated aluminum panels, each about , supported by a mesh of steel cables. The ground beneath supported shade-tolerant vegetation.

Since its completion in November 1963, the Telescope had been used for radar astronomy and radio astronomy, and had been part of the Search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) program. It was also used by NASA for Near-Earth object detection. Since around 2006, NSF funding support for the telescope had waned as the Foundation directed funds to newer instruments, though academics petitioned to the NSF and Congress to continue support for the telescope. Numerous hurricanes, including Hurricane Maria, had damaged parts of the telescope, straining the reduced budget.

Two cable breaks, one in August 2020 and a second in November 2020, threatened the structural integrity of the support structure for the suspended platform and damaged the dish. The NSF determined in November 2020 that it was safer to decommission the telescope rather than to try to repair it, but the telescope collapsed before a controlled demolition could be carried out. The remaining support cables from one tower failed around 7:56 a.m. local time on December 1, 2020, causing the receiver platform to fall into the dish and collapsing the telescope.

NASA led an extensive failure investigation and reported the findings, along with a technical bulletin with industry recommendations. The investigation concluded that &quot;a combination of low socket design margin and a high percentage of sustained loading revealed an unexpected vulnerability to zinc creep and environments, resulting in long-term cumulative damage and progressive zinc/wire failure&quot;.

===Additional telescopes===
The Arecibo Observatory also has other facilities beyond the main telescope, including a radio telescope intended for very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) with the main telescope; and a LIDAR facility whose research has continued since the main telescope&#x27;s collapse.

=== Ángel Ramos Foundation Visitor Center ===
Opened in 1997, the Ángel Ramos Foundation Visitor Center features interactive exhibits and displays about the operations of the radio telescope, astronomy and atmospheric sciences. The center is named after the financial foundation that honors Ángel Ramos, owner of the &quot;El Mundo&quot; newspaper and founder of Telemundo. The Foundation provided half of the funds to build the Visitor Center, with the remainder received from private donations and Cornell University.

The center, in collaboration with the Caribbean Astronomical Society, hosts a series of Astronomical Nights throughout the year, which feature diverse discussions regarding exoplanets, astronomical phenomena, and discoveries (such as Comet ISON). The purposes of the center are to increase public interest in astronomy, the observatory&#x27;s research successes, and space endeavors.

<doc id="159203" wikidata="Q154255" url="?curid=159203" title="Munich Agreement">
<text>The Munich Agreement was an agreement reached in Munich on 30 September 1938, by Nazi Germany, the United Kingdom, the French Republic, and Fascist Italy. The agreement provided for the German annexation of part of Czechoslovakia called the Sudetenland, where more than three million people, mainly ethnic Germans, lived. The pact is also known in some areas as the Munich Betrayal (; ), because of a previous 1924 alliance agreement and a 1925 military pact between France and the Czechoslovak Republic.

Germany had started a low-intensity undeclared war on Czechoslovakia on 17 September 1938. In reaction, Britain and France on 20 September formally requested Czechoslovakia cede the Sudetenland territory to Germany. This was followed by Polish and Hungarian territorial demands brought on 21 and 22 September, respectively. Meanwhile, German forces conquered parts of the Cheb District and Jeseník District, where local battles included use of German artillery, Czechoslovak tanks, and armored vehicles. Lightly armed German infantry briefly overran other border counties before being repelled. Poland also grouped its army units near its common border with Czechoslovakia and conducted an unsuccessful probing offensive on 23 September. Hungary moved its troops towards the border with Czechoslovakia, without attacking. The Soviet Union announced its willingness to come to Czechoslovakia&#x27;s assistance, provided that the Red Army would be able to cross Polish and Romanian territory. Both countries refused to allow the Soviet army to use their territories.

An emergency meeting of the main European powers–not including Czechoslovakia, although their representatives were present in the town, or the Soviet Union, an ally to both France and Czechoslovakia–took place in Munich, Germany, on 29–30 September 1938. An agreement was quickly reached on Hitler&#x27;s terms, and signed by the leaders of Germany, France, Britain, and Italy. The Czechoslovak mountainous borderland marked a natural border between the Czech state and the Germanic states since the early Middle Ages; it also presented a major natural obstacle to a possible German attack. Strengthened by significant border fortifications, the Sudetenland was of absolute strategic importance to Czechoslovakia.

On 30 September, Czechoslovakia submitted to the combination of military pressure by Germany, Poland, and Hungary, and diplomatic pressure by Britain and France, and agreed to surrender territory to Germany following the Munich terms.

The Munich Agreement was soon followed by the First Vienna Award on 2 November 1938, separating largely Hungarian inhabited territories in southern Slovakia and southern Subcarpathian Rus&#x27; from Czechoslovakia. On 30 November 1938, Czechoslovakia ceded to Poland small patches of land in the Spiš and Orava regions.

In March 1939, the First Slovak Republic, a German puppet state, proclaimed its independence. Shortly afterwards, Hitler reneged on his promises to respect the integrity of Czechoslovakia by occupying the remainder of the country and creating the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. The conquered nation&#x27;s significant military arsenal played an important role in Germany&#x27;s invasions of Poland and France in 1939 and 1940.

Much of Europe celebrated the Munich Agreement, as they considered it a way to prevent a major war on the continent. Adolf Hitler announced that it was his last territorial claim in Northern Europe. Today, the Munich Agreement is widely regarded as a failed act of appeasement, and the term has become &quot;a byword for the futility of appeasing expansionist totalitarian states.&quot;

==History==

===Background===

====Demands for autonomy====


The First Czechoslovak Republic was created in 1918 following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the end of World War I. The Treaty of Saint-Germain recognized the independence of Czechoslovakia and the Treaty of Trianon defined the borders of the new state, which was divided in to the regions of Bohemia and Moravia in the west and Slovakia and Subcarpathian Rus&#x27; in the east, including more than three million Germans, 22.95% of the total population of the country. They lived mostly in border regions of the historical Czech Lands for which they coined the new name Sudetenland, which bordered on Germany and the newly created country of Austria.

The Sudeten Germans were not consulted on whether they wished to be citizens of Czechoslovakia. Although the constitution guaranteed equality for all citizens, there was a tendency among political leaders to transform the country &quot;into an instrument of Czech and Slovak nationalism.&quot; Some progress was made to integrate the Germans and other minorities, but they continued to be underrepresented in the government and the army. Moreover, the Great Depression beginning in 1929 impacted the highly industrialized and export-oriented Sudeten Germans more than it did the Czech and Slovak populations. By 1936, 60 percent of the unemployed people in Czechoslovakia were Germans.

In 1933, Sudeten German leader Konrad Henlein founded the Sudeten German Party (SdP), which was &quot;militant, populist, and openly hostile&quot; to the Czechoslovak government. It soon captured two-thirds of the vote in districts with a heavy German population. Historians differ as to whether the SdP was a Nazi front organisation from its beginning, or if it evolved into one. By 1935, the SdP was the second-largest political party in Czechoslovakia as German votes concentrated on this party, and Czech and Slovak votes were spread among several parties.

Shortly after the &quot;Anschluss&quot; of Austria to Germany, Henlein met with Hitler in Berlin on 28 March 1938, and was instructed to make demands unacceptable to the democratic Czechoslovak government, led by President Edvard Beneš. On 24 April, the SdP issued a series of demands known as the Karlsbader Programm. Henlein demanded autonomy for Germans in Czechoslovakia. The Czechoslovak government responded by saying that it was willing to provide more minority rights to the German minority but was initially reluctant to grant autonomy. The SdP gained 88% of the ethnic German votes in May 1938.

With tension high between the Germans and the Czechoslovak government, Beneš, on 15 September 1938, secretly offered to give of Czechoslovakia to Germany, in exchange for a German agreement to admit 1.5 to 2.0 million Sudeten Germans expelled by Czechoslovakia. Hitler did not reply.

====Sudeten crisis====

As the previous appeasement of Hitler had shown, France and Britain were intent on avoiding war. The French government did not wish to face Germany alone and took its lead from British Conservative government of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. He considered the Sudeten German grievances justified and believed Hitler&#x27;s intentions to be limited. Both Britain and France, therefore, advised Czechoslovakia to accede to Germany&#x27;s demands. Beneš resisted and, on 19 May, initiated a partial mobilization in response to a possible German invasion.

On 20 May, Hitler presented his generals with a draft plan of attack on Czechoslovakia that was codenamed Operation Green. He insisted that he would not &quot;smash Czechoslovakia&quot; militarily without &quot;provocation&quot;, &quot;a particularly favourable opportunity&quot; or &quot;adequate political justification.&quot; On 28 May, Hitler called a meeting of his service chiefs, ordered an acceleration of U-boat construction and brought forward the construction of his new battleships, &quot;Bismarck&quot; and &quot;Tirpitz,&quot; to spring 1940. He demanded that the increase in the firepower of the battleships &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; be accelerated. While recognizing that this would still be insufficient for a full-scale naval war with Britain, Hitler hoped it would be a sufficient deterrent. Ten days later, Hitler signed a secret directive for war against Czechoslovakia to begin no later than 1 October.

On 22 May, Juliusz Łukasiewicz, the Polish ambassador to France, told French Foreign Minister Georges Bonnet that if France moved against Germany to defend Czechoslovakia, &quot;We shall not move.&quot; Łukasiewicz also told Bonnet that Poland would oppose any attempt by Soviet forces to defend Czechoslovakia from Germany. Édouard Daladier told Jakob Suritz, the Soviet ambassador to France, &quot;Not only can we not count on Polish support but we have no faith that Poland will not strike us in the back.&quot; However, the Polish government indicated multiple times (in March 1936 and May, June and August 1938) that it was prepared to fight Germany if the French decided to help Czechoslovakia: &quot;Beck&#x27;s proposal to Bonnet, his statements to Ambassador Drexel Biddle, and the statement noted by Vansittart, show that the Polish foreign minister was, indeed, prepared to carry out a radical change of policy if the Western powers decided on war with Germany. However, these proposals and statements did not elicit any reaction from British and French governments that were bent on averting war by appeasing Germany.&quot;
Hitler&#x27;s adjutant, Fritz Wiedemann, recalled after the war that he was &quot;very shocked&quot; by Hitler&#x27;s new plans to attack Britain and France three to four years after &quot;deal[ing] with the situation&quot; in Czechoslovakia. General Ludwig Beck, chief of the German general staff, noted that Hitler&#x27;s change of heart in favour of quick action was because Czechoslovak defences were still being improvised, which would no longer be the case two to three years later, and British rearmament would not come into effect until 1941 or 1942. General Alfred Jodl noted in his diary that the partial Czechoslovak mobilization of 21 May had led Hitler to issue a new order for Operation Green on 30 May and that it was accompanied by a covering letter from Wilhelm Keitel that stated that the plan must be implemented by 1 October at the very latest.

In the meantime, the British government demanded that Beneš request a mediator. Not wishing to sever his government&#x27;s ties with Western Europe, Beneš reluctantly accepted. The British appointed Lord Runciman, a former Liberal cabinet minister, who arrived in Prague on 3 August with instructions to persuade Beneš to agree to a plan acceptable to the Sudeten Germans. On 20 July, Bonnet told the Czechoslovak ambassador in Paris that while France would declare its support in public to help the Czechoslovak negotiations, it was not prepared to go to war over Sudetenland. In August, the German press was full of stories alleging Czechoslovak atrocities against Sudeten Germans, with the intention of forcing the West into putting pressure on the Czechoslovaks to make concessions. Hitler hoped that the Czechoslovaks would refuse and that the West would then feel morally justified in leaving the Czechoslovaks to their fate. In August, Germany sent 750,000 soldiers along the border of Czechoslovakia, officially as part of army maneuvres. On 4 or 5 September, Beneš submitted the Fourth Plan, granting nearly all the demands of the agreement. The Sudeten Germans were under instruction from Hitler to avoid a compromise, and the SdP held demonstrations that provoked a police action in Ostrava on 7 September, in which two of their parliamentary deputies were arrested. The Sudeten Germans used the incident and false allegations of other atrocities as an excuse to break off further negotiations.
On 12 September, Hitler made a speech at a Nazi Party rally in Nuremberg on the Sudeten crisis condemning the actions of the government of Czechoslovakia. Hitler denounced Czechoslovakia as being a fraudulent state that was in violation of international law&#x27;s emphasis of national self-determination, claiming it was a Czech hegemony although the Germans, the Slovaks, the Hungarians, the Ukrainians and the Poles of the country actually wanted to be in a union with the Czechs. Hitler accused Beneš of seeking to gradually exterminate the Sudeten Germans and claimed that since Czechoslovakia&#x27;s creation, over 600,000 Germans had been intentionally forced out of their homes under the threat of starvation if they did not leave. He alleged that Beneš&#x27;s government was persecuting Germans along with Hungarians, Poles, and Slovaks and accused Beneš of threatening the nationalities with being branded traitors if they were not loyal to the country. He stated that he, as the head of state of Germany, would support the right of the self-determination of fellow Germans in the Sudetenland. He condemned Beneš for his government&#x27;s recent execution of several German protesters. He accused Beneš of being belligerent and threatening behaviour towards Germany which, if war broke out, would result in Beneš forcing Sudeten Germans to fight against their will against Germans from Germany. Hitler accused the government of Czechoslovakia of being a client regime of France, claiming that the French Minister of Aviation Pierre Cot had said, &quot;We need this state as a base from which to drop bombs with greater ease to destroy Germany&#x27;s economy and its industry.&quot;

===Berchtesgaden meeting===

On 13 September, after internal violence and disruption in Czechoslovakia ensued, Chamberlain asked Hitler for a personal meeting to find a solution to avert a war. Chamberlain decided to do this after conferring with his advisors Lord Halifax, Sir John Simon, and Sir Samuel Hoare. The meeting was announced at a special press briefing at 10 Downing Street, and led to a swell of optimism in British public opinion. Chamberlain arrived by a chartered British Airways Lockheed Electra in Germany on 15 September and then arrived at Hitler&#x27;s residence in Berchtesgaden for the meeting. The flight was one of the first times a head of state or diplomatic official flew to a diplomatic meeting in an airplane, as the tense situation left little time to take a train or boat. Henlein flew to Germany on the same day. That day, Hitler and Chamberlain held discussions in which Hitler insisted that the Sudeten Germans must be allowed to exercise the right of national self-determination and be able to join Sudetenland with Germany. Hitler repeatedly falsely claimed that the Czechoslovak government had killed 300 Sudeten Germans. Hitler also expressed concern to Chamberlain about what he perceived as British &quot;threats.&quot; Chamberlain responded that he had not issued &quot;threats&quot; and in frustration asked Hitler &quot;Why did I come over here to waste my time?&quot; Hitler responded that if Chamberlain was willing to accept the self-determination of the Sudeten Germans, he would be willing to discuss the matter. Hitler also convinced Chamberlain that he did not truly wish to destroy Czechoslovakia, but that he believed that upon a German annexation of the Sudetenland the country&#x27;s minorities would each secede and cause the country to collapse. Chamberlain and Hitler held discussions for three hours, and the meeting adjourned. Chamberlain flew back to Britain and met with his cabinet to discuss the issue.

After the meeting, Daladier flew to London on 16 September to meet with British officials to discuss a course of action. The situation in Czechoslovakia became tenser that day, with the Czechoslovak government issuing an arrest warrant for Henlein, who had arrived in Germany a day earlier to take part in the negotiations. The French proposals ranged from waging war against Germany to supporting the Sudetenland being ceded to Germany. The discussions ended with a firm British-French plan in place. Britain and France demanded that Czechoslovakia cede to Germany all territories in which the German population represented over 50% of the Sudetenland&#x27;s total population. In exchange for that concession, Britain and France would guarantee the independence of Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia rejected the proposed solution.

On 17 September 1938 Hitler ordered the establishment of &quot;Sudetendeutsches Freikorps&quot;, a paramilitary organization that took over the structure of Ordnersgruppe, an organization of ethnic Germans in Czechoslovakia that had been dissolved by the Czechoslovak authorities the previous day due to its implication in a large number of terrorist activities. The organization was sheltered, trained and equipped by German authorities and conducted cross-border terrorist operations into Czechoslovak territory. Relying on the Convention for the Definition of Aggression, Czechoslovak president Edvard Beneš and the government-in-exile later regarded 17 September 1938 as the beginning of the undeclared German-Czechoslovak war. This understanding has been assumed also by the contemporary Czech Constitutional court. In the following days, Czechoslovak forces suffered over 100 personnel killed in action, hundreds wounded and over 2,000 abducted to Germany.

On 18 September, Italy&#x27;s &quot;Duce&quot; Benito Mussolini made a speech in Trieste, Italy, where he declared &quot;If there are two camps, for and against Prague, let it be known that Italy has chosen its side&quot;, with the clear implication being that Mussolini supported Germany in the crisis.

On 20 September, German opponents within the military met to discuss the final plans of a plot they had developed to overthrow the Nazi regime. The meeting was led by General Hans Oster, the deputy head of the &quot;Abwehr&quot; (Germany&#x27;s counter-espionage agency). Other members included Captain , and other military officers leading the planned coup d&#x27;etat met at the meeting. On 22 September, Chamberlain, about to board his plane to go to Germany for further talks at Bad Godesberg, told the press who met him there that &quot;My objective is peace in Europe, I trust this trip is the way to that peace.&quot; Chamberlain arrived in Cologne, where he received a lavish grand welcome with a German band playing &quot;God Save the King&quot; and Germans giving Chamberlain flowers and gifts. Chamberlain had calculated that fully accepting German annexation of all of the Sudetenland with no reductions would force Hitler to accept the agreement. Upon being told of this, Hitler responded &quot;Does this mean that the Allies have agreed with Prague&#x27;s approval to the transfer of the Sudetenland to Germany?&quot;, Chamberlain responded &quot;Precisely&quot;, to which Hitler responded by shaking his head, saying that the Allied offer was insufficient. He told Chamberlain that he wanted Czechoslovakia to be completely dissolved and its territories redistributed to Germany, Poland, and Hungary, and told Chamberlain to take it or leave it. Chamberlain was shaken by this statement. Hitler went on to tell Chamberlain that since their last meeting on the 15th, Czechoslovakia&#x27;s actions, which Hitler claimed included killings of Germans, had made the situation unbearable for Germany.

Later in the meeting, a deception was undertaken to influence and put pressure on Chamberlain: one of Hitler&#x27;s aides entered the room to inform Hitler of more Germans being killed in Czechoslovakia, to which Hitler screamed in response &quot;I will avenge every one of them. The Czechs must be destroyed.&quot; The meeting ended with Hitler refusing to make any concessions to the Allies&#x27; demands. Later that evening, Hitler grew worried that he had gone too far in pressuring Chamberlain, and telephoned Chamberlain&#x27;s hotel suite, saying that he would accept annexing only the Sudetenland, with no designs on other territories, provided that Czechoslovakia begin the evacuation of ethnic Czechs from the German majority territories by 26 September at 8:00am. After being pressed by Chamberlain, Hitler agreed to have the ultimatum set for 1 October (the same date that Operation Green was set to begin). Hitler then said to Chamberlain that this was one concession that he was willing to make to the Prime Minister as a &quot;gift&quot; out of respect for the fact that Chamberlain had been willing to back down somewhat on his earlier position. Hitler went on to say that upon annexing the Sudetenland, Germany would hold no further territorial claims upon Czechoslovakia and would enter into a collective agreement to guarantee the borders of Germany and Czechoslovakia.

A new Czechoslovak cabinet, under General Jan Syrový, was installed and on 23 September a decree of general mobilization was issued which was accepted by the public with a strong enthusiasm – within 24 hours, one million men joined the army to defend the country. The Czechoslovak Army, modern, experienced and possessing an excellent system of frontier fortifications, was prepared to fight. The Soviet Union announced its willingness to come to Czechoslovakia&#x27;s assistance, provided that the Red Army would be able to cross Polish and Romanian territory. Both countries refused to allow the Soviet army to use their territories.

In the early hours of 24 September, Hitler issued the Godesberg Memorandum, which demanded that Czechoslovakia cede the Sudetenland to Germany no later than 28 September, with plebiscites to be held in unspecified areas under the supervision of German and Czechoslovak forces. The memorandum also stated that if Czechoslovakia did not agree to the German demands by 2 pm on 28 September, Germany would take the Sudetenland by force. On the same day, Chamberlain returned to Britain and announced that Hitler demanded the annexation of the Sudetenland without delay. The announcement enraged those in Britain and France who wanted to confront Hitler once and for all, even if it meant war, and its supporters gained strength. The Czechoslovak Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Jan Masaryk, was elated upon hearing of the support for Czechoslovakia from British and French opponents of Hitler&#x27;s plans, saying &quot;The nation of Saint Wenceslas will never be a nation of slaves.&quot;
On 25 September, Czechoslovakia agreed to the conditions previously agreed upon by Britain, France, and Germany. The next day, however, Hitler added new demands, insisting that the claims of ethnic Germans in Poland and Hungary also be satisfied.

On 26 September, Chamberlain sent Sir Horace Wilson to carry a personal letter to Hitler declaring that the Allies wanted a peaceful resolution to the Sudeten crisis. Later that evening, Hitler made his response in a speech at the Berlin Sportpalast; he claimed that the Sudetenland was &quot;the last territorial demand I have to make in Europe&quot; and gave Czechoslovakia a deadline of 28 September at 2:00 pm to cede the Sudetenland to Germany or face war. At this point the British government began to make war preparations, and the House of Commons was reconvened from a parliamentary recess.

On 27 September 1938, when negotiations between Hitler and Chamberlain were strained, Chamberlain addressed the British people, saying, in particular: &quot;How horrible, fantastic, incredible it is that we should be digging trenches and trying on gas masks here because of a quarrel in a far-away country between people of whom we know nothing.&quot;

On 28 September at 10:00 am, four hours before the deadline and with no agreement to Hitler&#x27;s demand by Czechoslovakia, the British ambassador to Italy, Lord Perth, called Italy&#x27;s Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano to request an urgent meeting. Perth informed Ciano that Chamberlain had instructed him to request that Mussolini enter the negotiations and urge Hitler to delay the ultimatum. At 11:00 am, Ciano met Mussolini and informed him of Chamberlain&#x27;s proposition; Mussolini agreed with it and responded by telephoning Italy&#x27;s ambassador to Germany and told him &quot;Go to the Fuhrer at once, and tell him that whatever happens, I will be at his side, but that I request a twenty-four-hour delay before hostilities begin. In the meantime, I will study what can be done to solve the problem.&quot; Hitler received Mussolini&#x27;s message while in discussions with the French ambassador. Hitler responded &quot;My good friend, Benito Mussolini, has asked me to delay for twenty-four hours the marching orders of the German army, and I agreed.&quot; Of course, this was no concession, as the invasion date was set for 1 October 1938. Upon speaking with Chamberlain, Lord Perth gave Chamberlain&#x27;s thanks to Mussolini as well as Chamberlain&#x27;s request that Mussolini attend a four-power conference of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy in Munich on 29 September to settle the Sudeten problem prior to the deadline of 2:00 pm. Mussolini agreed. Hitler&#x27;s only request was to make sure that Mussolini be involved in the negotiations at the conference. Nevile Henderson, Alexander Cadogan, and Chamberlain&#x27;s personal secretary Lord Dunglass passed the news of the conference to Chamberlain while he was addressing Parliament, and Chamberlain suddenly announced the conference and his acceptance to attend at the end of the speech to cheers. When United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt learned the conference had been scheduled, he telegraphed Chamberlain, &quot;Good man.&quot;

===Resolution===


Discussions began at the Führerbau immediately after Chamberlain and Daladier arrived, giving them little time to consult. The meeting was held in English, French, and German. A deal was reached on 29 September, and at about 1:30 a.m. on 30 September 1938, Adolf Hitler, Neville Chamberlain, Benito Mussolini and Édouard Daladier signed the Munich Agreement. The agreement was officially introduced by Mussolini although in fact the Italian plan was nearly identical to the Godesberg proposal: the German army was to complete the occupation of the Sudetenland by 10 October, and an international commission would decide the future of other disputed areas.

Czechoslovakia was informed by Britain and France that it could either resist Nazi Germany alone or submit to the prescribed annexations. The Czechoslovak government, realizing the hopelessness of fighting the Nazis alone, reluctantly capitulated (30 September) and agreed to abide by the agreement. The settlement gave Germany the Sudetenland starting 10 October, and &quot;de facto&quot; control over the rest of Czechoslovakia as long as Hitler promised to go no further. On 30 September after some rest, Chamberlain went to Hitler&#x27;s apartment in the Prinzregentenstraße and asked him to sign a statement calling the Anglo-German Naval Agreement &quot;symbolic of the desire of our two countries never to go to war with one another again.&quot; After Hitler&#x27;s interpreter translated it for him, he happily agreed.

On 30 September, upon his return to Britain, Chamberlain delivered his controversial &quot;peace for our time&quot; speech to crowds in London.

===Reactions===

==== Immediate response ====

===== Czechoslovakia =====
The Czechoslovaks were dismayed with the Munich settlement. They were not invited to the conference and felt they had been betrayed by the British and French governments. Many Czechs and Slovaks refer to the Munich Agreement as the Munich Diktat (; ). The phrase &quot;Munich Betrayal&quot; (; ) is also used because the military alliance Czechoslovakia had with France proved useless. This was also reflected by the fact that especially the French government had expressed the view that Czechoslovakia would be considered as being responsible for any resulting European war should the Czechoslovak Republic defend herself with force against German incursions.

The slogan &quot;About us, without us!&quot; (; ) summarizes the feelings of the people of Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia and the Czech Republic) towards the agreement. With Sudetenland gone to Germany, Czecho-Slovakia (as the state was now renamed) lost its defensible border with Germany and the Czechoslovak border fortifications. Without them its independence became more nominal than real. Czechoslovakia also lost 70 per cent of its iron/steel industry, 70 per cent of its electrical power and 3.5 million citizens to Germany as a result of the settlement. The Sudeten Germans celebrated what they saw as their liberation. The imminent war, it seemed, had been avoided.

The Nobel laureate, Thomas Mann, took to pen and pulpit in defense of his surrogate homeland proclaiming his pride at being a Czechoslovak citizen and praising the republic&#x27;s achievements. He attacked a &quot;Europe ready for slavery&quot; writing that &quot;The Czechoslovak people is ready to take up a fight for liberty and transcends its own fate&quot; and &quot;It is too late for the British government to save the peace. They have lost too many opportunities.&quot; President Beneš of Czechoslovakia was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize in 1939.

===== Germany =====
Though the British and French were pleased, a British diplomat in Berlin claimed he had been informed by a member of Hitler&#x27;s entourage that soon after the meeting with Chamberlain, Hitler had furiously said: &quot;Gentlemen, this has been my first international conference and I can assure you that it will be my last.&quot; On another occasion, he had been heard saying of Chamberlain: &quot;If ever that silly old man comes interfering here again with his umbrella, I&#x27;ll kick him downstairs and jump on his stomach in front of the photographers.&quot; In one of his public speeches after Munich, Hitler declared: &quot;Thank God we have no umbrella politicians in this country.&quot;

Hitler felt cheated of the limited war against the Czechs which he had been aiming for all summer. In early October, Chamberlain&#x27;s press secretary asked for a public declaration of German friendship with Britain to strengthen Chamberlain&#x27;s domestic position; Hitler instead delivered speeches denouncing Chamberlain&#x27;s &quot;governessy interference.&quot; In August 1939, shortly before the invasion of Poland, Hitler told his generals: &quot;Our enemies are men below average, not men of action, not masters. They are little worms. I saw them at Munich.&quot;

Before the Munich Agreement, Hitler&#x27;s determination to invade Czechoslovakia on 1 October 1938 had provoked a major crisis in the German command structure. The Chief of the General Staff, General Ludwig Beck, protested in a lengthy series of memos that it would start a world war that Germany would lose, and urged Hitler to put off the projected conflict. Hitler called Beck&#x27;s arguments against war &quot;kindische Kräfteberechnungen&quot; (&quot;childish force calculations&quot;). On 4 August 1938, a secret Army meeting was held. Beck read his lengthy report to the assembled officers. They all agreed something had to be done to prevent certain disaster. Beck hoped they would all resign together but no one resigned except Beck. His replacement, General Franz Halder, sympathized with Beck and they were both recruited into Hans Oster&#x27;s September Conspiracy which planned to arrest Hitler the moment he gave the invasion order. 

This plan would only work if Britain issued a strong warning and a letter to the effect that they would fight to preserve Czechoslovakia. This would help to convince the German people that certain defeat awaited Germany. Agents were therefore sent to England to tell Chamberlain that an attack on Czechoslovakia was planned, and of their intention to overthrow Hitler if this occurred. The proposal was rejected by the British Cabinet and no such letter was issued. Accordingly, the proposed removal of Hitler did not go ahead.

On 7 October 1938, Hitler visited the Sudeten territories. He arrived by train in Neustadt (now Prudnik, Poland), a town right next to the former Czechoslovak border, and then travelled to Město Albrechtice, Krnov, Bruntál, and Zlaté Hory.

===== Britain and France =====
The agreement was generally applauded. Prime Minister Daladier of France did not believe, as one scholar put it, that a European War was justified &quot;to maintain three million Germans under Czech sovereignty.&quot; Gallup Polls in Britain, France, and the United States indicated that the majority of people supported the agreement. President Beneš of Czechoslovakia was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize in 1939.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; headline on the Munich agreement read &quot;Hitler gets less than his Sudeten demands&quot; and reported that a &quot;joyful crowd&quot; hailed Daladier on his return to France and that Chamberlain was &quot;wildly cheered&quot; on his return to Britain.

In France, the only political party to oppose the Munich Agreement was the Communist Party.

The British population had expected an imminent war, and the &quot;statesman-like gesture&quot; of Chamberlain was at first greeted with acclaim. He was greeted as a hero by the royal family and invited on the balcony at Buckingham Palace before he had presented the agreement to the British Parliament. The generally positive reaction quickly soured, despite royal patronage. However, there was opposition from the start. Clement Attlee and the Labour Party opposed the agreement, in alliance with two Conservative MPs, Duff Cooper and Vyvyan Adams, who had been seen up to then as a reactionary element in the Conservative Party.

Daladier believed that Hitler&#x27;s ultimate goals were a threat. He told the British in a late April 1938 meeting that Hitler&#x27;s real long-term aim was to secure &quot;a domination of the Continent in comparison with which the ambitions of Napoleon were feeble.&quot; He went on to say: &quot;Today it is the turn of Czechoslovakia. Tomorrow it will be the turn of Poland and Romania. When Germany has obtained the oil and wheat it needs, she will turn on the West. Certainly we must multiply our efforts to avoid war. But that will not be obtained unless Great Britain and France stick together, intervening in Prague for new concessions but declaring at the same time that they will safeguard the independence of Czechoslovakia. If, on the contrary, the Western Powers capitulate again they will only precipitate the war they wish to avoid.&quot; Perhaps discouraged by the arguments of French military leaders and civilian officials regarding their unprepared military and weak financial situation, and still traumatized by France&#x27;s bloodbath in World War I, which he had personally witnessed, Daladier ultimately let Chamberlain have his way. On his return to Paris, Daladier, who had expected a hostile crowd, was acclaimed.

In the days following Munich, Chamberlain received more than 20,000 letters and telegrams of thanks, and gifts including 6000 assorted bulbs from grateful Dutch admirers and a cross from Pope Pius XI.

=====Poland=====

Poland was building up a secret Polish organization in the area of Trans-Olza from 1935. In summer 1938, Poland tried to organize guerrilla groups in the area. On 21 September, Poland officially requested a direct transfer of the area to its own control. Polish envoy to Prague Kazimierz Papée marked that the return of Cieszyn Silesia will be a sign of a goodwill and the &quot;redress of injustice&quot; of 1920. Similar notes were sent to Paris and London with a request that Polish minority in Czechoslovakia should gain the same rights as Sudeten Germans. On the next day Beneš sent a letter to Polish president Ignacy Mościcki with a promise of &quot;border&#x27;s rectification&quot;, but the letter was delivered only on 26 September. The answer of Mościcki delivered on 27 September was evasive, but it was accompanied with the demand of Polish government to hand over two Trans-Olza counties immediately, as a prelude to ultimate settlement of the border dispute. Beneš&#x27;s answer wasn&#x27;t conclusive: he agreed to hand over the disputed territory to Poland but argued that it could not be done on the eve of the German invasion, because it would disrupt Czechoslovak preparations for war. Poles recognised the answer as playing for time.

Polish diplomatic actions were accompanied by placing army along the Czechoslovak border on 23–24 September and by giving an order to the so-called &quot;battle units&quot; of Trans-Olza Poles and the &quot;Trans-Olza Legion&quot;, a paramilitary organisation that was made up of volunteers from all over Poland, to cross the border to Czechoslovakia and attack Czechoslovak units. The few who crossed, however, were repulsed by Czechoslovak forces and retreated to Poland.

The Polish ambassador in Germany learned about the results of Munich Conference on 30 September from Ribbentrop, who assured him that Berlin conditioned the guarantees for the remainder of Czechoslovakia on the fulfilment of Polish and Hungarian territorial demands. Polish foreign minister Józef Beck was disappointed with such a turn of events. In his own words the conference was &quot;an attempt by the directorate of great powers to impose binding decisions on other states (and Poland cannot agree on that, as it would then be reduced to a political object that others conduct at their will).&quot; As a result, at 11:45 p.m. on 30 September, 11 hours after the Czechoslovak government accepted the Munich terms, Poland gave an ultimatum to the Czechoslovak government. It demanded the immediate evacuation of Czechoslovak troops and police and gave Prague time until noon the following day. At 11:45 a.m. on 1 October the Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry called the Polish ambassador in Prague and told him that Poland could have what it wanted but then requested a 24-hour delay. On 2 October, the Polish Army, commanded by General Władysław Bortnowski, annexed an area of 801.5 km2 with a population of 227,399 people. Administratively the annexed area was divided between Frysztat County and Cieszyn County.
The historian Dariusz Baliszewski wrote that during the annexation there was no co-operation between Polish and German troops, but there were cases of co-operation between Polish and Czech troops defending territory against Germans, for example in Bohumín.

The Polish ultimatum finally led Beneš to decide, by his own account, to abandon any idea of resisting the settlement (Czechoslovakia would have been attacked on all sides).

The Germans were delighted with that outcome and were happy to give up the sacrifice of a small provincial rail centre to Poland in exchange for the ensuing propaganda benefits. It spread the blame of the partition of Czechoslovakia, made Poland a participant in the process and confused political expectations. Poland was accused of being an accomplice of Germany. However, there was no formal agreement between Poland and Germany about Czechoslovakia at any time.

The Chief of the General Staff of the Czechoslovak Army, General Ludvík Krejčí, reported on 29 September that &quot;Our army will in about two days&#x27; time be in full condition to withstand an attack even by all Germany&#x27;s forces together, provided Poland does not move against us.&quot;

Historians such as H.L. Roberts and Anna Cienciala have characterised Beck&#x27;s actions during the crisis as unfriendly to Czechoslovakia, but not actively seeking its destruction. Whilst Stalin-era Polish historiography typically followed the line that Beck had been a &quot;German Agent&quot; and had collaborated with Germany, post-1956 historiography has generally rejected this characterisation.

=====Hungary=====
Hungary followed Polish request for transfer of territory with its own request on 22 September. Hungarian demands were ultimately fulfilled during the Vienna Arbitration on 2 November 1938.

===== Soviet Union=====

Joseph Stalin was upset by the results of the Munich conference. On 2 May 1935, France and the Soviet Union signed the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance with the aim of containing Nazi Germany&#x27;s aggression. The Soviets, who had a mutual military assistance treaty with Czechoslovakia, felt betrayed by France, which also had a mutual military assistance treaty with Czechoslovakia. The British and French mostly used the Soviets as a threat to dangle over the Germans. Stalin concluded that the West had colluded with Hitler to hand over a country in Central Europe to the Germans, causing concern that they might do the same to the Soviet Union in the future to allow its partition between the western nations. This belief led the Soviet Union to reorient its foreign policy towards a rapprochement with Germany, which eventually led to the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact in 1939.

In 1938, the Soviet Union was allied with France and Czechoslovakia. By September 1939, the Soviets were to all intents and purposes a co-belligerent with Nazi Germany, due to Stalin&#x27;s fears of a second Munich Agreement with the Soviet Union replacing Czechoslovakia. Thus, the agreement indirectly contributed to the outbreak of war in 1939.

===== Elsewhere =====
The Australian Prime Minister Joseph Lyons said, &quot;We owe heartfelt thanks to all responsible for the outcome, and appreciate very much the efforts of President Roosevelt and Signor Mussolini to bring about the Munich conference of the Powers at which a united desire for peace has been shown.&quot;

====Later opinions====
As the threats of Germany and of a European war became more evident, opinions on the agreement became more hostile. Chamberlain was excoriated for his role as one of the &quot;Men of Munich&quot;, in books such as the 1940 &quot;Guilty Men&quot;. A rare wartime defence of the agreement came in 1944 from Viscount Maugham, who had been Lord Chancellor. Maugham viewed the decision to establish a Czechoslovak state including substantial German and Hungarian minorities as a &quot;dangerous experiment&quot; in the light of previous disputes and ascribed the agreement as caused largely by France&#x27;s need to extricate itself from its treaty obligations in the light of its unpreparedness for war. After the war, Churchill&#x27;s history of the period, &quot;The Gathering Storm&quot; (1948), asserted that Chamberlain&#x27;s appeasement of Hitler at Munich had been wrong and recorded Churchill&#x27;s prewar warnings of Hitler&#x27;s plan of aggression and the folly of Britain&#x27;s persisting with disarmament after Germany had achieved air parity with Britain. Although Churchill recognized that Chamberlain acted from noble motives, he argued that Hitler should have been resisted over Czechoslovakia and that efforts should have been made to involve the Soviet Union.

In his postwar memoirs, Churchill, an opponent of appeasement, lumped Poland and Hungary, both of which subsequently annexed parts of Czechoslovakia containing Poles and Hungarians, with Germany as &quot;vultures upon the carcass of Czechoslovakia.&quot;

The American historian William L. Shirer, in his &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&quot; (1960), took the view that although Hitler was not bluffing about his intention to invade, Czechoslovakia could have offered significant resistance. Shirer believed that Britain and France had enough air defences to avoid serious bombing of London and Paris and could have pursued a rapid and successful war against Germany. He quotes Churchill as saying the agreement meant that &quot;Britain and France were in a much worse position compared to Hitler&#x27;s Germany.&quot; After Hitler personally inspected the Czech fortifications, he privately said to Joseph Goebbels that &quot;we would have shed a lot of blood&quot; and that it was fortunate that there had been no fighting.

===Consequences===

On 5 October, Beneš resigned as President of Czechoslovakia since he realized that the fall of Czechoslovakia was inevitable. After the outbreak of World War II, he formed a Czechoslovak government-in-exile in London. On 6 December 1938, the French-German Non-aggression Pact was signed in Paris by French Foreign Minister Bonnet and German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://archives.chicagotribune.com&quot;&gt;France Signs &quot;No-War&quot; Pact with Germany, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, 7 December 1938&lt;/ref&gt;

Nazi Germany occupied the Sudetenland from 1938 to 1945.

==== First Vienna Award to Hungary ====

In early November 1938, under the First Vienna Award, after the failed negotiations between Czechoslovakia and Hungary, as a recommendation to settle the territorial disputes by the appendix of the Munich Agreement, the German-Italian arbitration required Czechoslovakia to cede southern Slovakia to Hungary, and Poland independently gained small territorial cessions shortly afterward (Trans-Olza).

Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia lost about 38% of their combined area to Germany, with some 2.8 million German and 513,000 to 750,000 Czech inhabitants. Hungary, in turn, received in southern Slovakia and southern Carpathian Ruthenia. According to a 1941 census, about 86.5% of the population in the territory was Hungarian. Slovakia lost and 854,218 inhabitants for Hungary (according to a Czechoslovak 1930 census about 59% were Hungarians and 32% were Slovaks and Czechs). Poland annexed the town of Český Těšín with the surrounding area (some , with 250,000 inhabitants. Poles made up about 36% of the population, down from 69% in 1910) and two minor border areas in northern Slovakia, more precisely in the regions Spiš and Orava. (, 4,280 inhabitants, only 0.3% Poles).

Soon after Munich, 115,000 Czechs and 30,000 Germans fled to the rump of Czechoslovakia. According to the Institute for Refugee Assistance, the actual count of refugees on 1 March 1939 stood at almost 150,000.

On 4 December 1938, elections in Reichsgau Sudetenland had 97.3% of the adult population vote for the Nazi Party. About half-a-million Sudeten Germans joined the Nazi Party, 17.3% of the German population in Sudetenland (the average NSDAP participation in Nazi Germany was 7.9%). Thus, the Sudetenland was the most &quot;pro-Nazi&quot; region in Nazi Germany.

Because of their knowledge of Czech, many Sudeten Germans were employed in the administration of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia as well as in Nazi organisations, such as the Gestapo. The most notable of them was Karl Hermann Frank, SS and Police General and Secretary of State in the Protectorate.

==== German invasion of rump Czechoslovakia ====
In 1937, the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; had formulated a plan, &quot;Operation Green&quot; (&quot;Fall Grün&quot;) for the invasion of Czechoslovakia. It was implemented shortly after the proclamation of the Slovak State on 15 March 1939. On 14 March, Slovakia seceded from Czechoslovakia and became a separate Nazi-subordinate state. The following day, Carpatho-Ukraine proclaimed independence as well, but after three days, it was completely occupied and annexed by Hungary. Czechoslovak President Emil Hácha traveled to Berlin and was left waiting, and orders to invade had already been given. During the meeting with Hitler, Hácha was threatened with the bombing of Prague if he refused to order the Czech troops to lay down their arms. That news induced a heart attack from which he was revived by an injection from Hitler&#x27;s doctor. Hácha then agreed to sign the communiqué accepting the German occupation of the remainder of Bohemia and Moravia, &quot;which in its unctuous mendacity was remarkable even for the Nazis.&quot; Churchill&#x27;s prediction was fulfilled, as German armies entered Prague and proceeded to occupy the rest of the country, which was transformed into a protectorate of the Reich. In March 1939, Konstantin von Neurath was appointed as Reichsprotektor and served as Hitler&#x27;s personal representative in the protectorate. Immediately after the occupation, a wave of arrests began, mostly of refugees from Germany, Jews and Czech public figures. By November, Jewish children had been expelled from their schools and their parents fired from their jobs. Universities and colleges were closed after demonstrations against the occupation of Czechoslovakia. Over 1200 students were sent to concentration camps, and nine student leaders were executed on 17 November (International Students&#x27; Day).

By seizing Bohemia and Moravia, Nazi Germany gained all of the skilled labour force and heavy industry located there as well as all the weapons of the Czechoslovak Army. During the 1940 Battle of France, roughly 25% of all German weapons came from the protectorate. Nazi Germany also gained all of the Czechoslovakia&#x27;s gold treasure, including gold stored in the Bank of England. Of a total 227 tons of gold found after the war in salt mines, only 18.4 tons were returned to Czechoslovakia in 1982, but most of it came from Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia was also forced to &quot;sell&quot; war material to the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; for 648 million of prewar Czechoslovak koruna, a debt that was never repaid.
Chamberlain claimed the Prague annexation was a &quot;completely different category&quot; that moved beyond the legitimate Versailles grievances. Meanwhile, concerns arose in Britain that Poland, which was now encircled by many German possessions, would become the next target of Nazi expansionism. That was made apparent by the dispute over the Polish Corridor and the Free City of Danzig and resulted in the signing of an Anglo-Polish military alliance. That made the Polish government refuse to accept German negotiation proposals over the Polish Corridor and the status of Danzig. Chamberlain felt betrayed by the Nazi seizure of Czechoslovakia, realized that his policy of appeasement towards Hitler had failed and so began to take a much harder line against Germany. He immediately began to mobilize the British armed forces to a war footing, and France did the same. Italy saw itself threatened by the British and French fleets and started its own invasion of Albania in April 1939.

==== Strengthening of Wehrmacht armaments ====
Since most of the border defences had been in the territory ceded as a consequence of the Munich Agreement, the rest of Czechoslovakia was entirely open to further invasion despite its relatively-large stockpiles of modern armaments. In a speech delivered in the Reichstag, Hitler expressed the importance of the occupation for strengthening of German military and noted that by occupying Czechoslovakia, Germany gained 2,175 field guns and cannons, 469 tanks, 500 anti-aircraft artillery pieces, 43,000 machine guns, 1,090,000 military rifles, 114,000 pistols, about a billion rounds of small-arms ammunition, and 3 million rounds of anti-aircraft ammunition. That could then arm about half of the Wehrmacht. Czechoslovak weapons later played a major role in the German conquest of Poland and France, the latter having urged Czechoslovakia into surrendering the Sudetenland in 1938.

====Birth of German resistance in military====
In Germany, the Sudeten crisis led to the so-called Oster conspiracy. General Hans Oster, the deputy head of the &quot;Abwehr&quot;, and prominent figures within the German military opposed the regime for its behaviour, which threatened to bring Germany into a war that they believed it was not ready to fight. They discussed overthrowing Hitler and the regime through a planned storming of the Reich Chancellery by forces loyal to the plot.

====Italian colonial demands from France====

Italy strongly supported Germany at Munich, and a few weeks later, in October 1938, tried to use its advantage to make new demands on France. Mussolini demanded a free port at Djibouti, control of the Addis Ababa-Djibouti railroad, Italian participation in the management of Suez Canal Company, some form of French-Italian condominium over Tunisia and the preservation of Italian culture in French-held Corsica with no French assimilation of the people. France rejected those demands and began threatening naval maneuvers as a warning to Italy.

===Quotations from key participants===

Germany stated that the incorporation of Austria into the Reich resulted in borders with Czechoslovakia that were a great danger to German security, and that this allowed Germany to be encircled by the Western Powers.

Neville Chamberlain announced the deal at Heston Aerodrome as follows:

Later that day he stood outside 10 Downing Street and again read from the document and concluded:

Winston Churchill, denouncing the Agreement in the House of Commons on 5 October 1938, declared:

On 13 August 1938, prior to the conference, Churchill had written in a letter to David Lloyd George:
==Legal nullification==
During the Second World War, British Prime Minister Churchill, who opposed the agreement when it was signed, became determined that the terms of the agreement would not be upheld after the war and that the Sudeten territories should be returned to postwar Czechoslovakia. On 5 August 1942, Foreign Minister Anthony Eden sent the following note to Jan Masaryk:

To which Masaryk replied as follows:

In September 1942 the French National Committee, headed by Charles de Gaulle, proclaimed the Munich Agreement to be null and void from the very beginning, and on 17 August 1944, the French government reaffirmed this. After Mussolini&#x27;s fascist leadership had been replaced, the Italian Government followed suit and did the same.

Following Allied victory and the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945, the Sudetenland was returned to Czechoslovakia, while the German speaking majority was expelled in accordance with the international Potsdam Agreement.

==&quot;Ghost of Munich&quot;==
In the United States and the United Kingdom, the words &quot;Munich&quot; and &quot;appeasement&quot; are frequently invoked when demanding forthright, often military, action to resolve an international crisis and characterising a political opponent who condemns negotiation as weakness. In 1950, US President Harry Truman invoked &quot;Munich&quot; to justify his military action in the Korean War: &quot;The world learned from Munich that security cannot be bought by appeasement.&quot; Many later crises were accompanied by cries of &quot;Munich&quot; from politicians and the media. In 1960, the conservative US Senator Barry Goldwater used &quot;Munich&quot; to describe a domestic political issue by saying that an attempt by the Republican Party to appeal to liberals was &quot;the Munich of the Republican Party.&quot; In 1962, General Curtis LeMay told US President John F. Kennedy that his refusal to bomb Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis was &quot;almost as bad as the appeasement at Munich&quot;, a pointed barb given that his father Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. had supported appeasement in general in his capacity as Ambassador to Britain. In 1965, US President Lyndon Johnson, in justifying increased military action in Vietnam, stated, &quot;We learned from Hitler and Munich that success only feeds the appetite for aggression.&quot;

Citing Munich in debates on foreign policy has continued to be common in the 21st century. During negotiations for the Iran nuclear agreement mediated by Secretary of State John Kerry, Representative John Culberson, a Texas Republican Representative, tweeted the message &quot;Worse than Munich.&quot; Kerry had himself invoked Munich in a speech in France advocating military action in Syria by saying, &quot;This is our Munich moment.&quot;

&quot;Munich and appeasement&quot;, in the words of scholars Fredrik Logevall and Kenneth Osgood, &quot;have become among the dirtiest words in American politics, synonymous with naivete and weakness, and signifying a craven willingness to barter away the nation&#x27;s vital interests for empty promises.&quot; They claimed that the success of US foreign policy often depends upon a president withstanding &quot;the inevitable charges of appeasement that accompany any decision to negotiate with hostile powers.&quot; The presidents who challenged the &quot;tyranny of Munich&quot; have often achieved policy breakthroughs and those who had cited Munich as a principle of US foreign policy had often led the nation into its &quot;most enduring tragedies.&quot;

The West German policy of staying neutral in the Arab–Israeli conflict after the Munich massacre and the following hijack of the Lufthansa Flight 615 in 1972, rather than taking a pro-Israel position, led to Israeli comparisons with the Munich Agreement of appeasement.

<text>Sejong (; 15 May 1397 – 8 April 1450), personal name Yi To (), commonly known as Sejong the Great (), was the fourth monarch of the Joseon dynasty of Korea. He is regarded as one of the greatest rulers in Korean history, and is remembered as the inventor of Hangul, the native alphabet of the Korean language. 

Initially titled Grand Prince Chungnyeong (), he was the third son of King Taejong and Queen Wongyeong. In 1418, Sejong replaced his eldest brother, Yi Che, as crown prince; a few months later, Taejong voluntarily abdicated the throne in Sejong&#x27;s favor. In the early years of Sejong&#x27;s reign, King Emeritus Taejong retained vast powers, most notably absolute executive and military power, and continued to govern until his death in 1422.

Sejong reinforced Korean Confucian and neo-Confucian policies, and enacted major legal amendments (). He personally created and promulgated the Korean alphabet, encouraged advancements in science and technology, and introduced measures to stimulate economic growth. He launched military campaigns to the north and implemented a relocation policy (), establishing settlements in the newly conquered areas. He also ordered the military campaign against Tsushima island of 1419.

From 1439, he became increasingly ill and his eldest son, Crown Prince Yi Hyang, acted as regent. Sejong died on 8 April 1450.

==Early life==
Sejong was born Yi To () on 15 May 1397, in Junsubang, Hanseong (Seoul), Joseon to Yi Pang-wŏn and a lady of the influential Yeoheung Min clan (later Queen Wongyeong). While records of Yi&#x27;s childhood are scarce, it is known that Yi was born outside Gyeongbokgung when his father, Yi Pang-wŏn, was not yet heir to the throne.

In 1408, Yi&#x27;s father arranged his marriage to Lady Sim of the , who would later become Queen Soheon. In 1412, Yi To was granted the title Grand Prince Chungnyeong (). In 1414, he had his first son, who would later become Munjong.

=== Selection as heir to the throne ===
As Taejong&#x27;s eldest son, Grand Prince Yangnyeong was to inherit the throne. However, Taejong, as well as court officials, increasingly deemed Yangnyeong unsuitable for the role due to his erratic and irresponsible behavior. In a series of escalating events involving Yangnyeong&#x27;s affair with Eori, a concubine of Kwak Sŏn, Yangnyeong was ultimately deposed as crown prince.

In mid-1418, court officials petitioned Taejong to consider a new candidate for the throne. Following primogeniture, Taejong initially considered Yangnyeong&#x27;s eldest son for the role. However, the officials objected and insisted that Taejong select a wise person as heir apparent. King Taejong asked the officials to propose an alternative. According to the Veritable Records, they gave an indirect response: &quot;The father knows his sons best, as the king knows his subjects best.&quot; Taejong judged his second son, Grand Prince Hyoryeong, to have a disposition too soft for the role, and would be unable to drink with emissaries from Ming dynasty to entertain them. He then proposed Chungnyeong, whom he felt was intelligent and sharp in matters of politics. The officials welcomed the decision and confirmed that Chungnyeong had been their preferred choice. On 8 July 1418, Chungnyeong was made crown prince of Joseon.

== Reign ==
On 18 September 1418, Chungnyeong ascended the throne as King Sejong, following Taejong&#x27;s abdication. However, Taejong retained military power and continued to make major political decisions as king emeritus () until his death. Sejong did not challenge Taejong&#x27;s authority and deferred to his father during this period. Perpetually wary of royal authority falling into the thrall of the queen&#x27;s clan, Taejong had Sejong&#x27;s father-in-law, Shim On, executed on charges of treason. Other members of the queen&#x27;s family were exiled or made commoners, which left Queen Soheon politically isolated and unable to protest.

Despite inheriting significantly strengthened royal authority, Sejong did not suppress the press and promoted meritocracy through &quot;gwageo&quot;, the national civil service exam.

===Religion===
During the Goryeo period, monks wielded strong political and economic influence. However, in Joseon, Buddhism was considered a false philosophy and the monks were viewed as corrupted by power and money.

Likewise, Sejong continued Joseon&#x27;s policies of &quot;worshiping Confucianism and suppressing Buddhism&quot; (). He banned monks from entering Hanseong and reduced the seven schools of Buddhism down to two, &quot;Seon&quot; and &quot;Gyo&quot;, drastically decreasing the power and wealth of the religious leaders. One of the key factors in this suppression was Sejong&#x27;s reform of the land system. This policy resulted in temple lands being seized and redistributed for development and monks losing large amounts of economic influence. Furthermore, he performed government ceremonies according to Confucianism and encouraged people to behave according to the teachings of Confucius.

At the same time, Sejong sought to alleviate religious tensions between Confucianism and Buddhism. The &quot;Seokbosangjeol&quot; (), a 24-volume Korean-language biography of Buddha translated from Chinese Buddhist texts, was commissioned and published in Sejong&#x27;s reign by Grand Prince Suyang, in mourning for Queen Soheon, a devout Buddhist. Sejong advocated the projectdespite fierce opposition from his courtiersand condemned the hypocrisy of those who privately worship the Buddha yet publicly rebuke others for doing so. 
In 1427, Sejong issued a decree against the Huihui (Korean Muslim) community that had enjoyed special status and stipends since the Yuan dynasty&#x27;s rule over Goryeo. The Huihui were forced to abandon their headgear, close down their ceremonial halla mosque in Gaegyeong, present-day Kaesongand worship like everyone else. No further records of Muslims exist during the Joseon era.

===Economy===
In the early years of the Joseon dynasty, the economy operated on a barter system, with cloth, grain, and cotton being the most common forms of currency. In 1423, under King Sejong&#x27;s administration, the government attempted to introduce a national currency modeled after the Tang dynasty&#x27;s &quot;kaiyuan tongbao&quot; (). The resulting &quot;Joseon tongbo&quot; () was a bronze coin, backed by a silver standard, with 150 coins being equal to 600 grams of silver. However, production ceased in 1425 due to high manufacturing costs, as the exchange rate dropped below the coin&#x27;s intrinsic value.

In 1445, Sejong consolidated the various &quot;sujoji&quot; records, previously managed by various government offices, and placed them under the administration of the Ministry of Taxation (&quot;Hojo&quot;) to improve transparency in Joseon&#x27;s fiscal policies.

===Military===
King Sejong was an effective military planner and created various military regulations to strengthen the safety of his kingdom. During his reign great technological advancements were made in the manufacture of gunpowder and firearms. Hand cannons, known as &quot;Wangu&quot; (), first built in 1407 and 1418, were improved upon, and the &quot;Sohwapo&quot; (), &quot;Cheoljetanhwan&quot; (), &quot;Hwapojeon&quot; () and the &quot;Hwacho&quot; () were invented during his reign.

None of these had yet reached a satisfactory level for Sejong. In the 26th year of his reign, he had the cannon foundry &quot;Hwapojujoso&quot; () built to produce a new standard cannon with outstanding performance, and in the following year, he undertook a complete overhaul of the cannon. The &quot;Chongtongdeungnok&quot; () compiled and published in the 30th year his reign, was an illustrated book that described the casting methods, gunpowder usage, and specifications of the guns. The publication of this book is considered a remarkable achievement that marked a new era in the manufacture of artillery during the Joseon Dynasty.

In June 1419, under his father&#x27;s counsel, Sejong ordered the third and last military campaign of Tsushima. This incident is known as the &quot;Gihae Expedition&quot; in Korean and &quot;Ōei Invasion&quot; in Japanese. The military expedition was aimed at eradicating the taproot of the Japanese pirates&#x27; pillaging the southern villages of the Joseon dynasty. During the invasion, 245 Japanese were executed or killed and another 110 were captured, while 180 Korean soldiers died. Around 150 who had been kidnapped (146 Chinese and 8 Koreans) were also freed. A truce was made in July 1419, and the Joseon army returned to the Korean Peninsula, but no official documents were signed until 1443. In this agreement, known as the Treaty of Gyehae, the &quot;daimyo&quot; of Tsushima was obliged to pay tribute to the Joseon monarch, and in return, the Sō clan was allowed to serve as a diplomatic intermediary between Korea and Japan, as well as retain exclusive trade rights.

In 1433, Sejong sent Kim Chongsŏ to the north to conquer the Jurchens. The military campaign captured several fortresses and expanded the Korean territory northward up to the Songhua River.

===Science, technology, and agriculture===
Sejong promoted science. In 1420, Sejong created a royal academy within Gyeongbok Palace known as the Hall of Worthies. The institute was responsible for conducting scientific research with the purpose of advancing the country&#x27;s technology. The Hall of Worthies was designed to host Joseon&#x27;s best and brightest thinkers, with the government offering grants and scholarships to encourage young scholars to attend.

In 1428, Sejong ordered the printing of one thousand copies of a farmer&#x27;s handbook. The following year, he published the &quot;Nongsa Jikseol&quot; (), a compilation of various farming methods accommodative to Korea&#x27;s climate and soil conditions. The book dealt with planting, harvesting, and soil treatment, and contained information about the different farming techniques that scientists gathered from different regions of Korea. These techniques were essential for maintaining the newly adopted intensive and continuous cultivation methods.

One of Sejong&#x27;s close associates was the inventor Jang Yeong-sil. Jang, who was originally a government-owned &quot;nobi&quot; from Dongnae, appointed as court technician by Sejong in 1423. Jang had been released from nobi by Taejong. Sejong appointed Jang to a &quot;byeoljwa&quot; (), responsible for crafting and repairing royal items.

In 1442, Jang Yeong-sil made one of the world&#x27;s first standardized rain gauges named &quot;cheugugi&quot; (). This model has not survived, with the oldest existing Korean rain gauge being made in 1770, during the reign of King Yeongjo. According to the Daily Records of the Royal Secretariat (), Yeongjo wanted to revive the glorious times of Sejong the Great, and started reading chronicles from that era. When he came across the mention of a rain gauge, Yeongjo ordered a reproduction. Since there is a mark of the Qing dynasty ruler Qianlong (r. 1735–96), dated 1770, this Korean-designed rain gauge is sometimes misunderstood as having been imported from China.

In 1434, Jang Yeong-sil, tasked by King Sejong, invented the &quot;gabinja&quot; (), a new type of printing press. This printing press was said to be twice as fast as the previous model and was composed of copper-zinc and lead-tin alloys.

Sejong also wanted to reform the Korean calendar system, which was at the time based upon the longitude of the Chinese capital. He had his astronomers create a calendar with the Joseon capital of Hanseong as the primary meridian. This new system allowed Joseon astronomers to accurately predict the timing of solar and lunar eclipses.

In the realm of traditional Korean medicine, two important treatises were written during his reign. These were the &quot;Hyangyak Jipseongbang&quot; () and the &quot;Euibang Yuchwi&quot; (), which historian Kim Yong-sik says represents &quot;the Koreans&#x27; efforts to develop their own system of medical knowledge, distinct from that of China&quot;.

===Public welfare===
In 1426, Sejong enacted a law that granted government serfs () women 100 days of maternity leave after childbirth, which, in 1430, was lengthened by one month before childbirth. In 1434, he also granted the husbands 30 days of paternity leave.

In order to provide equality and fairness in taxation for the common people, Sejong issued a royal decree to administer a nationwide public opinion poll regarding a new tax system called &quot;Gongbeop&quot; in 1430. Over the course of five months, the poll surveyed 172,806 people, of which approximately 57% responded with approval for the proposed reform.

Joseon&#x27;s economy depended on the agricultural output of the farmers, so Sejong allowed them to pay more or less tax according to the fluctuations of economic prosperity and hard times. Because of this, farmers could worry less about tax quotas and instead work at maintaining and selling their crops.

It is said that once, when the palace had a significant surplus of food, the king distributed it to poor peasants who needed it. Otherwise the state maintained a permanent grain dole, that existed since the days of Unified Silla.

===Literature===
Sejong composed the famous &quot;Yongbieocheonga&quot; (&quot;Songs of Flying Dragons&quot;; 1445), &quot;Seokbo Sangjeol&quot; (&quot;Episodes from the Life of Buddha&quot;; July 1447), &quot;Worin Cheongang Jigok&quot; (&quot;Songs of the Moon Shining on a Thousand Rivers&quot;; July 1447), and &quot;Dongguk Jeongun&quot; (&quot;Dictionary of Proper Sino-Korean Pronunciation&quot;; September 1447).

===Arts===
One of Sejong&#x27;s closest friends and mentors was the 15th century musician Bak Yeon. Together they composed over two hundred musical arrangements. Sejong&#x27;s independent musical compositions include the &quot;Chongdaeop&quot; (&#x27;Great Achievements&#x27;), &quot;Potaepyeong&quot; (&#x27;Preservation of Peace&#x27;), &quot;Pongnaeui&quot; (&#x27;Phoenix&#x27;), and &quot;Yominrak&quot; (&#x27;A Joy to Share with the People&#x27;). &quot;Yominrak&quot; continues to be a standard piece played by modern traditional Korean orchestras, while &quot;Chongdaeop&quot; and &quot;Potaepyeong&quot; are played during the &quot;Jongmyo Jerye&quot; (memorials honoring the kings of Joseon).

In 1418, during Sejong&#x27;s reign, scholars developed the &quot;Pyeongyeong&quot; (), a lithophone modeled on the Chinese &quot;bianqing&quot;. The Pyeongyeong is a percussion instrument consisting of two rows of 8 pumice slabs hung on a decorative wooden frame with a 16-tone range and struck with an ox horn mallet. It was manufactured using pumice mined from the Gyeonggi Province and was primarily used for ceremonies.

Sejong&#x27;s contribution to the arts continued long after his death; he had always wanted to use Korean music rather than Chinese music for ancestral rituals, but conservative court officials stopped his efforts. However, when Sejong&#x27;s son, King Sejo, rose to the throne, he modified the ritual music composed by his father and created the ″&quot;Jongmyo&quot; court music″, which was used for royal ancestral rituals and is now inscribed as an UNESCO Intangible Cultural Hertiage.

===Hangul===

King Sejong profoundly affected Korea&#x27;s history with the creation and introduction of &quot;hangul&quot;, the native phonetic writing system for the Korean language. Although it is widely assumed that he ordered the Hall of Worthies to invent the script, contemporaneous records such as the &quot;Veritable Records of King Sejong&quot; and Chŏng Inji&#x27;s preface to the &quot;Hunminjeongeum Haerye&quot; emphasize that Sejong invented it himself.

Before the creation of the new alphabet, the people of Joseon primarily used Classical Chinese to write, alongside a few writing systems like &quot;idu&quot;, &quot;hyangchal&quot;, &quot;gugyeol&quot;, and &quot;gakpil&quot;which used Chinese characters to approximate sounds of the Korean languagethat had been in use since hundreds of years before hangul. However, due to the fundamental differences between the Korean and Chinese languages, and the large number of Chinese characters required, lower-class people of Joseon lacked the privilege of education and were illiterate. To promote literacy, King Sejong created hangul (which initially had 28 letters, four of which are no longer in use).

Hangul was completed in 1443 and published in 1446 along with a 33-page manual titled &quot;Hunminjeongeum&quot;, explaining what the letters are as well as the philosophical theories and motives behind them.

King Sejong faced backlash from the noble class as many disapproved of the idea of a common writing system, with some openly opposing its creation. Many within the nobility believed that giving the peasants the ability to read and write would allow them to find and abuse loopholes within the law. Others felt that hangul would threaten their families&#x27; positions in court by creating a larger pool of civil servants. The Joseon elite continued to use the Chinese &quot;hanja&quot; long after Sejong&#x27;s death. Hangul was often treated with contempt by those in power and received criticism in the form of nicknames, including &quot;eonmun&quot; (&quot;vulgar script&quot;), &quot;amkeul&quot; (&quot;women&#x27;s script&quot;), and &quot;ahaekkeul&quot; (&quot;children&#x27;s script&quot;). It was commonly used for areas like casual writing, prose and bookkeeping, especially by the urban middle class like administrators and bureaucrats. It notably gained popularity among women and fiction writers, with former usually often not having been able to get access to hanja education.

In 1504, the study and publication of hangul was banned by Yeonsangun. Its spread and preservation can be largely attributed to three main factors: books published for women, its use by Buddhist monks, and the introduction of Christianity in Korea in 1602. Hangul was brought into the mainstream culture in the 16th century, due to a renaissance in literature and poetry. It continued to gain popularity well into the 17th century, and gained wider use after a period of nationalism in the 19th century. In 1849, it was adopted as Korea&#x27;s national writing system, and saw its first use in official government documents. After the Treaty of 1910, hangul was outlawed again until the liberation of Korea in 1945.

==Health issues and death==
Sejong suffered from eye diseases and deteriorating vision and likely had health issues linked to excessive meat consumption all throughout his life. Sejong&#x27;s love for meat is clear from a comment by King Emeritus Taejong. When Sejong stopped eating fish and meat to mourn after the death of JeongjongSejong&#x27;s uncle and Taejong&#x27;s older brotherTaejong remarked that Sejong had always found it hard to eat without meat since he was a child. Sejong also started having musculoskeletal pain at the age of 22. One day he was supposed to organize a farewell party for the emissaries to the Ming dynasty but was in too much pain to do so. Sejong said: &quot;My waist and back are stiff and immobile, so it is hard to bend or straighten.&quot; There is speculation that he had diabetes, but there is inadequate evidence for a modern medical diagnosis. There is also an account of Sejong&#x27;s having a disease that roughly translates to &quot;palsy&quot; () and essential tremor (), but terminology of the 15th century Korean traditional medicine does not translate well.

Sejong died on 8 April 1450, on the &quot;Gregorian&quot; calendar, at the residence of Grand Prince Young-eung at the age of 52. He was buried at &quot;Yeongneung&quot; () in the same mound as his wife, Queen Soheon, who had died four years earlier. His tomb is located in Yeoju, South Korea.

His successor was his first son, Yi Hyang (posthumously King Munjong). Sejong was concerned that sickly Munjong would die early and leave his vulnerable young son to reign, so he asked scholars from the Hall of Worthies to look after his young grandson, Danjong. As predicted, Munjong died two years after his ascension, and the political stability enjoyed in the past decades disintegrated when Danjong became the sixth king of Joseon at the age of 12. Eventually, Sejong&#x27;s second son, Grand Prince Suyang (later known as King Sejo), usurped the throne in 1455. When six court officials were implicated in a plot to restore his nephew, Sejo abolished the Hall of Worthies and executed Danjong along with several ministers who served during Sejong&#x27;s reign.

== Reception and legacy ==

Sejong the Great is considered one of the most influential monarchs in Korean history, with the creation of Hangul considered his greatest legacy. Sejong is widely renowned in modern-day South Korea. In a 2024 survey by Gallup Korea, Sejong was nominated as the second most respected figure by South Koreans, only to be surpassed by Yi Sun-sin. The Encyclopedia of Korean Culture evaluates the reign of Sejong &quot;the most shining period of the history of our [the Korean] people.&quot; Sejong&#x27;s creation of the Korean alphabet is celebrated every 9 October as Hangul Day, a national holiday.

Multiple places in South Korea, including Sejong Street (&quot;Sejongno&quot;; 세종로, 世宗路), Sejong–Pocheon Expressway, and Sejong Special Autonomous City, South Korea&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; administrative capital, are named after him. Various institutes such as King Sejong Station, the King Sejong Institute, the Sejong Center for the Performing Arts, Sejong Science High School, and Sejong University also bear his name. A bronze statue of King Sejong, unveiled in 2009 in celebration of the 563rd anniversary of the invention of the Korean alphabet, now sits on a concrete pedestal on the boulevard of Gwanghwamun Square and directly in front of the Sejong Center for the Performing Arts in Seoul. The pedestal contains one of the several entrances to the 3,200 m2 underground museum exhibit entitled &quot;The Story of King Sejong&quot;. In 2007, the South Korean Chief of Naval Operations officially announced the naming of its &quot;Sejong the Great&quot;-class destroyers, further explaining that Sejong&#x27;s name was chosen as he was the most beloved figure among South Koreans.
A portrait of Sejong is featured on the 10,000-won banknote of the South Korean won, along with various scientific tools invented under his reign. Sejong was first portrayed in the 1000-&quot;hwan&quot; bill as part of the 15 August 1960 currency reform, replacing the portrait of former president Syngman Rhee. Sejong was also featured on the 500-&quot;hwan&quot; bill the following year. Both bills were decommissioned in 1962. Sejong&#x27;s portrait returned with the introduction of the 10,000-&quot;won&quot; bill, when his portrait and Geunjeongjeon replaced Seokguram and Bulguksa as features of the bill, in 1973.

In North Korea, Sejong is not as widely commemorated as in the South. Volume 16 of the &quot;Great Korean Encyclopedia&quot; asserts that feudalist pressure and extortion was strengthened during Sejong&#x27;s reign and that all of Sejong&#x27;s policies were directed for the benefit of the feudalist ruling class. In contrast, on 15 December 2001, North Korean news outlet Tongil Sinbo stated in a column that Sejong the Great greatly contributed to Korean science during his 30-year reign. Hangul Day is also celebrated in North Korea, albeit on a different date than in South Korea.

==Family==
=== Ancestry ===
===Consorts and issue===
Sejong and his primary consort Soheon had ten children together: the most for any queen consort of the Joseon period. Historian Lee Han argues it is unclear if their relationship had genuine love; while they had numerous children together, and there is evidence of the two caring for and treating each other respectfully, Taejong had the queen&#x27;s father executed, and Sejong dutifully consented to this.

<text>Conduct disorder (CD) is a mental disorder diagnosed in childhood or adolescence that presents itself through a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior that includes theft, lies, physical violence that may lead to destruction, and reckless breaking of rules, in which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate norms are violated. These behaviors are often referred to as &quot;antisocial behaviors&quot;, and is often seen as the precursor to antisocial personality disorder; however, the latter, by definition, cannot be diagnosed until the individual is 18 years old. Conduct disorder may result from parental rejection and neglect and in such cases can be treated with family therapy, as well as behavioral modifications and pharmacotherapy. It may also be caused by environmental lead exposure. Conduct disorder is estimated to affect 51.1 million people globally 
==Signs and symptoms==
One of the symptoms of conduct disorder is a lower level of fear. Research performed on the impact of toddlers exposed to fear and distress shows that negative emotionality (fear) predicts toddlers&#x27; empathy-related response to distress. The findings support that if a caregiver is able to respond to infant cues, the toddler has a better ability to respond to fear and distress. If a child does not learn how to handle fear or distress the child will be more likely to lash out at other children. If the caregiver is able to provide therapeutic intervention teaching children at risk better empathy skills, the child will have a lower incident level of conduct disorder.

The condition is also linked to a rise in violent and antisocial behaviour; examples may range from pushing, hitting and biting when the child is young, progressing towards beating and inflicted cruelty as the child becomes older. Additionally, self-harm has been observed in children with conduct disorder (CD). A predisposition towards impulsivity and lowered emotional intelligence have been cited as contributing factors to this phenomenon. However, in order to determine direct causal links further studies must be conducted.

Conduct disorder can present with limited prosocial emotions, lack of remorse or guilt, lack of empathy, lack of concern for performance, and shallow or deficient affect. Symptoms vary by individual, but the four main groups of symptoms are described below.

=== Aggression to people and animals ===
* Often bullies, threatens or intimidates others
* Often initiates physical fights
* Has used a weapon that can cause serious physical harm to others (e.g., a bat, brick, broken bottle, knife, gun)
* Has been physically cruel to people
* Has been physically cruel to animals
* Has stolen while confronting a victim (e.g., mugging, purse snatching, extortion, armed robbery)
* Feels no remorse or empathy towards the harm, fear, or pain they may have inflicted on others

=== Destruction of property ===
* Has deliberately engaged in fire setting with the intention of causing serious damage
* Has deliberately destroyed others&#x27; property (other than by fire setting)

=== Deceitfulness or theft ===
* Has broken into someone else&#x27;s house, other building, car, other vehicle, etc
* Often lies to obtain goods or favors or to avoid obligations (i.e., &quot;cons&quot; others)
* Has stolen items of nontrivial value without confronting a victim (e.g., shoplifting, but without breaking and entering; forgery)

=== Serious violations of rules ===
* Often stays out at night despite parental prohibitions, beginning before age 13
* Has run away from home overnight at least twice while living in parental or parental surrogate home (or once without returning for a lengthy period)
* Is often truant from school, beginning before age 13
The lack of empathy these individuals have and the aggression that accompanies this carelessness for the consequences is dangerous, not only for the individual but for those around them.

===Developmental course===
Currently, two possible developmental courses are thought to lead to conduct disorder. The first is known as the &quot;childhood-onset type&quot; and occurs when conduct disorder symptoms are present before the age of 10 years. This course is often linked to a more persistent life course and more pervasive behaviors. Specifically, children in this group have greater levels of ADHD symptoms, neuropsychological deficits, more academic problems, increased family dysfunction and higher likelihood of aggression and violence.

There is debate among professionals regarding the validity and appropriateness of diagnosing young children with conduct disorder. The characteristics of the diagnosis are commonly seen in young children who are referred to mental health professionals. A premature diagnosis made in young children, and thus labeling and stigmatizing an individual, may be inappropriate. It is also argued that some children may not in fact have conduct disorder, but are engaging in developmentally appropriate disruptive behavior.

The second developmental course is known as the &quot;adolescent-onset type&quot; and occurs when conduct disorder symptoms are present after the age of 10 years. Individuals with adolescent-onset conduct disorder exhibit less impairment than those with the childhood-onset type and are not characterized by similar psychopathology. At times, these individuals will remit in their deviant patterns before adulthood. Research has shown that there is a greater number of children with adolescent-onset conduct disorder than those with childhood-onset, suggesting that adolescent-onset conduct disorder is an exaggeration of developmental behaviors that are typically seen in adolescence, such as rebellion against authority figures and rejection of conventional values. However, this argument is not established and empirical research suggests that these subgroups are not as valid as once thought.

In addition to these two courses that are recognized by the DSM-IV-TR, there appears to be a relationship among oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and antisocial personality disorder. Specifically, research has demonstrated continuity in the disorders such that conduct disorder is often diagnosed in children who have been previously diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder, and most adults with antisocial personality disorder were previously diagnosed with conduct disorder. For example, some research has shown that 90% of children diagnosed with conduct disorder had a previous diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder. Moreover, both disorders share relevant risk factors and disruptive behaviors, suggesting that oppositional defiant disorder is a developmental precursor and milder variant of conduct disorder. However, this is not to say that this trajectory occurs in all individuals. In fact, only about 25% of children with oppositional defiant disorder will receive a later diagnosis of conduct disorder. Correspondingly, there is an established link between conduct disorder and the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder as an adult. In fact, the current diagnostic criteria for antisocial personality disorder require a conduct disorder diagnosis before the age of 15. However, again, only 25–40% of youths with conduct disorder will develop an antisocial personality disorder. Nonetheless, many of the individuals who do not meet full criteria for antisocial personality disorder still exhibit a pattern of social and personal impairments or antisocial behaviors. These developmental trajectories suggest the existence of antisocial pathways in certain individuals, which have important implications for both research and treatment.

===Associated conditions===
Children with conduct disorder have a high risk of developing other adjustment problems. Specifically, risk factors associated with conduct disorder and the effects of conduct disorder symptomatology on a child&#x27;s psychosocial context have been linked to overlapping with other psychological disorders. In this way, there seems to be reciprocal effects of comorbidity with certain disorders, leading to increased overall risk for these youth.

====Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder====
ADHD is the condition most commonly associated with conduct disorders, with approximately 25–30% of boys and 50–55% of girls with conduct disorder having a comorbid ADHD diagnosis. While it is unlikely that ADHD alone is a risk factor for developing conduct disorder, children who exhibit hyperactivity and impulsivity along with aggression is associated with the early onset of conduct problems. Moreover, children with comorbid conduct disorder and ADHD show more severe aggression.

====Substance use disorders====
Conduct disorder is also highly associated with both substance use and abuse. Children with conduct disorder have an earlier onset of substance use, as compared to their peers, and also tend to use multiple substances. However, substance use disorders themselves can directly or indirectly cause conduct disorder like traits in about half of adolescents who have a substance use disorder. As mentioned above, it seems that there is a transactional relationship between substance use and conduct problems, such that aggressive behaviors increase substance use, which leads to increased aggressive behavior.

Substance use in conduct disorder can lead to antisocial behavior in adulthood.

====Schizophrenia====
Conduct disorder is a precursor to schizophrenia in a minority of cases, with about 40% of men and 31% of women with schizophrenia meeting criteria for childhood conduct disorder.

==Cause==
While the cause of conduct disorder is complicated by an intricate interplay of biological and environmental factors, identifying underlying mechanisms is crucial for obtaining accurate assessment and implementing effective treatment. These mechanisms serve as the fundamental building blocks on which evidence-based treatments are developed. Despite the complexities, several domains have been implicated in the development of conduct disorder including cognitive variables, neurological factors, intraindividual factors, familial and peer influences, and wider contextual factors. These factors may also vary based on the age of onset, with different variables related to early (e.g., neurodevelopmental basis) and adolescent (e.g., social/peer relationships) onset.

===Risks===
The development of conduct disorder is not immutable or predetermined. A number of interactive risk and protective factors exist that can influence and change outcomes, and in most cases conduct disorder develops due to an interaction and gradual accumulation of risk factors. In addition to the risk factors identified under cause, several other variables place youth at increased risk for developing the disorder, including child physical abuse, in-utero alcohol exposure, and maternal smoking during pregnancy. Protective factors have also been identified, and most notably include high IQ, being female, positive social orientations, good coping skills, and supportive family and community relationships.

However, a correlation between a particular risk factor and a later developmental outcome (such as conduct disorder) cannot be taken as definitive evidence for a causal link. Co-variation between two variables can arise, for instance, if they represent age-specific expressions of similar underlying genetic factors. There have been studies that found that, although smoking during pregnancy does contribute to increased levels of antisocial behaviour, in mother-fetus pairs that were not genetically related (by virtue of in-vitro fertilisation), no link between smoking during pregnancy and later conduct problems was found. Thus, the distinction between causality and correlation is an important consideration.

===Learning disabilities===
While language impairments are most common, approximately 20–25% of youth with conduct disorder have some type of learning disability. Although the relationship between the disorders is complex, it seems as if learning disabilities result from a combination of ADHD, a history of academic difficulty and failure, and long-standing socialization difficulties with family and peers. However, confounding variables, such as language deficits, SES disadvantage, or neurodevelopmental delay also need to be considered in this relationship, as they could help explain some of the association between conduct disorder and learning problems.

===Cognitive factors===
In terms of cognitive function, intelligence and cognitive deficits are common amongst youths with conduct disorder, particularly those with early-onset and have intelligence quotients (IQ) one standard deviation below the mean and severe deficits in verbal reasoning and executive function. Executive function difficulties may manifest in terms of one&#x27;s ability to shift between tasks, plan as well as organize, and also inhibit a prepotent response. These findings hold true even after taking into account other variables such as socioeconomic status (SES), and education. However, IQ and executive function deficits are only one piece of the puzzle, and the magnitude of their influence is increased during transactional processes with environmental factors.

===Brain differences===
Beyond difficulties in executive function, neurological research on youth with conduct disorder also demonstrate differences in brain anatomy and function that reflect the behaviors and mental anomalies associated in conduct disorder. Compared to normal controls, youths with early and adolescent onset of conduct disorder displayed reduced responses in brain regions associated with social behavior (i.e., amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex). In addition, youths with conduct disorder also demonstrated less responsiveness in the orbitofrontal regions of the brain during a stimulus-reinforcement and reward task. This provides a neural explanation for why youths with conduct disorder may be more likely to repeat poor decision making patterns. Lastly, youths with conduct disorder display a reduction in grey matter volume in the amygdala, which may account for the fear conditioning deficits. This reduction has been linked to difficulty processing social emotional stimuli, regardless of the age of onset. Aside from the differences in neuroanatomy and activation patterns between youth with conduct disorder and controls, neurochemical profiles also vary between groups. Individuals with conduct disorder are characterized as having reduced serotonin and cortisol levels (e.g., reduced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis), as well as reduced autonomic nervous system (ANS) functioning. These reductions are associated with the inability to regulate mood and impulsive behaviors, weakened signals of anxiety and fear, and decreased self-esteem. Taken together, these findings may account for some of the variance in the psychological and behavioral patterns of youth with conduct disorder.

===Intra-individual factors===
Aside from findings related to neurological and neurochemical profiles of youth with conduct disorder, intraindividual factors such as genetics may also be relevant. Having a sibling or parent with conduct disorder increases the likelihood of having the disorder, with a heritability rate of .53. There also tends to be a stronger genetic link for individuals with childhood-onset compared to adolescent onset. In addition, youth with conduct disorder also exhibit polymorphism in the monoamine oxidase A gene, low resting heart rates, and increased testosterone.

===Family and peer influences===
Elements of the family and social environment may also play a role in the development and maintenance of conduct disorder. For instance, antisocial behavior suggestive of conduct disorder is associated with single parent status, parental divorce, large family size, and the young age of mothers. However, these factors are difficult to tease apart from other demographic variables that are known to be linked with conduct disorder, including poverty and low socioeconomic status. Family functioning and parent–child interactions also play a substantial role in childhood aggression and conduct disorder, with low levels of parental involvement, inadequate supervision, and unpredictable discipline practices reinforcing youth&#x27;s defiant behaviors. Moreover, maternal depression has a significant impact on conduct disordered children and can lead to negative reciprocal feedback between the mother and conduct disordered child. Peer influences have also been related to the development of antisocial behavior in youth, particularly peer rejection in childhood and association with deviant peers. Peer rejection is not only a marker of a number of externalizing disorders, but also a contributing factor for the continuity of the disorders over time. Hinshaw and Lee (2003) also explain that association with deviant peers has been thought to influence the development of conduct disorder in two ways: 1) a &quot;selection&quot; process whereby youth with aggressive characteristics choose deviant friends, and 2) a &quot;facilitation&quot; process whereby deviant peer networks bolster patterns of antisocial behavior. In a separate study by Bonin and colleagues, parenting programs were shown to positively affect child behavior and reduce costs to the public sector.

===Wider contextual factors===
In addition to the individual and social factors associated with conduct disorder, research has highlighted the importance of environment and context in youth with antisocial behavior. However, it is important to note that these are not static factors, but rather transactional in nature (e.g., individuals are influenced by and also influence their environment). For instance, neighborhood safety and exposure to violence have been studied in conjunction with conduct disorder, but it is not simply the case that youth with aggressive tendencies reside in violent neighborhoods. Transactional models propose that youth may resort to violence more often as a result of exposure to community violence, but their predisposition towards violence also contributes to neighborhood climate.

==Diagnosis==
Conduct disorder is classified in the fourth edition of &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM). It is diagnosed based on a prolonged pattern of antisocial behaviour such as serious violation of laws and social norms and rules in people younger than the age of 18. Similar criteria are used in those over the age of 18 for the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder. No proposed revisions for the main criteria of conduct disorder exist in the &quot;DSM-5&quot;; there is a recommendation by the work group to add an additional specifier for callous and unemotional traits. According to DSM-5 criteria for conduct disorder, there are four categories that could be present in the child&#x27;s behavior: aggression to people and animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness or theft, and serious violation of rules.

Almost all adolescents who have a substance use disorder have conduct disorder-like traits, but after successful treatment of the substance use disorder, about half of these adolescents no longer display conduct disorder-like symptoms. Therefore, it is important to exclude a substance-induced cause and instead address the substance use disorder prior to making a psychiatric diagnosis of conduct disorder.

==Treatment==
First-line treatment is psychotherapy based on behavior modification and problem-solving skills. This treatment seeks to integrate individual, school, and family settings. Parent-management training can also be helpful. No medications have been FDA approved for conduct disorder, but risperidone (a second-generation antipsychotic) has the most evidence to support its use for aggression in children who have not responded to behavioral and psychosocial interventions. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are also sometimes used to treat irritability in these patients.

==Prognosis==
About 25–40% of youths diagnosed with conduct disorder qualify for a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder when they reach adulthood. For those that do not develop ASPD, most still exhibit social dysfunction in adult life.

==Epidemiology==
Conduct disorder is estimated to affect 51.1 million people globally as of 2013. The percentage of children affected by conduct disorder is estimated to range from 1–10%. However, among incarcerated youth or youth in juvenile detention facilities, rates of conduct disorder are between 23% and 87%.

===Sex differences===
The majority of research on conduct disorder suggests that there are a significantly greater number of males than females with the diagnosis, with some reports demonstrating a threefold to fourfold difference in prevalence. However, this difference may be somewhat biased by the diagnostic criteria which focus on more overt behaviors, such as aggression and fighting, which are more often exhibited by males. Females are more likely to be characterized by covert behaviors, such as stealing or running away. Moreover, conduct disorder in females is linked to several negative outcomes, such as antisocial personality disorder and early pregnancy, suggesting that sex differences in disruptive behaviors need to be more fully understood.

Females are more responsive to peer pressure including feelings of guilt than males.

===Racial differences===
Research on racial or cultural differences on the prevalence or presentation of conduct disorder is limited. However, according to studies on American youth, it appears that black youths are more often diagnosed with conduct disorder, while Asian youths are about one-third as likely to be diagnosed with conduct disorder when compared to white youths. It has been widely theorized for decades that this disparity is due to unconscious bias in those who give the diagnosis.

<doc id="159211" wikidata="Q183216" url="?curid=159211" title="Analytic philosophy">
<text>Analytic philosophy is a broad movement within Western philosophy, especially anglophone philosophy, focused on analysis as a philosophical method. It is characterized by a clarity of prose; rigor in arguments; and making use of formal logic and mathematics, and, to a lesser degree, the natural sciences. It is further characterized by an interest in language, semantics and meaning, known as the linguistic turn. It has developed several new branches of philosophy and logic, notably philosophy of language, philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of science, modern predicate logic and mathematical logic.

The proliferation of analysis in philosophy began around the turn of the 20th century and has been dominant since the latter half of the 20th century. Central figures in its historical development are Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, G. E. Moore, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Other important figures in its history include Franz Brentano, the logical positivists (particularly Rudolf Carnap), the ordinary language philosophers, W. V. O. Quine, and Karl Popper. After the decline of logical positivism, Saul Kripke, David Lewis, and others led a revival in metaphysics.

Analytic philosophy is often contrasted with continental philosophy, which was coined as a catch-all term for other methods that were prominent in continental Europe, most notably existentialism, phenomenology, and Hegelianism. There is widespread influence and debate between the analytic and continental traditions; some philosophers see the differences between the two traditions as being based on institutions, relationships, and ideology, rather than anything of significant philosophical substance. The distinction has also been drawn between &quot;analytic&quot; being academic or technical philosophy and &quot;continental&quot; being literary philosophy.
== Emergence in Germany and Austria ==

Analytic philosophy was deeply influenced by what is called Austrian realism in the former state of Austria-Hungary, so much so that Michael Dummett has remarked that analytic philosophy is better characterized as Anglo-Austrian rather than the usual Anglo-American.

University of Vienna philosopher and psychologist Franz Brentano—in &quot;Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint&quot; (1874) and through the subsequent influence of the School of Brentano and its members, such as Edmund Husserl and Alexius Meinong—gave to analytic philosophy the problem of intentionality or of aboutness. For Brentano, all mental events have a real, non-mental intentional object, which the thinking is directed at or &quot;about&quot;.

Meinong is known for his unique ontology of real nonexistent objects as a solution to the problem of empty names. The Graz School followed Meinong. The Polish Lwów–Warsaw school, founded by Kazimierz Twardowski in 1895, grew as an offshoot of the Graz School. It was closely associated with the Warsaw School of Mathematics.

=== Frege ===

Gottlob Frege (1848–1925) was a German geometry professor at the University of Jena who is understood as the father of analytic philosophy. Frege proved influential as a philosopher of mathematics in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century. He advocated logicism, the project of reducing arithmetic to pure logic.

==== Logic ====
As a result of his logicist project, Frege developed predicate logic in his book &quot;Begriffsschrift&quot; (English: &quot;Concept-script&quot;, 1879), which allowed for a much greater range of sentences to be parsed into logical form than was possible using the ancient Aristotelian logic. An example of this is the problem of multiple generality.

==== Number ====
Neo-Kantianism dominated the late 19th century in German philosophy. Edmund Husserl&#x27;s 1891 book &quot;Philosophie der Arithmetik&quot; argued that the concept of the cardinal number derived from psychical acts of grouping objects and counting them.

In contrast to this &quot;psychologism&quot;, Frege in &quot;The Foundations of Arithmetic&quot; (1884) and &quot;The Basic Laws of Arithmetic&quot; (, 1893–1903), argued similarly to Plato or Bolzano that mathematics and logic have their own public objects, independent of the private judgments or mental states of individual mathematicians and logicians. Following Frege, the logicists tended to advocate a kind of mathematical Platonism.

==== Language ====
Frege also proved influential in the philosophy of language and analytic philosophy&#x27;s interest in meaning. Michael Dummett traces the linguistic turn to Frege&#x27;s &quot;Foundations of Arithmetic&quot; and his context principle.

Frege&#x27;s paper &quot;On Sense and Reference&quot; (1892) is seminal, containing Frege&#x27;s puzzles and providing a mediated reference theory. His paper &quot;The Thought: A Logical Inquiry&quot; (1918) reflects both his anti-idealism or anti-psychologism and his interest in language. In the paper, he argues for a Platonist account of propositions or thoughts.

== Emergence in Great Britain ==

British philosophy in the 19th century had seen a revival of logic started by Richard Whately, in reaction to the anti-logical tradition of British empiricism. The major figure of this period is English mathematician George Boole. Other figures include William Hamilton, Augustus De Morgan, William Stanley Jevons, &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; author Lewis Carroll, Hugh MacColl, and American pragmatist Charles Sanders Peirce.

However, British philosophy in the late 19th century was dominated by British idealism, a neo-Hegelian movement, as taught by philosophers such as F. H. Bradley (1846–1924) and T. H. Green (1836–1882).

=== Russell ===
Analytic philosophy in the narrower sense of 20th and 21st century anglophone philosophy is usually thought to begin with Cambridge philosophers Bertrand Russell and G. E. Moore&#x27;s rejection of Hegelianism for being obscure; or the &quot;revolt against idealism&quot;—see for example Moore&#x27;s &quot;A Defence of Common Sense&quot;. Russell summed up Moore&#x27;s influence:
An important aspect of Hegelianism and British idealism was logical holism—the opinion that there are aspects of the world that can be known only by knowing the whole world. This is closely related to the doctrine of internal relations, the opinion that relations between items are &quot;internal relations&quot;, that is, essential properties of the nature of those items. Russell and Moore in response promulgated logical atomism and the doctrine of &quot;external relations&quot;—the belief that the world consists of independent facts.

Inspired by developments in modern formal logic, the early Russell claimed that the problems of philosophy can be solved by showing the simple constituents of complex notions. Logical form would be made clear by syntax.

For example, the English word &quot;is&quot; has three distinct meanings, which predicate logic can express as follows:
* For the sentence &#x27;the cat &quot;is&quot; asleep&#x27;, the &quot;is&quot; of predication means that &quot;x is P&quot; (denoted as P(x)).
* For the sentence &#x27;there &quot;is&quot; a cat&#x27;, the &quot;is&quot; of existence means that &quot;there is an x&quot; (∃x).
* For the sentence &#x27;three &quot;is&quot; half of six&#x27;, the &quot;is&quot; of identity means that &quot;x is the same as y&quot; (x=y).

From about 1910 to 1930, analytic philosophers like Frege, Russell, Moore, and Russell&#x27;s student Ludwig Wittgenstein emphasized creating an ideal language for philosophical analysis, which would be free from the ambiguities of ordinary language that, in their opinion, often made philosophers incorrect.

==== Paradox ====
Russell famously discovered the paradox in Basic Law V which undermined Frege&#x27;s logicist project. However, like Frege, Russell argued that mathematics is reducible to logical fundamentals, in &quot;The Principles of Mathematics&quot; (1903). He also argued for Meinongianism.

==== &quot;On Denoting&quot; ====
During his early career, Russell adopted Frege&#x27;s predicate logic as his primary philosophical method, thinking it could expose the underlying structure of philosophical problems. This was done most famously in his theory of definite descriptions in &quot;On Denoting&quot;, published in &quot;Mind&quot; in 1905. Russell here argues against Meinongianism. He argues all names (aside from demonstratives like &quot;this&quot; or &quot;that&quot;) are disguised definite descriptions, using this to solve ascriptions of nonexistence. This position came to be called descriptivism.

==== &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; ====
Later, his book written with Alfred North Whitehead, &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; (1910–1913), the seminal text of classical logic and of the logicist project, encouraged many philosophers to renew their interest in the development of symbolic logic. It used a notation from Italian logician Giuseppe Peano, and it uses a theory of types to avoid the pitfalls of Russell&#x27;s paradox. Whitehead developed process metaphysics in &quot;Process and Reality&quot;.

=== Early Wittgenstein ===

Ludwig Wittgenstein developed a comprehensive system of logical atomism with a picture theory of meaning in his &quot;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus&quot; (, 1921) sometimes known as simply the &quot;Tractatus&quot;. He claimed the universe is the totality of actual states of affairs and that these states of affairs can be expressed and mirrored by the language of first-order predicate logic. Thus, a picture of the universe can be constructed by expressing facts in the form of atomic propositions and linking them using logical operators.

Wittgenstein thought he had solved all the problems of philosophy with the &quot;Tractatus&quot;. The work further ultimately concludes that all of its propositions are meaningless, illustrated with a ladder one must toss away after climbing up it.

=== Logical positivism ===

During the late 1920s to 1940s, a group of philosophers known as the Vienna Circle, and another one known as the Berlin Circle, developed Russell and Wittgenstein&#x27;s philosophy into a doctrine known as &quot;logical positivism&quot; (or logical empiricism). The Vienna Circle was led by Moritz Schlick and included Rudolf Carnap and Otto Neurath. The Berlin Circle was led by Hans Reichenbach and included Carl Hempel and mathematician David Hilbert.

Logical positivists used formal logical methods to develop an empiricist account of knowledge. They adopted the verification principle, according to which every meaningful statement is either analytic or synthetic. The truths of logic and mathematics were tautologies, and those of science were verifiable empirical claims. These two constituted the entire universe of meaningful judgments; anything else was nonsense.

This led the logical positivists to reject many traditional problems of philosophy, especially those of metaphysics, as meaningless. It had the additional effect of making (ethical and aesthetic) value judgments (as well as religious statements and beliefs) meaningless. Logical positivists therefore typically considered philosophy as having a minimal function. For them, philosophy concerned the clarification of thoughts, rather than having a distinct subject matter of its own.

Several logical positivists were Jewish, such as Neurath, Hans Hahn, Philipp Frank, Friedrich Waissmann, and Reichenbach. Others, like Carnap, were gentiles but socialists or pacifists. With the coming to power of Adolf Hitler and Nazism in 1933, many members of the Vienna and Berlin Circles fled to Britain and the United States, which helped to reinforce the dominance of logical positivism and analytic philosophy in anglophone countries.

In 1936, Schlick was murdered in Vienna by his former student Hans Nelböck. The same year, A. J. Ayer&#x27;s work &quot;Language Truth and Logic&quot; introduced the English speaking world to logical positivism.

The logical positivists saw their rejection of metaphysics in some ways as a recapitulation of a quote by David Hume:

If we take in our hand any volume; of divinity or school metaphysics, for instance; let us ask, Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number? No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence? No. Commit it then to the flames: for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion.

== Ordinary language ==
After World War II, from the late 1940s to the 1950s, analytic philosophy became involved with ordinary-language analysis. This resulted in two main trends.

=== Later Wittgenstein ===
One strain of language analysis continued Wittgenstein&#x27;s later philosophy, from the &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot; (1953), which differed dramatically from his early work of the &quot;Tractatus&quot;. The criticisms of Frank P. Ramsey on color and logical form in the &quot;Tractatus&quot; led to some of Wittgenstein&#x27;s first doubts with regard to his early philosophy. Philosophers refer to them like two different philosophers: &quot;early Wittgenstein&quot; and &quot;later Wittgenstein&quot;. In his later philosophy, Wittgenstein develops the concept of a &quot;language-game&quot; and, rather than his prior picture theory of meaning, advocates a theory of meaning as use. It also contains the private language argument and the notion of family resemblance.

=== Oxford philosophy ===
The other trend was known as &quot;Oxford philosophy&quot;, in contrast to earlier analytic Cambridge philosophers (including the early Wittgenstein) who thought philosophers should avoid the deceptive trappings of natural language by constructing ideal languages. Influenced by Moore&#x27;s &quot;Common Sense&quot; and what they perceived as the later Wittgenstein&#x27;s quietism, the Oxford philosophers claimed that ordinary language already represents many subtle distinctions not recognized in the formulation of traditional philosophical theories or problems.
While schools such as logical positivism emphasize logical terms, which are supposed to be universal and separate from contingent factors (such as culture, language, historical conditions), ordinary-language philosophy emphasizes the use of language by ordinary people. The most prominent ordinary-language philosophers during the 1950s were P. F. Strawson, J. L. Austin, and Gilbert Ryle.

Ordinary-language philosophers often sought to resolve philosophical problems by showing them to be the result of misunderstanding ordinary language. Ryle, in &quot;The Concept of Mind&quot; (1949), criticized Cartesian dualism, arguing in favor of disposing of &quot;Descartes&#x27; myth&quot; via recognizing &quot;category errors&quot;.

Strawson first became well known with his article &quot;On Referring&quot; (1950), a criticism of Russell&#x27;s theory of descriptions explained in the latter&#x27;s famous &quot;On Denoting&quot; article. In his book &quot;Individuals&quot; (1959), Strawson examines our conceptions of basic particulars. Austin, in the posthumously published &quot;How to Do Things with Words&quot; (1962), emphasized the theory of speech acts and the ability of words to do things (e.g. &quot;I promise&quot;) and not just say things. This influenced several fields to undertake what is called a performative turn. In &quot;Sense and Sensibilia&quot; (1962), Austin criticized sense-data theories.

== Spread ==

=== Australia and New Zealand ===
The school known as Australian realism began when John Anderson accepted the Challis Chair of Philosophy at the University of Sydney in 1927. His elder brother was William Anderson, Professor of Philosophy at Auckland University College from 1921 to his death in 1955, who was described as &quot;the most dominant figure in New Zealand philosophy.&quot; J. N. Findlay was a student of Ernst Mally of the Austrian realists and taught at the University of Otago.

=== Finland ===
The Finnish Georg Henrik von Wright succeeded Wittgenstein at Cambridge in 1948.

== Contemporary developments ==

=== Metaphysics ===

One difference with respect to early analytic philosophy was the revival of metaphysical theorizing during the second half of the 20th century, and metaphysics remains a fertile topic of research. Although many discussions are continuations of old ones from previous decades and centuries, the debates remains active.

==== Decline of logical positivism ====
The rise of metaphysics mirrored the decline of logical positivism, first challenged by the later Wittgenstein.

===== Sellars =====
Wilfred Sellars&#x27;s criticism of the &quot;Myth of the Given&quot;, in &quot;Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind&quot; (1956), challenged logical positivism by arguing against sense-data theories. In his &quot;Philosophy and the Scientific Image of Man&quot; (1962), Sellars distinguishes between the &quot;manifest image&quot; and the &quot;scientific image&quot; of the world. Sellars&#x27;s goal of a synoptic philosophy that unites the everyday and scientific views of reality is the foundation and archetype of what is sometimes called the Pittsburgh School, whose members include Robert Brandom, John McDowell, and John Haugeland.

===== Quine =====
Also among the developments that resulted in the decline of logical positivism and the revival of metaphysical theorizing was Harvard philosopher W. V. O. Quine&#x27;s attack on the analytic–synthetic distinction in &quot;Two Dogmas of Empiricism&quot;, published in 1951 in &quot;The Philosophical Review&quot; and republished in Quine&#x27;s book &quot;From A Logical Point of View&quot; (1953), a paper &quot;sometimes regarded as the most important in all of twentieth-century philosophy&quot;.

&quot;From a Logical Point of View&quot; also contains Quine&#x27;s essay &quot;&quot; (1948), which elucidates Russell&#x27;s theory of descriptions and contains Quine&#x27;s famous dictum of ontological commitment, &quot;To be is to be the value of a variable&quot;. He also dubbed the problem of nonexistence Plato&#x27;s beard.

Quine sought to naturalize philosophy and saw philosophy as continuous with science, but instead of logical positivism advocated a kind of semantic holism and ontological relativity, which explained that every term in any statement has its meaning contingent on a vast network of knowledge and belief, the speaker&#x27;s conception of the entire world. In his magnum opus &quot;Word and Object&quot; (1960), Quine introduces the idea of radical translation, an introduction to his theory of the indeterminacy of translation, and specifically to prove the inscrutability of reference.

===== Kripke =====
Important also for the revival of metaphysics was the further development of modal logic, first introduced by pragmatist C. I. Lewis, especially the work of Saul Kripke and his &quot;Naming and Necessity&quot; (1980).

According to one author, &quot;Naming and Necessity&quot; &quot;played a large role in the implicit, but widespread, rejection of the view—so popular among ordinary language philosophers—that philosophy is nothing more than the analysis of language.&quot;

Kripke was influential in arguing that flaws in common theories of descriptions and proper names are indicative of larger misunderstandings of the metaphysics of necessity and possibility. Kripke also argued that necessity is a metaphysical notion distinct from the epistemic notion of &quot;a priori&quot;, and that there are necessary truths that are known &quot;a posteriori&quot;, such as that water is H2O.

Kripke is widely regarded as having revived theories of essence and identity as respectable topics of philosophical discussion. Kripke and Hilary Putnam argued for realism about natural kinds. Kripke holds that it is essential that water is H2O, or for gold to be atomic number 79. Putnam&#x27;s Twin Earth thought experiment can be used to illustrate the same point with water.

===== David Lewis =====
American philosopher David Lewis defended a number of elaborate metaphysical theories. In works such as &quot;On the Plurality of Worlds&quot; (1986) and &quot;Counterfactuals&quot; (1973) he argued for modal realism and counterpart theorythe belief in real, concrete possible worlds. According to Lewis, &quot;actual&quot; is merely an indexical label we give a world when we are in it. Lewis also defended what he called Humean supervenience, a counterfactual theory of causation, and contributed to abstract object theory. He became closely associated with Australia, whose philosophical community he visited almost annually for more than 30 years.

==== Universals ====
In response to the problem of universals, Australian David Malet Armstrong defended a kind of moderate realism. Quine and Lewis defended nominalism.

==== Mereology ====
Polish philosopher Stanisław Leśniewski coined the term mereology, which is the formal study of parts and wholes, a subject that arguably goes back to the time of the pre-Socratics. David Lewis believed in perdurantism and introduced the term &#x27;gunk&#x27;. Peter Van Inwagen believes in mereological nihilism, except for living beings, a view called organicism.

==== Free will and determinism ====
Peter van Inwagen&#x27;s 1983 monograph &quot;An Essay on Free Will&quot; played an important role in rehabilitating libertarianism with respect to free will, in mainstream analytical philosophy. In the book, he introduces the consequence argument and the term incompatibilism about free will and determinism, to stand in contrast to compatibilism—the view that free will is compatible with determinism. Charlie Broad had previously made similar arguments.

==== Personal identity ====
Since John Locke, philosophers have been concerned with the problem of personal identity. Derek Parfit in &quot;Reasons and Persons&quot; (1984) defends a kind of bundle theory, while David Lewis again defends perdurantism. Bernard Williams in &quot;The Self and the Future&quot; (1970) argues that personal identity is bodily identity rather than mental continuity.

==== Principle of sufficient reason ====
Since Leibniz philosophers have discussed the principle of sufficient reason or PSR. Van Inwagen criticizes the PSR. Alexander Pruss defends it.

==== Philosophy of time ====
Analytic philosophy of time traces its roots to the British idealist J. M. E. McTaggart&#x27;s article &quot;The Unreality of Time&quot; (1908). In it, McTaggart distinguishes between the dynamic, A-, or tensed, theory of time (past, present, future), in which time flows; and the static or tenseless B-theory of time (earlier than, simultaneous with, later than). Eternalism holds that past, present, and future are equally real. In contrast, Presentism holds that only entities in the present exist.

The theory of special relativity seems to advocate a B-theory of time. David Lewis&#x27;s perdurantism, or four-dimensionalism, requires a B-theory of time. A. N. Prior, who invented tense logic, advocated the A-theory of time.

==== Logical pluralism ====
Many-valued and non-classical logics have been popular since the Polish logician Jan Lukasiewicz. Graham Priest is a dialetheist, seeing it as the most natural solution to problems such as the liar paradox. JC Beall, together with Greg Restall, is a pioneer of a widely-discussed version of logical pluralism.

=== Epistemology ===
==== Justification ====

===== Gettier =====
Owing largely to Edmund Gettier&#x27;s 1963 paper &quot;Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?&quot;, and the so-called Gettier problem, epistemology has enjoyed a resurgence as a topic of analytic philosophy during the last 50 years. A large portion of current epistemological research is intended to resolve the problems that Gettier&#x27;s examples presented to the traditional &quot;justified true belief&quot; model of knowledge, found as early as Plato&#x27;s dialogue &quot;Theaetetus&quot;. These include developing theories of justification to deal with Gettier&#x27;s examples, or giving alternatives to the justified-true-belief model.

===== Theories =====
Chisholm defended foundationalism. Quine defended coherentism, a &quot;web of belief&quot;. Quine proposed naturalized epistemology.

====== Internalism and externalism ======
The debate between internalism and externalism still exists in analytic philosophy. Alvin Goldman is an externalist known for developing a popular form of externalism called reliabilism. Most externalists reject the KK thesis, which has been disputed since the introduction of the epistemic logic by Jaakko Hintikka in 1962.

==== Problem of the Criterion ====
While a problem since antiquity, American philosopher Roderick Chisholm, in his &quot;Theory of Knowledge&quot;, details the problem of the criterion with two sets of questions:

# What do we know? or What is the extent of our knowledge?
# How do we know? or What is the criterion for deciding whether we have knowledge in any particular case?

An answer to either set of questions will allow us to devise a means of answering the other. Answering the former question-set first is called &quot;particularism&quot;, whereas answering the latter set first is called &quot;methodism&quot;. A third solution is &quot;skepticism&quot;, or doubting there is such a thing as knowledge.

==== Truth ====
Frege questioned standard theories of truth, and sometimes advocated a redundancy theory of truth. Frank Ramsey also advocated a redundancy theory. Alfred Tarski put forward a semantic theory of truth.

In &quot;Truth-Makers&quot; (1984), Kevin Mulligan, Peter Simons, and Barry Smith introduced the truth-maker idea as a contribution to the correspondence theory of truth. A truth-maker is contrasted with a truth-bearer.

==== Closure ====
Epistemic closure is the claim that knowledge is closed under entailment; in other words epistemic closure is a property or the principle that if a subject formula_1 knows formula_2, and formula_1 knows that formula_2 entails formula_5, then formula_1 can thereby come to know formula_5. Most epistemological theories involve a closure principle, and many skeptical arguments assume a closure principle. In &quot;Proof of An External World&quot;, G. E. Moore uses closure in his famous anti-skeptical &quot;here is one hand&quot; argument. Shortly before his death, Wittgenstein wrote &quot;On Certainty&quot; in response to Moore.

While the principle of epistemic closure is generally regarded as intuitive, philosophers, such as Fred Dretske with relevant alternatives theory and Robert Nozick in &quot;Philosophical Explanations&quot;, have argued against it.

==== Induction ====
In his book &quot;Fact, Fiction, and Forecast&quot;, Nelson Goodman introduced the &quot;new riddle of induction&quot;, so-called by analogy with Hume&#x27;s classical problem of induction. Goodman&#x27;s famous example was to introduce the predicates grue and bleen. &quot;Grue&quot; applies to all things before a certain time &quot;t&quot;, just in case they are green, but also just in case they are blue after time &quot;t&quot;; and &quot;bleen&quot; applies to all things before a certain time &quot;t&quot;, just in the case they are blue, but also just in case they are green after time &quot;t&quot;.

==== Other topics ====
Other, related topics of contemporary research include debates over basic knowledge, the nature of evidence, the value of knowledge, epistemic luck, virtue epistemology, the role of intuitions in justification, and treating knowledge as a primitive concept.

=== Ethics ===
Due to the commitments to empiricism and symbolic logic in the early analytic period, early analytic philosophers often thought that inquiry in the ethical domain could not be made rigorous enough to merit any attention. It was only with the emergence of ordinary-language philosophers that ethics started to become an acceptable area of inquiry for analytic philosophers. Philosophers working within the analytic tradition have gradually come to distinguish three major types of moral philosophy.

* Meta-ethics, which investigates moral terms and concepts;
* Normative ethics, which examines and produces normative ethical judgments;
* Applied ethics, which investigates how existing normative principles should be applied to difficult or borderline cases, often cases created by new technology or new scientific knowledge.

==== Meta-ethics ====
As well as Hume&#x27;s famous is/ought distinction, twentieth-century meta-ethics has two original strains.

===== &quot;Principia Ethica&quot; =====
The first is G. E. Moore&#x27;s investigation into the nature of ethical terms (e.g., good) in his &quot;Principia Ethica&quot; (1903), which advances a kind of moral realism called ethical non-naturalism and is known for the open question argument and identifying the naturalistic fallacy, a major topic of investigation for analytical philosophers. According to Moore, &quot;Goodness is a simple, undefinable, non-natural property.&quot;

Contemporary philosophers, such as Russ Shafer-Landau in &quot;Moral Realism: A Defence&quot;, defend ethical non-naturalism.

===== Emotivism =====
The second is founded on logical positivism and its attitude that unverifiable statements are meaningless. As a result, they avoided normative ethics and instead began meta-ethical investigations into the nature of moral terms, statements, and judgments.

The logical positivists opined that statements about value—including all ethical and aesthetic judgments—are non-cognitive; that is, they cannot be objectively verified or falsified. Instead, the logical positivists adopted an emotivist theory, which was that value judgments expressed the attitude of the speaker. It is also known as the boo/hurrah theory. For example, in this view, saying, &quot;Murder is wrong&quot;, is equivalent to saying, &quot;Boo to murder&quot;, or saying the word &quot;murder&quot; with a particular tone of disapproval.

While analytic philosophers generally accepted non-cognitivism, emotivism had many deficiencies. It evolved into more sophisticated non-cognitivist theories, such as the expressivism of Charles Stevenson, and the universal prescriptivism of R. M. Hare, which was based on J. L. Austin&#x27;s philosophy of speech acts.

===== Critics =====
As non-cognitivism, the is/ought distinction, and the naturalistic fallacy were questioned, analytic philosophers showed a renewed interest in the traditional questions of moral philosophy.

Philippa Foot defended naturalist moral realism and contributed several essays attacking other theories. Foot introduced the famous &quot;trolley problem&quot; into the ethical discourse.

Perhaps the most influential critic was Elizabeth Anscombe, whose monograph &quot;Intention&quot; was called by Donald Davidson &quot;the most important treatment of action since Aristotle&quot;. A favorite student and friend of Ludwig Wittgenstein, her 1958 article &quot;Modern Moral Philosophy&quot; declared the &quot;is-ought&quot; impasse to be unproductive. J.O. Urmson&#x27;s article &quot;On Grading&quot; also called the is/ought distinction into question.

Australian J. L. Mackie, in &quot;Ethics: Inventing Right And Wrong&quot;, defended anti-realist error theory. Bernard Williams also influenced ethics by advocating a kind of moral relativism and rejecting all other theories.

==== Normative ethics ====
The first half of the 20th century was marked by skepticism toward, and neglect of, normative ethics. However, contemporary normative ethics is dominated by three schools: consequentialism, virtue ethics, and deontology.

===== Consequentialism, or Utilitarianism =====

During the early 20th century, utilitarianism was the only non-skeptical type of ethics to remain popular among analytic philosophers. However, as the influence of logical positivism declined mid-century, analytic philosophers had a renewed interest in ethics. &quot;Utilitarianism: For and Against&quot; was written with J. J. C. Smart arguing for and Bernard Williams arguing against.

===== Virtue ethics =====
Anscombe, Foot, and Alasdair Macintyre&#x27;s &quot;After Virtue&quot; sparked a revival of Aristotle&#x27;s virtue ethical approach. This increased interest in virtue ethics has been dubbed the &quot;aretaic turn&quot; mimicking the linguistic turn.

===== Deontology =====
John Rawls&#x27;s 1971 &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot; restored interest in Kantian ethical philosophy.

==== Applied ethics ====
Since around 1970, a significant feature of analytic philosophy has been the emergence of applied ethics—an interest in the application of moral principles to specific practical issues. The philosophers following this orientation view ethics as involving humanistic values, which involve practical implications and applications in the way people interact and lead their lives socially.

Topics of special interest for applied ethics include environmental ethics, animal rights, and the many challenges created by advancing medical science. In education, applied ethics addressed themes such as punishment in schools, equality of educational opportunity, and education for democracy.

===Political philosophy===

====Liberalism====
Isaiah Berlin had a lasting influence on both analytic political philosophy and liberalism with his lecture &quot;Two Concepts of Liberty&quot;. Berlin defined &#x27;negative liberty&#x27; as absence of coercion or interference in private actions. &#x27;Positive liberty&#x27; Berlin maintained, could be thought of as self-mastery, which asks not what we are free from, but what we are free to do.

Current analytic political philosophy owes much to John Rawls, who in a series of papers from the 1950s onward (most notably &quot;Two Concepts of Rules&quot; and &quot;Justice as Fairness&quot;) and his 1971 book &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot;, produced a sophisticated defense of a generally liberal egalitarian account of distributive justice. Rawls introduced the term the veil of ignorance.

This was followed soon by Rawls&#x27;s colleague Robert Nozick&#x27;s book &quot;Anarchy, State, and Utopia&quot;, a defense of free-market libertarianism. Consequentialist libertarianism also derives from the analytic tradition .

During recent decades there have also been several critics of liberalism, including the feminist critiques by Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin, the multiculturalist critiques by Amy Gutmann and Charles Taylor, and the communitarian critiques by Michael Sandel and Alasdair MacIntyre (although neither of them endorses the term).

==== Analytical Marxism ====
Another development of political philosophy was the emergence of the school of analytical Marxism. Members of this school seek to apply techniques of analytic philosophy and modern social science to clarify the theories of Karl Marx and his successors. The best-known member of this school is G. A. Cohen, whose 1978 book, &quot;Karl Marx&#x27;s Theory of History: A Defence&quot;, is generally considered to represent the genesis of this school. In that book, Cohen used logical and linguistic analysis to clarify and defend Marx&#x27;s materialist conception of history. Other prominent analytical Marxists include the economist John Roemer, the social scientist Jon Elster, and the sociologist Erik Olin Wright. The work of these later philosophers has furthered Cohen&#x27;s work by bringing to bear modern social science methods, such as rational choice theory, to supplement Cohen&#x27;s use of analytic philosophical techniques in the interpretation of Marxian theory.

Cohen himself would later engage directly with Rawlsian political philosophy to advance a socialist theory of justice that contrasts with both traditional Marxism and the theories advanced by Rawls and Nozick. In particular, he indicates Marx&#x27;s principle of from each according to his ability, to each according to his need.

Although not an analytic philosopher, Jürgen Habermas is another influential—if controversial—author in contemporary analytic political philosophy, whose social theory is a blend of social science, Marxism, neo-Kantianism, and American pragmatism.

==== Communitarianism ====
Communitarians such as Alasdair MacIntyre, Charles Taylor, Michael Walzer, and Michael Sandel advance a critique of liberalism that uses analytic techniques to isolate the main assumptions of liberal individualists, such as Rawls, and then challenges these assumptions. In particular, communitarians challenge the liberal assumption that the individual can be considered as fully autonomous from the community in which he is brought up and lives. Instead, they argue for a conception of the individual that emphasizes the role that the community plays in forming his or her values, thought processes, and opinions. While in the analytic tradition, its major exponents often also engage at length with figures generally considered continental, notably G. W. F. Hegel and Friedrich Nietzsche.

===Aesthetics===
As a result of logical positivism, as well as what seemed like rejections of the traditional aesthetic notions of beauty and sublimity from post-modern thinkers, analytic philosophers were slow to consider art and aesthetic judgment. Susanne Langer and Nelson Goodman addressed these problems in an analytic style during the 1950s and 1960s. Since Goodman, aesthetics as a discipline for analytic philosophers has flourished.

Arthur Danto argued for a &quot;institutional definition of art&quot; in the 1964 essay &quot;The Artworld&quot; in which Danto coined the term &quot;artworld&quot; (as opposed to the existing &quot;art world&quot;, though they mean the same), by which he meant cultural context or &quot;an atmosphere of art theory&quot;.

Rigorous efforts to pursue analyses of traditional aesthetic concepts were performed by Guy Sircello in the 1970s and 1980s, resulting in new analytic theories of love, sublimity, and beauty. In the opinion of Władysław Tatarkiewicz, there are six conditions for the presentation of art: beauty, form, representation, reproduction of reality, artistic expression, and innovation. However, one may not be able to pin down these qualities in a work of art.

George Dickie was an influential philosopher of art. Dickie&#x27;s student Noël Carroll is a leading philosopher of art.

=== Philosophy of language ===
Given the linguistic turn, it can be hard to separate logic, metaphysics, and the philosophy of language in analytic philosophy. Philosophy of language is a topic that has decreased in activity during the last four decades, as evidenced by the fact that few major philosophers today treat it as a primary research topic. While the debate remains fierce, it is still strongly influenced by those authors from the first half of the century, e.g. Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein, Austin, Tarski, and Quine.

==== Semantics ====
Saul Kripke provided a semantics for modal logic. In his book &quot;Naming and Necessity&quot; (1980), Kripke challenges the descriptivist theory with a causal theory of reference. In it he introduced the term rigid designator. According to one author, &quot;In the philosophy of language, &quot;Naming and Necessity&quot; is among the most important works ever.&quot; Ruth Barcan Marcus also challenged descriptivism. So did Keith Donnellan.

Hilary Putnam used the Twin Earth thought experiment to argue for semantic externalism, or the view that the meanings of words are not psychological. Donald Davidson uses the thought experiment of Swampman to advocate for semantic externalism.

Kripke in &quot;Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language&quot; provides a rule-following paradox that undermines the possibility of our ever following rules in our use of language and, so, calls into question the idea of meaning. Kripke writes that this paradox is &quot;the most radical and original skeptical problem that philosophy has seen to date&quot;. The portmanteau &quot;Kripkenstein&quot; has been coined as a term for a fictional person who holds the views expressed by Kripke&#x27;s reading of Wittgenstein.

Another influential philosopher, Pavel Tichý initiated Transparent Intensional Logic, an original theory of the logical analysis of natural languages—the theory is devoted to the problem of saying exactly what it is that we learn, know, and can communicate when we come to understand what a sentence means.

==== Pragmatics ====
Paul Grice and his maxims and theory of implicature established the discipline of pragmatics.

=== Philosophy of mind and cognitive science ===

John Searle suggests that the obsession with the philosophy of language during the 20th century has been superseded by an emphasis on the philosophy of mind.

==== Physicalism ====
Motivated by the logical positivists&#x27; interest in verificationism, logical behaviorism was the most prominent theory of mind of analytic philosophy for the first half of the 20th century. Behaviorism later became much less popular, in favor of either type physicalism or functionalism. During this period, topics of the philosophy of mind were often related strongly to topics of cognitive science, such as modularity or innateness.

===== Behaviorism =====
Behaviorists such as B. F. Skinner tended to opine either that statements about the mind were equivalent to &quot;statements about&quot; behavior and dispositions to behave in particular ways or that mental states were directly equivalent to behavior and dispositions to behave.


Hilary Putnam criticized behaviorism by arguing that it confuses the symptoms of mental states with the mental states themselves, positing &quot;super Spartans&quot; who never display signs of pain.

See also: 

===== Type Identity =====
Type physicalism or type identity theory identified mental states with brain states. Former students of Ryle at the University of Adelaide J. J. C. Smart and Ullin Place argued for type physicalism.

===== Functionalism =====
Functionalism remains the dominant theory. Type identity was criticized using multiple realizability.

Searle&#x27;s Chinese room argument criticized functionalism and holds that while a computer can understand syntax, it could never understand semantics.

===== Eliminativism =====
The view of eliminative materialism is most closely associated with Paul and Patricia Churchland, who deny the existence of propositional attitudes, and with Daniel Dennett, who is generally considered an eliminativist about qualia and phenomenal aspects of consciousness.

==== Dualism ====
Finally, analytic philosophy has featured a certain number of philosophers who were dualists, and recently forms of property dualism have had a resurgence; the most prominent representative is David Chalmers. Kripke also makes a notable argument for dualism.

Thomas Nagel&#x27;s &quot;What is it like to be a bat?&quot; challenged the physicalist account of mind. So did Frank Jackson&#x27;s knowledge argument, which argues for qualia.

==== Theories of consciousness ====
In recent years, a central focus of research in the philosophy of mind has been consciousness and the philosophy of perception. While there is a general consensus for the global neuronal workspace model of consciousness, there are many opinions as to the specifics. The best known theories are Searle&#x27;s naive realism, Fred Dretske and Michael Tye&#x27;s representationalism, Daniel Dennett&#x27;s heterophenomenology, and the higher-order theories of either David M. Rosenthal—who advocates a higher-order thought (HOT) model—or David Armstrong and William Lycan—who advocate a higher-order perception (HOP) model. An alternative higher-order theory, the higher-order global states (HOGS) model, is offered by Robert van Gulick.

=== Philosophy of mathematics ===
Since the beginning, analytic philosophy has had an interest in the philosophy of mathematics. Kurt Gödel, a student of Hans Hahn of the Vienna Circle, produced his incompleteness theorems showing that Russell and Whitehead&#x27;s &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; also failed to reduce arithmetic to logic. Gödel has been ranked as one of the four greatest logicians of all time, along with Aristotle, Frege, and Tarski. Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel established Zermelo Fraenkel Set Theory. Quine developed his own system, dubbed New Foundations.

Physicist Eugene Wigner&#x27;s seminal paper &quot;The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences&quot; poses the question of why a formal pursuit like mathematics can have real utility. José Benardete argued for the reality of infinity.

Akin to the medieval debate on universals, between realists, idealists, and nominalists; the philosophy of mathematics has the debate between logicists or platonists, conceptualists or intuitionists, and formalists.

==== Platonism ====
Gödel was a platonist who postulated a special kind of mathematical intuition that lets us perceive mathematical objects directly. Quine and Putnam argued for platonism with the indispensability argument. Crispin Wright, along with Bob Hale, led a Neo-Fregean revival with his work &quot;Frege&#x27;s Conception of Numbers as Objects&quot;.

===== Critics =====
Structuralist Paul Benacerraf has an epistemological objection to mathematical platonism.

==== Intuitionism ====
The intuitionists, led by L. E. J. Brouwer, are a constructivist school of mathematics that argues that mathematics is a cognitive construct rather than a type of objective truth.

==== Formalism ====
The formalists, best exemplified by David Hilbert, considered mathematics to be merely the investigation of formal axiom systems. Hartry Field defended mathematical fictionalism.

=== Philosophy of religion ===
In &quot;Analytic Philosophy of Religion&quot;, James Franklin Harris noted that:

As with the study of ethics, early analytic philosophy tended to avoid the study of religion, largely dismissing (as per the logical positivists) the subject as a part of metaphysics and therefore meaningless. The demise of logical positivism led to a renewed interest in the philosophy of religion, prompting philosophers not only to introduce new problems, but to re-study classical topics such as the existence of God, the nature of miracles, the problem of evil, the rationality of belief in God, concepts of the nature of God, and several others. The Society of Christian Philosophers was established in 1978.

==== Reformed epistemology ====
Analytic philosophy formed the basis for some sophisticated Christian arguments, such as those of the reformed epistemologists such as Alvin Plantinga, William Alston, and Nicholas Wolterstorff.

Plantinga was awarded the Templeton Prize in 2017 and was once described by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as &quot;America&#x27;s leading orthodox Protestant philosopher of God&quot;. His seminal work &quot;God and Other Minds&quot; (1967) argues that belief in God is a properly basic belief akin to the belief in other minds. Plantinga also developed a modal ontological argument in &quot;The Nature of Necessity&quot; (1974).

Plantinga, J. L. Mackie, and Antony Flew debated the use of the &quot;free will defense&quot; as a way to solve the problem of evil. Plantinga&#x27;s evolutionary argument against naturalism contends that there is a problem in asserting both evolution and naturalism. Plantinga further issued a trilogy on epistemology, and especially justification, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Warrant and Proper Function&quot;, and &quot;Warranted Christian Belief.&quot;

Alston defended divine command theory and applied the analytic philosophy of language to religious language. Robert Merrihew Adams also defended divine command theory, and worked on the relationship between faith and morality. William Lane Craig defends the Kalam cosmological argument in the book of the same name.

==== Analytic Thomism ====
Catholic philosophers in the analytic tradition—such as Elizabeth Anscombe, Peter Geach, Anthony Kenny, Alasdair MacIntyre, John Haldane, Eleonore Stump, and others—developed an analytic approach to Thomism.

==== Orthodox ====
Richard Swinburne wrote a trilogy of books, arguing for God, consisting of &quot;The Coherence of Theism&quot;, &quot;The Existence of God&quot;, and &quot;Faith and Reason&quot;.

==== Wittgenstein and religion ====
The analytic philosophy of religion has been preoccupied with Wittgenstein, as well as his interpretation of Søren Kierkegaard&#x27;s philosophy of religion. Wittgenstein fought for the Austrian army in the First World War and came upon a copy of Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;Gospel in Brief&quot;. At that time, he underwent some kind of religious conversion.

Using first-hand remarks (which were later published in &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot;, &quot;Culture and Value&quot;, and other works), philosophers such as Peter Winch and Norman Malcolm developed what has come to be known as &quot;contemplative philosophy&quot;, a Wittgensteinian school of thought rooted in the &quot;Swansea school&quot;, and which includes Wittgensteinians such as Rush Rhees, Peter Winch, and D.Z. Phillips, among others.

The name &quot;contemplative philosophy&quot; was coined by D. Z. Phillips in &quot;Philosophy&#x27;s Cool Place&quot;, which rests on an interpretation of a passage from Wittgenstein&#x27;s &quot;Culture and Value&quot;. This interpretation was first labeled &quot;Wittgensteinian Fideism&quot; by Kai Nielsen, but those who consider themselves members of the Swansea school have relentlessly and repeatedly rejected this construal as a caricature of Wittgenstein&#x27;s position; this is especially true of Phillips. Responding to this interpretation, Nielsen and Phillips became two of the most prominent interpreters of Wittgenstein&#x27;s philosophy of religion.

=== Philosophy of science ===
Science and the philosophy of science have also had increasingly significant roles in analytic metaphysics. The theory of special relativity has had a profound effect on the philosophy of time, and quantum physics is routinely discussed in the free will debate. The weight given to scientific evidence is largely due to commitments of philosophers to scientific realism and naturalism. Others will see a commitment to using science in philosophy as scientism.

==== Confirmation theory ====
Carl Hempel advocated confirmation theory or Bayesian epistemology. He introduced the famous raven&#x27;s paradox.

==== Falsification ====
In reaction to what he considered excesses of logical positivism, Karl Popper, in &quot;The Logic of Scientific Discovery&quot;, insisted on the role of falsification in the philosophy of science, using it to solve the demarcation problem.

==== Confirmation holism ====
The Duhem–Quine thesis, or problem of underdetermination, posits that no scientific hypothesis can be understood in isolation, a viewpoint called confirmation holism.

==== Constructivism ====
In reaction to both the logical positivists and Popper, discussions of the philosophy of science during the last 40 years were dominated by social constructivist and cognitive relativist theories of science. Following Quine and Duhem, subsequent theories emphasized theory-ladenness. Thomas Samuel Kuhn, with his formulation of paradigm shifts, and Paul Feyerabend, with his epistemological anarchism, are significant for these discussions.

==== Biology ====
The philosophy of biology has also undergone considerable growth, particularly due to the considerable debate in recent years over the nature of evolution, particularly natural selection. Daniel Dennett and his 1995 book &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Dangerous Idea&quot;, which defends Neo-Darwinism, stand at the forefront of this debate. Jerry Fodor criticizes natural selection.

She received France&#x27;s highest honour, the &quot;Legion of Honour&quot;, in 2010. She speaks English, French, and Italian.

==Early life==
Bisset was born Winifred Jacqueline Fraser Bisset in Weybridge, Surrey, England, the daughter of George Maxwell Fraser Bisset (1911–1982), a general practitioner, and Arlette Alexander (1914–1999), a lawyer-turned-housewife. Her mother was of French and English descent and her father was of Scottish descent; Bisset&#x27;s mother cycled from Paris and boarded a British troopship to escape the Germans during the 1940 Battle of France.

Bisset grew up in a 17th-century country cottage in Tilehurst, near Reading, Berkshire. She has an older brother, Max (b. 1942), a Florida-based business consultant; they have a paternal half-brother named Nick (b. circa 1981), who was an infant when their father died aged 70. Her mother taught her to speak French fluently, and she was educated at the in London. She took ballet lessons as a child and began taking acting lessons while working as a fashion model to pay for them. When Bisset was a teenager, her mother was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.

Bisset&#x27;s parents divorced in 1968 after 28 years of marriage.

==Career==
===1960s===
Bisset first appeared uncredited as a prospective model in &quot;The Knack ...and How to Get It&quot; (1965), directed by Richard Lester. She made her official debut the following year in Roman Polanski&#x27;s &quot;Cul-de-sac&quot; (1966). In 1967, Bisset had her first noticeable part in the Albert Finney/Audrey Hepburn vehicle &quot;Two for the Road&quot;, as a woman in whom Finney&#x27;s character is romantically interested. It was made by 20th Century Fox, which put her under contract. She had a more sizeable role in the James Bond satire &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, as Miss Goodthighs.

Fox cast Bisset in her first lead part in &quot;The Cape Town Affair&quot;, opposite a then-unknown James Brolin, filmed in South Africa on a low budget. She gained mainstream recognition in 1968, when she replaced Mia Farrow in &quot;The Detective&quot; opposite Frank Sinatra. The same year, she co-starred with Michael Sarrazin in &quot;The Sweet Ride&quot;, which brought her a Golden Globe nomination for Most Promising Newcomer. She capped her year as Steve McQueen&#x27;s girlfriend in the police drama &quot;Bullitt&quot;, which was among the top five highest-grossing films of the year. In 1969, Bisset was top billed in &quot;The First Time&quot; and &quot;Secret World&quot;, appearing as a blonde in the latter.

===1970s===
In 1970, Bisset was one of many stars in the disaster film &quot;Airport&quot;; her role was that of a pregnant stewardess carrying Dean Martin&#x27;s love child. It was a huge hit. Bisset had another starring part in &quot;The Grasshopper&quot; (1970), which was little seen, and was in &quot;The Mephisto Waltz&quot; (1971) with Alan Alda. She reteamed with real-life boyfriend Michael Sarrazin for the romantic drama &quot;Believe in Me&quot;, in which she played a drug addict, and had the lead in the comedy &quot;Stand Up and Be Counted&quot; (1972). More popular was &quot;The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean&quot; (1972), in which she played the daughter of Paul Newman&#x27;s title character. She played the female lead in &quot;The Thief Who Came to Dinner&quot; (1973) with Ryan O&#x27;Neal, stepping in for a pregnant Charlotte Rampling.
Bisset went to France to appear in François Truffaut&#x27;s &quot;Day for Night&quot; (1973), earning the respect of European critics and moviegoers as a serious actress. She stayed in France to make &quot;Le Magnifique&quot; (1973) with Jean-Paul Belmondo, a hit in France but little seen in English-speaking countries. She was one of many stars in Sidney Lumet&#x27;s whodunnit &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (1974), an enormous success. In Britain, she starred in a remake of &quot;The Spiral Staircase&quot; (1975). Bisset went to Germany for &quot;End of the Game&quot; (1975), co-starring Jon Voight. In Italy, she played the main character in Luigi Comencini&#x27;s &quot;The Sunday Woman&quot; (1975) opposite Marcello Mastroianni. She returned to Hollywood to support Charles Bronson in &quot;St. Ives&quot; (1976).

In 1977, Bisset gained wide publicity in America with &quot;The Deep&quot;, directed by Peter Yates, who had previously directed her in &quot;Bullitt&quot;. A marketing strategy based around Bisset appearing in some scenes underwater wearing only a white T-shirt for a top helped make the film a box-office success. Producer Peter Guber allegedly quipped, &quot;That T-shirt made me a rich man!&quot; Many credit her with popularising wet T-shirt contests, but Bisset herself was disappointed that the marketing of her translucent costume detracted from the film&#x27;s technical achievements. About that time, a UK production, &quot;Secrets&quot;, that Bisset had made in 1971 was re-released in the United States. That movie featured the only extensive nude scenes of Bisset&#x27;s career and the producers cashed in on her notoriety.

By 1978, Bisset was a household name. She earned a Golden Globe nomination that year as Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy for her performance opposite George Segal in &quot;Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe?&quot;, and starred with Anthony Quinn in &quot;The Greek Tycoon&quot;, playing a role based on Jackie Onassis. After these she made &quot;Together?&quot; (1979) in Italy with Terence Stamp and Maximilian Schell.

===1980s===
Bisset appeared in some all-star films: &quot;When Time Ran Out&quot; (1980), starring alongside Paul Newman and William Holden, and &quot;Inchon&quot; (1981), with Ben Gazzara. Her fee around this time was $1 million a movie. Both &quot;When Time Ran Out&quot; and &quot;Inchon&quot; were big flops.
More popular was George Cukor&#x27;s &quot;Rich and Famous&quot; (1981) with Candice Bergen, where Bisset also served as co-producer. One of her best-known roles came in the coming-of-age comedy &quot;Class&quot; (1983), as a married woman having an affair with her son&#x27;s (Rob Lowe) prep school roommate (Andrew McCarthy). Bisset received her third Golden Globe nomination for John Huston&#x27;s &quot;Under the Volcano&quot; (1984) in the Best Supporting Actress category.

In 1984 Bisset made the wartime drama &quot;Forbidden&quot; with Jürgen Prochnow, and earned a CableACE Award nomination as Best Actress. For television she played the title role in &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; (1985), opposite Christopher Reeve, and did an abortion drama, &quot;Choices&quot; (1986). Bisset portrayed Joséphine de Beauharnais in the miniseries &quot;Napoleon and Josephine: A Love Story&quot; (1987) with Armand Assante. She also had the lead in some comedies: &quot;High Season&quot; (1987) and &quot;Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills&quot; (1989), taking over for Faye Dunaway due to scheduling conflicts. Between those she made &quot;La maison de jade&quot; (1988) in France with Vincent Perez. She was Carré Otis&#x27; boss in the erotic thriller &quot;Wild Orchid&quot; (1989) starring Mickey Rourke.

===1990s===
During the early 1990s, Bisset shot projects on multiple continents, co-starring in Mario Monicelli&#x27;s &quot;Rossini! Rossini!&quot; (1991), a biopic of Italian composer Gioachino Rossini; with Martin Sheen for a Paris-set TV movie called &quot;The Maid&quot; (1991); with Elliott Gould in the Dutch miniseries &quot;Hoffman&#x27;s honger&quot; (1993); with Jean-Hugues Anglade in the French language film &quot;Les marmottes&quot; (1993); and with one of Japan&#x27;s top stars, Masaya Kato in the Australian TV film &quot;Crimebroker&quot; (1993). &quot;I used to work [in the states] a lot, and then I started to go and do more of the intimate little films I wanted to do that I didn&#x27;t find here,&quot; she said in 1994. &quot;I started to have two lives, really. I was able to cover more of the ground that I wanted to as an actress. But now I need to do more things that get seen.&quot; Bisset returned to North American screens with the TV film &quot;Leave of Absence&quot; (1994), opposite Brian Dennehy.

In 1995, Bisset was nominated for a César Award for her role in the French film &quot;La Cérémonie&quot;, directed by Claude Chabrol. She did a couple of period pieces, playing a spinster in 1890s New York in Linda Yellen&#x27;s &quot;End of Summer&quot; (1997), and a retired courtesan in 16th-century Venice in &quot;Dangerous Beauty&quot; (1998) with Catherine McCormack.

In 1999, Bisset appeared in two high-calibre television projects, playing the Virgin Mary in &quot;Jesus&quot; and Isabelle d&#x27;Arc in &quot;Joan of Arc&quot;, opposite Jeremy Sisto and Leelee Sobieski in the respective titular roles. Bisset earned a Primetime Emmy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actress for the latter performance. &quot;Let the Devil Wear Black&quot; (1999) was an independent film featuring Bisset in an ensemble cast, loosely retelling Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; in modern-day Los Angeles.

===2000s===

Bisset returned to the Biblical genre with &quot;In the Beginning&quot; (2000), playing Sarah, wife of Abraham. She had the leading role in Christopher Münch&#x27;s &quot;The Sleepy Time Gal&quot; (2001), in which she gave an understated portrayal of a terminally ill woman trying to put her life in order. Co-starring Nick Stahl, Seymour Cassel and Amy Madigan, &quot;The Sleepy Time Gal&quot; premiered on SundanceTV and was cited by the Village Voice in its annual survey of the year&#x27;s best undistributed films. Bisset described it as her best work. One of her later TV movies, in 2003, was &quot;America&#x27;s Prince: The John F. Kennedy Jr. Story&quot;, in which she portrayed Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis. She did guest shots on &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot;, &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; and &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, and had key roles in the independent features &quot;Swing&quot; (2003), &quot;Latter Days&quot; (2003) and &quot;Fascination&quot; (2004).

In 2005, Bisset was seen in the Domino Harvey biographical film &quot;Domino&quot; with Keira Knightley, directed by Tony Scott, playing a fictionalised version of Paulene Stone (renamed &quot;Sophie Wynn&quot;), whom she actually knew from their time as models in London. She filmed a cameo appearance for &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith&quot;, but her performance was cut from the movie. In 2006, Bisset had a recurring role on the FX series &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot; as the ruthless extortionist James LeBeau. Her next role was in &quot;Save the Last Dance 2&quot; (2006) as the protagonist&#x27;s ballet instructor. On Lifetime she appeared in an adaption of the Nora Roberts novel &quot;Carolina Moon&quot; (2007).

Bisset starred in the lead role of Boaz Yakin&#x27;s &quot;Death in Love&quot;, which premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival. Her performance as a volatile Holocaust survivor earned her the Best Actress award at the Boston Film Festival. Later that year, she starred in &quot;An Old Fashioned Thanksgiving&quot; for the Hallmark Channel, and was nominated for a Satellite Award as Best Actress.

In 2009, Bisset reunited with Linda Yellen for &quot;The Last Film Festival&quot;, which was Dennis Hopper&#x27;s final screen appearance. Hopper&#x27;s untimely death in spring 2010 occurred before Yellen could begin postproduction, and she eventually launched a crowd-funding campaign to complete the film. It finally premiered in 2016.

===2010s===

In 2010, Bisset was awarded the &quot;Legion of Honour&quot; insignia, with French President Nicolas Sarkozy calling her &quot;a movie icon&quot;. Later that year she reprised her role in the sequel to &quot;An Old Fashioned Thanksgiving&quot;, &quot;An Old Fashioned Christmas&quot;.

Following a recurring role on &quot;Rizzoli &amp; Isles&quot; from 2011 to 2012, Bisset returned to the UK to film Stephen Poliakoff&#x27;s 1930s jazz drama series &quot;Dancing on the Edge&quot;, which started on BBC2 in 2013. For her work, she won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film. Next, she played Gérard Depardieu&#x27;s wife in &quot;Welcome to New York&quot; (2014) for controversial director Abel Ferrara. In 2015, she co-starred with Drew Barrymore and Toni Collette in &quot;Miss You Already&quot;. The same year, she received a Stanislavsky Award at the 37th Moscow International Film Festival.

Bisset had a recurring role in the American TV series &quot;Counterpart&quot; in 2017. On the indie circuit, Bisset kept busy with roles in four features in 2018: &quot;Head Full of Honey&quot;, which reunited her with &quot;The Deep&quot; co-star Nick Nolte; &quot;Backstabbing for Beginners&quot; (opposite Ben Kingsley); &quot;Here and Now&quot; with Sarah Jessica Parker; and &quot;Asher&quot; with Famke Janssen and Ron Perlman. In 2019, she co-starred with Fabio Testi in the Lifetime movie &quot;Very Valentine&quot;.

===2020s===
In 2020, Bisset joined the cast of &quot;Birds of Paradise&quot; from Amazon Studios, shot in Budapest. She had a co-starring role in the fantasy/horror film &quot;The Lodger&quot; alongside Alice Isaaz, and plays a title role in Russell Brown&#x27;s &quot;Loren &amp; Rose&quot; (2022) with Kelly Blatz and Paul Sand.

In 2022, Bisset was honoured by the Coronado Island Film Festival with the &quot;Cultural Icon Award&quot;. She is set to star with Dominic Monaghan in &quot;Long Shadows&quot; (2024), which marks her first western since &quot;The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean&quot;.

==Public image==
Bisset has enjoyed considerable media visibility in her long career, gracing more than 300 magazine covers. To coincide with the release of &quot;The Deep&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot; voted her &quot;the most beautiful film actress of all time&quot;. In 1989, the year she headlined Paul Bartel&#x27;s risqué comedy &quot;Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills&quot;, the New York Daily News published an article about her titled &quot;Bad Girl Bisset&quot;. In 2010, Bisset began appearing in broadcast and print advertisements for Avon&#x27;s Anew Platinum line of skin care.

Bisset is referenced in the song &quot;Clifton in the Rain&quot; from the album &quot;Bed-Sitter Images&quot;, by Al Stewart. She was also mentioned in the episode &quot;Bar Bet&quot; of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Cheers&quot;, as well as two cable television programmes starring Garry Shandling: &quot;It&#x27;s Garry Shandling&#x27;s Show&quot; and &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;.

&quot;Forbes&quot; pointed out that, despite her status as a heterosexual sex symbol, Bisset incidentally has acquired a loyal gay fanbase, which the actress herself was unaware of for many years. Its origin goes back to as early as 1968, when she played the widow of a bisexual suicide in &quot;The Detective&quot;. Several of her subsequent films have featured LGBT characters, from &quot;The Grasshopper&quot; through &quot;Loren &amp; Rose&quot;, with Bisset even playing one herself on &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot;.

In February 2025, Bisset told &quot;Page Six&quot;, “[I&#x27;m] very unsympathetic to these stories, these #MeToo things,” referring to women who came forward during the movement to report sexual abuse and sexual harassment in the workplace, particularly in Hollywood.

==Personal life==
Bisset has never married, but had long-term romances with Canadian actor Michael Sarrazin, Moroccan real estate magnate Victor Drai, Russian dancer/actor Alexander Godunov, Swiss actor Vincent Perez and Turkish martial arts instructor Emin Boztepe.

In interviews, Bisset is often asked about being unmarried and without children. When she was 32, she told the press: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t in all conscience do what I do and have children. Could you imagine being the daughter of Raquel Welch? I&#x27;ve heard such horror stories, about the children in Hollywood.&quot; Bisset has been a &quot;de facto&quot; stepmother in two of her past relationships, as Sarrazin and Boztepe already had children before they met her.

Bisset is godmother to Angelina Jolie.

<text>Bethnal Green () is a London Underground station in Bethnal Green, London, England, served by the Central line. It lies between Liverpool Street and Mile End stations, is in Travelcard Zone 2, and is open 24 hours on a Friday and Saturday as part of the Night Tube service. The station was opened as part of the long planned Central line eastern extension on 4 December 1946, having previously been used as an air-raid shelter. 

On 3 March 1943, 173 people, including 62 children, were killed in a crush while attempting to enter the shelter, in what is believed to be the largest loss of civilian life in the UK during the Second World War.

==History==
===Development===
The 1935–40 London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) New Works Programme included a new deep level station in Bethnal Green as part of the Central line extension from Liverpool Street to Ongar and Woodford over the London &amp; North Eastern Railway suburban branch to Epping and Ongar in Essex, as well as a new underground line between Leytonstone and Newbury Park mostly under the Eastern Avenue to serve the new suburbs under-development in the north Ilford and the Hainault Loop.

Construction of the eastern extension of the Central Line began in the 1930s and the tunnels were almost complete at the outbreak of the Second World War although rails had not been laid.

===Wartime disaster===

The unfinished station at Bethnal Green was requisitioned in 1940 at the onset of the first Blitz and administration was assigned to the local authority, the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green, under the supervision of the &quot;Regional Commissioners&quot;, the generic name for the London Civil Defence Service. Heavy air raids began in October and thousands of people took shelter there, often remaining overnight. Use of the shelter dwindled in 1941 as the air forces of Germany and Italy were redirected away from the United Kingdom and against the Soviet Union. A relative lull occurred although the number of shelterers rose again when retaliatory bombing in response to Royal Air Force raids was expected.

On 3 March 1943, the British media reported a heavy RAF raid on Berlin on the night of 1–2 March. With retaliatory bombing expected, the air-raid Civil Defence siren sounded at 8:17 p.m., beginning a large and orderly flow of people down the blacked-out staircase from the street. A middle-aged woman and a child fell over, three steps up from the base, and others fell around her, tangled in an immovable mass which grew, as they struggled, to nearly 300 people. Some got free but 173, most of them women and children, were crushed and asphyxiated and about 60 others were taken to hospital. An Air Raid Warden&#x27;s report, written at 5:30 a.m. on 4 March, described the event as &quot;Panic ... apparently caused by a person falling &amp; bringing would-be shelterers to the ground. Death by asphyxiation in the subsequent stampede was the main cause of the fatalities&quot;.

News of the disaster was withheld for 36 hours and reporting of what had happened was censored, giving rise to allegations of a cover-up, although it was in line with existing wartime reporting restrictions. Among the reports which never ran was one filed by Eric Linden of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, who witnessed the disaster. Information that was provided was sparse.

Fuller details were eventually released on 20 January 1945, the cause having been &quot;kept a secret for 22 months because the government felt the information might have resulted in the Germans continuing air raids with the intention of causing similar panics&quot;. When the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, saw the report on 6 April saying that the cause was public panic during an air raid, he determined that it should be suppressed until the end of hostilities as it would be an &quot;invitation to repeat&quot; to the enemy and also as it contradicted earlier official comments that there was no panic. Home Secretary of the day Herbert Morrison disagreed, and Clement Attlee, MP for the nearby Limehouse constituency, wanted to prevent rumours that the panic was due to &quot;Jews and/or Fascists&quot;.

The results of the official investigation were not released until 1946. At the end of the war, the Minister of Home Security, Herbert Morrison, quoted from a secret report to the effect that there had been a panic, caused by the discharge of Z Battery anti-aircraft rockets fired from nearby Victoria Park. During the war, other authorities had disagreed, the Shoreditch Coroner, Mr W. R. H. Heddy, said that there was &quot;nothing to suggest any stampede or panic or anything of the kind&quot;. Mr Justice Singleton, summarising his decision in &quot;Baker v Bethnal Green Corporation&quot;, an action for damages by a bereaved widow, said &quot;there was nothing in the way of rushing or surging&quot; on the staircase. The Master of the Rolls, Lord Greene, reviewing the lower court&#x27;s judgment, said &quot;it was perfectly well known ... that there had been no panic&quot;. Lord Greene also rebuked the Ministry for requiring the hearing to be held in secret. The Baker lawsuit was followed by other claims, resulting in damages of nearly £60,000, the last of which was made in the early 1950s. The secret official report, by a Metropolitan magistrate, Laurence Rivers Dunne, acknowledged that Bethnal Green Council had warned London Civil Defence, in 1941 that the staircase needed a crush barrier to slow down the crowds but was told that would be a waste of money.

The crush at Bethnal Green is thought to have been the largest single loss of civilian life in the United Kingdom during the Second World War and the largest loss of life in an incident on the London Underground network. The largest number killed by a wartime bomb was 107 at Wilkinson&#x27;s Lemonade Factory in North Shields (1941), though there were many more British civilians killed in single bombing raids.

=== Opening ===
The station opened with the extension of the Central line to Stratford station on 4 December 1946. In the early 2000s, the station was refurbished by Metronet.

==Commemoration of wartime disaster==
===Memorials===
A plaque commemorating the 1943 disaster was erected on the station&#x27;s south-eastern staircase, on which the deaths occurred, for the fiftieth anniversary in 1993. It bears the coat of arms of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, and records the event as the &quot;worst civilian disaster of the Second World War&quot;.

The &quot;Stairway to Heaven Memorial Trust&quot; was established in 2007 to create a more prominent public memorial to those who died in the disaster. The memorial was designed by local architects Harry Patticas and Jens Borstlemann of Arboreal Architecture. It is located in a corner of Bethnal Green Garden, immediately outside the tube station, and was unveiled on 16 December 2017, more than 74 years after the event. It takes the form of an open inverted stairway of 18 steps made of teak overhanging a concrete plinth, and is a full-sized replica of the stairway where the disaster occurred. The names of the dead are carved on the exterior and the top covering has 173 small holes allowing light through representing the dead.

===Other commemorations===
Although the deaths were not due to enemy action, 164 of the dead are recorded by name by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission among civilian war dead in the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green, plus seven in the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney. All are recorded as died or injured &quot;in Tube Shelter accident&quot;.

In 1975, the ITV network broadcast a dramatised television film about the disaster, &quot;It&#x27;s A Lovely Day Tomorrow&quot;, directed and produced by John Goldschmidt, and with a script by Bernard Kops, who as a 16-year-old had witnessed the event. The film was short-listed for an International Emmy in the Fictional Entertainment category, but lost to &quot;The Naked Civil Servant&quot;. As part of &quot;TUBE&quot; Art Installation in November 2013, sound artist Kim Zip created an installation commemorating the Bethnal Green Tube Disaster. The work was backed by the Whitechapel Gallery and promoted as part of the organisation&#x27;s &quot;First Thursdays&quot; initiative for popular art. &quot;TUBE&quot; exhibited over a period of four weeks in the belfry of Sir John Soane&#x27;s St John on Bethnal Green Church. St John&#x27;s overlooks the site of the tragedy and was commandeered as a temporary mortuary on the night of 3 March 1943.

On 1 April 2016, Dr Joan Martin, who was on duty as a junior casualty officer at the nearby Queen Elizabeth Hospital for Children and led the medical team dealing with the dead and wounded from the incident, told BBC Radio 4&#x27;s Eddie Mair about her personal experiences on the evening of the disaster, and its long-term effects on her life.

== Design ==
The station is an example of the style adopted by London Transport for new tube stations under the New Works Programme of 1935–1940. Extensive use is made of pale yellow tiling, originally manufactured by Poole Pottery. This has been replicated during the 2007 modernisation although several panels of original tiling have been retained on the platforms. The finishes include relief tiles, showing symbols of London and the area served by the London Passenger Transport Board, designed by Harold Stabler. The station entrances, all in the form of subway access staircases to the subterranean ticket hall, show the design influences of Charles Holden, the consulting architect for London Transport at this time.

==Services==
Central line trains operate from the station.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) as of 2018 is:

24tph westbound which consist of:

* 9tph to Ealing Broadway
* 9tph to West Ruislip
* 3tph to Northolt
* 3tph to White City

24tph eastbound which consist of:

* 6tph to Hainault via Newbury Park
* 3tph to Newbury Park
* 3tph to Woodford via Hainault
* 9tph to Epping
* 3tph to Loughton

==Connections==
London Buses routes 8, 106, 254, 309, 388, D3 and D6 and night routes N8 and N253 serve the station.

==Future development==
The Central line runs directly below Shoreditch High Street railway station on the London Overground East London line and an interchange has been desired locally in neighbouring Shoreditch since it opened in 2010. The station would lie between Bethnal Green and Liverpool Street on one of the longest gaps between tube stations in inner London. Although there would be benefits to this interchange, it was cancelled due to costs, it would cause disruption to the Central line while under construction, and because the platforms would be too close to sidings at Liverpool Street and will not be considered until after the Elizabeth line, developed by the Crossrail project, is fully operational in 2023.

<doc id="159215" wikidata="Q4972028" url="?curid=159215" title="Broadband open access">
<text>Broadband open access is an issue of policy debate in telecommunications, regarding whether or not companies which own broadband telecommunication infrastructure (such as cable operators) should be required to provide access to their facilities for competing businesses which do not own physical infrastructure. The issue came to the fore in the U.S. in 1998, when AT&amp;T Corporation announced its plan to acquire TCI, then the nation&#x27;s largest cable operator. It involved municipal and local governments, the courts, Federal Communications Commission (the FCC), Congress, businesses, industry associations, consumer advocacy groups, and many others. Similar issues arose in other countries such as the Netherlands, Hungary, and Canada.

In the United States, cable operators were not required to provide access to their facilities to other competing businesses. However, local telephone providers with physical infrastructure, or incumbent local exchange carriers, had such an obligation. This asymmetrical scheme of regulation became a problem when the two industries&#x27; businesses came to overlap and the boundary between them eroded. This transformation of industrial landscape, often called convergence, happened in the broadband Internet service provider market. To make matters worse, the cable operators were the leading camp although local telephone carriers were burdened by the open-access obligation.

Broadband high-speed internet has become a worldwide breakthrough for telecommunication services. The service has become crucial for businesses to be able to communicate with customers and is on the verge of being a standard public utility, rather than a luxury for residents. Although other services are still offered, like dial-up Internet access or satellite internet access, broadband internet is the most convenient and fastest mode of telecommunications. With broadband open access, the popularity of this service is in great demand. The debate of making incumbent cable operators obligated to allow competitors to wire into their infrastructure is comparable to the Bell Operating Company (BOC) issue that split into the Regional Bell Operating Companies. Leading cable operators can easily avoid competition due to reasons such as lack of funding for those competitors to build their own backbone network, or even the lack of space available.

For the past couple of years now, President Barack Obama has set out to try to resolve these issues. On February 10, 2011, he announced plans to expand wireless Internet access. This plan intends to provide high-speed wireless services to 98 percent of Americans or more. The idea behind this is to increase education among Americans, build businesses and profit, and support state-of-the-art technology for state officials. In terms of broadband open access, the plan will be deployed by leading carriers of high-speed Internet. However, the debate may still remain of how this helps the incoming service provider or smaller companies that already exist. Will small companies earn profit if the country is provided Internet through the leading companies?

Broadband open access has also brought on many questions of how services to competition is offered, such as unbundled access services sold to the new company. This includes services that can be hard to duplicate. The concept is like what service providers offer their own customers and having television, voice, and Internet service bundled into one package. Any competitor may rent office space in an incumbent&#x27;s central office, place equipment to interconnect with their network, or purchase other related services. The company can offer the same deal to a competing company requesting use of their network and facilities. The new entrant has a right to purchase access to the incumbent on an unbundled basis. Getting unbundled services means the new entrant has the opportunity to invest in its own network and therefore spend less on buying everything wholesale. They are able to make a profit using their own equipment and do not have to spend it all on the incumbent hardware and software provided.

<text>Fermi–Dirac statistics is a type of quantum statistics that applies to the physics of a system consisting of many non-interacting, identical particles that obey the Pauli exclusion principle. A result is the Fermi–Dirac distribution of particles over energy states. It is named after Enrico Fermi and Paul Dirac, each of whom derived the distribution independently in 1926. Fermi–Dirac statistics is a part of the field of statistical mechanics and uses the principles of quantum mechanics.

Fermi–Dirac statistics applies to identical and indistinguishable particles with half-integer spin (1/2, 3/2, etc.), called fermions, in thermodynamic equilibrium. For the case of negligible interaction between particles, the system can be described in terms of single-particle energy states. A result is the Fermi–Dirac distribution of particles over these states where no two particles can occupy the same state, which has a considerable effect on the properties of the system. Fermi–Dirac statistics is most commonly applied to electrons, a type of fermion with spin 1/2.

A counterpart to Fermi–Dirac statistics is Bose–Einstein statistics, which applies to identical and indistinguishable particles with integer spin (0, 1, 2, etc.) called bosons. In classical physics, Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics is used to describe particles that are identical and treated as distinguishable. For both Bose–Einstein and Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics, more than one particle can occupy the same state, unlike Fermi–Dirac statistics.
==History==
Before the introduction of Fermi–Dirac statistics in 1926, understanding some aspects of electron behavior was difficult due to seemingly contradictory phenomena. For example, the electronic heat capacity of a metal at room temperature seemed to come from 100 times fewer electrons than were in the electric current. It was also difficult to understand why the emission currents generated by applying high electric fields to metals at room temperature were almost independent of temperature.

The difficulty encountered by the Drude model, the electronic theory of metals at that time, was due to considering that electrons were (according to classical statistics theory) all equivalent. In other words, it was believed that each electron contributed to the specific heat an amount on the order of the Boltzmann constant &quot;k&quot;B.
This problem remained unsolved until the development of Fermi–Dirac statistics.

Fermi–Dirac statistics was first published in 1926 by Enrico Fermi and Paul Dirac. According to Max Born, Pascual Jordan developed in 1925 the same statistics, which he called &quot;Pauli statistics&quot;, but it was not published in a timely manner. According to Dirac, it was first studied by Fermi, and Dirac called it &quot;Fermi statistics&quot; and the corresponding particles &quot;fermions&quot;.

Fermi–Dirac statistics was applied in 1926 by Ralph Fowler to describe the collapse of a star to a white dwarf. In 1927 Arnold Sommerfeld applied it to electrons in metals and developed the free electron model, and in 1928 Fowler and Lothar Nordheim applied it to field electron emission from metals. Fermi–Dirac statistics continue to be an important part of physics.

==Fermi–Dirac distribution==
For a system of identical fermions in thermodynamic equilibrium, the average number of fermions in a single-particle state is given by the Fermi–Dirac (F–D) distribution: 
where is the Boltzmann constant, is the absolute temperature, is the energy of the single-particle state , and is the total chemical potential. The distribution is normalized by the condition

: formula_1

that can be used to express formula_2 in that formula_3 can assume either a positive or negative value.

At zero absolute temperature, is equal to the Fermi energy plus the potential energy per fermion, provided it is in a neighbourhood of positive spectral density. In the case of a spectral gap, such as for electrons in a semiconductor, the point of symmetry is typically called the Fermi level or—for electrons—the electrochemical potential, and will be located in the middle of the gap.

The Fermi–Dirac distribution is only valid if the number of fermions in the system is large enough so that adding one more fermion to the system has negligible effect on . Since the Fermi–Dirac distribution was derived using the Pauli exclusion principle, which allows at most one fermion to occupy each possible state, a result is that formula_4.
The variance of the number of particles in state &quot;i&quot; can be calculated from the above expression for formula_5:
: formula_6

===Distribution of particles over energy===
From the Fermi–Dirac distribution of particles over states, one can find the distribution of particles over energy. The average number of fermions with energy formula_7 can be found by multiplying the Fermi–Dirac distribution formula_5 by the degeneracy formula_9 (i.e. the number of states with energy formula_7),

: formula_11

When formula_12, it is possible that formula_13, since there is more than one state that can be occupied by fermions with the same energy formula_7.

When a quasi-continuum of energies formula_15 has an associated density of states formula_16 (i.e. the number of states per unit energy range per unit volume), the average number of fermions per unit energy range per unit volume is

: formula_17

where formula_18 is called the Fermi function and is the same function that is used for the Fermi–Dirac distribution formula_5:

: formula_20

so that

: formula_21

==Quantum and classical regimes==
The Fermi–Dirac distribution approaches the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution in the limit of high temperature and low particle density, without the need for any ad hoc assumptions:

* In the limit of low particle density, formula_22, therefore formula_23 or equivalently formula_24. In that case, formula_25, which is the result from Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics.
* In the limit of high temperature, the particles are distributed over a large range of energy values, therefore the occupancy on each state (especially the high energy ones with formula_26) is again very small, formula_22. This again reduces to Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics.

The classical regime, where Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics can be used as an approximation to Fermi–Dirac statistics, is found by considering the situation that is far from the limit imposed by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for a particle&#x27;s position and momentum. For example, in physics of semiconductor, when the density of states of conduction band is much higher than the doping concentration, the energy gap between conduction band and fermi level could be calculated using Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics. Otherwise, if the doping concentration is not negligible compared to density of states of conduction band, the Fermi–Dirac distribution should be used instead for accurate calculation. It can then be shown that the classical situation prevails when the concentration of particles corresponds to an average interparticle separation formula_28 that is much greater than the average de Broglie wavelength formula_29 of the particles:

:formula_30

where is the Planck constant, and is the mass of a particle.

For the case of conduction electrons in a typical metal at = 300 K (i.e. approximately room temperature), the system is far from the classical regime because formula_31 . This is due to the small mass of the electron and the high concentration (i.e. small formula_32) of conduction electrons in the metal. Thus Fermi–Dirac statistics is needed for conduction electrons in a typical metal.

Another example of a system that is not in the classical regime is the system that consists of the electrons of a star that has collapsed to a white dwarf. Although the temperature of white dwarf is high (typically = on its surface), its high electron concentration and the small mass of each electron precludes using a classical approximation, and again Fermi–Dirac statistics is required.

==Derivations==

===Grand canonical ensemble===

The Fermi–Dirac distribution, which applies only to a quantum system of non-interacting fermions, is easily derived from the grand canonical ensemble. In this ensemble, the system is able to exchange energy and exchange particles with a reservoir (temperature &quot;T&quot; and chemical potential &quot;μ&quot; fixed by the reservoir).

Due to the non-interacting quality, each available single-particle level (with energy level &quot;ϵ&quot;) forms a separate thermodynamic system in contact with the reservoir.
In other words, each single-particle level is a separate, tiny grand canonical ensemble.
By the Pauli exclusion principle, there are only two possible microstates for the single-particle level: no particle (energy &quot;E&quot; = 0), or one particle (energy &quot;E&quot; = &quot;ε&quot;). The resulting partition function for that single-particle level therefore has just two terms:
:formula_33
and the average particle number for that single-particle level substate is given by
:formula_34
This result applies for each single-particle level, and thus gives the Fermi–Dirac distribution for the entire state of the system.

The variance in particle number (due to thermal fluctuations) may also be derived (the particle number has a simple Bernoulli distribution):
:formula_35

This quantity is important in transport phenomena such as the Mott relations for electrical conductivity and thermoelectric coefficient for an electron gas, where the ability of an energy level to contribute to transport phenomena is proportional to formula_36.

===Canonical ensemble===

It is also possible to derive Fermi–Dirac statistics in the canonical ensemble. Consider a many-particle system composed of &quot;N&quot; identical fermions that have negligible mutual interaction and are in thermal equilibrium. Since there is negligible interaction between the fermions, the energy formula_37 of a state formula_38 of the many-particle system can be expressed as a sum of single-particle energies:

: formula_39

where formula_40 is called the occupancy number and is the number of particles in the single-particle state formula_41 with energy formula_42. The summation is over all possible single-particle states formula_41.

The probability that the many-particle system is in the state formula_38 is given by the normalized canonical distribution:

: formula_45

where formula_46, formula_47 is called the Boltzmann factor, and the summation is over all possible states formula_48 of the many-particle system. The average value for an occupancy number formula_49 is

: formula_50

Note that the state formula_38 of the many-particle system can be specified by the particle occupancy of the single-particle states, i.e. by specifying formula_52 so that

: formula_53

and the equation for formula_5 becomes

: formula_55

where the summation is over all combinations of values of formula_56 which obey the Pauli exclusion principle, and formula_57 = 0 or formula_58 for each formula_41. Furthermore, each combination of values of formula_56 satisfies the constraint that the total number of particles is formula_61:

: formula_62

Rearranging the summations,

: formula_63

where the upper index formula_64 on the summation sign indicates that the sum is not over formula_49 and is subject to the constraint that the total number of particles associated with the summation is formula_66. Note that formula_67 still depends on formula_49 through the formula_69 constraint, since in one case formula_70 and formula_67 is evaluated with formula_72 while in the other case formula_73 and formula_67 is evaluated with formula_75 To simplify the notation and to clearly indicate that formula_67 still depends on formula_49 through formula_78 define

: formula_79

so that the previous expression for formula_5 can be rewritten and evaluated in terms of the formula_81:

: formula_82

The following approximation will be used to find an expression to substitute for formula_83:

: formula_84
where formula_85

If the number of particles formula_61 is large enough so that the change in the chemical potential formula_3 is very small when a particle is added to the system, then formula_88 Applying the exponential function to both sides, substituting for formula_89 and rearranging,

: formula_90

Substituting the above into the equation for formula_5 and using a previous definition of formula_92 to substitute formula_93 for formula_92, results in the Fermi–Dirac distribution:

: formula_95

Like the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution and the Bose–Einstein distribution, the Fermi–Dirac distribution can also be derived by the Darwin–Fowler method of mean values.

===Microcanonical ensemble===

A result can be achieved by directly analyzing the multiplicities of the system and using Lagrange multipliers.

Suppose we have a number of energy levels, labeled by index &quot;i&quot;, each level having energy ε&quot;i&quot; and containing a total of &quot;ni&quot; particles. Suppose each level contains &quot;gi&quot; distinct sublevels, all of which have the same energy, and which are distinguishable. For example, two particles may have different momenta (i.e. their momenta may be along different directions), in which case they are distinguishable from each other, yet they can still have the same energy. The value of &quot;gi&quot; associated with level &quot;i&quot; is called the &quot;degeneracy&quot; of that energy level. The Pauli exclusion principle states that only one fermion can occupy any such sublevel.

The number of ways of distributing &quot;ni&quot; indistinguishable particles among the &quot;gi&quot; sublevels of an energy level, with a maximum of one particle per sublevel, is given by the binomial coefficient, using its combinatorial interpretation:
: formula_96

For example, distributing two particles in three sublevels will give population numbers of 110, 101, or 011 for a total of three ways which equals 3!/(2!1!).

The number of ways that a set of occupation numbers &quot;n&quot;&quot;i&quot; can be realized is the product of the ways that each individual energy level can be populated:

: formula_97

Following the same procedure used in deriving the Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics, we wish to find the set of &quot;ni&quot; for which &quot;W&quot; is maximized, subject to the constraint that there be a fixed number of particles and a fixed energy. We constrain our solution using Lagrange multipliers forming the function:

: formula_98

Using Stirling&#x27;s approximation for the factorials, taking the derivative with respect to &quot;ni&quot;, setting the result to zero, and solving for &quot;ni&quot; yields the Fermi–Dirac population numbers:

: formula_99

By a process similar to that outlined in the Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics article, it can be shown thermodynamically that formula_100 and formula_101, so that finally, the probability that a state will be occupied is

: formula_102

<doc id="159228" wikidata="Q1229441" url="?curid=159228" title="Distance-vector routing protocol">
<text>A distance-vector routing protocol in data networks determines the best route for data packets based on distance. Distance-vector routing protocols measure the distance by the number of routers a packet has to pass; one router counts as one hop. Some distance-vector protocols also take into account network latency and other factors that influence traffic on a given route. To determine the best route across a network, routers using a distance-vector protocol exchange information with one another, usually routing tables plus hop counts for destination networks and possibly other traffic information. Distance-vector routing protocols also require that a router inform its neighbours of network topology changes periodically.

Distance-vector routing protocols use the Bellman–Ford algorithm to calculate the best route. Another way of calculating the best route across a network is based on link cost, and is implemented through link-state routing protocols.

The term &quot;distance vector&quot; refers to the fact that the protocol manipulates &quot;vectors&quot; (arrays) of distances to other nodes in the network. The distance vector algorithm was the original ARPANET routing algorithm and was implemented more widely in local area networks with the Routing Information Protocol (RIP).

==Overview==
Distance-vector routing protocols use the Bellman–Ford algorithm. In these protocols, each router does not possess information about the full network topology. It advertises its distance value (DV) calculated to other routers and receives similar advertisements from other routers unless changes are done in the local network or by neighbours (routers). Using these routing advertisements each router populates its routing table. In the next advertisement cycle, a router advertises updated information from its routing table. This process continues until the routing tables of each router converge to stable values.

Some of these protocols have the disadvantage of slow convergence.

Examples of distance-vector routing protocols:
* Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
* Routing Information Protocol Version 2 (RIPv2)
* Routing Information Protocol Next Generation (RIPng), an extension of RIP version 2 with support for IPv6
* Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP)
* Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)

==Methodology==
Routers that use distance-vector protocol determine the distance between themselves and a destination. The best route for data through a data network is measured in terms of the numbers of routers (hops) a packet has to pass through to reach its destination network. Additionally, some distance-vector protocols take into account other traffic information, such as network latency. To establish the best route, routers regularly exchange information with neighbouring routers, usually their routing table, hop count for a destination network and possibly other traffic related information. Routers that implement distance-vector protocol rely purely on the information provided to them by other routers, and do not assess the network topology.

Distance-vector protocols update the routing tables of routers and determine the route on which a packet will be sent by the &quot;next hop&quot; which is the exit interface of the router and the IP address of the interface of the receiving router. Distance is a measure of the cost to reach a certain node. The least cost route between any two nodes is the route with minimum distance.

Updates are performed periodically in a distance-vector protocol where all or part of a router&#x27;s routing table is sent to all its neighbours that are configured to use the same distance-vector routing protocol. Once a router has this information it is able to amend its own routing table to reflect the changes and then inform its neighbours of the changes. This process has been described as ‘routing by rumour’ because routers are relying on the information they receive from other routers and cannot determine if the information is actually valid and true. There are a number of features which can be used to help with instability and inaccurate routing information.

== Development of distance-vector routing ==
The oldest routing protocol, and the oldest distance-vector protocol, is version 1 of the Routing Information Protocol (RIPv1). RIPv1 was formally standardised in 1988. It establishes the shortest path across a network purely on the basis of the hops, that is numbers of routers that need to be passed to reach the destination network. RIP is an interior gateway protocol, so it can be used in local area networks (LANs) on interior or border routers. Routers with RIPv1 implementation exchange their routing tables with neighbouring routers by broadcasting a RIPv1 packet every 30 second into all connected networks. RIPv1 is not suitable for large networks as it limits the number of hops to 15. This hop limit was introduced to avoid routing loops, but also means that networks that are connected through more than 15 routers are unreachable.
The distance-vector protocol designed for use in wide area networks (WANs) is the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). BGP is an exterior gateway protocol and therefore implemented on border and exterior routers on the Internet. It exchanges information between routers through a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) session. Routers with BGP implementation determine the shortest path across a network based on a range of factors other than hops. BGP can also be configured by administrators so that certain routes are preferred or avoided. BGP is used by internet service providers (ISPs) and telecommunication companies.

Among the distance-vector protocols that have been described as a hybrid, because it uses routing methods associated with link-state routing protocols, is the proprietary Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP). It was developed by Cisco in the 1980s and was designed to offer better convergence and cause less network traffic between routers than the link-state routing protocol Open Shortest Path First (OSPF).

Another example of a distance-vector routing protocol is Babel.

==Count to infinity problem==
The Bellman–Ford algorithm does not prevent routing loops from happening and suffers from the count to infinity problem. The core of the count-to-infinity problem is that if A tells B that it has a path somewhere, there is no way for B to know if the path has B as a part of it. To see the problem, imagine a subnet connected like A–B–C–D–E–F, and let the metric between the routers be &quot;number of jumps&quot;. Now suppose that A is taken offline. In the vector-update-process B notices that the route to A, which was distance 1, is down – B does not receive the vector update from A. The problem is, B also gets an update from C, and C is still not aware of the fact that A is down – so it tells B that A is only two jumps from C (C to B to A). Since B doesn&#x27;t know that the path from C to A is through itself (B), it updates its table with the new value &quot;B to A = 2 + 1&quot;. Later on, B forwards the update to C and due to the fact that A is reachable through B (From C&#x27;s point of view), C decides to update its table to &quot;C to A = 3 + 1&quot;. This slowly propagates through the network until it becomes infinity (in which case the algorithm corrects itself, due to the relaxation property of Bellman-Ford).

===Workarounds and solutions===
RIP uses the split horizon with poison reverse technique to reduce the chance of forming loops and uses a maximum number of hops to counter the &#x27;count to infinity&#x27; problem. These measures avoid the formation of routing loops in some, but not all, cases. The addition of a &quot;hold time&quot; (refusing route updates for a few minutes after a route retraction) avoids loop formation in virtually all cases, but causes a significant increase in convergence times.

More recently, a number of loop-free distance vector protocols have been developed — notable examples are EIGRP, DSDV and Babel. These avoid loop formation in all cases, but suffer from increased complexity, and their deployment has been slowed down by the success of link state routing protocols such as OSPF.

==Example==
In this network we have 4 routers A, B, C and D:

We mark the current time (or iteration) in the algorithm with T, and begin (at time 0, or T=0) by creating distance matrices for each router to its immediate neighbours. As we build the routing tables below, the shortest path is highlighted in green, and a new shortest path is highlighted in yellow. Grey columns indicate nodes that are not neighbors of the current node, and are therefore not considered as a valid direction in its table. Red indicates invalid entries in the table since they refer to distances from a node to itself, or via itself.

<doc id="159229" wikidata="Q94776" url="?curid=159229" title="Jesus movement">
<text>The Jesus movement was an evangelical Christian movement that began on the West Coast of the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s and primarily spread throughout North America, Europe, Central America, Australia and New Zealand, before it subsided in the late 1980s. Members of the movement were called &quot;Jesus people&quot; or &quot;Jesus freaks&quot;.

Its predecessor, the charismatic movement, had already been in full swing for about a decade. It involved mainline Protestants and Catholics who testified to having supernatural experiences similar to those recorded in the Acts of the Apostles, especially speaking in tongues. The two movements similarly believed that they were calling the church back to a more biblically accurate version of Christianity. Furthermore, they believed that these changes would result in the restoration of spiritual gifts to the church.

The Jesus movement left a legacy that included the formation of various denominations, church groups, and other Christian organizations, and it also influenced the development of both the contemporary Christian right and Christian left. It was foundational in several ongoing Christian cultural movements, including Jesus music&#x27;s impact on contemporary Christian music, and the development of Christian media as a radio and film industry.

==History==
===Origins===
The terms &quot;Jesus movement&quot; and &quot;Jesus people&quot; were popularized by Duane Pederson in his writings for the &quot;Hollywood Free Paper&quot;. In an interview with Sean Dietrich which took place on August 19, 2006, Pederson explained that he did not coin the phrase &quot;Jesus People&quot;; moreover, he credited a magazine/television interviewer who asked him if he was part of the &quot;Jesus People&quot;. As a result, Pederson was credited to be the phrase&#x27;s founder.

The term Jesus People is used to describe the group composed of outcast and anti-religious individuals who, during the 1960s and 1970s, turned towards the Christian faith and Jesus. They converted to Christianity and subsequently changed their lives to reflect the scripture and teachings of Jesus.

During the 1970s, many younger generations were pulled away from the average structured lifestyle they were told to live, and instead turned to lifestyles that were referred to as counterculture. This new lifestyle consisted of exploring various drugs, paths of spirituality and religions. Despite the growing popularity of the counterculture, many young adults became confused, which led them to turn towards the church. People who identified as hippies came forward sharing their testimonies and the peace they found after turning towards the Jesus lifestyle.

===Growth and decline===
Secular and Christian media exposure in 1971 and 1972 caused the Jesus movement to explode across the United States, which attracted evangelical youth eager to identify with the movement. While many other communes and fellowships sprang up, the Shiloh and Children of God communities attracted more new believers.

Explo &#x27;72 was an event organized by the Campus Crusade for Christ which was held at the Cotton Bowl Stadium in Dallas, and involved such conservative leaders as Bill Bright and Billy Graham. Many of the 80,000 young Jesus People attending Explo &#x27;72 discovered for the first time these and other traditional avenues of Christian worship and experience. Although Explo &#x27;72 marked the high-water mark of media interest, the Jesus movement continued at a grass roots level with smaller individual groups and communities.

The movement began to subside, largely concluding by the late 1980s, but left a major influence in Christian music, youth and church life.
===Legacy===
Although the Jesus movement lasted no more than a decade (except for the Jesus People USA which continues to exist in Chicago), its influence on Christian culture can still be seen. Thousands of converts moved into leadership positions in churches and parachurch organizations. The informality of the Jesus movement&#x27;s music and worship affected almost all evangelical churches. Some of the fastest-growing U.S. denominations of the late 20th century, such as Calvary Chapel, Hope Chapel Churches, Victory Outreach, Vineyard Churches, and Sovereign Grace Churches, trace their roots directly back to the Jesus movement, as do parachurch organizations like Jews for Jesus and the contemporary Christian music industry. Perhaps the most significant and lasting influence, however, was the growth of an emerging strand within evangelical Christianity that appealed to the contemporary youth culture.

The culture of youth began to change far before the Jesus Movement of the &#x27;60&#x27;s/&#x27;70s. Billy Graham, one of the leading evangelists of this time, started to see changes in youth during the late 1940s. Through the 1960s, college campuses all across the country were beginning to add campus ministries. Some of the organizations for this were Campus Crusade for Christ, Fellowship of Christian Athletes, and InterVarsity Christian Fellowship.

Jesus music, which grew out of the movement, was very influential in the creation of various subgenres of contemporary Christian music during the late 20th and early 21st centuries, such as Jesus Culture and Hillsong in both America and the UK. This also led to the inclusion of new musical instruments in churches all over the world, such as guitars and drums, in addition to traditional musical instruments such as pianos and organs. Music in other parts of the world was also greatly influenced by the Jesus Movement, such as music in Central America. In Central America, Pentecostal churches under the charismatic movement began to compose spiritual music called &quot;coros&quot; (fast-paced hymns) which is normally accompanied by dancing as worship.

The topic was the subject of the 2023 film &quot;Jesus Revolution&quot;.

==Beliefs and practices==
The Jesus movement was restorationist in theology, seeking to return to the original life of the early Christians. As a result, Jesus people often viewed churches, especially those in the United States, as apostate, and took a decidedly countercultural political stance in general. The theology of the Jesus movement also called for a return to simple living and asceticism in some cases. The Jesus people had a strong belief in miracles, signs and wonders, faith, healing, prayer, the Bible, and powerful works of the Holy Spirit. For example, a revival at Asbury College in 1970 grabbed the attention of the mainstream news media and became known nationwide.

The movement tended towards evangelism and millennialism. Charismatic manifestations of the gifts of the Holy Spirit were not uncommon. Some of the books read by those within the movement included Ron Sider&#x27;s &quot;Rich Christians in an Age of Hunger&quot; and Hal Lindsey&#x27;s &quot;The Late Great Planet Earth&quot;. The Bible was the most read book by far, and provided the foundational truth for the movement.

The Jesus movement also had a communal aspect. The commune of Graham Pulkingham was described in his book &quot;They Left Their Nets&quot;.

The expansion of the Jesus Movement among young people was encouraged and spread through the practice of baptisms; moreover, the West Coast was a popular location for these &quot;mass baptisms&quot;. Another popular practice within the movement was evangelism, which is the act of spreading the Gospel; furthermore, because of active evangelism, thousands of young students in southern states converted and began living Jesus-focused lives.

==Jesus music==


There has been a long legacy of Christian music being connected to the Jesus movement. Jesus music, referred to as gospel beat music in the UK, primarily began when street musicians of the late 1960s and early 1970s converted to Christianity. They kept playing the same style of music they had played before, but they began to write lyrics containing a Christian message. Many music groups started out of this, and some became leaders within the Jesus movement, most notably Barry McGuire, Love Song, Second Chapter of Acts, All Saved Freak Band, Servant, Petra, Resurrection Band, Phil Keaggy, Paul Clark, Dion DiMucci, Paul Stookey of Peter, Paul, and Mary; Randy Stonehill, Randy Matthews, Andraé Crouch (and the Disciples), Nancy Honeytree, Keith Green, and Larry Norman. The Joyful Noise Band traveled with a Christian community throughout the US and Europe, and they performed in festivals that were held underneath giant tents. In the UK, Malcolm and Alwyn were the most notable agents of the gospel beat.

&quot;The Jesus People: Old-Time Religion in the Age of Aquarius&quot; by Enroth, Ericson, and Peters stated that Chuck Smith of Calvary Chapel in Costa Mesa, California founded the first Christian rock labels when he launched the Maranatha! Music label in 1971 as an outlet for the Jesus music bands performing at Calvary worship services. However, in 1970 Larry Norman recorded, produced, and released two albums: &quot;Street Level&quot; and &quot;Born Twice&quot; for Randy Stonehill. on his own label, One Way Records.

==Organizations==
===Belmont Avenue Church of Christ===
Don Finto became involved with the Belmont Avenue Church of Christ (now simply Belmont Church), an ailing old inner city church in Nashville, Tennessee, YUS on Music Row between the public housing and several universities: Peabody, Vanderbilt and Belmont College etc. By the summer of 1971, the membership roll had dropped to about 75 elderly members. The church had mainstream roots in the a cappella Churches of Christ, but was transformed and firmly placed in the Jesus movement by an influx of countercultural Christians. Seating ran out, with people sitting on the windowsills or on the stage. It was not rare to find them walking the worst parts of Lower Broadway witnessing to prostitutes and addicts. The concerts that were held at the Koinonia Coffee House on weekends helped east coast Christian music to grow in popularity. The house band was called Dogwood, and various musicians regularly appeared on stage, such as Dogwood, Amy Grant, Brown Bannister, Chris Christian, Don Francisco, Fireworks, Annie and Steve Chapman, Clay In The Potter&#x27;s Hand and many more as well.

===Calvary Chapel===
Chuck Smith, founder and pastor of Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa, led with expositional verse-by-verse Bible studies. While he taught that the gifts seen and described in The New Testament were at work today there were Biblical restrictions on the exercise of those gifts among believers in their services. He baptized members in the Pacific Ocean. Smith was one of the few pastors who welcomed in the hippies who after coming to faith, eventually became known as Jesus people, and thus allowed for the dramatic future growth of a network of affiliate churches.

===Fellowship House Church===
Steve Freeman and others opened the Kingdom Come Christian Coffee House in Greenville, South Carolina, in 1971. Each Saturday night Jesus People gathered for worship, songs and fellowship. In 1972, several people who were highly involved in the Kingdom Come graduated from high schools and dispersed in several colleges and universities throughout the Southeastern United States and started a Fellowship House Church. Maynard Pittendreigh, Jay Holmes, and Freeman each established one at Erskine College, the University of South Carolina, and Furman University respectively. Leadership moved from Steve Freeman to a charismatic preacher named Erskine Holt, a self-described apostle of the movement who lived in Florida. By 1973, nearly every campus throughout Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Georgia had Fellowship House Churches. These generally died out by 1977, with many of the members moving to more traditional campus ministries. However, many moved onto similar ministries in such organizations as Calvary Chapel.

===Jesus Army===
In the UK, the Jesus Army (also known as the Jesus Fellowship Church and the Bugbrooke Community) was among the groups most influenced by the Jesus movement, embracing (former) hippies, bikers and drug addicts, among others. Leaders and members of the Jesus Fellowship committed abuse of children and vulnerable adults, with several receiving custodial sentences. The Jesus Fellowship Community Trust closed in December 2020 following the scandal, and issued a Closure Statement including an unreserved apology for the abuse that occurred in the Jesus Fellowship Church (JFC) and the residential New Creation Christian Community (NCCC).

===Shiloh Youth Revival Centers===
The Shiloh Youth Revival Centers movement was the largest Jesus People communal movement in the United States in the 1970s. Founded by John Higgins in 1968 as a small communal house in Costa Mesa, California, the movement quickly grew into a very large movement catering mostly to disaffected college-age youth. There were 100,000 people involved and 175 communal houses established during its lifespan. Two years after the movement&#x27;s founding, Higgins and some of the core members of the movement bought of land near Dexter, Oregon and built a new headquarters which they called &quot;The Land&quot;.

<text> (; ) is &quot;the highest form of love, charity&quot; and &quot;the love of God for [human beings] and of [human beings] for God&quot;. This is in contrast to , brotherly love, or , self-love, as it embraces a profound sacrificial love that transcends and persists regardless of circumstance.

The verb form goes as far back as Homer, translated literally as affection, as in &quot;greet with affection&quot; and &quot;show affection for the dead&quot;. Other ancient authors have used forms of the word to denote love of a spouse or family, or affection for a particular activity, in contrast to (an affection of a sexual nature).

In the New Testament, refers to the covenant love of God for humans, as well as the human reciprocal love for God; the term necessarily extends to the love of one&#x27;s fellow human beings. Some contemporary writers have sought to extend the use of into non-religious contexts.

The concept of has been widely examined within its Christian context. It has also been considered in the contexts of other religions, religious ethics, and science.

== Early uses ==
There are few instances of the word in polytheistic Greek literature. &quot;Bauer&#x27;s Lexicon&quot; mentions a sepulchral inscription, most likely to honor a polytheistic army officer held in &quot;high esteem&quot; by his country.

== Christianity ==
The word received a broader usage under later Christian writers as the word that specifically denoted Christian love or charity (), or even God himself. The expression &quot;God is love&quot; () occurs twice in the New Testament: 1 John 4:8;16. was also used by the early Christians to refer to the self-sacrificing love of God for humanity, which they were committed to reciprocating and practicing towards God and among one another (see ). This understanding is built upon the foundational Hebrew concept of , or the loving kindness of God, which is taught throughout the Old Testament.

 has been expounded by many Christian writers in a specifically Christian context. C. S. Lewis uses in &quot;The Four Loves&quot; to describe what he believes is the highest variety of love known to humanity: a selfless love that is passionately committed to the well-being of others.

The Christian use of the term comes directly from the canonical Gospels&#x27; accounts of the teachings of Jesus. When asked what was the great commandment, &quot;Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second &quot;is&quot; like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.&quot; () In Judaism, the first &quot;love the thy God&quot; is part of the Shema (), while the second &quot;love thy neighbour as thyself&quot; is a commandment from .
In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus said:

Tertullian remarks in his 2nd century defense of Christians that Christian love attracted pagan notice: &quot;What marks us in the eyes of our enemies is our loving kindness. &#x27;Only look,&#x27; they say, &#x27;look how they love one another (&quot;Apology&quot; 39).

Anglican theologian O. C. Quick writes that within human experience is &quot;a very partial and rudimentary realization,&quot; and that &quot;in its pure form it is essentially divine.&quot;

In the New Testament, the word is often used to describe God&#x27;s love. However, other forms of the word are used in an accusatory context, such as the various forms of the verb . Examples include:

* — &quot;for Demas hath forsaken me, having loved [] this present world...&quot;.
* — &quot;For they loved [] the praise of men more than the praise of God.&quot;
* — &quot;And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved [] darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.&quot;

Karl Barth distinguishes from on the basis of its origin and depth of devotion without want. With , humanity does not merely express its nature, but transcends it. identifies with the interests of the neighbor &quot;in utter independence of the question of his attractiveness&quot; and with no expectation of reciprocity.

=== Meal ===

The word is used in its plural form () in the New Testament to describe a meal or feast eaten by early Christians, as in Jude and 2nd Peter . The love feast is still observed by many Christian denominations today, especially among Brethren and other Plain, Anabaptist churches. For example, among the Old Order River Brethren and Old Brethren, a weekend is still set aside twice a year for special meetings, self examination and a communal Love Feast as part of their three-part Communion observance.

==Thelema==
In Thelema, a new religious movement developed by Aleister Crowley in the early 20th century, the term &quot;agape&quot; holds significant importance. Derived from Greek, agape traditionally denotes a selfless, unconditional love. In Thelemic practice, agape represents the highest form of love and is often associated with True Will and the central tenet of the religion: &quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. Love is the law, love under will.&quot; Within this context, agape is seen as the expression of one&#x27;s divine will and the harmony of individual purpose with universal love. It encompasses both love for others and the self, transcending personal desires and attachments. In Thelemic rituals, the term is invoked to cultivate a sense of unity, compassion, and spiritual connection among practitioners.

<text>A cherub (; : cherubim; &quot;kərūḇ&quot;, pl. &quot;kərūḇīm&quot;) is one type of supernatural being in the Abrahamic religions. The numerous depictions of cherubim assign to them many different roles, such as protecting the entrance of the Garden of Eden.

== Abrahamic religious traditions ==
In Jewish angelic hierarchy, cherubim have the ninth (second-lowest) rank in Maimonides&#x27; &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; (12th century), and the third rank in Kabbalistic works such as &quot;Berit Menuchah&quot; (14th century). The Christian work &quot;De Coelesti Hierarchia&quot; places them in the highest rank alongside Seraphim and Thrones.

In Islam, &#x27; &quot;cherubim&quot; or &#x27; &quot;the Close&quot; refers to the highest angels near God, in contrast to the messenger angels. They include the Bearers of the Throne, the angels around the throne, and the archangels. The angels of mercy subordinative to Michael are also identified as cherubim. In Isma&#x27;ilism, there are Seven Archangels referred to as cherubim.

As described in Ezekiel 1, &quot;[E]ach had four faces, and each of them had four wings; the legs of each were [fused into] a single rigid leg, and the feet of each were like a single calf’s hoof; and their sparkle was like the luster of burnished bronze.&quot; In Ezekiel and some Christian icons, the cherub is depicted as having two pairs of wings and four faces, the hayyoth: that of a lion (representative of all wild animals), an ox (domestic animals), a human (humanity), and an eagle (birds).

Later tradition ascribes to them a variety of physical appearances. Some early midrash literature conceives of them as non-corporeal. In Western Christian tradition, cherubim have become associated with the putto derived from Cupid in classical antiquity, resulting in depictions of cherubim as small, plump, winged boys.

Cherubim are also mentioned in the Second Treatise of the Great Seth, a 3rd-century Gnostic writing.

== Etymology ==
Delitzch&#x27;s &quot;Assyrisches Handwörterbuch&quot; (1896) connected the name &quot;keruv&quot; with Assyrian &quot;kirubu&quot; (a name of the &quot;shedu&quot; or &quot;lamassu&quot;) and &quot;karabu&quot; (&quot;great, mighty&quot;).

Karppe (1897) glossed Babylonian &quot;karâbu&quot; as &quot;propitious&quot; rather than &quot;mighty&quot;.

Dhorme (1926) connected the Hebrew name to Assyrian &quot;kāribu&quot; (diminutive &quot;kurību&quot;), a term used to refer to intercessory beings (and statues of such beings) that plead with the gods on behalf of humanity.

The folk etymology connecting &quot;cherub&quot; to a Hebrew word for &quot;youthful&quot; is due to Abbahu (3rd century).

== Appearance ==

Aside from Ezekiel&#x27;s vision, no detailed attestations of &quot;cherubim&quot; survive, and Ezekiel&#x27;s description of the tetramorph being may not be the same as the &quot;cherubim&quot; of the historic Israelites. All that can be gleaned about the &quot;cherubim&quot; of the Israelites come from potential equivalences in the cultures which surrounded them.

The appearance of the &quot;cherubim&quot; continue to be a subject of debate. Mythological hybrids are common in the art of the Ancient Near East. One example is the Babylonian &quot;lamassu&quot; or &quot;shedu&quot;, a protective spirit with a sphinx-like form, possessing the wings of an eagle, the body of a lion or bull, and the head of a king. This was adopted largely in Phoenicia. The wings, because of their artistic beauty and symbolic use as a mark of creatures of the heavens, soon became the most prominent part, and animals of various kinds were adorned with wings; consequently, wings were bestowed also upon human forms, thus leading to the stereotypical image of an angel.

William F. Albright (1938) argued that &quot;the winged lion with human head&quot; found in Phoenicia and Canaan from the Late Bronze Age is &quot;much more common than any other winged creature, so much so that its identification with the cherub is certain&quot;. A possibly related source is the human-bodied Hittite griffin, which, unlike other griffins, appear almost always not as a fierce bird of prey, but seated in calm dignity, like an irresistible guardian of holy things; some have proposed that the word &quot;griffin&quot; () may be cognate with &quot;cherubim&quot; (&quot;kruv&quot; &gt; &quot;grups&quot;). While Ezekiel initially describes the tetramorph &quot;cherubim&quot; as having

the face of a man ... the face of a lion ... the face of an ox ... and ... the face of an eagle

in the this formula is repeated as

the face of the cherub ... the face of a man ... the face of a lion ... the face of an eagle

which (given that &quot;ox&quot; has apparently been substituted with &quot;the cherub&quot;) some have taken to imply that &quot;cherubim&quot; were envisioned to have the head of a bovine.

In particular resonance with the idea of cherubim embodying the throne of God, numerous pieces of art from Phoenicia, Ancient Egypt, and even Tel Megiddo in northern Israel depict kings or deities being carried on their thrones by hybrid winged creatures.

If this animalistic form is how the ancient Israelites envisioned cherubim, it raises more questions than it answers. For one, it is difficult to visualize the cherubim of the Ark of the Covenant as quadrupedal creatures with backward-facing wings, as these cherubim were meant to face each other and have their wings meet, while still remaining on the edges of the cover from which they were beaten. At the same time, these creatures have little to no resemblance to the &quot;cherubim&quot; in Ezekiel&#x27;s vision.

On the other hand, even if &quot;cherubim&quot; had a more humanoid form, this still would not entirely match Ezekiel&#x27;s vision and likewise seemingly clashes with the apparently equivalent archetypes of the cultures surrounding the Israelites, which almost uniformly depicted beings which served analogous purposes to Israel&#x27;s &quot;cherubim&quot; as largely animalistic in shape. All of this may indicate that the Israelite conception of the &quot;cherub&quot;″s appearance may not have been wholly consistent.

==Hebrew Bible==

The cherubim are the most frequently occurring heavenly creature in the Hebrew Bible, as the Hebrew word appears 91 times. The first occurrence is in the Book of Genesis 3:24. Despite these many references, the role of the cherubim is never explicitly elucidated. While Israelite tradition must have conceived of the cherubim as guardians of the Garden of Eden in which they guard the way to the Tree of life, they are often depicted as performing other roles; for example in the Book of Ezekiel, they transport Yahweh&#x27;s throne. The cherub who appears in the &quot;Song of David&quot;, a poem which occurs twice in the Hebrew Bible, in 2 Samuel 22 and Psalm 18, participates in Yahweh&#x27;s theophany and is imagined as a vehicle upon which the deity descends to earth from heaven to rescue the speaker (see 2 Samuel 22:11, Psalm 18:10).

In Exodus 25:18–22, God tells Moses to make multiple images of cherubim at specific points around the Ark of the Covenant. Many appearances of the words &quot;cherub&quot; and &quot;cherubim&quot; in the Bible refer to the gold cherubim images on the mercy seat of the Ark, as well as images on the curtains of the Tabernacle and in Solomon&#x27;s Temple, including two measuring ten cubits high.

In , Hezekiah prays, addressing God as , referring to the mercy seat. In regards to this same phrase, which appears also in 2 Kings 19, Eichler renders it &quot;who dwells among the cherubim&quot;. Eichler&#x27;s interpretation is in contrast to common translations for many years that rendered it as “who sits upon the cherubim”. This has implications for the understanding of whether the ark of the covenant in Solomon&#x27;s Temple was Yahweh&#x27;s throne or simply an indicator of Yahweh&#x27;s immanence.

Cherubim feature at some length in Ezekiel. While they first appear in Ezekiel 1, in which they are transporting the throne of God by the Kebar (or Chebar, which was near Tel Abib in Nippur), they are not called &quot;cherubim&quot; until Ezekiel 10. In Ezekiel 1:5–11 they are described as having the likeness of a man and having four faces: that of a man, a lion (on the right side), and ox (on the left side), and an eagle. The four faces represent the four domains of God&#x27;s rule: the man represents humanity; the lion, wild animals; the ox, domestic animals; and the eagle, birds. These faces peer out from the center of an array of four wings; these wings are joined to each other, two of these are stretched upward, and the other two cover their bodies. Under their wings are human hands; their legs are described as straight, and their feet like those of a calf, shining like polished brass. Between the creatures glowing coals that moved between them could be seen, their fire &quot;went up and down&quot;, and lightning burst forth from it. The cherubs also moved like flashes of lightning.

In Ezekiel 10, another full description of the cherubim appears with slight differences in details. Three of the four faces are the same – man, lion and eagle – but where chapter one has the face of an ox, Ezekiel 10:14 says &quot;face of a cherub&quot;. Ezekiel equates the cherubim of chapter ten with the living creatures of chapter one in Ezekiel 10:15 &quot;The cherubs ascended; those were the creatures () that I had seen by the Chebar Canal&quot; and in 20:10, &quot;They were the same creatures that I had seen below the God of Israel at the Chebar Canal; so now I knew that they were cherubs.&quot; In Ezekiel 41:18–20, they are portrayed as having two faces, although this is probably because they are depicted in profile.

==In Judaism==
In rabbinic literature, the two &quot;cherubim&quot; are described as being human-like figures with wings, one a boy and the other a girl, placed on the opposite ends of the Mercy seat in the inner-sanctum of God&#x27;s house. Solomon&#x27;s Temple was decorated with Cherubs according to , and Aḥa bar Ya’akov claimed this was true of the Second Temple as well.

Many forms of Judaism include a belief in the existence of angels, including cherubim within the Jewish angelic hierarchy. The existence of angels is generally accepted within traditional rabbinic Judaism. There is, however, a wide range of beliefs within Judaism about what angels actually are and how literally one should interpret biblical passages associated with them.

In Kabbalah there has long been a strong belief in cherubim, the cherubim and other angels regarded as having mystical roles. The &quot;Zohar&quot;, a highly significant collection of books in Jewish mysticism, states that the cherubim were led by one of their number named Kerubiel.

On the other end of the philosophical spectrum is Maimonides, who had a neo-Aristotelian interpretation of the Bible. Maimonides writes that to the wise man, one sees that what the Bible and Talmud refer to as &quot;angels&quot; are actually allusions to the various laws of nature; they are the principles by which the physical universe operates.

For he [the naive person] does not understand that the true majesty and power are in the bringing into being of forces which are active in a thing although they cannot be perceived by the senses ... Thus the Sages reveal to the aware that the imaginative faculty is also called an angel; and the mind is called a cherub. How beautiful this will appear to the sophisticated mind, and how disturbing to the primitive.
:— &quot;The Guide for the Perplexed&quot; II:6.

Maimonides says that the figures of the cherubim were placed in the sanctuary only to preserve among the people the belief in angels, there being two in order that the people might not be led to believe that they were the image of God.

Cherubim are discussed within the midrash literature. The two cherubim placed by God at the entrance of paradise were angels created on the third day, and therefore they had no definite shape; appearing either as men or women, or as spirits or angelic beings. The cherubim were the first objects created in the universe. The following sentence of the Midrash is characteristic:

When a man sleeps, the body tells to the soul (&quot;neshamah&quot;) what it has done during the day; the soul then reports it to the spirit (&quot;nefesh&quot;), the spirit to the angel, the angel to the cherub, and the cherub to the seraph, who then brings it before God&quot;.

In early Jewish tradition there existed the notion that cherubim had youthful, human features, due to the etymologization of the name by Abbahu (3rd century). Before this, some early midrashic literature conceived of the cherubim as non-corporeal. In the first century AD, Josephus claimed:

No one can tell, or even conjecture, what was the shape of these cherubim.

A midrash states that when Pharaoh pursued Israel at the Red Sea, God took a cherub from the wheels of His throne and flew to the spot, for God inspects the heavenly worlds while sitting on a cherub. The cherub, however, is &quot;something not material&quot;, and is carried by God, not vice versa.

In the passages of the Talmud that describe the heavens and their inhabitants, the seraphim, ofanim, and living creatures are mentioned, but not the cherubim; and the ancient liturgy also mentions only these three classes.

In the Talmud, Jose the Galilean holds that when the Birkat Hamazon (grace after meals) is recited by at least ten thousand seated at one meal, a special blessing

Blessed is Ha-Shem our God, the God of Israel, who dwells between the cherubim

is added to the regular liturgy.

== In Christianity ==
In the Book of Genesis, the Cherubim were introduced:

They were further described throughout the Old Testament, especially in the Book of Chronicles and Ezekiel respectively:


In Medieval theology, following the writings of Pseudo-Dionysius, the cherubim are the second highest rank in the angelic hierarchy, following the seraphim and preceding the Thrones. Cherubim are regarded in traditional Christian angelology as angels of the second highest order of the ninefold celestial hierarchy. &quot;De Coelesti Hierarchia&quot; (c. 5th century) lists them alongside Seraphim and Thrones. According to Thomas Aquinas, the cherubim are characterized by knowledge, in contrast to seraphim, who are characterized by their &quot;burning love to God&quot;. 

In Western art, cherubim became associated with the putto and the Greco-Roman god Cupid/Eros, with depictions as small, plump, winged boys. Artistic representations of cherubim in Early Christian and Byzantine art sometimes diverged from scriptural descriptions. The earliest known depiction of the tetramorph cherubim is the 5th–6th century apse mosaic found in the Thessalonian Church of Hosios David. This mosaic is an amalgamation of Ezekiel&#x27;s visions in , , Isaiah&#x27;s seraphim in and the six-winged creatures of Revelation from .

== In Islam ==
Al-Karubiyyin, according to the Quran, are identified as a class of &quot;al-muqarrabin&quot;, and are a class of angels near the presence of God. They are entrusted with praising God and interceding for humans. They are usually identified either with a class of angels separate or include various angels absorbed in the presence of God: the canonical four Islamic archangels Jibra&#x27;il, Mika&#x27;il, Azra&#x27;el, and Israfil, the actual cherubim and the Bearers of the Throne. They are frequently mentioned in the ibn Abbas version of Muhammad&#x27;s Night Journey.

Some scholars had a more precise approach: ibn Kathir distinguishes between the angels of the throne and the cherubim. In a 13th–14th-century work called &quot;Book of the Wonders of Creation and the peculiarities of Existing Things&quot;, the cherubim belong to an order below the Bearers of the Throne, who in turn are identified with seraphim instead. Abu Ishaq al-Tha&#x27;labi places the cherubim as the highest angels only next to the Bearers of the Throne. Similarly, Fakhr al-Din al-Razi distinguishes between the angels carrying the throne (seraphim) and the angels around the throne (cherubim).

The Quran mentions the &quot;Muqarrabin&quot; in An-Nisa verse 172, angels who worship God and are not proud. Further, cherubim appear in Miraj literature and the &quot;Qisas al-Anbiya&quot;. The cherubim around the throne are continuously praising God with the &quot;tasbih&quot;: &quot;Glory to God!&quot; They are described as bright as no one of the lower angels can envision them. Cherubim as angels of mercy, created by the tears of Michael, are not identified with the angels in God&#x27;s presence, but of lower rank. They too, request God to pardon humans. In contrast to the messenger angels, the cherubim (and seraphim) always remain in the presence of God. If they stop praising God, they fall.

The Twelver Shi&#x27;a scholar Mohammad-Baqer Majlesi narrates about a fallen cherub encountered by Muhammad in the form of a snake. The snake tells him that he did not perform dhikr (remembrance of God) for a moment so God was angry with him and cast him down to earth in the form of a snake. Then Muhammad went to Hasan and Husayn. Together they interceded (tawassul) for the angel and God restored him to his angelic form. A similar story appears in Tabari&#x27;s &quot;Bishara&quot;. An angel called &quot;Futrus&quot;, described as an &quot;angel-cherub&quot; (&quot;malak al-karubiyyin&quot;), was sent by God, but since the angel failed to complete his task in time, God broke one of his wings. Muhammad interceded for the cherub, and God forgave the fallen angel, whereupon he became the guardian for Hussain&#x27;s grave.

<text>Aleppo ( ; , , ) is a city in Syria, which serves as the capital of the Aleppo Governorate, the most populous governorate of Syria. With an estimated population of 2,098,000 residents it was Syria&#x27;s largest city until its population was surpassed by Damascus, the capital of Syria, and is the largest city in Syria&#x27;s northern governorates and also one of the largest cities in the Levant region.

Aleppo is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world; it may have been inhabited since the sixth millennium BC. Excavations at Tell as-Sawda and Tell al-Ansari, just south of the old city of Aleppo, show that the area was occupied by Amorites by the latter part of the third millennium BC. That is also the time at which Aleppo is first mentioned in cuneiform tablets unearthed in Ebla and Mesopotamia, which speak of it as part of the Amorite state of Yamhad, and note its commercial and military importance. Such a long history is attributed to its strategic location as a trading center between the Mediterranean Sea and Mesopotamia. For centuries, Aleppo was the largest city in the Syrian region, and the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s third-largest after Constantinople (now Istanbul) and Cairo. The city&#x27;s significance in history has been its location at one end of the Silk Road, which passed through Central Asia and Mesopotamia. When the Suez Canal was inaugurated in 1869, much trade was diverted to sea and Aleppo began its slow decline. 

At the fall of the Ottoman Empire after World War I, Aleppo lost its northern hinterland to modern Turkey, as well as the important Baghdad Railway connecting it to Mosul. In 1939, it lost its main access to the sea, by Antakya and İskenderun, also to Turkey. The growth in importance of Damascus in the past few decades further exacerbated the situation. This decline may have helped to preserve the old city of Aleppo, its medieval architecture and traditional heritage. It won the title of the Islamic Capital of Culture 2006 and has had a wave of successful restorations of its historic landmarks. The battle of Aleppo occurred in the city during the Syrian civil war, and many parts of the city suffered massive destruction. Affected parts of the city are currently undergoing reconstruction. An estimated 31,000 people were killed in Aleppo during the conflict.

==Etymology==

=== Proto-Semitic Origins ===
The etymology of the name Aleppo (Arabic: Ḥalab, حلب) is ancient and rooted in the long history of the region. 

The name &quot;Ḥalab&quot; is believed to originate from a Semitic root, possibly the Proto-Semitic root ḥlb, meaning “to milk” or “milk.” This connection might have arisen due to the area’s association with pastoralism and the production of milk. Another possibility is that the name refers to the color “white,” as the root ḥlb could metaphorically describe the pale or white hue of certain local soils or materials. Similarly, the modern-day nickname al-Shahbāʾ (), meaning &quot;the white-colored mixed with black&quot;, is said to be derived from its famed white marble.

=== Amorite Origins and Hittite Influence ===

During the second millennium BCE, it became a key city of the Amorite state, who referred to it as Ḥalab. The Hittites, a contemporary Anatolian Empire within the region, referred to the city as Ḥalpa or Ḥalpu in their inscriptions. This indicates the name was already well-established by this time.

=== Aramaic and Akkadian Adaptations ===

In Aramaic, the city retained a similar name, with forms like Ḥalba. Akkadian sources also refer to the city as Ḥalab.

=== Greek and Roman Periods ===

During the Hellenistic and Roman periods, Aleppo was known as Beroea (Βέροια in Greek), a name likely assigned by the Seleucid rulers after the Macedonian city of the same name. Despite this, the local population continued to use the original Semitic name. 

=== Islamic Period ===

With the advent of Islam and the Arabization of the region, the name Ḥalab (Arabic: حلب) remained in use, reflecting its deep historical continuity. The Arabic form also preserved its earlier meanings, with folklore often associating the name with the prophet Abraham, who is said to have “milked” his livestock in the area to provide for travelers.

=== Modern-day English ===

The adoption of “Aleppo” into English likely coincided with the Crusades (11th–13th centuries) and subsequent increased trade and travel between Europe and the Middle East. By the late 14th to early 15th centuries, the term Aleppo was well-established in English literature and travel accounts.

The earliest documented use of “Aleppo” in English occurs in translations of medieval texts and chronicles, such as the travel writings of Marco Polo, where the city is mentioned as a key trading hub. Additionally, it was featured in maps and documents produced during the European Renaissance as a center of commerce on the Silk Road.

==History==
===Pre-history and pre-classical era===
Aleppo has scarcely been touched by archaeologists, since the modern city occupies its ancient site. The earliest occupation of the site was around 8,000 BC, as shown by excavations in Tallet Alsauda.

Aleppo appears in historical records as an important city much earlier than Damascus. The first record of Aleppo comes from the third millennium BC, in the Ebla tablets when Aleppo was referred to as Ha-lam (𒄩𒇴). Some historians, such as Wayne Horowitz, identify Aleppo with the capital of an independent kingdom closely related to Ebla, known as Armi, although this identification is contested. The main temple of the storm god Hadad was located on the citadel hill in the center of the city, when the city was known as the city of Hadad.

Naram-Sin of Akkad mentioned his destruction of Ebla and Armanum, in the 23rd century BC. However, the identification of Armani in the inscription of Naram-Sim as Armi in the Eblaite tablets is heavily debated, as there was no Akkadian annexation of Ebla or northern Syria.

In the Old Babylonian and Old Assyrian Empire period, Aleppo&#x27;s name appears in its original form as Ḥalab (Ḥalba) for the first time. Aleppo was the capital of the important Amorite dynasty of Yamḥad. The kingdom of Yamḥad (c. 1800–1525 BC), alternatively known as the &#x27;land of Ḥalab,&#x27; was one of the most powerful in the Near East during the reign of Yarim-Lim I, who formed an alliance with Hammurabi of Babylonia against Shamshi-Adad I of Assyria. 

====Hittite period====
Yamḥad was devastated by the Hittites under Mursili I in the 16th century BC. However, it soon resumed its leading role in the Levant when the Hittite power in the region waned due to internal strife.

Taking advantage of the power vacuum in the region, Baratarna, king of the Hurrian kingdom of Mitanni instigated a rebellion that ended the life of Yamhad&#x27;s last king Ilim-Ilimma I in c. 1525 BC, Subsequently, Parshatatar conquered Aleppo and the city found itself on the frontline in the struggle between the Mitanni, the Hittites and Egypt. Niqmepa of Alalakh who descends from the old Yamhadite kings controlled the city as a vassal to Mitanni and was attacked by Tudhaliya I of the Hittites as a retaliation for his alliance to Mitanni. Later the Hittite king Suppiluliumas I permanently defeated Mitanni, and conquered Aleppo in the 14th century BC. Suppiluliumas installed his son Telepinus as king and a dynasty of Suppiluliumas descendants ruled Aleppo until the Late Bronze Age collapse. However, Talmi-Šarruma, grandson of Suppiluliumas I, who was the king of Aleppo, had fought on the Hittite side, along with king Muwatalli II during the Battle of Kadesh against the Egyptian army led by Ramesses II.

Aleppo had cultic importance to the Hittites as the center of worship of the Storm-God. This religious importance continued after the collapse of the Hittite empire at the hands of the Assyrians and Phrygians in the 12th century BC, when Aleppo became part of the Middle Assyrian Empire, whose king renovated the temple of Hadad which was discovered in 2003.

In 2003, a statue of a king named Taita bearing inscriptions in Luwian was discovered during excavations conducted by German archeologist Kay Kohlmeyer in the Citadel of Aleppo. The new readings of Anatolian hieroglyphic signs proposed by the Hittitologists Elisabeth Rieken and Ilya Yakubovich were conducive to the conclusion that the country ruled by Taita was called Palistin. This country extended in the 11th-10th centuries BC from the Amouq Valley in the west to Aleppo in the east down to Maharda and Shaizar in the south. Due to the similarity between Palistin and Philistines, Hittitologist John David Hawkins (who translated the Aleppo inscriptions) hypothesizes a connection between the Syro-Hittite states Palistin and the Philistines, as do archaeologists Benjamin Sass and Kay Kohlmeyer. Gershon Galil suggests that King David halted the Arameans&#x27; expansion into the Land of Israel on account of his alliance with the southern Philistine kings, as well as with Toi, king of Ḥamath, who is identified with Tai(ta) II, king of Palistin (the northern Sea Peoples).

====State of Bit Agusi====
During the early years of the 1st millennium BC, Aleppo was incorporated into the Aramean realm of Bit Agusi, which held its capital at Arpad. Bit Agusi along with Aleppo and the entirety of the Levant was conquered by the Assyrians in the 8th century BC and became part of the Neo-Assyrian Empire during the reign of Tiglath-Pileser III until the late 7th century BC, before passing through the hands of the Neo-Babylonians and the Achaemenid Persians. The region remained known as Aramea and Eber Nari throughout these periods.

=== Classical antiquity (Beroea) ===
Alexander the Great took over the city in 333 BC. Seleucus Nicator established a Hellenic settlement in the site between 301 and 286 BC. He called it &quot;Beroea&quot; (Βέροια), after Beroea in Macedon; it is sometimes spelled as Beroia. Beroea is mentioned in 1 Macc. 9:4.

Northern Syria was the center of gravity of the Hellenistic world and Greek culture in the Seleucid Empire. As did other Greek cities of the Seleucid kingdom, Beroea probably enjoyed a measure of local autonomy, with a local civic assembly or &quot;boulē&quot; composed of free Hellenes.

Beroea remained under Seleucid rule until 88 BC when Syria was conquered by the Armenian king Tigranes the Great and Beroea became part of the Kingdom of Armenia. After the Roman victory over Tigranes, Syria was handed over to Pompey in 64 BC, at which time they became a Roman province. Rome&#x27;s presence afforded relative stability in northern Syria for over three centuries. Although the province was administered by a legate from Rome, Rome did not impose its administrative organization on the Greek-speaking ruling class or Aramaic speaking populace.

The Roman era saw an increase in the population of northern Syria that accelerated under the Byzantines well into the 5th century. In Late Antiquity, Beroea was the second largest Syrian city after Antioch, the capital of Roman Syria and the third largest city in the Roman world. Archaeological evidence indicates a high population density for settlements between Antioch and Beroea right up to the 6th century. This agrarian landscape still holds the remains of large estate houses and churches such as the Church of Saint Simeon Stylites.

===Ecclesiastical history===

The names of several bishops of the episcopal see of Beroea, which was in the Roman province of Syria Prima, are recorded in extant documents. The first whose name survives is that of Saint Eustathius of Antioch, who, after being bishop of Beroea, was transferred to the important metropolitan see of Antioch shortly before the 325 First Council of Nicaea. His successor in Beroea Cyrus was for his fidelity to the Nicene faith sent into exile by the Roman Emperor Constantius II. After the Council of Seleucia of 359, called by Constantius, Meletius of Antioch was transferred from Sebastea to Beroea but in the following year was promoted to Antioch. His successor in Beroea, Anatolius, was at a council in Antioch in 363. Under the persecuting Emperor Valens, the bishop of Beroea was Theodotus, a friend of Basil the Great. He was succeeded by Acacius of Beroea, who governed the see for over 50 years and was at the First Council of Constantinople in 381 and the Council of Ephesus in 431. In 438, he was succeeded by Theoctistus, who participated in the Council of Chalcedon in 451 and was a signatory of the joint letter that the bishops of the province of Syria Prima sent in 458 to Emperor Leo I the Thracian about the murder of Proterius of Alexandria. In 518, Emperor Justin I exiled the bishop of Beroea Antoninus for rejecting the Council of Chalcedon. The last known bishop of the see is Megas, who was at a synod called by Patriarch Menas of Constantinople in 536. After the Arab conquest, Beroea ceased to be a residential bishopric, and is today listed by the Roman Catholic Church as a titular see.

Very few physical remains have been found from the Roman and Byzantine periods in the Citadel of Aleppo. The two mosques inside the Citadel are known to have been converted by the Mirdasids during the 11th century from churches originally built by the Byzantines.

===Medieval period===
====Early Islamic period====
The Sasanian Persians led by King Khosrow I pillaged and burned Aleppo in 540, then they invaded and controlled Syria briefly in the early 7th century. Soon after Aleppo was taken by the Muslims under Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah in 637. It later became part of Jund Qinnasrin under the Umayyad Caliphate. In 944, it became the seat of an independent Emirate under the Hamdanid prince Sayf al-Dawla, and enjoyed a period of great prosperity, being home to the great poet al-Mutanabbi and the philosopher and polymath al-Farabi. In 962, the city was sacked by the Byzantine general Nikephoros Phokas. Subsequently, the city and its emirate became a temporary vassal of the Byzantine Empire. For the next few decades, the city was disputed by the Fatimid Caliphate and Byzantine Empire, with the nominally independent Hamdanids in between, eventually falling to the Fatimids in 1017. In 1024, Salih ibn Mirdas launched an attack on Fatimid Aleppo, and after a few months was invited into the city by its population. The Mirdasid dynasty then ruled the city until 1080, interrupted only in 1038–1042, when it was in the hands of the Fatimid commander-in-chief in Syria, Anushtakin al-Dizbari, and in 1057–1060, when it was ruled by a Fatimid governor, Ibn Mulhim. Mirdasid rule was marked by internal squabbles between different Mirdasid chieftains that sapped the emirate&#x27;s power and made it susceptible to external intervention by the Byzantines, Fatimids, Uqaylids, and Turkoman warrior bands.

====Seljuq and Ayyubid periods====
In late 1077, Seljuk emir Tutush I launched a campaign to capture Aleppo during the reign of Sabiq ibn Mahmud of the Mirdasid dynasty, which lasted until 1080, when his reinforcements were ambushed and routed by a coalition of Arab tribesmen led by Kilabi chief Abu Za&#x27;ida at Wadi Butnan. After the death of Sharaf al-Dawla of the Uqaylid dynasty in June 1085, the headman in Aleppo Sharif Hassan ibn Hibat Allah Al-Hutayti promised to surrender the city to Sultan Malik-Shah I. When the latter delayed his arrival, Hassan contacted the Sultan&#x27;s brother Tutush. However, after Tutush defeated Suleiman ibn Qutulmish, who had intended to take Aleppo for himself, in the battle of Ain Salm, Hassan went back on his commitment. In response, Tutush attacked the city and managed to get hold of parts of the walls and towers in July 1086, but he left in September, either due to the advance of Malik-Shah or because the Fatimids were besieging Damascus. In 1087, Aq Sunqur al-Hajib became the Seljuk governor of Aleppo under Sultan Malik Shah I. During his bid for the Seljuk throne, Tutush had Aq Sunqur executed and after Tutush died in battle, the town was ruled by his son Ridwan.

The city was besieged by Crusaders led by the King of Jerusalem Baldwin II in 1124–1125, but was not conquered after receiving protection by forces of Aqsunqur al Bursuqi arriving from Mosul in January 1125.

In 1128, Aleppo became capital of the expanding Zengid dynasty, which ultimately conquered Damascus in 1154. In 1138, Byzantine emperor John II Komnenos led a campaign, which main objective was to capture the city of Aleppo. On 20 April 1138, the Christian army including Crusaders from Antioch and Edessa launched an attack on the city but found it too strongly defended, hence John II moved the army southward to take nearby fortresses. On 11 October 1138, a deadly earthquake ravaged the city and the surrounding area. Although estimates from this time are very unreliable, it is believed that 230,000 people died, making it the seventh deadliest earthquake in recorded history.

In 1183, Aleppo came under the control of Saladin and then the Ayyubid dynasty. When the Ayyubids were toppled in Egypt by the Mamluks, the Ayyubid emir of Aleppo An-Nasir Yusuf became sultan of the remaining part of the Ayyubid Empire. He ruled Syria from his seat in Aleppo until, on 24 January 1260, the city was taken by the Mongols under Hulagu in alliance with their vassals the Frankish knights of the ruler of Antioch Bohemond VI and his father-in-law the Armenian ruler Hethum I. The city was poorly defended by Turanshah, and as a result the walls fell after six days of siege, and the citadel fell four weeks later. The Muslim population was massacred and many Jews were also killed. The Christian population was spared. Turanshah was shown unusual respect by the Mongols, and was allowed to live because of his age and bravery. The city was then given to the former Emir of Homs, al-Ashraf, and a Mongol garrison was established in the city. Some of the spoils were also given to Hethum I for his assistance in the attack. The Mongol Army then continued on to Damascus, which surrendered, and the Mongols entered the city on 1 March 1260.

====Mamluk period====

In September 1260, the Egyptian Mamluks negotiated for a treaty with the Franks of Acre which allowed them to pass through Crusader territory unmolested, and engaged the Mongols at the Battle of Ain Jalut on 3 September 1260. The Mamluks won a decisive victory, killing the Mongols&#x27; Nestorian Christian general Kitbuqa, and five days later they had retaken Damascus. Aleppo was recovered by the Muslims within a month, and a Mamluk governor placed to govern the city. Hulagu sent troops to try to recover Aleppo in December. They were able to massacre a large number of Muslims in retaliation for the death of Kitbuqa, but after a fortnight could make no other progress and had to retreat.
The Mamluk governor of the city became insubordinate to the central Mamluk authority in Cairo, and in Autumn 1261 the Mamluk leader Baibars sent an army to reclaim the city. In October 1271, the Mongols led by general Samagar took the city again, attacking with 10,000 horsemen from Anatolia, and defeating the Turcoman troops who were defending Aleppo. The Mamluk garrisons fled to Hama, until Baibars came north again with his main army, and the Mongols retreated.

On 20 October 1280, the Mongols took the city again, pillaging the markets and burning the mosques. The Muslim inhabitants fled for Damascus, where the Mamluk leader Qalawun assembled his forces. When his army advanced following the Second Battle of Homs in October 1281, the Mongols again retreated, back across the Euphrates. In October 1299, Ghazan captured the city, joined by his vassal Armenian King Hethum II, whose forces included some Templars and Hospitallers.

In 1400, the Mongol-Turkic leader Tamerlane captured the city again from the Mamluks. He massacred many of the inhabitants, ordering the building of a tower of 20,000 skulls outside the city. After the withdrawal of the Mongols, all the Muslim population returned to Aleppo. On the other hand, Christians who left the city during the Mongol invasion, were unable to resettle back in their own quarter in the old town, a fact that led them to establish a new neighbourhood in 1420, built at the northern suburbs of Aleppo outside the city walls, to become known as &quot;al-Jdeydeh&quot; quarter (&quot;new district&quot; ).

===Ottoman era===

Aleppo became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1516 as part of the vast expansion of the Ottoman borders during the reign of Selim I. The city then had around 50,000 inhabitants, or 11,224 households according to an Ottoman census. In 1517, Selim I obtained a fatwa from Sunnite religious leaders and unleashed violence on the Alawites, killing 9,400 men, which is known as the Massacre of the Telal. It was the centre of the Aleppo Eyalet; the rest of what later became Syria was part of either the eyalets of Damascus, Tripoli, Sidon or Raqqa. Following the Ottoman provincial reform of 1864 Aleppo became the centre of the newly constituted Vilayet of Aleppo in 1866.

Aleppo&#x27;s agriculture was well-developed in the Ottoman period. Archaeological excavations revealed water mills in its river basin. Contemporary Chinese source also suggests Aleppo in the Ottoman period had well-developed animal husbandry.

During his travels to the Levant in the 17th century, French traveler Jacques Goujon recounted how the Maronite community in Aleppo, facing financial difficulties and considering conversion to Islam due to their inability to pay the jizya tax, was aided by the Franciscans who bought their church, enabling them to meet their tax obligations. 

Moreover, thanks to its strategic geographic location on the trade route between Anatolia and the east, Aleppo rose to high prominence in the Ottoman era, at one point being second only to Constantinople in the empire. By the middle of the 16th century, Aleppo had displaced Damascus as the principal market for goods coming to the Mediterranean region from the east. This is reflected by the fact that the Levant Company of London, a joint-trading company founded in 1581 to monopolize England&#x27;s trade with the Ottoman Empire, never attempted to settle a factor, or agent, in Damascus, despite having had permission to do so. Aleppo served as the company&#x27;s headquarters until the late 18th century.
As a result of the economic development, many European states had opened consulates in Aleppo during the 16th and the 17th centuries, such as the consulate of the Republic of Venice in 1548, the consulate of France in 1562, the consulate of England in 1583 and the consulate of the Netherlands in 1613. The Armenian community of Aleppo also rose to prominence in this period as they moved into the city to take up trade and developed the new quarter of Judayda. The most outstanding among Aleppine Armenian merchants during the late 16th and early 17th centuries were Khwaja Petik Chelebi, the richest merchant in the city, and his brother Khwaja Sanos Chelebi, who monopolized Aleppine silk trade and were important patrons of the Armenians.
However, the prosperity Aleppo experienced in the 16th and 17th century started to fade as silk production in Iran went into decline with the fall of the Safavid dynasty in 1722. By mid-century, caravans were no longer bringing silk from Iran to Aleppo, and local Syrian production was insufficient for Europe&#x27;s demand. European merchants left Aleppo and the city went into an economic decline that was not reversed until the mid-19th century when locally produced cotton and tobacco became the principal commodities of interest to the Europeans. According to Halil İnalcık, &quot;Aleppo ... underwent its worst catastrophe with the wholesale destruction of its villages by Bedouin raiding in the later years of the century, creating a long-running famine which by 1798 killed half of its inhabitants.&quot; 

The economy of Aleppo was badly hit by the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. This, in addition to political instability that followed the implementation of significant reforms in 1841 by the central government, contributed to Aleppo&#x27;s decline and the rise of Damascus as a serious economic and political competitor with Aleppo. The city nevertheless continued to play an important economic role and shifted its commercial focus from long-distance caravan trade to more regional trade in wool and agricultural products. This period also saw the immigration of numerous &quot;Levantine&quot; (European-origin) families who dominated international trade. Aleppo&#x27;s mixed commercial tribunal (&quot;ticaret mahkamesi&quot;), one of the first in the Ottoman Empire, was set up around 1855.

Reference is made to the city in 1606 in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;. The witches torment the captain of the ship the &quot;Tiger&quot;, which was headed to Aleppo from England and endured a 567-day voyage before returning unsuccessfully to port. Reference is also made to the city in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot; when Othello speaks his final words (ACT V, ii, 349f.): &quot;Set you down this/And say besides that in Aleppo once,/Where a malignant and a turbanned Turk/Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,/I took by th&#x27; throat the circumcised dog/And smote him—thus!&quot; (Arden Shakespeare Edition, 2004). The English naval chaplain Henry Teonge describes in his diary a visit he paid to the city in 1675, when there was a colony of Western European merchants living there.
The city remained Ottoman until the empire&#x27;s collapse, but was occasionally riven with internal feuds as well as attacks of cholera from 1823. Around 20–25 percent of the population died of plague in 1827. In 1850, a Muslim mob attacked Christian neighbourhoods, tens of Christians were killed and several churches looted. Though this event has been portrayed as driven by pure sectarian principles, Bruce Masters argues that such analysis of this period of violence is too shallow and neglects the tensions that existed among the population due to the commercial favor afforded to certain Christian minorities by the Tanzimat Reforms during this time which played a large role in creating antagonism between previously cooperative groups of Muslim and Christians in the eastern quarters of the city. By 1901, the city&#x27;s population was around 110,000.

In October 1918, Aleppo was captured by Prince Feisal&#x27;s Sherifial Forces and the 5th Cavalry Division of the Allied forces from the Ottoman Empire during the World War I. At the end of war, the Treaty of Sèvres made most of the Province of Aleppo part of the newly established nation of Syria, while Cilicia was promised by France to become an Armenian state. However, Kemal Atatürk annexed most of the Province of Aleppo as well as Cilicia to Turkey in his War of Independence. The Arab residents in the province (as well as the Kurds) supported the Turks in this war against the French, including the leader of the Hananu Revolt, Ibrahim Hananu, who directly coordinated with Atatürk and received weaponry from him. The outcome, however, was disastrous for Aleppo, because as per the Treaty of Lausanne, most of the Province of Aleppo was made part of Turkey with the exception of Aleppo and Alexandretta; thus, Aleppo was cut from its northern satellites and from the Anatolian cities beyond on which Aleppo depended heavily in commerce. Moreover, the Sykes-Picot division of the Near East separated Aleppo from most of Mesopotamia, which also harmed the economy of Aleppo.

===French mandate===
The State of Aleppo was declared by French General Henri Gouraud in September 1920 as part of a French plan to make Syria easier to administer by dividing it into several smaller states. France became more concerned about the idea of a united Syria after the Battle of Maysaloun.

By separating Aleppo from Damascus, Gouraud wanted to capitalize on a traditional state of competition between the two cities and turn it into political division. The people in Aleppo were unhappy with the fact that Damascus was chosen as capital for the new nation of Syria. Gouraud sensed this sentiment and tried to address it by making Aleppo the capital of a large and wealthier state with which it would have been hard for Damascus to compete. The State of Aleppo as drawn by France contained most of the fertile area of Syria: the fertile countryside of Aleppo in addition to the entire fertile basin of river Euphrates. The state also had access to sea via the autonomous Sanjak of Alexandretta. On the other hand, Damascus, which is basically an oasis on the fringes of the Syrian Desert, had neither enough fertile land nor access to sea. Basically, Gouraud wanted to satisfy Aleppo by giving it control over most of the agricultural and mineral wealth of Syria so that it would never want to unite with Damascus again. Damascus&#x27;s relative economic weakness was further exacerbated by the economic success of Beirut during the 1920s, a territory part of the larger French Mandate at the time. 
The limited economic resources of the Syrian states made the option of completely independent states undesirable for France, because it threatened an opposite result: the states collapsing and being forced back into unity. This was why France proposed the idea of a Syrian federation that was realized in 1923. Initially, Gouraud envisioned the federation as encompassing all the states, even Lebanon. In the end however, only three states participated: Aleppo, Damascus, and the Alawite State. The capital of the federation was Aleppo at first, but it was relocated to Damascus. The president of the federation was Subhi Barakat, an Antioch-born politician from Aleppo.
The federation ended in December 1924, when France merged Aleppo and Damascus into a single Syrian State and separated the Alawite State again. This action came after the federation decided to merge the three federated states into one and to take steps encouraging Syria&#x27;s financial independence, steps which France viewed as too much.

When the Syrian Revolt erupted in southern Syria in 1925, the French held in Aleppo State new elections that were supposed to lead to the breaking of the union with Damascus and restore the independence of Aleppo State. The French were driven to believe by pro-French Aleppine politicians that the people in Aleppo were supportive of such a scheme. After the new council was elected, however, it surprisingly voted to keep the union with Damascus. Syrian nationalists had waged a massive anti-secession public campaign that vigorously mobilized the people against the secession plan, thus leaving the pro-French politicians no choice but to support the union. The result was a big embarrassment for France, which wanted the secession of Aleppo to be a punitive measure against Damascus, which had participated in the Syrian Revolt, however, the result was respected. This was the last time that independence was proposed for Aleppo.

Bad economic situation of the city after the separation of the northern countryside was exacerbated further in 1939 when Alexandretta was annexed to Turkey as Hatay State, thus depriving Aleppo of its main port of Iskenderun and leaving it in total isolation within Syria.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi_10.1093/ia/iix118&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-independence===

The increasing disagreements between Aleppo and Damascus led eventually to the split of the National Block into two factions: the National Party, established in Damascus in 1946, and the People&#x27;s Party, established in Aleppo in 1948 by Rushdi al-Kikhya, Nazim Qudsi and Mustafa Bey Barmada. An underlying cause of the disagreement, in addition to the union with Iraq, was Aleppo&#x27;s intention to relocate the capital from Damascus. The issue of the capital became an open debate matter in 1950 when the Popular Party presented a constitution draft that called Damascus a &quot;temporary capital.&quot;

The first coup d&#x27;état in modern Syrian history was carried out in March 1949 by an army officer from Aleppo, Hussni Zaim. However, lured by the absolute power he enjoyed as a dictator, Zaim soon developed a pro-Egyptian, pro-Western orientation and abandoned the cause of union with Iraq. This incited a second coup only four months after his. The second coup, led by Sami Hinnawi (also officer from Aleppo), empowered the Popular Party and actively sought to realize the union with Iraq. The news of an imminent union with Iraq incited a third coup the same year: in December 1949, Adib Shishakly led a coup preempting a union with Iraq that was about to be declared.
Soon after Shishakly&#x27;s domination ended in 1954, a union with Egypt under Gamal Abdul Nasser was implemented in 1958. The union, however, collapsed three and a half years later when a junta of young Damascene officers carried out a separatist coup. Aleppo resisted the separatist coup, but eventually it had no choice but to recognize the new government.
In March 1963 a coalition of Baathists, Nasserists, and Socialists launched a new coup whose declared objective was to restore the union with Egypt. However, the new government only restored the flag of the union. Soon thereafter disagreement between the Baathists and the Nasserists over the restoration of the union became a crisis, and the Baathists ousted the Nasserists from power. The Nasserists, most of whom were from the Aleppine middle class, responded with an insurgency in Aleppo in July 1963.

Again, the Ba&#x27;ath government tried to absorb the dissent of the Syrian middle class (whose center of political activism was Aleppo) by putting to the front Amin al-Hafiz, a Baathist military officer from Aleppo.
President Hafez al-Assad, who came to power in 1970, relied on support from the business class in Damascus. This gave Damascus further advantage over Aleppo, and hence Damascus came to dominate the Syrian economy. The strict centralization of the Syrian state, the intentional direction of resources towards Damascus, and the hegemony Damascus enjoys over the Syrian economy made it increasingly hard for Aleppo to compete. Despite this, Aleppo remained a nationally important economic and cultural center.
On 16 June 1979 thirty-two military cadets were massacred by antigovernmental Islamist rebel group Muslim Brotherhood. In the subsequent violence around fifty people were killed. On 10 July a further twenty-two Syrian soldiers were killed. Both terrorist attacks were part of the Islamist uprising in Syria. In 1980, events escalated into the a large-scale military operation in Aleppo, where Syrian government responded with military and security forces, sending in tens of thousands of troops backed by tanks, armored vehicles and helicopters. Several hundred rebels were killed in and around city and eight thousand were arrested. By February 1981, the Islamist uprising in the city of Aleppo was suppressed. 

Since the late 1990s, Aleppo has become one of the fastest growing cities in the Levant and the Middle East. The opening of the industrial city of Shaykh Najjar and the influx of new investments and flow of the new industries after 2004 also contributed to the development of the city. In 2006, Aleppo was named by the Islamic Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (ISESCO) as the capital of Islamic culture.

===Syrian civil war===

On 12 August 2011, some months after protests had begun elsewhere in Syria, anti-government protests were held in several districts of Aleppo, including the city&#x27;s Sakhour district. During this demonstration, which included tens of thousands of protesters, security forces shot and killed at least twelve people. Two months later, a pro-government demonstration was held in Saadallah Al-Jabiri Square, in the heart of the city. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, the 11 October 2011 rally in support of Bashar al-Assad was attended by large crowds, while state and local media claimed more than 1.5 million attended and stated that it was one of the largest rallies ever held in Syria.

In early 2012, rebels began bombing Aleppo after the spread of anti-government protests. On 10 February 2012, suicide car bombs exploded outside two security compounds — the Military Intelligence Directorate&#x27;s local headquarters, and a Syrian Internal Security Forces barracks — reportedly killing 28 (four civilians, thirteen military personnel and eleven security personnel) and wounding 235. On 18 March 2012, another car bomb blast in a residential neighbourhood reportedly killed two security personnel and one female civilian, and wounded 30 residents.
In late July 2012, the conflict reached Aleppo in earnest when rebels in the city’s surrounding countryside mounted their first offensive there, apparently trying to capitalise on momentum gained during the Damascus assault. Then, some of the civil war&#x27;s &quot;most devastating bombing and fiercest fighting&quot; took place in Aleppo, often in residential areas. In the summer, autumn and winter of 2012 house-to-house fighting between armed opposition and government forces continued, and by the spring 2013 the Syrian Army had entrenched itself in the western part of Aleppo (government loyalist forces were operating from a military base in the southern part of the city) and the Free Syrian Army in the eastern part with a no man&#x27;s land between them. One estimate of casualties by an international humanitarian organization is that by this time 13,500 had been killed in the fighting — 1,500 under 5 years of age — and that another 23,000 had been injured. Local police stations in the city, used as bases of government forces and hated and feared by residents, were a focus of much of the conflict.

As a result of the severe battle, many sections in Al-Madina Souq (part of the Old City of Aleppo World Heritage Site), including parts of the Great Mosque of Aleppo and other medieval buildings in the ancient city, were destroyed and ruined or burnt in late summer 2012 as the armed groups of the Syrian Arab Army and the Free Syrian Army fought for control of the city. By March 2013, a majority of Aleppo’s factory owners transferred their goods to Turkey with the full knowledge and facilitation of the Turkish government.

A stalemate that had been in place for four years ended in July 2016, when Syrian Army troops closed the last supply line of the rebels into Aleppo with the support of Russian airstrikes. In response, rebel forces launched unsuccessful counter-offensives in September and October that failed to break the siege; in November, government forces embarked on a decisive campaign. The rebels agreed to evacuate from their remaining areas in December 2016. Syrian government victory with Russian aerial bombardment was widely seen as a potential turning point in Syria&#x27;s civil war. On 22 December, the evacuation was completed with the Syrian Army declaring it had taken complete control of the city. Red Cross later confirmed that the evacuation of all civilians and rebels was complete.

When the battle ended, 500,000 refugees and internally displaced persons returned to Aleppo, and Syrian state media said that hundreds of factories returned to production as electricity supply greatly increased. Many parts of the city that were affected are undergoing reconstruction. On 15 April 2017, a convoy of buses carrying evacuees was attacked by a suicide bomber in Aleppo, killing more than 126 people, including at least 80 children. Syrian state media reported that the Aleppo shopping festival took place on 17 November 2017 to promote industry in the city. A YPG commander stated in February 2018 that Kurdish fighters had shifted to Afrin to help repel the Turkish assault. As a result, he said the pro-Syrian government forces had regained control of the districts previously controlled by them. In February 2020, government forces achieved a major breakthrough when they captured the last remaining rebel-held areas in Aleppo&#x27;s western periphery, thus decisively ending the clashes that began with the Battle of Aleppo over eight years prior.

The city suffered damage due to the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake.
==== Takeover by Syrian opposition ====

On 29 November 2024, Syrian opposition groups, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, captured the city during the Battle of Aleppo as part of the offensive in northwestern Syria.

==Geography==

Aleppo lies about inland from the Mediterranean Sea, on a plateau above sea level, east of the Syrian-Turkish border checkpoint of Bab al-Hawa. The city is surrounded by farmlands from the north and the west, widely cultivated with olive and pistachio trees. To the east, Aleppo approaches the dry areas of the Syrian Desert.

The city was founded a few kilometres south of the location of the current old city, on the right bank of Queiq River which arises from the Aintab plateau in the north and runs through Aleppo southward to the fertile country of Qinnasrin. The old city of Aleppo lies on the left bank of the Queiq. It was surrounded by a circle of eight hills surrounding a prominent central hill on which the castle (originally a temple dating to the 2nd millennium BC) was erected. The radius of the circle is about . The hills are Tell as-Sawda, Tell ʕāysha, Tell as-Sett, Tell al-Yāsmīn (Al-ʕaqaba), Tell al-Ansāri (Yārūqiyya), ʕan at-Tall, al-Jallūm, Baḥsīta. The old city was enclosed within an ancient wall that was last rebuilt by the Mamluks. The wall has since disappeared. It had nine gates and was surrounded by a broad deep ditch.

Occupying an area of more than , Aleppo is one of the fastest-growing cities in the Middle East. According to the new major plan of the city adopted in 2001, it is envisaged to increase the total area of Aleppo up to by the end of 2015.

===Climate===
Aleppo has a cool steppe climate (Köppen: &quot;BSk&quot;). The mountain series that run along the Mediterranean coast, namely the Alawiyin Mountains and the Nur Mountains, largely block the effects of the Mediterranean on climate (rain shadow effect). The average high and low temperature throughout the year is . The average precipitation is . More than 80% of precipitation occurs between October and March. It snows once or twice every winter. Average humidity is 55.7%.

===Architecture===

Aleppo is characterized with mixed architectural styles, having been ruled by, among others, Romans, Byzantines, Seljuqs, Mamluks and Ottomans.

Various types of 13th and 14th centuries constructions, such as caravanserais, caeserias, Quranic schools, hammams and religious buildings are found in the old city. The quarters of al-Jdayde district are home to numerous 16th and 17th-century houses of the Aleppine bourgeoisie, featuring stone engravings. Baroque architecture of the 19th and early 20th centuries is common in al-Azizyah district, including the Villa Rose. The new Shahbaa district is a mixture of several styles, such as Neo-classic, Norman, Oriental and even Chinese architecture.

Since the old city is characterized with its large mansions, narrow alleys and covered souqs, the modern city&#x27;s architecture has replenished the town with wide roads and large squares such as the Saadallah Al-Jabiri Square, the Liberty Square, the President&#x27;s Square and Sabaa Bahrat Square
There is a relatively clear division between old and new Aleppo. The older portions of the city, with an approximate area of are contained within a wall, in circuit with nine gates. The huge medieval castle in the city — known as the Citadel of Aleppo — occupies the center of the ancient part, in the shape of an acropolis.

Being subjected to constant invasions and political instability, the inhabitants of the city were forced to build cell-like quarters and districts that were socially and economically independent. Each district was characterized by the religious and ethnic characteristics of its inhabitants.

The mainly white-stoned old town was built within the historical walls of the city, pierced by the nine historical gates, while the newer quarters of the old city were first built by the Christians during the early 15th century in the northern suburbs of the ancient city, after the Mongol withdrawal from Aleppo. The new quarter known as al-Jdayde is one of the finest examples of a cell-like quarter in Aleppo. After Tamerlane invaded Aleppo in 1400 and destroyed it, the Christians migrated out of the city walls and established their own cell in 1420, at the northwestern suburbs of the city, thus founding the quarters of al-Jdayde. The inhabitants of the new quarters were mainly brokers who facilitated trade between foreign traders and local merchants. As a result of the economic development, many other quarters were established outside the walls of the ancient city during the 15th and 16th centuries.

Thus, the Old City of Aleppo — composed of the ancient city within the walls and the old cell-like quarters outside the walls — has an approximate area of housing more than 120,000 residents.

==Demographics==
===History===

According to the Aleppine historian Sheikh &quot;Kamel Al-Ghazzi&quot; (1853–1933), the population of Aleppo was around 400,000 before the disastrous earthquake of 1822. Followed by cholera and plague attacks in 1823 and 1827 respectively, the population of the city declined to 110,000 by the end of the 19th century. In 1901, the total population of Aleppo was 108,143 of which Muslims were 76,329 (70.58%), Christians — mostly Catholics — 24,508 (22.66%) and Jews 7,306 (6.76%).

Aleppo&#x27;s large Christian population swelled with the influx of Armenian and Assyrian Christian refugees during the early 20th-century and after the Armenian and Assyrian genocides of 1915. After the arrival of the first groups of Armenian refugees (1915–1922) the population of Aleppo in 1922 counted 156,748 of which Muslims were 97,600 (62.26%), native Christians — mostly Catholics — 22,117 (14.11%), Jews 6,580 (4.20%), Europeans 2,652 (1.70%), Armenian refugees 20,007 (12.76%) and others 7,792 (4.97%). However, even though a large majority of the Armenians arrived during the period, the city has had an Armenian community since at least the 1100s, when a considerable number of Armenian families and merchants from the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia settled in the city. The oldest Armenian church in the city is from 1491 as well, which indicates that they have been there long before.

The second period of Armenian flow towards Aleppo marked with the withdrawal of the French troops from Cilicia in 1923. After the arrival of more than 40,000 Armenian refugees between 1923 and 1925, the population of the city reached up to 210,000 by the end of 1925, of which more than a quarter were Armenians.

According to the historical data presented by &quot;Al-Ghazzi&quot;, the vast majority of the Aleppine Christians were Catholics until the latter days of the Ottoman rule. The growth of the Oriental Orthodox Christians is related with the arrival of the Assyrian survivors from Cilicia and Southern Turkey, while on the other hand, large numbers of Eastern Orthodox Christians from the Sanjak of Alexandretta arrived in Aleppo, after the annexation of the Sanjak in 1939 in favour of Turkey.
In 1944, Aleppo&#x27;s population was around 325,000, with 112,110 (34.5%) Christians among which Armenians numbered 60,200. Armenians formed more than half of the Christian community in Aleppo until 1947, when many groups of them left for Soviet Armenia within the frames of the &quot;Armenian Repatriation Process (1946–1967)&quot;.

===Pre-civil war status===

Aleppo was the most populous city in Syria, with a population of 2,132,100 as indicated in the latest official census in 2004 by the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). Its subdistrict (&quot;nahiya&quot;) consisted of 23 localities with a collective population of 2,181,061 in 2004. According to the official estimate announced by the Aleppo City Council, the population of the city was 2,301,570 by the end of 2005. As a result of the Syrian civil war, however, the city eastern half&#x27;s population under the control of the opposition had plummeted to an estimated 40,000 by 2015.

===Muslims===
More than 80% of Aleppo&#x27;s inhabitants are Sunni Muslims. They are mainly Syrian Arabs, followed by Turkmens and Kurds. Other Muslim groups include small numbers of ethnic Circassians, Chechens, Albanians, Bosniaks, Greeks and Bulgarians.

===Christians===

Until the beginning of the Battle of Aleppo in 2012, the city contained one of the largest Christian communities in the Middle East. There were many Oriental Orthodox Christian congregations, mainly Armenians and Assyrians (locally known as Syriacs). Historically, the city was the main centre of French Catholic missionaries in Syria.

The Christian population of Aleppo was slightly more than 250,000 before the Syrian civil war, representing about 12% of the total population of the city. However, as a consequence of the war, the Christian population of the city decreased to less than 100,000 as of the beginning of 2017, of whom around 30% were ethnic Armenians.

A significant number of the Assyrians in Aleppo speak Aramaic, hailing from the city of Urfa in Turkey. The large community of Oriental Orthodox Christians belongs to the Armenian Apostolic and Syriac Orthodox churches. However, there is a significant presence of the Eastern Orthodox Church of Antioch as well.

There is also a large number Eastern Catholic Christians in the city, including Melkite Greeks, Maronites, Chaldeans, Syrian Catholics and the followers of the Latin Church. Evangelical Christians of different denominations are a minority in the city.

Several districts of the city have a Christian and Armenian majority, such as the old Christian quarter of al-Jdayde. Around 50 churches are operated in the city by the above-mentioned congregations. However, according to the Deputy Chairman of the commission for UNESCO of the Russian Federation, Alexander Dzasokhov, around 20 churches suffered great destruction during the battles in Aleppo, with the most notable being the National Evangelical Church, as well as the surrounding historic churches of al-Jdayde district. On 25 December 2016, following the government victory, Christmas was publicly celebrated in Aleppo for the first time in four years.

===Jews===

The city was home to a significant Jewish population from ancient times. The Great Synagogue, built in the 5th century, housed the Aleppo Codex. The Jews of Aleppo were known for their religious commitment, Rabbinic leadership, and their liturgy, consisting of Pizmonim and Baqashot. After the Spanish Inquisition, the city of Aleppo received many Sephardic Jewish immigrants, who eventually joined with the native Aleppo Jewish community. Peaceful relations existed between the Jews and surrounding population. In the early 20th century, the town&#x27;s Jews lived mainly in Al-Jamiliyah, Bab Al-Faraj and the neighbourhoods around the Great Synagogue. Unrest in Palestine in the years preceding the establishment of Israel in 1948 resulted in growing hostility towards Jews living in Arab countries, culminating in the Jewish exodus from Arab lands. In December 1947, after the UN decided the partition of Palestine, an Arab mob attacked the Jewish quarter. Homes, schools and shops were badly damaged. Soon after, many of the town&#x27;s remaining 6,000 Jews emigrated. In 1968, there were an estimated 700 Jews still remaining in Aleppo.

The houses and other properties of the Jewish families which were not sold after the migration, remain uninhabited under the protection of the Syrian Government. Most of these properties are in Al-Jamiliyah and Bab Al-Faraj areas, and the neighbourhoods around the Central Synagogue of Aleppo. In 1992, the Syrian government lifted the travel ban on its 4,500 Jewish citizens. Most traveled to the United States, where a sizable number of Syrian Jews currently live in Brooklyn, New York. The last Jews of Aleppo, the Halabi family, were evacuated from the city in October 2016 by the Free Syrian Army and now live in Israel.

The Jews from Aleppo referred to their city as &quot;Aram Tzova&quot; (ארם צובא) after the ancient Aramean city of Aram-Zobah mentioned in the Hebrew Bible.

===Spoken languages===
The Arabic dialect of Aleppo is a type of Syrian Arabic, which is of the North Levantine Arabic variety. Much of its vocabulary is derived from the Syriac language. The Kurdish language is the second most spoken language in the city, after Arabic. Kurds in Aleppo speak the Northern Kurdish (also known as Kurmanji). Syrian Turkmen population of Aleppo speak the Kilis and Antep dialect of the Turkish language. Most Armenians speak the Western form of the Armenian language. The Syriac language is rarely spoken by the Syriac community during daily life, but commonly used as the liturgical language of the Syriac Church. The members of the small Greco-Syrian community in Aleppo speak Arabic. English and French are also spoken.

==Culture==
===Art===

Aleppo is considered one of the main centres of Arabic traditional and classic music with the Aleppine &quot;Muwashshahs&quot;, &quot;Qudud Halabiya&quot; and &quot;Maqams&quot; (religious, secular and folk poetic-musical genres). In December 2021, the Qudud Halabiya was included into the UNESCO&#x27;s intangible cultural heritage list as Intangible cultural heritage. 

Aleppines in general are fond of Arab classical music, the &quot;Tarab&quot;, and it is not a surprise that many artists from Aleppo are considered pioneers among the Arabs in classic and traditional music. The most prominent figures in this field are Sabri Mdallal, Sabah Fakhri, Shadi Jamil, Abed Azrie and Nour Mhanna. Many iconic artists of the Arab music like Sayed Darwish and Mohammed Abdel Wahab were visiting Aleppo to recognize the legacy of Aleppine art and learn from its cultural heritage.

Aleppo is also known for its knowledgeable and cultivated listeners, known as &quot;sammi&#x27;a&quot; or &quot;connoisseur listeners&quot;. Aleppine musicians often claim that no major Arab artist achieved fame without first earning the approval of the Aleppine &quot;sammi&#x27;a&quot;.

Aleppo hosts many music shows and festivals every year at the citadel amphitheatre, such as the &quot;Syrian Song Festival&quot;, the &quot;Silk Road Festival&quot; and &quot;Khan al-Harir Festival&quot;.

Al-Adeyat Archaeological Society founded in 1924 in Aleppo, is a cultural and social organization to preserve the tangible and intangible heritage of Aleppo and Syria in general. The society has branches in other governorates as well.

===Museums===

*National Museum of Aleppo.
*Museum of the popular traditions known as the &quot;Aleppine House&quot; at Beit Achiqbash in al-Jdayde.
*Aleppo Citadel Museum.
*Museum of medicine and science at Bimaristan Arghun al-Kamili.
*Aleppo Memory Museum at &quot;Beit Ghazaleh&quot; in al-Jdayde.
*&quot;Zarehian Treasury&quot; of the Armenian Apostolic Church at the old Armenian church of the Holy Mother of God, Al-Jdeydeh.

===Cuisine===
Aleppo is surrounded by olive, nut and fruit orchards, and its cuisine is the product of its fertile land and location along the Silk Road. The International Academy of Gastronomy in France awarded Aleppo its culinary prize in 2007. The city has a wide selection of different types of dishes, such as kebab, kibbeh, dolma, hummus, ful halabi, za&#x27;atar halabi, muhshi. Ful halabi is a typical Aleppine breakfast meal: fava bean soup with a splash of olive oil, lemon juice, garlic and Aleppo&#x27;s red peppers. The za&#x27;atar of Aleppo (thyme) is a kind of oregano which is popular in the regional cuisines.

The kibbeh is one of the favourite foods of the locals, and the Aleppines have created more than 17 types of kibbeh dishes, which is considered a form of art for them. These include &quot;kibbeh&quot; prepared with sumac (&quot;kәbbe sәmmāʔiyye&quot;), yogurt (&quot;kәbbe labaniyye&quot;), quince (&quot;kәbbe safarjaliyye&quot;), lemon juice (&quot;kәbbe ḥāmḍa&quot;), pomegranate sauce and cherry sauce. Other varieties include the &quot;disk&quot; &quot;kibbeh&quot; (&quot;kәbbe ʔrāṣ&quot;), the &quot;plate&quot; &quot;kibbeh&quot; (&quot;kәbbe bәṣfīḥa&quot; or &quot;kәbbe bṣēniyye&quot;) and the raw &quot;kibbeh&quot; (&quot;kәbbe nayye&quot;). Kebab Halabi – influenced by Armenian and Turkish tastes – has around 26 variants including: &quot;kebab&quot; prepared with cherry (&quot;kebab karaz&quot;), eggplant (&quot;kebab banjan&quot;), chili pepper with parsley and pine nut (&quot;kebab khashkhash&quot;), truffle (&quot;kebab kamayeh&quot;), tomato paste (&quot;kebab hindi&quot;), cheese and mushroom (&quot;kebab ma&#x27;juʔa&quot;), etc. The favourite drink is Arak, which is usually consumed along with meze, Aleppine kebabs and kibbehs. Al-Shark beer – a product of Aleppo – is also among the favourite drinks. Local wines and brandies are consumed as well.

Aleppo is the origin of different types of sweets and pastries. The Aleppine sweets, such as mabrumeh, siwar es-sett, balloriyyeh, etc., are characterized by containing high rates of ghee butter and sugar. Other sweets include mamuniyeh, shuaibiyyat, mushabbak, zilebiyeh, ghazel al-banat etc. Most pastries contain Aleppine pistachios and other types of nuts.

===Leisure and entertainment===

Until the break-out of the Battle of Aleppo in July 2012, the city was known for its vibrant nightlife. Several night-clubs, bars and cabarets operated at the centre of the city as well as at the northern suburbs. The historic quarter of al-Jdayde was known for its pubs and boutique hotels, situated within ancient oriental mansions, providing special treats from the Aleppine flavour and cuisine, along with local music.

Club d&#x27;Alep, opened in 1945, is a unique social club known for bridge games and other nightlife activities, located in a 19th-century mansion in the Aziziyah district of central Aleppo.

The Aleppo Public Park, opened in 1949, is one of the largest planted parks in Syria, located near in the Aziziyah district, where Queiq River breaks through the green park.

The &quot;Blue Lagoon&quot; water park – heavily damaged during the battles – was one of the favourite places among the locals, as it was the first water park in Syria. Aleppo&#x27;s Shahba Mall – one of the largest shopping centres in Syria – was also among the most visited locations for the locals. It has received major damages during the civil war.

===Historical sites===
====Souqs and khans====

The city&#x27;s strategic trading position attracted settlers of all races and beliefs who wished to take advantage of the commercial roads that met in Aleppo from as far as China and Mesopotamia to the east, Europe to the west, and the Fertile Crescent and Egypt to the south. The largest covered souq-market in the world is in Aleppo, with an approximate length of .

&quot;Al-Madina Souq&quot;, as it is locally known, is an active trade centre for imported luxury goods, such as raw silk from Iran, spices and dyes from India, and coffee from Damascus. Souq al-Madina is also home to local products such as wool, agricultural products and soap. Most of the souqs date back to the 14th century and are named after various professions and crafts, hence the wool souq, the copper souq, and so on. Aside from trading, the souq accommodated the traders and their goods in &quot;khans&quot; (caravanserais) and scattered in the souq. Other types of small market-places were called &quot;caeserias&quot; (ﻗﻴﺴﺎﺭﻳﺎﺕ). Caeserias are smaller than khans in their sizes and functioned as workshops for craftsmen. Most of the khans took their names after their location in the souq and function, and are characterized by their façades, entrances and fortified wooden doors.

====Gates of Aleppo and other historic buildings====

The old part of the city is surrounded with , thick walls, pierced by the nine historical gates (many of them are well-preserved) of the old town. These are, clockwise from the north-east of the citadel:

*Bab al-Hadid, Bab al-Ahmar, Bab al-Nairab, Bab al-Maqam, Bab Qinnasrin, Bab Antakeya, Bāb Jnēn, Bab al-Faraj and Bab al-Nasr.

The most significant historic buildings of the ancient city include:
*The Citadel, a large fortress built atop a huge, partially artificial mound rising above the city, dates back to the first millennium BC. Recent excavations unearthed a temple and 25 statues dating back to the first millennium BC. Many of the current structures date from the 13th century. The Citadel had been extensively damaged by earthquakes, notably in 1822.
*Al-Shibani building, al-Halawiyah Madrasa, al-Muqaddamiyah Madrasa, al-Zahiriyah Madrasa, al-Sultaniyah Madrasa, al-Firdaws Madrasa, Bimaristan Arghun al-Kamili, Beit Junblatt, Bab al-Faraj Clock Tower, etc.

The following are among the important historic mansions of al-Jdayde Christian quarter:
*&quot;Beit Wakil&quot;, an Aleppine mansion built in 1603, with unique wooden decorations. One of its decorations was taken to Berlin and exhibited in the Museum of Islamic Art, known as the &quot;Aleppo Room&quot;.
*&quot;Beit Achiqbash&quot;, an old Aleppine house built in 1757. The building is home to the &quot;Popular Traditions Museum&quot; since 1975, showing fine decorations of the Aleppine art.
*&quot;Beit Ghazaleh&quot;, an old 17th-century mansion characterized with fine decorations, carved by the Armenian sculptor &quot;Khachadur Bali&quot; in 1691. It was used as an Armenian elementary school during the 20th century.

====Places of worship====
*Great Mosque of Aleppo (Jāmi&#x27; Bani Omayya al-Kabīr), founded by Umayyad caliph Walid I and most likely completed by his successor Sulayman. The building contains a tomb associated with Zachary, father of John the Baptist. Construction of the present structure for Nur al-Din commenced in 1158. However, it was damaged during the Mongol invasion of 1260 and was rebuilt. The tower (described as &quot;the principal monument of medieval Syria&quot;) was erected in 1090–1092 under the first Seljuk sultan, Tutush I. It had four façades with different styles. The tower was completely destroyed during the Syrian civil war in March 2013 (reported on 24 March 2013).
*Al-Nuqtah Mosque (&quot;Mosque of the drop [of blood]&quot;), a Shī&#x27;ah mosque, which contains a stone said to be marked by a drop of Husayn&#x27;s blood. The site is believed to have previously been a monastery, which was converted into a mosque in 944.
*Al-Shuaibiyah Mosque, Al-Qaiqan Mosque, Mahmandar Mosque, Altun Bogha Mosque, Al-Sahibiyah Mosque, Bahsita Mosque, Al-Tawashi Mosque, Al-Otrush Mosque, Al-Saffahiyah Mosque, Khusruwiyah Mosque, Al-Adiliyah Mosque, Bahramiyah Mosque, etc.
*Churches of al-Jdayde quarter: the Forty Martyrs Armenian Apostolic Cathedral, the Dormition of Our Lady Greek Orthodox church, Mar Assia al-Hakim Syrian Catholic church, the Maronite Cathedral of Saint Elijah, the Armenian Catholic Cathedral of Our Mother of Reliefs and the Melkite Greek Catholic Cathedral of Virgin Mary.
*Central Synagogue of Aleppo or al-Bandara synagogue, dating to the 9th century. The synagogue was destroyed during an anti-Jewish pogrom in 1947. In the 1980s, the building was restored, but destroyed again during the civil war.

====Hammams====

Aleppo was home to 177 hammams during the medieval period until the Mongol invasion, when many of the prominent structures of the city were destroyed. Before the civil war, 18 hammams were operating in the old city, including:
*Hammam al-Nahhasin built during the 12th century near khan al-Nahhaseen.
*Hammam al-Sultan built in 1211 by Az-Zahir Ghazi.
*Hammam al-Bayadah of the Mamluk era built in 1450.
*Hammam Yalbugha built in 1491 by the Emir of Aleppo Saif ad-Din Yalbugha al-Naseri.
*Hammam al-Jawhary, hammam Azdemir, hammam Bahram Pasha, hammam Bab al-Ahmar, etc.

===Nearby attractions and the &quot;Dead Cities&quot;===
Aleppo&#x27;s western suburbs are home to a group of historical sites and villages which are commonly known as the &quot;Dead Cities&quot;. Around 700 abandoned settlements in the northwestern parts of Syria before the 5th century, contain remains of Christian Byzantine architecture. Many hundreds of those settlements are in Mount Simeon (Jabal Semaan) and Jabal Halaqa regions at the western suburbs of Aleppo, within the range of Limestone Massif. Dead Cities were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2011, under the name of &quot;Ancient Villages of Northern Syria&quot;.

The most notable &quot;Dead cities&quot; and archaeological sites in Mount Simeon and Mount Kurd near Aleppo include: Kalota Castle and churches northwest of Aleppo, Kharab Shams Byzantine basilica of the 4th century, the half-ruined Roman basilica in Fafertin village dating back to 372 AD, the old Byzantine settlement of Surqanya village at the northwest of Aleppo, the 4th-century Basilica of Sinhar settlement, the Mushabbak Basilica dating back to the second half of the 5th century, the 9th-century BC Assyrian settlement of Kafr Nabu, Brad village and the Saint Julianus Maronite monastery (399–402 AD) where the shrine of Saint Maron is located, the 5th-century Kimar settlement of the Roman and Byzantine eras, the Church of Saint Simeon Stylites of the 5th century, the Syro-Hittite Ain Dara temple of the Iron Age dating back to the 10th and 8th centuries BC, the ancient city of Cyrrhus with the old Roman amphitheatre and two historic bridges, etc.

==Transportation==

===Highways and roads===
The main highway leading to and within the city is the M4 Highway, which runs in the eastern side of the city from south to north along the Queiq River. Driving south on M4 Highway gives access to M5 Highway leading to Homs, Hama, and Damascus. The northern bypass of the city called Castello Road leads through Azaz to the border with Turkey and further to the city of Gaziantep. Driving east on M4 Highway gives access to the coastal road leading to Latakia and Tartus. Within the city, main routes include Al Jalaa Street, Shukri Al-Quwatly Street, King Faisal Street, Bab Antakya Street, Ibrahim Hanano Street and Tishreen Boulevard.

===Public transport===

The city of Aleppo is a major transportation hub, served by a comprehensive public transport network of buses and minibuses. New modern buses are used to connect the city with Damascus and the other Syrian cities to the east and the south of Aleppo. The city is also served by local and inter-city share taxis.

===Railway===

Aleppo was one of the major stations of Syria that was connected to the Baghdad Railway in 1912, within the Ottoman Empire. The connections to Turkey and onwards to Ankara still exist today, with a twice weekly train from Damascus. It is perhaps for this historical reason that Aleppo is the headquarters of Syria national railway network, Chemins de Fer Syriens. As the railway is relatively slow, much of the passenger traffic to the port of Latakia had moved to road-based air-conditioned coaches. But this has reversed in recent years with the 2005 introduction of South Korean built DMUs providing a regular bi-hourly express service to both Latakia and Damascus, which miss intermediate stations.

However, after the break-out of the civil war in 2011, the Syrian railway network has suffered major damage and is partially out of use. Reconstruction of the Damascus-Aleppo railway line was started in 2020, after its completion and securing rail transport will be resumed.

The opening scene in Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; takes place on the railway station in Aleppo: &quot;It was five o&#x27;clock on a winter&#x27;s morning in Syria. Alongside the platform at Aleppo stood the train grandly designated in railway guides as the Taurus Express.&quot;

===Airport===

Aleppo International Airport (IATA: ALP, ICAO: OSAP) is the international airport serving the city. The airport serves as a secondary hub for Syrian Arab Airlines. The history of the airport dates back to the beginning of the 20th century. It was upgraded and developed in the years to 1999 when the new current terminal was opened.

The airport was closed since the beginning of 2013 as a result of the military operations in the area. However, following the Syrian government&#x27;s recapture of eastern Aleppo during the Battle of Aleppo, an airplane conducted its first flight from the airport in four years.

==Economy==

===Trade and industry===

The main role of the city was as a trading place throughout the history, as it sat at the crossroads of two trade routes and mediated the trade from India, the Tigris and Euphrates regions and the route coming from Damascus in the South, which traced the base of the mountains rather than the rugged seacoast. Although trade was often directed away from the city for political reasons , it continued to thrive until the Europeans began to use the Cape route to India and later to use the route through Egypt to the Red Sea.

The commercial traditions in Aleppo have deep roots in the history. The Aleppo Chamber of commerce founded in 1885, is one of the oldest chambers in the Middle East and the Arab world. According to many historians, Aleppo was the most developed commercial and industrial city in the Ottoman Empire after Constantinople and Cairo. However the post-Ottoman conditions favored other cities, such as Haifa, whose economy thrived more in the new circumstances. The issue was that the city&#x27;s hinterland wasn&#x27;t included in the &quot;customs-free zone&quot; between the newly established British and French mandates which hurt the city&#x27;s economic growth.

As the largest urban area in pre-civil war Syria, Aleppo was considered the capital of Syrian industry. The economy of the city was mainly driven by textiles, chemicals, pharmaceutics, agro-processing industries, electrical commodities, alcoholic beverages, engineering and tourism. It occupied a dominant position in the country&#x27;s manufacturing output, with a share of more than 50% of manufacturing employment, and an even greater export share.
Possessing the most developed commercial and industrial plants in Syria, Aleppo is a major centre for manufacturing precious metals and stones. The annual amount of the processed gold produced in Aleppo is around 8.5 tonnes, making up to 40% of the entire manufactured gold in Syria.

The industrial city of Aleppo in Sheikh Najjar district is one of the largest in Syria and the region. Occupying an area of in the north-eastern suburbs of Aleppo, the total investments in the city counted more than US$3.4 billion during 2010. Still under development, it is envisaged to open hotels, exhibition centres and other facilities within the industrial city.

In July 2022, the Aleppo Thermal Power Plant, which generates 200 megawatts of electricity for the city and its surroundings, was put into partial operation after restoration.

The old traditional crafts are well-preserved in the old part of the city. The famous laurel soap of Aleppo is considered to be the world&#x27;s first hard soap.

===Construction===

In the 2000s, Aleppo was one of the fastest-growing cities in Syria and the Middle East. Many villagers and inhabitants of other Syrian districts are migrating to Aleppo in an effort to find better job opportunities, a fact that always increases population pressure, with a growing demand for new residential capacity. New districts and residential communities have been built in the suburbs of Aleppo, many of them were still under construction .

Two major construction projects are scheduled in Aleppo: the &quot;Old City Revival&quot; project and the &quot;Reopening of the stream bed of Queiq River&quot;:
*The Old City revival project completed its first phase by the end of 2008, and the second phase started in early 2010. The purpose of the project is the preservation of the old city of Aleppo with its souqs and khans, and restoration of the narrow alleys of the old city and the roads around the citadel.
*The restoration of Queiq River is directed towards the revival of the flow of the river, demolishing both the artificial cover of the stream bed and the reinforcement of the stream banks along the river in the city centre. The flow of the river was blocked during the 1960s by the Turks, turning the river into a tiny sewage channel, something that led the authorities to cover the stream during the 1970s. In 2008 the flow of pure water was restored through the efforts of the Syrian government, granting a new life to the Quweiq River. 

Like other major Syrian cities, Aleppo is suffering from the dispersal of informal settlements: almost half of its population (around 1.2 million) is estimated to live in 22 informal settlements of different types.

==Education==

As the main economic centre of Syria, Aleppo has a large number of educational institutions. According to the UNICEF, there are around over 1280 schools in Aleppo and its suburbs that welcomed 485,000 new students as of September 2018, and around 25,000 students resumed their learning as of December 2021.
Not to mention there are some colleges. In addition to the University of Aleppo, there are state colleges and private universities which attract large numbers of students from other regions of Syria and the Arab countries. The number of the students in Aleppo University is more than 60,000. The university has 18 faculties and 8 technical colleges in the city of Aleppo.

Currently, there are two private universities operating in the city: al-Shahba University (SU) and Mamoun University for Science and Technology (MUST). Branches of the state conservatory and the fine arts school are also operating in the city.

Aleppo is home to several Christian schools, such as St. Mariam&#x27;s Christian School (the city&#x27;s main Christian school) and Armenian private schools as well as two international schools: International School of Aleppo and Lycée Français d&#x27;Alep.

==Sport==

The city of Aleppo is considered as important centre of team sports with football being the most popular in the city. The five major sporting clubs of the city are al-Ittihad SC, al-Hurriya SC, al-Yarmouk SC, Jalaa SC and Ouroube SC. Many other sport clubs are located in several districts of the city including al-Herafyeen SC, Shorta Aleppo SC, Ommal Aleppo SC, Nayrab SC, al-Shahbaa SC, al-Qala&#x27;a SC and Aleppo Railways SC.

Basketball is also played in the city. All of the 5 Aleppine major sport clubs participate in the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s top division of the Syrian Basketball League, in which both Jalaa SC and Al-Ittihad SC consecutively dominated winning the league from 1956 to 1993. 

In July 2022, international qualifying matches were played in Aleppo for the first time since the beginning of the conflict. In the Hamadaniah Arena, the Syrian national team met the teams of Iran and Bahrain as part of the qualification for the World Cup.

Other sports being practiced by the major clubs in the city include tennis, handball, volleyball, athletics, table tennis and swimming.

With a capacity of 53,200 seats, the Aleppo International Stadium is the largest sports venue in Syria. Other major sport venues in the city include the Al-Hamadaniah Sports Arena, Bassel al-Assad Swimming Complex, and Al-Hamadaniah Olympic Swimming and Diving Complex.

On 29 January 2017, Aleppo hosted the first sports event since 2012, when the local football rivals al-Ittihad SC and al-Hurriya SC played at the Ri&#x27;ayet al-Shabab Stadium, within the frames of the 2016–17 Syrian Premier League.

==Municipality==

The city of Aleppo is the capital of Aleppo Governorate and the centre of Mount Simeon District. Aleppo City Council is the governing body of the city. The first municipality council was formed in 1868. However, the governor being appointed directly by the president of the republic, has a supreme authority over the city and the entire governorate. But the city is managed directly by the mayor.

===Subdivisions===
Districts in Aleppo can be considered in four categories:
*Old quarters inside the walls of the ancient city.
*Old quarters outside the walls of the ancient city.
*Modern neighborhoods, including a newly developed area called The New Aleppo.
*Informal settlements.

===Integrated Urban Development in Aleppo===

The &quot;Integrated Urban Development in Aleppo&quot; (UDP) is a joint programme between the German Development Cooperation (GTZ) and the Municipality of Aleppo. The programme promotes capacities for sustainable urban management and development at the national and municipal level.

The Programme has three fields of work:
# Aleppo City Development Strategy (CDS): promoting support structures for the municipality, including capacity building, networking, and developing municipal strength in the national development dialogue.
# Informal Settlements (IS): includes strategy and management development of informal settlements.
# The Project for the Rehabilitation of the Old City of Aleppo (OCA): includes further support for the rehabilitation of the Old City, as well as for a city development strategy oriented to the long term.

The UDP cooperates closely with other interventions in the sector, namely the EU-supported &#x27;Municipal Administration Modernization&#x27; programme. It is planned to operate from 2007 to 2016.

===Preservation of the ancient city===

As an ancient trading centre, Aleppo has impressive &quot;souqs&quot;, &quot;khans&quot;, &quot;hammams&quot;, &quot;madrasas&quot;, mosques and churches, all in need of more care and preservation work. After World War II the city was significantly redesigned; in 1954 French architect André Gutton had a number of wide new roads cut through the city to allow easier passage for modern traffic. Between 1954 and 1983 many buildings in the old city were demolished to allow for the construction of modern apartment blocks, particularly in the northwestern areas (Bab al-Faraj and Bab al-Jinan). As awareness for the need to preserve this unique cultural heritage increased, Gutton&#x27;s master plan was finally abandoned in 1979 to be replaced with a new plan presented by the Swiss expert and urban designer Stefano Bianca, which adopted the idea of &quot;preserving the traditional architectural style of Ancient Aleppo&quot; paving the way for UNESCO to declare the Old City of Aleppo as a World Heritage Site in 1986.

Several international institutions have joined efforts with local authorities and the Aleppo Archaeological Society, to rehabilitate the old city by accommodating contemporary life while preserving the old one. The governorate and the municipality are implementing serious programmes directed towards the enhancement of the ancient city and Jdeydeh quarter.

The German Technical Cooperation (GTZ) and Aga Khan Foundation (within the frames of Aga Khan Historic Cities Programme) has made a great contribution in the preservation process of the old city.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Aleppo is twinned with:
* Beirut, Lebanon
* Gaziantep, Turkey (2005)
* Kilis, Turkey
* Osmangazi, Turkey (2010)

<text>Gene expression is the process by which information from a gene is used in the synthesis of a functional gene product that enables it to produce end products, proteins or non-coding RNA, and ultimately affect a phenotype. These products are often proteins, but in non-protein-coding genes such as transfer RNA (tRNA) and small nuclear RNA (snRNA), the product is a functional non-coding RNA.
The process of gene expression is used by all known life—eukaryotes (including multicellular organisms), prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea), and utilized by viruses—to generate the macromolecular machinery for life.

In genetics, gene expression is the most fundamental level at which the genotype gives rise to the phenotype, &quot;i.e.&quot; observable trait. The genetic information stored in DNA represents the genotype, whereas the phenotype results from the &quot;interpretation&quot; of that information. Such phenotypes are often displayed by the synthesis of proteins that control the organism&#x27;s structure and development, or that act as enzymes catalyzing specific metabolic pathways.

All steps in the gene expression process may be modulated (regulated), including the transcription, RNA splicing, translation, and post-translational modification of a protein. Regulation of gene expression gives control over the timing, location, and amount of a given gene product (protein or ncRNA) present in a cell and can have a profound effect on the cellular structure and function. Regulation of gene expression is the basis for cellular differentiation, development, morphogenesis and the versatility and adaptability of any organism. Gene regulation may therefore serve as a substrate for evolutionary change.

==Mechanism==

===Transcription===
The production of a RNA copy from a DNA strand is called transcription, and is performed by RNA polymerases, which add one ribonucleotide at a time to a growing RNA strand as per the complementarity law of the nucleotide bases. This RNA is complementary to the template 3′ → 5′ DNA strand, with the exception that thymines (T) are replaced with uracils (U) in the RNA and possible errors.

In bacteria, transcription is carried out by a single type of RNA polymerase, which needs to bind a DNA sequence called a Pribnow box with the help of the sigma factor protein (σ factor) to start transcription. In eukaryotes, transcription is performed in the nucleus by three types of RNA polymerases, each of which needs a special DNA sequence called the promoter and a set of DNA-binding proteins—transcription factors—to initiate the process (see regulation of transcription below). RNA polymerase I is responsible for transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcribes all protein-coding genes but also some non-coding RNAs (&quot;e.g.&quot;, snRNAs, snoRNAs or long non-coding RNAs). RNA polymerase III transcribes 5S rRNA, transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, and some small non-coding RNAs (&quot;e.g.&quot;, 7SK). Transcription ends when the polymerase encounters a sequence called the terminator.

===mRNA processing===
While transcription of prokaryotic protein-coding genes creates messenger RNA (mRNA) that is ready for translation into protein, transcription of eukaryotic genes leaves a primary transcript of RNA (pre-RNA), which first has to undergo a series of modifications to become a mature RNA. Types and steps involved in the maturation processes vary between coding and non-coding preRNAs; &quot;i.e.&quot; even though preRNA molecules for both mRNA and tRNA undergo splicing, the steps and machinery involved are different. The processing of non-coding RNA is described below (non-coding RNA maturation).

The processing of pre-mRNA include 5′ &quot;capping&quot;, which is set of enzymatic reactions that add 7-methylguanosine (m7G) to the 5′ end of pre-mRNA and thus protect the RNA from degradation by exonucleases. The m7G cap is then bound by cap binding complex heterodimer (CBP20/CBP80), which aids in mRNA export to cytoplasm and also protect the RNA from decapping.

Another modification is 3′ &quot;cleavage and polyadenylation&quot;. They occur if polyadenylation signal sequence (5′- AAUAAA-3′) is present in pre-mRNA, which is usually between protein-coding sequence and terminator. The pre-mRNA is first cleaved and then a series of ~200 adenines (A) are added to form poly(A) tail, which protects the RNA from degradation. The poly(A) tail is bound by multiple poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) necessary for mRNA export and translation re-initiation. In the inverse process of deadenylation, poly(A) tails are shortened by the CCR4-Not 3′-5′ exonuclease, which often leads to full transcript decay.
A very important modification of eukaryotic pre-mRNA is &quot;RNA splicing&quot;. The majority of eukaryotic pre-mRNAs consist of alternating segments called exons and introns. During the process of splicing, an RNA-protein catalytical complex known as spliceosome catalyzes two transesterification reactions, which remove an intron and release it in form of lariat structure, and then splice neighbouring exons together. In certain cases, some introns or exons can be either removed or retained in mature mRNA. This so-called alternative splicing creates series of different transcripts originating from a single gene. Because these transcripts can be potentially translated into different proteins, splicing extends the complexity of eukaryotic gene expression and the size of a species proteome.

Extensive RNA processing may be an evolutionary advantage made possible by the nucleus of eukaryotes. In prokaryotes, transcription and translation happen together, whilst in eukaryotes, the nuclear membrane separates the two processes, giving time for RNA processing to occur.

===Non-coding RNA maturation===

In most organisms non-coding genes (ncRNA) are transcribed as precursors that undergo further processing. In the case of ribosomal RNAs (rRNA), they are often transcribed as a pre-rRNA that contains one or more rRNAs. The pre-rRNA is cleaved and modified (2′-&quot;O&quot;-methylation and pseudouridine formation) at specific sites by approximately 150 different small nucleolus-restricted RNA species, called snoRNAs. SnoRNAs associate with proteins, forming snoRNPs. While snoRNA part basepair with the target RNA and thus position the modification at a precise site, the protein part performs the catalytical reaction. In eukaryotes, in particular a snoRNP called RNase, MRP cleaves the 45S pre-rRNA into the 28S, 5.8S, and 18S rRNAs. The rRNA and RNA processing factors form large aggregates called the nucleolus.

In the case of transfer RNA (tRNA), for example, the 5′ sequence is removed by RNase P, whereas the 3′ end is removed by the tRNase Z enzyme and the non-templated 3′ CCA tail is added by a nucleotidyl transferase. In the case of micro RNA (miRNA), miRNAs are first transcribed as primary transcripts or pri-miRNA with a cap and poly-A tail and processed to short, 70-nucleotide stem-loop structures known as pre-miRNA in the cell nucleus by the enzymes Drosha and Pasha. After being exported, it is then processed to mature miRNAs in the cytoplasm by interaction with the endonuclease Dicer, which also initiates the formation of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), composed of the Argonaute protein.

Even snRNAs and snoRNAs themselves undergo series of modification before they become part of functional RNP complex. This is done either in the nucleoplasm or in the specialized compartments called Cajal bodies. Their bases are methylated or pseudouridinilated by a group of small Cajal body-specific RNAs (scaRNAs), which are structurally similar to snoRNAs.

===RNA export===

In eukaryotes most mature RNA must be exported to the cytoplasm from the nucleus. While some RNAs function in the nucleus, many RNAs are transported through the nuclear pores and into the cytosol. Export of RNAs requires association with specific proteins known as exportins. Specific exportin molecules are responsible for the export of a given RNA type. mRNA transport also requires the correct association with Exon Junction Complex (EJC), which ensures that correct processing of the mRNA is completed before export. In some cases RNAs are additionally transported to a specific part of the cytoplasm, such as a synapse; they are then towed by motor proteins that bind through linker proteins to specific sequences (called &quot;zipcodes&quot;) on the RNA.

===Translation===

For some non-coding RNA, the mature RNA is the final gene product. In the case of messenger RNA (mRNA) the RNA is an information carrier coding for the synthesis of one or more proteins. mRNA carrying a single protein sequence (common in eukaryotes) is monocistronic whilst mRNA carrying multiple protein sequences (common in prokaryotes) is known as polycistronic.
Every mRNA consists of three parts: a 5′ untranslated region (5′UTR), a protein-coding region or open reading frame (ORF), and a 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR). The coding region carries information for protein synthesis encoded by the genetic code to form triplets. Each triplet of nucleotides of the coding region is called a codon and corresponds to a binding site complementary to an anticodon triplet in transfer RNA. Transfer RNAs with the same anticodon sequence always carry an identical type of amino acid. Amino acids are then chained together by the ribosome according to the order of triplets in the coding region. The ribosome helps transfer RNA to bind to messenger RNA and takes the amino acid from each transfer RNA and makes a structure-less protein out of it. Each mRNA molecule is translated into many protein molecules, on average ~2800 in mammals.

In prokaryotes translation generally occurs at the point of transcription (co-transcriptionally), often using a messenger RNA that is still in the process of being created. In eukaryotes translation can occur in a variety of regions of the cell depending on where the protein being written is supposed to be. Major locations are the cytoplasm for soluble cytoplasmic proteins and the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum for proteins that are for export from the cell or insertion into a cell membrane. Proteins that are supposed to be produced at the endoplasmic reticulum are recognised part-way through the translation process. This is governed by the signal recognition particle—a protein that binds to the ribosome and directs it to the endoplasmic reticulum when it finds a signal peptide on the growing (nascent) amino acid chain.

===Folding===

Each protein exists as an unfolded polypeptide or random coil when translated from a sequence of mRNA into a linear chain of amino acids. This polypeptide lacks any developed three-dimensional structure (the left hand side of the neighboring figure). The polypeptide then folds into its characteristic and functional three-dimensional structure from a random coil. Amino acids interact with each other to produce a well-defined three-dimensional structure, the folded protein (the right hand side of the figure) known as the native state. The resulting three-dimensional structure is determined by the amino acid sequence (Anfinsen&#x27;s dogma).

The correct three-dimensional structure is essential to function, although some parts of functional proteins may remain unfolded. Failure to fold into the intended shape usually produces inactive proteins with different properties including toxic prions. Several neurodegenerative and other diseases are believed to result from the accumulation of &quot;misfolded&quot; proteins. Many allergies are caused by the folding of the proteins, for the immune system does not produce antibodies for certain protein structures.

Enzymes called chaperones assist the newly formed protein to attain (fold into) the 3-dimensional structure it needs to function. Similarly, RNA chaperones help RNAs attain their functional shapes. Assisting protein folding is one of the main roles of the endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotes.

===Translocation===
Secretory proteins of eukaryotes or prokaryotes must be translocated to enter the secretory pathway. Newly synthesized proteins are directed to the eukaryotic Sec61 or prokaryotic SecYEG translocation channel by signal peptides. The efficiency of protein secretion in eukaryotes is very dependent on the signal peptide which has been used.

===Protein transport===
Many proteins are destined for other parts of the cell than the cytosol and a wide range of signalling sequences or (signal peptides) are used to direct proteins to where they are supposed to be. In prokaryotes this is normally a simple process due to limited compartmentalisation of the cell. However, in eukaryotes there is a great variety of different targeting processes to ensure the protein arrives at the correct organelle.

Not all proteins remain within the cell and many are exported, for example, digestive enzymes, hormones and extracellular matrix proteins. In eukaryotes the export pathway is well developed and the main mechanism for the export of these proteins is translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum, followed by transport via the Golgi apparatus.

=== Protein Degradation ===
Protein degradation is a major regulatory mechanism of gene expression and contributes substantially for shaping proteomes, especially of tissues and cells that do not grow very fast. Protein degradation is a highly regulated processes, which results in significant and context dependent variation in degradation rates between proteins as well as for the same protein across cell types and tissue types. This variation can contribute about 40 % of the variance of protein levels across slowly growing tissues, with the remaining 60 % likely coming from protein synthesis, including transcription and translation as explained above. 

==Regulation of gene expression==

Regulation of gene expression is the control of the amount and timing of appearance of the functional product of a gene. Control of expression is vital to allow a cell to produce the gene products it needs when it needs them; in turn, this gives cells the flexibility to adapt to a variable environment, external signals, damage to the cell, and other stimuli. More generally, gene regulation gives the cell control over all structure and function, and is the basis for cellular differentiation, morphogenesis and the versatility and adaptability of any organism.

Numerous terms are used to describe types of genes depending on how they are regulated; these include:
* A constitutive gene is a gene that is transcribed continually as opposed to a facultative gene, which is only transcribed when needed.
* A &quot;housekeeping gene&quot; is a gene that is required to maintain basic cellular function and so is typically expressed in all cell types of an organism. Examples include actin, GAPDH and ubiquitin. Some housekeeping genes are transcribed at a relatively constant rate and these genes can be used as a reference point in experiments to measure the expression rates of other genes.
* A facultative gene is a gene only transcribed when needed as opposed to a constitutive gene.
* An inducible gene is a gene whose expression is either responsive to environmental change or dependent on the position in the cell cycle.

Any step of gene expression may be modulated, from the DNA-RNA transcription step to post-translational modification of a protein. The stability of the final gene product, whether it is RNA or protein, also contributes to the expression level of the gene—an unstable product results in a low expression level. In general gene expression is regulated through changes in the number and type of interactions between molecules that collectively influence transcription of DNA and translation of RNA.

Some simple examples of where gene expression is important are:
* Control of insulin expression so it gives a signal for blood glucose regulation.
* X chromosome inactivation in female mammals to prevent an &quot;overdose&quot; of the genes it contains.
* Cyclin expression levels control progression through the eukaryotic cell cycle.

===Transcriptional regulation===
Regulation of transcription can be broken down into three main routes of influence; genetic (direct interaction of a control factor with the gene), modulation interaction of a control factor with the transcription machinery and epigenetic (non-sequence changes in DNA structure that influence transcription).

Direct interaction with DNA is the simplest and the most direct method by which a protein changes transcription levels. Genes often have several protein binding sites around the coding region with the specific function of regulating transcription. There are many classes of regulatory DNA binding sites known as enhancers, insulators and silencers. The mechanisms for regulating transcription are varied, from blocking key binding sites on the DNA for RNA polymerase to acting as an activator and promoting transcription by assisting RNA polymerase binding.

The activity of transcription factors is further modulated by intracellular signals causing protein post-translational modification including phosphorylation, acetylation, or glycosylation. These changes influence a transcription factor&#x27;s ability to bind, directly or indirectly, to promoter DNA, to recruit RNA polymerase, or to favor elongation of a newly synthesized RNA molecule.

The nuclear membrane in eukaryotes allows further regulation of transcription factors by the duration of their presence in the nucleus, which is regulated by reversible changes in their structure and by binding of other proteins. Environmental stimuli or endocrine signals may cause modification of regulatory proteins eliciting cascades of intracellular signals, which result in regulation of gene expression.

It has become apparent that there is a significant influence of non-DNA-sequence specific effects on transcription. These effects are referred to as epigenetic and involve the higher order structure of DNA, non-sequence specific DNA binding proteins and chemical modification of DNA. In general epigenetic effects alter the accessibility of DNA to proteins and so modulate transcription.

In eukaryotes the structure of chromatin, controlled by the histone code, regulates access to DNA with significant impacts on the expression of genes in euchromatin and heterochromatin areas.

====Enhancers, transcription factors, mediator complex and DNA loops in mammalian transcription====
Gene expression in mammals is regulated by many cis-regulatory elements, including core promoters and promoter-proximal elements that are located near the transcription start sites of genes, upstream on the DNA (towards the 5&#x27; region of the sense strand). Other important cis-regulatory modules are localized in DNA regions that are distant from the transcription start sites. These include enhancers, silencers, insulators and tethering elements. Enhancers and their associated transcription factors have a leading role in the regulation of gene expression.

Enhancers are genome regions that regulate genes. Enhancers control cell-type-specific gene expression programs, most often by looping through long distances to come in physical proximity with the promoters of their target genes. Multiple enhancers, each often tens or hundred of thousands of nucleotides distant from their target genes, loop to their target gene promoters and coordinate with each other to control gene expression.

The illustration shows an enhancer looping around to come into proximity with the promoter of a target gene. The loop is stabilized by a dimer of a connector protein (e.g. dimer of CTCF or YY1). One member of the dimer is anchored to its binding motif on the enhancer and the other member is anchored to its binding motif on the promoter (represented by the red zigzags in the illustration). Several cell function-specific transcription factors (among the about 1,600 transcription factors in a human cell) generally bind to specific motifs on an enhancer. A small combination of these enhancer-bound transcription factors, when brought close to a promoter by a DNA loop, govern transcription level of the target gene. Mediator (a complex usually consisting of about 26 proteins in an interacting structure) communicates regulatory signals from enhancer DNA-bound transcription factors directly to the RNA polymerase II (pol II) enzyme bound to the promoter.

Enhancers, when active, are generally transcribed from both strands of DNA with RNA polymerases acting in two different directions, producing two eRNAs as illustrated in the figure. An inactive enhancer may be bound by an inactive transcription factor. Phosphorylation of the transcription factor may activate it and that activated transcription factor may then activate the enhancer to which it is bound (see small red star representing phosphorylation of transcription factor bound to enhancer in the illustration). An activated enhancer begins transcription of its RNA before activating transcription of messenger RNA from its target gene.

===DNA methylation and demethylation in transcriptional regulation===

DNA methylation is a widespread mechanism for epigenetic influence on gene expression and is seen in bacteria and eukaryotes and has roles in heritable transcription silencing and transcription regulation. Methylation most often occurs on a cytosine (see Figure). Methylation of cytosine primarily occurs in dinucleotide sequences where a cytosine is followed by a guanine, a CpG site. The number of CpG sites in the human genome is about 28 million. Depending on the type of cell, about 70% of the CpG sites have a methylated cytosine.

Methylation of cytosine in DNA has a major role in regulating gene expression. Methylation of CpGs in a promoter region of a gene usually represses gene transcription while methylation of CpGs in the body of a gene increases expression. TET enzymes play a central role in demethylation of methylated cytosines. Demethylation of CpGs in a gene promoter by TET enzyme activity increases transcription of the gene.

===Transcriptional regulation in learning and memory===


In a rat, contextual fear conditioning (CFC) is a painful learning experience. Just one episode of CFC can result in a life-long fearful memory. After an episode of CFC, cytosine methylation is altered in the promoter regions of about 9.17% of all genes in the hippocampus neuron DNA of a rat. The hippocampus is where new memories are initially stored. After CFC about 500 genes have increased transcription (often due to demethylation of CpG sites in a promoter region) and about 1,000 genes have decreased transcription (often due to newly formed 5-methylcytosine at CpG sites in a promoter region). The pattern of induced and repressed genes within neurons appears to provide a molecular basis for forming the first transient memory of this training event in the hippocampus of the rat brain.

Some specific mechanisms guiding new DNA methylations and new DNA demethylations in the hippocampus during memory establishment have been established (see for summary). One mechanism includes guiding the short isoform of the TET1 DNA demethylation enzyme, TET1s, to about 600 locations on the genome. The guidance is performed by association of TET1s with EGR1 protein, a transcription factor important in memory formation. Bringing TET1s to these locations initiates DNA demethylation at those sites, up-regulating associated genes. A second mechanism involves DNMT3A2, a splice-isoform of DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A, which adds methyl groups to cytosines in DNA. This isoform is induced by synaptic activity, and its location of action appears to be determined by histone post-translational modifications (a histone code). The resulting new messenger RNAs are then transported by messenger RNP particles (neuronal granules) to synapses of the neurons, where they can be translated into proteins affecting the activities of synapses.

In particular, the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene (&quot;BDNF&quot;) is known as a &quot;learning gene&quot;. After CFC there was upregulation of &quot;BDNF&quot; gene expression, related to decreased CpG methylation of certain internal promoters of the gene, and this was correlated with learning.

===Transcriptional regulation in cancer===
The majority of gene promoters contain a CpG island with numerous CpG sites. When many of a gene&#x27;s promoter CpG sites are methylated the gene becomes silenced. Colorectal cancers typically have 3 to 6 driver mutations and 33 to 66 hitchhiker or passenger mutations. However, transcriptional silencing may be of more importance than mutation in causing progression to cancer. For example, in colorectal cancers about 600 to 800 genes are transcriptionally silenced by CpG island methylation (see regulation of transcription in cancer). Transcriptional repression in cancer can also occur by other epigenetic mechanisms, such as altered expression of microRNAs. In breast cancer, transcriptional repression of BRCA1 may occur more frequently by over-transcribed microRNA-182 than by hypermethylation of the BRCA1 promoter (see Low expression of BRCA1 in breast and ovarian cancers).

===Post-transcriptional regulation===

In eukaryotes, where export of RNA is required before translation is possible, nuclear export is thought to provide additional control over gene expression. All transport in and out of the nucleus is via the nuclear pore and transport is controlled by a wide range of importin and exportin proteins.

Expression of a gene coding for a protein is only possible if the messenger RNA carrying the code survives long enough to be translated. In a typical cell, an RNA molecule is only stable if specifically protected from degradation. RNA degradation has particular importance in regulation of expression in eukaryotic cells where mRNA has to travel significant distances before being translated. In eukaryotes, RNA is stabilised by certain post-transcriptional modifications, particularly the 5′ cap and poly-adenylated tail.

Intentional degradation of mRNA is used not just as a defence mechanism from foreign RNA (normally from viruses) but also as a route of mRNA &quot;destabilisation&quot;. If an mRNA molecule has a complementary sequence to a small interfering RNA then it is targeted for destruction via the RNA interference pathway.

===Three prime untranslated regions and microRNAs===
Three prime untranslated regions (3′UTRs) of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) often contain regulatory sequences that post-transcriptionally influence gene expression. Such 3′-UTRs often contain both binding sites for microRNAs (miRNAs) as well as for regulatory proteins. By binding to specific sites within the 3′-UTR, miRNAs can decrease gene expression of various mRNAs by either inhibiting translation or directly causing degradation of the transcript. The 3′-UTR also may have silencer regions that bind repressor proteins that inhibit the expression of a mRNA.

The 3′-UTR often contains microRNA response elements (MREs). MREs are sequences to which miRNAs bind. These are prevalent motifs within 3′-UTRs. Among all regulatory motifs within the 3′-UTRs (e.g. including silencer regions), MREs make up about half of the motifs.

As of 2014, the miRBase web site, an archive of miRNA sequences and annotations, listed 28,645 entries in 233 biologic species. Of these, 1,881 miRNAs were in annotated human miRNA loci. miRNAs were predicted to have an average of about four hundred target mRNAs (affecting expression of several hundred genes). Friedman et al. estimate that &gt;45,000 miRNA target sites within human mRNA 3′UTRs are conserved above background levels, and &gt;60% of human protein-coding genes have been under selective pressure to maintain pairing to miRNAs.

Direct experiments show that a single miRNA can reduce the stability of hundreds of unique mRNAs. Other experiments show that a single miRNA may repress the production of hundreds of proteins, but that this repression often is relatively mild (less than 2-fold).

The effects of miRNA dysregulation of gene expression seem to be important in cancer. For instance, in gastrointestinal cancers, nine miRNAs have been identified as epigenetically altered and effective in down regulating DNA repair enzymes.

The effects of miRNA dysregulation of gene expression also seem to be important in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and autism spectrum disorders.

===Translational regulation===

Direct regulation of translation is less prevalent than control of transcription or mRNA stability but is occasionally used. Inhibition of protein translation is a major target for toxins and antibiotics, so they can kill a cell by overriding its normal gene expression control. Protein synthesis inhibitors include the antibiotic neomycin and the toxin ricin.

===Post-translational modifications===

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are covalent modifications to proteins. Like RNA splicing, they help to significantly diversify the proteome. These modifications are usually catalyzed by enzymes. Additionally, processes like covalent additions to amino acid side chain residues can often be reversed by other enzymes. However, some, like the proteolytic cleavage of the protein backbone, are irreversible.

PTMs play many important roles in the cell. For example, phosphorylation is primarily involved in activating and deactivating proteins and in signaling pathways. PTMs are involved in transcriptional regulation: an important function of acetylation and methylation is histone tail modification, which alters how accessible DNA is for transcription. They can also be seen in the immune system, where glycosylation plays a key role. One type of PTM can initiate another type of PTM, as can be seen in how ubiquitination tags proteins for degradation through proteolysis. Proteolysis, other than being involved in breaking down proteins, is also important in activating and deactivating them, and in regulating biological processes such as DNA transcription and cell death.

==Measurement==

Measuring gene expression is an important part of many life sciences, as the ability to quantify the level at which a particular gene is expressed within a cell, tissue or organism can provide a lot of valuable information. For example, measuring gene expression can:
* Identify viral infection of a cell (viral protein expression).
* Determine an individual&#x27;s susceptibility to cancer (oncogene expression).
* Find if a bacterium is resistant to penicillin (beta-lactamase expression).
* Gene expression profiling evaluates a panel of genes to help understand the fundamental mechanism of a cell. This is increasingly used in cancer therapy to target specific chemotherapy. (&quot;See&quot; RNA-Seq and DNA_microarray for details.)
Similarly, the analysis of the location of protein expression is a powerful tool, and this can be done on an organismal or cellular scale. Investigation of localization is particularly important for the study of development in multicellular organisms and as an indicator of protein function in single cells. Ideally, measurement of expression is done by detecting the final gene product (for many genes, this is the protein); however, it is often easier to detect one of the precursors, typically mRNA and to infer gene-expression levels from these measurements.

===mRNA quantification===
Levels of mRNA can be quantitatively measured by northern blotting, which provides size and sequence information about the mRNA molecules. A sample of RNA is separated on an agarose gel and hybridized to a radioactively labeled RNA probe that is complementary to the target sequence. The radiolabeled RNA is then detected by an autoradiograph. Because the use of radioactive reagents makes the procedure time-consuming and potentially dangerous, alternative labeling and detection methods, such as digoxigenin and biotin chemistries, have been developed. Perceived disadvantages of Northern blotting are that large quantities of RNA are required and that quantification may not be completely accurate, as it involves measuring band strength in an image of a gel. On the other hand, the additional mRNA size information from the Northern blot allows the discrimination of alternately spliced transcripts.

Another approach for measuring mRNA abundance is RT-qPCR. In this technique, reverse transcription is followed by quantitative PCR. Reverse transcription first generates a DNA template from the mRNA; this single-stranded template is called cDNA. The cDNA template is then amplified in the quantitative step, during which the fluorescence emitted by labeled hybridization probes or intercalating dyes changes as the DNA amplification process progresses. With a carefully constructed standard curve, qPCR can produce an absolute measurement of the number of copies of original mRNA, typically in units of copies per nanolitre of homogenized tissue or copies per cell. qPCR is very sensitive (detection of a single mRNA molecule is theoretically possible), but can be expensive depending on the type of reporter used; fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probes are more expensive than non-specific intercalating fluorescent dyes.

For expression profiling, or high-throughput analysis of many genes within a sample, quantitative PCR may be performed for hundreds of genes simultaneously in the case of low-density arrays. A second approach is the hybridization microarray. A single array or &quot;chip&quot; may contain probes to determine transcript levels for every known gene in the genome of one or more organisms. Alternatively, &quot;tag based&quot; technologies like Serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) and RNA-Seq, which can provide a relative measure of the cellular concentration of different mRNAs, can be used. An advantage of tag-based methods is the &quot;open architecture&quot;, allowing for the exact measurement of any transcript, with a known or unknown sequence. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) such as RNA-Seq is another approach, producing vast quantities of sequence data that can be matched to a reference genome. Although NGS is comparatively time-consuming, expensive, and resource-intensive, it can identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms, splice-variants, and novel genes, and can also be used to profile expression in organisms for which little or no sequence information is available.

===RNA profiles in Wikipedia===
Profiles like these are found for almost all proteins listed in Wikipedia. They are generated by organizations such as the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation and the European Bioinformatics Institute. Additional information can be found by searching their databases (for an example of the GLUT4 transporter pictured here, see citation). These profiles indicate the level of DNA expression (and hence RNA produced) of a certain protein in a certain tissue, and are color-coded accordingly in the images located in the Protein Box on the right side of each Wikipedia page.

===Protein quantification===
For genes encoding proteins, the expression level can be directly assessed by a number of methods with some clear analogies to the techniques for mRNA quantification.

One of the most commonly used methods is to perform a Western blot against the protein of interest. This gives information on the size of the protein in addition to its identity. A sample (often cellular lysate) is separated on a polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a membrane and then probed with an antibody to the protein of interest. The antibody can either be conjugated to a fluorophore or to horseradish peroxidase for imaging and/or quantification. The gel-based nature of this assay makes quantification less accurate, but it has the advantage of being able to identify later modifications to the protein, for example proteolysis or ubiquitination, from changes in size.

===mRNA-protein correlation===
While transcription directly reflects gene expression, the copy number of mRNA molecules does not directly correlate with the number of protein molecules translated from mRNA. Quantification of both protein and mRNA permits a correlation of the two levels. Regulation on each step of gene expression can impact the correlation, as shown for regulation of translation or protein stability. Post-translational factors, such as protein transport in highly polar cells, can influence the measured mRNA-protein correlation as well.

===Localization===

Analysis of expression is not limited to quantification; localization can also be determined. mRNA can be detected with a suitably labelled complementary mRNA strand and protein can be detected via labelled antibodies. The probed sample is then observed by microscopy to identify where the mRNA or protein is.

By replacing the gene with a new version fused to a green fluorescent protein marker or similar, expression may be directly quantified in live cells. This is done by imaging using a fluorescence microscope. It is very difficult to clone a GFP-fused protein into its native location in the genome without affecting expression levels, so this method often cannot be used to measure endogenous gene expression. It is, however, widely used to measure the expression of a gene artificially introduced into the cell, for example via an expression vector. By fusing a target protein to a fluorescent reporter, the protein&#x27;s behavior, including its cellular localization and expression level, can be significantly changed.

The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay works by using antibodies immobilised on a microtiter plate to capture proteins of interest from samples added to the well. Using a detection antibody conjugated to an enzyme or fluorophore the quantity of bound protein can be accurately measured by fluorometric or colourimetric detection. The detection process is very similar to that of a Western blot, but by avoiding the gel steps more accurate quantification can be achieved.

==Expression system==

An expression system is a system specifically designed for the production of a gene product of choice. This is normally a protein although may also be RNA, such as tRNA or a ribozyme. An expression system consists of a gene, normally encoded by DNA, and the molecular machinery required to transcribe the DNA into mRNA and translate the mRNA into protein using the reagents provided. In the broadest sense this includes every living cell but the term is more normally used to refer to expression as a laboratory tool. An expression system is therefore often artificial in some manner. Expression systems are, however, a fundamentally natural process. Viruses are an excellent example where they replicate by using the host cell as an expression system for the viral proteins and genome.

===Inducible expression===
Doxycycline is also used in &quot;Tet-on&quot; and &quot;Tet-off&quot; tetracycline controlled transcriptional activation to regulate transgene expression in organisms and cell cultures.

===In nature===
In addition to these biological tools, certain naturally observed configurations of DNA (genes, promoters, enhancers, repressors) and the associated machinery itself are referred to as an expression system. This term is normally used in the case where a gene or set of genes is switched on under well defined conditions, for example, the simple repressor switch expression system in Lambda phage and the lac operator system in bacteria. Several natural expression systems are directly used or modified and used for artificial expression systems such as the Tet-on and Tet-off expression system.

==Gene networks==

Genes have sometimes been regarded as nodes in a network, with inputs being proteins such as transcription factors, and outputs being the level of gene expression. The node itself performs a function, and the operation of these functions have been interpreted as performing a kind of information processing within cells and determines cellular behavior.

Gene networks can also be constructed without formulating an explicit causal model. This is often the case when assembling networks from large expression data sets. Covariation and correlation of expression is computed across a large sample of cases and measurements (often transcriptome or proteome data). The source of variation can be either experimental or natural (observational). There are several ways to construct gene expression networks, but one common approach is to compute a matrix of all pair-wise correlations of expression across conditions, time points, or individuals and convert the matrix (after thresholding at some cut-off value) into a graphical representation in which nodes represent genes, transcripts, or proteins and edges connecting these nodes represent the strength of association (see GeneNetwork GeneNetwork 2).
