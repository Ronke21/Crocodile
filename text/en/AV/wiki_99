<text>Yunnan is an inland province in Southwestern China. The province spans approximately and has a population of 47.2 million (as of 2020). The capital of the province is Kunming. The province borders the Chinese provinces of Guizhou, Sichuan, autonomous regions of Guangxi and Tibet, as well as Southeast Asian countries Myanmar (Burma), Vietnam, and Laos. Yunnan is China&#x27;s fourth least developed province based on disposable income per capita in 2014.

Yunnan is situated in a mountainous area, with high elevations in the Northwest and low elevations in the Southeast. Most of the population lives in the eastern part of the province. In the west, the altitude can vary from the mountain peaks to river valleys as much as . Yunnan is rich in natural resources and has the largest diversity of plant life in China. Of the approximately 30,000 species of higher plants in China, Yunnan has perhaps 17,000 or more. Yunnan&#x27;s reserves of aluminium, lead, zinc and tin are the largest in China, and there are also major reserves of copper and nickel. Historically, the southwestern Silk Road to Bhitargarh in Bangladesh passed through modern Yunnan.

Parts of Yunnan formed the Dian Kingdom during the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC. The Han dynasty conquered the Dian Kingdom in the late 2nd century BC, establishing the Yizhou Commandery in its place. During the chaos of the Three Kingdoms period, imperial Chinese authority in Yunnan weakened, and much of the region came under the control of the Cuanman. The area was later ruled by the Sino-Tibetan-speaking kingdom of Nanzhao from (738–937), followed by the Bai-ruled Dali Kingdom (937–1253). After the Mongol conquest of the region in the 13th century, Yunnan was conquered and ruled by the Ming dynasty.

From the Yuan dynasty onward, the area was part of a central-government sponsored population movement towards the southwestern frontier, with two major waves of migrants arriving from Han-majority areas in northern and southeast China. As with other parts of China&#x27;s southwest, Japanese occupation in the north during World War II forced another migration of Han people into the region. These two waves of migration contributed to Yunnan being one of the most ethnically diverse provinces of China, with ethnic minorities accounting for about 34 percent of its total population. Major ethnic groups include Yi, Bai, Hani, Zhuang, Dai, and Miao. Yunnan has also been identified as the birthplace of tea, and as the region of origin of the plant genus &quot;Cannabis&quot;.

== Etymology ==

The name &quot;Yunnan&quot; first referred to a place when the Han dynasty created Yunnan County near modern Xiangyun. During the Tang dynasty, Emperor Xuanzong gave Piluoge, the chief of Nanzhao, the title of &quot;King of Yunnan&quot;, because Nanzhao originated from Yunnan county. Gradually the king of Yunnan controlled more and more territory, and &quot;Yunnan&quot; became the common name of this area. Therefore, the Yuan dynasty created the Yunnan Province after it occupied the Dali Kingdom.

Han dynasty literature did not record the etymology of &quot;Yunnan&quot;, and there are many theories about its origin. One common theory states that the name means &quot;south of colorful clouds&quot; (). Some annals in the Ming dynasty, for example &quot;Dian Lüe&quot; () and &quot;Yunnan General Annals&quot; (), support this. However, modern historian Tan Qixiang states that this theory is a superficial explanation of the literal meaning. Another common theory is that the name means &quot;south of Yun Range&quot; () However, this has been disproven because the name &quot;Yunling Mountains&quot; first appeared in Tang dynasty (618–907) literature, but the name &quot;Yunnan&quot; first appeared during the Han dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD). Modern research gives more conjectures. You Zhong said &quot;Yunnan&quot; means &quot;south of the mountain (referring to the Cang Mountain) with clouds&quot;. Wu Guangfan said &quot;Yunnan&quot; might be a Loloish or Bai name.

== History ==
=== Prehistory ===

The Yuanmou Man, a &quot;Homo erectus&quot; fossil unearthed by railway engineers in the 1960s, has been determined to be the oldest-known hominid fossil in China. By the Neolithic period, there were human settlements in the area of Lake Dian. These people used stone tools and constructed simple wooden structures.

=== Dian Kingdom ===
Around the 3rd century BC, the central area of Yunnan around present day Kunming was known as Dian. The Chu general () entered the region from the upper Yangtze River and set himself up as &quot;King of Dian&quot;. He and his followers brought into Yunnan an influx of Chinese influence, the start of a long history of migration and cultural expansion.

=== Qin and Han dynasties ===
In 221 BC, Qin Shi Huang unified China and extended his authority south. Commanderies and counties were established in Yunnan. An existing road in Sichuan – the &quot;Five Foot Way&quot; – was extended south to around present day Qujing, in eastern Yunnan. In 109 BC, the Han dynasty conquered Dian during its southern expeditions. Under orders from Emperor Wu, General () was sent south to Yunnan, eventually establishing the Yizhou commandery. By this time, agricultural technology in Yunnan had improved markedly. The local people used bronze tools, plows and kept a variety of livestock, including cattle, horses, sheep, goats, pigs and dogs. Anthropologists have determined that these people were related to the people now known as the Tai. They lived in tribal congregations, sometimes led by exiled Chinese.

During the Three Kingdoms, the territory of present-day Yunnan, western Guizhou and southern Sichuan was collectively called Nanzhong. The dissolution of Chinese central authority led to increased autonomy for Yunnan and more power for the local tribal structures. In AD 225, the famed statesman Zhuge Liang led three columns into Yunnan to pacify the tribes. His seven captures of Meng Huo, a local magnate, is mythologized in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

=== Cuan Kingdom ===
In the 4th century, northern China was largely overrun by nomadic tribes from the north. In the 320s, the Cuan () clan migrated into Yunnan. Cuan Chen () named himself king and held authority from Lake Dian, then known as Kunchuan. Henceforth the Cuan clan ruled eastern Yunnan for over four hundred years.

International trade flowed through Yunnan. An ancient overland pre-Tang trade route from Yunnan Province passed through Irrawaddy in Burma to reach Bengal. Yunnan was inhabited by so-called barbarians not fully under the control of the Tang government and the route, though ancient, was not used much in pre-Tang times, and Chinese attempts to control the route were disrupted by the rise of Nanzhao.

=== Nanzhao period ===

Yunnan was settled by several local tribes, clans, and cultures before the 8th century. Around Lake Erhai, namely, the Dali area, there emerged six &quot;zhao&quot;: Mengzi (), Yuexi (), Langqiong (), Dengdan (), Shilling (), and Mengshe (). &quot;Zhao&quot; () was an indigenous non-Chinese language term meaning &quot;king&quot; or &quot;kingdom.&quot; Among the six regimes Mengshe was located south of the other five; therefore given the new, larger context, it was called Nanzhao (Southern Kingdom).

By the 730s Nanzhao had succeeded in bringing the Erhai Lake–area under its authority. In 738, the western Yunnan was united by Piluoge, the fourth king of Nanzhao, who was confirmed by the imperial court of the Tang dynasty as king of Yunnan. Ruling from Dali, the thirteen kings of Nanzhao ruled over more than two centuries and played a vital role in the dynamic relationship between the Tang dynasty and the Tibetan Empire as a buffer state.

By the 750s, Nanzhao had conquered Yunnan and became a potential rival to Tang China. The following period saw several conflicts between Tang China and Nanzhao. In 750, Nanzhao attacked and captured Yaozhou, the largest Tang settlement in Yunnan. In 751, Xianyu Zhongtong (), the regional commander of Jiannan (present-day Sichuan), led a Tang campaign against Nanzhao. The king of Nanzhao, Geluofeng, regarded the previous incident as a personal affair and wrote to Xianyu to seek peace. However, Xianyu Zhongtong detained the Nanzhao envoys and turned down the appeal. Confronted with Tang armies, Nanzhao immediately turned its allegiance to the Tibetan Empire. The Tubo and Nanzhao agreed to be &quot;fraternal states&quot;; Geluofeng was given the titles zanpuzhong (&quot;younger brother&quot;). The Nanzhao-Tubo alliance ensured a disastrous defeat for Xianyu&#x27;s expedition, with the Tang general&#x27;s army of 80,000 men being reduced to a quarter of its original size.

Tang China did not give up after one failure. In 753, another expedition was prepared, but this was also defeated by Nanzhao. In 754, the Tang organized an army of more than 100,000 troops that advanced to the Dali plain, resulting in only another slaughter. By the end of the eighth century, Tang was no longer a major threat to Nanzhao.

Nanzhao&#x27;s expansion lasted for several decades. In 829, Nanzhao suddenly plundered Sichuan and entered Chengdu. When it retreated, hundreds of Sichuan people, including skilled artisans, were taken to Yunnan. In 832, the Nanzhao army captured the capital of the Pyu kingdom in modern upper Burma. Nanzhao also attacked the Khmer peoples of Zhenla. Generally speaking, Nanzhao was then the most powerful kingdom in mainland Southeast Asia, and played an extremely active role in multistate interactions.
In 859, Nanzhao captured Bozhou, and this event exacerbated the Nanzhao-Tang clashes. When the Tang governor of Annam took Bozhou back in the following year, Nanzhao, with the help of native peoples, occupied Hanoi as the Tang army moved to Bozhou. When the Tang forces returned, Nanzhao troops retreated from Hanoi but attacked and plundered Yongzhou. In the winter of 862, Nanzhao, allying with local groups, led an army of over 50,000 men to invade Annam again. It is reported that the Tang forces lost over 150,000 soldiers (either killed or captured by
Nanzhao) in the two Annam battles. The autumn of 866 saw Tang victory in Hanoi and soon all of the Nanzhao forces were driven away. But Tang China had lost its ability to attack Nanzhao.

While Nanzhao was being defeated in Annam, it still occasionally attacked Sichuan. In 869, Shilong (), the eighth king and the first empire of Nanzhao, invaded Sichuan. In 874, Nanzhao attacked Sichuan again.

In 902, Zheng Maisi, the &quot;Qingpingguan&quot; (,&quot;Prime Minister&quot;) of Nanzhao, murdered the infant king of Nanzhao, and established a new kingdom called Dachanghe. Nanzhao, a once-powerful empire, disappeared. In 928, Yang Ganzhen (楊干貞) usurped the Dachanghe king and established Zhao Shanzheng, a &quot;qingpingguan&quot; as emperor of Datianxing (大天興). In 929, Yang Qianzhen abolished Zhao Shanzheng and established himself as Emperor of Dayining (大義寧).

=== Dali Kingdom ===
In 937, Duan Siping overthrew the Dayining Kingdom and established the Dali Kingdom. The kingdom was conquered by the Mongol Empire in 1253 after Dali King Duan Xingzhi defected to the Mongols. The Duans incorporated into the Mongol dominion as Maharajas of the new province. The Mongolian prince sent to administer the region with them was killed. In 1273, Kublai Khan reformed the province and appointed the semu Ajall Shams al-Din Omar as its governor. The Yunnan Province during the Yuan dynasty included significant portions of Upper Burma after the First Mongol invasion of Burma in the 1270s and 1280s. With the fall of the Yuan dynasty in 1368, the Ming dynasty destroyed the Yuan loyalists led by Basalawarmi and the remnants of the House of Duan in the Ming conquest of Yunnan by the early 1380s.

=== Ming and Qing dynasties ===
The Ming installed Mu Ying and his family as hereditary aristocrats in Yunnan.
During the Ming and Qing dynasties, large areas of Yunnan were administered under the native chieftain system. Under the Qing dynasty a war with Burma also occurred in the 1760s due to the attempted consolidation of borderlands under local chiefs by both China and Burma.

Yunnan was a destination for Han Chinese during Yuan rule. Migrants moved into the area during Ming and Qing rule. During the Ming dynasty, 3 million Han Chinese mostly from Nanjing (the original Nanjing population was later largely replaced by Wu-speakers), and some from Shanxi and Hebei, settled in Yunnan.

Although largely forgotten, the bloody Panthay Rebellion of the Muslim Hui people and other local minorities against the Manchu rulers of the Qing dynasty caused the deaths of up to a million people in Yunnan. The Manchu official Shuxing&#x27;a started an anti-Muslim massacre, which led to the rebellion. Shuxing&#x27;a developed a deep hatred of Muslims after an incident in which he was stripped naked and nearly lynched by a mob of Muslims. He ordered several Muslim rebels to be slowly sliced to death. Tariq Ali wrote about the real incident in one of his novels and claimed the Muslims who had nearly lynched Shuxing&#x27;a were not Hui but belonged to another ethnicity. Nevertheless, the Manchu official blamed all Muslims for the incident. A British officer testified that the Muslims did not rebel for religious reasons and that the Chinese were tolerant of different religions and were unlikely to have caused the revolt by interfering with the practice of Islam. Loyalist Muslim forces helped Qing forces crush the rebel Muslims. The Qing armies massacred only Muslims who had rebelled or supported the rebels and spared Muslims who took no part in the uprising.

In 1894, George Ernest Morrison, an Australian correspondent for &quot;The Times&quot;, traveled from Beijing to British-occupied Burma via Yunnan. His book, &quot;An Australian in China&quot;, details his experiences.
The 1905 Tibetan Rebellion in which Tibetan Buddhist Lamas attacked and killed French Catholic missionaries spread to Yunnan.

=== Post-Imperial ===
Yunnan was transformed by the events of the Second Sino-Japanese War, which caused many east coast refugees and industrial establishments to relocate to the province. It assumed strategic significance, particularly as the Burma Road from Lashio, in Burma to Kunming was a fought over supply line of vital importance to China&#x27;s war effort.

University faculty and students in the east had originally decamped to Changsha, capital of Hunan. But as Japanese forces were gaining more territory they eventually bombed Changsha in February 1938. The 800 faculty and students who were left had to flee and made the 1,000 mile journey to Kunming, capital of Yunnan in China&#x27;s mountainous southwest. It was here that the National Southwest Associated University (commonly known as Lianda University) was established. For eight years, staff, professors and students had to survive and operate in makeshift quarters that were subject to sporadic bombing campaigns by the Japanese. There were dire shortages of food, equipment, books, clothing and other essential needs, but they managed to conduct the running of a modern university. Over those eight years of war (1937–1945), Lianda became famous nationwide for having and producing many, if not most, of China&#x27;s most prominent academics, scholars, scientists and intellectuals. Both of China&#x27;s only Nobel laureates in physics Yang Chen-Ning &amp; Tsung-Dao Lee studied at Lianda in Kunming.

=== Naturalists ===

Thousands of plant, insect and mammal species were described in the 19th century by scientists of the French National Museum of Natural History, Paris, in connection with permanent settlements of missionaries of the in north-west Yunnan, among them noticeably Jean-André Soulié and Felix Biet. From 1916 to 1917, Roy Chapman Andrews and Yvette Borup Andrews led the Asiatic Zoological Expedition of the American Museum of Natural History through much of western and southern Yunnan, as well as other provinces of China. The book, &quot;Camps and Trails in China&quot;, records their experiences. Other notable explorers include Heinrich Handel-Mazzetti; George Forrest; Joseph Francis Charles Rock, who from 1922 to 1949 spent most of his time studying the flora, peoples and languages of southwest China, mainly in Yunnan; and Peter Goullart, a White Russian who studied Naxi culture and lived in Lijiang from 1940 to 1949.

== Geography ==

Yunnan is the most southwestern province in China, with the Tropic of Cancer running through its southern part. The province has an area of , 4.1% of the nation&#x27;s total. The northern part of the province forms part of the Yunnan–Guizhou Plateau. The province borders Guangxi and Guizhou in the east, Sichuan in the north, and the Tibet Autonomous Region in the northwest. It shares a border of with Myanmar (Kachin and Shan States) in the west, Laos (Luang Namtha, Oudomxay, and Phongsaly Provinces) in the south and Vietnam (Hà Giang, Lào Cai, Lai Châu, and Điện Biên Provinces) in the southeast.
For practical purposes, all of Yunnan province falls within the Zomia region of Asia.

=== Geology ===

Yunnan is at the far eastern edge of the Himalayan uplift, and was pushed up in the Pleistocene, primarily in the Middle Pleistocene, although the uplift continues into the present. The eastern part of the province is a limestone plateau with karst topography and unnavigable rivers flowing through deep mountain gorges. The main surface formations of the plateau are the Lower Permian Maokou Formation, characterized by thick limestone deposits, the Lower Permian Qixia Formation, characterised by dolomitic limestones and dolomites, the Upper Permian basalts of the Ermeishan Formation (formerly Omeishan plateau basalts), and the red sandstones, mudstones, siltstones, and conglomerates of the Mesozoic–Paleogene, including the Lufeng Formation and the Lunan Group (Lumeiyi, Xiaotun, and Caijiacong formations). In this area is the noted Stone Forest or Shilin, eroded vertical pinnacles of limestone (Maokou Formation). In the eastern part the rivers generally run eastwards. The western half is characterized by mountain ranges and rivers running north and south.

=== Paleontology ===

*Yunnanozoon – Lower Cambrian possible chordate
*Jingshanosaurus – Early Jurassic long-neck prosauropod dinosaur

=== Climate ===

Yunnan has a generally mild climate with pleasant and fair weather because of the province&#x27;s location on south-facing mountain slopes, receiving the influence of both the Pacific and Indian oceans, and although the growing period is long, the rugged terrain provides little arable land. See &quot;Agriculture in Yunnan&quot;. Under the Köppen climate classification, much of the province lies within the subtropical highland (Köppen &quot;Cwb&quot;) or humid subtropical zone (&quot;Cwa&quot;), with cool to warm winters, and temperate summers, except in the truly tropical south, where temperatures regularly exceed in the warmer half of the year. &quot;In general&quot;, January average temperatures range from ; July averages vary from . Average annual rainfall ranges from , with over half the rain occurring between June and August. The plateau region has moderate temperatures. The western canyon region is hot at the valley bottoms, but there are freezing winds at the mountaintops.

===Topography===

The terrain is largely mountainous, especially in the north and west. A series of high mountain chains spreads across the province. There is a distinct canyon region to the west and a plateau region to the east. Yunnan&#x27;s major rivers flow through the deep valleys between the mountains.

The average elevation is . The mountains are highest in the north where they reach more than ; in the south they rise no higher than . The highest point in the north is the Kawagebo Peak in Deqin County on the Diqing Plateau, which is about ; and the lowest is in the Red River Valley in Hekou County, near the Vietnamese border, with an elevation of .

The eastern half of the province is a limestone plateau with karst scenery and unnavigable rivers flowing through deep mountain gorges; the western half is characterised by mountain ranges and rivers running north and south. These include the Nu Jiang (Salween), the Lancang (Mekong), and the Jinsha (Yangtze), which flow in close proximity in the Three Parallel Rivers protected area. The rugged, vertical terrain produces a wide range of flora and fauna, and the province has been called a natural zoological and botanical garden.

=== Borders ===
Bordering Chinese provincial-level divisions are Tibet, Sichuan, Guizhou and Guangxi. Starting from the east and working clockwise, bordering countries are Vietnam (Hà Giang, Lào Cai, Lai Châu and Điện Biên provinces), Laos (Phongsaly, Oudomxay and Luang Namtha provinces), Myanmar (states of Shan and Kachin). The main border crossings are:

*Hekou–Lào Cai, by road and rail, is the only Sino-Vietnamese land border crossing open to non-Chinese/non-Vietnamese.
*Sino-Laotian at Boten
*Ruili–Muse is the only Sino-Burmese border crossing open to non-Chinese/non-Burmese.

=== Lakes ===

There are several major lakes in Yunnan. The province has nine lakes with areas of over . They include:
*Dianchi Lake, near Kunming
*Fuxian Lake, in Yuxi, the second deepest lake in China
*Xingyun Lake, directly south of Fuxian Lake and connected with it by a short river
*Qilu Lake, south of Fuxian and Xingyun Lakes, separated from them by mountains, in Tonghai County
*Erhai Lake, near Dali City
*Lugu Lake, in Ninglang near the border with Sichuan
*Yangzong Lake, in Yiliang County
*Yilong Lake
=== Rivers ===
Yunnan is the source of two rivers, the Xi River (there known as the Nanpan and Hongshui) and the Yuan River. The Hongshui is a principal source stream of the Xi River. Rising as the Nanpan in eastern Yunnan province, it flows south and east to form part of the boundary between Guizhou province and Guangxi autonomous region. Flowing for , it unites with the Yu River at Guiping to form what eventually becomes the Xi River.

The province is drained by six major river systems:
*the Yangtze River, here known as the Jinsha Jiang (River of Golden Sands), drains the province&#x27;s north.
*the Pearl River, with its source near Qujing, collects the waters from the east.
*the Mekong (Lancang), which flows from Tibet into the South China Sea forming the boundaries between Laos and Burma, between Laos and Thailand and through Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam
*the Red River (Yuan or Honghe) has its source in the mountains south of Dali and enters the South China Sea through Hanoi, Vietnam
*the Salween (Nujiang), which flows into the Gulf of Martaban and the Andaman Sea through Burma
*the Irrawaddy, which arises from the confluence of two rivers in Kachin State in Burma, has a few small tributaries in Yunnan&#x27;s far west, such as the Dulongjiang and Taping River, and rivers in the prefecture of Dehong.

=== Biodiversity ===
Yunnan is China&#x27;s most diverse province, biologically as well as culturally. The province contains snow-capped mountains and true tropical environments, thus supporting an unusually full spectrum of species and vegetation types. The Yunnan camellia (&quot;Camellia reticulata&quot;) is the provincial emblem.

During summer, the Great Plateau of Tibet acts as a barrier to monsoon winds, trapping moisture in the province. This gives the alpine flora in particular what one source has called a &quot;lushness found nowhere else&quot;.

This topographic range combined with a tropical moisture sustains extremely high biodiversity and high degrees of endemism, probably the richest botanically in the world&#x27;s temperate regions. Perhaps 17,000 species of higher plants, of which an estimated 2,500 are endemic, can be found in the province. The province is said to have &quot;as much flowering plant diversity as the rest of the Northern Hemisphere put together&quot;.

Yunnan has less than 4% of the land of China, yet the province harbors around 42.6% of all protected plant species and 72.5% of all protected wild animals in the country, of which 15% are strictly endemic to Yunnan. Yunnan is home to, most notably, the southeast Asian gaur, a giant forest-dwelling bovine, the Indochinese tiger and the Asian elephant. Other extremely rare species are the Yunnan box turtle and the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey. It is feared that the Yunnan lar gibbon, another moribund species, has already gone extinct. Yunnan province has 11 national and regional nature reserves. In total, the covered protected area in China is about 510,000 hectares.

The freshwater fish fauna is highly diverse with about 620 species, including more than 580 natives (the remaining are introduced). This equals almost 40% of the freshwater fish species in China. Of the Yunnan natives, more than 250 are endemic to the province and many of these are threatened. Several species that are restricted to single lakes (notably Dian, Erhai, Fuxian and Yilong) are likely already are extinct. By far, the most diverse order in Yunnan are Cypriniformes, both in total species number and number of endemics.

The unique &quot;Sinopyrophorus&quot; bioluminescent beetles were described from Yunnan in 2019.

=== Designation ===
Yunnan has been designated:
*&quot;Center of Plant Diversity&quot; (IUCN/WWF: Davis et al. 1995)
*&quot;Global 200 List Priority Ecoregion&quot; for biodiversity conservation (WWF: Olsen and Dinerstein 1998)
*&quot;Endemic Bird Area&quot; (Birdlife International: Bibby, C. et al. 1992) and
*&quot;Global Biodiversity Hotspot&quot;, as a part of the Hengduan Mountain Ecosystem (Conservation International: Mittermeier and Mittermeier 1997)

=== Natural resources ===
A main source of wealth lies in its vast mineral resources; indeed, mining is the leading industry in Yunnan. Yunnan has proven deposits of 86 kinds of minerals in 2,700 places. Some 13% of the proved deposits of minerals are the largest of their kind in China, and two-thirds of the deposits are among the largest of their kind in the Yangtze River valley and in south China. Yunnan ranks first in the country in deposits of zinc, lead, tin, cadmium, indium, thallium and crocidolite. Other deposits include iron, coal, copper, gold, mercury, silver, antimony and sulfur. More than 150 kinds of minerals have been discovered in the province. The potential value of the proven deposits in Yunnan is 3 trillion yuan, 40% of which come from fuel minerals, 7.3% from metallic minerals and 52.7% from nonmetallic minerals.

Yunnan has sufficient rainfall and many rivers and lakes. The annual water flow originating in the province is 200 cubic kilometres, three times that of the Yellow River. The rivers flowing into the province from outside add 160 cubic kilometres, which means there are more than ten thousand cubic metres of water for each person in the province. This is four times the average in the country. The rich water resources offer abundant hydro-energy. China is constructing a series of dams on the Mekong to develop it as a waterway and source of power; the first was completed at Manwan in 1993.

== Governance ==

=== Administrative divisions ===

Yunnan consists of sixteen prefecture-level divisions: eight prefecture-level cities and eight autonomous prefectures:

These 16 prefecture-level divisions are in turn subdivided into 129 county-level divisions (17 districts, 18 county-level cities, 65 counties, and 29 autonomous counties). At the end of the year 2021, the total population is 48.01 million.

=== Politics ===
The Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is the province&#x27;s top authority. The secretary of the CCP Yunnan Committee is the highest ranking and most important position in Yunnan. The Governor is the second highest office in Yunnan, after the Secretary of the CCP Yunnan Committee. The Governor, who is elected by the Yunnan Provincial People&#x27;s Congress, is responsible for all economic, environmental, political, personnel and foreign affairs issues concerning Yunnan.

== Demographics ==

According to Yunnan government statistics, there are approximately 2.5 million overseas Chinese whose ancestral homeland is Yunnan province.

=== Ethnicity ===

Yunnan is noted for a very high level of ethnic diversity. It has the highest number of ethnic groups among the provinces and autonomous regions in China. Among the country&#x27;s 56 recognised ethnic groups, twenty-five are found in Yunnan. Some 38% of the province population are members of ethnic minorities, including the Yi, Bai, Hani, Tai, Dai, Miao, Lisu, Hui, Lahu, Wa, Nakhi, Yao, Tibetans, Jingpo, Blang, Pumi, Nu, Achang, Jinuo, Mongols, Derung, Manchus, Sui, and Buyei. Several other groups are represented, but they live neither in compact settlements nor do they reach the required threshold of five thousand to be awarded the official status of being present in the province. Some groups, such as the Mosuo, who are officially recognised as part of the Naxi, have in the past claimed official status as a national minority, and are now recognised with the status of Mosuo people.

Ethnic groups are widely distributed in the province. Some twenty-five minorities live in compact communities, each of which has a population of more than five thousand. Ten ethnic minorities living in border areas and river valleys include the Hui, Manchus, Bai, Naxi, Mongols, Zhuang, Dai, Achang, Buyei and Shui, with a combined population of 4.5 million; those in low mountainous areas are the Hani, Yao, Lahu, Va, Jingpo, Blang and Jino, with a combined population of 5 million; and those in high mountainous areas are Miao, Lisu, Tibetan, Pumi and Drung, with a total population of four million.

=== Languages ===

Most dialects of the Chinese language spoken in Yunnan belong to the southwestern subdivision of the Mandarin group, and are therefore very similar to the dialects of neighboring Sichuan and Guizhou provinces. Notable features found in many Yunnan dialects include the partial or complete loss of distinction between finals and , as well as the lack of . In addition to the local dialects, most people also speak Standard Chinese (&quot;Putonghua&quot;, commonly called &quot;Mandarin&quot;), which is used in the media, by the government, and as the language of instruction in education.

Yunnan&#x27;s ethnic diversity is reflected in its linguistic diversity. Languages spoken in Yunnan include Tibeto-Burman languages such as Bai, Yi, Tibetan, Hani, Jingpo, Lisu, Lahu, Naxi; Tai languages like Zhuang, Bouyei, Dong, Shui, Tai Lü and Tai Nüa; as well as Hmong–Mien languages.

The Naxi, in particular, use the Dongba script, which is the only pictographic writing system in use in the world today. The Dongba script was mainly used to provide the Dongba priests with instructions on how to carry out their rituals: today the Dongba script features more as a tourist attraction. Perhaps the best known Western Dongba scholar was Joseph Rock.

=== Literacy ===
By the end of 1998, among the province&#x27;s population, 419,800 had received college education or above, 2.11 million senior middle school education, 8.3 million junior middle school education, 18.25 million primary school education, and 8.25 million aged 15 or above were illiterate or semi-literate.

=== Religion ===

According to a demographic analysis of religious people in Yunnan, almost 90% of followers of government-sanctioned organised religions belonged to ethnic minorities. As of 2005 the province had around 4 million believers of the five government-sanctioned organised religious doctrines of China. Of these:
*2.6 million or about 6% of the total population are Buddhists;
*620,000 or 1.4% are Muslims;
*530,000 or 1.2% are Protestants;
*240,000 or 0.5% are Taoists (&quot;Taoist&quot; traditionally only includes priests);
*66,000 or 0.1% are Catholics.

According to surveys conducted in 2004 and 2007, in those years approximately 32.22% of the province&#x27;s population was involved in worship of ancestors and 2.75% declared a Christian identity.

Most of the population of the province practices traditional indigenous religions including the Chinese folk religion among the Han Chinese, Bimoism among the Yi peoples and Benzhuism among the Bai people. The Dai people are one of the few ethnic minorities of China that traditionally follow the Theravada branch of Buddhism, making Yunnan the only province in China where all three major Buddhist schools are widely practiced. Most of the Hui people of the region are Muslims. Christianity is dominant among the Lisu, the Jingpo and the Derung ethnic groups.

==Agriculture==
The region maintains a strong agricultural focus. Agriculture is restricted to the few upland plains, open valleys, and terraced hillsides. Level land for agriculture is extremely scarce and only about 5 percent of the province is under cultivation. Rice is the main crop; corn, barley, wheat, rapeseed, sweet potatoes, soybeans (as a food crop), tea, sugarcane, tobacco, and cotton are also grown. On the steep slopes in the west livestock is raised and timber, a valuable resource, is cut (teak in the southwest).

Yunnan produces most of coffee grown in China (although there are also much smaller plantations in Fujian and Hainan). Large-scale coffee cultivation started in Yunnan in 1988. The most commonly grown variety in the province is catimor.

Yunnan province is famous for its quality teas. Most notably Yunnan tea. Yunnan black tea, also known as ‘Dianhong’ (‘Dian’ is the short name for Yunnan province, ‘hong’ meaning red after the deep, red liquor of the brewed tea) is a fully oxidised tea grown high in the mountainous regions between approximately 1000 metres to 2000 metres above sea level. Its unique earthy flavour makes it a highly sought after tea.

Tobacco is the main (export) product and makes up a big part of the provincial GDP. Furthermore, Yunnan has a strong competitive potential in the fruit and vegetable industries, especially in low value-added commodities such as fresh and dried vegetables and fresh apples.
Yunnan is one of the regions in the world with the most abundant resources of wild edible mushrooms. In China, there are 938 kinds of edible mushrooms, and over 800 varieties can be found in Yunnan. In 2004, around 7,744 tons of wild edible mushrooms were exported, making up for 70% of the total export of this product in China. The so-called &#x27;pine mushroom&#x27; is the main product in Yunnan and is exported to Japan in large quantities.

Due to China&#x27;s growing consumption of dairy products, Yunnan&#x27;s dairy industry is also developing very rapidly and is also aiming to export to its ASEAN neighbors.

The flower industry in Yunnan province started to develop towards the end of the 1980s. Yunnan province accounts for 50% of China&#x27;s total cut flower production. The size of the planting area for cut flowers in Yunnan province amounts to 4000 hectares. In 2003, the output totaled 2.3 billion stems. In 2002 the flower industry in Yunnan had a total output of RMB 3.4 billion. Export amounted to US$18 million. Apart from sales on the domestic market, Yunnan also exports to a number of foreign countries and regions such as Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Thailand and Singapore. 

== Economy ==
As of the mid-19th century, Yunnan exported birds, brass, tin, gemstones, musk, nuts, and peacock feathers mainly to stores in Guangzhou. They imported silk, wool, and cotton cloth, tobacco and books.

It was a major recipient of China&#x27;s investment in industrial capacity during the Third Front campaign.

Yunnan is one of China&#x27;s relatively undeveloped provinces with more poverty-stricken counties than the other provinces. In 1994, about 7 million people lived below the poverty line of less than an annual average income of 300 yuan per capita. They were distributed in the province&#x27;s 73 counties mainly and financially supported by the central government. With an input of 3.15 billion yuan in 2002, the absolutely poor rural population in the province has been reduced from 4.05 million in 2000 to 2.86 million. The poverty alleviation plan includes five large projects aimed at improving infrastructure facilities. They involve planned attempts at soil improvement, water conservation, electric power, roads, and &quot;green belt&quot; building. Upon the completion of the projects, the province hopes this will alleviate the shortages of grain, water, electric power and roads.

Yunnan lags behind the east coast of China in relation to socio-economic development. However, because of its geographic location the province has comparative advantages in regional and border trade with Southeast Asian countries. The Lancang River (upper reaches of Mekong River) is the waterway to southeast Asia. In recent years land transportation has been improved to strengthen economic and trade co-operation among countries in the Greater Mekong Subregion. Yunnan&#x27;s abundance in resources determines that the province&#x27;s pillar industries are: agriculture, tobacco, mining, hydro-electric power, and tourism. In general, the province still depends on the natural resources. The secondary sector is currently the largest industrial tier in Yunnan, contributing more than 45 percent of GDP. The tertiary sector contributes 40 percent and agriculture 15 percent. Investment is the key driver of Yunnan&#x27;s economic growth, especially in construction.

The main challenge that Yunnan faces is its lack of major development. Its low productivity and competitiveness restrict the rapid development of the province. The province also faces great challenges in social issues such as environmental protection, poverty elimination, illegal migration, drug trafficking and HIV/AIDS.

Yunnan&#x27;s four pillar industries include tobacco, agriculture/biology, mining, and tourism. The main manufacturing industries are iron and steel production and copper-smelting, commercial vehicles, chemicals, fertilizers, textiles, and optical instruments. Yunnan has trade contacts with more than seventy countries and regions in the world. Yunnan established the Muse border trade zone (located in Ruili) along its border with Burma. Yunnan mainly exports tobacco, machinery and electrical equipment, chemical and agricultural products, and non-ferrous metals. In 2008, its total two-way trade (imports and exports) reached US$9.6 billion. The province signed foreign direct investment contracts involving US$1.69 billion, of which US$777 million were actually utilized during the year.

Yunnan&#x27;s employment rate remain stable. The total number of newly entered-employee were 49.35 thousand people. The unemployment rate at the end of 2020 was 3.92%. Yunnan&#x27;s nominal GDP in 2020 was 24521.9 billion Yuan( US$3850.92 billion), an annual growth rate of 4.0%. Its per capita GDP was 50,299 Yuan ( US$7,898.96). The share of GDP of Yunnan&#x27;s primary, secondary and tertiary industries were 3598.91 billion Yuan, 8287.54 billion Yuan, and 12635.45 billion Yuan respectively.

Yunnan is one of the major production bases of copper, lead, zinc, tin and aluminum in China. Gejiu is well known as &quot;the Kingdom of Zinc&quot; with the reserves ranked first in the country. The Yunxi brand refined tin is one of the main products in Gejiu, which is registered on the London Metal Exchange (LME). Besides, reserves of germanium, indium, zirconium, platinum, rock salt, sylvite, nickel, phosphate, mirabilite, arsenic and blue asbestos are also high. Significant copper deposits are found at Dongchuan, iron ore at Wuding, and coal at Xuanwei and Kaiyuan. Economic policy to locate new industry in interior areas with substantial mineral wealth, led to major industrial development in Yunnan, especially in the Kunming area.

The electricity industry is another important economic pillar of Yunnan, which plays a key role in the &quot;West-East Electricity Transmission Project&quot;. The electricity produced in Yunnan is mainly transported to Guangdong.

== Education ==

Since the 1960s, improvements have been achieved in the overall educational level, which can be seen in the increase in average years of regular education received. The development of part-time schools have brought adult, distance and continuing education to farms, factories, offices, and other places. Evening, time off work / study leave classes allow people to receive education without leaving their jobs. Policies to upgrade adult education have begun to complement the campaign against illiteracy. A basic Chinese vocabulary in simplified strokes is taught to millions of illiterate people in short, intensive courses. Despite progress made, Yunnan&#x27;s illiteracy rate remains one of the highest in China mainly due to insufficient education among minority peoples.

In higher education, Yunnan has one &quot;National Key University&quot;—Yunnan University in Kunming. There is also a growing number of technical schools, among which the most prominent are the Yunnan Normal University, the Southwest Forestry University, Yunnan Agricultural University, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences , Kunming Medical University, Yunnan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Kunming University of Science and Technology. Other notable establishments of learning are the , the Yunnan Astronomical Observatory, and the Yunnan Provincial Library. As of 2000, there were 24 institutions of higher learning in Yunnan, with an enrollment of over 90,400 students and a faculty of 9,237; 2,562 secondary schools with an enrollment of more than 2,137,400 students and 120,461 teachers; and 22,151 primary schools with an enrollment of 4,720,600 pupils and a faculty of 210,507. The gross enrollment rate of school-age children was 99.02%.

== Health ==

Yunnan Province is responsible for about 50% of officially reported malaria cases in China.

It is presently considered to be the main source of plague in China.

=== HIV-AIDS ===
== Transport ==
=== Railways ===

The first railway in Yunnan was the narrow gauge Yunnan–Vietnam Railway built by France from 1904 to 1910 to connect Kunming with Vietnam, then a French colony. In Yunnan, the Chinese section of this railway is known as the Yunnan-Hekou Railway and the line gave Yunnan access to the seaport at Haiphong. During the Second World War, Britain and the United States began building a railway from Yunnan to Burma but abandoned the effort due to Japanese advance.

Due in part to difficult terrain both locally and in surrounding provinces and the shortage of capital for rail construction, Yunnan remained outside of China&#x27;s domestic rail network until 1966 when the Guiyang–Kunming Railway was completed. The line would not enter into operation until 1970, the same year that the Chengdu-Kunming was completed. The Nanning–Kunming Railway to Guangxi was completed in 1997, followed by the Neijiang–Kunming Railway in 2001. The Panxi Railway, originally built in 1975 to draw coal from neighboring Guizhou, was electrified in 2001 and adds to eastern Yunnan&#x27;s outbound rail transport capacity.
Within the province, the Kunming–Yuxi, opened in 1993, and the Guangtong–Dali, opened in 1998, expanded the rail network to southern and western Yunnan, respectively. The Dali–Lijiang Railway, opened in 2010, brought rail service to northwestern Yunnan. That line is planned to be extended further north to Xamgyi&#x27;nyilha County.

The province is extending the railway network to neighboring countries in Southeast Asia. From Yuxi, the Yuxi–Mengzi Railway, built from 2005 to 2013, and the Mengzi–Hekou Railway, under construction since 2008, will form a standard gauge railway connection with Vietnam. The Dali–Ruili Railway, under construction since May 2011, will bring rail service to the border with Myanmar. Also under planning is a rail line from Yuxi to Mohan, in Xishuangbana Prefecture, on the border with Laos. This line could be extended further south to Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore.

===Burma Road===
The Burma Road was a highway extending about through mountainous terrain from Lashio, northeast Burma northeastward to Kunming, China. Undertaken by the Chinese after the start of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937 and completed in 1938, it was a vital transportation route for wartime supplies to the Chinese government from Rangoon and shipped by railroad to Lashio from 1938 to 1946. An extension runs east through China from Kunming, then north to Chongqing. This traffic increased in importance to China after the Japanese took effective control of the Chinese coast and of Indochina. It was seized by the Japanese in 1942 and reopened when it was connected to the Stilwell Road from India. The Ledo Road (later called the Stilwell Road) from Ledo, India, into Burma was begun in December 1942. In 1944 the Ledo Road reached Myitkyina and was joined to the Burma Road. Both roads have lost their former importance and are in a state of disrepair. The Burma Road&#x27;s importance diminished after World War II, but it has remained a link in a 3,400-km road system from Yangon, Burma, to Chongqing.

=== Highways ===
Road construction in Yunnan continues unabated: over the last years the province has added more new roads than any other province. Today expressways link Kunming through Dali to Baoshan, Kunming to Mojiang (on the way to Jinghong), Kunming to Qujing, Kunming to Shilin (Stone Forest). The official plan is to connect all major towns and neighbouring capitals with expressways by 2010, and to complete a high-speed road network by 2020.

All county towns are now accessible by paved, all-weather roads from Kunming, all townships have a road connection (the last to be connected was Yangla, in the far north, but Dulongjiang remains cut off for about six months every year), and about half of all villages have road access.

Second-level national highways stretch , third-level highways, and fourth-level highways, . The province has formed a network of communication lines radiating from Kunming to Sichuan and Guizhou provinces and Guangxi and Tibet autonomous regions, and further on to Burma, Laos, Vietnam and Thailand.
National highways running through Yunnan province are:
*China National Highway 108
*China National Highway 213
*China National Highway 214
*China National Highway 320
*China National Highway 323
*China National Highway 324
*China National Highway 326

==== Expressways ====
After the opening of the Suolongsi to Pingyuanjie section, Luofu expressway, the first between Yunnan and Guangxi Province, opened in October 2007. It has made material and passenger transportation between the two provinces much more convenient. Moreover, Luofu Expressway has also become the main road from Yunnan to Guangxi and the coastal ports. Luofu Expressway begins from the crossroads of Luo Village between Yunnan and Guangxi Provinces and ends at Funing County of Wenshan State. The total length of the expressway is 79.3 kilometers which has shortened the commute between Yunnan and Guangxi from the previous 3 and half hours to just 50 minutes.

Expressways running through Yunnan province are:
*Kunming–Bangkok Expressway (G8511 Kunmo Expressway)
*G5611 Dali Expressway from Dali to Lijiang
*G78 Shankun Expressway from Shantou to Kunming
*G80 Guangkun Expressway from Guangzhou to Kunming
*G8011 Kaihe Expressway from Kaiyuan to Hekou on the Vietnamese border

=== Waterways ===

Generally, rivers are obstacles to transport in Yunnan. Only very small parts of Yunnan&#x27;s river systems are navigable. However, China is constructing a series of dams on the Mekong to develop it as a waterway and source of power; the first was completed at Manwan in 1993.

In 1995, the province put an investment of 171 million yuan to add another of navigation lines. It built two wharfs with an annual handling capacity of 300,000 to 400,000 tons each and four wharfs with an annual handling capacity of 100,000 tons each. The annual volume of goods transported was two million tons and that of passengers transported, two million.

=== Airports ===
The province has twenty domestic air routes from Kunming to Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Haikou, Chongqing, Shenyang, Harbin, Wuhan, Xi&#x27;an, Lanzhou, Hangzhou, Xiamen, Nanning, Shenzhen, Guiyang, Changsha, Guilin, Lhasa and Hong Kong; eleven provincial air routes from Kunming to Jinghong, Mangshi, Lincang, Tengchong, Lijiang, Dali, Xamgyi&#x27;nyilha, Zhaotong, Baoshan, Simao, and Ninglang Luguhu; and ten international air routes from Kunming to Bangkok, Kolkata, Chiang Mai, Yangon, Singapore, Seoul, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Kuala Lumpur and Vientiane.

Replacing Kunming Wujiaba International Airport is Kunming Changshui International Airport, which opened June 28, 2012.

===Bridges===
Bridge-building in Yunnan date back at least 1,300 years when the Tibetan Empire built an iron chain bridge over the Yangtze to the neighboring Nanzhao Kingdom at what is today Weixi Lisu Autonomous County during the Tang dynasty. Iron chain bridges are still found across high river valleys of Yunnan. The Jinlong Bridge on the Jinsha River in Lijiang remains the oldest bridge over the Yangtze. With the expansion of the highway and railway network in Yunnan, numerous large-scale bridges have been built across the region&#x27;s myriad of rivers, including the Yangtze which has dozens of crossings in Yunnan.

===Metro===
Kunming is the only city in Yunnan that has a metro system. As of August 2021, it has 5 lines in operation.

== Culture ==

Yunnan&#x27;s cultural life is one of remarkable diversity. Archaeological findings have unearthed sacred burial structures holding elegant bronzes in Jinning, south of Kunming. In northeastern Yunnan, frescoes of the Jin dynasty (266–420) have been discovered in the city of Zhatong. Many Chinese cultural relics have been discovered in later periods. The lineage of tribal way of life of the indigenous peoples persisted uninfluenced by modernity until the mid-20th century. Tribal traditions, such as Yi slaveholding and Wa headhunting, have since been abolished. After the Cultural Revolution (1966–76), in which several minority cultural and religious practices were suppressed, Yunnan has come to celebrate its cultural diversity and subsequently many local customs and festivals have flourished.

=== Eighteen Oddities of Yunnan ===
=== Cuisine ===
=== Tea ===
Yunnan has several different tea growing regions. One of Yunnan&#x27;s best known products is Pu-erh tea (or Puer), named after the old tea trading town of Pu-erh (Puer). The province is also known for its Yunnan Gold and other Dianhong teas, developed in the 20th century.

=== Music ===
=== Chinese medicine ===
Yunnan is host to more than 19,000 species of plants, including 60 percent of the plants used in traditional Chinese medicine.

=== Tourism ===


Yunnan Province, due to its landscapes, mild climate and cultural diversity, is one of China&#x27;s major tourist destinations. Most visitors are Chinese tourists, although trips to Yunnan are organized by an increasing number of foreign travel agencies as well. Mainland tourists travel by the masses; 2.75 million Chinese visited Yunnan last October during National Holiday. Also a different trend is slowly developing; small scale and environmentally friendly ecotourism. At the moment projects in this field are often being set up with help of NGO&#x27;s.

In 2004, tourism revenues amounted to 37 billion RMB, and thus accounting for 12.6% of the provincial GDP. Another fact indicating the importance of tourism in Yunnan Province is capital Kunming hosting the China International Travel Mart every two years. This tourism trade fair is the largest of its kind in Asia and serves as an important platform for professionals in the sector. More than 80 countries and regions were present during the 2005 edition.

Tourism is expected to grow further. In 2010, the province welcomed over 2.3 million overseas tourists and the Yunnan Provincial Tourism Bureau aims to draw 4.3 million overseas arrivals under the 12th Five-Year Tourism Development Plan. Kunming city is expected to add 11 new mid- to high-end hotels with an inventory of under 4,000 rooms between 2012 and 2016.

The Nature Conservancy and the Chinese government came together to form a partnership and explore the possibility of bringing adventure tourism onto the rivers of Southwest China. A two-month white-water expedition explored from the Mekong River&#x27;s Moon Gorge to Yangze River&#x27;s Great Bend. The expedition provided valuable information to the partnership, encouraging them to take into account the safety, culture, economics, and conservation of the Yunnan Province. Creating an adventure tourism sector would bring valuable economic resources to the economically struggling population, who had once relied on logging as income prior to it being banned due to deforestation.

Tourist centres in Yunnan include:
*Dali, the historic center of the Nanzhao and Dali kingdoms.
*Chuxiong, the first stop on the way to Dali and Lijiang. Home of the Yi ethnic minority and their respective ancient town.
*Jinghong, the center and prefectural capital of the Xishuangbanna Dai minority autonomous prefecture.
*Lijiang, a Naxi minority city. It has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1997.
*Xamgyi&#x27;nyilha County (also known as Shangri-La and formerly Zhongdian), an ethnic Tibetan township and county set high in Yunnan&#x27;s northwestern mountains.
*Shilin (Stone Forest), a series of karst outcrops east of Kunming.
*Yuanyang, a Hani minority settlement with vast rice-terraced mountains.
*Xishuangbanna, a national scenic resort, noted for its natural and cultural attractions.

<text>Hainan is an island province and the southernmost province of China. It consists of the eponymous Hainan Island and various smaller islands in the South China Sea under the province&#x27;s administration. The name literally means &quot;South of the Sea&quot;.

The province has a land area of , of which Hainan Island is and the rest is over 200 islands scattered across three archipelagos: Zhongsha, Xisha and Nansha. It was part of Guangdong from 1950 to 1988, after which it was made a province of its own and was designated as a special economic zone by Deng Xiaoping, as part of the Chinese economic reform program.

The Han Chinese population, who compose a majority of the population at 82%, speak a wide variety of languages including Standard Chinese, Hainam Min, Yue Chinese, Cantonese, Hakka Chinese, etc. Indigenous peoples such as the Hlai, a Kra–Dai-speaking ethnic group, are native to the island and compose 15% of the population. Their native languages include the Hlai languages. The Hlai are recognized by the Chinese government as one of the country&#x27;s 56 ethnic groups. Speakers of Be, despite speaking a Kra-Dai language, are reckoned officially as ethnically Han Chinese. Hainan is also home to the Jiamao language, of disputed provenance.

There are ten major cities and ten counties in Hainan Province. The capital of the province is Haikou, on the northern coast of Hainan Island, while Sanya is a well-known tourist destination on the southern coast. The other major cities are Wenchang, Sansha, Qionghai, Wanning, Wuzhishan, Dongfang and Danzhou.

According to China&#x27;s territorial claims, several disputed territories in the South China Sea, including the Spratly Islands (&quot;Nansha&quot;) and Paracel Islands (&quot;Xisha&quot;), are administered under Sansha city of the province. While the Paracels are fully under China&#x27;s control, many of the Spratly Islands are controlled by other countries, such as Vietnam and the Philippines.

In 2020, a large-scale plan was announced by the Chinese government to transform the entire island province into a free trade port, with the aim of turning it into the largest free-trade port in the world by 2035. The plan involves building a hub for offshore financing and duty-free shopping, as well as using lower taxes and reduced visa requirements to help draw in foreign businesses and tourists. Moreover, all goods sold from Hainan to other parts of China would be treated as imports from 2025 onward.

==Names==
The provincial name derives from its major island, Hainan, in Hainanese &quot;Hai Nam&quot;, which is named after its position south of the Qiongzhou Strait. (To the north of the strait, the Leizhou Peninsula in Guangdong is also known as &quot;Haibei/Hai Bac&quot; or &quot;North of the Sea&quot;.) Former names for Hainan Island include Zhuya, Qiongya, and Qiongzhou. The latter two gave rise to the provincial abbreviation (&quot;Qióng/Kheng&quot;).

During the 17th and 18th centuries, explorers referred to the island as &quot;Aynam&quot;, which remains the pronunciation of its name in the local Hainanese dialect.

==History==
===Prehistoric era===
According to some scholars, Hainan was originally attached to the Northeastern part of what is now Vietnam; however, the island was formed after it physically broke away from Vietnam due to a volcanic eruption and drifted southeast near China after the Mesozoic, millions of years ago.

The Baiyue people are among the earliest Kra-Dai residents to arrive on Hainan island. They are believed to have settled there at least two to six thousand years ago, and carry genetic markers from ancient people who reached the island between 7000–27,000 years ago.

===Imperial Era===

Hainan Island was recorded by Chinese officials in 110 BC, when the Western Han dynasty established a military garrison there following the arrival of General Lu Bode. The process of sinicization in Hainan was driven by the conjunction of Han territorial expansion and the arrival of Han Chinese military and administrative personnel who settled on the island. Over the course of many centuries, dynastic Chinese ruling authorities exiled individuals condemned by the imperial courts as criminals or political dissidents were frequently banished to Hainan island and northern Vietnam, regions that were both integral parts governed typically under the jurisdiction of Guangdong province during different Chinese dynasties, where they were subjected to harsh labor in the tropical climate as a form of punishment.

One of the most famous exiled individuals was Su Shi, a well-known intellectual, poet, and politician of the Song era, who offended many of his colleagues and superiors in the royal court. Shi wrote extensively about his exiled experiences on the island during the 11th century AD. After the 11th century AD, large numbers of Han Chinese people from Fujian and Guangdong began migrating to the Leizhou peninsula and Hainan island to settle down their roots by seeking greener pastures on new land to establish themselves. This influx displaced the indigenous Li people, who were among the Baiyue tribes in southern China, driving them out towards the mountainous regions of the southern portion of the island. Hainan was placed under the administration of Guangdong by the ruling Ming dynasty.

===Republic of China===
Hainan was historically part of Guangdong and Guangxi Provinces and as such was the Qiongya Circuit () under the 1912 establishment of the Republic of China. In 1921, it was planned to become a special administrative region (); in 1944, it became Hainan Special Administrative Region with 16 counties, including the South China Sea Islands.

During the 1920s and 30s, Hainan was a hotbed of banditry, many opposition politicians were hanged, therefore opposition politicians went into hiding. The Communists and the indigenous Hlai people fought a vigorous guerrilla campaign against the Japanese, who were only able to occupy some Hainan territories; but in retaliation the Japanese launched numerous massacres against Hlai villages. Feng Baiju led the Hainan Independent Column of fighters throughout the 1930s and 1940s. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, the Kuomintang reestablished control. Hainan was one of the last areas to eventually come under the administration of the People&#x27;s Republic, having been under the control of ROC forces until March 1950. The People&#x27;s Republic attacked Hainan on 10 April 1950 and attained complete control on 1 May. However, Pratas Island remained under Hainan until the ROC government transferred the administration of Pratas to Kaohsiung Municipality on 13 April 1996.

===People&#x27;s Republic of China===

On 1 May 1950, under the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the Hainan Special Administrative Region became an Administrative Region Office (), a branch of the Guangdong provincial government. During the mid-1980s, when Hainan Island was still part of Guangdong Province, a fourteen-month episode of marketing zeal by Hainan Special District Administrator Lei Yu put Hainan&#x27;s pursuit of provincial status under a cloud. It involved the duty-free imports from Hong Kong of 90,000 Japanese-made cars and trucks at a cost of ¥ 4.5 billion (US$1.5 billion), and exporting them – with the help of local naval units – to the mainland, making 150% profits. By comparison, only 10,000 vehicles were imported into Hainan since 1950. In addition, it involved further consignments of 2.9 million TV sets, 252,000 videocassette recorders &amp; 122,000 motorcycles. The money was taken from the 1983 central government funds destined for the construction of the island&#x27;s transportation infrastructure (roads, railways, airports, harbors) over the next ten years.

On 1 October 1984, it became the Hainan Administrative Region (), with its own People&#x27;s Government, and finally as a province separate from Guangdong four years later. In 1988, when the island was made a separate province, it was designated a Special Economic Zone in an effort to increase investment.

The central government funds were deemed insufficient by the Hainan authorities for the construction of the island&#x27;s other infrastructure (e.g. water works, power stations, telecommunications) and had taken a very liberal interpretation of the economic and trade regulations for Hainan and thirteen coastal cities; the regulations did not mention on prohibiting the re-selling of second-hand goods. Some of the proceeds, from unsold units, were later retrieved by the central government to re-finance the special district.

In June 2020, China announced a master plan for Hainan&#x27;s free trade port system. Announced by state-owned media Xinhua News Agency, Hainan will &quot;basically establish a free trade port system by 2025 and become more mature by 2035.&quot; South China Morning Post described such an initiative as an effort of PRC to &quot;replace Hong Kong as the trading entrepôt&quot; while Cheng Shi of ICBC International has refused to accept such a claim. Additionally, experts have raised concerns about the question of compliance of global trading practices particularly for this project.

==Geography==
Hainan, separated by the wide Qiongzhou Strait from the Leizhou Peninsula of Guangdong, is the 42nd largest island in the world. The area of Hainan Island (, 97% of the province) is slightly smaller than that of Taiwan Island. To the west of Hainan Island is the Gulf of Tonkin. Wuzhi Mountain is the highest mountain on the island at .

Hainan Island measures long and wide.

The northern half of Hainan is covered with the ancient Hainan Volcanic Field. Beneath the topsoil is volcanic rock while the topsoil itself contains small pieces of this vesicular rock.

Wetland covers 320,000 hectares, 78,000 hectares of which were created artificially. Most of this is located in the eastern and northern part of Hainan.

===Rivers and lakes===
Most of the rivers in Hainan originate in the central area of the island and flow radially in different directions. The Nandu River in the northern part of the island is long, and its tributary, the Xinwu River, is long. Other major rivers include the Wanquan River at -long in the east, Changhua River in the west, and the Sanya and Taiyang Rivers in the south. Evaporation during the dry season around the coastal areas greatly reduces the flow of the rivers.

There are very few natural lakes in Hainan. However, there are numerous reservoirs, the largest of which is the Songtao Reservoir in the central-north area.

===Islands===
====Nearby islands====
Several small islands exist around the coast of Hainan Island:
*Dazhou Island is located about off the coast of Wanning
*Haidian Island, on the north coast, is part of Haikou City
*Nanwan Monkey Island, is actuality a peninsula
*Phoenix Island is an artificial resort island currently under construction in Sanya Bay.
*Wuzhizhou Island is located within Haitang Bay
*Xinbu Island is located directly to the east of Haidian Island

Due to their close proximity to the main island, the flora, fauna, and the climate are very similar.

====Disputed islands====


A number of small islands, which are located hundreds of kilometers to the south, are claimed and administered by Sansha as part of Hainan Province. Sovereignty of these islands is however disputed. These islands include:

*Paracel Islands Xisha Islands – &quot;The West-sands&quot; – claimed by Vietnam, the PRC and the Republic of China (Taiwan, ROC)
**Money Island, Paracel Islands
**Rocky Island, South China Sea
**Tree Island, South China Sea
**Triton Island
**Woody Island, South China Sea
*Zhongsha Islands – &quot;The Middle-sands&quot;
*Spratly Islands – Nansha Islands – &quot;The South-sands&quot; are subject to claims by Vietnam, the PRC, ROC, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Brunei.
**Spratly Island
**Flat Island (Spratly)
**Taiping Island
**James Shoal (southernmost point)
**Loaita Island
**Namyit Island
**Nanshan Island
**Sin Cowe Island
**Thitu Island
**West York Island

===Environment===
Compared to most of mainland China, the air quality of Hainan is significantly better since it is not affected by factory pollution, which has adversely affected the air on the mainland. Throughout 2012, Hainan had the highest air quality in the country for 351 days.

The provincial government&#x27;s environmental protection campaign has taken action against a number of industrial plants. During 2012, several outdated manufacturing facilities had their business licenses revoked, and 175 cases related to illegal sewage discharge were handled.

Total sulfur dioxide emissions for the province were 34,000 tons in 2012, a 3 percent year-on-year reduction. In 2011, smog emissions were reduced 6.3 percent to 15,000 tons.

Protected areas include the Yinggeling-Limushan and Wuzhishan-Diaoluoshan nature reserves.

===Climate===

The climate of Hainan is mostly tropical. The island&#x27;s two largest cities, Haikou and Sanya, both possess a tropical Köppen climate. The annual average temperature ranges from , Haikou is , Sanya is . The coldest months are January when temperatures drop to ; the hottest months are June and July, and the temperatures are . The daily average temperature in Hainan in all months is well above .

The summer in the northern part is hotter and, )

. The average annual precipitation is and can be as high as in central and eastern areas, and as low as in the coastal areas of the southwest. Parts of Hainan lie in the path of typhoons, and 70% of the annual precipitation is derived from typhoons and the summer rainy season. Major flooding occurs due to typhoons, which can cause many problems for local residents.

====Annual fog====
From January to February, the island of Hainan is often affected by thick fog, particularly in coastal areas and the northern part of the island. This is caused by cold winter air from the north coming into contact with the warmer sea, causing the moisture that evaporates from the sea to be condensed into fog. The fog remains from day to night, and is evenly distributed. Visibility may be reduced to for days at a time. During this period, residents normally keep windows shut. The moisture in the air is so extreme that the walls in homes weep, and floors often accumulate a layer of water. 

==Flora and fauna==

Hainan has over of tropical forest, in which can be found over 4,600 types of plants and more than 570 species of animals. The nature observation database iNaturalist.org currently lists 6,687 species of plants, animals and fungi as having been observed on Hainan Island (in 2024). In modern times, however, the small island&#x27;s natural balance has been threatened, largely due to the introduction of exotic species, as well as human impacts from tourism, deforestation, and the use of herbicides, pesticides and other such pollutants. A report from the Department of Land, Environment and Resources of Hainan Province states that 200 species are near extinction, with six plant species, such as &quot;Maytenus hainanensis&quot; and &quot;Sciaphila tenella&quot;, having been declared extinct.

Two ecoregions cover the island. The South China-Vietnam subtropical evergreen forests cover the lowlands, and extend onto the adjacent mainland. The Hainan Island monsoon rainforests covers the interior of the island, and includes montane rain forests with a more seasonal climate and more deciduous trees.

===Flora===
The majority of Hainan&#x27;s land area is covered in forest, with 61.5% total coverage. At the end of 2012, nearly 210,000 hectares (518,921 acres) of forest-cover was reported–an increase of from the previous year. A further of grasses and trees have been planted along the province&#x27;s highways.

There are around 53 genera, belonging to 29 families, of wild fruits, herbs and other significant crops growing on Hainan—both native and introduced—including several types of banana (&quot;Musa&quot; sp.), as well as cashew (&quot;Anacardium occidentale&quot;), mango (&quot;Mangifera indica&quot;), fiber agave (&quot;Agave sisalana&quot;), pineapple (&quot;Ananas comosus&quot;), bitter melon (&quot;Momordica charantia&quot;), ivy gourd (&quot;Coccinia grandis&quot;), giant taro (&quot;Alocasia macrorrhizos&quot;), Asian taro (&quot;A. odora&quot;), Malabar spinach (&quot;Basella alba&quot;) and papaya (&quot;Carica papaya&quot;). Four species of pepper grow on the island as well, including the economically significant black pepper (&quot;Piper nigrum&quot;). At least 25-30 species belonging to the order Zingiberales grow on Hainan, including numerous types of ginger, galangal, canna, turmeric (&quot;Curcuma&quot; sp.) and prayer-plants (Marantaceae), among others. Coconuts (&quot;Cocos&quot; sp.) are a fairly common sight along the coastline. Trees found on Hainan include at least 18 species of &quot;Ficus&quot;, the Hainan white pine (&quot;Pinus fenzeliana&quot;), Tenasserim pine (&quot;Pinus latteri&quot;) and several species of orchid tree (&quot;Bauhinia&quot;).

4,200 known species of plants are native to the island, including several endemic species, such as those within the genera &quot;Wenchengia&quot; and &quot;Metapetrocosmea&quot;. Additionally, the &quot;Cathayanthe&quot; and &quot;Chunia&quot; genera are found only on Hainan and in northern Vietnam.

Notable botanical species include:
* Hainan yellow lantern chili — a pepper similar to the Scotch bonnet.
* &quot;Cephalotaxus hainanensis&quot; — a species of plum-yew.

===Fauna===
Even with over ten million human inhabitants, Hainan contains several protected areas and wildlife preserves. The most ubiquitous smaller species on the island include such animals as frogs, toads, geckos, skinks, and butterflies; as with many adjacent tropical regions, the Arthropoda and invertebrates are well-represented here, with mosquitoes naturally being very common at certain times of the year. The swarms of biting, flying insects actually play a key role in island food chains and ecosystems, not only being consumed by many other species (such as bats and birds) but serving as pollinators for many types of flowering plants. Hainan&#x27;s lakes and waterways are populated with various freshwater fishes, such as carp and catfish, whose fry readily consume both mosquito eggs and larvae (laid on the water&#x27;s surface) for sustenance.

About 100 mammalian species are found on Hainan, with the Hainan black crested gibbon (&quot;Nomascus hainanus&quot;), the Hainan hare (&quot;Lepus hainanus&quot;), the Hainan gymnure, or moonrat (&quot;Neohylomys hainanensis&quot;), and the Hainan flying squirrel (&quot;Hylopetes electilis&quot;) all being endemic to the island. Larger native mammals include the Asiatic black or &quot;moon&quot; bear (&quot;Ursus thibetanus&quot;), sambar (&quot;Rusa unicolor&quot;), Eurasian otter (&quot;L. lutra&quot;), the crab-eating mongoose (&quot;Herpestes urva&quot;) and the leopard cat (&quot;Felis bengalensis&quot;), which are considered a species of conservation concern. Other mammals include Siberian chipmunks (&quot;Tamias sibiricus&quot;), squirrels, masked palm civets and the yellow-bellied weasel.

There are 362 known bird species. Seabirds such as gulls are not generally seen. Egrets and Black-winged kites are common in agricultural areas. The Hainan partridge, white-eared night heron, Hainan leaf warbler, and yellow-billed nuthatch are endemic to the island.

Secretive, and sometimes less commonly seen, are the snakes, such as the Asian palm pit viper, the red bamboo snake, and cobras.

In the seas surrounding Hainan, sea turtles and whale sharks are regular visitors.

Hainan island has rich bio-diversity of cetaceans and is the site of studying these in Chinese waters. Many whales such as North Pacific right whales, western gray whales, humpback whales, and blue whales (all of these are almost extinct in Chinese waters) were historically seen in the winter and spring to mate and calve. These gentle giants of the sea had been hunted heavily and were wiped out by Japanese whalers (established whaling stations on various sites on Chinese and Korean coasts including Hainan and Daya Bay). A few Bryde&#x27;s whales and minke whales may still occur in the adjacent waters along with on Leizhou Peninsula and the Gulf of Tonkin. Smaller species of whale and dolphins, such as short-finned pilot whales and pantropical spotted dolphins, but most notably the endangered Chinese white dolphin. Declared sanctuary for the species extends along the coasts. These dolphins may appear among clearer waters such as vicinity to Sanya.

Dugongs still occur in small number, mostly on Gulf of Tonkin side.

Notable species include:

* Hainan gymnure (&quot;Neohylomys hainanensis&quot; or Hainan moonrat) is a small mammal.
* Hainan partridge (&quot;Arborophila ardens&quot;) is a species of bird endemic to Hainan Island.
* Hainan peacock-pheasant (&quot;Polyplectron katsumatae&quot;) is an endangered species of the family Phasianidae.
* Hainan black crested gibbon (&quot;Nomascus hainanus&quot;) is one of the world&#x27;s most endangered primates. Seacology, a non-profit organization in Berkeley, California, United States, initiated a project to protect the highly endangered Hainan gibbon in exchange for scholarships for the children of four villages near Hainan Bawangling National Nature Reserve.
* Hainan hare (&quot;Lepus hainanus&quot;) is a species of hare endemic to Hainan.
* A subspecies of the leopard cat (&quot;Prionailurus bengalensis alleni&quot;) is endemic to Hainan.
* Hainan leaf-warbler (&quot;Phylloscopus hainanus&quot;) is an Old World warbler in the family Phylloscopidae.
* Little torrent frog (&quot;Amolops torrentis&quot;) is a species of frog found only on Hainan Island.

==Demographics==

The population density of Hainan is low compared to most coastal Chinese provinces.

In 2000, the ethnic groups of Hainan included the Han-Chinese Hainanese, who are the majority (84% of the population) and speak the Min language, the Li (Hlai) (14.7% of the population); the Miao (0.7%) and the Zhuang (0.6%). The Li, who speak a Tai-Kradai language, are the largest indigenous group on the island in terms of population. Also found on the island are the Utsuls, descendants of Cham refugees, who are classified as Hui by the Chinese government because of their Islamic religion. There is a Tanka community that lives at Sanya Bay.

The Li people mainly reside in the nine cities and counties in the middle and southern part of Hainan – the cities of Sanya, Wuzhishan and Dongfang, the Li autonomous counties of Baisha, Lingshui, Ledong, Changjiang, and the &#x27;Li and Miao Autonomous Counties of Qiongzhong and Baoting&#x27;. Some others live elsewhere on Hainan with other ethnic groups in Danzhou, Wanning, Qionghai, Lingshui and Tunchang. The area inhabited by the Li ethnic group totals , about 55 percent of the province&#x27;s total.
Although they are indigenous to the island and do not speak a Chinese language, the Limgao (Ong-Be) people near the capital (8% of the Hainan population) are counted as Han Chinese by the Chinese government.

===Religion===

Most of the Hainanese population practices Chinese folk religion and Chinese Buddhism. The Li population has a Theravada Buddhist minority. Most of the Utsuls of the island, a branch of Cham people living near Sanya, are Muslims. Because Hainan was a point in the travel route of missionaries, there are some Christians. According to the Chinese General Social Survey of 2009, Christians constitute 0.48% of the province&#x27;s population.

Nanshan Park is the center of Buddhism on Hainan. Encompassing more than of forest. The site includes countless grand temples, statues and spiritual gardens the likes of Savior Garden and Longevity Valley, with intricately trimmed hedges and abundant in lotus flowers, a venerated symbol in Buddhism meaning virtue or purity.

At the heart of the valley is the grand Nanshan Temple, its gates flanked by stone figures of Buddha in front of the Tang dynasty-style entrance. The interior displays images of the Four Heavenly Kings amid statues of other deities enshrined in renderings of stone, gold and jade.

Perhaps the most popular site within the Nanshan Buddhist Cultural Zone is the awe-inspiring stone rendering of the Bodhisattva Guan Yin, emerging out of the South China Sea to stand at 108 meters, taller than the Statue of Liberty.

The Nanshan Buddhist Cultural Zone is visited by thousands of tourists and pilgrims each year who come pay homage to the site that plays a significant role in the religion in China and to sample some of the finest Buddhist vegan cuisine on the island.

===Languages===
Most people in Hainan speak a variety of Min Chinese known as Hainanese. Other Chinese varieties and non-Chinese languages are spoken as well:

* Standard Mandarin (&quot;Putonghua&quot;) is widely known as in the rest of China. Mandarin is especially common in the city of Sanya.
** In Yacheng city (as well as its vicinity several dozen miles west of Huihui and Huixin), the so-called military speech dialect of Mandarin (the official language of the southwest among the northern Chinese dialects) is spoken.
* Cantonese is spoken by some, particularly in Haikou.
* In Yanglan village in the northeast, two Min dialects, both closely related to Cantonese, are spoken: the Mai dialect and the Danzhou dialect, spoken in Haipo Village in the south, which is the same dialect as the dialect spoken in Danzhou in Dan Country in the northern part of the island.
* The Li, Zhuang and Limgao speak Tai–Kadai languages.
* The Miao speak Hmong–Mien languages.
* There are roughly 4,500 Utsul people living in the villages of Yanglan () and Huixin (), two villages on the outskirts of Sanya. They speak the Tsat language, a member of the Austronesian Chamic languages.

==== Sociolinguistics ====
Standard Mandarin serves as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; between different ethnic groups. Adults who are members of a minority also have quite high literacy skills in Chinese. Most adults speak several Chinese dialects, and some also speak Li.

When Chams interact with the Hainanese dialect speakers from within Hainan Province, they use the Hainanese dialect, though youngsters generally use Mandarin. Not many can communicate in Li, so the Hainanese dialect or Mandarin is often used.

In the market place and within the Sanya Municipality, the Cham speakers use Cham among themselves, and with others mostly use the Hainanese dialect. However, in the market places near the government seat of Yanglan Township, the Chams either use the Hainanese dialect or the Mai dialect.

===Life expectancy and longevity===
The people of Hainan live longer than those on the mainland. At the end of 2017, there were 1,565 centenarians in Hainan. For every 100,000 people in the province, 17.13 were centenarians. As of 8 March 2018, there were 287,700 residents over 80 years of age, making up 3.15% of the population.

==Government==

Even while Hainan Island was a part of Guangdong it had a considerable amount of local autonomy; the southern half of the island was an autonomous prefecture. Hainan&#x27;s elevation to provincial level in 1988 increased its accountability to the Central People&#x27;s Government, but by designating the new province a special economic zone the central government expressed its intent to allow Hainan maximum flexibility in devising programs to facilitate foreign investment and economic growth. Administratively, the province has been divided into five economic major districts.

===Politics===

The politics of Hainan is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in mainland China.

The Governor of Hainan is the highest-ranking official in the People&#x27;s Government of Hainan. However, in the province&#x27;s dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Hainan Chinese Communist Party Provincial Committee Secretary or CCP Party Chief. The current Hainan Party Chief is Shen Xiaoming.

===Legislation===
On 13 April 1988, the First Session of the Seventh National People&#x27;s Congress decided to establish Hainan Province, and at the same time granted the Hainan Provincial People&#x27;s Congress and its Standing Committee special legislative power.
After the 2019 free trade port plan is proposed, Hainan can enact legislation in economic, cultural, local affairs, social management, etc., and implement it in the Hainan Free Trade Zone (port).

===Intelligence===
Per the research conducted by Information Warfare Monitor, Hainan is the physical location of GhostNet. The Chinese government has officially denied the existence of a cyber war and intelligence operations anywhere on the island.

===Administrative===
In the official PRC territorial claim, Hainan Province includes not just one island, but also some two hundred South China Sea Islands. While the containment of the South China Sea Islands means that Hainan Province has a very large water body, it has a disproportionally small land area. James Shoal (, Zēngmǔ Ànshā), which is presently marked by the PRC, signifies the country&#x27;s southernmost border. But Malaysia also claims that it is on their continental shelf.

===Subdivisions===

Hainan Province uses a slightly different administrative system than the other provinces of China. Most other provinces are divided entirely into prefecture-level divisions, each of which is then divided entirely into county-level divisions. County-level divisions generally do not come directly under the province. In Hainan, nearly all county-level divisions (the eight districts excepted) come directly under the province. This method of division is due to Hainan&#x27;s relatively sparse population, totaling 9.26 million as of 2017.

====Urban areas====
===Military base===

Hainan Island is home to the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy Hainan Submarine Base and strategic nuclear submarine naval harbor at Yalong Bay. The naval base is estimated to be high, built into hillsides around a military base. The caverns are capable of hiding up to 20 nuclear submarines from spy satellites. The harbor houses nuclear ballistic missile submarines and is large enough to accommodate aircraft carriers. The U.S. Department of Defense has estimated that China will have five type 094 submarines operational by 2010 with each capable of carrying 12 JL-2 ballistic missiles. Two piers and three smaller ones would be enough to accommodate two carrier strike groups or amphibious assault ships.

==Economy==
Hainan&#x27;s economy is predominantly agricultural, and more than a half of the island&#x27;s exports are agricultural products. Hainan&#x27;s elevation to province-level status (1988), however, was accompanied by its designation as China&#x27;s largest &quot;special economic zone&quot;, the intent being to hasten the development of the island&#x27;s plentiful resources. Prior to this, the province had a reputation for being a &quot;Wild West&quot; area, largely untouched by industrialization; even today there are relatively few factories in the province. Tourism plays an important part of Hainan&#x27;s economy, thanks largely to its tropical beaches and lush forests. The central government has encouraged foreign investment in Hainan and has allowed the island to rely to a large extent on market forces.

Hainan&#x27;s industrial development largely has been limited to the processing of its mineral and agricultural products, particularly rubber and iron ore. Since the 1950s, machinery, farm equipment, and textiles have been manufactured in the Haikou area for local consumption. A major constraint on industrial expansion has been an inadequate supply of electricity. Much of the island&#x27;s generating capacity is hydroelectric, and it is subject to seasonal fluctuations in stream and river flows.

In December 2009, the government of China announced that it plans to establish Hainan as an &quot;international tourist destination&quot; by 2020. This announcement contributed to a surge in the province&#x27;s economy, with a year-on-year increase in investment of 136.9% in the first three months of 2010.

===Agriculture===

Owing to Hainan&#x27;s tropical climate, paddy rice is cultivated extensively in the northeastern lowlands and in the southern mountain valleys. Leading crops other than rice include coconut, palm oil, sisal, tropical fruits (including pineapples, of which Hainan is China&#x27;s leading producer), black pepper, coffee, tea, cashews, and sugarcane.

The hot Hainan yellow lantern chili, a variety similar to the scotch bonnet, is unique to the island, and is grown in the southeast and southwest.

The total tropical crop area of Hainan is 100,000 hectares.

Hainan is a major rubber producer. In the early 20th century Chinese emigrants returning from then British Malaya, introduced rubber trees to the island; after 1950, state farms were developed, and Hainan now produces a substantial amount of China&#x27;s rubber. Natural rubber is now grown on 246,000 hectares of land. This ranks 6th in the world in harvest area and 5th in terms of output.

Hainan has almost 93,000 hectares of areca palms. The product, the areca nut, is consumed locally and also sent to the mainland. Ninety-five percent of China&#x27;s production of this nut is produced in Hainan.

Domesticated farm animals comprise mainly goats, cows, water buffalo, chickens, geese and ducks.

====Fisheries====

Grouper, Spanish mackerel, and tuna constitute the bulk of the catch from offshore fishing grounds. Scallops and pearls are raised in shallow bays and basins for local use and export.

Shrimp production is estimated to have been in 2007, more than 50% of which was exported. Hainan has over 400 hatcheries, most being located between Wenchang and Qionghai.

The government of Hainan is expanding the province&#x27;s medical tourism industry. The provincial government has established the Boao Lecheng International Medical Tourism Pilot Zone in the Bo&#x27;ao area. The zone is located six kilometers from the Boao Forum for Asia and covers 20 square kilometers. This was announced at the Boao Forum for Asia in 2011. The State Council has approved the development of Lecheng Island as a medical tourism-themed destination. Lecheng Island is a small island in the Wanquan River about west of the coastal town of Bo&#x27;ao on the west coast of the province. Construction on the 20 km2. The zone was begun in December 2014 and will cost a projected 1.5 billion yuan. It was scheduled for completion in 2016 and is the first special zone for medical travel in China. As part of the zone, the Boao Super Hospital opened in 2018.

====Historical sites====

Haikou is the province&#x27;s capital and contains interesting historic sites. Also known as Coconut City, Haikou is a major port. The Five Officials Temple (, ) consists of five traditional temples and halls that were built in honor of five officials of the Tang (618–907) and Song (960–1279) dynasties. These officials were banished to Hainan for periods ranging from 11 days to 11 years for speaking out against what they felt were wrong practices by the emperors. (It is perhaps significant that the establishment of the Five Officials Temple in the late 19th century coincides with a time when China&#x27;s territorial integrity was under threat, and that several of the officials honored here were exiled for espousing aggressive policies on the recapture of the north of China from the Jurchens during the Southern Song dynasty.)

Xiuying Fort was built in 1891 to defend the southeastern corner of China during the Sino-French War. The Xiuying Fort Barbette covers about a third of an acre. Its five large cannons are still intact and viewable at the site.
The Tomb of Hai Rui () is a key national cultural protection site. Hai Rui was a compassionate and popular official of Hainanese origins who lived during the Ming dynasty. He was famous for his lifelong honesty and his willingness to speak out on behalf of local people. In later life, Hai Rui was persecuted and fell out of favor with the emperor. His admirers built the Hai Rui Tomb after his death to commemorate his great works. Construction of the tomb began in 1589.

The Yangpu Ancient Salt Field is a heritage site in Yantian village on Yangpu Peninsula. The area comprises more than 1,000 stones, cut flat on top, used to dry seawater to produce salt.

During 2018, the two duty-free shops had sales of more than 10 billion RMB and received 2.88 million customers.

===Natural resources===
Hainan has commercially exploitable reserves of more than 30 minerals. Iron, first mined by the Japanese during their occupation of the island in World War II, is the most important. Also important are titanium, manganese, tungsten, bauxite, molybdenum, cobalt, copper, gold, and silver. There are large deposits of lignite and oil shale on the island, and significant offshore finds of oil and natural gas have been discovered. Virgin forests in the interior mountains contain more than 20 commercially valuable species, including teak and sandalwood.

===Real estate market===
In 1990, Hainan province was the site of the largest property bust in modern Chinese history With 2009 and the announcement of the Chinese Government&#x27;s plan to develop the province into a major international tourist location, property sales rose by 73%, creating the possibility of another bubble in Hainan&#x27;s property market.

===Hainan Free trade port===
On 13 April 2018, Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping announced a plan to gradually make the island into a pilot free trade zone by 2020, and transform the entire island into a free trade port by 2025. This will involve inviting foreign and multi-national companies to set up their regional and international headquarters in Hainan. Goods and services would be subject to low or even no tariffs. The zone will become China&#x27;s largest free trade zone, and the first trade port since 1949, when the People&#x27;s Republic of China was founded. Part of the plan is to establish exchanges in commodities and carbon trading, international energy, and shipping. Emphasis will also be placed on the development of service industries including tourism, the Internet, healthcare, finance, as well as conference and exhibitions hosting.

Since the announcement in April 2018, Hainan had signed 159 contracts with major companies. In September 2018, China National Travel Service Group, China&#x27;s biggest travel business conglomerate, relocated its headquarters from Beijing to Haikou. In October 2018, Baidu and Hainan signed a deal to build a 10-billion-yuan (US$1.45 billion) eco-village.

During that gathering, the Hainan government signed contracts with 26 international companies including Globevisa Group, Merlin Entertainments Group, Viacom, Ikea Group, Mapletree Investments, Avis Budget Group, Star Cruises, and Boehringer Ingelheim.

To bring talented workers to Hainan, in November 2018 the Hainan government held a recruitment fair in Beijing in an effort to bring 7,471 people to Hainan to work in government agencies, companies, and other institutions.

Established prior to this announcement, and currently in existence, are the following economic and technological development zones:
* Haikou Free Trade Zone
* Haikou New &amp; Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone
* Yangpu Economic Development Zone

In June 2020, China set the corporate income tax rate for Hainan Free Trade port enterprises engaged in specified manufacturing activities.

In 2021, Hainan Free Trade Port Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China was adopted by the National People&#x27;s Congress and ratified under the No.85 Order of the President of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 2021. According to the law, by 2025, &quot;feng guan&quot; (封关, which is directly translated into &quot;customs closure&quot;) will be fully implemented and all goods sold to other parts of China from Hainan would be treated as imports, in a similar way as Hong Kong SAR.

==Transport==

===Road===
Before 1950 there were practically no transport links with the interior of the island. The first roads were built in the early 20th century, but no major road construction was undertaken in the mountains until the 1950s. Parallel north–south roads along the east and west coasts and through the interior of the island constitute most of Hainan&#x27;s road network.

Hainan is the only province in China that does not have highway toll stations. This is due to the 1994 &quot;fee-to-tax&quot; reform. Instead, road maintenance costs are raised through a 60% tax on fuel.

There are several major highways and expressways linking Haikou on the north coast with Sanya on the south coast. The G224 is 309 kilometers long and runs through the middle of the province. The Hainan Ring Highway has three parts: The G225 is long and is the western part. For most of its length, the G225 runs parallel to the Hainan western ring railway. The G223 is the eastern part, running from Haikou to Sanya. It is 323 kilometers long. The G98 is a 612.8-kilometer-long orbital expressway that encircles the island. Hainan Highway 1, a new 1,040-km-long scenic highway, will be built around the island, along the coast starting in May 2019.

There are also numerous rural roads within the province. These are typically two-way asphalt roads and connect larger towns. Connecting the thousands of villages to one another and to farms, are concrete roads about 6 meters wide. Many of these were built from roughly from the year 2000 onward, and as of 2019, are still being built.

===Bridges===

While a bridge connecting Hainan to the Leizhou peninsula on the mainland was planned in the early 2000s it never came to fruition. A bridge or tunnel received continued consideration in 2018, as travel by air or ferry can leave residents and visitors isolated when bad weather sets in.

===Air===
Hainan Province has two international airports (Haikou Meilan International Airport and Sanya Phoenix International Airport) and two domestic airports (Qionghai Bo&#x27;ao Airport and Danzhou Airport, the latter is under construction.)

===Rail===

Today&#x27;s Hainan is ringed by standard-gauge railways. Since 2004, a rail ferry connects the island&#x27;s railroad network to Guangdong, mainland China. In 2005, Ministry of Communications allocated 20 million yuan (US$2.4 million) to set up a committee to research and study the possibility of a bridge or tunnel link connecting the island to the mainland. From the ferry terminal, located near Haikou railway station (west of Haikou), freight and passenger trains arriving from the mainland can proceed on the Hainan western ring railway along the island&#x27;s west coast, via Dongfang to Sanya. This railway line has been developed over several decades, starting with a few short narrow gauge lines constructed during the Japanese occupation in the early 1940s.

There is a high-speed railway ring around the island, formed by the eastern ring and western ring along the island&#x27;s coast. Both high-speed railways are connected with Haikou and Sanya. There are 15 stations along the east coast, and 16 stations along the west coast. Trains are designed to travel at on the east ring, and on the west ring. The total length of eastern ring is , while the western ring is . The first eastern ring high-speed train run started on 30 December 2010, and the Hainan western ring high-speed railway started its operation in 2015.

===Seaports===

* Haikou Xiuying Port () serves as the main passenger and cargo center.
* Haikou New Port () opened 1 June 2005
* Macun Port () located in Chengmai County; opened 1 June 2005
* Hainan Strait Port
* Basuo Port in Dongfang City is a small port on the west coast of Hainan. One of its main cargos is iron ore from the Shilu Mine.

Hainan received 11,000 tons of products via ports November 2010, up 90.1 percent month-on-month. Between January and November 2010, 102,000 tons of products were exported via Hainan, 34,000 tons of which were exported to the US, and 14,000 tons sent to the EU.

====Province-wide infrastructure development====
From 2015 to the present, a widespread program to improve cities and other settlements in Hainan island has been taking place. It includes the removal of litter from towns, villages, and many roadsides. Small, illegal dumps are being removed. However, illegal dumping of construction debris still occurs on rural roads. Large, plastic dumpsters have been put in place within villages and at countryside road intersections. Towns are being improved with new road and sidewalk surfaces, landscaping features are being created, and many buildings are receiving new façades.

This initiative in Haikou has seen entire neighborhoods demolished and rebuilt, sanitation improved, illegal structures used for business removed, roadside vendors banned, roads and sidewalks replaced, and new street crossings with traffic lights installed.

==Settlement==

As a frontier region celebrated by such exiled poets as Su Dongpo, Hainan acquired an air of mystery and romance. The influx of large numbers of mainlanders after 1950 – particularly in the 1970s, when young Chinese from southern Guangdong were assigned to state farms to help develop Hainan, and in the 1980s, when thousands more came to take advantage of the economic opportunities offered – has perpetuated the frontier atmosphere on the island.

In the late 1960s, the influx of sent-down youths (primarily from Guangdong) to Hainan island led to the use of the phrase, &quot;being rooted in Hainan&quot; to refer to commitment to the revolutionary cause. By the early 1970s, the meaning of the phrase had evolved to refer to getting married and starting a family on the island.

==Media==
As well as programs from Central China Television (CCTV), Hainan has a number of local TV stations including Hainan TV and Haikou TV. The Chinese language &quot;Nanguo Metropolis Daily&quot;, &quot;Haikou Evening News&quot;, and &quot;Hainan Daily&quot; newspapers are published in Haikou.

A large film studio is located in the south part of Haikou. Movie Town Haikou comprises several studio buildings and an artificial town used as filming sets and a visitor attraction.

==Cuisine==
Hainan cuisine is said to be &quot;lighter, with mild seasonings.&quot; A lot of local taste is mixed with the Han Chinese taste. Seafood predominates the menu, as shrimp, crab, fish and other sea life are widely available.

Wenchang chicken is a dish known throughout the province of Hainan. Although there are many varieties of this dish, the name is usually used to define a type of small, free-range chicken from Wenchang, located on the east coast of the province. As opposed to battery chickens, its meat has more texture and is somewhat drier.

Hainan chicken rice / Coibui is a famous dish in Southeast Asia, particularly Singapore and Malaysia, bearing the region&#x27;s name. However, while many restaurants use chicken fat to quickly add flavor to the dish, the proper local method is to &#x27;marinate&#x27; the rice with chicken soup to add a more full flavor.

==Events==
Numerous events are hosted or sponsored on the island, including:
* Blue Bay LPGA – Women&#x27;s Golf LPGA tournament, held annually at Jian Lake Blue Bay Golf Course

==Miscellaneous topics==
*The novel, &quot;Red Detachment of Women&quot;, by Liang Xin, was set in Hainan. The novel was first adapted to a feature film in the 1950s, and then a ballet in the 1960s as one of the Eight model plays. Most of the people of that time derived their romanticized image of Hainan Island from the scenes in the ballet, particularly that of the vivid forests of coconut trees, the Five Finger Mountain (Wuzhi Shan), and the Wanquan River.
*Two notable lighthouses are located on Hainan: the Baishamen Lighthouse and Mulantou Lighthouse are among the tallest in the world, the latter being the tallest in China.

<text>Jiangsu is an eastern coastal province of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It is one of the leading provinces in finance, education, technology, and tourism, with its capital in Nanjing. Jiangsu is the third smallest, but the fifth most populous, with a population of 84.75 million, and the most densely populated of the 22 provinces of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Jiangsu has the highest GDP per capita and second-highest GDP of Chinese provinces, after Guangdong. Jiangsu borders Shandong in the north, Anhui to the west, and Zhejiang and Shanghai to the south. Jiangsu has a coastline of over along the Yellow Sea, and the Yangtze River passes through the southern part of the province.

Since the Sui and Tang dynasties, Jiangsu has been a national economic and commercial center, partly due to the construction of the Grand Canal. Cities such as Nanjing, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and Shanghai (separated from Jiangsu in 1927) are all major Chinese economic hubs. Since the initiation of economic reforms in 1990, Jiangsu has become a focal point for economic development. It is widely regarded as one of China&#x27;s most developed provinces, when measured by its Human Development Index (HDI). Its 2021 nominal GDP per capita reached RMB 137,300 (US$21,287), becoming the first province in China to reach the $20,000 mark.

Jiangsu is home to many of the world&#x27;s leading exporters of electronic equipment, chemicals and textiles. It has also been China&#x27;s largest recipient of foreign direct investment since 2006. In 2022, its GDP was more than CNY¥12.29 trillion (US$1.83 trillion in nominal), which is the sixth-highest of all administrative divisions. If it were a country, it would be the twelfth-largest economy as of 2022 as well as the 19th most populous.

Jiangsu is also one of the leading provinces in research and education in China. As of 2022, Jiangsu hosts 168 institutions of higher education, ranking first of all Chinese provinces. Jiangsu has many highly ranked educational institutions, with 16 number of universities listed in the Double First-Class Construction, ranking second after Beijing. As of 2023, four major cities in Jiangsu ranked in the world&#x27;s top 200 (Nanjing 6th, Suzhou 40th, Zhenjiang 166th and Wuxi 188th) cities by scientific research output, as tracked by the Nature Index.


==Name==
Jiangsu&#x27;s name is a compound of the first elements of the names of the two cities of Jiangning (now Nanjing) and Suzhou. The abbreviation for this province is &quot;&quot; (), the second character of its name.

==History==

During the earliest Chinese dynasties, the area that is now Jiangsu was far away from the center of Chinese civilization, which was in the northwest Henan; it was home of the Huai barbarians (), an ancient ethnic group. During the Zhou dynasty more contact was made, and eventually the state of Wu appeared in southern Jiangsu, one of the many hundreds of states that existed across northern and central China at that time. Near the end of the Spring and Autumn period, Wu became a great power under King Helu of Wu, and defeated in 484 BC the state of Qi, a major power in the north in modern-day Shandong province, and contest for the position of overlord over all states of China. The state of Wu was subjugated in 473 BC by the state of Yue, another state that had emerged to the south in modern-day Zhejiang province. Yue was in turn subjugated by the powerful state of Chu from the west in 333 BC. Eventually the state of Qin swept away all the other states, and unified China in 221 BC.

Under the reign of the Han dynasty (206 BC to 220 AD), Jiangsu was removed from the centers of civilization in the North China Plain, and was administered under two &quot;zhou&quot; (provinces): Xu Province in the north, and Yang Province in the south. During the Three Kingdoms period, southern Jiangsu became the base of the Eastern Wu (222 to 280), whose capital, Jianye (later renamed to Jiankang), is modern Nanjing. When nomadic invasions overran northern China in the 4th century, the imperial court of the Jin dynasty moved to Jiankang. Cities in southern and central Jiangsu swelled with the influx of migrants from the north. Jiankang remained as the capital for four successive Southern dynasties and became the largest commercial and cultural center in China.

After the Sui dynasty united the country in 581, the political center of the country shifted back to the north, but the Grand Canal was built through Jiangsu to link the Central Plains with the prosperous Yangtze Delta. The Tang dynasty (618–907) relied on southern Jiangsu for annual deliveries of grain. It was during the Song dynasty (960–1279), which saw the development of a wealthy mercantile class and emergent market economy in China, that Jiangnan (southern Jiangsu, Shanghai, and adjacent areas) emerged as a center of trade. From then onwards, major cities like Suzhou or Yangzhou, would be synonymous with opulence and luxury in China. Today the region remains one of the richest parts of China.

The Jurchen Jin dynasty gained control of North China in 1127 during the Jin-Song wars, and Huai River, which used to cut through north Jiangsu to reach the Yellow Sea, was the border between the north, under the Jin, and the south, under the Southern Song dynasty. The Mongols took control of China in the thirteenth century. The Ming dynasty, which was established in 1368 after driving out the Mongols who had occupied China, initially put its capital in Nanjing. Regions surrounding Nanjing, corresponding to Jiangsu and Anhui today, were designated as the Nanzhili province (literally &quot;southern directly governed&quot;). Following a coup by Zhu Di (later, the Yongle Emperor), however, the capital was moved to Beijing, far to the north, although Nanjing kept its status as the southern capital. In late Ming, Jiangnan continued to be an important center of trade in China; some historians see in the flourishing textiles industry at the time incipient industrialization and capitalism, a trend that was however aborted.

The Qing dynasty converted Nanzhili to &quot;Jiangnan province&quot;; in 1666 Jiangsu and Anhui were split apart as separate provinces. Jiangsu&#x27;s borders have been for the most part stable since then.

With the start of Western incursion into China in the 1840s, the rich and mercantile Yangtze river delta was increasingly exposed to Western influence; Shanghai, originally an unremarkable little town of Jiangsu, quickly developed into a metropolis of trade, banking, and cosmopolitanism, and was split out later as an independent municipality. Jiangnan also figures strongly in the Taiping Rebellion (18511864), a massive and deadly rebellion that attempted to set up a Christian theocracy in China; it started far to the south, in Guangdong province, swept through much of South China, and by 1853, had established Nanjing as its capital, renamed as Tianjing ( &quot;Heavenly Capital&quot;).

The Republic of China was established in 1912, and China was soon torn apart by warlords. Jiangsu changed hands several times, but in April 1927, Chiang Kai-shek established a government at Nanjing; he was soon able to bring most of China under his control. This was however interrupted by the second Sino-Japanese War, which began full-scale in 1937; on December 13, 1937, Nanjing fell, and the combined atrocities of the occupying Japanese for the next three months would come to be known as the Rape of Nanjing, after which it became the seat of the collaborationist government of East China under Wang Jingwei, and most of Jiangsu remained under Japanese occupation until the end of the war in 1945.

After the war, Nanjing was once again the capital of the Republic of China, though now the Chinese Civil War had broken out between the Kuomintang government and Communist forces, based further north, mostly in Northeast China. The decisive Huaihai Campaign was fought in northern Jiangsu; it resulted in Kuomintang defeat, and the communists were soon able to cross the Yangtze River and take Nanjing. The Kuomintang fled southward and eventually ended up in Taipei, from which the Republic of China government continues to administer Taiwan, Pescadores, and its neighboring islands, though it also continues to claim (technically, at least) Nanjing as its rightful &quot;de jure&quot; capital.

After the communist takeover, Beijing (formerly Peiping) was made capital of the People&#x27;s Republic, and Nanjing was demoted to be the provincial capital of Jiangsu. The economic reforms of Deng Xiaoping initially focused on the south coast of China, in Guangdong province, which soon left Jiangsu behind; starting from the 1990s they were applied more evenly to the rest of China. Suzhou and Wuxi, two southern cities of Jiangsu in close proximity to neighboring Shanghai, have since become particularly prosperous, being among the top 10 cities in China in terms of gross domestic product and outstripping the provincial capital of Nanjing. The income disparity between northern and southern Jiangsu however remains large.

==Geography==

Jiangsu is flat, with plains covering 68 percent of its total area (water covers another 18 percent). Most of the province stands not more than above sea level. Jiangsu also has a well-developed irrigation system, which earned it (especially the southern half) the moniker of (&quot;shuǐxiāng&quot; &quot;land of water&quot;). The southern city of Suzhou has so many canals that it has been dubbed &quot;Venice of the East&quot; or the &quot;Venice of the Orient&quot;. The Grand Canal of China cuts through Jiangsu from north to south, crossing all the east–west river systems. Jiangsu also borders the Yellow Sea. The Yangtze River, the longest river of China, cuts through the province in the south and reaches the East China Sea, which divides the region into two parts: more urban, prosperous south and more poorer, rural north, and these two parts has a tense division.
Mount Huaguo, near the city of Lianyungang, is the highest point in Jiangsu, at an altitude of above sea level. Large lakes in Jiangsu include Lake Tai (the largest), Lake Hongze, Lake Gaoyou, Lake Luoma, and Lake Yangcheng.

Before 1194 A.D., the Huai River cut through north Jiangsu to reach the Yellow Sea. The Huai River is a major river in central China, and it was the traditional border between North China and South China. Since 1194 A.D., the Yellow River further to the north changed its course several times, running into the Huai River in north Jiangsu each time instead of its other usual path northwards into Bohai Bay. The silting caused by the Yellow River was so heavy that after its last episode of &quot;hijacking&quot; the Huai River ended in 1855: the Huai River was no longer able to go through its usual path into the sea. Instead it flooded, pooled up (thereby forming and enlarging Lake Hongze and Lake Gaoyou), and flowed southwards through the Grand Canal into the Yangtze. The old path of the Huai River is now marked by a series of irrigation channels, the most significant of which is the North Jiangsu Main Irrigation Canal (), which channels a small amount of the water of the Huai River alongside south of its old path into the sea.

Most of Jiangsu has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot; or &quot;Cwa&quot; in the Köppen climate classification), beginning to transition into a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dwa&quot;) in the far north. Seasonal changes are clear-cut, with temperatures at an average of in January and in July. Rain falls frequently between spring and summer (&quot;meiyu&quot;), typhoons with rainstorms occur in late summer and early autumn. As with the rest of the coast, tornados are possible. The annual average rainfall is , concentrated mostly in summer during the southeast monsoon.

=== Climate change in Jiangsu ===
Due to its flat terrain, low altitude, and dense population, Jiangsu is one of the most vulnerable regions in China to climate change and its ensuing sea level rise. According to the data collected by the Center of Climate Change in Jiangsu from 1961 to 2007, on average, the province experiences an temperature increase between 0.16 and 0.45 Celsius per 10 years and total precipitation change between -28.7 and 37.09 mm per 10 years. Extreme weather have become stronger and more common. Jiangsu&#x27;s agriculture, ecosystem, water resource, transportation, and coastline are all negatively impacted. The speed of sea level rise exceeds the world&#x27;s average by a large margin.

Specifically, a ranking on climate change risk of global regions released in early 2023 by The Cross Dependency Initiative (XDI) puts Jiangsu as the most vulnerable of the entire world. Jiangsu is at more risk due to its extensive industrial, trade, residential, and commercial development.

In response to climate disturbance across the country, the fourteenth five-year plan, endorsed by the National People&#x27;s Congress in 2021, indicates the general direction and various steps towards a low-carbon transition. On a provincial level, the Jiangsu government aims to achieve an 18% carbon dioxide decrease per unit GDP and accelerate the development of a green, low-carbon economy, as indicated in the 14th five-year development. The province also plans to recover the damaged coastal regions such as Lianyugang and Yancheng, and improve resilience against rising sea level by implementing seawalls and river floodgates.

Major cities:

* Wuxi
* Xuzhou
* Changzhou
* Yangzhou
* Lianyungang
* Yancheng
* Zhenjiang
* Nantong
* Huai&#x27;an

==Administrative divisions==

Jiangsu is divided into thirteen prefecture-level divisions, all prefecture-level cities (including a sub-provincial city):



These prefecture-level cities are in turn subdivided into 95 county-level divisions (55 districts, 21 county-level cities, and 19 counties). Those are in turn divided into 1,237 township-level divisions (699 towns, 19 townships, and 519 subdistricts). At the end of the year 2021, the total population was 85.05 million.

=== Urban areas ===


==Politics==
The politics of Jiangsu is structured in a one party (Communist) government system like all other governing institutions in mainland China.

The Governor of Jiangsu is the highest-ranking official in the People&#x27;s Government of Jiangsu. However, in the province&#x27;s dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Jiangsu Chinese Communist Party Provincial Committee Secretary, colloquially termed the &quot;Jiangsu CCP Party Chief&quot;.

=== Courts ===
In July 2021, the Jiangsu Intermediate Court established a labor tribunal to handle labor disputes arising from the platform economy.

==Economy==
As of 2022, Jiangsu had a gross domestic product (GDP) of CNY¥12.29 trillion (US$1.83 trillion), the second-highest in China after Guangdong. Its GDP is greater than those of Australia and South Korea, which are the world&#x27;s 12th- and 13th-largest economies respectively. In 2022, Jiangsu&#x27;s GDP adjusted by purchasing power parity was $3.04 trillion, making it the 3rd-largest of any country subdivision globally, behind California and Guangdong. Jiangsu&#x27;s economy in PPP also was just behind that of Italy with a GDP PPP of $ $3.05 trillion, the 12th largest in the world.

Jiangsu is very wealthy among the provinces of China. Its 2022 nominal GDP per capita reached ¥144,390 (US$21,467), becoming the first province in China to reach the $20,000 mark. Cities like Nanjing, Suzhou, and Wuxi have GDPs per capita around twice the provincial average, making south Jiangsu one of the most prosperous regions in China.

The province has an extensive irrigation system supporting its agriculture, which is based primarily on rice and wheat, followed by maize and sorghum. Main cash crops include cotton, soybeans, peanuts, rapeseed, sesame, ambary hemp, and tea. Other products include peppermint, spearmint, bamboo, medicinal herbs, apples, pears, peaches, loquats, ginkgo. Silkworms form an important part of Jiangsu&#x27;s agriculture, with the Lake Tai region to the south a major base of silk production in China. Jiangsu is an important producer of freshwater fish and other aquatic products.

Jiangsu has coal, petroleum, and natural gas deposits, but its most significant mineral products are non-metal minerals such as halite (rock salt), sulfur, phosphorus, and marble. The city of Xuzhou is a coal hub of China. The salt mines of Huaiyin have more than 0.4 trillion tonnes of deposits, one of the greatest collections of deposits in China.

Jiangsu is historically oriented toward light industries such as textiles and food industry. Since 1949, Jiangsu has developed heavy industries such as chemical industry and construction materials. Jiangsu&#x27;s important industries include machinery, electronic, chemicals, and automobile. The government has worked hard to promote the solar industry and hoped by 2012 the solar industry would be worth 100 billion RMB. Jiangsu&#x27;s economy growth has directly benefited from the reform Chinese&#x27;s policies, and its growth trajectory reflects that of many other coastal provinces, such as Zhejiang and Shandong. The economic reforms of Deng Xiaoping have greatly benefited southern cities, especially Suzhou and Wuxi, which outstrip the provincial capital, Nanjing, in total output. In the eastern outskirts of Suzhou, Singapore has built the Suzhou Industrial Park, a flagship of Sino-Singaporean cooperation and the only industrial park in China that is in its entirety the investment of a single foreign country.

Jiangsu contains over 100 different economic and technological development zones devoted to different types of investments.

==Demographics==

The majority of Jiangsu residents are ethnic Han Chinese. Other minorities include the Hui and the Manchus. In 2021, 73.94 percent of the province lived in urban areas, while 26.06 lived in rural areas.

; Demographic indicators in 2021
Population: 85.05 million (urban: 62.89 million; rural: 39.421 million)&lt;br&gt;
Birth rate: 5.65 per 1000&lt;br&gt;
Death rate: 6.77 per 1000&lt;br&gt;
Sex ratio: 103.05 males per 100 females&lt;br&gt;
Literacy rate: 96.94%

=== Religion ===
The predominant religions in Jiangsu are Chinese folk religions, Taoist traditions and Chinese Buddhism. According to surveys conducted in 2007 and 2009, 16.67% of the population believes and is involved in cults of ancestors, while 2.64% of the population identifies as Christian. The reports didn&#x27;t give figures for other types of religion; 80.69% of the population may be either irreligious or involved in worship of nature deities, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, folk religious sects, and small minorities of Muslims.

In 2010, there were 130,757 Muslims in Jiangsu.

==Transportation==
===Air===
Nanjing Lukou International Airport serves as the major airport in the province, with flights to Tokyo, Osaka, Hong Kong, Seoul-Incheon, Frankfurt, Bangkok, Milan, Vancouver and Los Angeles. Other passenger airports include Sunan Shuofang International Airport, Changzhou Benniu Airport, Yangzhou Taizhou International Airport, and Nantong Xingdong Airport. Air traffic in the populated Suzhou area is often diverted to Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport, to which Suzhou is conveniently connected to via bus services and by expressway.

Xuzhou Guanyin International Airport, Yancheng Nanyang International Airport, and Lianyungang Baitabu Airport serve as hubs in northern Jiangsu.

===Rail===
The southern part of the province, namely the Shanghai-Nanjing corridor, has very high-frequency rail services. Jiangsu is on the Jinghu railway from Beijing to Shanghai, as well as the high speed line between the two cities: Shanghai–Nanjing intercity railway and Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway, completed in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Since the completion of the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed line, travel time between Beijing and Nanjing has been reduced to approximately four hours (from eleven hours previously); travel time between Nanjing and Shanghai on the fastest high-speed trains takes just over an hour.

As of 2022, all major cities in Jiangsu have been connected by high-speed lines, including: Shanghai-Nanjing intercity railway since 2010, Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway since 2011, Nanjing–Hangzhou high-speed railway since 2013, Nanjing–Anqing intercity railway since 2015, Lianyungang–Zhenjiang high-speed railway since 2020, Xuzhou–Yancheng high-speed railway since 2019, Yancheng–Nantong high-speed railway since 2020, Shanghai–Suzhou–Nantong railway since 2020, and Lianyungang–Xuzhou high-speed railway since 2021.

===Road===
Jiangsu&#x27;s road network is one of the most developed in the country. The Beijing–Shanghai Expressway (G2) enters the province from the north and passes through Huai&#x27;an, Yangzhou, Taizhou, and Wuxi on the way to Shanghai; travelling from Shanghai westbound, the G2 forks at Wuxi and continues onto Nanjing separately as G42, the Shanghai–Nanjing Expressway, which serves the widely travelled southern corridor of the province. The Ningchang Expressway links Nanjing with Changzhou. The Suzhou area is extensively networked with expressways, going in all directions. The Yanhai Expressway links the coastal regions of the province, passing through Nantong, Yancheng, and Lianyungang.

Historically, the province was divided by the Yangtze River into northern and southern regions. The first bridge across the river in Jiangsu, the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, was completed in 1968 during the Cultural Revolution. The second bridge crossing, Jiangyin Bridge, opened 30 years later at Jiangyin. As of October 2014, there were 11 cross-Yangtze bridges in the province, including the five in Nanjing, which also has two cross-river tunnels. The Jiangyin Bridge (), Runyang Bridge (opened in 2005, connecting Yangzhou and Zhenjiang, ), and Fourth Nanjing Bridge (opened in 2012; ) all rank among the ten longest suspension bridges in the world. The Sutong Bridge, opened in 2008, connecting Nantong and Changshu, has one of the longest cable-stayed bridge spans in the world, at .

===Metro (subway)===
As of December 2022, Jiangsu has six cities that have operational subway systems, together with an extra city (Huai&#x27;an) currently under construction. These six cities are Nanjing, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Xuzhou and Nantong.

The Nanjing Metro was opened in September 2005. It was the sixth city in mainland China that opened up a metro system. As of December 2019 the city currently has 11 metro lines (Line 1, Line 2, Line 3, Line 4, Line 10, Line S1, Line S3, Line S6, Line S7, Line S8 and Line S9), with several extra ones (i.e. Line 5) under construction.

The Suzhou Rail Transit, also known as the Suzhou Metro, was opened in April 2012. As of October, 2022, it currently has five operational lines: Line 1, Line 2, Line 3, Line 4 and Line 5. It also has four other lines under construction (Line 6, Line 7, Line 8, Line S1) and 11 lines under planning (Lines 9, 10, 11 through 16, Line 18, Line 20, Line S4, Line S5). Currently under construction lines are expected to be operational by 2024 and planned lines are expected to be operational by 2035.

The Wuxi Metro was opened in July 2014. The system is currently composed of four operational lines by 2022: Line 1, Line 2, Line 3 and Line 4. It also has two other lines under construction: Line S1 and an extension of Line 4.

The Changzhou Metro was opened in September 2019. The system currently only has two lines operational, Line 1 and Line 2.

The Xuzhou Metro was opened in September 2019, a few days after the Changzhou Metro started operations. The system currently only has three lines operational, Line 1, Line 2 and Line 3.

The Nantong Metro was opened in November 2022. It has one operating line: Line 1 and another line under construction: Line 2.

The Huai&#x27;an Metro, also known as the Huai&#x27;an Rail System, began construction in November 2018. There are seven lines planned: Line 1, Line 2, Line 3, Line 4, Line 5, Line S1, and Line S2. It is expected to start operations before 2025.

==Culture==
The four mass migrations in the 4th, 8th, 12th and 14th centuries had been influential in shaping the regional culture of Jiangsu. According to dialects and the other factors, the province can be roughly segmented four major cultural subdivisions: Wu (), Jinling (), Huaiyang () and Xuhuai (), from southeast to northwest. The belts of transition blurred the boundaries.

Jiangsu is rich in cultural traditions. &quot;Kunqu&quot;, originating in Kunshan, is one of the most renowned and prestigious forms of Chinese opera. &quot;Pingtan&quot;, a form of storytelling accompanied by music, is also popular: it can be subdivided into types by origin: Suzhou Pingtan (of Suzhou), Yangzhou Pingtan (of Yangzhou), and Nanjing Pingtan (of Nanjing). Wuxi opera, a form of traditional Chinese opera, is popular in Wuxi, while Huaiju is popular further north, around Yancheng. Jiangsu cuisine is one of the eight great traditions of the cuisine of China.

Suzhou is also well known for its silk, Chinese embroidery, jasmine tea, stone bridges, pagodas, and classical gardens. Nearby Yixing is noted for its teaware while Yangzhou is known for its lacquerware and jadeware. Nanjing&#x27;s &quot;yunjin&quot; is a noted type of woven silk.

Since ancient times, south Jiangsu has been famed for its prosperity and opulence, and simply inserting south Jiangsu place names (Suzhou, Yangzhou, etc.) into poetry gave an effect of dreaminess, as was indeed done by many famous poets. In particular, the fame of Suzhou (as well as Hangzhou in neighbouring Zhejiang) has led to the popular saying: (&quot;above there is heaven; below there are Suzhou and Hangzhou&quot;), a saying that continues to be a source of pride for the people of these two still prosperous cities. Similarly, the prosperity of Yangzhou has led poets to dream of: (&quot;with a hundred thousand strings of coins wrapped around its waist, a crane landed in Yangzhou&quot;).

== Education and research ==
=== Higher education ===
As of 2022, Jiangsu hosts 168 institutions of higher education, ranking first of all Chinese provinces. There are two Project 985, 11 Project 211, and 16 Double First-Class Construction universities in the province. A combination of 93 members of Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chinese Academy of Engineering work in Jiangsu. As of 2023, four major cities in Jiangsu ranked in the world&#x27;s top 200 (Nanjing 6th, Suzhou 40th, Zhenjiang 166th and Wuxi 188th) cities by scientific research output, as tracked by the Nature Index.

<doc id="166415" wikidata="Q6510488" url="?curid=166415" title="Heat equation">
<text>In mathematics and physics, the heat equation is a parabolic partial differential equation. The theory of the heat equation was first developed by Joseph Fourier in 1822 for the purpose of modeling how a quantity such as heat diffuses through a given region. Since then, the heat equation and its variants have been found to be fundamental in many parts of both pure and applied mathematics.

== Definition ==
Given an open subset of and a subinterval of , one says that a function is a solution of the heat equation if
: formula_1
where denotes a general point of the domain. It is typical to refer to as time and as spatial variables, even in abstract contexts where these phrases fail to have their intuitive meaning. The collection of spatial variables is often referred to simply as . For any given value of , the right-hand side of the equation is the Laplacian of the function . As such, the heat equation is often written more compactly as
In physics and engineering contexts, especially in the context of diffusion through a medium, it is more common to fix a Cartesian coordinate system and then to consider the specific case of a function of three spatial variables and time variable . One then says that is a solution of the heat equation if
:formula_2
in which is a positive coefficient called the thermal diffusivity of the medium. In addition to other physical phenomena, this equation describes the flow of heat in a homogeneous and isotropic medium, with being the temperature at the point and time . If the medium is not homogeneous and isotropic, then would not be a fixed coefficient, and would instead depend on ; the equation would also have a slightly different form. In the physics and engineering literature, it is common to use to denote the Laplacian, rather than .

In mathematics as well as in physics and engineering, it is common to use Newton&#x27;s notation for time derivatives, so that formula_3 is used to denote , so the equation can be written

Note also that the ability to use either or to denote the Laplacian, without explicit reference to the spatial variables, is a reflection of the fact that the Laplacian is independent of the choice of coordinate system. In mathematical terms, one would say that the Laplacian is translationally and rotationally invariant. In fact, it is (loosely speaking) the simplest differential operator which has these symmetries. This can be taken as a significant (and purely mathematical) justification of the use of the Laplacian and of the heat equation in modeling any physical phenomena which are homogeneous and isotropic, of which heat diffusion is a principal example.

The &quot;diffusivity constant&quot;, , is often not present in mathematical studies of the heat equation, while its value can be very important in engineering. This is not a major difference, for the following reason. Let be a function with
:formula_4
Define a new function formula_5. Then, according to the chain rule, one has

Thus, there is a straightforward way of translating between solutions of the heat equation with a general value of and solutions of the heat equation with . As such, for the sake of mathematical analysis, it is often sufficient to only consider the case . 

Since formula_6 there is another option to define a formula_7 satisfying formula_8 as in () above by setting formula_9. Note that the two possible means of defining the new function formula_7 discussed here amount, in physical terms, to changing the unit of measure of time or the unit of measure of length.

=== Steady-state equation ===
The steady-state heat equation is by definition not dependent on time. In other words, it is assumed conditions exist such that:
: formula_11

This condition depends on the time constant and the amount of time passed since boundary conditions have been imposed. Thus, the condition is fulfilled in situations in which the &quot;time equilibrium constant is fast enough&quot; that the more complex time-dependent heat equation can be approximated by the steady-state case. Equivalently, the steady-state condition exists for all cases in which &quot;enough time has passed&quot; that the thermal field u no longer evolves in time.

In the steady-state case, a spatial thermal gradient may (or may not) exist, but if it does, it does not change in time. This equation therefore describes the end result in all thermal problems in which a source is switched on (for example, an engine started in an automobile), and enough time has passed for all permanent temperature gradients to establish themselves in space, after which these spatial gradients no longer change in time (as again, with an automobile in which the engine has been running for long enough). The other (trivial) solution is for all spatial temperature gradients to disappear as well, in which case the temperature become uniform in space, as well.

The equation is much simpler and can help to understand better the physics of the materials without focusing on the dynamic of the heat transport process. It is widely used for simple engineering problems assuming there is equilibrium of the temperature fields and heat transport, with time.

Steady-state condition:
: formula_11

The steady-state heat equation for a volume that contains a heat source (the inhomogeneous case), is the Poisson&#x27;s equation:
: formula_13
where &quot;u&quot; is the temperature, &quot;k&quot; is the thermal conductivity and &quot;q&quot; is the rate of heat generation per unit volume.

In electrostatics, this is equivalent to the case where the space under consideration contains an electrical charge.

The steady-state heat equation without a heat source within the volume (the homogeneous case) is the equation in electrostatics for a volume of free space that does not contain a charge. It is described by Laplace&#x27;s equation:
: formula_14

== Interpretation ==
Informally, the Laplacian operator gives the difference between the average value of a function in the neighborhood of a point, and its value at that point. Thus, if is the temperature, conveys if (and by how much) the material surrounding each point is hotter or colder, on the average, than the material at that point.

By the second law of thermodynamics, heat will flow from hotter bodies to adjacent colder bodies, in proportion to the difference of temperature and of the thermal conductivity of the material between them. When heat flows into (respectively, out of) a material, its temperature increases (respectively, decreases), in proportion to the amount of heat divided by the amount (mass) of material, with a proportionality factor called the specific heat capacity of the material.

By the combination of these observations, the heat equation says the rate formula_3 at which the material at a point will heat up (or cool down) is proportional to how much hotter (or cooler) the surrounding material is. The coefficient in the equation takes into account the thermal conductivity, specific heat, and density of the material.

=== Interpretation of the equation ===
The first half of the above physical thinking can be put into a mathematical form. The key is that, for any fixed , one has
: formula_16
where is the single-variable function denoting the &quot;average value&quot; of over the surface of the sphere of radius centered at ; it can be defined by
: formula_17
in which denotes the surface area of the unit ball in -dimensional Euclidean space. This formalizes the above statement that the value of at a point measures the difference between the value of and the value of at points nearby to , in the sense that the latter is encoded by the values of for small positive values of .

Following this observation, one may interpret the heat equation as imposing an &quot;infinitesimal averaging&quot; of a function. Given a solution of the heat equation, the value of for a small positive value of may be approximated as times the average value of the function over a sphere of very small radius centered at .

=== Character of the solutions ===


The heat equation implies that peaks (local maxima) of formula_18 will be gradually eroded down, while depressions (local minima) will be filled in. The value at some point will remain stable only as long as it is equal to the average value in its immediate surroundings. In particular, if the values in a neighborhood are very close to a linear function formula_19, then the value at the center of that neighborhood will not be changing at that time (that is, the derivative formula_3 will be zero).

A more subtle consequence is the maximum principle, that says that the maximum value of formula_18 in any region formula_22 of the medium will not exceed the maximum value that previously occurred in formula_22, unless it is on the boundary of formula_22. That is, the maximum temperature in a region formula_22 can increase only if heat comes in from outside formula_22. This is a property of parabolic partial differential equations and is not difficult to prove mathematically (see below).

Another interesting property is that even if formula_18 initially has a sharp jump (discontinuity) of value across some surface inside the medium, the jump is immediately smoothed out by a momentary, infinitesimally short but infinitely large rate of flow of heat through that surface. For example, if two isolated bodies, initially at uniform but different temperatures formula_28 and formula_29, are made to touch each other, the temperature at the point of contact will immediately assume some intermediate value, and a zone will develop around that point where formula_18 will gradually vary between formula_28 and formula_29.

If a certain amount of heat is suddenly applied to a point in the medium, it will spread out in all directions in the form of a diffusion wave. Unlike the elastic and electromagnetic waves, the speed of a diffusion wave drops with time: as it spreads over a larger region, the temperature gradient decreases, and therefore the heat flow decreases too.

== Specific examples ==

=== Heat flow in a uniform rod ===
For heat flow, the heat equation follows from the physical laws of conduction of heat and conservation of energy .

By Fourier&#x27;s law for an isotropic medium, the rate of flow of heat energy per unit area through a surface is proportional to the negative temperature gradient across it:
: formula_33
where formula_34 is the thermal conductivity of the material, formula_35 is the temperature, and formula_36 is a vector field that represents the magnitude and direction of the heat flow at the point formula_37 of space and time formula_38.

If the medium is a thin rod of uniform section and material, the position &quot;x&quot; is a single coordinate and the heat flow formula_39 towards formula_40 is a scalar field. The equation becomes
: formula_41

Let formula_42 be the internal energy (heat) per unit volume of the bar at each point and time. The rate of change in heat per unit volume in the material, formula_43, is proportional to the rate of change of its temperature, formula_44. That is,
: formula_45
where formula_46 is the specific heat capacity (at constant pressure, in case of a gas) and formula_47 is the density (mass per unit volume) of the material. This derivation assumes that the material has constant mass density and heat capacity through space as well as time.

Applying the law of conservation of energy to a small element of the medium centred at formula_40, one concludes that the rate at which heat changes at a given point formula_40 is equal to the derivative of the heat flow at that point (the difference between the heat flows either side of the particle). That is,
: formula_50

From the above equations it follows that
: formula_51
which is the heat equation in one dimension, with diffusivity coefficient
: formula_52

This quantity is called the thermal diffusivity of the medium.

==== Accounting for radiative loss ====
An additional term may be introduced into the equation to account for radiative loss of heat. According to the Stefan–Boltzmann law, this term is formula_53, where formula_54 is the temperature of the surroundings, and formula_55 is a coefficient that depends on the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and the emissivity of the material. The rate of change in internal energy becomes
: formula_56
and the equation for the evolution of formula_18 becomes
: formula_58

==== Non-uniform isotropic medium ====
Note that the state equation, given by the first law of thermodynamics (i.e. conservation of energy), is written in the following form (assuming no mass transfer or radiation). This form is more general and particularly useful to recognize which property (e.g. &quot;cp&quot; or &quot;formula_47&quot;) influences which term.
: formula_60
where formula_61 is the volumetric heat source.

=== Heat flow in non-homogeneous anisotropic media ===
In general, the study of heat conduction is based on several principles. Heat flow is a form of energy flow, and as such it is meaningful to speak of the time rate of flow of heat into a region of space.
* The time rate of heat flow into a region &quot;V&quot; is given by a time-dependent quantity &quot;q&quot;&quot;t&quot;(&quot;V&quot;). We assume &quot;q&quot; has a density &quot;Q&quot;, so that formula_62
* Heat flow is a time-dependent vector function H(&quot;x&quot;) characterized as follows: the time rate of heat flowing through an infinitesimal surface element with area &quot;dS&quot; and with unit normal vector n is formula_63 Thus the rate of heat flow into &quot;V&quot; is also given by the surface integral formula_64 where n(&quot;x&quot;) is the outward pointing normal vector at &quot;x&quot;.
* The Fourier law states that heat energy flow has the following linear dependence on the temperature gradient formula_65 where A(&quot;x&quot;) is a 3 × 3 real matrix that is symmetric and positive definite.
* By the divergence theorem, the previous surface integral for heat flow into &quot;V&quot; can be transformed into the volume integral formula_66
* The time rate of temperature change at &quot;x&quot; is proportional to the heat flowing into an infinitesimal volume element, where the constant of proportionality is dependent on a constant &quot;κ&quot; formula_67

Putting these equations together gives the general equation of heat flow:
: formula_68

Remarks
* The coefficient &quot;κ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is the inverse of specific heat of the substance at &quot;x&quot; × density of the substance at &quot;x&quot;: formula_69.
* In the case of an isotropic medium, the matrix A is a scalar matrix equal to thermal conductivity &quot;k&quot;.
* In the anisotropic case where the coefficient matrix A is not scalar and/or if it depends on &quot;x&quot;, then an explicit formula for the solution of the heat equation can seldom be written down, though it is usually possible to consider the associated abstract Cauchy problem and show that it is a well-posed problem and/or to show some qualitative properties (like preservation of positive initial data, infinite speed of propagation, convergence toward an equilibrium, smoothing properties). This is usually done by one-parameter semigroups theory: for instance, if &quot;A&quot; is a symmetric matrix, then the elliptic operator defined by formula_70 is self-adjoint and dissipative, thus by the spectral theorem it generates a one-parameter semigroup.

=== Three-dimensional problem ===
In the special cases of propagation of heat in an isotropic and medium in a 3-dimensional space, this equation is
: formula_71 formula_72
where:
* formula_73 is temperature as a function of space and time;
* formula_74 is the rate of change of temperature at a point over time;
* formula_75, formula_76, and formula_77 are the second spatial derivatives (&quot;thermal conductions&quot;) of temperature in the formula_78, formula_79, and formula_80 directions, respectively;
* formula_81 is the thermal diffusivity, a material-specific quantity depending on the &quot;thermal conductivity&quot; formula_82, the &quot;specific heat capacity&quot; formula_83, and the &quot;mass density&quot; formula_84.

The heat equation is a consequence of Fourier&#x27;s law of conduction (see heat conduction).

If the medium is not the whole space, in order to solve the heat equation uniquely we also need to specify boundary conditions for &quot;u&quot;. To determine uniqueness of solutions in the whole space it is necessary to assume additional conditions, for example an exponential bound on the growth of solutions or a sign condition (nonnegative solutions are unique by a result of David Widder).

Solutions of the heat equation are characterized by a gradual smoothing of the initial temperature distribution by the flow of heat from warmer to colder areas of an object. Generally, many different states and starting conditions will tend toward the same stable equilibrium. As a consequence, to reverse the solution and conclude something about earlier times or initial conditions from the present heat distribution is very inaccurate except over the shortest of time periods.

The heat equation is the prototypical example of a parabolic partial differential equation.

Using the Laplace operator, the heat equation can be simplified, and generalized to similar equations over spaces of arbitrary number of dimensions, as
: formula_85
where the Laplace operator, Δ or ∇2, the divergence of the gradient, is taken in the spatial variables.

The heat equation governs heat diffusion, as well as other diffusive processes, such as particle diffusion or the propagation of action potential in nerve cells. Although they are not diffusive in nature, some quantum mechanics problems are also governed by a mathematical analog of the heat equation (see below). It also can be used to model some phenomena arising in finance, like the Black–Scholes or the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. The equation, and various non-linear analogues, has also been used in image analysis.

The heat equation is, technically, in violation of special relativity, because its solutions involve instantaneous propagation of a disturbance. The part of the disturbance outside the forward light cone can usually be safely neglected, but if it is necessary to develop a reasonable speed for the transmission of heat, a hyperbolic problem should be considered instead – like a partial differential equation involving a second-order time derivative. Some models of nonlinear heat conduction (which are also parabolic equations) have solutions with finite heat transmission speed.

=== Internal heat generation ===
The function &quot;u&quot; above represents temperature of a body. Alternatively, it is sometimes convenient to change units and represent &quot;u&quot; as the heat density of a medium. Since heat density is proportional to temperature in a homogeneous medium, the heat equation is still obeyed in the new units.

Suppose that a body obeys the heat equation and, in addition, generates its own heat per unit volume (e.g., in watts/litre - W/L) at a rate given by a known function &quot;q&quot; varying in space and time. Then the heat per unit volume &quot;u&quot; satisfies an equation
: formula_86

For example, a tungsten light bulb filament generates heat, so it would have a positive nonzero value for &quot;q&quot; when turned on. While the light is turned off, the value of &quot;q&quot; for the tungsten filament would be zero.

== Solving the heat equation using Fourier series ==

The following solution technique for the heat equation was proposed by Joseph Fourier in his treatise &quot;Théorie analytique de la chaleur&quot;, published in 1822. Consider the heat equation for one space variable. This could be used to model heat conduction in a rod. The equation is

where &quot;u&quot; = &quot;u&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;t&quot;) is a function of two variables &quot;x&quot; and &quot;t&quot;. Here 
* &quot;x&quot; is the space variable, so &quot;x&quot; ∈ [0, &quot;L&quot;], where &quot;L&quot; is the length of the rod.
* &quot;t&quot; is the time variable, so &quot;t&quot; ≥ 0.

We assume the initial condition

where the function &quot;f&quot; is given, and the boundary conditions
Let us attempt to find a solution of that is not identically zero satisfying the boundary conditions but with the following property: &quot;u&quot; is a product in which the dependence of &quot;u&quot; on &quot;x&quot;, &quot;t&quot; is separated, that is:
This solution technique is called separation of variables. Substituting &quot;u&quot; back into equation ,
: formula_87

Since the right hand side depends only on &quot;x&quot; and the left hand side only on &quot;t&quot;, both sides are equal to some constant value −&quot;λ&quot;. Thus:

and
We will now show that nontrivial solutions for for values of &quot;λ&quot; ≤ 0 cannot occur:
# Suppose that &quot;λ&quot; &lt; 0. Then there exist real numbers &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot; such that formula_88 From we get &quot;X&quot;(0) = 0 = &quot;X&quot;(&quot;L&quot;) and therefore &quot;B&quot; = 0 = &quot;C&quot; which implies &quot;u&quot; is identically 0.
# Suppose that &quot;λ&quot; = 0. Then there exist real numbers &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot; such that &quot;X&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;Bx&quot; + &quot;C&quot;. From equation we conclude in the same manner as in 1 that &quot;u&quot; is identically 0.
# Therefore, it must be the case that &quot;λ&quot; &gt; 0. Then there exist real numbers &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot; such that formula_89 and formula_90 From we get &quot;C&quot; = 0 and that for some positive integer &quot;n&quot;, formula_91

This solves the heat equation in the special case that the dependence of &quot;u&quot; has the special form .

In general, the sum of solutions to that satisfy the boundary conditions also satisfies and . We can show that the solution to , and is given by
: formula_92
where
: formula_93

=== Generalizing the solution technique ===
The solution technique used above can be greatly extended to many other types of equations. The idea is that the operator &quot;uxx&quot; with the zero boundary conditions can be represented in terms of its eigenfunctions. This leads naturally to one of the basic ideas of the spectral theory of linear self-adjoint operators.

Consider the linear operator Δ&quot;u&quot; = &quot;uxx&quot;. The infinite sequence of functions
: formula_94
for &quot;n&quot; ≥ 1 are eigenfunctions of Δ. Indeed,
: formula_95

Moreover, any eigenfunction &quot;f&quot; of Δ with the boundary conditions &quot;f&quot;(0) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;L&quot;) = 0 is of the form &quot;e&quot;&quot;n&quot; for some &quot;n&quot; ≥ 1. The functions &quot;e&quot;&quot;n&quot; for &quot;n&quot; ≥ 1 form an orthonormal sequence with respect to a certain inner product on the space of real-valued functions on [0, &quot;L&quot;]. This means
: formula_96

Finally, the sequence {&quot;e&quot;&quot;n&quot;}&quot;n&quot; ∈ N spans a dense linear subspace of &quot;L&quot;2((0, &quot;L&quot;)). This shows that in effect we have diagonalized the operator Δ.

=== Mean-value property ===
Solutions of the heat equations 
: formula_97
satisfy a mean-value property analogous to the mean-value properties of harmonic functions, solutions of 
: formula_98
though a bit more complicated. Precisely, if &quot;u&quot; solves 
: formula_97
and 
: formula_100
then
: formula_101
where &quot;Eλ&quot; is a &quot;heat-ball&quot;, that is a super-level set of the fundamental solution of the heat equation:
: formula_102
: formula_103
Notice that 
: formula_104
as &quot;λ&quot; → ∞ so the above formula holds for any (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;t&quot;) in the (open) set dom(&quot;u&quot;) for &quot;λ&quot; large enough.

== Fundamental solutions ==

A fundamental solution of the heat equation is a solution that corresponds to the initial condition of an initial point source of heat at a known position. These can be used to find a general solution of the heat equation over certain domains (see, for instance, ).

In one variable, the Green&#x27;s function is a solution of the initial value problem (by Duhamel&#x27;s principle, equivalent to the definition of Green&#x27;s function as one with a delta function as solution to the first equation)
: formula_105
where &quot;formula_106&quot; is the Dirac delta function. The fundamental solution to this problem is given by the heat kernel
: formula_107

One can obtain the general solution of the one variable heat equation with initial condition &quot;u&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, 0) = &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) for −∞ &lt; &quot;x&quot; &lt; ∞ and 0 &lt; &quot;t&quot; &lt; ∞ by applying a convolution:
: formula_108

In several spatial variables, the fundamental solution solves the analogous problem
: formula_109

The &quot;n&quot;-variable fundamental solution is the product of the fundamental solutions in each variable; i.e.,
: formula_110

The general solution of the heat equation on R&quot;n&quot; is then obtained by a convolution, so that to solve the initial value problem with &quot;u&quot;(x, 0) = &quot;g&quot;(x), one has
: formula_111

The general problem on a domain Ω in R&quot;n&quot; is
: formula_112
with either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary data. A Green&#x27;s function always exists, but unless the domain Ω can be readily decomposed into one-variable problems (see below), it may not be possible to write it down explicitly. Other methods for obtaining Green&#x27;s functions include the method of images, separation of variables, and Laplace transforms (Cole, 2011). 

=== Some Green&#x27;s function solutions in 1D ===
A variety of elementary Green&#x27;s function solutions in one-dimension are recorded here; many others are available elsewhere. In some of these, the spatial domain is (−∞,∞). In others, it is the semi-infinite interval (0,∞) with either Neumann or Dirichlet boundary conditions. One further variation is that some of these solve the inhomogeneous equation
: formula_113
where &quot;f&quot; is some given function of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;t&quot;.

==== Homogeneous heat equation ====
; Initial value problem on (−∞,∞) :

&quot;Comment&quot;. This solution is the convolution with respect to the variable &quot;x&quot; of the fundamental solution
: formula_116
and the function &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;). (The Green&#x27;s function number of the fundamental solution is X00.)

Therefore, according to the general properties of the convolution with respect to differentiation, &quot;u&quot; = &quot;g&quot; ∗ Φ is a solution of the same heat equation, for

For instance, if &quot;g&quot; is assumed bounded and continuous on R then converges uniformly to &quot;g&quot; as &quot;t&quot; → 0, meaning that &quot;u&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;t&quot;) is continuous on with

Correspondingly, the solution of the initial value problem on (−∞,∞) is an odd function with respect to the variable &quot;x&quot; for all values of &quot;t&quot;, and in particular it satisfies the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions &quot;u&quot;(0, &quot;t&quot;) = 0.
The Green&#x27;s function number of this solution is X10.

&quot;Comment.&quot; This solution is obtained from the first solution formula as applied to the data &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) suitably extended to R so as to be an even function, that is, letting &quot;g&quot;(−&quot;x&quot;) := &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) for all &quot;x&quot;. Correspondingly, the solution of the initial value problem on R is an even function with respect to the variable &quot;x&quot; for all values of &quot;t&quot; &gt; 0, and in particular, being smooth, it satisfies the homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions &quot;ux&quot;(0, &quot;t&quot;) = 0. The Green&#x27;s function number of this solution is X20.

: formula_125

&quot;Comment&quot;. This solution is the convolution with respect to the variable &quot;t&quot; of

: formula_127
the function &quot;ψ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;t&quot;) is also a solution of the same heat equation, and so is &quot;u&quot; := &quot;ψ&quot; ∗ &quot;h&quot;, thanks to general properties of the convolution with respect to differentiation. Moreover,

: formula_129
so that, by general facts about approximation to the identity, &quot;ψ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, ⋅) ∗ &quot;h&quot; → &quot;h&quot; as &quot;x&quot; → 0 in various senses, according to the specific &quot;h&quot;. For instance, if &quot;h&quot; is assumed continuous on R with support in [0, ∞) then &quot;ψ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, ⋅) ∗ &quot;h&quot; converges uniformly on compacta to &quot;h&quot; as &quot;x&quot; → 0, meaning that &quot;u&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;t&quot;) is continuous on with 
==== Inhomogeneous heat equation ====

&quot;Comment&quot;. This solution is the convolution in R2, that is with respect to both the variables &quot;x&quot; and &quot;t&quot;, of the fundamental solution

and the function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;t&quot;), both meant as defined on the whole R2 and identically 0 for all &quot;t&quot; → 0. One verifies that
: formula_131
which expressed in the language of distributions becomes

where the distribution δ is the Dirac&#x27;s delta function, that is the evaluation at 0.

; Problem on (0,∞) with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions and initial conditions:

&quot;Comment&quot;. This solution is obtained from the preceding formula as applied to the data &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;t&quot;) suitably extended to R × [0,∞), so as to be an odd function of the variable &quot;x&quot;, that is, letting &quot;f&quot;(−&quot;x&quot;, &quot;t&quot;) := −&quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;t&quot;) for all &quot;x&quot; and &quot;t&quot;. Correspondingly, the solution of the inhomogeneous problem on (−∞,∞) is an odd function with respect to the variable &quot;x&quot; for all values of &quot;t&quot;, and in particular it satisfies the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions &quot;u&quot;(0, &quot;t&quot;) = 0.

; Problem on (0,∞) with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions and initial conditions :
: formula_135
: formula_136

&quot;Comment&quot;. This solution is obtained from the first formula as applied to the data &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;t&quot;) suitably extended to R × [0,∞), so as to be an even function of the variable &quot;x&quot;, that is, letting &quot;f&quot;(−&quot;x&quot;, &quot;t&quot;) := &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;t&quot;) for all &quot;x&quot; and &quot;t&quot;. Correspondingly, the solution of the inhomogeneous problem on (−∞,∞) is an even function with respect to the variable &quot;x&quot; for all values of &quot;t&quot;, and in particular, being a smooth function, it satisfies the homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions &quot;ux&quot;(0, &quot;t&quot;) = 0.

==== Examples ====
Since the heat equation is linear, solutions of other combinations of boundary conditions, inhomogeneous term, and initial conditions can be found by taking an appropriate linear combination of the above Green&#x27;s function solutions.

For example, to solve

let &quot;u&quot; = &quot;w&quot; + &quot;v&quot; where &quot;w&quot; and &quot;v&quot; solve the problems
: formula_138

Similarly, to solve

let &quot;u&quot; = &quot;w&quot; + &quot;v&quot; + &quot;r&quot; where &quot;w&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, and &quot;r&quot; solve the problems

== Applications ==

As the prototypical parabolic partial differential equation, the heat equation is among the most widely studied topics in pure mathematics, and its analysis is regarded as fundamental to the broader field of partial differential equations. The heat equation can also be considered on Riemannian manifolds, leading to many geometric applications. Following work of Subbaramiah Minakshisundaram and Åke Pleijel, the heat equation is closely related with spectral geometry. A seminal nonlinear variant of the heat equation was introduced to differential geometry by James Eells and Joseph Sampson in 1964, inspiring the introduction of the Ricci flow by Richard Hamilton in 1982 and culminating in the proof of the Poincaré conjecture by Grigori Perelman in 2003. Certain solutions of the heat equation known as heat kernels provide subtle information about the region on which they are defined, as exemplified through their application to the Atiyah–Singer index theorem.

The heat equation, along with variants thereof, is also important in many fields of science and applied mathematics. In probability theory, the heat equation is connected with the study of random walks and Brownian motion via the Fokker–Planck equation. The Black–Scholes equation of financial mathematics is a small variant of the heat equation, and the Schrödinger equation of quantum mechanics can be regarded as a heat equation in imaginary time. In image analysis, the heat equation is sometimes used to resolve pixelation and to identify edges. Following Robert Richtmyer and John von Neumann&#x27;s introduction of artificial viscosity methods, solutions of heat equations have been useful in the mathematical formulation of hydrodynamical shocks. Solutions of the heat equation have also been given much attention in the numerical analysis literature, beginning in the 1950s with work of Jim Douglas, D.W. Peaceman, and Henry Rachford Jr.

=== Particle diffusion ===
One can model particle diffusion by an equation involving either: 
* the volumetric concentration of particles, denoted &quot;c&quot;, in the case of collective diffusion of a large number of particles, or
* the probability density function associated with the position of a single particle, denoted &quot;P&quot;.

In either case, one uses the heat equation
: formula_141
or
: formula_142

Both &quot;c&quot; and &quot;P&quot; are functions of position and time. &quot;D&quot; is the diffusion coefficient that controls the speed of the diffusive process, and is typically expressed in meters squared over second. If the diffusion coefficient &quot;D&quot; is not constant, but depends on the concentration &quot;c&quot; (or &quot;P&quot; in the second case), then one gets the nonlinear diffusion equation.

=== Brownian motion ===
Let the stochastic process formula_143 be the solution to the stochastic differential equation
: formula_144
where formula_145 is the Wiener process (standard Brownian motion). The probability density function of formula_143 is given at any time formula_38 by
: formula_148
which is the solution to the initial value problem
: formula_149
where formula_106 is the Dirac delta function.

=== Schrödinger equation for a free particle ===
With a simple division, the Schrödinger equation for a single particle of mass &quot;m&quot; in the absence of any applied force field can be rewritten in the following way:
: formula_151,
where &quot;i&quot; is the imaginary unit, &quot;ħ&quot; is the reduced Planck constant, and &quot;ψ&quot; is the wave function of the particle.

This equation is formally similar to the particle diffusion equation, which one obtains through the following transformation:
: formula_152

Applying this transformation to the expressions of the Green functions determined in the case of particle diffusion yields the Green functions of the Schrödinger equation, which in turn can be used to obtain the wave function at any time through an integral on the wave function at &quot;t&quot; = 0:
: formula_153
with
: formula_154

Remark: this analogy between quantum mechanics and diffusion is a purely formal one. Physically, the evolution of the wave function satisfying Schrödinger&#x27;s equation might have an origin other than diffusion.

=== Thermal diffusivity in polymers ===
A direct practical application of the heat equation, in conjunction with Fourier theory, in spherical coordinates, is the prediction of thermal transfer profiles and the measurement of the thermal diffusivity in polymers (Unsworth and Duarte). This dual theoretical-experimental method is applicable to rubber, various other polymeric materials of practical interest, and microfluids. These authors derived an expression for the temperature at the center of a sphere 
: formula_155
where is the initial temperature of the sphere and the temperature at the surface of the sphere, of radius . This equation has also found applications in protein energy transfer and thermal modeling in biophysics.

=== Financial Mathematics ===

The heat equation arises in a number of phenomena and is often used in financial mathematics in the modeling of options. The Black–Scholes option pricing model&#x27;s differential equation can be transformed into the heat equation allowing relatively easy solutions from a familiar body of mathematics. Many of the extensions to the simple option models do not have closed form solutions and thus must be solved numerically to obtain a modeled option price. The equation describing pressure diffusion in a porous medium is identical in form with the heat equation. Diffusion problems dealing with Dirichlet, Neumann and Robin boundary conditions have closed form analytic solutions .

=== Image Analysis ===
The heat equation is also widely used in image analysis and in machine learning as the driving theory behind scale-space or graph Laplacian methods. The heat equation can be efficiently solved numerically using the implicit Crank–Nicolson method of . This method can be extended to many of the models with no closed form solution, see for instance .

=== Riemannian geometry ===
An abstract form of heat equation on manifolds provides a major approach to the Atiyah–Singer index theorem, and has led to much further work on heat equations in Riemannian geometry.

<text>Omar Nelson Bradley (12 February 1893 – 8 April 1981) was a senior officer of the United States Army during and after World War II, rising to the rank of General of the Army. He was the first chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and oversaw the U.S. military&#x27;s policy-making in the Korean War.

Born in Randolph County, Missouri, he worked as a boilermaker before entering the United States Military Academy at West Point. He graduated from the academy in 1915 alongside Dwight D. Eisenhower as part of &quot;the class the stars fell on.&quot; During World War I, he guarded copper mines in Montana. After the war, he taught at West Point and served in other roles before taking a position at the War Department under General George Marshall. In 1941, he became commander of the United States Army Infantry School.

After the U.S. entry into World War II, he oversaw the transformation of the 82nd Infantry Division into the first American airborne division. He received his first front-line command in Operation Torch, serving under General George S. Patton in North Africa. After Patton was reassigned, Bradley commanded II Corps in the Tunisia Campaign and the Allied invasion of Sicily. He commanded the First United States Army during the Invasion of Normandy. After the breakout from Normandy, he took command of the Twelfth United States Army Group, which ultimately comprised forty-three divisions and 1.3 million men, the largest body of American soldiers ever to serve under a single field commander.

After the war, Bradley headed the Veterans Administration. He was appointed as Chief of Staff of the United States Army in 1948 and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1949. In 1950, he was promoted to the rank of General of the Army, becoming the last of the nine individuals promoted to five-star rank in the United States Armed Forces. He was the senior military commander at the start of the Korean War, and supported President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s wartime policy of containment. He was instrumental in persuading Truman to dismiss General Douglas MacArthur in 1951 after MacArthur resisted administration attempts to scale back the war&#x27;s strategic objectives. Bradley left active duty in 1953 (although remaining on &quot;active retirement&quot; for the next 27 years). He continued to serve in public and business roles until his death in 1981 at age 88.

==Early life and education==

Omar Nelson Bradley, the son of schoolteacher John Smith Bradley (1868–1908) and his wife Mary Elizabeth (née Hubbard) (1875–1931), was born into poverty in rural Randolph County, Missouri, near Moberly. Bradley was named after Omar D. Gray, a local newspaper editor admired by his father, and a local physician, James Nelson. He was of British ancestry, his ancestors having emigrated from Great Britain to Kentucky in the mid-1700s. He attended at least eight country schools where his father taught. The elder Bradley never earned more than $40 a month in his lifetime, while he was a schoolteacher and sharecropper, the latter with the aid of all the family. They never owned a wagon, a horse, or a mule. When Omar was 15, his father died; he credited his father with passing on to him his love of books, baseball and shooting.

His mother moved with him to Moberly, where she remarried. Bradley graduated from Moberly High School in 1910. He was an outstanding student and athlete who was chosen captain of both the baseball and track teams.

Bradley was working as a 17-cents-an-hour (equal 
to $ today) boilermaker at the Wabash Railroad when he was encouraged by his Sunday school teacher at Central Christian Church in Moberly to take the entrance examination for the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, New York. Bradley had been saving his money to enter the University of Missouri in Columbia, where he intended to study law. He finished second in the West Point placement exams, held at Jefferson Barracks Military Post in St. Louis, Missouri. The first-place winner was unable to accept the Congressional appointment, however, and the nomination was passed to Bradley in August 1911.

While Bradley was attending the academy, his devotion to sports prevented him from excelling academically; but he still ranked 44th in a class of 164. He was a baseball star and often played on semi-pro teams for no remuneration (to ensure his eligibility as an amateur to represent the academy). He was considered one of the most outstanding college players in the nation during his junior and senior seasons at West Point, noted as both a power hitter and an outfielder, with one of the best arms in his day. He rejected multiple offers to play professional baseball, choosing to pursue his Army career.

While stationed at West Point as an instructor, in 1923 Bradley became a Freemason. He became a member of the West Point Lodge #877, Highland Falls, New York and continued with them until his death.

Bradley married Mary Quayle (1892–1965), who had grown up across the street from him in Moberly. Her father, the town&#x27;s popular police chief, had died when she was young. The pair attended Central Christian Church and Moberly High School together. On the cover of the 1910 Moberly High School yearbook, &quot;The Salutar,&quot; they were shown across from each other, although they did not date during those years. His picture bore the description &quot;calculative&quot; and hers &quot;linguistic.&quot; She earned a college degree in education.

==West Point and early military career==
At West Point, Bradley played three years of varsity baseball including the 1914 team. Every player on that team who remained in the army ultimately became a general. Bradley graduated from West Point in 1915 as part of a class that produced many future generals, and which military historians have called &quot;the class the stars fell on&quot;. Bradley&#x27;s cullum number is 5356. There were ultimately 59 future general officers in that graduating class, among whom Bradley and Dwight D. Eisenhower attained the rank of General of the Army. Eisenhower was elected in 1952 in a landslide victory as 34th President of the United States. Among the numerous others who became generals were Joseph T. McNarney, Henry Aurand, James Van Fleet, Stafford LeRoy Irwin, John W. Leonard, Joseph May Swing, Paul J. Mueller, Charles W. Ryder, Leland Hobbs, Vernon Prichard, John B. Wogan, Roscoe B. Woodruff, John French Conklin, Walter W. Hess, and Edwin A. Zundel.

Bradley was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Infantry Branch of the United States Army and was first assigned to the 14th Infantry Regiment. 
 He served on the Mexico–United States border in 1915, defending it from incursions due to the Mexican civil war. On 1 July 1916 he was promoted to first lieutenant.

When the United States entered World War I in April 1917 (see the American entry into World War I), he was promoted to captain on 15 May and sent to guard the Butte, Montana copper mines, considered of strategic importance. Bradley was promoted to the temporary rank of major in June 1918 and assigned to command the second battalion of the 14th Infantry, joined the 19th Division in August 1918, which was scheduled for European deployment, but the influenza pandemic and the armistice with Germany on 11 November 1918, that fall intervened.

From September 1919 until September 1920, Bradley served as assistant professor of military science at South Dakota State College (now University) in Brookings, South Dakota.

During the difficult period between the wars, he taught and studied. From 1920 to 1924, Bradley taught mathematics at West Point. He was promoted to major in 1924 and took the advanced infantry course at Fort Benning, Georgia. After brief duty in Hawaii, Bradley was selected to study at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas in 1928–29. Upon graduating, he served as an instructor in tactics at the U.S. Army Infantry School. While Bradley was serving in this assignment, the school&#x27;s assistant commandant, Lieutenant Colonel George C. Marshall, described Bradley as &quot;quiet, unassuming, capable, with sound common sense. Absolute dependability. Give him a job and forget it.&quot;

From 1929, Bradley taught again at West Point, studying at the U.S. Army War College in 1934. Bradley was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 26 June 1936 and worked at the War Department; after 1938 he was directly reporting to U.S. Army Chief of Staff Marshall.

On 20 February 1941, Bradley was promoted to the (wartime) temporary rank of brigadier general (bypassing the rank of colonel.) (This rank was made permanent by the army in September 1943). The temporary rank was conferred to allow him to command the U.S. Army Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia (he was among the first from his class to reach even a temporary rank of general officer; first was his West Point classmate Luis Esteves, who was promoted Brigadier general in October 1940). While serving in this position he played a key part in developing the officer candidate school model.

Almost a year later, on 15 February 1942, over two months after the American entry into World War II, Bradley was made a temporary major general (a rank made permanent in September 1944) and soon took command of the 82nd Infantry Division (soon to be redesignated as the 82nd Airborne Division) before succeeding Major General James Garesche Ord as commander of the 28th Infantry Division in June.

==Louisiana Maneuvers==
The Louisiana Maneuvers were a series of U.S. Army exercises held around Northern and Western-Central Louisiana, including Fort Polk, Camp Claiborne and Camp Livingston, in 1940 and 1941. The exercises, which involved some 400,000 troops, were designed to evaluate U.S. training, logistics, doctrine, and commanders. Overall, headquarters were in the Bentley Hotel in Alexandria.

Many Army officers present at the maneuvers later rose to very senior roles in World War II, including Bradley, Mark Clark, Dwight Eisenhower, Walter Krueger, Lesley J. McNair and George Patton.

Lieutenant Colonel Bradley was assigned to General Headquarters during the Louisiana Maneuvers but as a courier and observer in the field, he gained invaluable experience for the future. Colonel Bradley assisted in the planning of the maneuvers, and kept the General Staff in Washington, D.C. abreast of the training that was occurring during the Louisiana Maneuvers.

Bradley later said that Louisianans welcomed the soldiers with open arms. Some soldiers even slept in some of the residents&#x27; houses. Bradley said it was so crowded in those houses sometimes when the soldiers were sleeping, there would hardly be any walking room. Bradley also said a few of the troops were disrespectful towards the residents&#x27; land and crops, and would tear down crops for extra food. However, for the most part, residents and soldiers established good relations.

==World War II==
Bradley&#x27;s personal experiences in the war are documented in his award-winning book &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Story,&quot; published by Henry Holt &amp; Co. in 1951. It was re-released by The Modern Library in 1999. The book is based on an extensive diary maintained by his aide-de-camp, Chester B. Hansen, who ghost-wrote the book using the diary; Hansen&#x27;s original diary is maintained by the U. S. Army Heritage and Education Center, at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania.

On 25 March 1942, Bradley, recently promoted to major general, assumed command of the newly activated 82nd Infantry Division. Bradley oversaw the division&#x27;s transformation into the first American airborne division and took parachute training. In August the division was re-designated as the 82nd Airborne Division and Bradley relinquished command to Major General Matthew Ridgway, who had been his assistant division commander (ADC).

Bradley then took command of the 28th Infantry Division, which was a National Guard division with soldiers mostly from the state of Pennsylvania.

===North Africa and Sicily===
Bradley did not receive a front-line command until early 1943, after Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North Africa. He had been given VIII Corps after being succeeded by Lloyd D. Brown as commander of the 28th Division, but instead was sent to North Africa to be Eisenhower&#x27;s front-line troubleshooter. At Bradley&#x27;s suggestion, II Corps, which had just suffered a great defeat at the Kasserine Pass, was overhauled from top to bottom, and Eisenhower, now the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied forces in North Africa, installed Major General George S. Patton as corps commander in March 1943. Patton requested Bradley as his deputy, but Bradley retained the right to represent Eisenhower as well.

Bradley succeeded Patton as commander of II Corps in April and directed it in the final Tunisian battles of April and May, with Bizerte falling to elements of II Corps on 7 May 1943. The campaign as a whole ended six days later, and with it came the surrender of over 200,000 Axis Germans and Italians.

As a result of his excellent performance in the campaign, Bradley was promoted to Brevet lieutenant general on 2 June 1943 and continued to command II Corps in the Allied invasion of Sicily (codenamed Operation Husky). The campaign lasted only a few weeks and, as he had in Tunisia, Bradley continued to impress his superiors, Eisenhower most notably, who wrote to Marshall about Bradley:

===Normandy 1944===
On 10 September 1943, Bradley transferred to London as commander in chief of the American ground forces preparing to invade France in the spring of 1944. For D-Day, Bradley was chosen to command the US First Army, which, alongside the British Second Army, commanded by Lieutenant-General Miles Dempsey, made up the 21st Army Group, commanded by General Sir Bernard Montgomery.

On 10 June 1944, four days after the initial Normandy landings, Bradley and his staff debarked to establish a headquarters ashore. During Operation Overlord, he commanded three corps directed at the two American invasion targets, Utah Beach and Omaha Beach. During July he inspected the modifications made by Curtis G. Culin to Sherman tanks, that led to the Rhino tank. Later in July, he planned Operation Cobra, the beginning of the breakout from the Normandy beachhead. Operation Cobra called for the use of strategic bombers using huge bomb loads to attack German defensive lines. After several postponements due to weather, the operation began on 25 July 1944, with a short, very intensive bombardment with lighter explosives, designed so as not to create more rubble and craters that would slow Allied progress. Bradley was horrified when 77 planes bombed short and dropped bombs on their own troops, including Lieutenant General Lesley J. McNair:

However, the bombing was successful in knocking out the enemy communication system, rendering German troops confused and ineffective, and opened the way for the ground offensive by attacking infantry. Bradley sent in three infantry divisions—the 9th, 4th and 30th—to move in close behind the bombing. The infantry succeeded in cracking the German defenses, opening the way for advances by armored forces commanded by Patton to sweep around the German lines.

As the build-up continued in Normandy, the Third Army was formed under Patton, Bradley&#x27;s former commander, while Lieutenant General Courtney Hodges, whom Bradley had succeeded as Commandant of the Infantry School, succeeded Bradley in command of the First Army; together, they made up Bradley&#x27;s new command, the 12th Army Group. By August, the 12th Army Group had swollen to over 900,000 men and ultimately consisted of four field armies. It was the largest group of American soldiers to ever serve under one field commander.

===Falaise pocket===
Hitler&#x27;s refusal to allow his army to flee the rapidly advancing Allied pincer movement created an opportunity to trap an entire German Army Group in northern France. After the German attempt to split the US armies at Mortain (Operation Lüttich), Bradley&#x27;s Army Group and XV Corps became the southern pincer in forming the &quot;Falaise pocket&quot;, trapping the German Seventh Army and Fifth Panzer Army in Normandy. The northern pincer was formed of Canadian forces, part of British General Sir Bernard Montgomery&#x27;s 21st Army Group. On 13 August 1944, concerned that American troops would clash with Canadian forces advancing from the north-west, Bradley overrode Patton&#x27;s orders for a further push north towards Falaise, while ordering Major General Wade H. Haislip&#x27;s XV Corps to &quot;concentrate for operations in another direction&quot;. Any American troops in the vicinity of Argentan were ordered to withdraw. This order halted the southern pincer movement of Haislip&#x27;s XV Corps. Though Patton protested the order, he obeyed it, leaving an exit—a &quot;trap with a gap&quot;—for the remaining German forces. Around 20,000–50,000 German troops (leaving almost all of their heavy material) escaped through the gap, avoiding encirclement and almost certain destruction. They would be reorganized and rearmed in time to slow the Allied advance into the Netherlands and Germany. Most of the blame for this outcome has been placed on Bradley. Bradley had incorrectly assumed, based on Ultra decoding transcripts, that most of the Germans had already escaped encirclement, and he feared a German counterattack as well as possible friendly fire casualties. Though admitting that a mistake had been made, Bradley placed the blame on General Montgomery for moving the British and Commonwealth troops too slowly, though the latter were in direct contact with a large number of SS Panzer, paratroopers, and other elite German forces.

===Germany===
The American forces reached the &quot;Siegfried Line&quot; or &quot;Westwall&quot; in late September. The success of the advance had taken the Allied high command by surprise. They had expected the German &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; to make stands on the natural defensive lines provided by the French rivers, and had not prepared the logistics for the much deeper advance of the Allied armies, so fuel ran short.


Eisenhower faced a decision on strategy. Bradley favored an advance into the Saarland, or possibly a two-thrust assault on both the Saarland and the Ruhr Area. Montgomery argued for a narrow thrust across the Lower Rhine, preferably with all Allied ground forces under his personal command as they had been in the early months of the Normandy campaign, into the open country beyond and then to the northern flank into the Ruhr, thus avoiding the Siegfried Line. Although Montgomery was not permitted to launch an offensive on the scale he had wanted, George Marshall and Hap Arnold were eager to use the First Allied Airborne Army to cross the Rhine, so Eisenhower agreed to Operation Market Garden. Bradley opposed the operation, and bitterly protested to Eisenhower the priority of supplies given to Montgomery, but Eisenhower, mindful of British public opinion regarding damage from V-1 missile launches in the north, refused to make any changes.

Bradley&#x27;s Army Group now covered a very wide front in hilly country, from the Netherlands to Lorraine. Despite having the largest concentration of Allied army forces, Bradley faced difficulties in prosecuting a successful broad-front offensive in difficult country with a skilled enemy. General Bradley and his First Army commander, General Courtney Hodges, eventually decided to attack through a corridor known as the Aachen Gap towards the German township of Schmidt. The only nearby military objectives were the Roer River flood control dams, but these were not mentioned in contemporary plans and documents. Bradley and Hodges&#x27; original objective may have been to outflank German forces and prevent them from reinforcing their units further north in the Battle of Aachen. After the war, Bradley would cite the Roer dams as the objective. Since the Germans held the dams, they could also unleash millions of gallons of water into the path of advance. The campaign&#x27;s confused objectives, combined with poor intelligence, resulted in the costly series of battles known as the Battle of Hurtgen Forest, which cost some 33,000 American casualties. At the end of the fighting in the Hurtgen, German forces remained in control of the Roer dams in what has been described as &quot;the most ineptly fought series of battles of the war in the west.&quot; Further south, Patton&#x27;s Third Army, which had been advancing with great speed, was faced with last priority (behind the U.S. First and Ninth Armies) for supplies, gasoline and ammunition. As a result, the Third Army lost momentum as German resistance stiffened around the extensive defenses surrounding the city of Metz. While Bradley focused on these two campaigns, the Germans were in the process of assembling troops and materiel for a surprise winter offensive.

===Battle of the Bulge===
Bradley&#x27;s command took the initial brunt of what would become the Battle of the Bulge. For logistical and command reasons, General Eisenhower decided to place Bradley&#x27;s First and Ninth Armies under the temporary command of Field Marshal Montgomery&#x27;s 21st Army Group on the northern flank of the Bulge. Bradley was incensed, and began shouting at Eisenhower: &quot;By God, Ike, I cannot be responsible to the American people if you do this. I resign.&quot; Eisenhower turned red, took a breath and replied evenly, &quot;Brad, I—not you—am responsible to the American people. Your resignation therefore means absolutely nothing.&quot; Bradley paused, made one more protest, then fell silent as Eisenhower concluded, &quot;Well, Brad, those are my orders.&quot;

At least one historian has attributed Eisenhower&#x27;s support for Bradley&#x27;s subsequent promotion to (temporary) four-star general (March 1945, not made permanent until January 1949) to, in part, a desire to compensate him for the way in which he had been sidelined during the Battle of the Bulge. Others point out that both Secretary of War Stimson and General Eisenhower had desired to reward General Patton with a fourth star for his string of accomplishments in 1944, but that Eisenhower could not promote Patton over Bradley, Devers, and other senior commanders without upsetting the chain of command (as Bradley commanded these people in the theater). A more likely explanation is that as Bradley commanded an Army Group and was the immediate subordinate of Eisenhower, who was promoted to five star rank on 20 December 1944, it was only appropriate that he should hold the next lower rank.

===Victory===
Bradley used the advantage gained in March 1945—after Eisenhower authorized a difficult but successful Allied offensive (on a broad front with British Operation Veritable to the north and American Operation Grenade to the south) in February 1945—to break the German defenses and cross the Rhine into the industrial heartland of the Ruhr. Aggressive pursuit of the disintegrating German troops by the 9th Armored Division resulted in the capture of a bridge across the Rhine River at Remagen. Bradley quickly exploited the crossing, forming the southern arm of an enormous pincer movement encircling the German forces in the Ruhr from the north and south. Over 300,000 prisoners were taken. American forces then met up with the Soviet forces near the Elbe River in mid-April. By V-E Day, the 12th Army Group was a force of four armies (First, Third, Ninth, and Fifteenth) that numbered over 1.3 million men.

===Command style===
Unlike some of the more colorful generals of World War II, Bradley was polite and courteous in his public appearances. A reticent man, Bradley was first favorably brought to public attention by war correspondent Ernie Pyle, who was urged by General Eisenhower to &quot;go and discover Bradley&quot;. Pyle subsequently wrote several dispatches in which he referred to Bradley as the GI&#x27;s general, a title that would stay with Bradley throughout his remaining career. Will Lang Jr. of &quot;Life&quot; magazine said &quot;The thing I most admire about Omar Bradley is his gentleness. He was never known to issue an order to anybody of any rank without saying &#x27;Please&#x27; first.&quot;

While the public at large never forgot the image created by newspaper correspondents, a different view of Bradley was offered by combat historian S. L. A. Marshall, who knew both Bradley and George Patton, and had interviewed officers and men under their commands. Marshall, who was also a critic of George S. Patton, noted that Bradley&#x27;s &quot;common man&quot; image &quot;was played up by Ernie Pyle...The GIs were not impressed with him. They scarcely knew him. He&#x27;s not a flamboyant figure and he didn&#x27;t get out much to troops. And the idea that he was idolized by the average soldier is just rot.&quot;

While Bradley retained his reputation as the &quot;GI&#x27;s general&quot;, he was criticized by some of his contemporaries for other aspects of his leadership style, sometimes described as &quot;managerial&quot; in nature. British General Bernard Montgomery&#x27;s assessment of Bradley was that he was &quot;dull, conscientious, dependable, and loyal&quot;. He had a habit of peremptorily relieving senior commanders who he felt were too independent, or whose command style did not agree with his own, such as the colorful and aggressive General Terry Allen, commander of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division (who was relocated to a different command because Bradley felt that his continued command of the division was making it unmanageably elitist, a decision with which Eisenhower concurred). While Patton is often viewed today as the archetype of the intolerant, impulsive commander, Bradley actually sacked far more generals and senior commanders during World War II, whereas Patton relieved only one general from his command—Orlando Ward—for cause during the entire war (and only after giving General Ward two warnings). When required, Bradley could be a hard disciplinarian; he recommended the death sentence for several soldiers while he served as the commander of the First Army.

One controversy of Bradley&#x27;s leadership involved the lack of use of specialized tanks (Hobart&#x27;s Funnies) in the Normandy invasion. After the war Chester Wilmot quoted correspondence with the developer of the tanks, Major General Percy Hobart, to the effect that the failure to use such tanks was a major contributing factor to the losses at Omaha Beach, and that Bradley had deferred the decision whether to use the tanks to his staff who had not taken up the offer, other than in respect of the DD (swimming) tanks. However a later memo from the 21st Army Group is on record as relaying two separate requests from the First Army, one dealing with the DD tanks and &quot;Porpoises&quot; (towed waterproof trailers), the other with a variety of other Funnies. The second list gives not only items of specific interest with requested numbers, but items known to be available that were not of interest. The requested items were modified Shermans, and tank attachments compatible with Shermans. Noted as not of interest were Funnies that required Churchill or Valentine tanks, or for which alternatives were available from the US. Of the six requested types of Funnies, the Sherman flamethrower version of the Churchill Crocodile is known to have been difficult to produce, and the Centipede never seems to have been used in combat. Richard Anderson considers that the press of time prevented the production of the other four items in numbers beyond the Commonwealth&#x27;s requirements. Given the heavier surf and the topography of Omaha Beach, it is unlikely that the funnies would have been as useful there as they were on the Commonwealth beaches. The British had agreed to provide British-crewed Funnies to operate with the American forces but were unable to train the crews and deliver the vehicles in time.

==Post-war==
===Veterans Administration===
President Truman appointed Bradley to head the Veterans Administration for two years after the war. He served from 15 August 1945 to 30 November 1947, being credited with doing much to improve its health care system and with helping veterans receive their educational benefits under the G. I. Bill of Rights. Bradley&#x27;s influence on the VA is credited with helping shape it into the agency it is today. He was a regular visitor to Capitol Hill and lobbied on behalf of veterans&#x27; benefits in testimony before various congressional veteran affairs committees. Due to his numerous contributions to the Veterans Administration, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs&#x27; primary conference room at the headquarters of the Department of Veterans Affairs is named in Bradley&#x27;s honor.

===Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff===

Bradley became the Army Chief of Staff in 1948. After assuming command, Bradley found a U.S. military establishment badly in need of reorganization, equipment, and training. As Bradley himself put it, &quot;the Army of 1948 could not fight its way out of a paper bag.&quot;

On 11 August 1949, president Harry S. Truman appointed Bradley the first Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. After his initial 1948 plan to expand the Army and modernize its equipment was rejected by the Truman Administration, Bradley reacted to the increasingly severe postwar defense department budget cutbacks imposed by Secretary of Defense Louis A. Johnson by publicly supporting Johnson&#x27;s decisions, going so far as to tell Congress that he would be doing a &quot;disservice to the nation&quot; if he asked for a larger military force. Bradley also suggested that official Navy protests of Secretary Johnson&#x27;s canceling the supercarrier were due to improper personal or political, even mutinous motives, calling Navy admirals &quot;fancy dans who won&#x27;t hit the line with all they have on every play unless they can call the signals&quot;, and who were in &quot;open rebellion against the civilian control.&quot;

In his second memoir, Bradley would later state that not arguing more forcefully in 1948 and 1949 for a sufficient defense budget &quot;was a mistake... perhaps the greatest mistake I made in my postwar years in Washington.&quot;

On 22 September 1950, he was promoted to the rank of General of the Army, the fifth—and last—person to achieve that rank. That same year, Bradley was made the first Chairman of the NATO Military Committee. He remained on the committee until August 1953, when he left active duty. During his service, Bradley visited the White House over 300 times and was frequently featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

Bradley was also an outspoken supporter of providing aid and improving relations with Yugoslavia, stating in an address to Congress on 30 November 1950, that &quot;In the first place, if we could even take them out of the hostile camp and make them neutral, that is one step. If you can get them to act as a threat, that&#x27;s a second step. if you can get them to actively participate on your side, that is an even further step and then, of course, if you had a commitment, where their efforts were integrated with those of ours on the defence, that would still be a further step.&quot; This marked the beginning of US military aid to a communist nation in order to counter Soviet ambitions in the region, leading to greater strives in United States–Yugoslavia relations.

In 1950 Bradley was elected as an honorary member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati in recognition of his outstanding service to his country.

===Korean War===
As Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Bradley was the senior military officer at the outset of the Korean War. When North Korea invaded South Korea in June 1950, Bradley was faced with re-organizing and deploying an American military force that was a shadow of its World War II counterpart. The impact of the Truman administration&#x27;s defense budget cutbacks were now keenly felt, as poorly equipped American troops, lacking sufficient tanks, anti-tank weapons, or artillery were driven down the Korean peninsula to Pusan in a series of costly rearguard actions. In a postwar analysis of the unpreparedness of U.S. Army forces deployed to Korea during the summer and fall of 1950, Army Major General Floyd L. Parks stated that &quot;Many who never lived to tell the tale had to fight the full range of ground warfare from offensive to delaying action, unit by unit, man by man...[T]hat we were able to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat...does not relieve us from the blame of having placed our own flesh and blood in such a predicament.&quot;

Bradley was the chief military policy maker during the Korean War, and supported Truman&#x27;s original plan of &#x27;rolling back&#x27; Communist aggression by conquering all of North Korea. When Chinese Communists entered North Korea in late 1950 and again drove back American forces, Bradley agreed that rollback had to be dropped in favor of a strategy of &quot;containment&quot; of North Korea. The containment strategy was subsequently adopted by the Truman administration for North Korea, and applied to communist expansion worldwide. Never an admirer of General Douglas MacArthur, Bradley was instrumental in convincing Truman to dismiss MacArthur as the overall commander in the Korean theatre after MacArthur resisted administration attempts to scale back strategic objectives in the Korean War.

In his testimony to the U.S. Congress, Bradley strongly rebuked MacArthur for his support of victory at all costs in the Korean War. Soon after Truman relieved MacArthur of command in April 1951, Bradley said in Congressional testimony, &quot;Red China is not the powerful nation seeking to dominate the world. Frankly, in the opinion of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, this strategy would involve us in the wrong war, at the wrong place, at the wrong time, and with the wrong enemy.&quot;

==Retirement==
Bradley left active military service in August 1953, but remained on active duty by virtue of his rank of General of the Army. He chaired the Commission on Veterans&#x27; Pensions, commonly known as the &quot;Bradley Commission&quot;, in 1955–1956. In January 1956, Bradley became one of the founding members of the President&#x27;s Board of Consultants on Foreign Intelligence Activities, later the President&#x27;s Intelligence Advisory Board.

In retirement, Bradley held a number of positions in commercial life, including Chairman of the Board of the Bulova Watch Company from 1958 to 1973. He frequently visited Moberly, Missouri, which he described as his hometown and his favorite city in the world. He was a member of the Moberly Rotary Club, regularly played near-handicap golf at the Moberly Country Club course, and had a &quot;Bradley pew&quot; at Central Christian Church.

His memoirs, &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Story&quot; (ghostwritten by aide-de-camp Chester B. Hansen who kept a daily diary for him during the war), was published in 1951. Bradley started work on his autobiography &quot;A General&#x27;s Life: An Autobiography&quot; (1983) before his death; it was coauthored with Clay Blair, who completed it posthumously. In this work, Bradley criticized British Field Marshal Montgomery&#x27;s 1945 claims to have won the Battle of the Bulge.

On 1 December 1965, Bradley&#x27;s wife, Mary, died of leukemia. He met Esther Dora &quot;Kitty&quot; Buhler (1922–2004) and married her on 12 September 1966; they were married until his death.

As a horse racing fan, Bradley spent much of his leisure time at racetracks in California. He was often invited to present the trophies to the winners. He was a lifetime sports fan, especially of college football. He was the 1948 Grand Marshal of the Tournament of Roses and attended several subsequent Rose Bowl games. (He was driven in his black limousine through Pasadena; it had a personalized California license plate &quot;ONB&quot; and a red plate with 5 gold stars. He frequently was given a police motorcycle escort to the Rose Bowl on New Year&#x27;s Day.) He also was prominent at the Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas, and the Independence Bowl in Shreveport, Louisiana in later years.

In 1967–1968 Bradley served as a member of President Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s Wise Men, a high-level advisory group considering policy for the Vietnam War. Bradley was a hawk and recommended against withdrawal.

Following the death of Dwight D. Eisenhower in March 1969, Bradley was the only surviving 5-star officer in the US Armed Forces.

In 1970, Bradley served as a consultant for the film &quot;Patton.&quot; Screenwriters Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North wrote most of the film based on Bradley&#x27;s memoir, &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Story,&quot; and the biography, &quot;Patton: Ordeal and Triumph,&quot; by Ladislas Farago. The screenwriters did not have access to General Patton&#x27;s diaries nor did Patton&#x27;s family grant interviews. They relied upon observations by Bradley and other military contemporaries when attempting to reconstruct Patton&#x27;s thoughts and motives.

In a review of the film &quot;Patton&quot;, S.L.A. Marshall, who knew both Patton and Bradley, stated that &quot;The Bradley name gets heavy billing on a picture of [a] comrade that, while not caricature, is the likeness of a victorious, glory-seeking buffoon...Patton in the flesh was an enigma. He so stays in the film...Napoleon once said that the art of the general is not strategy but knowing how to mold human nature...Maybe that is all producer Frank McCarthy and Gen. Bradley, his chief advisor, are trying to say.&quot; Though each recognized that he owed part of his success to the other, it was known that Bradley disliked Patton both personally and professionally, but in the film they are portrayed as friendly.

In 1971 Bradley was the subject of an episode of the TV show &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;.

Bradley attended the 30th anniversary of D-Day at Normandy, France on 6 June 1974, participating in various parades.

On 10 January 1977, Bradley was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Gerald Ford.

In 1978, Bradley received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member General Jimmy Doolittle.

Bradley was the keynote speaker at Pointe du Hoc, Normandy, France on 6 June 1979, for the 35th anniversary of D-Day. While seated in a wheelchair, he performed an open ranks inspection of the U.S. representative army unit, the 84th Army Band from VII Corps HQ, Stuttgart, West Germany.

Bradley lived during his last years in Texas at a special residence on the grounds of the William Beaumont Army Medical Center, part of the complex which supports Fort Bliss.

One of Bradley&#x27;s last public appearances was as the guest of honor at the inauguration of President Ronald Reagan on 20 January 1981.

== Death ==

Omar Bradley died on 8 April 1981, in New York City of a cardiac arrhythmia, a few minutes after receiving an award from the National Institute of Social Sciences. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery, next to his two wives.

Bradley served on active duty continuously from his arrival at West Point on 1 August 1911 until his death on 8 April 1981; a total of 69 years, 8 months and 7 days. His was the longest active duty career in the history of the United States Armed Forces.

==Recognition and legacy==
Bradley&#x27;s posthumous autobiography, &quot;A General&#x27;s Life&quot;, was published in 1983. Bradley began the book but found writing difficult, and hired writer Clay Blair to help shape the work. After Bradley&#x27;s death, Blair continued the writing, using Bradley&#x27;s first-person voice. The resulting book is also based on Blair&#x27;s interviews of people in Bradley&#x27;s circles, and on Bradley&#x27;s personal papers.

Bradley is known for saying, &quot;Ours is a world of nuclear giants and ethical infants. We know more about war than about peace, more about killing than we know about living.&quot;

The U.S. Army&#x27;s Bradley Fighting Vehicle was named after General Bradley.

Bradley&#x27;s hometown, Moberly, Missouri, classifies him as a &quot;favorite son&quot; and is planning a library and museum in his honor. Bradley Leadership Symposia have been held in Moberly, honoring him as a teacher of young officers. On 12 February 2010, the U.S. House of Representatives, the Missouri Senate, the Missouri House, the County of Randolph and the City of Moberly recognized Bradley&#x27;s birthday as General Omar Nelson Bradley Day.

On 5 May 2000, the United States Postal Service issued a series of &quot;Distinguished Soldiers&quot; stamps in which Bradley was honored.

There is also an elementary school named after him in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

===Dates of rank===
Source:
* – Discharged as Major and appointed Captain on 4 November 1922; acts 30 June 1922, and 14 September 1922

** – Bradley&#x27;s effective date for permanent brigadier general in the Regular Army is earlier than his effective date of promotion for permanent colonel. While serving as a temporary lieutenant general in early 1943, Bradley was notified that he would be promoted to permanent colonel with an effective date of 1 October 1943. At the time, promotions to permanent brigadier and major general had been withheld for more than two years, except for Delos C. Emmons, Henry H. Arnold, and Dwight Eisenhower. President Franklin D. Roosevelt lifted the moratorium after Bradley was notified that he would be promoted to colonel, but before the 1 October effective date.

In determining whom to promote after the lifting of Roosevelt&#x27;s moratorium, Marshall consulted with Eisenhower, and they agreed to promote Bradley and several others. Marshall and Eisenhower then arranged the effective dates of promotion to brigadier general based on where they wanted each of the individuals selected to rank in terms of seniority. Bradley&#x27;s date of rank for permanent brigadier general was then set as 1 September 1943—even though this was before his 1 October 1943, effective date for promotion to colonel—based on where Eisenhower and Marshall wanted Bradley to fall in terms of seniority as a brigadier general.

Bradley&#x27;s and the other promotions to brigadier general on which Marshall and Eisenhower had conferred were not acted on until mid-October 1943 because Congress had to approve a waiver for those generals, including Bradley, who did not yet have 28 years of service. As a result, his 1 October 1943, date for promotion to permanent colonel was allowed to remain in effect. When Congress acted in mid-October to approve Bradley&#x27;s time in service waiver and promotion to permanent brigadier general, his effective date for brigadier general was backdated to 1 September 1943. The 1 September 1943, date for permanent brigadier general enabled Bradley to line up with his peers where Marshall and Eisenhower intended for purposes of seniority.

The effective postdated (and then backdated) date of rank for Bradley&#x27;s promotion to permanent brigadier general—1 September 1943—thus came before the effective postdated date of rank for his promotion to colonel—1 October1943.

<text>Luoyang () is a city located in the confluence area of the Luo River and the Yellow River in the west of Henan province, China. Governed as a prefecture-level city, it borders the provincial capital of Zhengzhou to the east, Pingdingshan to the southeast, Nanyang to the south, Sanmenxia to the west, Jiyuan to the north, and Jiaozuo to the northeast. As of December 31, 2018, Luoyang had a population of 6,888,500 inhabitants with 2,751,400 people living in the built-up (or metro) area made of the city&#x27;s five out of six urban districts (except the Jili District not continuously urbanized) and Yanshi District, now being conurbated. By the end of 2022, Luoyang Municipality had jurisdiction over 7 municipal districts, 7 counties and 1 development zone. The permanent population is 7.079 million.

Situated on the central plain of China, Luoyang is among the oldest cities in China and one of the cradles of Chinese civilization. It is the earliest of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China.

==Etymology==

The name &quot;Luoyang&quot; originates from the city&#x27;s location on the north or sunny (&quot;yang&quot;) side of the Luo River. Since the river flows from west to east and the sun is to the south of the river, the sun always shines on the north side of the river. Luoyang has had several names over the centuries, including Luoyi () and Luozhou (), but Luoyang has been its primary name. It has also been called Dongdu () during the Tang dynasty, Xijing () during the Song dynasty, or Jingluo (). During the rule of Wu Zetian, the only female emperor in Chinese history, the city was known as Shendu (). Luoyang was renamed Henanfu () during the Qing dynasty but regained its former name in 1912.

==History==
===Classical era===

Several cities – all of which are generally referred to as &quot;Luoyang&quot; – have been built in this area. In 2070 BC, the Xia dynasty king Tai Kang moved the Xia capital to the intersection of the Luo and Yi and named the city Zhenxun (). In 1600 BC, Tang of Shang defeated Jie, the final Xia dynasty king, and built Western Bo, (), a new capital on the Luo River. The ruins of Western Bo are located in Luoyang Prefecture.

In 1036 BC a settlement named Chengzhou () was constructed by the Duke of Zhou for the remnants of the captured Shang nobility. The Duke also moved the Nine Tripod Cauldrons to Chengzhou from the Zhou dynasty capital at Haojing. A second Western Zhou capital, Wangcheng (also: Luoyi) was built west of Chengzhou. Wangcheng became the capital of the Eastern Zhou dynasty in 771 BC. The Eastern Zhou dynasty capital was moved to Chengzhou in 510 BC. Later, the Eastern Han dynasty capital of Luoyang would be built over Chengzhou. Modern Luoyang is built over the ruins of Wangcheng, which are still visible today at Wangcheng Park.

Qin Shi Huang&#x27;s chief minister, Lu Buwei, was given Luoyang. Lu began programs to develop and beautify Luoyang. It is said that Liu Bang visited Luoyang and considered making it his capital but was persuaded to reconsider by his ministers to turn to Chang&#x27;an instead for his capital.

===Han dynasty===

In 25 AD, Luoyang was declared the capital of the Eastern Han dynasty on November 27 by Emperor Guangwu of Han. The city walls formed a rectangle 4 km south to north and 2.5 km west to east, with the Gu River, a tributary of the Luo River just outside the northern eastern walls. The rectangular Southern Palace and the Northern Palace were 3 km apart and connected by The Covered Way. In 26 AD, the Altar of the Gods of the Soils and Grains, the Altar of Heaven, and the Temple of the eminent Founder, Emperor Gao of Former Han were inaugurated. The Imperial University was restored in 29 AD. In 48 AD, the Yang Canal linked the capital to the Luo. In 56 AD, the main imperial observatory, the Spiritual Terrace, was constructed.

For several centuries, Luoyang was the focal point of China. In AD 68, the White Horse Temple, the first Buddhist temple in China, was founded in Luoyang. The temple still exists, though the architecture is of later origin, mainly from the 16th century. An Shigao was one of the first monks to popularize Buddhism in Luoyang.

The diplomat Ban Chao restored the Silk Road during the Eastern Han dynasty, thus making Luoyang the eastern terminus of the Silk Road during the Han dynasty.

In 166 AD, the first Roman mission, sent by &quot;the king of Da Qin [the Roman Empire], Andun&quot; (Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, r. 161–180 AD), reached Luoyang after arriving by sea in Rinan Commandery in what is now central Vietnam.

The late 2nd century saw China decline into anarchy:

The decline was accelerated by the rebellion of the Yellow Turbans, who, although defeated by the Imperial troops in 184 AD, weakened the state to the point where there was a continuing series of rebellions degenerating into civil war, culminating in the burning of the Han capital of Luoyang on 24 September 189 AD. This was followed by a state of continual unrest and wars in China until a modicum of stability returned in the 220s, but with the establishment of three separate kingdoms, rather than a unified empire.

===Wei and Jin dynasties===
On April 4, 190 AD, Chancellor Dong Zhuo ordered his soldiers to ransack, pillage, and raze the city as he retreated from the coalition set up against him by regional lords all over China. The court was subsequently moved to the more defensible western city of Chang&#x27;an (modern Xi&#x27;an). Following a period of disorder, during which warlord Cao Cao held the last Han emperor Xian in Xuchang (196–220), Luoyang was restored to prominence when his son Cao Pi, Emperor Wen of the Wei dynasty, declared it his capital in 220 AD. The Jin dynasty, successor to Wei, was also established in Luoyang. At the height of Jin rule, Luoyang had a population of 600,000 and was probably the second largest city in the world after Rome.

At the start of the 4th century, Luoyang was subjected to repeated attacks during the War of the Eight Princes and Upheaval of the Five Barbarians under the Jin. In 311 AD, rebel forces of the Xiongnu-led Han-Zhao dynasty sacked and razed the city in an event known as the Disaster of Yongjia. For the next two centuries, Luoyang would cease as a major population hub, but remained a hotly contested region among various states to come. It was the site of a pivotal battle in 328 between the Han-Zhao and Later Zhao dynasties which established the latter as a hegemonic power in the north. The city changed hands several times throughout the Sixteen Kingdoms period, as it was also controlled by the Former Yan, Former Qin and Later Qin dynasties. The Jin dynasty, which had relocated south of the Yangtze river after the upheaval, was even able to recover the city on a few occasions.

===Northern Wei===

In winter 416, during Liu Yu&#x27;s northern expedition against the Later Qin, Luoyang fell to the Jin general Tan Daoji. In 422, the city was captured by Xianbei-led Northern Wei dynasty. The Liu Song dynasty, which succeeded the Jin, briefly recovered the city in 430, but by the 460s, Luoyang was definitively under Wei control. In 493 AD, as part of his sinicization campaign, Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei moved the capital from Datong to Luoyang, moving over 150,000 people to the site by 495, and started the construction of the rock-cut Longmen Grottoes. More than 30,000 Buddhist statues from the time of this dynasty have been found in the caves. Many of these sculptures were two-faced. At the same time, the Shaolin Temple was also built by the Emperor to accommodate an Indian monk on the Mont Song right next to Luoyang City. The Yongning Temple (), the tallest pagoda in China, was also built in Luoyang. The city reached a population of 600,000 at its height during the Northern Wei. The city was destroyed by the warlord Gao Huan, who captured the city and forced its population to move to his capital at Ye in 534. The old city was the site of numerous battles between Western Wei (and its successor Northern Zhou) and Eastern Wei (and its successor Northern Qi) between 538 and 575.

===Sui and Tang dynasties===
When Emperor Yang of Sui took control in 604 AD he founded the new Luoyang on the site of the existing city using a layout inspired by his father Emperor Wen of Sui&#x27;s work in newly rebuilt Chang&#x27;an.


During the Tang dynasty, Luoyang was Dongdu (), the &quot;Eastern Capital&quot;, and at its height had a population of around one million, second only to Chang&#x27;an, which, at the time, was the largest city in the world.

During an interval in the Tang dynasty, the first and the only empress in Chinese history – Empress Wu, moved the capital of her Zhou dynasty to Luoyang and named it as Shen Du (Capital of the God). She constructed the tallest palace in Chinese history, which is now in the site of Sui Tang Luoyang city. Luoyang was heavily damaged during the An Lushan Rebellion.

Epitaphs were found dating from the Tang dynasty of a Christian couple in Luoyang of a Nestorian Christian Sogdian woman, Lady An (安氏), who died in 821, and her Nestorian Christian Han Chinese husband, Hua Xian (花献), who died in 827. These Han Chinese Christian men may have married Sogdian Christian women because of a lack of Han Chinese women belonging to the Christian religion, limiting their choice of spouses among the same ethnicity. Another epitaph in Luoyang of a Nestorian Christian Sogdian woman also surnamed An was discovered and she was put in her tomb by her military officer son on 22 January, 815. This Sogdian woman&#x27;s husband was surnamed He (和) and he was a Han Chinese man and the family was indicated to be multiethnic on the epitaph pillar. In Luoyang, the mixed raced sons of Nestorian Christian Sogdian women and Han Chinese men has many career paths available for them. Neither their mixed ethnicity nor their faith were barriers and they were able to become civil officials, a military officers and openly celebrated their Christian religion and support Christian monasteries. Central Asians like Sogdians were called &quot;Hu&quot; (胡) by the Chinese during the Tang dynasty. Central Asian &quot;Hu&quot; women were stereotyped as barmaids or dancers by Han in China. Occasionally, &quot;Hu&quot; women would be involved in prostitution as the &quot;Hu&quot; women in China were at times in occupations that doubled as illicit services. 

During the short Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, Luoyang was the capital of the Later Liang (only for a few years before the court moved to Kaifeng) and Later Tang dynasty.

===Later history===
During the North Song dynasty, Luoyang was the &#x27;Western Capital&#x27; and birthplace of Zhao Kuangyin, the founder of the Song dynasty. It served as a prominent cultural center, housing some of the most important philosophers. This prosperity was mainly caused by Luoyang undergoing new developments and reconstruction during this period.

During the Jurchen Jin dynasty, Luoyang was the &quot;Middle Capital&quot;.

Since the Yuan dynasty, Luoyang was no longer the capital of China in the rest of the ancient dynasties. During the Yuan and Ming dynasties, Luoyang was razed and rebuilt twice. Its walls were destroyed by peasant rebels in the late Ming period. The city walls were then rebuilt during the Qing dynasty. The population was reduced to that of an average county. However, for one last time, Luoyang city was the capital of the Republic of China for a brief period of time during the Japanese invasion. By 1949, Luoyang&#x27;s population was 75,000.

===People&#x27;s Republic of China===

After the People&#x27;s Republic of China was established, Luoyang was revived as a major heavy industrial hub. In the first five-year plan of China, 7 of 156 Soviet-aided major industrial programmes were launched in Luoyang&#x27;s Jianxi District, including Dongfanghong Tractor Factory, Luoyang Mining Machines Factory and Luoyang Bearing Factory. Later, during the Third Front construction, a group of heavy industry factories was moved to or founded in Luoyang, including Luoyang Glass Factory. Industrial development significantly shifted Luoyang&#x27;s demographic makeup, and about half of Luoyang&#x27;s population are new immigrants after 1949 from outside the province or their descendants.

===2021 administrative reorganization===
With the 2017 designation of Zhengzhou as a National Central City, Henan Province in 2020 proposed a new development plan for Zhengzhou Metropolitan Area, which called for the development of Luoyang as a sub-central city. As part of this development, authorities decided to expand the urban area of Luoyang. This not only facilitated planning and coordinated use of resources and infrastructure in Luoyang, but also allowed for better integration towards Zhengzhou, as Yanshi, Jili and Mengjin previously separated the Luoyang urban area from Zhengzhou.

On 28 March 2021, the central government approved a major administrative reorganization of Luoyang city. Yanshi City was reorganized into an urban district (Yanshi District), while Jili District and Mengjin County were merged into Mengjin District. This reorganization effectively doubled the urban area of Luoyang.

<text>Ultra-wideband (UWB, ultra wideband, ultra-wide band and ultraband) is a radio technology that can use a very low energy level for short-range, high-bandwidth communications over a large portion of the radio spectrum. UWB has traditional applications in non-cooperative radar imaging. Most recent applications target sensor data collection, precise locating, and tracking. UWB support started to appear in high-end smartphones in 2019.

==Characteristics==
Ultra-wideband is a technology for transmitting information across a wide bandwidth (&gt;500 MHz). This allows for the transmission of a large amount of signal energy without interfering with conventional narrowband and carrier wave transmission in the same frequency band. Regulatory limits in many countries allow for this efficient use of radio bandwidth, and enable high-data-rate personal area network (PAN) wireless connectivity, longer-range low-data-rate applications, and the transparent co-existence of radar and imaging systems with existing communications systems.

Ultra-wideband was formerly known as &quot;pulse radio&quot;, but the FCC and the International Telecommunication Union Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) currently define UWB as an antenna transmission for which emitted signal bandwidth exceeds the lesser of 500 MHz or 20% of the arithmetic center frequency. Thus, pulse-based systems—where each transmitted pulse occupies the UWB bandwidth (or an aggregate of at least 500 MHz of a narrow-band carrier; for example, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM))—can access the UWB spectrum under the rules.

=== Theory ===
A significant difference between conventional radio transmissions and UWB is that conventional systems transmit information by varying the power level, frequency, or phase (or a combination of these) of a sinusoidal wave. UWB transmissions transmit information by generating radio energy at specific time intervals and occupying a large bandwidth, thus enabling pulse-position or time modulation. The information can also be modulated on UWB signals (pulses) by encoding the polarity of the pulse, its amplitude and/or by using orthogonal pulses. UWB pulses can be sent sporadically at relatively low pulse rates to support time or position modulation, but can also be sent at rates up to the inverse of the UWB pulse bandwidth. Pulse-UWB systems have been demonstrated at channel pulse rates in excess of 1.3 billion pulses per second using a continuous stream of UWB pulses (Continuous Pulse UWB or C-UWB), while supporting forward error-correction encoded data rates in excess of 675 Mbit/s.

A UWB radio system can be used to determine the &quot;time of flight&quot; of the transmission at various frequencies. This helps overcome multipath propagation, since some of the frequencies have a line-of-sight trajectory, while other indirect paths have longer delays. With a cooperative symmetric two-way metering technique, distances can be measured to high resolution and accuracy.

== Applications ==
=== Real-time location ===

Ultra-wideband (UWB) technology is utilised for real-time locationing due to its precision and reliability. It plays a role in various industries such as logistics, healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation. UWB&#x27;s centimeter-level accuracy is valuable in applications in which using traditional methods may be unsuitable, such as in indoor environments, where GPS precision may be hindered. Its low power consumption ensures minimal interference and allows for coexistence with existing infrastructure. UWB performs well in challenging environments with its immunity to multipath interference, providing consistent and accurate positioning. In logistics, UWB increases inventory tracking efficiency, reducing losses and optimizing operations. Healthcare makes use of UWB in asset tracking, patient flow optimization, and in improving care coordination. In manufacturing, UWB is used for streamlining inventory management and enhancing production efficiency through accurate tracking of materials and tools. UWB supports route planning, fleet management, and vehicle security in transportation systems.

UWB uses multiple techniques for location detection:

* Time of flight (ToF)
* Time difference of arrival (TDoA)
* Two-way ranging (TWR)

=== Mobile devices with UWB capability ===
Apple launched the first three phones with ultra-wideband capabilities in September 2019, namely, the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max. Apple also launched Series 6 of Apple Watch in September 2020, which features UWB, and their AirTags featuring this technology were revealed at a press event on April 20, 2021. The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, Galaxy S21+, and Galaxy S21 Ultra also began supporting UWB, along with the Samsung Galaxy SmartTag+.
The Xiaomi MIX 4 released in August 2021 supports UWB, and offers the capability of connecting to select AIoT devices.

The FiRa Consortium was founded in August 2019 to develop interoperable UWB ecosystems including mobile phones. Samsung, Xiaomi, and Oppo are currently members of the FiRa Consortium. In November 2020, Android Open Source Project received first patches related to an upcoming UWB API; &quot;feature-complete&quot; UWB support (exclusively for the sole use case of ranging between supported devices) was released in version 13 of Android.

=== Industrial applications ===
* Automation and robotics: Its high data rate and low latency enable real-time communication and control between machines and systems. UWB-based communication protocols ensure reliable and secure data transmission, enabling precise coordination and synchronization of automated processes. This enhances manufacturing efficiency, reduces errors, and improves overall productivity. UWB can also be integrated into robotic systems to enable precise localization, object detection, and collision avoidance, further enhancing the safety and efficiency of industrial automation.
* Worker safety and proximity sensing: Worker safety is a concern in industrial settings. UWB technology provides effective proximity sensing and worker safety solutions. By equipping workers with UWB-enabled devices or badges, companies can monitor their location and movement in real-time. UWB-based systems can detect potential collisions between workers and machinery, issuing timely warnings to prevent accidents. Moreover, UWB technology allows for the creation of safety zones and controlled access areas, ensuring the safe interaction of workers with hazardous equipment or restricted zones. This helps enhance workplace safety, reduce accidents, and protect employees from potential hazards.
* Asset tracking and management: Efficient asset tracking and management are crucial for industrial operations. UWB enables precise and real-time tracking of assets within industrial facilities. By attaching UWB tags to equipment, tools, and inventory, companies can monitor their location, movement, and utilization. This enhances inventory management, reduces asset loss, minimizes downtime, and streamlines maintenance processes. UWB-based asset tracking systems provide accurate and reliable data, empowering businesses to optimize their resource allocation and improve overall operational efficiency.

=== Radar ===
Ultra-wideband gained widespread attention for its implementation in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology. Due to its high resolution capacities using lower frequencies, UWB SAR was heavily researched for its object-penetration ability. Starting in the early 1990s, the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) developed various stationary and mobile ground-, foliage-, and wall-penetrating radar platforms that served to detect and identify buried IEDs and hidden adversaries at a safe distance. Examples include the railSAR, the boomSAR, the SIRE radar, and the SAFIRE radar. ARL has also investigated the feasibility of whether UWB radar technology can incorporate Doppler processing to estimate the velocity of a moving target when the platform is stationary. While a 2013 report highlighted the issue with the use of UWB waveforms due to target range migration during the integration interval, more recent studies have suggested that UWB waveforms can demonstrate better performance compared to conventional Doppler processing as long as a correct matched filter is used.

Ultra-wideband pulse Doppler radars have also been used to monitor vital signs of the human body, such as heart rate and respiration signals as well as human gait analysis and fall detection. It serves as a potential alternative to continuous-wave radar systems since it involves less power consumption and a high-resolution range profile. However, its low signal-to-noise ratio has made it vulnerable to errors. A commercial example of this application is RayBaby, which is a baby monitor that detects breathing and heart rate to determine whether a baby is asleep or awake. Raybaby has a detection range of five meters and can detect fine movements of less than a millimeter.

Ultra-wideband is also used in &quot;see-through-the-wall&quot; precision radar-imaging technology, precision locating and tracking (using distance measurements between radios), and precision time-of-arrival-based localization approaches. UWB radar has been proposed as the active sensor component in an Automatic Target Recognition application, designed to detect humans or objects that have fallen onto subway tracks.

=== Data transfer ===
Ultra-wideband characteristics are well-suited to short-range applications, such as PC peripherals, wireless monitors, camcorders, wireless printing, and file transfers to portable media players. UWB was proposed for use in personal area networks, and appeared in the IEEE 802.15.3a draft PAN standard. However, after several years of deadlock, the IEEE 802.15.3a task group was dissolved in 2006. The work was completed by the WiMedia Alliance and the USB Implementer Forum. Slow progress in UWB standards development, the cost of initial implementation, and performance significantly lower than initially expected are several reasons for the limited use of UWB in consumer products (which caused several UWB vendors to cease operations in 2008 and 2009).

=== Autonomous vehicles ===
UWB&#x27;s precise positioning and ranging capabilities enable collision avoidance and centimeter-level localization accuracy, surpassing traditional GPS systems. Moreover, its high data rate and low latency facilitate seamless vehicle-to-vehicle communication, promoting real-time information exchange and coordinated actions. UWB also enables effective vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, integrating with infrastructure elements for optimized behavior based on precise timing and synchronized data. Additionally, UWB&#x27;s versatility supports innovative applications such as high-resolution radar imaging for advanced driver assistance systems, secure key less entry via biometrics or device pairing, and occupant monitoring systems, potentially enhancing convenience, security, and passenger safety.

== Regulation ==
In the U.S., &quot;ultra-wideband&quot; refers to radio technology with a bandwidth exceeding the lesser of 500 MHz or 20% of the arithmetic center frequency, according to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC). A February 14, 2002 FCC Report and Order authorized the unlicensed use of UWB in the frequency range from 3.1 to 10.6 GHz. The FCC power spectral density (PSD) emission limit for UWB transmitters is −41.3 dBm/MHz. This limit also applies to unintentional emitters in the UWB band (the &quot;Part 15&quot; limit). However, the emission limit for UWB emitters may be significantly lower (as low as −75 dBm/MHz) in other segments of the spectrum.

Deliberations in the International Telecommunication Union Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) resulted in a Report and Recommendation on UWB in November 2005. UK regulator Ofcom announced a similar decision on 9 August 2007.

There has been concern over interference between narrowband and UWB signals that share the same spectrum. Earlier, the only radio technology that used pulses was spark-gap transmitters, which international treaties banned because they interfere with medium-wave receivers. However, UWB uses much lower levels of power. The subject was extensively covered in the proceedings that led to the adoption of the FCC rules in the US, and in the meetings of the ITU-R leading to its Report and Recommendations on UWB technology. Commonly-used electrical appliances emit impulsive noise (for example, hair dryers), and proponents successfully argued that the noise floor would not be raised excessively by wider deployment of low power wideband transmitters.

=== Coexistence with other standards ===
In February 2002, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) released an amendment (Part 15) that specifies the rules of UWB transmission and reception. According to this release, any signal with fractional bandwidth greater than 20% or having a bandwidth greater than 500 MHz is considered as an UWB signal. The FCC ruling also defines access to 7.5 GHz of unlicensed spectrum between 3.1 and 10.6 GHz that is made available for communication and measurement systems.

Narrowband signals that exist in the UWB range, such as IEEE 802.11a transmissions, may exhibit high PSD levels compared to UWB signals as seen by a UWB receiver. As a result, one would expect a degradation of UWB bit error rate performance.

<doc id="166431" wikidata="Q459939" url="?curid=166431" title="Kofun period">
<text>The is an era in the history of Japan from about 300 to 538 AD (the date of the introduction of Buddhism), following the Yayoi period. The Kofun and the subsequent Asuka periods are sometimes collectively called the Yamato period. This period is the earliest era of recorded history in Japan, but studies depend heavily on archaeology since the chronology of historical sources tends to be distorted. The word &quot;kofun&quot; is Japanese for the type of burial mound dating from this era.

It was a period of cultural import. Continuing from the Yayoi period, the Kofun period is characterized by influence from China and the Korean Peninsula; archaeologists consider it a shared culture across the southern Korean Peninsula, Kyūshū and Honshū. On the other hand, the most prosperous keyhole-shaped burial mounds in Japan during this period were approximately 5,000 in Japan from the middle of the 3rd century in the Yayoi period to the 7th century in the Asuka period, and many of them had huge tombs, but in the southern Korean Peninsula there were only 13 from the 5th century to the 6th century, and the tombs were small. Wall decorations and Japanese-style armor, which are characteristic of older Japanese burial mounds, were excavated from 5th century burial mounds in the southern Korean Peninsula. This shows that Japan and the southern Korean Peninsula influenced each other.

According to the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, Buddhism and the Chinese writing system were introduced near the end of the period from Baekje. The Kofun period recorded Japan&#x27;s earliest political centralization, when the Yamato clan rose to power in southwestern Japan, established the Imperial House, and helped control trade routes across the region.

==Kofun tombs==
Kofun (from Middle Chinese &quot;kú&quot; 古 &quot;ancient&quot; + &quot;bjun&quot; 墳 &quot;burial mound&quot;) are burial mounds built for members of the ruling class from the 3rd to the 7th centuries in Japan, and the Kofun period takes its name from the distinctive earthen mounds. The mounds contained large stone burial chambers, and some are surrounded by moats.

Kofun have four basic shapes: round and square are the most common, followed by &#x27;scallop-shell&#x27; and &#x27;keyhole.&#x27; The keyhole tomb is a distinct style found only in Japan, with a square front and round back. Kofun range in size from several meters to over 400 meters long, and unglazed pottery figures (&quot;Haniwa&quot;) were often buried under a kofun&#x27;s circumference.

===Development===

The oldest Japanese kofun is reportedly Hokenoyama Kofun in Sakurai, Nara, which dates to the late 3rd century. In the Makimuku district of Sakurai, later keyhole kofuns (Hashihaka Kofun, Shibuya Mukaiyama Kofun) were built during the early 4th century. The keyhole kofun spread from Yamato to Kawachi—with giant kofun, such as Daisenryō Kofun—and then throughout the country during the 5th century. Keyhole kofun disappeared later in the 6th century, probably because of the drastic reformation of the Yamato court; &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; records the introduction of Buddhism at this time. The last two great kofun are the Imashirozuka kofun in Osaka (currently believed by scholars to be the tomb of Emperor Keitai) and the Iwatoyama kofun in Fukuoka, recorded in &quot;Fudoki of Chikugo&quot; as the tomb of Iwai (political archrival of Emperor Keitai). Kofun burial mounds on the island of Tanegashima and two very old Shinto shrines on the island of Yakushima suggest that these islands were the southern boundary of the Yamato state; it extended north to Tainai in the present-day Niigata Prefecture, where excavated mounds have been associated with a person closely linked to the Yamato kingdom.

==Yamato court==

Yamato rule is usually believed to have begun about 250 AD, and it is generally agreed that Yamato rulers had keyhole-kofun culture and hegemony in Yamato until the 4th century. Autonomy of local powers remained throughout the period, particularly in Kibi (the present-day Okayama Prefecture), Izumo (current Shimane Prefecture), Koshi (current Fukui and Niigata Prefecture), Kenu (northern Kantō), Chikushi (northern Kyūshū), and Hi (central Kyūshū). During the 6th century, the Yamato clans began to dominate the southern half of Japan. According to the &quot;Book of Song&quot;, Yamato relationships with China probably began in the late 4th century.

The Yamato polity, which emerged by the late 5th century, was distinguished by powerful clans (豪族, &quot;gōzoku&quot;). Each clan was headed by a patriarch (氏上, &quot;Uji-no-kami&quot;), who performed sacred rituals to the clan&#x27;s &quot;kami&quot; (objects of worship) to ensure its long-term welfare. Clan members were the aristocracy, and the royal line which controlled the Yamato court was at its zenith. Clan leaders were awarded &quot;kabane&quot;, inherited titles denoting rank and political standing which replaced family names.

The Kofun period is called the Yamato period by some Western scholars, since this local chieftainship became the imperial dynasty at the end of the period. However, the Yamato clan ruled just one polity among others during the Kofun era. Japanese archaeologists emphasise that other regional chieftainships (such as Kibi) were in close contention for dominance in the first half of the Kofun period; Kibi&#x27;s Tsukuriyama Kofun is Japan&#x27;s fourth-largest.
The Yamato court exercised power over clans in Kyūshū and Honshū, bestowing titles (some hereditary) on clan chieftains. The Yamato name became synonymous with Japan as Yamato rulers suppressed other clans and acquired agricultural land. Based on Chinese models (including the adoption of the Chinese written language), they began to develop a central administration and an imperial court attended by subordinate clan chieftains with no permanent capital. Powerful clans were the Soga, Katsuragi, Heguri and Koze clans in the Yamato and Bizen Provinces and the Kibi clans in the Izumo Province. The Ōtomo and Mononobe clans were military leaders, and the Nakatomi and Inbe clans handled rituals. The Soga clan provided the government&#x27;s chief minister, the Ōtomo and Mononobe clans provided secondary ministers, and provincial leaders were called &quot;kuni no miyatsuko&quot;. Craftsmen were organized into guilds.

===Territorial expansion===

In addition to archaeological findings indicating a local monarchy in Kibi Province as an important rival, the legend of the 4th-century Prince Yamato Takeru alludes to the borders of the Yamato and battlegrounds in the region; a frontier was near the later Izumo Province (eastern present-day Shimane Prefecture). Another frontier, in Kyūshū, was apparently north of present-day Kumamoto Prefecture. According to the legend, there was an eastern land in Honshū &quot;whose people disobeyed the imperial court&quot; and against whom Yamato Takeru was sent to fight. It is unclear if the rival country was near the Yamato nucleus or further away. Kai Province is mentioned as a location where prince Yamato Takeru traveled on his military expedition.

The period&#x27;s northern frontier was explained in &quot;Kojiki&quot; as the legend of Shido Shōgun&#x27;s (四道将軍, &quot;Shōguns to four ways&quot;) expedition. One of four &quot;shōguns&quot;, Ōbiko set out northward to Koshi and his son Take Nunakawawake left for the eastern states. The father moved east from northern Koshi, and the son moved north; they met at Aizu, in present-day western Fukushima Prefecture. Although the legend is probably not factual, Aizu is near southern Tōhoku (the northern extent of late-4th-century keyhole-kofun culture).

===Ōkimi===

During the Kofun period, an aristocratic society with militaristic rulers developed. The period was a critical stage in Japan&#x27;s evolution into a cohesive, recognized state. The society was most developed in the Kinai region and the eastern Setouchi region. Japan&#x27;s rulers petitioned the Chinese court for confirmation of royal titles.

While the rulers&#x27; title was officially &quot;King&quot;, they called themselves &quot;Ōkimi&quot; (大王, &quot;Great King&quot;) during this period. Inscriptions on two swords (the Inariyama and Eta Funayama Swords) read &quot;Amenoshita Shiroshimesu&quot; (治天下; &quot;ruling Heaven and Earth&quot;) and &quot;Ōkimi&quot;, indicating that the rulers invoked the Mandate of Heaven. The title &quot;Amenoshita Shiroshimesu Ōkimi&quot; was used until the 7th century, when it was replaced by &quot;Tennō&quot;.

===Clans===
Many of the clans and local chieftains who made up the Yamato polity claimed descent from the imperial family or &quot;kami&quot;. Archaeological evidence for the clans is found on the Inariyama Sword, on which the bearer recorded the names of his ancestors to claim descent from &quot;Ōbiko&quot; (大彦, recorded in the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; as a son of Emperor Kōgen). A number of clans claimed origin in China or the Korean Peninsula.

During the 5th century, the Katsuragi clan (葛城氏, descended from the legendary grandson of Emperor Kōgen) was the most prominent power in the court and intermarried with the imperial family. After the clan declined, late in the century, it was replaced by the Ōtomo clan. When Emperor Buretsu died with no apparent heir, Ōtomo no Kanamura recommended Emperor Keitai (a distant imperial relative in Koshi Province) as the new monarch. Kanamura resigned due to the failure of his diplomatic policies, and the court was controlled by the Mononobe and Soga clans at the beginning of the Asuka period.

==Society==
===Toraijin===
&quot;&quot; refers to people who immigrated to Japan from abroad via the Ryukyu Islands or the Korean Peninsula. They introduced numerous, significant aspects of Chinese culture to Japan such as Chinese writing system and Buddhism from India. Valuing their knowledge and culture, the Yamato government gave preferential treatment to &quot;toraijin&quot;. According to the 815 book, &quot;Shinsen Shōjiroku&quot;, 317 of 1,182 clans in the Kinai region of Honshū were considered to have foreign ancestry. 163 were of Chinese origin (written as &quot;Kan&quot;), 104 from Baekje (&quot;Paekche&quot; in the older romanization), 41 from Goguryeo, 6 from Silla, and 3 from Gaya. They may have immigrated to Japan between 356 and 645.

===Influential immigrants===
Some of the many immigrants that had significant influence in Kofun period Japan included Wani, Yuzuki no Kimi and Achi no Omi, the founders of Kawachinofumi clan/Kawachinoaya clan, Hata clan and Yamatonoaya clan, respectively. Despite being ethnically similar, many immigrants from Baekje and Silla had arrived in Japan during Emperor Ōjin&#x27;s reign carrying separate identities and foreign deities such as the &quot;kami&quot; Inari.

Other immigrants who settled in Japan beginning in the 4th century were the progenitors of Japanese clans. According to &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, the oldest record of a Silla immigrant is Amenohiboko: a legendary prince of Silla who settled in Japan at the era of Emperor Suinin, possibly during the 3rd or 4th centuries.

Baekje and Silla sent their princes as hostages to the Yamato court in exchange for military support. King Muryeong of Baekje was born in Kyushu (筑紫) of Japan as the child of a hostage in 462, and left a son in Japan who was an ancestor of the minor-noble clan. According to the , Yamato no Fubito&#x27;s relative (Takano no Niigasa) was a 10th-generation descendant of King Muryeong of Baekje who was chosen as a concubine for Emperor Kōnin and was the mother of Emperor Kanmu. In 2001, Emperor Akihito confirmed his ancient royal Korean heritage through Emperor Kanmu.

==Culture==
===Language===

Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans wrote historical accounts primarily in Chinese characters, making original pronunciation difficult to trace. Although writing was largely unknown to the indigenous Japanese of the period, the literary skills of foreigners seem to have been increasingly appreciated by the Japanese elite. The Inariyama Sword, tentatively dated to 471 or 531, contains a Chinese-character inscription in a style used in China at the time.

===&quot;Haniwa&quot;===
The cavalry wore armour, carried swords and other weapons, and used advanced military methods similar to those of Northeast Asia. Evidence of the advances is seen in , clay offerings placed in a ring on and around the tomb mounds of the ruling elite. The most important of these &quot;haniwa&quot; were found in southern Honshū (especially the Kinai region around Nara Prefecture) and northern Kyūshū. &quot;Haniwa&quot; grave offerings were sculpted as horses, chickens, birds, fans, fish, houses, weapons, shields, sunshades, pillows, and male and female humans. Another funerary piece, the , became symbolic of imperial power.

===Introduction of material culture===
Much of the material culture of the Kofun period demonstrates that Japan was in close political and economic contact with continental Asia (especially with the southern dynasties of China) via the Korean Peninsula; bronze mirrors cast from the same mould have been found on both sides of the Tsushima Strait. Irrigation, sericulture, and weaving were brought to Japan by immigrants, who are mentioned in ancient Japanese histories; the Hata clan introduced sericulture and certain types of weaving.

==Asuka period==
The introduction of Buddhism in 538 marked the transition from the Kofun to the Asuka period, which coincided with the reunification of China under the Sui dynasty later in the century. Japan became deeply influenced by Chinese culture, adding a cultural context to the religious distinction between the periods.

==Relations with other East Asian kingdoms==

===Chinese records===
According to the &quot;Book of Sui&quot;, Silla and Baekje greatly valued relations with the Kofun-period Wa and the Korean kingdoms made diplomatic efforts to maintain their good standing with the Japanese. The &quot;Book of Song&quot; reported that a Chinese emperor appointed the five kings of Wa in 451 to supervise military affairs of Wa, Silla, Imna, Gara, Jinhan and Mahan.

===Japanese records===
According to the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, Silla was conquered by the Japanese Empress-consort Jingū in the third century. However, due to lack of evidence, this story is considered to be mythological in nature. It reported that the prince of Silla came to Japan to serve the emperor of Japan, and lived in Tajima Province. Known as Amenohiboko, his descendant is Tajima Mori. According to &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, Geunchogo of Baekje presented stallions, broodmares and trainers to the Japanese emperor during Emperor Ōjin&#x27;s reign.

According to &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, Baekje had also sent a scholar by the name of Wani during the reign of Emperor Ōjin. He is said to be the pioneer of the introduction of the Chinese writing system to Japan.

===Korean records===
The &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; (&quot;Chronicles of the Three Kingdoms&quot;) reported that Baekje and Silla sent their princes as hostages to the Yamato court in exchange for military support to continue their military campaigns; King Asin of Baekje sent his son (Jeonji) in 397, and King Silseong of Silla sent his son Misaheun in 402. Hogong, from Japan, helped to found Silla.

== Genetics ==
In 2021, a research paper proposed a new theory as to the origins of the Japanese people. It suggested that the people of Japan bore genetic signatures from three ancient populations rather than just two as previously thought. The paper called this strand the &quot;Kofun strand&quot; based on the samples found in the period, and separated it from the pre-existing &quot;Jōmon&quot; and &quot;Yayoi strand&quot; forming the &quot;Tripartite ancestry theory&quot;.

However recently, the tripartite ancestry theory is being met with criticism since its introduction in 2021. In essence, Japanese researchers claim that a tripartite theory is redundant as the genetical difference between Yayoi and Kofun groups is not significant enough and that the temporal discrepancy of the periods is minuscule. See Japanese people&#x27;s Tripartite ancestry theory.

== Results of the Japan-South Korea Joint Historical Research ==
Under an agreement reached at the 2001 Japan-South Korea summit, Japanese and South Korean historians conducted joint historical research in two phases, including the relationship between Japan and the Korean Peninsula during the Kofun period. The point at issue was the &quot;Mimana Nihon-fu&quot; (任那日本府) which was said to be the governing institution Japan established in Korea at that time. After the controversy, Japanese and South Korean historians agreed that there were Japanese in the south of Korea and that the term &quot;Mimana Nihon-fu&quot; was not used at the time and should not be used as it was misleading. However, they could not agree on the position of the Japanese people in Korea at that time. The Japanese side claimed that the institutions established in Korea by the Japanese people were not under the control of Koreans, but were operated independently by the Japanese people and conducted diplomatic negotiations with the Gaya confederacy. On the other hand, the South Korean side claimed that the agency was the diplomatic office of Gaya, which employed the Japanese as bureaucrats of Gaya. The collaboration ended in 2010 with the publication of a final report describing the above. The full text of the minutes concerning the joint research is disclosed by the Japanese side.

<text>Wu Zetian (624 – 16 December 705), personal name Wu Zhao, was Empress of China from 660 to 705, ruling first through others and later in her own right. She ruled as empress consort through her husband Emperor Gaozong and later as empress dowager through her sons Emperors Zhongzong and Ruizong, from 660 to 690. She subsequently founded and ruled as Empress Regnant of the Wu Zhou dynasty of China from 16 October 690 to 21 February 705. She was the only female sovereign in the history of China widely regarded as legitimate. Under her 45-year reign, China grew larger, becoming one of the great powers of the world, its culture and economy were revitalized, and corruption in the court was reduced. She was eventually removed from power during a coup and died a few months later.

In early life, Wu was the concubine of Emperor Taizong. After his death, she married his ninth son and successor, Emperor Gaozong, officially becoming Gaozong&#x27;s &quot;huanghou&quot; (), or empress consort, the highest-ranking of the wives, in 655. Wu had considerable political power even before becoming empress consort, and began to control the court after her appointment. After Gaozong&#x27;s debilitating stroke in 660, she became administrator of the court, a position with similar authority to the emperor&#x27;s, until 683. History records that she &quot;was at the helm of the country for long years, her power is no different from that of the emperor.&quot; On Emperor Gaozong&#x27;s death in 683, rather than entering into retirement (as was customary for royal widows), or not interfering in the government (according to the emperor&#x27;s law, when he reaches the age of 17, he must rule by himself); Wu broke with tradition and took acquisition of complete power, refusing to allow any of her sons to rule. She took the throne in 690 by officially changing the name of the country from Tang to Zhou, changing the name of the royal family from Li to Wu, and holding a formal ceremony to crown herself as emperor.

Empress Wu is considered one of the greatest emperors in Chinese history due to her strong leadership and effective governance, which made China one of the world&#x27;s most powerful nations. The importance to history of her tenure includes the major expansion of the Chinese empire, extending it far beyond its previous territorial limits, deep into Central Asia, and engaging in a series of wars on the Korean Peninsula, first allying with Silla against Goguryeo, and then against Silla over the occupation of former Goguryeo territory. Within China, besides the more direct consequences of her struggle to gain and maintain power, Wu&#x27;s leadership resulted in important effects regarding social class in Chinese society and in relation to state support for Taoism, Buddhism, Confucianism, education and literature.

Wu played a key role in reforming the imperial examination system and encouraging capable officials to work in governance to maintain a peaceful and well-governed state. Effectively, these reforms improved her nation&#x27;s bureaucracy by ensuring that competence, rather than family connections, became a key feature of the civil service. Wu also had an important impact upon the statuary of the Longmen Grottoes and the &quot;Wordless Stele&quot; at the Qian Mausoleum, as well as the construction of some major buildings and bronze castings that no longer survive. Besides her career as a political leader, Wu also had an active family life. She was a mother of four sons, three of whom also carried the title of emperor, although one held that title only as a posthumous honor. One of her grandsons became the controversial Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, whose reign marked the turning point of the Tang dynasty into sharp decline.

== Names and titles ==

In Chinese history and literature, Wu Zetian () was known by various names and titles. Mention of her in the English language has only increased their number. A difficulty in English translations is that they tend to specify gender (as in the case of &quot;emperor&quot; versus &quot;empress&quot; or &quot;prince&quot; versus &quot;princess&quot;), whereas, in Classical Chinese, words such as &quot;hou&quot; (, &quot;sovereign&quot;, &quot;prince&quot;, &quot;queen&quot;) or &quot;huangdi&quot; , &quot;imperial supreme ruler&quot;, &quot;royal deity&quot;) are of grammatically indeterminate gender.

=== Names ===
In Wu&#x27;s time, women&#x27;s birth names were rarely recorded. She changed her name to Wu Zhao after rising to power, often written as , ( has also been written as on occasion, and both are derivatives of , which may be her original name), with 瞾 being one of the invented characters by Wu. Wu was her patronymic surname, which she retained, according to traditional Chinese practice, after marriage to Gaozong, of the Li family. Emperor Taizong gave her the art name Wu Mei (), meaning &quot;glamorous&quot;. Thus, Chinese people often refer to her as Wu Mei or Wu Meiniang () when they write about her youth, as Wu Hou () when referring to her as empress consort and empress dowager, and as Wu Zetian () when referring to her as empress regnant.

Because her family name, Wu (武), is a homophone for the second character in parrot (鹦鹉), there are many stories and jokes that make use of imagery of a parrot to communicate about Wu and her clan. In particular, Emperor Gaozong&#x27;s family name, Li (唐), is a homophone with a type of cat -- so a story circulated about a cat eating a parrot at court.

=== Titles ===
During her life, and posthumously, Wu was awarded various official titles. Both &quot;hou&quot; () and &quot;huangdi&quot; () are titles (modifications, or added characters to &quot;hou&quot; are of lesser importance). Born Wu Zhao, she is not properly known as &quot;Wu Hou&quot; (Empress Wu) until receiving this title in 655, nor is she properly known as &quot;Wu Zetian&quot;, her regnal name, until 690, when she took the title Emperor.

=== &quot;Empress&quot; ===
Various Chinese titles have been translated into English as &quot;empress&quot;, including &quot;empress&quot; in both the sense of empress consort and empress regnant. Generally, the monarch was male and his chief spouse was given a title such as &quot;huanghou&quot; (), often translated as &quot;empress&quot; or more specifically &quot;empress consort&quot;. Upon the emperor&#x27;s death, the surviving empress consort could become empress dowager, sometimes wielding considerable political power as regent during the minority of the (male) heir to the position of emperor.

Since the time of Qin Shi Huang (259–210 BC), the Emperor of China using the title &quot;huangdi&quot; (, translated as &quot;emperor&quot; or &quot;empress (regnant)&quot; as appropriate), Wu was the only woman in the history of China to assume the title &quot;huangdi&quot;. Her tenure as de facto ruler of China and official regent of the Tang dynasty (first through her husband and then through her sons, from 665 to 690) was not without precedent in Chinese history, but she broke precedent when she founded her own dynasty in 690, the Zhou () (interrupting the Tang dynasty), ruling personally under the name Sacred and Divine Huangdi (), and variations thereof, from 690 to 705.

Wu Zetian and Empress Dowager Liu of the Song dynasty are said to be the only women in Chinese history to have worn a yellow robe, ordinarily reserved for the emperor&#x27;s sole use, as a monarch or co-ruler in their own right.

== Background and early life ==
The Wu family clan originated in Wenshui County, Bingzhou (an ancient name of the city of Taiyuan, Shanxi). Wu Zetian&#x27;s birthplace is not documented in preserved historical literature and remains disputed. Some scholars argue that Wu was born in Wenshui, some that it was Lizhou () (modern-day Guangyuan, Sichuan), while others insist she was born in the imperial capital of Chang&#x27;an (today known as Xi&#x27;an).

Wu Zetian was born in the seventh year of the reign of Emperor Gaozu of Tang. In the same year, a total eclipse of the sun was visible across China. Her father, Wu Shiyue, worked in the timber business and the family was relatively well-off. Her mother was from the powerful Yang family, distant relatives of the imperial family of the Sui dynasty. During the final years of Emperor Yang of Sui, Li Yuan, the future Emperor Gaozu of Tang, stayed in the Wu household many times and became close to the Wu family while holding appointments in both Hedong and Taiyuan. After Li Yuan overthrew Emperor Yang, he was generous to the Wu family, giving them grain, land, clothing and wealth. Once the Tang dynasty was established, Wu Shihou held a succession of senior ministerial posts, including the governorship of Yangzhou, Lizhou, and Jingzhou () (modern-day Jiangling County, Hubei).

Wu was encouraged by her parents to read books and pursue her education, an uncommon situation for the women at the time. She read and learned about many topics, such as music, calligraphy, literature, history, politics, and other governmental affairs. At age 14, she was taken to be an imperial concubine (lesser wife) of Emperor Taizong of Tang. It was there that she became a type of secretary. This opportunity allowed her to continue to pursue her education. She was given the title of &quot;cairen&quot; (), the title for one of the consorts with the 5th rank in Tang&#x27;s nine-rank system for imperial officials, nobles, and consorts. When she was summoned to the palace, her mother, the Lady Yang, wept bitterly when saying farewell to her, but she responded, &quot;How do you know that it is not my fortune to meet the Son of Heaven?&quot; Lady Yang reportedly then understood her ambitions, and therefore stopped crying.

But Consort Wu did not appear to be much favored by Emperor Taizong, though it appears that she did have sexual relations with him at one point. According to her own account (given in a rebuke of Chancellor Ji Xu during her reign), she once impressed Taizong with her fortitude:

When Taizong died in 649, his youngest son, Li Zhi, whose mother was the main wife Wende, succeeded him as Emperor Gaozong. Li Zhi had had an affair with Wu when Taizong was still alive.

Taizong had 14 sons, including three by his beloved Empress Zhangsun (601–636), but none with Consort Wu. Thus, according to the custom by which consorts of deceased emperors who had not produced children were permanently confined to a monastic institution after the emperor&#x27;s death, Wu was consigned to Ganye Temple () with the expectation that she would serve as a Buddhist nun there for the remainder of her life. After Taizong&#x27;s death, Gaozong met her at the death anniversary of Taizong when he was offering incense. At the time, Consort Xiao and Empress Wang were fighting for favoredness of Gaozong, and Wang asked Gaozong to bring Wu back into the palace, hoping to divert Gaozong&#x27;s attention. Gaozong agreed and gave Wu the title Lady of Bright Deportment (). Soon, Gaozong became enamored with Wu, and both Wang and Xiao lost favor.

== Rise to power ==
By early 650, Consort Wu was a concubine of Emperor Gaozong, and she had the title Zhaoyi, the highest ranking concubine of the nine concubines in the second rank. Wu progressively gained immeasurable influence over the governance of the empire throughout Emperor Gaozong&#x27;s reign. Over time, she came to control most major decisions made. She was regarded as ruthless in her endeavors to grab power, and was believed by traditional historians to have killed her own children. This was later proven false, as these rumors seem to have surfaced 400 years after her death. This was likely due to the belief in ancient China that a woman wasn&#x27;t suited to hold the power of the emperor.
=== Imperial consort (650–655) ===
Gaozong became emperor at the age of 21. He was not the first choice, as he was inexperienced and frequently incapacitated with a sickness that caused him spells of dizziness. Gaozong was made heir to the empire only due to the disgrace of his two older brothers. 

On or after the anniversary of Emperor Taizong&#x27;s death, Gaozong went to Ganye Temple to offer incense to Buddha. When he and Consort Wu saw each other, they both wept. This was seen by Gaozong&#x27;s wife, Empress Wang. At that time, Gaozong did not favor Wang. Instead, he favored his concubine Pure Consort Xiao. Furthermore, Wang had no children while Xiao had one son (Li Sujie) and two daughters (Princesses Yiyang and Xuancheng). 

Wang, seeing that Gaozong was still impressed by Wu&#x27;s beauty, hoped that the arrival of a new concubine would divert the emperor from Xiao. Therefore, she secretly told Wu to stop shaving her hair and later welcomed her to the palace. (Some modern historians dispute this traditional account. Some think that Wu never left the imperial palace and might have had an affair with Gaozong while Taizong was still alive.)

Wu soon overtook Xiao as Gaozong&#x27;s favorite. In 652, she gave birth to her first child, a son named Li Hong. In 653, she gave birth to another son, Li Xián. Neither of these sons was in contention to be Gaozong&#x27;s heir, because Gaozong, at the request of officials influenced by Wang and her uncle (the chancellor Liu Shi), had designated his eldest son Li Zhong as his heir. Li Zhong&#x27;s mother, Consort Liu, was of lowly birth. Wang did this in order to receive Liu&#x27;s gratitude.

By 654, both Wang and Xiao had lost favor with Gaozong, and these two former romantic rivals joined forces against Wu, but to no avail. For example, as a sign of his love for Wu, Gaozong conferred posthumous honors on her father, Wu Shiyue. In the same year, Wu gave birth to a daughter. But her daughter died shortly after birth, with evidence suggesting deliberate strangulation. The evidence include allegations made by Wu herself, and she accused Wang of murder. Wang was accused of having been seen near the child&#x27;s room, with corroborating testimony by alleged eyewitnesses. Gaozong was led to believe that Wang, motivated by jealousy, had most likely killed the child. Wang lacked an alibi and was unable to clear her name.

Scientifically credible forensic pathology information about the death of Wu&#x27;s daughter does not exist, and scholars lack concrete evidence about her death. However, scholars have many theories and speculations. Because traditional folklore tends to portray Wu as a power-hungry woman unconcerned about whom she hurt or what she did, the most popular theory is that Wu killed her own child in order to accuse Wang. Other schools of thought argue that Wang indeed killed the child out of jealousy and hatred of Wu. The third argument is that the child died of asphyxiation or crib death. The ventilation systems of the time were nonexistent or of poor quality, and the lack of ventilation combined with using coal as a heating method could have led to carbon monoxide poisoning. In any case, Wu blamed Wang for the girl&#x27;s death, and as a result, tried to remove Wang from her position.

Because of the child&#x27;s death, an angry Gaozong also wanted to depose Wang and replace her with Wu. But first he needed to make sure that he had the support of the government chancellors. So Gaozong met with his uncle Zhangsun Wuji, the head chancellor. During the meeting, Gaozong repeatedly brought up Wang&#x27;s childlessness. Childlessness was a sufficient excuse to depose Wang, but Zhangsun repeatedly found ways to divert the conversation. Subsequent visits made by Wu&#x27;s mother, Lady Yang, and an official allied with Wu, Xu Jingzong, to seek support from Zhangsun were met with disappointment. 

In the summer of 655, Wu accused Wang and her mother, Lady Liu, of using witchcraft. In response, Gaozong barred Liu from the palace and demoted Wang&#x27;s uncle, Liu Shi. Meanwhile, a faction of officials began to form around Wu, including Li Yifu, Xu, Cui Yixuan (), and Yuan Gongyu (). That autumn, Gaozong summoned the chancellors Zhangsun, Li Ji, Yu Zhining, and Chu Suiliang to the palace. Chu had deduced that the summons were about changing the empress. Li Ji claimed illness and refused to attend. At the meeting, Chu vehemently opposed deposing Wang, while Zhangsun and Yu showed their disapproval by silence. Chancellors Han Yuan and Lai Ji also opposed the move. When Gaozong asked Li Ji again he responded, &quot;This is your family matter, Your Imperial Majesty. Why ask anyone else?&quot; 

Gaozong therefore resolved to demote Chu to commandant at Tan Prefecture (roughly modern Changsha, Hunan), and then deposed both Wang and Xiao. He placed them under arrest and made Wu empress. Later that year, Gaozong showed signs of considering their release. Because of this, Wang and Xiao were killed on Empress Wu&#x27;s orders. After their deaths, they often haunted Wu&#x27;s dreams over the years.

Wu came to believe their spirits were after her. For this reason, Emperor Gaozong started remodeling a secondary palace, Daming Palace (大明宮), into Penglai Palace (蓬萊宮). When Penglai Palace&#x27;s main hall, Hanyuan Hall (含元殿), was completed in 663, Gaozong and Wu moved there. It was later renamed Hanyuan Palace, yet Empress Wang and Consort Xiao still continued to appear in her dreams. Therefore, for the rest of Gaozong&#x27;s reign, he and Wu often took up residence at the eastern capital Luoyang and only infrequently spent time in Chang&#x27;an.

=== Empress consort ===
==== Involvement in politics (655–660) ====
In 655, Wu became Tang Gaozong&#x27;s new empress consort (, &quot;húanghòu&quot;). In 656, on the advice of Xu Jingzong, Emperor Gaozong deposed Consort Liu&#x27;s son Li Zhong from being his heir apparent. He changed Li Zhong&#x27;s status to Prince of Liang and designated Empress Wu&#x27;s son, Li Hong as the title of Prince of Dai and crown prince (that is, Heir Apparent). In 657, Empress Wu and her allies began reprisals against officials who had opposed her ascension. She first had Xu and Li Yifu, who were by now chancellors, falsely accuse Han Yuan and Lai Ji of being complicit with Chu Suiliang in planning treason. The three of them, along with Liu Shi, were demoted to being prefects of remote prefectures, with provisions that they would never be allowed to return to Chang&#x27;an. In 659, she had Xu accuse Zhangsun Wuji of plotting treason with the low-level officials Wei Jifang () and Li Chao (). Zhangsun was exiled and, later in the year, was forced to commit suicide in exile. Xu further implicated Chu, Liu, Han, and Yu Zhining in the plot as well. Chu, who had died in 658, was posthumously stripped of his titles, and his sons Chu Yanfu () and Chu Yanchong () were executed. Orders were also issued to execute Liu and Han, although Han died before the execution order reached his location.

It was said that after this time, no official dared to criticize the emperor. In 660, Li Zhong, Gaozong&#x27;s first-born son (to consort Liu) was targeted. Li Zhong had feared that he would be next and had sought out advice of fortune tellers. Wu had him exiled and placed under house arrest.

==== Ruling with Emperor Gaozong (660–683) ====
In 660, Emperor Gaozong and Empress Wu toured Bian Prefecture (modern-day Taiyuan), and Empress Wu had the opportunity to invite her old neighbors and relatives to a feast. Later that year, Emperor Gaozong began to suffer from an illness that carried the symptoms of painful headaches and loss of vision, generally thought to be hypertension-related. He began to have Empress Wu make rulings on daily petitions by officials. Thereafter, her authority rivaled Emperor Gaozong&#x27;s.

By 664, Wu was said to be interfering so much in the empire&#x27;s governance that she was angering Gaozong with her controlling behavior. Furthermore, she had engaged the Taoist sorcerer Guo Xingzhen () in using witchcraft—an act prohibited by regulations, which led to Empress Wang&#x27;s downfall—and the eunuch Wang Fusheng () reported this to Gaozong, angering him further. He consulted the chancellor Shangguan Yi, who suggested that he depose Wu. He had Shangguan draft an edict. But as Shangguan was doing so, Wu received news of what was happening. She went to the emperor to plead her case just as he was holding the edict that Shangguan had drafted. Gaozong could not bear to depose her and blamed the episode on Shangguan. As both Shangguan and Wang had served on Li Zhong&#x27;s staff, Wu had Xu falsely accuse Shangguan, Wang, and Li Zhong of planning treason. Shangguan, Wang, and Shangguan&#x27;s son Shangguan Tingzhi () were executed, while Li Zhong was forced to commit suicide. Shangguan Tingzhi&#x27;s daughter Shangguan Wan&#x27;er, then an infant, and her mother, Lady Zheng, became slaves in the inner palace. After Shangguan Wan&#x27;er grew up, she became Empress Wu&#x27;s trusted secretary.

She and Gaozong were thereafter referred to as the &quot;Two Saints&quot; (, &quot;Er Sheng&quot;) both inside the palace and in the empire. The Later Jin historian Liu Xu, in Old Book of Tang, commented:

Meanwhile, on Empress Wu&#x27;s account, her mother Lady Yang had been made the Lady of Rong, and her older sister, now widowed, the Lady of Han. Her half-brothers Wu Yuanqing and Wu Yuanshuang and cousins Wu Weiliang and Wu Huaiyun, despite the poor relationships that they had with Lady Yang, were promoted. But at a feast that Lady Yang held for them, Wu Weiliang offended Lady Yang by stating that they did not find it honorable for them to be promoted on account of Empress Wu. Empress Wu, therefore, requested to have them demoted to remote prefectures—outwardly to show modesty, but in reality to avenge the offense to her mother. Wu Yuanqing and Wu Yuanshuang died in effective exile. Meanwhile, in or before 666, Lady of Han died as well. After Lady of Han&#x27;s death, Emperor Gaozong made her daughter the Lady of Wei and considered keeping her in the palace—possibly as a concubine. He did not immediately do so, as he feared that Empress Wu would be displeased. It was said that Empress Wu heard of this and was nevertheless displeased. She had her niece poisoned, by placing poison in food offerings that Wu Weiliang and Wu Huaiyun had made and then blaming them for the death of the Lady of Wei. Wu Weiliang and Wu Huaiyun were executed.

In 670, Wu&#x27;s mother, Lady Yang, died, and by Gaozong&#x27;s and Wu&#x27;s orders, all of the imperial officials and their wives attended her wake and mourned her. Later that year, with the realm suffering from a major drought, Wu offered to be deposed, which Gaozong rejected. At her request, he further posthumously honored Wu Shiyue (who had previously been posthumously honored as the Duke of Zhou) and Lady Yang by giving them the titles of the Prince and Princess of Taiyuan.

Meanwhile, the son of Empress Wu&#x27;s older sister the Lady of Han, Helan Minzhi (), had been given the surname Wu and allowed to inherit the title of Duke of Zhou. But as it was becoming clear to Empress Wu that he suspected her of murdering his sister, the Lady of Wei, Wu began to take precautions against him. (Helan was also said to have had an incestuous relationship with his grandmother Lady Yang.) In 671, Helan was accused of disobeying mourning regulations during the period of mourning for Lady Yang and raping the daughter of the official Yang Sijian (), whom Gaozong and Wu had previously selected to be the wife and crown princess for Li Hong. On Wu&#x27;s orders, Helan was exiled and either was executed in exile or committed suicide. In 673, Wu provided 20,000 cash for a gigantic statue of Maitreya at Longmen Grottoes. In 674, she had Wu Yuanshuang&#x27;s son Wu Chengsi recalled from exile to inherit the title of Duke of Zhou.
In 675, as Emperor Gaozong&#x27;s illness worsened, he considered having Empress Wu formally rule as regent. The chancellor Hao Chujun and the official Li Yiyan both opposed this, and he did not formally make her regent, and did not formally bestow she with such authorities. But the Empress Wu&#x27;s as so powerful that she even surpassed Emperor Gaozong and he was afraid of Wu because of her high intelligence and skills in manipulating officials; thus, until the end of his reign, she has decision-making power on most events in the governmental and border matters, and appoints civil ministers and military generals.

Also in 675, a number of people fell victim to Empress Wu&#x27;s ire. She had been displeased at the favor that Emperor Gaozong had shown his aunt, Princess Changle. Changle was married to General Zhao Gui () and had a daughter who became the wife and princess consort of Wu&#x27;s third son, Li Xiǎn, the Prince of Zhou. Princess Zhao was accused of unspecified crimes and placed under arrest, eventually starving to death. Zhao Gui and Changle were exiled. Meanwhile, later that month, Li Hong, the Crown Prince—who urged Wu not to exercise so much influence and authority on Gaozong&#x27;s governance and offended her by requesting that his half-sisters, Consort Xiao&#x27;s daughters, Princess Yiyang and Xuancheng (under house arrest) be allowed to marry—died suddenly. Traditional historians generally believed that Wu poisoned Li Hong to death. At her request, Li Xián, then carrying the title of Prince of Yong, was created crown prince. Meanwhile, Consort Xiao&#x27;s son Li Sujie and another son of Gaozong&#x27;s, Li Shangjin, were repeatedly accused of crimes by Wu and were subsequently demoted.

Soon, Empress Wu&#x27;s relationship with Li Xián also deteriorated because Li Xián had become unsettled after hearing rumors that he was not born to Empress Wu—but to her sister, the Lady of Han. When Empress Wu heard of his fearfulness, she became angry with him. In 678, contemporary poet Luo Binwang criticizes Empress Wu&#x27;s involvement in governmental affairs: &quot;She whispered slander from behind her sleeves, and swayed emperor with vixen flirting.&quot; Luo Binwang remarks angered Empress Wu and he dismissed and imprisoned.
Furthermore, the sorcerer Ming Chongyan (), whom both she and Emperor Gaozong respected, had stated that Li Xián was unsuitable to inherit the throne and was assassinated in 679. The assassins were not caught—causing Wu to suspect that Li Xián was behind the assassination. In 680, Li Xián was accused of crimes and during an investigation by the officials Xue Yuanchao, Pei Yan, and Gao Zhizhou, a large number of weaponry was found in Li Xián&#x27;s palace. Empress Wu formally accused Li Xián of treason and the assassination of Ming. Emperor Gaozong wanted to forgive Li Xián for treason, but Empress Wu refused and he surrendered at her insistence. Li Xián was deposed and exiled, and at her request, he was placed under house arrest as a normal person.

At Empress Wu&#x27;s request, after the exile of Li Xián, his younger brother Li Xiǎn [similar-sounding name but different Chinese characters] (now renamed Li Zhe) was named crown prince.

In 681, Princess Taiping was married to Xue Shao (), the son of Emperor Gaozong&#x27;s sister Princess Chengyang, in a grand ceremony. Empress Wu, initially unimpressed with the lineages of Xue Shao&#x27;s brothers&#x27; wives, wanted to order his brothers to divorce their wives—stopping only after it was pointed out to her that Lady Xiao, the wife of Xue Shao&#x27;s older brother Xue Yi (), was a grandniece of the deceased chancellor Xiao Yu. The official Feng Yuanchang was appointed by Gaozong, and he trusted him very much. In 682, Feng also lamented Empress Wu&#x27;s power and involvement in the administration of the empire and told the emperor: &quot;The queen&#x27;s authority is very strong, should it be reduced?&quot; Gaozong opposed it, and he was afraid of her, and there was nothing he could do. Upon learning of Feng&#x27;s ineffective advice to the emperor, Wu became very angry with Feng, and accused him of corruption and degraded him.

In late 683, Gaozong died at Luoyang. Li Zhe took the throne as Emperor Zhongzong, but Wu retained the real authority as empress dowager and regent.

=== Empress dowager ===
====Plenipotentiary regent for Emperor Zhongzong ====
Upon the death of her husband Emperor Gaozong, Wu became empress dowager (, &quot;húangtàihòu&quot;) and then regent and she automatically gained full power over the empire. She had the power to remove and install emperors. Just as before, government decisions were made by her. Wu had already poisoned the crown prince Li Hong and had enough other princes exiled that her third son, Li Zhe, was made heir apparent. Furthermore, Gaozong&#x27;s will included provisions that Li Zhe should ascend immediately to the imperial throne, he should look to Empress Wu in regards to any important matter, either military or civil, and Empress Wu should claim the senior authority in the Empire for herself. In the second month of 684, Li Zhe ascended to the imperial throne, known as his temple name Zhongzong, for a short six weeks.

The new emperor was married to a woman of the Wei family. Because Zhongzong was as weak and incompetent as his father, the new Empress sought to place herself in the same position of great authority that Empress Wu had enjoyed.

Immediately, Emperor Zhongzong showed signs of disobeying Empress Dowager Wu. Emperor Zhongzong was under the thumb of his wife, Empress Wei. Under her influence, the Emperor, appointed his father-in-law as prime minister. He also tried to make his father-in-law &quot;Shizhong&quot; (, the head of the examination bureau of government, , &quot;Menxia Sheng&quot;, and a post considered one for a chancellor) and gave a mid-level office to his wet nurse&#x27;s son—despite stern opposition by the chancellor Pei Yan, at one point remarking to Pei:

Pei reported this to Empress Dowager Wu, and she, after planning with Pei, Liu Yizhi, and the generals Cheng Wuting () and Zhang Qianxu (), deposed Emperor Zhongzong and replaced him with her youngest son, Li Dan, the Prince of Yu (as Emperor Ruizong). Wu had Zhongzong&#x27;s father-in-law, Wei Xuanzhen (), brought up on charges of treason. Wei Xuanzhen was sent into seclusion. Zhongzong was reduced to the title of Prince of Luling and exiled. Wu also sent General Qiu Shenji () to Li Xián&#x27;s place in exile and forced Li Xián to commit suicide.

====Plenipotentiary regent for Emperor Ruizong ====
Wu was the absolute ruler in both substance and appearance during the reign of her youngest son, Emperor Ruizong. She did not follow the customary pretense of hiding behind a screen or curtain and, in whispers, issued commands for the nominal ruler to formally announce. Her reign was fully recognized. Ruizong never moved into the imperial quarters, or appeared at imperial function, and remained a virtual prisoner in the inner quarters. He held the title of emperor, but Wu firmly controlled the imperial court, and officials were not allowed to meet with Ruizong, nor was he allowed to rule on matters of state. It was to Wu that officials reported, with Ruizong not even nominally approving official actions. Soon after Ruizong took the throne, Wu carried out a major renaming of governmental offices and banners. Wu elevated Luoyang&#x27;s status, making it a coequal capital. At her nephew Wu Chengsi&#x27;s suggestion, she expanded the shrine of the Wu ancestors and gave them greater posthumous honors, and made Wu&#x27;s ancestral shrine the size of the emperor&#x27;s ancestral shrine.

Soon thereafter, Li Ji&#x27;s grandson Li Jingye, the Duke of Ying, who had been disaffected by his own exile, started a rebellion at Yang Prefecture (, roughly modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu). The rebellion initially drew popular support in the region, but Li Jingye progressed slowly in his attack and did not take advantage of that support. Meanwhile, Pei suggested to Empress Dowager Wu that she return imperial authority to the Emperor, arguing that doing so would cause the rebellion to collapse on its own. This offended Wu, and she accused him of being complicit with Li Jingye and had him executed; she also demoted, exiled, and killed a number of officials who, when Pei was arrested, tried to speak on his behalf. She sent General Li Xiaoyi () to attack Li Jingye, and while Li Xiaoyi was initially unsuccessful, he pushed on at the urging of his assistant Wei Yuanzhong and eventually crushed Li Jingye&#x27;s forces. Li Jingye fled and was killed in flight.

By 685, Empress Dowager Wu was having an affair with the Buddhist monk Huaiyi, and over the next few years, Huaiyi received progressively greater honors. In 686, Wu offered to return imperial authorities to Emperor Ruizong, but Ruizong, knowing that she did not truly intend to do so, declined, and she continued to exercise imperial authority. Meanwhile, she installed copper mailboxes outside the imperial government buildings to encourage the people of the realm to report secretly on others, as she suspected many officials of opposing her. Wu personally read all the reports of betrayal. Secret police officials, including Suo Yuanli, Zhou Xing, and Lai Junchen, began to rise in power and carry out systematic false accusations, torture, and executions.

In 688, Empress Dowager Wu was set to make sacrifices to the deity of the Luo River (, flowing through the Henan province city of Luoyang, then the &quot;Eastern Capital&quot;). She summoned senior members of Tang&#x27;s Li imperial clan to Luoyang. Worried that she planned to slaughter them and secure the throne for herself, the imperial princes plotted to resist her. But before a rebellion could be comprehensively planned, Li Zhen and his son Li Chong, the Prince of Langye rose first, at their respective posts as prefects of Yu Prefecture (, roughly modern Zhumadian, Henan) and Bo Prefecture (, roughly modern Liaocheng, Shandong). The other princes were not yet ready, and did not rise, and forces sent by Empress Dowager Wu and the local forces crushed Li Chong and Li Zhen&#x27;s forces quickly. Wu took this opportunity to arrest Emperor Gaozong&#x27;s granduncles Li Yuanjia () the Prince of Han, Li Lingkui () the Prince of Lu, and Princess Changle, as well as many other members of the Li clan, and forced them to commit suicide. Even Princess Taiping&#x27;s husband Xue Shao was implicated and starved to death. In the subsequent years, there continued to be many politically motivated massacres of officials and Li clan members.

In 690, Wu took the final step to become the empress regnant of the newly proclaimed Zhou dynasty, and the title &quot;Huangdi&quot;. Traditional Chinese order of succession (akin to the Salic law in Europe) did not allow a woman to ascend the throne, but Wu was determined to quash the opposition and the use of the secret police continued after she took the throne. While her organization of the civil service system was criticized for its laxity of the promotion of officials, Wu was still considered capable of evaluating the officials&#x27; performance once they were in office. The Song dynasty historian Sima Guang, in his &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;, writes:
== As empress regnant==
In 690, Wu had Emperor Ruizong yield the throne to her and established the Zhou dynasty, with herself as the imperial ruler (&quot;Huangdi&quot;).

The early part of her reign was characterized by secret police terror, which moderated as the years went by. On the other hand, she was recognized as a capable and attentive ruler even by traditional historians who despised her, and her ability to select capable men to serve as officials was admired for the rest of the Tang dynasty as well as in subsequent dynasties.

Wu Zetian&#x27;s reign was a pivotal moment for the imperial examination system. The reason for this was because up until that point, the Tang rulers had all been male members of the Li family. Wu Zetian, who officially took the title of emperor in 690, was a woman outside the Li family who needed an alternative base of power. Reform of the imperial examinations featured prominently in her plan to create a new class of elite bureaucrats derived from humbler origins. Both the palace and military examinations were created under Wu Zetian which were based solely on merit.

=== Early reign (690–696) ===
Shortly after Wu took the throne in her newly established dynasty, she elevated the status of Buddhism above that of Taoism. She officially sanctioned Buddhism by building temples named Dayun Temple () in each prefecture belonging to the capital regions of the two capitals, Luoyang and Chang&#x27;an, and created nine senior monks as dukes. She enshrined seven generations of Wu ancestors at the imperial ancestral temple, while continuing to offer sacrifices to the Tang emperors Gaozu, Taizong, and Gaozong.

Wu faced the issue of succession. At the time she took the throne, she created Li Dan, the former Emperor Ruizong, crown prince, and bestowed the name Wu on him. The official Zhang Jiafu convinced the commoner Wang Qingzhi () to start a petition drive to make her nephew Wu Chengsi crown prince, arguing that an emperor named Wu should pass the throne to a member of the Wu clan. Wu Zetian was tempted to do so, and when the chancellors Cen Changqian and Ge Fuyuan opposed sternly, they, along with fellow chancellor Ouyang Tong, were executed. She ultimately declined Wang&#x27;s request to make Wu Chengsi crown prince, but for a time allowed Wang to freely enter the palace to see her.

On one occasion, when Wang angered her by coming to the palace too much, she asked the official Li Zhaode to batter Wang as punishment. Li Zhaode exploited the opportunity to batter Wang to death, and his group of petitioners scattered. Li Zhaode then persuaded Wu Zetian to keep Li Dan as crown prince—pointing out that a son was closer in relations than a nephew, and that if Wu Chengsi became emperor, Gaozong would never again be worshiped. Wu Zetian agreed, and for some time did not reconsider the matter. At Li Zhaode&#x27;s warning that Wu Chengsi was becoming too powerful, Wu Zetian stripped Wu Chengsi of his chancellor authority and bestowed on him largely honorific titles without authority.

Meanwhile, the secret police officials&#x27; power continued to increase, until they appeared to be curbed, starting in about 692, when Lai Junchen was foiled in his attempt to have the chancellors Ren Zhigu, Di Renjie, Pei Xingben, and other officials Cui Xuanli (), Lu Xian (), Wei Yuanzhong, and Li Sizhen () executed. Di, under arrest, had hidden a secret petition inside a change of clothes and had it submitted by his son Di Guangyuan (). The seven were exiled. After this incident, particularly at the urging of Li Zhaode, Zhu Jingze, and Zhou Ju (), the waves of politically motivated massacres decreased, although they did not end entirely. Wu Zetian utilized the imperial examination system to find talented poor people or people without backgrounds to stabilize her regime.

Also in 692, Wu Zetian commissioned the general Wang Xiaojie to attack the Tibetan Empire. Wang recaptured the four garrisons of the Western Regions that had fallen to the Tibetan Empire in 670 – Kucha, Yutian, Kashgar, and Suyab.

In 693, after Wu&#x27;s trusted lady-in-waiting Wei Tuan&#x27;er (), who hated Li Dan because he rejected her advances, falsely accused Li Dan&#x27;s wife Crown Princess Liu and Consort Dou of using witchcraft, Wu had Crown Princess Liu and Consort Dou killed. Li Dan, fearful that he was next, did not dare speak of them. When Wei planned to falsely accuse Li Dan, someone informed on her, and she was executed. Wu had Li Dan&#x27;s sons demoted in their princely titles. When the officials Pei Feigong () and Fan Yunxian () were accused of secretly meeting Li Dan, she executed Pei and Fan and further barred officials from meeting Li Dan.

There were then accusations that Li Dan was plotting treason. Under Wu&#x27;s direction, Lai launched an investigation. He arrested Li Dan&#x27;s servants and tortured them. The torture was such that many of them were ready to falsely implicate themselves and Li Dan. One of Li Dan&#x27;s servants, An Jincang, proclaimed Li Dan&#x27;s innocence and cut his own belly open to swear to that fact. When Wu heard what An did, she had doctors attend to An and barely saved his life, and then ordered Lai to end the investigation, saving Li Dan.

In 694, Li Zhaode, who had become powerful after Wu Chengsi&#x27;s removal, was thought to be too powerful, and Wu Zetian removed him. Also around this time, she became highly impressed with a group of mystic individuals—the hermit Wei Shifang (on whom she bestowed a chancellor title briefly), who claimed to be more than 350 years old; an old Buddhist nun who claimed to be a Buddha and capable of predicting the future; and a non-Han man who claimed to be 500 years old. During this time, Wu briefly claimed to be and adopted the cult imagery of Maitreya in order to build popular support for her reign.

In 695, after the imperial meeting hall () and the Heavenly Hall () were burned by Huaiyi, who was jealous at Wu&#x27;s taking another lover, the imperial physician Shen Nanqiu (), Wu became angry at these mystics for failing to predict the fire. The old nun and her students were arrested and made into slaves. Wei committed suicide. The old non-Han man fled. Wu put Huaiyi to death. After this incident, she appeared to pay less attention to mysticism and became even more dedicated than before to the affairs of state.

=== Middle reign (696–701) ===
Wu&#x27;s administration soon faced various troubles on the western and northern borders. In spring 696 she sent an army commanded by Wang Xiaojie and Lou Shide against the Tibetan Empire, which was soundly defeated by Tibetan generals, the brothers Gar Trinring Tsendro () and Gar Tsenba (). As a result, she demoted Wang to commoner rank and Lou to a low-level prefectural official, though she eventually restored both to general positions. In April of the same year, Wu recast the Nine Tripod Cauldrons, the symbol of ultimate power in ancient China, to reinforce her authority.

A much more serious threat arose in summer 696. The Khitan chieftains Li Jinzhong and Sun Wanrong, brothers-in-law, angry over the mistreatment of the Khitan people by the Zhou official Zhao Wenhui (), the prefect of Ying Prefecture (, roughly Zhaoyang County, Liaoning), rebelled, with Li assuming the title of Wushang Khan (). Armies that Wu sent to suppress Li and Sun&#x27;s rebellion were defeated by Khitan forces, which attacked Zhou proper. Meanwhile, Qapaghan Qaghan of the Second Turkic Khaganate offered to submit, while also launching attacks against Zhou and Khitan. The attacks included one against the Khitan base of operations during the winter of 696, shortly after Li&#x27;s death, which resulted in the capturing of Li&#x27;s and Sun&#x27;s families and temporarily halted Khitan operations against Zhou.

Sun, after taking over as khan and reorganizing Khitan forces, again attacked Zhou territory and had many victories over Zhou forces, including a battle during which Wang Shijie was killed. Wu tried to allay the situation by making peace with Ashina Mochuo on fairly costly terms—the return of Tujue people who had previously submitted to Zhou and providing Mochuo with seeds, silk, tools, and iron. In summer 697, Mochuo launched another attack on Khitan&#x27;s base of operations, and this time, after his attack, Khitan forces collapsed and Sun was killed in flight, ending the Khitan threat.

Meanwhile, also in 697, Lai Junchen, who had at one point lost power but then returned to power, falsely accused Li Zhaode (who had been pardoned) of crimes, and then planned to falsely accuse Li Dan, Li Zhe, the Wu clan princes, and Princess Taiping of treason. The Wu clan princes and Princess Taiping acted first against him, accusing him of crimes, and he and Li Zhaode were executed together. After Lai&#x27;s death, the secret police&#x27;s reign largely ended. Gradually, many of the victims of Lai and the other secret police officials were exonerated posthumously. Meanwhile, around this time, Wu began relationships with two new lovers—the brothers Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong, who became honored within the palace and were eventually created dukes.

Around 698, Wu Chengsi and another nephew of Wu Zetian&#x27;s, Wu Sansi, the Prince of Liang, repeatedly made attempts to have officials persuade Wu Zetian to make one of them crown prince—again arguing that an emperor should pass the throne to someone of the same clan. But Di Renjie, who by now had become a trusted chancellor, firmly opposed the idea, and proposed that Li Zhe be recalled instead. He was supported in this by fellow chancellors Wang Fangqing and Wang Jishan, as well as Wu Zetian&#x27;s close advisor Ji Xu, who further persuaded the Zhang brothers to support the idea. In spring 698, Wu agreed and recalled Li Zhe from exile. Soon, Li Dan offered to yield the crown prince position to Li Zhe, and Wu created Li Zhe crown prince. She soon changed his name back to Li Xiǎn and then Wu Xian.

Later, Ashina Mochuo demanded a Tang dynasty prince for marriage to his daughter, part of a plot to join his family with the Tang, displace the Zhou, and restore Tang rule over China, under his influence. When Wu sent a member of her own family, grandnephew Wu Yanxiu (), to marry Mochuo&#x27;s daughter instead, he rejected him. Mochuo had no intention to cement the peace treaty with a marriage. Instead, when Wu Yanxiu arrived, he detained him and then launched a major attack on Zhou, advancing as far south as Zhao Prefecture (, in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei) before withdrawing.

In 699, the Tibetan threat ceased. Emperor Tridu Songtsen, unhappy that Gar Trinring was monopolizing power, slaughtered Trinring&#x27;s associates when Trinring was away from Lhasa. He then defeated Trinring in battle, and Trinring committed suicide. Gar Tsenba and Trinring&#x27;s son, Lun Gongren (), surrendered to Zhou. After this, the Tibetan Empire underwent internal turmoil for several years, and there was peace for Zhou in the border region.

Also in 699, Wu, realizing that she was growing old, feared that after her death, Li Xian and the Wu clan princes would not have peace with each other. She made him, Li Dan, Princess Taiping, Princess Taiping&#x27;s second husband Wu Youji (a nephew of hers), the Prince of Ding, and other Wu clan princes to swear an oath to each other.

=== Late reign (701–705) ===
As Wu grew older, Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong became increasingly powerful, and even the princes of the Wu clan sought their favour. She increasingly relied on them to handle the affairs of state. This was secretly discussed and criticized by her grandson Li Chongrun, the Prince of Shao (Li Xian&#x27;s son), granddaughter Li Xianhui () the Lady Yongtai (Li Chongrun&#x27;s sister), and Li Xianhui&#x27;s husband Wu Yanji () the Prince of Wei (Wu Zetian&#x27;s grandnephew and Wu Chengsi&#x27;s son). Somehow the discussion was leaked, and Zhang Yizhi reported this to Wu. She ordered the three of them to commit suicide. 

Despite her age, Wu continued to be interested in finding talented officials and promoting them. People she promoted in her old age included Cui Xuanwei and Zhang Jiazhen.

By 703, Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong had become resentful of Wei Yuanzhong, who by now was a senior chancellor, for dressing down their brother Zhang Changyi () and rejecting the promotion of another brother, Zhang Changqi (). They also were fearful that if Wu died, Wei would find a way to execute them, and therefore accused Wei and Gao Jian (), an official favored by Princess Taiping, of speculating on Wu&#x27;s old age and death. They initially got Wei&#x27;s subordinate Zhang Shuo to agree to corroborate the charges, but once Zhang Shuo was before Wu, he instead accused Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong of forcing him to bear false witness. As a result, Wei, Gao, and Zhang Shuo were exiled, but escaped death.

== Removal and death ==
In autumn 704, accusations of corruption began to be levelled against Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong, as well as their brothers Zhang Changqi, Zhang Changyi, and Zhang Tongxiu (). Zhang Tongxiu and Zhang Changyi were demoted, but even though the officials Li Chengjia () and Huan Yanfan advocated that Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong be removed as well, Wu Zetian, taking the suggestion of the chancellor Yang Zaisi, did not do so. Subsequently, charges of corruption against Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong were renewed by the chancellor Wei Anshi.
In winter 704, Wu Zetian became seriously ill for a period, and only the Zhang brothers were allowed to see her; the chancellors were not. This led to speculation that Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong were plotting to take over the throne, and there were repeated accusations of treason. Once her condition improved, Cui Xuanwei advocated that only Li Xian and Li Dan be allowed to attend to her—a suggestion she did not accept. After further accusations against the Zhang brothers by Huan and Song Jing, Wu allowed Song to investigate, but before the investigation was completed, she issued a pardon for Zhang Yizhi, derailing Song&#x27;s investigation.

By spring 705, Wu was seriously ill again. Zhang Jianzhi, Jing Hui, and Yuan Shuji planned a coup to kill the Zhang brothers. They convinced the generals Li Duozuo, Li Zhan (), and Yang Yuanyan () and another chancellor, Yao Yuanzhi, to be involved. With agreement from Li Xian as well, they acted on 20 February, killing Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong, and had Changsheng Hall (), where Wu was residing, surrounded. They then reported to her that the Zhang brothers had been executed for treason, and forced her to yield the throne to Li Xian. On 21 February, an edict was issued in her name that made Li Xian regent, and on 22 February, an edict was issued in her name passing the throne to him. On 23 February, Li Xian formally retook the throne, and the next day, under heavy guard, Wu was moved to the subsidiary palace, Shangyang Palace (), while still honored with the title of Empress Regent Zetian Dasheng (). On 3 March, the restoration of the Tang dynasty was celebrated, thus ending the Zhou.

Wu died on 16 December, and, pursuant to a final edict issued in her name, was no longer called empress regnant, but instead &quot;Empress Consort Zetian Dasheng&quot; (). In 706, Wu&#x27;s son Emperor Zhongzong had his father, Emperor Gaozong and Wu interred in a joint burial at the Qianling Mausoleum, near the capital Chang&#x27;an on Mount Liang. Zhongzong also buried at Qianling his brother Li Xián, son Li Chongrun, and daughter Li Xianhui () the Lady Yongtai (posthumously honored as the Princess Yongtai)—victims of Wu&#x27;s wrath.

== Wu Zhou dynasty ==

In 690, Wu Zetian founded the Wu Zhou dynasty, named after the historical Zhou dynasty (1046–256 BC). The traditional historical view is to discount the Wu Zhou dynasty: dynasties by definition involve the succession of rulers from one family, and the Wu Zhou dynasty was founded by Wu and ended within her lifetime, with her abdication in 705. The alternative is to view the Wu Zhou dynasty as the revival of the historical Zhou dynasty, which was ruled (at least nominally) by the Ji family, almost a thousand years before. Either way, the Wu Zhou dynasty was a brief interruption of the Li family&#x27;s Tang dynasty, not a fully realized dynasty. But Wu&#x27;s claim to found a new dynasty was little opposed at the time (690). The 15-year period that Wu designated as her &quot;Zhou dynasty&quot;, considered in the context of nearly a half century of &quot;de facto&quot; and &quot;de jure&quot; rule (–705), reveals a remarkable and still debated period of history. In this context, designating a new dynasty with her as emperor can be seen as part of her power politics and as the culmination of her rule. Though Wu&#x27;s Zhou dynasty had its own notable characteristics, they are difficult to separate from Wu&#x27;s reign of power, which lasted for about half of a century.

Wu&#x27;s consolidation of power in part relied on a system of spies. She used informants to choose people to eliminate, a process that peaked in 697 with the wholesale demotion, exile, or killing of various aristocratic families and scholars, furthermore prohibiting their sons from holding office.

Wu eliminated many of her real, potential, or perceived rivals to power by means of death (including execution, suicide by command, and more or less directly killing people), demotion, and exile. Mostly this was carried out by her secret police, led by people like Wao Ganjun and Lai Junchen, who were known to have written the &quot;Manual of Accusation&quot;, a document detailing steps for interrogation and obtaining confessions by torture. One of these methods, the &quot;Dying Swine&#x27;s Melancholy&quot; (), which merely indicated a level of pain inflicted by a torture device, seems to have been conflated in the years following Wu&#x27;s death with the story of the &quot;human swine&quot; torture conducted by Empress Lü Zhi, in which her victim had her eyes gouged out, hands and feet chopped off, ears burnt, and was imprisoned in a latrine.

Wu targeted various people, including many in her own family. In reaction to an attempt to remove her from power, in 684, she massacred 12 entire collateral branches of the imperial family. Besides this, she also altered the ancient balance of power in China dating to the Qin dynasty. The old area of the Qin state was later called Guanzhong—literally, the area &quot;within the fortified mountain passes&quot;. From this area of northwest China, the Ying family of Qin arose, unifying China into its first historical empire. During the Han dynasty, Sima Qian records in his &quot;Shiji&quot; that Guanzhong had three-tenths of China&#x27;s population but six-tenths of its wealth. Additionally, at the beginning of Wu&#x27;s ascendency, Guanzhong was still the stronghold of the most nationally powerful aristocratic families, even though economic development in other parts of China had improved the lot of families in other regions. The Guangzhong aristocracy was not willing to relinquish its hold on the reins of government, but some of the more newly wealthy families in other areas, such as the North China Plain or Hubei, were eager for a larger share of national power. Most of the opposition to Wu was from the Guangzhong families of northwest China. Accordingly, she repressed them, instead favoring less privileged families, thus raising to the ranks of power many talented but less aristocratic families, often recruited through the official examination system. Many of those so favored originated from the North China plain. Through a process of eliminating or diminishing the power of the established aristocracy, whom she perceived as disloyal to her, and establishing a reformed upper class in China loyal to her, Wu made major social changes that historians are still evaluating.

Many of Wu&#x27;s measures were popular and helped her to gain support for her rule. Wu came to power during a time in China in which the people were fairly contented, the administration was run well, and the economy was characterized by rising living standards. For the most part, as far as the masses were concerned, Wu continued in this manner. She was determined that free, self-sufficient farmers continue to work their own land, so she periodically used the &quot;juntian&quot;, equal-field system, together with updated census figures to ensure fair land allocations, reallocating as necessary. Much of her success was due to her various edicts (including those known as her &quot;Acts of Grace&quot;), which helped satisfy the needs of the lower classes through various acts of relief, her widening recruitment to government service to include previously excluded gentry and commoners, and her generous promotions and pay raises for the lower ranks.

Wu used her military and diplomatic skills to enhance her position. The &quot;fubing&quot; system of self-supportive soldier-farmer colonies, which provided local militia and labor services for her government, allowed her to maintain her armed forces at reduced expense. She also pursued a policy of military action to expand the empire to its furthest extent ever up to that point in Central Asia. Expansion efforts against Tibet and to the northwest were less successful. Allying with the Korean kingdom of Silla against Goguryeo with the promise of ceding Goguryeo&#x27;s territory to Silla, Chinese forces occupied Goguryeo after its defeat, and even began to occupy Silla territory. Silla resisted the imposition of Chinese rule, and by allying with Goguryeo and Baekche, was able to expel its former ally from the peninsula. Hong argues that Silla&#x27;s success was in part due to a shift in Wu&#x27;s focus to Tibet and inadequate support for the forces in the Korean peninsula. In 694, Wu&#x27;s forces decisively defeated the Tibetan–Western Turk alliance and retook the Four Garrisons of Anxi.

In 651, shortly after the Muslim conquest of Persia, the first Arab ambassador arrived in China.

===Reform of the imperial examination system===
One apparatus of government that fell into Wu&#x27;s power was the imperial examination system, the basic theory and practice of which was to recruit into government service those men who were the best educated, most talented, and had the best potential to perform their duties, and to do so by testing a pool of candidates to determine this. This pool was male only, and the qualified pool of candidates and resulting placements into official positions was on a relatively small scale at the time Wu took control of government. The official tests examined things considered important for functionaries of the highly developed, bureaucratic government structure of the imperial government, such as level of literacy in terms of reading and writing and possession of the specific knowledge considered necessary and desirable for a governmental official, such as Confucian precepts on the nature of virtue and theory on the proper ordering of and relationships within society. Wu continued to use the imperial examination system to recruit civil servants, and introduced major changes to the system she inherited, including increasing the pool of candidates permitted to take the test by allowing commoners and gentry, previously disqualified by their background, to take it. In 693, she expanded the governmental examination system and greatly increased the importance of this method of recruiting government officials. Wu provided increased opportunity for the representation within government to people of the North China Plain versus people of the northwestern aristocratic families (whom she decimated, anyway); and the successful candidates recruited through the examination system became an elite group within her government. The historical details of the consequences of Wu&#x27;s promoting a new group of people from previously disenfranchised backgrounds into prominence as powerful governmental officials, and the examination system&#x27;s role, remain debated by scholars of this subject.

== Religion ==
=== The Great Cloud Sutra ===
Wu Zetian used her political powers to harness from Buddhist practices a strategy to build sovereignty and legitimacy to her throne while decisively establishing the Zhou dynasty in a society under Confucian and patriarchal ideals. One of the first steps she took to legitimize her ascension to the throne was to proclaim herself as the reincarnation of the Devi of Pure Radiance (&quot;Jingguang tiannü)&quot; through a series of prophecies. In 690, Wu sought out the support of the monk Xue Huaiyi, her reputed lover, and other nine orthodox Buddhist monks, to compose the apocryphal &quot;Commentary on the Meanings of the Prophecies About the Divine Sovereign in the Great Cloud Sutra&quot; (&quot;Dayunjing Shenhuang Shouji Yishu&quot;).

Translated from a late fourth-century version in Sanskrit to Chinese, the original &quot;Great Cloud Sutra&quot; (&quot;Dayunjing&quot;) accentuated in Wu&#x27;s &quot;Commentary&quot; had fascicles describing a conversation between the Buddha and the Devi of Pure Radiance. In the sutra, the Buddha foretells to &quot;Jingguang&quot; that he would be a bodhisattva reincarnated in a woman&#x27;s body in order to convert beings and rule over the territory of a country. Wu&#x27;s Buddhist supporters meticulously propagated the &quot;Commentary&quot; &quot;on the eve of her accession to the dragon throne&quot; while seeking to justify the various events that led Wu to occupy the position of &quot;Huangdi&quot; as a female ruler and bodhisattva. Since gender in the Buddhist Devi worlds have no standard form, Wu later took a further step to transcend her gender limitations by identifying herself as the incarnation of two important male Buddhist divinities, Maitreya and Vairocana. Her narrative was intentionally crafted to persuade the Confucian establishment, circumvent the Five Impediments that restricted women from holding political and religious power, and gain public support.

=== Indian influences ===
According to William Dalrymple, Wu used Buddhist texts brought from Nalanda University by Xuanzang to legitimise her rule, and her reign resulted in a substantial importation of Indian ideas. Under her, Buddhism became a state religion, and slaughter of animals was strictly prohibited. Wu also implemented several Indian principles, such as those of the Ashokan edicts, into the governance of her empire, and had many Indians become part of the royal court, including faith healers and astrologers.

=== Sacrifice on Mount Tai ===
In relation to Daoism, there are records that point to Wu&#x27;s participation in important religious rituals, such as the &quot;tou long on&quot; Mount Song, and &quot;feng&quot; and &quot;shan&quot; on Mount Tai. One of the most important rituals was performed in 666. When Emperor Gaozong offered sacrifices to the deities of heaven and earth, Wu, in an unprecedented action, offered sacrifices after him, with Princess Dowager Yan, mother of Gaozong&#x27;s brother Li Zhen, Prince of Yue, offering sacrifices after her. Wu&#x27;s procession of ladies up Mount Tai conspicuously linked Wu with the Chinese empire&#x27;s most sacred traditional rites. Another important performance was made in 700, when Wu conducted the &quot;tou long&quot; Daoist expiatory rite. Her participation in the rituals had political as well as religious motives. Such ceremonies served to consolidate Wu&#x27;s life in politics and show she possessed the Mandate of Heaven.

== Literature ==
=== North Gate Scholars ===
Toward the end of Gaozong&#x27;s life, Wu began engaging a number of mid-level officials who had literary talent, including Yuan Wanqing (), Liu Yizhi, Fan Lübing, Miao Chuke (), Zhou Simao (), and Han Chubin (), to write a number of works on her behalf, including the &quot;Biographies of Notable Women&quot; (), &quot;Guidelines for Imperial Subjects&quot; (), and &quot;New Teachings for Official Staff Members&quot; (). Collectively, they became known as the &quot;North Gate Scholars&quot; (), because they served inside the palace, which was north of the imperial government buildings, and Wu sought advice from them to divert the powers of the chancellors.

=== The &quot;Twelve Suggestions&quot; ===
On 28 January 675, Wu submitted 12 suggestions. The specific proposal has not survive in full, but at least 7 suggestions are known. One was that the work of Laozi (whose family name was Li and to whom the Tang imperial clan traced its ancestry), Tao Te Ching, should be added to imperial university students&#x27; required reading. Another was that a three-year mourning period should be observed for a mother&#x27;s death in all cases, not just in cases when the father was no longer alive. Emperor Gaozong praised her suggestions and adopted them.

=== Modified Chinese characters ===

In 690, Wu&#x27;s cousin&#x27;s son Zong Qinke submitted a number of modified Chinese characters intended to showcase Wu&#x27;s greatness. She adopted them, and took one of the modified characters, Zhao (), to be her formal name (i.e., the name by which the people would exercise naming taboo on). was made from two other characters: Ming () on top, meaning &quot;light&quot; or &quot;clarity&quot;, and Kong () on the bottom, meaning &quot;sky&quot;. The implication appeared to be that she would be like the light shining from the sky. (Zhao (), meaning &quot;shine&quot;, from which was derived, might have been her original name, but evidence of that is inconclusive.) Later that year, after successive petition drives started by the low-level official Fu Youyi began to occur in waves, asking her to take the throne, Emperor Ruizong offered to take the name of Wu as well. On 14 October 690, she approved the requests. She changed the state&#x27;s name to Zhou on 16 October, claiming ancestry from the Zhou dynasty, and took the throne as Empress Regnant (with the title Empress Regnant Shengshen (), literally &quot;Divine and Sacred Emperor or Empress Regnant&quot;) on 19 October. Ruizong was deposed and made crown prince with the atypical title &quot;Huangsi&quot; (). This thus interrupted the Tang dynasty, and Wu became the first (and only) woman to reign over China as empress regnant.

=== Poetry ===
Wu&#x27;s court was a focus of literary creativity. Forty-six of Wu&#x27;s poems are collected in the &quot;Complete Tang Poems&quot; and 61 essays under her name are recorded in the &quot;Quan Tangwen&quot; (&quot;Collected Tang Essays&quot;). Many of those writings serve political ends, but there is one poem in which she laments her mother after she died and expresses her despair at not being able to see her again.

During Wu&#x27;s reign, the imperial court produced various works of which she was a sponsor, such as the anthology of her court&#x27;s poetry known as the &quot;Zhuying ji&quot; (&quot;Collection of Precious Glories&quot;), which contained poems by Cui Rong, Li Jiao, Zhang Yue, and others, arranged according to the poets&#x27; rank at court. Among the literary developments that took place during Wu&#x27;s time (and partly at her court) was the final stylistic development of the &quot;new style&quot; poetry of the regulated verse (&quot;jintishi&quot;), by the poetic pair Song Zhiwen and Shen Quanqi.

Wu also patronized scholars by founding an institute to produce the &quot;Collection of Biographies of Famous Women&quot;. The development of what is considered characteristic Tang poetry is traditionally ascribed to Chen Zi&#x27;ang, one of Wu&#x27;s ministers.

=== Literary allusions ===
Literary allusions to Wu may carry several connotations: a woman who has inappropriately overstepped her bounds, the hypocrisy of preaching compassion while simultaneously engaging in a pattern of political corruption and vicious behavior. For many centuries, the establishment used Wu as an example of what can go wrong when a woman is in charge.

Mao Zedong&#x27;s wife Jiang Qing rehabilitated Wu as part of a propaganda campaign to suggest she be considered as a successor to her ailing husband. Frank Dikotter asserted that Jiang Qing &quot;had started to compare herself to the only empress ever to have ruled in Chinese history, namely Wu Zetian. Articles praising the sixth-century empress as a great unifier of the nation appeared in the press, even though she was popularly reviled as a ruthless, wicked ruler who had mercilessly crushed her opponents.&quot; However, Dikotter did not cite sources for his claim.

In his biography &quot;Wu&quot;, Jonathan Clements writes that these wildly differing uses of a historical figure often led to contradictory and even hysterical characterizations. Many alleged poisonings and other incidents, such as her daughter&#x27;s premature death, may have rational explanations that have been twisted by later opponents.

== Evaluation ==
=== Quotes ===

The traditional Chinese historical view of Wu Zetian generally was mixed—admiring her for her abilities in governing the state, but vilifying her for her actions in seizing imperial power. Luo Binwang even wrote along these lines in a declaration during her lifetime, in support of Li Jingye&#x27;s rebellion. Typical was a commentary by the Later Jin dynasty historian Liu Xu, the lead editor of the &quot;Old Book of Tang&quot;:

Some of the diversity in terms of points of agreement and even outright divergences in modern evaluations of Wu can be seen in the following quotes by modern non-Chinese authors:



=== Confucian viewpoints ===
Wu Zetian&#x27;s rise and reign was criticized harshly by Confucian historians like Liu Xu and Yuan Shu, But, some of those had praises for Wu Zetian like Liu Xu (in Quotes section), Sima Guang

In the early period of the Tang dynasty, because all the emperors were her direct descendants, Wu was evaluated favorably. But commentary in subsequent periods, especially the book &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot; compiled by Sima Guang, harshly criticized her. By the period of Southern Song dynasty, when Neo-Confucianism was firmly established as China&#x27;s mainstream political ideology, it determined the evaluation of Wu.

<doc id="166439" wikidata="Q1767289" url="?curid=166439" title="Pulse-position modulation">
<text>Pulse-position modulation (PPM) is a form of signal modulation in which &quot;M&quot; message bits are encoded by transmitting a single pulse in one of formula_1 possible required time shifts. This is repeated every &quot;T&quot; seconds, such that the transmitted bit rate is formula_2 bits per second. It is primarily useful for optical communications systems, which tend to have little or no multipath interference.

==History==
An ancient use of pulse-position modulation was the Greek hydraulic semaphore system invented by Aeneas Stymphalus around 350 B.C. that used the water clock principle to time signals. In this system, the draining of water acts as the timing device, and torches are used to signal the pulses. The system used identical water-filled containers whose drain could be turned on and off, and a float with a rod marked with various predetermined codes that represented military messages. The operators would place the containers on hills so they could be seen from each other at a distance. To send a message, the operators would use torches to signal the beginning and ending of the draining of the water, and the marking on the rod attached to the float would indicate the message.

In modern times, pulse-position modulation has origins in telegraph time-division multiplexing, which dates back to 1853, and evolved alongside pulse-code modulation and pulse-width modulation. In the early 1960s, Don Mathers and Doug Spreng of NASA invented pulse-position modulation used in radio-control (R/C) systems. PPM is currently being used in fiber-optic communications, deep-space communications, and continues to be used in R/C systems.

==Synchronization==
One of the key difficulties of implementing this technique is that the receiver must be properly synchronized to align the local clock with the beginning of each symbol. Therefore, it is often implemented differentially as &quot;differential pulse-position modulation&quot;, whereby each pulse position is encoded relative to the previous, such that the receiver must only measure the difference in the arrival time of successive pulses. It is possible to limit the propagation of errors to adjacent symbols, so that an error in measuring the differential delay of one pulse will affect only two symbols, instead of affecting all successive measurements.

==Sensitivity to multipath interference==
Aside from the issues regarding receiver synchronization, the key disadvantage of PPM is that it is inherently sensitive to multipath interference that arises in channels with frequency-selective fading, whereby the receiver&#x27;s signal contains one or more echoes of each transmitted pulse. Since the information is encoded in the time of arrival (either differentially, or relative to a common clock), the presence
of one or more echoes can make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to accurately determine the correct pulse position corresponding to the transmitted pulse.
Multipath in Pulse Position Modulation systems can be easily mitigated by using the same techniques that are used in Radar systems that rely totally on synchronization and time of arrival of the received pulse to obtain their range position in the presence of echoes.

==Non-coherent detection==
One of the principal advantages of PPM is that it is an &quot;M&quot;-ary modulation technique that can be implemented non-coherently, such that the receiver does not need to use a phase-locked loop (PLL) to track the phase of the carrier. This makes it a suitable candidate for optical communications systems, where coherent phase modulation and detection are difficult and extremely expensive. The only other common &quot;M&quot;-ary non-coherent modulation technique is &quot;M&quot;-ary frequency-shift keying (M-FSK), which is the frequency-domain dual to PPM.

==PPM vs. M-FSK==
PPM and M-FSK systems with the same bandwidth, average power, and transmission rate of M/T bits per second have identical performance in an &quot;additive white Gaussian noise&quot; (AWGN) channel. However, their performance differs greatly when comparing frequency-selective and frequency-flat fading channels. Whereas frequency-selective fading produces echoes that are highly disruptive for any of the M time-shifts used to encode PPM data, it selectively disrupts only some of the M possible frequency-shifts used to encode data for M-FSK. On the other hand, frequency-flat fading is more disruptive for M-FSK than PPM, as all M of the possible frequency-shifts are impaired by fading, while the short duration of the PPM pulse means that only a few of the M time-shifts are heavily impaired by fading.

Optical communications systems tend to have weak multipath distortions, and PPM is a viable modulation scheme in many such applications.

==Applications for RF communications==
Narrowband RF (radio frequency) channels with low power and long wavelengths (i.e., low frequency) are affected primarily by flat fading, and PPM is better suited than M-FSK to be used in these scenarios. One common application with these channel characteristics, first used in the early 1960s with top-end HF (as low as 27 MHz) frequencies into the low-end VHF band frequencies (30 MHz to 75 MHz for RC use depending on location), is the radio control of model aircraft, boats and cars, originally known as &quot;digital proportional&quot; radio control. PPM is employed in these systems, with the position of each pulse representing the angular position of an analogue control on the transmitter, or possible states of a binary switch. The number of pulses per frame gives the number of controllable channels available. The advantage of using PPM for this type of application is that the electronics required to decode the signal are extremely simple, which leads to small, light-weight receiver/decoder units (model aircraft require parts that are as lightweight as possible). Servos made for model radio control include some of the electronics required to convert the pulse to the motor position – the receiver is required to first extract the information from the received radio signal through its intermediate frequency section, then demultiplex the separate channels from the serial stream, and feed the control pulses to each servo.

==PPM encoding for radio control==
A complete PPM frame is about 22.5 ms (can vary between implementation), and signal low state is always 0.3 ms. It begins with a start frame (high state for more than 2 ms). Each channel (up to 8) is encoded by the time of the high state plus the lower state. (PPM high state + 0.3 = servo PWM pulse width).

More sophisticated radio control systems are now often based on pulse-code modulation, which is more complex but offers greater flexibility and reliability. The advent of 2.4 GHz band FHSS radio-control systems in the early 21st century changed this further.

Pulse-position modulation is also used for communication with the ISO/IEC 15693 contactless smart card, as well as in the HF implementation of the Electronic Product Code (EPC) Class 1 protocol for RFID tags.

<doc id="166441" wikidata="Q1238630" url="?curid=166441" title="Lyapunov exponent">
<text>In mathematics, the Lyapunov exponent or Lyapunov characteristic exponent of a dynamical system is a quantity that characterizes the rate of separation of infinitesimally close trajectories. Quantitatively, two trajectories in phase space with initial separation vector formula_1 diverge (provided that the divergence can be treated within the linearized approximation) at a rate given by

formula_2

where formula_3 is the Lyapunov exponent.

The rate of separation can be different for different orientations of initial separation vector. Thus, there is a spectrum of Lyapunov exponents—equal in number to the dimensionality of the phase space. It is common to refer to the largest one as the maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE), because it determines a notion of predictability for a dynamical system. A positive MLE is usually taken as an indication that the system is chaotic (provided some other conditions are met, e.g., phase space compactness). Note that an arbitrary initial separation vector will typically contain some component in the direction associated with the MLE, and because of the exponential growth rate, the effect of the other exponents will be obliterated over time.

The exponent is named after Aleksandr Lyapunov.

==Definition of the maximal Lyapunov exponent==
The maximal Lyapunov exponent can be defined as follows:
formula_4
where formula_5 is the maximum integer such that the sum of the formula_5 largest exponents is still non-negative. formula_7 represents an upper bound for the information dimension of the system. Moreover, the sum of all the positive Lyapunov exponents gives an estimate of the Kolmogorov–Sinai entropy accordingly to Pesin&#x27;s theorem.
Along with widely used numerical methods for estimating and computing the Lyapunov dimension there is an effective analytical approach, which is based on the direct Lyapunov method with special Lyapunov-like functions.
The Lyapunov exponents of bounded trajectory and the Lyapunov dimension of attractor are invariant under diffeomorphism of the phase space.

The multiplicative inverse of the largest Lyapunov exponent is sometimes referred in literature as Lyapunov time, and defines the characteristic &quot;e&quot;-folding time. For chaotic orbits, the Lyapunov time will be finite, whereas for regular orbits it will be infinite.

==Numerical calculation==

Generally the calculation of Lyapunov exponents, as defined above, cannot be carried out analytically, and in most cases one must resort to numerical techniques. An early example, which also constituted the first demonstration of the exponential divergence of chaotic trajectories, was carried out by R. H. Miller in 1964. Currently, the most commonly used numerical procedure estimates the formula_8 matrix based on averaging several finite time approximations of the limit defining formula_8.

One of the most used and effective numerical techniques to calculate the Lyapunov spectrum for a smooth dynamical system relies on periodic Gram–Schmidt orthonormalization of the Lyapunov vectors to avoid a misalignment of all the vectors along the direction of maximal expansion. The Lyapunov spectrum of various models are described. Source codes for nonlinear systems such as the Hénon map, the Lorenz equations, a delay differential equation and so on are introduced.

For the calculation of Lyapunov exponents from limited experimental data, various methods have been proposed. However, there are many difficulties with applying these methods and such problems should be approached with care. The main difficulty is that the data does not fully explore the phase space, rather it is confined to the attractor which has very limited (if any) extension along certain directions. These thinner or more singular directions within the data set are the ones associated with the more negative exponents. The use of nonlinear mappings to model the evolution of small displacements from the attractor has been shown to dramatically improve the ability to recover the Lyapunov spectrum, provided the data has a very low level of noise. The singular nature of the data and its connection to the more negative exponents has also been explored.

==Local Lyapunov exponent==

Whereas the (global) Lyapunov exponent gives a measure for the total predictability of a system, it is sometimes of interest to estimate the local predictability around a point in phase space. This may be done through the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix . These eigenvalues are also called local Lyapunov exponents. Local exponents are not invariant under a nonlinear change of coordinates.

==Conditional Lyapunov exponent==

This term is normally used regarding synchronization of chaos, in which there are two systems that are coupled, usually in a unidirectional manner so that there is a drive (or master) system and a response (or slave) system. The conditional exponents are those of the response system with the drive system treated as simply the source of a (chaotic) drive signal. Synchronization occurs when all of the conditional exponents are negative.

* Software on this page was developed specifically for the efficient and accurate calculation of the full spectrum of exponents. This includes LyapOde for cases where the equations of motion are known and also Lyap for cases involving experimental time series data. LyapOde, which includes source code written in &quot;C&quot;, can also calculate the conditional Lyapunov exponents for coupled identical systems. It is intended to allow the user to provide their own set of model equations or to use one of the ones included. There are no inherent limitations on the number of variables, parameters etc. Lyap which includes source code written in Fortran, can also calculate the Lyapunov direction vectors and can characterize the singularity of the attractor, which is the main reason for difficulties in calculating the more negative exponents from time series data. In both cases there is extensive documentation and sample input files. The software can be compiled for running on Windows, Mac, or Linux/Unix systems. The software runs in a text window and has no graphics capabilities, but can generate output files that could easily be plotted with a program like excel.

<text>Wadhurst is a market town in East Sussex, England. It is the centre of the civil parish of Wadhurst, which also includes the hamlets of Cousley Wood and Tidebrook. Wadhurst is twinned with Aubers in France.

==Geography==

Wadhurst is situated on the Kent–Sussex border seven miles (11 km) east of Crowborough and about seven miles (11 km) south of Royal Tunbridge Wells. Other nearby settlements include Ticehurst, Burwash, Mayfield and Heathfield in East Sussex, and Lamberhurst, Hawkhurst and Cranbrook in Kent.

Physically, Wadhurst lies on a high ridge of the Weald – a range of wooded hills running across Sussex and Kent between the North Downs and the South Downs. The reservoir of Bewl Water is nearby. The River Bewl, which is a sub-tributary of the River Medway, and the Limden rise within the civil parish of Wadhurst.

==History==

The name Wadhurst (Wadeherst in early records) is Anglo-Saxon and most probably derives from &quot;Wada&quot; which is believed to be the name of a Saxon tribe which occupied the area and began the clearing of the forests in the 7th or 8th century. There is an Anglo-Saxon manor known as Bivelham which lay between the parishes of Wadhurst and Mayfield.

Although Wadhurst was almost certainly in existence at the time of the Domesday survey in 1086, it was part of the Archbishop of Canterbury&#x27;s land and was therefore not mentioned. The earliest record relating to the area is a reference in the Cartulary of Battle Abbey to &quot;Snape in the parish of Wadhurst&quot;.

Henry III granted Wadhurst its charter in 1253, allowing Wadhurst to hold a market every Saturday and a fair on 29 June, the feast of St Peter and St Paul.

In the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries Wadhurst, as did many towns and villages in the Weald, had a thriving iron industry. Two of the large Georgian buildings on the High Street, Hill House and The Old Vicarage, were both ironmasters&#x27; houses, along with a number of other large houses on the outskirts of Wadhurst. In the church of St Peter and St. Paul there are several iron ledger-stone memorials of ironmasters, which are unique to this area.

During the First World War, Wadhurst lost 149 men, out of a total village population of 3,500. The worst losses were during the Battle of Aubers Ridge, when 25 men from Wadhurst were killed in one day: nearly 80% of the men from Wadhurst who went into no man&#x27;s land that day. Wadhurst is now actively twinned with Aubers.

In March 2023, Wadhurst was named by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; as the best place to live in the United Kingdom.

==Governance==
An electoral ward with the same name exists. The population of this ward at the 2011 census was 5,181.

==Buildings and people==

Wadhurst is a small market town, and has kept a very good range of shops considering its size. It has a traditional butcher, baker, ironmonger, hairdresser, bank, post office, gift shop, and several pubs. The population of the ward was 4,883 at the 2011 Census. In 2020, the population estimate is 4,025 according to the Office for National Statistics.

There are three buildings of particular architectural interest in the town itself, and a number of old manor houses and farms nearby. There are two early Georgian houses on the High Street, the Old Vicarage and Hill House. On the outskirts is the 19th-century Wadhurst Castle.

The rest of the town is in a variety of vernacular styles, from the 13th century onwards; and little in the centre of the town is very modern apart from a range of shops which replaced the Queens Head Hotel, demolished in the crash of a Gloster Meteor in January 1956 in which four people were killed. Church Street contains a row of 13th- and 14th-century cottages which are reputed to be the oldest properties in Wadhurst. Some apparently were built as a cloister to St. Peters and St. Paul&#x27;s Church.

==Churches==

The Church of St. Peter and St. Paul dominates the centre of the town. Wadhurst&#x27;s heritage as a centre of the iron industry is shown by the many iron gravestones in the churchyard. The church is medieval and includes work from the 12th to the 15th centuries; there is a shingled spire and a vaulted porch. There is little of interest inside apart from 30 inscribed iron tomb slabs dating from 1614 to 1790.

Wadhurst Methodist Church is no longer used as a church. There is a Catholic church in Mayfield Lane attached to the Sacred Heart School. The churches participate in Churches Together, an interdenominational organisation, along with St John the Baptist, an Anglican church in Tidebrook, and St Peter in Stonegate.

There are also two early 19th-century former Strict Baptist chapels of similar design in the hamlets of Pell Green (Rehoboth Chapel) and Shover&#x27;s Green (the Shover&#x27;s Green Baptist Chapel). Both are listed at Grade II.

==Education==
Wadhurst has two schools in the state-maintained sector: a Church of England primary school (with a nursery) in Sparrow&#x27;s Green and Uplands Academy, a secondary school and sixth form. The latter also has an affiliated youth and community centre. In addition, in Mayfield Lane there is an independent Catholic preparatory school, Sacred Heart. Wadhurst also used to be the site of Bellerbys College (formerly known as Wadhurst College and Micklefield Wadhurst), a private girls&#x27; school on Mayfield Lane that has been defunct since about 2004.

==Transport==
The Victorian era saw the town expand towards the new railway station, about north of the town. The station, the highest in southern England, is on the line from London Charing Cross to Hastings via Tunbridge Wells, and was opened in 1851 by the South Eastern Railway. The resulting expansion brought the hamlets of Sparrow&#x27;s Green, Turners Green and Best Beech Hill into the town. In addition to the railway, there are buses to Tunbridge Wells, Crowborough and Hastings, as well as community transport and &#x27;rail link&#x27; buses to Ticehurst and Mayfield.

==Wadhurst United F.C.==
Wadhurst United F.C. (based at the Recreation Ground, South View Road) is Wadhurst&#x27;s local football team. They were formed in 1890 and joined the Sussex County League Division Three in 2004. They left the league after the 2005–06 season, to rejoin the East Sussex Football League. The club won the East Sussex League Division Two title in the 2008–09 season.

==Twin towns==
Wadhurst is twinned with Aubers in France.

<text>This is a list of road, railway, waterway, and other tunnels in the United Kingdom.

A tunnel is an underground passageway with no defined minimum length, though it may be considered to be at least twice as long as wide. Some government bodies define a tunnel as in length or longer.

A tunnel may be for pedestrians or cyclists, for general road traffic, for motor vehicles only, for rail traffic, or for a canal. Some are aqueducts, constructed purely for carrying water—for consumption, for hydroelectric purposes or as sewers—while others carry other services such as telecommunications cables. There are even tunnels designed as wildlife crossings for European badgers and other endangered species.

The longest tunnel in the United Kingdom is the Northern line at . This will be superseded in the 2020s by the Woodsmith Mine Tunnel in North Yorkshire that will transport polyhalite from North Yorkshire to a port on Teesside. Standedge Tunnel at is the longest canal tunnel in the United Kingdom. When completed in the late 2020s, the Chiltern tunnel will be the 2nd longest mainline railway tunnel in the UK at .

<text>&quot; Mersey &quot; was a ship launched at Chittagong in 1801 and wrecked in the Torres Strait, Australia, about mid-June 1804. She was the first merchantman lost in the Strait.

&quot;Mersey&quot; was built in Chittagong in 1801 and registered at Fort William, India. At the time of her loss her captain and owner was James Wilson.

&quot;Mersey&quot;, Captain Wilson, arrived at Sydney on 10 April 1804 with a cargo chiefly consisting of sugar, port and Madeira wine, cordage, and some piece goods. An advertisement on 22 April announced the sale on Monday 23 April of &quot;Mersey&quot;″s cargo. The advertisement provided a rich, detailed listing of the cargo.

Philip Gidley King, governor of New South Wales, on 15 May 1804 announced that &quot;Mersey&quot; would return to India via an &quot;hithertoo unfrequented passage to Torres Strait in the track of Captain Flinders.&quot; King had chartered &quot;Mersey&quot; to purchase 250 cows from Bengal and deliver them to Hobart, Tasmania.

&quot;Mersey&quot; left Port Jackson on 24 May 1804 for Bengal with a cargo of 1632 feet of timber. While passing through the Torres Strait, &quot;Mersey&quot; was totally wrecked. The whaler brought the news on 17 November 1804 from Timor.

Only 17 crew and the captain were saved by sailing in a longboat to Timor; 56 others had perished. After refitting the longboat at Dili the survivors reached Bencoolen from where they sailed to Madras on an Acehen vessel. Captain Wilson arrived in Calcutta 20 September 1804 on board &quot;Margaret&quot;, from Madras.

<text>Brigitte Boisselier (born 1956), also known as Brigitte Roehr, is a French chemist and Raëlian religious leader best known for her claim to have overseen the creation of the first human clone. A native of Champagne-Ardenne, she studied chemistry in France and the United States, earning two PhDs. From 1984 to 1997, she lived near Paris and worked as a research chemist and a sales manager for Air Liquide. She embraced Raëlism in 1992; the group was unpopular in France and her conversion led to tensions with those around her. Five years later, she joined Clonaid, a Raëlian organization that sought to clone a human. After her service as their scientific director was publicized, she lost her position with Air Liquide and focused on cloning full-time.

In late 2000, Clonaid announced that they had received a large donation to fund the cloning of a child, and that Boisselier supervised a team of scientists at a secret laboratory in the United States who would soon produce a human clone. For the next year, the project received media coverage—and regulatory suspicion—as Boisselier promised the imminent birth of a human clone. In late 2001, she announced that one had been born and that public evidence would soon be offered. This declaration received significant press coverage in the United States, and Boisselier appeared on many television programs. After a court in Florida launched a child welfare investigation, she stated that the cloned child&#x27;s parents had withdrawn their offer to provide evidence of the cloning and would have no further public comment. No evidence of the cloning, or subsequent procedures reported by Clonaid, was ever offered, and the announcements were widely perceived to have been a hoax.

In 2003, impressed with her management of Clonaid and public relations skill, Raël, the founder of Raëlism, announced that Boisselier would succeed him as the group&#x27;s leader upon his death. In subsequent years, she has devoted herself to lecturing about the group&#x27;s doctrines and serving as their spokesperson.

==Early life and education==
Brigitte Boisselier was born to a Catholic family in France in 1956. She was raised on a farm in Champagne-Ardenne and became interested in science while young. She attended the University of Dijon, earning a master&#x27;s degree in biochemistry and a PhD in chemistry. In the 1980s, she moved to Texas, where she received another PhD in chemistry from the University of Houston.

Boisselier returned to France in 1984 to work for Air Liquide, an industrial gas company, where she remained for 13 years. At that time, she lived in Les Loges-en-Josas and worked as a research chemist and a sales manager in Lyon. She married and had three children between the late 1970s and early 1990s.

==Conversion and new career==
In 1992, Boisselier converted to Raëlism, a UFO religion founded by the French journalist Claude Vorilhon, usually known as Raël. After attending a meeting at which Raël spoke, she felt strongly that he was completely honest and joined his movement. Shortly before her conversion, she left her husband, alleging violent behavior. Due to her increasing involvement with Raëlism, he gained sole custody of their youngest child soon afterwards. Boisselier believed that religious intolerance motivated a court to transfer the child&#x27;s custody. Although her faith led to tension with her parents, her eldest child converted. In the 1990s, Raëlism was seen as dangerous and viewed with disdain in France, resulting in loss of employment for prominent members. The hostility was fueled in part by public concerns about new religious movements after deaths caused by the Order of the Solar Temple in Europe during the mid-1990s.

Boisselier became the scientific director of Clonaid, an organization founded by Raël that sought to clone humans, in 1997. That year, Boisselier was interviewed by &quot;Le Monde&quot; about her role in Clonaid, and she lost her position with Air Liquide after the company learned of this. Air Liquide stated that her termination was due to her holding dual employment, and that she was strained by her Clonaid service. She filed a lawsuit against Air Liquide, arguing that she was the victim of religious discrimination. Her suit was successful: in 1999, she won a judgment of about US$30,000.

After losing her job, Boisselier moved with her middle child, a son, to Quebec, where her eldest daughter was a student. Boisselier began to travel to discuss Clonaid, eventually becoming a high-profile speaker. Around that time, she reached the rank of Bishop within Raëlism. She was one of the 25 members closest to Raël and joined the group&#x27;s Order of Angels, which promoted free love and femininity. She moved to the United States and began teaching at State University of New York at Plattsburgh for a short time before moving to Hamilton College in 2000 to teach chemistry. Her association with Clonaid was publicized in the U.S. in February 2001, and she resigned her academic position that May, although she had a three-year contract. She claimed she was initially popular at Hamilton College, but felt that she was disrespected after her association with Clonaid was publicized.

==Cloning==

===Clonaid origins===
Raël founded Clonaid in March 1997, shortly after the Dolly the Sheep cloning, believing that the process was important because the human species had been created by an extraterrestrial cloning project. On a practical level, Raël promoted the practice as a way to develop more desirable genetics and eventually prolong memories in new bodies. Shortly after Clonaid&#x27;s launch, Boisselier began publicizing and managing its operations. In 1999, she announced that she had set up cloning laboratories and had hired a team of six scientists. She said she had limited knowledge of cloning but was skilled in selecting experts.

In August 2000, Mark Hunt, a politician from West Virginia, asked Boisselier to clone his late son, who had died as a child. Hunt paid Clonaid $500,000 and helped them rent a science laboratory from a school. Boisselier said that the laboratory would initially be used to clone cattle, before moving on to humans. She planned to use a number of Raëlian surrogates, who were willing to abort abnormal pregnancies, to bear clones; the high number of women would compensate for the low odds of a healthy child for each implantation. In September 2000, Raël and Boisselier held a press conference with several aspiring surrogate mothers of clones. At the event, Boisselier announced the construction of a cloning laboratory and vaguely described Hunt, who wished to remain anonymous. Boisselier received significant media attention as an advocate of cloning. Some commentators initially accepted her work as a legitimate attempt at cloning; Margaret Talbot of the &quot;New York Times&quot; described her as a more credible spokesperson than Raël, projecting what she described as &quot;an air of cool, academic professionalism&quot;. Boisselier&#x27;s striking physical appearance drew particular attention, and she developed an &quot;avant-garde&quot;, stylish reputation, contrary to popular images of scientists.

===Announcements and media coverage===

In early 2001, Boisselier promised the cloning of a human child within a year, drawing further attention to her work. A prosecutor in New York began investigating her compliance with local medical laws. Boisselier said that the Food and Drug Administration also surreptitiously investigated her, and Raël claimed that U.S. President George W. Bush was concerned about Clonaid&#x27;s work. The caretaker of the laboratory that Hunt had rented grew suspicious about their work and contacted law enforcement. They spoke with the FDA, who searched the site and persuaded Boisselier to suspend her cloning work pending legal clarification. After Hunt was asked by the laboratory&#x27;s caretaker to shut down the cloning operation, he broke with Boisselier and criticized her for seeking media attention. The caretaker also spoke publicly, saying that Boisselier was seldom at the laboratory. Boisselier then announced that she was moving her cloning operations overseas. Boisselier never faced any legal charges in connection with the laboratory.

In March 2001, Boisselier was invited to speak at a U.S. Congress hearing on human cloning, and at her insistence Raël was permitted to speak as well. The event garnered public attention, in large part because of Raël&#x27;s unconventional appearance. On 7 August 2001, Boisselier attended a widely publicized human cloning symposium at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C., Significant media attention was given to Boisselier, who, along with Severino Antinori and Panayiotis Zavos, was one of three participants actively engaged in efforts to produce a human clone. The rest of the attendees were renowned scientists and ethicists, one of whom, Arthur Caplan, dismissed Boisselier as part of the &quot;loony cloning element&quot;. By May 2002, Boisselier said that she had facilitated 10 to 20 pregnancies but had been thwarted by miscarriages.

====Claims of success====

Boisselier confidently announced at a press conference in Florida in December 2002 that Clonaid had successfully produced a live-born clone, named Eve, for an infertile couple. Canadian sociologist Susan J. Palmer notes that naming the cloned child &quot;Eve&quot; recalls Raël&#x27;s teachings that aliens created the first humans through cloning. After the announcement, Boisselier received abundant press, but the media, particularly late-night comedy programs, criticized her glamorous appearance and mocked Raëlism. Around that time, Boisselier appeared on many U.S. network news broadcasts and on CNN. She did not provide details about the child or its family, although she was often asked to. She hired a science editor from ABC to supervise verification of the cloning. Many scientists doubted that the Raëlians could overcome the difficulties that human cloning posed, or that they would be able to produce a healthy child. Boisselier said a DNA test was forthcoming and announced that five more clones would be born later that winter. As Raël and Boisselier continued to seek media exposure, journalistic animosity towards them grew.

Bernard Siegel, an attorney from Florida, learned of the case and felt that a hearing should be held about Eve&#x27;s welfare. In January 2003, he initiated legal proceedings, seeking to bring the clone&#x27;s parents to court so its health could be verified. Raël and Boisselier attacked the filing as an attempt to take a child from loving parents and announced that, in protest, they would not provide DNA for testing. An arraignment occurred on 24 January and was televised live on CNN; Boisselier and Clonaid&#x27;s vice president, Thomas Kaenzig, were subpoenaed in lieu of the child&#x27;s parents. In courtroom testimony, the vice president of Clonaid said he knew very little about the clone, and that Boisselier controlled all the information. She did not attend the hearing, and Kaenzig provided little information, angering the judge, who threatened contempt of court charges. Boisselier attended a second hearing on 29 January, telling the court that the child was in Israel. The judge then ruled that the court had no jurisdiction. In late January, the science editor announced that he suspected the cloning announcements were a hoax. Around that time, Boisselier held a press conference at which she announced that the cloned baby&#x27;s parents had cut off contact with her and would never speak to the press.

In the following years, Boisselier claimed to have facilitated the cloning of several children in a variety of countries. As of June 2004, she reported that Clonaid has successfully cloned 13 children. She did not provide evidence to verify the claims. She stated that the machine called the RMX 2010 was used in the cloning attempts, and exhibited it publicly.

After Boisselier announced that no evidence of the cloning would be provided, journalists became very skeptical of her story. While discussing Boisselier&#x27;s management of Clonaid, Palmer notes that it is impossible to know why she stated that a clone was produced but then refused to provide evidence. She argues that her refusal to provide evidence may have been because she organized a hoax, did not wish to publicize the birth of an unhealthy child, or was taken advantage of by a scientist she had hired. American science journalist Steven S. Hall criticized the media for their coverage of Clonaid, believe that they were inaccurately represented as a credible group. He speculates that the coverage of Boisselier and other cloning adherents galvanized sentiment against cloning, leading to its banning in the U.S.

==Later activism==

In January 2003, Raël held a ceremony at which he thanked Boisselier for her service and anointed her as his successor. He praised her for spreading the message of Raëlism internationally while publicizing the cloning. In the Raëlian hierarchy, she is one level below Raël and serves as a spokesperson for the movement. As a leader, she has attempted to rehabilitate the swastika, one of the group&#x27;s symbols. She maintains that it is valuable as an ancient symbol of peace, and that it has been unfairly associated with Nazi Germany.

In the mid-2000s, Boisselier often taught about the Raëlian perspective of the body and sexuality. She discussed these topics from a biological perspective, arguing that humans are essentially robots because they can be reprogrammed. Specifically, she maintained that hormones program the brain, and they provide humans with the freedom to choose from many possibilities. Raëlians emphasize sexual stimulation as a way to positively change their members, and Boisselier has stated that she sees the pursuit of femininity as a method of spiritual growth. The group highly values feminine beauty, and Raël has applauded Boisselier for maintaining her appearance, casting her as a role model.

By 2007, Boisselier had taken the name &quot;Brigitte Roehr&quot; and was living in Los Angeles. That year, she began leading a Raëlian project to fight female genital mutilation. She heads a Raëlian-affiliated group known as Clitoraid, which raises funds to provide restorative surgery to women with damaged clitorises. The project, which has attracted criticism of its effectiveness, aims to build a hospital in Burkina Faso where women can receive clitoral surgery.

<doc id="166449" wikidata="Q12116" url="?curid=166449" title="Corto Maltese">
<text>Corto Maltese ( ; ) is a series of adventure comics named after the character Corto Maltese, an adventurous sailor. It was created by the Italian comic book creator Hugo Pratt in 1967. The comics are highly praised as some of the most artistic and literary graphic novels ever written and have been translated into numerous languages and adapted into several animated films.

The series features &quot;Corto Maltese&quot;, an enigmatic sea captain who lives in the first three decades of the 20th century. Born in Valletta on the island of Malta on 10 July 1887, the son of a sailor from Cornwall, and a gypsy from Seville.

In his adventures full of real-world references, &quot;Corto&quot; has often crossed with real historical characters like the American author Jack London and his nurse Virginia Prentiss, the American outlaw Butch Cassidy, the German World War I flying ace Red Baron, and many others.

==Publication history==
The character debuted in the serial &quot;Ballad of the Salty Sea&quot;, one of several Pratt stories published in the first edition of the Ivaldi Editore comics magazine &quot;Sergeant Kirk&quot; in July 1967. The story centers around smugglers and pirates in the World War I–era Pacific Islands. In 1970, Pratt moved to France and began a series of short &quot;Corto Maltese&quot; stories for the French comics magazine &quot;Pif Gadget&quot;, an arrangement lasting four years and producing many 20-page stories. In 1974 he returned to full-length stories, sending Corto to 1918 Siberia in the story &quot;Corto Maltese in Siberia&quot;, first serialised in the Italian comics magazine &quot;Linus&quot;.

In 1976, &quot;Ballad of the Salty Sea&quot; was published in book format and was awarded the prize for best foreign realistic comic album at the Angoulême International Comics Festival.

Pratt continued to produce new stories over the next two decades, many first appearing in the eponymous comics magazine Corto Maltese (published between October 1983 and July 1993), until 1988 when the final story &quot;Mu, the Lost Continent&quot; was serialised, ending in June 1989.

On October 7, 2014, Italian publisher Cong, who owns the rights to Corto Maltese, announced that a new album was being made by writer Juan Díaz Canales and artist Rubén Pellejero. &quot;Under the Midnight Sun&quot; was released in Europe on September 30, 2015 and takes place in 1915. In September 2017, a second album, &quot;Equatoria&quot; set in 1911 was published. In November 2019, a third album, &quot;All Saints Day&quot; set in 1912–1913 was published. The fourth album by Canales and Pellejero was published in September 2022, entitled &quot;Berlin Nocturne&quot;. It takes place in Berlin and Prague in 1924.

==Character==
Corto Maltese is a laconic sea captain adventuring during the early 20th century (1900–1920s). A &quot;rogue with a heart of gold&quot;, he is tolerant and sympathetic to the underdog. Born in Valletta on July 10, 1887, he is the son of a British sailor from Cornwall and an Andalusian–Romani witch and prostitute known as &quot;La Niña de Gibraltar&quot; (&quot;The Girl of Gibraltar&quot;). As a boy growing up in the Jewish quarter of Córdoba, Maltese discovered that he had no fate line on his palm and therefore carved his own with his father&#x27;s razor, determining that his fate was his to choose. Although maintaining a neutral position, Corto instinctively supports the disadvantaged and oppressed.

The character embodies the author&#x27;s skepticism of national, ideological and religious assertions. Corto befriends people from all walks of life, including the murderous Russian Rasputin (no relation with the historical figure, apart from physical resemblance and some character traits), British heir Tristan Bantam, voodoo priestess Gold Mouth and Czech academic Jeremiah Steiner. He also knows and meets various real-life historical figures, including Jack London, Ernest Hemingway, Hermann Hesse, Butch Cassidy, James Joyce, Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio, Frederick Rolfe, Joseph Conrad, Sükhbaatar, John Reed, White Russian general Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, Enver Pasha of Turkey and Sergei Semenov, modelled after Grigory Semyonov. His acquaintances treat him with great respect, as when a telephone call to Joseph Stalin frees him from arrest when he is threatened with execution on the border of Turkey and Armenia.

Corto&#x27;s favourite book is &quot;Utopia&quot; by Thomas More, but he never finishes it. He also read books by London, Lugones, Stevenson, Melville and Conrad, and quotes Rimbaud.

&quot;Corto Maltese&quot; stories range from straight historical adventure to occult dream sequences. He is present when the Red Baron is shot down, helps the Jívaro in South America, and flees Fascists in Venice, but also unwittingly helps Merlin and Oberon to defend Britain and helps Tristan Bantam to visit the lost continent of Mu.

Chronologically, the first adventure, &quot;Corto Maltese: The Early Years&quot;, happens during the Russo-Japanese War. In other albums he experiences the Great War in several locations, participates in the Russian Civil War after the October Revolution, and appears during the early stages of Fascist Italy. In a separate series by Pratt, &quot;The Desert Scorpions&quot;, Corto is said to be missing in action in Spain during the Spanish Civil War.

==Chronology==

<text>Ugo Eugenio Prat (15 June 1927 – 20 August 1995), better known as Hugo Pratt, was an Italian comic book creator who was known for combining strong storytelling with extensive historical research on works such as &quot;Corto Maltese&quot;. He was inducted into the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 2005, and was awarded the 15th anniversary special Grand Prix de la ville d&#x27;Angoulême at the Angoulême Festival. In 1946 Hugo Pratt became part of the so-called Group of Venice with Fernando Carcupino, Dino Battaglia and Damiano Damiani.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Born in Rimini, Italy, to Rolando Prat and Evelina (Genero) Prat, Ugo Eugenio Prat spent much of his childhood in Venice in a very cosmopolitan family environment. His paternal grandfather Joseph was Catholic of English and Provençal origins, his maternal grandfather was of hidden Jewish descent and his grandmother was of Turkish origin. In 1937, Pratt moved with his mother to Abyssinia (Ethiopia), joining his father who had moved there following the conquest of that country by Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Italy. Pratt&#x27;s father, a MVSN NCO, was captured in 1941 by British troops and, in late 1942, died from disease as a prisoner of war. The same year, Hugo Pratt and his mother were interned in a prison camp at Dirédaoua, where he would buy comics from guards, and later was sent back to Italy by the Red Cross.

After the war, Pratt moved to Venice where he organized entertainment for the Allied troops. Later Pratt joined the Venice Group with other Italian cartoonists, including Alberto Ongaro, Gian Carlo Guarda and Mario Faustinelli. Their magazine &quot;Asso di Picche&quot;, launched in 1945 as &quot;Albo Uragano&quot;, concentrated on adventure comics. The magazine scored some success and published works by young talents, including Dino Battaglia. His eponymous character &quot;Asso di Picche&quot; (&quot;Ace of Spades&quot;) was a success, mainly in Argentina, where Pratt was invited in 1949.

===Argentine years===

In the late 1940s he moved to Buenos Aires, where he worked for Argentine publisher Editorial Abril and met Argentine comics artists such as Alberto Breccia and Solano López. The passage to Editorial Frontera saw the publication of some of his most important early series. These included &quot;Sergeant Kirk&quot; and &quot;Ernie Pike&quot;, written by Héctor Germán Oesterheld.

Pratt taught drawing in the Escuela Panamericana de Arte directed by Enrique Lipszyc. He often travelled to South American destinations such as the Amazon and Mato Grosso. During that period he produced his first comic book as a complete author, both writing and illustrating &quot;Anna della jungla&quot; (&quot;Ann of the Jungle&quot;), which was followed by the similar &quot;Capitan Cormorant&quot; and &quot;Wheeling&quot;. The latter was completed after his return to Italy.

===Return to Italy and the creation of Corto Maltese===

From the summer of 1959 to the summer of 1960, Pratt lived in London where he drew a series of war comics for Fleetway Publications, with British scriptwriters. He then returned to Argentina, despite the harsh economic times there. From there, he moved again to Italy in 1962 where he started a collaboration with the children&#x27;s comic book magazine &quot;Corriere dei Piccoli&quot;, for which he adapted several classics of adventure literature, including &quot;Treasure Island&quot; and &quot;Kidnapped&quot; by Robert Louis Stevenson.

In 1967, Pratt met Florenzo Ivaldi; the two created a comics magazine named after his character, &quot;Sergeant Kirk&quot;, the hero first written by Héctor Oesterheld. Pratt&#x27;s most famous story, &quot;Una ballata del mare salato (A Ballad of the Salty Sea)&quot;, is published in the first issue and introduced his best-known character, Corto Maltese.

Corto&#x27;s series continued three years later in the French magazine &quot;Pif Gadget&quot;. Due to his rather mixed family ancestry, Pratt had learned snippets of things such as kabbalism and much history. Many of his stories are placed in real historical eras and deal with real events: the 1755 war between French and British colonists in Ticonderoga, colonial wars in Africa and both world wars, for example. Pratt did exhaustive research for factual and visual details, and some characters are real historical figures or loosely based on them, such as Corto&#x27;s main friend/enemy, Rasputin. Many of the minor characters cross over into other stories in a way that places all of Pratt’s stories into the same continuum.

Pratt&#x27;s main series in the second part of his career include &quot;Gli scorpioni del deserto&quot; (five stories) and &quot;Jesuit Joe&quot;. He also wrote stories for his friend and pupil Milo Manara for &quot;Tutto ricominciò con un&#x27;estate indiana&quot; and &quot;El Gaucho&quot;.

===Later years===
From 1970 to 1984, Pratt lived mainly in France where Corto Maltese, a psychologically very complex character resulting from the travel experiences and the endless inventive capacity of his author, became the main character of a comics series. Initially published from 1970 to 1973 by the magazine &quot;Pif Gadget&quot;, it brought him much popular and critical success. Later published in album format, this series was eventually translated into fifteen languages. From 1984–95 he lived in Switzerland, where the international success that Corto Maltese sparked continued to grow. In France, most of his pre-Corto Maltese works were published in several album editions by publishers such as Casterman, Dargaud, and Les Humanoïdes Associés. A wanderer by nature, Hugo Pratt continued to travel from Canada to Patagonia, from Africa to the Pacific area. He died of bowel cancer on 20 August 1995.

Pratt cited authors such as Robert Louis Stevenson, James Oliver Curwood, Zane Grey, Kenneth Roberts, Henry De Vere Stacpoole, Joseph Conrad, Fenimore Cooper, Herman Melville and Jack London as influences, along with cartoonists Lyman Young, Will Eisner, and especially Milton Caniff.

On Friday, 15 July 2005, at San Diego Comic-Con&#x27;s 17th Annual Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards, he was one of four professionals that year inducted into the Comic Book Hall of Fame.

One of the series created by Pratt, entitled &quot;The Scorpions of the Desert&quot; in English, has been continued after Pratt&#x27;s death. In 2005 a sixth volume in this series was released, drawn by Pierre Wazeem and entitled &quot;Le chemin de fièvre&quot;. A seventh album was scheduled by the French publishers Casterman for release in March 2008. Casterman have also on several occasions hinted at the possible future release of a further episode in the Corto Maltese saga.

In 2015, IDW Publishing&#x27;s EuroComics imprint launched the definitive English-language edition of Corto Maltese, with new translations made from Pratt&#x27;s original Italian scripts.

==Documentaries==
Swiss director Stefano Knuchel started a trilogy of documentaries about Pratt, releasing &quot;Hugo en Afrique&quot; in 2009, followed by &quot;Hugo in Argentina&quot; in 2021. In 2022, Knuchel announced working on the third part of the trilogy, &quot;Hugo in Venice&quot;.

<text>The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, abbreviated as the C&amp;O Canal and occasionally called the Grand Old Ditch, operated from 1831 until 1924 along the Potomac River between Washington, D.C., and Cumberland, Maryland. It replaced the Potomac Canal, which shut down completely in 1828, and could operate during months in which the water level was too low for the former canal. The canal&#x27;s principal cargo was coal from the Allegheny Mountains.

Construction began in 1828 on the canal and ended in 1850 with the completion of a stretch to Cumberland, although the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad had already reached Cumberland in 1842. The canal had an elevation change of which required 74 canal locks, 11 aqueducts to cross major streams, more than 240 culverts to cross smaller streams, and the Paw Paw Tunnel. A planned section to the Ohio River at Pittsburgh was never built.

The canal is now maintained as the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park, with a trail that follows the old towpath.

==History==
===Early river projects===
After the American Revolutionary War, George Washington was the chief advocate of using waterways to connect the Eastern Seaboard to the Great Lakes and the Ohio River, which flows into the Mississippi River and ultimately to the Gulf of Mexico at New Orleans. In 1785, Washington founded the Potowmack Company to improve the navigability of the Potomac River. His company built five skirting canals around the major falls: Little Falls (later incorporated in the C&amp;O Canal), Great Falls in Virginia, Seneca Falls (opposite Violette&#x27;s lock), Payne&#x27;s Falls of the Shenandoah, and House&#x27;s Falls near Harpers Ferry. These canals allowed an easy downstream float; upstream journeys, propelled by pole, were harder.

Several kinds of watercraft were used on the Patowmack Canal and in the Potomac River. &quot;Gondolas&quot; were log rafts, usually sold at journey&#x27;s end for their wood by their owners, who returned upstream on foot. &quot;Sharpers&quot; were flat-bottomed boats, , usable only on high-water days, about 45 days per year.

===Construction===

====Planning====

The Erie Canal, built between 1817 and 1825, threatened traders south of New York City, who began to seek their own transportation infrastructure to link the burgeoning areas west of the Appalachian Mountains to mid-Atlantic markets and ports. As early as 1820, plans were being laid for a canal to link the Ohio River and Chesapeake Bay.

In early March 1825, President James Monroe signed the bill chartering the construction of the C&amp;O Canal as one of the last acts of his presidency. The plan was to build it in two sections, the eastern section from the tidewater of Washington, D.C., to Cumberland, Maryland; and the western section over the Allegheny Mountains to the Ohio River or one of its tributaries. Free from taxation, the canal company was required to have in use in five years, and to complete the canal in 12 years. The canal was engineered to have a water current, supplying the canal and assisting mules pulling boats downstream.

The eastern section was the only part to be completed.

On October 23, 1826, the engineers submitted the study, presenting the proposed canal route in three sections. The eastern section comprised Georgetown to Cumberland; the middle section, Cumberland (going up Wills Creek to Hyndman then across the Sand Patch Grade crossing the Eastern Continental Divide to Garrett) to the confluence of the Casselman River and the Youghiogheny River; and the western section from there to Pittsburgh.

The total estimated price tag, more than $22 million, dampened the enthusiasm of many supporters, who were expecting an estimate in the $4 million to $5 million range. At a convention in December 1826, they attempted to discredit the engineers&#x27; report, and offered lower estimates: Georgetown to Cumberland, $5,273,283; Georgetown to Pittsburgh, $13,768,152. Geddes and Roberts were hired to make another report, which they gave in 1828: $4,479,346.93 for Georgetown to Cumberland. With those numbers to encourage them, the stockholders formally organized the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company in June 1828. In the end, the final construction cost to Cumberland in 1850 was $11,071,075.21. Compared to the original cost given by the engineers in 1826 of about $8 million, removing things not in the estimate such as land purchases, engineering expenses, incidental damages, salaries, and fencing provision, the cost overrun was about 19%, which can be justified by the inflation rate of the period. The cost overrun of the other proposal (Geddes and Roberts) was about 51% thus showing that the original engineer&#x27;s estimate was good.

In 1824, the holdings of the Patowmack Company were ceded to the Chesapeake and Ohio Company. (Rejected names for the canal included the &quot;Potomac Canal&quot; and &quot;Union Canal&quot;.) By 1825, the Canal Company was authorized by an act of the General Assembly of Maryland in the amount of subscriptions of $500,000; this paved the way for future investments and loans. According to historians, those financial resources were expended until the State had prostrated itself on its own credit.

====Groundbreaking====
The C&amp;O&#x27;s first chief engineer was Benjamin Wright, formerly chief engineer of the Erie Canal. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on July 4, 1828, attended by U.S. president John Quincy Adams. The ceremony was held near Georgetown, at the canal&#x27;s eventual mark near Lock 6, the upstream end of the Little Falls skirting canal, and Dam No. 1.
At the groundbreaking, there was still argument over the eastern end of the canal. The directors thought that Little Falls (at the downstream end of the Patowmack Little Falls Skirting Canal) was sufficient since that literally fulfilled the charter&#x27;s condition of reaching the tidewater, but people in Washington wanted it to end in Washington, connecting to the Tiber Creek and Anacostia river. For that reason, the canal originally opened from Little Falls to Seneca, and the next year, was extended down to Georgetown.

The Little Falls skirting canal, which was part of the Patowmack Canal, was dredged to increase its depth from , and became part of the C&amp;O Canal.

The first president of the canal, Charles F. Mercer, insisted on perfection since this was a work of national importance. This would cost the company more money to build the canal. During his term, he forbade the use of slackwaters for navigation, the use of composite locks (see section below), or reduction of the cross section of the canal prism in difficult terrain. This reduced maintenance expenditures but increased construction costs. In the end, two slackwaters (Big Slackwater above Dam No. 4, and Little Slackwater above Dam No. 5) and multiple composite locks (Locks 58–71) were built.

At first, the canal company planned to use steamboats in the slackwaters, since without mules, the canal boats had to use oars to move upstream. After much discussion of the dangers of early steamboats, the company provided a towpath so that the mules could pull the boats through the slackwaters.

====Section numbers and contracts====
From Lock 5 at Little Falls to Cumberland (as mentioned above, the canal started at Little Falls, and was later extended down to Georgetown), the canal was divided into three divisions (of about apiece), each of which was further divided into 120 sections of about . A separate construction contract was issued for each section. Locks, culverts, dams, etc. were listed on the contracts by section number, not by mileage as is done today. For instance, Locks 5 and 6 are on Section No. 1, all the way to Guard Lock No. 8 on section 367. Sections A–H were in the Georgetown level below lock 5

====First part opened====
In November 1830, the canal opened from Little Falls to Seneca. The Georgetown section opened the following year.

====Dispute for Point of Rocks; second part opened====
In 1828, the C&amp;O Canal and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) began fighting for sole use of the narrow strip of available land along the Potomac River from Point of Rocks to Harpers Ferry. After a Maryland state court battle that involved Daniel Webster and Roger B. Taney, the companies agreed to share the right-of-way.

In August 1829, the canal company began importing indentured laborers to Alexandria and Georgetown. These workers were promised meat three times a day, vegetables, and a &quot;reasonable allowance of whiskey&quot;, $8 to $12 per month, $20 for masons. Still, many were dissatisfied with the slave-like conditions. Friction between the largest groups, from Ireland and Germany, meant they had to be kept in different crews.

The width of the canal prism above Harpers Ferry was reduced to , which saved money and was also appropriate from an engineering standpoint.

In 1830, Francis Scott Key left his Georgetown home due to the newly opened canal, which ran through his back garden.

In 1832, the canal company prohibited liquor in a bid to improve the speed of construction, but soon repealed its ban.

In August or September 1832, an epidemic of cholera swept through the construction camps, killing many workers and leading others to throw down their tools and flee.

By 1833, the canal&#x27;s Georgetown end was extended eastward to Tiber Creek, near the western terminus of the Washington City Canal, which extended through the future National Mall to the foot of the United States Capitol. A lock keeper&#x27;s house at the eastern end of this Washington Branch of the C&amp;O Canal remains at the southwest corner of Constitution Avenue and 17th Street, N.W., at the edge of the National Mall.

In 1834, the section to Harper&#x27;s Ferry opened and the canal reached Williamsport.

In 1836, the canal was used by canal packets as a Star Route to carry mail from Georgetown to Shepherdstown. The contract was held by Albert Humrickhouse at $1,000 &quot;per annum&quot; for a daily service of 72 book miles. The canal approached Hancock, Maryland, by 1839.

In March 1837, three surveys were made for a possible link to the northeast to Baltimore: via Westminster, via Monocacy-Linganore, and via Seneca, but they were all deemed impractical due to lack of water at the summit level.

The Canal reached Dam No. 6 (west of Hancock) in 1839.

As the canal approached Hancock, more construction problems surfaced. Limestone sinkholes and caverns caused the canal bottom to cave in near Shepherdstown, near Two Locks above Dam No. 4, around Four Locks, Big pool, and Roundtop Hill near Dam No. 6. On 6 December 1839, Chief Engineer Fisk wrote, &quot;These breaks have all evidently been occasioned by limestone sinks which exhibit themselves by a falling down of the bottom of the Canal into limestone caverns that are lower than, and extend out under the bed of the river: — in consequence of which the water from the Canal is at first conducted down below the canal bottom perhaps twenty or thirty feet and thence out along under the bed of the river ... It has been a matter of surprise to me that our Canal thus far has suffered so little from limesinks. We may yet however have much trouble from this source near and above the breach at Lock No. 37. For about a mile, there is scarcely a hundred feet in length of the canal in which there are not several small lime sink holes...&quot;. He recommended costly but necessary repairs, which were done by 1840.

Since it was difficult to obtain stone for the locks, engineers built composite locks, sometimes of kyanized wood.

In 1843, the Potomac Aqueduct Bridge was built near the present-day Francis Scott Key Bridge to connect the canal to the Alexandria Canal, which led to Alexandria, Virginia.

In April 1843, floods damaged much of the finished portion of the canal between Georgetown and Harpers Ferry, including the Shenandoah river lock. One flood suspended navigation for 103 days. The company raised the embankments around Little Falls, and made a &quot;tumbling waste&quot; near the 4-mile marker.

====Last 50 miles====

Building the last segment proved difficult and expensive. Allen Bowie Davis took on the role of management. In Cumberland, Dam No. 8 and Guard Lock No. 8 had begun construction in 1837 and the final locks (70–75) to Cumberland were completed around 1840. That left an segment in the middle, which would eventually require building the Paw Paw tunnel, digging the deep cut at Oldtown, and building 17 locks.

Near Paw Paw, the engineers had no good solutions. If they followed the river, they would have to cross over to West Virginia to avoid the cliffs, and an agreement with the B&amp;O Railroad specified that the canal would avoid the south side of the river, unless it was a place where the railroad would not need it. So they took the more expensive decision to build a tunnel through the mountain. The initial cost estimate of $33,500 proved far too low. The tunnel was completed for $616,478.65 Among the components of the project, a kiln was built to provide bricks to line the tunnel.
Originally, the company intended to go around Cumberland, behind the town of Wills Creek, but complaints from the citizens and the city caused the board to change their plans, routing the canal through the center of town.

The canal was opened for trade to Cumberland on Thursday, October 10, 1850. On the first day, five canal boats, &quot;Southampton, Elizabeth, Ohio, Delaware&quot; and &quot;Freeman Rawdon&quot; loaded with a total of 491 tons of coal, came down from Cumberland. In one day, the C&amp;O carried more coal in the first day of business than the Lehigh Canal for their full year of business in 1820.

Yet in 1850, the B&amp;O Railroad had already been operating in Cumberland for eight years, and the Canal suffered financially. Debt-ridden, the company dropped its plan to continue construction of the next of the canal into the Ohio Valley. The company long realized (especially with the experience at the Paw Paw tunnel) that construction over the mountains going to Pittsburgh was &quot;wildly unrealistic&quot;. Occasionally there was talk of continuing the canal, e.g. in 1874, an long tunnel was proposed to go through the Allegheny Mountains. Nevertheless, there was a tunnel built to connect with the Pennsylvania canal.

Even though the railroad beat the canal to Cumberland, the canal was not entirely obsolete. It wasn&#x27;t until the mid-1870s that improved technology, specifically with larger locomotives and air brakes, allowed the railroad to set rates lower than the canal, and thus seal its fate.

Sometime after the canal opened in 1850, a commemorative obelisk was erected near its Georgetown terminus.

===Intervening years===
The canal deteriorated during the Civil War. In 1869, the company&#x27;s annual report said, &quot;During the last ten years little or nothing had been done toward repairing and improving lock-houses, culverts, aqueducts, locks, lock-gates and waste weirs of the Company; many of them had become entirely unfit for use and were becoming worthless, rendering it absolutely essential to the requirements of the Company to have them repaired.&quot; Still, some improvements were made in the late 1860s, such as replacing Dams No. 4 and 5.

The early 1870s, which Unrau calls the &quot;Golden Years&quot;, were particularly profitable. The company repaid some of its bonds. It made many improvements to the canal, including the installation of a telephone system. Yet there were still floods and other problems. By 1872, so many vessels were unfit for navigation that the company required boats to undergo annual inspections and registration. In July 1876, the crew of the &quot;Lezan Ragan&quot; stayed afloat while loading in Cumberland only by her crew&#x27;s pumping. She hit some abutments of the locks near Great Falls, and finally sank at the opening Lock 15 (at the head of Widewater).

For a brief period in the 1860s and 1870s, the company attempted to prevent boating on Sundays. But boatmen broke padlocks on the lock gates and turned to violence when confronted. The company gave up trying to enforce the rule.

The trip from Cumberland to Georgetown generally took about seven days. The fastest known time from Georgetown to Cumberland for a light boat was 62 hours, set by Raleigh Bender from Sharpsburg. Dent Shupp made it from Cumberland to Williamsport in 35 hours with 128 tons of coal.

===Receivership===
Following the disastrous flood of 1889, the canal company entered receivership with court-appointed trustees. The trustees were given the right to repair and operate the canal under continued court oversight. The trustees represented the majority owners of the C&amp;O Canal Company bonds issued in 1844. While the B&amp;O owned the majority of the 1878 bonds, the B&amp;O did not own a majority of the 1844 bonds as of 1890. However, by 1903, the B&amp;O had acquired sufficient bonds to become &quot;a majority holder&quot;, the reported reason being &quot;to secure for the Wabash [railroad] system a foothold on the Atlantic seaboard&quot; which had only been incorporated in February 1903.

Over the next decade, and particularly after 1902, boats on the canal shifted from independent operators to company-owned craft. Boats with colorful names (&quot;Bertha M. Young&quot; or &quot;Lezen Ragan&quot;) gave way to numbered craft (&quot;Canal Towage Company&quot; with a number) run by a schedule.

Despite the B&amp;O&#x27;s status as a majority bondholder, the B&amp;O can not be said to have ever owned the C&amp;O. This did not stop the B&amp;O from trying to sell it. In 1936, the B&amp;O attempted to sell part of the canal from Point of Rocks to the District line. This was blocked by the courts which had continued to oversee the C&amp;O trustees with the court saying &quot;It is of course well known that the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company is not the owner of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal.&quot; At that time, the court also stated that the canal could not be sold in pieces but only in its entirety. In 1938, new trustees were appointed by the court to handle the sale under the court&#x27;s continued oversight.

==Tolls and revenue==

Tolls were charged for cargo on the canal. In 1851, for instance, the toll rates on the Canal were set as follows:

Tolls varied greatly, and frequently the board adopted new toll rates.

Some boatmen would try to ship in the boats extra cargo not listed on the waybills to avoid tolls. In 1873, for instance, one boat got from Georgetown to Harpers Ferry with 225 hidden sacks of salt before the company found out.
The items transported on the canal varied. In 1845, for instance, before the canal&#x27;s completion, the shipments were as follows:

===Business after 1891===

After 1891, the canal principally transported coal, and sometimes West Virginia limestone, wood, lumber, sand, and flour. (Statistics were only kept for coal.) Coal was loaded in the Cumberland basin, which consisted of dumping four carloads of coal into the boat. Some of the coal had to be shoveled by hand into the spaces beneath the cabins. During the loading process, nobody would be on the boat due to the dust, and mules were kept off, in case the boat sank from being loaded. Despite closing windows, dust usually entered the cabins. After loading, the ridge poles would be put, then the hatches over the ridge poles and openings. The crew would scrub down the boat (using water from the canal) to remove the dust, and the boat would be poled to the other side of the basin, where it would be hitched to the mules.

Boatmen came down to lock 5, called &quot;Willard&#x27;s lock&quot; or &quot;Waybill Lock&quot;, whereupon the lock tender would sign the waybill, and report it to the office. If they did not get orders at that lock, they waited near the aqueduct bridge in Georgetown, until orders came through. A tugboat on the river would pull the boats to other points, e.g. Navy Yard, Indian Head and Alexandria. Some coal loads were unloaded directly in the Georgetown coal yards, using buckets. Coal was also unloaded onto ocean sailing vessels bound for Massachusetts (which brought ice, and returned with coal), a 4 masted vessel holding about 20 boatloads of coal.

In the last few years, the tonnage and tolls for coal were as follows

One of the more unusual loads was a circus with about 9 people with their equipment, which included a black bear. They were transported from Oldtown, Maryland to Harpers Ferry. The black bear got loose on the journey, and the boatman told them, &quot;You tie that thing good or you&#x27;re never going to get to Harpers Ferry, for I&#x27;m going to leave the boat.&quot;

Other loads included furniture (often second hand), pianos, a parlor suites, watermelons, fish (such as shad and herring), as well as transporting items such as flour or molasses to sell to lockkeepers, as some of the lockkeepers in remote areas needed the boats to bring their supplies. Cement from the Round Top Mill above Hancock was also shipped to Georgetown. Some would pole across the river at Dam No. 2 to get wood, cross-ties, bark (used in tanning), and sometimes grain. Other loads, often carried upstream, included 600 empty barrels in a boat, taken to Shepherdstown to load cement, lumber, fertilizer, and general merchandise for stores along the canal, as well as oysters in barrels, complete materials to build a house, ear corn, and even extra mules.

===Fines===
The company levied fines for infractions, such as traveling without a waybill or destruction of canal property such as lock gates or canal masonry. For instance:

* May 30, 1877, Capt. Thomas Fisher fined $10 (about US$423 in 2012) for passing through lock without waybill
* Oct 22, 1877, R. Cropley&#x27;s scow, fined $25 for knocking out gate in Lock No. 5 [Brookmont Lock]
* Nov. 12, 1877, Capt. Joseph Little, fined $10 for running into crib at Lock No. 9 [Seven Locks]
* July 4, 1878, Boat John Sherman, fined $62.70 for unloading and raising (note: this was on Independence Day)
* Aug 30, 1878, Steamer Scrivenes, fined $50, Allowing the &quot;Bertha M. Young&quot; in tow to sink on Level 36 and abandoning her at night without giving notice, causing navigation to be suspended 36 hrs.
* May 5, 1879, Capt. Jacob Hooker fined $40, Running into and breaking gate at Lock No. 40
* Jan 14, 1880, Boat Harry &amp; Ralph, fined $5, Running into gate at Darbey&#x27;s Lock (Note: this was in winter, when the canal was usually drained for repairs.)
* Jun 12, 1880, G.L. Booth, fined $4.40, for pumping.

===Business after 1924===
The last known boat to carry coal was Pat Boyer&#x27;s Boat #5, which returned to Cumberland on November 27, 1923. The only boats recorded to operate in 1924 were five boats that carried sand from Georgetown to Williamsport to construct a power plant.

====Flood of 1924====
The flood of 1924 caused major damage to the canal. Most of the railroad and canal bridges near Hancock were destroyed, a breach opened in Dam No. 1, and much damage to the banks and masonry of the canal occurred. Although the railroad did some maintenance, ostensibly so that the canal could quickly be restored to operation, mainly the Georgetown level (Dam No. 1 and below) was fixed to supply Georgetown&#x27;s mills with water for operation. The rest of the canal remained in disrepair.

The boating season lasted only three months in 1924, and after the flood, navigation ceased. Unfortunately, some communities such as Glen Echo and Cumberland already used the canal to dump sewage, and G.L. Nicholson called the canal a &quot;public nuisance&quot; due to the sewage and being a breeding ground for mosquitoes

In 1928–1929, there was some talk of restoring and reopening the canal from Cumberland to Williamsport, but with the onset of the Great Depression, the plans were never realized In April 1929 after some freshet damage, the railroad repaired a break in the towpath, so that they could continue to flush out mosquitoes as demanded by the Maryland board of health.

The boatmen, now unemployed, went to work for railroads, quarries, farms, and some retired. At that date, the only other canal using mules, was the Lehigh Canal, which was soon to close in 1940.

Some of the lockkeepers stayed on, and there were a few canal superintendents were listed for the now disused canal.

====Flood of 1936====

This winter flood in March 1936 caused even more damage to the abandoned canal, still recovering from the damage caused by the extreme floods just over a decade prior. This flood, caused by the thawing of earlier ice, combined with the flow of heavy rains, led to the highest water mark the Potomac River had ever had thus far, destroying lockhouses, levels, and other structures. There were some efforts at restoration, mainly to the Georgetown level so that the factories could have their water supply. Due to the inattention of the B&amp;O Railroad, the canal became a &quot;magnificent wreck&quot; and would need intense repairs and reconstruction throughout many areas destroyed by the floods.

===National Historical Park===

In 1938, the abandoned canal was obtained from the bondholders by the United States in exchange for a loan from the federal Reconstruction Finance Corporation, and is now the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park.

==Locks and engineering==
===Canal prism===
The dimensions of the canal vary quite a bit. Below Lock 5, the width is 80 feet wide and 6 feet deep. Above Lock 5 to Harper&#x27;s Ferry it is 60 feet wide and 6 feet deep, and above Harper&#x27;s Ferry, 50 feet wide.

===Lift locks and guard locks===
To build the canal, the C&amp;O Canal Company used a total of 74 lift locks that raised the canal from sea level at Georgetown to at Cumberland. Locks 8–27 and their accompanying lock houses were made from Seneca red sandstone, quarried from the Seneca Quarry, as was Aqueduct No. 1, better known as Seneca Aqueduct. This unique structure is the only aqueduct made from Seneca red sandstone and is doubly unique for being the only aqueduct on the C&amp;O that is also a lock (Lock 24, Riley&#x27;s Lock).

Seven guard locks, often called inlet locks (numbered 1 through 8) were built to allow water and sometimes boats (particularly at Big Slackwater and Little Slackwater) to enter. Dam #7 and Guard Lock #7 were proposed (near mile 164 at the South Branch of the Potomac) but never built. In 1856, there was a steam pump put at that site. Later, in 1872, a new steam pump was put near mile 174.

Three additional river locks were built, to allow boats to enter the canal at the river, as demanded by the Virginia legislature for buying canal stock. They were at Goose Creek (below Edwards Ferry, Lock 25), near the Shenendoah River just below Lock 33, and at Shepherdstown.

The Goose Creek locks were to allow boats from the Goose Creek and Little River Navigation Company to enter. Only one Goose Creek boat was documented to enter the C&amp;O canal, and there is no documentation of a C&amp;O boat entering Goose Creek. The lock was eventually converted into a waste weir.

The Shenandoah river (about below Lock 33) lock let boats cross to Harpers Ferry with the mules walking on the railroad bridge, up the Shenandoah river, to the old Potomac Canal Bypass on the Shenandoah river by Virginius island. The railroad refused to let mules walk on the bridge, and from lack of business, the lock was abandoned. Stones from that lock were used for other purposes.

After the 1889 flood destroyed the nearby dam in Shepherdstown, the raison d&#x27;être for the Shepherdstown lock was gone, and so it was filled in.

At night, lock tenders were required to remove the cranks and handles from all paddle valves to prevent unauthorized use.

====Composite locks====

Despite Mercer not wanting any composite locks, due to measures to economize on the last of construction, and the scarcity of good building stone, Locks 58–71 were constructed as composite locks, whereby the lock masonry is built of rubble and inferior undressed stone. Since that makes a rough surface which damages the boats, the locks were originally lined with wood to protect the boats. This wood sheathing had to be replaced. In time, some of the composite locks were lined with concrete, since the wood kept rotting.

===Levels===
The stretch of canal between locks is called a level. Canalers called these levels by their lengths; for instance, the longest level was the 14 mile level, which was about 14 miles long, and ran from Lock 50 (at 4 locks) to Lock 51 in Hancock. Some levels had additional nicknames (since some had similar lengths), e.g. &quot;Four Mile Level below Dam 6&quot;, &quot;Four Mile Level Big Slackwater&quot;, or &quot;Four Mile Level of the Log Wall&quot; (which is between locks 14 and 15, includes Widewater, Anglers, Carderock, Billy Goat Trails B, and C, and the downstream entrance to Trail A, all connect on that level). Levels less than a mile between locks were called short levels. Waste weirs and bypass flumes at the locks helped control the height of water in the levels (see below about waste weirs).

===Feeders===
There were three streams used as feeders: Rocky Run feeder (section #9, around 7 Locks), Great Falls feeder (section #18) and the Tuscarora feeder (section #78). There was a contemplated feeder at the Monocacy (not built). Of course, the remains of the Potomac Company Little Falls skirting canal was used as a feeder also. Inlet Lock No. 2 is called the Seneca Feeder in historic documents.

The remains of the Tuscarora feeder can still be seen, but it was made redundant by Dam No. 3 and was no longer used.

===Slackwater navigation===

Despite Charles F. Mercer, two slackwaters were used for navigation: Big Slackwater at Dam No. 4, and Little Slackwater at Dam No. 5. Big Slackwater is about long, Little Slackwater is about long. The boats had to navigate despite winds, currents, and debris in the channel. In February 1837, the board of directors discussed using steam power in the slackwater for the boats, but instead decided on a permanent towpath. The towpath for Big Slackwater was completed in 1838 for $31,416.36, and the towpath for Little Slackwater was completed in 1839 for $8,204.40.

Little Slackwater was a tricky place to navigate. Not only did it have a lot of hairpin turns, but also just before Guard Lock No. 5, there was a strip of land in the water called &quot;the pier&quot; (that exists even today): loaded boats going downstream would have to go outside the pier, and unloaded boats on the inside, thus making steering difficult for the loaded boats to get into the lock. If the current was fast in the river it could go as fast as the boat, rendering the tiller useless, and thus, a boat could be almost impossible to steer. One man reported that at the slackwater, they had him sit at the front of the boat with a hatchet in case they had to cut the towline [since it would pull the mules into the river], and had a couple of [wooden] hatches turned upside down, so that they could escape to shore on the hatches. On 1 May 1903, the towline to Boat No. 6 broke, with Captain Keim, Mrs. Keim, their two daughters, and Harry Newkirk aboard. One daughter drowned, another suffered a broken leg, and the captain died later of injuries. The rest (including the mules aboard) survived.

Boatmen reported that it was easier to navigate in the slackwaters than the aqueducts, since there was room for the water to move around the boat. Places like aqueducts, where there was little room for the water to move, were difficult for the mules to pull the boat through.

===Waste weirs, spillways, and informal overflows (mule drinks)===

To regulate the level of water in the canal prism, waste weirs, informal overflows, and spillways were used.

Waste weirs removed the surges of water from storms or excess when a lock was emptied. Boards could be removed or added to adjust the amount of water in the level. If one had to empty the whole level for winter, repairs, or emergencies, waste weirs often had paddle valves (similar to those found in locks) at the bottom which could be opened to let the water out.

Waste weirs come in several styles. Originally they were made of concrete masonry with boards on top making a bridge with mules to pass over. A possible example of an old-style waste weir (abandoned) is at 39.49 miles, above Lock 26 (Wood&#x27;s Lock). Most of these old waste weirs were replaced with concrete structures in 1906. Another used to be at Pennyfield lock in 1909–1911.

Spillways are made of concrete, and can be on either side, but if on the towpath side, have a bridge so people (and mules) can cross without getting the feet wet. High water simply flows over the spillway and out of the canal. The longest spillway, near Chain Bridge, is 354 feet long, was made in 1830 (but has been worked on since). Another spillway near Foxhall road at mile 1.51, was made in 1835. The spillway and waste weir at Big Pool was built in the 1840s
An informal overflow or mule drink was a dip in the towpath allowing water to flow over, similar to a spillway, but without the bridge or the concrete construction (hence, were more informal). The canalers called these &quot;mule drinks&quot;. There are documented informal overflows at mileage 10.76, 49.70, and 58.08. These usually had a drainage ditch which was riprapped with stone to prevent erosion. Historically the towpath dropped two feet to form this overflow. Due to silting, construction, etc. many of these overflows are now difficult to find. Hahn states that clues to finding these overflows include: a gully without a culvert, a sudden lowering of the towpath, or the signs of riprap on the towpath or the gully itself. Many of these (e.g. the one at Pennyfield lock) were replaced by a waste weir.

===Paw Paw tunnel===

One of the most impressive engineering features of the canal is the Paw Paw Tunnel, which runs for under a mountain. Built to save of construction around the obstacle, the tunnel used over six million bricks. The tunnel took almost twelve years to build; in the end, the tunnel was only wide enough for single lane traffic. One notorious incident included two captains who refused to budge for several days. The company official threw green cornstalks onto a roaring fire at the upwind portion of the tunnel, smoking the offenders out.

===Inclined plane===
Engineer William Rich Hutton was instrumental in getting the inclined plane built. Starting in 1875, a canal inclined plane was built upriver from Georgetown, so that boats whose destination was downriver from Washington could bypass the congestion (and price gouging of independent wharf owners) in Georgetown. Originally the company planned to build a river lock, but then discovered that such a lock occasionally would consume more water than the level could provide. They then planned to make an inclined plane, much like the Morris Canal. The first boat went through in 1876; 1,918 boats used the inclined plane that first year. Usage reports conflict: Hahn reports that was only really used for two years, and sporadically in 1889, yet Skramstad reports that due to flood damage in 1880 to the Rock Creek outlet, any boat until 1889 (when another flood wrecked the canal) going further down the Potomac than Georgetown, had to use the inclined plane. Although Hahn says it was the largest inclined plane in the world at that time, it was long, which is short compared to Plane 9 West of the Morris Canal at . It originally used a turbine to power it (like the Morris Canal) but was later switched to use steam power.

The inclined plane was dismantled after a major flood in 1889 when ownership of the canal transferred to the B&amp;O Railroad, which operated the canal to prevent its right of way (particularly at Point of Rocks) from falling into the hands of the Western Maryland Railway.

===Telephone system===
In the late 1870s, the Company installed a telephone system, rather than a telegraph as was the railroad practice, for $15,000. Completed in October 1879, it had 43 stations along the canal. It was divided into sections with three switches, placed respectively at Dam No. 4, Dam No. 6, and Wood&#x27;s Lock (head of 9 Mile level, i.e. Lock 26). It is unknown if there are currently any remains of this system.

===Culverts===

To carry small streams under the canal, 182 culverts, usually of masonry, were built. For instance, culvert #30 was built in 1835 to carry Muddy Branch under the canal. Unfortunately culverts are prone to collapse due to tree roots growing into the canal prism; in addition, rubbish from floods plug culverts, causing floods and more damage. Some culverts have disappeared or were abandoned, although they still appear in company records.

===Aqueducts===
Eleven aqueducts carried the canal over rivers and large streams that were too large to run through a culvert.

===Canal repairs===

The canal hired level walkers to walk the level with a shovel, looking for leaks, and repairing them. Large leaks were reported to the division superintendent, who would send out a crew with a repair scow.

Boatmen said that crabs caused leaks, as did muskrats. The company gave a 25 cent bounty on each muskrat.

==Boats on the canal==

At first the board of directors discussed having boats similar to the dimensions on the Erie Canal: wide with a draft of , traveling at . Later, Chief Engineer Benjamin Wright submitted a suggestion with the dimensions of the boats being wide and long, with a draft, to take advantage of the lock sizes and prism depth. That would permit boats with cargo up to 130 tons. Wright also suggested for passenger boats, having a draft of 10 inches (not including the keel) pulled by 4 horses at 7 miles per hour.

The following classifications of boats originally defined for the canal were as follows:

* Packet Boats, for passengers
* Freight boats
* Scows, especially work scows for construction and maintenance, as well as ice breaking 
* Gondolas

Rafts were, from time to time, on the canal, as well as launches and canoes. By 1835 (no doubt due to complaints about drifting rafts) the company put rates unfavorably against rafts. Farmers would build watercraft which were to last only one trip (to transport their wares) and then be sold in Georgetown for firewood.

Classifications were to change. In 1851, after the opening of the canal to Cumberland, the company adopted new classes of boats: A, B, C, D, E, and F, depending on dimensions and tonnage as follows:

Later years of Canal trade showed a predominance of coal carrying boats. In 1875, the register lists 283 boats owned by coal companies, and of the 108 other boats, 8 were listed as grain carrying, 1 brick, and 1 limestone carrying boat, with the other 91 being general.

During the declining years, freight boats were generally made in Cumberland. Freight boats in those years had two hulls, with 4 inches between them. There were holes (covered, when not in use) that one could put a pump in to pump out the bilge.

===Double boats===
In 1875, the Canal Company announced its intention to double the lengths of the locks to allow double boats to pass through the canal, i.e. two boats, one behind the other, which could be towed, reducing freight costs by 50%. The Maryland Coal Company experimented with such boats, but the floods in the late 1870s destroyed these dreams. The first lock to be extended to allow double boats was Edwards Ferry (Lock 25). Locks 25–32 were extended as such, as well as others, for a total of 14 extended locks on the canal.

===Traffic regulations===
Boats were to keep to the right. Certain craft had preference over others: &quot;boats had the right of way over rafts, descending boats over ascending craft, packets over freight boats at all times, and packets carrying the mail over all others&quot;, and later, repair boats actively involved in repair had preference over everybody else. The boat which did not have preference would slow down the mule team, the rope would sink to the bottom of the canal, and the other boat would float over it, and the mules would walk over also. The towline of the one boat would be unhitched so the lines would not tangle, but sometimes they did. There is one report of a towline snagging on the other boat, and the boatman running the boat into the towpath so as not to drag the other mules into the canal.

It was forbidden to moor boats, rafts, or anything on the towpath side of the canal (which would, of course, impede any traffic at night). For that reason, boats would tie up on the berm side for the night.

Due to problems, on April 1, 1851, the company printed a 47-page booklet with new traffic regulations on the canal, detailing every aspect of operation, as well as fines for violations, and were printed in great numbers and distributed to boatmen and company officials.

The typical boating season ran from April until late November or December when the canal froze over. There were some occasions, for instance, during the Civil War, where the company tried to keep the canal open all year round.

===Boat repairs===
Boats carried oakum and chisels to patch leaks. There were also boat repair areas, for instance, beside Lock 35 and at Lock 47 (Four Locks), to repair boats. The boat would settle on raised beams (at lock 35, they were made of concrete), as the drydock was drained, and the men could make the necessary repairs, using tin and tar. Originally, the canal plans did not have provisions for drydocks or repairs of boats, but by 1838 there were frequent complaints about drifting rafts and wrecks obstructing navigation. The company made provisions for drydocks to help the situation. In the mid-1800s the Canal Company authorized at least 6 drydocks, documented at the following locations: Locks 45–46, Lock 47 (Four Locks), Lock 44 (Shepherdstown), above Lock 14 (near Carderock), Edwards Ferry (Lock 25), and in the rear of Lock 10 (Seven Locks).

===Icebreakers===
Icebreakers were used on the canal, for instance, at the end of the boating season when winter froze the canal, so that the last group of boats could go home. The icebreaker was typically a company scow filled with pig iron. Mules would pull the boat onto the ice, and the weight would break the ice. During the Civil war, the canal company attempted to keep the canal open during the winters of 1861–1862, despite the fact that winters were usually for repairs. Icebreaker boats were used to keep the channel free of ice, so that the military could move supplies.

===Mules===

Most boats were drawn by mules. Mules lasted about 15 years. Mules were often changed at locks, over gangplanks. Some boatmen would change teams by making the mules swim to the shore to change teams, leading to mules drowning as a result. Mules were bought, at years, often from Kentucky, and were broken in by having them drag logs. The command to stop mules was not &quot;whoa&quot; but &quot;ye–yip–ye&quot;.

Getting a fully loaded boat moving was not easy for the mules, and overdriving them, especially at the basin in Cumberland where there was no water current to help them move the boat, was common, resulting in many mules. To get a loaded boat going, the mules would have to walk until the line was taut, then put their weight into it, and step once the boat had moved, and repeat this process. Within 25 feet, the boat would be moving.

Mules were shod every other trip in Cumberland, although sometimes they had to be shod every trip. Mules were harnessed, one behind the other, slantwise, which (for some reason) pulled the boat straighter, than if they were abreast.

&quot;Drivers&quot; were the people (often children) who drove the mules on the towpaths: on the C&amp;O they were not called &quot;muleskinners&quot; nor &quot;hoggees&quot; (the latter term was used on the Erie Canal)

Dogs were useful to a boat captain on the canal to drive mules and also to swim to take the towline to hitch the mules. Joe Sandblower had a dog which would hunt muskrats along the canal, and he would sell the pelts and collect the bounty on muskrats. There is a documented cat on the canal boat, as well as a raccoon.

===Horses===
Horses were occasionally used to pull boats, but they did not last as long as mules. In the 1900s, a large white horse was used in Cumberland basin like a switching engine, to pull coal cars so that the coal could be loaded into the canal boats.

===Steamboats on the canal===
 There were occasionally steam boats, one being authorized in 1824. In 1850, the N S Denny company operated some steam driven tugboats on the Canal. The board of directors discussed having steamboats for Big Slackwater, but that was abandoned in favor of a towpath along the side. Records indicate that in the 1879, a single steamboat could go loaded downstream, unloaded going upstream, and took 5 to 7 minutes to lock through whether going upstream or downstream (respectively) and used about a ton of coal per day for operation.

===Boatmen and boat families===
The boatmen (usually with their families) were a rough independent lot, forming a class within themselves, and intermarrying within their own group. They frequently fought amongst each other for any reason, be it racial slurs (real or perceived), precedence at a lock, or for exercise. They fought with lockkeepers over company rules, or even with the company for changes in toll rates. During winter when the boats were tied up, they often lived in their own communities away from others. One boat captain observed that on the canal, women and children were as good as the men, and if it weren&#x27;t for the children, the canal wouldn&#x27;t run one day.

On April 2, 1831, Daniel Van Slyke reported:

it is with great difficulty we have been able to preserve order among the boatmen, who in striving to push forward for a preference in passing the several locks are sometimes dis-posed to injure each other&#x27;s boats as a means of carrying their point. An unfortunate in-stance of this kind happened on Wednesday last at the locks on the 9th section. A strongly constructed boat ran her bow against a gondola loaded with flour, and so much injured her as to render it necessary to transship the load. But no damage was done to the cargo.

One notorious incident occurred in May 1874 when George Reed of the &quot;Mayfield and Heison&quot; was fined $20 for mooring his boat illegally in the Cumberland Basin. He refused to pay the fine. At Lock 74, he forced his way past the lockkeepers who tried to prevent him from continuing, and he was given an additional fine of $50. He continued (without paying), forced his way through the locks at Harpers Ferry and Lock 5, until Georgetown, where he was served notice for $120 in fees plus $4.08 for the waybill. When he got back to Cumberland, his boat was confiscated until he paid the whole $124.08.

Recklessness among the boatmen was common. Many accidents were due to excessive speed. Aqueduct #3 (Catoctin) had a sharp bend at the upstream end, had been the site of a number of collisions from boatmen going too fast. In July 1855, a freight boat collided with a packet boat which sank. One of the most frequent problems was careless boatmen in their rush to lock through, hitting lock gates.

Many of the men, particularly boat captains, said they knew nothing else [except boating]. One woman said, &quot;The children are brought up on the boat and don&#x27;t know nothin&#x27; else, and that is the only reason they take up &#x27;boating&#x27;. Boys work for their fathers until they are big enough to get a boat of their own, and it&#x27;s always easy to get a boat.&quot;

====Hours and wages====
Fifteen hours a day was the minimum, 18 hours were the most frequently reported, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. Boatman said, &quot;It never rains, snows, or blows for a boatman, and a boatman never has no Sundays.&quot; and, &quot;We don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s Sunday, till we see some folks along the way, dressed up and a-gin&#x27; to Sunday School.&quot;

Captains were paid per trip, receiving $70 to $80 per trip in the 1920s, and receiving less than $1,250 per year. Deck hands were paid $12 to $20 per trip, sometimes receiving clothes in lieu of wages or for part of their wages.

The boating season ran from approximately March until December, with the canal drained during winter months to prevent damage from ice and also for repairs.

====Women====
Women attended to household chores, steered boats, and gave birth on the boats, although if possible, a midwife would be secured if they were near a town. After birth, the journey would resume, with the man handling the chores including cooking. Often if the husband died, the widow would continue managing and operating the boat. Women often served as lock tenders also. One mother had 14 children, all born on boats, and never had a physician attending.

====Children====

The U.S. Department of Labor stated that only the limitations of physical strength prevented the children from performing all operations connected with handling boats. Otho Swain reported he saw a ten-year-old girl put a boat through a lock (i.e. snubbing the boat so it would stop), but that would have been a child who grew up on the canal.

Children generally did the mule driving, except perhaps at night when the captain might do so. In wet weather, the towpath was muddy and slippery and shoes wore out quickly. One man thought himself to be a good father because he provided his boys with rubber boots.

One boatman said, &quot;A boat is a poor place for little children, for all they can do is go in and out of the cabin.&quot; His son attended school 94 days out of a possible 178, and the father regretted it, but needed the family to help boat as he could not afford otherwise.

====Medical care====
For boat families, there was very little medical care. One father stated, &quot;We never need a doctor. We just stay sick until we get well.&quot; It was practically impossible to get a doctor in the mountains at the upper end of the canal or on the long levels.

====Food====

Canned food was sometimes brought. Bean soup, made with beans, ham hocks, and an onion, was common. Other items included corn bread, eggs and bacon, ham, potatoes, and other vegetables. A reported canal custom was the first few rows of corn from farms along the canal could be used by the boatmen. Berries along the towpath were also picked. Molasses also was common. Bread and many groceries could be bought along the canal. Muskrats were sometimes eaten, as well as chickens and ducks either bought or even stolen along the way. Rabbits were snared. Crew members sometimes had a shotgun to shoot rabbits, groundhogs, or other game. Turtles were eaten as well as eels that the lock tenders caught in eel pots in the rivers or the bypass flumes. Fish included sunfish, catfish, bigmouth bass, and black bass.

====Living quarters====
Cabins were 10 feet by 12 feet, and housed two bunks, each 36 inches wide, supposedly for one person, but often occupied by two. While most cabin floors were bare, in one survey, 14 had linoleum covering. The cabins were divided between sleeping quarters and the &quot;stateroom&quot; by a diagonal wall. The feed box, 4 feet by 4 feet, in the center boat, often doubled as sleeping quarters with a blanket thrown over the feed. Occasionally the deck was used for sleeping

Cooking was done on a stove, burning corncobs (from the mule feed) or sometimes coal. Washing clothes and children was typically done at night by moonlight, after tying up the boat, along the side of the canal. Food and provisions for the trip (e.g. flour, sugar, coffee, salt pork, smoked meat, etc.) were bought in Cumberland on Wineow street, from stores such as Coulehan&#x27;s, Dennis Murphy&#x27;s, or John McGrinnis&#x27;s. Some boatmen carried chickens or pigs on the boats. Fish caught in the canal also served as food, as well as turtles. Additional supplies could be bought along the way from lockkeepers and at towns.

==Legends and ghosts==
Many legends have been documented along the canal during its operating days:
* On the 9 mile level around the 33–34 mile mark, some boats were used to transport soldiers to the Battle of Ball&#x27;s Bluff during the American Civil War. One of the boats sank, and it was said that departed ghosts of the soldiers haunted the area. Canallers would avoid tying up at night in that area. It was also said that the mules would sense it, and would hurry through the area (it was also called &quot;Haunted House Bend&quot;), and also that there were tales of a ghost dog there.
* There was reported the ghost of an Indian chief on the 14 mile level around Big Pool.
* A lady ghost was reported on the 2 mile level at Catoctin (between locks 28 and 29) which would walk over the waste weir, down the towpath and to the river.
* A headless man was reported to haunt the Paw Paw Tunnel.
* A Romeo and Juliet like-story was documented near Lock 69 (Twigg&#x27;s lock). (See Locks on the C&amp;O Canal#Lock names for more info).

* A report of &quot;buried treasure&quot; somewhere between Nolands Ferry and the Monocacy river, that could be found if one followed a ghost of a robber, allegedly seen from time to time on moonless nights crossing the Monocacy Aqueduct carrying a lantern.

==Points of interest==
Here is a list of items on the canal, as a canaller traveling by boat from Georgetown to Cumberland would see. (Note: some present day items are on this list also.) A typical canaller would know the canal by the names of the levels and the locks. Most list of points of the canal&#x27;s points of interest do not contain a list of the levels with their names like we have here. Also note that most lists of locks do not include Guard Locks 4 and 5, which a boat would have to pass through, if navigating the entire canal (It was generally possible for boats to pass through the other guard locks also, but that is if they were going to other destinations, usually on the Virginia/West Virginia side of the river). Also note sometimes there are often slight discrepancies in mileages, for instance NPS and Hahn reports Lock 75 at 175.60 miles, Davies lists &quot;175.35 (175.50)&quot;, and Hahn also reports the NPS mile markers are in the wrong place from Milepost 117 to Lock 51, further adding to the confusion. Also note that Some streets in Georgetown were renamed, mostly as numbered streets, pursuant to an 1895 law. &quot;See&quot; Georgetown street renaming.

<text>A park is an area of natural, semi-natural or planted space set aside for human enjoyment and recreation or for the protection of wildlife or natural habitats. Urban parks are green spaces set aside for recreation inside towns and cities. National parks and country parks are green spaces used for recreation in the countryside. State parks and provincial parks are administered by sub-national government states and agencies. Parks may consist of grassy areas, rocks, soil and trees, but may also contain buildings and other artifacts such as monuments, fountains or playground structures. Many parks have fields for playing sports such as baseball and football, and paved areas for games such as basketball. Many parks have trails for walking, biking and other activities. Some parks are built adjacent to bodies of water or watercourses and may comprise a beach or boat dock area. Urban parks often have benches for sitting and may contain picnic tables and barbecue grills.

The largest parks can be vast natural areas of hundreds of thousands of square kilometers (or square miles), with abundant wildlife and natural features such as mountains and rivers. In many large parks, camping in tents is allowed with a permit. Many natural parks are protected by law, and users may have to follow restrictions (e.g. rules against open fires or bringing in glass bottles). Large national and sub-national parks are typically overseen by a park ranger. Large parks may have areas for canoeing and hiking in the warmer months and, in some northern hemisphere countries, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing in colder months. There are also amusement parks that have live shows, fairground rides, refreshments, and games of chance or skill.

==History==

English deer parks were used by the aristocracy in medieval times for game hunting. They had walls or thick hedges around them to keep game animals (e.g., stags) in and people out. It was strictly forbidden for commoners to hunt animals in these deer parks.

These game preserves evolved into landscaped parks set around mansions and country houses from the sixteenth century onwards. These may have served as hunting grounds but they also proclaimed the owner&#x27;s wealth and status. An aesthetic of landscape design began in these stately home parks where the natural landscape was enhanced by landscape architects such as Capability Brown and Humphry Repton. The French formal garden such as designed by André Le Nôtre at Versailles is an earlier and elaborate example. As cities became crowded, private hunting grounds became places for the public.

Early opportunities for the creation of urban parks in both Europe and the United States grew out of medieval practice to secure pasture lands within the safe confines of villages and towns. The most famous US example of a city park that evolved from this practice is the Boston Common in Boston, Massachusetts (1634).

With the Industrial Revolution parks took on a new meaning as areas set aside to preserve a sense of nature in the cities and towns. Sporting activity came to be a major use for these urban parks. Areas of outstanding natural beauty were also set aside as national parks to prevent them from being spoiled by uncontrolled development.

==Design==
Park design is influenced by the intended purpose and audience, as well as by the available land features. A park intended to provide recreation for children may include a playground. A park primarily intended for adults may feature walking paths and decorative landscaping. Specific features, such as riding trails, may be included to support specific activities.

The design of a park may determine who is willing to use it. Walkers might feel unsafe on a mixed-use path that is dominated by fast-moving cyclists or horses. Different landscaping and infrastructure may even affect children&#x27;s rates of park usage according to gender. Redesigns of two parks in Vienna suggested that the creation of multiple semi-enclosed play areas in a park could encourage equal use by boys and girls.

Parks are part of the urban infrastructure: for physical activity, for families and communities to gather and socialize, or for a simple respite. Research reveals that people who exercise outdoors in green-space derive greater mental health benefits. Providing activities for all ages, abilities and income levels is important for the physical and mental well-being of the public.

Parks can also benefit pollinators, and some parks (such as Saltdean Oval in East Sussex) have been redesigned to accommodate them better. Some organizations, such as the Xerces Society are also promoting this idea.

===Role in city revitalization===
City parks play a role in improving cities and improving the futures for residents and visitors - for example, Millennium Park in Chicago, Illinois or the Mill River Park and Green way in Stamford, CT. One group that is a strong proponent of parks for cities is The American Society of Landscape Architects. They argue that parks are important to the fabric of the community on an individual scale and broader scales such as entire neighborhoods, city districts or city park systems.

===Design for safety===
Parks need to feel safe for people to use them. Research shows that perception of safety can be more significant in influencing human behavior than actual crime statistics. If citizens perceive a park as unsafe, they might not make use of it at all.

A study done in four cities; Albuquerque, NM, Chapel Hill/Durham, NC, Columbus, OH, and Philadelphia, PA, with 3815 survey participants who lived within a half-mile of a park indicated that in addition to safety park facilities also played a significant role in park use and that increasing facilities instead of creating an image of a safe park would increase use of the park.

There are a number of features that contribute to whether a park feels safe. Elements in the physical design of a park, such as an open and welcoming entry, good visibility (sight lines), and appropriate lighting and signage can all make a difference. Regular park maintenance, as well as programming and community involvement, can also contribute to a feeling of safety.

While Crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED) has been widely used in facility design, the use of CPTED in parks has not been. Iqbal and Ceccato performed a study in Stockholm, Sweden to determine if it would be useful to apply to parks. Their study indicated that while CPTED could be useful, due to the nature of a park, increasing the look of safety can also have unintended consequences on the aesthetics of the park. Creating secure areas with bars and locks lowers the beauty of the park, as well as the nature of who is in charge of observing the public space and the feeling of being observed.

==Active and passive recreation areas==

Parks can be divided into active and passive recreation areas. Active recreation is that which has an urban character and requires intensive development. It often involves cooperative or team activity, including playgrounds, ball fields, swimming pools, gymnasiums, and skateparks. Active recreation such as team sports, due to the need to provide substantial space to congregate, typically involves intensive management, maintenance, and high costs. Passive recreation, also called &quot;low-intensity recreation&quot; is that which emphasizes the open-space aspect of a park and allows for the preservation of natural habitat. It usually involves a low level of development, such as rustic picnic areas, benches, and trails.

Many smaller &quot;neighborhood parks&quot; are receiving increased attention and valuation as significant community assets and places of refuge in heavily populated urban areas. Neighborhood groups around the world are joining to support local parks that have suffered from urban decay and government neglect.

Passive recreation typically requires less management which can be provided at lower costs than active recreation. Some open space managers provide trails for physical activity in the form of walking, running, horse riding, mountain biking, snowshoeing, or cross-country skiing; or activities such as observing nature, bird watching, painting, photography, or picnicking. Limiting park or open space use to passive recreation over all or a portion of the park&#x27;s area eliminates or reduces the burden of managing active recreation facilities and developed infrastructure. Passive recreation amenities require routine upkeep and maintenance to prevent degradation of the environment.

== Conservation of biodiversity in parks ==
The general principle of how parks and greenspaces assist in the conservation of biodiversity is by creating natural environments for animals in urban areas. Biological diversity, or biodiversity, is the variety of life on Earth in all its forms. Fauna and flora are principal biotic components. They include all living species, which consist of plants, animals, and bacteria. Around half of the greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere get absorbed by the floral components of the biodiversity, providing nature-based aid in the fight against the climate change and habitat for the fauna. 

When processes such as the decay of wood, winter dieback or succession are allowed to happen the natural cycle helps with biodiversity conservation. The amount of habitat can be increased more vegetation to parks – wildflowers, long grass areas, shrubs, and trees. In parks located in urban areas the conservation of native vegetation is tied to preservation of insects and mammals in the area. Tall trees and bushes create shadow for bodies of water with fish. Having all the animals co-existing together in a regulated environment generates a natural cycle of life where decaying bodies assist in the fertilization of the ground. 

Alongside the preservation of native species parks with exotic fauna and flora drive diversity in natural ecosystems, aiding in the adaptation to urban environment. Richness of a park’s nature is associated with its age and size, with the older ones having a larder variety of breeds and greenery. Vegetation in parks can indirectly reduce air temperature and directly reduce levels of carbon dioxide by storing it as a biomass and due to the trees’ ability to absorb over 95% of ultraviolet radiation the aid in the reduction of skin cancer is a factor that is largely considered when new greenspaces are built. 

==Parks owned or operated by government==

===National parks===
A national park is a reserve of land, usually, but not always declared and owned by a national government, protected from most human development and pollution. Although this may be so, it is not likely that the government of a specific area owns it, rather the community itself. National parks are a protected area of International Union for Conservation of Nature Category II. This implies that they are wilderness areas, but unlike pure nature reserves, they are established with the expectation of a certain degree of human visitation and supporting infrastructure.

While this type of national park had been proposed previously, the United States established the first &quot;public park or pleasuring-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people&quot;, Yellowstone National Park, in 1872, although Yellowstone was not gazetted as a national park. The first officially designated national park was Mackinac Island, gazetted in 1875. Australia&#x27;s Royal National Park, established in 1879, was the world&#x27;s second officially established national park.

The largest national park in the world is the Northeast Greenland National Park, which was established in 1974 and currently protects .

===Sub-national parks===

In some Federal systems, many parks are managed by the sub-national levels of government. In Brazil, the United States, and some states in Mexico, as well as in the Australian state of Victoria, these are known as state parks, whereas in Argentina, Canada and South Korea, they are known as provincial or territorial parks. In the United States, it is also common for individual counties to run parks, these are known as county parks.

===Urban parks===
A park is an area of open space provided for recreational use, usually owned and maintained by a local government. Parks commonly resemble savannas or open woodlands, the types of landscape that human beings find most relaxing. Grass is typically kept short to discourage insect pests and to allow for the enjoyment of picnics and sporting activities. Trees are chosen for their beauty and to provide shade.

Some early parks include the la Alameda de Hércules, in Seville, a promenaded public mall, urban garden and park built in 1574, within the historic center of Seville; the City Park, in Budapest, Hungary, which was property of the Batthyány family and was later made public.

An early purpose built public park was Derby Arboretum which was opened in 1840 by Joseph Strutt for the mill workers and people of the city. This was closely followed by Princes Park in the Liverpool suburb of Toxteth, laid out to the designs of Joseph Paxton from 1842 and opened in 1843. The land on which the Princes park was built was purchased by Richard Vaughan Yates, an iron merchant and philanthropist, in 1841 for £50,000. The creation of Princes Park showed great foresight and introduced a number of highly influential ideas. First and foremost was the provision of open space for the benefit of townspeople and local residents within an area that was being rapidly built up. Secondly it took the concept of the designed landscape as a setting for the suburban domicile, an idea pioneered by John Nash at Regent&#x27;s Park, and re-fashioned it for the provincial town in a most original way. Nash&#x27;s remodeling of St James&#x27;s Park from 1827 and the sequence of processional routes he created to link The Mall with Regent&#x27;s Park completely transformed the appearance of London&#x27;s West End. With the establishment of Princes Park in 1842, Joseph Paxton did something similar for the benefit of a provincial town, albeit one of international stature by virtue of its flourishing mercantile contingent. Liverpool had a burgeoning presence on the scene of global maritime trade before 1800 and during the Victorian era its wealth rivaled that of London itself.

The form and layout of Paxton&#x27;s ornamental grounds, structured about an informal lake within the confines of a serpentine carriageway, put in place the essential elements of his much imitated design for Birkenhead Park. The latter was commenced in 1843 with the help of public finance and deployed the ideas he pioneered at Princes Park on a more expansive scale. Frederick Law Olmsted visited Birkenhead Park in 1850 and praised its qualities. Indeed, Paxton is widely credited as having been one of the principal influences on Olmsted and Calvert&#x27;s design for New York&#x27;s Central Park of 1857.

There are around an estimated 27,000 public parks in the United Kingdom, with around 2.6 billion visits to parks each year. Many are of cultural and historical interest, with 300 registered by Historic England as of national importance. Most public parks have been provided and run by local authorities over the past hundred and seventy years, but these authorities have no statutory duty to fund or maintain these public parks. In 2016 the Heritage Lottery Fund&#x27;s &quot;State of UK Public Parks&quot; reported that &quot;92 per cent of park managers report their maintenance budgets have reduced in the past three years and 95 per cent expect their funding will continue to reduce&quot;.

Another early public park is the Peel Park, Salford, England opened on August 22, 1846. Another possible claimant for status as the world&#x27;s first public park is Boston Common (Boston, Massachusetts, US), set aside in 1634, whose first recreational promenade, Tremont Mall, dates from 1728. True park status for the entire common seems to have emerged no later than 1830, when the grazing of cows was ended and renaming the Common as Washington Park was proposed (renaming the bordering Sentry Street to Park Street in 1808 already acknowledged the reality).

===Linear parks===
A linear park is a park that has a much greater length than width. A typical example of a linear park is a section of a former railway that has been converted into a park called a rail trail or greenway (i.e. the tracks removed, vegetation allowed to grow back). Parks are sometimes made out of oddly shaped areas of land, much like the vacant lots that often become city neighborhood parks. Linked parks may form a greenbelt.

===Country parks===

In some countries, especially the United Kingdom, &quot;country parks&quot; are areas designated for recreation, and managed by local authorities. They are often located near urban populations, but they provide recreational facilities typical of the countryside rather than the town.

===Military parks===
In 2021, following the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, a Military Trophy Park was opened in Azerbaijan&#x27;s capital Baku, showcasing seized military equipment, as well as the helmets and wax mannequins of Armenian troops. The helmets were reported by international media to belong to dead Armenian soldiers. Several international journalists have called the park &quot;barbaric&quot;. Armenia strongly condemned it, accusing Baku of &quot;dishonoring the memory of victims of the war, missing persons and prisoners of war and violating the rights and dignity of their families&quot;. Armenia&#x27;s ombudsman called it a &quot;clear manifestation of fascism&quot;, saying that it is a &quot;proof of Azerbaijani genocidal policy and state supported Armenophobia&quot;. Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan stated that such museums are a widely accepted international practice, and the country has a right to commemorate its victory through parades, parks, museums and other means. Azerbaijani authorities claimed that the helmets were left behind by retreating Armenian soldiers. When Azerbaijani historian Altay Goyushov, one of the leaders of liberal democratic opposition, criticized the helmets corridor, he was rebuffed by local journalists and bloggers who justified demonstrating the helmets, one of them going as far as inviting &quot;all who does not feel well looking at them to go and drown in Caspian sea&quot;.

==Private parks==

Private parks are owned by individuals or businesses and are used at the discretion of the owner. There are a few types of private parks, and some which once were privately maintained and used have now been made open to the public.

&quot;Hunting parks&quot; were originally areas maintained as open space where residences, industry and farming were not allowed, often originally so that nobility might have a place to hunt – see medieval deer park. These were known for instance, as &quot;deer parks&quot; (deer being originally a term meaning any wild animal). Many country houses in Great Britain and Ireland still have parks of this sort, which since the 18th century have often been landscaped for aesthetic effect. They are usually a mixture of open grassland with scattered trees and sections of woodland, and are often enclosed by a high wall. The area immediately around the house is the garden. In some cases this will also feature sweeping lawns and scattered trees; the basic difference between a &quot;country house&#x27;s park&quot; and its garden is that the park is grazed by animals, but they are excluded from the garden.

==Other park types==
* Amusement parks have live shows, fairground rides, refreshments, and games of chance/skill.
* Dog parks permit dogs to run off-leash. Parks have differing rules regarding whether dogs can be brought into a park: some parks prohibit dogs; some parks allow them with restrictions (e.g., use of a leash).
* Forest parks are large areas of attractive country with marked paths and special areas for camping.
* Nature park
* Parklet
* Pocket park
* Regional park

<text>Birchinlee is the site of &quot;Tin Town&quot;, a village built by the Derwent Valley Water Board for the workers (and their families) who constructed the Derwent and Howden Dams between 1902 and 1916. Most of the workers had previously been engaged in the construction, in Wales, of the Elan Valley Reservoirs where the accommodation was very basic. At Birchinlee, a &quot;model village&quot; was built; its infrastructure included hospitals, school, canteen (pub), post office, shops, recreation hall, public bath house, police station, railway station, rubbish dump with incinerator, and much else. One of the shops was a well-stocked store owned by the Gregory brothers from Tideswell. Accommodation consisted of workmen&#x27;s huts, foremen&#x27;s huts and married workmen&#x27;s huts. The latter were decorated to a high standard, as photographs from the period confirm. The population rose to 900 people.

Remnants of &quot;Tin Town&quot; can still be seen when walking to the west of Derwent Reservoir. The former railway track is now a footpath. One of the buildings was salvaged and rebuilt at Hope where in 2014 it was reported to be housing a beauty parlour.

A number of books and resources charting the history of Birchinlee and the dambuilders have been written by Professor Brian Robinson (whose mother was born and lived in Tintown) and Doctor Bill Beven, Peak District National Park archaeologist.

The Derwent Valley Museum, formerly located on the Derwent Reservoir dam and run privately by the late Vic Hallam, told the history of the Derwent valley and of Derwent, Ashopton and Birchinlee as well as the tale of RAF Squadron 617 and its training for Operation Chastise (the &quot;Dam Busters&quot; raids) during the Second World War.

Further up the valley is Beavers Croft, a 14th-century housestead that was occupied by the chief engineer of Howden Dam in the early part of the 20th century. It is currently owned by private business partners that let the house for self-catering holidays during the summer, and the barn was occupied by a part-time PDNPA ranger until late 2013.

<doc id="166466" wikidata="Q2014071" url="?curid=166466" title="River Douglas, Lancashire">
<text>The River Douglas, also known as the River Asland or Astland, flows through parts of Lancashire and Greater Manchester in North West England. It is a tributary of the River Ribble and has several tributaries, the major ones being the River Tawd and the River Yarrow.
In 1720, an act of Parliament, the  (6 Geo. 1. c. 28), authorized Thomas Steers and William Squire to make the River Douglas navigable to small ships between Wigan and its mouth. Despite financial irregularities, the Douglas Navigation was not completed until 1742. By 1783, it had been replaced by the Leeds and Liverpool Canal,
and the river reverted to its natural state. Although the remnants of several locks are still visible between Parbold and Gathurst.
The Rufford Branch of the canal joins the river at Tarleton.
The river rises on Winter Hill in the West Pennine Moors, and flows for through several towns before reaching the Ribble estuary near Tarleton, with the last being tidal. In 1892, the Douglas was diverted in Wigan to allow the construction of Wigan Central railway station.

==Etymology==
The &quot;Douglas&quot; is derived from the Brittonic elements &quot;dūβ-&quot;, meaning &quot;black&quot;, and &quot;*glẹ:ss&quot;, &quot;stream, rivulet, watercourse&quot; (Welsh &quot;du-glais&quot;). This etymology is shared by like-named rivers in The Old North, such as the Douglas Water in Scotland.

==Route==
The River Douglas rises at Douglas Springs, a series of springs on Rivington Moor close to the contour close to the summit of Winter Hill. The River Yarrow, one of its major tributaries, rises at springs less than a mile (1.6 km) to the north-west. Nearby are Anglezarke Reservoir, Upper Rivington Reservoir, and Lower Rivington Reservoir, which are part of the Rivington Chain, a network of reservoirs built to supply the drinking water needs of Liverpool. This reservoirs alter the natural drainage patterns of both rivers.

The Douglas descends rapidly, dropping below the contour before flowing into the Lower Rivington Reservoir, just north of Horwich. Below the dam, the river&#x27;s flow is maintained by compensation water released from the reservoir, marking the county boundary between Greater Manchester and Lancashire. The river is crossed by the M61 motorway near Rivington services, and then turns to the north-west to reach the southern edge of Adlington. It flows in a generally southwesterly direction and is crossed by the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, via a grade II listed aqueduct designed by John Rennie in the 1790s. The aqueduct has a round arch and is constructed of rock-faced stone. The river then bypasses Worthington Lakes, three reservoirs built in the 1860s to provide drinking water for Wigan, and now managed as a country park by United Utilities. The river ceases to form the county boundary just before the lakes and re-emerges from a tunnel below the reservoir dam, passing east of Standish. It continues southwards to Wigan, where it flows through a long culvert under the railway near Wigan North Western station, is crossed again by the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, and heads northwest, closely paralleling the canal.
It is crossed by the M6 motorway and the Manchester-Southport line near Gathurst station, passes by the village of Appley Bridge, and at Parbold the canal crosses for the third time, as the river turns to the north and north-west. The aqueduct was designed by John Longbotham, has a semi-elliptical arch, and dates from 1791 to 1792. The river drops below the contour at Parbold, and continues across open countryside where it is joined by the River Tawd, flowing north from Skelmersdale, becoming tidal before it reaches the village of Rufford. White Bridge at Rufford is a grade II listed structure with three spans, constructed of squared sandstone. It carries the B5246 Station Road over the river, and dates from the time of the construction of the Douglas Navigation, between 1720 and 1742. Below the bridge, the channel is rather straighter. Until 1805, the river was joined by the Rufford Branch of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at Sollom Lock, but the lock was abandoned and a new one built further downstream at Tarleton. In order to do this, a new channel was created for the river further to the east, and the original channel was reused by the canal. On the new section, Great Hanging Bridge is similar to White bridge, both in date and in its three arches, and it carries the A581 road. Below it, the river is joined by the River Yarrow, which has taken a more direct route from its source to this point. At Tarleton, another three-span bridge carries the A59 road over the river. It is built from rock-faced sandstone blocks, and the keystone on the southern side indicates it was constructed in 1821. The north side is of red sandstone, with indications that it might once have been part of a narrower bridge. After its junction with the canal at Tarleton Lock, the final of the river to its junction with the River Ribble, here also known as the River Asland, is used by boat traffic transferring from the Leeds and Liverpool Canal to the Lancaster Canal since the opening of the Ribble Link in 2002.

==Hydrology==
The reservoirs of the Rivington Chain capture and store run-off from Winter Hill and Rivington Moor, much of which is used to provide a public water supply to areas of Lancashire and Greater Manchester. However, as a result of the original statutes that allowed them to be built, the water company is required to maintain some flow in the river below the reservoirs, and this compensation flow provides a fairly steady baseline flow in the river throughout the year. It is only normally exceeded if the reservoirs become full. On the upper reaches of the Douglas, the river bed is relatively steep, and consequently the river level can change quickly as a result of rainfall. As the river progresses to the west, the gradient lessens, and level changes occur more slowly.

There are two locations on the river where water is abstracted to maintain levels in the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. On many sections of the river, flows are augmented by the discharge from sewage treatment works. Major treatment works are located at Horwich on the upper river, at Wigan Wastewater Treatment works in Lathom on the lower section, and at Skelmersdale on the River Tawd. Upgrades to the Wigan and Skelmersdale Treatment Works have been carried out, to improve the quality of the final effluent before discharge into the river system, while in Wigan, the sewage system has been improved, to reduce the amount of raw sewage discharged into the river by combined sewer overflows. In Standish, the pumping station at Chorley Road has been upgraded to reduce its impact on the river, while in Horwich, there was an ongoing scheme in 2014 in which volunteers walked the river to identify pollution points, which were then followed up by officers from the Environment Agency. Run-off of nutrients and other pollutants from agricultural land has also been addressed through the Catchment Sensitive Farming project, run jointly by Natural England, the Environment Agency and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Another joint initiative between the Environment Agency and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has seen sea defences improved and of saltmarsh created as part of the Hesketh Outmarsh Coastal Realignment project.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measure the water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish, and chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations. Chemical status is rated good or fail.

The water quality of the River Douglas system was as follows in 2016. The section marked Ribble covers the tidal River Ribble and the lower of tidal River Douglas. Reasons for the quality being less than good include sewage discharge for most of the river, together with physical modification of the channel and poor nutrient management of agricultural land on the lower sections.
