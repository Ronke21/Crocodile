<text>In Greek mythology, Orion (; Ancient Greek: Ὠρίων or ; Latin: &quot;Orion&quot;) was a giant huntsman whom Zeus (or perhaps Artemis) placed among the stars as the constellation of Orion.

Ancient sources told several different stories about Orion; there are two major versions of his birth and several versions of his death. The most important recorded episodes are his birth in Boeotia, his visit to Chios where he met Merope and raped her, being blinded by Merope&#x27;s father, the recovery of his sight at Lemnos, his hunting with Artemis on Crete, his death by the bow of Artemis or the sting of the giant scorpion which became Scorpius, and his elevation to the heavens. Most ancient sources omit some of these episodes and several tell only one. These various incidents may originally have been independent, unrelated stories, and it is impossible to tell whether the omissions are simple brevity or represent a real disagreement.

In Greek literature he first appears as a great hunter in Homer&#x27;s epic the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, where Odysseus sees his shade in the underworld. The bare bones of Orion&#x27;s story are told by the Hellenistic and Roman collectors of myths, but there is no extant literary version of his adventures comparable, for example, to that of Jason in Apollonius of Rhodes&#x27; &quot;Argonautica&quot; or Euripides&#x27; &quot;Medea&quot;; the entry in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Fasti&quot; for May 11 is a poem on the birth of Orion, but that is one version of a single story. The surviving fragments of legend have provided a fertile field for speculation about Greek prehistory and myth.

Orion served several roles in ancient Greek culture. The story of the adventures of Orion, the hunter, is the one for which there is the most evidence (and even for that, not very much); he is also the personification of the constellation of the same name; he was venerated as a hero, in the Greek sense, in the region of Boeotia; and there is one etiological passage which says that Orion was responsible for the present shape of the Strait of Sicily.

==Legends==

===Homer and Hesiod===
Orion is mentioned in the oldest surviving works of Greek literature, which would probably date back to the 7th or 8th century BC, but which are the products of an oral tradition with origins several centuries earlier. In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; Orion is described as a constellation, and the star Sirius is mentioned as his dog. In the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Orion is essentially the pinnacle of human excellence in hunting: Odysseus sees him hunting in the underworld with a bronze club, a great slayer of animals. In some legends Orion claims to be able to hunt any animal in existence. He is also mentioned as a constellation, as the lover of the Goddess Dawn, as slain by Artemis, and as the most handsome of the earthborn. In the &quot;Works and Days&quot; of Hesiod, Orion is also a constellation, one whose rising and setting with the sun is used to reckon the year.

The legend of Orion was probably told in the &quot;Astronomia,&quot; a lost work attributed to Hesiod. This version is known through a summary of Eratosthenes&#x27;s lost work the &quot;Catasterismi&quot;, on the constellations. According to this summary, Orion was the son of the sea-god Poseidon and Euryale, a daughter of Minos, King of Crete. Orion could walk on the waves because of his father; he walked to the island of Chios where he got drunk and raped Merope, daughter of Oenopion, the ruler there. In vengeance, Oenopion blinded Orion and drove him away. Orion stumbled to Lemnos where Hephaestus—the smith-god—had his forge. Hephaestus told his servant, Cedalion, to guide Orion to the uttermost East where Helios, the Sun, healed him; Orion carried Cedalion around on his shoulders. Orion returned to Chios to punish Oenopion, but the king hid away underground and escaped Orion&#x27;s wrath. Orion&#x27;s next journey took him to Crete where he hunted with the goddess Artemis and her mother Leto, and in the course of the hunt, threatened to kill every beast on Earth. Gaia (Apollo in some versions, disapproving of his sister&#x27;s relationship with a male) objected and sent a giant scorpion to kill Orion. The creature succeeded, and after his death, the goddesses asked Zeus to place Orion among the constellations. Zeus consented and, as a memorial to Orion&#x27;s death, added the Scorpion to the heavens as well.

===Other sources===
Although Orion has a few lines in both Homeric poems and in the &quot;Works and Days&quot;, most of the stories about him are recorded in incidental allusions and in fairly obscure later writings. No great poet standardized the legend. The ancient sources for Orion&#x27;s legend are mostly notes in the margins of ancient poets (scholia) or compilations by later scholars, the equivalent of modern reference works or encyclopedias; even the legend from the Hesiodic &quot;Astronomia&quot; survives only in one such compilation.

The margin of the Empress Eudocia&#x27;s copy of the &quot;Iliad&quot; has a note summarizing a Hellenistic poet who tells a different story of Orion&#x27;s birth. Here the gods Zeus, Hermes, and Poseidon come to visit Hyrieus of Tanagra, who roasts a whole bull for them. When they offer him a favor, he asks for the birth of sons. The gods take the bull&#x27;s hide and urinate into it and bury it in the earth, then tell him to dig it up ten months later. When he does, he finds Orion; this explains why Orion is earthborn.

A second full telling (even shorter than the summary of the &quot;Astronomia&quot;) is in a Roman-era collection of myths; the account of Orion is based largely on the mythologist and poet Pherecydes of Athens. Here Orion is described as earthborn and enormous in stature. This version also mentions Poseidon and Euryale as his parents. It adds a first marriage to Side before his marriage to Merope. All that is known about Side is that Hera threw her into Hades for rivalling her in beauty. It also gives a different version of Orion&#x27;s death than the &quot;Iliad&quot;: Eos, the Dawn, fell in love with Orion and took him to Delos where Artemis killed him.

Another narrative on the constellations, three paragraphs long, is from a Latin writer whose brief notes have come down to us under the name of Hyginus. It begins with the oxhide story of Orion&#x27;s birth, which this source ascribes to Callimachus and Aristomachus, and sets the location at Thebes or Chios. Hyginus has two versions. In one of them he omits Poseidon; a modern critic suggests this is the original version.

The same source tells two stories of the death of Orion. The first says that because of his &quot;living joined in too great a friendship&quot; with Oenopion, he boasted to Artemis and Leto that he could kill anything which came from Earth. Gaia (the personification of Earth in Greek mythology) objected and created the Scorpion. In the second story, Apollo, being jealous of Orion&#x27;s love for Artemis, arranged for Artemis to kill him. Seeing Orion swimming in the ocean, a long way off, he remarked that Artemis could not possibly hit that black thing in the water. Feeling challenged, she sent an arrow right through it and killed Orion; when his body washed up on shore, she wept copiously, and decided to place Orion among the stars. He connects Orion with several constellations, not just Scorpius. Orion chased Pleione, the mother of the Pleiades, for seven years, until Zeus intervened and raised all of them to the stars. In &quot;Works and Days&quot;, Orion chases the Pleiades themselves. Canis Minor and Canis Major are his dogs, the one in front is called Procyon. They chase Lepus, the hare, although Hyginus says some critics thought this too base a prey for the noble Orion and have him pursuing Taurus, the bull, instead. A Renaissance mythographer adds other names for Orion&#x27;s dogs: Leucomelaena, Maera, Dromis, Cisseta, Lampuris, Lycoctonus, Ptoophagus, Arctophonus.

===Variants===
There are numerous variants in other authors. Most of these are incidental references in poems and scholiasts. The Roman poet Virgil shows Orion as a giant wading through the Aegean Sea with the waves breaking against his shoulders; rather than, as the mythographers have it, walking on the water. There are several references to Hyrieus as the father of Orion that connect him to various places in Boeotia, including Hyria; this may well be the original story (although not the first attested), since Hyrieus is presumably the eponym of Hyria. He is also called Oeneus, although he is not the Calydonian Oeneus. Other ancient scholia say, as Hesiod does, that Orion was the son of Poseidon and his mother was a daughter of Minos; but they call the daughter Brylle or Hyeles. There are two versions where Artemis killed Orion, either with her arrows or by producing the Scorpion. In the second variant, Orion died of the Scorpion&#x27;s sting as he does in Hesiod. Although Orion does not defeat the Scorpion in any version, several variants have it die from its wounds. Artemis is given various motives. One is that Orion boasted of his beast-killing and challenged her to a contest with the discus. Another is that he assaulted either Artemis herself or Upis/Opis, a Hyperborean maiden in her band of huntresses. Aratus&#x27;s brief description, in his &quot;Astronomy&quot;, conflates the elements of the myth: according to Aratus, Orion attacks Artemis while hunting on &quot;Chios&quot;, and the Scorpion kills him there. Nicander, in his &quot;Theriaca&quot;, has the scorpion of ordinary size and hiding under a small (&quot;oligos&quot;) stone. Most versions of the story that continue after Orion&#x27;s death tell of the gods raising Orion and the Scorpion to the stars, but even here a variant exists: Ancient poets differed greatly on whom Aesculapius brought back from the dead; the Argive epic poet Telesarchus is quoted as saying in a scholion that Aesculapius resurrected Orion. Other ancient authorities are quoted anonymously that Aesculapius healed Orion after he was blinded by Oenopion.

The story of Orion and Oenopion also varies. One source refers to Merope as Oenopion&#x27;s wife, not his daughter. Another refers to Merope as the daughter of Minos and not of Oenopion. The longest version (a page in the Loeb) is from a collection of melodramatic plots drawn up by an Alexandrian poet for the Roman Cornelius Gallus to make into Latin verse. It describes Orion as slaying the wild beasts of Chios and looting the other inhabitants to make a bride-price for Oenopion&#x27;s daughter, who is called Aëro or Leiro. Oenopion does not want to marry her to someone like Orion, and eventually Orion, in frustration, breaks into her bedchamber and rapes her. The text implies that Oenopion blinds him on the spot.

 Lucian includes a picture with Orion in a rhetorical description of an ideal building, in which Orion is walking into the rising sun with Lemnos nearby, Cedalion on his shoulder. He recovers his sight there with Hephaestus still watching in the background.

Latin sources add that Oenopion was the son of Dionysus. Dionysus sent satyrs to put Orion into a deep sleep so he could be blinded. One source tells the same story but converts Oenopion into Minos of Crete. It adds that an oracle told Orion that his sight could be restored by walking eastward and that he found his way by hearing the Cyclops&#x27; hammer, placing a Cyclops as a guide on his shoulder; it does not mention Cabeiri or Lemnos—this is presumably the story of Cedalion recast. Both Hephaestus and the Cyclopes were said to make thunderbolts; they are combined in other sources. One scholion, on a Latin poem, explains that Hephaestus gave Orion a horse.

Giovanni Boccaccio cites a lost Latin writer for the story that Orion and Candiope were son and daughter of Oenopion, king of Sicily. While the virgin huntsman Orion was sleeping in a cave, Venus seduced him; as he left the cave, he saw his sister shining as she crossed in front of it. He ravished her; when his father heard of this, he banished Orion. Orion consulted an oracle, which told him that if he went east, he would regain the glory of kingship. Orion, Candiope, and their son Hippologus sailed to Thrace, &quot;a province eastward from Sicily&quot;. There he conquered the inhabitants, and became known as the son of Neptune. His son begat the Dryas mentioned in Statius.

==Cult and popular appreciation==
In Ancient Greece, Orion had a hero cult in the region of Boeotia. The number of places associated with his birth suggest that it was widespread. Hyria, the most frequently mentioned, was in the territory of Tanagra. A feast of Orion was held at Tanagra as late as the Roman Empire. They had a tomb of Orion most likely at the foot of Mount Cerycius (now Mount Tanagra). Maurice Bowra argues that Orion was a national hero of the Boeotians, much as Castor and Pollux were for the Dorians. He bases this claim on the Athenian epigram on the Battle of Coronea in which a hero gave the Boeotian army an oracle, then fought on their side and defeated the Athenians.

The Boeotian school of epic poetry was chiefly concerned with the genealogies of the gods and heroes; later writers elaborated this web. Several other myths are attached to Orion in this way: A papyrus fragment of the Boeotian poet Corinna gives Orion fifty sons (a traditional number). This included the oracular hero Acraephen, who, she sings, gave a response to Asopus regarding Asopus&#x27; daughters who were abducted by the gods. Corinna sang of Orion conquering and naming all the land of the dawn. Bowra argues that Orion was believed to have delivered oracles as well, probably at a different shrine. Hyginus says that Hylas&#x27;s mother was Menodice, daughter of Orion. Another mythographer, Liberalis, tells of Menippe and Metioche, daughters of Orion, who sacrificed themselves for their country&#x27;s good and were transformed into comets.
Orion also has etiological connection to the city of Messina in Sicily. Diodorus of Sicily wrote a history of the world up to his own time (the beginning of the reign of Augustus). He starts with the gods and the heroes. At the end of this part of the work, he tells the story of Orion and two wonder-stories of his mighty earth-works in Sicily. One tells how he aided Zanclus, the founder of Zancle (the former name for Messina), by building the promontory which forms the harbor. The other, which Diodorus ascribes to Hesiod, relates that there was once a broad sea between Sicily and the mainland. Orion built the whole Peloris, the Punta del Faro, and the temple to Poseidon at the tip, after which he settled in Euboea. He was then &quot;numbered among the stars of heaven and thus won for himself immortal remembrance&quot;. The Renaissance historian and mathematician Francesco Maurolico, who came from Messina, identified the remains of a temple of Orion near the present Messina Cathedral. Maurolico also designed an ornate fountain, built by the sculptor Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli in 1547, in which Orion is a central figure, symbolizing the Emperor Charles V, also a master of the sea and restorer of Messina; Orion is still a popular symbol of the city.

Images of Orion in classical art are difficult to recognize, and clear examples are rare. There are several ancient Greek images of club-carrying hunters that could represent Orion, but such generic examples could equally represent an archetypal &quot;hunter&quot;, or indeed Heracles. Some claims have been made that other Greek art represents specific aspects of the Orion myth. A tradition of this type has been discerned in 5th century BC Greek pottery—John Beazley identified a scene of Apollo, Delian palm in hand, revenging Orion for the attempted rape of Artemis, while another scholar has identified a scene of Orion attacking Artemis as she is revenged by a snake (a counterpart to the scorpion) in a funerary group—supposedly symbolizing the hope that even the criminal Orion could be made immortal, as well as an astronomical scene in which Cephalus is thought to stand in for Orion and his constellation, also reflecting this system of iconography. Also, a tomb frieze in Taranto () may show Orion attacking Opis. But the earliest surviving clear depiction of Orion in classical art is Roman, from the depictions of the Underworld scenes of the Odyssey discovered at the Esquiline Hill (50–40 BC). Orion is also seen on a 4th-century bas-relief, currently affixed to a wall in the Porto neighborhood of Naples. The constellation Orion rises in November, the end of the sailing season, and was associated with stormy weather, and this characterization extended to the mythical Orion—the bas-relief may be associated with the sailors of the city.

==Interpretations==

===Renaissance===

Mythographers have discussed Orion at least since the Renaissance of classical learning; the Renaissance interpretations were allegorical. In the 14th century, Boccaccio interpreted the oxhide story as representing human conception; the hide is the womb, Neptune the moisture of semen, Jupiter its heat, and Mercury the female coldness; he also explained Orion&#x27;s death at the hands of the moon-goddess as the Moon producing winter storms. The 16th-century Italian mythographer Natalis Comes interpreted the whole story of Orion as an allegory of the evolution of a storm cloud: Begotten by air (Zeus), water (Poseidon), and the sun (Apollo), a storm cloud is diffused (Chios, which Comes derives from χέω, &quot;pour out&quot;), rises though the upper air (Aërope, as Comes spells Merope), chills (is blinded), and is turned into rain by the moon (Artemis). He also explains how Orion walked on the sea: &quot;Since the subtler part of the water which is rarefied rests on the surface, it is said that Orion learned from his father how to walk on water.&quot; Similarly, Orion&#x27;s conception made him a symbol of the philosophical child, an allegory of philosophy springing from multiple sources, in the Renaissance as in alchemical works, with some variations. The 16th-century German alchemist Michael Maier lists the fathers as Apollo, Vulcan and Mercury, and the 18th-century French alchemist Antoine-Joseph Pernety gave them as Jupiter, Neptune and Mercury.

===Modern===
Modern mythographers have seen the story of Orion as a way to access local folk tales and cultic practices directly without the interference of ancient high culture; several of them have explained Orion, each through his own interpretation of Greek prehistory and of how Greek mythology represents it. There are some points of general agreement between them: for example, that the attack on Opis is an attack on Artemis, for Opis is one of the names of Artemis.

There was a movement in the late nineteenth century to interpret all the Boeotian heroes as merely personifications of the constellations; there has since come to be wide agreement that the myth of Orion existed before there was a constellation named for him. Homer, for example, mentions Orion, the Hunter, and Orion, the constellation, but never confuses the two. Once Orion was recognized as a constellation, astronomy in turn affected the myth. The story of Side may well be a piece of astronomical mythology. The Greek word &quot;side&quot; means pomegranate, which bears fruit while Orion, the constellation, can be seen in the night sky. Rose suggests she is connected with Sidae in Boeotia, and that the pomegranate, as a sign of the Underworld, is connected with her descent there.

The 19th-century German classical scholar Erwin Rohde viewed Orion as an example of the Greeks erasing the line between the gods and mankind. That is, if Orion was in the heavens, other mortals could hope to be also.

The Hungarian mythographer Karl Kerényi, one of the founders of the modern study of Greek mythology, wrote about Orion in &quot;Gods of the Greeks&quot; (1951). Kerényi portrays Orion as a giant of Titanic vigor and criminality, born outside his mother as were Tityos or Dionysus. Kerényi places great stress on the variant in which Merope is the wife of Oenopion. He sees this as the remnant of a lost form of the myth in which Merope was Orion&#x27;s mother (converted by later generations to his stepmother and then to the present forms). Orion&#x27;s blinding is therefore parallel to that of Aegypius and Oedipus.

In &quot;Dionysus&quot; (1976), Kerényi portrays Orion as a shamanic hunting hero, surviving from Minoan times (hence his association with Crete). Kerényi derives Hyrieus (and Hyria) from the Cretan dialect word , meaning &quot;beehive&quot;, which survives only in ancient dictionaries. From this association he turns Orion into a representative of the old mead-drinking cultures, overcome by the wine masters Oenopion and Oeneus. (The Greek for &quot;wine&quot; is &quot;oinos&quot;.) Fontenrose cites a source stating that Oenopion taught the Chians how to make wine before anybody else knew how.

Joseph Fontenrose wrote &quot;Orion: the Myth of the Hunter and the Huntress&quot; (1981) to show Orion as the type specimen of a variety of grotesque hero. Fontenrose views him as similar to Cúchulainn, that is, stronger, larger, and more potent than ordinary men and the violent lover of the Divine Huntress; other heroes of the same type are Actaeon, Leucippus (son of Oenomaus), Cephalus, Teiresias, and Zeus as the lover of Callisto. Fontenrose also sees Eastern parallels in the figures of Aqhat, Attis, Dumuzi, Gilgamesh, Dushyanta, and Prajapati (as pursuer of Ushas).

In &quot;The Greek Myths&quot; (1955), Robert Graves views Oenopion as his perennial Year-King, at the stage where the king pretends to die at the end of his term and appoints a substitute, in this case Orion, who actually dies in his place. His blindness is iconotropy from a picture of Odysseus blinding the Cyclops, mixed with a purely Hellenic solar legend: the Sun-hero is captured and blinded by his enemies at dusk, but escapes and regains his sight at dawn, when all beasts flee him. Graves sees the rest of the myth as a syncretism of diverse stories. These include Gilgamesh and the Scorpion-Men, Set becoming a scorpion to kill Horus and the story of Aqhat and Yatpan from Ras Shamra, as well as a conjectural story of how the priestesses of Artemis Opis killed a visitor to their island of Ortygia. He compares Orion&#x27;s birth from the bull&#x27;s hide to a West African rainmaking charm and claims that the son of Poseidon should be a rainmaker.

==Cultural references==
The ancient Greek and Roman sources which tell more about Orion than his being a gigantic huntsman are mostly both dry and obscure, but poets do write of him: The brief passages in Aratus and Virgil are mentioned above. Pindar celebrates the pancratist Melissus of Thebes &quot;who was not granted the build of an Orion&quot;, but whose strength was still great.

Cicero translated Aratus in his youth; he made the Orion episode half again longer than it was in the Greek, adding the traditional Latin topos of madness to Aratus&#x27;s text. Cicero&#x27;s &quot;Aratea&quot; is one of the oldest Latin poems to come down to us as more than isolated lines; this episode may have established the technique of including epyllia in non-epic poems.

Orion is used by Horace, who tells of his death at the hands of Diana/Artemis, and by Ovid, in his Fasti for May 11, the middle day of the Lemuria, when (in Ovid&#x27;s time) the constellation Orion set with the sun. Ovid&#x27;s episode tells the story of Hyrieus and two gods, Jupiter and Neptune, although Ovid is bashful about the climax; Ovid makes Hyrieus a poor man, which means the sacrifice of an entire ox is more generous. There is also a single mention of Orion in his &quot;Art of Love&quot;, as a sufferer from unrequited love: &quot;Pale Orion wandered in the forest for Side.&quot;

Statius mentions Orion four times in his &quot;Thebaïd&quot;; twice as the constellation, a personification of storm, but twice as the ancestor of Dryas of Tanagra, one of the defenders of Thebes. The very late Greek epic poet Nonnus mentions the oxhide story in brief, while listing the Hyrians in his Catalogue of the Boeotian army of Dionysius.

References since antiquity are fairly rare. At the beginning of the 17th century, French sculptor Barthélemy Prieur cast a bronze statue &quot;Orion et Cédalion&quot;, some time between 1600 and 1611. This featured Orion with Cedalion on his shoulder, in a depiction of the ancient legend of Orion recovering his sight; the sculpture is now displayed at the Louvre.

Nicolas Poussin painted &quot;Paysage avec Orion aveugle cherchant le soleil&quot; (1658) (&quot;Landscape with blind Orion seeking the sun&quot;), after learning of the description by the 2nd-century Greek author Lucian, of a picture of Orion recovering his sight; Poussin included a storm-cloud, which both suggests the transient nature of Orion&#x27;s blindness, soon to be removed like a cloud exposing the sun, and includes Natalis Comes&#x27; esoteric interpretation of Orion &quot;as&quot; a storm-cloud. Poussin need not have consulted Lucian directly; the passage is in the notes of the illustrated French translation of Philostratus&#x27; &quot;Imagines&quot; which Poussin is known to have consulted. The Austrian Daniel Seiter (active in Turin, Italy), painted &quot;Diane auprès du cadavre d&#x27;Orion&quot; (c. 1685) (&quot;Diana next to Orion&#x27;s corpse&quot;), pictured above.

In Endymion (1818), John Keats includes the line &quot;Or blind Orion hungry for the morn&quot;, thought to be inspired by Poussin. William Hazlitt may have introduced Keats to the painting—he later wrote the essay &quot;On Landscape of Nicholas Poussin&quot;, published in &quot;Table Talk, Essays on Men and Manners&quot; (1821–2). Richard Henry Horne, writing in the generation after Keats and Hazlitt, penned the three volume epic poem &quot;Orion&quot; in 1843. It went into at least ten editions and was reprinted by the Scholartis Press in 1928.

Science fiction author Ben Bova re-invented Orion as a time-traveling servant of various gods in a series of five novels. In &quot;The Blood of Olympus&quot;, the final volume of a series, Rick Riordan depicts Orion as one of the giant sons of the earth goddess Gaea.

Italian composer Francesco Cavalli wrote the opera, &quot;L&#x27;Orione&quot; in 1653. The story is set on the Greek island of Delos and focuses on Diana&#x27;s love for Orion as well as on her rival, Aurora. Diana shoots Orion only after being tricked by Apollo into thinking him a sea monster—she then laments his death and searches for Orion in the underworld until he is elevated to the heavens. French composer Louis de La Coste composed in 1728 the tragédie lyrique &quot;Orion&quot;. This time, it is Diana who is in love with Orion and is rejected by him. Johann Christian Bach (&#x27;the English Bach&#x27;) wrote an opera, &quot;Orion, or Diana Reveng&#x27;d&quot;, first presented at London&#x27;s Haymarket Theatre in 1763. Orion, sung by a castrato, is in love with Candiope, the daughter of Oenopion, King of Arcadia but his arrogance has offended Diana. Diana&#x27;s oracle forbids him to marry Candiope and foretells his glory and death. He bids a touching farewell to Candiope and marches off to his destiny. Diana allows him his victory and then kills him, offstage, with her arrow. In another aria, his mother Retrea (Queen of Thebes), laments his death but ultimately sees his elevation to the heavens. The 2002 opera &quot;Galileo Galilei&quot; by American composer Philip Glass includes an opera within an opera piece between Orion and Merope. The sunlight, which heals Orion&#x27;s blindness, is an allegory of modern science. Philip Glass has also written a shorter work on Orion, as have Tōru Takemitsu, Kaija Saariaho, and John Casken. David Bedford&#x27;s late-twentieth-century works are about the constellation rather than the mythical figure; he is an amateur astronomer.

The twentieth-century French poet René Char found the blind, lustful huntsman, both pursuer and pursued, a central symbol, as James Lawler has explained at some length in his 1978 work &quot;René Char: the Myth and the Poem.&quot; French novelist Claude Simon likewise found Orion an apt symbol, in this case of the writer, as he explained in his &quot;Orion aveugle&quot; of 1970. Marion Perret argues that Orion is a silent link in T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot; (1922), connecting the lustful Actaeon/Sweeney to the blind Teiresias and, through Sirius, to the Dog &quot;that&#x27;s friend to men&quot;.

<text>An anthology film (also known as an omnibus film, package film, or portmanteau film) is a single film consisting of several shorter films, each complete in itself and distinguished from the other, though frequently tied together by a single theme, premise, or author. Sometimes each one is directed by a different director or written by a different author, or may even have been made at different times or in different countries. Anthology films are distinguished from &quot;revue films&quot; such as &quot;Paramount on Parade&quot; (1930)—which were common in Hollywood in the early decades of sound film, composite films, and compilation films.

Anthology films are often mistaken with hyperlink cinema. Hyperlink cinema shows parts of many stories throughout a film, whereas anthology films show story segments of one at a time. Some mistaken examples include &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994) and &quot;Amores Perros&quot; (2000), distributing their storylines non-chronologically, separated by segments.

<text>An information society is a society or subculture where the usage, creation, distribution, manipulation and integration of information is a significant activity. Its main drivers are information and communication technologies, which have resulted in rapid growth of a variety of forms of information. Proponents of this theory posit that these technologies are impacting most important forms of social organization, including education, economy, health, government, warfare, and levels of democracy. The people who are able to partake in this form of society are sometimes called either computer users or even digital citizens, defined by K. Mossberger as “Those who use the Internet regularly and effectively”. This is one of many dozen internet terms that have been identified to suggest that humans are entering a new and different phase of society.

Some of the markers of this steady change may be technological, economic, occupational, spatial, cultural, or a combination of all of these.
Information society is seen as a successor to industrial society. Closely related concepts are the post-industrial society (post-fordism), post-modern society, computer society and knowledge society, telematic society, society of the spectacle (postmodernism), Information Revolution and Information Age, network society (Manuel Castells) or even liquid modernity.

==Definition==
There is currently no universally accepted concept of what exactly can be defined as an information society and what shall not be included in the term. Most theoreticians agree that a transformation can be seen as started somewhere between the 1970s, the early 1990s transformations of the Socialist East and the 2000s period that formed most of today&#x27;s net principles and currently as is changing the way societies work fundamentally. Information technology goes beyond the internet, as the principles of internet design and usage influence other areas, and there are discussions about how big the influence of specific media or specific modes of production really is. Frank Webster notes five major types of information that can be used to define information society: technological, economic, occupational, spatial and cultural. According to Webster, the character of information has transformed the way that we live today. How we conduct ourselves centers around theoretical knowledge and information.

Kasiwulaya and Gomo (Makerere University) allude that information societies are those that have intensified their use of IT for economic, social, cultural and political transformation. In 2005, governments reaffirmed their dedication to the foundations of the Information
Society in the Tunis Commitment and outlined the basis for implementation and follow-up in the Tunis Agenda for the Information Society. In particular, the Tunis Agenda addresses the issues of financing of ICTs for development and Internet governance that could not be resolved in the first phase.

Some people, such as Antonio Negri, characterize the information society as one in which people do immaterial labour. By this, they appear to refer to the production of knowledge or cultural artifacts. One problem with this model is that it ignores the material and essentially industrial basis of the society. However it does point to a problem for workers, namely how many creative people does this society need to function? For example, it may be that you only need a few star performers, rather than a plethora of non-celebrities, as the work of those performers can be easily distributed, forcing all secondary players to the bottom of the market. It &quot;is&quot; now common for publishers to promote only their best selling authors and to try to avoid the rest—even if they still sell steadily. Films are becoming more and more judged, in terms of distribution, by their first weekend&#x27;s performance, in many cases cutting out opportunity for word-of-mouth development.

Michael Buckland characterizes information in society in his book &quot;Information and Society.&quot; Buckland expresses the idea that information can be interpreted differently from person to person based on that individual&#x27;s experiences.

Considering that metaphors and technologies of information move forward in a reciprocal relationship, we can describe some societies (especially the Japanese society) as an information society because we think of it as such.
The word information may be interpreted in many different ways. According to Buckland in &quot;Information and Society&quot;, most of the meanings fall into three categories of human knowledge: information as knowledge, information as a process, and information as a thing.

Thus, the Information Society refers to the social importance given to communication and information in today&#x27;s society, where social, economic and cultural relations are involved.

In the Information Society, the process of capturing, processing and communicating information is the main element that characterizes it. Thus, in this type of society, the vast majority of it will be dedicated to the provision of services and said services will consist of the processing, distribution or use of information.

== The growth of computer information in society ==

The growth of the amount of technologically mediated information has been quantified in different ways, including society&#x27;s technological capacity to store information, to communicate information, and to compute information. It is estimated that, the world&#x27;s technological capacity to store information grew from 2.6 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 1986, which is the informational equivalent to less than one 730-MB CD-ROM per person in 1986 (539 MB per person), to 295 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2007. This is the informational equivalent of 60 CD-ROM per person in 2007 and represents a sustained annual growth rate of some 25%. The world&#x27;s combined technological capacity to receive information through one-way broadcast networks was the informational equivalent of 174 newspapers per person per day in 2007.

The world&#x27;s combined effective capacity to exchange information through two-way telecommunications networks was 281 petabytes of (optimally compressed) information in 1986, 471 petabytes in 1993, 2.2 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2000, and 65 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2007, which is the informational equivalent of 6 newspapers per person per day in 2007. The world&#x27;s technological capacity to compute information with humanly guided general-purpose computers grew from 3.0 × 10^8 MIPS in 1986, to 6.4 x 10^12 MIPS in 2007, experiencing the fastest growth rate of over 60% per year during the last two decades.

James R. Beniger describes the necessity of information in modern society in the following way: “The need for sharply increased control that resulted from the industrialization of material processes through application of inanimate sources of energy probably accounts for the rapid development of automatic feedback technology in the early industrial period (1740-1830)” (p. 174)
“Even with enhanced feedback control, industry could not have developed without the enhanced means to process matter and energy, not only as inputs of the raw materials of production but also as outputs distributed to final consumption.”(p. 175)

==Development of the information society model==

One of the first people to develop the concept of the information society was the economist Fritz Machlup. In 1933, Fritz Machlup began studying the effect of patents on research. His work culminated in the study &quot;The production and distribution of knowledge in the United States&quot; in 1962. This book was widely regarded and was eventually translated into Russian and Japanese. The Japanese have also studied the information society (or &quot;jōhōka shakai&quot;, 情報化社会).

The issue of technologies and their role in contemporary society have been discussed in the scientific literature using a range of labels and concepts. This section introduces some of them. Ideas of a knowledge or information economy, post-industrial society, postmodern society, network society, the information revolution, informational capitalism, network capitalism, and the like, have been debated over the last several decades.

Fritz Machlup (1962) introduced the concept of the knowledge industry. He began studying the effects of patents on research before distinguishing five sectors of the knowledge sector: education, research and development, mass media, information technologies, information services. Based on this categorization he calculated that in 1959 29% per cent of the GNP in the USA had been produced in knowledge industries.

=== Economic transition ===
Peter Drucker has argued that there is a transition from an economy based on material goods to one based on knowledge. Marc Porat distinguishes a primary (information goods and services that are directly used in the production, distribution or processing of information) and a secondary sector (information services produced for internal consumption by government and non-information firms) of the information economy.

Porat uses the total value added by the primary and secondary information sector to the GNP as an indicator for the information economy. The OECD has employed Porat&#x27;s definition for calculating the share of the information economy in the total economy (e.g. OECD 1981, 1986). Based on such indicators, the information society has been defined as a society where more than half of the GNP is produced and more than half of the employees are active in the information economy.

For Daniel Bell the number of employees producing services and information is an indicator for the informational character of a society. &quot;A post-industrial society is based on services. (…) What counts is not raw muscle power, or energy, but information. (…) A post industrial society is one in which the majority of those employed are not involved in the production of tangible goods&quot;.

Alain Touraine already spoke in 1971 of the post-industrial society. &quot;The passage to postindustrial society takes place when investment results in the production of symbolic goods that modify values, needs, representations, far more than in the production of material goods or even of &#x27;services&#x27;. Industrial society had transformed the means of production: post-industrial society changes the ends of production, that is, culture. (…) The decisive point here is that in postindustrial society all of the economic system is the object of intervention of society upon itself. That is why we can call it the programmed society, because this phrase captures its capacity to create models of management, production, organization, distribution, and consumption, so that such a society appears, at all its functional levels, as the product of an action exercised by the society itself, and not as the outcome of natural laws or cultural specificities&quot; (Touraine 1988: 104). In the programmed society also the area of cultural reproduction including aspects such as information, consumption, health, research, education would be industrialized. That modern society is increasing its capacity to act upon itself means for Touraine that society is reinvesting ever larger parts of production and so produces and transforms itself. This makes Touraine&#x27;s concept substantially different from that of Daniel Bell who focused on the capacity to process and generate information for efficient society functioning.

Jean-François Lyotard has argued that &quot;knowledge has become the force of production over the last few decades&quot;. Knowledge would be transformed into a commodity. Lyotard says that postindustrial society makes knowledge accessible to the layman because knowledge and information technologies would diffuse into society and break up Grand Narratives of centralized structures and groups. Lyotard denotes these changing circumstances as postmodern condition or postmodern society.

Similarly to Bell, Peter Otto and Philipp Sonntag (1985) say that an information society is a society where the majority of employees work in information jobs, i.e. they have to deal more with information, signals, symbols, and images than with energy and matter. Radovan Richta (1977) argues that society has been transformed into a scientific civilization based on services, education, and creative activities. This transformation would be the result of a scientific-technological transformation based on technological progress and the increasing importance of computer technology. Science and technology would become immediate forces of production (Aristovnik 2014: 55).

Nico Stehr (1994, 2002a, b) says that in the knowledge society a majority of jobs involves working with knowledge. &quot;Contemporary society may be described as a knowledge society based on the extensive penetration of all its spheres of life and institutions by scientific and technological knowledge&quot; (Stehr 2002b: 18). For Stehr, knowledge is a capacity for social action. Science would become an immediate productive force, knowledge would no longer be primarily embodied in machines, but already appropriated nature that represents knowledge would be rearranged according to certain designs and programs (Ibid.: 41-46). For Stehr, the economy of a knowledge society is largely driven not by material inputs, but by symbolic or knowledge-based inputs (Ibid.: 67), there would be a large number of professions that involve working with knowledge, and a declining number of jobs that demand low cognitive skills as well as in manufacturing (Stehr 2002a).

Also Alvin Toffler argues that knowledge is the central resource in the economy of the information society: &quot;In a Third Wave economy, the central resource – a single word broadly encompassing data, information, images, symbols, culture, ideology, and values – is actionable knowledge&quot; (Dyson/Gilder/Keyworth/Toffler 1994).

At the end of the twentieth century, the concept of the network society gained importance in information society theory. For Manuel Castells, network logic is besides information, pervasiveness, flexibility, and convergence a central feature of the information technology paradigm (2000a: 69ff). &quot;One of the key features of informational society is the networking logic of its basic structure, which explains the use of the concept of &#x27;network society&#x27;&quot; (Castells 2000: 21). &quot;As an historical trend, dominant functions and processes in the Information Age are increasingly organized around networks. Networks constitute the new social morphology of our societies, and the diffusion of networking logic substantially modifies the operation and outcomes in processes of production, experience, power, and culture&quot; (Castells 2000: 500). For Castells the network society is the result of informationalism, a new technological paradigm.

Jan Van Dijk (2006) defines the network society as a &quot;social formation with an infrastructure of social and media networks enabling its prime mode of organization at all levels (individual, group/organizational and societal). Increasingly, these networks link all units or parts of this formation (individuals, groups and organizations)&quot; (Van Dijk 2006: 20). For Van Dijk networks have become the nervous system of society, whereas Castells links the concept of the network society to capitalist transformation, Van Dijk sees it as the logical result of the increasing widening and thickening of networks in nature and society. Darin Barney uses the term for characterizing societies that exhibit two fundamental characteristics: &quot;The first is the presence in those societies of sophisticated – almost exclusively digital – technologies of networked communication and information management/distribution, technologies which form the basic infrastructure mediating an increasing array of social, political and economic practices. (…) The second, arguably more intriguing, characteristic of network societies is the reproduction and institutionalization throughout (and between) those societies of networks as the basic form of human organization and relationship across a wide range of social, political and economic configurations and associations&quot;.

=== Critiques ===
The major critique of concepts such as information society, postmodern society, knowledge society, network society, postindustrial society, etc. that has mainly been voiced by critical scholars is that they create the impression that we have entered a completely new type of society. &quot;If there is just more information then it is hard to understand why anyone should suggest that we have before us something radically new&quot; (Webster 2002a: 259). Critics such as Frank Webster argue that these approaches stress discontinuity, as if contemporary society had nothing in common with society as it was 100 or 150 years ago. Such assumptions would have ideological character because they would fit with the view that we can do nothing about change and have to adapt to existing political realities (kasiwulaya 2002b: 267).

These critics argue that contemporary society first of all is still a capitalist society oriented towards accumulating economic, political, and cultural capital. They acknowledge that information society theories stress some important new qualities of society (notably globalization and informatization), but charge that they fail to show that these are attributes of overall capitalist structures. Critics such as Webster insist on the continuities that characterise change. In this way Webster distinguishes between different epochs of capitalism: laissez-faire capitalism of the 19th century, corporate capitalism in the 20th century, and informational capitalism for the 21st century (kasiwulaya 2006).

For describing contemporary society based on a new dialectic of continuity and discontinuity, other critical scholars have suggested several terms like:
* transnational network capitalism, transnational informational capitalism (Christian Fuchs 2008, 2007): &quot;Computer networks are the technological foundation that has allowed the emergence of global network capitalism, that is, regimes of accumulation, regulation, and discipline that are helping to increasingly base the accumulation of economic, political, and cultural capital on transnational network organizations that make use of cyberspace and other new technologies for global coordination and communication. [...] The need to find new strategies for executing corporate and political domination has resulted in a restructuration of capitalism that is characterized by the emergence of transnational, networked spaces in the economic, political, and cultural system and has been mediated by cyberspace as a tool of global coordination and communication. Economic, political, and cultural space have been restructured; they have become more fluid and dynamic, have enlarged their borders to a transnational scale, and handle the inclusion and exclusion of nodes in flexible ways. These networks are complex due to the high number of nodes (individuals, enterprises, teams, political actors, etc.) that can be involved and the high speed at which a high number of resources is produced and transported within them. But global network capitalism is based on structural inequalities; it is made up of segmented spaces in which central hubs (transnational corporations, certain political actors, regions, countries, Western lifestyles, and worldviews) centralize the production, control, and flows of economic, political, and cultural capital (property, power, definition capacities). This segmentation is an expression of the overall competitive character of contemporary society.&quot; (Fuchs 2008: 110+119).
* digital capitalism (Schiller 2000, cf. also Peter Glotz): &quot;networks are directly generalizing the social and cultural range of the capitalist economy as never before&quot; (Schiller 2000: xiv)
* virtual capitalism: the &quot;combination of marketing and the new information technology will enable certain firms to obtain higher profit margins and larger market shares, and will thereby promote greater concentration and centralization of capital&quot; (Dawson/John Bellamy Foster 1998: 63sq),
* high-tech capitalism or informatic capitalism (Fitzpatrick 2002) – to focus on the computer as a guiding technology that has transformed the productive forces of capitalism and has enabled a globalized economy.

Other scholars prefer to speak of information capitalism (Morris-Suzuki 1997) or informational capitalism (Manuel Castells 2000, Christian Fuchs 2005, Schmiede 2006a, b). Manuel Castells sees informationalism as a new technological paradigm (he speaks of a mode of development) characterized by &quot;information generation, processing, and transmission&quot; that have become &quot;the fundamental sources of productivity and power&quot; (Castells 2000: 21). The &quot;most decisive historical factor accelerating, channelling and shaping the information technology paradigm, and inducing its associated social forms, was/is the process of capitalist restructuring undertaken since the 1980s, so that the new techno-economic system can be adequately characterized as informational capitalism&quot; (Castells 2000: 18). Castells has added to theories of the information society the idea that in contemporary society dominant functions and processes are increasingly organized around networks that constitute the new social morphology of society (Castells 2000: 500). Nicholas Garnham is critical of Castells and argues that the latter&#x27;s account is technologically determinist because Castells points out that his approach is based on a dialectic of technology and society in which technology embodies society and society uses technology (Castells 2000: 5sqq). But Castells also makes clear that the rise of a new &quot;mode of development&quot; is shaped by capitalist production, i.e. by society, which implies that technology isn&#x27;t the only driving force of society.

Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt argue that contemporary society is an Empire that is characterized by a singular global logic of capitalist domination that is based on immaterial labour. With the concept of immaterial labour Negri and Hardt introduce ideas of information society discourse into their Marxist account of contemporary capitalism. Immaterial labour would be labour &quot;that creates immaterial products, such as knowledge, information, communication, a relationship, or an emotional response&quot; (Hardt/Negri 2005: 108; cf. also 2000: 280-303), or services, cultural products, knowledge (Hardt/Negri 2000: 290). There would be two forms: intellectual labour that produces ideas, symbols, codes, texts, linguistic figures, images, etc.; and affective labour that produces and manipulates affects such as a feeling of ease, well-being, satisfaction, excitement, passion, joy, sadness, etc. (Ibid.).

Overall, neo-Marxist accounts of the information society have in common that they stress that knowledge, information technologies, and computer networks have played a role in the restructuration and globalization of capitalism and the emergence of a flexible regime of accumulation (David Harvey 1989). They warn that new technologies are embedded into societal antagonisms that cause structural unemployment, rising poverty, social exclusion, the deregulation of the welfare state and of labour rights, the lowering of wages, welfare, etc.

Concepts such as knowledge society, information society, network society, informational capitalism, postindustrial society, transnational network capitalism, postmodern society, etc. show that there is a vivid discussion in contemporary sociology on the character of contemporary society and the role that technologies, information, communication, and co-operation play in it. Information society theory discusses the role of information and information technology in society, the question which key concepts shall be used for characterizing contemporary society, and how to define such concepts. It has become a specific branch of contemporary sociology.

==Second and third nature==

Information society is the means of sending and receiving information from one place to another. As technology has advanced so too has the way people have adapted in sharing information with each other.

&quot;Second nature&quot; refers a group of experiences that get made over by culture. They then get remade into something else that can then take on a new meaning. As a society we transform this process so it becomes something natural to us, i.e. second nature. So, by following a particular pattern created by culture we are able to recognise how we use and move information in different ways. From sharing information via different time zones (such as talking online) to information ending up in a different location (sending a letter overseas) this has all become a habitual process that we as a society take for granted.

However, through the process of sharing information vectors have enabled us to spread information even further. Through the use of these vectors information is able to move and then separate from the initial things that enabled them to move. From here, something called &quot;third nature&quot; has developed. An extension of second nature, third nature is in control of second nature. It expands on what second nature is limited by. It has the ability to mould information in new and different ways. So, third nature is able to ‘speed up, proliferate, divide, mutate, and beam in on us from elsewhere. It aims to create a balance between the boundaries of space and time (see second nature). This can be seen through the telegraph, it was the first successful technology that could send and receive information faster than a human being could move an object. As a result different vectors of people have the ability to not only shape culture but create new possibilities that will ultimately shape society.

Therefore, through the use of second nature and third nature society is able to use and explore new vectors of possibility where information can be moulded to create new forms of interaction.

==Sociological uses==

In sociology, informational society refers to a post-modern type of society. Theoreticians like Ulrich Beck, Anthony Giddens and Manuel Castells argue that since the 1970s a transformation from industrial society to informational society has happened on a global scale.

As steam power was the technology standing behind industrial society, so information technology is seen as the catalyst for the changes in work organisation, societal structure and politics occurring in the late 20th century.

In the book &quot;Future Shock&quot;, Alvin Toffler used the phrase super-industrial society to describe this type of society. Other writers and thinkers have used terms like &quot;post-industrial society&quot; and &quot;post-modern industrial society&quot; with a similar meaning.

== Related terms ==
A number of terms in current use emphasize related but different aspects of the emerging global economic order. The Information Society intends to be the most encompassing in that an economy is a subset of a society. The Information Age is somewhat limiting, in that it refers to a 30-year period between the widespread use of computers and the knowledge economy, rather than an emerging economic order. The knowledge era is about the nature of the content, not the socioeconomic processes by which it will be traded. The computer revolution, and knowledge revolution refer to specific revolutionary transitions, rather than the end state towards which we are evolving. The Information Revolution relates with the well-known terms agricultural revolution and Industrial Revolution.
* The information economy and the knowledge economy emphasize the content or intellectual property that is being traded through an information market or knowledge market, respectively. Electronic commerce and electronic business emphasize the nature of transactions and running a business, respectively, using the Internet and World-Wide Web. The digital economy focuses on trading bits in cyberspace rather than atoms in physical space. The network economy stresses that businesses will work collectively in webs or as part of business ecosystems rather than as stand-alone units. Social networking refers to the process of collaboration on massive, global scales. The internet economy focuses on the nature of markets that are enabled by the Internet.
* Knowledge services and knowledge value put content into an economic context. Knowledge services integrates Knowledge management, within a Knowledge organization, that trades in a Knowledge market. In order for individuals to receive more knowledge, surveillance is used. This relates to the use of Drones as a tool in order to gather knowledge on other individuals. Although seemingly synonymous, each term conveys more than nuances or slightly different views of the same thing. Each term represents one attribute of the likely nature of economic activity in the emerging post-industrial society. Alternatively, the new economic order will incorporate all of the above plus other attributes that have not yet fully emerged.
* In connection with the development of the information society, information pollution appeared, which in turn evolved information ecology – associated with information hygiene.

==Intellectual property considerations==
One of the central paradoxes of the information society is that it makes information easily reproducible, leading to a variety of freedom/control problems relating to intellectual property. Essentially, business and capital, whose place becomes that of producing and selling information and knowledge, seems to require control over this new resource so that it can effectively be managed and sold as the basis of the information economy. However, such control can prove to be both technically and socially problematic. Technically because copy protection is often easily circumvented and socially &quot;rejected&quot; because the users and citizens of the information society can prove to be unwilling to accept such absolute commodification of the facts and information that compose their environment.

Responses to this concern range from the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in the United States (and similar legislation elsewhere) which make copy protection (see Digital rights management) circumvention illegal, to the free software, open source and copyleft movements, which seek to encourage and disseminate the &quot;freedom&quot; of various information products (traditionally both as in &quot;gratis&quot; or free of cost, and liberty, as in freedom to use, explore and share).

Caveat: Information society is often used by politicians meaning something like &quot;we all do internet now&quot;; the sociological term information society (or informational society) has some deeper implications about change of societal structure. Because we lack political control of intellectual property, we are lacking in a concrete map of issues, an analysis of costs and benefits, and functioning political groups that are unified by common interests representing different opinions of this diverse situation that are prominent in the information society.

<doc id="163903" wikidata="Q310515" url="?curid=163903" title="Bernard Hill">
<text>Bernard Hill (17 December 1944 – 5 May 2024) was an English actor. He was known for his versatile roles in both television and film, and his career spanned over fifty years.

Hill first gained prominence as the troubled hard man Yosser Hughes in Alan Bleasdale&#x27;s &quot;Play for Today&quot; drama &quot;The Black Stuff&quot; (1980) and its sequel serial &quot;Boys from the Blackstuff&quot; (1982), the latter earning him a nomination for the BAFTA TV Award for Best Actor. He received an additional nomination for his role as David Blunkett in the drama &quot;A Very Social Secretary&quot; (2005), for which he was also nominated for an International Emmy Award for Best Performance by an Actor. He also appeared on television in &quot;I, Claudius&quot; (1976), the BBC Television Shakespeare productions of &quot;Henry VI, Part 1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, and &quot;3&quot;, and &quot;Richard III&quot; (all 1983), &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1999), and &quot;Wolf Hall&quot; (2015).

Hill gained international recognition for his film roles as Captain Edward Smith in &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997) and Théoden, King of Rohan, in the second and third films of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy (2002–2003). His appearances in &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; (2003), two of only three films to receive 11 Academy Awards, make him the only actor to appear in more than one film which holds that record. His other film roles include &quot;Gandhi&quot; (1982), &quot;The Bounty&quot; (1984), &quot;Shirley Valentine&quot; (1989), &quot;The Ghost and the Darkness&quot; (1996), &quot;True Crime&quot; (1999), &quot;Valkyrie&quot; (2008), and &quot;ParaNorman&quot; (2012).

==Early life and education ==
Bernard Hill was born in Blackley, Manchester, on 17 December 1944. He was brought up in a Catholic family of miners. 

After attending Xaverian College in Rusholme, Hill initially started training to be a teacher. However, a classmate, Mike Leigh, who would later become a renowned writer and director, persuaded him to pursue acting. Hill enrolled at the Manchester Polytechnic School of Drama at the same time as Richard Griffiths. In 1970, Hill graduated with a Diploma in Theatre.

==Career==
Hill first came to prominence in 1980 as Yosser Hughes, a working-class Liverpudlian man ultimately driven to the edge by an uncaring welfare system, in Alan Bleasdale&#x27;s BBC &quot;Play for Today&quot; programme, &quot;The Black Stuff&quot;, and its series sequel, &quot;Boys from the Blackstuff&quot;. His character&#x27;s much-repeated phrase &quot;Gizza job&quot; (&quot;Give us a job&quot;) became popular with protesters against Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s Conservative government, because of the high unemployment of the time.

Hill then appeared as Sergeant Putnam in &quot;Gandhi&quot; (1982), directed by Richard Attenborough. Next for him was Roger Donaldson&#x27;s &quot;The Bounty&quot; (1984), a fourth dramatisation of the mutiny on HMS &quot;Bounty&quot;. He had previously taken smaller parts in a number of British television dramas, appearing in &quot;I, Claudius&quot;, in 1976, as the character Gratus.

In 1985 he played the lead role in a TV dramatisation of John Lennon&#x27;s life, &quot;A Journey in the Life&quot;. In addition to TV roles, Hill appeared on stage in &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot;, and the title roles in &quot;Macbeth&quot; and &quot;A View from the Bridge&quot;.

Hill appeared in &quot;Shirley Valentine&quot; (1989), as Joe Bradshaw the husband of Liverpool housewife (Pauline Collins), a former anti-establishment rebel who engages in an extramarital affair. Hill added more prominent films to his resume, including &quot;Mountains of the Moon&quot; (1990), &quot;Skallagrigg&quot; (1994) and &quot;Madagascar Skin&quot; (1995).

In the mid-1990s, Hill began appearing in films more regularly. His first major role came in &quot;The Ghost and the Darkness&quot; (1996), starring Val Kilmer and Michael Douglas. Hill then portrayed Captain Edward J. Smith in &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997), by James Cameron. He then played Luther Plunkitt, the Warden of San Quentin Prison, in the Clint Eastwood film &quot;True Crime&quot; (1999).

Hill played Philos in &quot;The Scorpion King&quot; (2002), starring Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson, Michael Clarke Duncan and Kelly Hu.

Hill played King Théoden of Rohan in the second and third installments of Peter Jackson&#x27;s epic trilogy, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, which were released in 2002 and 2003 respectively. 

Hill played a minor role in the 2008 film &quot;Valkyrie&quot;, as the commanding general of the 10th Panzer Division of the German Afrika Korps, and was a voice actor for the character Sir Walter Beck in the video game &quot;Fable III&quot; (2010).

Hill was the voice of The Judge in the American stop motion animated comedy horror film &quot;ParaNorman&quot; in 2012. He played Samuel Cotton, who ran a sweet factory with his son in the 2014 three-part BBC drama series about Manchester &quot;From There to Here&quot;. 

Hill appeared as Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, in the 2015 six-part BBC adaptation of Hilary Mantel&#x27;s novels, &quot;Wolf Hall&quot;. Later in 2015, he starred as John Claridge in the British gangster movie &quot;North v South&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Hill had a daughter from a relationship with Sue Allen, and a son from a relationship with Annabel Turner.

Hill was a longtime supporter of Manchester United. In 2019, he received an honorary degree from the University of East Anglia.

Hill, who was living in Reydon, Suffolk, died on 5 May 2024, aged 79. Tributes were paid to him by his &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy co-stars, &quot;Boys from the Blackstuff&quot; writer Alan Bleasdale and musician Barbara Dickson.

<doc id="163920" wikidata="Q847678" url="?curid=163920" title="The Song Remains the Same (album)">
<text>The Song Remains the Same is the live soundtrack album of the concert film of the same name by the English rock band Led Zeppelin. The soundtrack was recorded 27–29 July 1973 and released on 22 October 1976 on Swan Song Records.

==Overview==
The recording of the album and the film took place during three nights of concerts at New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden, during the band&#x27;s 1973 North American tour. All songs were recorded by Eddie Kramer using the Wally Heider Mobile Studio truck, and later mixed at Electric Lady Studios in New York and Trident Studios in London.

The sleeve design depicts a dilapidated movie house on Old Street film studios in London, where the group rehearsed for their 1973 tour.

Until the album and the film were remastered and re-released in 2007, they featured slightly different track lists:

*The soundtrack album included &quot;Celebration Day&quot;, which did not appear in the film. The album did not include several songs featured in the film, including &quot;Black Dog&quot;, &quot;Since I&#x27;ve Been Loving You&quot;, &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;, the instrumental &quot;Bron-Yr-Aur&quot; (which appeared on &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot;), and a hurdy-gurdy piece called &quot;Autumn Lake&quot;.

In addition, some of the recordings featured on the album were of different performances from those in the film. 

Some tracks recorded at Madison Square Garden were omitted from both the film and the soundtrack album: &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot;, &quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot;, &quot;The Ocean&quot;, and &quot;Thank You&quot;.

==2007 reissue==
The surviving band members oversaw the remixing and remastering of the original release, and &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot; soundtrack album was reissued on CD on 20 November 2007. This coincided with the re-issue of the film, released on HD-DVD, Blu-ray and DVD. The new version of the soundtrack included six songs that were not on the original album release: &quot;Black Dog&quot;, &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot;, &quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot;, &quot;Since I&#x27;ve Been Loving You&quot;, &quot;The Ocean&quot; and &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;, plus new liner notes by Cameron Crowe.

With the 2007 re-release of both the album and film, the songs were synchronised so that the full set-list from the concerts was available on both, with each song mixed the same way. Kevin Shirley, who worked on &quot;How The West Was Won&quot;, was involved in the mixing.

Due to legal complications, the band decided not to change the video portion of the original movie for the re-release. Instead, Shirley created an entirely new mix of the three 1973 Madison Square Garden concerts so that the audio portion of the film would better match the on-screen visuals. The audio on the new CD release was nearly identical to the soundtrack of the new DVD release. One difference was that the songs included on the CDs that were not featured in the original movie were included as bonus tracks on the DVD.

The audio mixes also differed from those found on the 2003 &quot;Led Zeppelin DVD&quot;. The most obvious example is that &quot;Black Dog&quot; was two minutes longer on the 2003 DVD than on the 2007 releases, two of the four verses being cut from the song.

On 29 July 2008, a four-LP edition of the 2007 re-issue, on 180 gram audiophile vinyl, was released. It was presented in a deluxe archival two-piece box with foil-stamping. It includes a 12-page oversized full-colour booklet with dozens of previously unpublished stills from the film, as well as four individual jackets with new and unique artwork. A special white vinyl edition was also printed in very limited numbers. Just 200 were produced, with only 100 being made available to the public from Led Zeppelin&#x27;s official website.

== 2018 reissue ==
On 7 September 2018, a newly remastered edition of &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot; was issued in multiple formats, including a multi-disc, super deluxe boxed set, Blu-ray audio with a hi-resolution stereo and new 5.1 surround mix, 180-gram vinyl, CD, streaming and downloads, including 24-bit/96k hi-res audio files for the first time. This is based on the 2007 version of the soundtrack album and concludes the campaign of reissues of their live albums and deluxe editions of their studio albums that started in 2014.

== Critical reception ==
Upon its initial release in 1976, the album received some mixed reviews, with a number of critics considering it to be over-produced and lumbering. Indeed, the band&#x27;s members themselves have since expressed a lack of fondness for the recording. Page has admitted that the end product was not the best representation of Led Zeppelin as a live band.

In contrast, the 2007 reissued version received generally much more positive reviews. In a review published in &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine in December 2007 James McNair gave the album four out of five stars, as did David Cavanagh in &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine, who wrote:

<doc id="163930" wikidata="Q965818" url="?curid=163930" title="Lights Out (UFO album)">
<text>Lights Out is the sixth studio album by English rock band UFO, released in 1977. All songs are band originals except &quot;Alone Again Or&quot;, a cover of a song by the band Love. Reaching number 23 on the Billboard 200, it is the band&#x27;s highest-charting album in the United States. In the UK, it hit number 54 and stayed on the chart for two weeks.

The album was UFO&#x27;s first to feature lush string arrangements, alongside more complex song structures than on previous albums. Producer Ron Nevison brought in Alan McMillan to handle the string and horn arrangements. The most notable song to feature orchestral colouring was &quot;Love to Love&quot;. &quot;Lights Out&quot; is also the first UFO album to feature Paul Raymond on keyboards and rhythm guitar.

In 1994, a CD comprising this album and &quot;No Heavy Petting&quot; was released by BGO Records. 2008 EMI&#x27;s remastered edition includes four live tracks recorded at The Roundhouse, London. The album cover erroneously states that these tracks were recorded in 1976: the correct year is 1977. EMI did, however, correct the writing credits, with Paul Raymond finally being acknowledged for his contributions.

==Legacy==
The title track and &quot;Love to Love&quot; were featured in the 1999 movie &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot;. &quot;Love to Love&quot; was covered by Djali Zwan for the 2002 movie &quot;Spun&quot; and by Europe for their 2008 live album Almost Unplugged. An instrumental version of &quot;Too Hot to Handle&quot; is used at the beginning of Mark Madden&#x27;s radio show on WXDX-FM in Pittsburgh, Madden being a longtime fan of UFO.

&quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine listed the album at No.28 among the &quot;100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

Steve Harris of Iron Maiden called &quot;Love to Love&quot; his favourite song. &quot;&#x27;Love to Love&#x27; is brilliantly written and constructed,&quot; observed Quireboys guitarist Guy Griffin. &quot;It has a majesty that makes it world-class. The Quireboys covered it… and when you do that, you get to understand how good the song is.&quot;

==Track listing==

*The date of the live show stated on the album cover and booklet is incorrect. The show was on 2 April 1977, not in 1976.

<doc id="163952" wikidata="Q3942229" url="?curid=163952" title="Rude Awakening (Prong album)">
<text>Rude Awakening is the fifth studio album by American metal band Prong. It is an enhanced CD but was also released as a special limited edition on 12&quot; red vinyl. The album was reissued in 2008 as a digipak version, featuring four remixes of the &quot;Rude Awakening&quot; single and a new booklet.

&quot;Rude Awakening&quot; entered the Billboard charts at No. 107 and sold 10,000 units in the United States in its first week. It is the last Prong album to feature Ted Parsons and Paul Raven, as well as the band&#x27;s last album on Epic Records.

== Background and musical style ==
Continuing from the developments on 1994&#x27;s &quot;Cleansing&quot;, &quot;Rude Awakening&quot; sees a further pursuit of the industrial style. Following the departure of keyboardist John Bechdel in 1995, electronic contributions would be managed by Charlie Clouser of Nine Inch Nails. The tracks are also comparatively slower than what could be found on prior releases by the band. The album&#x27;s opener, &quot;Controller&quot;, contains an identical riff to the song &quot;Doomsayer&quot; by Argyle Park. Frontman/guitarist Tommy Victor had contributed to the latter song and reused the guitar part for the former.

== Reception ==

Reviewing the title track, &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote that the single&#x27;s &quot;assaulting, deviant style&quot; shows why Prong is popular. Jenni Glenn of CMJ New Music Monthly wrote that the album is heavier and angrier than &quot;Cleansing&quot;, blending thrash metal and industrial music.

<text>The Japan Times is Japan&#x27;s largest and oldest English-language daily newspaper. It is published by , a subsidiary of News2u Holdings, Inc. It is headquartered in the in Kioicho, Chiyoda, Tokyo.

==History==

&quot;The Japan Times&quot; was launched by on 22 March 1897, with the goal of giving Japanese people an opportunity to read and discuss news and current events in English to help Japan participate in the international community.

In 1906, Zumoto was asked by Japanese Resident-General of Korea Itō Hirobumi to lead the English-language newspaper &quot;The Seoul Press&quot;. Zumoto closely tied the operations of the two newspapers, with subscriptions of &quot;The Seoul Press&quot; being sold in Japan by &quot;The Japan Times&quot;, and vice versa for Korea. Both papers wrote critically of Korean culture and civilization, and advocated for Japan&#x27;s colonial control over the peninsula in order to civilize the Koreans.

The newspaper was independent of government control, but from 1931 onward, the paper&#x27;s editors experienced mounting pressure from the Japanese government to submit to its policies. In 1933, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs appointed Hitoshi Ashida, former ministry official, as chief editor.

During World War II, the newspaper served as an outlet for Imperial Japanese government communication and editorial opinion. It was successively renamed The Japan Times and Mail (1918–1940) following its merger with &quot;The Japan Mail&quot;, The Japan Times and Advertiser (1940–1943) following its merger with &quot;The Japan Advertiser&quot;, and Nippon Times (1943–1956), before reverting to the &quot;Japan Times&quot; title in 1956. The temporary change to &quot;Nippon Times&quot; occurred during the ban on English language sentiment during World War II-era Japan.

Shintaro Fukushima (1907–1987) became president of &quot;The Japan Times&quot; in 1956. He sold some of the company&#x27;s shares to Toshiaki Ogasawara (小笠原 敏晶 &quot;Ogasawara Toshiaki&quot;), who was chairman of Nifco, a manufacturer of automotive fasteners. Fukushima renounced management rights in 1983, after which Nifco acquired control of &quot;The Japan Times&quot; and brought about staff changes and alterations to the company&#x27;s traditions established in 1897. Ogasawara served as the chairman and publisher of &quot;The Japan Times&quot; until 2016, when his daughter Yukiko Ogasawara (小笠原 有輝子 &quot;Ogasawara Yukiko&quot;) succeeded him as chairman of the company. She had previously served as the company&#x27;s president from 2006 to 2012, when she was replaced by career &quot;Japan Times&quot; staffer Takeharu Tsutsumi. Nifco sold &quot;The Japan Times&quot; to PR firm News2u Holdings, Inc. on 30 June 2017.

==Content==

&quot;The Japan Times&quot; publishes &quot;The Japan Times&quot;, &quot;The Japan Times On Sunday&quot;, &quot;The Japan Times Alpha&quot; (a bilingual weekly), books in English and Japanese. Staff at &quot;The Japan Times&quot; are represented by two unions, one of which is Tozen.

===Print===
The Japan Times, Ltd. publishes three periodicals: &quot;The Japan Times&quot;, an English-language daily broadsheet; &quot;The Japan Times Weekly&quot;, an English-language weekly in tabloid form; and &quot;Shukan ST&quot;, also a weekly in tabloid form, targeted at Japanese readers learning the English language. Since 16 October 2013, &quot;The Japan Times&quot; has been printed and sold along with &quot;The New York Times International Edition&quot;.

===Web===
Printed stories from &quot;The Japan Times&quot; are archived online. The newspaper has a readers&#x27; forum and, since 2013, the website offers a section for readers&#x27; comments below articles. This came about during a redesign and redevelopment of the newspaper, using Responsive Web Design techniques so the site is optimised for all digital devices. &quot;The Japan Times&quot; has a social media presence on Twitter, and Facebook since 2007.

==Controversy==
After being acquired by News2u, &quot;The Japan Times&quot; changed its editorial stance and contributor lineup as part of efforts to reduce criticism of the newspaper as an &quot;anti-Japanese&quot; outlet. In November 2018, it was announced in an editor&#x27;s note that subsequent articles would use the term &quot;wartime laborers&quot; rather than &quot;forced labor&quot;, and &quot;comfort women&quot; would be referred to as &quot;women who worked in wartime brothels, including those who did so against their will, to provide sex to Japanese soldiers&quot;, instead of the previously used &quot;women who were forced to provide sex for Japanese troops before and during World War II.&quot; The change drew immediate criticism from readers and employees, with particular concerns expressed over the paper&#x27;s apparent alignment with the political positions of Prime Minister Shinzō Abe. In response to these criticisms, &quot;The Japan Times&quot; wrote in an article on 7 December 2018, &quot;We must admit that the editorial note undermined the relationships of trust we have built with our readers, reporters and staff. I would like to apologize for the inconvenience&quot;, and denied criticism that it was in line with the intentions of the administration.

<text>The New York Times International Edition is an English-language daily newspaper distributed internationally by the New York Times Company. It has been published in two separate periods, one from 1943 to 1967 and one from 2013 to the present.

==First incarnation==
===Overseas Weekly===
The history of the international edition of the &quot;New York Times&quot; began in June 1943, following a visit by Times publisher Arthur Hays Sulzberger to Tehran, where he met with Brigadier General Donald H. Connolly of the Persian Gulf Service Command, who were in charge of moving Allied supplies to the Soviet Union via the Persian Corridor. Morale among the U.S. troops there was low, due to the difficult climate, unrewarding tasks, and isolation away from any of the combat fronts. Accordingly, Sulzberger decided to make an edition of the Times that could keep the troops informed and give them more awareness of how their efforts fit into the overall war effort. That product, the eight-page tabloid-sized Overseas Weekly edition, was a condensed version of the existing Sunday paper&#x27;s News of the Week in Review section; it premiered in an edition dated August 22, 1943, but not available in Tehran until September 9.

The edition was popular and soon spread, and at its height during the war the Overseas Weekly was being printed in more than twenty locations around the globe. After the war, publication of the Overseas Weekly was limited to Frankfurt and Tokyo, where U.S. occupation forces were, with printing being done at the facilities of the &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung&quot; and the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; respectively.

===United Nations Edition and International Air Edition===
During the third session of the United Nations General Assembly, which was held in Paris from September 21 to December 12, 1948, the &quot;Times&quot; created a United Nations Edition of the paper, which was flown to Paris each day.

This edition received a favorable reception, and beginning on December 11, 1948, the &quot;Times&quot; began its International Air Edition. Initially it consisted of 10–12 pages that were printed in whole in the United States and then flown to Europe, but in June 1949 the production process was changed so that only cardboard mats were flown over and the actual printing took place in Paris. The edition focused on U.S. national and international news and generally omitted New York area news and sports coverage.

As part of the June 1949 changes, the &quot;Overseas Weekly&quot; ended with a final issue on June 19, 1949, after which it was folded into the Sunday edition of the International Air Edition.

In 1952, production of the international edition was shifted from Paris to Amsterdam, as part of minimizing transportation costs.

===International edition===
In 1960, advances in teletypesetting allowed simultaneous printing of papers in New York and Europe; in conjunction with this, the international edition moved back to Paris. It was called the International Edition of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The Times organization hoped to compete with the European edition of the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, which was also based in Paris and had a long, established history. Accordingly, the Times gave their publication a much larger budget for promotion than the Paris Herald Tribune had, and circulation improved somewhat.

Beginning in 1964, editorial control for the international edition shifted to Paris itself, and some independent reporting was being done out of that office. It was published on the in the 2nd arrondissement of Paris.

The New York Times had money-losing operations in maintaining both a Western U.S. edition and its International Edition. In January 1964, the paper announced that it was dropping its Western edition for financial reasons, but would keep on with the international one and move to a more streamlined production process for it.
By then, the International Edition of &quot;The New York Times&quot; had a circulation of some 32,000, but attracted little advertising. As a commercial proposition it was inferior to the European edition of the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, which had a circulation of almost 50,000 and more advertising in it.

While the International Edition grew somewhat, it was still losing money and was not competitive with the European edition of the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, which was generally considered a stronger publication. Indeed, the international edition was losing $2 million a year, and had lost some $10 million since its creation under that title in 1949. The new &quot;Times&quot; publisher, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, decided to give up on it, and instead join forces with the &quot;Washington Post&quot; for a continuation of the European edition of the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot;.

The final issue of the first incarnation of the &quot;New York Times&quot; international edition came out on May 20, 1967. The over 100 people working on it were laid off.

==&quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;==
In 1967, &quot;The New York Times&quot; joined &quot;The Washington Post&quot; along with Whitney Communications to publish the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; in Paris.

In December 2002, The New York Times Company purchased the 50% stake owned by The Washington Post Company and the paper retained the name &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;.

==Second incarnation==
===Change of name, closing of offices===

In 2013, the New York Times Company announced that the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; was being renamed &quot;The International New York Times&quot;.

On October 14, 2013, the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; appeared on newsstands for the last time and ceased publication.

In October 2016, the NYT&#x27;s international edition was renamed &quot;The New York Times International Edition&quot;.

In Autumn 2016, the Paris newsroom, which had been the headquarters for editing and preproduction operations of the paper&#x27;s international edition, was closed, although a news bureau and an advertising office remained.

===&quot;The New York Times International Weekly&quot;===
Besides the daily edition, a weekly 16-page edition is published as &quot;The New York Times International Weekly&quot; featuring the best of &quot;New York Times&quot; articles for a week. Designed to complement and extend local reporting, it offers readers globally resonant coverage of ideas and trends, business and politics, science and lifestyles and more. Host papers can monetize the &quot;NYT International Weekly&quot; through built-in advertising space, sponsorship and other opportunities to generate revenue.

==Defunct newspapers==
===&quot;The Paris Herald&quot;===

&quot;The Paris Herald&quot; was founded on 4 October 1887 as the European edition of the &quot;New York Herald&quot; by the parent paper&#x27;s owner, James Gordon Bennett, Jr.

===&quot;Paris Herald Tribune&quot;===

After the death of Bennett in 1918, Frank Munsey bought the &quot;New York Herald&quot; and the &quot;Paris Herald&quot;. Munsey sold the &quot;Herald&quot; newspapers in 1924 to Ogden Mills Reid of the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot;, thus creating the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, while the European edition became the &quot;Paris Herald Tribune&quot;.

In 1934, the Paris paper acquired its main competitor: the European Edition of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;.

In 1959, John Hay Whitney, a businessman and United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom, bought the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; and its European edition. In 1966, the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; was merged into the short-lived &quot;New York World Journal Tribune&quot; and ceased publication, but the Whitney family kept the Paris paper going through partnerships. In December 1966 &quot;The Washington Post&quot; became a joint owner.

===&quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;===

&quot;The New York Times&quot; became a joint owner of the &quot;Paris Herald Tribune&quot; in May 1967, whereupon the newspaper became known as the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; (IHT).

In 1991, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; became sole and equal shareholders of the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;.

The &quot;Washington Post&quot; subsequently sold its stake in the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;.

<doc id="163975" wikidata="Q845700" url="?curid=163975" title="Bounce (Bon Jovi album)">
<text>Bounce is the eighth studio album by American rock band Bon Jovi, released on October 8, 2002 through Island Records. Produced by Luke Ebbin, Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora, the album was recorded at Sanctuary II Studio in New Jersey.

&quot;Bounce&quot; was heavily influenced by the September 11 attacks, owing in part to Jon Bon Jovi&#x27;s proximity to New York City. The title &quot;Bounce&quot; was a reference to New York City&#x27;s and the United States&#x27; ability to bounce back from the World Trade Center attacks as a nation. Its cover art, a stylized image of a radio telescope dish at the Very Large Array, was photographed by Kevin Westenberg and produced by Kevin Reagan.

The album debuted at #2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making it Bon Jovi&#x27;s highest debut in the band&#x27;s history at that time, although it became their first album not to reach Platinum status in the US.

==Background==

In end of July 2001, during the final tour One Wild Night Tour, Jon Bon Jovi confirmed for the &quot;Billboard&quot; that he started to write new songs for the &quot;Crush&quot; (2000) follow-up and that the entire band is planning to start recording from January 2002. Also, he confirmed that band were planning to release the boxset in 2003, in conjunction with the band&#x27;s 20th anniversary. Between June and October 2001, band members wrote 25 songs and demoed totally 12 of them. Many of those songs were written in September, and they were influenced by the September 11 attacks. Those songs were &quot;Standing&quot; and &quot;Another Reason to Believe&quot;.

At the end of July 2001, Bon Jovi finished their Crush world tour with two sold-out shows at Giants Stadium in New Jersey. The band then took a three-week break after which Jon and Richie Sambora started writing songs, first in Los Angeles and later in New Jersey. They have demoed some of those new songs in New Jersey in November 2001. After that, Jon had to fulfill an acting commitment to the TV series &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; (1997-2002), so he stayed at Sambora&#x27;s house in Los Angeles and during that time they continued with the songwriting process and demoing process at Luke Ebbin&#x27;s house. Songwriting and demoing process went on until March 2002, and between March and June 2002, the album was recorded. By early July 2002. all the songs that ended up on the album were mixed and by the late July of the same year they were mastered. In a period of less than a year, the band wrote approximately 40 songs, 12 songs ended up on the album and several more songs in their demo versions ended up on singles as B-sides. During the songwriting process, the band also wrote some songs that were written as a cathartic exercise. Those songs were written right after the September 11 attacks and they were mainly of woe from lyrical standpoint because they were influenced by that tragedy. Jon said that those songs were only written and will never be recorded.

==Lyrics and music==

After a one-album absence, perennial Bon Jovi collaborator Desmond Child returned to co-write four of the album&#x27;s 12 songs. The lyrics in the song &quot;Undivided&quot; were influenced by the September 11 attacks. It simply states that &quot;&quot; and that all people are part of the greater world that is humanity, and that all people are stronger together than being apart. &quot;Everyday&quot; was also inspired by the September 11 attacks. It reinforces the need to live each day to its fullest and the lyrics acknowledge the harshness of life, but encourage listeners to &quot;brush themselves off&quot;, get back up on their feet and get on with life. &quot;The Distance&quot; is written in a cinematic style. The music serves as a score to the lyrics, which begins as an establishing shot and the &quot;camera&quot; draws closer into the story as the song progresses. The lyrics talk about the passion that a person feels when there is a goal in sight and displays the determination shown when that person is striving to reach that goal. &quot;Joey&quot; is influenced and inspired by Elton John&#x27;s song &quot;Levon&quot; (1971) and talks about a character who befriends a simple-minded young man. &quot;Misunderstood&quot; is a song about anyone who has said the wrong thing and has had to face the consequences. The song was written after Jon Bon Jovi came home after long period of time and he realised there were portions of his personal life he had neglected and wrote this song to admit his guilt. &quot;All About Lovin&#x27; You&quot; is a love song that talks about appreciating the love of another. It was also influenced by the events of September 11 and how many people rediscovered that love is the most important thing in life.

&quot;Hook Me Up&quot; is a song that was inspired by a newspaper article about a young Palestinian man in occupied territory who was trying desperately to make contact with people via an old, beat-up ham radio. It was written from the young man&#x27;s perspective who was trapped in a small corner of the world, amidst horrible events when all he wanted was communication and a connection with the outside world and other people. &quot;Right Side of Wrong&quot; is a modern-day Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid song that talks about good people involved with the wrong people but have their hearts in the right place. &quot;Love Me Back to Life&quot; is about world-weariness and the need for someone or something that will breathe the life back into one and allow them to appreciate the world again. &quot;You Had Me from Hello&quot; is about a committed relationship and the ability for someone to constantly see something new and beautiful in the one they love. The title was taken from a phrase spoken by Cameron Crowe in his film &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; (1996). The title track &quot;Bounce&quot; was originally written near the end of the One Wild Night Tour and had more sports-oriented lyrics. However, after the events of September 11, the song became a declaration of strength and defiance. It refers to the city of New York, and the United States as a whole, but also to the band&#x27;s perseverance over a twenty-year career. &quot;Open All Night&quot; is written as a dialog between two characters in TV series &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; (1997-2002): Ally McBeal and Victor Morrison, a plumber and a babysitter portrayed by Jon Bon Jovi. Jon appeared in nine episodes as the character and the storyline involving Ally and Victor was romantic. Jon admitted that if that happened in real life, he would either never allow it to take so long or he would have moved on. .

==Critical reception==

&quot;Bounce&quot; received generally mixed to unfavorable reviews from critics. At &quot;Metacritic&quot;, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 61 out of 100, which indicates &quot;favorable reviews&quot; based on 8 reviews. Though, Stephen Thomas Erlewine from &quot;Allmusic&quot; gave the album 2 stars out of 5 stating that album &quot;After all, this is a record where Bon Jovi seems to have consciously decided to avoid everything that gives their music character, melody, and muscle, a move that would have been odd at any point during their career, but is particularly puzzling after they delivered an album that found them growing old gracefully. It&#x27;s as if they want to undo everything &quot;Crush&quot; did for them&quot;. David Browne from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; rated the album with C stating that &quot;Bon Jovi have every right to write and sing topical songs. But the results are sonically grating (the music feels shrill and compressed) and strained, reducing the emotions and situations connected to Sept. 11 to stadium chants&quot;. Natalie Nichols from &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; gave the album 2 stars out of 4 stating that &quot;This time the music&#x27;s trademark epic quality comes less from Richie Sambora&#x27;s sprawling guitar work than from an overdose of strings and piano that reflects singer-actor Jon Bon Jovi&#x27;s movie and TV interests&quot;. Gavin Edwards from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album 3 stars out of 5 by saying that &quot;The title Bounce is meant to be an exhortation to America after 9/11, and if it doesn&#x27;t exactly offer poetic catharsis, the existence of the eighth Bon Jovi record is reassurance of a different kind: Life goes on&quot;. &quot;Sputnikmusic&quot; gave the album 3.5 stars out of 5 saying that &quot;Fueled by an emotional theme, Bon Jovi end up making their best album of the millennium era&quot;. Steven Poole from &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave the album 2 stars out of 5 saying that &quot;for most of the record Jon Bon Jovi sounds puzzlingly like Elvis Costello or Elton John, and sugary ballads predominate, with Bruce Hornby-like piano intros and tasteful acoustic-guitar lines leading to swollen, meaningless choruses&quot;.

<doc id="163982" wikidata="Q508678" url="?curid=163982" title="Budgie (band)">
<text>Budgie were a Welsh heavy metal band from Cardiff. The band formed in 1967, and recorded a demo the following year. 

In 1971, their first album was blues-oriented hard rock and produced by Rodger Bain, released by MCA. Later records found Budgie gradually moving into a harder and more aggressive sound. The band, usually a classic power trio with the occasional keyboard player, released ten albums, with MCA, A&amp;M, and RCA, between 1971 and 1982, attracting a fair number of fans and achieving modest commercial success. 

Budgie were one of the earliest heavy metal bands, and according to Garry Sharpe-Young they were a seminal influence on many acts of that scene, particularly the new wave of British heavy metal, and later acts such as Metallica. The band have been noted as &quot;among the heaviest metal of its day&quot;.

==History==
Budgie formed in 1967 in Cardiff, Wales, under the name Hills Contemporary Grass. The original line-up consisted of Burke Shelley on vocals and bass, Tony Bourge on guitar and vocals and Ray Phillips on drums. After performing several gigs in 1968, the band changed their name to Budgie the following year and recorded their first demo. The band had initially considered going under the name &quot;Six Ton Budgie&quot;, but decided the shorter single word variant was preferable. Burke Shelley has said that the band&#x27;s name came from the fact that he &quot;loved the idea of playing noisy, heavy rock, but calling ourselves after something diametrically opposed to that&quot;.

Their eponymous debut album of strong, blues-oriented hard rock was recorded at Rockfield Studios with Black Sabbath producer Rodger Bain and released in 1971. It was followed by &quot;Squawk&quot; in 1972. The third album, &quot;Never Turn Your Back on a Friend&quot; (1973), contained &quot;Breadfan&quot;, which was covered by Metallica in 1987. Metallica had earlier covered another Budgie song, &quot;Crash Course in Brain Surgery&quot;. Ray Phillips left the band before the fourth album &quot;In for the Kill!&quot; was recorded. He was replaced by Pete Boot.

In late 1974, Boot left and was replaced by Steve Williams for the album &quot;Bandolier&quot;. For concerts promoting this album and the follow-up, &quot;If I Were Brittania I&#x27;d Waive the Rules&quot;, the band were augmented by second guitarist Myf Isaac. Music from the 1978 LP &quot;Impeckable&quot; featured in the 1979 film &quot;J-Men Forever&quot; (shown frequently on the USA Network&#x27;s &quot;Night Flight&quot; T.V. in the 1980s), which is now considered a cult classic. Bourge and Isaac left in 1978 and were replaced by ex-Trapeze guitarist Robert Kendrick and ex-Hawkwind guitarist Huw Lloyd-Langton. Langton&#x27;s stint was short-lived as Kendrick convinced the band to dismiss him. In late 1978, having been dropped by A&amp;M and with no recording contract, this line-up floundered, and after 12 months Kendrick was replaced by &quot;Big&quot; John Thomas (b. 21 February 1952) in late 1979. This line-up recorded two albums for Kingsley Ward&#x27;s &#x27;Active&#x27; label: &quot;Power Supply&quot; (1980) and &quot;Nightflight&quot; (1981). 1982 saw them signed to RCA for &quot;Deliver Us from Evil&quot;, their final recording for a major label.
The band continued to have success during the new wave of British heavy metal period, playing the Reading Festival in 1980 and then headlining the festival in 1982. They built a particular following in Poland, where they played as the first heavy metal band behind the Iron Curtain, in 1982. Also notable was their tour in support of Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s Blizzard of Ozz Tour.

The band stopped gigging in 1987. Members went into studio production, occasionally guesting on other projects; Thomas most notably worked on the &quot;Phenomena&quot; CD with Glenn Hughes out of the Black Sabbath studios.

Although the group had little commercial success in America, they have enjoyed a strong cult following in Texas, and received radio airplay from Joe Anthony and Lou Roney on KMAC/KISS radio in San Antonio in the 1970s, as well as KSHE95 in St. Louis. The band reformed using various drummers for one-off gigs in 1995 and 1996 for outdoor festivals &#x27;La Semana Alegre&#x27; in San Antonio, Texas. In 1999, the band officially reformed in Letchworth. They toured in 2002–2006, mostly in the United Kingdom, the NYC/NJ area, Dallas, and with a few shows in Europe including the Sweden Rock Festival and a return to Poland. In 2006, Budgie undertook a 35-date UK tour and released the album &quot;You&#x27;re All Living in Cuckooland&quot; on 7 November. In 2007 they played in Sweden and Poland.

On 4 July 2007, Lees announced his departure from the band to concentrate on teaching and a solo career. Following the departure of Lees, Dio lead guitarist and songwriter Craig Goldy offered his services while Ronnie James Dio was completing commitments with Heaven &amp; Hell. In February 2008, Craig Goldy accompanied Budgie on their first tour of Australia, and continued playing with the band as &#x27;guest guitarist&#x27; for all their shows.

Budgie&#x27;s November 2010 tour of Central Europe had to be cancelled as Shelley was hospitalised on 9 November in Wejherowo, Poland, with a 6 cm aortic aneurysm. After surgery, he returned to Britain for recovery. This was effectively the end of the band.

On 3 March 2016, former guitarist John Thomas died at the age of 63 after being admitted to hospital with pneumonia. The news of his death was confirmed by drummer Steve Williams on Facebook: &quot;My friend and fellow BUDGIE band member John Thomas sadly passed away last night. My thoughts are with the loved ones he left behind.&quot;

In February 2018, former drummer Pete Boot died at the age of 67. For many years he had been coping with Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

In April 2018, founder member and original drummer Ray Phillips released his autobiography.

After more than a decade of health issues, including an aortic aneurysm and Stickler syndrome, Shelley died on 10 January 2022, at the age of 71.

==Musical style and legacy==
Budgie are best known as a hard rock and heavy metal band who incorporated elements of progressive rock and humour into their musical style. With 1975&#x27;s &quot;Bandolier&quot;, they began to also incorporate funk.

Budgie&#x27;s music was described in the All-Music Guide as a cross between Rush and Black Sabbath. Burke Shelley&#x27;s vocals have been compared to Geddy Lee due to his similar approach of high-pitched banshee wails (coincidentally, Shelley and Lee are also the bass players in their respective power-trio bands). Although Budgie remained quite obscure during their early career, many future stars of hard rock/metal have cited them as an important influence and covered their songs, including Iron Maiden, Metallica, Megadeth, Van Halen, Melvins, Queens of the Stone Age, Alice in Chains, and Soundgarden.

Metallica released a cover of &quot;Breadfan&quot; in September 1988 as a B-side to their &quot;Harvester of Sorrow&quot; single. It was later included on their 1998 album &quot;Garage Inc.&quot;, and was also used as an encore during their 1988–1989 tour supporting their &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; album. A live video version is present on the &quot;Live Shit: Binge &amp; Purge&quot; boxed set, taken from their Seattle concerts on 29 and 30 August 1989 where it was performed in the second encore. It was also played with frequency during the Madly in Anger with the World Tour and World Magnetic Tour. A short clip of &quot;Breadfan&quot; is played at the beginning of the &quot;Whiskey in the Jar&quot; music video. They also covered &quot;Crash Course in Brain Surgery&quot; on the &quot;Garage Days Re-Revisited&quot; EP, which later appeared on the aforementioned &quot; Garage, Inc.&quot; album.

<doc id="163983" wikidata="Q11628198" url="?curid=163983" title="Takahiro Nishikawa">
<text>is a Japanese keyboardist, music producer, and businessman. He was a member of Dreams Come True from 1988 to 2002. While with the band, they released eleven studio albums and thirty-three singles. Nine of those albums and ten of the singles debuted at #1 on the Oricon charts.

While Nishikawa was a member of the band, Dreams Come True won two &quot;The Television&quot; Drama Academy Awards for theme songs, once in 1995 and again in 1999. After he left the band, he was arrested and convicted twice for possession of illegal stimulants, once in October 2002 and again in February 2006. He opened a bar in Sapporo in 2009, where he regularly holds events themed around his former band, including after-concert parties. 

Nishikawa is also known by the nickname . His younger sister, , is a model.

==Biography==
Takahiro Nishikawa was born 26 May 1964. He attended and graduated from Hokkaido Otofuke High School in Otofuke, Hokkaido.

In 1988, Nishikawa became a founding member of the band Dreams Come True as their keyboardist. Their first single, , was released in March 1989. Their first album, &quot;Dreams Come True&quot;, sold over one million copies. While with the band, they released eleven studio albums, nine of which debuted at #1 on the Oricon charts. In that same time period, they released 33 singles, and 10 of them debuted at #1 on the Oricon singles charts. As a band member, he acquired the nickname .

Nishikawa left the band in March 2002 due to differences in musical direction. He was arrested in October that year on suspicion of assaulting his sister-in-law (the charges were later dropped), and a urine test resulted in an additional charge for using illegal stimulants. He stated that he began using them due to a lack of sleep, purchasing them after being approached by a dealer at a club in Tokyo. He was sentenced to 1 year 6 months, but the sentence was suspended for three years. He was arrested a second time, in February 2006 following a traffic stop in which police found stimulants in his vehicle. He was convicted and sentenced to 1 year 6 months, and he was released from prison in 2007.

In 2009, Nishikawa opened a bar in Sapporo, where he regularly hosts during which songs by Dreams Come True are played. He puts up posters in the bar each time a new Dreams Come True album is released. When concerts are held in Sapporo, the band often have an after party at the bar, and admission is a ticket from seeing the band perform. These events draw not only locals but also tourists. Nishikawa sometimes works as a DJ in Sapporo, and participates in LGBT events.

Nishikawa has stated that he has no intention of re-entering the public stage. Historical footage and images of Dreams Come True while he was a member are often manipulated to not show him. However, he remains close with the members of Dreams Come True, and band member Masato Nakamura is supportive of Nishikawa returning to the band. He made an appearance and performed with Nakamura in July 2019 as part of the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary celebration, though Miwa Yoshida did not appear at this event.

Nishikawa has never been married.

<doc id="163987" wikidata="Q7973164" url="?curid=163987" title="Watching the Wildlife">
<text>&quot;Watching the Wildlife&quot; is the seventh and last single by English pop band Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Released on 23 February 1987, it is the most radio friendly of the three singles from &quot;Liverpool&quot; going for a Beatlesque approach with string orchestration and psychedelic guitar riffs.

It is also the only one of the three &quot;Liverpool&quot; singles not to have a CD single release at that time and the mix used on the 7&quot; vinyl single has never appeared on a UK-issued compact disc. The single only reached number 28 on the UK Singles Chart and #23 in Germany.

==Background==
Bassist Mark O&#x27;Toole explained that the song is &quot;basically a story of someone going through their life doing the things they normally do — like the girls putting out the washing and stuff like that.&quot; 

The 7&quot; packaging made reference to animals, with a panda and dolphin on the sleeve. The cassette single more references to sexual intercourse with the instrumental mix being dubbed &quot;The Condom Mix&quot; on the cassette single. The promotional condom that was to be distributed with each single would have stopped the single sales counting towards the UK charts as the official chart provider had introduced new rules to this effect, so the idea was abandoned. Promotional copies complete with the condom do exist, however.

==Critical reception==
Roger Morton of &quot;Record Mirror&quot; said of the single, &quot;The fact that you&#x27;re supposed to get a CONDOM with the cassette version of this could lead to irksome speculation about the title. So let&#x27;s just say that giving away prophylactics is a GOOD IDEA, and if this piece of swinging, brassy, orchestral bombast wasn&#x27;t all swollen up like an inflated Durex, it might have been too.&quot;

==Chart performance==
By the time &quot;Watching the Wildlife&quot; was released as a single, poor record sales and interest in the &quot;Liverpool&quot; album had all but waned. The single failed to break the Top 20 in Europe, only reaching number 28 on the UK Singles Chart, number 23 in Germany and number 24 in Ireland. &quot;Watching the Wildlife&quot; would prove to be the last single released by Frankie Goes to Hollywood as they disbanded shortly after its release, initiating a series of lawsuits by the record label ZTT over contract and royalty differences.

<text>is a Japanese music genre considered to resemble traditional Japanese music stylistically. Modern &quot;enka&quot;, however, is a relatively recent musical form which adopts a more traditional musical style in its vocalism than &quot;ryūkōka&quot; music, popular during the prewar years.

Modern &quot;enka&quot;, as developed in the postwar era, is a form of sentimental ballad music. Some of the first modern &quot;enka&quot; singers were Hachiro Kasuga, Michiya Mihashi, and Hideo Murata. The revival of &quot;enka&quot; in its modern form is said to date from 1969, when Keiko Fuji made her debut. The most famous male &quot;enka&quot; singers are Shinichi Mori and Kiyoshi Hikawa.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;enka&quot; was first used to refer to political texts set to music which were sung and distributed by opposition activists belonging to the Freedom and People&#x27;s Rights Movement during the Meiji period (1868–1912) as a means of bypassing government curbs on speeches of political dissent – and in this sense the word is derived from , meaning &quot;speech song&quot;.

Another theory holds that modern &quot;enka&quot; means , meaning &quot;performance song&quot;.

The genre called &quot;enka&quot; is also said to be an expedient classification for record labels as well as J-pop. For example, Harumi Miyako, who has been usually considered as an &quot;enka&quot; singer, said &quot;I don&#x27;t think that I sing &#x27;enka and &quot;In fact, there was no such term as &#x27;enka&#x27; when I debuted.&quot;

==Musical style==
Modern &quot;enka&quot;″s mainstream scale is called or &quot;Minor Scale without Four and Seven (&quot;fa&quot; and &quot;te&quot;)&quot;, and is a modified version of or &quot;Major Scale without Four and Seven (&quot;Fa&quot; and &quot;Si&quot;)&quot;, which came from an older Japanese scale, the . One of the earliest Japanese songs that was said to have partly used it is Rentarō Taki&#x27;s &quot;Kōjō no Tsuki&quot;, which was called in the Meiji period. The seventh- scale degree is not used in &quot;Kōjō no Tsuki&quot;, a song of B minor.

The music, based on the pentatonic scale, has some resemblance to blues. &quot;Enka&quot; lyrics are usually written similarly around the themes of love and loss, loneliness, enduring hardships, and persevering in the face of difficulties, even suicide or death. Although &quot;enka&quot; is a genre of &quot;kayōkyoku&quot;, it is considered to be more expressive and emotional, though there is no clear consensus on the matter.

Archetypal &quot;enka&quot; singers employ a style of melisma—where a single syllable of text is sung while moving between several different notes in succession—known as &quot;kobushi&quot;. &quot;Kobushi&quot; occurs when the pitch of the singer&#x27;s voice fluctuates irregularly within one scale degree: This compares with vibrato, which vibrates in a regular cycle. The &quot;kobushi&quot; technique is not limited to &quot;enka&quot;, as can be heard in the Italian song &quot;Santa Lucia.&quot; In the late 1930s and early &#x27;40s, the music of composer Masao Koga began to resemble Buddhist &quot;shomyo&quot;-chanting possibly because his record label asked him to produce music. Although Koga became a composer whose work is considered seminal to the creation of the genre, present-day &quot;enka&quot; is different from Koga&#x27;s primary music because the singing styles of many postwar singers were different from the &quot;kobushi&quot; of Koga&#x27;s musical note. Modern &quot;enka&quot; singer Takeshi Kitayama himself admitted in 2006, &quot;I was even confused because [Koga&#x27;s] musical note was different from that of an old singer.&quot;

&quot;Enka&quot; suggests a traditional, idealized, or romanticized aspect of Japanese culture and attitudes. &quot;Enka&quot; singers, predominantly women, usually perform in a kimono or in evening dress. Male &quot;enka&quot; performers tend to wear formal dress, or in some performances, traditional Japanese attire. Nods to traditional Japanese music are common in &quot;enka&quot;. The melodies of &quot;enka&quot; are fundamentally Western harmonies, and electronic instruments are used, such as synthesizers and electric lead guitar with plenty of distortion, but its musical instruments also include traditional Japanese instruments such as the &quot;shakuhachi&quot; and the &quot;shamisen.&quot;

==History==

===19th century–1920s: &quot;Sōshi&quot; enka and violin enka===

The political songs called &quot;enka&quot; in the Meiji period (1868–1912) are also called to distinguish it from modern &quot;enka&quot;. Street singers were called . The first &quot;enka&quot; song is said to be . The songs during this time include Otojiro Kawakami&#x27;s &quot;Oppekepe&quot;.

In the Taishō period (1912–26), &quot;enka-shi&quot; began to incorporate the violin, thus their songs were called &quot;violin enka.&quot; An &quot;enka-shi&quot; of the period was , who in turn taught Haruo Oka.

In present-day Japan, Road Traffic Law regulates the appearance of street performers. However, Japanese performers such as have still sung &quot;enka&quot; from the Taishō period. When the 1995 earthquake struck, Soul Flower Mononoke Summit, a musical project of the rock band Soul Flower Union, played &quot;sōshi enka&quot; to help buoy the spirits of disaster victims.

===1920s–1940s: Era of &quot;ryūkōka&quot;===
In the early Shōwa period in the late 1920s, record companies produced &quot;ryūkōka&quot; in place of &quot;enka-shi&quot;. &quot;Enka-shi&quot; began to use guitar and were dubbed . Haruo Oka debuted with the 1939 song on the Japanese record label King Records. However, the term &quot;enka&quot; became uncommon in the postwar years.

===Late 1940s–1954: The arrival of new singers===

As jazz became popular in early postwar Japan, Japanese singer Hibari Misora released her debut song &quot;Kappa boogie-woogie&quot; on Nippon Columbia in 1949 at the age of only 12. She went on to sing jazz songs throughout the 1950s and 1960s. She later did many &quot;enka&quot; songs in the 60s and 70s.

In 1948, Hachiro Kasuga won King Records&#x27; first talent contest. He joined the record label the next year where Haruo Oka was his senior. His debut single was released in 1952. The kabuki-style song was originally made for Oka, but was sung by Kasuga, and in 1954, &quot;Otomi-san&quot; became a very popular hit in Japan. Kasuga took part in the NHK &quot;Kōhaku Uta Gassen&quot; for the first time with &quot;Otomi-san&quot; that year. The song&#x27;s composer, Masanobu Tokuchi, was born on Okinawa Island and grew up in Amami and became an important figure for introducing the Ryukyu Islands&#x27; music into the Japanese mainstream.

===1955–1959: Early history of modern &quot;enka&quot;===

Although &quot;Otomi-san&quot; was popular, Kasuga himself was not completely satisfied with it and recorded the song by Toru Funamura. The song was released in 1955 and was later regarded as a true &quot;enka&quot; song. The song, ironically, was also influenced by tango music&#x27;s rhythm because Funamura felt that tango seemed similar to &quot;enka&quot; in its local color. &quot;Wakare no Ippon-sugi&quot; was later covered by singers as diverse as Michiya Mihashi, Hideo Murata, Keiko Fuji, Hibari Misora, Saburō Kitajima, Takashi Hosokawa, and Hiroshi Itsuki. Kasuga was later called the first &quot;enka&quot; singer.

Michiya Mihashi, who originally sang Japanese folk music (&quot;min&#x27;yō&quot;) and learned &quot;tsugaru-jamisen&quot;, released his debut single &quot;Sake no Nigasa yo&quot; as a recording singer in 1954. Mihashi&#x27;s &quot;Onna Sendō Uta&quot; was a hit in 1955. Funamura&#x27;s friend Kimio Takano, the lyricist of &quot;Wakare no Ippon-sugi&quot;, died in 1956 at the age of 26. Hibari Misora&#x27;s music turned to &quot;enka&quot; when she was no longer regarded as a teen idol.

Around the postwar period, &quot;rōkyoku&quot; (or &quot;naniwa-bushi&quot;), famous during the war, declined in popularity mainly because their speaking lengths were considered too long. &quot;Enka&quot;, on the other hand, which became popular around that time, was said to be a shortened version of &quot;rōkyoku&quot; because several &quot;enka&quot; singers such as Hideo Murata and Haruo Minami were originally &quot;rōkyoku&quot; singers and &quot;enka&quot; has many themes in common with the genre. One notable &quot;rōkyoku&quot; singer who had an influence on &quot;enka&quot; was Kumoemon Tochuken, whose student&#x27;s pupil was Murata. Minami debuted on Teichiku Records in 1957 and Murata on Nippon Columbia in 1958. Murata covered the song , composed by Masao Koga. Haruo Minami was known for wearing a kimono, which was at the time considered an unusual style for a male singer.

=== 1960s–1970s: Commercial success ===

In the early 1960s, rockabilly influenced by Elvis Presley began to gain popularity. Kyu Sakamoto, who came from Japanese rockabilly, joined Japanese popular music. However, many Japanese music critics complained about rockabilly, and Hideo Murata&#x27;s 1961 &quot;pure Japanese style&quot;-like song &quot;Ōsho&quot;, composed by Toru Funamura, became a million-selling single in Japan. When Kyu Sakamoto took part in the Kōhaku Uta Gassen for the first time with the song &quot;Ue o Muite Arukō&quot; (aka &quot;Sukiyaki&quot;) in 1961, Hideo Murata also made his debut with the song &quot;Ōsho&quot; at the same show.

Young &quot;enka&quot; singer Yukio Hashi appeared in 1960, Saburō Kitajima in 1962 and Harumi Miyako in 1964. Sachiko Kobayashi debuted with the 1964 single at the age of only 10. The most well-known and beloved performer of &quot;enka&quot; is Hibari Misora (1937–1989), known as the &quot;Queen of &quot;Enka&quot;&quot; and &quot;Queen of Shōwa&quot; for the period in which she lived and was celebrated. Misora&#x27;s song &quot;Yawara&quot;, composed by Masao Koga, won the grand prix award at the 1965 Japan Record Award. Masaru Matsuyama also made his debut in 1965, but was not able to achieve commercial success and changed his stage name to Hiroshi Itsuki in 1971.

Mina Aoe appeared with the single in 1966, pioneering the &quot;&quot;enka&quot;-blues&quot; genre. Shinichi Mori debuted with the 1966 single . His 1969 song topped the Japanese Oricon single charts for five weeks and sold over one million copies. Keiko Fuji came out with the 1969 single at the age of 18. The term &quot;enka&quot; which had not been used in the postwar era, was revived by her performance.

Keiko Fuji&#x27;s 1970 song &quot;Keiko no Yume wa Yoru Hiraku&quot; won the mass popularity award of the 12th Japan Record Awards and the grand prix award of the first Japan Music Awards. That year, she also took part in the 21st &quot;Kōhaku Uta Gassen&quot; with the song. Her 1970 album established a record-breaking consecutive number-one record to top the Oricon charts for 20 &quot;consecutive&quot; weeks. It is a record that still stands.

The best-selling &quot;enka&quot; after the Oricon charts began in 1968 is Shiro Miya and Pinkara Trio&#x27;s 1972 &quot;Onna no Michi.&quot; The song topped the Japanese Oricon single charts for 16 consecutive weeks and sold over 3.25 million copies, to become the second best-selling single in Japan behind &quot;Oyoge! Taiyaki-kun.&quot;

Hiroshi Itsuki&#x27;s song &quot;Yozora&quot; won the grand prix award at the 15th Japan Record Awards in 1973. Shinichi Mori released the single &quot;Erimo Misaki&quot; in 1974. Although the song was composed by non-&quot;enka&quot; musician Takuro Yoshida, &quot;Erimo Misaki&quot; won the grand prix at the 16th Japan Record Awards that year. Harumi Miyako&#x27;s song &quot;Kita no Yado kara&quot; also won the grand prix at the 18th Japan Record Awards in 1976. New &quot;enka&quot; singers, who debuted in the &#x27;70s, include Sayuri Ishikawa and Takashi Hosokawa who were both Michiya Mihashi&#x27;s pupils.

Masao Koga died in 1978, after a career of composing about 5,000 songs. Toru Funamura became self-employed in 1978, beginning live performances and returning to the original position for his old friend Kimio Takano. Keiko Fuji announced her retirement in 1979 and went to the United States.

=== 1980s–1990s: Losing definition and decline ===

Takashi Hosokawa&#x27;s song &quot;Kita Sakaba&quot; won the grand prix at the 24th Japan Record Awards in 1982. He covered Naomi Chiaki&#x27;s originally song &quot;Yagiri no Watashi&quot; next year. It was also won the grand prix at the following Japan Record Awards. The total sales of Michiya Mihashi&#x27;s work surpassed 100 million records in 1983, making him the first artist to achieve that in Japan.

On June 11, 1986, Sanae Jōnouchi, a member of idol group Onyanko Club, released the &quot;enka&quot; single &quot;Ajisai Bashi&quot;, written by Yasushi Akimoto. The single debuted at No. 1 on the Oricon weekly single charts. Ikuzo Yoshi&#x27;s 1986 single &quot;Yukiguni&quot; became the Oricon&#x27;s 300th number-one single in 1987.

Other new &quot;enka&quot; singers around that time included Fuyumi Sakamoto and Ayako Fuji. Hibari Misora, at the age of 50, released the single &quot;Midaregami&quot; on December 10, 1987. &quot;Midaregami&quot; reached the No. 9 position on the Oricon weekly charts. Yasushi Akimoto wrote the lyrics of her 1989 single &quot;Kawa no Nagare no Yō ni&quot;. However, she died in 1989 and the &quot;enka&quot; range expanded into the genre &quot;kayōkyoku&quot; while the genre &quot;kayōkyoku&quot; was vanishing.

Hachiro Kasuga died in 1991. As &quot;enka&quot;&#x27;s traditional themes were no longer appreciated among younger Japanese and Western-style J-pop music became more popular, &quot;enka&quot; sales declined. However, the genre still had many adherents. Besides TV programs, &quot;enka&quot; could be heard in many restaurants, drinking establishments, karaoke bars and cafes. On the other hand, &quot;bright&quot; &quot;enka&quot; singer Yoshimi Tendo, who was ignored when the &quot;dark&quot; &quot;enka&quot; songs like Keiko Fuji&#x27;s song &quot;Keiko no Yume wa Yoru Hiraku&quot; were popular, took part in the &quot;Kōhaku Uta Gassen&quot; for the first time in 1993. Other new &quot;enka&quot; singers such as Toshimi Tagawa and Fuyumi Sakamoto were also appearing on TV &quot;enka&quot; programs which kept &quot;enka&quot; alive. Taiwanese diva Teresa Teng was also singing in Japanese and covering &quot;enka&quot; songs from the 70s until she died in 1995 at the age of 42.

===2000s: Musical hybridity===
&quot;Enka&quot;&#x27;s popularity among younger Japanese, however, increased in the first decade of the 21st century. Kiyoshi Hikawa debuted on Nippon Columbia in 2000 with the single &quot;Hakone Hachiri no Hanjirō&quot;, which became a smash hit. The early solo releases of then-Morning Musume member Yuko Nakazawa were also &quot;enka&quot;. In contrast, Nana Mizuki, who learned &quot;enka&quot; as a child, became a voice actress and also appeared as a singer on King Records in 2000.

On August 25, 2004, Johnny &amp; Associates&#x27; group Kanjani Eight debuted with the Kansai-limited release of &quot;Naniwa Iroha Bushi&quot; under the Teichiku Records. The song was based on &quot;Kawachi ondo&quot; and featured rap. The song was a hit and reached No. 8 on the Oricon weekly singles chart on the strength of Kansai sales alone. Then, on September 22, 2004, &quot;Naniwa Iroha Bushi&quot; was released nationwide and re-debuted on the Oricon weekly singles charts at the No. 1 spot, becoming the first &quot;enka&quot; single to reach the No. 1 in seventeen years since Yujiro Ishihara&#x27;s 1987 single &quot;Kita no Tabibito&quot; according to Oricon.

Hikawa also released the single &quot;Hatsukoi Ressha&quot; on February 9, 2005, which debuted at the No. 1 position on the Oricon charts, Hikawa&#x27;s first number-one single on the Oricon weekly charts. Older female singer Junko Akimoto also debuted on King Records, releasing her first single &quot;Madison-gun no Koi&quot; on July 21, 2005. However, her musical style was &#x27;70s &quot;kayōkyoku&quot; style.

Veteran &quot;enka&quot; singer Hiroshi Itsuki, at 58, released the single &quot;Takasebune&quot; on April 19, 2006, becoming his first Top 10 single in 22 years since 1984&#x27;s &quot;Nagaragawa Enka.&quot; It debuted at the number-nine position on the Oricon charts.

Hikawa&#x27;s song &quot;Ikken&quot; won the grand prix at the 48th Japan Record Awards on December 30, 2006. Kanjani Eight was transferred to the pop/rock record label Imperial Records, the sub-label of Teichiku Records in 2007. In the same year, 80s superstar Akina Nakamori paid her respect to &quot;enka&quot; music by releasing an album—full of light &quot;enka&quot; songs.

Junko Akimoto released the single &quot;Ai no Mama de…&quot; on January 23, 2008, reaching the top of the Oricon weekly single charts in January 2009, making her, at the age of 61, the oldest solo singer to top the charts. That same year, Hikawa released two consecutive number-one singles — &quot;Ryōkyoku Ichidai&quot; and &quot;Tokimeki no Rumba&quot; — on the Oricon weekly charts. Fuyumi Sakamoto&#x27;s 2009 song &quot;Asia no Kaizoku&quot;, composed by Ayumi Nakamura, was an &quot;enka&quot; song featuring rock music. Sakamoto said, &quot;If Ayumi sings the song, it&#x27;s a rock song. If I sing the song, however, it&#x27;s an &quot;enka&quot; song.&quot;

===2010s===
On January 1, 2010, 73-year-old Saburō Kitajima released the single , emerging at No. 10 on the Oricon weekly charts, making him the first solo artist to reach the Top 10 in his 70s. After Fuyumi Sakamoto appeared on Masahiro Nakai&#x27;s TV program &quot;Nakai Masahiro no Kinyōbi no Sumatachi e&quot; on March 19, 2010, her double A-side single &quot;Mata Kimi ni Koi Shiteru/Asia no Kaizoku&quot; reached the Top 10 for the first time, ranked at No. 9 on the Oricon charts. The single became her first Top 10 single in 21 years since &quot;Otoko no Jōwa&quot;, which had ranked in the Top 10 on the Oricon charts in 1989.

==International popularity==
&quot;Enka&quot; has had a strong influence on music in Taiwan, which was once a Japanese colony. 
The first non-Japanese singer of &quot;enka&quot; was Sarbjit Singh Chadha from India. His &quot;enka&quot; album was released in 1975 and became a success in Japan, selling 150,000 copies. He went back to India a few years later, but returned to Japan in 2008.

In 2002, Yolanda Tasico became the first Filipino &quot;enka&quot; singer, going to Japan with her singles &quot;Shiawase ni Narō&quot;, &quot;Nagai Aida&quot;, and many others.

In the United States, while &quot;enka&quot; remains popular among a section of the (typically older) Japanese-American population, &quot;enka&quot; has many fans among non-Japanese. There are some &quot;enka&quot; orchestras and performers active in the country, such as the San Jose Chidori Band, which occasionally performs at O-Bon festivals in the summer.

<text>John Brumwell Mayall (29 November 1933 – 22 July 2024) was an English blues and rock musician, songwriter and producer. In the 1960s, he formed John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers, a band that has counted among its members some of the most famous blues and blues rock musicians of all-time. A singer, guitarist, harmonica player, and keyboardist, he had a career that spanned nearly seven decades, remaining an active musician until his death aged 90. Mayall has often been referred to as the &quot;godfather of the British blues&quot;, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the musical influence category in 2024.

==Early life and education ==

Born in Macclesfield, Cheshire, on 29 November 1933, John Brumwell Mayall grew up in Cheadle Hulme. He was the son of Murray Mayall, a guitarist who played in local pubs. 

From an early age he was drawn to the sounds of American blues players such as Lead Belly, Albert Ammons, Pinetop Smith, and Eddie Lang, and taught himself to play the piano, guitar, and harmonica.

==Career==

===Starting out as a musician===
Mayall was sent to Korea as part of his national service, and during a period of leave bought his first electric guitar in Japan. Back in England, he enrolled at Manchester College of Art and started playing with a semi-professional band, the Powerhouse Four. After graduation, he obtained a job as an art designer, but continued to play with local musicians. In 1963, he opted for a full-time musical career and moved to London. His previous craft would be put to good use in the designing of covers for many of his coming albums.

===Early 1960s===
In 1956, with college fellow Peter Ward, Mayall founded the Powerhouse Four, which consisted of the two men and other local musicians with whom they played at local dances. In 1962 Mayall became a member of the Blues Syndicate. The band was formed by trumpeter John Rowlands and alto saxophonist Jack Massarik, who had seen the Alexis Korner band at a Manchester club and wanted to try a similar blend of jazz and blues. It also included rhythm guitarist Ray Cummings and drummer Hughie Flint, whom Mayall already knew. In 1962 John and his band were frequent and popular artists at all-night R&amp;B sessions at the Twisted Wheel cellar club in central Manchester. Alexis Korner persuaded Mayall to opt for a full-time musical career and move to London, where Korner introduced him to many other musicians and helped them to find gigs.

In late 1963, with his band, which was now called the Bluesbreakers, Mayall started playing at the Marquee Club. The line-up was Mayall, Ward, John McVie on bass and guitarist Bernie Watson, formerly of Cyril Davies and the R&amp;B All-Stars. The next spring Mayall obtained his first recording date with producer Ian Samwell. The band, with Martin Hart at the drums, recorded two tracks: &quot;Crawling Up a Hill&quot; and &quot;Mr. James&quot;. Shortly after, Hughie Flint replaced Hart and Roger Dean took the guitar from Bernie Watson. This line-up backed John Lee Hooker on his British tour in 1964.

Mayall was offered a recording contract by Decca records and, on 7 December 1964, a live performance of the band was recorded at the Klooks Kleek. A later studio-recorded single, &quot;Crocodile Walk&quot;, was released along with the album, but both failed to achieve any success and the contract was terminated.

In April 1965, former Yardbirds guitarist Eric Clapton replaced Roger Dean and John Mayall&#x27;s career entered a decisive phase.

===Mid-1960s through 1971===
====Eric Clapton as guitarist, 1965–1966====
In 1965, with Eric Clapton as their new guitar player, the Bluesbreakers began attracting considerable attention. That summer the band cut a couple of tracks for a single, &quot;I&#x27;m Your Witchdoctor&quot; b/w &quot;Telephone Blues&quot; (released in October). In August, however, Clapton left for a jaunt to Greece with a bunch of relative musical amateurs calling themselves the &#x27;Glands&#x27;. John Weider, John Slaughter, and Geoff Krivit attempted to fill in as Bluesbreaker guitarist but, finally, Peter Green took charge. John McVie was dismissed, and during the next few months Jack Bruce, from the Graham Bond Organisation, played bass.

In November 1965, Clapton returned, and Green departed as Mayall had guaranteed Clapton his spot back in the Bluesbreakers whenever he tired of the Glands. McVie was allowed back, and Bruce left to join Manfred Mann, but not before a live date by the Mayall-Clapton-Bruce-Flint line-up was recorded on Mayall&#x27;s two-track tape recorder at London&#x27;s The Flamingo Club in November. The rough recording provided tracks that later appeared on the 1969 compilation &quot;Looking Back&quot; and the 1977 &quot;Primal Solos&quot;. The same line-up also entered the studio to record a planned single, &quot;On Top of the World&quot;, which was not released at that time. Mayall and Clapton cut a couple of tracks without the others (although some sources give this as occurring back in the summer): &quot;Lonely Years&quot; b/w &quot;Bernard Jenkins&quot; was released as a single the next August on producer Mike Vernon&#x27;s Purdah Records label (both tracks appeared again two decades later in Clapton&#x27;s &quot;Crossroads&quot; box set). In a November 1965 session, blues pianist-singer Champion Jack Dupree (originally from New Orleans but in the 1960s living in Europe) got Mayall and Clapton to play on a few tracks.

In April 1966, the Bluesbreakers returned to Decca Studios to record a second LP with producer Vernon. The sessions, with horn arrangements for some tracks (John Almond on baritone sax, Alan Skidmore on tenor sax, and Dennis Healey on trumpet), lasted just three days. &quot;Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton&quot; was released in the UK on 22 July 1966. Several of the 12 tracks were covers of pure Chicago blues (side 1 kicking off with Otis Rush&#x27;s &quot;All Your Love&quot; and Freddy King&#x27;s hit instrumental &quot;Hide Away&quot; [here spelled without a space as &quot;Hideaway&quot;]); Mayall wrote or arranged five (such as &quot;Double Crossing Time&quot;, a slow blues with a solo by co-writer Clapton); and Clapton debuted as lead vocalist, and began his practice of paying tribute to Robert Johnson, with &quot;Ramblin&#x27; on My Mind&quot;. The album was Mayall&#x27;s commercial breakthrough, rising to No. 6 on the UK Albums Chart, and has since gained classic status, largely for the audacious aggressiveness and molten fluidity of Clapton&#x27;s guitar playing. &quot;It&#x27;s Eric Clapton who steals the limelight,&quot; reported music mag &quot;Beat Instrumental&quot;, adding with unintended understatement, &quot;and no doubt several copies of the album will be sold on the strength of his name.&quot;

In the meantime, on 11 June, the formation of Cream—Clapton, bassist Jack Bruce, and drummer Ginger Baker—had been revealed in the music press, much to the embarrassment of Clapton, who had not said anything about this to Mayall. (After a May Bluesbreakers gig at which Baker had sat in, he and Clapton had first discussed forming their own band, and surreptitious rehearsal jams with Bruce soon commenced.) Clapton&#x27;s last scheduled gig with the Bluesbreakers was 17 July in Bexley, south-east of London; Cream made a warmup club debut 29 July in Manchester and its &quot;official&quot; live debut two days later at the Sixth National Jazz and Blues Festival, Windsor.

====Peter Green as guitarist, 1966–1967====
Mayall had to replace Clapton, and he succeeded in persuading Peter Green to come back. During the following year, with Green on guitar and various other sidemen, some 40 tracks were recorded. The album &quot;A Hard Road&quot; was released in February 1967. In early 1967, Mayall released an EP recorded with American blues harpist Paul Butterfield.

But Peter Green gave notice and soon started his own project, Peter Green&#x27;s Fleetwood Mac, which eventually was to include all three of Mayall&#x27;s Bluesbreakers at this time: Green, McVie, and drummer Mick Fleetwood, who was a Bluesbreaker for only a few weeks. Two live albums, &quot;Live in 1967&quot; Volumes I and II, featuring this line-up were released on Forty Below Records in 2015 and 2016.

====Mick Taylor as guitarist, 1967–1969====
Mayall&#x27;s first choice to replace Green was 18-year-old David O&#x27;List, guitarist from The Attack. O&#x27;List declined, however, and went on to form the Nice with organist Keith Emerson. Through both a &quot;musicians wanted&quot; ad in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; on 10 June and his own search, Mayall found three other potential guitarists for his Bluesbreakers, a musician named Terry Edmonds, John Moorshead, and 18-year-old Mick Taylor. The last made the band quickly, but Mayall also decided to hire Edmonds as a rhythm guitarist for a few days.

In the meantime, on a single day in May 1967, Mayall had assembled a studio album to showcase his own abilities. Former Artwoods drummer Keef Hartley appeared on only half of the tracks, and everything else was played by Mayall. The album was released in November titled &quot;The Blues Alone&quot;.

A six-piece line-up—consisting of Mayall, Mick Taylor as lead guitarist, John McVie still on bass, Hughie Flint or Hartley on drums, and Rip Kant and Chris Mercer on saxophones—recorded the album &quot;Crusade&quot; on 11 and 12 July 1967. These Bluesbreakers spent most of the year touring abroad, and Mayall taped the shows on a portable recorder. At the end of the tour, he had over sixty hours of tapes, which he edited into an album in two volumes: &quot;Diary of a Band, Vols. 1 &amp; 2&quot;, released in February 1968. Meanwhile, a few line-up changes had occurred: McVie had departed and was replaced by Paul Williams, who himself soon quit to join Alan Price and was replaced by Keith Tillman; Dick Heckstall-Smith had taken the sax spot.

Following a US tour, there were more line-up changes, starting with the troublesome bass position. First Mayall replaced bassist Tillman with 15-year-old Andy Fraser. Within six weeks, though, Fraser left to join Free and was replaced by Tony Reeves, previously a member of the New Jazz Orchestra. Hartley was required to leave, and he was replaced by New Jazz Orchestra drummer Jon Hiseman (who had also played with the Graham Bond Organisation). Henry Lowther, who played violin and cornet, joined in February 1968. Two months later the Bluesbreakers recorded &quot;Bare Wires&quot;, co-produced by Mayall and Mike Vernon, which came up to UK No. 6.

Hiseman, Reeves, and Heckstall-Smith then moved on to form Colosseum. The Mayall line-up retained Mick Taylor and added drummer Colin Allen (formerly of Zoot Money&#x27;s Big Roll Band / Dantalian&#x27;s Chariot, and Georgie Fame) and a young bassist named Stephen Thompson. In August 1968 the new quartet recorded &quot;Blues from Laurel Canyon&quot;.

On 13 June 1969, after nearly two years with Mayall, Taylor left and joined the Rolling Stones.

====Mark-Almond period, 1969–1970====

Chas Crane filled in briefly on guitar. Drummer Allen departed to join Stone the Crows. This left as the only holdover bassist Thompson who would also eventually join Stone the Crows.

Mayall tried a new format with lower volume, acoustic instruments, and no drummer. He recruited acoustic fingerstyle guitarist Jon Mark and flautist-saxophonist Johnny Almond. Mark was best known as Marianne Faithfull&#x27;s accompanist for three years and for having been a member of the band Sweet Thursday (which included pianist Nicky Hopkins and future Cat Stevens collaborator Alun Davies, also a guitarist). Almond had played with Zoot Money and Alan Price and was no stranger to Mayall&#x27;s music—he had played baritone sax on four cuts of &quot;Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton&quot; and some of &quot;A Hard Road&quot;. This new band was markedly different from previous Mayall projects, and its making is well documented both on the 1999 double CD &quot;The Masters&quot; and on the 2004 DVD &quot;The Godfather of British Blues/The Turning Point&quot;.

Along with the big change in sound, Mayall decided on a big change in scenery: a move to Los Angeles. The new band made its US debut at the Newport Jazz Festival on 5 July, whilst the performance of 12 July at the Fillmore East provided the tracks for the live album &quot;The Turning Point&quot;. A studio album, &quot;Empty Rooms&quot;, was recorded with the same personnel, with Mayall&#x27;s next bassist, former Canned Heat member Larry Taylor, playing bass in a duet with Thompson on &quot;To a Princess&quot;.

====Harvey Mandel as guitarist, 1970–1971====
Mayall continued the experiment of formations without drummers on two more albums, although he took on a new electric blues-rock-R&amp;B band in guitarist Harvey Mandel and bassist Larry Taylor, both plucked from Canned Heat, and wailing violinist Don &quot;Sugarcane&quot; Harris, lately of the Johnny Otis Show and formerly with The Mothers of Invention. On &quot;USA Union&quot; (recorded in Los Angeles, 27–28 July 1970), though, Mandel was compelled to make do without his remarkable sustain and usage of feedback as musical, even melodic, technique; and on &quot;Memories&quot; the band was stripped down to a trio with Taylor and Ventures guitarist Gerry McGee.

In November 1970, Mayall launched a recording project involving many of the most notable musicians with whom he had played during the previous several years. The double album &quot;Back to the Roots&quot; features Clapton, Mick Taylor, Gerry McGee and Harvey Mandel on guitar; Sugarcane Harris on violin; Almond on woodwinds; Thompson and Larry Taylor on bass; and Hartley on drums. Paul Lagos was with Sugarcane and ended up drumming on five. Mayall wrote all the songs and sang all the vocals, as usual by now, plus played harmonica, guitar, keyboards, drums, and percussion. The London sessions took place in January 1971 and as such represent some of Clapton&#x27;s last work before Derek and the Dominos attempted &quot;Layla&quot; follow-up sessions and band disintegration that spring.

&quot;Back to the Roots&quot; did not promote new names, and &quot;USA Union&quot; and &quot;Memories&quot; had been recorded with American musicians. Mayall had exhausted his catalytic role on the British blues-rock scene and was living in Los Angeles. Yet, the list of musicians who benefited from association with him, starting with ruling the London blues scene, remains impressive.

===1970s===

By the start of the 1970s, Mayall had relocated to the United States where he spent most of the next 15 years, recording with local musicians for various labels. In August 1971, Mayall produced a jazz-oriented session for bluesman Albert King and a few months later took on tour the musicians present in the studio.

A live album &quot;Jazz Blues Fusion&quot; was released in the following year, with Mayall on harmonica, guitar and piano, Blue Mitchell on trumpet, Clifford Solomon and Ernie Watts on saxophones, Larry Taylor on bass, Ron Selico on drums and Freddy Robinson on guitar. A few personnel changes are noted at the release of a similar album in 1973, the live &quot;Moving On&quot;.

In 1974, Mayall recorded &quot;The Latest Edition&quot;, produced by Tom Wilson for the Polydor label. The group featured jazz saxophonist Red Holloway, drummer Soko Richardson, bassist Larry Taylor, and two guitarists, Randy Resnick and Hightide Harris. The band toured Europe and Asia that year.
During the next decade Mayall continued shifting musicians and switching labels and released a score of albums. Tom Wilson, Don Nix and Allen Toussaint occasionally served as producers. At this stage of his career most of Mayall&#x27;s music was rather different from electric blues played by rock musicians, incorporating jazz, funk or pop elements and even adding female vocals. A notable exception is &quot;The Last of the British Blues&quot; (1978), a live album excused apparently by its title for the brief return to this type of music.

===Return of the Bluesbreakers===

In 1982, Mayall was reunited with Mick Taylor, John McVie and Colin Allen, three musicians of his 1960s line-ups, for a two-year world tour from which a live album would emerge a decade later.

In 1984, Mayall restored the name Bluesbreakers for a line-up comprising the two lead guitars of Walter Trout and Coco Montoya, bassist Bobby Haynes and drummer Joe Yuele. In the early 1990s, most of the excitement was already spent and Buddy Whittington became the sole lead guitarist in a formation which included then organist Tom Canning.

===2000s===
On the occasion of the 40th year of his career, Mayall invited fellow musicians for the recording of a celebratory album. &quot;Along for the Ride&quot; appeared in 2001, credited to John Mayall and Friends with twenty names listed on the cover, including some Bluesbreakers, old and new, and also Gary Moore, Jonny Lang, Steve Cropper, Steve Miller, Otis Rush, Billy Gibbons, Greg Rzab, Chris Rea, Jeff Healey and Shannon Curfman.

To celebrate his 70th birthday, Mayall reunited with special guests Eric Clapton, Mick Taylor and Chris Barber during a fundraiser show. This &quot;Unite for UNICEF&quot; concert took place on 19 July 2003 at the Liverpool Arena, and was captured on film for a DVD release.

In November 2008, Mayall announced on his website he was disbanding the Bluesbreakers, to cut back on his heavy workload and give himself freedom to work with other musicians. Three months later a solo world tour was announced, with Rocky Athas on guitar, Greg Rzab on bass, and Jay Davenport on drums. Tom Canning, on organ, joined the band for the tour which started in March 2009. An album was released in September 2009. Since then, Mayall has continued to tour with the same backing band, minus Canning, who left due to other priorities.

In 2015, Dinu Logos published &quot;John Mayall: The Blues Crusader&quot;, the first biography of Mayall to include exhaustive details of every band he put together and every recording he made. In 2018, Mayall made a new addition to his band; his first female lead guitarist, Carolyn Wonderland.

===Forty Below Records period===

In 2013, Mayall signed with producer Eric Corne&#x27;s label, Forty Below Records. The two have produced four studio albums together, &quot;A Special Life&quot; featuring accordionist C. J. Chenier, &quot;Find a Way to Care&quot;, &quot;Talk About That&quot; featuring Joe Walsh and &quot;Nobody Told Me&quot;. Corne also re-mastered some live recordings from 1967 featuring Peter Green, John McVie and Mick Fleetwood released as &quot;Live in 1967&quot; in 3 volumes. In 2016, Mayall was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame.

Mayall&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Blues From Laurel Canyon: My Life As A Bluesman&quot;, co-written with author Joel McIver, was published by Omnibus Press in August 2019.

==Personal life==
Mayall began living in the U.S. part time in the late 1960s, living there full time by the early 1970s. A brush fire destroyed his house in Laurel Canyon in 1979. Mayall lost 2,000 hours of video-taped movies, 16th century antiques, a pornography collection dating from the 1800s and his diaries written over 25 years.

Mayall was married twice and had six children and six grandchildren. His second wife, Maggie Mayall, is an American blues performer; since the early 1980s, she has taken part in the management of her husband&#x27;s career. They married in 1982, and divorced in 2011.

Mayall died at his home in California on 22 July 2024, at the age of 90. He was interred at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

==Honours and recognition ==
Mayall was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2005 Birthday Honours.

Mayall was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the musical influence category in 2024.

He is often referred to as the &quot;godfather of the British blues&quot;.

<text>Stray Cats are an American rockabilly band formed in 1979 by guitarist and vocalist Brian Setzer, double bassist Lee Rocker, and drummer Slim Jim Phantom in the Long Island town of Massapequa, New York. The group had numerous hit singles in the UK, Australia, Canada, and the U.S. including &quot;Stray Cat Strut&quot;, &quot;(She&#x27;s) Sexy + 17&quot;, &quot;Look at That Cadillac&quot;, &quot;I Won&#x27;t Stand in Your Way&quot;, &quot;Bring It Back Again&quot;, and &quot;Rock This Town&quot;, which the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has listed as one of the songs that shaped rock and roll.

==History==
===Formation and move to UK===

The band first appeared in the New York area in the middle of 1979 performing under a number of names including the Tomcats, the Teds, and Bryan and the Tom Cats. According to Brian Setzer (singer/songwriter and guitarist), they changed names to fool club owners (who would not hire the same band for consecutive nights), but kept the &quot;Cats&quot; moniker in their various names so the audience would know they were the same band.&lt;br&gt;

Setzer joined up with Slim Jim Phantom (drums) and they soon added Phantom&#x27;s schoolmate and friend Lee Rocker (stand-up bass); all three of them came from the same neighborhood in Massapequa and were interested in punk and rockabilly music. &lt;br&gt;

Since 1983, they have used only &quot;Stray Cats&quot; as their name. The band name &quot;Stray Cats&quot; had appeared in the 1973 rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll film &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot; and its 1974 sequel &quot;Stardust&quot;. They also went to many concerts and enjoyed the punk scene. They met the Clash and they used to see Siouxsie and the Banshees, Charlie Harper and the UK Subs.

The group, whose style was based upon the sounds of Sun Records artists and other artists from the 1950s, was heavily influenced by Eddie Cochran, Carl Perkins, Gene Vincent, and Bill Haley &amp; His Comets. The Stray Cats quickly developed a large following in the New York music scene playing at CBGB and Max&#x27;s Kansas City as well as venues on Long Island. When the Cats heard a rumor that there was a revival of the 1950s Teddy Boy youth subculture in England, the band moved to the UK. They spearheaded the nascent rockabilly revival, blending the 1950s Sun Studio sound with modern punk musical elements. In terms of visual style, the Stray Cats also blended elements of 1950 rockabilly clothes, such as wearing drape jackets, brothel creepers, and western shirts, with punk clothes, such as tight black zipper trousers and modern versions of 1950s hair styles.

In the middle of 1980, the band found themselves being courted by record labels including Virgin Records, Stiff Records, and Arista Records. Word quickly spread and soon members of The Rolling Stones, The Who, and Led Zeppelin were at their shows. &lt;br&gt; After a gig in London, Stray Cats met musician and producer Dave Edmunds, well known as a roots rock enthusiast for his work with Rockpile and as a solo artist. Edmunds offered to work with the group, and they entered the studio to record their self-titled debut album, &quot;Stray Cats&quot;, released in Britain in 1981 on Arista Records. In addition to having three hits that year with &quot;Runaway Boys&quot;, &quot;Rock This Town&quot;, and &quot;Stray Cat Strut&quot;, they also performed on the eighth day of the Montreux Jazz Festival. The UK follow-up to &quot;Stray Cats&quot;, &quot;Gonna Ball&quot;, was not as well-received, providing no hits. Yet the combined sales of their first two albums were enough to convince EMI America to compile the best tracks from the two UK albums and issue an album (&quot;Built for Speed&quot;) in the U.S. in 1982. The record went on to sell a million copies (Platinum) in the US and Canada and was the no. 2 record on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts for 15 weeks.

In 1983, the Stray Cats began recording their third (second U.S.) studio album &quot;Rant N&#x27; Rave with the Stray Cats&quot;. Unlike their previous studio albums, half the album was recorded in London with the rest recorded in New York. Released in August 1983, critics generally viewed &quot;Rant N&#x27; Rave&quot; favorably, citing the band&#x27;s tributes to 1950s rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll legends such as Gene Vincent and Bo Diddley. Commercially, &quot;Rant N&#x27; Rave&quot; failed to achieve the success of &quot;Built for Speed&quot;, although it produced the top-ten hit &quot;(She&#x27;s) Sexy + 17&quot;, and top-forty hit &quot;I Won&#x27;t Stand in Your Way&quot; featuring the doo-wop group 14 Karat Soul.

===Breakup and reunions===
Musical and personal conflicts began to emerge in the ways that the individual members handled their new-found success; Phantom married actress Britt Ekland, while Setzer made guest appearances with stars like Bob Dylan and Stevie Nicks and became the concert guitarist for Robert Plant&#x27;s Honeydrippers side project. In late 1984, the band added former BMT&#x27;s guitarist and Long Island native Tommy Byrnes on second guitar and harmony vocals. After a European and US tour which ended at the 1984 Louisiana World Expedition, Setzer made the decision to end the band, which left the other members aggrieved. In an interview, Setzer pleaded restlessness as his motivation: &quot;It&#x27;s just that I didn&#x27;t get that great feeling anymore... I had five good years of that, but then I got bored with it. In the last year I stopped getting that feeling, that great kick that twisted in my gut.&quot; Looking back in 2012, Setzer regretted the decision to dissolve the group saying &quot;it was silly to break up the Stray Cats at the peak of our success&quot;.

Setzer embarked on a solo career, exchanging his rockabilly focus for a more wide-ranging roots rock/Americana sound on the 1986 album &quot;The Knife Feels Like Justice&quot;. He dubbed his new band Brian Setzer &amp; the Radiation Ranch, drawing the name from the title of one of his new songs. They played their first major concert at the 1985 Farm Aid benefit festival.

Rocker and Phantom formed a trio called Phantom, Rocker &amp; Slick (the &quot;Slick&quot; being former David Bowie guitarist Earl Slick) whose debut album contained the single &quot;Men Without Shame&quot;; guest musicians on this record included Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones and pianist Nicky Hopkins.

In 1986, the Stray Cats reunited in Los Angeles, and recorded the covers-heavy &quot;Rock Therapy&quot;. A lengthy hiatus followed, but in 1989 they reunited once again for the album &quot;Blast Off!&quot;, which was accompanied by a tour with blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan. No longer with EMI America, they entered the studio with Nile Rodgers for another album, &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Faster&quot;, issued by Liberation in 1990. After 1992&#x27;s Dave Edmunds-produced &quot;Choo Choo Hot Fish&quot;, and the cover album &quot;Original Cool&quot;, the group called it quits again.

In 2004, the Stray Cats reassembled for a month-long tour of Europe. A live album culled from those concerts, &quot;Rumble in Brixton&quot;, included one new studio track, &quot;Mystery Train Kept A Rollin&#x27;&quot;. In 2007, they reunited once again for a US tour with ZZ Top and the Pretenders. This was their first North American tour in over 15 years. In the 2000s, the band toured Europe as part of their &quot;Farewell Tour&quot;.

In 2008, for the first time in 18 years, the Stray Cats visited Australia and New Zealand which included several consecutive sold-out shows of their Farewell (Australia) Tour. In April 2009 the band reunited for a single show to celebrate Brian&#x27;s 50th birthday at the Fine Line Music Café in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

On January 2, 2018, Setzer announced via his Facebook page that the band would reunite for a show in Las Vegas on April 21, 2018. The Stray Cats also performed two shows at the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa, California on August 16 and 17, 2018.

On October 16, 2018, the band announced they would reunite in 2019 for a new album (first in 25 years), record in Nashville, and tour to commemorate their 40th anniversary. On March 26, 2019, the video for the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Cat Fight (Over a Dog Like Me)&quot;, was released, with an announcement of a May 24 release for the album, titled &quot;40&quot;. This was released in time for the European legs of their 40th Anniversary tour.

At the conclusion of the tour and in early 2020 the band announced that an album, a collection of songs recorded at various locations while on the 40th Anniversary tour would be released, entitled &quot;Rocked This Town: From LA to London&quot;. It was released on CD and Vinyl and also on a number of streaming platforms.

In 2024, the band announced a three-week summer U.S. tour, their first tour in five years.

===Band members&#x27; follow-up careers===

The Stray Cats have reunited periodically for live performances. Setzer is still part of his 1990s swing-revival band The Brian Setzer Orchestra. Setzer also worked as executive producer on Drake Bell&#x27;s rockabilly revival album &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; Rocker continued recording and touring throughout the 1990s and on to today. His albums include &quot;Black Cat Bone&quot; and &quot;Racin&#x27; the Devil&quot; on Alligator Records, as well as &quot;Bulletproof&quot;.

In addition to the Stray Cats, Rocker has recorded or performed with Carl Perkins, George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Willie Nelson, Leon Russell, Scotty Moore, Keith Richards, and numerous others. Rocker and wife Deborah Drucker have two children and have been married since 1989. Slim Jim Phantom plays the drums in the bands Slim Jim&#x27;s Phantom Trio, The Jack Tars, 13 Cats, Kat Men, and The Head Cat. He is also an active member of the Love Hope Strength Foundation, a charitable organization which was co-founded by Mike Peters of The Alarm, and which raises funds for cancer units.

The band was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame on October 15, 2006.

<doc id="164017" wikidata="Q846322" url="?curid=164017" title="Half Hour of Power">
<text>Half Hour of Power is the debut extended play by Canadian rock band Sum 41. It was released on June 27, 2000, on Big Rig Records, a subsidiary of Island Records (United States), and Aquarius Records (Canada). The cover features the band&#x27;s then-drummer Steve Jocz aiming a Nerf gun up in the air and standing in front of an explosion in the background. Though officially an EP, &quot;Half Hour of Power&quot; may also be considered the band&#x27;s debut studio album. Most of the songs featured on the EP were included as bonus tracks on Sum 41&#x27;s actual debut studio album &quot;All Killer No Filler&quot; (2001), which featured a re-recorded version of &quot;Half Hour of Power&quot;&#x27;s sixth track &quot;Summer&quot;. This is the second of three times that this song was featured on a Sum 41 album. It first appeared on their 1998 demo tape. The group originally planned to include different versions of the song on each of their albums as a joke, but scrapped the idea after &quot;All Killer No Filler&quot;, as they felt that it would annoy their fanbase.

==Music==
Critics have categorised &quot;Half Hour of Power&quot; as punk rock, skate punk and pop punk. The songs &quot;Grab the Devil by the Horns and Fuck Him Up the Ass&quot; and &quot;Ride the Chariot to the Devil&quot;, are heavy metal songs, similar to Iron Maiden. Although &quot;Another Time Around&quot; was described as punk rock, the song&#x27;s intro was described as &quot;dirge-metal&quot;. The song &quot;Second Chance for Max Headroom&quot; sounds like the band NOFX and has a ska section. The song &quot;Dave&#x27;s Possessed Hair/It&#x27;s What We&#x27;re All About&quot; is known for having a part with elements of hip hop music. Elements of hardcore punk are also featured on the EP. The track &quot;T.H.T.&quot; is oi!.

== Critical reception ==

Curtis Zimmermann of AllMusic stated that &quot;The first track, &quot;Grab the Devil by the Horns and Fuck Him up the Ass,&quot; is a time warp. For a minute and a half the group relives the new wave of British metal and cranks out an Iron Maiden style tune. After a brief trip down memory lane the album quickly morphs into pop punk. The songs are well crafted and the hooks are catchy on &quot;Make No Difference&quot; and &quot;Summer.&quot; But in some respects that is problematic, there was a time in the pre-Green Day/Blink-182 years where punk defined itself by not being radio friendly. A good album, but essentially proof that turn of the millennium punk is just as much a corporate rock entity as adult contemporary.&quot;

<text>The term netizen is a portmanteau of the English words &quot;internet&quot; and &quot;citizen&quot;, as in a &quot;citizen of the net&quot; or &quot;net citizen&quot;. It describes a person actively involved in online communities or the Internet in general.

The term also commonly implies an interest and active engagement in improving the internet, making it an intellectual and a social resource, or its surrounding political structures, especially in regard to open access, net neutrality and free speech. The term was widely adopted in the mid-1990s as a way to describe those who inhabit the new geography of the internet. Internet pioneer and author Michael F. Hauben is credited with coining and popularizing the term.

==Determining factor==
In general, any individual who has access to the internet has the potential to be classified as a netizen. In the 21st century, this is made possible by the global connectivity of the internet. People can physically be located in one country but connected to most of the world via a global network.

There is a clear distinction between netizens and people who come online to use the internet. A netizen is described as an individual who actively seek to contribute to the development of the internet. Netizens are not individuals who go online for personal gain or profit, but instead actively seeks to make the internet a better place.

A term used to classify internet users who do not actively contribute to the development of the internet is &quot;lurker&quot;. Lurkers cannot be classified as netizens, as although they do not actively harm the internet, they do not contribute either.

Besides, lurkers seemed to be more critical of the technological elements enabling communities whereas posters appeared to be more critical of users who hampered community creation by making rude or unpleasant comments. Additionally, discussions indicate that both lurkers and posters had distinct motives for lurking and might modify their engagement behaviours based on how they understand the community from various online groups, despite the fact that engagement between those who post and those who lurk was different in the communities studied.

==In China==

In Mandarin Chinese, the terms &quot;wǎngmín&quot; (, literally &quot;netizen&quot; or &quot;net folks&quot;) and &quot;wǎngyǒu&quot; (, literally &quot;net friend&quot; or &quot;net mate&quot;) are commonly used terms meaning &quot;internet users&quot;, and the English word &quot;netizen&quot; is used by mainland China-based English language media to translate both terms, resulting in the frequent appearance of that English word in media reporting about China, far more frequently than the use of the word in other contexts.

== Netizen Prize==

The international nonprofit organisation Reporters Without Borders awards an annual Netizen Prize in recognition to an internet user, blogger, cyber-dissident, or group who has helped to promote freedom of expression on the internet.

<text>TAROM (; legally &quot;Compania Națională de Transporturi Aeriene Române TAROM S.A.&quot;) is the flag carrier and oldest currently operating airline of Romania, based in Otopeni near Bucharest. Its headquarters and its main hub are at Henri Coandă International Airport. It is currently the first and largest airline operating in Romania based on international destinations, international flights and the second-largest measured by fleet size and passengers carried.

The brand name is an acronym of the (Romanian Air Transport). Over ninety-seven percent (97.22%) of TAROM is owned by the Romanian Government (Ministry of Transport). The airline transported almost 2.75 million passengers in 2018, with an average load factor of 74%. The airline joined SkyTeam on 25 June 2010.

==History==



===The beginnings===
The history of the Romanian National Air Transport Company can be traced back to 1920, when CFRNA - (&quot;French-Romanian Company for Air Navigation&quot;) was founded. On 13 April 1920, the company registered its headquarters at 194 Rue Rivoli, in Paris. A decree issued on 26 April 1920 establishes &quot;Direcțiunea Aviației&quot; (The Directorate of Aviation), in the subordination of the Ministry of Communications. In the same year, the Kingdom of Romania offered CFRNA exploitation rights. The country offered the airline two aerodromes: one in Arad, and another one in Bucharest–Băneasa. The airline used French-built Potez 15 aircraft for its passenger/mail service between Paris and Bucharest via several cities in Central Europe. In 1925, the city of Galați became the first destination in Romania served by regular flights followed, from 24 June 1926, by an extended service to Iași and Chișinău. Ten de Havilland DH.9 and five Ansaldo A.300, in addition to the Potez aircraft, operated the service.

In 1928 the airline changed its name to SNNA (&quot;Serviciul Național de Navigație Aeriană&quot;, The National Service of Air Navigation). On 9 July 1930, the company adopted the name (&quot;Liniile Aeriene Române Exploatate de Stat&quot;, Romanian Airlines Operated by the State) while 20 July 1937 saw the merger of LARES with its competitor, (&quot;Societatea Anonimă Română de Transporturi Aeriene&quot;).

===Post-World War II===
Immediately after World War II, in 1945, when the Soviet Union had extended its influence across Eastern Europe, a new reorganization replaced LARES with TARS (&quot;Transporturi Aeriene Româno-Sovietice&quot;), jointly owned by the governments of Romania and the Soviet Union. Domestic operations were started from Bucharest (Băneasa Airport) on 1 February 1946, when TARS took overall air services and aircraft from LARES.

Over the following decade, the company&#x27;s Soviet share was purchased by the Romanian government and, on 18 September 1954, the airline adopted the name of TAROM (&quot;Transporturi Aeriene Române&quot;, Romanian Air Transport). By 1960, TAROM was flying to a dozen cities across Europe. 1966 saw the operation of its first transatlantic flight. On 14 May 1974, it launched a regular service to New York City (John F. Kennedy International Airport).

Being part of the regional group of airlines within Eastern Bloc states meant that for much of its history TAROM has operated Soviet-designed aircraft. These included Lisunov Li-2s, Ilyushin Il-14s, Ilyushin Il-18 long-range turboprops, Ilyushin Il-62 long-range jet airliners, Antonov An-24 regional turboprops, and Tupolev Tu-154 medium-range tri-jets. As was the case with several other nations, the Il-62 was the first long-range jet airliner to be put into operation by Romania, in 1973. Five examples (three Il-62s and two later version Il-62Ms) were owned by TAROM, which also leased the aircraft to other operators.

An exception to Soviet-built aircraft was made in 1968, when TAROM bought six BAC One-Eleven 400s for European and Middle Eastern destinations, and in 1974 when it acquired Boeing 707 aircraft to share its long-haul operations with the Il-62. Plans were made to acquire Vickers VC10 aircraft as well, but in the end, the Soviets did not allow it, and made them buy the Il-62 instead. With 59 aircraft in operation, in the late 1970s, TAROM had the largest fleet in the Eastern Bloc, after Aeroflot.

In 1978, a contract was signed with the UK enabling Rombac to manufacture the BAC One Eleven at Romaero, near Bucharest. Meanwhile, the 707 and Il-62 long-range aircraft were operating to New York (via Amsterdam, later London and finally Vienna), Abu Dhabi-Bangkok-Singapore, and Karachi-Beijing. TAROM was the only Eastern Bloc airline to operate flights to Tel Aviv, Israel.

===The 1990s===
After the collapse of the communist regime in 1989, the airline, operating a fleet of 65 aircraft of six basic types, was able to acquire more Western-built jets. In 1992, TAROM bought 3 Airbus A310 planes, nicknamed: &quot;Transilvania&quot; (YR-LCA), &quot;Moldova&quot; (YR-LCB) and &quot;Muntenia&quot; (YR-LCC). By 1993, TAROM had introduced long-haul flights to Montreal and Bangkok using Ilyushin Il-62 and Airbus A310 aircraft. The YR-LCC Airbus A310 joined TAROM&#x27;s fleet on 10 April 1994, to then crash near Balotești on 31 March 1995.

During the 1990s, TAROM replaced its long-haul fleet of Boeing 707s and IL-62s with Airbus A310s (the last Il-62 being sold in 1999).

===2000s and 2010s===
TAROM is recovering from a difficult period that began in the 1990s when losses of up to $68 million per year were registered, caused by unprofitable routes. At the beginning of the new millennium, the airline initiated a programme that was aimed at restoring profitability. This was achieved by terminating loss-making intercontinental services. In 2001, the airline cancelled its non-profitable long-haul services to Bangkok and Montreal and also terminated services to its remaining intercontinental destinations of Chicago in 2002, and Beijing and New York City in 2003. TAROM terminated loss-making domestic services to Craiova, Tulcea, Caransebeș, and Constanța, and focused its activity on service to key destinations in Europe and the Middle East. TAROM has decided to focus its operations on Bucharest (Henri Coandă International Airport) (OTP) and Cluj-Napoca International Airport (CLJ), and initiated direct international flights from Sibiu International Airport. 2004 was the first profitable year of the last decade. By 2005, TAROM tried selling its A310 fleet three times, which was being preserved since 2003.

A fleet upgrade programme started in 2006 with the acquisition of four Airbus A318s, three Boeing 737-800s, and two ATR 72-500s, which resulted in a fleet increase to 26 by 2009.

From 2003 till 2007, the airline spent €1 million per year to preserve its A310s &quot;Moldova&quot; and &quot;Transilvania&quot;. In 2007, TAROM modernized its two Airbus A310 planes at the Airbus plant in Bordeaux. After being reconditioned, the pair was used in medium-haul flights, which were not successful.

The airline had a frequent-flyer programme &quot;Smart Miles&quot;, which was turned into Flying Blue on 5 June 2010. Codeshare agreements with foreign partner airlines are in place for several international routes. On 25 June 2010, TAROM joined SkyTeam as the alliance&#x27;s thirteenth member.

Starting with November 2012, in accordance with the Romanian state-company legislation, TAROM was led by a private manager, the Belgian Christian Heinzmann occupying the positions of CEO and Accountable Manager until March 2016. During Heinzmann&#x27;s leadership, the company reduced its financial losses by more than 75%, grew its yearly passenger number to a record 2.4 million and stabilised its load-factor around 70%. However, broad reforms like the fleet renewal and harmonisation, as well as the establishment of profit centers such as the TAROM Maintenance and TAROM Charter services, were not accomplished due to a constant lack of a decision from the company&#x27;s board of administrators.

On 12 September and 29 October 2016, TAROM retired their remaining two Airbus A310-300s after final flights from Madrid to Bucharest. The A310s will be replaced with new smaller aircraft. In May 2017, TAROM received its first of two leased Boeing 737-800s. Another two ex-Malaysian Airlines 737-800 were added to the fleet in 2018 and a contract for five Boeing 737 MAX 8 was signed with deliveries stated to begin in 2023. On 27 December 2019, the Ministry of Transport announced that 9 new ATR 72-600 leased from Nordic Aviation Capital for a 10 year-period would replace the existent ATR 42-500 and 72-500, manufactured in 1999–2000 and 2009, respectively. TAROM received the first four aircraft in February 2020, with the first one, registered with code YR-ATJ, landing in Bucharest on 18 February 2020, at 2:50 PM EET.

=== 2020s ===
The COVID-19 pandemic caused TAROM to temporarily cease all scheduled operations from 25 March 2020. TAROM operated flights for the Romanian Government during the state of emergency, bringing medical equipment from China. After the state of emergency expired, TAROM resumed scheduled operations from May 2020.

In 2021, TAROM&#x27;s then new CEO stated that none of the airline&#x27;s current routes were profitable. In October 2022, it was reported that the operator of Henri Coandă International Airport, TAROM&#x27;s home base, was considering legal action against the airline over unpaid fees exceeding 10 million Euros, and also might suspend all services for the carrier.

In November 2024, the European General Court rejected a legal challenge by low-cost carrier Wizz Air against a capital injection provided by the Romanian government to TAROM. The aid, valued at €2 million, was approved by the European Commission as part of efforts to compensate TAROM for losses related to COVID-19 travel restrictions. Wizz Air argued that this financial support violated EU competition laws, but the court affirmed the European Commission’s decision, ruling that the subsidy was in compliance with EU state aid regulations. 

==Corporate affairs==
===Ownership===
TAROM is a state-owned company, with shareholding structure as follows:
===Business trends===
Figures for recent years are shown below (for years ending 31 December): 
===Logo and livery===
The TAROM logo, representing a swallow in flight, has been used on all TAROM aircraft since 1954. The 1970s livery had the logo on the tail painted in red, with a red cheatline. The livery introduced in the early 1990s (on the Airbus A310 aircraft) is an overall-white scheme with the titles and the tailfin painted in dark blue. The current colour scheme (introduced in 2006 on the A318) is a slightly modified version of the previous one, with an oversized logo on the tailfin, and the engine pods also painted in dark blue.

All aircraft in the TAROM fleet receive a &quot;name&quot; which is a Romanian toponym. For instance, the names of the ATR aircraft in the fleet are related to the rivers of Romania, the Boeing aircraft bear names of Romanian cities, the Airbus long-haul aircraft bore Romanian historical province names; while the Airbus A318s bear names of Romanian aviation pioneers.

In 2009, marking the airline&#x27;s 55th anniversary, a Boeing 737-700 (YR-BGG &quot;Craiova&quot;) was painted in a retro jet colour scheme, representing the airline&#x27;s first livery used in the 1950s on Lisunov Li-2 aircraft.

===TAROM Technical Division===
TAROM&#x27;s Technical Division provides aircraft maintenance services for the company&#x27;s entire fleet and aircraft of other companies. It provides maintenance for Boeing 737, ATR 42 and ATR 72 aircraft in central and eastern Europe and include unscheduled and scheduled maintenance, repairs and spare parts.

Major maintenance is performed in the division&#x27;s hangar, built between 1969 and 1972, with an area of 6,000 m and updated in 2000 to comply with EASA and FAA standards. The hangar is equipped to perform all types of inspections for TAROM&#x27;s fleet, and the personnel is qualified and licensed for all types of aircraft in the fleet. The hangar can be used to maintain three to six aircraft, depending on their size. The hangar is equipped with a full MERO system for B737 docking.

The department also has inspection capacity for type C for Airbus A310 and A318 aircraft, total painting, interior cleaning, and modifications.

The technical department also provides safe storage facilities for spare parts and materials necessary for maintenance, dedicated spaces for chemicals, special tools and testing equipment, and quarantine spaces. It also provides conveyance services (packaging, preparation of documents, customs) and acceptance services (customs, disassembly, and reception inspection) for various substances and equipment.

In a dispute between TAROM and UK airline Jet2.com regarding failure to provide adequate maintenance services for Jet2.com&#x27;s fleet and the latter&#x27;s resulting failure to pay certain invoices, the High Court in England determined that TAROM&#x27;s attempt to terminate the contract in 2007 for non-payment was invalid, and treated the termination as a repudiatory breach of the contract. Jet2.com were awarded damages.

===Fleet development===


==== Short-haul fleet ====
TAROM agreed in 2019 to lease 9 ATR 72-600 aircraft from Nordic Aviation Capital to replace existing ATR 42-500 and ATR 72-500 aircraft. In 2021, the order was reduced from 9 to 7 ATR 72-600.

==== Medium-haul fleet ====
After the retiring of Airbus A310s in 2016, two new Boeing 737-800 were leased in 2017. In 2018, another two Boeing 737-800 were leased. Also, at the Farnborough Air Show, the Government of Romania signed a contract to buy 5 Boeing 737 MAX-8 at an estimated value of $586 million. As of 2022, TAROM was negotiating with a few leasing companies for 4 to 8 Boeing 737 MAX-8. Airbus A318s and Boeing 737-700s are going to be retired soon, while Boeing 737-300s were retired in 2021.

==== Long-haul fleet ====
TAROM had been planning to lease three widebody aircraft to resume long-haul operations to China and the United States after the withdrawal of its Airbus A310s. The Request For Proposals (RFP) to leasing firms expired on 31 August 2017. In 2018, TAROM made efforts to lease some Boeing 787s, but there was no further information.

==== VIP fleet ====
In 2018, the CEO of that time declared that TAROM could operate a legacy aircraft with maximum 10 seats, which could fly over Atlantic, in order to be leased by the Romanian Government, the Presidential Administration, for VIP business affairs or in medical emergencies. There was no further development. Between 2010 and 2013, under the Băsescu administration, TAROM operated an Airbus A310-300 for presidential purposes.

==Incidents and accidents==
* On 4 November 1957, a TAROM Ilyushin Il-14P (YR-PCC) operating a government flight from Bucharest to Moscow via Kiev, crashed short of the runway at Vnukovo Airport, killing four of 16 on board. The aircraft was on approach to Vnukovo Airport when the pilot noticed that the aircraft was too low, however, the aircraft continued its descent until it struck treetops and later crashed. The aircraft was carrying a Romanian delegation consisting of Chivu Stoica, Grigore Preoteasa, Alexandru Moghioroș, Ștefan Voitec, Nicolae Ceaușescu, Leonte Răutu and Marin Năstase to Moscow. Preoteasa, who apparently was not wearing a safety belt, and three Soviet crew members lost their lives.
* On 24 February 1962 an Ilyushin Il-18V, registration YR-IMB, operating on an international scheduled flight from Bucharest Otopeni Airport (OTP) to Tel Aviv via Nicosia lost power on all four engines and made a belly landing on a grassy field in Cyprus. While cruising at over the Mediterranean Sea and offshore, engine number 3 lost power, followed shortly by number 1 and 2. Then, at and offshore, engine 4 also quit. All 100 occupants survived. The aircraft was transported to Moscow for repairs, but it never re-entered service.
* On 16 June 1963, a VEB 14P (YR-ILL) flying from Munich to Constanța entered a dive and crashed near the village of Békéssámson, Hungary following engine problems, killing all 31 on board.
* On 9 October 1964, an Ilyushin Il-14P, registration YR-ILB, operating a domestic scheduled flight from Timișoara to Bucharest broke up in mid-air and crashed south of Cugir, killing all 31 on board. The aircraft had flown into a strong downdraft; the pilot attempted to maintain altitude, but this caused the fuselage to overstress and break up.
* On 11 August 1966, a Lisunov Li-2, registration YR-TAN, crashed in the Lotrioara Valley en route from Brașov to Constanţa, killing all 24 on board.
* On 4 February 1970, TAROM Flight 35, an Antonov An-24, registration YR-AMT, operating a domestic scheduled flight from Bucharest to Oradea struck the side of a mountain in the Vlădeasa mountain group, killing 20 of 21 on board; although nine survived the crash, eight died in the low temperatures before rescuers reached the crash site. The aircraft began descending too soon in poor visibility until it struck treetops on a mountainside, after which it struck the slope of a second mountain. The aircraft was leased from the Romanian government.
* On 29 December 1974, an Antonov An-24, registration YR-AMD, operating on a domestic scheduled flight from Oradea to Bucharest was making an unscheduled stop at Sibiu and crashed into the side of the Lotrului mountains ( south of Sibiu) at an altitude of , killing all 28 passengers and 5 crew members. The crew&#x27;s incorrect approach procedure execution, which led to the aircraft drifting south off course by , while the wind was increasing turbulence was present.
*On 7 August 1980, a Tupolev Tu-154B-1 registered YR-TPH, operating on an international scheduled flight from Bucharest Otopeni Airport to Nouadhibou Airport, Mauritania ditched in the water short of the runway at Nouadhibou Airport. The crew could not see the runway while descending through the decision height. A missed approach procedure was initiated when the pilot felt contact with what he thought was ground but was actually water. All of the 152 passengers and 16 crew members survived the impact, but a passenger suffered a heart attack and died before he could be rescued. Most of the passengers were sailors who were going to replace the crew of two Romanian ships located on the Mauritanian coast. Many passengers swam to the land, while sharks were kept away by the vibrations of an engine which continued to function for a few hours after the crash.
*On 5 September 1986, an Antonov An-24 registered YR-AMF operating on a domestic scheduled flight from Bucharest Băneasa Airport touched down nose wheel-first while landing at Cluj Airport. A fire erupted, killing three crew members who were trapped in the cockpit. The other two crew members and all fifty passengers survived.
*On 28 December 1989, during the Romanian Revolution, an Antonov An-24 flying from Bucharest to Belgrade, carrying &quot;Sunday Times&quot; journalist Ian Henry Parry, was shot down by a missile at Vișina, Dâmbovița. All the people on board (six crew members and the passenger) died.

*On 13 August 1991, TAROM Flight 785A, an Ilyushin Il-18, flying from Otopeni to Timișoara Airport crashed in the Retezat Mountains during a repositioning flight. The flight crew, and an aircraft maintenance crew, a total of 9 people, died instantly. Whilst the official cause of the crash was attributed to pilot error (the pilots did not use radar instruments and only assumed their positions, thus getting lost), the secrecy regarding the crash sparked a few conspiracy theories, which include sabotage, accidental shootdown from a nearby surface-to-air missiles unit (a theory later dismissed by the MApN), and UFOs that tricked the pilots into believing they had arrived at their destination, linked to the sightings of unusual lights on 4 August 1991.
*On 24 September 1994, TAROM Flight 381, an Airbus A310 registered YR-LCA flying from Bucharest to Paris Orly, went into a sudden and uncommanded nose-up position and stalled. The crew attempted to countermand the aircraft&#x27;s flight control system but were unable to lower the nose while remaining on course. Witnesses saw the aircraft climb with an extreme nose-up attitude, then bank sharply left, then right, then fall into a steep dive. Only when the dive produced additional speed was the crew able to recover steady flight. An investigation found that an overshoot of flap placard speed during the approach, incorrectly commanded by the captain, caused a mode transition to flight level change. The auto-throttles increased power and trim went full nose-up as a result. The crew&#x27;s attempt at commanding the nose-down elevator could not counteract the effect of stabilizer nose-up trim, and the resulting dive brought the aircraft from a height of at the time of the stall to when the crew was able to recover command. The aircraft landed safely after a second approach. There were 186 people on board.

*On 31 March 1995, a TAROM Airbus A310 operating as Flight 371 crashed near Balotești due to a fault in the throttles and lack of recovery from the flight crew, killing all 49 passengers and 11 crew members on board.
*On 30 December 2007, a TAROM Boeing 737-300 (YR-BGC &quot;Constanța&quot;), flying Flight 3107 hit a car on the runway of Bucharest Henri Coandă International Airport while taking off for Sharm-el-Sheikh. The aircraft stopped beside the runway and was severely damaged. None of the passengers were injured. Because of fog, neither the tower nor the pilots saw the car belonging to staff who were repairing a runway beacon.
*On 9 July 2019, a TAROM ATR 42-500 (YR-ATF) burst the tyres of the main landing gear wheels at Bucharest Henri Coandă International Airport while conducting the landing of Flight 638 from Satu Mare. None of the passengers were injured. An internal safety investigation was conducted, with a report being published on 11 September 2019. TAROM&#x27;s report concluded that the tyre explosions were caused by the parking brakes being engaged on contact with the runway. The brakes locked shortly after contact with the runway. This resulted in the bursting of all four tyres of the main landing wheels. The early engagement of parking brakes were attributed to pilot error. Specifically, poor cockpit resource management (CRM).

<text>In science, a formula is a concise way of expressing information symbolically, as in a mathematical formula or a &quot;chemical formula&quot;. The informal use of the term &quot;formula&quot; in science refers to the general construct of a relationship between given quantities. 

The plural of &quot;formula&quot; can be either &quot;formulas&quot; (from the most common English plural noun form) or, under the influence of scientific Latin, &quot;formulae&quot; (from the original Latin).

==In mathematics==
In mathematics, a formula generally refers to an equation or inequality relating one mathematical expression to another, with the most important ones being mathematical theorems. For example, determining the volume of a sphere requires a significant amount of integral calculus or its geometrical analogue, the method of exhaustion. However, having done this once in terms of some parameter (the radius for example), mathematicians have produced a formula to describe the volume of a sphere in terms of its radius:

: formula_1

Having obtained this result, the volume of any sphere can be computed as long as its radius is known. Here, notice that the volume &quot;V&quot; and the radius &quot;r&quot; are expressed as single letters instead of words or phrases. This convention, while less important in a relatively simple formula, means that mathematicians can more quickly manipulate formulas which are larger and more complex. Mathematical formulas are often algebraic, analytical or in closed form.

In a general context, formulas often represent mathematical models of real world phenomena, and as such can be used to provide solutions (or approximate solutions) to real world problems, with some being more general than others. For example, the formula

: formula_2

is an expression of Newton&#x27;s second law, and is applicable to a wide range of physical situations. Other formulas, such as the use of the equation of a sine curve to model the movement of the tides in a bay, may be created to solve a particular problem. In all cases, however, formulas form the basis for calculations.

Expressions are distinct from formulas in the sense that they don&#x27;t usually contain relations like equality (=) or inequality (&lt;). Expressions denote a mathematical object, where as formulas denote a statement about mathematical objects. This is analogous to natural language, where a noun phrase refers to an object, and a whole sentence refers to a fact. For example, formula_3 is an expression, while formula_4 is a formula.

However, in some areas mathematics, and in particular in computer algebra, formulas are viewed as expressions that can be evaluated to &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;, depending on the values that are given to the variables occurring in the expressions. For example formula_5 takes the value &quot;false&quot; if is given a value less than 1, and the value &quot;true&quot; otherwise. (See Boolean expression)

===In mathematical logic===
In mathematical logic, a formula (often referred to as a &quot;well-formed formula&quot;) is an entity constructed using the symbols and formation rules of a given logical language. For example, in first-order logic,
:formula_6
is a formula, provided that formula_7 is a unary function symbol, formula_8 a unary predicate symbol, and formula_9 a ternary predicate symbol.

==Chemical formulas==
In modern chemistry, a chemical formula is a way of expressing information about the proportions of atoms that constitute a particular chemical compound, using a single line of chemical element symbols, numbers, and sometimes other symbols, such as parentheses, brackets, and plus (+) and minus (−) signs. For example, H2O is the chemical formula for water, specifying that each molecule consists of two hydrogen (H) atoms and one oxygen (O) atom. Similarly, O denotes an ozone molecule consisting of three oxygen atoms and a net negative charge.

-\overset{\displaystyle H \atop |}{\underset{\underset{\underset{| \atop \displaystyle H}{C}}-H&lt;/chem&gt;|caption=The structural formula for butane. There are three common non-pictorial types of chemical formulas for this molecule:
|alt=A diagram showing one line of four connected Cs (carbon atoms) branching out to ten Hs (hydrogen atoms)}}

A chemical formula identifies each constituent element by its chemical symbol, and indicates the proportionate number of atoms of each element.

In empirical formulas, these proportions begin with a key element and then assign numbers of atoms of the other elements in the compound—as ratios to the key element. For molecular compounds, these ratio numbers can always be expressed as whole numbers. For example, the empirical formula of ethanol may be written C2H6O, because the molecules of ethanol all contain two carbon atoms, six hydrogen atoms, and one oxygen atom. Some types of ionic compounds, however, cannot be written as empirical formulas which contains only the whole numbers. An example is boron carbide, whose formula of CBn is a variable non-whole number ratio, with n ranging from over 4 to more than 6.5.

When the chemical compound of the formula consists of simple molecules, chemical formulas often employ ways to suggest the structure of the molecule. There are several types of these formulas, including molecular formulas and condensed formulas. A molecular formula enumerates the number of atoms to reflect those in the molecule, so that the molecular formula for glucose is C6H12O6 rather than the glucose empirical formula, which is CH2O. Except for the very simple substances, molecular chemical formulas generally lack needed structural information, and might even be ambiguous in occasions.

A structural formula is a drawing that shows the location of each atom, and which atoms it binds to.

==In computing==
In computing, a formula typically describes a calculation, such as addition, to be performed on one or more variables. A formula is often implicitly provided in the form of a computer instruction such as.

: &quot;Degrees Celsius&quot; = (5/9)*(&quot;Degrees Fahrenheit&quot;  - 32)

In computer spreadsheet software, a formula indicating how to compute the value of a cell, say &quot;A3&quot;, could be written as

: &quot;=A1+A2&quot;

where &quot;A1&quot; and &quot;A2&quot; refer to other cells (column A, row 1 or 2) within the spreadsheet. This is a shortcut for the &quot;paper&quot; form &quot;A3 = A1+A2&quot;, where &quot;A3&quot; is, by convention, omitted because the result is always stored in the cell itself, making the stating of the name redundant.

==Units==
Formulas used in science almost always require a choice of units. Formulas are used to express relationships between various quantities, such as temperature, mass, or charge in physics; supply, profit, or demand in economics; or a wide range of other quantities in other disciplines.

An example of a formula used in science is Boltzmann&#x27;s entropy formula. In statistical thermodynamics, it is a probability equation relating the entropy &quot;S&quot; of an ideal gas to the quantity &quot;W&quot;, which is the number of microstates corresponding to a given macrostate:
: formula_10
where &quot;k&quot; is the Boltzmann constant, equal to , and &quot;W&quot; is the number of microstates consistent with the given macrostate.

<text>Aceraceae were recognized as a family of flowering plants also called the maple family. They contain two to four genera, depending upon the circumscription, of some 120 species of trees and shrubs. A common characteristic is that the leaves are opposite, and the fruit a schizocarp.

The maples have long been known to be closely related to the family Sapindaceae. Several taxonomists (including the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group) now include both the Aceraceae and the Hippocastanaceae in the Sapindaceae. Recent research (Harrington et al. 2005) has shown that while both Aceraceae and Hippocastanaceae are monophyletic in themselves, their removal from Sapindaceae &quot;sensu lato&quot; would leave Sapindaceae &quot;sensu stricto&quot; as a paraphyletic group, particularly with reference to the genus &quot;Xanthoceras&quot;.

<doc id="164043" wikidata="Q204899" url="?curid=164043" title="Andrew Golota">
<text>Andrzej Jan Gołota (; born 5 January 1968), best known as Andrew Golota, is a Polish former professional boxer who competed from 1992 to 2013. He challenged four times for a heavyweight world title (by all four major sanctioning bodies), and as an amateur won a bronze medal in the heavyweight division at the 1988 Olympics. Despite his accomplishments and more than 40 professional wins, Golota is perhaps best known for twice being disqualified against Riddick Bowe for repeated low blows in fights that Golota was winning. On October 4, 1997, he became the first Pole to challenge for a heavyweight boxing crown when he fought WBC champion Lennox Lewis at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City. He had a bout with Mike Tyson in 2000, which he first withdrew from, but afterward was ruled no-contest. In November 2016, Golota was inducted into the Illinois Boxing Hall of Fame.

==Amateur career==
The Warsaw-born, Golota had 111 wins and 10 losses in an amateur career that culminated in his winning a bronze medal at the 1988 Summer Olympics. Golota won other international amateur tournaments as well.

In 1990, he got into a fight with a machinist &quot;about half a foot and 50 pounds smaller&quot; in a bar in Poland. Facing charges of assault and battery, he fled rather than risk five years in prison. Later that year, he married an American citizen of Polish descent and settled in Chicago.
Gołota&#x27;s Olympic results were as follows:
*1st round bye
*Defeated Svilen Rusinov (Bulgaria) 5-0
*Defeated Harold Obunga (Kenya) 5-0
*Lost to Baik Hyun-Man (South Korea) RSC 2

==Professional career==
In 1992, Golota turned professional, knocking out Roosevelt Shuler in three rounds. He had three more knockouts and then went the distance for the first time, defeating Robert Smith in six rounds. He won his next 16 fights by knockout. His wins included Bobby Crabtree and Jeff Lampkin. Following his KO of Crabtree he was featured in Ring Magazine&#x27;s &quot;new faces&quot; section. Soon after, he faced a respected contender, Maron Wilson. Golota won a ten-round decision. He won his next five bouts by knockout. His opponents included Samson Po&#x27;uha and Darnell Nicholson, both of whom were considered fringe contenders at the time. The win over Po&#x27;uha was memorable for the moment in which Gołota bit Po&#x27;uha on the side of the neck, two years before the bite-including rematch between Evander Holyfield and Mike Tyson.

===Golota vs. Bowe I &amp; II===
Golota&#x27;s first high-profile fight came against former heavyweight champion Riddick Bowe. Bowe had not fought in nearly a year since his third and final fight with Evander Holyfield, which he won by technical knockout in the eighth round, and had said regarding his opponent, &quot;how do you train for a bum?&quot;, paying no attention to his opponent&#x27;s win–loss record. The fight was held at Madison Square Garden on 11 July 1996, and was televised by HBO as part of its World Championship Boxing series.

Early in the fight it appeared that Bowe had underestimated his opponent&#x27;s skills. However, Golota&#x27;s penchant for not following the rules was also showcased in this fight as he took to striking Bowe in the testes. After being repeatedly warned, referee Wayne Kelly began deducting points from Golota and had done so twice prior to the seventh round. Early in that round, Kelly took a third point from Golota for punching Bowe in the testes, and warned him that if he did it again, he was going to lose the fight. Golota continued to fight and with less than a minute left in the round landed several hard shots that appeared to have Bowe staggered. However, with 37 seconds remaining in the round Golota dropped Bowe with another punch directly to the testes, and Kelly disqualified him. What ensued was a dramatic riot that left a large number of civilians and policemen injured, including Gołota himself, who was hit by a member of Bowe&#x27;s entourage with a two-way radio and required eleven stitches to close a cut on his head. The riot, which has been named &quot;Riot at the Garden&quot;, was called Event of the Year by &quot;Ring Magazine&quot;.

The controversy of Golota vs. Bowe I created interest in a rematch, which was held in Atlantic City, New Jersey on December 14, 1996. Golota vs. Bowe II was on Pay Per View and Gołota once again led Bowe on the scorecards only to be disqualified in the ninth round by referee Eddie Cotton, again for multiple shots to Bowe&#x27;s testes. This fight also proved to be controversial, and a protest was filed by Gołota&#x27;s camp to try to overturn the fight&#x27;s result. Michael Katz, a sportswriter, coined the term &quot;Foul Pole&quot; for Gołota. Both fights are featured on HBO&#x27;s documentary Legendary Nights The Tale of Bowe Golota. 

===Championship fight with Lewis===

Despite two losses in a row, Gołota became the WBC number one contender. On 4 October 1997, he received a shot at the world&#x27;s Heavyweight championship against Lennox Lewis in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Gołota was knocked out in the first round.

Gołota subsequently claimed that an injection of lidocaine for tendonitis in his right knee given to him by his physician shortly before the fight made him woozy and impaired his vision. The adverse effects of lidocaine include dizziness, blurred vision, seizures. As a result, he filed a medical malpractice suit against his physician, claiming that the injection had cost him the fight and a deal with HBO for $21 million to broadcast his next four to five fights.

===Later career===
Gołota&#x27;s boxing career continued with his beating former 2-time world champion Tim Witherspoon by decision. In his next match, he lost to Michael Grant by a knockout in the tenth round in one of &quot;The Ring&quot;&#x27;s 1999 fights of the year. Gołota scored two knockdowns of Grant in the first round. He was ahead on all three judges&#x27; scorecards in the tenth round when he himself was knocked down. When asked by referee Randy Neuman whether he wanted to continue, he shook his head twice and then haltingly answered &quot;No&quot;.

In 2000, Gołota fought in China beating Marcus Rhodes with a third-round knockout. Later in 2000, he faced former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson. Tyson knocked Golota down in the first round, and in between rounds Golota told his corner to stop the fight but his corner talked him into continuing. In the third round, as he had done in the Grant match, Gołota told the referee he did not want to continue, despite his team desperately urging him on. He later claimed a headbutt impaired him during the fight, which was one of his main reasons for deciding not to continue. The result of the fight was later changed to no contest when Tyson failed a post fight drug test, testing positive for marijuana. Following the Tyson fight, Gołota was inactive for nearly three years before returning to the ring on 14 August 2003. He scored a technical knockout of journeyman Brian Nix in the seventh round. On November 15, Golota knocked out Terrence Lewis in the sixth round at Verona, New York.

====Later World title shots====

Gołota then received a second world title shot, fighting IBF heavyweight champion Chris Byrd at New York City&#x27;s Madison Square Garden on 17 April 2004. The fight resulted in a draw.

On 13 November 2004, Gołota received his second world title shot in a row. Despite knocking down WBA champion John Ruiz twice within the bout, he lost by unanimous decision.

Golota received his third world title try in a row on 21 May 2005 against WBO champion Lamon Brewster. Though heavily favored to win, Gołota lost when Brewster knocked him down three times inside the first round, prompting the referee to stop the bout. On 9 June 2007, he beat Jeremy Bates in the 2nd round by technical knockout. Gołota fought Kevin McBride on October 6, 2007 in Madison Square Garden and won by TKO in the 6th round, winning the inaugural IBF North American Heavyweight championship.

On 19 January 2008, Gołota defeated Mike Mollo by unanimous decision in 12 rounds to win the World Boxing Association Fedelatin heavyweight championship belt. In January, 2009, Gołota lost by first-round TKO to Ray Austin. On 24 October 2009 in Łódź, Gołota fought Tomasz Adamek and lost by TKO in the 5th round. The event was hosted on Polsat TV, it was also broadcast live online on ipla.tv platform. It was the largest live internet transmission in Poland.

<doc id="164044" wikidata="Q2151217" url="?curid=164044" title="Mosque of Omar (Jerusalem)">
<text>The Ayyubid Mosque of Omar () is an Islamic place of worship inside the Old City of Jerusalem. It is located opposite the southern courtyard of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, in the Muristan area of the Christian Quarter. The mosque is not open to tourists, and can be accessed only for praying.

==History==
According to local tradition, after the Siege of Jerusalem in 637 by the Rashidun army under the command of Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah, Patriarch Sophronius refused to surrender except to the Caliph Omar (579-644) himself. Omar travelled to Jerusalem and accepted the surrender. He then approached the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and Patriarch Sophronius invited the Caliph to pray inside the church, but Omar declined so as not to set a precedent and thereby endanger the church&#x27;s status as a Christian site. Instead he prayed outside, on the steps east of the church. The Mosque of Omar was later built at that site, as evidenced by a stone plate with a Kufic inscription found in 1897 in the area of the eastern or outer atrium of the Constantinian (4th-century) Church of the Holy Sepulchre, defining this area as a mosque.

The current structure was built in its current shape by the Ayyubid Sultan Al-Afdal ibn Salah ad-Din in 1193 to commemorate the prayer of the caliph Omar.

== Architecture ==
The current structure was built in its current shape by the Ayyubid Sultan Al-Afdal ibn Salah ad-Din in 1193 to commemorate the prayer of the caliph Omar. The entrance to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre had by then moved from the east to the south of the church, as a result of repeated destructive events that affected the Holy Sepulchre and Muslim mosques during the 11th and 12th centuries.

The current building of the mosque has a high minaret that was built sometime before 1465 during the Mamluk period, maybe after the 1458 earthquake, and was renovated by Ottoman sultan Abdulmecid I (r. 1839–1860).

The Al-Khanqah al-Salahiyya Mosque, located on the other (northern) side of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, has an almost identical minaret, erected in 1418.

<text>Charles-Marie Gustave Le Bon (7 May 1841 – 13 December 1931) was a leading French polymath whose areas of interest included anthropology, psychology, sociology, medicine, invention, and physics. He is best known for his 1895 work &quot;The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind&quot;, which is considered one of the seminal works of crowd psychology.

A native of Nogent-le-Rotrou, Le Bon qualified as a doctor of medicine at the University of Paris in 1866. He opted against the formal practice of medicine as a physician, instead beginning his writing career the same year of his graduation. He published a number of medical articles and books before joining the French Army after the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War. Defeat in the war coupled with being a first-hand witness to the Paris Commune of 1871 strongly shaped Le Bon&#x27;s worldview. He then travelled widely, touring Europe, Asia and North Africa. He analysed the peoples and the civilisations he encountered under the umbrella of the nascent field of anthropology, developing an essentialist view of humanity, and invented a portable cephalometer during his travels.

In the 1890s, he turned to psychology and sociology, in which fields he released his most successful works. Le Bon developed the view that crowds are not the sum of their individual parts, proposing that within crowds there forms a new psychological entity, the characteristics of which are determined by the &quot;racial unconscious&quot; of the crowd. At the same time he created his psychological and sociological theories, he performed experiments in physics and published popular books on the subject, anticipating the mass–energy equivalence and prophesising the Atomic Age. Le Bon maintained his eclectic interests up until his death in 1931.

Ignored or maligned by sections of the French academic and scientific establishment during his life due to his politically conservative and reactionary views, Le Bon was critical of majoritarianism and socialism.

== Biography ==
=== Youth ===
Charles-Marie Gustave Le Bon was born in Nogent-le-Rotrou, Centre-Val de Loire on 7 May 1841 to a family of Breton ancestry. At the time of Le Bon&#x27;s birth, his mother, Annette Josephine Eugénic Tétiot Desmarlinais, was twenty-six and his father, Jean-Marie Charles Le Bon, was forty-one and a provincial functionary of the French government. Le Bon was a direct descendant of Jean-Odet Carnot, whose grandfather, Jean Carnot, had a brother, Denys, from whom the fifth president of the French Third Republic, Marie François Sadi Carnot, was directly descended.

When Le Bon was eight years old, his father obtained a new post in French government and the family, including Gustave&#x27;s younger brother Georges, left Nogent-le-Rotrou never to return. Nonetheless, the town was proud that Gustave Le Bon was born there and later named a street after him. Little else is known of Le Bon&#x27;s childhood, except for his attendance at a lycée in Tours, where he was an unexceptional student.

In 1860, he began medicinal studies at the University of Paris. He completed his internship at Hôtel-Dieu de Paris, and received his doctorate in 1866. From that time on, he referred to himself as &quot;Doctor&quot; though he never formally worked as a physician. During his university years, Le Bon wrote articles on a range of medical topics, the first of which related to the maladies that plagued those who lived in swamp-like conditions. He published several other about loa loa filariasis and asphyxia before releasing his first full-length book in 1866, &quot;De la mort apparente et des inhumations prématurées&quot;. This work dealt with the definition of death, preceding 20th-century legal debates on the issue.

=== Life in Paris ===
After his graduation, Le Bon remained in Paris, where he taught himself English and German by reading William Shakespeare&#x27;s works in each language. He maintained his passion for writing and authored several papers on physiological studies, as well as an 1868 textbook about sexual reproduction, before joining the French Army as a medical officer after the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in July 1870. During the war, Le Bon organised a division of military ambulances. In that capacity, he observed the behaviour of the military under the worst possible condition—total defeat, and wrote about his reflections on military discipline, leadership and the behaviour of man in a state of stress and suffering. These reflections garnered praise from generals, and were later studied at Saint-Cyr and other military academies in France. At the end of the war, Le Bon was named a &quot;Chevalier&quot; of the Legion of Honour.

Le Bon also witnessed the Paris Commune of 1871, which deeply affected his worldview. The then thirty-year-old Le Bon looked on as Parisian revolutionary crowds burned down the Tuileries Palace, the library of the Louvre, the Hôtel de Ville, the Gobelins Manufactory, the Palais de Justice, and other irreplaceable works of architectural art.

From 1871 on, Le Bon was an avowed opponent of socialist pacifists and protectionists, who he believed were halting France&#x27;s martial development and stifling her industrial growth; stating in 1913: &quot;Only people with lots of cannons have the right to be pacifists.&quot; He also warned his countrymen of the deleterious effects of political rivalries in the face of German military might and rapid industrialisation, and therefore was uninvolved in the Dreyfus Affair which dichotomised France.

=== Widespread travels ===
Le Bon became interested in the emerging field of anthropology in the 1870s and travelled throughout Europe, Asia and North Africa. Influenced by Charles Darwin, Herbert Spencer and Ernst Haeckel, Le Bon supported biological determinism and a hierarchical view of the races and sexes; after extensive field research, he posited a correlation between cranial capacity and intelligence in &quot;Recherches anatomiques et mathématiques sur les variations de volume du cerveau et sur leurs relations avec l&#x27;intelligence&quot; (1879), which earned him the Godard Prize from the French Academy of Sciences. During his research, he invented a portable cephalometer to aid with measuring the physical characteristics of remote peoples, and in 1881 published a paper, &quot;The Pocket Cephalometer, or Compass of Coordinates&quot;, detailing his invention and its application.

In 1884, he was commissioned by the French government to travel around Asia and report on the civilisations there. The results of his journeys were a number of books, and a development in Le Bon&#x27;s thinking to also view culture to be influenced chiefly by hereditary factors such as the unique racial features of the people. The first book, entitled &quot;La Civilisation des Arabes&quot;, was released in 1884. In this, Le Bon praised Arabs highly for their contributions to civilisation, but criticised Islamism as an agent of stagnation. He also described their culture as superior to that of the Turks who governed them, and translations of this work were inspirational to early Arab nationalists. He followed this with a trip to Nepal, becoming the first Frenchman to visit the country, and released &quot;Voyage au Népal&quot; in 1886.

He next published &quot;Les Civilisations de l&#x27;Inde&quot; (1887), in which he applauded Indian architecture, art and religion but argued that Indians were comparatively inferior to Europeans in regard to scientific advancements, and that this had facilitated British domination. In 1889, he released &quot;Les Premières Civilisations de l&#x27;Orient&quot;, giving in it an overview of the Mesopotamian, Indian, Chinese and Egyptian civilisations. The same year, he delivered a speech to the International Colonial Congress criticising colonial policies which included attempts of cultural assimilation, stating: &quot;Leave to the natives their customs, their institutions and their laws.&quot; Le Bon released the last book on the topic of his travels, entitled &quot;Les monuments de l&#x27;Inde&quot;, in 1893, again praising the architectural achievements of the Indian people.

=== Development of theories ===
On his travels, Le Bon travelled largely on horseback and noticed that techniques used by horse breeders and trainers varied dependent on the region. He returned to Paris and in 1892, while riding a high-spirited horse, he was bucked off and narrowly escaped death. He was unsure as to what caused him to be thrown off the horse, and decided to begin a study of what he had done wrong as a rider. The result of his study was &quot;L&#x27;Équitation actuelle et ses principes. Recherches expérimentales&quot; (1892), which consisted of numerous photographs of horses in action combined with analysis by Le Bon. This work became a respected cavalry manual, and Le Bon extrapolated his studies on the behaviour of horses to develop theories on early childhood education.

Le Bon&#x27;s behavioural study of horses also sparked a long-standing interest in psychology, and in 1894 he released &quot;Lois psychologiques de l&#x27;évolution des peuples&quot;. This work was dedicated to his friend Charles Richet though it drew much from the theories of Théodule-Armand Ribot, to whom Le Bon dedicated &quot;Psychologie des Foules&quot; (1895). &quot;Psychologie des Foules&quot; was in part a summation of Le Bon&#x27;s 1881 work, &quot;L&#x27;Homme et les sociétés,&quot; to which Émile Durkheim referred in his doctoral dissertation, &quot;De la division du travail social&quot;.

Both were best-sellers, with &quot;Psychologie des Foules&quot; being translated into nineteen languages within one year of its appearance. Le Bon followed these with two more books on psychology, &quot;Psychologie du Socialisme&quot; and &quot;Psychologie de l&#x27;Éducation&quot;, in 1896 and 1902 respectively. These works rankled the largely socialist academic establishment of France.
Le Bon constructed a home laboratory in the early 1890s, and in 1896 reported observing &quot;black light&quot;, a new kind of radiation that he believed was distinct from, but possibly related to, X-rays and cathode rays. Not the same type of radiation as what is now known as black light, its existence was never confirmed and, similar to N rays, it is now generally understood to be non-existent, but the discovery claim attracted much attention among French scientists at the time, many of whom supported it and Le Bon&#x27;s general ideas on matter and radiation, and he was even nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903.

In 1902, Le Bon began a series of weekly luncheons to which he invited prominent intellectuals, nobles and ladies of fashion. The strength of his personal networks is apparent from the guest list: participants included cousins Henri and Raymond Poincaré, Paul Valéry, Alexander Izvolsky, Henri Bergson, Marcellin Berthelot and Aristide Briand.

In &quot;L&#x27;Évolution de la Matière&quot; (1905), Le Bon anticipated the mass–energy equivalence, and in a 1922 letter to Albert Einstein complained about his lack of recognition. Einstein responded and conceded that a mass–energy equivalence had been proposed before him, but only the theory of relativity had cogently proved it. Gaston Moch gave Le Bon credit for anticipating Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity. In &quot;L&#x27;Évolution des Forces&quot; (1907), Le Bon prophesied the Atomic Age. He wrote about &quot;the manifestation of a new force—namely intra-atomic energy—which surpasses all others by its colossal magnitude,&quot; and stated that a scientist who discovered a way to dissociate rapidly one gram of any metal would &quot;not witness the results of his experiments ... the explosion produced would be so formidable that his laboratory and all neighbouring houses, with their inhabitants, would be instantaneously pulverised.&quot;
Le Bon discontinued his research in physics in 1908, and turned again to psychology. He released &quot;La Psychologie politique et la défense sociale&quot;, &quot;Les Opinions et les croyances&quot;, &quot;La Révolution Française et la Psychologie des Révolutions&quot;, &quot;Aphorismes du temps présent&quot;, and &quot;La Vie des vérités&quot; in back-to-back years from 1910 to 1914, expounding in which his views on affective and rational thought, the psychology of race, and the history of civilisation.

=== Later life and death ===

Le Bon continued writing throughout World War I, publishing &quot;Enseignements Psychologiques de la Guerre Européenne&quot; (1915), &quot;Premières conséquences de la guerre: transformation mentale des peuples&quot; (1916) and &quot;Hier et demain. Pensées brèves&quot; (1918) during the war.

He then released &quot;Psychologie des Temps Nouveaux&quot; (1920) before resigning from his position as Professor of Psychology and Allied Sciences at the University of Paris and retiring to his home.

He released &quot;Le Déséquilibre du Monde&quot;, &quot;Les Incertitudes de l&#x27;heure présente&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;évolution actuelle du monde, illusions et réalités&quot; in 1923, 1924 and 1927 respectively, giving in them his views of the world during the volatile interwar period.

He became a &quot;Grand-Croix&quot; of the Legion of Honour in 1929. He published his last work, entitled &quot;Bases scientifiques d&#x27;une philosophie de l&#x27;histoire&quot;, in 1931 and on 13 December, died in Marnes-la-Coquette, Île-de-France at the age of ninety.

== Le Bonian thought ==
Convinced that human actions are guided by eternal laws, Le Bon attempted to synthesise Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer with Jules Michelet and Alexis de Tocqueville.

=== Inspirations ===
According to Steve Reicher, Le Bon was not the first crowd psychologist: &quot;The first debate in crowd psychology was actually between two criminologists, Scipio Sighele and Gabriel Tarde, concerning how to determine and assign criminal responsibility within a crowd and hence who to arrest.&quot; Le Bon, who also explicitly recognised the positive potential of crowds, viewed the criminological focus of the earlier authors as an unnecessary restriction for the study of crowd psychology.

=== Crowds ===
Le Bon theorised that the new entity, the &quot;psychological crowd&quot;, which emerges from incorporating the assembled population not only forms a new body but also creates a collective &quot;unconsciousness&quot;. As a group of people gather together and coalesces to form a crowd, there is a &quot;magnetic influence given out by the crowd&quot; that transmutes every individual&#x27;s behaviour until it becomes governed by the &quot;group mind&quot;. This model treats the crowd as a unit in its composition which robs every individual member of their opinions, values and beliefs; as Le Bon states: &quot;An individual in a crowd is a grain of sand amid other grains of sand, which the wind stirs up at will&quot;.

Le Bon detailed three key processes that create the psychological crowd: i) Anonymity, ii) Contagion and iii) Suggestibility. Anonymity provides to rational individuals a feeling of invincibility and the loss of personal responsibility. An individual becomes primitive, unreasoning, and emotional. This lack of self-restraint allows individuals to &quot;yield to instincts&quot; and to accept the instinctual drives of their &quot;unconscious&quot;. For Le Bon, the crowd inverts Darwin&#x27;s law of evolution and becomes atavistic, proving Ernst Haeckel&#x27;s embryological theory: &quot;ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny&quot;. Contagion refers to the spread in the crowd of particular behaviours and individuals sacrifice their personal interest for the collective interest. Suggestibility is the mechanism through which the contagion is achieved; as the crowd coalesces into a singular mind, suggestions made by strong voices in the crowd create a space for the unconscious to come to the forefront and guide its behaviour. At this stage, the psychological crowd becomes homogeneous and malleable to suggestions from its strongest members. &quot;The leaders we speak of,&quot; says Le Bon, &quot;are usually men of action rather than of words. They are not gifted with keen foresight... They are especially recruited from the ranks of those morbidly nervous excitable half-deranged persons who are bordering on madness.&quot;

== Influence ==

George Lachmann Mosse claimed that fascist theories of leadership that emerged during the 1920s owed much to Le Bon&#x27;s theories of crowd psychology. Adolf Hitler is known to have read &quot;The Crowd&quot; and in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; drew on the propaganda techniques proposed by Le Bon. Benito Mussolini also made a careful study of Le Bon.

Le Bon was widely read within the Committee of Union and Progress in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Philosophical and military leaders who would later lead the Young Turk Revolution, such as Ahmet Rıza and Enver Bey, took inspiration from Le Bon and movements such as Social Darwinism to define their elitist and authoritarian approach to politics, as well as their advocacy of revolution from above.

Some commentators have drawn a link between Le Bon and Vladimir Lenin / the Bolsheviks.

Just prior to World War I, Wilfred Trotter introduced Wilfred Bion to Le Bon&#x27;s writings and Sigmund Freud&#x27;s work &quot;Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego&quot;. Trotter&#x27;s book &quot;Instincts of the Herd in Peace and War&quot; (1919) forms the basis for the research of both Wilfred Bion and Ernest Jones who established what would be called group dynamics. During the first half of the twentieth century, Le Bon&#x27;s writings were used by media researchers such as Hadley Cantril and Herbert Blumer to describe the reactions of subordinate groups to media.

Edward Bernays, a nephew of Sigmund Freud, was influenced by Le Bon and Trotter. In his influential book &quot;Propaganda&quot;, he declared that a major feature of democracy was the manipulation of the electorate by the mass media and advertising. Some have claimed that, Theodore Roosevelt and Charles G. Dawes and many other American progressives in the early 20th century were also deeply affected by Le Bon&#x27;s writings.

<text>Jean Servais Stas (21 August 1813 – 13 December 1891) was a Belgian analytical chemist who accurately measured the atomic weight of carbon.

== Life and work ==

Stas was born in Leuven and trained initially as a physician. He later switched to chemistry and worked at the École Polytechnique in Paris under the direction of Jean-Baptiste Dumas. Stas and Dumas established the atomic weight of carbon by weighing a sample of the pure material, burning it in pure oxygen, and then weighing the carbon dioxide produced.

In 1840, Stas was appointed professor at the Royal Military School in Brussels. He acquired international fame by determining the atomic weights of the elements more accurately than had ever been done before, using an atomic mass of 16 for oxygen as his standard. His results disproved the hypothesis of the English physicist William Prout that all atomic weights must be integer multiples of that of hydrogen. These careful, accurate atomic weight measurements of Stas helped lay the foundation for the periodic system of elements of Dmitri Mendeleev and others.

Following the pioneering work of Lavoisier and his statement of the conservation of mass, the prolonged and exhaustive experiments of Stas supported the strict accuracy of this law in chemical reactions, even though they were carried out with other intentions. His research indicated that in certain reactions the loss or gain could not have been more than from 2 to 4 parts in 100,000. The difference in the accuracy aimed at and attained by Lavoisier on the one hand, and by Morley and Stas on the other, is enormous.

In 1850, Stas gave the evidence that the Belgian Count Hippolyte Visart de Bocarmé killed his brother-in-law by poisoning him with nicotine.

Stas retired in 1869 because of problems with his voice caused by a throat ailment. He became commissioner of the mint, but resigned in 1872 because he disagreed with the government&#x27;s monetary policy. Jean Stas died in Brussels and was buried at Leuven.

== Honors and awards ==

* Foreign Member, Royal Society of London (1879)
* Davy Medal (1885)

On May 5, 1891 an event was held recognizing the 50th anniversary of Jean Servais Stas&#x27; membership in the Royal Academy of Belgium. Various presenters spoke about his significant scientific contributions. He was presented with a medal in his honor sculpted by Belgian engraver Alphonse Michaux and with an album containing accolades authored by scientific societies from around the world.

<text>Amager ( ), located in the Øresund, is Denmark&#x27;s most densely populated island, with more than 216,000 inhabitants (January 2022). The protected natural area of &quot;Naturpark Amager&quot; (including Kalvebod Fælled) makes up more than one-third of the island&#x27;s total area of 96 km2.

The Danish capital, Copenhagen Municipality, is partly situated on Amager, covering the northern part of the island, which is connected to the much larger island of Zealand by eight bridges and a metro tunnel. Amager also has a connection across the Øresund to Sweden, the Øresund Bridge. Its western part begins with a tunnel from Amager to another Danish island, Peberholm. Copenhagen Airport is located on the island, around from Copenhagen city centre.

Amager is the largest island in the Øresund, and the only one with a large population. , 212,661 people lived on the island, including its northern tip, Christianshavn. The northern part is included in the Copenhagen municipality. The middle part comprises Tårnby municipality, and Dragør municipality is located on the southeast part of the island.

Most of the western part of the island today comprises land that was claimed from the sea from the 1930s to the 1950s. This enlargement, from the shallow sound towards Zealand, is known as &quot;Kalveboderne&quot;. The enlargement has never been built-up and its soil is unsuitable for agricultural use. However, the area between Dragør town and the airport is cultivated land of high quality. Amager has in the past been referred to as the &quot;kitchen of Copenhagen&quot;. At the border of the enlargement there is an old beech forest, &quot;Kongelunden&quot; (The King&#x27;s Grove).

==History==

Amager has long been populated, and well used, thanks to its rich soil and proximity to Copenhagen. In 1521, Christian II invited some Dutch farmers to move to Amager and grow vegetables to supply the Danish Court and Copenhagen. These farmers enjoyed certain privileges such as their own government and institutions, as well as their own schools and priests. Due to this and a ban on mixed marriages, they maintained their own language, Amager Dutch, which remained spoken until 1858. This dialect&#x27;s spelling and vocabulary was influenced by Danish, and it had heavier phonological and grammatical influence from Low German, due to the importance of Low German in trade in the Baltic Sea and the influence of Low German-speaking Lutheran clergy.

It was only in the late 19th century that Copenhagen began to expand onto the island (Sundbyerne), and in 1902 these built-up areas were incorporated into Copenhagen.

During the Second World War, high unemployment in Copenhagen led authorities to drain a large part of the sea, west of the island, and build a dam to hold out the water, effectively adding one half of Amager&#x27;s previous area to the island.

The claimed area is currently known as Kalvebod Fælled, and was originally a military area, but today it is part of a major construction area called the Ørestad, being thought of as an extension to central Copenhagen. The area houses major facilities such as:
* Bella Center, a convention and exposition center
* Field&#x27;s, the second-largest shopping center in Scandinavia
* Royal Arena, a multi-use indoor arena
This project was initiated by the Danish government.

The beach area to the east of the island, known as Amager Strandpark (Amager Beach Park), which had fallen into disrepair since its inception in the 1930s, was extensively redeveloped between May 2004 and August 2005. A 2-km-long artificial island was constructed just off the mainland, from which it is separated by a small lagoon.

Until the 1970s, Amager was used as a place to dump latrine waste; this led to a slang term for the island &#x27;Lorteøen&#x27; (Shit Island). See Renholdningsselskabet af 1898.

==Amenities==

Large parts of Kalvebod Fælled are rich in nature and have many grazing cows and horses. This area allows the citizens of Copenhagen to experience nature, without travelling far from the city.

Amager is also home to the Amager Bio, a cinema, concert and cultural venue. Top bands from the last 40 years have played there, both those of international origin (Prince, Alien Ant Farm, P.O.D, Aimee Mann, Uriah Heep, King Crimson, Cradle of Filth, John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers, Jethro Tull, The Moody Blues, MGMT, Nas, Andrew Bird) and from Denmark (D.A.D, Dodo and the Dodos, Johnny Deluxe, Big Fat Snake).

Amager Common (Danish: &quot;Amager Fælled&quot;) is a 223 hectare nature reserve in north-west Amager. The former military area is home to a diverse range of flora and fauna; including forests, fields, and Highland cattle.

The King&#x27;s Grove (Danish: &quot;Kongelunden)&quot; is a large oak forest located on the southern side of Amager. It&#x27;s popular for cycling, bird watching, and horseback riding.

The National Aquarium Denmark is situated in the east of Amager and is Northern Europe&#x27;s largest aquarium.

== Communities ==

Various communities are located on Amager, including Islands Brygge, and the towns of Dragør, Kastrup, and Tårnby.

==Transport==

Amager is connected by tunnel to the artificial island Peberholm from which Øresund Bridge connects Denmark to Sweden. The construction of the bridge has had a significant impact on the physical geography of the island, largely due to the construction of new highways.

The Copenhagen Metro connects Amager to central Copenhagen. The metro line from Vanløse to Amager divides into M1 and M2 lines at Christianshavn and then continue to Vestamager and Lufthavnen (Copenhagen Airport).

Copenhagen Airport is in the eastern part of Amager. It is linked by train, metro and bus services.

<text>Stockholm Arlanda Airport is the main international airport serving Stockholm, the capital of Sweden. It is located in Sigtuna Municipality, north of Stockholm and nearly southeast of Uppsala. The airport is located within Stockholm County. 

Arlanda is the largest airport in Sweden and the third-largest airport in the Nordic countries. The airport is the major gateway to international air travel for large parts of Sweden. Arlanda Airport was used by nearly 27 million passengers in 2017, with 21.2 million international passengers and 5.5 million domestic. The facility covers an expanse of about of airport property. Stockholm Arlanda serves as a major hub for Scandinavian Airlines and Norwegian Air Shuttle.

Stockholm Arlanda Airport is the larger of Stockholm&#x27;s two airports. The other, Stockholm Bromma Airport, is located 7 km (4.3 mi) northwest of central Stockholm, but can be used only by smaller aircraft. Two further airports outside of Stockholm County are also included in STO, the IATA airport code for the Stockholm Metropolitan Area: Stockholm Skavsta Airport and Stockholm Västerås Airport, both located around away from the Swedish capital.

==History==
===Foundation and early years===

The airport was first used in 1959 but only for practice flights. It opened for limited civil traffic in 1960, and in 1962 the official opening ceremony took place. It was used from the start for intercontinental traffic because the runway at Bromma was too short. Scandinavian Airlines started using Douglas DC-8s on North American routes. The airport was also used very early by Pan American World Airways. The name &quot;Arlanda&quot; was decided after a competition prior to the airport opening. It is derived from Arland, an old name for the parish Ärlinghundra (now Husby-Ärlinghundra in Märsta) where the airport is situated. The &#x27;-a&#x27; was added in analogy with other Swedish place names ending with -landa and also plays on the Swedish verb &quot;landa&quot;, which means &quot;to land&quot;. The 1960s and 1970s saw increases in traffic with scheduled traffic and charter traffic. The Boeing 747 jumbojet started to be used in the 1970s, both on one-stop scheduled flights to New York and on weekend nonstop charters to the Canary Islands. Domestic flights to Gothenburg, Malmö, Luleå and Kiruna were operated by SAS DC-9s from Arlanda since they were considered too noisy to be used at downtown Bromma. The rest of domestic traffic operated out of Bromma, and all international traffic operated out of Arlanda.

In 1983, the domestic traffic operated by Linjeflyg moved from Bromma to Arlanda, using the terminal now known as Terminal 4. In 1990, two new domestic terminals called &quot;Domestic 2 and 3&quot; were built south of the first domestic terminal. In 1992, the terminal 2 was partly abandoned because of traffic decrease. It started to be used for international traffic the year after, and the main domestic and international terminals were renumbered into 4 and 5. 

===Development since 2000===
The third runway was built between 1998 and 2002; however, a recession in 2002 delayed its opening until 2003. At that time, protests were raised by people living under its flight path in the municipality of Upplands Väsby. Traffic has recovered since and is now showing healthy increases, but the third runway is only used during peak hours for environmental reasons. In September 2010, the first Airbus A380 superjumbo landed at the airport.

In early 2014, Swedavia announced plans for further expansions of the airport terminal complex, including the construction of an additional pier for Terminal 5 in order to better accommodate larger aircraft such as the Airbus A380 and Boeing 747-8 and address forecasts of rising passenger numbers. The plans were approved by the Environmental Court of Appeals in December 2014, and construction was scheduled to commence in the spring of 2015.

In the spring of 2020, most flights were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. SAS decided to fly only four domestic departures and four domestic arrivals from Arlanda, plus some international flights, after 6 April 2020 while Norwegian cancelled all flights from Arlanda except to Oslo. Terminal 2, 3 and 4 closed and terminal 5 handled all passengers during this period (March 2020 – October 2021) The passenger figures were 97.7% lower in April 2020 than in April 2019. The figured picked up later, but in early 2021 were still more than 80% less per month than 2019.

In the spring of 2022, passenger figures rose again to more normal levels. This caused capacity problems, especially in the security check, because most of its staff were fired due to the pandemic recession. Additionally followed with the time to find and get security approval for and educate new staff. Terminal 4 could not open because transfer between it and Terminal 5 required a security check, and the security check was congested already, so Terminal 5 became congested. Swedavia built a new pedestrian tunnel between the two terminals, bypassing the security check area. It opened together with Terminal 4 at the end of June 2022.

In September 2024, Braathens Regional Airlines announced it would discontinue its regular flight services and relocate its operations from Bromma Airport to Stockholm Arlanda Airport, as a contract operator for SAS. This decision is expected to cause Bromma to lose around 90% of its traffic, potentially hastening its closure, and leaving Arlanda as Stockholm County&#x27;s only public airport.

== Terminals ==
Arlanda has four terminals numbered 2, 3, 4 and 5. As of 2024, all terminals are operational. The terminals have no strict separation of domestic and international flights, however gates are separated between Schengen and Non-Schengen departures. From 1992 to 2019, terminals 2 and 5 were used for international flights, and 3 and 4 for domestic flights. During the COVID-19 pandemic only Terminal 5 was used. In 2022, Terminals 4 and 5 were connected airside, enabling them to operate as a single terminal. 

Arlanda has never had a Terminal 1.The designation was reserved for a potential terminal planned to be located just south of Terminal 2, which has never been built.

=== Sky City ===
In addition to the terminals, the airport features a concourse area called Sky City, located between Terminals 4 and 5. This area includes shopping and restaurant facilities, along with Arlanda Central Station below it. Sky City is situated landside, outside the security check area, and serves both passengers and visitors. Sky City also offers hotels connected to the terminals, located outside the security and passport check areas.

=== Terminal 2 ===
Terminal 2 (gates 61–82) was inaugurated on 12 December 1990, by Prince Bertil. Initially named Inrikes 2 &quot;(&quot;Domestic 2&quot;)&quot; it was designed for use by SAS as a domestic terminal, it features 8 aircraft parking stands with passenger bridges.

The terminal was constructed to facilitate short turnaround times, increased efficiency, and minimal walking distances for passengers. At its opening, it did not have security checks and was intended for passengers with hand luggage, allowing them to arrive just 10 minutes before departure. The design included double walk bridges suitable for MD-80 aircraft.

In 1992, SAS moved its domestic operations out of Terminal 2 due to a decrease in passenger traffic on domestic routes. The terminal then began accommodating other airlines, including Transwede Airways, for both domestic and international flights.

By the late 1990s, the terminal&#x27;s capacity was insufficient to handle the growing passenger traffic. Significant updates were made in 2001 when Terminal 2 was reconfigured to handle exclusively international flights as part of preparations for Sweden’s entry into the Schengen area. The terminal was adapted to meet new requirements, including the addition of security checks and a larger luggage claim area.

In 2013, Terminal 2 underwent a major refurbishment that expanded it by 2,500 square meters. The renovation added new transit areas, shops, and restaurants, as well as a new floor level with additional amenities such as restaurants and a lounge. Terminal 2 also features an express station for high-speed trains, Arlanda South Station, shared with terminals 3 and 4, but with its own dedicated escalator. There are buses between Terminal 2 and Terminal 5 without need for further security check.

* As of 29 May 2012, Norwegian relocated its international flights from Terminal 2 to Terminal 5 moving Air France and Czech Airlines to Terminal 2.
* In April 2013, British Airways and Finnair relocated to the newly renovated Terminal 2.
* Terminal 2 was closed due to COVID-19 between March 2020–October 2021. After reopening, Air France, Czech, Easyjet, KLM, Transavia and Vueling use Terminal 2.

=== Terminal 3 ===
Terminal 3 (gates 51–59) was opened in 1990 to serve regional domestic aircraft. Originally, Terminal 3 was built without security checks, which were later introduced after 2001, following Sweden&#x27;s entry into the Schengen area. 

The terminal features a café and a boarding process where passengers walk outdoors from the gates and board planes using airstairs. Access to Terminal 3 is through Terminal 2, requiring a 200-meter walk.

Terminal 3 was designed to handle regional flights within Sweden. However, over time, there was a decline in passenger numbers for these smaller connections, leading to reduced utilisation of Terminal 3. In early 2020, Terminal 3 was closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic but as of October 2024 Terminal 3 will be in full use again for both domestic and international flights within Schengen - however arriving international passengers will exit through terminal 2 by bus from the aircraft since there is no custom facilities at Terminal 3. 

In the summer of 2024, Swedavia conducted runway maintenance at Stockholm Bromma Airport. During this period, BRA (Braathens Regional Airlines) temporarily relocated its operations to Terminal 3 at Stockholm Arlanda Airport. In October 2024, PopulAir, Jonair and Västflyg commenced operations from Terminal 3, signifying the terminal&#x27;s full reopening after a period of closure. 

=== Terminal 4 ===
Terminal 4 (gates C30–C44, also now known as Terminal 5 - C Gates) was inaugurated in 1983 by King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia. Initially named &quot;Inrikes 1&quot; (&quot;Domestic 1&quot;), it was designed to handle domestic flights. Terminal 4 takes the form of a single pier and features 14 aircraft parking stands with passenger bridges. Today Terminal 4 is primarily used by low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and Wizzair. 

In 1984, Linjeflyg and Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) relocated all operations from Stockholm Bromma Airport to the new terminal at Arlanda to consolidate their domestic and international departures. Due to its increasing popularity, the terminal soon became too small. To address this, &quot;Inrikes 2&quot; (now named Terminal 2) was established in 1990 for SAS, which moved all its domestic flights from &quot;Inrikes 1&quot; to the new terminal.

Due to the 1990–1994 Swedish financial crisis, SAS returned to Terminal 4 in 1992, and the two carriers once again shared the terminal. In the same year, &quot;Inrikes 1&quot; was renamed Terminal 4. Since 1999, Terminal 4 has been served by the Arlanda South Station, a station for the Arlanda Express, connecting the terminal with Stockholm Central Station and Arlanda North Station at Terminal 5. In 2006, Terminal 4 underwent a major renovation, the first significant update since its construction in 1983.

The terminal was closed in spring 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and reopened in June 2022, primarily serving Ryanair. During its closure, an airside walkway was constructed, linking Terminal 4 with Terminal 5, allowing them to operate as a single terminal. 

Terminal 4 does not have passport control, customs facilities or baggage reclaim facilities. Passengers on non-Schengen flights, check in and pass through security at Terminal 4 but proceed to a non-Schengen gate within Terminal 5 for passport control and departure. Similarly, all arriving passengers are routed via the airside walkway to Terminal 5 for customs clearance and baggage reclaim.

=== Terminal 5 ===
Terminal 5 (gates D11–D24, E1–E10 and F26-F69) is the largest and oldest of Arlanda&#x27;s current passenger terminals. The terminal was opened as Arlanda International in 1976 by King Carl XVI Gustaf. Built to handle both scheduled and charter international flights, Terminal 5 has since undergone several expansions. It now comprises three piers - D, E and F - which are equipped with 31 aircraft parking stands with passenger bridges. 

In 1992, the terminal was renamed from &quot;Arlanda International&quot; to its current designation as Terminal 5, and in 1999 Arlanda North Station was opened, providing a direct rail link to Stockholm Central Station with the Arlanda Express. In 2003, Terminal 5 underwent a significant expansion that included the addition of a third pier. This expansion was part of a broader redevelopment of Arlanda Airport, which also saw the opening of Runway 3 and a new air traffic control tower. The expanded facilities were inaugurated on 17 December 2003, by Infrastructure Minister Ulrika Messing.

Since 2020, Terminal 5 at Stockholm Arlanda Airport has served both domestic and international flights. It functions as a hub for Scandinavian Airlines and Norwegian Air Shuttle, and accommodates both Schengen and non-Schengen destinations. Since 2018, some gates at Terminal 5 have been able to support larger aircraft models such as the Airbus A380. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all traffic at Arlanda Airport was moved to Terminal 5 between March 2020 and October 2021.

Since 2022, Terminal 5 has been connected to Terminal 4 via an airside walkway, allowing them to operate as a single terminal. Terminal 5 now manages arrivals, customs, and baggage reclaim for Terminal 4. A new security control facility equipped with CT scanners opened in early summer 2023. Ongoing expansion efforts include the construction of an expanded airside concourse and new duty-free store, which has been opening gradually since 2023 and is expected to be completed by the end of 2024, featuring approximately 50 new retailers, restaurants, and services. 

Future plans for Terminal 5 include the addition of Pier G by 2040, which aims to increase the terminal&#x27;s capacity to accommodate up to 40 million passengers annually, up from 25 million in 2019.

==Operations==
===Runways===
Arlanda has three runways: Runway 1 (01L/19R), Runway 2 (08/26) and Runway 3 (01R/19L). Runway 1 is long and can handle take-offs and landings of the heaviest aircraft in use today. Runways 2 and 3 are long. As indicated, runways 1 and 3 are parallel runways that can be operated independently of one another. Runways 1 and 3 are equipped with CAT III systems for instrument landings. The airport can handle simultaneous take offs and landings using runways 1 and 3 at the same time. Simultaneous aircraft takeoffs and landings can be performed in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). Runway 3 (01R/19L) is reached from the main terminal area via taxiway bridges constructed to be able to handle the heaviest and largest aircraft in traffic, although its length practically limits this. Since runway 3 (01R/19L) is located at a distance from the terminals, a deicing area is placed close to the runway to avoid long waits between deicing and take off in winter conditions. Another deicing area is located in connection with the southern ramp area close to the take off positions at runway 01L. There are high speed taxiway exits from all runways, except runway 08, to enable aircraft to exit the runways quickly after landing. That increases runway capacity during rush hours. Use of parallel taxiways around the terminal area separates arriving and departing traffic. Arlanda can handle all aircraft types in service including the Airbus A380.

===Cargo facilities===
Stockholm Arlanda has extensive cargo flight activity. There is a cargo area with cargo terminals and cargo transit facilities in the southern part of the airport area. The cargo area is labeled &quot;Cargo City&quot; with warehouses operated by Cargo Center, DHL, Swedish postal service (Posten) and Spirit Air Cargo. A large part of mail and express parcels from Sweden is handled through the facilities at the airport. SAS Cargo has its cargo operation east of the passenger terminals close to the SAS hangars.

Dedicated scheduled cargo flights are operated by Korean Air Cargo with Boeing 747 cargo aircraft, as well as Lufthansa Cargo and Turkish Airlines. DHL, FedEx and UPS operate express freight services at the airport. West Air Sweden and PopulAir operate shorter cargo sectors. A number of airlines operate ad hoc cargo flights with various equipment. Outsize cargo is frequently hauled with the Antonov An-124 and similar cargo planes. TNT had their operations at Arlanda but have since moved to Västerås Airport.

=== Aircraft hangars and maintenance facilities ===

SAS Technical Services, TUI fly Nordic and Priority Aero Maintenance. have large aircraft hangars and maintenance facilities at the airport. SAS Technical Services is headquartered at Arlanda and has hangar facilities suitable for widebody aircraft up to the size of Boeing 747-400s. The first part of the hangar complex was built to handle SAS&#x27; fleet of DC-8s. There are a number of positions on each side of the building initially built to handle the type. The hangar space are now used mostly for Boeing 737s and A320s. The Boeing 747 hangar was inaugurated at the time when Scandinavian Airlines received their first Boeing 747s in the beginning of the 70s. It is large enough to handle a Boeing 747 and two 737 sized airplanes at the same time. The offices of SAS Technical Services are situated in connection with the hangars. In the early days of the airport these hangars provided heavy maintenance for members of the KSSU group, which included KLM, SAS, Swissair and UTA. A number of other airlines, such as Thai Airways International, also maintained their aircraft in those hangars. Now the main user is Scandinavian Airlines. TUI fly Nordic has a hangar able to handle their largest aircraft, the Boeing 787-9. Priority Aero Maintenance has its facilities in the eastern part of the airport. They provide heavy aircraft maintenance for a number of aircraft including MD-80, a common type to be overhauled by the company.

There is also a hangar in the southern part of the airport, built by the former Swedish domestic airline Linjeflyg. It is used mainly by regional aircraft.

Helicopter hangars and maintenance facilities are found at the very eastern part of the airport operated by Patria Helicopters.

===Other facilities===
Swedavia, the Swedish airport management company, has its head office in the airport control tower facility. The company Sollentuna Cabin Interiors has its head office in Hangar 4 at Arlanda.

Oxford Aviation Academy has a flight simulator centre for some of the most common airliners of today (like Boeing 737) at Arlanda. Arlanda has hangars and aircraft maintenance facilities operated by SAS Scandinavian Airlines and Priority Aero Maintenance. TUI fly Nordic based at the airport also has a large hangar for widebody jets. There is also a helicopter repair facility operated by Patria Helicopters. A decommissioned Boeing 747 jumbo jet renovated into a hostel, the Jumbo Stay (formerly Jumbo Hostel), is located at the entrance to Arlanda Airport. There are four additional hotels at the airport (Clarion Hotel Arlanda Airport, Radisson Blu Arlandia Hotel, Radisson Blu SkyCity Hotel and Rest and Fly); in addition there are several hotels nearby with transfer buses.

==Winter time operations and snow clearing==

Arlanda has a policy to never close due to snowfall. Arlanda is exposed to lake-effect snowfalls, where ice cold air from the northeast in combination with open water in the Baltic Sea causes heavy snowfall. During heavy snowfall at least one runway stays open but in bad weather condition there may be delays even if flight operations continue at all times. Not just runways need to be cleared, aprons and aircraft parking areas need snow clearing as well. It is an advantage that there are three runways allowing two open runways when one is cleared at lighter snowfall. The airport has a total of 250 000 m2 to clear from snow and ice, at the same time as the aircraft continue taking off and landing. During the colder half of the year Stockholm Arlanda has about 65 seasonally hired snow removal staff. Together with permanent staff, they form a team of 100 people who provide snow removal services. Special routes are planned for sweeping teams, which clear each route at intervals of 35 to 45 minutes. The sweeping teams are directed via radio from the air traffic control tower. When snow removal is completed on each runway the surface is tested by a friction vehicle, which measures friction value. The airport announces the friction value, and then it is each pilot who decides whether the value is sufficient for a landing. The friction value determines how often a runway must be ploughed and treated with antiskid agent.

==VIP flights and services==
Arlanda, as the main airport serving the Swedish capital, is also used by VIP-flights using business jets. Government officials and celebrities are frequent visitors. In April 2011, the then-Chairman of the Russian Government Vladimir Putin visited Stockholm with a couple of large jet airplanes. The Emperor of Japan has also visited Arlanda with his Boeing 747s. In September 2013, U.S. President Barack Obama, made an official visit to Sweden with &quot;Air Force One&quot;. EU-meetings and exhibitions in the Stockholm area also bring special flights to the airport. Various private companies use their business jets to attend meetings in the Stockholm area. Some VIP-flights also go to the more central Bromma Airport, but since Bromma has limited operational hours and does not allow large aircraft, many go to Arlanda instead. European Flight Service has a Grumman Gulfstream G550 based at Arlanda for VIP flights.

Arlanda has several VIP lounges. They allow travellers to meet their planes on the tarmac. The VIP area can also hold weddings, with or without a flight. The airport also holds weddings in the control tower.

==Ground transportation==
===Rail===
Arlanda Airport is connected to Sweden&#x27;s rail network via the Arlanda Line, a railway that connects Stockholm Arlanda Airport to the East Coast Line. This line opened in 1999 and runs in a tunnel beneath the airport, with three separate stations: Arlanda South, Arlanda North, and Arlanda Central. The line is not owned by Swedavia, and is privately operated by A-Train AB, the owner of the Arlanda Express.

==== Arlanda Express ====

The Arlanda Express is the primary express train service between central Stockholm and Arlanda Airport. It runs non-stop between Stockholm Central Station and Arlanda South and North stations. For the Arlanda Express, Arlanda South Station serves Terminals 2, 3, and 4; and Arlanda North Station serves Terminal 5.

==== Regional and national trains ====
Arlanda is additionally served by many long-distance trains from Arlanda Central Station, with connections to various destinations north and south of the airport. These services are primarily operated by SJ and Mälartåg.

* SJ operates several train types, including &quot;InterCity&quot;, &quot;Regional&quot;, &quot;Nattåg&quot; night trains, and high-speed &quot;Snabbtåg&quot; services. These trains connect Arlanda to major cities such as Stockholm, Uppsala, Gävle, Sundsvall, Umeå, and Östersund.
* Mälartåg provides regional services to destinations including Stockholm, Uppsala, Eskilstuna, Arboga, and Linköping.

==== Local trains ====
The Stockholm commuter rail &quot;(Pendeltåg)&quot; provides service to Arlanda Airport via Arlanda Central station. It connects the airport to Stockholm County and Uppsala, with a travel time of approximately 38 minutes to Stockholm Central and 18 minutes to Uppsala Central. Due to an exit fare levied by the privately operated Arlanda Line, fares from Arlanda Central Station are higher than typical SL journeys.

Proposals have been made to extend the Roslagsbanan local railway to Arlanda Airport, to improve connectivity to north-eastern Stockholm, including areas such as Danderyd, Täby, and Vallentuna. As of 2024, there has been no formal decision to extend the Roslagsbanan to Arlanda.

=== Bus ===

==== Coach services ====
The main bus terminal at Arlanda Airport is situated outside Terminal 4. Flygbussarna offers regular departures to central Stockholm. Several other operators provide services to and from the airport, including Flixbus, SL, UL, and Vy bus4you. Flixbus and Vy bus4you run long-distance coach services to various destinations across Sweden.

==== Local buses ====

* SL: SL operates limited bus routes to Arlanda within Stockholm County, including to Märsta railway station, as well as night busses to central Stockholm.
* UL: UL buses connect Arlanda to nearby Uppsala County.

=== Road ===
The E4 motorway passes by Arlanda Airport, connecting it to central Stockholm, Uppsala, and northern Sweden. The airport offers near-terminal, short-term, and long-term parking options. Rental car facilities are also available at Arlanda.

=== Taxi ===
Taxis at Arlanda Airport are regulated by Swedavia, the airport operator. Only approved taxi companies with agreements are permitted to operate from designated areas outside Terminals 2 and 5. Non-approved taxis operate from elsewhere around the airport .

==Environment==

There is an ongoing work to limit Arlanda&#x27;s negative impact on the environment. In an effort to save electricity, buildings at Arlanda use district heating with biofuels and district cooling with water from a nearby lake. The take off charges for aircraft are partly based on the environmental performance of the aircraft and Arlanda is experimenting with Continuous Descent Approaches and landings, often referred to as &quot;green landings&quot;. Jet fuel is since around 2006 delivered by boat to Gävle and via train to Brista close to Märsta and from there through pipeline. Previously fuel was delivered by ship to Värtahamnen in Stockholm and then by trucks through Stockholm city to Arlanda. The airport also takes measures to promote the use of bio fuel in taxis operating to and from the airport.

One of the most interesting eco-friendly systems Stockholm Arlanda Airport uses is their unique heating and cooling system for their hangar, terminals, and other buildings on the airfield. There innovative system uses a series of wells, linked to a large underground aquifer. The water from the underground source is plumbed up and into the facilities air system, which controls the temperature of the air coming from the vents. In the summertime, the underground water remains cooler than the surface. That allows the terminals to be cooled off without using extra energy that an air conditioner would require. Then, in the winter months, the underground water remains warmer than the surface. The water is then plumbed to a control/heating unit, which uses biofuel to heat the water to a temperature appropriate for warming up the buildings.

The heated water is also used to heat pads of cement on the ramp and near the large hangar doors, efficiently keeping the doors and ramps clear of ice. After the water is run through the system, it is then all replaced back into the aquifer to be used again. The unique aquifer system is one of Arlanda&#x27;s most defining environmentally friendly designs.

==Incidents and accidents==
*1 November 1969: A Linjeflyg Convair 440 registered as &quot;SE-BSU&quot; suffered an accident while being used for training purposes. After a simulated engine failure at takeoff the left wing contacted the ground and the aircraft crash-landed after the nose and main landing gear collapsed. None of the four persons on board were killed, but the aircraft was written off.
* 5 January 1970: A Spantax Convair 990 registered as &quot;EC-BNM&quot; on a ferry flight from Stockholm Arlanda Airport to Zurich Airport (ZRH) crashed while climbing after take-off. The aircraft had been scheduled for a charter flight earlier in the day, but the flight was cancelled after the no. 4 engine developed trouble. The decision was made to ferry the aircraft using three engines to Zurich for repairs and the aircraft departed at 10:54 p.m. from runway 19 (currently runway 19R). The aircraft contacted trees approximately from the point of lift-off. Five of the 10 passengers and crew on board were killed and the aircraft was written off.
*14 July 1973: A Sterling Airways Sud Aviation Caravelle registered as &quot;OY-SAN&quot; taxied into an obstruction and was written off as being damaged beyond repair.
*25 January 1974: Scandinavian Airlines Sud Aviation Caravelle registered as &quot;OY-KRA&quot; was damaged beyond repair and written off.
*26 May 1977: An Antonov 24 belonging to Aeroflot registered as &quot;SSSR-46806&quot; on a scheduled flight from Donetsk Airport (DOK) to Riga Airport (RIX) was hijacked by a single hijacker who demanded to be taken to Sweden where the hijacker surrendered releasing the 23 passengers and crew.
*27 February 1979: An Aeroflot Tupolev 154 on a flight from Oslo to Stockholm with a continuation to Moscow was taken over by three hijackers. After landing in Stockholm they were overpowered by the aircraft&#x27;s crew.
*6 January 1987: A Transwede Sud Aviation Caravelle registered as &quot;SE-DEC&quot; on a non-scheduled flight from Stockholm–Arlanda Airport to Alicante Airport (ALC) encountered problems after take-off most likely caused by ice. The aircraft hit the runway hard causing the landing gear to fail and the aircraft slid off the runway and caught fire. None of the 27 passengers and crew was killed but the aircraft was written off and subsequently used by the airport&#x27;s ARFF as a fire and rescue training aircraft.
*19 January 1988: A Scanair DC-8 charter plane on its way from the Canary Islands to Oslo, Norway, was diverted to Arlanda after systemic failure of its hydraulic system. The captain feared that the longest landing strip at Oslo airport would not be long enough for the plane to come to a safe stop, and chose Arlanda since its 01-19 runway at the time was the longest in Scandinavia. The plane had 263 passengers and crew members onboard. The SOS response central called a regional disaster alarm in preparation for the plane&#x27;s arrival, with fire and rescue services from Arlanda Airport, Märsta, Rosersberg, Sigtuna, and Uppsala being called out. The plane tilted dangerously back and forth upon final approach, but eventually made a safe landing. Arlanda Airport rescue units approached the plane, ready to attend to injured passengers, but other than shock and trauma, no physical injuries were reported. 
*27 December 1991: Scandinavian Airlines Flight 751, a McDonnell Douglas MD-81, registered as &quot;OY-KHO&quot;, a scheduled flight from Stockholm–Arlanda Airport to Warsaw-Frederic Chopin Airport (WAW) with a stopover at Copenhagen-Kastrup Airport (CPH) crashed shortly after take-off because of a dual engine failure when clear ice, which had formed during the night, was not properly removed during de-icing, broke off and was ingested into the engines. None of the 129 passengers and crew was killed but the aircraft was written off.
* 20 February 1993: A hijacker on board an Aeroflot Tupolev 134 on a scheduled flight between Tyumen Airport (TJM) and Saint Petersburg-Pulkovo Airport (LED) demanded to be taken to the United States. The aircraft first made a refueling stop in Tallinn where 30 passengers were released, and the aircraft was flown to Stockholm, where the hijacker demanded a larger aircraft to be flown to the U.S. After having released 12 more passengers, the hijacker, who was accompanied by his wife and child, surrendered, releasing the remaining 40 passengers and crew.
* 7 October 1997: A BAC One-Eleven belonging to Tarom registered as &quot;YR-BCM&quot; on a scheduled flight from Bucharest-Otopeni International Airport (OTP) to Stockholm–Arlanda Airport suffered a failure of the nosewheel steering after touching down heavily on runway 26. As the airplane slowed down the commander discovered that he could not control the aircraft, which left the runway and continued into the grassy area to on the right side. The aircraft slowed down softly and when it came to a stop the passengers and crew were able to disembark using the normal exits. The aircraft was written off and taken to Halmstad by Le Caravelle Club to be used as a fire trainer.
* 8 October 1999: A Saab 2000 belonging to SAS Commuter registered as &quot;SE-SLF&quot; called &quot;Eir Viking&quot; ran into a closed hangar door. At the time it was supposedly being taxied by two engineers or technicians. The two people on board received some injuries and the aircraft was written off.
* 25 September 2010: a PIA Boeing 777-200LR registered as &quot;AP-BGY&quot;, flying from Toronto to Karachi, made an emergency landing at Stockholm Arlanda Airport after a phone call was made claiming a named passenger on board was armed with explosives. After the plane landed in Stockholm, it was parked at an emergency stand and the suspected passenger was removed from the plane by Swedish authorities. The rest of the passengers were also removed and the empty aircraft was searched. The plane and passengers were allowed to depart Sweden while the suspect was detained in the country for further investigation but later released after no evidence was found of the allegation made against him.

<doc id="164053" wikidata="Q57464" url="?curid=164053" title="Abdullah II of Jordan">
<text>Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein (born 30 January 1962) is King of Jordan, having ascended the throne on 7 February 1999. He is a member of the Hashemites, who have been the reigning royal family of Jordan since 1921, and is considered a direct descendant of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.

Abdullah was born in Amman, as the first child of King Hussein and his wife, Princess Muna. As the king&#x27;s eldest son, Abdullah was heir apparent until Hussein transferred the title to Abdullah&#x27;s uncle Prince Hassan in 1965. Abdullah began his schooling in Amman, continuing his education abroad. He began his military career in 1980 as a training officer in the Jordanian Armed Forces, later assuming command of the country&#x27;s Special Forces in 1994, eventually becoming a major general in 1998. In 1993, Abdullah married Rania Al-Yassin, with whom he has four children: Crown Prince Hussein, Princess Iman, Princess Salma and Prince Hashem. A few weeks before his death in 1999, King Hussein named Abdullah his heir, and Abdullah succeeded his father.

Abdullah, a constitutional monarch with wide executive and legislative powers, liberalized the economy when he assumed the throne, and his reforms led to an economic boom which continued until 2008. During the following years Jordan&#x27;s economy experienced hardship as it dealt with the effects of the Great Recession and spillover from the Arab Spring. In 2011, large-scale protests demanding reform erupted in the Arab world, which led to civil wars in some countries. Abdullah responded quickly to domestic unrest by replacing the government and introducing reforms. Proportional representation was reintroduced to the Jordanian parliament for the 2016 election, a move which he said would eventually lead to establishing parliamentary government, but government critics remained skeptical, viewing the reforms as cosmetic changes. The reforms took place amid unprecedented challenges stemming from regional instability, including an influx of 1.4 million Syrian refugees.

Abdullah is known for promoting interfaith dialogue and a moderate understanding of Islam. The longest-serving current Arab leader, he is custodian of the Muslim and Christian religious sites in Jerusalem, a position held by his dynasty since 1924. The 2021 Pandora Papers revealed Abdullah&#x27;s vast hidden wealth through offshore entities, countered by the Royal Court citing privacy and security reasons, attributing the funds to inherited wealth.

==Early life==
Abdullah was born on 30 January 1962 at Palestine Hospital in Al Abdali, Amman, to King Hussein and Hussein&#x27;s British-born second wife, Princess Muna Al-Hussein (born Toni Avril Gardiner). He is the namesake of his paternal great-grandfather, Abdullah I, who founded modern Jordan. Abdullah&#x27;s dynasty, the Hashemites, ruled Mecca for over 700 years—from the 10th century until the House of Saud conquered Mecca in 1925—and have ruled Jordan since 1921. The Hashemites are the oldest ruling dynasty in the Muslim world. According to family tradition, Abdullah is the 41st-generation agnatic descendant of Muhammad&#x27;s daughter Fatimah and her husband, Ali, the fourth Rashidun caliph.

As Hussein&#x27;s eldest son, Abdullah became heir apparent to the Jordanian throne under the 1952 constitution. Political instability caused King Hussein to appoint an adult heir in his place, choosing Abdullah&#x27;s uncle Prince Hassan in 1965. Abdullah began his schooling in 1966 at the Islamic Educational College in Amman, and continued at St Edmund&#x27;s School in England. He attended middle school at Eaglebrook School and high school at Deerfield Academy in the United States. He was the commencement speaker at Deerfield Academy&#x27;s class of 2000 graduation.

Abdullah has four brothers and six sisters: Princess Alia, Prince Faisal, Princess Aisha, Princess Zein, Princess Haya, Prince Ali, Prince Hamzah, Prince Hashem, Princess Iman and Princess Raiyah; seven of them are paternal half-siblings.

==Military career==

He began his military career at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in England in 1980, while he was a training officer in the Jordanian Armed Forces. After Sandhurst, Abdullah was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the British Army and served a year in Britain and West Germany as a troop commander in the 13th/18th Royal Hussars (now the Light Dragoons).

Abdullah was admitted to Pembroke College, Oxford, in 1982, where he completed a one-year special-studies course in Middle Eastern affairs. He joined the Royal Jordanian Army on his return home, serving as first lieutenant and then as platoon commander and assistant commander of a company in the 40th Armored Brigade. Abdullah took a free-fall parachuting course in Jordan, and in 1985 he took the Armored Officer&#x27;s Advanced Course at Fort Knox. He became commander of a tank company in the 91st Armored Brigade, with the rank of captain. Abdullah also served with the Royal Jordanian Air Force&#x27;s anti-tank helicopter wing, receiving training to fly Cobra attack-helicopters.

The prince then attended the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., in 1987, undertaking advanced study and research in international affairs. He returned home to serve as assistant commander of the 17th Royal Tank Battalion in 1989, later being promoted to major. Abdullah attended a staff course at the British Staff College in 1990, and served the following year in the Office of the Inspector General of the Jordanian Armed Forces as the Armored Corps representative. He commanded a battalion in the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment in 1992 and was promoted to colonel the following year, commanding the 40th Brigade.

Abdullah met Rania Al-Yassin, a marketing employee at Apple Inc. in Amman, at a dinner organized by his sister Princess Aisha in January 1993. They became engaged two months later, and their marriage took place in June.

In 1994, Abdullah assumed command of Jordan&#x27;s Special Forces and of other elite units as a brigadier general, restructuring them into the Joint Special Operations Command two years later. He became a major general, attended a course in defence-resources management at the American Naval Postgraduate School and commanded an elite special-forces manhunt in the pursuit of outlaws in 1998. The operation reportedly ended successfully, with his name chanted on the streets of Amman.

==Reign==
===Accession and enthronement===

Abdullah joined his father on a number of missions, including meetings abroad with Soviet and American leaders. He was occasionally King Hussein&#x27;s regent during the 1990s but this duty was mainly performed by Hussein&#x27;s younger brother, Crown Prince Hassan. Abdullah led his father&#x27;s delegation to Moscow for talks in 1987. He frequently visited the Pentagon in Washington, where he lobbied for increased military assistance to Jordan. The prince joined his father on trips to visit Hafez al-Assad in Damascus and Saddam Hussein in Baghdad (before the 1990 Gulf War). Abdullah commanded military exercises during Israeli military officials&#x27; visits to Jordan in 1997, and was sent to hand-deliver a message to Muammar Gaddafi in 1998.

King Hussein frequently traveled to the US for medical treatment after his diagnosis with cancer in 1992. After Hussein returned from a six-month medical absence from Jordan in late 1998, he criticized his brother Hassan&#x27;s management of Jordanian affairs in a public letter, accusing him of abusing his constitutional powers as regent. On 24 January 1999, two weeks before his death, Hussein surprised everyone—including Abdullah who thought he would spend his life in the military—by replacing Hassan with his son as heir apparent.

The king died of complications of non-Hodgkin lymphoma on 7 February 1999. His 47-year reign extended through four turbulent decades of the Arab–Israeli conflict and the Cold War. Several hours after the announcement of his father&#x27;s death, Abdullah appeared at an emergency session of the Jordanian parliament. Hussein&#x27;s two brothers, Hassan and Mohammed, walked ahead of him as he entered the assembly. In Arabic, he swore the oath taken by his father almost fifty years earlier: &quot;I swear by Almighty God to uphold the constitution and to be faithful to the nation&quot;. Speaker of the Senate Zaid Al-Rifai opened the session with Al-Fatiha (the opening chapter of the Quran), his voice cracking with emotion as he led the recitation. &quot;God, save His Majesty... God, give him advice and take care of him.&quot; Abdullah&#x27;s investiture took place on 9 June 1999. A reception at Raghadan Palace attended by 800 dignitaries followed a motorcade ride through Amman by the 37-year-old king and his 29-year-old wife, Rania—the then youngest queen in the world.

===First year===
As king, Abdullah retains wider executive and legislative authority than is normally the case for a constitutional monarch. He is one of the few monarchs in the world who both rules and reigns. He is head of state and commander-in-chief of the Jordanian Armed Forces and appoints the prime minister and the directors of security agencies. The prime minister is free to choose his cabinet. The Parliament of Jordan consists of two chambers: the appointed Senate and the elected House of Representatives, which serve as a check on the government. However, according to Freedom House, most seats in the House are held by pro-palace independents, and the crown&#x27;s authority is such that it is extremely difficult for a party to win power solely via the ballot box. The Senate is appointed by the king, and the House of Representatives is directly elected.

When Abdullah ascended to the throne as Jordan&#x27;s fourth king, observers doubted his ability to manage the country&#x27;s economic crisis—a legacy of the 1990 Gulf War. The king maintained his father&#x27;s moderate pro-Western policy, supporting the 1994 Israel–Jordan peace treaty, and the royal transition prompted the United States and Arab states of the Persian Gulf to increase their aid. In the early years of Abdullah&#x27;s reign, which then ruled over a population of 4.5 million, it was reported that he frequently went undercover to see Jordan&#x27;s challenges firsthand. In 2000 he said about his incognito visits to government institutions, &quot;The bureaucrats are terrified. It&#x27;s great.&quot;

Abdullah cracked down on the Hamas presence in Jordan in November 1999 after pleas from the United States, Israel and the Palestinian Authority. The crackdown occurred during peace talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. The king exiled four Hamas officials to Qatar and barred the group from political activity, closing their offices in Amman. The peace talks collapsed into a violent Palestinian uprising, the Second Intifada, in September 2000. As a result, Jordan faced dwindling tourism; tourism is an economic cornerstone of Jordan, a country with few natural resources. Abdullah reportedly spearheaded efforts to defuse the political violence.

On 23 June 2000, while vacationing in the Greek Islands, Abdullah received a phone call from the director of Mukhabarat (the country&#x27;s Intelligence Directorate) warning of an assassination attempt against him by Al-Qaeda. The plot was to target Abdullah and his family&#x27;s rented yacht with explosives. The September 11 attacks in 2001 on American targets were fiercely condemned by Abdullah. Jordan responded quickly to American requests for assistance, enacting counterterrorism legislation and maintaining a high level of vigilance. The country&#x27;s Mukhabarat foiled similar plots the following year against Western targets, including the American and British embassies in Lebanon.
With the George W. Bush administration planning an attack on Iraq, accusing Saddam Hussein of possessing weapons of mass destruction, Abdullah opposed American intervention. &quot;A strike on Iraq will be disastrous for Iraq and the region as a whole and will threaten the security and stability of the Middle East&quot;, he warned during American vice president Dick Cheney&#x27;s 2002 visit to the Middle East. In March 2003, during a meeting with George W. Bush at the White House, Abdullah tried to dissuade the president from invading Iraq. During the 1990 Gulf War, King Hussein&#x27;s wariness of war was seen as siding with Saddam Hussein, which alienated Jordan from its Arab allies in the Persian Gulf region and the Western world; his stance precipitated an economic crisis triggered by the suspension of foreign aid and investment to Jordan. Failing to persuade Bush, Abdullah broke with domestic opposition. He allowed American Patriot batteries to be stationed in the Jordanian desert along its border with Iraq, but did not allow coalition troops to launch an invasion from Jordan. Jordan had received subsidized oil from Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraq at a savings of about $500 million per year, equal to American aid to Jordan at the time.

The 2003 Jordanian general election was the first parliamentary election under Abdullah&#x27;s rule. Although the election was supposed to be held in 2001, it was postponed by the king due to regional political instability in accordance with the Jordanian constitution (which authorizes the monarch to postpone an election for a maximum of two years). His postponement was criticized by the largest Islamist opposition party in the country, the Islamic Action Front (the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood), who accused Abdullah of impeding the democratic process. He inherited a controversial single non-transferable vote electoral system, implemented by his father in 1991, which hobbled Islamic political parties after they obtained 22 of 80 seats in the 1989 elections. Abdullah issued a royal decree before the election, introducing an amendment to the election law giving women a six-seat quota in Parliament.

In 2004, Abdullah coined the term &quot;Shia Crescent&quot; to describe a Shia-dominated region from Damascus to Tehran (bypassing Baghdad) which promoted sectarian politics. His warning received international attention, leading Abdullah to clarify that he meant a shift in political (not sectarian) alignment. The king&#x27;s observation was validated after the rise of Shia Nouri Al-Maliki to the Iraqi government in 2006 and subsequent events.
Al-Qaeda in Iraq founder Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi claimed responsibility for a terrorist attack in Amman on 9 November 2005. It was the deadliest attack in Jordan&#x27;s history; suicide bombers targeted three hotels, one of which was hosting a wedding. The attack killed 60 people and injured 115. Prior to the attack, Al-Zarqawi had threatened: &quot;What is coming is more vicious and bitter&quot;. In 2006, Al-Zarqawi was killed in an airstrike with the aid of Jordanian intelligence agents. Abdullah and Jordan are viewed with contempt by Islamic extremists for the country&#x27;s peace treaty with Israel and its relationship with the West. Jordan&#x27;s security was tightened, and no major terrorist attacks have been reported in the country since then.

Russian president Vladimir Putin visited Jordan for the first time in February 2007 and was welcomed by Abdullah. The leaders discussed prospects for the Israeli–Palestinian peace process, Iran&#x27;s nuclear program and violence in Iraq.

Abdullah established King&#x27;s Academy near Madaba, the Middle East&#x27;s first boarding school, in 2007 in appreciation of the education he received at Deerfield Academy. He hired Deerfield headmaster Eric Widmer to oversee the school, which has students from throughout the region.

In 2007, it was reported that Jordan hosted 800,000 Iraqi refugees who fled the insurgency following the American invasion; most have returned to Iraq. The 2007 Jordanian general election was held in November, with secular opposition groups accusing the government of using rising Islamism as an excuse for &quot;autocratic rule&quot;. In 2008, Abdullah became the first Arab head of state to visit Iraq after the 2003 American invasion. The visit was amid Sunni Arab concerns of growing Iranian influence in Iraq.

=== 2010s ===

====Arab Spring 2010–2014====
The Tunisian Revolution in December 2010 (which unseated that country&#x27;s president) brought Egyptians into the streets, and by January 2011 they overthrew president Hosni Mubarak. Protests in other Arab countries soon followed, resulting in civil wars in Libya, Syria and Yemen. In Jordan, opposition groups including the Muslim Brotherhood, leftists, and retired army generals protested throughout the country. By 1 February 2011, domestic unrest prompted Abdullah to sack Samir Rifai&#x27;s government and pledge to follow a democratic trajectory.
The 2011–12 Jordanian protests were driven by complaints about a troubled economy: soaring prices, widespread unemployment and a relatively low standard of living. Although some called for an end to the monarchy, most protesters&#x27; anger was directed at politicians viewed as undemocratic, corrupt and unaccountable. Demonstrators called for the dissolution of the parliament which had been elected three months earlier in November 2010, when pro-regime figures won a majority of seats. The Jordanian monarchy was the first Arab regime to offer political concessions during the Arab Spring. Marouf Bakhit was appointed prime minister, but protests continued throughout the summer; Bakhit was seen as a conservative unlikely to push for reform. Dissatisfied with the pace of reform, Abdullah sacked Bakhit&#x27;s government and appointed Awn Khasawneh to form a cabinet. Khasawneh abruptly resigned in April 2012, and the King appointed Fayez Tarawneh as interim prime minister; it was the third government reshuffle in 18 months.

In November 2012, the government cut fuel subsidies, driving up prices. The decision, later revoked, triggered large-scale protests across the country. The regime calmed the unrest by introducing reforms, amending about one-third of the constitution and establishing a Constitutional Court and the Independent Election Commission. Abdullah called for an early parliamentary election and appointed Abdullah Ensour to form a cabinet of intermittent government. In the January 2013 election, pro-regime figures were victorious as opposition groups continued a boycott, with Islamic Action Front claiming earlier that election was performed in absence of actual opposition. Since December 2012, the king has published seven discussion papers outlining his vision of democracy and reform in Jordan.

==== West Bank ====
In December 2012, Abdullah was the first head of state to visit the West Bank after a United Nations General Assembly vote upgraded the Palestinian Authority to a nonmember observer state. Jordan sees an independent Palestinian state, with the 1967 borders, as part of the two-state solution and of supreme national interest. Jordan, the only country bordering the West Bank other than Israel, ruled it after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and lost in the 1967 Six-Day War. Its annexation of the West Bank was not recognized, and in 1988 the kingdom ceded its claim to the territory.

An interview with Abdullah by Jeffrey Goldberg, published in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; in March 2013, sparked controversy when the king criticized local and international figures and parties. He called the Muslim Brotherhood a &quot;Masonic cult&quot; and &quot;wolves in sheep&#x27;s clothing&quot;, described ousted Egyptian president Mohammad Morsi as a man with &quot;no depth&quot; and said that Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan saw democracy as &quot;a bus ride&quot;. Abdullah also criticized American diplomats, some of his country&#x27;s tribal leaders and members of his family.

Another 2013 article in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; advised him to address governmental corruption, saying that there &quot;is a growing perception that the degeneracy reaches the palace&quot;. According to the article, Abdullah was accused of &quot;illegally appropriating &#x27;tribal&#x27; lands&quot; shortly after his accession and members of 36 Jordanian tribes issued a statement denouncing Queen Rania&#x27;s &quot;publicized and extravagant&quot; 43rd birthday party in 2013.

====Regional turmoil 2014–2019====

The March 2011 outbreak of the Syrian Civil War forced masses of refugees across Jordan&#x27;s border with Syria, about 3,000 refugees per day in the war&#x27;s early stages. When asked about the Syrian conflict in an interview with the BBC in November 2011, Abdullah said that he would resign if he was in Bashar al-Assad&#x27;s shoes. &quot;Whenever you exert violence on your own people, it&#x27;s never going to end well and so as far as I&#x27;m concerned, yes, there will be an expiration date, but again it is almost impossible for anybody to predict whether that is six weeks, six months or six years.&quot;

About the unrest in Iraq, Abdullah told a delegation of US congressmen in June 2014 about his fear that the turmoil would spill across the entire region. He said that any solution to the problems in the war-torn countries must involve all the people of Iraq and Syria. Jordan began erecting barriers along its arid border with Iraq and border with Syria. Since then, hundreds of infiltration attempts have been foiled by Jordanian border guards who were also occupied with the flow of refugees. Jordan was involved in the CIA-led Timber Sycamore covert operation to train and arm Syrian rebels.

In April 2014, the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), an al-Qaeda affiliate which emerged in early 2014 when it drove Iraqi government forces out of key cities, posted an online video which threatened to invade the kingdom and slaughter Abdullah (whom they saw as an enemy of Islam). &quot;I have a message to the tyrant of Jordan: we are coming to you with death and explosive belts&quot;, an ISIL fighter said as he destroyed a Jordanian passport. In August 2014, thousands of Iraqi Christians fled ISIL and sought shelter in Jordanian churches. 
Shortly after Jordan joined the international coalition against ISIL in mid-September 2014, the country&#x27;s security apparatus foiled a terror plot targeting civilians in Jordan. Shortly afterwards, Abdullah said in an interview that the country&#x27;s borders with Iraq and Syria were &quot;extremely safe&quot;. In late December 2014, a Jordanian F-16 fighter jet crashed near Raqqa, Syria, during a mission. A video was posted online on 3 February 2015, showing captured Jordanian pilot Muath Al-Kasasbeh being burned to death in a cage; throughout January, Jordan had negotiated for Al-Kasasbeh&#x27;s release. The terrorist group reportedly demanded the release of Sajida al-Rishawi in return, a suicide bomber whose belt failed to detonate in the 2005 Amman bombings. Al-Kasasbeh&#x27;s killing spurred outrage in the country, while the King was away in a state visit to the United States. Before returning to Jordan, Abdullah swiftly ratified death sentences previously handed down to two imprisoned Iraqi jihadists, Sajida al-Rishawi and Ziad Al-Karbouly, who were executed before dawn of the next day. The same evening, Abdullah was welcomed in Amman by cheering crowds who lined along the airport road to express their support. His decision also garnered international support. As commander-in-chief, Abdullah launched Operation Martyr Muath, a series of airstrikes against ISIL targets during the following week targeting weapons caches, training camps and oil-extraction facilities. His retaliation was praised on the Internet, where he was dubbed &quot;The Warrior King&quot;. Rumors had circulated that he personally led the sorties, although the government officially denied this.

During a January 2016 BBC interview, Abdullah said that Jordan is at the &quot;boiling point&quot; because of the Syrian refugee influx, Jordan claims more than a million Syrians have sought refuge in Jordan. The king noted pressure on the country&#x27;s economy, infrastructure and services. &quot;Sooner or later, I think, the dam is going to burst&quot;, he warned. Jordan has historically welcomed refugees—Palestinians in 1948 and 1967, Iraqis during the American invasion and now Syrians, who make up about 20 percent of Jordan&#x27;s then 9.5 million population—and, according to Abdullah, &quot;For the first time, we can&#x27;t do it any more.&quot; 
The November 2016 Jordanian general election was the first election since 1989 primarily using a form of proportional representation; intervening elections had used the single non-transferable vote system. Reforms encouraged opposition parties, including the Islamic Action Front (who had boycotted previous elections, including 2010 and 2013), to participate. The election was considered fair and transparent by independent international observers. Proportional representation is seen as the first step toward establishing parliamentary governments in which parliamentary blocs, instead of the king, choose the prime minister. However, the underdevelopment of political parties in Jordan have slowed down such moves.

Abdullah established a close cooperation between Jordan and the International Labour Organization (ILO). Between 2013 and 2015, the ILO started programs in Jordan to support working opportunities for refugees in Jordan. In 2016, Jordan signed the Jordan Compact, which improved legal employments opportunities for refugees.

After Donald Trump&#x27;s inauguration as United States president on 20 January 2017, Abdullah traveled to the US on an official visit. He was worried about the new administration&#x27;s positions on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, specifically, issues relating to Israeli settlements. Abdullah met Trump briefly at the National Prayer Breakfast on 2 February, and reportedly convinced him to change his policy towards Israeli settlements. This was substantiated by White House press secretary Sean Spicer, who said two days later that the expansion of Israeli settlements may not be helpful in achieving peace. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the &quot;encounter put the king, one of the most respected leaders of the Arab world, ahead of Mr. Netanyahu in seeing the new president.&quot; Senator Bob Corker confirmed Abdullah&#x27;s influence in an interview: &quot;We call him the Henry Kissinger of that part of the world and we do always love to listen to his view of the region.&quot; Abdullah criticized United States&#x27; decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

On 4 June 2018, Prime Minister Hani Al-Mulki resigned from office. Large protests against corruption, the economic policies and austerity plans as well as the tax increases, occurred before Hani Al-Mulki resigned. Abdullah moved former education minister Omar Razzaz to the position of the new Prime Minister and ordered him to conduct a review of the controversial tax system.

On 25 June 2018, Abdullah made another official visit to Washington, DC. He was hosted by President Trump at the White House and they discussed &quot;terrorism, the threat from Iran and the crisis in Syria, and working towards a lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians&quot;. In August 2018, after the Trump administration had announced to end all US funding for UNRWA, Abdullah sought to replace the US funds. Jordan convened meetings of the Arab League and Western countries.

=== 2020s ===

In an interview with &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; in May 2020, Abdullah criticized Donald Trump&#x27;s plans for peace in the Middle East including Israel annexing parts of the West Bank. He stated, &quot;The two-state solution is the only way for us to be able to move forward&quot;, and noted a possible Israeli annexation of the West Bank causes conflicts. In October 2020, Omar Razzaz resigned from his position due to the criticism of his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, Abdullah dissolved the parliament and instructed his chief policy adviser, Bishr Al-Khasawneh, to form a new government as the new Prime Minister. After Joe Biden won the 2020 United States presidential election, Abdullah was the first Arab leader to congratulate Biden for his victory.

In April 2021, Abdullah ordered the arrest of his half-brother, Prince Hamzah bin Hussein, and twenty other courtiers for what was called &quot;sedition&quot;. Hamzah&#x27;s removal as crown prince by Abdullah has been cited as a possible factor. 18 other Jordanian figures were also arrested, including Abdullah&#x27;s controversial former Chief of Staff, former Saudi Arabian envoy and Royal Court Chief Bassem Awadallah. Royal family member Sharif Hassan Bin Zaid, who is hardly known in Jordan and whose father now resides in Saudi Arabia, was also among those arrested. On 7 April, King Abdullah II spoke publicly for the first time since the alleged coup and hinted that the Jordanian royal feud was over, stating that the &quot;sedition&quot; that caused him &quot;pain and anger&quot; was now buried and that Hamzah was now &quot;in his palace under my protection.&quot; Abdullah also stated that the crisis began when Jordan&#x27;s military chief of staff paid a visit to Hamzah and warned him to stop attending meetings with critics of the government.

On 19 July 2021, during a two-week visit to the US, Abdullah was received at the White House by President Joe Biden. They discussed the Middle East conflict, the battle against COVID-19, and the relationship between Jordan and the US. Abdullah was the first leader from the Middle East to visit the White House since Biden&#x27;s inauguration on 20 January 2021.

On 3 October 2021, Abdullah held a telephone conversation with Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, the first contact since the start of the Syrian civil war. They discussed bilateral relations after Amman fully opened borders with Syria.

In October 2023, Abdullah condemned Israel&#x27;s blockade of the Gaza Strip and the &quot;collective punishment&quot; of Palestinians in Gaza during the Israel–Hamas war. In February 2024, Abdullah called for an immediate ceasefire in the war, and called upon the US to restore funding to UNRWA. He also warned against the proposed Rafah offensive, arguing it would &quot;produce another humanitarian catastrophe&quot;. In conjunction with several other nations, Abdullah and the Jordanian government arranged for aid packages to delivered to Gaza via airdrop. A video filmed by Jordanian TV station Al-Mamlaka depicted Abdullah personally taking part in one of these airdrops, which delivered food aid and medical supplies to affected areas.

King Abdullah rejected President Donald Trump&#x27;s proposal for Jordan to absorb Palestinians living in Gaza. On 26 February 2025, he met with Syria&#x27;s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa in Amman. Abdullah condemned Israeli attacks on Syria.

==Administrative reforms==
===Economic===
King Abdullah proposed significant economic reforms to the country during the first decade of his reign. Jordan, a relatively-small, semi-arid, almost-landlocked country, has one of the smallest economies in the region; its GDP was about $39 billion in 2016. Insufficient natural resources, especially in water and oil (unlike its neighbors) have given the kingdom chronic government debt, unemployment and poverty which led to a dependence on foreign aid from its Western and Arab allies in the Persian Gulf region. Jordan embarked on an aggressive economic liberalization program when Abdullah was crowned in an effort to stimulate the economy and raise the standard of living, and its economy has improved under his reign. He has been credited with attracting foreign investment, improving public-private partnerships and providing the foundation for the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority and Jordan&#x27;s flourishing information and communications technology (ICT) sector. Abdullah set up five other special economic zones: Irbid, Ajloun, Mafraq, Ma&#x27;an and the Dead Sea. As a result of these reforms, Jordan&#x27;s economic growth doubled (to 8% annually) between 2004 and 2008 compared with the latter half of the 1990s. It also led to a steady increase in foreign investment by the West and the Persian Gulf countries.

Abdullah negotiated a free-trade agreement with the United States, the third free-trade agreement for the US and its first with an Arab country. Under the agreement, Jordanian exports to the United States increased from $63 million in 2000 to over $1.4 billion in 2015. Jordan&#x27;s foreign debt-to-GDP ratio fell from more than 210 percent in 1990 to 83 percent by the end of 2005, a decrease called an &quot;extraordinary achievement&quot; by the International Monetary Fund. Abdullah&#x27;s efforts have made Jordan the freest Arab economy and the ninth-freest economy in the world, according to a 2014 study by the Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Liberty.
The king launched a number of initiatives to provide housing for Jordanian citizens, including teachers and those serving in the armed forces. He established awards to encourage good citizenship, including the King Abdullah II Award for Physical Fitness, the King Abdullah II Award for Excellence in Government Performance and Transparency, the King Abdullah II Award for Excellence for the Private Sector and the King Abdullah II Award for Excellence for Business Associations. To combat unemployment, Abdullah established the National Vocational Training Council and formed a committee to develop a national strategy for developing human resources to produce a skilled workforce.

Jordan was dependent on subsidized Iraqi oil for its energy. The 2003 American invasion of Iraq halted the petroleum supply and drove Jordan to begin importing gas from Egypt in 2009. Insurgency in Sinai began when the Arab Spring spread to Egypt, where the Arab Gas Pipeline runs. Since 2011, the pipeline has been attacked over 30 times by ISIL&#x27;s Sinai affiliates, and the pipeline was effectively closed in 2014. Jordan incurred $6 billion in losses. The Great Recession and regional turmoil triggered by the Arab Spring during the 2010s hobbled the Jordanian economy, making it increasingly reliant on foreign aid. The shocks hit Jordan&#x27;s tourism sector (a cornerstone of the country&#x27;s economy) hardest, and tourist arrivals have fallen by over 66 percent since 2011. However, in 2017, tourism started to pick up again. Growth of the Jordanian economy slowed to an annual average rate of 2.8 percent between 2010 and 2016—down from an average of 8% in previous years—insufficient to accommodate the exponential growth of the population.

Jordan&#x27;s total foreign debt in 2012 was $22 billion, 72 percent of its GDP. In 2016, the debt reached $35.1 billion, 95 percent of the country&#x27;s GDP. The increase was attributed to regional challenges, which decreased tourist activity and foreign investment and increased military spending; attacks on the Egyptian pipeline; the collapse of trade with Iraq and Syria; the expense of hosting Syrian refugees, and accumulated loan interest. According to the World Bank, Syrian refugees cost Jordan more than $2.5 billion a year (six percent of its GDP and 25 percent of the government&#x27;s annual revenue). Foreign aid covers only a portion of these costs, 63 percent of which are borne by Jordan. An austerity program was adopted by the government which aims to reduce Jordan&#x27;s debt-to-GDP ratio to 77 percent by 2021.

===Political===

Abdullah was criticized during his early years for focusing on economic, rather than political reform. A committee was formed in February 2005 to formulate a blueprint for political reform in the country for the next decade. This National Agenda, finalized about nine months later, was never implemented. It included incorporating proportional representation into general elections, improving the judicial branch and respect for human rights, and tackling issues related to employment, welfare, education and infrastructure. The Agenda was reportedly never implemented due to conservative opposition. After the Arab Spring, a new election law in 2012 was enacted and used in the 2013 elections. It incorporated elements of proportional representation, and 27 of the 150 House of Representatives members could be elected accordingly. A number of political reforms were undertaken to curtail some of the king&#x27;s powers, including amending about one-third of the constitution, establishing a constitutional court and the Independent Election Commission and improvements to laws governing human rights and freedom of speech and assembly.

In 2014 and 2016, several constitutional amendments sparked controversy despite their overwhelming approval by senators and representatives. The amendments gave the king sole authority to appoint his crown prince, deputy, the chief and members of the constitutional court, the heads of the military and paramilitary forces and the country&#x27;s General Intelligence Director. Proponents said that the amendments solidified the separation of powers, while critics claimed they were unconstitutional.

Reforms introduced in the 2016 general election led Freedom House, a US-funded non-governmental organization, to upgrade Jordan to &quot;partly free&quot; from &quot;not free&quot; in its Freedom in the World 2017 report. According to the report, Jordan became the third most free Arab country, and that the change was &quot;due to electoral law changes that led to somewhat fairer parliamentary elections.&quot;

In September 2016, Abdullah formed a royal committee to make recommendations which would improve the country&#x27;s judiciary. The committee finalized its report, which revolved around strengthening judicial independence and improving criminal justice, in February 2017. The Parliament approved the recommendations which included increased protection for women against violence and better trial procedures. A new law for people with disabilities was also enacted. Human Rights Watch praised the reforms.

On 15 August 2017, local elections were held for municipal councils, local councils, and governorate councils, which were added by a new decentralization law. The law intends to cede some central-government power to elected councils, increasing citizen participation in municipal decision-making. In a 15 August 2016 interview, Abdullah described the new decentralization law as &quot;a very important link in the chain of reforms&quot;.

On 10 June 2021, Abdullah announced the introduction of a new committee of 92 members chaired by former prime minister Samir Rifai. The tasks of the committee are to modernise the political system and to propose new laws for local governments. On 4 October 2021, the committee handed over its recommendations to Abdullah. The committee proposed draft laws for political parties and elections, as well as 22 amendments to the Jordan constitution regarding parliamentary work and empowering women and youth. In November 2021, Abdullah ordered the government to push for political modernization. The Cabinet of Jordan submitted draft laws to the parliament following the committee&#x27;s recommendations. In December 2021, a parliamentary discussion on the constitutional amendment that would give more rights to women resulted into a fistfight between members of parliament. On 3 January 2022, the Jordan parliament passed an amendment to Article 40 of the constitution, which allows Abdullah to appoint or dismiss the chief justice, the head of the Sharia judicial council, the Grand Mufti of Jordan, the chief of the Royal Court, the minister of the court, and the advisors to the king. On 6 January 2022, Jordan parliament approved constitutional reforms by a majority of 104-8 including improvement of women&#x27;s rights, lowering the minimum age for elected deputies to 25 and the prime minister being elected by the assembly&#x27;s largest single party.

===Military===
Due to his military background, Abdullah believes in a powerful military and has followed a &quot;quality over quantity&quot; policy. During the first year of his reign he established the King Abdullah Design and Development Bureau (now Jordan Design and Development Bureau), whose goal is to &quot;provide an indigenous capability for the supply of scientific and technical services to the Jordanian Armed Forces&quot;. The company manufactures a wide variety of military products, which are presented at the biennial international Special Operations Forces Exhibition (SOFEX)—Abdullah is SOFEX&#x27;s patron. Abdullah modernized the army, leading Jordan to acquire advanced weaponry and increase and enhance its F-16 fighter-jet fleet. The King occasionally trains with the Jordanian army in live ammunition military drills.

===Energy sector===

Vandalism of the Egyptian pipeline supplying Jordan strained the country&#x27;s electrical company, whose debt increased substantially; this prompted Abdullah to urge the government to formulate a 10-year plan (2015–2025) to diversify the kingdom&#x27;s energy sources.

In 2007, Abdullah said that Jordan intends to benefit from its large uranium reserves by building nuclear reactors to generate electricity; the country is one of the few non-petroleum-producing nations in the region. Early on, in a 2010 interview, Abdullah accused Israel of trying to disrupt Jordan&#x27;s nuclear program. Abdullah inaugurated Jordan&#x27;s first nuclear facility in 2016. The Jordan Research and Training Reactor, in the Jordan University of Science and Technology near Ar Ramtha, aims to train Jordanian students in the school&#x27;s nuclear-engineering program. In 2018, the country&#x27;s Atomic Energy Commission announced that Jordan was in talks with multiple companies to build the first commercial nuclear plant, a Helium-cooled reactor that is scheduled for completion in 2025.

The country has 330 days of sunshine per year, and wind speeds exceed 7 m/s in mountainous areas. During the 2010s, Abdullah inaugurated the 117 MW Tafila Wind Farm and the 53 MW Shams Ma&#x27;an Power Plant. In May 2017, it was announced that more than 200 MW of solar energy projects had been completed. After having initially set the percentage of renewable energy Jordan aimed to generate by 2020 at 10%, the government announced in 2018 that it sought to beat that figure and aim for 20%. A report by pv magazine described Jordan as the &quot;Middle East&#x27;s solar powerhouse&quot;.

In 2014, a declaration of intent was signed by Jordan&#x27;s national electrical company and Noble Energy to import gas from Israel&#x27;s offshore Leviathan gas field, a 15-year deal estimated at $10 billion. The move provoked outrage by opponents, including the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, which said that the agreement favored Israel and its occupation of the West Bank and accused the government of ignoring renewable-energy options. The agreement, effective in 2019, was signed in September 2016. Separately, Abdullah opened a liquefied natural gas port in Aqaba in 2015, allowing Jordan to import LNG. LNG-generated electricity saves Jordan about $1 million a day, and is reportedly better for the environment.

==Religious affairs==
In response to Islamophobic rhetoric after the 11 September attacks, Abdullah issued the Amman Message in November 2004. The Message is a detailed statement which encouraged Muslim scholars of all sects from around the world to denounce terrorism, practice religious tolerance and represent the true nature of the Muslim faith. The statement was adopted unanimously in a conference hosted by Abdullah in Amman in 2005 by 200 leading Islamic scholars. The Message stressed three points: the validity of all eight schools of Islam, the forbidding of takfir (declaration of apostasy) and standards for the issuance of fatwas. The Islamic religious consensus was unprecedented in contemporary times. Abdullah presented the Message in 2010 to the United Nations General Assembly, where he proposed a World Interfaith Harmony Week. The initiative was adopted, and is an annual celebration during the first week of February to promote peace and harmony among people of different faiths. Abdullah also established an award, based on this initiative, for interfaith dialogue.
The Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem was under Jordanian rule from 1948 to 1967; it was under Hashemite custodianship since 1924, during the reign of Abdullah&#x27;s great-great-grandfather Sharif Hussein bin Ali. The legacy began when the Supreme Muslim Council, the highest body in charge of Muslim community affairs in Mandatory Palestine, accepted the sharif as custodian of the site. He restored the Jami’ Al-Aqsa and other mosques in Palestine. The sharif&#x27;s son, King Abdullah I, is said to have personally taken charge of efforts to extinguish a fire which engulfed the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in 1949. Jami’ Al-Aqsa and the Dome of the Rock were restored four times by the Hashemites during the 20th century, and the custodianship became a Hashemite legacy given by Jordanian kings. In 2013, an agreement was signed between the Palestinian Authority and Abdullah, replacing the decades-old verbal agreement which was reinforced by the 1994 Israel–Jordan peace treaty. Jordan recalled its ambassador to Israel in 2014 following tensions at Al-Aqsa Mosque between Israelis and Palestinians concerned about Jordan&#x27;s role in safeguarding Muslim and Christian sacred sites in Jerusalem. Abdullah met Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Amman in late 2014, and the Jordanian ambassador returned when Israeli authorities eased restrictions and revoked a decision that prevented men of all ages from praying at Al-Aqsa—for the first time in months.

In 2016, it was announced that Abdullah would fund the restoration of the Tomb of Jesus in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The Royal Hashemite Court informed Orthodox Patriarch Theophilos III of Jerusalem of the &quot;makruma&quot; (royal benefaction) in a 10 April 2016 letter. The tomb had been untouched since 1947, when the British installed steel support beams as part of a restoration project which never took place. It was reopened to the public on 22 March 2017 after the renovation. On 2 August 2017, Abdullah donated $1.4 million to the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf, the body that belongs to Jordan and is responsible for administering the Al-Aqsa mosque compound. An independent report estimates the total amount that the Hashemites have spent since 1924 on administering and renovating Jami’ Al Aqsa as over $1 billion.

In 2014, Abdullah received Pope Francis in Jordan, the third papal visit of his reign. The king, Queen Rania and Prince Ghazi accompanied the pope to Al-Maghtas, the site of Jesus&#x27; baptism, on the east bank of the Jordan River.

Abdullah led &quot;The 500 Most Influential Muslims&quot;″ 2016 list, published by the Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Center, and was third on its 2018 list. Queen Rania was 35th on the 2016 list.

Leaders of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre sent out a letter of support to Abdullah on 1 March 2018 after Israel shelved a proposed bill that aimed to propose new tax measures to churches in the West Bank. &quot;Your defence of religious freedom and Your leadership, in ensuring that the Status Quo is respected and maintained, has been crucial in our ongoing attempts to guard and protect the Christian presence especially in the Holy City of Jerusalem&quot;, the letter read.

==Successor==

On 28 November 2004, Abdullah removed the title of crown prince from his half-brother, Prince Hamzah, whom he had appointed on 7 February 1999 in accordance with their father&#x27;s advice. In a letter to Hamzah read on Jordanian state television, Abdullah said: &quot;Your holding this symbolic position has restrained your freedom and hindered our entrusting you with certain responsibilities that you are fully qualified to undertake.&quot; Although no successor to the title was named at that time, the king was expected to appoint his son and heir apparent, Prince Hussein, crown prince. Hussein received the title on 2 July 2009.

==Personal life==
King Abdullah met Rania Al-Yassin at a dinner party in January 1993. On 10 June 1993, they were married at Zahran Palace. King Abdullah and Queen Rania have four children: 
* Crown Prince Hussein (born 28 June 1994 at King Hussein Medical Center in Amman), married Rajwa Al Saif on 1 June 2023 at Zahran Palace in Amman, they have one daughter:
** Princess Iman bint Al Hussein (born 3 August 2024 at King Hussein Medical Center in Amman)
* Princess Iman (born 27 September 1996 at King Hussein Medical Center in Amman), married Jameel Alexander Thermiótis on 12 March 2023 at Beit Al Urdun Palace in Amman, they have one daughter:
** Amina Thermiótis (born 16 February 2025 at Prince Hashem bin Abdullah II Hospital in Aqaba)
* Princess Salma (born 26 September 2000 at King Hussein Medical Center in Amman)
* Prince Hashem (born 30 January 2005 at King Hussein Medical Center in Amman)

The ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed Al-Maktoum, was married to Abdullah&#x27;s half-sister Princess Haya.

Abdullah published an autobiography, &quot;Our Last Best Chance: The Pursuit of Peace in a Time of Peril&quot;, in 2010. He documents the first decade of his rule in a manner similar to his father&#x27;s 1962 book, &quot;Uneasy Lies the Head&quot;. Abdullah&#x27;s book contains insights into his childhood and behind-the-scenes accounts of encounters with political figures.

===Interests===
Abdullah has listed skydiving, motorcycling, water sports and collecting ancient weapons as his interests and hobbies, and is a fan of the science-fiction series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. In 1996, he appeared briefly in the &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; episode &quot;Investigations&quot;, in a non-speaking role.

The king promotes tourism in Jordan, and was a tour guide for Discovery Channel travel host Peter Greenberg on &quot;Jordan: The Royal Tour&quot;. In the program, Abdullah said that he is no longer permitted to skydive since he became king. He reportedly motorcycled through northern California on a Harley-Davidson. Prince Ali bin Al Hussein, one of Abdullah&#x27;s brothers and president of the Jordan Football Association, has said that the king is the Jordan national football team&#x27;s biggest fan. His interest in the film industry influenced his decision to create the Red Sea Institute of Cinematic Arts in the Red Sea coastal town of Aqaba on 20 September 2006, in partnership with the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts. When the producers of &quot;&quot; decided to film in Jordan, Abdullah called on military helicopters to help transport equipment into Petra. In 2016, the king honored the cast of &quot;Theeb&quot;, the first Jordanian film nominated for an Oscar.

Abdullah also enjoys stand-up comedy. When Gabriel Iglesias, Russell Peters and a number of other stand-up comedians visited Jordan for a 2009 comedy festival, the king invited them over for dinner. In 2013, a video of Abdullah helping push a car stuck in snow in Amman during the 2013 Middle East cold snap went viral. In 2017, another amateur video that went viral showed Abdullah wearing pyjamas helping in extinguishing a fire in a wood near the royal palace.

===Wealth===
Abdullah owns an international network of real estate properties, valued in excess of $100 million. His ownership of the properties was disguised through a series of offshore companies incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. Abdullah&#x27;s property empire was disclosed in the Pandora Papers leak, which revealed ownership of three contiguous oceanfront estates in the Point Dume area of Malibu, and properties in Washington, D.C., London and Ascot. His lawyers denied any misuse of public funds or tax evasion and stated that they were bought from the monarch&#x27;s private wealth and through offshore companies for security and privacy reasons. A 2022 Credit Suisse leak revealed that Abdullah owned six secret accounts, including one whose balance exceeded $224 million. A Royal Court statement said that the funds were a result of selling an Airbus A340 plane that belonged to his father the late King Hussein for $212 million, and that it was replaced with a smaller, less costly Gulfstream aircraft.

<doc id="164055" wikidata="Q937378" url="?curid=164055" title="Logarithmic scale">
<text>A logarithmic scale (or log scale) is a method used to display numerical data that spans a broad range of values, especially when there are significant differences between the magnitudes of the numbers involved. 

Unlike a linear scale where each unit of distance corresponds to the same increment, on a logarithmic scale each unit of length is a multiple of some base value raised to a power, and corresponds to the multiplication of the previous value in the scale by the base value. In common use, logarithmic scales are in base 10 (unless otherwise specified). 

A logarithmic scale is nonlinear, and as such numbers with equal distance between them such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are not equally spaced. Equally spaced values on a logarithmic scale have exponents that increment uniformly. Examples of equally spaced values are 10, 100, 1000, 10000, and 100000 (i.e., 101, 102, 103, 104, 105) and 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 (i.e., 21, 22, 23, 24, 25). 

Exponential growth curves are often depicted on a logarithmic scale graph. 

== Common uses ==
The markings on slide rules are arranged in a log scale for multiplying or dividing numbers by adding or subtracting lengths on the scales.

The following are examples of commonly used logarithmic scales, where a larger quantity results in a higher value:
* Richter magnitude scale and moment magnitude scale (MMS) for strength of earthquakes and movement in the Earth

* Sound level, with the unit decibel
* Neper for amplitude, field and power quantities
* Frequency level, with units cent, minor second, major second, and octave for the relative pitch of notes in music
* Logit for odds in statistics
* Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale
* Logarithmic timeline
* Counting f-stops for ratios of photographic exposure
* The rule of nines used for rating low probabilities 
* Entropy in thermodynamics
* Information in information theory
* Particle size distribution curves of soil
The following are examples of commonly used logarithmic scales, where a larger quantity results in a lower (or negative) value:
* pH for acidity
* Stellar magnitude scale for brightness of stars
* Krumbein scale for particle size in geology
* Absorbance of light by transparent samples

Some of our senses operate in a logarithmic fashion (Weber–Fechner law), which makes logarithmic scales for these input quantities especially appropriate. In particular, our sense of hearing perceives equal ratios of frequencies as equal differences in pitch. In addition, studies of young children in an isolated tribe have shown logarithmic scales to be the most natural display of numbers in some cultures. 
== Graphic representation ==

The top left graph is linear in the X- and Y-axes, and the Y-axis ranges from 0 to 10. A base-10 log scale is used for the Y-axis of the bottom left graph, and the Y-axis ranges from 0.1 to 1000.

The top right graph uses a log-10 scale for just the X-axis, and the bottom right graph uses a log-10 scale for both the X axis and the Y-axis.

Presentation of data on a logarithmic scale can be helpful when the data:
* covers a large range of values, since the use of the logarithms of the values rather than the actual values reduces a wide range to a more manageable size;
* may contain exponential laws or power laws, since these will show up as straight lines.

A slide rule has logarithmic scales, and nomograms often employ logarithmic scales. The geometric mean of two numbers is midway between the numbers. Before the advent of computer graphics, logarithmic graph paper was a commonly used scientific tool.

=== Log–log plots ===
If both the vertical and horizontal axes of a plot are scaled logarithmically, the plot is referred to as a log–log plot.

=== Semi-logarithmic plots ===

If only the ordinate or abscissa is scaled logarithmically, the plot is referred to as a semi-logarithmic plot.

=== Extensions ===
A modified log transform can be defined for negative input (&quot;y&quot; &lt; 0) to avoid the singularity for zero input (&quot;y&quot; = 0), and so produce symmetric log plots:
:formula_1
for a constant &quot;C&quot;=1/ln(10).

== Logarithmic units ==
A logarithmic unit is a unit that can be used to express a quantity (physical or mathematical) on a logarithmic scale, that is, as being proportional to the value of a logarithm function applied to the ratio of the quantity and a reference quantity of the same type. The choice of unit generally indicates the type of quantity and the base of the logarithm. 

=== Examples ===
Examples of logarithmic units include units of information and information entropy (nat, shannon, ban) and of signal level (decibel, bel, neper). Frequency levels or logarithmic frequency quantities have various units are used in electronics (decade, octave) and for music pitch intervals (octave, semitone, cent, etc.). Other logarithmic scale units include the Richter magnitude scale point.

In addition, several industrial measures are logarithmic, such as standard values for resistors, the American wire gauge, the Birmingham gauge used for wire and needles, and so on.

=== Units of information ===
* bit, byte
* hartley
* nat
* shannon

=== Units of level or level difference ===

* bel, decibel
* neper

==== Units of frequency level ====
* decade, decidecade, savart
* octave, tone, semitone, cent

=== Table of examples ===

The two definitions of a decibel are equivalent, because a ratio of power quantities is equal to the square of the corresponding ratio of root-power quantities.

<text>Gerhard &quot;Gerry&quot; Friedle (born 7 January 1971), better known by his stage name DJ Ötzi (), is an Austrian music producer and singer. Successful mainly in German-speaking countries, he is best known in the English-speaking world for his 2000 single &quot;Hey Baby (Uhh, Ahh)&quot;, a cover version of the Bruce Channel song &quot;Hey! Baby&quot;. His stage name comes from Ötzi the Iceman, the name given to the 5,300-year-old frozen remains of a mummified man discovered in 1991 in South Tyrol&#x27;s Ötztal Alps.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Ötzi was born Gerhard Friedle in St. Johann, Tirol, the son of Anton Friedle. Shortly after birth, his mother, aged 17 at the time, gave him up for adoption. He was raised by foster parents and later by his paternal grandparents in the nearby village of Erpfendorf in Tirol. At a young age, Ötzi suffered from epilepsy. At age 16, he was homeless and lived on the streets for a short time. His career rose gradually, first working as a student cook, then upon being discovered at a karaoke competition, went on to work as an entertainer (), DJ and singer in discothèques around Austria, as well as in tourist destinations Mallorca and Turkey. In 2002, before the birth of his daughter, Ötzi suffered a severe form of conductive hearing loss.

===Musical career===
====Debut album and early success====
In 1999, DJ Ötzi released the single &quot;Anton aus Tirol&quot;. The song was a massive hit in German-speaking countries, reaching number one in Austria and Germany, while it peaked at number two in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. The song spent 75 weeks in the Austrian charts and was number one for ten weeks. The success of the single propelled the release of the Anton (feat. DJ Ötzi) album &quot;Das Album&quot; in 2000.

====Second album and international recognition====
In July 2000, Ötzi released a cover version of Bruce Channel&#x27;s 1962 song &quot;Hey Baby&quot;. This single reached number-one in several English-speaking countries, including Australia, Ireland and the United Kingdom. He followed up this release with a cover version of &quot;Do Wah Diddy&quot;.

====Continued success====

In 2003, Ötzi released a cover version of &quot;A Ram Sam Sam&quot;, called the &quot;Burger Dance&quot;, which reached number-one in Germany, number 3 in Austria, and number 7 in Switzerland.

In 2006, he found success with the Volksmusik hit &quot;Sieben Sünden&quot;, which became a number 2 hit in Austria.

In 2007, he released &quot;Ein Stern (...der deinen Namen trägt)&quot; with Austrian Schlager singer Nik P. It reached number one in (Germany) where it stayed for 13 weeks and Austria, number 2 in Switzerland, and number 5 in the European Union, despite the fact that at the time of its release, some of the most popular radio stations in Austria and Germany declined to play the song because its genre did not fit their programme style. The single has sold more than 2 million copies. Spending 106 weeks on the German Singles Chart, it is the first song to be on that chart for two years or longer, and the longest running song ever on that chart.

<text>News style, journalistic style, or news-writing style is the prose style used for news reporting in media, such as newspapers, radio, and television.

News writing attempts to answer all the basic questions about any particular event—who, what, when, where, and why (the Five Ws) and often how—at the opening of the article. This form of structure is sometimes called the &quot;inverted pyramid&quot;, to refer to the decreasing importance of information in subsequent paragraphs.

News stories also contain at least one of the following important characteristics relative to the intended audience: proximity, prominence, timeliness, human interest, oddity, or consequence.

The related term journalese is sometimes used, usually pejoratively, to refer to news-style writing. Another is headlinese.

==Overview==
Newspapers generally adhere to an expository writing style. Over time and place, journalism ethics and standards have varied in the degree of objectivity or sensationalism they incorporate. It is considered unethical not to attribute a scoop to the journalist(s) who broke a story, even if they are employed by a rival organization. Definitions of professionalism differ among news agencies; their reputations, according to both professional standards and reader expectations, are often tied to the appearance of objectivity. In its most ideal form, news writing strives to be intelligible to the majority of readers, engaging, and succinct. Within these limits, news stories also aim to be comprehensive. However, other factors are involved, some stylistic and some derived from the media form.

Among the larger and more respected newspapers, fairness and balance is a major factor in presenting information. Commentary is usually confined to a separate section, though each paper may have a different overall slant. Editorial policies dictate the use of adjectives, euphemisms, and idioms. Newspapers with an international audience, for example, tend to use a more formal style of writing.

The specific choices made by a news outlet&#x27;s editor or editorial board are often collected in a style guide; common style guides include the &quot;AP Stylebook&quot; and the &quot;US News Style Book&quot;. The main goals of news writing can be summarized by the ABCs of journalism: accuracy, brevity, and clarity.

==Terms and structure==

Journalistic prose is explicit and precise and tries not to rely on jargon. As a rule, journalists will not use a long word when a short one will do. They use subject-verb-object construction and vivid, active prose (see Grammar). They offer anecdotes, examples and metaphors, and they rarely depend on generalizations or abstract ideas. News writers try to avoid using the same word more than once in a paragraph (sometimes called an &quot;echo&quot; or &quot;word mirror&quot;).

===Headline===

The &quot;headline&quot; (also &quot;heading&quot;, &quot;head&quot; or &quot;title&quot;, or &quot;hed&quot; in journalism jargon) of a story is typically a complete sentence (e.g., &quot;Pilot Flies Below Bridges to Save Divers&quot;), often with auxiliary verbs and articles removed (e.g., &quot;Remains at Colorado camp linked to missing Chicago man&quot;). However, headlines sometimes omit the subject (e.g., &quot;Jumps From Boat, Catches in Wheel&quot;) or verb (e.g., &quot;Cat woman lucky&quot;).

===Subhead===
A &quot;subhead&quot; (also &quot;subhed&quot;, &quot;sub-headline&quot;, &quot;subheading&quot;, &quot;subtitle&quot;, &quot;deck&quot; or &quot;dek&quot;) can be either a subordinate title under the main headline, or the heading of a subsection of the article. It is a heading that precedes the main text, or a group of paragraphs of the main text. It helps encapsulate the entire piece, or informs the reader of the topic of part of it. Long or complex articles often have more than one subheading. Subheads are thus one type of entry point that help readers make choices, such as where to begin (or stop) reading.

===Billboard===
An article &quot;billboard&quot; is capsule summary text, often just one sentence or fragment, which is put into a sidebar or text box (reminiscent of an outdoor billboard) on the same page to grab the reader&#x27;s attention as they are flipping through the pages to encourage them to stop and read that article. When it consists of a (sometimes compressed) sample of the text of the article, it is known as a &quot;call-out&quot; or &quot;callout&quot;, and when it consists of a quotation (e.g. of an article subject, informant, or interviewee), it is referred to as a &quot;pulled quotation&quot; or &quot;pull quote&quot;. Additional billboards of any of these types may appear later in the article (especially on subsequent pages) to entice further reading. Journalistic websites sometimes use animation techniques to swap one billboard for another (e.g. a slide of a call-out may be replaced by a photo with pull quote after some short time has elapsed). Such billboards are also used as pointers to the article in other sections of the publication or site, or as advertisements for the piece in other publication or sites.

===Lead===

The most important structural element of a story is the &quot;lead&quot; (also &quot;intro&quot; or &quot;lede&quot; in journalism jargon), comprising the story&#x27;s first, or leading, sentence or possibly two. The lead almost always forms its own paragraph. The spelling &quot;lede&quot; (, from Early Modern English) is also used in American English, originally to avoid confusion with the printing press type formerly made from the metal lead or the related typographical term &quot;leading&quot;.

Charnley states that &quot;an effective lead is a brief, sharp statement of the story&#x27;s essential facts.&quot; The lead is normally a single sentence, is ideally 20–25 words in length, and must balance the ideal of maximum information conveyed against the constraint of the unreadability of a long sentence. This makes writing a lead an optimization problem, in which the goal is to articulate the most encompassing and interesting statement that a writer can make in one sentence, given the material with which he or she has to work. While a rule of thumb says the lead should answer most or all of the five Ws, few leads can fit all of these.

Article leads are sometimes categorized into hard leads and soft leads. A &quot;hard lead&quot; aims to provide a comprehensive thesis which tells the reader what the article will cover. A &quot;soft lead&quot; introduces the topic in a more creative, attention-seeking fashion, and is usually followed by a nutshell paragraph (or nut graf), a brief summary of facts.

;Example of a hard-lead paragraph
:NASA is proposing another space project. The agency&#x27;s budget request, announced today, included a plan to send another mission to the Moon. This time the agency hopes to establish a long-term facility as a jumping-off point for other space adventures. The budget requests approximately $10 billion for the project.

;Example of a soft-lead sentence
:Humans will be going to the Moon again. The NASA announcement came as the agency requested $10 billion of appropriations for the project.

An &quot;off-lead&quot; is the second most important front page news of the day. The off-lead appears either in the top left corner, or directly below the lead on the right.

To &quot;bury the lead&quot; is to begin the article with background information or details of secondary importance to the readers, forcing them to read more deeply into an article than they should have to in order to discover the essential points. It is a common mistake in press releases, but a characteristic of an academic writing style, where its downsides are often mitigated by the inclusion of an abstract at the start of an article.

===Nutshell paragraph===

A &quot;nutshell paragraph&quot; (also simply &quot;nutshell&quot;, or &quot;nut &#x27;graph&quot;, &quot;nut graf&quot;, &quot;nutgraf&quot;, etc., in journalism jargon) is a brief paragraph (occasionally there can be more than one) that summarizes the news value of the story, sometimes bullet-pointed and/or set off in a box. Nut-shell paragraphs are used particularly in feature stories .

===Paragraphs===

&quot;Paragraphs&quot; (shortened as &quot;&#x27;graphs&quot;, &quot;graphs&quot;, &quot;grafs&quot; or &quot;pars&quot; in journalistic jargon) form the bulk of an article. Common usage is that one or two sentences each form their own paragraph.

===Inverted pyramid structure===

Journalists usually describe the organization or structure of a news story as an inverted pyramid. The essential and most interesting elements of a story are put at the beginning, with supporting information following in order of diminishing importance.

This structure enables readers to stop reading at any point and still come away with the essence of a story. It allows people to explore a topic to only the depth that their curiosity takes them, and without the imposition of details or nuances that they could consider irrelevant, but still making that information available to more interested readers.

The inverted pyramid structure also enables articles to be trimmed to any arbitrary length during layout, to fit in the space available.

Writers are often admonished &quot;Don&#x27;t bury the lead!&quot; to ensure that they present the most important facts first, rather than requiring the reader to go through several paragraphs to find them.

Some writers start their stories with the &quot;1-2-3 lead&quot;, yet there are many kinds of lead available. This format invariably starts with a &quot;Five Ws&quot; opening paragraph (as described above), followed by an indirect quote that serves to support a major element of the first paragraph, and then a direct quote to support the indirect quote.

===Kicker===
A kicker can refer to multiple things:

* The last story in the news broadcast; a &quot;happy&quot; story to end the show.
* A short, catchy word or phrase accompanying a major headline, &quot;intended to provoke interest in, editorialize about, or provide orientation&quot;

==Feature style==

News stories are not the only type of material that appear in newspapers and magazines. Longer articles, such as magazine cover articles and the pieces that lead the inside sections of a newspaper, are known as &quot;features&quot;. Feature stories differ from &quot;straight&quot; news in several ways. Foremost is the absence of a straight-news lead, most of the time. Instead of offering the essence of a story up front, feature writers may attempt to lure readers in.

While straight news stories always stay in third person point of view, it is common for a feature article to slip into first person. The journalist often details interactions with interview subjects, making the piece more personal.

A feature&#x27;s first paragraphs often relate an intriguing moment or event, as in an &quot;anecdotal lead&quot;. From the particulars of a person or episode, its view quickly broadens to generalities about the story&#x27;s subject.

The section that signals what a feature is about is called the &quot;nut graph&quot; or &quot;billboard&quot;. Billboards appear as the third or fourth paragraph from the top, and may be up to two paragraphs long. Unlike a lead, a billboard rarely gives everything away. It reflects the fact that feature writers aim to hold their readers&#x27; attention to the end, which requires engendering curiosity and offering a &quot;payoff.&quot; Feature paragraphs tend to be longer than those of news stories, with smoother transitions between them. Feature writers use the active-verb construction and concrete explanations of straight news but often put more personality in their prose.

Feature stories often close with a &quot;kicker&quot; rather than simply petering out.

<doc id="164065" wikidata="Q36378" url="?curid=164065" title="Fribourg">
<text>&#x27; or &#x27; is the capital of the Swiss canton of Fribourg and district of La Sarine. Located on both sides of the river Saane/Sarine, on the Swiss Plateau, it is a major economic, administrative and educational centre on the cultural border between German-speaking and French-speaking Switzerland. Its Old City, one of the best-maintained in Switzerland, sits on a small rocky hill above the valley of the Sarine. In 2018, it had a population of 38,365.

==History==
===Prehistory===
The region around Fribourg has been settled since the Neolithic period, although few remains have been found. These include some flint tools found near Bourguillon, as well as a stone hatchet and bronze tools. A river crossing was located in the area during the Roman Era. The main activity in the Swiss plateau went through the area to the north, however, and was instead centered around the valley of the river Broye and Aventicum. Therefore, only a few remains from the Roman era have been found in Fribourg. These include the traces of a wall foundation on the plains near Pérolles.

===Middle Ages===
The town was founded as Freiburg in 1157 by Berthold IV, Duke of Zähringen. Its name is derived from German &#x27; (free) and &#x27; (fort). Its most ancient part is conveniently located on a former peninsula of the river Sarine, protected on three sides by steep cliffs. The easily defended city helped the Dukes of Zähringen to strengthen and extend their power in the Swiss plateau in the area between the Aare and La Sarine.

Beginning at the time of its inception, Fribourg built a city-state; initially, the land it controlled lay some distance away. When the dukes of died out in 1218, the city was transferred to the related family. They granted the city its former privileges and wrote the municipal laws in the so-called &quot;&quot; in 1249, in which the legal, institutional and economic organizations were established. Several treaties with neighbouring city-states, including (1239), Bern (1243), and () (1245), were signed at this time.

The city was sold to the Habsburgs in 1277. Trade and industry began as early as the mid-13th century. In the early period, Fribourg consisted of four distinct inner city districts: Burg, Au, La Neuveville, and Spital. The city developed rapidly, which led to its first expansion: the Burg district expanded to the west in 1224, a town was established across the river in 1254, and in 1280 development began near Place Python. These expansions reflect the economic boom in Fribourg. The 14th century was dominated by trade, and cloth and leather production, which brought the city renown in Central Europe by 1370. In 1339, Fribourg participated alongside the Habsburgs and the County of Burgundy in the Battle of Laupen against Bern and its Swiss Confederacy allies.

The treaty with Bern was renewed in 1403. The leaders of the city began a territorial acquisition, in which they gradually brought more nearby land under their control. This laid the ground-work for the Canton of Fribourg. By 1442 the city had control of all the land within about , on both sides of the Saane. It was therefore directly controlled by the city leaders, not by any intermediate administration.

The mid-15th century was shaped by various military conflicts. First, considerable losses in a war against Savoy had to be made good. The Savoyard influence on the city grew, and the Habsburgs ceded it to them in 1452. It remained under the control of Savoy until the Burgundian Wars in 1477. As an ally of Bern, Fribourg participated in the war against Charles I of Burgundy, thereby bringing more land under its control.

After the city was released from the sphere of influence of Savoy, it attained the status of Free Imperial City in 1478. The city and its canton joined the Swiss Confederation in 1481, and has long influenced Swiss and European Catholicism. In the 16th century, Fribourg continued to grow, first following the invasion of in 1536 with the help of Bern, and then in 1554 through the annexation of land formerly controlled by the Count of .

Several prominent families developed as a result of the cloth and leather trade, beginning in the 14th century, including , , , (originally from Bern), , , and . Together with the local nobles (the , /Velga, , and families) they formed the 15th century patrician class. This contributed to the decline of the cloth trade, however, as the families involved in the industry began to be more concerned with governing the city and its surrounding possessions.

An important milestone for the politics of the city was reached in 1627, when the patricians drew up a new constitution, in which they declared that they were the only people capable of ruling the city, and thereby took control of all voting rights. This consolidated the oligarchy which had begun to form as early as the 15th century.

===Importance of monasteries and churches ===
The monasteries of Fribourg have always formed a centre of religious culture, which includes architecture, sculpture and painting, and have contributed to the culture of the city. The Franciscan monastery was donated by Jakob von Riggisberg in 1256. In early times, it was closely associated with the city council, because it housed the city archives and its monastery church was used for town meetings until 1433.

Similarly, the Augustinian monastery was founded in the mid-13th century, and enjoyed the support of the noble Velga family for a long time. Additionally, La Maigrauge Abbey has existed since 1255, and has belonged to the Cistercians since 1262. An important institution was the public hospital, opened in the mid-13th century, which provided services for the poor.

During the Reformation, Fribourg remained Catholic, although it was nearly surrounded by the Protestant Bern. This led to repeated conflicts over religion in border regions, and in areas controlled jointly by Fribourg and Bern. The city was a major centre of the Counter-Reformation. At the end of the 16th century and the beginning of the 17th, new monasteries were established in the city, including: a Capuchin monastery (1608), another on Bisemberg (1621), an Ursuline monastery (1634), and a Visitandine monastery (1635). The most influential monastery, however, was that of the Jesuits, which contributed to a large extent to the advancement and prosperity of the city. It established the College of Saint Michael in 1582, the theological faculty of which formed the basis of the University of Fribourg. The concept of an objective press was also begun by the Jesuits.

In 1613 Fribourg became the seat of the Bishop of Lausanne, who, after the Reformation, was forced first into Evian, and then into exile in Burgundy. Today it is the seat of the Diocese of Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg.

===1780–1809===

The strong patrician regime, consisting of no more than 60 families, filled all of the influential positions in the city and dominated all political, social, economic and cultural arenas of Fribourg. On several occasions unhappy citizens joined to attempt a revolt, including in 1781 under the leadership of Pierre-Nicolas Chenaux. These revolts were repressed with the help of Bern and Bernese troops. The invasion of Switzerland by French troops in 1798 led to the downfall of this Ancien Régime. Fribourg capitulated to the French on 2 March and relinquished leadership of its lands. This freed the way for the first municipal elections, in which Jean de Montenach was elected the first mayor. With the introduction of the Act of Mediation under Napoleon in 1803, the separation of the city of Fribourg from its Canton was finally carried out. Fribourg was made the capital of its region and Canton, and, between 1803 and 1809, was one of the capitals of Switzerland.

=== Sonderbund ===
The patricians regained control of the city in 1814 during the Restoration period. They ruled until 1830. Its leadership was followed by a new and more liberal constitution. Fribourg was part of the 1845-1847 Sonderbund, a &quot;separate alliance&quot; of Catholic cantons attempting to secede from Switzerland. Fribourg and the Sonderbund capitulated to Federalist forces under General Dufour on 14 November 1847 in what amounted to a brief and nearly bloodless Swiss civil war. Since 1848, the new national constitution and the amendment to the Canton constitution has guaranteed every citizen the right to vote.

===Modern times===
The later 19th and the 20th century brought about drastic changes to the city&#x27;s culture and physical nature. In 1848 the city wall was partially torn down and a new bridge constructed across the Saane/La Sarine. The opening of the midland railway line through the city in 1862 led to the development of a &quot;railway station quarter&quot; of the city. The improved transportation enabled Fribourg to undergo industrialisation. The city centre shifted from the Old City to the new Train Station quarter. Extensive areas in Pérolles, Beauregard and Vignettaz were developed with industry or houses around 1900. The inauguration of the university in 1889 was an important event in Fribourg. Another economic boon to the city was the opening of the nearby A12 highway.

==Geography==


===Topography===
Fribourg has an elevation of (in the Old City), and is situated southwest of Bern. It is located on the Swiss plateau, and extends on both sides of the Sarine, which, in the vicinity of Fribourg, has cut deeply into the molasse. The Old City is located on a hill, only about wide, which rises about above the valley floor. Most quarters of the city are located on the High Plateau and the surrounding hills, which have an average elevation of . The valley floor is only settled in the area immediately around the Old City.

Fribourg has an area, , of . Of this area, or 13.4% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 17.0% is forested. Of the rest of the land, or 63.3% is settled (buildings or roads), or 5.7% is either rivers or lakes and or 0.8% is unproductive land.

Of the built up area, industrial buildings made up 4.5% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 34.5% and transportation infrastructure made up 15.2%. Power and water infrastructure as well as other special developed areas made up 1.6% of the area while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 7.5%. Out of the forested land, 14.4% of the total land area is heavily forested and 2.6% is covered with orchards or small clusters of trees. Of the agricultural land, 6.9% is used for growing crops and 6.0% is pastures. Of the water in the municipality, 1.7% is in lakes and 4.0% is in rivers and streams.

The area of the municipality, which is relatively small for a city, covers an area of Molasse in the central part of Canton of Fribourg. The area is cut through from south to north by the tightly wound Saane/La Sarine, which has eroded a valley, in some places, to a depth of below the surrounding Plateau. In general, the valley floor is between wide. Le Lac de Pérolles, formed as a reservoir by Maigrauge Dam, the first Gravity Dam in Europe, in 1872, is located south of the city. The head of the Schiffenensee is located just north of the city. At both of these artificial lakes, La Sarine covers nearly the entire valley floor.

The hills flanked on both sides by steep, largely wooded, slopes. To the east, the municipality reaches up the slopes of Mount Schönberg, which, with an elevation of , is the highest point in Fribourg. The river Galtera, also deeply cut into the plateau, flows between the mountain and the river, emptying into the Saane/La Sarine near the Old City.

The former village of Bourguillon lies within the municipality. Fribourg borders on Düdingen and Tafers to the east, Pierrafortscha to the southeast, Marly to the south, Villars-sur-Glâne and Givisiez to the west, and Granges-Paccot to the north.

===Historic population===
The historical population is given in the following chart:

===Languages===
Most of the population () speaks French (22,603 or 63.6%) as their first language, German is the second most common (7,520 or 21.2%) and Italian is the third (1,359 or 3.8%). There are 55 people who speak Romansh. Few inhabitants in village of Basse-Ville speak Bolze, a mixed language created from the blend of French and Swiss German. Fribourg, the city and the canton, has two official languages, and French outweighs German as both the language of the local government and the most commonly spoken language in public discourse and business in the canton.

Fribourg has always been located on the Swiss language border, but at the time of the city&#x27;s founding in the 12th century, German was the prevailing language. Although German was the official language of the city until 1800, French gradually became more influential. This was aided by industrialization, which led to an influx of French-speaking immigrants. Since the political changes of the late 18th century and early 19th century, the German-speaking population has been a minority. Even in German, the town is often called &quot;Fribourg&quot; instead of the Standard German &quot;Freiburg&quot;, which helps distinguish it from Freiburg im Breisgau on the edge of the Black Forest, Germany. Another explanation is that in the local Alemannic German dialect, the city is called &quot;Frybùrg&quot; or &quot;Friburg&quot; (pronounced: [ˈfrib̥ʊrɡ]), from which the French name &quot;Fribourg&quot; was probably derived.

===Religion===
From the , 24,614 or 69.2% were Roman Catholic, while 2,763 or 7.8% belonged to the Swiss Reformed Church. Of the rest of the population, there were 443 members of an Orthodox church (or about 1.25% of the population), there were 13 individuals (or about 0.04% of the population) who belonged to the Christian Catholic Church, and there were 668 individuals (or about 1.88% of the population) who belonged to another Christian church. There were 62 individuals (or about 0.17% of the population) who were Jewish, and 1,676 (or about 4.71% of the population) who were Muslim. There were 161 individuals who were Buddhist, 71 individuals who were Hindu and 43 individuals who belonged to another church. 2,843 (or about 8.00% of the population) belonged to no church, are agnostic or atheist, and 2,509 individuals (or about 7.06% of the population) did not answer the question.

The city remained Catholic during the Reformation, and has since become a centre of Catholicism. It has a greater than average number of churches and monasteries. Fribourg has been the seat of the Diocese of Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg since 1613. (See &quot;Sonderbund&quot;)

==Economy==

===Development of trade and economy===
Several types of industry developed in Fribourg as early as the 13th and 14th centuries. The extension of the city along the east bank of the Saane/La Sarine made about this time was indicative of a strong economic upturn. In Galterntal, water power was used for various mills. Along the Saane new trade districts developed with the towns of Au, Neustadt and Matten.

The tanneries and cloth manufacturers, strengthened by widespread sheep raising, led to an economic boom in the 14th and 15th centuries. This helped Fribourg by making its trades well known throughout central Europe. A gradual decline in cloth making in the second half of the 15th century occurred as local farmers replaced their sheep with cattle. Other reasons for the collapse of the cloth industry in the 16th century include the fact that the guild refused to use new materials or modern styles, and that the social structure of the city changed with the rise of the patrician class.

After this time, Fribourg was shaped by low-level trade, and was not industrialized until it was connected to the Swiss Railroad, beginning in the 1870s. After Lake Pérolles was built in 1872, energy was able to be supplied to the plateau south and west of the city. Thus, an industrial area developed there, dominated in its early years by a wagon factory and a lumber mill. Later, two breweries were established in this area. A chocolate factory was established in Villârs-sur-Glâne in 1901, but it came under Fribourg&#x27;s jurisdiction in 1906 after a change of borders.

In the course of the 20th century, the plateau became the industrial section of the city. The development of new industrial areas in neighbouring municipalities, beginning in the 1970s, has permitted continued economic growth.

===Economic situation today===

There were 17,207 residents of the municipality who were employed in some capacity, of which women made up 47.1% of the workforce.

 the total number of full-time equivalent jobs was 20,099. The number of jobs in the primary sector was 14, of which 4 were in agriculture, 8 were in forestry or lumber production and 1 was in fishing or fisheries. The number of jobs in the secondary sector was 3,530 of which 1,744 or (49.4%) were in manufacturing, 9 or (0.3%) were in mining and 1,455 (41.2%) were in construction.

Fribourg has more jobs than laborers, and is therefore a large commuter destination for the largely agricultural surrounding area. Local industry includes food and luxury products, drinks (the breweries are owned by the Danish firm Carlsberg), metal and machine construction, electronics, and computer technology.

The largest number of workers are active in the service industries. Many of these work in government administrative positions. Other important sectors are education (at the university), banks and insurance companies, tourism and restaurants, as well as health services. Fribourg is home to the administrative offices of several international companies. The Cantonal hospital is on the border with Villars-sur-Glâne.

, there were 16,572 workers who commuted into the municipality and 6,505 workers who commuted away. The municipality is a net importer of workers, with about 2.5 workers entering the municipality for every one leaving. Of the working population, 35% used public transportation to get to work, and 37.8% used a private car.

==Transport==
Fribourg is the most important transport hub of the canton of Fribourg.

===Roads===
The town lies on the old main road from Bern to Vevey, and acts as an access point to Payerne, Morat and Thun. The connection to the Swiss motorway network was established in 1971 with the opening of the A12 motorway from Bern to Matran, which was extended in 1981 to Vevey. The Swiss east-west A1 from the West Bern bypasses the town to the north and west, only affecting the communities of Tälchen and Chamblioux. The access points of Fribourg-Sud and Fribourg-North are each about 3 km from the city centre.

===Railway===

The connection to the railway network was accomplished in several stages from 1860. Initially, the railway line from Bern to Fribourg opened on 2 July 1860 with a temporary terminal at Balliswil about 4 km north of the city, as the Grandfey Viaduct over the Sarine valley was not yet finished. On 4 September 1862, the whole of the line from Balliswil to Lausanne via Fribourg opened, with a temporary station building at Fribourg/Freiburg railway station, until the permanent building opened in 1873. A line to Payerne opened on 25 August 1876 and to Morat on 23 August 1898.

===Public transport===

A funicular railway has been operated from the Neuveville district to the upper city since 1899 by the sewage works. The Fribourg funicular is one of the world&#x27;s few remaining water-powered funiculars, and the only one powered by sewage water. The upper station is located at the sewage plant which pumps sewage water into the descending car, which makes it heavier than the ascending car. The sewage is released at the bottom.

From 1897 to 1965 in Fribourg there was a long tram network in operation, with the trams replaced from 1949 with the Fribourg trolleybus system. The current bus network is now operated by the &quot;Transports publics fribourgeois&quot;, with connections to Bulle, Avenches, Schmitten, Schwarzenburg and in the tourist region Schwarzsee.

===Airport===
The regional Bern-Belp Airport is an hour away from the area.
==Culture and tourism==

Fribourg is a day trip destination for tourists who want to visit the sights of the city. These include the historic Old City with its Gothic Cathedral of Saint Nicholas renowned for its stained glass windows designed by Józef Mehoffer, and the museums.

It is located on a spectacular peninsula, surrounded on three sides by the Saane/La Sarine. The architecture of the Old City date primarily from the Gothic period; it was built predominately before the 16th century. Most houses are built of the local molasse stone. Consisting of the neighborhoods Bourg, Auge and Neuveville, its old town is rich in fountains and churches dating from the 12th century until the 17th century. Its cathedral, reaching in height, was built between 1283 and 1490.

<text>The American (North and South America) horned owls and the Old World eagle-owls make up the genus Bubo, at least as traditionally described. The genus name &quot;Bubo&quot; is Latin for owl. Its name in Russian &quot;&quot; is one of the few native Russian words containing the letter Ф.

This genus contains 10 species that are found in many parts of the world. Some of the largest living Strigiformes are in &quot;Bubo&quot;. Traditionally, only owls with ear-tufts were included in this genus, but that is no longer the case.
==Taxonomy==

The genus &quot;Bubo&quot; was introduced in 1805 by the French zoologist André Duméril for the horned owls. The type species is the Eurasian eagle-owl. The word &quot;bubo&quot; is Latin for the Eurasian eagle owl and was used as the specific epithet for the species by Carl Linnaeus in 1758.

A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2020 found that species in the genera &quot;Scotopelia&quot; and &quot;Ketupa&quot; were embedded within the clade containing members of the genus &quot;Bubo&quot; making the genus &quot;Bubo&quot; paraphyletic. To create monophyletic genera, nine species were moved from &quot;Bubo&quot; to &quot;Ketupa&quot;.

===Species===
The genus contains 10 extant species:
* Snowy owl, &quot;Bubo scandiacus&quot;
* Great horned owl, &quot;Bubo virginianus&quot;
* Lesser horned owl, &quot;Bubo magellanicus&quot;
* Eurasian eagle-owl, &quot;Bubo bubo&quot;
* Indian eagle-owl, &quot;Bubo bengalensis&quot;
* Pharaoh eagle-owl, &quot;Bubo ascalaphus&quot;
* Cape eagle-owl, &quot;Bubo capensis&quot;
* Arabian eagle-owl, &quot;Bubo milesi&quot;
* Greyish eagle-owl, &quot;Bubo cinerascens&quot;
* Spotted eagle-owl, &quot;Bubo africanus&quot;

Sometimes included in this genus:
* Verreaux&#x27;s eagle-owl, &quot;Ketupa lactea&quot;
* Spot-bellied eagle-owl, &quot;Ketupa nipalensis&quot;
* Barred eagle-owl,&quot;Ketupa sumatrana&quot;
* Fraser&#x27;s eagle-owl,&quot;Ketupa poensis&quot;
* Akun eagle-owl, &quot;Ketupa leucosticta&quot; 
* Philippine eagle-owl, &quot;Ketupa philippensis&quot;
* Dusky eagle-owl, &quot;Ketupa coromanda&quot;
* Shelley&#x27;s eagle-owl, &quot;Ketupa shelleyi&quot;
* Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl, &quot;Ketupa blakistoni&quot;
* Brown fish owl, &quot;Ketupa zeylonensis&quot;
* Tawny fish owl, &quot;Ketupa flavipes&quot;
* Buffy fish owl, &quot;Ketupa ketupu&quot;
* Pel&#x27;s fishing owl, &quot;Scotopelia peli&quot;
* Rufous fishing owl, &quot;Scotopelia ussheri&quot;
* Vermiculated fishing owl, &quot;Scotopelia bouvieri&quot;

===Fossil record===
Named and distinct &quot;Bubo&quot; species are:
* &quot;Bubo florianae&quot; (Late Miocene of Csákvár, Hungary, tentatively placed here)
* &quot;Bubo leakeyae&quot; (Early Pleistocene of Tanzania)
* &quot;Bubo binagadensis&quot; (Late Pleistocene of Binagady, Azerbaijan)
* &quot;Bubo osvaldoi&quot; (Pleistocene of Cuba)
* &quot;Bubo insularis&quot; (Pleistocene of Sardinia)

Some notable undescribed fossils of prehistoric horned owls, usually quite fragmentary remains, have also been recorded:
* &quot;Bubo&quot; sp. (Late Pliocene of Senèze, France)
* &quot;Bubo&quot; sp. (Late Pliocene of Rębielice Królewskie, Poland; tentatively placed here)
* &quot;Bubo&quot; sp. (Late Pleistocene of San Josecito Cavern, Mexico)

Specimen UMMP V31030, a Late Pliocene coracoid from the Rexroad Formation of Kansas (U.S.), cannot be conclusively assigned to either &quot;Bubo&quot; or &quot;Strix&quot;. This fossil is from a taxon similar in size to the great horned owl (&quot;B. virginianus&quot;) or the great grey owl (&quot;S. nebulosa&quot;).

The Sinclair owl (&quot;Bubo sinclairi&quot;) from Late Pleistocene California may have been a paleosubspecies of the great horned owl, while the roughly contemporary &quot;Bubo insularis&quot; of the central and eastern Mediterranean has been considered a junior synonym of a brown fish owl paleosubspecies. Additional paleosubspecies are discussed on the appropriate species page.

Several presumed &quot;Bubo&quot; fossils have turned out to be from different birds. The Late Eocene/Early Oligocene eared owls &quot;&quot;Bubo&quot; incertus&quot; and &quot;&quot;Bubo&quot; arvernensis&quot; are now placed in the fossil barn owl genera &quot;Nocturnavis&quot; and &quot;Necrobyas&quot;, respectively. &quot;&quot;Bubo&quot; leptosteus&quot; is now recognized as primitive owl in the genus &quot;Minerva&quot; (formerly &quot;Protostrix&quot;). &quot;&quot;Bubo&quot; poirreiri&quot; from the Late Oligocene or Early Miocene of Saint-Gérard-le-Puy in France, is now placed in &quot;Mioglaux&quot;.

On the other hand, the supposed fossil heron &quot;&quot;Ardea&quot; lignitum&quot; from the Late Pliocene of Plaue-Rippersroda (Germany) was apparently an owl and close to &quot;Bubo&quot; or more probably actually belongs here. Given its age – about 2 million years ago or so – it is usually included in the Eurasian eagle-owl today.

==Interactions with humans==
Because of their nocturnal habits, most owls do not directly interact with humans. However, in 2015, an eagle owl in Purmerend, Netherlands, attacked some 50 people before it was caught by a hired falconer.

<doc id="164070" wikidata="Q7458818" url="?curid=164070" title="Sexual ritual">
<text>Sexual rituals fall into two categories: culture-created, and natural behaviour, the human animal having developed sex rituals from evolutionary instincts for reproduction, which are then integrated into society, and elaborated to include aspects such as marriage rites, dances, etc. Sometimes sexual rituals are highly formalized and/or part of religious activity, as in the cases of &quot;hieros gamos&quot;, the hierodule, and Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.).

==Rites of passage==

Part of the rites of passage of growing up are what have been termed &quot;rites of separation from the asexual world... followed by rites of incorporation into the world of sexuality&quot;. These may be formal or semi-formal—&quot;for some students, going to college is partly a sexual ritual, like the ceremonial dances of the whooping crane&quot;—or take the form of a more private induction: &quot;formal and artificial... the impression that a long-established rite was to be enacted, among Staffordshire figurs and &quot;papier-mâché&quot; trays, with the compelling, detached formality of nightmare&quot;.

Freud was particularly interested in ethnological accounts of &quot;the &#x27;ceremonial&#x27; (purely formal, ritual, or official) coitus, which takes place&quot; in connection with &quot;the taboo of virginity&quot;.

===Wedding as orgy===
Freud also noted that in &quot;numerous examples of marriage ceremonies, there can be no doubt that people other than the bridegroom, for example his assistants and companions (our traditional &#x27;groomsmen&#x27;), were granted full sexual access to the bride&quot;. To his followers, &quot;the &quot;wedding as orgy&quot;, with the bride taking on all the men present, is the clear historical reality behind the modern jokes... and the climactic line-up or &#x27;gang&#x27;-kissing of the bride, by all the men present&quot;.

In such a view, &quot;other examples of sacred or permitted public coitus of all women with all men do survive, in similarly modified &#x27;kissing&#x27; form&quot;, as under the mistletoe &quot;to revive the dying sun at the winter solstice, when the strongest human &#x27;life-magic&#x27;, namely ritual intercourse, is to be deployed&quot;.

==Interaction ritual==

To the sociologist looking upon &quot;sexual intercourse as interaction ritual... sexual intercourse is the ritual of love; it both creates and recreates the social tie (since Durkheimian rituals need to be repeated periodically, as solidarity runs down), and symbolizes it&quot;. In similar fashion, Margot Anand has pointed out that &quot;rituals pervade our daily life and give it a sense of ceremony and celebration (...) a ritual, through your own unique symbolic gestures... will help you transform your lovemaking into a special and sacred act&quot;.

Erving Goffman has noted, however, &quot;the considerable informational delicacy of this form of interaction&quot;, and how &quot;individuals may use darkness to ensure strategic ambiguity&quot;.

==Compulsions==

In perversion, sexual rituals may emerge as a necessary part of sexual activity. For the criminologist, &quot;sexual ritual involves repeatedly engaging in an act or series of acts in a certain manner because of a sexual need&quot;. Within a relationship, &quot;the Compulsive libido type takes advantages of opportunities to use the specific sexual ritual that causes intense arousal, and in its stronger form, the Compulsive lover can only arouse using the sexual object or ritual&quot;. In any relationship, however, &quot;a sexual habit that becomes routine or stylised... can lead to a sexual ritual&quot;, so that &quot;if you don&#x27;t have a way to talk to your partner about your sexual relationship, you may find yourself... stuck in sexual rituals that could be limiting your sexual enjoyment&quot;: as a wife might say, &quot;Same old technique, same old Lewis. It&#x27;s you all right, I&#x27;d know that old routine anywhere.&quot; Thus one&#x27;s sex life may all &quot;be about rituals: the ritual of sex in the morning, or the ritual of sex at night; and the ritual of sex at anniversaries, and the ritual of sex at Christmas&quot;.

==Dharmic art==
In the Buddhist art of India, Bhutan, Nepal and Tibet, yab-yum is the male deity in sexual union with his female . The symbolism is associated with Anuttarayoga tantra where the male figure is usually linked to compassion (&quot;&quot;) and skillful means (&quot;upāya-kauśalya&quot;), and the female partner to &#x27;insight&#x27; (&quot;prajñā&quot;). The symbolism of union and sexual polarity is a central teaching in Tantric Buddhism, especially in Tibet. The union is realised by the practitioner as a mystical experience within one&#x27;s own body. Yab-yum is generally understood to represent the primordial (or mystical) union of wisdom and compassion. Tantric Buddhism is itself an outcrop of Tantrism, advanced techniques of which included &quot;the ritual sex act (Maithuna) which was a feature of Tantric yoga&quot;. Given that &quot;sex is holy to a Tantric... Tantric art, writings and religious rituals glorify sex&quot;.

==Private worship==

A sex organ &quot;makes an admirable fertility symbol, and has been worshipped as such privately from time to time, or even publicly... gives dramatic promise of productivity and protection&quot;. Such &quot;worship&quot; may only become more common in late modernity, as &quot;in our secular culture, sexuality often replaces religion as a means of pursuing the meaning of life&quot;. Alan Watts maintains that &quot;when you are in love with someone, you do indeed see them as a divine being... through a tremendous outpouring of psychic energy in total devotion and worship for this other person&quot;. A woman may &#x27;want someone who adores me... like he was adoring my breasts with his hands&quot;. A man (more ambivalently) may muse on &quot;the white breasts he worships; adores; is scared of; detests&quot;. For Shakespeare, &quot;this is the liver-vein, which makes flesh a deity, a green goose a goddess; pure, pure idolatry&quot;.

In the further reaches of chick lit, &quot;the male organ... becomes a tower of strength, a tree trunk in girth, the pillar that sustains the universe... a Pillar of Hercules, sustaining heaven&quot;—evidence perhaps that &quot;the phallic religious tendency is alive in the modern and the civilized... a compulsive fascination&quot; with what Jung termed &quot;the phallus as the quintessence of life and fruitfulness&quot;. Correspondingly, the Western adept may borrow, in the quest &quot;to create a Sacred Space... names given to the vagina in the East, including Valley of Joy, Great Jewel, Pearl, Lotus Blossom, Moist Cave, Ripe Peach, Enchanted Garden, and Full Moon&quot;.

==Literature==
In the &quot;Satyricon&quot;, the hero is throughout &quot;hounded by the mighty rage of Priapus of Hellespont&quot;—almost certainly because early on, he &quot;has offended Priapus... by impersonating him in some sexual ceremonies&quot;.

<doc id="164073" wikidata="Q135645" url="?curid=164073" title="Walther Rathenau">
<text>Walther Rathenau (; 29 September 1867 – 24 June 1922) was a German industrialist, writer and politician who served as foreign minister of Germany from February to June 1922.

Rathenau was one of Germany&#x27;s leading industrialists in the late German Empire. During World War I, he played a key role in the organisation of the German war economy and headed the War Raw Materials Department from August 1914 to March 1915.

After the war, Rathenau was an influential figure in the politics of the Weimar Republic. In 1921 he was appointed minister of reconstruction and a year later became foreign minister. Rathenau negotiated the 1922 Treaty of Rapallo, which normalised relations and strengthened economic ties between Germany and Soviet Russia. The agreement, along with Rathenau&#x27;s insistence that Germany fulfil its obligations under the Treaty of Versailles, led right-wing nationalist groups (including a nascent Nazi Party) to brand him part of a Jewish-communist conspiracy. 

Two months after the signing of the treaty, Rathenau was assassinated by members of the ultra-nationalist Organisation Consul in Berlin. His death was followed by national mourning as well as widespread demonstrations against counter-revolutionary terrorism, which briefly strengthened the Weimar Republic. Rathenau came to be viewed as a democratic martyr during the Weimar era. After the Nazis came to power in 1933, all commemorations of Rathenau were banned.

==Early life==
Rathenau was born in Berlin to Emil Rathenau, a prominent Jewish businessman and founder of the Allgemeine Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft (AEG), a producer of electricity and electrical equipment, and Mathilde Nachmann.

=== Education and business experience ===
Rathenau studied physics, chemistry and philosophy in Berlin and Strasbourg, and received a doctorate in physics in 1889 after studying under August Kundt. 

Rathenau worked as a technical engineer in a Swiss aluminium factory and then as a manager in a small electro-chemical firm in Bitterfeld, where he conducted experiments in electrolysis. He returned to Berlin and joined the AEG board in 1899, becoming a leading industrialist in the late German Empire and early Weimar Republic. He set up power stations in Manchester, Buenos Aires and Baku. AEG acquired ownership of a streetcar company in Madrid, and in East Africa he purchased a British firm. In total he was involved with 84 companies worldwide. AEG was particularly praised for vertical integration methods and a strong emphasis on supply chain management. Rathenau developed an expertise in business restructuring and turning companies around. His strong organizational abilities made his company very successful. He made substantial profits from commercial lending on a wide industrial scale, which he then reinvested in capital and assets.

=== Visits to Germany&#x27;s African colonies ===
During the same period, Rathenau was becoming interested in politics. He became close friends with the businessman Bernhard Dernburg, who was appointed Germany&#x27;s first colonial secretary in May 1907. Dernburg introduced Rathenau to Chancellor Bernhard von Bülow, who agreed that at his own expense Rathenau could accompany Dernburg on official visits to the colonies of German East Africa in 1907 and German Southwest Africa in 1908. Soon after returning from East Africa, Rathenau submitted a report to the German government which was influential in developing official policy towards the colony. Like Dernburg, Rathenau believed that African workers were the most valuable resource in the colony and that it was essential to care for their well-being. Rathenau also argued that the colonial justice system must treat Africans fairly.

During his time in German South West Africa, Rathenau condemned the treatment of the Herero people, referring to the Herero and Namaqua genocide as &quot;the greatest atrocity that has ever been brought about by German military policy&quot;. He condemned the &quot;system of deportation and concentration camps&quot; and described the &quot;present position of the native&quot; as having the &quot;outward appearance of slavery&quot;.

===Thoughts on German Jews===

Rathenau held a sense of inferiority in society due to his Jewishness, realising, in the words of Hans-Ulrich Wehler, &quot;that he had come into the world as a second-class citizen and that no amount of ability and merit could ever free him from the condition&quot;.

His German Jewish heritage and his accumulated wealth were both factors in establishing his deeply divisive reputation in German politics at a time of increasingly widespread antisemitism in Germany. In a 1918 book, he summed up his thoughts on growing up Jewish in Germany, writing that his patriotism and loyalty to his country were no different than that of any fellow German regardless of religion or ethnicity:

I am a German of Jewish origin. My people are the German people, my homeland is Germany, my faith is German faith, which stands above denominations.At the time, there was a widespread belief in Germany that Jews could never put their country first. The idea that the Jews were &quot;our misfortune&quot;, as the German nationalist historian Heinrich Treitschke wrote, led to the proliferation from the 1880s of antisemitic parties. There were no Jewish officers in the Prussian Army – the ruling class in the Imperial Officer Corps was both outspokenly and latently antisemitic and eventually supported the Nazis&#x27; antisemitic policies. 

Rathenau was a strong proponent of full and radical assimilation of German Jews into German society. In his 1897 article (&quot;Hear, O Israel!&quot;), he wrote:

Strange sight! In the midst of German life an isolated, strange human tribe, resplendently and conspicuously adorned, hot-blooded and animated in its behaviour. An Asian horde on the soil of the March of Brandenburg. The forced cheerfulness of these people does not betray the amount of old, unquenched hatred that rests on their shoulders. Little do they know that only an age that keeps all natural forces in check is able to protect them from what their fathers would have suffered. In close association with each other, strictly closed off from the outside – thus they live in a semi-voluntary, invisible ghetto, not a living member of the people but a foreign organism in its body. ... What, then, must happen? An event without historical precedent: the conscious self-education of a race to assimilate to outside demands. ... Assimilation in the sense that tribal qualities – regardless of whether they are good or bad – that are demonstrably hateful to fellow Germans are cast off and replaced by more suitable ones. ... The goal of the processes should not be imitation Germans, but Jews who are German by nature and education.

== In government ==

=== War Raw Materials Department ===
Rathenau played a key role in convincing the War Ministry to set up the War Raw Materials Department (&quot;Kriegsrohstoffabteilung&quot;, KRA), of which he was put in charge in August 1914 and where he established its fundamental policies and procedures. The KRA focused on raw materials threatened by the British blockade, as well as supplies from occupied Belgium and France. It set prices, regulated the distribution to vital war industries and began the development of substitute raw materials. 

He left the KRA in March 1915 and became president of AEG upon his father&#x27;s death in June of that year. 

=== Postwar statesman ===
Rathenau was a moderate liberal in politics. After World War I, he joined the German Democratic Party (DDP) and moved to the left in the face of postwar chaos. Passionate about social equality, he rejected state ownership of industry and instead advocated greater worker participation in the management of companies. His ideas were influential in postwar governments, although in 1919 when his name was mentioned in the Weimar National Assembly as a candidate for president of Germany, there was a burst of laughter among the other members. Referring to the extreme right-wing organizations that arose within months of the communist-inspired Spartacist uprising in January 1919, he said in the Reichstag that they were, &quot;the product of a state in which for centuries no one has ruled who was not a member of, or a convert to, military feudalism&quot;. 

In 1920, he worked on the Socialisation Commission, a group of experts set up by the Council of the People&#x27;s Deputies in November 1918 to examine ways of socialising parts of the German economy, and took part in the Spa Conference, at which German disarmament and reparations were discussed. Because of his international reputation and negotiating skills, he became minister of reconstruction in Chancellor Joseph Wirth&#x27;s cabinet in May 1921. He supported Wirth&#x27;s &quot;fulfilment policy&quot;, which attempted to show that Germany was unable to meet the Entente&#x27;s reparations demands by making a good faith effort to fulfil them. In October he concluded the Wiesbaden Agreement with France on private-sector German deliveries of goods to French war victims. Rathenau resigned as minister at the end of October when the DDP withdrew from the governing coalition, but he continued to work for the government in London and at the Cannes Conference on reparations.

=== Foreign minister ===
In 1922, Rathenau became foreign minister in Wirth&#x27;s second cabinet. His insistence that Germany should fulfil its obligations under the Treaty of Versailles but work for a revision of its terms infuriated extreme German nationalists. He also angered them by negotiating the Treaty of Rapallo with the Soviet Union, which was signed on 16 April 1922 on the sidelines of the Conference of Genoa. The Rapallo Treaty, which normalised relations between Germany and the USSR, allowed Germany to return to the international diplomatic stage but isolated it from the Western powers.

The leaders of the still obscure Nazi Party and other extremist groups claimed that he was part of a &quot;Jewish-communist conspiracy&quot;, despite the fact that he was a liberal German nationalist who had bolstered the country&#x27;s war effort. The British politician Robert Boothby wrote of him, &quot;He was something that only a German Jew could simultaneously be: a prophet, a philosopher, a mystic, a writer, a statesman, an industrial magnate of the highest and greatest order, and the pioneer of what has become known as &#x27;industrial rationalisation&#x27;.&quot;

== Assassination and aftermath ==

On 24 June 1922, two months after the signing of the Treaty of Rapallo, Rathenau was assassinated. He was being chauffeured from his house in Berlin-Grunewald to the Foreign Office in the Wilhelmstraße when his car was passed by another with Ernst Werner Techow behind the wheel and Erwin Kern and Hermann Fischer in the back seat. Kern opened fire with a submachine gun at close range, killing Rathenau almost instantly, while Fischer threw a hand grenade into the car before Techow quickly drove them away. Also involved in the plot were Techow&#x27;s younger brother Hans Gerd Techow, future writer Ernst von Salomon, and Willi Günther (aided and abetted by seven others, some of them schoolboys). All conspirators were members of the ultra-nationalist secret Organisation Consul. A memorial stone in the Königsallee in Grunewald marks the scene of the crime.

Historian Martin Sabrow points to Hermann Ehrhardt, the leader of the Organisation Consul, as the one who ordered the murders. Ehrhardt and his men believed that Rathenau&#x27;s death would bring down the government and prompt the Left to act against the Weimar Republic, thereby provoking civil war in which the Organisation Consul would be called on for help by the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;. After an anticipated victory Ehrhardt hoped to establish an authoritarian regime or a military dictatorship. He carefully saw to it that no connections between him and the assassins could be detected. Although Fischer and Kern contacted the Berlin chapter of the Organisation Consul to use its resources, they mainly acted on their own in planning and carrying out the assassination. The historian Michael Kellogg argued that Vasily Biskupsky, Erich Ludendorff and his advisor Max Bauer, all members of the Aufbau Vereinigung, a group of tsarist exiles and early Nazis, colluded in the assassination of Rathenau, although the degree of their participation was not entirely clear.

Millions of Germans gathered on the streets to express their grief and demonstrate against counter-revolutionary terrorism. When the news of Rathenau&#x27;s death became known in the Reichstag, the session turned into turmoil. DNVP politician Karl Helfferich in particular became the target of scorn because he had recently made a vitriolic attack upon Rathenau. During the official memorial ceremony the next day, Chancellor Joseph Wirth from the Centre Party made a speech which soon became famous. While pointing to the right side of the parliamentary floor, he said, &quot;There is the enemy – and there is no doubt about it: The enemy is on the right!&quot;

The crime itself was soon cleared up. Willi Günther had bragged about his participation in public. After his arrest on 26 June, he confessed to the crime without holding anything back. Hans Gerd Techow was arrested the following day, and Ernst Werner Techow, who was visiting his uncle, was taken into custody three days later. Fischer and Kern, however, remained on the loose. After a daring flight, which kept Germany in suspense for more than two weeks, they were finally spotted at Saaleck Castle in Thuringia, whose owner was a secret member of the Organisation Consul. On 17 July, they were confronted by two police detectives. While waiting for reinforcements during the standoff, one of the detectives fired at a window, unknowingly killing Kern by a bullet in the head. Fischer then took his own life.

When the case was brought to court in October 1922, Ernst Werner Techow was the only defendant charged with murder. Twelve more defendants were arraigned on various charges, among them Hans Gerd Techow and Ernst von Salomon, who had spied out Rathenau&#x27;s habits and kept in contact with the Organisation Consul, as well as the commander of the Organisation Consul in Western Germany, Karl Tillessen, a brother of Matthias Erzberger&#x27;s assassin Heinrich Tillessen, and his adjutant Hartmut Plaas. The prosecution left aside the political implications of the plot and focused upon the issue of antisemitism. Before his assassination, Rathenau had been the frequent target of vicious antisemitic attacks, and the assassins had also been members of the violently antisemitic &quot;Deutschvölkischer Schutz- und Trutzbund&quot;. According to Ernst Werner Techow, Kern had argued that Rathenau had to be murdered because he had intimate relations with Bolshevik Russia and had even married his sister to the communist Karl Radek – a complete fabrication – and that Rathenau himself had confessed to being one of the three hundred &quot;Elders of Zion&quot; as described in the notorious antisemitic forgery &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;. (Ernst von Salomon later claimed that Kern&#x27;s argument was merely a pretext. Historian Norman Cohn believes that Techow&#x27;s evidence stands.) 

The defendants vigorously denied that they had killed Rathenau because he was Jewish. The prosecution was unable to fully uncover the involvement of the Organisation Consul in the plot. Tillessen and Plaas were convicted of non-notification of a crime and sentenced to three and two years in prison, respectively. Salomon received five years imprisonment for accessory to murder. Ernst Werner Techow narrowly escaped a death sentence when, in a last-minute confession, he managed to convince the court that he had acted only under the threat of death by Kern. Instead he was sentenced to fifteen years in prison for being an accessory to murder.
Initially, the reactions to Rathenau&#x27;s assassination strengthened the Weimar Republic. The most notable response was the enactment of the Law for the Protection of the Republic, which took effect on 22 July 1922. It set up special courts to address politically motivated violence, established severe penalties for political murders and gave government the authority to ban extremist groups. As long as the Weimar Republic existed, the date 24 June remained a day of public commemorations. In public memory, Rathenau&#x27;s death increasingly appeared to be a martyr-like sacrifice for democracy.

The situation changed with the Nazi seizure of power in 1933. The Nazis systematically wiped out public commemoration of Rathenau by destroying monuments to him, closing the Walther-Rathenau-Museum in his former mansion and renaming streets and schools dedicated to him. Instead, a memorial plate to Kern and Fischer was solemnly unveiled at Saaleck Castle in July 1933, and in October 1933, a monument was erected on the assassins&#x27; grave.

The Nuremberg U-Bahn station Rathenauplatz is not only named after him but also bears his face in portrait along the walls.

==Fictional portrayals==
Rathenau is generally acknowledged to be, in part, the basis for the German noble and industrialist Paul Arnheim, a character in Robert Musil&#x27;s novel &quot;The Man Without Qualities&quot;. Rathenau also appears as the ghostly subject of a Nazi seance in a famous scene in Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s &quot;Gravity%27s Rainbow&quot;. In 2017, the events and aftermath of Rathenau&#x27;s assassination were depicted in the first episode of the National Geographic series &quot;Genius&quot;.
In Kaiserreich, a popular alternative history scenario for the game Hearts of Iron IV, he is credited for predicting the 1936 Berlin Stock Market Crash, known as &quot;Black Monday&quot; and depending on player&#x27;s choice, can become the leading figure of the German&#x27;s Empire&#x27;s recovery from the crisis, through the adaptation of his plan to restructure the German Economy.

<text>Twins is a Hong Kong pop duo formed in 2001 by Emperor Entertainment Group (EEG) and composed of Charlene Choi and Gillian Chung.

Since 2001, the group has released sixteen studio albums (twelve in Cantonese and four in Mandarin), three extended plays, five compilation albums and four live albums. In February 2008, Twins temporarily separated following the Edison Chen photo scandal involving Chung. The group reformed two years later in 2010.

==History==

===2001–2003: Debut and first albums===
Gillian Chung had also worked as a part-time model during one of her summer vacations in Hong Kong. Similar to her erstwhile partner, Charlene Choi was also a part-time model who had appeared in several advertisements. She became famous after her participation in the Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) television program &quot;Y2K&quot;. Both caught the attention of EEG manager Mani Fok (霍汶希). They subsequently auditioned for and later formed the duo known as &quot;Twins&quot;.

Twins signed to Emperor Entertainment Group and were formed on 18 May 2001. According to Mani Fok, EEG&#x27;s plan for Twins was to emulate the success of the Japanese duo KinKi Kids. In August 2001, they released their debut extended play &quot;Twins&quot; (AVEP) with hit single &quot;Open Love, Secret Love, Tutoring Institute&quot;. This EP contained 3 music videos and 6 songs. As part of album promotions, Twins collaborated with MSN to make personal pages and web games. In addition, EEG bundled gifts and coupons with the EP, so that teenage album owners got more value from their purchase by receiving things like hair care products and vouchers for dance courses. It went platinum in its first week of selling. In November, Twins released their second EP &quot;Twins&#x27; Love&quot;, which contained 8 songs and 1 music video for the lead single, &quot;Slam Drunking Love&quot;.

In January 2002, Twins released their third EP &quot;Twins&quot;. The EP contained one CD with five new songs, and a VCD, with 2 music videos. Since it was near Chinese New Year, the single &quot;Ma Bao 668&quot; was a greeting song for Chinese New Year. In May 2002, Twins finally released their debut album &quot;Our Souvenir&quot; with two discs. Disc one, CD contained 10 tracks with single &quot;Er Ren Shi Jie Bei&quot;. Disc two was a VCD, with two music videos. Their debut album (just like a debut EP) was a great success. In August 2002, Twins released second album &quot;Amazing Album&quot;, consisted of two discs, CD with 11 songs, and a DVD with three videos. In 2002, Twins had their first concert ever, and three more in 2003 (which were held in Guangzhou).

Between 2001 and 2003, the duo received a total of 72 total awards. By 2003, they have received a large number of awards from the four major Hong Kong media organizations of RTHK, Commercial Radio Hong Kong, Metro Radio and TVB. In April 2003, they released third album, &quot;Touch of Love&quot;. It contained two discs, CD and DVD. Two months later, in June 2003, the second version of the album was released with a new single and its music video &quot;Bian Bian Bian&quot;. The song was theme for their movie &quot;The Twins Effect&quot; and sung by Twins and Jackie Chan. With the brand new look, Twins released 1 disc 10 track fourth album named &quot;Evolution&quot; in September 2003.

===2004–2005: Continued success with Cantonese releases, &quot;Singing in the Twins Wonderland&quot; albums and Mandarin debut===
In 2004, Twins had released four volumes of their children albums &quot;Singing in the Twins Wonderland&quot;, which were released for little children and it contained English nursery rhymes and stories. In January 2004, Twins released fifth studio album &quot;Magic&quot;, consisted of eleven songs. It was called Magic to emphasis their new musical style and the theme of the album. The Twins&#x27; &quot;Girl Power&quot; was the Olympic-themed album released in June 2004. It came in a special edition package. Included are:
Six mini posters measuring 15&quot; x 20&quot;
Twins Effect 2 beverage coaster
Lucky draw scratch-and-win card for the music VCD. Similar to their previous albums, this album was larger than usual, using a large cardboard book-like package to carry the AVCD and posters. There were six different colored fabric bands wrapped around the package. Included is the theme song for Twins Effect II, (Love Is Invincible, seventh track).

In early 2005, Twins released their debut Mandarin album &quot;Trainee Cupid&quot;. In June 2005, one year after the last Cantopop album, Twins released their sixth studio album &quot;Samba&quot; with the singles &quot;Samba Queen&quot; and &quot;Pink Guitar&quot;. Their seventh studio album &quot;The Missing Piece&quot;, was released in December 2005, after their album &quot;36 Stratagems&quot;. They made a popular concert with the same name where they hugged each other and released a live/video album &quot;Twins: The Missing Piece Concert&quot;.

In December 2005, a rumor mentioned the splitting of the two singers. However, they attended the May 2006 MTV Asia Awards in Thailand together. They were nominated for and won the &quot;Hong Kong Favorite Artist Award&quot;.

===2006–2009: Final albums, touring and disbandment===

In June 2006, they released their second mandarin album &quot;Around the World with 80 Dollars&quot; which was a great success. Tracks &quot;One Time Not Twice&quot; and &quot;I Really Want to Love Him&quot; were nominated, and album &quot;Around the World with 80 Dollars&quot; won Top 10 Gold Songs at the Hong Kong TVB8 Awards, presented by television station TVB8, in 2006. The eighth album &quot;Ho Hoo Tan&quot; was released in September 2006. It consisted of a CD and a DVD with music videos. At the 2006 Hong Kong Entertainment Awards ceremony Choi tearfully acknowledged that there have been criticisms of the Twins&#x27; singing abilities and that she hoped that they could better improve in the coming year.

In February 2007, they celebrated their sixth year together in the Hong Kong music industry. They released a special Sixth Anniversary New + Best Selection CD/DVD. In September of the same year, Twins embarked on a multi-city North American concert tour, with special guests Sun Boy&#x27;Z. International stops included San Francisco, Toronto, and Atlantic City. It was their first time performing on a major tour across several North American cities. In 2007, Twins released their ninth studio album &quot;Twins Party&quot;. The album was a success. It was released in three versions: Twins version, Gillian solo version and Charlene solo version.

In early January 2008, Twins won two major awards at the 2007 Jade Solid Gold Top 10. They earned the most popular group award as well as the most popular Asia Pacific region female artist award. That year, Twins released their third Mandarin and final album before their hiatus, titled &quot;Twins Language&quot;. The group was dragged into the fray when Gillian was involved in the Edison Chen photo scandal. Her private images were among those which found their way onto the internet at the end of February 2008. With Gillian deciding to duck out of the public eye, Twins announced its &quot;temporary dissolution&quot; in July 2008. Charlene said she was highly optimistic that they would reunite some day in the future.

On 16 January 2009, during a TVB interview on &quot;My 2008&quot; (我的2008), Choi talked about how she handled the media. During the 31st RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards hosted in January 2009, Choi said Twins would return.

===2010–2016: Reunion, &quot;3650&quot;, &quot;2 Be Free&quot; and #LOL===

Two years after the split, many wondered whether Twins had become a myth. In February 2010, Charlene Choi talked to the media about her experience in going solo. She summed up the experience by describing the name of her song &quot;Two without one&quot; (二缺一). She said that Twins was a symbol for their generation, and that they would never break up.

On the night of 27 February 2010 the &quot;EEG 10th anniversary concert&quot; was held at The Venetian Macao luxury hotel. A number of singers were present including EEG and non-EEG representatives. Some notables include Joey Yung, Nicholas Tse, Leo Ku, Vincy Chan, William Chan, Yumiko Cheng, Anthony Wong and many more. Gillian Chung and Charlene Choi appeared on stage together for the first time in two years to do a small performance for the anniversary concert. They sang (風箏與風), (下一站天后), (女校男生), (飲歌), (戀愛大過天) and (人人彈起).

A few days later on 3 March, Twins appeared in public at the Harbour plaza after parading around in a purple Porsche. A public announcement was made that Twins would reunite to perform in a three-day &quot;Nokia Twins 2010 concert&quot; from 16 to 18 April at the Hong Kong Coliseum in Hung Hom. The last time they performed at the same stage was four years previously.

In 2011, Twins released their comeback Mandarin album &quot;3650&quot;. They released it as a celebration of 10th anniversary of their first project. The album had many covers, which were their photos (like &quot;Our Souvenir&quot; album cover) that were re-taken in 2011. In March 2012, Twins released their new, twelfth studio album titled &quot;2 Be Free&quot;. Album contained one disc with ten new songs and a DVD with 3 new music videos.

After their album &quot;2 Be Free&quot; was released, Chung and Choi focused on their solo careers again. Chung released two studio albums &quot;Vernicia Flower&quot; (2013) and &quot;Wholly Love&quot; (2014). Choi also released albums &quot;Montage&quot; (2012) and &quot;Blooming&quot; (2013). However, they reunited at 2015 Emperor Group Annual Celebration &amp; Emperor Entertainment Group 15th Anniversary Ceremony on 1 February 2015 in Beijing, China. Twins performed in the Hong Kong Coliseum on the last day of 2015, as well as the first day of 2016 until 4 January. Their last performance was said to be filmed for their upcoming concert DVD and it lasted for 3.5 hours where their last encore was a full hour.

<doc id="164076" wikidata="Q719973" url="?curid=164076" title="Mort Walker">
<text>Addison Morton Walker (September 3, 1923 – January 27, 2018) was an American comic strip writer, best known for creating the newspaper comic strips &quot;Beetle Bailey&quot; in 1950 and &quot;Hi and Lois&quot; in 1954. He signed Addison to some of his strips.

==Early life==
Walker was born in El Dorado, Kansas, as the third of four children in the family. His siblings were Peggy W. Harman (1915–2012), Robin Ellis Walker (1918–2013) and Marilou W. White (1927–2021). After a couple of years, his family moved to Amarillo, Texas, and later to Kansas City, Missouri, in late 1927, where his father, Robin Adair Walker (d. 1950), was an architect, while his mother, Carolyn Richards Walker (d. 1970), worked as a newspaper staff illustrator. He was of Scottish, Irish, and English descent. One of his ancestors was a doctor aboard the &quot;Mayflower&quot;.

During his elementary school years, he drew for a student newspaper. He attended Northeast High School, where he was a cheerleader, school newspaper editor, yearbook art editor, stage actor in a radio show and ran neighborhood teen center that belonged to several organizations. He had his first comic published at age 11 and sold his first cartoon at 12. At age 14, he regularly sold gag cartoons to &quot;Child&#x27;s Life&quot;, &quot;Flying Aces&quot;, and &quot;Inside Detective&quot; magazines. When he was 15, he drew a comic strip, &quot;The Lime Juicers&quot;, for the weekly &quot;Kansas City Journal&quot;, and worked as a staff artist at the same time for an industrial publisher. At age 18, he was the chief editorial designer for Hallmark Brothers (later Hallmark Cards) and was instrumental in changing the company&#x27;s cards from cuddly bears to gag cartoons, which were more suitable for soldiers.

Graduating from Northeast High School, he attended one year at Kansas City Junior College in 1942–43 before going to the University of Missouri. Walker&#x27;s physical presence in Columbia is noted by The Shack, which was a rambling burger joint behind Jesse Hall on Conley Avenue. Images resembling the interior of the shack appeared in &quot;Beetle Bailey&quot; cartoons and is mentioned by name in the September 14, 1950 &quot;Beetle Bailey&quot; strip. Walker visited the Shack on return trips to Columbia with the last being to the original structure in 1978. The Shack was destroyed in a fire in 1988 and Walker returned in 2010 for dedication of a replica of the building in the student center with the dining area now formally called &quot;Mort&#x27;s&quot;. A life-sized bronze statue of Beetle Bailey stands in front of the alumni center which is near The Shack&#x27;s original location.

==Military service==

In 1943, Walker was drafted into the United States Army and served in Italy, where he was an intelligence and investigating officer and was also in charge of an Allied camp for 10,000 German POWs. After the war he was posted to Italy where he was in charge of an Italian guard company. He was discharged as a first lieutenant in 1947.

==Comic strips==
Walker graduated in 1948 from the University of Missouri, where he was the editor and art director of the college&#x27;s humor magazine, &quot;Showme&quot;, and was president of the local Kappa Sigma chapter. After graduation, Walker went to New York to pursue a career in cartooning. He began doing &quot;Spider&quot;, a one-panel series for &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, about a lazy, laid-back college student. When he decided he could make more money doing a multi-panel comic strip, &quot;Spider&quot; morphed into &quot;Beetle Bailey&quot;, eventually distributed by King Features Syndicate to 1,800 newspapers in more than 50 countries for a combined readership of 200 million daily.

In 1954, Walker and Dik Browne teamed to launch &quot;Hi and Lois&quot;, a spin-off of &quot;Beetle Bailey&quot; (Lois was Beetle&#x27;s sister). Under the pseudonym &quot;Addison&quot;, Walker began &quot;Boner&#x27;s Ark&quot; in 1968. Other comic strips created by Walker include &quot;Gamin and Patches&quot;, &quot;Mrs. Fitz&#x27;s Flats&quot;, &quot;The Evermores&quot; (with Johnny Sajem), &quot;Sam&#x27;s Strip&quot;, and &quot;Sam and Silo&quot; (the last two with Jerry Dumas). In 2008 the collection was moved to the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library &amp; Museum at Ohio State University.

In 1974, Walker opened the Museum of Cartoon Art, the first museum devoted to the art of comics. It was initially located in Greenwich, Connecticut, and Rye Brook, New York, before moving to Boca Raton, Florida, in 1992.

During his life he drew special drawings for individuals, in particular for those who were ill.

From previous marriages, Walker and his wife, Catherine, had ten children between them. Walker&#x27;s sons Brian and Greg Walker produce the &quot;Hi and Lois&quot; strip with Chance Browne.

==Books==
In addition to books about comics and children&#x27;s books, Walker has collected his strips into 92 &quot;Beetle Bailey&quot; paperbacks and 35 &quot;Hi and Lois&quot; paperbacks, plus writing his autobiography, &quot;Mort Walker&#x27;s Scrapbook: Celebrating a Life of Love and Laughter&quot;.

In his book &quot;The Lexicon of Comicana&quot; (1980), written as a satirical look at the devices cartoonists use, Walker popularized a vocabulary called &quot;Symbolia&quot;, including the term &quot;squeans&quot; to describe the starbusts and little circles that appear around a cartoon&#x27;s head to indicate intoxication, and grawlixes to indicate the typographical symbols that stand for profanities, which appear in dialogue balloons in the place of actual dialogue.

In 2006, he launched a 24-page magazine, &quot;The Best of Times&quot;, distributed free throughout Connecticut and available online. It features artwork, puzzles, editorial cartoons, ads, and a selection of articles, comics and columns syndicated by King Features. His son, Neal Walker, was the editor and publisher. Between 2006 and 2010, they published 27 issues.

==Exhibitions==
In September 2000, the University of Missouri staged a &quot;Beetle Bailey&quot; 50th-anniversary exhibition in the grand concourse of the Elmer Ellis Library, displaying original daily and Sunday strips, published reprints and poster-size lithographs of selected strips.

<text>Special Branch is a label customarily used to identify units responsible for matters of national security and intelligence in British, Commonwealth, Irish, and other police forces. A Special Branch unit acquires and develops intelligence, usually of a political or sensitive nature, and conducts investigations to protect the State from perceived threats of subversion, particularly terrorism and other extremist political activity.

The first Special Branch, or Special Irish Branch, as it was then known, was a unit of London&#x27;s Metropolitan Police formed in March 1883 to combat the Irish Republican Brotherhood. The name became Special Branch as the unit&#x27;s remit widened to include more than just Irish Republican-related counterespionage.

==Australia==
Most state police forces and the federal police had a Special Branch. They were tasked mainly with monitoring the Communist Party of Australia and related political groups regarded as extremist or subversive. They also focused on German and Japanese activity during World War II.
* The Commonwealth Police Force was formed in 1917 as &quot;a form of federal special branch&quot; under the &quot;War Precautions Act 1914&quot;. It was disbanded in 1919.
* The Commonwealth Police Special Branch was established in 1957. It was absorbed into the Australian Federal Police in 1979.
* The Australian Federal Police Special Branch was renamed the Special Intelligence Branch in 1985 and merged into the Security Intelligence &amp; Diplomatic Liaison Branch in 1995.
* The New South Wales Police Force Subversive Organisations Branch was formed in 1933. It was combined with the Commonwealth Police, Royal Australian Navy Police and Australian Army Police at the outbreak of World War II to form the Military/Police Intelligence Branch. The civilian component was formed back into the Police Subversive Organisations Branch in 1946, which was renamed Special Branch in 1948. The Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service found Special Branch was gathering information on people who posed no threat of politically motivated violence, and as a result it was disbanded in 1997.
* The Queensland Police Special Bureau was formed on 30 July 1940 and renamed Special Branch on 7 April 1948. It has been criticised for being used for political purposes by the Bjelke-Petersen government in the 1970s and 1980s, such as enforcing laws against protests (sometimes outnumbering the protesters or using provocateurs to incite violence so the protesters could be arrested) and investigating and harassing political opponents. It was disbanded in 1989 following a recommendation by the Fitzgerald Inquiry into police corruption. The Special Branch destroyed its records before Fitzgerald could subpoena them.
* South Australia Police formed an Intelligence Branch at the outbreak of World War II in 1939, which was disbanded in 1945. A Subversive Section was established in 1947 and renamed Special Branch in 1949. It amassed files on Australian Labor Party politicians, church leaders, trade unionists and so-called &quot;pink files&quot; on gay community activists at a time when homosexuality was still illegal. The South Australia Police was deliberately vague about the existence of Special Branch. In 1970, Commissioner Harold Salisbury told Premier Don Dunstan that Special Branch did not exist. A 1977 inquiry by Justice White of the Supreme Court of South Australia confirmed the existence and found the files were &quot;scandalously inaccurate, irrelevant to security purposes and outrageously unfair to hundreds, perhaps thousands, of loyal and worthy citizens&quot;. Dunstan sacked Salisbury for misleading Parliament about the existence of the &quot;pink files&quot;. Special Branch was disbanded in 1984.
* The Victoria Police Special Branch was formed in 1931 and disbanded in 1983. Similar work in monitoring terrorism is conducted by the Security Intelligence Group, established in 2000.

==Bahamas==

The Security and Intelligence Branch, also known as Special Branch, is the main domestic intelligence and security service in the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. It is mandated to perform intelligence operations inside the Bahamas to ensure the safety of Bahamian citizens and foreigners. The branch is also mandated to perform background checks on persons who have been recruited for jobs such as police officers and defence force officers and to check persons up for promotions. The Director of the Security Intelligence Branch holds the rank of Chief Superintendent.

==Bangladesh==
The Bangladeshi Special Branch is an intelligence agency of Bangladesh Police. The Special Branch has twelve different sections through which it carries out the directives of the Government and around 64 district based offices, called District Special Branch and also has offices in many Upazila/Thana areas. All the members are recruited from the Bangladesh Police. The chief of the Special Branch has the rank of Additional Inspector General (Addl IGP) and reports directly to the Prime Minister of Bangladesh.

==Belize==
It is responsible for the internal affairs of the country and collecting intelligence on behalf of the security services.

==Brunei==

The ISD was created to replace the Royal Brunei Police&#x27;s Special Branch division, which was disbanded on August 1, 1993.

==Canada==
The RCMP Security Service was a counterintelligence unit or &quot;Special Branch&quot; from 1950 to 1984. It was replaced by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.

==Fiji==
The Special Branch unit of the Fiji Police Force is classed as one of the best intelligence units in the Asia Pacific region. Similar to their Commonwealth counterparts, the Fijian Special Branch deals with matters of national security. They facilitate Interpol, counter terrorism, surveillance, anti-espionage and VIP protection units. Entry into Special Branch is usually by recruitment. Even though it is a police unit, Special Branch also recruits from the Republic of Fiji Military Forces.

The unit&#x27;s name was changed to the Fiji Police Intelligence Bureau in 2009. According to the Fijian government, this was done due to the &quot;impact of modern crimes with other unlawful and illegal activities in national development demands dramatic changes in the Force.&quot; This was also done while the police force was being modernised.

==Hong Kong==

In the face of a perceived direct Communist threat to Hong Kong, an Anti-Communist Squad was established in the Criminal Investigation Department of the then Hong Kong Police by 1930. It was named the &quot;Political Department&quot; in Chinese (政治部). In 1933, the squad&#x27;s English name became &quot;Special Branch&quot; while its Chinese name remained unchanged. In addition to anti-subversion operations, its role during its first two decades also included immigration, passport control and registration of persons.

The division was disbanded in 1995, prior to the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997. Units of SB were reassigned under the Security Wing (Department B) – Crime and Security.

==India==
The Special Branch is a separate wing in the state police agencies in India. Like their counterparts in the United Kingdom, they deal with matters of state security. However, more serious espionage detection is the responsibility of the Intelligence Bureau (IB), India&#x27;s federal internal security agency. The nomenclature varies from state to state, such as &quot;State Special Branch&quot; (SSB), &quot;Special Branch CID&quot; (SB-CID), &quot;State Intelligence Department&quot; (SID),etc.

The Special Branch functions at the state level and is headed by a senior-ranked officer, the Additional Director General of Police (ADGP). The State Special Branch is responsible for collecting, assessing, and collating significant intelligence and communicating it to the government through periodic and special reports. The special branch functions as an intelligence agency and as the eyes and ears of the respective state governments. The special branch consists of several units such as Intelligence, Security, Internal Security, and sub-units like the extremist cell, digital surveillance unit, organized crime cell, VVIP security, bomb detection disposal squad, foreigners cell, passport verification, etc.&quot; 

There have been many allegations that the Special Branch is used by the ruling government for setting up surveillance on their political opponents. The Special Branch has its own Detective Constables, Head Constables, Inspector rankings and superior police officer rankings. Every police station is to have a Special Branch head constable or Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) (working plain clothes or &quot;Mufti&quot;), he would be observing the society in general, and also taking reports from the uniformed police constables on general patrol. The special branch staff play a very important role in collecting advance intelligence about law and order matters as well as illegal activities like cannabis plantation/transportation, illicit attacks, etc. They forward the information to the respective Superintendents of police for necessary action.

==Ireland==

In Ireland, the &#x27;Special Branch&#x27; is known officially as the Special Detective Unit (SDU). The counter-terrorist and counterintelligence unit operates under the auspices of the Crime &amp; Security Branch (CSB) of the &quot;Garda Síochána&quot; (Irish National Police). The SDU is responsible for the investigation of threats to state security and the monitoring of persons and groups who pose a threat on both national and international fronts. The SDU works closely with other special units within the &quot;Garda Síochána&quot;, such as the National Surveillance Unit (NSU) and Emergency Response Unit (ERU), and Ireland&#x27;s national and military intelligence agency – the Defence Forces Directorate of Military Intelligence. The Special Detective Unit has a close working relationship with similar units in other western countries, particularly the United Kingdom, who share information to target, detect and disrupt the activities of terrorists.

==Kenya==
==Malaysia==
The Malaysian Special Branch is an intelligence agency attached to the Royal Malaysian Police (RMP). The SB is empowered to acquire and develop intelligence on internal and external threats to the nation, subversive activities, extremist activities and activities of sabotage and spying. It is also empowered to analyse and advise on the necessary course of action to the various departments and agencies both within the Police Department and other related agencies.

==Myanmar==

The Special Branch under the control of the Myanmar Police Force is also known as the Special Intelligence Department.

==New Zealand==
The New Zealand Police Special Branch was formally created on 29 December 1949. At the time, the-then Police Commissioner Jim Cummings decided that the section of the Police Force dealing with subversive organisations would be designated the Special Branch, following a recent precedent established by a conference of Police Commissioners in Melbourne in November 1949. Its functions included dealing with subversive organisations and vetting public servants. Known targets of the Special Branch included the Communist Party of New Zealand, the Waterside Workers&#x27; Union, and the left-wing New Zealand diplomat and alleged KGB spy Desmond Patrick Costello and the civil servant and intellectual Bill Sutch. In November 1956, the Special Branch&#x27;s functions were transferred to the New Zealand Security Service, which was later renamed the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service.

== Pakistan ==

The Special Branch is an intelligence unit of the Police Service of Pakistan.

==Papua New Guinea==
Special Branch sections of the New Guinea Police Force and Royal Papuan Constabulary, in Australia-controlled Territory of Papua and Territory of New Guinea, were established in 1947. These were merged into the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary in 1950.

== Rhodesia ==
The British South Africa Police (BSAP) developed its Special Branch in the early 1950s amid growing political unrest in the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. It remained active following the dissolution of the federation and was instrumental in creating the Selous Scouts during the Rhodesian Bush War. Following formal recognition of Zimbabwean independence in 1980, the Special Branch was succeeded in part by the Central Intelligence Organisation and later, the Police Internal Security and Intelligence division (PISI).

==Singapore==
The Internal Security Department of Singapore was initially established as the Criminal Intelligence Department in 1918 after the Sepoy Mutiny of 1915. In 1933, the CID was renamed as Special Branch.

In 1939, it was restructured into the Malayan Security Service (MSS) which was not yet fully operational by the time of the outbreak of the Second World War. The MSS was disrupted by the Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation of Singapore and Malaya. It was disbanded in 1948 and two secret branches, one in Singapore and the other in Malaysia, were created.

The Singapore Special Branch (SSB) was first established on 23 August 1948 by the British colonial government, after the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM) launched an armed uprising to establish a communist state. It was structured under the Singapore Police Force and headed by a Deputy Commissioner.

After Singapore achieved independence, the SSB was renamed as the Internal Security Department and became a separate agency on 17 February 1966, together with its foreign counterpart, the Security and Intelligence Division (SID). Both agencies operated under the former Ministry of Interior and Defence until 11 August 1970, when the ministry was split into the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and MHA with SID and ISD falling under the them respectively.

==South Africa==

During Apartheid, the South African Police&#x27;s Security Branch, also known as the Special Branch was a police unit often used to attack anti-Apartheid groups using techniques and tactics including such as conducting surveillance, infiltrating meetings, recruiting informers, and obtaining documents and leaflets. They have also been linked to torture, extralegal detention, and forced disappearances and assassinations against anti-Apartheid activists in the ANC and SACP. They first gained this role in the 1960s, under the regime of Justice Minister &quot;B.J.&quot; Vorster, who convened the Special Branch to target these groups. Controversially, they have also been linked to the bombing of anti-apartheid groups COSATU and SACC during the South African Truth &amp; Reconciliation Committees. It is now the Crime Intelligence Unit which investigates crime but which continues to investigate groups perceived to be enemies of the state such as social movements.

==Sri Lanka==
The Special Branch of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) was created in late 1966 tasked with national security as an intelligence agency attached to Ceylon Police Force. This was closed down in 1970.

==Thailand==
==United Kingdom==
The first Special Branch in the world was that of the Metropolitan Police, formed in London in 1883, with each British police force going on to form its own Special Branch. In Northern Ireland, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (1922–2001) had the RUC Special Branch. Many of those in county and city police forces have since been merged or converted into inter-force regional counter terrorism units and organised crime units.

<text>Ligier () is a French automobile and minibus maker created by former racing driver and rugby player Guy Ligier (1930–2015), specialized in the manufacturing of microcars.
Ligier is best known for its involvement in the Formula 1 World Championship between 1976 and 1996.

In collaboration with Automobiles Martini, the Ligier-Martini entity offered sports prototypes used in endurance or hillclimbing (CN). After the announcement of the creation of the new category LMP3 by the ACO, Ligier and Martini associated with Onroak Automotive (the manufacturer department of OAK Racing) to offer a full range of prototypes (CN, LMP3, LMP1 and LMP2).

==History==

The firm entered the automobile business with the Ligier JS2, a mid-engined sports car for the road initially powered by a Ford V6 and from 1971 by the same Maserati V6 engine as the Citroën SM. The JS2 was considered by many as a well-designed car with a very good power-to-weight ratio. The Ligier motorcars were all designated with the prefix &quot;JS&quot; in honour of Ligier&#x27;s great friend and cohort Jo Schlesser who was killed in the 1968 French Grand Prix while driving for Honda. The final SMs were also produced in the Ligier factory in Vichy. The 1973 energy crisis caused such a decline in the market for the JS2 that production ceased soon after, and the firm changed its focus to microcars, beginning with the 1980 moped-powered Ligier JS4.

One of the world&#x27;s first experimental prototypes of automatic parallel parking was developed on a Ligier electric car at INRIA in the mid-1990s.

In September 2008, Ligier Automobiles completed its acquisition of Beneteau Group&#x27;s Microcar division, with financing provided by 21 Investimenti Partners. Phillipe Ligier, son of the company&#x27;s founder, remains as CEO. The Ligier and Microcar brands are to retain their separate identities and manufacturing facilities. The merger creates Europe&#x27;s second largest microcar manufacturer (after Daimler&#x27;s Smart unit, if one considers that a microcar), and largest manufacturer of drivers license-exempt vehicles.

In 2011, Ligier launched the Duè brand, intended to market lightweight quadricycles at a lower price with a low-cost philosophy. The first model was the Dué First, which was essentially a revised version of the previous Microcar MC1 with simplified design and features to lower the price. After just two years, the Duè brand was integrated into the Microcar range, another brand of the Ligier Group, and the Microcar Dué, a specific and new model, was launched.

In August 2018, Ligier teased a new road-going sports car to celebrate their 50th anniversary. The car will be built in collaboration with Onroak. It will feature a 3.7 liter V6 producing approximately 330 hp, and a 6-speed manual transmission. It will be homologated to FIA E II-SH regulation. More details are to be released in September 2018, and it is expected to go on sale in November 2018 at a price of €89,000.

In 2023, Ligier launches its first electric quadricycle, Mily.

In January 2025, Ligier announced the closure of the Montaigu-Vendée factory, concentrating all production at the Abrest (historic headquarters) plant.

==Models==

The Ligier model line currently consists of the JS50 line of mini cars, the X-Pro line of small commercial vehicles, and the Be Up/Be Two line of open-air, roadster-type vehicles. The company also produces a line of quad bikes and off-road utility vehicles sold as the Be Pro, Be Four, and Be Truck.

The JS50, Ixo, Xtoo, Nova or Ambra are about two and a half meters long and have two seats. They are front-engined. Power units include two 2-cylinder four-stroke diesels of about half a liter displacement and feature a CVT for power transfer.

===EZ10===

The Ligier vehicle that&#x27;s gained the most attention, is &quot;EZ10&quot; &quot;EasyMile&quot;, a self-driving shuttle bus for light city transit. EasyMile SAS develops and markets the autonomous vehicles, and is a joint venture formed in June 2014 by Ligier and Robosoft Technology PTE Ltd (France). The joint venture is the result of the CityMobil2 project co-funded by the European Union&#x27;s Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development (FP7).

One EZ10 minibus can take between 8–10 passengers, and its speed is up to . In 2017, EZ-10 was introduced on the grounds of National Taiwan University in Taipei, and in Tallinn, Estonia.

In conjunction with Estonia&#x27;s presidency of the EU Council, the minibus was presented in Tallinn on 14 July 2017 by EasyMile, and the tech companies in Estonia that co-financed the month-and-a-half-long project to bring the shuttle bus to the country. The buses will serve one line, including a stretch of tram line under reconstruction, and will run in Tallinn until the end of August.

<text>The Civil Contingencies Committee is a British cabinet committee chaired by the Home Secretary. It is intended to deal with major crises such as terrorism or natural disasters. It is supported by the Civil Contingencies Secretariat, which is part of the Cabinet Office.

The Civil Contingencies Committee is held in Cabinet Office Briefing Room A, giving the committee its popular name COBRA. However, this is not an official name, even if it is sometimes used by officials.

The Civil Contingencies Committee, through the Civil Contingencies Secretariat, operates a website, &quot;UK Resilience&quot;, which is intended as a central source of public information on British civil defence and disaster preparedness activities.

<text>The Civil Contingencies Secretariat (CCS), created in July 2001 and disbanded in July 2022, was the executive department of the British Cabinet Office responsible for emergency planning in the UK. The role of the secretariat was to ensure the United Kingdom&#x27;s resilience against disruptive challenge, and to do this by working with others to anticipate, assess, prevent, prepare, respond and recover. Until its creation in 2001, emergency planning in Britain was the responsibility of the Home Office. The CCS also supports the Civil Contingencies Committee, also known as COBR (or popularly – but incorrectly – as COBRA).

==Formation==

In the aftermath of the Y2K bug scare, the fuel protests of 2000, flooding in autumn 2000, and the foot and mouth epidemic of 2001 the UK government felt that the existing emergency management policies and structures were inadequate to deal with natural or man-made disasters, and formed the Civil Contingencies Secretariat in July 2001, located in the Cabinet Office. Soon after the 9/11 attacks the remit of the CCS was expanded to include mitigating the consequences of a large scale terrorist attack.

Until 2001 the Home Office carried out emergency preparedness planning through its Emergency Planning Division, which in turn replaced the Home Defence and Emergency Services Division. From 1935 to 1971 a separate department, called the Civil Defence Department (in the early years the Air Raid Precautions Department, Ministry of Home Security), existed.

==Remit and reporting==

In 2002 David Blunkett, then Home Secretary, stated, in a written reply to a parliamentary question: 

He went on to state:
The Civil Contingencies Committee, often informally referred to as COBR from the name of the room used, is a forum for ministers and senior officials to discuss and manage serious (level 2) and catastrophic (level 3) emergencies.

In 2010, the secretariat launched an emergency communications service based on the Skynet military communication satellite system, called High Integrity Telecommunications System, for use by UK police and other emergency services, primarily at Strategic Command Centres and at major events and emergencies. It replaced the earlier Emergency Communications Network.

Serco operates the Emergency Planning College in Easingwold, North Yorkshire under contract to the secretariat.

==Structure==

The secretariat was led by a director and initially comprised five divisions dealing with:

*Assessment assessing known risks and scanning for future potential risks
*Capability Management working with departments facing potential disruption, and advising on how to prevent or manage crisis
*Communication and Learning including the News Co-ordination Centre in the Cabinet Office and the Emergency Planning College
*National Resilience Framework developing partnerships between governmental agencies, voluntary agencies, local communities and private sector groups
*Programme Co-ordination providing secretariat support for the Civil Contingencies Committee

In 2012, the CCS still had five sections, with a slightly different emphasis:

*Capabilities
*Local Response Capabilities
*Emergency Planning College
*Horizon Scanning &amp; Response
*Natural Hazards Team

== Reform and disbandment ==
Following the Covid pandemic, and as a result of the risks faced by the UK becoming more complex, interconnected and demanding, the Cabinet Office made changes in July 2022 to support how the government responds to emergencies and to improve the long-term resilience of the UK. The Civil Contingencies Secretariat was split into two separate resilience functions:

* The COBR Unit, which will continue to lead the government&#x27;s response to crisis, domestic and international, malicious and non-malicious
* A Resilience Directorate, which will lead the government&#x27;s efforts to bolster the UK&#x27;s resilience. This unit is responsible for the government&#x27;s work on national resilience, managing the resilience system, resilience frameworks and risk processes.

==Directors of the Civil Contingencies Secretariat==
*Mike Granatt, CB (20012002)
*Susan Scholefield, CMG (20022004)
*Bruce Mann (20042009)
*Christina Scott (20092013)
*Campbell McCafferty (20132016)
*Katharine Hammond (20162020) 
*Roger Hargreaves (20202022)

==Documents issued==

The CCS has produced the following documents:
*Emergency Response and Recovery which provides non-statutory guidance to accompany the Civil Contingencies Act 2004. First published in November 2005, it was last updated in October 2013.
