<text>&quot;Song of Myself&quot; is a poem by Walt Whitman (18191892) that is included in his work &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;. It has been credited as &quot;representing the core of Whitman&#x27;s poetic vision.&quot;

==Publication history==
The poem was first published without sections as the first of twelve untitled poems in the first (1855) edition of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;. The first edition was published by Whitman at his own expense.

In the second (1856) edition, Whitman used the title &quot;Poem of Walt Whitman, an American,&quot; which was shortened to &quot;Walt Whitman&quot; for the third (1860) edition.

The poem was divided into fifty-two numbered sections for the fourth (1867) edition and finally took on the title &quot;Song of Myself&quot; in the last edition (1891–2). The number of sections is generally thought to mirror the number of weeks in the year.

==Reception==
Following its 1855 publication, &quot;Song of Myself&quot; was immediately singled out by critics and readers for particular attention, and the work remains among the most acclaimed and influential in American poetry. In 2011, writer and academic Jay Parini named it the greatest American poem ever written.

In 1855, the &quot;Christian Spiritualist&quot; gave a long, glowing review of &quot;Song of Myself&quot;, praising Whitman for representing &quot;a new poetic mediumship,&quot; which through active imagination sensed the &quot;influx of spirit and the divine breath.&quot; Ralph Waldo Emerson also wrote a letter to Whitman, praising his work for its &quot;wit and wisdom&quot;.

Public acceptance was slow in coming, however. Social conservatives denounced the poem as flouting accepted norms of morality due to its blatant depictions of human sexuality. In 1882, Boston&#x27;s district attorney threatened action against &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; for violating the state&#x27;s obscenity laws and demanded that changes be made to several passages from &quot;Song of Myself&quot;.

==Literary style==

The poem is written in Whitman&#x27;s signature free verse style. Whitman, who praises words &quot;as simple as grass&quot; (section 39) forgoes standard verse and stanza patterns in favor of a simple, legible style that can appeal to a mass audience.

Critics have noted a strong Transcendentalist influence on the poem. In section 32, for instance, Whitman expresses a desire to &quot;live amongst the animals&quot; and to find divinity in the insects.

In addition to this romanticism, the poem seems to anticipate a kind of realism that would only become important in United States literature after the American Civil War. In the following 1855 passage, for example, one can see Whitman&#x27;s inclusion of the gritty details of everyday life:The lunatic is carried at last to the asylum a confirm&#x27;d case,&lt;br&gt;
(He will never sleep any more as he did in the cot in his mother&#x27;s bed-room;)&lt;br&gt;
The jour printer with gray head and gaunt jaws works at his case,&lt;br&gt;
He turns his quid of tobacco while his eyes blurr with the manuscript;&lt;br&gt;
The malform&#x27;d limbs are tied to the surgeon&#x27;s table,&lt;br&gt;
What is removed drops horribly in a pail;&lt;br&gt;
The quadroon girl is sold at the auction-stand, the drunkard nods by the bar-room stove, ... (section 15)
==&quot;Self&quot;==
In the poem, Whitman emphasizes an all-powerful &quot;I&quot; which serves as narrator, who should not be limited to or confused with the person of the historical Walt Whitman. The persona described has transcended the conventional boundaries of self: &quot;I pass death with the dying, and birth with the new-washed babe ... and am not contained between my hat and boots&quot; (section 7).

There are several other quotes from the poem that make it apparent that Whitman does not consider the narrator to represent a single individual. Rather, he seems to be narrating for all:

* &quot;For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.&quot; (Section 1)
* &quot;In all people I see myself, none more and not one a barleycorn less/and the good or bad I say of myself I say of them&quot; (Section 20)
* &quot;It is you talking just as much as myself... I act as the tongue of you&quot; (Section 47)
* &quot;I am large, I contain multitudes.&quot; (Section 51)

Alice L. Cook and John B. Mason offer representative interpretations of the &quot;self&quot; as well as its importance in the poem. Cook writes that the key to understanding the poem lies in the &quot;concept of self&quot; (typified by Whitman) as &quot;both individual and universal,&quot; while Mason discusses &quot;the reader’s involvement in the poet’s movement from the singular to the cosmic&quot;. The &quot;self&quot; serves as a human ideal; in contrast to the archetypal self in epic poetry, this self is one of the common people rather than a hero. Nevertheless, Whitman locates heroism in every individual as an expression of the whole (the &quot;leaf&quot; among the &quot;grass&quot;).

==Uses in other media==
Canadian doctor and long-time Whitman friend Richard Maurice Bucke analyzed the poem in his influential and widely read 1898 book &quot;Cosmic Consciousness&quot;, as part of his investigation of the development of man&#x27;s mystic relation to the infinite.

Simon Wilder delivers this poem to Monty Kessler in &quot;With Honors&quot;. Walt Whitman&#x27;s work features prominently throughout the film, and Simon Wilder is often referred to as Walt Whitman&#x27;s ghost.

A line from 52 from Song of Myself is featured in the film &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot; directed by Peter Weir. The line refers to the sounding of the &#x27;barbaric yawp&#x27;, which often illustrates the urgency of the films protagonists and was read out to them by their English teacher John Keating, played by Robin Williams.

The poem figures in the plot of the 2008 young adult novel &quot;Paper Towns&quot; by John Green.

A documentary project, Whitman Alabama, featured residents of Alabama reading Whitman verses on camera.

The poem is central to the plot of the play &quot;I and You&quot; by Lauren Gunderson.

&quot;Song of Myself&quot; was a major inspiration for the symphonic metal album &quot;Imaginaerum&quot; (2011) by Nightwish, as well as the fantasy film based on that album.

<text>In mathematics, a ball is the solid figure bounded by a &quot;sphere&quot;; it is also called a solid sphere. It may be a closed ball (including the boundary points that constitute the sphere) or an open ball (excluding them).

These concepts are defined not only in three-dimensional Euclidean space but also for lower and higher dimensions, and for metric spaces in general. A &quot;ball&quot; in dimensions is called a hyperball or -ball and is bounded by a &quot;hypersphere&quot; or ()-sphere. Thus, for example, a ball in the Euclidean plane is the same thing as a disk, the area bounded by a circle. In Euclidean 3-space, a ball is taken to be the volume bounded by a 2-dimensional sphere. In a one-dimensional space, a ball is a line segment.

In other contexts, such as in Euclidean geometry and informal use, &quot;sphere&quot; is sometimes used to mean &quot;ball&quot;. In the field of topology the closed formula_1-dimensional ball is often denoted as formula_2 or formula_3 while the open formula_1-dimensional ball is formula_5 or formula_6.

==In Euclidean space==
In Euclidean -space, an (open) -ball of radius and center is the set of all points of distance less than from . A closed -ball of radius is the set of all points of distance less than or equal to away from .

In Euclidean -space, every ball is bounded by a hypersphere. The ball is a bounded interval when , is a disk bounded by a circle when , and is bounded by a sphere when .

=== Volume ===

The -dimensional volume of a Euclidean ball of radius in -dimensional Euclidean space is:
formula_7
where  is Leonhard Euler&#x27;s gamma function (which can be thought of as an extension of the factorial function to fractional arguments). Using explicit formulas for particular values of the gamma function at the integers and half integers gives formulas for the volume of a Euclidean ball that do not require an evaluation of the gamma function. These are:
formula_8

In the formula for odd-dimensional volumes, the double factorial is defined for odd integers as .

==In general metric spaces==
Let be a metric space, namely a set with a metric (distance function) , and let be a positive real number. The open (metric) ball of radius centered at a point in , usually denoted by or , is defined the same way as a Euclidean ball, as the set of points in of distance less than away from ,
formula_9

The &quot;closed&quot; (metric) ball, sometimes denoted or , is likewise defined as the set of points of distance less than or equal to away from ,
formula_10

In particular, a ball (open or closed) always includes itself, since the definition requires . A unit ball (open or closed) is a ball of radius 1.

A ball in a general metric space need not be round. For example, a ball in real coordinate space under the Chebyshev distance is a hypercube, and a ball under the taxicab distance is a cross-polytope. A closed ball also need not be compact. For example, a closed ball in any infinite-dimensional normed vector space is never compact. However, a ball in a vector space will always be convex as a consequence of the triangle inequality.

A subset of a metric space is bounded if it is contained in some ball. A set is totally bounded if, given any positive radius, it is covered by finitely many balls of that radius.

The open balls of a metric space can serve as a base, giving this space a topology, the open sets of which are all possible unions of open balls. This topology on a metric space is called the topology induced by the metric .

Let formula_11 denote the closure of the open ball formula_12 in this topology. While it is always the case that formula_13 it is always the case that formula_14 For example, in a metric space formula_15 with the discrete metric, one has formula_16 but formula_17 for any formula_18

==In normed vector spaces==
Any normed vector space with norm formula_19 is also a metric space with the metric formula_20 In such spaces, an arbitrary ball formula_21 of points formula_22 around a point formula_23 with a distance of less than formula_24 may be viewed as a scaled (by formula_24) and translated (by formula_23) copy of a &quot;unit ball&quot; formula_27 Such &quot;centered&quot; balls with formula_28 are denoted with formula_29

The Euclidean balls discussed earlier are an example of balls in a normed vector space.

===-norm===
In a Cartesian space with the -norm , that is one chooses some formula_30 and definesformula_31Then an open ball around the origin with radius formula_24 is given by the set
formula_33For , in a 2-dimensional plane formula_34, &quot;balls&quot; according to the -norm (often called the &quot;taxicab&quot; or &quot;Manhattan&quot; metric) are bounded by squares with their &quot;diagonals&quot; parallel to the coordinate axes; those according to the -norm, also called the Chebyshev metric, have squares with their &quot;sides&quot; parallel to the coordinate axes as their boundaries. The -norm, known as the Euclidean metric, generates the well known disks within circles, and for other values of , the corresponding balls are areas bounded by Lamé curves (hypoellipses or hyperellipses).

For , the - balls are within octahedra with axes-aligned &quot;body diagonals&quot;, the -balls are within cubes with axes-aligned &quot;edges&quot;, and the boundaries of balls for with are superellipsoids. generates the inner of usual spheres.

Often can also consider the case of formula_35 in which case we define formula_36

===General convex norm===
More generally, given any centrally symmetric, bounded, open, and convex subset of , one can define a norm on where the balls are all translated and uniformly scaled copies of . Note this theorem does not hold if &quot;open&quot; subset is replaced by &quot;closed&quot; subset, because the origin point qualifies but does not define a norm on .

==In topological spaces==

One may talk about balls in any topological space , not necessarily induced by a metric. An (open or closed) -dimensional topological ball of is any subset of which is homeomorphic to an (open or closed) Euclidean -ball. Topological -balls are important in combinatorial topology, as the building blocks of cell complexes.

Any open topological -ball is homeomorphic to the Cartesian space and to the open unit -cube (hypercube) . Any closed topological -ball is homeomorphic to the closed -cube .

An -ball is homeomorphic to an -ball if and only if . The homeomorphisms between an open -ball and can be classified in two classes, that can be identified with the two possible topological orientations of .

A topological -ball need not be smooth; if it is smooth, it need not be diffeomorphic to a Euclidean -ball.

==Regions==

A number of special regions can be defined for a ball:
*&quot;cap&quot;, bounded by one plane
*&quot;sector&quot;, bounded by a conical boundary with apex at the center of the sphere
*&quot;segment&quot;, bounded by a pair of parallel planes
*&quot;shell&quot;, bounded by two concentric spheres of differing radii
*&quot;wedge&quot;, bounded by two planes passing through a sphere center and the surface of the sphere

<text>In number theory, a probable prime (PRP) is an integer that satisfies a specific condition that is satisfied by all prime numbers, but which is not satisfied by most composite numbers. Different types of probable primes have different specific conditions. While there may be probable primes that are composite (called pseudoprimes), the condition is generally chosen in order to make such exceptions rare.

Fermat&#x27;s test for compositeness, which is based on Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, works as follows: given an integer &quot;n&quot;, choose some integer &quot;a&quot; that is not a multiple of &quot;n&quot;; (typically, we choose &quot;a&quot; in the range ). Calculate . If the result is not 1, then &quot;n&quot; is composite. If the result is 1, then &quot;n&quot; is likely to be prime; &quot;n&quot; is then called a probable prime to base &quot;a&quot;. A weak probable prime to base &quot;a&quot; is an integer that is a probable prime to base &quot;a&quot;, but which is not a strong probable prime to base &quot;a&quot; (see below).

For a fixed base &quot;a&quot;, it is unusual for a composite number to be a probable prime (that is, a pseudoprime) to that base. For example, up to , there are 11,408,012,595 odd composite numbers, but only 21,853 pseudoprimes base 2. The number of odd primes in the same interval is 1,091,987,404.

==Properties==
Probable primality is a basis for efficient primality testing algorithms, which find application in cryptography. These algorithms are usually probabilistic in nature. The idea is that while there are composite probable primes to base &quot;a&quot; for any fixed &quot;a&quot;, we may hope there exists some fixed &quot;P&quot;&lt;1 such that for &quot;any&quot; given composite &quot;n&quot;, if we choose &quot;a&quot; at random, then the probability that &quot;n&quot; is pseudoprime to base &quot;a&quot; is at most &quot;P&quot;. If we repeat this test &quot;k&quot; times, choosing a new &quot;a&quot; each time, the probability of &quot;n&quot; being pseudoprime to all the &quot;a&quot;s tested is hence at most &quot;Pk&quot;, and as this decreases exponentially, only moderate &quot;k&quot; is required to make this probability negligibly small (compared to, for example, the probability of computer hardware error).

This is unfortunately false for weak probable primes, because there exist Carmichael numbers; but it is true for more refined notions of probable primality, such as strong probable primes (&quot;P&quot; = 1/4, Miller–Rabin algorithm), or
Euler probable primes (&quot;P&quot; = 1/2, Solovay–Strassen algorithm).

Even when a deterministic primality proof is required, a useful first step is to test for probable primality. This can quickly eliminate (with certainty) most composites.

A PRP test is sometimes combined with a table of small pseudoprimes to quickly establish the primality of a given number smaller than some threshold.

==Variations==
An Euler probable prime to base &quot;a&quot; is an integer that is indicated prime by the somewhat stronger theorem that for any prime &quot;p&quot;, &quot;a&quot;(&quot;p&quot;−1)/2 equals formula_1 modulo &quot;p&quot;, where formula_1 is the Jacobi symbol. An Euler probable prime which is composite is called an Euler–Jacobi pseudoprime to base &quot;a&quot;. The smallest Euler-Jacobi pseudoprime to base 2 is 561. There are 11347 Euler-Jacobi pseudoprimes base 2 that are less than 25·109.

This test may be improved by using the fact that the only square roots of 1 modulo a prime are 1 and −1. Write &quot;n&quot; = &quot;d&quot; · 2&quot;s&quot; + 1, where &quot;d&quot; is odd. The number &quot;n&quot; is a strong probable prime (SPRP) to base &quot;a&quot; if:

: formula_3
or
: formula_4

A composite strong probable prime to base &quot;a&quot; is called a strong pseudoprime to base &quot;a&quot;. Every strong probable prime to base &quot;a&quot; is also an Euler probable prime to the same base, but not vice versa.

The smallest strong pseudoprime base 2 is 2047. There are 4842 strong pseudoprimes base 2 that are less than 25·109.

There are also Lucas probable primes, which are based on Lucas sequences. A Lucas probable prime test can be used alone. The Baillie–PSW primality test combines a Lucas test with a strong probable prime test.

===Example of testing for a strong probably prime===
To test whether 97 is a strong probable prime base 2:
* Step 1: Find formula_5 and formula_6 for which formula_7, where formula_5 is odd
** Beginning with formula_9, formula_5 would be formula_11
** Increasing formula_6, we see that formula_13 and formula_14, since formula_15
* Step 2: Choose formula_16, formula_17. We will choose formula_18.
* Step 3: Calculate formula_19, i.e. formula_20. Since it isn&#x27;t congruent to formula_21, we continue to test the next condition
* Step 4: Calculate formula_22 for formula_23. If it is congruent to formula_11, formula_25 is probably prime. Otherwise, formula_25 is definitely composite
** formula_27
** formula_28
** formula_29
** formula_30
* Therefore, formula_25 is a strong probable prime base 2 (and is therefore a probable prime base 2).

<text>Darlington is a market town in the Borough of Darlington, County Durham, England. It lies on the River Skerne, west of Middlesbrough and south of Durham. Darlington had a population of 107,800 at the 2021 Census, making it a &quot;large town&quot; and one of the largest settlements in North East England. The town is linked to London, Leeds, Newcastle and Edinburgh by the East Coast Main Line and the A1.

==History==
===Darnton===

Darlington started as an Anglo-Saxon settlement. The name derives from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Dearthington&quot;, which seemingly meant &#x27;the settlement of Deornoth&#x27;s people&#x27; but, by Norman times, the name had changed to Derlinton. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the town was usually known by the name of &quot;Darnton&quot;.

Darlington has a historic market area in the town centre. St Cuthbert&#x27;s Church, built in 1183, is one of the most important early English churches in the north of England and is Grade I listed. The oldest church in Darlington is St Andrew&#x27;s Church, built around 1100 in Haughton-le-Skerne.

When the author Daniel Defoe visited the town during the 18th century, he noted that it was eminent for &quot;good bleaching of linen, so that I have known cloth brought from Scotland to be bleached here&quot;. However, he also disparaged the town, writing that it had &quot;nothing remarkable but dirt&quot;; roads would have typically been unpaved in the 18th century. 

The so-called &quot;Durham Ox&quot; came from Darlington; born in the early 19th century, this steer became renowned for its excellent proportions which came to inform the standard for Shorthorn cattle.

===Victorian era===
====Stivvies====
During the early 19th century, Darlington remained a small market town.

The Stockton and Darlington Railway ran steam locomotives designed for passengers and goods, built to a standard gauge, on a permanent main line with branches. On 27 September 1825, George Stephenson&#x27;s engine, &quot;Locomotion No. 1&quot;, travelled between Shildon and Stockton-on-Tees via Darlington, an event that was seen as ushering in the modern railway age.

Later in the 19th century, the town became an important centre for railway manufacturing. An early railway works was the Hopetown Carriage Works (est. 1853), which supplied carriages and locomotives to the Stockton and Darlington Railway. The engineering firm of William and Alfred Kitching also manufactured locomotives there around this time. The town eventually developed three significant railway works:
* The largest of these was the main line Darlington Works; its main factory, the North Road Shops, opened in 1863 and remained in operation until 1966. 
* Robert Stephenson &amp; Co. (colloquially: &quot;Stivvies&quot;), moved to Darlington from Newcastle upon Tyne in 1902. It was renamed &quot;Robert Stephensons &amp; Hawthorns&quot; in 1937, was absorbed by English Electric around 1960 and had closed by 1964. 
* Faverdale Wagon Works was established in 1923 and closed in 1962; in the 1950s, it was a UK pioneer in applying mass-production techniques to the manufacture of railway goods wagons.

====Quakers and the Echo====
During the 19th century, Darlington Quaker families such as those of Pease and Backhouse emerged as major employers and philanthropists. Industrialist Joseph Pease gave Darlington its landmark clock tower in 1864. The clock face was crafted by T. Cooke &amp; Sons of York, and bells cast by John Warner &amp; Sons of nearby Norton-on-Tees. The bells are sisters to Big Ben.

Darlington Mechanics Institute was opened in 1854 by Elizabeth Pease Nichol, who had donated towards its cost. In 1853, South Park was laid out, over , with financial support from the Backhouse family.

Architect Alfred Waterhouse, famous for work including London&#x27;s Natural History Museum and Manchester Town Hall, designed Darlington&#x27;s Grade II listed Old Town Hall and Market Hall, Darlington in 1860. Four years later he contributed Backhouse&#x27;s Bank building that is, , a branch of Barclays bank.

During the period, George Gordon Hoskins was responsible for much of the town&#x27;s architecture, designing buildings such as The King&#x27;s Head Hotel.

Darlington Free Library, a Grade II listed building in Crown Street, was built for £10,000 by Edward Pease. His daughter, Lady Lymington, opened the building on 23 October 1885 and presented it to the town council who agreed to operate it in perpetuity. , it contains a library and &quot;centre for local studies&quot;.

In 1870, &quot;The Northern Echo&quot; newspaper launched. Its most famous editor, William Thomas Stead, died on the &quot;Titanic&quot;. Facing the present &quot;Northern Echo&quot; building on Priestgate is the William Stead public house named for him.

===Wars===

In 1939, Darlington had the most cinema seats per capita in the United Kingdom.

On the night of 13 January 1945, a Lancaster bomber piloted by Pilot Officer William Stuart McMullen of Canada was on a training exercise when one of its engines caught fire and it crashed on farmland near Lingfield Lane. McMullen heroically stayed at the controls while his crew parachuted to safety and directed the stricken aircraft away from the houses below. He was killed on impact. His heroism was honoured by renaming Lingfield Lane &quot;McMullen Road&quot; and erecting a memorial monument.

===Tornado and the brick train===
Starting in 1993, rail enthusiast group A1 Steam Locomotive Trust worked on building an all-new steam locomotive, the first to be constructed since the 1960s. It was intended to be the 50th member of the long withdrawn LNER Peppercorn Class A1 engine, called &quot;Tornado&quot; and numbered 60163, from scratch in the 1853 former Stockton and Darlington Railway Carriage Works at Hopetown. Many of the original fleet had been built at Darlington locomotive works in the late 1940s. &quot;Tornado&quot; was completed in January 2008.

To commemorate the town&#x27;s contribution to the railways, David Mach&#x27;s 1997 work &quot;Train&quot; is located alongside the A66, close to the original Stockton–Darlington railway. It is a life-size brick sculpture of a steaming locomotive emerging from a tunnel, made from 185,000 Accrington Nori bricks. The work had a budget of £760,000.

===21st century===

In 2001, Darlington became the first place in England to allow same-sex civil ceremonies and , it hosts an annual Gay Pride Festival at venues across the town. A 2005 Darlington Borough Council project to pedestrianise areas of the town centre, this included some Victorian features along High Row. In August 2008, a fire, in which nobody was killed, caused damage and weeks of closure until the damage fixed for several shops (including Woolworths). The King&#x27;s Head Hotel was also affected with damage to the roof and 100 bedrooms, the hotel was able to reopen in 2012.

==Governance==
There is one main tier of local government covering Darlington, at unitary authority level, being Darlington Borough Council. The council is a member of the Tees Valley Combined Authority, led by the directly elected Mayor of Tees Valley. Most of the built-up area of Darlington is an unparished area, although some outer parts of the urban area now extend into neighbouring parishes. The council is based at Darlington Town Hall on Feethams in the centre of Darlington.

Darlington was an ancient parish. It was historically divided into four townships: Archdeacon Newton, Blackwell, Cockerton, and a Darlington township covering the town itself and adjoining areas. Such townships also became civil parishes in 1866. A body of improvement commissioners was established in 1823 to provide infrastructure to the more built-up parts of the Darlington township. The commissioners were superseded in 1850 when the whole Darlington township was made a local board district, governed by an elected local board.

The local board was in turn replaced when Darlington was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1867. The borough boundaries were enlarged on several occasions, notably absorbing the Harrowgate Hill area from the parish of Haughton-le-Skerne in 1872, Cockerton in 1915, Haughton-le-Skerne in 1930 and Blackwell in 1967. In 1915 the borough was elevated to become a county borough, taking over county-level functions from Durham County Council.

The borough was substantially enlarged in 1974 to take in most of the surrounding Darlington Rural District, such that the modern borough of Darlington covers both the town and a surrounding rural hinterland. The enlarged borough was also reconstituted as a non-metropolitan district as part of the 1974 reforms, with Durham County Council once more providing county-level services to the town. The borough was made a unitary authority on 1 April 1997, regaining its independence from the county council. The borough remains part of County Durham for ceremonial purposes.

Since 2016, the council has been a member of the Tees Valley Combined Authority along with Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Redcar and Cleveland and Stockton-on-Tees. Unlike Darlington, the other four districts in the combined authority had all been part of the short-lived county of Cleveland between 1974 and 1996.

, the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Darlington constituency is Labour&#x27;s Lola McEvoy. Former members of parliament for the town include Peter Gibson, Jenny Chapman, Alan Milburn (the former Secretary of State for Health under Tony Blair&#x27;s Labour government) and Michael Fallon (who was Secretary of State for Defence under David Cameron&#x27;s coalition government and Theresa May&#x27;s Conservative government).

==Geography==

Darlington is located in the south of County Durham close to the River Tees, which acts as the border between Durham and Yorkshire. Both the River Tees and River Skerne pass through the borough, the Skerne later joining the Tees which then flows east and into the North Sea. Due to river bifurcation at the Baydale Beck and Cocker Beck, which later flow into the Tees and Skerne respectively, much of the western side of Darlington forms a river island.

===Areas within the borough===
In the north are Harrowgate, Coatham Mundeville and Beaumont Hill and to the north-east are Whinfield and Haughton Le Skerne. To the east is the suburb of Eastbourne and Red Hall with Firthmoor and Skerne Park to the south. Situated in the west end are Hummersknott, Mowden and Blackwell. Finally, to the north-west are Branksome, Cockerton, Faverdale, The Denes, West Park, High Grange and Pierremont which is associated with the notable Henry Pease (MP).
===Distance to nearby towns ===
==Economy==
The trend of regional gross value added of Darlington at current basic prices published (pp. 240–253) by the Office for National Statistics, with figures in £ millions.

Finance and manufacturing are now the main elements of its economy.

===Government and service sector===
The English division of the Student Loans Company, Student Finance England, is based at Lingfield Point and employs over 1,000 people. 

The Civil Service’s Darlington Economic Campus (DEC), opened in 2022 at its temporary home in Feethams House, is home to staff from various government departments including: 

* HM Treasury 
* Department for Business and Trade
* Department for Energy Security and Net Zero
* Office of National Statistics
* Competition and Markets Authority
* Department for Education
* Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government
* Department for Culture, Media and Sport
Darlington Building Society is based in the town. 

Darlington Borough Council announced that the site for the DL1 complex, previously a car park for Darlington Town Hall, was also to be redeveloped to house riverside office space for the Department for Education to replace its previous office on the edge of the town in Mowden, in an effort to safeguard Darlington jobs. This was officially opened on 19 March 2015. The Disclosure and Barring Service has a national office in the town. Amazon UK operates a warehouse facility, which opened in early 2020, employing 1,300 full-time staff, one of the town&#x27;s biggest employers.

EE is the largest private sector employer in the town, with 2,500 staff. The company took over its operations from one of its predecessors, Orange Mobile.

===Morton Park===
The Morton Park area of Darlington is currently undergoing a partial redevelopment, with areas of unused waste land being redeveloped into modern industrial and office space. Other commercial spaces in Darlington include North Road Industrial Estate, Cleveland Trading Estate and Faverdale Industrial Estate. The council depot on Central Park is also to be redeveloped into commercial space.

===Engineering===
Darlington has a rich engineering heritage and several notable engineering firms established locally. Bridge building was particularly important in the town. Bridges built in Darlington span the River Nile and Amazon.

Local engineering firms include:
* Cummins has an engine building facility near Morton Park.
* AMEC&#x27;s industrial arm is headquartered in the town
* Darlington Forge Company originated in the town, 
* Whessoe originated in Darlington.

===Retail and leisure===
As an historic market town, a weekly outdoor market was held on the market square, which is one of the biggest in the country. An indoor market is located underneath the town clock on Prebend Row.

Retailers in the area include:
* Prebend Row hosts the Cornmill Shopping centre
* Grange Road and Skinnergate has a number of independent shops
* Duke Street houses art galleries and restaurants
* Argos, a UK retail company, has its largest warehouse distribution centre in the North of England located in Darlington; it is sited within the Faverdale Industrial Estate, in the north-west of the town. 

In November 2012, a deal was signed between Darlington Borough Council and developer Terrace Hill for a £30 million re-development of the site of the former Feethams bus depot. The proposal had an expected completion date of late 2014, though this did overrun with completion early 2016.

===Hospitals===
Darlington Memorial Hospital is on Hollyhurst Road, in the corridor between Woodland Road and The Denes. The private Woodlands Hospital is at Morton Park.

==Culture and landmarks==
===Theatre===
The former Civic Theatre, now &quot;The Hippodrome&quot;, is a popular arts venue in the town, hosting a mix of musicals, dramas, plays and pantomimes. In 2016, Darlington Civic Theatre closed to mark the start of a £12.3 million renovation project that included a £4.5 million lottery grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and revamped as &quot;The Hippodrome&quot; and connects to the children&#x27;s theatre &quot;Hullabaloo&quot;.

===Friends&#x27; Meeting House ===
The Friends&#x27; Meeting House in Skinnergate is a Grade II* listed building. The Friends (Quakers) have met on this site since 1678, having previously met in private homes. The present building dates mainly from 1846. Upstairs of The Quaker meeting house is home to Artist Lucas Roy. Lucas is an international fine artist who gained credit for his early work dedicated to the NHS during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

===Forum Music Centre===
The Forum Music Centre, opened in 2004, hosts regular live music events, from Ska and Punk to Indie and Classic Rock. It also runs a comedy club. As well as live music, the facility houses a state of the art recording studio and several rehearsal rooms. The Carmel Rhythm Club, at Carmel College in the Hummersknott end of town, was another music venue. It opened the same year as the Forum.

===Dog show===
Darlington Dog Show was a championship event from 1969. It was usually held in September on the showground in South Park; but it has now moved to Ripon.

===Churches===
Darlington has a wide array of churches scattered around the town including the iconic and notable parish church of St Cuthbert&#x27;s in the centre of town, with a towering spire and a grade I listed status. Other churches include Methodist, Baptist, Roman Catholic and Jehovah Witness places of worship, as well as Holy Trinity Church and the grade II listed St John the Evangelist Church which closed for worship in 2023.

===Mosque===
The Jamia Mosque and Islamic Society of Darlington is located in the North Lodge Terrace area of the town, an area with a relatively high proportion of ethnic minority residents (39.2% of the population in that area, compared to a town average of 6.3%). Constituted as a charity under UK law in 1982, the mosque offers worship facilities, as well as Islamic education, and has its own telecommunications mast for calls to prayer.

==Transport==
===Air===
Teesside International Airport is located east of Darlington town centre; it serves County Durham and North Yorkshire. The airport was known as &quot;Durham Tees Valley Airport&quot; from 2004 until mid-2019. It has flights to a few domestic locations across the UK and international flights to some locations in Europe. Many private or general aviation flights use the airport. The airport has a Fire Training Centre.

The nearest large airports are Newcastle () and Leeds Bradford ().

===Railway===

Darlington railway station is a principal stop on the East Coast Main Line; it is served by four train operating companies:
* London North Eastern Railway operates inter-city services to , , , , , and 
* TransPennine Express runs inter-city services between and Newcastle, via York, and 
* CrossCountry operates inter-city services between Edinburgh Waverley, and , via Leeds, , , and 
* Northern Trains runs local services on the Tees Valley Line, connecting all of the main settlements along the River Tees, including , , and . Services also stop at , the town&#x27;s original station.

Darlington railway station has a large Victorian clock tower, which can be seen from most areas of the town.

===Roads===
Darlington is well connected to the North East&#x27;s major trunk route, the A1(M), which bypasses the town to the west. It was completed in 1965, replacing the Great North Road route which is now known as the A167. The town is served by three closely-spaced junctions of the A1(M): junctions 57 (A66(M)), 58 (A68) and 59 (A167), which is also the access exit for Darlington motorway services (Newton Park), with an on-site filling station, hotel and restaurant. 

The town is also close to other major trunk routes, including the A66 trans-Pennine route connecting Darlington to Stockton-on-Tees and the A19.

The £5.9 million A66 Darlington eastern bypass opened on 25 November 1985. The Darlington Eastern Transport Corridor, linking the Central Park regeneration zone (Haughton Road) and Darlington town centre to a new roundabout on the A66, was opened in the summer of 2008.

===Buses===

Bus routes in the town are provided mostly by Arriva North East; its services connect Darlington to neighbouring towns and cities such as Durham, Bishop Auckland, Richmond, Stockton and Middlesbrough. There are also two smaller independent operators running services: Dales &amp; District and Hodgsons Buses.

Stagecoach North East operated originally in the town until 2007, when it sold its operations to Arriva. Stagecoach returned to Darlington in 2023, following the decision by Arriva to end its service 12 from Hurworth to Middleton St. George and Teesside Airport; it took over this service on 23 September 2023, renumbering it as route 6 (6A on Sundays) and extending it to Stockton, via Eaglescliffe, Yarm and Ingleby Barwick.

===Cycling===
Darlington was chosen by the Department for Transport as one of three national &quot;Sustainable Travel Demonstration Towns&quot; (together with Peterborough and Worcester) in 2004 and delivering a three-year research and marketing programme to promote sustainable travel choices under the brand name &quot;Local Motion&quot;. It was also chosen as one of six cycling demonstration towns in October 2005, receiving £3 million worth of funding from the government and local council money.

The 2007 &quot;Town Centre Pedestrian Heart Project&quot;, an investment of £10 million, saw some of Darlington&#x27;s town centre modernised; there was an emphasis on vehicles becoming less common in the centre and some roads pedestrianised completely. Other improvements were to cycling facilities and routes, linking the town to the national cycle route network. Darlington is the only place to win both sustainable travel and cycling demonstration town status.

=== Athletics ===

Darlington&#x27;s leading athletics club, Darlington Harriers AC, was formed in 1891 and has had a number of successful athletes wearing the club colours as well as competing internationally at Commonwealth, European and Olympic Games (London 1908, London 1948 and Tokyo 1964). The club stemmed from the Darlington Foot Harriers who travelled in packs hunting hares. Some of the key members, including Thomas and Charles Mountford, founded the club which went on to become one of the most notable clubs in the country. 

The club celebrated its 125th year in 2016, with anniversary games held at Eastbourne Sports Complex and was also the first club in the UK to be granted a licence via England Athletics new systems whilst the country was coming out of the COVID19 pandemic. 
In 2019, the club was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Award for Voluntary Services (QAVS), which was created in 2002 to celebrate Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Golden Jubilee. This was previously known as the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Award for Voluntary Service (QAVS)&quot;. Equivalent to an MBE, this award (changed to KAVS since King Charles III came to the throne) is the highest award given to local voluntary groups in the UK. The club was also winner of the 2021 and 2022 Regional England Athletics North East Volunteering &quot;Club of the Year&quot; awards. 

In 2015, the club also moved away from the &#x27;D&#x27; vest which had been introduced in the late 1970s, moving initially to &quot;Darlington Harriers&quot; before a new club logo was introduced in 2018. The new logo shape is the DL postcode area, includes the towns landmarks in Joseph Pease&#x27;s statue, the town clock and the brick train which represents the town&#x27;s history in the railway industry. 
The club has also introduced further events to its athletics calendar in recent years, adding to the existing &#x27;Pitstop&#x27; 10km race which has been running since 2001. Multi-lap events held at South Park include South Park 10 (mile), South Park 20 were introduced in 2016 and The Marathon Paarlauf in 2022. The athletics track where the club are based at Eastbourne Complex received a make over in 2023 as part of a £1.6 million re-design of the complex with a new Blue 8 lane track to match the club colours. 

The other athletics-based event is the Darlington 10km and 3km road run, which is held every August; it attracts around 2,000 competitors and is managed by the local council.

The Dolphin Centre, which provides a wide range of sporting facilities, was opened by Roger Bannister in 1982. It received a £5 million refurbishment in 2006 which was later officially opened by Redcar athlete Tanni Grey-Thompson.

<text>Antiphanes (Ancient Greek: Ἀντιφάνης; c. 408 to 334 BCE) was a playwright of Middle Comedy. According to Heinz-Günther Nesselrath, he is regarded as one of the most important writers of Middle Comedy alongside Alexis.

Antiphanes was said to have written as many as 365 comedies, and 140 titles of his works are known. His first play was produced about 385 BC. According to the Suda, he won 13 victories in dramatic competitions, including 8 at the Lenaea. In his later career he was a pioneer of the New Comedy. Demetrius of Phalerum and Dorotheus of Ascalon wrote treatises on Antiphanes.

According to the &quot;Suda&quot;, Antiphanes died after being struck by a pear.

His son, Stephanus, was also a comic writer.

<text>Menander (; ; c. 342/41 – c. 290 BC) was a Greek dramatist and the best-known representative of Athenian New Comedy. He wrote 108 comedies and took the prize at the Lenaia festival eight times. His record at the City Dionysia is unknown.

He was one of the most popular writers and most highly admired poets in antiquity, but his work was considered lost before the early Middle Ages. It now survives only in Latin-language adaptations by Terence and Plautus and, in the original Greek, in highly fragmentary form, most of which were discovered on papyrus in Egyptian tombs during the early to mid-20th-century. In the 1950s, to the great excitement of Classicists, it was announced that a single play by Menander, &quot;Dyskolos&quot;, had finally been rediscovered in the Bodmer Papyri intact enough to be performed.

==Life and work==

Menander was the son of well-to-do parents; his father Diopeithes is identified by some with the Athenian general and governor of the Thracian Chersonese known from the speech of Demosthenes &quot;De Chersoneso&quot;. He presumably derived his taste for comic drama from his uncle Alexis.

He was the friend, associate, and perhaps pupil of Theophrastus, and was on intimate terms with the Athenian dictator Demetrius of Phalerum. He also enjoyed the patronage of Ptolemy Soter, the son of Lagus, who invited him to his court. But Menander, preferring the independence of his villa in the Piraeus and the company of his mistress Glycera, refused. According to the note of a scholiast on the &quot;Ibis&quot; of Ovid, he drowned while bathing, and his countrymen honored him with a tomb on the road leading to Athens, where it was seen by Pausanias. Numerous supposed busts of him survive, including a well-known statue in the Vatican, formerly thought to represent Gaius Marius.

His rival in dramatic art (and supposedly in the affections of Glycera) was Philemon, who appears to have been more popular. Menander, however, believed himself to be the better dramatist, and, according to Aulus Gellius, used to ask Philemon: &quot;Don&#x27;t you feel ashamed whenever you gain a victory over me?&quot; According to Caecilius of Calacte (Porphyry in Eusebius, &quot;Praeparatio evangelica&quot;) Menander was accused of plagiarism, as his &quot;The Superstitious Man&quot; was taken from &quot;The Augur&quot; of Antiphanes, but reworkings and variations on a theme of this sort were commonplace and so the charge is a complicated one.

How long complete copies of his plays survived is unclear, although 23 of them, with commentary by Michael Psellus, were said to still have been available in Constantinople in the 11th century. He is praised by Plutarch (&quot;Comparison of Menander and Aristophanes&quot;) and Quintilian (&quot;Institutio Oratoria&quot;), who accepted the tradition that he was the author of the speeches published under the name of the Attic orator Charisius.
An admirer and imitator of Euripides, Menander resembles him in his keen observation of practical life, his analysis of the emotions, and his fondness for moral maxims, many of which became proverbial: &quot;The property of friends is common,&quot; &quot;Whom the gods love die young,&quot; &quot;Evil communications corrupt good manners&quot; (from the &quot;Thaïs&quot;, quoted in 1 Corinthians 15:33). These maxims (chiefly monostichs) were afterwards collected, and, with additions from other sources, were edited as &quot;Menander&#x27;s One-Verse Maxims&quot;, a kind of moral textbook for the use of schools.

The single surviving speech from his early play &quot;Drunkenness&quot; is an attack on the politician Callimedon, in the manner of Aristophanes, whose bawdy style was adopted in many of his plays.

Menander found many Roman imitators. &quot;Eunuchus&quot;, &quot;Andria&quot;, &quot;Heauton Timorumenos&quot; and &quot;Adelphi&quot; of Terence (called by Caesar &quot;dimidiatus Menander&quot;) were avowedly taken from Menander, but some of them appear to be adaptations and combinations of more than one play. Thus in the &quot;Andria&quot; were combined Menander&#x27;s &quot;The Woman from Andros&quot; and &quot;The Woman from Perinthos&quot;, in the &quot;Eunuchus&quot;, &quot;The Eunuch&quot; and &quot;The Flatterer&quot;, while the &quot;Adelphi&quot; was compiled partly from Menander and partly from Diphilus. The original of Terence&#x27;s &quot;Hecyra&quot; (as of the &quot;Phormio&quot;) is generally supposed to be, not by Menander, but Apollodorus of Carystus. The &quot;Bacchides&quot; and &quot;Stichus&quot; of Plautus were probably based upon Menander&#x27;s &quot;The Double Deceiver&quot; and &quot;Brotherly-Loving Men&quot;, but the &quot;Poenulus&quot; does not seem to be from &quot;The Carthaginian&quot;, nor the &quot;Mostellaria&quot; from &quot;The Apparition&quot;, in spite of the similarity of titles. Caecilius Statius, Luscius Lanuvinus, Turpilius and Atilius also imitated Menander. He was further credited with the authorship of some epigrams of doubtful authenticity; the letters addressed to Ptolemy Soter and the discourses in prose on various subjects mentioned by the &quot;Suda&quot; are probably spurious.

==Loss of his work==
Most of Menander&#x27;s work did not survive the Middle Ages, except as short fragments. Federico da Montefeltro&#x27;s library at Urbino reputedly had &quot;tutte le opere&quot;, a complete works, but its existence has been questioned and there are no traces after Cesare Borgia&#x27;s capture of the city and the transfer of the library to the Vatican.

Until the end of the 19th century, all that was known of Menander were fragments quoted by other authors and collected by Augustus Meineke (1855) and Theodor Kock, &quot;Comicorum Atticorum Fragmenta&quot; (1888). These consist of some 1650 verses or parts of verses, in addition to a considerable number of words quoted from Menander by ancient lexicographers.

==20th-century discoveries==

This situation changed abruptly in 1907, with the discovery of the Cairo Codex, which contained large parts of the &quot;Samia&quot;, the &quot;Perikeiromene&quot;, and the &quot;Epitrepontes&quot;; a section of the &quot;Heros&quot;; and another fragment from an unidentified play. A fragment of 115 lines of the &quot;Sikyonioi&quot; had been found in the papier mache of a mummy case in 1906.

In 1959, the Bodmer papyrus was published containing &quot;Dyskolos&quot;, more of the &quot;Samia&quot;, and half of the &quot;Aspis&quot;. In the late 1960s, more of the &quot;Sikyonioi&quot; was found as filling for two more mummy cases; this proved to be drawn from the same manuscript as the discovery in 1906, which had clearly been thoroughly recycled.

Other papyrus fragments continue to be discovered and published.

In 2003, a palimpsest manuscript, in Syriac writing of the 9th century, was found where the reused parchment comes from a very expensive 4th-century Greek manuscript of works by Menander. The surviving leaves contain parts of the &quot;Dyskolos&quot; and 200 lines of another piece by Menander, so far unpublished, titled &quot;Titthe&quot;.

==Famous quotations==
In his First Epistle to the Corinthians, Paul the Apostle quotes Menander in the text &quot;Bad company corrupts good character&quot;, which probably comes from his play &quot;Thais&quot;; according to 5th century Christian historian Socrates Scholasticus, Menander derived this from Euripides.

&quot;He who labors diligently need never despair, for all things are accomplished by diligence and labor.&quot; — Menander

&quot;Ἀνερρίφθω κύβος&quot; (&quot;anerriphtho kybos&quot;), best known in English as &quot;&quot; or &quot;the die has been cast&quot;, from the mis-translated Latin &quot;&quot;iacta alea est&quot; (itself better-known in the order &quot;Alea iacta est&quot;&quot;); a correct translation is &quot;let the die be cast&quot; (meaning &quot;let the game be ventured&quot;). The Greek form was famously quoted by Julius Caesar upon committing his army to civil war by crossing the River Rubicon. The popular form &quot;the die is cast&quot; is from the Latin , a mistranslation by Suetonius, 121 AD. According to Plutarch, the actual phrase used by Julius Caesar at the crossing of the Rubicon was a quote in Greek from Menander&#x27;s play &quot;Arrhephoros&quot;, with the different meaning &quot;Let the die be cast!&quot;. See discussion at &quot;&quot; and &quot;Alea iacta est&quot;.

&quot;Lewis and Short&quot;, citing Casaubon and Ruhnk, suggest that the text of Suetonius should read , which they translate as &quot;Let the die be cast!&quot;, or &quot;Let the game be ventured!&quot;. This matches Plutarch&#x27;s third-person perfect passive imperative (&quot;&quot;).

According to Gregory Hayes&#x27; Translation of &quot;Meditations&quot; by Marcus Aurelius, Menander is also known for the quote/proverb: &quot;a rich man owns so many goods he has no place to shit.&quot; (Meditations, V:12)

Another well known quote by Menander is &quot;Whom the gods love dies young&quot;.

==Comedies==
Menander&#x27;s comedies were very different from the Old Comedies of Aristophanes. New Greek Comedies usually would have two lovers, a blocking character, and a helpful servant. They typically ended with a wedding or happy ending. They were much more of a &quot;higher brow&quot; comedy than Old Greek comedy. They were also more realistic.

==Standard editions==
The standard edition of the least-well-preserved plays of Menander is Kassel-Austin, &quot;Poetarum Comicorum Graecorum vol. VI.2&quot;. For the better-preserved plays, the standard edition is now Arnott&#x27;s 3-volume Loeb. A complete text of these plays for the Oxford Classical Texts series was left unfinished by Colin Austin at the time of his death; the OCT edition of Harry Sandbach, published in 1972 and updated in 1990, remains in print.

<text>An axle or axletree is a central shaft for a rotating wheel or gear. On wheeled vehicles, the axle may be fixed to the wheels, rotating with them, or fixed to the vehicle, with the wheels rotating around the axle. In the former case, bearings or bushings are provided at the mounting points where the axle is supported. In the latter case, a bearing or bushing sits inside a central hole in the wheel to allow the wheel or gear to rotate around the axle. Sometimes, especially on bicycles, the latter type of axle is referred to as a &quot;spindle&quot;.

==Terminology==
On cars and trucks, several senses of the word &quot;axle&quot; occur in casual usage, referring to the shaft itself, its housing, or simply any transverse pair of wheels. Strictly speaking, a shaft that rotates with the wheel, being either bolted or splined in fixed relation to it, is called an &quot;axle&quot; or &quot;axle shaft&quot;. However, in looser usage, an entire assembly including the surrounding axle housing (typically a casting) is also called an &quot;axle&quot;.

An even broader (somewhat figurative) sense of the word refers to every pair of parallel wheels on opposite sides of a vehicle, regardless of their mechanical connection to each other and to the vehicle frame or body. Thus, transverse pairs of wheels in an independent suspension may be called an &quot;axle&quot; in some contexts. This very loose definition of &quot;axle&quot; is often used in assessing toll roads or vehicle taxes, and is taken as a rough proxy for the overall weight-bearing capacity of a vehicle, and its potential for causing wear or damage to roadway surfaces.

==Vehicle axles==
Axles are an integral component of most practical wheeled vehicles. In a solid, &quot;live-axle&quot; suspension system, the rotating inner axle cores (or half-shafts) serve to transmit driving torque to the wheels at each end, while the rigid outer tube maintains the position of the wheels at fixed angles relative to the axle, and controls the angle of the axle and wheels assembly to the vehicle body. The solid axles (housings) in this system must also bear the weight of the vehicle plus any cargo. A non-driving axle, such as the front beam axle in heavy-duty trucks and some two-wheel drive light trucks and vans, will have no shaft, and serves only as a suspension and steering component. Conversely, many front-wheel drive cars have a one-piece rear beam axle.

In other types of suspension systems, the axles serve only to transmit driving torque to the wheels: the position and angle of the wheel hubs is made independent from the axles by the function of the suspension system. This is typical of the independent suspensions found on most newer cars, and even SUVs, and on the front of many light trucks. An exception to this rule is the independent (rear) swing axle suspension, wherein the half-axles are also load-bearing suspension arms.

Independent drive-trains still need differentials (or diffs), but without fixed axle-housing tubes attached. The diff may be attached to the vehicle frame or body, and/or be integrated with the transmission (or gearbox) in a combined transaxle unit. The axle (half-)shafts then transmit driving torque to the wheels, usually via constant-velocity joints. Like a full floating axle system, the drive shafts in a front-wheel-drive independent suspension system do not support any vehicle weight.

==Structural features and design==

A straight axle is a single rigid shaft connecting a wheel on the left side of the vehicle to a wheel on the right side. The axis of rotation fixed by the axle is common to both wheels. Such a design can keep the wheel positions steady under heavy stress, and can therefore support heavy loads. Straight axles are used on trains (that is, locomotives and railway wagons), for the rear axles of commercial trucks, and on heavy-duty off-road vehicles. The axle can optionally be protected and further reinforced by enclosing the length of the axle in a housing.

In split-axle designs, the wheel on each side is attached to a separate shaft. Modern passenger cars have split-drive axles. In some designs, this allows independent suspension of the left and right wheels, and therefore a smoother ride. Even when the suspension is not independent, split axles permit the use of a differential, allowing the left and right drive wheels to be driven at different speeds as the automobile turns, improving traction and extending tire life.

A tandem axle is a group of two or more axles situated close together. Truck designs use such a configuration to provide a greater weight capacity than a single axle. Semi-trailers usually have a tandem axle at the rear.

Axles are typically made from SAE grade 41xx steel or SAE grade 10xx steel. SAE grade 41xx steel is commonly known as &quot;chrome-molybdenum steel&quot; (or &quot;chrome-moly&quot;) while SAE grade 10xx steel is known as &quot;carbon steel&quot;. The primary differences between the two are that chrome-moly steel is significantly more resistant to bending or breaking, and is very difficult to weld with tools normally found outside a professional welding shop.

==Drive axle==

An axle that is driven by the engine or prime mover is called a &quot;drive axle&quot;.

Modern front-wheel drive cars typically combine the transmission (gearbox and differential) and front axle into a single unit called a &quot;transaxle&quot;. The drive axle is a split axle with a differential and universal joints between the two half axles. Each half axle connects to the wheel by use of a constant velocity (CV) joint which allows the wheel assembly to move freely vertically as well as to pivot when making turns.

In rear-wheel drive cars and trucks, the engine turns a driveshaft (also called a &quot;propeller shaft&quot; or &quot;tailshaft&quot;) which transmits the rotational force to a drive axle at the rear of the vehicle. The drive axle may be a live axle, but modern rear-wheel drive automobiles generally use a split axle with a differential. In this case, one half-axle or half-shaft connects the differential with the left rear wheel, a second half-shaft does the same with the right rear wheel; thus the two half-axles and the differential constitute the rear axle. The front drive axle is providing the force to drive the truck. In fact, only one wheel of that axle is actually moving the truck and trailer down the road.

Some simple vehicle designs, such as leisure go-karts, may have a single driven wheel where the drive axle is a split axle with only one of the two shafts driven by the engine, or else have both wheels connected to one shaft without a differential (kart racing). However, other go-karts have two rear drive wheels too.
==Lift axle==

Some dump trucks and trailers may be configured with a lift axle (also known as an &quot;airlift axle&quot; or &quot;drop axle&quot;), which may be mechanically raised or lowered. The axle is lowered to increase the weight capacity, or to distribute the weight of the cargo over more wheels, for example, to cross a weight-restricted bridge. When not needed, the axle is lifted off the ground to save wear on the tires and axle, and to increase traction in the remaining wheels, and to decrease fuel consumption. Lifting an axle also alleviates lateral scrubbing of the additional axle in very tight turns, allowing the vehicle to turn more readily. In some situations, the removal of pressure from the additional axle is necessary for the vehicle to complete a turn at all.

Several manufacturers offer computer-controlled airlifts so that the dead axles are automatically lowered when the main axle reaches its weight limit. The dead axles can still be lifted by the press of a button if needed, for better maneuverability.

Lift axles were in use in the early 1940s. Initially, the axle was lifted by a mechanical device. Soon hydraulics replaced the mechanical lift system. One of the early manufacturers was Zetterbergs, located in Östervåla, Sweden. Their brand was Zeta-lyften.

The liftable tandem drive axle was invented in 1957 by the Finnish truck manufacturer Vanajan Autotehdas, a company sharing history with Sisu Auto.

==Full-floating vs semi-floating==
A full-floating axle carries the vehicle&#x27;s weight on the axle casing, not the half-shafts; they serve only to transmit torque from the differential to the wheels. They &quot;float&quot; inside an assembly that carries the vehicle&#x27;s weight. Thus the only stress it must endure is torque (not lateral bending force). Full-floating axle shafts are retained by a flange bolted to the hub, while the hub and bearings are retained on the spindle by a large nut.

In contrast, a semi-floating design carries the weight of the vehicle on the axle shaft itself; there is a single bearing at the end of the axle housing that carries the load from the axle and that the axle rotates through. To be &quot;semi-floating&quot; the axle shafts must be able to &quot;float&quot; in the housing, bearings and seals, and not subject to axial &quot;thrust&quot; and/or bearing preload. Needle bearings and separate lip seals are used in semi-floating axles with axle retained in the housing at their inner ends typically with circlips which are 3¾-round hardened washers that slide into grooves machined at the inner end of the shafts and retained in/by recesses in the differential carrier side gears which are themselves retained by the differential pinion gear (or &quot;spider gear&quot;) shaft. A true semi-floating axle assembly places no side loads on the axle housing tubes or axle shafts.

Axles that are pressed into ball or tapered roller bearings, which are in turn retained in the axle housings with flanges, bolts, and nuts do not &quot;float&quot; and place axial loads on the bearings, housings, and only a short section of the shaft itself, that also carries all radial loads.

The full-floating design is typically used in most ¾- and 1-ton light trucks, medium-duty trucks, and heavy-duty trucks. The overall assembly can carry more weight than a semi-floating or non-floating axle assembly because the hubs have two bearings riding on a fixed spindle. A full-floating axle can be identified by a protruding hub to which the axle shaft flange is bolted.

The semi-floating axle setup is commonly used on half-ton and lighter 4×4 trucks in the rear. This setup allows the axle shaft to be the means of propulsion, and also support the weight of the vehicle. The main difference between the full- and semi-floating axle setups is the number of bearings. The semi-floating axle features only one bearing, while the full-floating assembly has bearings on both the inside and outside of the wheel hub. The other difference is axle removal. To remove the semi-floating axle, the wheel must be removed first; if such an axle breaks, the wheel is most likely to come off the vehicle. The semi-floating design is found under most ½-ton and lighter trucks, as well as in SUVs and rear-wheel-drive passenger cars, usually being smaller or less expensive models.

A benefit of a full-floating axle is that even if an axle shaft (used to transmit torque or power) breaks, the wheel will not come off, preventing serious accidents.

<doc id="160574" wikidata="Q478470" url="?curid=160574" title="God Save the Tsar!">
<text>&quot;God Save the Tsar!&quot; () was the national anthem of the Russian Empire. The song was chosen from a competition held in 1833 and was first performed on 18 December 1833. It was composed by violinist Alexei Lvov, with lyrics written by the court poet Vasily Zhukovsky. It was the anthem until the February Revolution of 1917, after which &quot;Worker&#x27;s Marseillaise&quot; was adopted as the new national anthem until the overthrow of the Russian Provisional Government by the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution of the same year.

==Influence==
Many composers made use of the theme in their compositions, most notably Tchaikovsky, who quoted it in the 1812 Overture, the &quot;Marche Slave&quot;, his overture on the Danish national anthem, and the Festival Coronation March. During the Soviet era, authorities altered Tchaikovsky&#x27;s music (such as the 1812 Overture and &quot;Marche Slave&quot;), substituting other patriotic melodies, such as the &quot;Glory&quot; chorus from Mikhail Glinka&#x27;s opera &quot;A Life for the Tsar&quot;, for &quot;God Save the Tsar&quot;. Charles Gounod uses the theme in his Fantaisie sur l&#x27;Hymne National Russe (Fantasy on the Russian National Hymn). William Walton&#x27;s score for the 1970 film &quot;Three Sisters&quot;, based on Chekhov&#x27;s play, is dominated by the theme.

In 1842, English author Henry Chorley wrote &quot;God, the Omnipotent!&quot;, set to Lvov&#x27;s tune and published in 19th- and 20th-century hymnals as the &quot;Russian Hymn&quot;. The &quot;Russian Hymn&quot; tune continues to appear in various modern English language hymnals, such as those of the United Methodist Church, the Presbyterian Church, the &quot;Lutheran Book of Worship&quot; of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, or as &quot;Russia&quot; in &quot;The Hymnal 1982&quot; of the U.S. Episcopal Church.

The same melody is also used with different lyrics for various institutional songs: Doxology of Phi Gamma Delta, &quot;Noble Fraternity&quot; of Phi Kappa Psi, West Chester University Alma Mater, &quot;Hail, Pennsylvania!&quot; (alma mater of the University of Pennsylvania), &quot;Dear Old Macalester&quot; (alma mater of Macalester College), &quot;Hail, Delta Upsilon&quot; (Delta Upsilon fraternity), &quot;Firm Bound in Brotherhood&quot; (official song of the Order of the Arrow), the &quot;UST High School Hymn&quot; of the University of Santo Tomas High School in Manila, and the alma mater of Texas Woman&#x27;s University, Jesuit College Preparatory School of Dallas in Dallas, Texas, Westover School in Middlebury, Connecticut titled &quot;Raise Now to Westover&quot;, Tabor Academy in Marion, Massachusetts, Dimmitt High School in Dimmitt, Texas, Grant High School in Portland, Oregon, Jesuit High School in Tampa, Florida, Windber Area High School in Windber, Pennsylvania and the former St Peter&#x27;s High School in McKeesport, Pennsylvania.

Maurice Jarre&#x27;s score for the 1965 film &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; uses this melody in several tracks, most notably in the Overture. The anthem, played by the Band of the Welsh Guards, was used as the theme music for the epic BBC television adaptation of &quot;War and Peace&quot; in 1972. The Royal Scots Dragoon Guards continue to play &quot;God Save the Tsar!&quot; at formal events as a tribute to Nicholas II as the former colonel-in-chief of their predecessor, the Scots Greys.

In 1998, singer-songwriter Alexander Gradsky, one of the best-known rock artists during the Soviet period, proposed using the theme again as the Russian national anthem, but with substantially different lyrics from those originally written by Zhukovsky.

===Usage in Bulgaria===
The composition was used as the royal anthem of the Principality of Bulgaria, having been imposed by the temporary Russian government and the Russian army commanders. The usage of it in Bulgaria was relinquished after the Bulgarian Declaration of Independence in 1908.

<doc id="160575" wikidata="Q457840" url="?curid=160575" title="Will Rogers">
<text>William Penn Adair Rogers (November 4, 1879 – August 15, 1935) was an American vaudeville performer, actor, and humorous social commentator. He was born as a citizen of the Cherokee Nation, in the Indian Territory (now part of Oklahoma), and is known as &quot;Oklahoma&#x27;s Favorite Son&quot;. As an entertainer and humorist, he traveled around the world three times, made 71 films (50 silent films and 21 &quot;talkies&quot;), and wrote more than 4,000 nationally syndicated newspaper columns. By the mid-1930s, Rogers was hugely popular in the United States for his leading political wit and was the highest paid of Hollywood film stars. He died in 1935 with aviator Wiley Post when their small airplane crashed in northern Alaska.

Rogers began his career as a performer on vaudeville. His rope act led to success in the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot;, which in turn led to the first of his many movie contracts. His 1920s syndicated newspaper column and his radio appearances increased his visibility and popularity. Rogers crusaded for aviation expansion and provided Americans with first-hand accounts of his world travels. His earthy anecdotes and folksy style allowed him to poke fun at gangsters, prohibition, politicians, government programs, and a host of other controversial topics in a way that found general acclaim from a national audience with no one offended. His aphorisms, couched in humorous terms, were widely quoted, for example, &quot;I am not a member of an organized political party. I am a Democrat.&quot;

One of Rogers&#x27;s most famous sayings was &quot;I never met a man I didn&#x27;t like&quot; and he even provided an epigram on this famous epigram:
==Early years==

Rogers was born on his parents&#x27; Dog Iron Ranch in the Cherokee Nation of Indian Territory, near present-day Oologah, Oklahoma, now in Rogers County, named in honor of his father, Clement V. Rogers. The house in which he was born had been built in 1875 and was known as the &quot;White House on the Verdigris River&quot;. His parents, Clement V. (Clem) Rogers (1839–1911) and Mary America Schrimsher (1838–1890), were both mixed-race with Cherokee ancestry, and considered themselves Cherokee. Rogers quipped that his ancestors did not come over on the &quot;Mayflower&quot;, but they &quot;met the boat&quot;. His mother was one quarter-Cherokee and born into the Paint Clan. 

Unlike his father Clement&#x27;s people, Mary&#x27;s Cherokee relatives had been expelled from Georgia under the Indian Removal Act of 1830 in an exodus known as The Trail of Tears. Of the 16,000 Cherokees driven to Indian Territory (later Oklahoma), 4,000 perished &quot;en route&quot;. She died of amoebic dysentery when Will was 10 years of age. His father remarried almost three years after her death.

Rogers was the youngest of eight children. He was named for the Cherokee leader Colonel William Penn Adair. Only three of his siblings, sisters Sallie Clementine, Maude Ethel, and Mary (May), survived into adulthood.

His mother, Mary Schrimsher, was a sister of Martha Schrimsher Gulager, the paternal grandmother of Clu Gulager, making Rogers and Gulager first cousins, once removed.

His father, Clement, was a leader in the Cherokee Nation. An attorney and Cherokee judge, Clement owned two slaves he had acquired from his father, and was a Confederate combat veteran of the American Civil War. He was promoted to regimental captain under Confederate colonel (later Brigadier General) Stand Watie and fought at the Battle of Pea Ridge (1862).

Clement served as a delegate to the Oklahoma Constitutional Convention. Rogers County, Oklahoma, is named in honor of him. He served several terms in the Cherokee Senate.

Roach (1980) presents a sociological-psychological assessment of the relationship between Will and his father during the formative boyhood and teenage years. Clement had high expectations for his son and wanted him to be more responsible and business-minded. Will was more easygoing and oriented toward the loving affection offered by his mother, Mary, rather than the harshness of his father. The personality clash increased after his mother&#x27;s death when the boy was ten. Young Will went from one venture to another with little success. Only after Will won acclaim in vaudeville did the rift begin to heal. Clement&#x27;s death in 1911 precluded a full reconciliation.

Will Rogers attended school in Indian Territory, at the Willie Halsell College at Vinita in 1895 and 1896, and then the Kemper Military School at Boonville, Missouri, over the 1897–98 school year. He was a good student and an avid reader of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, but he dropped out of school after the 10th grade. Rogers later said that he was a poor student, saying that he &quot;studied the Fourth Reader for ten years&quot;. He was much more interested in cowboys and horses, and learned to rope and use a lariat.

===First jobs===
In 1899, Rogers appeared in the St. Louis Fair as part of the Mulhall Rodeo. Near the end of 1901, when he was 22 years old, he and a friend, Dick Parris, left home hoping to work as gauchos in Argentina. They arrived in Argentina in May 1902, and spent five months trying to make it as ranch owners in the Pampas. Rogers and his partner lost all their money, and he later said, &quot;I was ashamed to send home for more.&quot; The two friends separated and Rogers sailed for South Africa. It is often claimed he took a job breaking in horses for the British Army, but the Boer War had ended three months earlier. Rogers was hired at James Piccione&#x27;s ranch near Mooi River Station in the Pietermaritzburg district of Natal.

==Career==
Rogers began his show business career as a trick roper in &quot;Texas Jack&#x27;s Wild West Circus&quot; in South Africa:

Grateful for the guidance but anxious to move on, Rogers quit the circus and went to Australia. Texas Jack gave him a reference letter for the Wirth Brothers Circus there, and Rogers continued to perform as a rider and trick roper, and worked on his pony act. He returned to the United States in 1904, appeared at the Saint Louis World&#x27;s Fair, and began to try his roping skills on the vaudeville circuits.

===Vaudeville===

On a trip to New York City, Rogers was at Madison Square Garden, on April 27, 1905, when a wild steer broke out of the arena and began to climb into the viewing stands. Rogers roped the steer to the delight of the crowd. The feat got front page attention from the newspapers, giving him valuable publicity and an audience eager to see more. Willie Hammerstein saw his vaudeville act, and signed Rogers to appear on the Victoria Roof—which was literally on a rooftop—with his pony. For the next decade, Rogers estimated he worked for 50 weeks a year at the Roof and at the city&#x27;s myriad vaudeville theaters.

Rogers later recalled these early years:
:I got a job on Hammerstein&#x27;s Roof at $140 a week for myself, my horse, and the man who looked after it. I remained on the roof for eight weeks, always getting another two-week extension when Willie Hammerstein would say to me after the Monday matinee, &#x27;you&#x27;re good for two weeks more&#x27;... Marty Shea, the booking agent for the Columbia, came to me and asked if I wanted to play burlesque. They could use an extra attraction...I told him I would think about it, but &#x27;Burlesque&#x27; sounded to me then as something funny.&quot; Shea and Sam A. Scribner, the general manager of the Columbia Amusement Company, approached Rogers a few days later. Shea told Scribner Rogers was getting $150 and would take $175. &quot;&#x27;What&#x27;s he carrying?&#x27;, Scribner asked Shea. &#x27;Himself, a horse, and a man&#x27;, answered Shea.&quot; Scribner replied, &quot;&#x27;Give him eight weeks at $250&#x27;&quot;.

In the fall of 1915, Rogers began to appear in Florenz Ziegfeld&#x27;s &quot;Midnight Frolic&quot;. The variety revue began at midnight in the top-floor night club of Ziegfeld&#x27;s New Amsterdam Theatre, and drew many influential—and regular—customers. By this time, Rogers had refined his act. His monologues on the news of the day followed a similar routine every night. He appeared on stage in his cowboy outfit, nonchalantly twirling his lasso, and said, &quot;Well, what shall I talk about? I ain&#x27;t got anything funny to say. All I know is what I read in the papers.&quot; He would make jokes about what he had read in that day&#x27;s newspapers. The line &quot;All I know is what I read in the papers&quot; is often incorrectly described as Rogers&#x27;s most famous punch line, when it was his opening line.

His run at the New Amsterdam ran into 1916, and Rogers&#x27;s growing popularity led to an engagement on the more famous &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot;. At this stage, Rogers&#x27;s act was strictly physical, a silent display of daring riding and clever tricks with his lariat. He discovered that audiences identified the cowboy as the archetypical American—doubtless aided by Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s image as a cowboy. Rogers&#x27;s cowboy was an unfettered man free of institutional restraints, with no bureaucrats to order his life. When he came back to the United States and worked in Wild West shows, he slowly began adding the occasional spoken ad lib, such as &quot;Swingin&#x27; a rope&#x27;s all right... if your neck ain&#x27;t in it.&quot; Audiences responded to his laconic but pointed humor, and were just as fascinated by his frontier Oklahoma twang. By 1916, Rogers was a featured star in Ziegfeld&#x27;s Follies on Broadway, as he moved into satire by transforming the &quot;Ropin&#x27; Fool&quot; to the &quot;Talkin&#x27; Fool&quot;. At one performance, with President Woodrow Wilson in the audience, Rogers improvised a &quot;roast&quot; of presidential policies that had Wilson, and the entire audience, in stitches and proved his remarkable skill at off-the-cuff, witty commentary on current events. He built the rest of his career around that skill.

A 1922 editorial in &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that &quot;Will Rogers in the Follies is carrying on the tradition of Aristophanes, and not unworthily.&quot; Rogers branched into silent films too, for Samuel Goldwyn&#x27;s company Goldwyn Pictures. He made his first silent movie, &quot;Laughing Bill Hyde&quot; (1918), which was filmed in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Many early films were filmed and produced in the New York area in those years. Rogers could make a film, yet easily still rehearse and perform in the &quot;Follies&quot;. He eventually appeared in most of the &quot;Follies&quot;, from 1916 to 1925.

===Films===
Hollywood discovered Rogers in 1918, as Samuel Goldwyn gave him the title role in &quot;Laughing Bill Hyde&quot;.

A three-year contract with Goldwyn, at triple the Broadway salary, moved Rogers west. He bought a ranch in the Pacific Palisades and set up his own production company. While Rogers enjoyed film acting, his appearances in silent movies suffered from the obvious restrictions of silence, as he had gained his fame as a commentator on stage. He wrote many of the title cards appearing in his films. In 1923, he began a one-year stint for Hal Roach and made 12 pictures. Among the films he made for Roach in 1924 were three directed by Rob Wagner: &quot;Two Wagons Both Covered&quot;, &quot;Going to Congress&quot;, and &quot;Our Congressman&quot;. He made two other feature silents and a travelogue series in 1927. After that, he did not return to the screen until beginning work in the &#x27;talkies&#x27; in 1929.

Rogers made 48 silent movies, but with the arrival of sound in 1929, he became a top star in that medium. His first sound film, &quot;They Had to See Paris&quot; (1929), gave him the chance to exercise his verbal wit.

He played a homespun farmer (&quot;State Fair)&quot; in 1933, an old-fashioned doctor (&quot;Dr. Bull&quot;) in 1933, a small town banker (&quot;David Harum&quot;) in 1934, and a rustic politician (&quot;Judge Priest&quot;) in 1934. He was also in &quot;County Chairman&quot; (1935), &quot;Steamboat Round the Bend&quot; (1935), and &quot;In Old Kentucky&quot; (1935). His favorite director was John Ford.

Rogers appeared in 21 feature films alongside such noted performers as Lew Ayres, Billie Burke, Jane Darwell, Andy Devine, Janet Gaynor, Boris Karloff, Myrna Loy, Joel McCrea, Hattie McDaniel, Ray Milland, Maureen O&#x27;Sullivan, ZaSu Pitts, Dick Powell, Bill &quot;Bojangles&quot; Robinson, and Mickey Rooney. He was directed three times by John Ford. He appeared in four films with his friend Stepin Fetchit (aka Lincoln T. Perry): &quot;David Harum&quot; (1934), &quot;Judge Priest&quot; (1934), &quot;Steamboat Round the Bend&quot; (1935) and &quot;The County Chairman&quot; (1935).

With his voice becoming increasingly familiar to audiences, Rogers essentially played himself in each film, without film makeup, managing to ad-lib and sometimes work in his familiar commentaries on politics. The clean moral tone of his films resulted in various public schools taking their classes to attend special showings during the school day. His most unusual role may have been in the first talking version of Mark Twain&#x27;s novel &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot;. His popularity soared to new heights with films including &quot;Young As You Feel&quot;, &quot;Judge Priest&quot;, and &quot;Life Begins at 40&quot;, with Richard Cromwell and Rochelle Hudson.
===Newspapers and magazines===
Rogers was an indefatigable worker. He toured the lecture circuit. &quot;The New York Times&quot; syndicated his weekly newspaper column from 1922 to 1935. Going daily in 1926, his short column &quot;Will Rogers Says&quot; reached 40 million newspaper readers. He also wrote frequently for the mass-circulation upscale magazine &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;. Rogers advised Americans to embrace the frontier values of neighborliness and democracy on the domestic front, while remaining clear of foreign entanglements. He took a strong, highly popular stand in favor of aviation, including a military air force of the sort his flying buddy General Billy Mitchell advocated.

Rogers began a weekly column, titled &quot;Slipping the Lariat Over&quot;, at the end of 1922. He had already published a book of wisecracks and had begun a steady stream of humor books. Through the columns for the McNaught Syndicate between 1922 and 1935, as well as his personal appearances and radio broadcasts, he won the loving admiration of the American people, poking jibes in witty ways at the issues of the day and prominent people—often politicians. He wrote from a nonpartisan point of view and became a friend of presidents and a confidant of the great. Loved for his cool mind and warm heart, he was often considered the successor to such greats as Artemus Ward and Mark Twain. Rogers was not the first entertainer to use political humor before his audience. Others, such as Broadway comedian Raymond Hitchcock and Britain&#x27;s Sir Harry Lauder, preceded him by several years. Bob Hope is the best known political humorist to follow Rogers&#x27;s example.

===Radio===
Radio was the exciting new medium, and Rogers became a star there as well, broadcasting his newspaper pieces. From 1929 to 1935, he made radio broadcasts for the Gulf Oil Company. This weekly Sunday evening show, &quot;The Gulf Headliners&quot;, ranked among the top radio programs in the country. Since Rogers easily rambled from one subject to another, reacting to his studio audience, he often lost track of the half-hour time limit in his earliest broadcasts, and was cut off in mid-sentence. To correct this, he brought in a wind-up alarm clock, and its on-air buzzing alerted him to begin wrapping up his comments. By 1935, his show was being announced as &quot;Will Rogers and his Famous Alarm Clock&quot;.

==Personal life==

In 1908, Rogers married Betty Blake (1879–1944), and the couple had four children: Will Rogers Jr., Mary Amelia, James Blake, and Fred Stone. Will Jr. became a World War II hero, played his father in two films, and was elected to Congress. Mary became a Broadway actress, and James &quot;Jim&quot; was a newspaperman and rancher; Fred died of diphtheria at age two. The family lived in New York, but they spent summers in Oklahoma. In 1911, Rogers bought a ranch near Claremore, Oklahoma, which he intended to use as his retirement home. He paid US$500 an acre, equal to $ per acre today.

From about 1925 to 1928, Rogers traveled the length and breadth of the United States in a &quot;lecture tour&quot;. (He began his lectures by pointing out that &quot;A humorist entertains, and a lecturer annoys.&quot;) During this time he became the first civilian to fly from coast to coast with pilots flying the mail in early air mail flights. The National Press Club dubbed him &quot;Ambassador at Large of the United States&quot;. He visited Mexico City, along with Charles Lindbergh, as a guest of U.S. Ambassador Dwight Morrow. Rogers gave numerous after-dinner speeches, became a popular convention speaker, and gave dozens of benefits for victims of floods, droughts, or earthquakes.

Rogers traveled to Asia to perform in 1931, and to Central and South America the following year. In 1934, he made a globe-girdling tour and returned to play the lead in Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s stage play &quot;Ah, Wilderness!&quot;. He had tentatively agreed to go on loan from Fox to MGM to star in the 1935 movie version of the play. But, concerned about a fan&#x27;s reaction to the &quot;facts-of-life&quot; talk between his character and the latter&#x27;s son, he declined the role. He and Wiley Post made plans to fly to Alaska that summer.

==Politics==
Rogers was a lifelong Democrat but has historically been known as apolitical. He was friends with every president starting with Theodore Roosevelt, and he notably supported Republican Calvin Coolidge over John W. Davis in 1924. During the Republican Convention of 1928, while criticizing the party platform, Rogers welcomed the nomination of Kaw citizen Charles Curtis as vice president, although he felt the leadership had deliberately kept him from the presidency: &quot;The Republican Party owed him something, but I didn&#x27;t think they would be so low down as to pay him &quot;that&quot; way.&quot; Four years later, when the Republican leadership attempted to remove the more conservative Curtis from the Hoover ticket, Rogers defended him, and took credit for keeping him on the ticket: &quot;I saved my &#x27;Injun&#x27; Charley Curtis for vice presidency. The rascals was just ready to stab him when we caught &#x27;em.&quot;

In 1932, Rogers supported Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was his favorite president and politician. Although he supported Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal, he could just as easily joke about it: &quot;Lord, the money we do spend on Government and it&#x27;s not one bit better than the government we got for one-third the money twenty years ago.&quot;

Rogers served as a goodwill ambassador to Mexico, and had a brief stint as mayor of Beverly Hills, a largely ceremonial position that allowed Rogers to joke about do-nothing politicians such as himself. During the depths of the Great Depression, angered by Washington&#x27;s inability to feed the people, he embarked on a cross-country fundraising tour for the Red Cross.

=== 1928 presidential campaign ===
Rogers thought all campaigning was &quot;bunk.&quot; To prove the point, he mounted a mock campaign in 1928 for the presidency. His only vehicle was &quot;Life&quot;, which was then a weekly humor magazine. The campaign was in large part an effort to boost circulation for the struggling periodical. Rogers ran as the &quot;bunkless candidate&quot; of the Anti-Bunk Party. His campaign promise was that, if elected, he would resign. Every week, from Memorial Day through Election Day, Rogers caricatured campaign politics. On Election Day he declared victory and resigned (he did not actually receive any state electoral votes).

==Philosophy and style==
After Rogers gained recognition as a humorist-philosopher in vaudeville, he gained a national audience in acting and literary careers from 1915 to 1935. In these years, Rogers increasingly expressed the views of the &quot;common man&quot; in America. He downplayed academic credentials, noting, &quot;Everybody is ignorant, only on different subjects.&quot; Americans of all walks admired his individualism, his appreciation for democratic ideas, and his liberal philosophies on most issues. Moreover, Rogers extolled hard work in order to succeed, and such expressions affirmed American theories about how to realize individual success. Rogers symbolized the self-made man, the common man, who believed in America, in progress, and in the American Dream of upward mobility. His humor never offended even those who were the targets of it.

In the 1920s, the United States was happy and prosperous in various ways (leading to the nickname &quot;Roaring Twenties&quot;), but it also suffered from rapid change and social tensions. Some people were disenchanted by, and alienated from, the outside world. Many common people believed that World War I had resulted in extensive and largely senseless carnage, and they supported isolationism for the US. According to scholar Peter Rollins (1976), Rogers appeared to be an anchor of stability; his conventional home life and traditional moral code reminded people of a recent past. His newspaper column, which ran from 1922 to 1935, expressed his traditional morality and his belief that political problems were not as serious as they sounded. In his films, Rogers began by playing a simple cowboy; his characters evolved to explore the meaning of innocence in ordinary life. In his last movies, Rogers explores a society fracturing into competing classes from economic pressures. Throughout his career, Rogers was a link to a better, more comprehensible past.

In 1926, the high-circulation weekly magazine &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; financed a European tour for Rogers, in return for publication of his articles. Rogers made whirlwind visits to numerous European capitals and met with both international figures and common people. His articles reflected a fear that Europeans would go to war again. He recommended isolationism for the United States. He reasoned that for the moment, American needs could best be served by concentrating on domestic questions and avoiding foreign entanglements. He commented:
:America has a unique record. We never lost a war and we never won a conference in our lives. I believe that we could without any degree of egotism, single-handed lick any nation in the world. But we can&#x27;t confer with Costa Rica and come home with our shirts on.
Rogers was famous for his use of language. He effectively used up-to-date slang and invented new words to fit his needs. He also made frequent use of puns and terms which closely linked him to the cowboy tradition, as well as speech patterns using a southern dialect.

Brown (1979) argues that Rogers held up a &quot;magic mirror&quot; that reflected iconic American values. Rogers was the archetypical &quot;American Democrat&quot; thanks to his knack of moving freely among all social classes, his stance above political parties, and his passion for fair play. He represented the &quot;American Adam&quot; with his independence and self-made record. Rogers furthermore represented the &quot;American Prometheus&quot; through his commitment to utilitarian methods and his ever-optimistic faith in future progress.

==Aviation and death==
Will Rogers became an advocate for the aviation industry after noticing advancements in Europe and befriending Charles Lindbergh, the most famous American aviator of the era. During his 1926 European trip, Rogers witnessed the European advances in commercial air service and compared them to the almost nonexistent facilities in the United States. Rogers&#x27; newspaper columns frequently emphasized the safety record, speed, and convenience of this means of transportation, and he helped shape public opinion on the subject.

In 1935, the famed aviator Wiley Post, an Oklahoman, became interested in surveying a mail-and-passenger air route from the West Coast to Russia. He attached a Lockheed Explorer wing to a Lockheed Orion fuselage, fitting floats for landing in the lakes of Alaska and Siberia. Rogers visited Post often at the airport in Burbank, California, while he was modifying the aircraft. He asked Post to fly him through Alaska in search of new material for his newspaper column.

After making a test flight in July, Post and Rogers left Lake Washington in Renton, Washington in the Lockheed Orion-Explorer in early August and then made several stops in Alaska. While Post piloted the aircraft, Rogers wrote his columns on his typewriter. Before they left Fairbanks, they signed and mailed a burgee, a distinguishing flag belonging to the South Coast Corinthian Yacht Club. The signed burgee is on display at South Coast Corinthian Yacht Club in Marina del Rey, California. On August 15, they left Fairbanks for Point Barrow.

About 20 miles southwest of Point Barrow, having difficulty figuring their position due to bad weather, they landed in a lagoon to ask directions. On takeoff, the engine failed at low altitude, and the aircraft plunged into the lagoon, shearing off the right wing, and ended up inverted in the shallow water of the lagoon. Both men died instantly. Rogers was buried August 21, 1935, in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California; it was a temporary interment. He was re-interred at the Will Rogers Memorial in Claremore, Oklahoma in 1944.

Experts have studied the accident and still disagree about its cause. Bobby H. Johnson and R. Stanley Mohler argued in a 1971 article that Post had ordered floats that did not reach Seattle in time for the planned trip. He used a set that was designed for a larger type of plane, making the already nose-heavy hybrid aircraft even more nose-heavy. But Bryan and Frances Sterling maintain in their 2001 book &quot;Forgotten Eagle: Wiley Post: America&#x27;s Heroic Aviation Pioneer&quot; that their research showed the floats were the correct type for the aircraft, thereby suggesting another cause for the crash.

==Legacy==

In 1962, the town of Higgins, Texas (near a ranch where Rogers had worked in 1922), began an annual observance of Will Rogers Day, in honor of the cowboy philosopher, who remained a close friend of Frank Ewing, the son of his old employer.

Rogers was posthumously inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio.

The Tulsa World newspaper includes a quote from Rogers daily in its &quot;Will Rogers Says&quot; column.

===Oklahoma honors===
Before his death, the state of Oklahoma commissioned a statue of Rogers, to be displayed as one of the two it has in the National Statuary Hall Collection of the United States Capitol. Rogers agreed on the condition that his image would be placed facing the House Chamber, supposedly so he could &quot;keep an eye on Congress&quot;. Of the statues in this part of the Capitol, the Rogers sculpture is the only one facing the Chamber entrance—a stakeout location for camera crews looking to catch House members during and after voting. It is also a common background for reporters and lawmakers, with staff often directing the media to be at the &quot;Will Rogers stakeout&quot; at a certain time. According to some Capitol guides, each U.S. president rubs the left shoe of the Rogers statue for good luck before entering the House Chamber to give the State of the Union address.

A state appropriation paid for the work. It was sculpted in clay by Jo Davidson. He had been a close friend of Rogers. Davidson had the work cast in bronze in Brussels, Belgium. It was dedicated on June 6, 1939, before a crowd of more than 2,000 people. The Architect of the Capitol, David Lynn, said there had never been such a large ceremony or crowd in the Capitol.

His birthplace at the Dog Iron Ranch is located two miles east of Oologah, Oklahoma. When the Verdigris River valley was flooded to create Oologah Lake as part of a major dam project, the Rogers house was preserved by moving it about to its present location overlooking the original site.

The family tomb is at the Will Rogers Memorial Museum, constructed in nearby Claremore on the site purchased by Rogers in 1911 for his retirement home. On May 19, 1944, Rogers&#x27;s body was moved from a holding vault in Glendale, California, to the tomb. After his wife Betty died later that year, she was also interred there. A casting of the Davidson sculpture that stands in National Statuary Hall, paid for by Davidson, was installed at the museum. Both the birthplace and the museum are open to the public.

Many landmarks were named in Rogers&#x27; honor: Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City, where a recent expansion and renovation included the installation of a statue of Rogers on horseback in front of the terminal. The Will Rogers Turnpike is the section of Interstate 44 between Tulsa and Joplin, Missouri. Near Vinita, Oklahoma, a statue of Rogers was installed at the service plaza that spans the interstate.

Thirteen public schools in Oklahoma have been named for Rogers, including Will Rogers High School in Tulsa. The University of Oklahoma named the large Will Rogers Room in the student union for him. The Boy Scouts of America honored him with the Will Rogers Council and the Will Rogers Scout Reservation near Cleveland.

In 1947, a college football bowl game was named in his honor, but the event folded after the first year.

The Academy of Western Artists, based in Gene Autry, Oklahoma, presents an annual Will Rogers Medallion award for excellence in western literature.

===Colorado memorial===
The Will Rogers Shrine of the Sun is an 80-foot observation tower on Cheyenne Mountain west of Colorado Springs, at the base of Pikes Peak near the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo.

===California memorials===
Rogers&#x27;s California home, stables, and polo fields were preserved from 1944 to 2025 for public enjoyment as Will Rogers State Historic Park in Pacific Palisades. His widow, Betty, willed the property to the state of California upon her death in 1944, under the condition that polo be played on the field every year; it is home to the Will Rogers Polo Club. The house and stables burnt down during the Palisades Fire on January 8, 2025.

Several schools have been named for him: Will Rogers Elementary School in Santa Monica, Will Rogers Elementary School in Ventura, middle schools in Long Beach and in Fair Oaks.

Will Rogers Memorial Park, a small park at Sunset Boulevard and Beverly Drive in Beverly Hills, was named after him, as is Will Rogers State Beach in Pacific Palisades.

U.S. Route 66 is known as the Will Rogers Highway; a plaque dedicating the highway to the humorist is located at the western terminus of Route 66 in Santa Monica.

The California Theatre in San Bernardino is the site of the humorist&#x27;s final show. He always performed in front of a special jewelled curtain and had two of them. While he was using one, he would send the other to the site of his next performance. The curtain used in his final show was retained by the California Theatre. Two memorial murals by Kent Twitchell were installed on the exterior of the fly loft. The California Theatre named one of its reception spaces the Will Rogers Room.

===Texas memorials===
The Will Rogers Memorial Center was built in Fort Worth, Texas, in 1936. It includes:
* Will Rogers Coliseum (5,652 seats)
* Will Rogers Auditorium (2,856 seats)
* Will Rogers Equestrian Center
as well as other buildings. It also includes a mural, a bust and a life-size statue of Will Rogers on Soapsuds, titled &quot;Riding into the Sunset&quot;, sculpted by Electra Waggoner Biggs.

A casting of &quot;Riding into the Sunset&quot; stands at the entrance to the main campus quad at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas. This memorial was dedicated on February 16, 1950, by Rogers&#x27; longtime friend, Amon G. Carter. Another casting is held at the Will Rogers Memorial in Claremore, and a casting is located at the entrance of the Hilton Anatole in Dallas.

===Washington State and Alaska memorials===
Before heading up to Alaska, Rogers played polo at a field in Seattle. This was his &quot;last ride&quot; on a horse, so a monument was erected next to the field in 1938. A small monument at the Renton airport commemorates the starting point of the fatal 1935 Post-Rogers flight. A memorial is also located within the city of Utqiagvik (formerly Barrow), Alaska.

===National tributes===
In 1936, the NVA Hospital located in Saranac Lake, New York was renamed as the Will Rogers Memorial Hospital by the National Vaudeville Artists association.

On November 4, 1948, the United States Post Office commemorated Rogers with a three-cent postage stamp. In 1979, it issued a United States Postal Service 15-cent stamp of him as part of the &quot;Performing Arts&quot; series.

In 1976, Rogers was among the historical figures depicted in the artwork &quot;Our Nation&#x27;s 200th Birthday, The Telephone&#x27;s 100th Birthday&quot; by Stanley Meltzoff for Bell System.

The airport for Utqiagvik (formerly Barrow), Alaska (BRW), located about from the location of the fatal airplane crash, is known as the Wiley Post–Will Rogers Memorial Airport.

The Rogers-Post Site, overlooking the lagoon where the plane crashed, has two (or possibly one remaining) monuments. It is on the National Register of Historic Places. A plaque to Rogers and Post was also erected in Barrow.

The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honor.

The final ship of the s, , was launched in 1966, and commissioned the following year.

On November 4, 2019, Google celebrated his 140th birthday with a Google Doodle.

==Film and stage portrayals==
Rogers was portrayed by A.A. Trimble in cameos in both the 1936 film &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot;, and the 1937 film &quot;You&#x27;re a Sweetheart&quot;.

Rogers was portrayed by his son, Will Rogers Jr., in a cameo in the 1949 film &quot;Look for the Silver Lining&quot;, as the star of the 1952 film &quot;The Story of Will Rogers&quot;, and as a voice-only cameo in The American Adventure at Epcot.

James Whitmore portrayed Rogers in eight runs of the one-man play &quot;Will Rogers&#x27; USA&quot; between 1970 and 2000, including a limited run on Broadway in 1974, and as a television film in 1972. Whitmore changed the monologue each time he performed it, using quotations from Rogers as commentary on events current at the time of the performance.

The Tony Award-winning musical &quot;The Will Rogers Follies&quot;, produced on Broadway in 1991, starred Keith Carradine in the lead role. Carradine also played Rogers in the 1994 film &quot;Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle&quot;.

<doc id="160576" wikidata="Q1236122" url="?curid=160576" title="Diphilus">
<text>Diphilus (Greek: Δίφιλος), of Sinope, was a poet of the new Attic comedy and a contemporary of Menander (342–291 BC). He is frequently listed together with Menander and Philemon, considered the three greatest poets of New Comedy. He was victorious at least three times at the Lenaia, placing him third before Philemon and Menander. Although most of his plays were written and acted at Athens he died at Smyrna. His body was returned and buried in Athens.

According to Athenaeus, he was on intimate terms with the famous courtesan Gnathaena. Athenaeus quotes the comic poet Machon in support of this claim. Machon is also the source for the claim that Diphilus acted in his own plays.

An anonymous essay on comedy from antiquity reports that Diphilus wrote 100 plays. Of these 100 plays, 59 titles, and 137 fragments (or quotations) survive. From the extant fragments, Diphilus&#x27; plays seem to have featured many of the stock characters now primarily associated with the comedies of the Roman playwright Plautus, who translated and adapted a number of Diphilus&#x27; plays. Swaggering soldiers, verbose cooks, courtesans, and parasites, all feature in the fragments. In contrast to his more successful contemporaries, Menander and Philemon, Diphilus seems to have had a preference for the mythological subjects so popular in Middle Comedy.

To judge from the imitations of Plautus (&quot;Casina&quot; from the Κληρούμενοι, &quot;Asinaria&quot; from the Ὀναγός, &quot;Rudens&quot; from some other play), he was very skillful in the construction of his plots. Terence also tells us that he introduced into the &quot;Adelphi&quot; (ii. I) a scene from the Συναποθνήσκοντες, which had been omitted by Plautus in his adaptation (&quot;Commorientes&quot;) of the same play.

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition:

<doc id="160578" wikidata="Q386105" url="?curid=160578" title="Andy Devine">
<text>Andrew Vabre Devine (October 7, 1905 – February 18, 1977) was an American character actor known for his distinctive raspy, crackly voice and roles in Western films, including his role as Cookie, the sidekick of Roy Rogers in 10 feature films. He also appeared alongside John Wayne in films such as &quot;Stagecoach&quot; (1939), &quot;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance&quot;, and &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; (both 1962). He is also remembered as Jingles on the TV series &quot;The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok&quot; from 1951 to 1958, as Danny McGuire in &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (1937), and as the voice of Friar Tuck in the Disney Animation Studio film &quot;Robin Hood&quot; (1973).

==Early life==
Devine attended St. Mary’s and St. Benedict&#x27;s College, Northern Arizona State Teacher&#x27;s College, and was a football player at Santa Clara University. He also played semiprofessional football under the pseudonym Jeremiah Schwartz. His football experience led to his first sizable film role in &quot;The Spirit of Notre Dame&quot; in 1931.

==Career==

Devine had an ambition to act, so after college, he went to Hollywood, where he worked as a lifeguard at Venice Beach. 

His peculiar wheezy voice was first thought likely to prevent him from moving to the talkies, but instead, it became his trademark. Devine claimed that his distinctive voice resulted from a childhood accident in which he fell while running with a curtain rod in his mouth at the Beale Hotel in Kingman, causing the rod to pierce the roof of his mouth. When he was able to speak again, he had a labored, scratchy, duo-tone voice. A biographer, however, indicated that this was one of several stories Devine fabricated about his voice. His son Tad related in an interview for Encore Westerns Channel (Jim Beaver, reporting from the 2007 Newport Beach Film Festival) that there indeed had been an accident, but he was uncertain if it caused his father&#x27;s unusual voice. When asked if he had strange nodes on his vocal cords, Devine replied, &quot;I&#x27;ve got the same nodes as Bing Crosby, but his are in tune.&quot; 
Devine appeared in more than 400 films and shared with Walter Brennan, another character actor, the rare ability to move with ease from B-movie Westerns to mainstream feature films. His notable roles included Cookie, Roy Rogers&#x27;s sidekick, in 10 films; a role in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1936), and Danny in &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (1937). He appeared in several films with John Wayne, including &quot;Stagecoach&quot; (1939), &quot;Island in the Sky&quot; (1953), and &quot;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance&quot; (1962).

He was a long-time contract player with Universal, which in 1939 paired him with Richard Arlen for a series of fast-paced B-pictures (usually loaded with stock footage) that mixed action and comedy; they made 14 over a two-year period. When Arlen left in 1941, the series continued for another two years, teaming Devine with various actors, often Leo Carrillo.

Most of Devine&#x27;s characters were reluctant to get involved in the action, but he played the hero in &quot;Island in the Sky&quot; (1953), as an expert pilot who leads other aviators on an arduous search for a missing airplane. Devine was generally known for his comic roles, but Jack Webb cast him as a police detective in &quot;Pete Kelly&#x27;s Blues&quot; (1955), for which Devine lowered his voice and was more serious than usual.

His film appearances in his later years included roles in &quot;Zebra in the Kitchen&quot; (1965), &quot;The Over-the-Hill Gang&quot; (1969), and &quot;Myra Breckinridge&quot; (1970).

Devine worked extensively in radio, and is well remembered for his role as Jingles, Guy Madison&#x27;s sidekick in &quot;The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok&quot;, which the two actors reprised on television. Devine appeared over 75 times on Jack Benny&#x27;s radio show between 1936 and 1942, often in Benny&#x27;s semiregular series of Western sketches, &quot;Buck Benny Rides Again&quot;. Benny frequently referred to him as &quot;the mayor of Van Nuys&quot;. In fact, Devine served as honorary mayor of that city, where he lived, preferring to be away from the bustle of Hollywood, from May 18, 1938, to 1957, when he moved to Newport Beach.

Devine also worked in television. He hosted &quot;Andy&#x27;s Gang&quot;, a children&#x27;s TV show, on NBC from 1955 to 1960. During this time, he also made multiple appearances on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford&quot;. In addition, he was a guest star on many television shows in the 1950s and 1960s, including an episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; titled &quot;Hocus-Pocus and Frisby&quot;, playing the part of Frisby, a teller of tall tales who impresses a group of gullible alien kidnappers. He played Hap Gorman, a character likewise given to tall tales, in five episodes of the NBC TV series &quot;Flipper&quot;, during its 1964 season. He played the role of Jake Sloan in the 1961 episode &quot;Big Jake&quot; of the acclaimed anthology series &quot;The Barbara Stanwyck Show&quot;, also on NBC. He also played Honest John Denton in the episode &quot;A Horse of a Different Cutter&quot; of the short-lived series &quot;The Rounders&quot;.

He made a cameo appearance as Santa Claus in an episode of the 1960s live-action &quot;Batman&quot; TV series on ABC. The episode, entitled &quot;The Duo Is Slumming&quot;, was originally broadcast on December 22, 1966. In this role, he directly addressed the viewers, wishing them a merry Christmas.

Devine made his stage debut in 1957 with his portrayal of Cap&#x27;n Andy in Guy Lombardo&#x27;s production of &quot;Show Boat&quot; at the Jones Beach Theatre in Wantagh, New York. In 1973, he went to Monroe, Louisiana, at the request of George C. Brian, an actor and filmmaker who headed the theater department at the University of Louisiana at Monroe, to perform in &quot;Show Boat&quot;.

He also performed voice parts in animated films, including Friar Tuck in Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Robin Hood&quot;. He provided the voice of Cornelius the Rooster in several TV commercials for Kellogg&#x27;s Corn Flakes.

Devine was a pilot and owned Provo Devine, a flying school that trained flyers for the government during World War II.

==Political views==
Devine was a Republican. Devine supported Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election.

==Death==
Devine died of leukemia at age 71 in Irvine, California, on February 18, 1977.

<text>Caecilius of Calacte was a rhetorician and literary critic active in Rome during the reign of Augustus.

The main source of information about Caecilius&#x27; life is the Suda, which says that he was from Sicily, originally called Archagathus, possibly of slave origins, and Jewish. He was born about 50 BC in Calacte, and was probably a student of Apollodorus of Pergamon. Both the Suda and Hermagoras say that he taught in Rome during the reign of Augustus. The Suda reports that he lived until the reign of Hadrian, more than a century after the death of Augustus; this is possibly due to confusion with the quaestor Quintus Caecilius Niger. A mention of Caecilius by Dionysius of Halicarnassus, who describes him as a friend in his &quot;Epistle to Pompey&quot;, may have been written as early as 30 BC and suggests that he may already have been an established critic by then.

He apparently wrote works of both history and literary criticism, but only a few fragments of his writings are extant. Athenaeus, the main source of information about Caecilius&#x27; historical works, reports that he wrote a history of the Servile Wars (slave revolts) in Sicily, and refers to a work in which Caecilius mentioned the Sicilian tyrant Agathocles. He also apparently wrote about the literary merits of historians, praising Thucydides but criticising Timaeus and Theopompus.

In his literary criticism, Caecilius was one of the first proponents of Atticism, alongside his friend Dionysius of Halicarnassus. He wrote a treatise &quot;Against the Phrygians&quot; which apparently criticised the Asiatic style of rhetoric, producing a glossary of Attic phrases, and a treatise on the difference between the Attic and Asiatic styles of rhetoric. He wrote an &quot;Art of Rhetoric&quot; and a work on rhetorical figures, which is quoted by Quintilian. He also wrote a treatise on the Ten Attic Orators, and individual works on the speeches of Demosthenes, Antiphon, and Lysias.

Longinus&#x27; treatise &quot;On the Sublime&quot; was written in response to a work by Caecilius on the same topic.

<text>Théodore Barrière (1823 – 16 October 1877), French playwright, was born in Paris.

He belonged to a family of map engravers which had long been connected with the war department, and spent nine years in that service himself. The success of a vaudeville he had performed at the Beaumarchais and which was immediately snapped up for the repertory of the Palais Royal, showed him his real vocation. During the next thirty years he signed, alone or in collaboration, over a hundred plays; among the most successful were: 
*&quot;La Vie de bohème&quot; (1849), adapted from Henri Murger’s book with the novelist&#x27;s help
*&quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; (1851)
*&quot;Les Filles de marbre&quot; (1853) (subsequently adapted into English as &quot;The Marble Heart&quot; by Charles Selby)
*&quot;Les Faux Bonshommes&quot; (1856) with Ernest Capendu
*&quot;L’Héritage de Monsieur Plumet&quot; (1858)
*&quot;Les Gens nerveux&quot; (1860), with Victorien Sardou
*&quot;Malheureux vaincus&quot; (1865), which was forbidden by the censor
*&quot;Le Gascon&quot; (1878).

Barrière died in Paris.

<doc id="160581" wikidata="Q209583" url="?curid=160581" title="Tachycardia">
<text>Tachycardia, also called tachyarrhythmia, is a heart rate that exceeds the normal resting rate. In general, a resting heart rate over 100 beats per minute is accepted as tachycardia in adults. Heart rates above the resting rate may be normal (such as with exercise) or abnormal (such as with electrical problems within the heart).

==Complications==
Tachycardia can lead to fainting.

When the rate of blood flow becomes too rapid, or fast blood flow passes on damaged endothelium, it increases the friction within vessels resulting in turbulence and other disturbances. According to the Virchow&#x27;s triad, this is one of the three conditions (along with hypercoagulability and endothelial injury/dysfunction) that can lead to thrombosis (i.e., blood clots within vessels).

==Causes==
Some causes of tachycardia include:

* Adrenergic storm
* Anaemia
* Anxiety
* Atrial fibrillation
* Atrial flutter
* Atrial tachycardia
* Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia
* AV nodal reentrant tachycardia
* Brugada syndrome
* Circulatory shock and its various causes (obstructive shock, cardiogenic shock, hypovolemic shock, distributive shock)
* Dehydration
* Dysautonomia
* Exercise
* Fear
* Hypoglycemia
* Hypovolemia
* Hyperthyroidism
* Hyperventilation
* Inappropriate sinus tachycardia
* Junctional tachycardia
* Metabolic myopathy
* Multifocal atrial tachycardia
* Pacemaker mediated
* Pain
* Panic attack
* Pheochromocytoma
* Sinus tachycardia
* Sleep deprivation
* Supraventricular tachycardia
* Ventricular tachycardia
* Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome

Drug related:
* Alcohol (Ethanol) intoxication
* Stimulants
* Cannabis
* Drug withdrawal
* Tricyclic antidepressants
* Nefopam
* Opioids (rare)
==Diagnosis==
The upper threshold of a normal human resting heart rate is based on age. Cutoff values for tachycardia in different age groups are fairly well standardized; typical cutoffs are listed below:
* 1–2 days: Tachycardia &gt;159 beats per minute (bpm)
* 3–6 days: Tachycardia &gt;166 bpm
* 1–3 weeks: Tachycardia &gt;182 bpm
* 1–2 months: Tachycardia &gt;179 bpm
* 3–5 months: Tachycardia &gt;186 bpm
* 6–11 months: Tachycardia &gt;169 bpm
* 1–2 years: Tachycardia &gt;151 bpm
* 3–4 years: Tachycardia &gt;137 bpm
* 5–7 years: Tachycardia &gt;133 bpm
* 8–11 years: Tachycardia &gt;130 bpm
* 12–15 years: Tachycardia &gt;119 bpm
* &gt;15 years – adult: Tachycardia &gt;100 bpm

Heart rate is considered in the context of the prevailing clinical picture. When the heart beats excessively or rapidly, the heart pumps less efficiently and provides less blood flow to the rest of the body, including the heart itself. The increased heart rate also leads to increased work and oxygen demand by the heart, which can lead to rate related ischemia.

===Differential diagnosis===
An electrocardiogram (ECG) is used to classify the type of tachycardia. They may be classified into narrow and wide complex based on the QRS complex. Equal or less than 0.1s for narrow complex. Presented in order of most to least common, they are:
* Narrow complex
** Sinus tachycardia, which originates from the sino-atrial (SA) node, near the base of the superior vena cava
** Atrial fibrillation
** Atrial flutter
** AV nodal reentrant tachycardia
** Accessory pathway mediated tachycardia
** Atrial tachycardia
** Multifocal atrial tachycardia
** Cardiac Tamponade
** Junctional tachycardia (rare in adults)
* Wide complex
** Ventricular tachycardia, any tachycardia that originates in the ventricles
** Any narrow complex tachycardia combined with a problem with the conduction system of the heart, often termed &quot;supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy&quot;
** A narrow complex tachycardia with an accessory conduction pathway, often termed &quot;supraventricular tachycardia with pre-excitation&quot; (e.g. Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome)
** Pacemaker-tracked or pacemaker-mediated tachycardia

Tachycardias may be classified as either narrow complex tachycardias (supraventricular tachycardias) or wide complex tachycardias. Narrow and wide refer to the width of the QRS complex on the ECG. Narrow complex tachycardias tend to originate in the atria, while wide complex tachycardias tend to originate in the ventricles. Tachycardias can be further classified as either regular or irregular.

====Sinus====

The body has several feedback mechanisms to maintain adequate blood flow and blood pressure. If blood pressure decreases, the heart beats faster in an attempt to raise it. This is called reflex tachycardia. This can happen in response to a decrease in blood volume (through dehydration or bleeding), or an unexpected change in blood flow. The most common cause of the latter is orthostatic hypotension (also called postural hypotension). Fever, hyperventilation, diarrhea and severe infections can also cause tachycardia, primarily due to increase in metabolic demands.

Upon exertion, sinus tachycardia can also be seen in some inborn errors of metabolism that result in metabolic myopathies, such as McArdle&#x27;s disease (GSD-V). Metabolic myopathies interfere with the muscle&#x27;s ability to create energy. This energy shortage in muscle cells causes an inappropriate rapid heart rate in response to exercise. The heart tries to compensate for the energy shortage by increasing heart rate to maximize delivery of oxygen and other blood borne fuels to the muscle cells.

&quot;In McArdle&#x27;s, our heart rate tends to increase in what is called an &#x27;inappropriate&#x27; response. That is, after the start of exercise it increases much more quickly than would be expected in someone unaffected by McArdle&#x27;s.&quot; As skeletal muscle relies predominantly on glycogenolysis for the first few minutes as it transitions from rest to activity, as well as throughout high-intensity aerobic activity and all anaerobic activity, individuals with GSD-V experience during exercise: sinus tachycardia, tachypnea, muscle fatigue and pain, during the aforementioned activities and time frames. Those with GSD-V also experience &quot;second wind&quot;, after approximately 6–10 minutes of light-moderate aerobic activity, such as walking without an incline, where the heart rate drops and symptoms of exercise intolerance improve.

An increase in sympathetic nervous system stimulation causes the heart rate to increase, both by the direct action of sympathetic nerve fibers on the heart and by causing the endocrine system to release hormones such as epinephrine (adrenaline), which have a similar effect. Increased sympathetic stimulation is usually due to physical or psychological stress. This is the basis for the so-called fight-or-flight response, but such stimulation can also be induced by stimulants such as ephedrine, amphetamines or cocaine. Certain endocrine disorders such as pheochromocytoma can also cause epinephrine release and can result in tachycardia independent of nervous system stimulation. Hyperthyroidism can also cause tachycardia. The upper limit of normal rate for sinus tachycardia is thought to be 220 bpm minus age.

=====Inappropriate sinus tachycardia=====
Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) is a diagnosis of exclusion, a rare but benign type of cardiac arrhythmia that may be caused by a structural abnormality in the sinus node. It can occur in seemingly healthy individuals with no history of cardiovascular disease. Other causes may include autonomic nervous system deficits, autoimmune response, or drug interactions. Although symptoms might be distressing, treatment is not generally needed.

====Ventricular====
Ventricular tachycardia (VT or V-tach) is a potentially life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia that originates in the ventricles. It is usually a regular, wide complex tachycardia with a rate between 120 and 250 beats per minute. A medically significant subvariant of ventricular tachycardia is called &quot;torsades de pointes&quot; (literally meaning &quot;twisting of the points&quot;, due to its appearance on an EKG), which tends to result from a long QT interval.

Both of these rhythms normally last for only a few seconds to minutes&quot; (paroxysmal tachycardia)&quot;, but if VT persists it is extremely dangerous, often leading to ventricular fibrillation.

====Supraventricular====
This is a type of tachycardia that originates from above the ventricles, such as the atria. It is sometimes known as paroxysmal atrial tachycardia (PAT). Several types of supraventricular tachycardia are known to exist.

=====Atrial fibrillation=====
Atrial fibrillation is one of the most common cardiac arrhythmias. In general, it is an irregular, narrow complex rhythm. However, it may show wide QRS complexes on the ECG if a bundle branch block is present. At high rates, the QRS complex may also become wide due to the Ashman phenomenon. It may be difficult to determine the rhythm&#x27;s regularity when the rate exceeds 150 beats per minute. Depending on the patient&#x27;s health and other variables such as medications taken for rate control, atrial fibrillation may cause heart rates that span from 50 to 250 beats per minute (or even higher if an accessory pathway is present). However, new-onset atrial fibrillation tends to present with rates between 100 and 150 beats per minute.

=====AV nodal reentrant tachycardia=====
AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) is the most common reentrant tachycardia. It is a regular narrow complex tachycardia that usually responds well to the Valsalva maneuver or the drug adenosine. However, unstable patients sometimes require synchronized cardioversion. Definitive care may include catheter ablation.

=====AV reentrant tachycardia=====
AV reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) requires an accessory pathway for its maintenance. AVRT may involve orthodromic conduction (where the impulse travels down the AV node to the ventricles and back up to the atria through the accessory pathway) or antidromic conduction (which the impulse travels down the accessory pathway and back up to the atria through the AV node). Orthodromic conduction usually results in a narrow complex tachycardia, and antidromic conduction usually results in a wide complex tachycardia that often mimics ventricular tachycardia. Most antiarrhythmics are contraindicated in the emergency treatment of AVRT, because they may paradoxically increase conduction across the accessory pathway. 

=====Junctional tachycardia=====
Junctional tachycardia is an automatic tachycardia originating in the AV junction. It tends to be a regular, narrow complex tachycardia and may be a sign of digitalis toxicity.

==Management==
The management of tachycardia depends on its type (wide complex versus narrow complex), whether or not the person is stable or unstable, and whether the instability is due to the tachycardia. Unstable means that either important organ functions are affected or cardiac arrest is about to occur. Stable means that there is a tachycardia, but it does not seem an immediate threat for the patient&#x27;s health, but only a symptom of an unknown disease, or a reaction that is not very dangerous in that moment.

===Unstable===
In those that are unstable with a narrow complex tachycardia, intravenous adenosine may be attempted. In all others, immediate cardioversion is recommended.

=== Stable ===
If the problem is a simple acceleration of the heart rate that worries the patient, but the heart and the general patient&#x27;s health remain stable enough, it is possible to correct it by a simple deceleration using some physical maneuvers called vagal maneuvers. But, if the cause of the tachycardia is chronic (permanent), it would return after some time, unless that cause is corrected.

Besides, the patient should avoid receiving external effects that cause or increase tachycardia.

The same measures than in unstable tachycardia can also be taken, with medications and the type of cardioversion that is appropriate for the patient&#x27;s tachycardia. 

==Terminology==
The word &quot;tachycardia&quot; came to English from Neo-Latin as a neoclassical compound built from the combining forms &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;, which are from the Greek ταχύς &quot;tachys&quot;, &quot;quick, rapid&quot; and καρδία, &quot;kardia&quot;, &quot;heart&quot;. As a matter both of usage choices in the medical literature and of idiom in natural language, the words &quot;tachycardia&quot; and &quot;tachyarrhythmia&quot; are usually used interchangeably, or loosely enough that precise differentiation is not explicit. Some careful writers have tried to maintain a logical differentiation between them, which is reflected in major medical dictionaries and major general dictionaries. The distinction is that &quot;tachycardia&quot; be reserved for the rapid heart rate itself, regardless of cause, physiologic or pathologic (that is, from healthy response to exercise or from cardiac arrhythmia), and that &quot;tachyarrhythmia&quot; be reserved for the pathologic form (that is, an arrhythmia of the rapid rate type). This is why five of the previously referenced dictionaries do &quot;not&quot; enter cross-references indicating synonymy between their entries for the two words (as they do elsewhere whenever synonymy is meant), and it is why one of them explicitly specifies that the two words not be confused. But the prescription will probably never be successfully imposed on general usage, not only because much of the existing medical literature ignores it even when the words stand alone but also because the terms for specific types of arrhythmia (standard collocations of adjectives and noun) are deeply established idiomatically with the &quot;tachycardia&quot; version as the more commonly used version. Thus SVT is called supraventricular tachycardia more than twice as often as it is called supraventricular tachyarrhythmia; moreover, those two terms are always completely synonymous—in natural language there is no such term as &quot;healthy/physiologic supraventricular tachycardia&quot;. The same themes are also true of AVRT and AVNRT. Thus this pair is an example of when a particular prescription (which may have been tenable 50 or 100 years earlier) can no longer be invariably enforced without violating idiom. But the power to differentiate in an idiomatic way is not lost, regardless, because when the specification of physiologic tachycardia is needed, that phrase aptly conveys it.

<text>Anton Giulio Barrili (14 December 1836 in Savona – 14 August 1908 in Carcare) was an Italian novelist. He was educated for the legal profession, which he abandoned in Genoa for journalism. He was a volunteer in the campaign of 1859 and served with Garibaldi in 1866 (Austro-Prussian War, Third Italian War of Independence) and 1867. From 1865 onwards he published a large number of books of fiction, which had wide popularity, his work being commonly compared with that of Victor Cherbuliez.

Some of the best of the later ones are (1866), (1875), and (1877). His appeared in 1899. Barrili also wrote two plays and various volumes of criticism, including (1890). He was elected to the Italian chamber of deputies in 1876; and in 1889 became professor of Italian literature at the University of Genoa.

<text>Daines Barrington, FRS, FSA (1727/2814 March 1800) was an English lawyer, antiquary and naturalist. He was one of the correspondents to whom Gilbert White wrote extensively on natural history topics. Barrington served as a Vice President of the Royal Society and wrote on a range of topics related to the natural sciences including early ideas and scientific experimentation on the learning of songs by young birds. He designed a standard format for the collection of information about weather, the flowering of plants, the singing of birds and other annual changes that was also used by Gilbert White. He also wrote on child geniuses including Mozart, who at the age of nine had visited England.

==Early life and legal career==
Barrington was the third son of John Barrington, 1st Viscount Barrington. He matriculated at The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, in 1745, but never graduated. In the same year he was admitted to the Inner Temple, and was called to the bar in 1750.

He subsequently held various legal offices, including marshal of the High Court of Admiralty, 1751–3; a judge of Great Sessions for North Wales (Anglesey, Caernarfonshire and Merionethshire) from 1757; Recorder of Bristol and King&#x27;s Counsel from 1764; and second justice of Chester from 1778. Though considered by some (including Jeremy Bentham) to be an indifferent judge, his &quot;Observations on the Statutes, chiefly the more ancient, from Magna Charta to 21st James I&quot; (1766), had a high reputation among historians and constitutional antiquaries, and ran through five editions down to 1796. He resigned all his legal offices in 1785, retaining only that of Commissary General of the stores at Gibraltar, which continued to provide him with a substantial income until his death.

==Antiquarian and scientific writings==
In 1773 Barrington published an edition of &quot;Orosius&quot;, with the Anglo-Saxon version, and an English translation with original notes. His &quot;Tracts on the Probability of reaching the North Pole&quot; (1775) were written in consequence of the northern voyage of discovery undertaken by Captain Constantine John Phipps, afterwards Lord Mulgrave (1744–1792).

Barrington&#x27;s other writings are chiefly to be found in the publications of the Royal Society and the Society of Antiquaries: he was elected to both bodies in 1767, and afterwards became a vice-president of the latter. Many of these papers were collected by him in a quarto volume entitled &quot;Miscellanies on various Subjects&quot; (1781).

His &quot;Account of a very remarkable young Musician&quot; describes the 1764 London visit of the nine-year-old Mozart and first appeared in &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot; in 1770, later to be gathered in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot; with accounts of other prodigies, namely, William Crotch, Charles and Samuel Wesley, and Garret Wesley, 1st Earl of Mornington. 
 Finding that he was in humour, and as it were inspired, I then desired him to compose a &quot;Song of Rage&quot;, such as might be proper for the opera stage.
The boy again looked back with much archness, and began five or six lines of a jargon recitative proper to precede a &quot;Song of Anger&quot;.
This lasted also about the same time with the &quot;Song of Love&quot;; and in the middle of it, he had worked himself up to such a pitch, that he beat his harpsichord like a person possessed, rising sometimes in his chair.
…I must add [the fact that] I have been informed by two or three able musicians, when Bach the celebrated composer had begun a fugue and left off abruptly, that little Mozart hath taken it up, and worked it after a most masterly manner.
Witness as I was myself of most of these extraordinary facts, I must own that I could not help suspecting his father imposed with regard to the age of the boy, though he had not only a most childish appearance, but likewise had all the actions of that stage of life. For example, whilst he was playing to me, a favorite cat came in, upon which he immediately left his harpsichord, nor could we bring him back for a considerable time.

Other studies include &quot;Experiments and Observations on the Singing of Birds&quot; and an essay on the language of birds. Barrington attempted cross-fostering experiments on birds and noted that young linnets raised with foster parents could be induced to learn the songs of various lark species. He however dismissed the idea of long-distance migration in birds, and supported the ancient view that swallows went to sleep underwater during winter.

Letters to Barrington from the parson-naturalist Gilbert White form a large part of White&#x27;s 1789 book &quot;The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne&quot;; Barrington&#x27;s half of the correspondence is not included. Barrington established the format of the &quot;Naturalist&#x27;s Journal&quot; for &quot;keeping a daily register of observations on the weather, plants, birds, insects, &amp;c&quot; based on Benjamin Stillingfleet for collating information from across England. This format printed by Gilbert White&#x27;s brother Benjamin was used from around 1769 to serve the study of the natural history of Selbourne. Very few of his log books are extant but Barrington has been considered as a pioneer of the study of phenology.

Barrington met the Cornish speaker Dolly Pentreath and published a report of the encounter. This report is the main source for the claim that Dolly was the last speaker of the Cornish language. A year after Dolly Pentreath died in 1777, Barrington received a letter, written in Cornish and accompanied by an English translation, from a fisherman in Mousehole named William Bodinar stating that he knew of five people who could speak Cornish in that village alone. Barrington also speaks of a John Nancarrow from Marazion who was a native speaker and survived into the 1790s.

The plant genus &quot;Barringtonia&quot; is named in his honour.

==Death and burial==
Barrington never married, and lived for most of his life in chambers in King&#x27;s Bench Walk in the Inner Temple, London. He was afflicted by paralysis from his legs upward and died after being bedridden for a long time on 14 March 1800; his remains were interred in the vault of the Temple Church.

<doc id="160591" wikidata="Q1066447" url="?curid=160591" title="Charles William Eliot">
<text>Charles William Eliot (March 20, 1834 – August 22, 1926) was an American academic who was president of Harvard University from 1869 to 1909, the longest term of any Harvard president. A member of the prominent Eliot family of Boston, he transformed Harvard from a respected provincial college into America&#x27;s preeminent research university.
Theodore Roosevelt called him &quot;the only man in the world I envy.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Eliot was born a scion of the wealthy Eliot family of Boston. He was the son of politician Samuel Atkins Eliot and his wife Mary (née Lyman), and was the grandchild of banker Samuel Eliot and merchant Theodore Lyman of the Lyman Estate. His grandfather was one of the wealthiest merchants of Boston. He was one of five siblings and the only boy. Eliot graduated from Boston Latin School in 1849 and from Harvard University in 1853. He was later made an honorary member of the Hasty Pudding.

Although he had high expectations and obvious scientific talents, the first fifteen years of Eliot&#x27;s career were less than auspicious. He was appointed Tutor in Mathematics at Harvard in the fall of 1854, and studied chemistry with Josiah P. Cooke. In 1858, he was promoted to Assistant Professor of Mathematics and Chemistry. He taught competently, wrote some technical pieces on chemical impurities in industrial metals, and busied himself with schemes for the reform of Harvard&#x27;s Lawrence Scientific School.

But his real goal, appointment to the Rumford Professorship of Chemistry, eluded him. This was a particularly bitter blow because of a change in his family&#x27;s economic circumstances—the financial failure of his father, Samuel Atkins Eliot, in the Panic of 1857. Eliot had to face the fact that &quot;he had nothing to look to but his teacher&#x27;s salary and a legacy left to him by his grandfather Lyman.&quot; After a bitter struggle over the Rumford chair, Eliot left Harvard in 1863. His friends assumed that he would &quot;be obliged to cut chemistry and go into business in order to earn a livelihood for his family.&quot; But instead, he used his grandfather&#x27;s large legacy and a small borrowed sum to spend the next two years studying the educational systems of the Old World in Europe.

==Studies of European education==
Eliot&#x27;s approach to investigating European education was unusual. He did not confine his attention to educational institutions, but explored the role of education in every aspect of national life. When Eliot visited schools, he took an interest in every aspect of institutional operation, from curriculum and methods of instruction through physical arrangements and custodial services. But his particular concern was with the relation between education and economic growth:
 
Eliot understood the interdependence of education and enterprise. In a letter to his cousin Arthur T. Lyman, he discussed the value to the German chemical industry of discoveries made in university laboratories. He also recognized that, while European universities depended on government for support, American institutions would have to draw on the resources of the wealthy. He wrote to his cousin:

While Eliot was in Europe, he was again presented with the opportunity to enter the world of active business. The Merrimack Mills, one of the largest textile mills in the United States, tendered him an invitation to become its superintendent. In spite of the urgings of his friends and the attractiveness of what for the time was the enormous salary of $5000 (plus a good house, rent free), Eliot, after giving considerable thought to the offer, turned it down. One of his biographers speculated that he surely realized by this time that he had a strong taste for organizing and administration. This post would have given it scope. He must have felt, even if dimly, that if science interested him, it was not because he was first and last a lover of her laws and generalizations, not only because the clarity and precision of science was congenial, but because science answered the questions of practical men and conferred knowledge and power upon those who would perform the labors of their generation.

During nearly two years in Europe he had found himself as much fascinated by what he could learn concerning the methods by which science could be made to help industry as by what he discovered about the organization of institutions of learning. He was thinking much about what his own young country needed, and his hopes for the United States took account of industry and commerce as well as the field of academic endeavor. To be the chief executive officer of a particular business offered only a limited range of influence; but to stand at the intersection of the realm of production and the realm of knowledge offered considerably more.

== Crisis in American colleges ==
In the 1800s, American colleges, controlled by clergymen, continued to embrace classical curricula that had little relevance to an industrializing nation. Few offered courses in the sciences, modern languages, history, or political economy — and only a handful had graduate or professional schools.

As businessmen became increasingly reluctant to send their sons to schools whose curricula offered nothing useful — or to donate money for their support, some educational leaders began exploring ways of making higher education more attractive. Some backed the establishment of specialized schools of science and technology, like Harvard&#x27;s Lawrence Scientific School, Yale&#x27;s Sheffield Scientific School, and the newly chartered Massachusetts Institute of Technology, about to offer its first classes in 1865. Others proposed abandoning the classical curriculum, in favor of more vocational offerings.

Harvard was in the middle of this crisis. After three undistinguished short-term clerical Harvard presidencies in a ten-year period, Boston&#x27;s business leaders, many of them Harvard alumni, were pressing for change — though with no clear idea of the kinds of changes they wanted.
On his return to the United States in 1865, Eliot accepted an appointment as Professor of Analytical Chemistry at the newly founded Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In that year, an important revolution occurred in the government of Harvard University. The board of overseers had hitherto consisted of the governor, lieutenant-governor, president of the state senate, speaker of the house, secretary of the board of education, and president and treasurer of the university, together with thirty other persons, and these other persons were elected by joint ballot of the two houses of the state legislature.

An opinion had long been gaining ground that it would be better for the community and the interests of learning, as well as for the university, if the power to elect the overseers were transferred from the legislature to the graduates of the college. This change was made in 1865, and at the same time the governor and other state officers ceased to form part of the board. The effect of this change was to greatly strengthen the interest of the alumni in the management of the university, and thus to prepare the way for extensive and thorough reforms. Shortly afterward Dr. Thomas Hill resigned the presidency, and after a considerable interregnum Eliot succeeded to that office in 1869.

==Harvard presidency==
Early in 1869, Eliot had presented his ideas about reforming American higher education in a compelling two-part article, &quot;The New Education,&quot; in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, the nation&#x27;s leading journal of opinion. &quot;We are fighting a wilderness, physical and moral,&quot; Eliot declared in setting forth his vision of the American university, &quot;for this fight we must be trained and armed.&quot; The articles resonated powerfully with the businessmen who controlled the Harvard Corporation. Shortly after their appearance, merely 35 years old, he was elected as the youngest president in the history of the nation&#x27;s oldest university.

Eliot&#x27;s educational vision incorporated important elements of Unitarian and Emersonian ideas about character development, framed by a pragmatic understanding of the role of higher education in economic and political leadership. His concern in &quot;The New Education&quot; was not merely curriculum, but the ultimate utility of education. A college education could enable a student to make intelligent choices, but should not attempt to provide specialized vocational or technical training.

Although his methods were pragmatic, Eliot&#x27;s ultimate goal, like those of the secularized Puritanism of the Boston elite, was a spiritual one. The spiritual desideratum was not otherworldly. It was embedded in the material world and consisted of measurable progress of the human spirit towards mastery of human intelligence over nature — the &quot;moral and spiritual wilderness.&quot; While this mastery depended on each individual fully realizing his capacities, it was ultimately a collective achievement and the product of institutions which established the conditions both for individual and collective achievement. Like the Union victory in the Civil War, triumph over the moral and physical wilderness and the establishment of mastery required a joining of industrial and cultural forces.

While he proposed the reform of professional schools, the development of research faculties, and, in general, a huge broadening of the curriculum, his blueprint for undergraduate education in crucial ways preserved — and even enhanced — its traditional spiritual and character education functions. Echoing Emerson, he believed that every individual mind had &quot;its own peculiar constitution.&quot; The problem, both in terms of fully developing an individual&#x27;s capacities and in maximizing his social utility, was to present him with a course of study sufficiently representative so as &quot;to reveal to him, or at least to his teachers and parents, his capacities and tastes.&quot; An informed choice once made, the individual might pursue whatever specialized branch of knowledge he found congenial.

But Eliot&#x27;s goal went well beyond Emersonian self-actualization for its own sake. Framed by the higher purposes of a research university in the service of the nation, specialized expertise could be harnessed to public purposes. &quot;When the revelation of his own peculiar taste and capacity comes to a young man, let him reverently give it welcome, thank God, and take courage,&quot; Eliot declared in his inaugural address. He further stated:

On the subject of educational reform, he declared:

Under Eliot&#x27;s leadership, Harvard adopted an &quot;elective system&quot; which vastly expanded the range of courses offered and permitted undergraduates unrestricted choice in selecting their courses of study — with a view to enabling them to discover their &quot;natural bents&quot; and pursue them into specialized studies. A monumental expansion of Harvard&#x27;s graduate and professional school and departments facilitated specialization, while at the same time making the university a center for advanced scientific and technological research. Accompanying this was a shift in pedagogy from recitations and lectures towards classes that put students&#x27; achievements to the test and, through a revised grading system, rigorously assessed individual performance.
Eliot&#x27;s reforms did not go without criticism. His own kinsman Samuel Eliot Morison in his tercentenary history of Harvard gave an opinion that is rare among historians:

By contrast recent scholars such as Richard M. Freeland, emphasize that Eliot appreciated how Harvard needed to modernize:

Eliot believed that the traditional college, with its rigid curriculum and preoccupation with &quot;virtue and piety,&quot; had become irrelevant to producing successful leaders for the industrial, urban nation of the late nineteenth century. Influenced by his observations of German universities, Eliot saw that conditions favored academic institutions dedicated to the secular achievements of the intellect, places that would nurture contemporary thinking on socially significant subjects and enable ambitious, talented men to demonstrate their abilities. The former objective required a faculty composed less of faithful teachers than of productive scholars for whom the campus would provide the
conditions for creative work. The latter implied a shift of focus from undergraduate, liberal education to graduate work in the most important professional fields. 

=== Opposition to football and other sports ===
During his tenure, Eliot opposed football and tried unsuccessfully to abolish the game at Harvard. In 1905, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that he called it &quot;a fight whose strategy and ethics are those of war&quot;, that violation of rules cannot be prevented, that &quot;the weaker man is considered the legitimate prey of the stronger&quot; and that &quot;no sport is wholesome in which ungenerous or mean acts which easily escape detection contribute to victory.&quot;

He also made public objections to baseball, basketball, and hockey. He was quoted as saying that rowing and tennis were the only clean sports.

Eliot once said:

===Attempted acquisition of MIT===
During his lengthy tenure as Harvard&#x27;s leader, Eliot initiated repeated attempts to acquire his former employer, the fledgling Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and these efforts continued even after he stepped down from the presidency. The much younger college had considerable financial problems during its first five decades, and had been repeatedly rescued from insolvency by various benefactors, including George Eastman, the founder of Eastman Kodak Company. The faculty, students, and alumni of MIT often vehemently opposed merger of their school under the Harvard umbrella. In 1916, MIT succeeded in moving across the Charles River from crowded Back Bay, Boston to larger facilities on the southern riverfront of Cambridge, but still faced the prospect of merger with Harvard,
which was to begin &quot;when the Institute will occupy its splendid new buildings in Cambridge.&quot; However, in 1917, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court rendered a decision that effectively cancelled plans for a merger, and MIT eventually attained independent financial stability. During his life, Eliot had been involved in at least five unsuccessful attempts to absorb MIT into Harvard.

==Personal life==
On October 27, 1858, Eliot married Ellen Derby Peabody of Salem Massachusetts (1836–1869) in Boston at Kings Chapel. Ellen was the daughter of Ephraim Peabody (1807-1856) and Mary Jane Derby (1807-1892), great-great-granddaughter of Elias Hasket Derby (1739-1799), and the sister of architect Robert Swain Peabody. They had four sons, one of whom, Charles Eliot (November 1, 1859 – March 25, 1897) became an important landscape architect, responsible for Boston&#x27;s public park system. He married Mary Yale Pitkin, granddaughter of Rev. Cyrus Yale, members of the Yale family of Yale University. Another son, Samuel Atkins Eliot II (August 24, 1862 – October 15, 1950) became a Unitarian minister who was the longest-serving president of the American Unitarian Association (1900–1927) and was the first president granted executive authority of that organization.

The Nobel Prize-winning poet T.S. Eliot was a cousin and attended Harvard from 1906 through 1909, completing his elective undergraduate courses in three instead of the normal four years, which were the last three years of Charles&#x27; presidency.

After Ellen Derby Peabody died at the age of 33 of tuberculosis, Eliot married a second wife in 1877, Grace Mellen Hopkinson (1846–1924). This second marriage did not produce any children. Grace was a close relative of Frances Stone Hopkinson, wife of Samuel Atkins Eliot II, Charles&#x27;s son.

Eliot retired in 1909, having served 40 years as president, the longest term in the university&#x27;s history, and was honored as Harvard&#x27;s first president emeritus. He lived another 17 years, dying in Northeast Harbor, Maine, in 1926, and was interred in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

== Legacy ==
Under Eliot, Harvard became a worldwide university, accepting its students around America using standardized entrance examinations and hiring well-known scholars from home and abroad. Eliot was an administrative reformer, reorganizing the university&#x27;s faculty into schools and departments and replacing recitations with lectures and seminars. During his forty-year presidency, the university vastly expanded its facilities, with laboratories, libraries, classrooms, and athletic facilities replacing simple colonial structures. Eliot attracted the support of major donors from among the nation&#x27;s growing plutocracy, making it the wealthiest private university in the world.

Eliot&#x27;s leadership made Harvard not only the pace-setter for other American schools, but a major figure in the reform of secondary school education. Both the elite boarding schools, most of them founded during his presidency, and the public high schools shaped their curricula to meet Harvard&#x27;s demanding standards. Eliot was a key figure in the creation of standardized admissions examinations, as a founding member of the College Entrance Examination Board.

As leader of the nation&#x27;s wealthiest and best-known university, Eliot was necessarily a celebrated figure whose opinions were sought on a wide variety of matters, from tax policy (he offered the first coherent rationale for the charitable tax exemption) to the intellectual welfare of the general public.

President Eliot edited the &quot;Harvard Classics&quot;, which together are colloquially known as his Five Foot Shelf and which were intended at the time to suggest a foundation for informed discourse, &quot;A good substitute for a liberal education in youth to anyone who would read them with devotion, even if he could spare but fifteen minutes a day for reading.&quot;

Eliot was an articulate opponent of American imperialism.

During his tenure as Harvard&#x27;s president he denied women&#x27;s demands to be allowed the same educational opportunities as men. In response to these demands he was quoted as saying &quot;the world “(knows) next to nothing about the natural mental capacities of the female sex.”&quot; Regardless of Eliot&#x27;s opposition, women were able to find educational instruction through the Harvard Annex where they could receive instruction from Harvard faculty. Within a decade this program grew to 200 female students, and resulted in the creation of Radcliffe College. In the aftermath of the formation of the college, Eliot, with reservations, countersigned the degrees of women who attend Radcliffe certifying the degrees received by these students are equivalent in everyway to those received by students at Harvard. He still maintained that there must be a separation of the sexes when it came to education.

While Eliot was president of Harvard many firsts happened when it came to the education of African Americans. Richard Theodore Greener was the first African American to graduate from Harvard. W.E.B. Du Bois was the first African American to earn a PhD from Harvard&#x27;s History Department, and from Harvard overall. Also, during his presidency, Eliot saw the hiring of Harvard&#x27;s first African American faculty member George F. Grant. Yet, despite these changes Eliot continued to believe in racial segregation, anti-miscegenation, and eugenics.

Unlike his successor, A. Lawrence Lowell, Eliot opposed efforts to limit the admission of Jews and Roman Catholics. At the same time, Eliot was radically opposed to labor unions, fostering a campus climate where many Harvard students served as strikebreakers; he was called by some &quot;the greatest labor union hater in the country.&quot;

Charles Eliot was a fearless crusader not only for educational reform, but for many of the goals of the progressive movement—whose most prominent figurehead was Theodore Roosevelt (Class of 1880) and most eloquent spokesman was Herbert Croly (Class of 1889).

Eliot was also involved in philanthropy. In 1908 he joined the General Education Board, and in 1913 served on the International Health Board, as well as serving as a trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation from 1914 to 1917. Eliot helped found the Institute for Government Research (Brookings Institution) and served as trustee. He acted as a founding trustee of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace from its beginning in 1910 until 1919. Eliot was an incorporator of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts in 1870, and a trustee. Between 1908 and 1925 he served as the chairman of the Museum&#x27;s Special Advisory Committee on Education. Served as vice president for the National Committee for Mental Hygiene from 1913 till his death. Eliot accepted election to be the first president of the American Social Hygiene Association. In 1902, he became vice president of the National Civil Service Reform League, and president of the league in 1908.

In celebration of President Eliot&#x27;s 90th birthday, congratulations came in across the world and notably from two American Presidents. Woodrow Wilson said of him, “No man has ever made a deeper impression of the educational system of a country than President Eliot has upon the educational system of America,” while Theodore Roosevelt exclaimed, “He is the only man in the world I envy.”

Upon his death in 1926, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a full-page interview that Eliot had given as he neared the end of his life, including excerpts from his writings on education, religion, democracy, labor, woman, and Americanism.

Former Harvard President, Economics Professor, and Secretary of Treasury Lawrence Summers now holds the Charles W. Eliot Emeritus University Professor position at Harvard University.

===Inscriptions composed by Charles W. Eliot===
Over one hundred inscriptions were composed by President Eliot, placed on buildings ranging from schools, churches, public buildings, memorial tablets, numerous monuments, and to the Library of Congress.

===Monuments and memorials===

Eliot House, one of the seven original residential houses for undergraduates at the college, was named in honor of Eliot and opened in 1931. Charles W. Eliot Middle School in Altadena, California, Eliot Elementary School in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Charles William Eliot Junior High School (now Eliot-Hine Middle School) in Washington, DC were named in his honor. In 1940 the United States Postal Service issued a stamp in Eliot&#x27;s honor as part of their Famous Americans Issue. Asteroid (5202) Charleseliot is named in his honor. 
 Eliot Mountain was named in honor of the lifelong academic who summered on Mount Desert Island, Maine, and was a key figure in the creation of Acadia National Park.

<text>Coahuila, formally Coahuila de Zaragoza, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Coahuila de Zaragoza, is one of the 32 states of Mexico. The largest city and State Capital is the city of Saltillo; the second largest is Torreón and the third largest is Monclova (a former state capital); the fourth largest is Piedras Negras; and the fifth largest is Ciudad Acuña.

Coahuila borders the Mexican states of Nuevo León to the east, Zacatecas to the south, and Durango and Chihuahua to the west. To the north, Coahuila accounts for a stretch of the Mexico–United States border, adjacent to the U.S. state of Texas along the course of the Rio Grande (Río Bravo del Norte). With an area of , it is the nation&#x27;s third-largest state. It comprises 38 municipalities &quot;(municipios)&quot;. In 2020, Coahuila&#x27;s population is 3,146,771 inhabitants.

==History==
The name Coahuila derives from native terms for the region, and has been known by variations such as Cuagüila and Cuauila. Some historians believe that this means &quot;flying serpent&quot;, &quot;place of many trees&quot;, or &quot;place where serpents creep&quot;. The official name of the state is Coahuila de Zaragoza, in honor of General Ignacio Zaragoza.

The Spanish explored the north of Mexico some decades after their victory in Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztecs. Such exploration was delayed because the northern climate was harsher and there was no gold. The first Spanish settlement in the region now called Coahuila was at Minas de la Trinidad in 1577. Saltillo was settled in 1586, to form part of the province of Nueva Vizcaya of the Vice-royalty of New Spain. Later it became one of the first provinces of Nueva Extremadura to be explored by Europeans. Among the 16th century settlers of Saltillo and other communities in Nueva Vizcaya were Tlaxcalans, who founded an independent community bordering Saltillo, called San Esteban de Nueva Tlaxcala. 
Coahuila y Tejas was one of the constituent states of the newly independent United Mexican States under their 1824 Constitution, and included Texas, Coahuila and Nuevo León. Later in the same year Nuevo León was detached, but Texas remained a part of the state until 1836, when it seceded to form the Republic of Texas. Monclova was the capital of the state from 1833 to 1835.

In 1840 Coahuila briefly became a member of the short lived Republic of the Rio Grande. In the mid-19th century, the Sánchez Navarro family owned a ranch of mostly in Coahuila. It was the largest privately-owned property in the Americas.
In the 1840s and 1850s, Coahuila was the target of frequent Comanche raids.

On February 19, 1856, Santiago Vidaurri annexed Coahuila to his state, Nuevo León, but it regained its separate status in 1868.

During the Mexican Revolution, Francisco Villa attacked the city of Torreón.

On April 4, 2004, the border city of Piedras Negras was flooded. More than 30 people died and more than 4,000 lost their homes.

In 2007 Coahuila became the first state in Mexico to offer civil unions (Pacto Civil de Solidaridad) to same-sex couples.

==Geography==

The Sierra Madre Oriental runs northwest to southeast through the State, and the higher elevations are home to the Sierra Madre Oriental pine-oak forests. The northernmost fingers of the Sierra Madre Oriental, the Sierra del Burro and the Sierra del Carmen, reach to the border with the United States at the Rio Grande.

East of the range, the land slopes gently toward the Rio Grande, and is drained by several rivers, including the Salado and its tributary, the Sabinas River. The Tamaulipan mezquital, a dry shrubland ecoregion, occupies the eastern portion of the State, and extends across the Rio Grande into southern Texas.

The portion of the State west of the Sierra Madre Oriental lies on the Mexican Plateau, and is part of the Chihuahuan Desert. The Bolsón de Mapimí is a large endorheic basin which covers much of the western portion of the State and extends into adjacent portions of Chihuahua, Durango, and Zacatecas. The Nazas River, which flows east from Durango, and the Aguanaval River, which flows north from Zacatecas, empty into lakes in the Bolsón. Torreón, the most populous city in the State, lies on the Nazas in the irrigated Laguna Region, the &quot;(Comarca Lagunera)&quot;, which straddles the border of Coahuila and Durango.

Coahuila contains two biosphere reserves. Maderas del Carmen lies on the northern border of the State, and includes sections of the Chihuahuan desert and sky islands of pine-oak forest in the Sierra del Carmen. The springs, lakes, and wetlands of the Cuatro Ciénegas Basin lie west of Monclova on the west slope of the Sierra Madre.

Coahuila is largely arid or semi-arid, but the rivers of the State support extensive irrigated agriculture, particularly cotton. The Parras district in the southern part of the State produces wines and brandies. The pine-oak forests of the Sierra Madre produce timber.

<text>Lúthien and Beren are characters in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s fantasy world Middle-earth. Lúthien is an elf, daughter of the elf-king Thingol and goddess-like Melian. Beren is a mortal man. The complex tale of their love for each other and the quest they are forced to embark upon is a story of triumph against overwhelming odds but ending in tragedy. It appears in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, the epic poem &quot;The Lay of Leithian&quot;, the Grey Annals section of &quot;The War of the Jewels&quot;, and in the texts collected in the 2017 book &quot;Beren and Lúthien&quot;. Their story is told to Frodo by Aragorn in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

The story of Lúthien and Beren, immortal elf-maiden marrying a mortal man and choosing mortality for herself, is mirrored in Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen&quot;. The names Beren and Lúthien appear on the grave of Tolkien and his wife Edith. 

Scholars have noted the many sources that Tolkien used in constructing the story. It is based principally on the classical tale of Orpheus and Eurydice in the underworld, supplemented by multiple story elements from myths, legends, and folktales from different periods. These include the Finnish &quot;Kalevala&quot;, the Welsh &quot;Mabinogion&quot;, the &quot;Saga of the Volsungs&quot;, the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, and the folktale &quot;Rapunzel&quot;.

== Context ==

Lúthien was a Telerin (Sindarin) princess, the only child of Elu Thingol, king of Doriath, and his queen, Melian the Maia, making her half-royal, half-divine. She was born in the Years of the Trees, according to the Grey Annals. At her birth, the white flower &quot;niphredil&quot; bloomed for the first time in Doriath.
Lúthien&#x27;s romance with the mortal man Beren is considered the &quot;chief&quot; of the Silmarillion tales by Tolkien himself; he called it &quot;the kernel of the mythology&quot;. Elrond was Lúthien&#x27;s great-grandson and Aragorn was descended from her via Elros and the Royal Family of Númenor. She is described as the Morning Star of the Elves and as the most beautiful daughter of the one god, Ilúvatar. Beren was the son of Emeldir and Barahir, a man of the royal House of Bëor of Dorthonion.

In contrast, Lúthien&#x27;s descendant Arwen was called &quot;Evenstar&quot;, the Evening Star of the Elves, meaning that her beauty reflects that of Lúthien. Lúthien was first cousin once removed of Galadriel (also Arwen&#x27;s grandmother), whose mother, Eärwen of Alqualondë, was the daughter of Thingol&#x27;s brother. The story of Lúthien and Beren is mirrored in &quot;The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen&quot;.

== Etymology ==

The name &quot;Lúthien&quot; appears to mean &quot;daughter of flowers&quot; in a Beleriandic dialect of Sindarin, but it can also be translated &quot;blossom&quot;. The epithet &quot;Tinúviel&quot; was given to her by Beren. It literally means &quot;daughter of the starry twilight&quot;, which signifies &quot;nightingale&quot;. The name &quot;Beren&quot; means &quot;brave&quot; in Sindarin.

== Fictional biography ==

=== Meeting ===

Beren saw Lúthien dancing under moonrise in her father&#x27;s forest, and fell in love with her, captivated by her beauty. He stood in the shadows wishing to be near enough to Lúthien to touch her, but Daeron, her childhood friend and partner in music and dance, noticed Beren and, believing him to be a wild animal, shouted for Lúthien to flee. She saw Beren&#x27;s shadow and ran away. One day in summer when Lúthien was dancing on a green hill surrounded by hemlocks, she sang, awakening Beren. He ran to her, and again she tried to escape and he cried &quot;Tinúviel&quot;. When Lúthien gazed upon him she reciprocated his love. He kissed her, but she slipped away and he fell into a deep sleep. In his hour of despair, she appeared before him, and in the Hidden Kingdom of Doriath set her hand in his and cradled his head against her breast. From then on they met secretly.

=== The quest of the Silmaril ===

Daeron, who also loved her, reported her meetings with Beren to her father.
Though Melian warned her husband against it, Thingol was determined not to let Beren marry his daughter, and set a seemingly impossible task as the bride price: Beren had to bring him one of the Silmarils from Morgoth&#x27;s Iron Crown.

=== Vision and imprisonment ===

Lúthien had a vision of Beren lying suffering in the pits of Sauron, Lord of Werewolves. Her mother told her that Beren was captive in Sauron&#x27;s dungeons. Lúthien decided to save Beren, asking Daeron for help, but he betrayed her to Thingol. Thingol then had her guarded in the high branches of a beech tree. Daeron was filled with remorse; Lúthien forgave him and devised a plan to escape. She enchanted her hair into a cloak to lull her guards to sleep, and ran from her prison.
On her way to rescue Beren, she found Huan, the Hound of Valinor, and was taken to his master Celegorm. He, plotting to force her to marry him, offered to help her, asking her to follow him to Nargothrond. When she arrived, Celegorm held her hostage and forbade her to talk to anyone else. Huan took pity on her, betraying his master, and freed her. Huan was granted the power to speak, and together they escaped from Nargothrond.

They came to Sauron&#x27;s Isle, and Lúthien sang a call to Beren. He answered, but Sauron heard her song and sent wolves to slay Huan, but Huan killed them, one by one. Finally, Sauron transformed himself into the most powerful of all werewolves and went out. Huan flinched, but Lúthien smothered Sauron&#x27;s lunge in her enchanted cloak. Sauron changed into different shapes, but Huan bested him. Lúthien forced Sauron to surrender the keys of his tower; he fled in the shape of a vampire. Lúthien destroyed the Tower. Finding the seemingly dead Beren, she fell down beside him in grief, but with the rising sun he awoke and they were reunited. Huan returned to Celegorm.

=== Celegorm, Curufin and the dance of Lúthien before Morgoth ===

Beren pleaded with Lúthien to return to her father, but she refused. As they were about to embrace, Celegorm and Curufin appeared, exiled because of Lúthien&#x27;s escape from Nargothrond. Seeking revenge, they fought Beren, and Huan again fought on Lúthien&#x27;s side. Beren defeated them, but spared their lives at Lúthien&#x27;s request. Beren stole one of their horses, and the couple fled. As she slept, he went to Angband to get the Silmaril.

Lúthien and Huan disguised themselves as Morgoth&#x27;s vampire Thuringwethil and the werewolf Draugluin. She found Beren and they reached the throne of Morgoth, but he saw through Lúthien&#x27;s disguise. She declared herself and offered to sing for Morgoth. Filled with an evil lust, he accepted, but she put him and his entire court into a deep sleep. She awakened Beren, and he cut a Silmaril from Morgoth&#x27;s crown. As he tried for another Silmaril, his blade snapped, striking Morgoth&#x27;s cheek. Lúthien and Beren fled to the gates, where the werewolf Carcharoth attacked them. Beren thrust the Silmaril into its face, but it bit off Beren&#x27;s hand, swallowing it and the Silmaril. Lúthien sucked out the venom, and with her failing power tried to restore Beren. Huan summoned the Eagles of Manwë, who carried them to Doriath.

=== Return to Doriath and death of Beren ===

Lúthien healed Beren, and together they stood before her father&#x27;s throne. Beren told Thingol that the quest was fulfilled, and that he held a Silmaril in his hand. When Thingol demanded to see it, Beren showed him his stump. The couple then explained what had happened. They were married before Thingol&#x27;s throne that day. Meanwhile, Carcharoth slaughtered all the living beings he came across in his frenzied flight, both empowered and tormented by the jewel burning his stomach. Beren, Thingol, Huan, and other Elves went to defeat the beast. Beren was attacked by the wolf; Huan killed the beast, but died of his wounds. Beren was carried to Doriath, where he died in Lúthien&#x27;s arms.

=== Lúthien becomes mortal for Beren ===

In grief, Lúthien lay down and died, going to the Halls of Mandos. There she sang a song of the suffering of Elves and Men, the greatest ever sung. This proved effective: it was the only time that Mandos ever acted out of pity. He summoned Beren from the houses of the dead, and Lúthien&#x27;s spirit met his by the shores of the sea. Mandos consulted with Manwë, King of Arda. Even Manwë could not change the fate of Men, and so he gave Lúthien a choice: to live in Valinor, but without Beren; or to return to Middle-earth with Beren as a mortal herself, accepting the Doom of Men. She chose Beren and mortality.

=== Return to life, and death ===

Lúthien and Beren dwelt together in Ossiriand until after the sack of Menegroth. Their abode was &quot;Dor Firn-i-Guinar&quot;: the &quot;Land of the Dead that Lived&quot;. They had a son, Dior.

Thingol received the Nauglamír from Húrin, who had recovered it from the ruins of Nargothrond. Thingol decided to unite the greatest works of the Dwarves and the Elves – the Nauglamír and the Silmaril – and hired Dwarf smiths from Nogrod. The Dwarves murdered Thingol and took the Nauglamír. Beren and an army of Green Elves and Ents waylaid the returning Dwarves. Beren reclaimed the Nauglamír, and Lúthien kept the necklace and the great jewel all her life. This hastened Beren&#x27;s and Lúthien&#x27;s end, since her beauty enhanced by the jewel was too bright for mortal lands to bear.

Elrond and Arwen were descendants of Lúthien, as was Aragorn, a descendant of Elrond&#x27;s brother Elros.

== Genealogy ==
== Earlier versions ==
In the various versions of &quot;The Tale of Tinúviel&quot;, Tolkien&#x27;s earliest form of the tale, as published in &quot;The Book of Lost Tales&quot;, her original name is &quot;Tinúviel&quot;. Beren is, in this earlier version, an &quot;Elf&quot; (specifically a Noldo, or &quot;Gnome&quot;), and Sauron has not yet emerged. In his place, they face &quot;Tevildo&quot;, the Prince of Cats, a monstrous cat who is the principal enemy of the Valinorean hound Huan. However Tolkien initially created the character of Beren as a mortal man before this in an even earlier but erased version of the tale.

The story is also told in an epic poem in &quot;The Lays of Beleriand&quot;, upon which most of the finer details of her life and relationship to Beren is extracted from in this article, since &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; provides only a generalization of the tale.

== Analysis ==


The philologist and Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey writes that Tolkien based the tale of Beren and Lúthien on the classical legend of Orpheus in the underworld, and embroiders this framework with story elements from multiple folktales, myths, and legends. These include the Finnish &quot;Kalevala&quot;, the Welsh &quot;Mabinogion&quot;, the Norse &quot;Saga of the Volsungs&quot;, the Icelandic &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, the Old English &quot;Genesis B&quot;, and the German folktale &quot;Rapunzel&quot;. Shippey comments that Tolkien &quot;had not yet freed himself from his sources – as if trying to bring in all the older bits of literature that he liked instead of forging a story with an impetus of its own.&quot;

=== Classical myth ===

Peter Astrup Sundt draws multiple parallels between Beren and Orpheus. More precisely, he compares both Beren and Lúthien and the classical character, as it is Lúthien not Beren who has magical powers, and far from playing a passive Eurydice to be rescued, or not, from the underworld, she too goes to sing for Mandos, the Vala who watches over the souls of the dead. Ben Eldon Stevens adds that Tolkien&#x27;s retelling contrasts sharply with the myth. Where Orpheus nearly manages to retrieve Eurydice from Hades, Lúthien rescues Beren three times – from Sauron&#x27;s fortress-prison of Tol-in-Gaurhoth, involving singing; from Morgoth&#x27;s Angband, with the Silmaril; and by getting Mandos to restore both of them to life. In the original myth, Eurydice meets &quot;a second death&quot;, soon followed by the griefstruck Orpheus, whereas Tolkien has Lúthien and Beren enjoy &quot;a second life&quot; after their &quot;resurrection&quot;.

=== Harrowing of Hell ===

Robert Steed, in &quot;Mallorn&quot;, argues that Tolkien echoes and &quot;creatively adapts&quot; the medieval theme of the Harrowing of Hell, in the tale of Lúthien and Beren, and in other places. The medieval tale holds that Christ spent the time between his crucifixion and resurrection down in Hell, setting the Devil&#x27;s captives free with the irresistible power of his divine light. The motif, Steed suggests, involves a multi-step sequence:

# someone imprisoned in darkness;
# a powerful and evil jailor;
# a still more powerful liberator
# who brings light, and
# sets the captives free.

Steed describes the tale &quot;Of Beren and Lúthien&quot; as an instance, where Lúthien sets Beren free from Sauron&#x27;s imprisonment. Beren is freed from darkness, Lúthien from despair, so, Steed remarks, both of them take on aspects of Christ:

=== Folktale, fairytale ===


Several scholars, from Randel Helms onwards, have noted that Tolkien&#x27;s tale of Beren and Lúthien shares elements with folktales such as the Welsh &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;. One of these is the disapproving parent who sets a seemingly impossible task (or tasks) for the suitor, which is then fulfilled. The Brothers Grimm folktale &quot;The Devil With the Three Golden Hairs&quot; sets such a task, the King requiring the boy to obtain three golden hairs from the Devil&#x27;s beard. Another is the hound Cafall, matching Tolkien&#x27;s Huan, hound of Valinor. 

Shippey and Richard C. West have warned that claims about Tolkien&#x27;s use of sources must be cautious, because as Tolkien said, he thoroughly boiled down his &quot;soup&quot; from the original &quot;bones of the ox&quot; of his sources. Shippey agrees with Alex Lewis and Elizabeth Currie that Tolkien very likely used the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;, as he certainly knew &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;, but finds their suggestion that Tolkien also used von Eschenbach&#x27;s &quot;Parzival&quot; as an Arthurian source improbable, stating that &quot;similarity does not prove connection&quot;. Shippey adds that the hunt of the giant boar Twrch Trwyth is a &quot;plausible&quot; model for the hunt of Carcharoth the wolf. On the other hand, he writes, the incomplete fulfilment of Chief Giant Yspaddaden&#x27;s list of items to be supplied for Olwen&#x27;s hand in marriage does not match the attempt to meet Thingol&#x27;s demand for the Silmaril, and &quot;the scenes aren&#x27;t like each other at all!&quot;

The Tolkien scholar John Garth, writing in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, notes that it took a century for &quot;The Tale of Beren and Lúthien&quot;, mirroring the tale of Second Lieutenant Tolkien watching Edith dancing in a woodland glade far from the &quot;animal horror&quot; of the trenches, to reach publication. Garth finds &quot;much to relish&quot;, as the tale changes through &quot;several gears&quot; until finally it &quot;attains a mythic power&quot;. Beren&#x27;s enemy changes from a cat-demon to the &quot;Necromancer&quot; and eventually to Sauron. Garth comments that if this was supposed to be the lost ancestor of the Rapunzel fairytale, then it definitely portrays a modern &quot;female-centred fairy-tale revisioning&quot; with a Lúthien who may be fairer than mortal tongue can tell, but is also more resourceful than her lover.

=== Personal life === 

In a letter to his son Christopher, dated 11 July 1972, Tolkien requested the inscription below for his wife Edith&#x27;s grave &quot;for she was (and knew she was) my Lúthien.&quot; He added, &quot;I never called Edith &quot;Luthien&quot; – but she was the source of the story... It was first conceived in a small woodland glade filled with hemlocks at Roos in Yorkshire where ... she was able to live with me for a while.&quot; In a footnote to this letter, Tolkien added &quot;she knew the earliest form of the legend...also the poem eventually printed as Aragorn&#x27;s song.&quot; Particularly affecting for Tolkien was Edith&#x27;s conversion to the Catholic Church from the Church of England for his sake upon their marriage; this was a difficult decision for her that caused her much hardship, paralleling the difficulties and suffering of Lúthien from choosing mortality.

Edith and J. R. R. Tolkien lie in Wolvercote Cemetery in north Oxford. Their gravestone shows the association of Lúthien with Edith, and Tolkien with Beren.

<text>Elu Thingol or Elwë Singollo is a fictional character in J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth legendarium. He appears in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, &quot;The Lays of Beleriand&quot; and &quot;The Children of Húrin&quot; and in numerous stories in &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot;. The King of Doriath, King of the Sindar Elves, High-king and Lord of Beleriand, he is a major character in the First Age of Middle-earth and an essential part of the ancestral backgrounding of the romance between Aragorn and Arwen in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Alone among the Elves, he married an angelic Maia, Melian.

Scholars have written that Thingol turns away from the light, so that when he receives a Silmaril, he is unable to appreciate it. They have stated, too, that he fails to take advantage of his marriage to Melian, instead ignoring her advice about the Silmaril, leading to the downfall of his kingdom.

== Fictional history ==

In &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, Thingol is introduced as Elwë, one of the three chieftains (with Finwë and Ingwë) of the Elves who depart from Cuiviénen, the place where the Elves awaken, with the Vala Oromë as ambassadors to Valinor, and who later become Kings. Upon his return, he persuades many of his people to follow him west to Valinor. This host becomes known as the Teleri. Some of the Teleri go to Valinor, following Thingol&#x27;s younger brother Olwë. Thingol meanwhile meets Melian the Maia, an angelic immortal, and falls in love with her; they create an enchantment which keeps his people from finding him. Others of the Teleri reach the northwestern region of Beleriand, but choose to remain there to look for Thingol, who had disappeared there. They later inhabit the forest realm of Doriath, when Thingol reappears and sets up his Kingdom of Doriath and his city of Menegroth; they are among the Sindar or Grey Elves of Beleriand. Alone of his people, he is an Elf of the Light as he has seen the light of the Two Trees of Valinor.

Thingol and Melian have a daughter, Lúthien, who in turn falls in love with the mortal Man Beren. Disapproving of their relationship, Thingol sets numerous quests that he thinks impossible for Beren, so as to prevent him from marrying Lúthien. One of these quests is to recover one of the priceless star-jewels, the Silmarils which Fëanor had created, and the Dark Lord Morgoth had stolen and set in his crown; but even that quest succeeds.

Thingol fights several wars with Morgoth. He is suspicious of the Noldor Elves when they arrive in Beleriand, and refuses to assist them when they fight Morgoth. The hero of Men, Húrin, comes to Menegroth in his old age, lamenting the death of his son Túrin. In bitter rage he hurls the treasured necklace of the fallen Noldor city of Nargothrond, the Nauglamír, at Thingol&#x27;s feet. Melian sees Húrin&#x27;s thought, and deals with him gently; Húrin is sorry, and gives Thingol the Nauglamír. Thingol gets some Dwarves to set his Silmaril in the necklace. The Dwarves do so, but come to covet the unequalled work, and ask Thingol if they may keep it as payment. Thingol angrily refuses; offended, the Dwarves kill him and sack Menegroth. The Sons of Fëanor, who had sworn a terrible oath to recover the Silmarils on behalf of their father, later destroy Doriath to recover the Silmaril; they kill Dior, Thingol&#x27;s grandson, the second and last King of Doriath.

== Analysis ==

In Tolkien&#x27;s constructed languages, Thingol is Sindarin for &quot;grey cloak&quot;, &quot;greymantle&quot;, while the Quenya form of his name, Singollo, has the same meaning. The medievalist and Tolkien scholar Verlyn Flieger writes that while the name Elwë (&quot;the star&quot;) indicates light, this is dimmed by the character&#x27;s second name, the light being &quot;cloaked or mantled over&quot;. Further, Flieger comments that the softening of &quot;Singollo&quot; to &quot;Thingol&quot; can also be taken as a diminishment, reflecting the &quot;sound shifts that occur as light-infused Quenya modifies to twilight Sindarin&quot;.

Flieger states that Thingol&#x27;s actions may seem unjustified thematically, but they make sense in terms of his politics and dynastic needs. She contrasts him with Beren, who though a Man is constantly drawn towards the light. With the return of the Noldor to Middle-earth, perhaps threatening his kingdom, Thingol&#x27;s mood darkens. After he learns of the Elf-on-Elf Kinslaying at Alqualondë perpetrated by the Noldor on the Teleri, Thingol (Teleri himself) bans the use of their language Quenya in his lands, and Sindarin becomes the most prevalent Elven tongue in Middle-earth. He takes successively darker actions, moving further and further from the light, so that even when he receives the Silmaril from Beren, he knows neither how to appreciate it nor how to use it.

Robley Evans, writing in &quot;Mythlore&quot;, draws a parallel between Thingol and Fëanor: like him, he turns away from the Light, and chooses to remain in Middle-earth with Melian, who could stop time and its changes. Evans states that Thingol&#x27;s marriage with Melian seems to &quot;promise a model union of diverse created beings&quot; on first impression. He comments that Thingol is however the &quot;complementary opposite of Fëanor in Tolkien&#x27;s structural counterpoint&quot; in that he is ultimately destroyed by his own version of Fëanor&#x27;s oath; the act of claiming the Silmaril recovered by Beren places his kingdom under the Doom of Mandos. This warned that the Elves would come to harm if they continued their rebellion against the Valar.

The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey writes that Thingol forms part of the tightly-woven plot of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, each part leading ultimately to tragedy. There are three Hidden Elvish Kingdoms, including Doriath, founded by Thingol and his relatives, and they are each betrayed and destroyed. The Kingdoms are each penetrated by a mortal Man, in Doriath&#x27;s case Beren; and the sense of Doom, which Shippey glosses as &quot;future disaster&quot;, hangs heavy over all of them in the tale.

The medievalist Marjorie Burns states that Thingol gains &quot;great power&quot; through his marriage to Melian, writing that she resembles Rider Haggard&#x27;s infinitely desirable Arthurian muse, Ayesha of his 1887 novel &quot;&quot;.

The scholar of religion Lisa Coutras compares Melanie Rawls&#x27;s account of Thingol and Melian to Lisa Hopkins&#x27;s analysis of Tuor and Idril. Rawls presents Thingol as a prideful king who rarely listens to his wife&#x27;s counsel, even though she has immense foresight and wisdom; this helps to bring about the downfall of his kingdom. Hopkins discusses the hero Tuor, who is all the wiser for listening to his wife Idril.

== The House of Thingol ==









§ These figures appear in &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot;, but not in the published Silmarillion. Late in life Tolkien revised the descent of Celeborn to make him a Teler of Alqualondë.
¶ In the published Silmarillion, Edhellos does not appear, Orodreth is Finarfin&#x27;s son (and still Finduilas&#x27; father), and Gil-galad is Fingon&#x27;s son (and thus would not be on this tree).

<text>Kim Hunter (born Janet Cole; November 12, 1922 – September 11, 2002) was an American theatre, film, and television actress. She achieved prominence for portraying Stella Kowalski in the original production of Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, which she reprised for the 1951 film adaptation, and won both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress.

Decades later, she was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for portraying Nola Madison on the soap opera &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;. She also portrayed the chimpanzee Zira in &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; (1968), and its sequels &quot;Beneath the Planet of the Apes&quot; (1970) and &quot;Escape from the Planet of the Apes&quot; (1971).

==Early life==
Hunter was born in Detroit, Michigan, the daughter of Grace Lind, who was trained as a concert pianist, and Donald Cole, a refrigeration engineer. She was of English and Welsh descent. Hunter attended Miami Beach High School.

==Career==
Hunter&#x27;s first film role was in the 1943 horror &quot;The Seventh Victim&quot;, and her first starring role was playing opposite David Niven in the 1946 British fantasy film &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot;. In 1947, she was Stella Kowalski on stage in the original Broadway production of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire.&quot; Recreating that role in the 1951 film version, Hunter won both the Academy and Golden Globe awards for Best Supporting Actress. In the interim, however, in 1948, she had already joined with &quot;Streetcar&quot; co-stars Marlon Brando, Karl Malden, and 47 others, to become one of the first members accepted by the newly created Actors Studio.

In 1952, Hunter became Humphrey Bogart&#x27;s leading lady in &quot;Deadline USA.&quot;

Hunter was blacklisted from film and television in the 1950s, amid suspicions of communism in Hollywood, during the era of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC).

In 1956, with the HUAC&#x27;s influence subsiding, she co-starred in Rod Serling&#x27;s Peabody Award-winning teleplay on &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, &quot;Requiem for a Heavyweight&quot;. The telecast won multiple Emmy Awards, including Best Single Program of the Year. She appeared opposite Mickey Rooney in the 1957 live CBS-TV broadcast of &quot;The Comedian,&quot; another drama written by Rod Serling and directed by John Frankenheimer. In 1959, she appeared in &quot;Rawhide&quot; in &quot;Incident of the Misplaced Indians&quot; as Amelia Spaulding. On February 4, 1968, she appeared as Ada Halle in the NBC TV Western series &quot;Bonanza&quot; in the episode &quot;The Price of Salt&quot;.

Starting in 1968, Hunter took on the role of Zira, the sympathetic chimpanzee scientist in the science fiction film &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;, as well as two of its sequels. She also appeared in several radio and TV soap operas, most notably as Hollywood actress Nola Madison in ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Edge of Night,&quot; for which she received a Daytime Emmy Award nomination as Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 1980. In 1979, she appeared as First Lady Ellen Axson Wilson in the serial drama &quot;Backstairs at the White House.&quot;

Hunter starred in the controversial TV movie &quot;Born Innocent&quot; (1974) playing the mother of Linda Blair&#x27;s character. She also starred in several episodes of the &quot;CBS Radio Mystery Theater&quot; during the mid-1970s. In 1971, she appeared in an episode of &quot;Cannon.&quot; In the same year, she starred in a &quot;Columbo&quot; episode &quot;Suitable for Framing&quot;. In 1974, she appeared on Raymond Burr&#x27;s &quot;Ironside&quot;. In 1977, she appeared on the NBC Western series &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot; starring Rod Taylor, in the episode &quot;The Waterhole&quot;, which also featured Lonny Chapman.

Hunter&#x27;s last film role in a major motion picture was in Clint Eastwood&#x27;s 1997 film, &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&quot;. In it, Hunter portrayed Betty Harty, legal secretary for real-life Savannah lawyer Sonny Seiler.

==Personal life==
Hunter was married twice, first to William Baldwin, a Marine Corps pilot, in 1944. The couple had a daughter, Kathryn Deirdre (b. 1944), before divorcing two years later. She wed Robert Emmett in 1951. They had a son, Sean Robert, in 1954. Hunter and Emmett would occasionally perform together in stage plays; he died in 2000.

Hunter was a lifelong progressive Democrat. 

==Death==
Hunter died in New York City on September 11, 2002, of a heart attack at the age of 79. Her ashes were given to her daughter—an attorney, civic leader, and former judge in Connecticut—after cremation.

==Legacy==
Hunter received two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one for motion pictures at 1615 Vine Street and a second for television at 1715 Vine Street.

<text>Statius Caecilius, also known as Caecilius Statius (; c. 220 BC – c. 166 BC), was a Celtic Roman comic poet.

==Life and work==
A contemporary and intimate friend of Ennius, according to tradition he was born in the territory of the Celtic Insubrian Gauls, probably in Mediolanum, and was probably taken as a prisoner to Rome (c. 200), during the Roman-Gallic wars. Originally a slave, he assumed the name of Caecilius from his patron, probably one of the Metelli. However, according to one source he was free-born of Samnite stock whose family had settled in Cisalpine Gaul following the Second Punic War. In this case he would have been a native speaker of a language close to Latin, rather than Gaulish Insubrian. There he came to the attention of Marcus Caecilius Denter, the Legatus Legionibus Praepositus in Cisalpine Gaul in 200 BC who introduced him in Rome.

He supported himself by adapting Greek plays for the Roman stage from the New Comedy writers, especially Menander, a genre called Comoedia Palliata. If the statement in the life of Terence by Suetonius is correct and the reading sound, Caecilius&#x27;s judgment was so esteemed that he was ordered to hear Terence&#x27;s &quot;Andria&quot; (exhibited 166 BC) read and to pronounce an opinion upon it.

After several failures, Caecilius gained a high reputation. Volcatius Sedigitus, the dramatic critic, places him first amongst the comic poets; Varro credits him with pathos and skill in the construction of his plots; Horace (&quot;Epistles&quot;, ii. I. 59) contrasts his dignity with the art of Terence. Quintilian (&quot;Inst. Orat.&quot;, x. I. 99) speaks somewhat disparagingly of him, and Cicero, although he admits with some hesitation that Caecilius may have been the chief of the comic poets (&quot;De Optimo Genere Oratorum&quot;, I), considers him inferior to Terence in style and Latinity (&quot;Ad Atticum&quot; vii. 3), as was only natural, considering his foreign extraction.

The fact that his plays could be referred to by name alone without any indication of the author (Cicero, &quot;De Finibus&quot;, ii. 7) is sufficient proof of their widespread popularity. Caecilius holds a place between Plautus and Terence in his treatment of the Greek originals; he did not, like Plautus, confound things Greek and Roman, nor, like Terence, eliminate everything that could not be romanized.

The fragments of his plays are chiefly preserved in Aulus Gellius, who cites several passages from &quot;Plocium&quot; (&quot;The Necklace&quot;) together with the original Greek of Menander, affording the only opportunity, apart from Plautus&#x27; &quot;Bacchides&quot;, to make a substantial comparison between a Roman comedy and its Greek model. Caecilius&#x27; version, diffuse and by no means close as a translation, does not reproduce the spirit of the original.

His comedies &quot;apparently included serious thoughts on moral and social issues, mostly related to the immediate family, the corresponding relationships, and the impact of one’s personal affairs on one’s position in society.&quot;

==Surviving titles and fragments==
Forty-two titles are known, about half based on Menander, and half on other Greek authors. Approximately 280 fragmentary verses survive. &quot;Plocium&quot; is the best preserved (45 verses). In addition to that, a large fragment of &quot;Obolostates&quot; was discovered not long ago among the &quot;papyri&quot; of Herculaneum; it is as yet unedited, but is estimated to contain fragments of 400-500 lines. Some preliminary information was published by the researcher, Knut Kleve, in 1996.

<text>Fingolfin () is a character in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium, appearing in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;. He was the son of Finwë, High King of the Noldor. He was threatened by his half-brother Fëanor, who held him in contempt for not being a pure-bred Noldor. Even so, when Fëanor stole ships and left Aman, Fingolfin chose to follow him back to Middle-earth, taking the dangerous route over the ice of the Helcaraxë. On arrival, he challenged the Dark Lord Morgoth at the gates of his fortress, Angband, but Morgoth stayed inside. When his son Fingon rescued Maedhros, son of Fëanor, Maedhros gratefully renounced his claim to kingship, and Fingolfin became High King of the Noldor. He was victorious at the battle of Dagor Aglareb, and there was peace for some 400 years until Morgoth broke out and destroyed Beleriand in the Dagor Bragollach. Fingolfin, receiving false news, rode alone to Angband and challenged Morgoth to single combat. He wounded Morgoth several times, but grew weary and was killed by the immortal Vala.

Fingolfin has inspired artists, musicians and video game designers to create depictions of his deeds.

== Internal history ==

=== Birth ===

Fingolfin was the second son of Finwë, High King of the Noldor, a division of the Elves lower than the Vanyar but higher than the Teleri. He was full brother of Finarfin, and half-brother of Fëanor, who was the eldest of Finwë&#x27;s sons. He founded the House of Fingolfin which ruled the Noldor in Middle-earth. His wife was Anairë and his children were Fingon, Turgon, Aredhel and Argon. Fingolfin was said to be the strongest, most steadfast, and most valiant of Finwë&#x27;s sons. His father-name in Quenya—one of Tolkien&#x27;s fictional languages—was Nolofinwë, or &quot;wise Finwë,&quot; while his mother-name was &quot;Aracáno&quot;, or &quot;High Chieftain&quot;, the same name as his youngest son Argon.

=== Strife with Fëanor ===
The mother of Fingolfin and Finarfin was Finwë&#x27;s second wife, Indis, who he married after Míriel died. While they lived in Aman, there was always strife between the sons of Indis and Míriel&#x27;s son Fëanor, mostly due to Melkor&#x27;s treachery. However, Fingolfin would seek to forge a better relationship with Fëanor at every chance. Even after Fëanor threatened him with a sword and was banished from Tirion, Fingolfin forgave him and tried to mend their relationship. This occurred very soon before destruction of the Two Trees and the Darkening of Valinor. After this event and Fëanor&#x27;s decision to leave Aman, Fingolfin chose to follow him into exile, so as not to abandon his people.

=== Crossing the ice of the Helcaraxë ===
Fingolfin led the largest host of the Noldor when they fled Aman for Middle-earth, even though he thought this unwise; he did not want to abandon his people to Fëanor. His followers participated in the Kinslaying at the Havens, but only because they arrived after the battle was underway not knowing that Fëanor was the aggressor. He led them across the ice of the Helcaraxë, an epic and arduous journey lasting many months, on which many of the people perished.

=== Challenging Morgoth at the gates of Angband ===
They arrived in Middle-earth at the first rising of the Moon, and sounded their trumpets. Soon after, at the first rising of the Sun, he came to the gates of Angband and smote upon them, but Melkor—now known as Morgoth—stayed hidden inside. Fingolfin and the Noldor then came to the northern shores of Lake Mithrim, from which the Fëanorian part of the host had withdrawn.
=== High King of the Noldor ===

Fingolfin&#x27;s son Fingon rescued Maedhros, son of Fëanor, who in gratitude waived his claim to kingship: thus, Fingolfin became High King of the Noldor. He then ruled from Hithlum, by the northern shores of Lake Mithrim.

After defeating the Orcs in the Dagor Aglareb, Fingolfin maintained the Siege of Angband for nearly 400 years. The Siege was ended by Morgoth&#x27;s sudden assaults in the Dagor Bragollach, the Battle of Sudden Flame, and many peoples of Beleriand fled.

=== Death: single combat with Morgoth ===
When Fingolfin learned of this, and received false report that his allies had been routed on all fronts, he became filled with wrath and despair. He immediately took his horse Rochallor and sword Ringil, and rode alone to Angband. All enemies fled from him, fearing his anger, and mistaking him in his fury for Oromë, the Vala patron of hunters.

Fingolfin smote the gates of Angband and challenged Morgoth to single combat. Though Morgoth feared Fingolfin (of all the Valar, Morgoth was the only one to know fear), he had to accept the challenge—or face shame in the eyes of his servants. Seven times Fingolfin wounded Morgoth and seven times Morgoth cried in pain, and seven times the host of Morgoth wailed in anguish, but he could not be slain for he was one of the Valar.

Whenever Morgoth attacked, Fingolfin avoided Morgoth&#x27;s weapon Grond, the hammer of the underworld, as it cracked the ground so violently smoke and fire darted from the craters. Eventually, however, Fingolfin grew weary and stumbled on a crater. Then Morgoth pinned Fingolfin with his foot, and killed him, but not before he, with his last act of defiance, hewed at Morgoth&#x27;s foot. Morgoth thenceforward always walked with a limp. Enraged, Morgoth sought to desecrate the body of the valiant king, but Thorondor, Lord of Eagles flew down, raked Morgoth&#x27;s eyes, and carried Fingolfin&#x27;s body away to be placed on a cliff overlooking Gondolin. Later, Fingolfin&#x27;s son Turgon built a cairn over his father&#x27;s remains.

== Artefacts ==

=== Heraldic device ===

Fingolfin is among those major characters such as Gil-galad whom Tolkien, who illustrated his own writings, supplied with a distinct heraldic device. Like his brother Finarfin&#x27;s device, it has eight points that reach the edge of its lozenge, denoting a High King, and a central circle; it differs from Finarfin&#x27;s in having a second concentric circle. Its colours are like those for his father Finwë&#x27;s device, but as the Tolkien scholars Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull note, its eight curling points are more like those of Fëanor&#x27;s. They write that the device&#x27;s motif of small silver stars on a blue field is presumably related to his shield, which Tolkien described as &quot;with field of heaven&#x27;s blue and star / of crystal shining pale afar&quot;. Catherine McIlwaine, who curated the Bodleian Library exhibition of his artwork, wrote that Tolkien liked to create decorative patterns, leading up to pattern-based designs such as a carpet from Númenor. In her view, his creation of heraldic devices for characters in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; was a more deliberate form of the same impulse. Among &quot;the loveliest of these kaleidoscopic patterns&quot;, wrote McIlwaine, were the devices for Fingolfin and his brother Finarfin.

=== Family tree ===

The family tree shows that Fingolfin is half Noldor, from his father Finwë, and half Vanyar, from his mother Indis. Among his descendants are Gil-galad, Eärendil, and Elrond. His half-brother Fëanor is pure Noldor, by Finwë&#x27;s other wife Miriel. The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey writes that in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, as in Norse tradition and sagas, people are defined by their ancestry. The Vanyar are the senior division of the Elves; so Fëanor&#x27;s fourth son Caranthir is quite wrong to treat his father&#x27;s half-brothers Finarfin and Fingolfin with contempt, something that was both dangerous and ill-founded. Shippey states that Caranthir&#x27;s scornful words could be said to have set in motion the events which led to the ruin of Doriath.

== Analysis ==

The Tolkien scholar Megan Fontenot, on Tor.com, writes that mental images of Fingolfin are &quot;unforgettable&quot;: his ride across Dor-nu-Fauglith to the gates of Morgoth&#x27;s fortress of Angband, or the image of him &quot;pounding upon the great gates of the dark fortress, blowing great blasts upon a silver horn, demanding that Morgoth show his face and join him in single combat.&quot; She notes that Fingolfin&#x27;s origins are hard to trace through the complex history of Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium. He is absent from the earliest Fëanor stories in &quot;The Book of Lost Tales&quot;, and that in Tolkien&#x27;s many drafts, such as in &quot;The Lays of Beleriand&quot;, Fingolfin has several different fathers and siblings; further, his name is temporarily assigned to various other characters. Fontenot traces him to a character named Golfin, a prince of the &quot;Gnomes&quot; (Elves) in &quot;The Shaping of Middle-earth&quot;, created before 1926. Not long afterwards, in &quot;The Lay of the Fall of Gondolin&quot; and &quot;The Lay of the Children of Húrin&quot;, he becomes the son of Finwë/Finn and the father of Turgon. It was not until the 1950s, however, that Tolkien finally made Fingolfin the half-brother of Fëanor. 

Gregory Hartley, in &quot;Christianity &amp; Literature&quot;, notes that Fingolfin gleams below Morgoth&#x27;s shadow &quot;as a star&quot;, and avoids Morgoth&#x27;s strikes &quot;as a lightning shoots from under a dark cloud&quot;. Hartley interprets the Christian Tolkien to mean by this an increase in power equivalent to what the New Testament calls being filled with the Holy Spirit. In his view, the imagery and the increase in Fingolfin&#x27;s strength &quot;suggest that the Secret Fire has taken possession of him; that perhaps he is no longer merely the King of the Noldor but a chosen instrument of the Valar&quot;, the gods of Arda.

The Tolkien scholar B. S. W. Barootes writes that in Tolkien&#x27;s mythology, oaths are &quot;a powerful form of performative language in Middle-earth&quot;. He states that they consistently lead to &quot;trouble, pain, and sorrow&quot;, giving as prime example the oath of Fëanor, but also mentioning Finrod&#x27;s oath of service to Barahir&#x27;s kin, Beren&#x27;s oath to Thingol, and the broken oath of the Dead of Dunharrow, who are ultimately redeemed when they choose to serve Aragorn as he returns to claim his kingdom. Fingolfin&#x27;s oath to follow Fëanor back to Middle-earth means his own exile from the blessed realm of Valinor, and his own death.

== Legacy ==

Fingolfin has inspired musicians and artists to create materials about his actions. The song &quot;Time Stands Still (At the Iron Hill)&quot;, on the German power-metal band Blind Guardian&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;Nightfall in Middle-Earth&quot;, tells the story of the fight between Morgoth and Fingolfin. Austin Gilkeson wrote that &quot;So metal was Fingolfin’s challenge that Morgoth had no choice but to accept.&quot; The song (in Russian) &quot;Do Not Ask Me To Praise Him&quot; [Ты славить его меня не проси] by Aire and Saruman [Айрэ и Саруман] on their album &quot;A Elberet[h] Gilt[h]oniel&quot; [А Элберет Гилтониэль] is a lament for Fingolfin by his minstrel some time after that last battle: &#x27;... do not ask me to praise him, the day won&#x27;t be brighter for a candle...&#x27;. Fantasy artists have painted illustrations of Fingolfin&#x27;s actions. Ted Nasmith and Jenny Dolfen have portrayed him leading his people across the ice of the Helcaraxë. Dolfen has illustrated various other scenes from his life, including Fëanor&#x27;s threatening of Fingolfin, Fingolfin&#x27;s ride to Angband, and his final fight with Morgoth. Artists including John Howe and Pete Amachree have depicted Fingolfin challenging Morgoth at the gates of Angband.

<text>Lee Oscar Lawrie (October 16, 1877 – January 23, 1963) was an American architectural sculptor and an important figure in the American sculpture scene preceding World War II. Over his long career of more than 300 commissions Lawrie&#x27;s style evolved through Modern Gothic, to Beaux-Arts, Classicism, and, finally, into &quot;Moderne&quot; or Art Deco.

He created a frieze on the Nebraska State Capitol building in Lincoln, Nebraska, including a portrayal of the announcement of the Emancipation Proclamation. He also created some of the architectural sculpture and his most prominent work, the free-standing bronze &quot; Atlas&quot; (installed 1937) at New York City&#x27;s Rockefeller Center.

Lawrie&#x27;s work is associated with some of the United States&#x27; most noted buildings of the first half of the twentieth century. His stylistic approach evolved with building styles that ranged from Beaux-Arts to neo-Gothic to Art Deco. Many of his architectural sculptures were completed for buildings by Bertram Goodhue of Cram &amp; Goodhue, including the chapel at West Point; the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C.; the Nebraska State Capitol; the Los Angeles Public Library; St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Episcopal Church in New York; Cornell Law School in Ithaca, New York; and Rockefeller Chapel at the University of Chicago. He completed numerous pieces in Washington, D.C., including the bronze doors of the John Adams Building of the Library of Congress, the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception south entrance portal, and the interior sculpture of George Washington at the National Cathedral.

==Early work==
Lee Lawrie was born in Rixdorf, Germany, in 1877 and immigrated to the United States in 1882 as a young child with his family; they settled in Chicago. It was there, at the age of 14, that he began working for the sculptor Richard Henry Park.

At the age of 15, in 1892 Lawrie worked as an assistant to many of the sculptors in Chicago, for their part in constructing the &quot;White City&quot; for the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition of 1893. Following the completion of that work, Lawrie went East, where he became an assistant to William Ordway Partridge. During the next decade, he worked with other established sculptors: Augustus Saint-Gaudens, Philip Martiny, Alexander Phimister Proctor, John William Kitson and others. His work at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, St Louis, 1904, under Karl Bitter, the foremost architectural sculptor of the time, allowed Lawrie to develop both his skills and his reputation as an architectural sculptor.

Lawrie received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in fine arts from Yale University in 1910. He was an instructor in Yale&#x27;s School of Fine Arts from 1908 to 1919 and taught in the architecture program at Harvard University from 1910 to 1912.

==Collaborations with Cram and Goodhue==
Lawrie&#x27;s collaborations with Ralph Adams Cram and Bertram Goodhue brought him to the forefront of architectural sculptors in the United States. After the breakup of the Cram, Goodhue firm in 1914, Lawrie continued to work with Goodhue until the architect died in 1924. He next worked with Goodhue&#x27;s successors.

Lawrie sculpted numerous bas reliefs for El Fureidis, an estate in Montecito, California designed by Goodhue. The bas reliefs depict the Arthurian Legends and remain intact at the estate today.

The Nebraska State Capitol and the Los Angeles Public Library both feature extensive sculptural programs integrated with the surface, massing, spatial grammar, and social function of the building. Lawrie&#x27;s collaborations with Goodhue are arguably the most highly developed example of architectural sculpture in American architectural history.

Lawrie served as a consultant to the 1933-34 Century of Progress International Exposition in Chicago. He was a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters, the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the National Academy of Design, and the Architectural League of New York. Among his many awards was the AIA Gold Medal of the American Institute of Architects in 1921 and 1927, a medal of honor from the Architectural League of New York in 1931, and an honorary degree from Yale University. He served on the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts in Washington, DC from 1933 to 1937 and again from 1945 to 1950; it oversees federal public works and artwork in the city.

A bust of Lawrie was sculpted Joseph Kiselewski. The Academy Art Museum in Easton, Maryland likely commissioned Kiselewski to do the bust. Lawrie was a co-founder of the museum. Kiselewski worked with Lawrie in the early years of his career prior to going to France to study.

==Commissions after Goodhue&#x27;s death==
=== Rockefeller Center ===

After Goodhue&#x27;s death, Lawrie produced important and highly visible work under Raymond Hood at Rockefeller Center in New York City, which included the &quot;Atlas&quot; in collaboration with Rene Paul Chambellan. By November 1931 Hood said, &quot;There has been entirely too much talk about the collaboration of architect, painter and sculptor.&quot; He relegated Lawrie to the role of a decorator.

Lawrie&#x27;s most noted work is not architectural: it is the freestanding statue of Atlas, on Fifth Avenue at Rockefeller Center, standing a total 45 feet tall, with a 15-foot human figure supporting an armillary sphere. At its unveiling, some critics were reminded of Benito Mussolini, while James Montgomery Flagg suggested that it looked as Mussolini &quot;thought&quot; he looked. The international character of Streamline Moderne, embraced by Fascism as well as corporate democracy, lost favor during the Second World War.

Featured above the entrance to 30 Rockefeller Plaza and axially behind the golden Prometheus, Lawrie&#x27;s &quot;Wisdom&quot; is one of the most visible works of art in the complex. An Art Deco piece, it echoes the statements of power shown in &quot;Atlas&quot; and Paul Manship&#x27;s &quot;Prometheus&quot;.

<text>The Fokker D.VII is a German World War I fighter aircraft designed by Reinhold Platz of the Fokker-Flugzeugwerke. Germany produced around 3,300 D.VII aircraft in the second half of 1918. In service with the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot;, the D.VII quickly proved itself to be a formidable aircraft. The Armistice ending the war , that Germany was required to surrender all D.VIIs to the Allies. Surviving aircraft saw much service with many countries in the years after World War I.

Fokker&#x27;s chief designer, Reinhold Platz, had been working on a series of experimental V-series aircraft, starting in 1916. The aircraft were notable for the use of cantilever wings. Hugo Junkers and his aviation firm had originated the idea in 1915 with the first practical all-metal aircraft, the Junkers J 1 monoplane, nicknamed &quot;Blechesel&quot; (Sheet Metal Donkey or Tin Donkey). The wings were thick, with a rounded leading edge. The shape of the wings&#x27; airfoil gave greater lift, with its relatively &quot;blunt&quot; leading edge (as seen in cross-section) giving it more docile stalling behavior than the thin wings commonly in use.
Late in 1917, Fokker built the experimental V 11 biplane, fitted with the standard Mercedes D.IIIa engine. In January 1918, &quot;Idflieg&quot; held a fighter competition at Adlershof. For the first time, front line pilots participated in the evaluation and selection of new fighters. Fokker submitted the V 11 along with several other prototypes. Manfred von Richthofen flew the V 11 and found it tricky, unpleasant and directionally unstable in a dive. Platz lengthened the rear fuselage by one structural bay and added a triangular fin in front of the rudder. Richthofen tested the modified V 11 and praised it as the best aircraft of the competition. It offered excellent performance from the outdated Mercedes engine, yet was safe and easy to fly. Richthofen&#x27;s recommendation virtually decided the competition, but he was not alone in recommending it. Fokker immediately received a provisional order for 400 production aircraft, which were named D.VII by &quot;Idflieg&quot;.


Fokker&#x27;s factory was not up to the task of meeting all D.VII production orders and &quot;Idflieg&quot; directed Albatros and AEG to build the D.VII under license, though AEG did not ultimately produce any aircraft. Because the Fokker factory did not use detailed plans as part of its production process, Fokker simply sent a D.VII airframe for Albatros to copy. Albatros paid Fokker a five percent royalty for every D.VII it built under license. Albatros Flugzeugwerke and its subsidiary, Ostdeutsche Albatros Werke (OAW), built the D.VII at factories in Johannisthal [Fokker D.VII (Alb)] and Schneidemühl [Fokker D.VII (OAW)] respectively. Aircraft markings included the type designation and factory suffix, immediately before the individual serial number.

Some parts were not interchangeable between aircraft produced at different factories, even between Albatros and OAW. Each manufacturer tended to differ in both nose paint styles and the patterning and layout of their engine compartment cooling louvers on the sides of the nose. OAW produced examples were delivered with distinctive mauve and green splotches on the cowling. All D.VIIs were produced with either the five-color &quot;Fünffarbiger&quot; or less often, the four-color &quot;Vierfarbiger&quot; lozenge camouflage covering, except for early Fokker-produced D.VIIs, which had a streaked green fuselage. Factory camouflage finishes were often overpainted with colorful paint schemes or insignia for the &quot;Jasta&quot; or for a pilot.

In September 1918, eight D.VIIs were delivered to Bulgaria. Late in 1918, the Austro-Hungarian company &quot;Magyar Általános Gépgyár&quot; (&quot;MÁG&quot;, Hungarian General Machine Company) commenced licensed production of the D.VII with Austro-Daimler engines. Production continued after the end of the war, with as many as 50 aircraft completed.

===Powerplants===
The earliest production D.VIIs were equipped with 170–180 hp Mercedes D.IIIa. Production quickly switched to the intended standard engine, the higher-compression 134 kW (180–200 hp) Mercedes D.IIIaü. Some early production D.VIIs delivered with the Mercedes D.IIIa were later re-engined with the D.IIIaü.

By mid-1918, some D.VIIs received the &quot;overcompressed&quot; 138 kW (185 hp) BMW IIIa, the first product of the BMW firm. The BMW IIIa followed the SOHC, straight-six configuration of the Mercedes D.III but incorporated several improvements. Increased displacement, higher compression and an altitude-adjusting carburettor produced a marked increase in speed and climb rate at high altitude. Because the BMW IIIa was overcompressed, using full throttle at altitudes below risked premature detonation in the cylinders and damage to the engine. At low altitudes, full throttle could produce up to 179 kW (240 hp) for a short time. Fokker-built aircraft with the new BMW engine were called D.VII(F), the suffix &quot;F&quot; standing for Max Friz, the engine designer.

BMW-engined aircraft entered service with &quot;Jasta&quot; 11 in late June 1918. Pilots clamored for the D.VII(F), of which about 750 were built. Production of the BMW IIIa was limited and the D.VII continued to be produced with the 134 kW (180 hp) Mercedes D.IIIaü until the end of the war.

D.VIIs flew with different propeller designs from different manufacturers. Despite the variations there is no indication these propellers gave disparate performance. Axial, Wolff, Wotan, and Heine propellers have been noted.

==Operational history==
===World War I===


When the Fokker D.VII entered squadron service with &quot;Jasta&quot; 10 in early May 1918, Allied pilots at first underestimated the new fighter because of its squarish, ungainly appearance. However, their experiences in combat quickly forced them to revise their view. The type quickly proved to have many important advantages over the Albatros and Pfalz scouts. Unlike the Albatros scouts, the D.VII could dive without any fear of structural failure. The D.VII was also noted for its high manoeuvrability and ability to climb, its remarkably docile stall and reluctance to spin. It could &quot;hang on its prop&quot; without stalling for brief periods of time, spraying enemy aircraft from below with machine gun fire. These handling characteristics contrasted with contemporary scouts such as the Camel and SPAD, which stalled sharply and spun vigorously.

Several aircraft suffered rib failures and fabric shedding on the upper wing. Heat from the engine sometimes ignited phosphorus ammunition until additional cooling louvers were installed on the metal sides of the engine cowling panels and fuel tanks sometimes broke at the seams. Aircraft built by the Fokker factory at Schwerin were noted for their lower standard of workmanship and materials. Despite faults, the D.VII proved to be a remarkably successful design, leading to the familiar aphorism that it could turn a mediocre pilot into a good one and a good pilot into an ace.

Richthofen died days before the D.VII began to reach the &quot;Jagdstaffeln&quot; and never flew it in combat. Other pilots, including Erich Löwenhardt and Hermann Göring, quickly racked up victories and generally lauded the design. Aircraft availability was limited at first, but by July there were 407 in service. Larger numbers became available by August, by which point D.VIIs had achieved 565 victories. The D.VII eventually equipped 46 &quot;Jagdstaffeln&quot;. When the war ended in November, 775 D.VII aircraft were in service.

===Post-war service===
The Allies confiscated large numbers of D.VII aircraft after the Armistice. The United States Army and Navy evaluated 142 captured examples. Several of these aircraft were re-engined with American-built Liberty L-6 motors, very similar in appearance to the D.VII&#x27;s original German power plants. France, Great Britain and Canada also received numbers of war prizes.

Other countries used the D.VII operationally. The Polish deployed approximately 50 aircraft during the Polish-Soviet War, using them mainly for ground attack missions. The Hungarian Soviet Republic used a number of D.VIIs, both built by MAG and ex-German aircraft in the Hungarian–Romanian War of 1919.

The Dutch, Swiss, and Belgian air forces also operated the D.VII. The aircraft proved so popular that Anthony Fokker completed and sold a large number of D.VII airframes that he had smuggled into the Netherlands by rail after the Armistice. As late as 1929, the Alfred Comte company manufactured eight new D.VII airframes under license for the Swiss &quot;Fliegertruppe&quot;.

==Reproductions==
Many modern D.VII reproductions have been built. Most flyable examples are powered by 7.2 litre (440 cu. in.) American Ranger, or 9.2 litre (560 cu. in.) displacement British Gipsy Queen inverted-six cylinder inline engines, both of which are substantially smaller in displacement than either the Mercedes or BMW engines that powered wartime D.VIIs. A few flying reproductions, such as the one at New York State&#x27;s Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome, are equipped with original Mercedes D.IIIa engines.

<doc id="160640" wikidata="Q483512" url="?curid=160640" title="Isadora Duncan">
<text>Angela Isadora Duncan (May 26, 1877, or May 27, 1878 – September 14, 1927) was an American-born dancer and choreographer, who was a pioneer of modern contemporary dance and performed to great acclaim throughout Europe and the United States. Born and raised in California, she lived and danced in Western Europe, the U.S., and Soviet Russia from the age of 22. She died when her scarf became entangled in the wheel and axle of the car in which she was travelling in Nice, France.

== Early life ==
Angela Isadora Duncan was born in San Francisco, the youngest of the four children of Joseph Charles Duncan (1819–1898), a banker, mining engineer and connoisseur of the arts, and Mary Isadora Gray (1849–1922). Her brothers were Augustin Duncan and Raymond Duncan; her sister, Elizabeth Duncan, was also a dancer. Soon after Isadora&#x27;s birth, her father was found to have been using funds from two banks he had helped set up to finance his private stock speculations. Although he avoided prison time, Isadora&#x27;s mother (angered over his infidelities as well as the financial scandal) divorced him, and from then on the family struggled with poverty. Joseph Duncan, along with his third wife and their daughter, died in 1898 when the British passenger steamer SS &quot;Mohegan&quot; ran aground off the coast of Cornwall.

After her parents&#x27; divorce, Isadora&#x27;s mother moved with her family to Oakland, California, where she worked as a seamstress and piano teacher. Isadora attended school from the ages of six to ten, but she dropped out, having found it constricting. She and her three siblings earned money by teaching dance to local children.

In 1896, Duncan became part of Augustin Daly&#x27;s theater company in New York, but she soon became disillusioned with the form and craved a different environment with less of a hierarchy.

== Work ==

Duncan&#x27;s novel approach to dance had been evident since the classes she had taught as a teenager, where she &quot;followed [her] fantasy and improvised, teaching any pretty thing that came into [her] head&quot;. A desire to travel brought her to Chicago, where she auditioned for many theater companies, finally finding a place in Augustin Daly&#x27;s company. This took her to New York City where her unique vision of dance clashed with the popular pantomimes of theater companies. While in New York, Duncan also took some classes with Marie Bonfanti but was quickly disappointed by ballet routine.

Feeling unhappy and unappreciated in America, Duncan moved to London in 1898. She performed in the drawing rooms of the wealthy, taking inspiration from the Greek vases and bas-reliefs in the British Museum. The earnings from these engagements enabled her to rent a studio, allowing her to develop her work and create larger performances for the stage. From London, she traveled to Paris, where she was inspired by the Louvre and the Exposition Universelle of 1900 and danced in the salons of Marguerite de Saint-Marceaux and Princesse Edmond de Polignac. In France, as elsewhere, Duncan delighted her audience.

In 1902, Loie Fuller invited Duncan to tour with her. This took Duncan all over Europe as she created new works using her innovative technique, which emphasized natural movement in contrast to the rigidity of traditional ballet. She spent most of the rest of her life touring Europe and the Americas in this fashion. Despite mixed reaction from critics, Duncan became quite popular for her distinctive style and inspired many visual artists, such as Antoine Bourdelle, Dame Laura Knight, Auguste Rodin, Arnold Rönnebeck, André Dunoyer de Segonzac, and Abraham Walkowitz, to create works based on her.

In 1910, Duncan met the occultist Aleister Crowley at a party, an episode recounted by Crowley in his &quot;Confessions&quot;. He refers to Duncan as &quot;Lavinia King&quot;, and used the same invented name for her in his 1929 novel &quot;Moonchild&quot; (written in 1917). Crowley wrote of Duncan that she &quot;has this gift of gesture in a very high degree. Let the reader study her dancing, if possible in private than in public, and learn the superb &#x27;unconsciousness&#x27; – which is magical consciousness – with which she suits the action to the melody.&quot; Crowley was, in fact, more attracted to Duncan&#x27;s bohemian companion Mary Dempsey ( Mary D&#x27;Este or Desti), with whom he had an affair. Desti had come to Paris in 1901 where she soon met Duncan, and the two became inseparable. Desti, who also appeared in &quot;Moonchild&quot; (as &quot;Lisa la Giuffria&quot;) and became a member of Crowley&#x27;s occult order, later wrote a memoir of her experiences with Duncan.

In 1911, the French fashion designer Paul Poiret rented a mansion – Pavillon du Butard in La Celle-Saint-Cloud – and threw lavish parties, including one of the more famous &quot;grandes fêtes&quot;, &quot;La fête de Bacchus&quot; on June 20, 1912, re-creating the Bacchanalia hosted by Louis XIV at Versailles. Isadora Duncan, wearing a Greek evening gown designed by Poiret, danced on tables among 300 guests; 900 bottles of champagne were consumed until the first light of day.
===Opening schools of dance===
Duncan disliked the commercial aspects of public performance, such as touring and contracts, because she felt they distracted her from her real mission, namely the creation of beauty and the education of the young. To achieve her mission, she opened schools to teach young girls her philosophy of dance. The first was established in 1904 in Berlin-Grunewald, Germany. This institution was in existence for three years and was the birthplace of the &quot;Isadorables&quot; (Anna, Maria-Theresa, Irma, Liesel, Gretel, and Erika), Duncan optimistically dreamed her school would train “thousands of young dancing maidens” in non-professional community dance. It was a boarding school that in addition to a regular education, also taught dance but the students were not expected or even encouraged to be professional dancers. Duncan did not legally adopt all six girls as is commonly believed. Nevertheless, three of them (Irma, Anna and Lisa) would use the Duncan surname for the rest of their lives. After about a decade in Berlin, Duncan established a school in Paris that soon closed because of the outbreak of World War I.

In 1914, Duncan moved to the United States and transferred her school there. A townhouse on Gramercy Park in New York was provided for its use, and its studio was nearby, on the northeast corner of 23rd Street and Fourth Avenue (now Park Avenue South). Otto Kahn, the head of Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co., gave Duncan use of the very modern Century Theatre at West 60th Street and Central Park West for her performances and productions, which included a staging of &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; that involved almost all of Duncan&#x27;s extended entourage and friends. During her time in New York, Duncan posed for studies by the photographer Arnold Genthe.

Duncan had planned to leave the United States in 1915 aboard the RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot; on its ill-fated voyage, but historians believe her financial situation at the time drove her to choose a more modest crossing. In 1921, Duncan&#x27;s leftist sympathies took her to the Soviet Union, where she founded a school in Moscow. However, the Soviet government&#x27;s failure to follow through on promises to support her work caused her to return to the West and leave the school to her protégée Irma. In 1924, Duncan composed a dance routine called &quot;Varshavianka&quot; to the tune of the Polish revolutionary song known in English as &quot;Whirlwinds of Danger&quot;.

== Philosophy and technique ==
Breaking with convention, Duncan imagined she had traced dance to its roots as a sacred art. She developed from this notion a style of free and natural movements inspired by the classical Greek arts, folk dances, social dances, nature, and natural forces, as well as an approach to the new American athleticism which included skipping, running, jumping, leaping, and tossing. Duncan wrote of American dancing: &quot;let them come forth with great strides, leaps and bounds, with lifted forehead and far-spread arms, to dance.&quot; Her focus on natural movement emphasized steps, such as skipping, outside of codified ballet technique.

Duncan also cited the sea as an early inspiration for her movement, and she believed movement originated from the solar plexus. Duncan placed an emphasis on &quot;evolutionary&quot; dance motion, insisting that each movement was born from the one that preceded it, that each movement gave rise to the next, and so on in organic succession. It is this philosophy and new dance technique that garnered Duncan the title of the creator of modern dance.

Duncan&#x27;s philosophy of dance moved away from rigid ballet technique and towards what she perceived as natural movement. She said that in order to restore dance to a high art form instead of merely entertainment, she strove to connect emotions and movement: &quot;I spent long days and nights in the studio seeking that dance which might be the divine expression of the human spirit through the medium of the body&#x27;s movement.&quot; She believed dance was meant to encircle all that life had to offer—joy and sadness. Duncan took inspiration from ancient Greece and combined it with a passion for freedom of movement. This is exemplified in her revolutionary costume of a white Greek tunic and bare feet. Inspired by Greek forms, her tunics also allowed a freedom of movement that corseted ballet costumes and pointe shoes did not. Costumes were not the only inspiration Duncan took from Greece: she was also inspired by ancient Greek art, and utilized some of its forms in her movement (as shown on photos).

== Personal life ==

===Children===

Duncan bore three children, all out of wedlock. Deirdre Beatrice was born September 24, 1906. Her father was theatre designer Gordon Craig. Patrick Augustus was born May 1, 1910, fathered by Paris Singer, one of the many sons of sewing machine magnate Isaac Singer. Deirdre and Patrick both died by drowning in 1913. While out on a car ride with their nanny, the automobile accidentally went into the River Seine. Following this tragedy, Duncan spent several months on the Greek island of Corfu with her brother and sister, then several weeks at the Viareggio seaside resort in Italy with actress Eleonora Duse.

In her autobiography, Duncan relates that in her deep despair over the deaths of her children, she begged a young Italian stranger, the sculptor Romano Romanelli, to sleep with her because she was desperate for another child. She gave birth to a son on August 13, 1914, but he died shortly after birth.

===Relationships===

When Duncan stayed at the Viareggio seaside resort with Eleonora Duse, Duse had just left a relationship with the rebellious and epicene young feminist Lina Poletti. This fueled speculation as to the nature of Duncan and Duse&#x27;s relationship, but there has never been any indication that the two were involved romantically.

Duncan was loving by nature and was close to her mother, siblings and all of her male and female friends. Later on, in 1921, after the end of the Russian Revolution, Duncan moved to Moscow, where she met the poet Sergei Yesenin, who was eighteen years her junior. On May 2, 1922, they married, and Yesenin accompanied her on a tour of Europe and the United States. However, the marriage was brief as they grew apart while getting to know each other. In May 1923, Yesenin returned to Moscow. Two years later, on December 28, 1925, he was found dead in his room in the Hotel Angleterre in Leningrad (formerly St Petersburg and Petrograd), in an apparent suicide.

Duncan also had a relationship with the poet and playwright Mercedes de Acosta, as documented in numerous revealing letters they wrote to each other. In one, Duncan wrote, &quot;Mercedes, lead me with your little strong hands and I will follow you – to the top of a mountain. To the end of the world. Wherever you wish.&quot;

However, the claim of a purported relationship made after Duncan’s death by de Acosta (a controversial figure for her alleged relations) is in dispute. Friends and relatives of Duncan believed her claim is false based on forged letters and done for publicity’s sake. In addition, Lily Dikovskaya, one of Duncan’s students from her Moscow School, wrote in &quot;In Isadora’s Steps&quot; that Duncan “was focused on higher things”.

=== Later years ===
By the late 1920s, Duncan, in her late 40s, was depressed by the deaths of her three young children. She spent her final years financially struggling, moving between Paris and the Mediterranean, running up debts at hotels. Her autobiography &quot;My Life&quot; was published in 1927 shortly after her death. The Australian composer Percy Grainger called it a &quot;life-enriching masterpiece.&quot; 

In his book &quot;Isadora, An Intimate Portrait&quot;, Sewell Stokes, who met Duncan in the last years of her life, described her extravagant waywardness. In a reminiscent sketch, Zelda Fitzgerald wrote how she and her husband, author F. Scott Fitzgerald, sat in a Paris cafe watching a somewhat drunken Duncan. He would speak of how memorable it was, but all that Zelda recalled was that while all eyes were watching Duncan, she was able to steal the salt and pepper shakers from the table.

== Death ==

On September 14, 1927, in Nice, France, Duncan was a passenger in an Amilcar CGSS automobile owned by , a French-Italian mechanic. She wore a long, flowing, hand-painted silk scarf, created by the Russian-born artist Roman Chatov, a gift from her friend Mary Desti, the mother of American filmmaker Preston Sturges. Desti, who saw Duncan off, had asked her to wear a cape in the open-air vehicle because of the cold weather, but she would agree to wear only the scarf. As they departed, she reportedly said to Desti and some companions, &quot; &quot; (&quot;Farewell, my friends. I go to glory!&quot;); but according to the American novelist Glenway Wescott, Desti later told him that Duncan&#x27;s actual parting words were, (&quot;I am off to love&quot;). Desti considered this embarrassing, as it suggested that she and Falchetto were going to her hotel for a tryst.

Her silk scarf, draped around her neck, became entangled in the wheel well around the open-spoked wheels and rear axle, pulling her from the open car and breaking her neck. Desti said she called out to warn Duncan about the scarf almost immediately after the car left. Desti took Duncan to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead.

As &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted in its obituary, Duncan &quot;met a tragic death at Nice on the Riviera&quot;. &quot;According to dispatches from Nice, Duncan was hurled in an extraordinary manner from an open automobile in which she was riding and instantly killed by the force of her fall to the stone pavement.&quot; Other sources noted that she was almost decapitated by the sudden tightening of the scarf around her neck. The accident gave rise to Gertrude Stein&#x27;s remark that &quot;affectations can be dangerous&quot;. At the time of her death, Duncan was a Soviet citizen. Her will was the first of a Soviet citizen to undergo probate in the U.S.

Duncan was cremated, and her ashes were placed next to those of her children in the columbarium at Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. On the headstone of her grave is inscribed &quot;École du Ballet de l&#x27;Opéra de Paris&quot; (&quot;Ballet School of the Opera of Paris&quot;).

== Legacy ==

Duncan is known as &quot;The Mother of Dance&quot;. While her schools in Europe did not last long, Duncan&#x27;s work had an impact on the art and her style is still danced based upon the instruction of Maria-Theresa Duncan, Anna Duncan, and Irma Duncan, three of her six pupils. Through her sister, Elizabeth, Duncan&#x27;s approach was adopted by Jarmila Jeřábková from Prague where her legacy persists. By 1913 she was already being celebrated. When the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées was built, Duncan&#x27;s likeness was carved in its &quot;bas-relief&quot; over the entrance by sculptor Antoine Bourdelle and included in painted murals of the nine muses by Maurice Denis in the auditorium. In 1987, she was inducted into the National Museum of Dance and Hall of Fame.

Anna, Lisa, Theresa and Irma, pupils of Isadora Duncan&#x27;s first school, carried on the aesthetic and pedagogical principles of Isadora&#x27;s work in New York and Paris. Choreographer and dancer Julia Levien was also instrumental in furthering Duncan&#x27;s work through the formation of the Duncan Dance Guild in the 1950s and the establishment of the Duncan Centenary Company in 1977.

Another means by which Duncan&#x27;s dance techniques were carried forth was in the formation of the Isadora Duncan Heritage Society, by Mignon Garland, who had been taught dance by two of Duncan&#x27;s key students. Garland was such a fan that she later lived in a building erected at the same site and address as Duncan, attached a commemorative plaque near the entrance, which is still there . Garland also succeeded in having San Francisco rename an alley on the same block from Adelaide Place to Isadora Duncan Lane.

In medicine, the Isadora Duncan Syndrome refers to injury or death consequent to entanglement of neckwear with a wheel or other machinery.

<doc id="160649" wikidata="Q383003" url="?curid=160649" title="Nikephoros Bryennios the Younger">
<text>Nikephoros Bryennios (or Nicephorus Bryennius; Greek: Νικηφόρος Βρυέννιος, &quot;Nikēphoros Bryennios; &quot;1062/82–1137) was a Byzantine general, statesman and historian. He was born at Orestias (Adrianople) in the theme of Macedonia.

==Life==
The Bryennios family were prominent in the city of Adrianople where they were locally powerful. His father (or possibly grandfather), of the same name, the governor of the theme of Dyrrhachium, had revolted against the feeble Michael VII, but had been defeated by the future Emperor Alexios I Komnenos. The son, who was distinguished for his learning, personal beauty, and engaging qualities, gained the favour of Alexios I and the hand of his daughter Anna Komnene, receiving the titles of &quot;Caesar&quot; and &quot;panhypersebastos&quot; (one of the new dignities introduced by Alexios). The marriage of Nikephoros the Younger was probably arranged during the Cuman War of 1094, when Alexios needed the support of the Bryennios family and their abilities to mobilise the military potential of Thrace. The marriage took place two years later.

Bryennios successfully defended the walls of Constantinople against the attacks of Godfrey of Bouillon during the First Crusade (1097). This was more of a demonstration than a serious conflict, as the Byzantine defenders were ordered to shoot the Crusaders&#x27; horses, to avoid killing Christians on a holy day. He conducted the peace negotiations between Alexios and Prince Bohemond I of Antioch resulting in the Treaty of Devol of 1108. Byennios played an important part in the defeat of Melikshah, the Seljuq Sultan of Rûm, at the Battle of Philomelion (1117), where he led a cavalry charge which almost captured the Sultan.

After the death of Alexios, he refused to enter into the conspiracy set afoot by his mother-in-law Irene Doukaina and his wife Anna to depose John II Komnenos, the son of Alexios, and raise him to the throne. His wife attributed his refusal to cowardice, but it seems from certain passages in his own work that he really regarded it as a crime to revolt against the rightful heir; the only reproach that can be brought against him is that he did not nip the conspiracy in the bud. He was on very friendly terms with the new emperor, John II, whom he accompanied, as a senior commander, on his repeated Anatolian campaigns. During the Syrian campaign (1137), he became ill and was forced to return to Constantinople, where he died in the same year.

==Family==
By his wife Anna Komnene, the &quot;kaisar&quot; Nikephoros Bryennios had several children, including:
# Alexios Bryennios Komnenos, &quot;megas doux&quot;, –c. 1161/1167
# John Doukas, c. 1103–after 1173
# Eirene Doukaina, c. 1105–?
# Maria Bryennaina Komnene, c. 1107–?

==Writings==
At the suggestion of his mother-in-law, he wrote a history (&quot;Material for a History&quot;, ) of the period from 1057 to 1081, from the victory of Isaac I Komnenos over Michael VI to the dethronement of Nikephoros III Botaneiates by Alexios I. The work has been described as a family chronicle rather than a history, the object of which was the glorification of the house of Komnenos. Part of the introduction is probably a later addition.

In addition to information derived from older contemporaries (such as his father and father-in-law), Bryennios made use of the works of Michael Psellos, John Skylitzes and Michael Attaleiates. As might be expected, his views are biased by personal considerations and his intimacy with the royal family, which at the same time, however, afforded him unusual facilities for obtaining material. His model was Xenophon, whom he has imitated with a tolerable measure of success; he abstained from an excessive use of simile and metaphor, and his style is concise and simple. He has also been credited with drawing inspiration from the Greek historians of Republican Rome. He died in 1137 before finishing the work. The extent to which his wife&#x27;s history, &quot;The Alexiad&quot;, draws on the second volume of Bryennios&#x27; work, is moot.

<text>The Fokker Scourge (Fokker Scare) occurred during the First World War from July 1915 to early 1916. Imperial German Flying Corps () units, equipped with (Fokker monoplane) fighters, gained an advantage over the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and the French .

The Fokker was the first service aircraft to be fitted with a machine gun synchronised to fire through the arc of the propeller without striking the blades. The tactical advantage of aiming the gun by aiming the aircraft and the surprise of its introduction were factors in its success.

This period of German air superiority ended with the arrival in numbers of the French Nieuport 11 and British Airco DH.2 fighters, which were capable of challenging the Fokkers, although the last Fokkers were not finally replaced until August–September 1916.

The term &quot;Fokker Scourge&quot; was coined by the British press in mid-1916, after the had been outclassed by the new Allied types. Use of the term coincided with a political campaign to end a perceived dominance of the Royal Aircraft Factory in the supply of aircraft to the Royal Flying Corps, a campaign that was begun by the pioneering aviation journalist C. G. Grey and Noel Pemberton Billing M.P., founder of Pemberton-Billing Ltd (Supermarine from 1916) and a great enthusiast for aerial warfare.

As aerial warfare developed, the Allies gained a lead over the Germans by introducing machine-gun armed types such as the Vickers F.B.5 Gunbus fighter and the Morane-Saulnier L. By early 1915, the German (OHL, Supreme Army Command) had ordered the development of machine-gun-armed aircraft to counter those of the Allies. The new &quot;C&quot; class, armed two-seaters and twin-engined &quot;K&quot; (later &quot;G&quot;) class aircraft such as the AEG G.I were attached in ones and twos to (FFA) artillery-observation and reconnaissance detachments for &quot;fighter&quot; sorties, mostly the escort of unarmed aircraft.

On 18 April 1915, the Morane-Saulnier L of Roland Garros was captured, after he was forced to land behind the German lines. From 1April, Garros had destroyed three German aircraft in the Morane, which carried a machine-gun firing through the propeller arc. Saulnier had failed to develop a synchroniser and with Garros, as an interim solution, fitted metal wedges to the propeller; bullets that hit the blades were deflected by them. Garros burned his aircraft but this failed to conceal the nature of the device and the significance of the deflector blades. The German authorities requested several aircraft manufacturers, including that of Anthony Fokker, to produce a copy.

===Synchronisation gear===

The Fokker company produced the (push rod controller), a genuine synchronisation gear. Impulses from a cam driven by the engine controlled the timing of the machine-gun for its fire to be limited to the intervals between the propeller blades&#x27; travel past the barrel. Unlike earlier proposed gears, the was fitted to an aircraft and proved effective. In a postwar biography, Fokker claimed that he produced the gear in 48hours but it was probably designed by Heinrich Lübbe, a engineer. Among several pre-war patents for similar devices was that of Franz Schneider, a Swiss engineer who had worked for Nieuport and the German LVG company.

The device was fitted to the most suitable Fokker type, the Fokker M.5K (military type name &quot;Fokker A.III&quot;), of which A.16/15, assigned to Otto Parschau, became the prototype of the Fokker Eindecker series of fighter designs. Fokker demonstrated A.16/15 in May and June 1915 to German fighter pilots, including Kurt Wintgens, Oswald Boelcke and Max Immelmann. The Fokker, with its typical controls, an over-sensitive balanced elevator and dubious lateral control, was difficult to fly; Parschau, who was experienced on FokkerA types, converted pilots to the new fighter. The early were attached to FFAs, in ones and twos, to protect reconnaissance machines from Allied machine-gun-armed aircraft.

==Operational service==

===Service début===
Fokker E.5/15, the last of the pre-production series, is believed to have been first flown in action by Kurt Wintgens of FFA6. On 1and 4July 1915, he reported combats with French Morane-SaulnierL (Parasols), well over the French lines. The claims were not confirmed but research has shown that the first claim matches French records of a Morane forced down on 1July near Lunéville, with a wounded crew and a damaged engine, followed three days later by another. By 15July, Wintgens had moved to FFA48 and scored his first confirmed victory, another MoraneL. Parschau had received the new E.1/15 (Fokker factory serial 191), the initial example of the five Fokker M.5K/MG service test examples for the line of aircraft, when the A.16/15 (green machine), he had flown since the beginning of the war, was returned to the Fokker Flugzeugbau factory in Schwerin–Gorries for development.

By the end of July 1915, about fifteen were operational with various units, including the five M.5K/MGs and about ten early production E.I airframes. The pilots flew the new aircraft as a sideline, when not flying normal operations in two-seater reconnaissance aircraft. Boelcke, in FFA62, scored his first victory in an Albatros C.I on 4July. M.5K/MG prototype airframe E.3/15, the first delivered to FFA62, was armed with a Parabellum MG14 gun, synchronised by the unreliable first version of the Fokker gear. At first, E.3/15 was jointly allocated to him and Immelmann when their &quot;official&quot; duties permitted, allowing them to master the type&#x27;s difficult handling characteristics and to practice shooting at ground targets. Immelmann was soon allocated a very early production Fokker E.I, E.13/15, one of the first armed with the lMG 08 (a lightened version of the MG08 &quot;Spandau&quot;) machine-gun, using the more reliable production version of the Fokker gear.

===The Scourge begins===
The Fokker Scourge is usually considered by the British to have begun on 1August, when B.E.2cs of 2 Squadron Royal Flying Corps (RFC) bombed the base of FFA62 at waking the German pilots, including Boelcke (most likely, still with E 3/15) and Immelmann (flying E 13/15), who were quickly into the air after the raiders. Boelcke suffered a jammed gun but Immelmann caught up with a B.E.2c and shot it down. This aircraft was flown as a bomber, without an observer or Lewis gun, the pilot armed only with an automatic pistol. After about ten minutes of manoeuvring (giving the lie to exaggerated accounts of the stability of B.E.2 aircraft) Immelmann had fired 450rounds, which riddled the B.E. and wounded the pilot in the arm. By late October, towards the end of the Battle of Loos, more Fokkers (including the similar Pfalz E-type fighters, which were also called Fokkers by Allied airmen) were encountered by RFC pilots and by December, forty Fokkers were in service.

In the new fighters, pilots could make long, steep dives, aiming the fixed, synchronised machine-gun by aiming the aircraft. The machine gun was belt-fed, unlike the drum-fed Lewis guns of their opponents, who had to change drums when in action. The Fokker pilots took to flying high and diving on their quarry, usually out of the sun, firing a long burst and continuing the dive until well out of range. If the British aircraft had not been shot down, the German pilot could climb again and repeat the process. Immelmann invented the Immelmann turn, a zoom after the dive, followed by a roll when vertical to face the opposite way, after which he could turn to attack again.

The mystique acquired by the Fokker was greater than its material effect and in October, RFC HQ expressed concern at the willingness of pilots to avoid combat. RFC losses were exacerbated by the increase in the number of aircraft at the front, from 85 to 161 between March and September, the hard winter of 1915–1916 and some aggressive flying by the new German &quot;C&quot; type two-seaters. Boelcke and Immelmann continued to score, as did Hans Joachim Buddecke, Ernst von Althaus and Rudolph Berthold from FFA23 and Kurt vonCrailshein of FFA53. The &quot;official&quot; list of claims by Fokker pilots for the second half of 1915 was no more than 28, many of them over French aircraft. Thirteen aeroplanes had been shot down by Immelmann or Boelcke and the rest by seven other Fokker pilots. January 1916 brought thirteen claims, most of them against the French, followed by twenty more in February, the last month of the &quot;scourge&quot; proper. Most of the victories were scored by aces rather than the newer pilots flying the greater number of Fokkers. Allied casualties had been light by later standards but the loss of air superiority to the Germans, flying a new and supposedly invincible aircraft, caused dismay among the Allied commanders and lowered the morale of Allied airmen. In his memoir &quot;Sagittarius Rising&quot; (1936), Cecil Lewis wrote,

On 14 January, RFC HQ issued orders that until better aircraft arrived, long and short-range reconnaissance aircraft must have three escorts flying in close formation. If contact with the escorts was lost, the reconnaissance must be cancelled, as would photographic reconnaissance to any great distance beyond the front line. Sending the B.E.2c into action without an observer armed with a Lewis gun also became less prevalent. The new tactic of concentrating aircraft in time and space had the effect of reducing the number of reconnaissance sorties the RFC could fly.
New defensive formations were devised; a II Wing RFC method was for the reconnaissance aircraft to lead, escorted on each side higher, with another escort behind and above. On 7 February, on a IIWing long-range reconnaissance, the observation pilot flew at ; a German aircraft appeared over Roulers (Roeselare) and seven more closed in behind the formation. West of Torhout (Thourout) two Fokkers arrived and attacked at once, one diving on the reconnaissance machine and the other on an escort. Six more German aircraft appeared over Cortemarck (Kortemark) and formed a procession of fourteen aeroplanes stalking the British formation. None of the German pilots attacked and all the British aircraft returned, only to meet two German aircraft coming back from a bombing raid, which opened fire and mortally wounded the pilot of one of the escorts. The British ascribed their immunity to attack during the 55-minute flight to the rigid formation which the two Fokkers were unable to disrupt.

On 7 February, a 12 Squadron B.E.2c., was to be escorted by three B.E.2cs, two F.E.2s and a Bristol Scout from 12 Squadron and two more F.Es. and four R.E. aeroplanes from 21 Squadron. The flight was cancelled due to bad weather but twelve escorts for one reconnaissance aircraft demonstrated the effect of the Fokkers in reducing the efficiency of RFC operations. British and French reconnaissance flights to get aerial photographs for intelligence and artillery ranging data had become riskier, in spite of German fighters being forbidden to fly over Allied lines (to keep the synchronisation gear secret). This policy, for various reasons, prevailed for most of the war; the rarity of German fighters appearing behind the Allied lines limited the degree of air superiority they were able to attain.

===End of the Scourge===

The scourge waned during the Battle of Verdun (21February20December 1916). The Germans tried to impose an air barrage () which concealed much of the German preparation for the offensive from French aerial reconnaissance. During March and April increasing numbers of the new French Nieuport 11 fighters were sent to Verdun. Organised in specialist fighter squadrons () the Nieuports could operate in formations larger than the singletons or pairs normally flown by the Fokkers, quickly regaining air superiority for the .

British F.E.2b pusher aircraft had been arriving in France from late 1915 and in the New Year began to replace the older F.B.5s. The pilot and observer had a good view forwards from their cockpits and the observer could also fire backwards over the tail. 20 Squadron, the first squadron equipped with the F.E., arrived in France on 23January 1916, for long-range reconnaissance and escort flying. The new aircraft lacked the speed to pursue the Fokkers and had limited manoeuvrability but the F.E.s became formidable opponents, particularly when flying in formation.
The Airco DH.2, a single-seat fighter, began to arrive at the front in February 1916. This aircraft had a modest performance but its superior manoeuvrability gave it an advantage over the , especially once the Lewis gun was fixed to point in the direction of flight. On 8 February, 24 Squadron (Major Lanoe Hawker) arrived with D.H.2s and began patrols north of the Somme; another six D.H.2 squadrons followed. On 25 April, two of the D.H. pilots were attacked and found that they could out-manoeuvre the Fokkers; a few days later, without opening fire, a D.H. pilot caused a Fokker to crash onto a roof at Bapaume. The Nieuports proved even more effective when the first Nieuport 16s in British service were issued to 1 and 11 Squadrons in April.

By March 1916, despite frequent encounters with Fokkers and the success of aces, the scourge was almost over. The bogey of the Fokker as a fighter was finally laid in April, when an E.III landed by mistake at a British aerodrome. The captured aircraft was found not to have the superior performance it had been credited with. The first British aircraft with a synchronisation gear was a Bristol Scout, which arrived on 25 March 1916 and on 24 May the first Sopwith 1½ Strutter aircraft were flown to France by a flight of 70 Squadron.

===End of the ===
The effect of the new Allied types, especially the Nieuport, was of considerable concern to the Fokker pilots; some even took to flying captured examples. was sufficiently desperate to order German firms to build Nieuport copies, of which the Euler D.I and the Siemens-Schuckert D.I were built in small numbers. New D type single-seat, biplane fighters, particularly the Fokker D.II and Halberstadt D.II, had been under test since late 1915 and the replacement of the monoplanes with these types began by mid-1916.

In February 1916, Friedrich Stempel began to assemble (KEK, single-seat battle units). The KEK were units mostly of two to four fighters, equipped with and other types which had served with FFA units during the winter of 1915–1916. By July 1916, KEK had been formed at Vaux, Avillers, Jametz and Cunel near Verdun as well as other places on the Western Front, as (aerial guard service) units, consisting only of fighters. In late May, German air activity on the British front decreased markedly, while the commander of the new , (Colonel) Hermann von der Lieth-Thomsen, reorganised the German air service. The fighters of the KEK were concentrated into fighter squadrons () the first of which, &quot;Jagdstaffel&quot; 2 () went into action on the Somme on 17 September. By this time, the last of the , long outmoded as front line fighters, had been retired.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===
Among British politicians and journalists who grossly exaggerated the material effects of the &quot;Scourge&quot; were the eminent pioneering aviation journalist C.G. Grey, founder of &quot;The Aeroplane&quot;, one of the first aviation magazines and Noel Pemberton Billing, a Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) pilot, notably unsuccessful aircraft designer and manufacturer and a Member of Parliament from March 1916. Their supposed object was the replacement of the B.E.2c with better aircraft but it took the form of an attack on the RFC command and the Royal Aircraft Factory. C.G. Grey had orchestrated a campaign against the Royal Aircraft Factory in the pages of &quot;The Aeroplane&quot;, going back to its period as the Balloon Factory, well before it had produced any heavier-than-air aircraft.

Before the unsuitability of the B.E.2c for aerial combat was exposed by the first Fokker aces, criticism was not primarily aimed at the technical quality of Royal Aircraft Factory aircraft but because a government body was competing with private industry. When the news of the Fokker monoplane fighters reached him in late 1915, Grey was quick to blame the problem on orders for equipment that the latest developments had rendered obsolete. Grey did not suggest alternative aircraft, even supposing that the rapid development of aviation technology during the war could have been foreseen. Pemberton Billing also blamed the initially poor performance of British aircraft manufacturers on what he saw as the favouritism shown by the RFC, an arm of the British Army, towards the Royal Aircraft Factory, which, while nominally civilian, was also part of the army. Pemberton Billing claimed that,

Even among writers who recognised the hysteria of this version of events, this picture of the Fokker Scourge gained considerable currency during the war and afterwards. In 1996 Peter Grosz wrote,

===Subsequent operations===

The period of Allied air superiority that followed the Fokker Scourge was brief; by mid-September 1916, the first twin-&quot;Spandau&quot; armed Albatros D.I fighters were coming into service. The new aircraft were again able to challenge Allied aircraft, culminating in &quot;Bloody April&quot; during the Battle of Arras In the next two years, the Allied air forces gradually overwhelmed the in quality and quantity, until the Germans were only able to gain temporary control over small areas of the Western Front. When this tactic became untenable, development of new aircraft began, which led to the Fokker D.VII. The new aircraft created another Fokker Scourge in the summer of 1918 and as a condition of the Armistice, Germany was required to surrender all of its to the Allies.

<text>Carabaos () are a genetically distinct population of swamp-type water buffaloes (&quot;Bubalus bubalis kerabau&quot;) from the Philippines. They were also further introduced to Sulawesi and Borneo of eastern Indonesia and Malaysia.

Carabaos are the traditional draft animals in the Philippines for paddy field rice cultivation and are commonly raised by smallholder farmers. They were also formerly widely used for the transport of goods throughout the islands. They are a source of carabao milk and carabeef, among other products. The carabao is widely considered to be the national animal of the Philippines and symbolizes hard work.

Carabaos were introduced to Guam from the Philippines in the 17th century. They have also acquired great cultural significance to the Chamorro people and are considered the unofficial national animal of Guam.

The term &quot;carabao&quot; is also sometimes used for the &quot;kerbau&quot; in Malaysia, which is the official animal of the state of Negeri Sembilan. However, water buffaloes from Peninsular Malaysia and western Indonesia (Java and Sumatra) are not carabaos and descend from different populations that were introduced through a later separate route from Mainland Southeast Asia rather than through Taiwan.

==Names and etymology==
The English term &quot;carabao&quot; is borrowed from the Spanish word , which is derived from Eastern Visayan (likely Waray) . The female is called (in Spanish) a . Cognates include Cebuano , Tagalog , Kavalan , Minangkabau &quot;kabau&quot;, Malay/Indonesian &quot;kerbau&quot;, Javanese , and Indonesian Dutch . These Austronesian terms appear to be loanwords from the Austroasiatic languages and likely derives from a secondary pre-colonial introduction of water buffaloes into Island Southeast Asia via western Indonesia.

However, it is also clear that Austronesians already had ancient terms for the carabao, reconstructed as Proto-Austronesian *qaNuaŋ. Cognates include Papora , Thao , Siraya , Rukai , Ilocano , Tagalog or , Kankanaey , Isneg , Itawis , Bontoc , Ifugao , and Aklanon . Cognates survive into Sulawesi, but the terms there apply to the related anoa. Similarly, Hanunó&#x27;o also refers to the tamaraw of Mindoro, rather than the carabao. These terms spread southwards from Taiwan, indicating that domesticated carabaos were carried partially into the Philippines during the Austronesian expansion, but didn&#x27;t move further south into the rest of Island Southeast Asia until the second introduction from Mainland Southeast Asia. The reason for this is unknown.

Other native names for carabaos include in Tagalog, Bikol, and Kapampangan; in Pangasinan; and in Ivatan. The resemblance of the word &quot;carabao&quot; to &quot;caribou&quot; is coincidental, and they do not share a common etymology — an example of a false cognate.

== History ==
The oldest evidence of water buffalo discovered in the Philippines is multiple fragmentary skeletal remains recovered from the upper layers of the Neolithic Nagsabaran site, part of the Lal-lo and Gattaran Shell Middens (~2200 BCE to 400 CE) of northern Luzon. Most of the remains consisted of skull fragments, almost all of which have cut marks indicating they were butchered. The remains are associated with red slipped pottery, spindle whorls, stone adzes, and jade bracelets; which have strong affinities to similar artifacts from Neolithic Austronesian archeological sites in Taiwan. Based on the radiocarbon date of the layer in which the oldest fragments were found, water buffalo were already present in the Philippines by at least 500 BCE.

Genetic studies have shown that the closest related populations to carabaos are the swamp buffalo populations of Taiwan, which in turn descended from swamp buffaloes from the Neolithic rice-farming cultures of the Yangtze Delta. This indicates that carabaos were carried along by the Austronesian migrations into the Philippines from Taiwan, and then further onward to Borneo and Sulawesi. Carabaos are genetically distinct from the swamp buffaloes of Peninsular Malaysia and western Indonesia (Java and Sumatra), which show closer affinities to swamp buffaloes from Mainland Southeast Asia, indicating that they originated from a different introduction pathway.

==Description ==
Carabaos have the low, wide, and heavy build of draft animals. They vary in color from light grey to slate grey. The horns are sickle-shaped or curve backward toward the neck. Chevrons are common. Albinoids are present in the proportion of about 3% of the buffalo population. Mature male carabaos weigh , and females . Height at withers of the male ranges from , and of the female from .

Carabaos prefer to wallow in a mudhole that they make with the horns. Their objective is to acquire a thick coating of mud. They thrive on many aquatic plants and in time of flood will graze submerged, raising their heads above the water and carrying quantities of edible plants. They eat reeds, the giant reed, bulrush, sedges, the common water hyacinth, and rushes. Green fodders are used widely for intensive milk production and for fattening. Many fodder crops are conserved as hay, chaffed, or pulped. Trials in the Philippines showed that the carabao, on poor-quality roughage, had a better feed conversion rate than cattle.

==Husbandry==
In 1993, the Philippine Carabao Center (PCC) was established to conserve, propagate, and promote the carabao as a source of draft animal power, meat, milk, and hide to benefit the rural farmers through carabao genetic improvement, technology development and dissemination, and establishment of carabao-based enterprises, thus ensuring higher income and better nutrition. The National Water Buffalo Gene Pool in Muñoz, Nueva Ecija, is a facility for continuous selection, testing, and propagation of superior breeds of dairy buffalo.

===Draft animals===

Carabaos are mainly used as draft animals for paddy field rice cultivation. In 2023, the vast majority of Philippine carabaos (99.3%) are raised for this purpose by smallholder farmers. Carabaos raised as draft animals are typically docile and can be trained with simple commands. They are treated as a family pet and are regularly taken to bodies of water to bathe when not working. The advent of modern machinery like tractors are slowly displacing carabaos in their role as draft animals.

The traditional equipment used with the carabao is a plow or harrow attached to the animal by a yoke. In modern times, carabaos are also used to plow fields for crops that grow on dry land, like corn, sugarcane, or upland rice. Another older method of preparing fields with the carabao is known as , which is still practiced by some farmers in Northern Samar. In , the soil of the rice paddy is first softened with rainwater or diverted watershed, then the farmer guides a group of carabaos in trampling the planting area until it is soggy enough to receive the rice seedlings. This time-consuming task produces lower yields and lower income when compared with the advancement in irrigated fields.

Before modern equipment, carabaos were also formerly used to thresh rice by trampling them while going around a post, separating the grains from the stalks. They were also used to power stone mills used for crushing sugarcane in pre-modern sugar production.

Carabaos were also widely used for transporting goods in the past, usually via a carabao sled () or a two-wheeled cart ( or , also spelled or , from Spanish ). The is typically used for rocky or muddy terrain, and has the advantage of being capable of traveling over rice paddy dikes without destroying them. The , on the other hand, is typically reserved for traveling on roads. The come in various designs and can be covered in a roof of woven split bamboo (&quot;sawali&quot;) or thatched nipa palm leaves (&quot;pawid&quot;).

One of the many reasons for the failure of the attempted Japanese pacification of the Philippines during their 1941–1945 occupation was their indifference to the basics of the Philippine economy. The carabaos provided the necessary labor that allowed Philippine farmers to grow rice and other staples. Japanese army patrols would not only confiscate the rice, but would also slaughter the carabaos for meat, thereby preventing the farmers from growing enough rice to feed the large population. Before World War II, an estimated three million carabaos inhabited the Philippines. By the end of the war, an estimated nearly 70% of them had been lost.

===Dairy products===


Carabao milk is richer and creamier in texture than cow or goat milk, due to its much higher fat and protein content. It has similar mineral content as cow milk, except it has twice as much phosphorus. It is characteristically bluish-white in color. Carabao milk is typically home-pasteurized via a double boiler.

Carabao milk is used widely in traditional Filipino cuisine due to its easier availability prior to modern importation and the development of canned milk. However, it never became widely commercialized and still remains a cottage industry. One of the main goals of the Philippine Carabao Center is the development of a more productive breed of carabaos for commercial dairy production and to encourage the growth of the carabao milk industry in the private sector.

The most common use of carabao milk is for the production of &quot;kesong puti&quot;, a traditional soft cheese. It is also used for sweets including &quot;pastillas de leche&quot;, &quot;tibok-tibok&quot;, leche flan, and a traditional ice cream flavor for sorbetes known as &quot;helado de mantecado&quot;. Carabao milk can also eaten for breakfast or &quot;merienda&quot; poured over rice with various other ingredients.

===Meat===
The term &quot;carabeef&quot; is used to refer to the meat of carabaos in the Philippines. It is a portmanteau of &quot;carabao&quot; and &quot;beef&quot; and was originally coined in Philippine English in the 1970s to distinguish the meat of water buffalos from beef.

The butchering of carabaos is strictly regulated under Philippine law in an effort to conserve the population. Only carabaos that are seven years or older (if male) or eleven years or older (if female) can be slaughtered after the acquisition of necessary permits and clearances. In all other instances, the killing of carabaos is illegal. However, this law is often violated due to poor enforcement.

Carabeef is popular in some regions and can be used in dishes in place of beef, like in &quot;tapa&quot;, as well as in commercial processed meat like corned beef and &quot;longganisa&quot;. Carabao skin can also be cooked as &quot;chicharon&quot;.

===Other products===
Carabao hide was once used extensively to create a variety of products, including the armor of precolonial Philippine warriors. The horns are also carved and used to make the pommels of Philippine swords and bladed tools like bolos. Carabao hide is still used for leather production with an estimated total market value of $10 million, as of 2002.
===Cross-breeding===
The carabao has been crossbred with other water buffalo breeds. Notable breeds with carabao ancestry include the buffalypso of Trinidad and Tobago and the Brazilian carabao of Brazil. The buffalypso is the result of breeding programs that crossed the carabao with river-type buffaloes like the Murrah buffalo, the Surti buffalo, the Jaffarabadi buffalo, the Nili-Ravi, and the Bhadawari. Brazilian carabaos (called or in Portuguese) are naturalized populations of swamp-type buffalos, including carabaos, imported from French Indochina to Brazil in the late 19th century.

==Conservation==
As of 2023, there are an estimated 2.74 million heads of carabaos in the Philippines. 99.3% are from smallhold farms, while the remaining 0.5% and 0.2% are from semi-commercial and commercial farms, respectively. The highest population of carabaos is from the Bicol Region, with an estimated 324,220 heads, followed by the Western Visayas (251,570), Central Luzon (250,640), Central Visayas (218,290), and the Cagayan Valley (208,710).

Carabaos are increasingly being replaced by modern machinery, leading to more and more carabaos being slaughtered for meat as they lose their agricultural importance. They&#x27;ve also gone through population decimations in the past from diseases as well as carabao massacres in World War II.

Water buffalos have also been imported from abroad by the Philippine Carabao Center and crossbred with the carabao in an effort to develop a more productive breed for milk production. In 2015, an estimated 10,000 heads of the commercial herds of water buffalo in the Philippines are imported riverine-type breeds, most notably the Murrah buffalo (sourced from Brazil, Bulgaria, and Italy). Another 29,700 heads are crossbreeds of the carabao and imported river buffaloes.

Despite this, the PCC ensures that the native carabao gene pool is preserved by the cryopreservation of carabao germplasm. A cryobank facility for this purpose was inaugurated in 2012 in the Livestock Innovations and Biotechnology complex of the PCC national headquarters in Muñoz, Nueva Ecija. The cryobank also holds samples of other native breeds of domestic animals, as well as plans for the preservation of the germplasm of other threatened endemic species.

Various organizations have also created sanctuaries for native carabaos where slaughtering animals is restricted and the introduction of foreign breeds are banned. This includes the communal grazing grounds of Mahatao in the Batanes Islands; the national conservation site of carabaos in Peñablanca in Cagayan; and the municipality of President Carlos P. Garcia in Lapinig Island, Bohol.

==In culture==
===Festivals===
The carabao is featured in numerous festivals () in the Philippines due to its important role in rural farming communities. The festivals which feature carabaos prominently include:

* Pasungay Festival (San Joaquin, Iloilo) - A religious festival honoring Sto. Niño held every 3rd Saturday of January. The highlight of the festival is a traditional fight between two bull carabaos.
* Kariton Festival (Licab, Nueva Ecija) - A cultural festival held every last Saturday of March. It celebrates the carabao-drawn cart () used by the town&#x27;s founding father.

* Karabaw Festival (Gandara, Samar) - A cultural festival held on September 29. It celebrates the carabao and features street dancers depicting carabaos.
* Turogpo Festival (Carigara, Leyte) - A cultural festival held during Holy Saturday. The word means &quot;match&quot; and it features a fight between two carabao bulls until one of them runs away from their opponent.

===Symbolism===

Despite the carabao being widely regarded as the national animal of the Philippines, the National Commission for Culture and the Arts of the Philippines has stated that this still has not been officially recognized by law. House Bill 3926, Philippine National Symbols Act of 2014, was proposed in Philippine Congress with the aim of officially declaring the country&#x27;s national symbols, including the carabao as the national animal. It is currently still pending.

In the late 1980s, the carabao puppet character Kardong Kalabaw became popular as a symbol of the Philippine people&#x27;s hard work and sense of industry.

The Military Order of the Carabao, a social club started in 1900 by American enlisted men fighting in the Philippine-American War, believes that the water buffalo symbolizes the &quot;camaraderie that grows among members of the armed forces who face the dangers and privations of extensive military service far from home.&quot;

=== Carabao racing ===
Carabao racing is a widely popular sport among farmers and carabao enthusiasts in the Philippines. In central and southern Luzon and in South Cotabato some fiestas have carabao racing as their highlight. Training and conditioning of the race carabao to its full extent is a serious job. Farmers and their trustworthy carabaos gather together to race in a dirt road. Spectators fill up this unique spectacle, some betting on their best carabaos, others watch for the thrill. The carabaos, geared with their carts on their back, race together with their farmer to win prizes. The race is divided into two classes, one for amateur or first-time carabao racers and the other is for the veteran carabao racers. A race carabao can be bought for ₱35,000 to ₱60,000, with the price increasing with the number of races that it wins. Proven race winners can command a price as high as ₱200,000.

== In Guam ==

Carabaos were introduced to Guam by Spanish missionaries in the 17th century from domestic stock in the Philippines to be used as beasts of burden. A feral herd on the US Naval Magazine in central Guam was classified as protected game, but the population has been declining since 1982, most likely due to illegal hunting.

Carabaos were used for farming and for pulling carts. They were fairly common on Guam before the 20th century, with a population numbering in the thousands. Today, they are rare in most parts of the island except in the US Naval Magazine near the village of Santa Rita, which is fenced on all sides. The carabao population of Naval Magazine has grown to several hundred, to the point that they have become a pest and caused environmental damage, and polluted the water supply in the Fena Reservoir. In 2003, the Navy began a program of extermination to control the carabao population of Naval Magazine, a move that was protested by many Chamorro people.

The carabao is considered a symbol of Guam. In the early 1960s, carabao races were a popular sport in the island, especially during fiestas. Today, carabaos are a part of the popular culture. They are often brought to carnivals or other festivities, and are used as a popular ride for children. Carabao meat is sometimes eaten as a delicacy.

<text>Percy Wyndham Lewis (18 November 1882 – 7 March 1957) was a British writer, painter and critic. He was a co-founder of the Vorticist movement in art and edited &quot;BLAST&quot;, the literary magazine of the Vorticists.

His novels include &quot;Tarr&quot; (1916–17) and &quot;The Human Age&quot; trilogy, composed of &quot;The Childermass&quot; (1928), &quot;Monstre Gai&quot; (1955) and &quot;Malign Fiesta&quot; (1955). A fourth volume, titled &quot;The Trial of Man&quot;, was unfinished at the time of his death. He also wrote two autobiographical volumes: &quot;Blasting and Bombardiering&quot; (1937) and &quot;Rude Assignment: A Narrative of my Career Up-to-Date&quot; (1950).

==Life and career==

=== Early life ===
Lewis was born on 18 November 1882, reputedly on his father&#x27;s yacht off the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. His English mother, Anne Stuart Lewis (née Prickett), and American father, Charles Edward Lewis, separated about 1893. His mother subsequently returned to England. Lewis was educated in England at Rugby School and then, from 16, the Slade School of Fine Art, University College London, but left for Paris without finishing his course. He spent most of the 1900s travelling around Europe and studying art in Paris. While in Paris, he attended lectures by Henri Bergson on process philosophy.

===Early work and development of Vorticism (1908–1915)===
In 1908, Lewis moved to London, where he would reside for much of his life. In 1909, he published his first work, accounts of his travels in Brittany, in Ford Madox Ford&#x27;s &quot;The English Review&quot;. He was a founding member of the Camden Town Group, which brought him into close contact with the Bloomsbury Group, particularly Roger Fry and Clive Bell, with whom he soon fell out.

In 1912, Lewis exhibited his work at the second Postimpressionist exhibition: Cubo-Futurist illustrations to &quot;Timon of Athens&quot; and three major oil paintings. In 1912, he was commissioned to produce a decorative mural, a drop curtain, and more designs for The Cave of the Golden Calf, an avant-garde cabaret and nightclub on Heddon Street.

From 1913 to 1915, Lewis developed the style of geometric abstraction for which he is best known today, which his friend Ezra Pound dubbed &quot;Vorticism&quot;. Lewis sought to combine the strong structure of Cubism, which he found was not &quot;alive&quot;, with the liveliness of Futurist art, which lacked structure. The combination was a strikingly dramatic critique of modernity. In his early visual works, Lewis may have been influenced by Bergson&#x27;s process philosophy. Though he was later savagely critical of Bergson, he admitted in a letter to Theodore Weiss (19 April 1949) that he &quot;began by embracing his evolutionary system.&quot; Nietzsche was an equally important influence.

Lewis had a brief tenure at Roger Fry&#x27;s Omega Workshops, but left after a quarrel with Fry over a commission to provide wall decorations for the Daily Mail Ideal Home Exhibition, which Lewis believed Fry had misappropriated. He and several other Omega artists started a competing workshop called the Rebel Art Centre. The Centre operated for only four months, but it gave birth to the Vorticist group and its publication, &quot;BLAST&quot;. In &quot;BLAST,&quot; Lewis formally expounded the Vorticist aesthetic in a manifesto, distinguishing it from other avant-garde practices. He also wrote and published a play, &quot;Enemy of the Stars&quot;. It is a proto-absurdist, Expressionist drama. Lewis scholar Melania Terrazas identifies it as a precursor to the plays of Samuel Beckett.

=== World War I (1915–1918) ===

In 1915, the Vorticists held their only U.K. exhibition before the movement broke up, largely as a result of World War I. Lewis himself was posted to the western front and served as a second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery. Much of his time was spent in Forward Observation Posts looking down at apparently deserted German lines, registering targets and calling down fire from batteries massed around the rim of the Ypres Salient. He made vivid accounts of narrow misses and deadly artillery duels.

After the Third Battle of Ypres, Lewis was appointed an official war artist for the Canadian and British governments. For the Canadians, he painted &quot;&quot; (1918) from sketches made on Vimy Ridge. For the British, he painted one of his best-known works, &quot;A Battery Shelled&quot; (1919), drawing on his own experience at Ypres. Lewis exhibited his war drawings and some other paintings of the war in an exhibition, &quot;Guns&quot;, in 1918. Although the Vorticist group broke up after the war, Lewis&#x27;s patron, John Quinn, organized a Vorticist exhibition at the Penguin Club in New York in 1917. 

Between the years 1907–11 Lewis had written what would be his first published novel, &quot;Tarr&quot;, which was revised and expanded in 1914–15 and serialized in the London literary magazine &quot;The Egoist&quot; from April 1916 until November 1917. It was first published in book form in 1918 by Alfred A. Knopf in New York and by &quot;The Egoist&quot; in London. It is widely regarded as one of the key texts in literary modernism.

Lewis later documented his experiences and opinions of this period of his life in the autobiographical &quot;Blasting and Bombardiering&quot; (1937), which covered the time up to 1926.

=== &quot;Tyros&quot; and writing (1918–1929) ===

After the war, Lewis resumed his career as a painter with a major exhibition, &quot;Tyros and Portraits&quot;, at the Leicester Galleries in 1921. &quot;Tyros&quot; were satirical caricatures intended to comment on the culture of the &quot;new epoch&quot; that succeeded the First World War. &quot;A Reading of Ovid&quot; and &quot;Mr Wyndham Lewis as a Tyro&quot; are the only surviving oil paintings from this series. Lewis also launched his second magazine, &quot;The Tyro&quot;, of which there were only two issues. The second (1922) contained an important statement of Lewis&#x27;s visual aesthetic: &quot;Essay on the Objective of Plastic Art in our Time&quot;. It was during the early 1920s that he perfected his incisive draughtsmanship.

By the late 1920s, he concentrated on writing. He launched yet another magazine, &quot;The Enemy&quot; (1927–1929), largely written by himself and declaring its belligerent critical stance in its title. The magazine and other theoretical and critical works he published from 1926 to 1929 mark a deliberate separation from the avant-garde and his previous associates. He believed that their work failed to show sufficient critical awareness of those ideologies that worked against truly revolutionary change in the West, and therefore became a vehicle for these pernicious ideologies. His major theoretical and cultural statement from this period is &quot;The Art of Being Ruled&quot; (1926).

&quot;Time and Western Man&quot; (1927) is a cultural and philosophical discussion that includes penetrating critiques of James Joyce, Gertrude Stein and Ezra Pound that are still read. Lewis also attacked the process philosophy of Bergson, Samuel Alexander, Alfred North Whitehead, and others. By 1931 he was advocating the art of ancient Egypt as impossible to surpass.

===Fiction and political writing (1930–1936)===
In 1930 Lewis published &quot;The Apes of God&quot;, a biting satirical attack on the London literary scene, including a long chapter caricaturing the Sitwell family. Richard Aldington, however, found it &quot;the greatest piece of &quot;writing&quot; since &quot;Ulysses&quot;&quot;, by James Joyce. In 1937 Lewis published &quot;The Revenge for Love&quot;, set in the period leading up to the Spanish Civil War and regarded by many as his best novel. It is strongly critical of communist activity in Spain and presents English intellectual fellow travellers as deluded.

Despite serious illness necessitating several operations, he was very productive as a critic and painter. He produced a book of poems, &quot;One-Way Song&quot;, in 1933, and a revised version of &quot;Enemy of the Stars&quot;. An important book of critical essays also belongs to this period: &quot;Men without Art&quot; (1934). It grew out of a defence of Lewis&#x27;s satirical practice in &quot;The Apes of God&quot; and puts forward a theory of &quot;non-moral&quot;, or metaphysical, satire. The book is probably best remembered for one of the first commentaries on Faulkner and a famous essay on Hemingway.

===Return to painting (1936–1941)===

After becoming better known for his writing than his painting in the 1920s and early 1930s, he returned to more concentrated work on visual art, and paintings from the 1930s and 1940s constitute some of his best-known work. The &quot;Surrender of Barcelona&quot; (1936–37) makes a significant statement about the Spanish Civil War. It was included in an exhibition at the Leicester Galleries in 1937 that Lewis hoped would re-establish his reputation as a painter. After the publication in &quot;The Times&quot; of a letter of support for the exhibition, asking that something from the show be purchased for the national collection (signed by, among others, Stephen Spender, W. H. Auden, Geoffrey Grigson, Rebecca West, Naomi Mitchison, Henry Moore and Eric Gill) the Tate Gallery bought the painting, &quot;Red Scene&quot;. Like others from the exhibition, it shows an influence from Surrealism and de Chirico&#x27;s Metaphysical Painting. Lewis was highly critical of the ideology of Surrealism, but admired the visual qualities of some Surrealist art.

During this period, Lewis also produced many of his most well-known portraits, including pictures of Edith Sitwell (1923–1936), T. S. Eliot (1938 and 1949), and Ezra Pound (1939). His 1938 portrait of Eliot was rejected by the selection committee of the Royal Academy for their annual exhibition and caused a furore. Augustus John resigned in protest.

=== World War II and North America (1941–1945) ===
Lewis spent World War II in the United States and Canada. In 1941, in Toronto, he produced a series of watercolour fantasies centred on themes of creation, crucifixion and bathing.

He grew to appreciate the cosmopolitan and &quot;rootless&quot; nature of the American melting pot, declaring that the greatest advantage of being American was to have &quot;turned one&#x27;s back on race, caste, and all that pertains to the rooted state.&quot; He praised the contributions of African-Americans to American culture, and regarded Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and José Clemente Orozco as the &quot;best North American artists,&quot; predicting that when &quot;the Indian culture of Mexico melts into the great American mass to the North, the Indian will probably give it its art.&quot; He returned to England in 1945.

===Later life and blindness (1945–1951)===
By 1951, he was completely blinded by a pituitary tumor that placed pressure on his optic nerve. It ended his artistic career, but he continued writing until his death. He published several autobiographical and critical works: &quot;Rude Assignment&quot; (1950), &quot;Rotting Hill&quot; (1951), a collection of allegorical short stories about his life in &quot;the capital of a dying empire&quot;; &quot;The Writer and the Absolute&quot; (1952), a book of essays on writers including George Orwell, Jean-Paul Sartre and André Malraux; and the semi-autobiographical novel &quot;Self Condemned&quot; (1954).

The BBC commissioned Lewis to complete his 1928 work &quot;The Childermass&quot;, which was published as &quot;The Human Age&quot; and dramatized for the BBC Third Programme in 1955. In 1956, the Tate Gallery held a major exhibition of his work, &quot;Wyndham Lewis and Vorticism&quot;, in the catalogue to which he declared that &quot;Vorticism, in fact, was what I, personally, did and said at a certain period&quot;—a statement which brought forth a series of &quot;Vortex Pamphlets&quot; from his fellow &quot;BLAST&quot; signatory William Roberts.

== Personal life ==
From 1918 to 1921, Lewis lived with Iris Barry, with whom he had two children. He is said to have shown little affection for them.

In 1930, Lewis married Gladys Anne Hoskins (1900–1979), who was affectionately known as Froanna. They lived together for 10 years before marrying and never had children.

Lewis kept Froanna in the background, and many of his friends were unaware of her existence. It seems that Lewis was extraordinarily jealous and protective of his wife, owing to her youth and beauty. Froanna was patient and caring toward her husband through financial troubles and his frequent illnesses. She was the model for some of Lewis&#x27;s more tender and intimate portraits as well as a number of characters in his fiction. In contrast to his earlier, impersonal portraits, which are purely concerned with external appearance, the portraits of Froanna show a preoccupation with her inner life.

Always interested in Roman Catholicism, he never converted. He died in 1957 and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium. By the time of his death, Lewis had written 40 books in all.

=== Political views ===
In 1931, after a visit to Berlin, Lewis published &quot;Hitler&quot; (1931), a book presenting Adolf Hitler as a &quot;man of peace&quot;, with members of his party being threatened by communist street violence. His unpopularity among liberals and anti-fascists grew, especially after Hitler came to power in 1933. Following a second visit to Germany in 1937, Lewis changed his views and began to retract his previous political comments. He recognized the reality of Nazi treatment of Jews after a visit to Berlin in 1937. In 1939, he published an attack on anti-semitism titled &quot;The Jews, Are They Human?&quot;, which was favourably reviewed in &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot;. He also published &quot;The Hitler Cult&quot; (1939), which firmly revoked his earlier support for Hitler.

Politically, Lewis remained an isolated figure through the 1930s. In &quot;Letter to Lord Byron&quot;, W. H. Auden called Lewis &quot;that lonely old volcano of the Right.&quot; Lewis thought there was what he called a &quot;left-wing orthodoxy&quot; in Britain in the 1930s. He believed it was against Britain&#x27;s self-interest to ally with the Soviet Union, &quot;which the newspapers most of us read tell us has slaughtered out-of-hand, only a few years ago, millions of its better fed citizens, as well as its whole imperial family.&quot;

In &quot;Anglosaxony: A League that Works&quot; (1941), Lewis reflected on his earlier support for fascism:Fascism – once I understood it – left me colder than communism. The latter at least pretended, at the start, to have something to do with helping the helpless and making the world a more decent and sensible place. It does start from the human being and his suffering. Whereas fascism glorifies bloodshed and preaches that man should model himself upon the wolf.His sense that America and Canada lacked a British-type class structure had increased his opinion of liberal democracy, and in the same pamphlet, Lewis defends liberal democracy&#x27;s respect for individual freedom against its critics on both the left and right. In &quot;America and Cosmic Man&quot; (1949), Lewis argued that Franklin Delano Roosevelt had successfully managed to reconcile individual rights with the demands of the state.

== Legacy ==
In recent years, there has been renewed critical and biographical interest in Lewis and his work, and he is now regarded as a major British artist and writer of the twentieth century. Rugby School hosted an exhibition of his works in November 2007 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of his death. The National Portrait Gallery in London held a major retrospective of his portraits in 2008. Two years later, held at the Fundación Juan March (Madrid, Spain), a large exhibition (&quot;Wyndham Lewis 1882–1957&quot;) featured a comprehensive collection of Lewis&#x27;s paintings and drawings. As Tom Lubbock pointed out, it was &quot;the retrospective that Britain has never managed to get together.&quot;.

In 2010, Oxford World Classics published a critical edition of the 1928 text of &quot;Tarr&quot;, edited by Scott W. Klein of Wake Forest University. The Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University held an exhibition entitled &quot;The Vorticists: Rebel Artists in London and New York, 1914–18&quot; from 30 September 2010 through 2 January 2011. The exhibition then travelled to the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice (29 January – 15 May 2011: &quot;I Vorticisti: Artisti ribellia a Londra e New York, 1914–1918&quot;) and then to Tate Britain under the title &quot;The Vorticists: Manifesto for a Modern World&quot; between 14 June and 4 September 2011.

Several readings by Lewis are collected on &quot;The Enemy Speaks&quot;, an audiobook CD published in 2007 and featuring extracts from &quot;One Way Song&quot; and &quot;The Apes of God&quot;, as well as radio talks titled &quot;When John Bull Laughs&quot; (1938), &quot;A Crisis of Thought&quot; (1947) and &quot;The Essential Purposes of Art&quot; (1951).

A blue plaque now stands on the house in Kensington, London, where Lewis lived, No. 61 Palace Gardens Terrace.

=== Critical reception ===
In his essay &quot;Good Bad Books&quot;, George Orwell presents Lewis as the exemplary writer who is cerebral without being artistic. Orwell wrote, &quot;Enough talent to set up dozens of ordinary writers has been poured into Wyndham Lewis&#x27;s so-called novels… Yet it would be a very heavy labour to read one of these books right through. Some indefinable quality, a sort of literary vitamin, which exists even in a book like [1921 melodrama] &quot;If Winter Comes&quot;, is absent from them.&quot;

In 1932, Walter Sickert sent Lewis a telegram in which he said that Lewis&#x27;s pencil portrait of Rebecca West proved him to be &quot;the greatest portraitist of this or any other time.&quot;

==== Anti-semitism ====
For many years, Lewis&#x27;s novels have been criticised for their satirical and hostile portrayals of Jews. &quot;Tarr&quot; was revised and republished in 1928, giving a new Jewish character a key role in making sure a duel is fought. This has been interpreted as an allegorical representation of a supposed Zionist conspiracy against the West. His literary satire &quot;The Apes of God&quot; has been interpreted similarly, because many of the characters are Jewish, including the modernist author and editor Julius Ratner, a portrait which blends anti-semitic stereotype with historical literary figures John Rodker and James Joyce.

A key feature of these interpretations is that Lewis is held to have kept his conspiracy theories hidden and marginalized. Since the publication of Anthony Julius&#x27;s &quot;T. S. Eliot, Anti-Semitism, and Literary Form&quot; (1995), where Lewis&#x27;s anti-semitism is described as &quot;essentially trivial&quot;, this view is no longer taken seriously.

<text>The Lesser Antilles is a group of islands in the Caribbean Sea, forming part of the West Indies in Caribbean region of the Americas. They are distinguished from the larger islands of the Greater Antilles to the west. They form an arc which begins east of Puerto Rico at the archipelago of the Virgin Islands, swings southeast through the Leeward and Windward Islands towards South America, and turns westward through the Leeward Antilles along the Venezuelan coast. 

Most of them are part of a long, partially volcanic island arc between the Greater Antilles to the north-west and the continent of South America. The islands of the Lesser Antilles form the eastern boundary of the Caribbean Sea where it meets the Atlantic Ocean. Together, the Lesser Antilles and the Greater Antilles make up the Antilles. The Lesser and Greater Antilles, together with the Lucayan Archipelago, are collectively known as the Caribbean islands or West Indies.

The islands were dominantly Kalinago compared to the Greater Antilles which was settled by the Taíno, the boundary set between them is known as the &quot;poison arrow curtain&quot; for the Kalinago&#x27;s favoured weapon for fending off Europeans that came to conquer the islands in the 16th century.
== History before European arrival ==

=== The First Islanders ===
The earliest Archaic Age habitation is evidenced at sites like St. John and Banwari Trace in Trinidad, dating between 7700 and 6100 B.P. Artifacts from this period include stone and bone tools used for hunting and fishing. A total of 29 Archaic Age sites have been identified in Trinidad and Tobago, associated with the Ortoiroid series, divided into the Banwarian (5000–2500 BC) and Ortoiran (1500–300 BC) subseries. During the Late Archaic Age, wild plant foods became more significant, with evidence of early plant management, including crops such as maize, sweet potatoes, achira, and chili peppers had been imported and cultivated from the continent.

The archaeological record for the rest of the southern Lesser Antilles is sparse, with sites in Tobago, Barbados, and Martinique yielding potential Archaic Age artifacts. Factors like local tectonic activity and hurricanes or other storms have likely distorted the archaeological evidence in these regions. Entire islands may now be submerged. Severe erosion, landslides, and volcanic eruptions are fairly common and may contribute to the preservation of archaeological sites.

Three migration scenarios have been proposed. First, Archaic Age communities from South America reached Trinidad, Tobago, and Barbados. Second, the southern Lesser Antilles (Windward Islands) were bypassed by early settlers, with migration directly to the northern islands. Third, technological diffusion occurred without significant population movement from northeastern South America.

Chronometric data divide the Archaic Age in the northern Lesser Antilles into three phases: Early Archaic Age (3300–2600 BC), Middle Archaic Age (2600–800 BC), and Late Archaic Age (800 BC–AD 100). Coastal areas were favored for settlement, particularly for their proximity to marine resources and flint quarries. Material culture showing reliance on seafood (fish and mollusks) and terrestrial animals. Antigua and St. Martin seem to be the most heavily populated during the Archaic Age.

Notably, all known Archaic Age sites are in the northern islands, with no evidence in the Windward Islands south of Guadeloupe. Trinidad, Tobago, and Barbados are exceptions, likely colonized separately from South America. Sites in the Lesser Antilles were established on small islands and in coastal seetings; most habitations were temporary and small, suggesting annual mobility for resource procurement. Despite similarities, each site displayed differences in the consumption of marine species and variety of shell and coral tools. Each site showed diverse adaptations to locally available resources and/or activity patterns.

=== Neolithic Period ===
Archaeological findings, including Huecoid and Saladoid pottery, provide radiocarbon dates for Early Ceramic Age sites, pointing to an initial sphere of interaction between coastal South America and the northern Lesser Antilles that started around 400–200 BC. The discovery of Saladoid pottery in Puerto Rico and the northern Lesser Antilles is understood as a result of exploratory activities, cultural exchanges, and gradual migrations from the mainland during the Archaic Age. This process involved the interaction of local communities with established insular societies, creating a web of dynamic social relationships. However, debates and controversies has occurred over conflicting stratigraphic data, radiocarbon dates, and stylistic difference of the potteries.

== History after European arrival ==
The Spanish were the first Europeans to arrive on the islands with the arrival of Christopher Columbus. In 1493, on his second voyage, Columbus reached the coast of the Caribbean Sea, where he sailed to discover several islands of the Lesser Antilles archipelago. He called the first island he discovered on this trip the Deseada. The Spanish claimed the island of Dominica and took solemn possession on the land of the island they called Marigalante. They then anchored next to the island they called Guadeloupe. Later they visited Montserrat, Antigua and San Cristobal. They then crossed the archipelago of the Eleven Thousand Virgins.

Over the next centuries, the Spanish, French, Dutch, Danish and English fought over several of the islands.

Pierre Belain d&#x27;Esnambuc was a French merchant and adventurer in the Caribbean, who established the first permanent French colony, Saint-Pierre, on the island of Martinique in 1635. Belain sailed to the Caribbean in 1625, hoping to establish a French settlement on the island of St Christopher (St Kitts). In 1626 the French under Pierre Belain d&#x27;Esnambuc began to take an interest in Guadeloupe, driving out the Spanish colonists.

Martinique was mapped by Columbus in 1493, but Spain had little interest in the territory. Christopher Columbus landed on 15 June 1502 after 21 days of crossing with trade winds, his fastest oceanic journey. In 1635, Spain had ceded Martinique to France after 133 years of Spanish control that was once discovered by Columbus. On 15 September 1635, Pierre Belain d&#x27;Esnambuc, the French governor of the island of San Cristóbal, landed in the port of San Pedro with 80–150 French settlers after being expelled from San Cristóbal by the English. D&#x27;Esnambuc claimed Martinique for the French King Louis XIII and the &quot;Compagnie des Îles de l&#x27;Amérique&quot;.

Margarita Island in present-day Venezuela was discovered on 15 August 1498 during Columbus&#x27; third voyage. On that trip the Admiral would also discover the mainland, Venezuela. On that August day, Columbus spotted three islands, two of them small, low and arid (the present day Coche and Cubagua),

The province of Trinidad was created in the 16th century by the Spanish, and its capital was San José de Oruña. But during the Napoleonic Wars, in February 1797, a British force began occupying the territory. And in 1802 Spain recognized the British sovereignty.

In 1917 the United States bought the Danish Virgin Islands. Most of the British colonies became independent states, the islands of the Lesser Antilles belonging to Venezuela were divided into 2 different entities the State of Nueva Esparta and the Federal Dependencies (1938). In 1986 Aruba seceded from the Netherlands Antilles, officially becoming a country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. In 2010 the rest of the Netherlands Antilles was dissolved to form smaller entities.

On July 18, 1995, the previously dormant Soufrière Hills volcano on the southern part of the island of Montserrat became active. The eruptions destroyed the Georgian-era capital of Montserrat, Plymouth. Between 1995 and 2000, two-thirds of the island&#x27;s population was forced to flee, mainly to the UK, leaving less than 1200 people on the island in 1997 (rising to almost 5000 by 2016).

The two official French overseas departments are Guadeloupe and Martinique. St. Martin and St. Barthélemy, formerly part of the department of Guadeloupe, have had a separate status as overseas entities since 2007.

== Geography ==
The islands of the Lesser Antilles are divided into three groups: the Windward Islands in the south, the Leeward Islands in the north, and the Leeward Antilles in the west.

The Windward Islands are so called because they were more windward to sailing ships arriving in the New World than the Leeward Islands, given that the prevailing trade winds blow east to west. The trans-Atlantic currents and winds that provided the fastest route across the ocean brought these ships to the rough dividing line between the Windward and Leeward Islands.

The Leeward Antilles consist of the Dutch ABC islands just off the coast of Venezuela, plus a group of Venezuelan islands.

== Geological formation ==
The Lesser Antilles more or less coincide with the outer cliff of the Caribbean Plate. Many of the islands were formed as a result of the subduction of oceanic crust of the Atlantic Plate under the Caribbean Plate in the Lesser Antilles subduction zone. This process is ongoing and is responsible not only for many of the islands, but also for volcanic and earthquake activity in the region. The islands along the South American coast are largely the result of the interaction of the South American Plate and the Caribbean Plate which is mainly strike-slip, but includes a component of compression.

Geologically, the Lesser Antilles island arc stretches from Grenada in the south to Anguilla in the north. The Virgin Islands and Sombrero Island are geologically part of the Greater Antilles, while Trinidad is part of South America and Tobago is the remainder of a separate island arc. The Leeward Antilles are also a separate island arc, which is accreting to South America.

== Political divisions ==
The Lesser Antilles are divided into eight independent nations and numerous dependent and non-sovereign states (which are politically associated with the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, and the United States). Over one third of the total area and population of the Lesser Antilles lies within Trinidad and Tobago, a sovereign nation comprising the two southernmost islands of the Windward Island chain.

<doc id="160660" wikidata="Q204095" url="?curid=160660" title="Bogomilism">
<text>Bogomilism (; ; ) was a Christian neo-Gnostic, dualist sect founded in the First Bulgarian Empire by the priest Bogomil during the reign of Tsar Peter I in the 10th century. It most probably arose in the region of Kutmichevitsa, today part of the region of Macedonia.

The Bogomils were dualists or Gnostics in that they believed in a world within the body and a world outside the body. They did not use the Christian cross, nor build churches, as they revered their gifted form and considered their body to be the temple. This gave rise to many forms of practice to cleanse oneself through fasting or dancing.

The Bogomils rejected the ecclesiastical hierarchy. Their primary political tendencies were resistance to the state and church authorities. This helped the movement spread quickly in the Balkans, gradually expanding throughout the Byzantine Empire and later reaching Kievan Rus&#x27;, Dalmatia, Serbia, Bosnia, Italy, and France (Cathars).

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;Bogomil&quot; in free translation means &quot;dear to God&quot;, and is a compound of the Slavic words for &quot;god&quot; (Common Slavic: ) and &quot;dear&quot; (Common Slavic: *milъ). It may be also a translation of the Greek name &quot;Theophilos&quot;, literally &quot;dear to God; loved by the gods,&quot; from &quot;theos&quot; &quot;god&quot; + &quot;philos&quot; &quot;loved, beloved&quot;. It is difficult to ascertain whether the name was taken from the reputed founder of that movement, the priest Bogomil, or whether he assumed that name after it had been given to the sect itself. The word is an Old Church Slavonic calque of &quot;Massaliani&quot;, the Syriac name of the sect corresponding to the Greek Euchites. The Bogomils are identified with the Messalians in Greek and Slavonic documents from the 12th–14th centuries.

The members are referred to as &quot;Babuni&quot; in Church Slavonic documents, which originally meant &quot;superstition; superstitious person&quot; (Common Slavic: &quot;&quot;). Toponyms which retain the name include the river Babuna, the mountain Babuna, the Bogomila Waterfall and village Bogomila, all in the region of Azot, today in central North Macedonia, suggesting that the movement was very active in the region.

==Sources==

Much of their literature has been lost or destroyed by the contemporary Christian Churches. The earliest description of the Bogomils is in a letter from Patriarch Theophylact of Bulgaria to Peter I of Bulgaria. The main source of doctrinal information is the work of Euthymius Zigabenus, who says that they believe that God created man&#x27;s soul but matter was the invention of Satan, God&#x27;s older son, who in seducing Eve lost his creative power. Concerning the Bogomils, something can be gathered from the polemic &quot;Against the Newly-Appeared Heresy of the Bogomils&quot; written in Slavonic by Cosmas the Priest, a 10th-century Bulgarian official. The old Slavonic lists of forbidden books of the 15th and 16th century also give us a clue to the discovery of this heretical literature and of the means the Bogomils employed to carry on their teachings. Much may also be learned from the doctrines of the numerous variations of Bogomilism which spread in Medieval Kievan Rus&#x27; after the 11th century.

==History==
===Paulicians===

One of the earliest Christian dualist sects, Marcionism, originated in Armenia (in the eastern part of present Turkey). The church Marcion himself established appeared to die out around the 5th century, although similarities between Marcionism and Paulicianism, a sect in the same geographical area, indicate that Marcionist elements may have survived. Paulicianism began in the mid-7th century, when Constantine of Mananalis, basing his message solely on his personal interpretation of the New Testament, began to teach that there were two gods: a good god who had made men&#x27;s souls, and an evil god who had created the entire physical universe including the human body. His followers, who became known as Paulicians, were not marked by extreme deviance in lifestyle compared to contemporaries, despite their belief that the world was evil, and were renowned as good fighting men.

However, it is not certain that the Paulicians were Dualistic, as in the Key of Truth it is said that: &quot;The Paulicians are not dualists in any other sense than the New Testament is itself dualistic. Satan is simply the adversary of man and God&quot;.

In 970, the Byzantine emperor John I Tzimiskes transplanted 200,000 Armenian Paulicians to Europe and settled them in the neighbourhood of Philippopolis (today&#x27;s Plovdiv, Bulgaria). Under Byzantine and then later Ottoman rule, the Armenian Paulicians lived in relative safety in their ancient stronghold near Philippopolis, and further northward. Linguistically, they were assimilated into the Bulgarians, by whom they were called &quot;pavlikiani&quot; (the Byzantine Greek word for Paulician). In 1650, the Roman Catholic Church gathered them into its fold. Fourteen villages near Nicopolis, in Moesia, embraced Catholicism, as well as the villages around Philippopolis. A colony of Paulicians in the Wallachian village of near Bucharest also followed the example of their brethren across the Danube.

===Origins===
The Gnostic social-religious movement and doctrine originated in the time of Peter I of Bulgaria (927–969), alleged in the modern day to be a reaction against state and clerical oppression of the Byzantine church. In spite of all measures of repression, it remained strong and popular until the fall of the Second Bulgarian Empire in the end of the 14th century. Bogomilism was an outcome of many factors that had arisen in the beginning of the 10th century, most probably in the region of Macedonia. It was also strongly influenced by the Paulicians who had been driven out of Armenia.

=== Spread of Bogomilism in the Balkans ===

Slav peasantry in parts of Bulgaria were very likely the first to come into in closer contact with Bogomilism and the young Bulgarian church was aware of the danger. Pope Nicholas I warns Boris I of the danger of false teachings but he was not specific about heresy as such. Bogomilism was a native Slavic sect from the middle of the 10th century began to flourish while the Theophylact of Constantinople warned Peter I against this new heresy.
The Bogomils spread westwards and settled in Serbia, where they were to be known as Babuns (&quot;Babuni&quot;). At the end of the 12th century, Serbian Grand Prince Stefan Nemanja and the Serbian council deemed Bogomilism a heresy, and expelled them from the country. Large numbers, the majority of whom were of Vlach origin, took refuge in Bosnia and Dalmatia where they were known under the name of Patarenes (&quot;Patareni&quot;).

In the time of Samuel, Bogomilism spread into Serbia and Bosnia. The most active area became west Bosnia, centred on the valley of the River Bosna. In the province of Hum (modern Herzegovina) the Bogomils were also strong, in the cities of Split and Trogir Bogomils were numerous but later they took refuge in Bosnia. 
Providing refuge to those labeled heretics, including Bogomils, was a recurrent pretext for Hungarian rulers to declare crusades against Bosnia and extend their influence in the region. A first Hungarian complaint to the Pope was averted by the public abjuration of the Bosnian ruler Ban Kulin, whose sister was married to Miroslav of Hum, in 1203. A second Hungarian crusade against Bosnia on the pretext of Bogomil heresy was launched in 1225, but failed. In 1254, rebelling against the Papal order to accept a Hungarian bishop, the Bosnian Church chose the schism. In the following centuries, the Bosnian Church and the heretic sect of the Bogomils came to be identified with each other, due to the scarcity of documents after the Ottoman conquest.

In 1203, Pope Innocent III, with the aid of the King of Hungary, forced an agreement of Kulin to acknowledge Papal authority and religion, but in practice this was ignored. On the death of Kulin in 1216, a mission was sent to convert Bosnia to Rome but failed. In 1234, the Catholic Bishop of Bosnia was removed by Pope Gregory IX for allowing heretical practices. In addition, Gregory called on the Hungarian king to crusade against the heretics. However, Bosnian nobles were able to expel the Hungarians.

In 1252, Pope Innocent IV decided to put Bosnia&#x27;s bishop under the Hungarian Kalocsa jurisdiction. Such decision provoked the schism of the Bosnian Christians, who refused to submit to the Hungarians and broke off their relations with Rome. In that way, an autonomous Bosnian Church came into being, in which some later saw a Bogomil or Cathar Church, while in reality no trace of Bogomilism, Catharism or dualism can be found in the original documents of the Bosnian &quot;Krstjani,&quot; as they called themselves.

It was not until Pope Nicholas&#x27; Bull &quot;Prae cunctis&quot; in 1291 that the Dominican-led inquisition was imposed on Bosnia. The Inquisition reported of the existence of a dualist sect in Bosnia in the late 15th century and called them &quot;Bosnian heretics&quot;, but this sect was most likely not the same as the Bosnian Church.

Bogomilism was eradicated in Bulgaria, Rascia (a Serbian medieval state) and Byzantium in the 13th century, but some smaller elements survived in Hum (present day Herzegovina) and Bosnia until the Ottoman Empire gained control of the region in 1463. Some scholars, who sought certain ideological backgrounds and justifications for their political narratives, argue that both Catholics and Orthodox persecuted the Bogomils as heretics and according to them, the pressures drew Bosnia to Bogomilism. It has purportedly been said that, with the introduction of Ottoman rule, Bosnians were often more likely to convert to Islam since some of them were not adherents of either the Roman Catholic or Serb Orthodox churches. However, these claims have been rejected by some as an anachronism from the Austro-Hungarian era.

From Bosnia, their influence extended into Italy (Piedmont). The Hungarians undertook many crusades against the heretics in Bosnia, but towards the close of the 15th century, the conquest of that country by the Turks put an end to their persecution. Few or no remnants of Bogomilism have survived in Bosnia. The Ritual in Slavonic written by the Bosnian Radoslav, and published in vol. xv. of the &quot;Starine of the South Slavonic Academy at Agram&quot;, shows great resemblance to the Cathar ritual published by Cunitz, 1853.

There are still over ten thousand Banat Bulgarians in Banat today in the villages of Dudeştii Vechi, Vinga, Breştea and also in the city of Timișoara, with a few in Arad; however, they no longer practice Bogomilism, having converted to Roman Catholicism. There are also a few villages of Paulicians in the Serbian part of Banat, especially the villages of Ivanovo and Belo Blato, near Pančevo.

=== Social factors ===
The gradual Christianization of the Bulgarian population, the fact that the service was initially practiced in Greek, which only the elite knew, resulted in a low level of understanding of the religion among the peasantry. Due to the constant wars during the time of Tsar Simeon I, the lands near the Byzantine border (Thrace) were devastated, and the people living there were left without occupation. The constant change of authority over these lands, and the higher taxes during the time of Tsar Peter I, gave birth to a great social discontent at the beginning of the 10th century. Moreover, the corruption of the church as an institution led to grave disappointment among its recently converted flock.

=== Religious factors ===
The existence of older Christian heresies in the Bulgarian lands (Manichaeism and Paulicianism), which were considered very dualistic, influenced the Bogomil movement. Manichaeism&#x27;s origin is related to Zoroastrianism; that is why Bogomilism is sometimes indirectly connected to Zoroastrianism in the sense of its duality.

=== Connections to the royal court ===
Most probably, as Samuil of Bulgaria revolted against the Byzantine Empire, he relied on the popular support of the movement. There are no sources of Bogomil persecution during his reign (976–1014).

== Doctrine ==

From the imperfect and conflicting data that is available, one positive result can be gathered that the Bogomils may have been gnostics, adoptionists or dualists.

Their dualism was initially moderate (or &quot;monarchian&quot;): according to their teachings, God created and rules the spiritual part of the world, and Satan the material, but Satan is ultimately inferior to God and his side by virtue of being God&#x27;s son. However, Bogomils were not quite free from the absolute dualism of Manichaeism and Paulicianism, and over time adopted an absolute position too, believing God and Satan as eternal opponents, similar to the one maintained by the posterior Cathars.

Their adoptionist teaching apparently came from Paul of Samosata (though at a later period the name of Paul was believed to be that of the Apostle). They rejected the Christianity of the Orthodox churches, though did not accept the docetic teaching of some of the other gnostic sects. They also opposed established forms of government and church, alike to later Christian anarchist beliefs.

In the Bogomil and Cathar text &quot;The Secret Supper&quot; Jesus calls God his father and it says that Mary received Jesus through the Holy Spirit.

Bogomils have been accused of believing that John the Baptist comes from Satan in the Book of Boril.

Supporters of the Baptist successionism theory argue that allegations of Bogomil doctrines are largely false, due to most sources being hostile.

===Source texts===
Possible source texts for Bogomil doctrine include:

* The Bulgarian priest Jeremiah&#x27;s &quot;The Story of the Cross-tree&quot; and &quot;The Prayer Against Fever&quot;
* Book of the Secret Supper, which was wrongly described by inquisitors as similar to the Apocryphon of John
* Vision of Isaiah (according to Euthymius Zigabenus)

Bogomils accepted the four Gospels, fourteen Epistles of Paul, the three Epistles of John, James, Jude, and an Epistle to the Laodiceans, which they professed to have. They sowed the seeds of a rich, popular religious literature in the East as well as the West. The Historiated Bible, the Letter from Heaven, the Wanderings through Heaven and Hell, the numerous Adam and Cross legends, the religious poems of the &quot;Kalēki perehozhie&quot; and other similar productions owe their dissemination to a large extent to the activity of the Bogomils of Bulgaria, and their successors in other lands. The Bogomils also made use of many apocryphal writings, such as Apocalypse of Abraham, 2 Enoch, and the Vision of Isaiah.

=== Cosmology ===
In their original Monarchian dualist story, Bogomils taught that God had two sons, the elder Satanail and the younger Michael. Satanail rebelled against the father and became an evil spirit. He created the lower heavens and the Earth and tried in vain to create man, though in the end he had to appeal to God for the Spirit. After creation, Adam was allowed to till the ground on condition that he sold himself and his posterity to the owner of the Earth, Satanail.

In order to free Adam and his offspring, Michael was sent in the form of a man, becoming identified with Jesus Christ, and was &quot;elected&quot; by God after the baptism in the Jordan. When the Holy Ghost appeared in the shape of the dove, Jesus received power to break the covenant in the form of a clay tablet (&quot;hierographon&quot;) held by Satanail from Adam. He had now become the angel Michael in a human form, and as such he vanquished Satanail, and deprived him of the suffix &quot;il&quot; (meaning &quot;God&quot;), in which his power resided. Satanail was thus transformed into Satan. However, through Satan&#x27;s machinations the crucifixion took place, and Satan was the originator of the whole Orthodox community with its churches, vestments, ceremonies, sacraments and fasts, with its monks and priests. This world being the work of Satan, the perfect must eschew any and every excess of its pleasure, though not so far as asceticism.

They held the &quot;Lord&#x27;s Prayer&quot; in high respect as the most potent weapon against Satan, and had a number of conjurations against &quot;evil spirits&quot;. Each community had its own twelve &quot;apostles&quot;, and women could be raised to the rank of &quot;elect&quot;. The Bogomils wore garments like those of mendicant friars and were known as enthusiastic missionaries, travelling far and wide to propagate their doctrines. Healing the sick and exorcising evil spirits, they traversed different countries and spread their apocryphal literature along with some of the books of the Old Testament, deeply influencing the religious spirit of the nations and preparing them for the Reformation.

=== Christology and the Trinity ===
For Bogomils, &quot;the Logos was not the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity, the Eternal Word incarnate, but merely the spoken word of God, shown in the oral teaching of Christ&quot;. Although Bogomils regarded themselves as &quot;Trinitarian&quot;, anathemas against Bogomils (circa 1027) charge Bogomils with rejection of the Trinity. In the Bogomil and Cathar text &quot;The Secret Supper&quot; the book starts with: &quot;In the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.&quot;

=== Opposition to institutions and materialism ===
The Catholic Church considered Bogomilism a heresy due to the duality in the Bogomil cosmogony, wherein the earthly sinful corporeal life is a creation of Satan, an angel that was sent to Earth.

Karp Strigolnik, who in the 14th century preached the doctrine in Novgorod, explained that St. Paul had taught that simpleminded men should instruct one another; therefore they elected their &quot;teachers&quot; from among themselves to be their spiritual guides, and had no special priests. There is a tradition that the Bogomils taught that prayers were to be said in private houses, not in separate buildings such as churches. Ordination was conferred by the congregation and not by any specially appointed minister. The congregation were the &quot;elect&quot;, and each member could obtain the perfection of Christ and become a Christ or &quot;Chlist&quot;. Marriage was not a sacrament. Bogomils refused to fast on Mondays and Fridays, and they rejected monasticism. They declared Christ to be the Son of God only through grace like other prophets, and that the bread and wine of the eucharist were not physically transformed into flesh and blood; that the last judgement would be executed by God and not by Jesus; that the images and the cross were idols and the veneration of saints and relics idolatry.

These doctrines have survived in the great Russian sects, and can be traced back to the teachings and practice of the Bogomils. But in addition to these doctrines of an adoptionist origin, they held the Manichaean dualistic conception of the origin of the world. This has been partly preserved in some of their literary remains, and has taken deep root in the beliefs and traditions of Balkan nations with substantial Bogomil followings. The chief literature of all the heretical sects throughout the ages has been that of apocryphal Biblical narratives, and the popes Jeremiah or Bogumil are directly mentioned as authors of such forbidden books &quot;which no orthodox dare read&quot;. Though these writings are mostly of the same origin as those from the older lists of apocryphal books, they underwent a modification at the hands of their Bogomil editors, so as to be useful for the propagation of their own specific doctrines.

In its most simple and attractive form—invested with the authority of the reputed holy author—their account of the creation of the world and of man, the origin of sin and redemption, the history of the Cross, and the disputes between body and soul, right and wrong, heaven and hell, were embodied either in &quot;Historiated Bibles&quot; (Paleya) or in special dialogues held between Christ and his disciples, or between renowned Fathers of the Church who expounded these views in a simple manner adapted to the understanding of the people (Lucidaria).

== Legacy ==
=== Link with later religious movements ===
The Bogomils were the connecting link between both Eastern and Western sects considered heretical. They were also the most active in disseminating &quot;heretical&quot; teachings in the Kievan Rus&#x27; and other European kingdoms. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the Bogomils were already known in the West as &quot;Cathars&quot; or as &quot;Bulgari&quot;, i.e. Bulgarians (българи). In 1207 the &quot;Bulgarorum heresis&quot; is mentioned. In 1223, the Albigenses are declared to be the local Bougres, and in the same period mention is made of the &quot;Pope of the Albigenses who resided within the confines of Bulgaria&quot; (see also Nicetas, Bogomil bishop). Groups such as the Cathars, Patarenes, Waldenses, Anabaptists, and the Russian Strigolniki, and Spiritual Christians, have all, at different times, been either identified with the Bogomils or closely linked with them, despite several being unrelated and/or non-dualistic.

In the 14th century, when the Hesychast controversy broke out, the doctrine of hesychasm was accused of being a variant of Bogomilism by a section of Byzantine academics. 

Considerable scholarly debate has arisen about the exact relationship between dualist groups that arose in different times and places across medieval Europe, questioning whether it was indeed a single movement or belief system which was spread from one region to the next, or if it was multiple movements which arose independently across Europe. Furthering this confusion is that many medieval sources themselves, such as the 13th century Papal Inquisition in France, would often simply assume that all dualistic groups were directly connected to previous movements, regardless of location. Inquistors often described 13th century Cathars as a direct outgrowth of surviving Manichean dualists from previous centuries—though by the same logic, Inquisitors who encountered pagan religions on the edges of the Christian world (Such as those encountered in the Baltic Crusades or the missionary efforts in Ireland) would directly accuse non-Christians of worshiping &quot;Apollo and Mercury&quot;, simply applying previous terms and rhetoric to new contexts in which they didn&#x27;t accurately apply. Thus medieval scholarship is divided over whether the &quot;Cathars&quot; actually were an offshoot of the &quot;Bogomils&quot;, or if the 13th century Inquisition itself simply mistook or conflated &quot;Cathars&quot; for &quot;Bogomils&quot;, due to their known tendency for conflation and confusion.
A remarkable number of necropolises are found in this part of Europe, conveying an exceptional testimony to medieval European artistic and archaeological heritage. Majority of these necropolises with decorated tombstones were held by Bogomil Vlachs.

===In modern and popular culture===
In &quot;Foucault&#x27;s Pendulum&quot;, a novel by the Italian philosopher and writer Umberto Eco, the plot concerning a widespread secret and mystic conspiracy has its ground in the disappearance of the Bogomils after the fall of the Second Bulgarian Empire under the rule of the Ottoman Empire.

&quot;The Secret Book&quot; is a Macedonian feature film combining the detective, thriller and conspiracy fiction genres, based on a fictional story of the quest for the original Slavic language &quot;Secret Book&quot;, written by the Bogomils in Macedonia and carried to Western Europe during the Middle Ages.

A French (and, consequently, an English) word emerged based on twisted perceptions of the Bogomils by the Catholic Church. The words &quot;bouguer&quot; and &quot;buggery&quot; emerged, by way of the word &quot;bougre&quot; in French, from the Latin &quot;Bulgarus&quot; (Bulgarian). &quot;Buggery&quot; first appears in English in 1330 with the sense &quot;abominable heresy&quot;, though &quot;bugger&quot; in a sexual sense is not recorded until 1555. The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology&quot; quotes a similar form—&quot;bowgard&quot; (and &quot;bouguer&quot;), but claims that the Bulgarians were heretics &quot;as belonging to the Greek Church, sp. Albigensian&quot;. &quot;Webster&#x27;s Third New International Dictionary&quot; gives the only meaning of the word &quot;bugger&quot; as sodomite, &quot;from the adherence of the Bulgarians to the Eastern Church considered heretical&quot;.

Bogomil Cove on Rugged Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, is named after Priest Bogomil.

The Bogomils make a significant part in the Thomas Pynchon novel &quot;Against the Day&quot;, when Cyprian Lakewood becomes a postulant and gives up his life of sodomitic servitude as a spy.

In Olga Tokarczuk&#x27;s novel &quot;The Books of Jacob&quot;, the character Antoni Kossakowski (Moliwda) lives in a Bogomil aligned community.

<doc id="160661" wikidata="Q6857661" url="?curid=160661" title="Military history of the Philippines">
<text>The military history of the Philippines is characterized by wars between Philippine kingdoms and its neighbors in the precolonial era and then a period of struggle against colonial powers such as Spain and the United States, occupation by the Empire of Japan during World War II and participation in Asian conflicts post-World War II such as the Korean War and the Vietnam War. The Philippines has also battled a communist insurgency and a secessionist movement by Muslims in the southern portion of the country.

==Prehistoric period (before 1000 BC – 900 AD)==
Negritos were among the archipelago&#x27;s earliest inhabitants, descendants of the first human migrations out of Africa via the coastal route along southern Asia to the now sunken landmasses of Sundaland and Sahul area around 48,000 to 5000 BC. The first Austronesians reached the Philippines at around 2200 BC, settling the Batanes Islands and northern Luzon. From there, they rapidly spread downward to the rest of the islands of the Philippines. They assimilated earlier Negritos that arrived during the Paleolithic, resulting in the modern Filipino ethnic groups that all display various ratios of genetic admixture between Austronesian and Negrito groups.

By 1000 BC, the inhabitants of the Philippine archipelago had developed into four distinct kinds of peoples: tribal groups, such as the Aetas, Ilongots and the Mangyan who depended on hunter-gathering and were concentrated in forests; warrior societies, such as the Isneg and Kalinga who practiced social ranking and ritualized warfare and roamed the plains; the petty plutocracy of the Ifugao Cordillera Highlanders, who occupied the mountain ranges of Luzon; and the harbor principalities of the estuarine civilizations such as the Tagalogs, Visayans, Taūsugs, Maranaos and the Maguindanaons that grew along rivers and seashores while participating in trans-island maritime trade. It was also during the first millennium BC that early metallurgy was said to have reached the archipelagos of maritime Southeast Asia via trade with India.

==Pre-colonial period (900 AD to 1565)==


===Ma-i and Bruneian alliance against China===

By the 800s, British Historian Robert Nicholl citing Arab chronicler Al Ya&#x27;akubi, had written that on those years, the kingdoms of Muja (Then Pagan Brunei/Vijayapura) and Mayd (Ma-i) waged war against the Chinese Empire.

===Kedatuan of Madja-as against Chola Occupied Srivijaya===
In the aftermath of the Indian Chola invasion of Srivijaya (1025 AD), &quot;Datu Puti&quot; led some dissident datus from Borneo (including present day Brunei which then was the location of the Vijayapura state which was a local colony of the Hindu-Buddhist Srivijaya empire) and Sumatra in a rebellion against Rajah Makatunao, who was a Chola-appointed local rajah. This oral legend of ancient Hiligaynons rebelling against Rajah Makatunao have corroboration in Chinese records during the Song dynasty when Chinese scholars recorded that the ruler during a February 1082 AD diplomatic meeting, was Seri Maharaja, and his descendant was Rajah Makatunao and was together with Sang Aji (grandfather to Sultan Muhammad Shah). According to the Maragtas the dissidents against new Rajah&#x27;s rule and their retinue, tried to revive Srivijaya in a new country called Madja-as in the Visayas islands (an archipelago named after Srivijaya) in the Philippines. Seeing how the actual Srivijayan Empire reached even the outer coast of Borneo, which is already neighboring the Philippines, Historian Robert Nicholl implied that the Srivijayans of Sumatra, Vijayans of Vijayapura at Brunei-Sarawak, and the Visayans in the Philippines were all related and connected to each other since they form one contiguous area.

According to Augustinian Friar, Rev. Fr. Santaren, Datu Macatunao or Rajah Makatunao is the &quot;sultan of the Moros,&quot; and a relative of Datu Puti who seized the properties and riches of the ten datus. Robert Nicholls, a historian from Brunei identified Rajah Tugao, the leader of the Malano Kingdom of Sarawak, as the Rajah Makatunao referred to in the Maragtas. The Bornean warriors Labaodungon and Paybare, after learning of this injustice from their father-in-law Paiburong, sailed to Odtojan in Borneo where Makatunaw ruled. Using local soldiers recruited from the Philippines as well as fellow pioneers, the warriors sacked the city, killed Makatunaw and his family, retrieved the stolen properties of the 10 datus, enslaved the remaining population of Odtojan, and sailed back to Panay. Labaw Donggon and his wife, Ojaytanayon, later settled in a place called Moroboro. Afterwards there are descriptions of various towns founded by the datus in Panay, other Visayan islands, and southern Luzon.

===Champa-Sulu War===
The Chams who migrated to Sulu were called Orang Dampuan. The Champa civilization and the port-kingdom of Sulu engaged in commerce with each other which resulted in merchant Chams settling in Sulu where they were known as Orang Dampuan from the 10th to 13th century. The Orang Dampuan were slaughtered by envious native Sulu Buranuns due to the wealth of the Orang Dampuan. The Buranun were then subjected to retaliatory slaughter by the Orang Dampuan. Harmonious commerce between Sulu and the Orang Dampuan was later restored. The Yakans were descendants of the Taguima-based Orang Dampuan who came to Sulu from Champa. Sulu received civilization in its Indic form from the Orang Dampuan.

===Visayan raids against China===
Antecedent to these raids, sometime between A.D. 1174 and 1190, a traveling Chinese government bureaucrat Chau Ju-Kua reported that a certain group of &quot;ferocious raiders of China&#x27;s Fukien coast&quot; which he called the &quot;Pi-sho-ye&quot;, believed to have lived on the southern part of Formosa.

In A.D. 1273, another work written by Ma Tuan Lin, which came to the knowledge of non-Chinese readers through a translation made by the Marquis D&#x27;Hervey de Saint-Denys, gave reference to the &quot;Pi-sho-ye&quot; raiders, thought to have originated from the southern portion of Formosa. However, the author observed that these raiders spoke a different language and had an entirely different appearance (presumably when compared to the inhabitants of Formosa). Some scholars have put forth the theory that the Pi-sho-ye were actually people from the Visayas islands. Furthermore, Boholano oral legends say that people from the Kedatuan of Dapitan were the ones that lead the raids on China.

===Pon-i Invasion of Philippine Kingdoms===
During the 12th century, then-Hindu Brunei called &quot;Pon-i&quot;, as reported in the Chinese annals &quot;Nanhai zhi&quot;, invaded Malilu 麻裏蘆 (present-day Manila) as it also administered Sarawak and Sabah, as well as the Philippine kingdoms Butuan, Sulu, Ma-i (Mindoro), Shahuchong 沙胡重 (present-day Siocon), Yachen 啞陳 (Oton), and 文杜陵 Wenduling (present-day Mindanao). Manila regained independence.

===War between Sulu and Majapahit===
In the mid 14th century, the Majapahit empire mentioned in its manuscript &quot;Nagarakretagama&quot; Canto 14, written by Prapanca in 1365, that the area of Solot (Sulu) was part of the empire. &quot;Nagarakretagama&quot; was composed as a eulogy for their emperor Hayam Wuruk. However, Chinese sources then report that in 1369, the Sulus regained independence and in vengeance, assaulted Majapahit and its province, &quot;Po-ni&quot; (Brunei) which Majapahit invaded, looting it of treasure and gold. A fleet from the Majapahit capital succeeded in driving away the Sulus, but &quot;Po-ni&quot; was left weaker after the attack and the Majapahit collaborating Pon-i royalty have to deal with the theft of two sacred pearls by Sulu. The Majapahit Empire, attempted to reconquer the kingdoms of Sulu and Manila but they were permanently repulsed. Furthermore, the Sulus counter-invaded deep into Majapahit held East Kalimantan and North Kalimantan

===War between the Moros and Cebu===

During the early 1400s, Rajamuda Sri Lumay, a Chola dynasty prince who rebelled against the Cholas and sided with his Malay subjects established an independent Tamil-Malay Indianized kingdom in Cebu called the Rajahnate of Cebu, he established his country by waging scorched earth tactics against raiders from Mindanao. War between the Muslims and Cebu lasted until the Spanish era.

===Brunei&#x27;s invasion of Tondo, incorporation of Sulu and establishment of Manila===
The Battle of Manila (1500s) was fought in Manila between citizens of the Kingdom of Tondo led by their Lakan, Sukwu and the soldiers of the Sultanate of Brunei led by Sultan Bolkiah the singing captain. The aftermath of the battle was the formation of an alliance between the newly established Kingdom of Maynila (Selurong) and the Sultanate of Brunei, to crush the power of the Kingdom of Tondo and the subsequent installation of the Pro-Islamic Rajah Sulaiman into power. Furthermore, Sultan Bolkiah&#x27;s victory over Sulu and Seludong (modern day Manila), as well as his marriages to Laila Mecanai the daughter of Sulu Sultan Amir Ul-Ombra (an uncle of Sharifa Mahandun married to Nakhoda Angging or Maharaja Anddin of Sulu), and to the daughter of Datu Kemin, widened Brunei&#x27;s influence in the Philippines.

===Territorial conflict between Manila and Tondo===
According to the account of Rajah Matanda as recalled by Magellan expedition members Gines de Mafra, Rodrigo de Aganduru Moriz, and expedition scribe Antonio Pigafetta, Maynila had a territorial conflict with Tondo in the years before 1521.

At the time, Rajah Matanda&#x27;s mother (whose name was not mentioned in the accounts) served as the paramount ruler of the Maynila polity, taking over from Rajah Matanda&#x27;s father (also unnamed in the accounts), who had died when Rajah Matanda was still very young. Rajah Matanda, then simply known as the &quot;Young Prince&quot; Ache, was raised alongside his cousin, who was ruler of Tondo – presumed by some to be a young Bunao Lakandula, although not specifically named in the accounts.

During this time, Ache realized that his cousin, who was ruler of the Tondo polity, was &quot;slyly&quot; taking advantage of Ache&#x27;s mother by taking over territory belonging to Maynila. When Ache asked his mother for permission to address the matter, his mother refused, encouraging the young prince to keep his peace instead. Prince Ache could not accept this and thus left Maynila with some of his father&#x27;s trusted men, to go to his &quot;grandfather&quot;, the Sultan of Brunei, to ask for assistance. The Sultan responded by giving Ache a position as commander of his naval force.

In 1521, Prince Ache was coming fresh from a military victory at the helm of the Bruneian navy and was supposedly on his way back to Maynila with the intent of confronting his cousin when he came upon and attacked the remnants of the Magellan expedition, then under the command of Sebastian Elcano. Some historians suggest that Ache&#x27;s decision to attack must have been influenced by a desire to expand his fleet even further as he made his way back to Lusong and Maynila, where he could use the size of his fleet as leverage against his cousin, the ruler of Tondo.

===Battle of Mactan===

The Battle of Mactan on April 27, 1521, is celebrated as the earliest reported resistance of the natives in the Philippines against western invaders. Lapu-Lapu, a Chieftain of Mactan Island, defeated Christian European explorers led by the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan.

On March 16, 1521, the island of Samar was sighted. The following morning, March 17, Magellan landed on the island of Homonhon. He parleyed with Rajah Calambu of Limasawa, who guided him to Cebu Island on April 7. With the aid of Magellan&#x27;s Malay interpreter, Enrique, Rajah Humabon of Cebu and his subjects converted to Christianity and became allies. Suitably impressed by Spanish firearms and artillery, Rajah Humabon suggested that Magellan project power to cow Lapu-Lapu, who was being belligerent against his authority.

Magellan deployed 49 armored men, less than half his crew, with crossbows and guns, but could not anchor near land because the island is surrounded by shallow coral bottoms and thus unsuitable for the Spanish galleons to get close to shore. His crew had to wade through the surf to make a landing and the ship was too far to support them with artillery. Antonio Pigafetta, a on the voyage who later returned to Seville, Spain, records that Lapu-Lapu had at least 1500 warriors in the battle. During the battle, Magellan was wounded in the leg, while still in the surf. As the crew were fleeing to the boats, Pigafetta recorded that Magellan covered their retreat, turning at them on several occasions to make sure they were getting away, and was finally surrounded by a multitude of warriors and killed. The total toll was of eight crewmen killed on Magellan&#x27;s side against an unknown number of casualties from the Mactan natives.

===The Kedatuan of Dapitan vs the Ternate and Lanao Sultanates===

By 1563, before the full Spanish colonization agenda came to Bohol, the Kedatuan of Dapitan was at war with the Sultanate of Ternate, a Papuan speaking Muslim state in the Moluccas, which was also raiding the Rajahnate of Butuan. At the time, Dapitan was ruled by two brothers named Dalisan and Pagbuaya. The Ternateans at the time were allied to the Portuguese. Dapitan was destroyed by Ternateans and Datu Dalisan was killed in battle. His brother, Datu Pagbuaya, together with his people fled to Mindanao and established a new Dapitan in the northern coast of the Zamboanga peninsula and displaced its Muslim natives. In the process, waging war against the Sultanate of Lanao and conquering territories from the Sultanate.

===Lucoes Mercenary Activity===
Due to the conflict-ridden nature of the Philippine archipelago, warriors were forged in the many wars in the islands, thus the islands acquired a reputation for its capable mercenaries, which were soon employed all across South and Southeast Asia with some influence even manifested in East Asia at Japan where Lucoes sailors initially guided Portuguese ships to the Shogunate and even South Asia in Sri Lanka where Lungshanoid pottery from Luzon were found in burials there. Lucoes (warriors from Luzon) aided the Burmese king in his invasion of Siam in 1547 AD. At the same time, Lusung warriors fought alongside the Siamese king and faced the same elephant army of the Burmese king in the defense of the Siamese capital at Ayuthaya.
The former sultan of Malacca decided to retake his city from the Portuguese with a fleet of ships from Lusung in 1525 AD.

Pinto noted that there were a number of them in the Islamic fleets that went to battle with the Portuguese in the Philippines during the 16th century. The Sultan of Aceh gave one of them (Sapetu Diraja) the task of holding Aru (northeast Sumatra) in 1540. Pinto also says one was named leader of the Malays remaining in the Moluccas Islands after the Portuguese conquest in 1511. Pigafetta notes that one of them was in command of the Brunei fleet in 1521. One famous Lucoes is Regimo de Raja, who was appointed by the Portuguese at Malacca as Temenggung (Jawi: تمڠݢوڠ) or Supreme Governor and Chief General. The Lucoes were so commercially and militarily influential that the Portuguese soldier Joao de Barros considered them, &quot;the most warlike and valiant of these parts.&quot; Yet among themselves the Lucoes were not united and the Portuguese soldier, Mendes Pinto noted that Muslim and Non-Muslim Lucoes rivaled each other.

==Philippine Revolution and Declaration of Independence (1896–1898)==
===Philippine Revolution (1896–1898)===

The Armed Forces of the Philippines began with the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution in August 1896, when the Spanish authorities upon the discovered they called the Katipunan, an anti-colonial secret organization. At the peak of the revolution, some Filipinos and a few Spaniards in the Spanish Army, Guardia Civil, and Navy defected to the Philippine Revolutionary Army. The Katipunan, led by the founder Andres Bonifacio and patriots, was a secessionist movement and shadow government spread throughout much of the islands, and began to influence much of the Philippines taking full advantage of Spanish failures against Cuban nationalists, whose goal was independence advocating independence through armed revolt against Spain through a revolution. During a mass gathering in the city of Caloocan, the members of the Katipunan organized themselves into a revolutionary government, named the newly established government &quot;Haring Bayang Katagalugan&quot;, and openly declared a nationwide armed revolution. On August 24, Bonifacio called for a simultaneous coordinated attack and the surrounding towns on the capital Manila. Bonifacio appointed generals to lead rebel forces in Manila. This attack has failed, however, the surrounding provinces began to revolt. In particular, rebels in Cavite led by led by Mariano Álvarez and Baldomero Aguinaldo (who were leaders from two different factions of the Katipunan) won major early victories. A power struggle among the revolutionaries led to a schism among Katipunan leadership followed by Bonifacio&#x27;s execution in 1897, with command shifting to Aguinaldo who led his own newly formed of the revolutionary government. That year, the revolutionaries are trucing the Spanish was officially signed the Pact of Biak-na-Bato, which temporarily reduced hostilities. General Aguinaldo and his Filipino revolutionary officers are exiled themselves to the British Hong Kong, though hostilities between Filipino rebels and the Spanish government never actually completely a ceased.

===Spanish–American War (1898)===
The first military action between American and Spanish forces was the 1898 Battle of Manila Bay. Entering the Philippine theater on May 1, 1898, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Asiatic Squadron under Commodore George Dewey aboard the defeated Spanish squadron under Admiral Patricio Montojo in a matter of hoursm effectively seizing control of Manila. Dewey&#x27;s force sustained only a single casualty, a heart attack aboard one of his vessels, and only nine wounded. On May 19, after the battle, Dewey had Filipino leader Emilio Aguinaldo, who had been in exile in Hong Kong transported to Manila. After assuming command of Filipino forces on May 24, Aguinaldo reignited the Philippine Revolution begun in 1896 and initiated land campaigns against the Spanish colonial government. By June 9, Aguinaldo&#x27;s forces gained control of the provinces of Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Bataan, Zambales, Pampanga, Pangasinan, and Mindoro, and had laid siege to the Spanish capital in Manila.

On 12 June 1898, Aguinaldo&#x27;s forces declared the independence of the Philippines. The Declaration was signed by ninety-eight persons, among them an American army officer who witnessed the proclamation. Although this signified the end date of the revolution, neither Spain nor the United States recognized Philippine independence. On August 13, after the 1898 Battle of Manila the Spanish commander, Captain-General Fermin Jaudenes, surrendered the capital to U.S. forces. This battle marked the end of Filipino–American collaboration, as the American action of preventing Filipino forces from entering the captured city of Manila was deeply resented by the Filipinos. The U.S. established a military government in the Philippines and the insurgent First Philippine Republic was formally established with the proclamation of the Malolos Constitution on January 23, 1899. The Spanish rule of the Philippines officially ended with the 1898 Treaty of Paris, which also ended the Spanish-American War. In that treaty, the U.S. agreed to pay US$20 million to the Spanish colonial government and the Spanish government ceded the Philippine Archipelago and other territories to the United States. This put the independence of the newly declared Southeast Asian republic in grave danger and, angered by the betrayal, Filipinos later declared war..

<text>A cantilever is a rigid structural element that extends horizontally and is unsupported at one end. Typically it extends from a flat vertical surface such as a wall, to which it must be firmly attached. Like other structural elements, a cantilever can be formed as a beam, plate, truss, or slab.

When subjected to a structural load at its far, unsupported end, the cantilever carries the load to the support where it applies a shear stress and a bending moment.

Cantilever construction allows overhanging structures without additional support.

==In bridges, towers, and buildings==
Cantilevers are widely found in construction, notably in cantilever bridges and balconies (see corbel). In cantilever bridges, the cantilevers are usually built as pairs, with each cantilever used to support one end of a central section. The Forth Bridge in Scotland is an example of a cantilever truss bridge. A cantilever in a traditionally timber framed building is called a jetty or forebay. In the southern United States, a historic barn type is the cantilever barn of log construction.

Temporary cantilevers are often used in construction.
The partially constructed structure creates a cantilever, but the completed structure does not act as a cantilever.
This is very helpful when temporary supports, or falsework, cannot be used to support the structure while it is being built (e.g., over a busy roadway or river, or in a deep valley). Therefore, some truss arch bridges (see Navajo Bridge) are built from each side as cantilevers until the spans reach each other and are then jacked apart to stress them in compression before finally joining. Nearly all cable-stayed bridges are built using cantilevers as this is one of their chief advantages. Many box girder bridges are built segmentally, or in short pieces. This type of construction lends itself well to balanced cantilever construction where the bridge is built in both directions from a single support.

These structures rely heavily on torque and rotational equilibrium for their stability.

In an architectural application, Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s Fallingwater used cantilevers to project large balconies.
The East Stand at Elland Road Stadium in Leeds was, when completed, the largest cantilever stand in the world holding 17,000 spectators.
The roof built over the stands at Old Trafford uses a cantilever so that no supports will block views of the field.
The old (now demolished) Miami Stadium had a similar roof over the spectator area. The largest cantilevered roof in Europe is located at St James&#x27; Park in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, the home stadium of Newcastle United F.C.

Less obvious examples of cantilevers are free-standing (vertical) radio towers without guy-wires, and chimneys, which resist being blown over by the wind through cantilever action at their base.

==Aircraft==
The cantilever is commonly used in the wings of fixed-wing aircraft. Early aircraft had light structures which were braced with wires and struts. However, these introduced aerodynamic drag which limited performance. While it is heavier, the cantilever avoids this issue and allows the plane to fly faster.

Hugo Junkers pioneered the cantilever wing in 1915. Only a dozen years after the Wright Brothers&#x27; initial flights, Junkers endeavored to eliminate virtually all major external bracing members in order to decrease airframe drag in flight. The result of this endeavor was the Junkers J 1 pioneering all-metal monoplane of late 1915, designed from the start with all-metal cantilever wing panels. About a year after the initial success of the Junkers J 1, Reinhold Platz of Fokker also achieved success with a cantilever-winged sesquiplane built instead with wooden materials, the Fokker V.1.
In the cantilever wing, one or more strong beams, called &quot;spars&quot;, run along the span of the wing. The end fixed rigidly to the central fuselage is known as the root and the far end as the tip. In flight, the wings generate lift and the spars carry this load through to the fuselage.

To resist horizontal shear stress from either drag or engine thrust, the wing must also form a stiff cantilever in the horizontal plane. A single-spar design will usually be fitted with a second smaller drag-spar nearer the trailing edge, braced to the main spar via additional internal members or a stressed skin. The wing must also resist twisting forces, achieved by cross-bracing or otherwise stiffening the main structure.

Cantilever wings require much stronger and heavier spars than would otherwise be needed in a wire-braced design. However, as the speed of the aircraft increases, the drag of the bracing increases sharply, while the wing structure must be strengthened, typically by increasing the strength of the spars and the thickness of the skinning. At speeds of around the drag of the bracing becomes excessive and the wing strong enough to be made a cantilever without excess weight penalty. Increases in engine power through the late 1920s and early 1930s raised speeds through this zone and by the late 1930s cantilever wings had almost wholly superseded braced ones. Other changes such as enclosed cockpits, retractable undercarriage, landing flaps and stressed-skin construction furthered the design revolution, with the pivotal moment widely acknowledged to be the MacRobertson England-Australia air race of 1934, which was won by a de Havilland DH.88 Comet.

Currently, cantilever wings are almost universal with bracing only being used for some slower aircraft where a lighter weight is prioritized over speed, such as in the ultralight class.

==Cantilever in microelectromechanical systems==

Cantilevered beams are the most ubiquitous structures in the field of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). An early example of a MEMS cantilever is the Resonistor, an electromechanical monolithic resonator. MEMS cantilevers are commonly fabricated from silicon (Si), silicon nitride (Si3N4), or polymers. 
The fabrication process typically involves undercutting the cantilever structure to &quot;release&quot; it, often with an anisotropic wet or dry etching technique. Without cantilever transducers, atomic force microscopy would not be possible.
A large number of research groups are attempting to develop cantilever arrays as biosensors for medical diagnostic applications. MEMS cantilevers are also finding application as radio frequency filters and resonators.
The MEMS cantilevers are commonly made as unimorphs or bimorphs.

Two equations are key to understanding the behavior of MEMS cantilevers. 
The first is &quot;Stoney&#x27;s formula&quot;, which relates cantilever end deflection δ to applied stress σ:

:formula_1

where formula_2 is Poisson&#x27;s ratio, formula_3 is Young&#x27;s modulus, formula_4 is the beam length and formula_5 is the cantilever thickness. Very sensitive optical and capacitive methods have been developed to measure changes in the static deflection of cantilever beams used in dc-coupled sensors.

The second is the formula relating the cantilever spring constant formula_6 to the cantilever dimensions and material constants:

:formula_7

where formula_8 is force and formula_9 is the cantilever width. The spring constant is related to the cantilever resonance frequency formula_10 by the usual harmonic oscillator formula formula_11. A change in the force applied to a cantilever can shift the resonance frequency.
The frequency shift can be measured with exquisite accuracy using heterodyne techniques and is the basis of ac-coupled cantilever sensors.

The principal advantage of MEMS cantilevers is their cheapness and ease of fabrication in large arrays.
The challenge for their practical application lies in the square and cubic dependences of cantilever performance specifications on dimensions. 
These superlinear dependences mean that cantilevers are quite sensitive to variation in process parameters, particularly the thickness as this is generally difficult to accurately measure. However, it has been shown that microcantilever thicknesses can be precisely measured and that this variation can be quantified. Controlling residual stress can also be difficult.

==Chemical sensor applications==
A chemical sensor can be obtained by coating a recognition receptor layer over the upper side of a microcantilever beam. A typical application is the immunosensor based on an antibody layer that interacts selectively with a particular immunogen and reports about its content in a specimen. In the static mode of operation, the sensor response is represented by the beam bending with respect to a reference microcantilever. Alternatively, microcantilever sensors can be operated in the dynamic mode. In this case, the beam vibrates at its resonance frequency and a variation in this parameter indicates the concentration of the analyte. Recently, microcantilevers have been fabricated that are porous, allowing for a much larger surface area for analyte to bind to, increasing sensitivity by raising the ratio of the analyte mass to the device mass. Surface stress on microcantilever, due to receptor-target binding, which produces cantilever deflection can be analyzed using optical methods like laser interferometry. Zhao et al., also showed that by changing the attachment protocol of the receptor on the microcantilever surface, the sensitivity can be further improved when the surface stress generated on the microcantilever is taken as the sensor signal.

<doc id="160666" wikidata="Q357771" url="?curid=160666" title="Paul of Samosata">
<text>Paul of Samosata (, lived from 200 to 275) was patriarch of Antioch from 260 to 268 and the originator of the Paulianist heresy named after him. He was a believer in monarchianism, a nontrinitarian doctrine; his teachings reflect adoptionism.

== Life ==
Paul was born at Samosata into a family of humble origin. He was elected patriarch of Antioch in 260. He held the civil office of Procurator ducenarius.

His Monarchianist teachings aroused strong opposition in the church. He was also accused of corruption on a grand scale. Edward Gibbon describes him as follows:
The wealth of that prelate was a sufficient evidence of his guilt since it was neither derived from the inheritance of his fathers nor acquired by the arts of honest industry. But Paul considered the service of the church as a very lucrative profession. His ecclesiastical jurisdiction was venal and rapacious; he extorted frequent contributions from the most opulent of the faithful and converted to his own use a considerable part of the public revenue. By his pride and luxury the Christian religion was rendered odious in the eyes of the Gentiles. His council chamber and his throne, the splendour with which he appeared in public, the suppliant crowd who solicited his attention, the multitude of letters and petitions to which he dictated his answers, and the perpetual hurry of business in which he was involved, were circumstances much better suited to the state of a civil magistrate than to the humility of a primitive bishop. When he harangued his people from the pulpit, Paul affected the figurative style and the theatrical gestures of an Asiatic sophist, while the cathedral resounded with the loudest and most extravagant acclamations in the praise of his divine eloquence. Against those who resisted his power, or refused to flatter his vanity, the prelate of Antioch was arrogant, rigid, and inexorable; but he relaxed the discipline, and lavished the treasures of the church on his dependent clergy, who were permitted to imitate their master in the gratification of every sensual appetite. For Paul indulged himself very freely in the pleasures of the table, and he had received into the episcopal palace two young and beautiful women, as the constant companions of his leisure moments.

In 269, seventy bishops, priests and deacons assembled at Antioch as a Pre-Ecumenical synod or council called the Synods of Antioch:
From Egypt to the Euxine Sea, the bishops were in arms and in motion. Several councils were held, confutations were published, ex-communications were pronounced, ambiguous explanations were by turns accepted and refused, treaties were concluded and violated.

The synod deposed Paul as bishop and elected Domnus I as his successor. They also wrote an encyclical letter to Pope Dionysius and Pope Maximus of Alexandria, bishops of Rome and Alexandria respectively. This letter is the only indisputably contemporary document concerning him and was preserved in Eusebius of Caesarea&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;.

However, because the synod had acted without consulting the clergy or the people, its authority was in question, enabling Paul to claim continued possession of his bishopric. Since he had friendly relations with Zenobia, the separatist queen of Palmyra ruling in Syria, he maintained his occupancy of the bishop&#x27;s house in Antioch for another four years. Late in 272, however, when the emperor Aurelian defeated Zenobia, Paul lost her protection. Aurelian allowed the two parties, for and against Paul, to present their cases before his own tribunal. Aurelian was not a Christian and had no interest in the doctrinal issues of the Church. Wishing only to restore order, he relied on the judgment of the bishops of Italy and Rome. The unanimous verdict was for Paul to relinquish his position as bishop.

The ruling of Aurelian occurred during the &quot;Little Peace of the Church&quot;, a roughly 40-year period when Christianity flourished without official sanctions from the central government. It was the first time the Church had sought the emperor&#x27;s intervention in an internal dispute.

== Teachings ==
Paul&#x27;s teaching is a form of Monarchianism, which emphasised the oneness of God. Paul taught that Jesus was born a mere man, but that he was infused with the divine Logos or word of God. Hence, Jesus was seen not as God-become-man but as man-become-God. In his Discourses to Sabinus of Spoleto, of which only fragments are preserved in a book against heresies ascribed to Anastasius, Paul writes:

* &quot;Having been anointed by the Holy Spirit he received the title of the anointed (i.e. Christos), suffering in accordance with his nature, working wonders in accordance with grace. For in fixity and resoluteness of character he likened himself to God, and having kept himself free from sin was united with God, and was empowered to grasp as it were the power and authority of wonders. By these he was shown to possess over and above the will, one and the same activity (with God), and won the title of Redeemer and Saviour of our race&quot;;
* &quot;The Saviour became holy and just; and by struggle and hard work overcame the sins of our forefather. By these means he succeeded in perfecting himself, and was through his moral excellence united with God; having attained to unity and sameness of will and energy (i.e. activity) with Him through his advances in the path of good deeds. This will be preserved inseparable (from the Divine), and so inherited the name which is above all names, the prize of love and affection vouchsafed in grace to him&quot;;
* &quot;We do not award praise to beings which submit merely in virtue of their nature, but we do award high praise to beings which submit because their attitude is one of love; and so submitting because their inspiring motive is one and the same, they are confirmed and strengthened by one and the same indwelling power, of which the force ever grows, so that it never ceases to stir. It was in virtue of this love that the Saviour coalesced with God, so as to admit of no divorce from Him, but for all ages to retain one and the same will and activity with Him, an activity perpetually at work in the manifestation of good&quot;;
* &quot;Wonder not that the Saviour had one will with God. For as nature manifests the substance of the many to subsist as one and the same, so the attitude of love produces in the many a unity and a sameness of will which is manifested by unity and sameness of approval and well-pleasingness&quot;.

Paul was an early forerunner of Adoptionism. It was suggested that the Paulicians of Armenia adhered to his teachings, and received their name from him. However, historical records show that the Paulicians were bitterly persecuted more for their gnostic and iconoclastic views than for their adherence to Adoptionism.

Paul&#x27;s pupil Lucian of Antioch is considered to have had a major influence on Arius the founder of Arianism.

=== Eusebius&#x27; account ===
Another major source of information we have of Paul of Samosata comes from Eusebius of Caesarea, who described some of the doctrines and practices Paul displayed openly, which included:
* Receiving money for his religious services, as well as paying others to preach his doctrines;
* Preferring to be called an imperial procurator of queen Zenobia, rather than bishop;
* He stopped the production of psalms to Christ, and trained women to sing psalms to himself as an angel come down from heaven.

Likewise, Eusebius hints to the fact that Paul was &quot;too familiar&quot; with his women followers, whom he called &quot;subintroductae&quot;.

== Aftermath ==
Canon 19 of the First Council of Nicaea dealt with the Paulianists:

Athanasius of Alexandria explained that despite the fact that the followers of Paul of Samosata baptised in the name of the Trinity, they did not make it in the orthodox sense, making their baptism invalid. The Paulianists seemed to have disappeared soon after the council, although the Paulicianists, a 7th-century dualistic sect, were often misidentified as being one and the same.

<doc id="160667" wikidata="Q7185019" url="?curid=160667" title="Philippine Constabulary">
<text>The Philippine Constabulary (PC; , &quot;HPP&quot;; ) was a gendarmerie-type military police force of the Philippines from 1901 to 1991, and the predecessor to the Philippine National Police. It was created by the American occupational government to replace the Spanish colonial Guardia Civil, happened on the 19th century history of the Philippines. It was the first of the four branches of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. On January 29, 1991, it was merged with the Integrated National Police to form the Philippine National Police.
==History==


The Philippine Constabulary (PC) was established on August 18, 1901, under the general supervision of the civil Governor-General of the Philippines, by the authority of Act. No. 175 of the Second Philippine Commission, to maintain peace, law, and order in the various provinces of the Philippine Islands. By the end of 1901, a total of 180 officers had been commissioned.

The constabulary assisted the United States military in combating the remaining irreconcilable revolutionaries following the March 23 capture of General Emilio Aguinaldo and his April 1 pledge of allegiance to the United States. This phase of the Philippine–American War ended in Luzon by 1906, with the surrender and execution of one of its last remaining generals, Macario Sakay.

Continued disorder and brigandry prompted Governor-General William Howard Taft to maintain the PC to combat insurgents. Captain Henry T. Allen of the 6th U.S. Cavalry, a Kentucky-born graduate of West Point (Class 1882), was named as the chief of the force, and was later dubbed as the &quot;Father of the Philippine Constabulary&quot;. With the help of four other army officers, Captains David Baker, W. Goldsborough, H. Atkinson, and J.S. Garwood, Captain Allen organized the force, trained, equipped and armed the men as best as could be done at the time. Although the bulk of the officers were recruited from among the U.S. commissioned and non-commissioned officers, two Filipinos qualified for appointment as 3rd Lieutenants during the first month of the PC: Jose Velasquez of Nueva Ecija and Felix Llorente of Manila. Llorente retired as a colonel in 1921 while Velasquez retired as major in 1927.

The Philippine Constabulary Band was formed on October 15, 1902, by Colonel Walter Loving upon the instructions of Governor-General Taft, who was known as a music lover. The 86-piece band toured the United States to great acclaim, leading the parade in Washington, D.C. to celebrate Taft&#x27;s 1909 presidential inauguration, and performing at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition and the 1915 World&#x27;s Fair. Before the First World War, the PC Band would serve as a source of national pride.

===Philippine Military Academy===

A school for the constabulary was established on February 17, 1905, at the Santa Lucia barracks in Intramuros. In 1908, the school was transferred to Baguio. In 1915 the school was renamed &quot;Academy for Officers of the Philippine Constabulary&quot;. In 1928, the school was renamed the &quot;Philippine Constabulary Academy&quot;. When the Philippine Army was created in 1936, the institution became the Philippine Military Academy. The school is the main source of regular officers of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), which before 1991 included those of the Philippine Constabulary.

===Camp Crame===

In 1935, a large tract of land was acquired in New Manila Heights, now part of Quezon City. It was given by the City of Manila government in exchange for the old Gagalangin barracks compound in Tondo. Part of this tract became Camp Crame, named after Brigadier General Rafael Cramé of Rizal Province who became the first Filipino appointed Chief of the Constabulary on December 17, 1917. Other parts of the tract became Camp Murphy (now Camp Aguinaldo), and Zablan Field, site the Philippine Constabulary Air Corps (PCAC).

===Reorganized as a military organization===
Under the National Defense Act of 1935, the PC became the backbone of the Philippine Army, later re-established after World War II and was known as both the Philippine Constabulary and as the Military Police Command in 1946. It consisted of soldiers trained in military police duties with nationwide jurisdiction.

The move to abolish the national police force and to make it a nucleus of a Philippine Army got underway when the Army of the Philippines was created in 1936. Thus, the transfer of the PC to the regular force of the new military organization was effected under the provisions of Sec. 18 of the National Defense Act, and pursuant to Executive Order No. 11 of President Manuel L. Quezon dated January 11, 1936. The Constabulary was inactivated on this date and was known as the Constabulary Division, Philippine Army. The PC was not gone but got submerged in a bigger organization. Thereafter, the insular police duties, formally reposed in the PC, were discharged by a &quot;State Police&quot; created by Commonwealth Act No. 88 dated October 26, 1936.

After turning over the former Constabulary duties to a State Police, which proved to be short-lived and unsuccessful, the Constabulary was revived as a military police force on June 23, 1938, by Commonwealth Act No. 343. By operation of the CA 343, the State Police was abolished and its military police duties reverted to the PC. President Quezon himself recommended to the National Assembly that the State Police be abolished and in its place the PC was to be reconstituted into a separate organization, distinct and divorced from the Philippine Army, which was for &quot;national defense&quot;.

The PC once again existed as an independent force retaining all duties in maintaining peace and order and protection of life and property. One of the most significant provisions of the law re-creating it was that which provided that officers and enlisted men detached from the army and transferred to the PC shall retain their identity and legal rights and obligations as officers and enlisted men of the army; that the president may, at his discretion, transfer at any time any officer or enlisted man to and from the army to the Constabulary, respectively; and that all services performed in the Constabulary shall count for all legal purposes as military service. Thus, began the linear roster of officers for both the Constabulary and the Armed forces up until the PC was merged with the Integrated National Police in 1991.

===World War II===
In May 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt proclaimed a state of emergency in the continental United States and all American overseas possessions including the Philippines. With the organization of the United States Army Forces in the Far East in July, the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the Constabulary prepared their combat units. The PC was inducted to the USAFFE and was formed into three infantry regiments for participation in national defense.

On October 15, the 1st PC Regiment was inducted into the USAFFE by Brig, Gen. George M. Parker in Camp Crame, after which it was moved to the Balara cantonment area in Quezon City, where the men were trained as a combat team on the regimental level.

The 2nd and 3rd Regiments were inducted into the USAFFE on November 17 and December 12, respectively. The 1st and the 2nd were assigned to safeguard public utilities vital to the survival of the growing population of the City of Greater Manila.

War broke out on December 8, 1941. The two PC regiments less the 2nd Battalion of the 1st which was ordered to proceed to Bataan immediately, were assigned in Manila to arrest all aliens believed to be sympathetic with the enemy. In addition, these units were ordered to safeguard centers of communication and all public utilities in the city and of securing the metropolitan area against subversive elements. Soon, a protective cordon around Manila was formed by units of the two PC regiments.

By January 1942, most of the &quot;constables&quot; were in the Bataan peninsula with other Fil-American troops. &quot;On Bataan and Corregidor, in Aparri, Lingayen and Atimonan, everywhere in the islands were the invaders dread to set foot, Constabulary troops distinguished themselves in action against overwhelming odds.&quot;

On December 29, the 4th PC Regiment was activated and constituted by PC units from the provinces of Bataan, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, Pangasinan, Tarlac, and Zambales. Two days later, the regiment was ordered to Bataan.

To prevent the unnecessary slaughter of his war-weary troops, Maj. General Edward P. King Jr., the commanding officer of the Southern Luzon Force, negotiated with the Japanese High Command the surrender of the Bataan-based Filipino American troops. Bataan fell on April 9, 1942, and thousands of Filipino-American servicemen who had defended it became prisoners of war. A large number of Constabulary men died in the battle and in the infamous Bataan Death March. Many more died at the concentration camp in Capas, Tarlac.

The Philippines was liberated late in 1944 and early in 1945. Thereafter, the problem of restoring peace and order from the general chaos and disorder arising from the war came up. The Constabulary went on active service with the Philippine Commonwealth Army under President Sergio Osmeña&#x27;s Executive Order 21, dated October 28, 1944. In the reorganization, that followed, the Military Police Command (MPC), USAFFE, was created pursuant to USAFFE General Orders No. 50 Another Order, General Orders No. 51 dated July 7, 1945, redesignated the organization as MPC, AFWESPAC.

===Bureau of Constabulary===
After the fall of Manila, the Japanese established the Bureau of Constabulary as the Filipino national police force using former officers from the Philippine Constabulary. Jose de los Reyes was appointed director on February 5, 1943. He was succeeded by Guillermo B. Francisco on April 11, 1943 and Paulino Santos in August 1944.

According to Robert Lapham, an American officer who had headed to the jungles to fight instead of obeying General MacArthur&#x27;s order to surrender and had become a guerrilla commander, constabulary chief Gen. Guillermo Francisco had been &quot;de-Americanized&quot; by the Japanese after the surrender of Bataan, after which, they &quot;half trusted him to do their will&quot;. Francisco and his men pursued &quot;bandits and cut-throats, which was good in itself and which allowed them to look good to their Japanese overlords, but it was known among many of his officers and some outsiders as well that he and most of his men were just waiting for an opportune time to change sides.&quot;

During the Japanese occupation, the enemy, through the use of force and threats, organized their version of the Philippine Constabulary which they called the Bureau of Constabulary; it was later renamed to match the pre-war Constabulary with the creation of the Second Republic. A handful of former PC officers and men were rounded up and forced to work with this outfit, with the threat that their loved ones would be harmed; majority of the men who escaped managed to find their way into the hills where they joined the resistance movement until liberation came in 1944.

It is a fact that much of the stigma that haunted the PC was the result of the establishment by the Japanese of their version of the Constabulary. Many had the wrong impression that the occupation Constabulary was the same force as that of the pre-war organization.

===Post war era===
A major revamp in the Armed Forces was effected on March 30, 1950, when President Elpidio Quirino issued Executive Order No. 308 which called for the merger of the Philippine Constabulary with the Armed Forces, making it one more major service command. This was the second time the PC returned to a military force. Due to the unstable peace and order conditions existing in the countrysides brought about by the resurgence of the Hukbalahap (Huk) which require more personnel strength, the Philippine Army was called upon to assist in the pacification drive with the employment of its combat arms – the Battalion Combat Teams or BCTs, with PC men absorbed by the BCTs. It was under E.O. 308 and according to Administrative Order No. 113, dated April 1, 1950, the PC was formally merged with the Armed Forces of the Philippines; the merger was completed on July 27, the same year. 12,000 men from the MPC to the PC.

Under the E.O., the power of executive supervision and all authority and duties exercised by the Secretary of Interior concerning the PC or its members were transferred to and exercised by the Secretary of National Defense. With the appointment, on American advice, of former USAFFE guerilla Rep. Ramon Magsaysay as Secretary of National Defense in September 1950 and the subsequent appropriation by Congress of more funds for the drive against the Communist movement in the Philippines, more BCTs were formed.

The delineation of the missions of the then four major services – Philippine Army, Philippine Constabulary, Philippine Navy, and Philippine Air Force – were underlined by EO No. 389 dated December 23, 1950, which abolished the Philippine Service Command and the Philippine Ground Force. Headquarters Armed Forces of the Philippines became known as &quot;General Headquarters, Armed Forces of the Philippines&quot;; while General Headquarters, Philippine Constabulary became known as &quot;Headquarters, Philippine Constabulary&quot;, the nomenclature it had in the prewar years. Also, the major commands were abolished and in their places were activated the four major services. As defined in Executive Order (E.O.) No. 389, the main function of the PC was maintaining peace and order within the country and to be the country&#x27;s national police force even though it was a branch then of the military.

In the reorganization that followed, the four military areas created under EO No. 94, series 1947, were not altered substantially but were nevertheless placed under the administrative and operational control of the AFP General Headquarters.

===Marcos martial law era===
President Ferdinand Marcos sought to have a strong personal influence over the Armed Forces, including the PC, as soon as he became president in 1965,
 holding on to the portfolio of defense secretary in the first thirteen months of his presidency to develop what scholars have noted to be &quot;a patronage system within the defense establishment.&quot; The portfolio afforded him direct interaction with the AFP&#x27;s leadership, and to have a hand in the AFP&#x27;s day-to-day operationalization.

Upon the declaration of Martial Law in 1972, Marcos used the AFP as what the Davide Commission Report would later call his &quot;martial law implementor,&quot; and &quot;one of the vital supports of the regime.&quot; Upon the announcement of Martial Law in 1972, one of their earliest tasks was that of quickly arresting and containing Marcos&#x27; political opponents. The AFP was given many other functions, including assisting in the implementation of price controls imposed on key products like corn and rice, enforcing the rules of the national corn procurement program, assisting in the collection of rural and government bank loans, implementing the agrarian reform law, and various police functions such as collecting unlicensed firearms and enforcing curfews, and suppressing strikes, rallies, and other demonstrations.

In 1975, the PC officially integrated the nation&#x27;s municipal and city police, fire and penitentiary services, which from 1974 onward formed the Integrated National Police, into the service, thus the PC became the &quot;Philippine Constabulary-Integrated National Police&quot; (PC-INP), as per the provisions of Presidential Decree 765, enacted on August 8 the same year, that formally fused the two services into one joint service, with joint command resting with the Chief of the PC.

Civilian and military historians alike agree that &quot;human rights abuses by the troops became rampant&quot; during the Marcos administration, as documented by international monitoring entities such as Amnesty International. Units often specifically cited in these reported incidents include the Metrocom Intelligence and Security Group (MISG), and the 5th Constabulary Security Unit (5CSU) which were under the Philippine Constabulary, as well as the Intelligence Service of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (ISAFP), the Presidential Security Unit, and the National Intelligence and Security Agency (NISA) were also accused of aiding these activities. Aside from human rights abuses, these units were also accused of hounding media entities, corporate management, and opposition groups with threats, intimidation, and violence.

Marcos&#x27; hold on power was effectively broken once enough of the Military withdrew their support from him in February 1986.

===Post-Marcos era and dissolution===

The need to assert civilian control of the military was a reform agenda which began being addressed almost as soon as Ferdinand Marcos was deposed by the 1986 People Power Revolution; within a year of Marcos&#x27; ouster, the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines enshrined the principle of civilian supremacy over the military.

After the various coup attempts of the 1980s, the recommendations of the Davide Commission included the dissolution of the Philippine Constabulary as a service under the AFP. It was abolished in the early 1990s in a merger with the Integrated National Police.

In 1991, it was determined that a new civilian Philippine National Police was to be formed by merging the Integrated National Police into the Philippine Constabulary, with the PC forming the basis as it had the more developed infrastructure. The PC was then removed from the Ministry of National Defense and eventually civilianized, as part of the Department of the Interior and Local Government, through attrition and recruitment of new personnel.

In 2017, President Rodrigo Duterte contemplated reviving the Constabulary to augment the manpower of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, with presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella announcing the planned revival. This was never carried out after Duterte&#x27;s term ended.

==Missions and duties==
The PC&#x27;s missions were as follows:
* 1. To preserve peace and order and enforce the law throughout the country and also to arrest law violators and those who will violate such laws;
* 2. Inspectional supervision over, and undertake the training of, municipal and city level police forces, fire departments, and jail services;
* 3. To assist civil government and semi-government agencies in the accomplishment of their missions;
* 4. To perform home defense in rear areas and such other services as the chief of staff, AFP may direct.

The PC covered a very extensive range of diversified missions that through the years did not fall under its primary responsibilities. By express provision of law, the PC enforced the motor vehicle law, fishing and games law, the alien law for registration and fingerprinting, and anti-dummy law, and the nationalization of retail trade law. By direction of the president, it enforced the tenancy law, the law on scrap metal, iron and gold, a ban on slaughter of water buffalo or carabao, and other laws. By deputation, it enforced the immigration law, customs law, forestry law, quarantine law, election law, public service law, and amusement law and weight and standards on rice. As a civic function, it performed in conjunction with the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and the Red Cross disaster relief operations during natural calamities and the like, alongside other organizations in later years. The security of VIPs was a routine requirement for the constabulary.

==Organization==
The chief of the Philippine Constabulary was, from 1975 onward, also the director-general of the Integrated National Police (the municipal police, fire, and jail force for the larger towns and cities).

The PC was organized on similar lines to the army, and consisted of a General Staff located at its General Headquarters at Camp Crame, Manila, and 12 Regional Commands (under a regional director) consisting of 104 Provincial Commands (under a Provincial Commander); these controlled the 450 PC Companies which performed all the day-to-day military police work.

The Regions were based on the country&#x27;s political regions and directly controlled the various Highway Patrol, Rangers, and investigative groups.

The PC Regions would be later grouped into 4 PC Field Units or Command Zones (PCZs), each of which was headed by a Zone Commander (provinces are as of 1990):
* IPCZ – Abra, Aurora, Bataan, Batanes, Benguet, Bulacan, Cagayan, Ifugao, Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, Isabela, Kalinga-Apayao, La Union, Mt. Province, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, Pangasinan, Tarlac and Zambales
* IIPCZ – Albay, Batangas, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Catanduanes, Cavite, Laguna, Marinduque, Mindoro Occidental, Mindoro Oriental, Palawan, Quezon, Rizal and Sorsogon
* IIIPCZ – Aklan, Antique, Bohol, Capiz, Cebu, Iloilo, Leyte and Southern Leyte, Masbate, Negros Occidental, Negros Oriental, Romblon, Samar, Eastern Samar and Northern Samar and Siquijor
* IVPCZ – Agusan del Norte, Agusan del Sur, Basilan, Bukidnon, Camiguin, Cotabato, Davao del Norte, Davao del Sur, Davao Oriental, Lanao del Norte, Lanao del Sur, Misamis Occidental, Misamis Oriental, Sulu, Surigao del Norte, Surigao del Sur, South Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat, Tawi-Tawi, Zamboanga del Norte and Zamboanga del Sur

=== Ranks ===

Ranks of the PC followed those first of the United States Army and later on those used by the Armed Forces of the Philippines.

Originally the PC used the ranks and insignia of the United States Army upon its foundation and in its latter years it was more modelled on Philippine Army but with branch-specific shoulder board and sleeve insignia.

The Philippine Constabulary Rangers, or PC Rangers, were independent light infantry companies which served as a counter-insurgency force similar to United States Army Rangers and were organized into 12 large regional companies.

Constabulary Headquarters directly controlled many other services needed at a national level such as the Special Action Force, Central Crime Laboratory, White Collar Crime Group, and Office of Special Investigations (which was a counter-intelligence group).

The Constabulary also maintained the following units:

* PC/INP Air Unit
* Constabulary Boat Service
* Crime and Forensic Labs
* PC Metropolitan Command (METROCOM).
* National Constabulary Investigations Service which acted in a similar way to the FBI before the NBI was reformed.

<text>A cable-stayed bridge has one or more &quot;towers&quot; (or &quot;pylons&quot;), from which cables support the bridge deck. A distinctive feature are the cables or , which run directly from the tower to the deck, normally forming a fan-like pattern or a series of parallel lines. This is in contrast to the modern suspension bridge, where the cables supporting the deck are suspended vertically from the main cable, anchored at both ends of the bridge and running between the towers. The cable-stayed bridge is optimal for spans longer than cantilever bridges and shorter than suspension bridges. This is the range within which cantilever bridges would rapidly grow heavier, and suspension bridge cabling would be more costly.

Cable-stayed bridges were being designed and constructed by the late 16th century, and the form found wide use in the late 19th century. Early examples, including the Brooklyn Bridge, often combined features from both the cable-stayed and suspension designs. Cable-stayed designs fell from favor in the early 20th century as larger gaps were bridged using pure suspension designs, and shorter ones using various systems built of reinforced concrete. It returned to prominence in the later 20th century when the combination of new materials, larger construction machinery, and the need to replace older bridges all lowered the relative price of these designs.

==History==
Cable-stayed bridges date back to 1595, where designs were found in &quot;Machinae Novae&quot;, a book by Croatian-Venetian inventor Fausto Veranzio. Many early suspension bridges were cable-stayed construction, including the 1817 footbridge Dryburgh Abbey Bridge, James Dredge&#x27;s patented Victoria Bridge, Bath (1836), and the later Albert Bridge (1872) and Brooklyn Bridge (1883). Their designers found that the combination of technologies created a stiffer bridge. John A. Roebling took particular advantage of this to limit deformations due to railway loads in the Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge.

The earliest known surviving example of a true cable-stayed bridge in the United States is E.E. Runyon&#x27;s largely intact steel or iron Bluff Dale Suspension bridge with wooden stringers and decking in Bluff Dale, Texas (1890), or his weeks earlier but ruined Barton Creek Bridge between Huckabay, Texas and Gordon, Texas (1889 or 1890). In the twentieth century, early examples of cable-stayed bridges included A. Gisclard&#x27;s unusual Cassagnes bridge (1899), in which the horizontal part of the cable forces is balanced by a separate horizontal tie cable, preventing significant compression in the deck, and G. Leinekugel le Coq&#x27;s bridge at Lézardrieux in Brittany (1924). Eduardo Torroja designed a cable-stayed aqueduct at Tempul in 1926. Albert Caquot&#x27;s 1952 concrete-decked cable-stayed bridge over the Donzère-Mondragon canal at Pierrelatte is one of the first of the modern type, but had little influence on later development. The steel-decked Strömsund Bridge designed by Franz Dischinger (1955) is, therefore, more often cited as the first modern cable-stayed bridge.
Other key pioneers included Fabrizio de Miranda, Riccardo Morandi, and Fritz Leonhardt. Early bridges from this period used very few stay cables, as in the Theodor Heuss Bridge (1958). However, this involves substantial erection costs, and more modern structures tend to use many more cables to ensure greater economy.

==Comparison with suspension bridge==

Cable-stayed bridges may appear to be similar to suspension bridges, but they are quite different in principle and construction. In suspension bridges, large main cables (normally two) hang between the towers and are anchored at each end to the ground. This can be difficult to implement when ground conditions are poor. The main cables, which are free to move on bearings in the towers, bear the load of the bridge deck. Before the deck is installed, the cables are under tension from their own weight. Along the main cables smaller cables or rods connect to the bridge deck, which is lifted in sections. As this is done, the tension in the cables increases, as it does with the live load of traffic crossing the bridge. The tension on the main cables is transferred to the ground at the anchorages and by downwards compression on the towers.

In cable-stayed bridges, the towers are the primary load-bearing structures that transmit the bridge loads to the ground. A cantilever approach is often used to support the bridge deck near the towers, but lengths further from them are supported by cables running directly to the towers. That has the disadvantage, unlike for the suspension bridge, that the cables pull to the sides as opposed to directly up, which requires the bridge deck to be stronger to resist the resulting horizontal compression loads, but it has the advantage of not requiring firm anchorages to resist the horizontal pull of the main cables of the suspension bridge. By design, all static horizontal forces of the cable-stayed bridge are balanced so that the supporting towers do not tend to tilt or slide and so must only resist horizontal forces from the live loads.

The following are key advantages of the cable-stayed form:
* much greater stiffness than the suspension bridge, so that deformations of the deck under live loads are reduced
* can be constructed by cantilevering out from the tower – the cables act both as temporary and permanent supports to the bridge deck
* for a symmetrical bridge (in which the spans on either side of the tower are the same), the horizontal forces balance and large ground anchorages are not required

==Designs==
There are four major classes of rigging on cable-stayed bridges: &quot;mono&quot;, &quot;harp&quot;, &quot;fan,&quot; and &quot;star&quot;.

* The &quot;mono&quot; design uses a single cable from its towers and is one of the lesser-used examples of the class.
* In the &quot;harp&quot; or &quot;parallel&quot; design, the cables are nearly parallel so that the height of their attachment to the tower is proportional to the distance from the tower to their mounting on the deck.
* In the &quot;fan&quot; design, the cables all connect to or pass over the top of the towers. The fan design is structurally superior with a minimum moment applied to the towers, but, for practical reasons, the modified fan (also called the semi-fan) is preferred, especially where many cables are necessary. In the modified fan arrangement, the cables terminate near the top of the tower but are spaced from each other sufficiently to allow better termination, improved environmental protection, and good access to individual cables for maintenance.
* In the &quot;star&quot; design, another relatively rare design, the cables are spaced apart on the tower, like the harp design, but connect to one point or a number of closely spaced points on the deck.

There are also seven main arrangements for support columns: &quot;single&quot;, &quot;double&quot;, &quot;portal&quot;, &quot;A-shaped&quot;, &quot;H-shaped&quot;, &quot;inverted Y&quot; and &quot;M-shaped&quot;. The last three are hybrid arrangements that combine two arrangements into one.

* The &quot;single&quot; arrangement uses a single column for cable support, normally projecting through the center of the deck, but in some cases located on one side or the other. Examples: Millau Viaduct in France and Sunshine Skyway Bridge in Florida.
* The &quot;double&quot; arrangement places pairs of columns on both sides of the deck. Examples: Øresund Bridge between Denmark and Sweden, and Zolotoy Bridge in Russia.
* The &quot;portal&quot; is similar to the double arrangement but has a third member connecting the tops of the two columns to form a door-like shape or portal. This offers additional strength, especially against transverse loads. Examples: Hale Boggs Bridge in Louisiana and Kirumi Bridge in Tanzania.
* The &quot;A-shaped&quot; design is similar in concept to the portal but achieves the same goal by angling the two columns towards each other to meet at the top, eliminating the need for the third member. Examples: Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge in South Carolina, Helgeland Bridge in Norway and Christopher S. Bond Bridge in Missouri.
* The &quot;H-shaped&quot; design combines the &quot;portal&quot; on the bottom with the &quot;double&quot; on top. Examples: Grenland Bridge in Norway, Vasco da Gama Bridge in Portugal and John James Audubon Bridge in Louisiana.
* The &quot;inverted Y&quot; design combines the &quot;A-shaped&quot; on the bottom with the &quot;single&quot; on top. Examples: Pont de Normandie in France and Incheon Bridge in South Korea.
* The &quot;M-shaped&quot; design combines two &quot;A-shaped&quot;, each tower on the side of the other, to form an M. This type of arrangement is rare, and is mostly used in wide bridges where a lonely &quot;A-shaped&quot; arrangement would be too weak. Examples: Fred Hartman Bridge in Texas and its planned sister bridge Ship Channel Bridge, also in Texas.

Depending on the design, the columns may be vertical or angled or curved relative to the bridge deck.

==Variations==

===Side-spar cable-stayed bridge===

A side-spar cable-stayed bridge uses a central tower supported only on one side. This design allows the construction of a curved bridge.

===Cantilever spar cable-stayed bridge===
Far more radical in its structure, the Puente del Alamillo (1992) uses a single cantilever spar on one side of the span, with cables on one side only to support the bridge deck. Unlike other cable-stayed types, this bridge exerts considerable overturning force upon its foundation and the spar must resist the bending caused by the cables, as the cable forces are not balanced by opposing cables. The spar of this particular bridge forms the gnomon of a large garden sundial. Related bridges by the architect Santiago Calatrava include the Puente de la Mujer (2001), Sundial Bridge (2004), Chords Bridge (2008), and Assut de l&#x27;Or Bridge (2008).

===Multiple-span cable-stayed bridge===
Cable-stayed bridges with more than three spans involve significantly more challenging designs than do 2-span or 3-span structures.

In a 2-span or 3-span cable-stayed bridge, the loads from the main spans are normally anchored back near the end abutments by stays in the end spans. For more spans, this is not the case and the bridge structure is less stiff overall. This can create difficulties in both the design of the deck and the pylons.
Examples of multiple-span structures in which this is the case include Ting Kau Bridge, where additional &#x27;cross-bracing&#x27; stays are used to stabilise the pylons; Millau Viaduct and Mezcala Bridge, where twin-legged towers are used; and General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge, where very stiff multi-legged frame towers were adopted. A similar situation with a suspension bridge is found at both the Great Seto Bridge and San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge where additional anchorage piers are required after every set of three suspension spans – this solution can also be adapted for cable-stayed bridges.

===Extradosed bridge===
An extradosed bridge is a cable-stayed bridge with a more substantial bridge deck that, being stiffer and stronger, allows the cables to be omitted close to the tower and for the towers to be lower in proportion to the span. The first extradosed bridges were the Ganter Bridge and Sunniberg Bridge in Switzerland. The first extradosed bridge in the United States, the Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge was built to carry I-95 across the Quinnipiac River in New Haven, Connecticut, opening in June 2012.

===Cable-stayed cradle-system bridge===

A cradle system carries the strands within the stays from the bridge deck to bridge deck, as a continuous element, eliminating anchorages in the pylons. Each epoxy-coated steel strand is carried inside the cradle in a one-inch (2.54 cm) steel tube. Each strand acts independently, allowing for removal, inspection, and replacement of individual strands. The first two such bridges are the Penobscot Narrows Bridge, completed in 2006, and the Veterans&#x27; Glass City Skyway, completed in 2007.

==Related bridge types==

===Self-anchored suspension bridge===

A self-anchored suspension bridge has some similarity in principle to the cable-stayed type in that tension forces that prevent the deck from dropping are converted into compression forces vertically in the tower and horizontally along the deck structure. It is also related to the suspension bridge in having arcuate main cables with suspender cables, although the self-anchored type lacks the heavy cable anchorages of the ordinary suspension bridge. Unlike either a cable-stayed bridge or a suspension bridge, the self-anchored suspension bridge must be supported by falsework during construction and so it is more expensive to construct.

<text>The Philippine Department (Filipino: &quot;Kagawaran ng Pilipinas/Hukbong Kagawaran ng Pilipinas&quot;) was a regular United States Army organization whose mission was to defend the Philippine Islands and train the Philippine Army. On 9 April 1942, during World War II, the organization surrendered to the Japanese. The department and its sub-units were predominantly under the command of American officers, including an American general, while the majority of the troops were enlisted Filipinos, known as the Philippine Scouts (PS). The primary force of this department was the Philippine Division. Of the 22,532 troops, 10,473 were members of the Philippine Division itself.

This unit was formally organized in 1913 and, on 26 July 1941, was attached to US Army Forces – Far East (USAFFE). Following the creation of USAFFE, the Philippine Department became, in effect, a corps area service and logistical command. Tactical command was permanently transferred to USAFFE&#x27;s control.

==Patch of the Philippine Department==
All units of the department wore the Philippine Department shoulder sleeve insignia, with the exception of the Philippine Division, which wore their own patch: a golden carabao on a red shield.

Officially, the Philippine Department&#x27;s insignia featured the Philippine Sea Lion, in white, superimposed on a blue oval with a height of 2.5 inches. The Sea Lion is derived from the coat of arms of Manila. The Philippine Department and Philippine Division insignia were both approved on 8 July 1922.

<text>The Philippine Scouts (Filipino: &quot;Maghahanap ng Pilipinas&quot;/&quot;Hukbong Maghahanap ng Pilipinas&quot;) was a military organization of the United States Army from 1901 until after the end of World War II. These troops were generally Filipinos and Filipino-Americans assigned to the United States Army Philippine Department, under the command of American commissioned officers (though a handful of Filipino Americans received commissions from the United States Military Academy). Philippine Scout units were given the suffix &quot;(PS)&quot;, to distinguish them from other U.S. Army units.

The first Scout companies were organized by the U.S. in 1901 to combat the Philippine Revolutionary Army led at that time by General Emilio Aguinaldo. In 1919–1920, the PS companies were grouped into regiments as part of the United States Army and redesignated the 43d, 44th, 45th, and 57th Infantry Regiments, plus the 24th and 25th Field Artillery Regiments, the 26th Cavalry Regiment (PS) and the 91st and 92nd Coast Artillery Regiments. Service and support formations were also organized as engineer, medical, quartermaster and military police units. The infantry and field artillery regiments were grouped together with the U.S. 31st Infantry Regiment to form the U.S. Army&#x27;s Philippine Division. At this point, the Scouts became the U.S. Army&#x27;s front line troops in the Pacific.

The Philippine Department assigned the Scouts to subdue the Moro tribes on the island of Mindanao (see Moro rebellion), and to establish tranquility throughout the islands. In the 1930s, Philippine Scouts, along with the 31st Infantry Regiment, saw action at Jolo, Palawan.

Philippine Scout regiments became the first United States Army units to be in combat during World War II, until the surrender of USAFFE in May 1942. Even after that some individual soldiers and units refused to surrender and became beginning elements of the resistance to the Japanese occupation. Later paroled POWs would also join the resistance.

==Macabebe Scouts==


Native guides and a small number of former Spanish Army militia members from Macabebe that joined U.S. forces commanded by General Henry Lawton and, after authorization by General Elwell Otis, initially two, and later five companies of Macabebe Scouts were formed on September 10, 1899 under Lieutenant Matthew A. Batson. The Macabebes proved themselves reliable over the next two months, and Batson formed five companies of 128 men each; all veterans of service in the militia. In retaliation, Aguinaldo&#x27;s forces under the command of Col. Agapito Bonzon burned the town of Macabebe and massacred 300 of its residents on June 26, 1898. Batson&#x27;s Macabebe companies saw combat against Aguinaldo&#x27;s forces beginning in October 1899, after which they were reorganized into &quot;The Squadron of Philippine Cavalry, U.S. Volunteers&quot; on June 1, 1900 and enlisted as irregulars. The Macabebes won lasting notability in the operation under General Frederick Funston to capture General Aguinaldo.


The Army Reorganization Act of 1901 authorized the formation of scout units of Philippine origin within the U.S. Army. On the Army&#x27;s recommendation, U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt authorized the formation of a unified native Scouts organization. The Army activated this Native Scouts force in October 1901 by integrating 50 local companies into a single force of 5,000 men. Over the next ten years, the Scouts won accolades from their American commanders which contributed to their survival as a unit.

==Philippine Scouts and U.S. Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE)==
On July 26, 1941, in preparation for the coming war, President Roosevelt called General Douglas MacArthur back to active duty and put him in charge of a new military organization: The United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE). MacArthur took command of all military forces in the Philippines except the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Asiatic Fleet. The Philippine Division, Philippine Department and all other Philippine Scout units were included in USAFFE, as was the U.S. Army&#x27;s Far East Air Force (FEAF). At the time of USAFFE&#x27;s formation, the unit consisted of 22,532 troops, of which 11,972 were Philippine Scouts.

Of the 22,532 troops, 10,473 were members of the Philippine Division, itself containing 2,552 Americans and 7,921 Filipinos. All of the division&#x27;s enlisted men, with the exception of the 31st Infantry Regiment and some of the military police and headquarters troops, were Philippine Scouts.

==Filipino Officers within the Philippine Division, July 1941==
In 1910, the U.S. Army began sending one outstanding Filipino soldier per year to West Point. Among these cadets were Vicente Lim (USMA, Class of 1914), Fidel V. Segundo (1917), Eustaquio S. Baclig (1918), Pastor Martelino (1920), and at least eight others. However, the first Filipino officer with the Philippine Scouts, Esteban Boadilla Dalao, had been commissioned in 1912 and rose to the rank of Colonel. By 1941 some of these men had risen to the rank of senior officers, and some transferred to the Philippine Army when the Philippine Commonwealth began to build up its own forces in 1937. In July 1941, there were fifteen Filipino Scout officers within the Philippine Division. Two were in the Headquarters, two were amongst the Special Troops, three in the 45th Infantry Regiment (PS), one in the 57th Infantry Regiment (PS), five in the 24th Field Artillery Regiment (PS), one in the 12th Quartermaster Regiment (PS), and one in the 14th Engineer Regiment (PS).

==World War II==
On December 7, 1941, (December 8, 1941, local time in Asia), Imperial Japanese forces attacked the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, bombed the U.S. Army&#x27;s Far East Air Force at Clark Field in the Philippines, attacked British Hong Kong, and landed troops on the shores of British Malaya, simultaneously. Over the next three months the Japanese Army marched through Southeast Asia, and by March 1942 the Japanese had completely overrun every country and island in the western Pacific — except the Philippines.

On the Bataan Peninsula of Luzon Island, the Philippine Scouts, a few U.S. Army National Guard units, and ten divisions of poorly equipped, almost untrained Philippine Army soldiers held out against the Japanese. Survivors of the Battle of Bataan, to a man, describe the Philippine Scouts as the backbone of the American defense there. President Franklin Roosevelt awarded the U.S. Army&#x27;s first three Medals of Honor of World War II to Philippine Scouts: to Sergeant Jose Calugas for action at Culis, Bataan on January 6, 1942, to Lieutenant Alexander R. Nininger for action near Abucay, Bataan on January 12, and to Lieutenant Willibald C. Bianchi for action near Bagac, Bataan on February 3, 1942.

With the U.S. Navy at Pearl Harbor in shambles, and the Japanese Navy blockading the Philippines, there was no way to send adequate amounts of food, medicine, ammunition or reinforcements to Bataan. Early in the campaign, in January 1942, General MacArthur ordered that his forces be fed one-half daily rations because the USAFFE food-stocks on Bataan were insufficient for the planned six-month siege. Such a diet did not provide enough calories for men working and fighting in the tropical heat of the Philippines&#x27; Dry Season. Nonetheless, the Scouts and the other soldiers held out for more than four months without adequate food or medicine, while malaria, dysentery and malnutrition ravaged their ranks, and Japanese attacks drove them further down the Bataan Peninsula. In the midst of the Battle of Bataan, on March 11, 1942, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered General Douglas MacArthur spirited out of the Philippines by PT boat and airplane.

==Prisoners of war==
The Battle of Bataan ended on April 9, 1942, when Major General Edward P. King, Jr., surrendered rather than see any more of his starving, diseased men slaughtered by the advancing enemy. At that point 70,000 men became prisoners of war: about 16,000 Americans and 54,000 Filipinos. Japanese soldiers marched the emaciated Scouts, American soldiers, and Philippine Army men sixty-five miles up the Bataan Peninsula&#x27;s East Road on the notorious &quot;March of Death&quot;, the Bataan Death March. During the March, Japanese guards shot or bayoneted between 7,000 and 10,000 men who fell, attempted to escape, or just stopped to quench their thirst at roadside spigots or puddles. They also beat and sometimes killed Filipino civilians who attempted to give food and water to the POWs, and at times flashed the &quot;V&quot; for &quot;Victory&quot; hand-gesture to the defeated soldiers along the length of the Death March. The March ended at the railroad head in San Fernando, Pampanga province. There the POWs were forced into overcrowded &quot;40 and 10&quot; railroad cars, which only had enough room for them to sit down in shifts on the final leg of the trip to Capas, Tarlac province. At Capas they were herded into Camp O&#x27;Donnell, a former Philippine Army training camp, which was to be their prison camp.

At Camp O&#x27;Donnell the Japanese crammed all 60,000 survivors into a Philippine Army camp designed to accommodate 10,000 men. There, the Japanese commander greeted each new group of arrivals with the discouraging &quot;Goddamn you to Hell&quot; speech in his native language, and assured the men that they were &quot;captives,&quot; not Prisoners of war, and would be treated as such. There was little running water, sparse food, no medical care, and only slit trenches for sanitation. The heat was intolerable, flies rose out of the latrines and covered the prisoner&#x27;s food, and malaria, dysentery, beriberi and a host of other diseases swept through the crowds of men. They began to die at the rate of four hundred per day.

From September through December 1942, the Japanese gradually paroled the surviving Philippine Scouts and other Filipino soldiers to their families and to the mayors of their hometowns. But by the time Camp O&#x27;Donnell closed in January 1943, after eight months of operation, 26,000 of the 50,000 Filipino prisoners of war had died there.

The Japanese transferred the American prisoners to Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija province, where conditions were only marginally better. But as U.S. forces pulled closer to the Philippines in 1944, they evacuated the healthiest American prisoners to Japan and Manchuria, for use as slave laborers. Thousands of men were crammed into the dark holds of cargo ships so tightly that they could not sit or lay down. Again, food and water were scarce, sanitary facilities were non-existent, and the heat in the closed holds of the ships was unbearable. Men suffocated to death standing up. The Japanese ships were unmarked and some of them were torpedoed by American submarines. More of the men died of malnutrition and exposure in the work camps. By the time Japan surrendered and the U.S. and Filipino Army liberated the Bataan prisoners of war, two-thirds of the American prisoners had died in Japanese custody.

==Liberation and the &quot;New&quot; Scouts==
During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines an extensive Filipino guerrilla movement sprang up. In some cases the guerrilla units were led by escaped American officers (e.g., Wendell Fertig) and often included &quot;paroled&quot; Philippine Scout and Philippine Commonwealth Army soldiers, along with civilian members of the Philippine underground. As MacArthur&#x27;s forces, supported by the guerrillas, liberated the Philippine Islands, the surviving Philippine Scouts stepped forward and rejoined the U.S. Army. The Filipino guerrillas joined them, and the U.S. Army set up new Philippine Scout units, reconstituting the old Philippine Division as the 12th Infantry Division. Subordinate units included the 43rd, 44th and 45th Infantry Regiments (PS); 23rd, 24th and 88th Field Artillery (PS) Battalions; 56th Engineer Battalion (PS) and the 57th Infantry Regiment (PS). The &quot;New Scouts&quot; actively participated in combat against the Japanese Army in north Luzon, served as military police to restore order and help locate pockets of escaped Japanese in the south, and served as occupation forces on Okinawa. As planning for the invasion of Japan progressed, the Philippine Scouts were included in the invasion forces, and were selected to become part of the occupying force once Japan was defeated.

After Japan surrendered in August 1945, the United States granted the Republic of the Philippines full independence on July 4, 1946. At that point the ethnically Filipino Philippine Scouts held a unique status in U.S. military history: they were soldiers in the regular U.S. Army, but now they were citizens of a foreign country. To solve this dilemma, the United States offered the Filipinos in the Philippine Scouts full U.S. citizenship. Many of the surviving Scouts, perhaps around 1,000, accepted, and the Army transferred them to other units to finish their military careers.

With the consent of the Philippine government, Congress approved the maintenance of 50,000 Philippine Scouts. Under Major General Hibbs, Philippine Division as the 12th Infantry Division (PS) was reconstituted. Unlike its previous organization enlisted personnel of the division were exclusively Philippine Scouts. The War Department also proposed organizing a second Philippine Scout division, the 14th, but never did so. In the end President Truman disbanded the Philippine Scouts as an official element of the United States Army, and all of their unit colors were retired in 1947, and finally disbanded in December 1948.

==Legacy==
Many of the former Philippine Scouts went on to serve the new Philippine Army, as well as the United States Army in military careers of twenty and more years, campaigning in the Korean War, the build-up to the planned invasion of Cuba during the October 1962 Missile Crisis, the Vietnam War, and the Cold War. Children of the Scouts (known as &quot;Army Soup&quot; in pre-World War II Fort William McKinley days) sometimes carried on their fathers&#x27; military traditions and also became U.S. Army soldiers and Marines. Two Philippine Scout children even earned the stars of U.S. Army generals: Lt. General Edward Soriano and Major General Antonio M. Taguba. A third, Brig. General Oscar Hilman, a native of Washington state and an armor officer who had started out as an enlisted man, earned his star in a long career in the Army National Guard.

Unlike other non-citizen veterans, veterans of the Philippine Division and other Filipinos who fought as part of the USAFFE were never granted citizenship. Since 1993, various bills have been introduced to the United States Congress under the name Filipino Veterans Fairness Act to rectify this. However, this was a complicated matter as after the liberation of the Philippines members of the Philippine Scouts were offered enlistments and in some applicable cases commissions in the U.S. Army and subsequent citizenship. Large numbers of &quot;old&quot; Philippine Scouts (those enlisting before or during World War II) took advantage of this. However, most &quot;new&quot; Philippine Scouts (those recruited following the war, mostly for occupation duty on Okinawa and elsewhere) were not offered citizenship. Language similar to the aforementioned proposed legislation was inserted by the Senate into the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 which was signed into law. This provided a one-time payment to those veterans who are recognized as being soldiers or recognized guerrilla members by the United States or their surviving spouse. Even this, however, falls far short of the benefits available to similar veterans of other units.

In 2012, a documentary film named &quot;Forgotten Soldiers&quot; was produced by Donald A. Pata, with the help of Associate Instructor Chris Schaefer of the University of Utah, and narrated by Lou Diamond Phillips. The film received awards from the City of Los Angeles, the California Senate, County of Los Angeles, and at the Beloit International Film Festival.

<text>BogoMips (from &quot;bogus&quot; and MIPS) is a crude measurement of CPU speed made by the Linux kernel when it boots to calibrate an internal busy-loop. An often-quoted definition of the term is &quot;the number of million times per second a processor can do absolutely nothing&quot;.

BogoMips is a value that can be used to verify whether the processor in question is in the proper range of similar processors, i.e. BogoMips represents a processor&#x27;s clock frequency as well as the potentially present CPU cache. It is not usable for performance comparisons among different CPUs.

== History ==
In 1993, Lars Wirzenius posted a Usenet message explaining the reasons for its introduction in the Linux kernel on comp.os.linux:

: MIPS is short for Millions of Instructions Per Second. It is a measure for the computation speed of a processor. Like most such measures, it is more often abused than used properly (it is very difficult to justly compare MIPS for different kinds of computers).

: BogoMips are Linus&#x27;s own invention. The linux kernel version 0.99.11 (dated 11 July 1993) needed a timing loop (the time is too short and/or needs to be too exact for a non-busy-loop method of waiting), which must be calibrated to the processor speed of the machine. Hence, the kernel measures at boot time how fast a certain kind of busy loop runs on a computer. &quot;Bogo&quot; comes from &quot;bogus&quot;, i.e, something which is a fake. Hence, the BogoMips value gives some indication of the processor speed, but it is way too unscientific to be called anything but BogoMips.

: The reasons (there are two) it is printed during boot-up is that a) it is slightly useful for debugging and for checking that the computer[’]s caches and turbo button work, and b) Linus loves to chuckle when he sees confused people on the news.

== Proper BogoMips ratings ==
As a very approximate guide, the BogoMips can be pre-calculated by the following table. The given rating is typical for that CPU with the then current and applicable Linux version. The index is the ratio of &quot;BogoMips per clock speed&quot; for any CPU to the same for an Intel 386DX CPU, for comparison purposes.

With the 2.2.14 Linux kernel, a caching setting of the CPU state was moved from behind to before the BogoMips calculation. Although the BogoMips algorithm itself wasn&#x27;t changed, from that kernel onward the BogoMips rating for then current Pentium CPUs was twice that of the rating before the change. The changed BogoMips outcome had no effect on real processor performance.

In a shell, BogoMips can be easily obtained by searching the cpuinfo file:

$ grep -i bogomips /proc/cpuinfo
== Computation of BogoMips ==
With kernel 2.6.x, BogoMips are implemented in the codice_1 kernel source file. It computes the Linux kernel timing parameter codice_2 (see jiffy) value. The explanation from source code:
codice_2 is used to implement codice_4 (delay in microseconds) and codice_5 (delay in nanoseconds) functions. These functions are needed by some drivers to wait for hardware. Note that a busy waiting technique is used, so the kernel is effectively blocked when executing codice_5/codice_4 functions. For i386 architecture codice_8 is implemented in codice_9 as:

/* simple loop based delay: */
static void delay_loop(unsigned long loops)
 int d0;

 __asm__ __volatile__(
 &quot;\tjmp 1f\n&quot;
 &quot;.align 16\n&quot;
 &quot;1:\tjmp 2f\n&quot;
 &quot;.align 16\n&quot;
 &quot;2:\tdecl %0\n\tjns 2b&quot;
 :&quot;=&amp;a&quot; (d0)
 :&quot;0&quot; (loops));

equivalent to the following assembler code

; input: eax = d0
; output: eax = 0
 jmp start
.align 16
start: jmp body
.align 16
body: decl eax
 jns body

which can be rewritten to C-pseudocode

static void delay_loop(long loops)
 long d0 = loops;
 do {
 --d0;
 } while (d0 &gt;= 0);


Full and complete information and details about BogoMips, and hundreds of reference entries can be found in the (outdated) BogoMips mini-Howto.

== Timer-based delays ==

In 2012, ARM contributed a new codice_4 implementation allowing the system timer built into many ARMv7 CPUs to be used instead of a busy-wait loop. This implementation was released in Version 3.6 of the Linux kernel. Timer-based delays are more robust on systems that use frequency scaling to dynamically adjust the processor&#x27;s speed at runtime, as codice_11 values may not necessarily scale linearly. Also, since the timer frequency is known in advance, no calibration is needed at boot time.

One side effect of this change is that the BogoMIPS value will reflect the timer frequency, not the CPU&#x27;s core frequency. Typically the timer frequency is much lower than the processor&#x27;s maximum frequency, and some users may be surprised to see an unusually low BogoMIPS value when comparing against systems that use traditional busy-wait loops.

<text>George Barrington (14 May 1755 – 27 December 1804) (real name Walden) was an Irish pickpocket, popular London socialite, Australian pioneer (following his transportation to Botany Bay), and author. His escapades, arrests, and trials were widely chronicled in the London press of his day. For over a century following his death, and still perhaps today, he was most celebrated for the couplet “True patriots all; for be it understood, We left our country for our country’s good”. The attribution of the line to Barrington is considered apocryphal since the 1911 discovery by Sydney book collector Alfred Lee of the 1802 book in which the line first appeared.

==Personal life==
Barrington was born at Maynooth in County Kildare, son either of a working silversmith named Waldron, or of Captain Barrington, an English troop commander.

At some point in the 1785–1787 period he married and the couple had a child, but the names of the wife and child, and their eventual fates, are not known.

During the beginnings of his prosperity in Australia, Barrington cohabited with a native woman, Yeariana, who soon left him to return to her family. Barrington said that Yeariana possessed &quot;a form that might serve as a perfect model for the most scrupulous statuary.&quot;

==Career==
===Pickpocketing===

In 1771 he robbed his schoolmaster at Dublin and ran away from school, becoming a member of a touring theatrical company at Drogheda under the assumed name of Barrington. At the Limerick races he joined the manager of the company in picking pockets. The manager was detected and sentenced to transportation, and Barrington fled to London, where he assumed clerical dress and continued his pickpocketing. At Covent Garden theatre he robbed the Russian Count Orlov of a snuffbox, said to be worth £30,000. He was detected and arrested but, as Count Orlov declined to prosecute, was discharged, though subsequently he was sentenced to three years&#x27; hard labour for pocket-picking at Drury Lane theatre.

On his release, he was again caught at his old practices and sentenced to five years&#x27; hard labour, but influence secured his release on the condition that he leave England. He accordingly went for a short time to Dublin, and then returned to London, where he was once more detected pocket-picking, and, in 1790, sentenced to seven years&#x27; transportation.

===At Botany Bay===
One account states that on the voyage out to Botany Bay a conspiracy was hatched by the convicts on board to seize the ship. Barrington disclosed the plot to the captain, and the latter, on reaching New South Wales, reported him favourably to the authorities, with the result that in 1792 Barrington obtained a warrant of emancipation (the first issued), becoming subsequently superintendent of convicts and later high constable of Parramatta.

Barrington died at Parramatta in 1804.

==Latter-day renown==
Whatever doubts may exist about the authorship of the &quot;Prologue&quot;, its most famous line has become an iconic part of Australian culture (for example, it is quoted in the film &quot;Breaker Morant&quot; and provides the title of the play &quot;Our Country&#x27;s Good&quot;). It begins:

==Works==
Barrington employed the artist and engraver Vincent Woodthorpe to illustrate these works, 
*&quot;A Voyage to New South Wales&quot;. In two volumes, the first of which is &quot;A Voyage to Botany Bay&quot;, London, 1795 and 1801.
*&quot;The History of New South Wales&quot;. London, 1802 and 1810.

==Film==
In 2022, the two German artists Matthias Meyer and Alexander Rischer released their experimental documentary film &quot;The Ballad of George Barrington&quot;, which traces the life of George Barrington. The film had its premiere on 25 November 2022 at the Metropolis Kino in Hamburg.
