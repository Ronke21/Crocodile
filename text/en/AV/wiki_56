<text>Extortion is the practice of obtaining benefit (e.g., money or goods) through coercion. In most jurisdictions it is likely to constitute a criminal offence; the bulk of this article deals with such cases. Robbery is the simplest and most common form of extortion, although making unfounded threats in order to obtain an unfair business advantage is also a form of extortion.

Extortion is sometimes called the &quot;protection racket&quot; because the racketeers often phrase their demands as payment for &quot;protection&quot; from (real or hypothetical) threats from unspecified other parties; though often, and almost always, such &quot;protection&quot; is simply abstinence of harm from the same party, and such is implied in the &quot;protection&quot; offer. Extortion is commonly practiced by organized crime. In some jurisdictions, actually obtaining the benefit is not required to commit the offense, and making a threat of violence which refers to a requirement of a payment of money or property to halt future violence is sufficient to commit the offense. Exaction refers not only to extortion or the demanding and obtaining of something through force, but additionally, in its formal definition, means the infliction of something such as pain and suffering or making somebody endure something unpleasant.

The term &quot;extortion&quot; is often used metaphorically to refer to usury or to price-gouging, though neither is legally considered extortion. It is also often used loosely to refer to everyday situations where one person feels indebted against their will, to another, in order to receive an essential service or avoid legal consequences. Neither extortion nor blackmail requires a threat of a criminal act, such as violence, merely a threat used to elicit actions, money, or property from the object of the extortion. Such threats include the filing of reports (true or not) of criminal behavior to the police, revelation of damaging facts (such as pictures of the object of the extortion in a compromising position), etc. 

In law &quot;extortion&quot; can refer to political corruption, such as selling one&#x27;s office or influence peddling, but in general vocabulary the word usually first brings to mind blackmail or protection rackets. The logical connection between the corruption sense of the word and the other senses is that to demand bribes in one&#x27;s official capacity is blackmail or racketeering in essence (that is, &quot;you need access to this resource, the government restricts access to it through my office, and I will charge you unfairly and unlawfully for such access&quot;). Extortion is also known as shakedown, and occasionally exaction.

==United States==
Extortion is distinguished from robbery. In robbery, whether armed or not, the offender takes property from the victim by the immediate use of force or fear that force will be immediately used. Extortion, which is not limited to the taking of property, involves the verbal or written &quot;instillation&quot; of fear that something will happen to the victim if they do not comply with the extortionist&#x27;s will. Another key distinction is that extortion always involves a verbal or written threat, whereas robbery may not. In United States federal law, extortion can be committed with or without the use of force and with or without the use of a weapon. Violation of many state extortion statutes constitutes &quot;racketeering activity&quot; under Section 1961 of the federal Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 USC

In blackmail, which always involves extortion, the extortionist threatens to reveal information about a victim or their family members that is potentially embarrassing, socially damaging, or incriminating unless a demand for money, property, or services is met.

In the United States, extortion may also be committed as a federal crime across a computer system, phone, by mail, or in using any instrument of interstate commerce. Extortion requires that the individual sent the message willingly and knowingly as elements of the crime. The message only has to be sent (but does not have to reach the intended recipient) to commit the crime of extortion.

==United Kingdom==
===England and Wales===
In England and Wales extorting property and money by coercion is the offence of blackmail which covers any &quot;unwarranted demand with menaces&quot; including physical threats. See section 21 of the Theft Act 1968 plus sections 29 and 30 of the Larceny Act 1916. A group of people may also be committing conspiracy.

===Scotland===
Extortion is a common law crime in Scotland of using threat of harm to demand money, property or some advantage from another person. It does not matter whether the demand itself is legitimate (such as for money owed) as the crime can still be committed when illegitimate threats of harm are used.

==Cyber extortion==
Cyber extortion is when an individual or group uses the internet as a mean of demanding some sort of material gain. The group or individual usually sends a company a threatening email stating that they have received confidential information about their company and will exploit a security leak or launch an attack that will harm the company&#x27;s network. The message sent through the email usually demands money in exchange for the prevention of the attack.

===Cases===
In March 2008, Anthony Digati was arrested on federal charges of extortion through interstate communication. Digati put $50,000 into a variable life insurance policy by New York Life Insurance Company and wanted a return of $198,303.88. When the firm did not comply, he threatened to send out six million spam emails. He registered a domain in February 2008 that contained New York Life&#x27;s name in the URL to display false public statements about the company and increased his demand to $3 million. According to prosecutors, Digati&#x27;s intent was not to inform or educate but he wanted to &quot;damage the reputation of New York Life and cost the company millions of dollars in revenue,&quot;. New York Life contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Digati was apprehended.

On February 15, 2011, Spanish police apprehended a man who attempted to blackmail Nintendo over customer information he had stolen. The man stole personal information about 4,000 users and emailed Nintendo Ibérica, Nintendo&#x27;s Spanish division, and accused the company of data negligence. He threatened the company that he would make the information public and complain to the Spanish Data Agency if his demands were not met. After Nintendo ignored his demands, he published some of the information on an Internet forum. Nintendo notified authorities and the man was arrested in Málaga. No information has been revealed as to what the man demanded from Nintendo.

On February 7, 2019, Jeffrey P. Bezos, owner of Amazon and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and currently one of the world&#x27;s wealthiest people, accused the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; and its parent company American Media, Inc., of attempting to extort him by threatening to reveal nude pictures of him unless he publicly stated that he &quot;[has] no knowledge or basis for suggesting that AMI&#x27;s coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.&quot; This threat was in response to Bezos investigating the tabloid for publishing details about his relationship with Lauren Sanchez, which led to Bezos and his wife Mackenzie announcing their divorce on January 9 of that year. Bezos refused and posted the threat on Medium.

On October 21, 2020, the news sources reported that roughly 40,000 patient records had been stolen from the Finnish private health care provider Vastaamo. The extorters demanded 40roughly 450,000 euros at the or the stolen patient data would be published. The extorters published 100 patient records a day on a Tor message board to add pressure for their demands. The leaked patient records contained patients&#x27; full names, home addresses, social security numbers, and the therapists&#x27; and doctors&#x27; notes from each session. After the extortion of the company failed, the extorters sent victims an email demanding they pay either 200euros within 24hours or 500euros in 48hours in order to avoid publishing their sensitive personal data. The company&#x27;s security practices were found to be inadequate: the sensitive data was not encrypted and apparently the system root password was very weak. The patient records were first accessed by intruders in November 2018, while the security flaws continued to exist until March 2019. The president of Finland described the cyber attack as &quot;relentlessly cruel.&quot;

Some definitions also include acts of unlawful violence or unconventional warfare, but at present, the international community has been unable to formulate a universally agreed, legally binding, criminal law definition of terrorism.
* Tiger kidnapping: the taking of an innocent hostage to make a loved one or associate of the victim do something, e.g. a child is taken hostage to force the shopkeeper to open the safe; the term originates from the prior observation of the victim, like a tiger does with its prey. Ransoms are often used alongside these.

<text>George Ritzer (born October 14, 1940) is an American sociologist, professor, and author who has mainly studied globalization, metatheory, patterns of consumption, and modern/postmodern social theory. His concept of McDonaldization draws upon Max Weber&#x27;s idea of rationalization through the lens of the fast food industry. He coined the term in a 1983 article for &quot;The Journal of American Culture,&quot; developing the concept in &quot;The McDonaldization of Society&quot; (1993), which is among the best selling monographs in the history of American sociology.

Ritzer has written many general sociology books, including &quot;Introduction to Sociology&quot; (2012) and &quot;Essentials to Sociology&quot; (2014), and modern/postmodern social theory textbooks. Many of his works have been translated into over 20 languages, with over a dozen translations of &quot;The McDonaldization of Society&quot; alone&quot;.&quot;

Ritzer is currently a Distinguished Professor Emeritus at the University of Maryland, College Park.

== Biography ==

=== Personal life ===

Ritzer was born in 1940 to a Jewish family in upper Manhattan, New York City. Ritzer&#x27;s father was a taxicab driver and his mother was a secretary; he also has one brother. Ritzer described his upbringing as &quot;upper lower class&quot;. When his father contracted what Ritzer referred to as &quot;a strange illness,&quot; speculated to be from his job as a taxi driver, Ritzer&#x27;s mother had to do so much as to break open the family&#x27;s piggy bank, where they stored half dollars, to provide for the family. Living a marginal economic existence, he never felt deprived relative to others while growing up in a &quot;working-class, multi-ethnic neighborhood&quot;.

His father never received his high school diploma and therefore, had no strong desire for Ritzer to achieve educationally. Ritzer described his father as being “a very bright man who simply grew up in a different time”. His parents in general did not push him to pursue higher education or knew much about it. Instead, it was more “’ go to college because that’s what people are doing,’ instead of that classic middle class Jewish family push to go to the elite universities’”.

In an interview, Ritzer noted a formative experience that occurred while he attended the Bronx High School of Science, he felt that he was “a pretty average kind of student” as he was among incredibly intelligent individuals. Due to his surroundings, it took him a while to realize that he “was a little bit above average.” In addition, despite the high school being largely orientated toward the sciences and his classmates sharing these interests, Ritzer had no interest in math or science.

While in high school, Ritzer had a friend who he would read the same classic novel such as &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; with, and then walk around the city walking miles discussing the book alone. He gave this example in an interview where he was explaining the nature of his high school and the students who went there. Ritzer also noted that “it was just sort of known that if you were bright or saw yourself as bright then you wanted to go to the Bronx High School of Science” to further exemplify the environment he was in during high school.

Growing up, Ritzer was an avid sports player. He often played basketball, in large part due to his height, and other sports like baseball. He also read a lot even as he notes that he wasn’t “very academically inclined&quot;.

Ritzer and his wife, Sue (married 1963), have two children and five grandchildren. Despite being a workaholic, he has always made time for his family. Ritzer also loves to travel, oftentimes using the work trips as a time for a mini vacation with his wife.

Ritzer resides in Maryland with Sue, where he owns three homes. He noted in an interview regarding consumption how the success of his books has “allowed him to acquire things, mostly houses” and gives him the ability to live life the way he wants to. Since he likes to be outdoors, he wants homes that will allow him to do so. For example, due to the restriction of winter months in Maryland which inhibits his ability to walk outside, he purchased a place in Florida where he can continue his hobby of walking “three or four miles a day” when he’s not writing inside.

=== Education and early employment ===
Ritzer graduated from the Bronx High School of Science in 1958, stating to have &quot;encountered the brightest people I have ever met in my life&quot;. While at Bronx High School of Science, Ritzer received a New York State Regents Scholarship which would follow him to whichever college he chose to attend.

Ritzer began his higher education at City College of New York, a free college at the time. His scholarship in addition to the free college tuition proved to be a benefit to the economic positioning of the Ritzer family. While at CCNY, Ritzer initially planned to focus on business, but he later changed his major to accounting. Ritzer stated in an interview that he was a student at CCNY when he first stepped inside a McDonalds, which greatly juxtaposed the distinct culture of restaurants and stores in New York. This event unknowingly catalyzed Ritzer&#x27;s study and major theory of McDonaldization.

After graduating from CCNY in 1962, Ritzer decided that he was interested in pursuing business again. He was accepted into the M.B.A. program at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor, where he received a partial scholarship. While at Michigan, his official academic interest was human relations; however, he had many other intellectual hobbies, such as reading Russian novels. Ritzer reported that at Michigan, he was able to grow and improve as a student. However, during his time at Michigan, he remembers being heavily involved in global events occurring at the time. He reports memories of going to the Michigan Union to watch the happenings of the Cuban Missile Crisis.

After graduating from The University of Michigan in 1964, Ritzer began working in personnel management for the Ford Motor Company, however, this proved to be a negative experience for him. His managers mistakenly hired three people, more than was necessary, for the one job, leaving him idle and unoccupied. As he once said: &quot;[i]f we had two hours of work a day, it was a lot.&quot; Nevertheless, he was always expected to appear busy. He would constantly wander around the factory for hours observing people working, causing many of the workers and foremen to become hostile towards him. Moreover, Ritzer also found problems within the management structure at Ford. Most of the younger people with advanced degrees defied their less-educated authorities. Ritzer said, &quot;I&#x27;d like to see a society in which people are free to be creative, rather than having their creativity constrained or eliminated.&quot; This feeling of dehumanization is very relevant in his future sociological work of McDonaldization. Furthermore, he found himself constrained and unable to do anything creative while working at Ford, encouraging him to apply to Ph.D. programs.

Ritzer enrolled in Cornell University&#x27;s School of Labor and Industrial Relations Ph.D. program in Organizational Behavior in 1965, ironically returning to another business program despite his distaste for his time at Ford. There, his adviser Harrison Trice suggested that he minor in sociology. After a conversation with the head of the department, Gordon Streib, Ritzer realized that he knew nothing about sociology and was then urged to read &quot;Broom and Selznick’s Introduction to Sociology&quot; and found himself enthralled with the subject matter. He continued to succeed in sociology courses at the graduate level. As a testament to his interest and dedication to the subject, he received an A+ on a 102-page paper he wrote for a course on American society. His professor stated that the paper was &quot;too long not to be good&quot;. This experience as well as out-reading the other sociology students in a small seminar with Margaret Cussler allowed Ritzer to become more confident as a sociology student due to his ability to outwork the competition. He attributed his talent of being able to compete with well-read and experienced sociology students to his work ethic.

Ritzer never earned a degree in sociology but studied psychology and business. He began his sociological work writing theory connecting his minimal sociological education alongside the experiences that struck him when first experiencing the McDonalds chain stores. As he said in a later interview, &quot;I basically trained myself as a social theorist, and so I had to learn it all as I went.&quot; Despite this challenge, Ritzer found that not being trained in social theory was advantageous for him, because his reasoning was not limited to a particular theoretical perspective.

=== McDonaldization ===
George Ritzer wrote &quot;The McDonaldization of Society.&quot;

Ritzer&#x27;s idea of McDonaldization is an extension of Max Weber&#x27;s (1864–1920) classical theory of the rationalization of modern society and culture. Weber famously used the terminology &quot;iron cage&quot; to describe the stultifying, Kafkaesque effects of bureaucratized life, and Ritzer applied this idea to an influential social system in the twenty-first century: McDonald&#x27;s. Ritzer argues that McDonald&#x27;s restaurants have become the better example of current forms of instrumental rationality and its ultimately irrational and harmful consequences on people.
Ritzer shared similar views with Weber about rationalization. While Weber claims that “the most sublime values have retreated from public life”, Ritzer claims that even our food is subject to rationalization, whether it is “the McDonaldized experience or the steak dinner that is subjected to the fact that it contains 2,000 calories and 100 grams of fat.&quot;”Ritzer identifies four rationalizing dimensions of McDonald&#x27;s that contribute to the process of McDonaldization, claiming that McDonald&#x27;s aims to increase:
# Efficiency: McDonald&#x27;s delivers products quickly and easily without inputting an excessive amount of money. The &quot;McDonald&#x27;s model,&quot; and therefore the McDonald&#x27;s operations, follow a predesigned process that leads to a specified end, using productive means. The efficiency of the McDonald&#x27;s model has infiltrated other modern-day services such as completing tax forms online, easy weight loss programs, The Walt Disney Company FASTPASSes, and online dating services, eHarmony and match.com.
#Calculability: America has grown to connect the quantity of a product with the quality of a product and that &quot;bigger is better&quot;. The &quot;McDonald&#x27;s model&quot; is influential in this conception due to providing a lot of food for not that much money. While the end products feed into the connection between the quantity and quality of the product, so does the McDonald&#x27;s production process. Throughout the food production, everything is standardized and highly calculated: the size of the beef patty, the number of french fries per order, and the time spent in a franchise. The high calculability of the McDonald&#x27;s franchise also extends over into academics. It is thought that the academic experience, in high school and higher education, can be quantified into one number, the GPA. Also, calculability leads to the idea that the longer the resume or list of degrees, the better the candidate, during an application process. In addition to academics being affected by the McDonaldization in society, sports, most specifically basketball, have also been affected. It used to be that basketball was a more laid-back, slow-paced sort of game, yet through the creation of fast-food and McDonald&#x27;s, a shot clock was added to increase not only the speed of the game but also the number of points scored. 
#Predictability: Related to calculability, customers know what to expect from a given producer of goods or services. For example, customers know that every Big Mac from McDonald&#x27;s is going to be the same as the next one; there is an anticipated predictability to the menu as well as the overall experience. To maintain the predictability for each franchise, there has to be &quot;discipline, order, systematization, formalization, routine, consistency, and a methodical operation&quot;. The predictability of the McDonald&#x27;s franchise also appears through the golden arches in front of every franchise as well as the scripts that the employees use on the customers. The Walt Disney Company also has regulations in place, like dress codes for men and women, in order to add to the predictability of each amusement park or Disney operation. Predictability has also extended into movie sequels and TV shows. With each movie sequel, like &quot;Spy Kids 4&quot;, or TV show, &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; and its spinoffs, the plot is predictable and usually follow a preconceived model.
#Control: McDonald&#x27;s restaurants pioneered the idea of highly specialized tasks for all employees to ensure that all human workers are operating at exactly the same level. This is a way to keep a complicated system running smoothly; rules and regulations that make efficiency, calculability, and predictability possible. Oftentimes, the use of non-human technology, such as computers, is used. The McDonald&#x27;s food is already &quot;pre-prepared&quot;, the potatoes are already cut and processed, just needing to be fried and heated, and the food preparation process is monitored and tracked. The computers tell the managers how many hamburgers are needed at the lunchtime rush and other peak times and the size and shape of the pickles as well as how many go on a hamburger is managed and controlled. The control aspect of McDonaldization has extended to other businesses, Sylvan Learning and phone operating systems, and even birth and death. Every step of the learning process at Sylvan, the U-shaped tables and instruction manuals, is controlled as well as each step of the birthing process, in modern-day hospitals, and the process of dying.

McDonaldization is profitable, desirable, and at the cutting edge of technological advances. Many &quot;McDonald&#x27;s&quot; aspects of society are beneficial to the advancement and enhancement of human life. Some claim that rationalization leads to &quot;more egalitarian&quot; societies. For example, supermarkets and large grocery stores offer variety and availability unlike smaller farmer&#x27;s markets from generations past. The McDonaldization of society also allows operations to be more productive, improve the quality of some products, and produce services and products at lower cost. The Internet has provided countless new services to people that were previously impossible, such as checking bank statements without having to go to a bank or being able to purchase things online without leaving the house. These things are all positive effects of the rationalization and McDonaldization of society.

However, McDonaldization also alienates people and creates a disenchantment of the world. The increased standardization of society dehumanizes people and institutions. The &quot;assembly line&quot; feel of fast-food restaurants is transcending many other facets of life and removing humanity from previously human experiences. Through implementing machines and computers in society, humans can start to &quot;behave like machines&quot; and therefore &quot;become replaced by machines&quot;.

&quot;The McDonaldization of Society&quot; has been translated into over a dozen languages and is arguably one of the best selling monographs in the history of American sociology.

=== Consumption ===

Karl Marx was one of the first to establish a field of sociological theory surrounding consumption and its flaws. Consumption refers to the participation in purchasing and absorbing the products of capitalist society, as well as their effect. The topic of consumption in sociology has skyrocketed since Marx&#x27;s time, primarily in Europe from the mid-late 1900s. Since, consumption has become a basis of study within the science. An early admirer of Jean Baudrillard’s &quot;Consumer Society&quot; (1970), Ritzer is a leading proponent of the study of consumption. In addition to his beliefs expressed in &quot;The McDonaldization of Society&quot;, the most important sources for Ritzer’s sociology of consumption are his edited Explorations in the &quot;Sociology of Consumption: Fast Food Restaurants, Credit Cards and Casinos&quot; (2001), &quot;Enchanting a Disenchanted World: Revolutionizing the Means of Consumption&quot; (2nd edition 2005, 3rd edition 2009), and &quot;Expressing America: A Critique of the Global Credit-Card Society&quot; (1995). Ritzer is also a founding editor, with Don Slater, of Sage&#x27;s &quot;Journal of Consumer Culture&quot;.

=== Prosumption ===
First coined by Alvin Toffler in 1980, the term prosumption is used by Ritzer and Jurgenson, to break down the false dichotomy between production and consumption and describe the dual identity of economic activities. Ritzer argues that prosumption is the primordial form of economic activities, and the current ideal separation between production and consumption is aberrant and distorted due to the effect of both Industrial Revolution and post-WWII American consumption boom. It has only recently become popularly acknowledged that the existence of prosumption as activities on the internet and Web 2.0 resemble prosumption much more so than production or consumption individually. Various online activities require the input of consumers such as Wikipedia entries, Facebook profiles, Twitter, Blog, Myspace, Amazon preferences, eBay auctions, Second Life, etc.
Ritzer argues that we should view all economic activities on a continuum of prosumption with prosumption as production (p-a-p) and prosumption as consumption (p-a-c) on each pole.

=== Something vs. Nothing ===
According to Ritzer, &quot;Something&quot; is a locally conceived and controlled social form that is comparatively rich in distinctive substantive content. It also describes things as being fairly unusual. &quot;Nothing&quot; is &quot;a social form that is generally centrally conceived, controlled and comparatively devoid of distinctive substantive content&quot; &quot;Nothing&quot; usually aims at the standardized and homogenous, while &quot;something&quot; refers to things that are personal or have local flavor. Examples of &quot;nothing&quot; are McDonald&#x27;s, Wal-Mart, Starbucks, credit cards, and the Internet. Examples of &quot;something&quot; are local sandwich shops, local hardware stores, family arts and crafts places, or a local breakfast cafe.
Ritzer believes that things that embody the &quot;nothing&quot; component of this dichotomy are taking over and pushing &quot;something&quot; out of society. He explains the advantages and disadvantages of both &quot;something&quot; and &quot;nothing&quot; in &quot;The McDonaldization of Society&quot;.

=== Globalization ===
In Ritzer&#x27;s research, globalization refers to the rapidly increasing worldwide integration and interdependence of societies and cultures. This book presents a sophisticated argument about the nature of globalization in terms of the consumption of goods and services. He defines it as involving a worldwide diffusion of practices, relations, and forms of social organization and the growth of global consciousness. The concept of &quot;something&quot; vs. &quot;nothing&quot; plays a large part in understanding Ritzer&#x27;s Globalization. Society is becoming bombarded with &quot;nothing&quot; and Ritzer seems to believe that the globalization of &quot;nothing&quot; is almost unstoppable Ritzer&#x27;s aforementioned &quot;The Globalization of Nothing&quot; (2004/2007) stakes out a provocative perspective in the ongoing and voluminous globalization discourse. For Ritzer, globalization typically leads to consumption of vast quantities of serial social forms that have been centrally conceived and controlled – one McDonald&#x27;s hamburger, i.e., one instance of nothing again and again- dominates social life (Ritzer, George. 2004. &quot;The Globalization of Nothing&quot;. Thousand Oaks, CA: Pine Forge Press).
To better understand globalization, it can be broken down into a few characteristics:
* The beginning of global communication through different media like television and the Internet
* The formation of a &quot;global consciousness&quot;

In addition to &quot;The Globalization of Nothing&quot;, Ritzer has edited &quot;The Blackwell Companion to Globalization&quot; (2007), written &quot;Globalization: A Basic Text&quot; (2009), and edited an &quot;Encyclopedia of Globalization&quot; (forthcoming). Insight into Ritzer&#x27;s distinctive approach to globalization is available via a special review symposium in the Sage journal &quot;Thesis Eleven&quot; (Number 76, February 2004).

=== Grobalization ===
In his book &quot;The Globalization of Nothing&quot; (2004), Ritzer quotes that globalization consists of glocalization and grobalization.
Grobalization, a term coined by Ritzer himself, refers to &quot;imperialistic ambitions of nations, corporations, organizations, and the like and their desire, indeed need, to impose themselves on various geographic areas&quot;.
As opposite to glocalization, grobalization aims to &quot;overwhelm local&quot;. Its ultimate goal is to see profit grow through unilateral homogenization, thus earning its name &quot;gro&quot;balization. Capitalism, Americanization, and McDonaldization are all parts of grobalization.

Grobalization involves three motor forces: capitalism, McDonaldization, and Americanization. Grobalization creates a world where:
#Things are more homogenous and ubiquitous.
#Larger forces overwhelm the power of people to adapt and innovate in ways that preserve their autonomy.
#Social processes are coercive, determining the nature of local communities, which have little room to maneuver.
#Consumer goods and the media are key forces that largely dictate the nature of the self and the groups a person joins.

Ritzer provides American textbook as an example of grobalization. In his book, &quot;The Globalization of Nothing&quot;, he quotes that textbooks are &quot;oriented to rationalizing, McDonaldizing, the communication of information.&quot; Students, rather than evaluating the competing ideas, instead absorb the information given to them. Yet, these textbooks are surprisingly sold out worldwide, only to be slightly revised to reflect local standards.

=== Glocalization ===
Glocalization is a combination of the words &quot;globalization&quot; and &quot;localization&quot; used to describe a product or service that is developed and distributed globally, but is also fashioned to accommodate the user or consumer in a local market, causing the products, or results of glocalization, to vary depending on different locations. The term emphasizes global heterogeneity and rejects the notion that the norms and behaviors in West are leading to cultural homogeneity. The local individuals are able to manipulate their own situation in the world and become creative agents in what products and services are represented in their local environment within the glocalized world. Ritzer further explains Glocalization as a relatively benign process that is closest to the &quot;something&quot; end of things. It creates variety and heterogeneity within society. Ritzer has written about this term in his own works, demonstrating its connection to globalization and &quot;something vs. nothing&quot;.

=== Metatheory ===
Metatheory can be defined as the attainment of a deeper understanding of theory, the creation of new theory, and the creation of an overarching theoretical perspective. There are three types of metatheorizing: Mu, Mp, and Mo. Through the application of the three subsets of metatheory, Ritzer argues that the field of sociology can create a stronger foundation, experience &quot;rapid and dramatic growth&quot;, and generally increase not only the knowledge of metatheory but social theory in general.

The first category of metatheory (Mu), aims at being a means of attaining a deeper understanding of theory. Within the greater category of Mu, Ritzer establishes four other subsets: internal-intellectual, internal-social, external-intellectual, and external-social. The internal-intellectual sector of Mu identifies the &quot;schools of thought&quot; and the structure of current sociologists and social theories. The internal-social subtype identifies connections between sociologists and connections between sociologists and society. The last two subsets of Mu are looking more at the macrolevel of sociology than the other two subsets. The third subtype of Mu is the external-intellectual view of sociology; it looks at different studies and their concepts, tools, and ideas in order to apply these aspects to sociology. The fourth, and final, subset is external-social where the impact of social theory in a larger societal setting is studied.

The second (Mp), aims at being a prelude to theory development. New social theory is created due to the complex study and interpretation of other sociologists. For example, Karl Marx&#x27;s theories are based on Hegel&#x27;s theories. The theories of the American sociologist, Talcott Parsons, are based on the theories of Émile Durkheim, Max Weber, Vilfredo Pareto, and Alfred Marshall.

The last (Mo), aims at being a source of perspectives that overarch sociological theory. Influenced by Thomas Kuhn’s &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot; (1962), Ritzer has long advocated the view that social theory is improved by systematic, comparative and reflexive attention to implicit conceptual structures and oft-hidden assumptions.

Key works include &quot;Sociology: A Multiple Paradigm Science&quot; (1975), &quot;Toward an Integrated Sociological Paradigm&quot; (1981), &quot;Metatheorizing in Sociology&quot; (1991), and &quot;Explorations in Social Theory: From Metatheorizing to Rationalization&quot; (2001). See also Ritzer’s edited &quot;Metatheorizing&quot; (1992).

=== Modern and postmodern social theory ===
Ritzer is known to generations of students as the author of numerous comprehensive introductions and compendia in social theory. Postmodern society is a consumer society that invents new means of consumption, such as credit cards, shopping malls, and shopping networks. Today, &quot;Capitalism needs us to keep on spending at ever-increasing levels to be and remain capitalism.&quot; As with several of Ritzer&#x27;s other principal works, many are translated into languages as diverse as Chinese, Russian, Persian, Hebrew and Portuguese. Key volumes in this genre include &quot;The Sociological Theory&quot; (7th edition 2008), &quot;Classical Sociological Theory&quot; (5th edition 2008), and &quot;Modern Sociological Theory&quot; (7th edition 2008), &quot;Encyclopedia of Social Theory&quot; (2 vols. 2005), and &quot;Postmodern Social Theory&quot; (1997). For convenient access to many of Ritzer&#x27;s substantive contributions to modern and postmodern social theorizing, see &quot;Explorations in Social Theory: From Metatheorizing to Rationalization&quot; (2001) as well as more recent work often co-authored with his many students, such as (with J. Michael Ryan) &quot;Postmodern Social Theory and Sociology: On Symbolic Exchange with a ‘Dead’ Theory,&quot; in &quot;Reconstructing Postmodernism: Critical Debates&quot; (2007).

== Works ==

Ritzer has published many monographs and textbooks. He has edited three encyclopedias, including the &quot;Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology&quot;. He has written approximately one hundred scholarly articles in respected journals.

=== &quot;Sociology: A Multiple Paradigm Science&quot; (1975, 1980) ===

Based on his original article appearing in the &quot;American Sociologist&quot;, this book provides a foundation for Ritzer&#x27;s other works on metatheory. The piece applies Thomas Kuhn&#x27;s idea of scientific paradigms to sociology and demonstrating that sociology is a science consisting of multiple paradigms. Ritzer also discusses what implications this has for the field of sociology.

=== &quot;Toward an Integrated Sociological Paradigm&quot; (1981) ===

In this book, Ritzer contends that sociology needs an integrated paradigm in order to add to the extant paradigms noted in &quot;Sociology: A Multiple Paradigm Science&quot;. Ritzer proposes an integrated paradigm dealing with the interrelationships between the many levels of social reality.

=== &quot;Metatheorizing in Sociology (1991)&quot; ===
This paper describes and makes the case for sociological metatheorizing, or the systematic study of sociological theory. Three types of metatheorizing are delineated on the basis of their end products: the attainment of a deeper understanding of theory, the creation of new theory, and the creation of an overarching theoretical perspective (a metatheory). The basic problems in metatheorizing are reviewed and it is concluded that the most basic difficulty has been the lack of a clear definition of the subfield. Some thoughts on the future of metatheorizing in sociology are offered.

=== &quot;The McDonaldization of Society&quot; (1993) ===

In this provocative book, George Ritzer explores how Weber&#x27;s classic thoughts on rationalization take on new vitality and meaning when applied to the process of McDonaldization. He describes this as the process by which the principles of the fast food restaurants are coming to dominate more and more sectors of society in the United States as well as the rest of the world. George Ritzer is most well known for The McDonaldization of Society, which has five different editions and has sold over 175,000 copies as of 2007.

Ritzer shows how Weber&#x27;s central characteristics of rationalized systems - efficiency, predictability, calculability, substitution of non-human for human technology and control over uncertainty - have found widespread expression in a broad range of organized human activity, including travel, consumer products and services, education, leisure, politics and religion as well as in the fast food industry.

=== &quot;The Blackwell Companion to Major Contemporary Social Theorists&quot; (2003) ===

Guide to thirteen leading social theorists: Robert K. Merton, Erving Goffman, Richard M. Emerson, James Coleman, Harold Garfinkel, Daniel Bell, Norbert Elias, Michel Foucault, Jürgen Habermas, Anthony Giddens, Pierre Bourdieu, Jean Baudrillard, Judith Butler.
During the Introduction of this book, Ritzer writes, “Although any list of theorists covered in a collection such as this one can be read as an official cannon, this book is intended to be used as ‘cannon fodder’ in an open, contestable process of theory construction and reconstruction.&quot;

=== &quot;The Globalization of Nothing&quot;, Second Edition (2007) ===
&quot;The Globalization of Nothing&quot;, Second Edition emphasizes the processes of globalization and how they relate to McDonaldization. As before, this book is structured around four sets of concepts addressing the issues of: &quot;places/non-places,&quot; &quot;things/non-things,&quot; &quot;people/non-people,&quot; and &quot;services/non-services.&quot; By drawing upon salient examples from everyday life, Ritzer invites the reader to examine the nuances of these concepts in conjunction with the paradoxes within the process of the globalization of nothing. Critical questions are raised throughout, and the reader is compelled not only to seek answers to these questions, but also to critically evaluate the questions as well as their answers. The current edition features a greater emphasis on the main topic of globalization: a new first chapter offers an introductory overview of globalization and globalization theory, outlining the unique ways in which these topics are addressed throughout the text. It also delves into two subprocesses of globalization — &quot;glocalization&quot; and &quot;grobalization.&quot;

=== &quot;Enchanting a Disenchanted World&quot;, Third Edition (2009) ===

&quot;Enchanting a Disenchanted World&quot;, Third Edition examines Disney, malls, cruise lines, Las Vegas, the World Wide Web, McDonald&#x27;s, Planet Hollywood, credit cards, and all the other ways we now consume. The current edition was updated to reflect the recent economic recession and the impact of the internet. Ritzer continues to explore this book&#x27;s central thesis: that our society has undergone fundamental change because of the way and the level at which we consume. The third edition demonstrates how we have created new &quot;cathedrals&quot; of consumption (places that enchant us so as to entice us to stay longer and consume more) while continuing to take capitalism to a new level. These places of consumption, whether in our homes, the mall, or cyberspace, are in a constant state of &quot;enchanting the disenchanted,&quot; luring us through new spectacles because their rational qualities are both necessary and deadening at the same time. The book also includes a wide range of theoretical perspectives — Marxian, Weberian, critical theory, postmodern theory — as well as a number of concepts such as hyperconsumption, implosion, simulation, and time and space to show the audience how sociological theory can be applied to everyday phenomena.

=== &quot;Globalization: A Basic Text (2010)&quot; ===
The first full-scale textbook of its kind, Globalization: A Basic Text provides a balanced introduction to the major topics in globalization studies. Written in a highly accessible style, and drawing on sources both academic and popular, the book adopts a definition of globalization that emphasizes transplanetary flows and the structures that both expedite and impede those flows. Driven by a range of theories from imperialism and Americanization (and anti-Americanism), to neo-liberalism and the neo-Marxian alternatives, as well the major types of cultural theory, the book examines the key events in the history of globalization, and the principle flows and structures produced in the course of that history. Among the major topics covered are the economy, culture, technology, media and the Internet, migration, the environment, global inequalities, and the future of globalization. Making extensive use of maps and with a glossary of key terms, this book offers the reader not only a descriptive, but also acritical, analysis of globalization.

=== &quot;Introduction to Sociology (2012)&quot; ===
Introductory textbook co-written with Wendy Wiedenhoft Murphy, this piece serves to illustrate relevance of sociology to daily life for beginning sociology students. The text highlights primary sociological concepts as well as basic theory, with an emphasis on Ritzer&#x27;s largest areas of study: McDonaldization, consumerism, and sociology of the digital age. The textbook is on its fifth edition as of August 2019, which features new contemporary examples featured within &quot;Digital Living&quot; boxes, which emphasize the ever-changing and present digital modernizations to the world and their impact.

=== &quot;The McDonaldization of Society: 20th Anniversary Edition&quot; (2012) ===
Ritzer&#x27;s &quot;McDonaldization of Society&quot;, now celebrating its 20th anniversary, continues to stand as one of the pillars of modern-day sociological thought. By linking theory to 21st-century culture, this book resonates with audiences in a way that few other books do, opening their eyes to many current issues, especially in consumption and globalization. As in previous editions, the book has been updated and it offers new discussions of, among others, In-N-Out Burger and Pret a Manger as possible antitheses of McDonaldization. The biggest change, however, is that the book has been streamlined to offer an even clearer articulation of the McDonaldization thesis. The final chapter also looks at &quot;The DeMcDonaldization of Society&quot;, and concludes that while it is occurring on the surface, McDonaldization is alive and well.

=== &quot;Sociological Theory, Ninth Edition (2013)&quot;===

George Ritzer and Jeffery Stepnisky are co-authors this book. The book is split into four parts.
Part One goes into specific details about the early years of sociological theory, focusing on Karl Marx, Emile Durkheim, Max Weber, and Georg Simmel. 
Part Two shifts into modern sociological theories, such as Structural Functionalism, Systems Theory, Conflict Theory, varieties of Neo-Marxism Theory, Symbolic Interactionism, Ethnomethodology, Exchange, Network, and Rational Choice Theories, Contemporary Feminist Theory.
Part Three covers Integrative Sociological Theory, specifically Micro-Macro and Agency-Structure Integration.
Part Four is focused on contemporary Theories of Modernity, Globalization Theory, Structuralism, Poststructuralism, and Postmodern Social Theory, and Social Theory in the Twenty-First Century.

=== &quot;Essentials of Sociology (2014)&quot; ===
Adaptation of &quot;Introduction to Sociology (2012),&quot; with the intention of being shorter and more streamlined. Includes same primary content (see &quot;Intro to Sociology 2012&quot;). On fourth edition as of December 2019.

=== &quot;Globalization: A Basic Text Second Edition (2015)&quot; ===
Updated to reflect recent global developments, the second edition of &quot;Globalization: A Basic Text&quot; presents an up-to-date introduction to major trends and topics relating to globalization studies.

=== &quot;Globalization: A Basic Text Third Edition (2022)&quot; ===
In the comprehensively revised Third Edition of &quot;Globalization: A Basic Text&quot;, distinguished researchers and authors George Ritzer and Paul Dean deliver an up-to-date introduction to major trends and topics related to the study of globalization. The book includes accessible and rigorous material on the key theories and major topics in globalization, as well as modern developments like the rise of populism and far-right political groups, Brexit, migration and backlash to it, trade negotiations, social media and the spread of misinformation, climate change, social justice issues, and COVID-19.

<text>Tore Olaus Engset (May 8, 1865 – October, 1943 in Oslo) was a Norwegian mathematician and engineer who did pioneering work in the field of telephone traffic queuing theory.
Tore Olaus Engset was born at Stranda in Møre og Romsdal, Norway. After he graduated school at the age of 18, Engset was admitted to the telegraph school in Stavanger in 1883. He received his certificate in a year and took employment. In his spare time he continued his studies, graduating in 1892 but continuing his university studies. Engset received an M.Sc. in physics and mathematics in 1894 at University of Oslo, after which he worked at Televerket as office worker, traffic analyst and from 1921 to 1922 and 1930–35 director general.
He developed the Engset formula in 1915, before the breakthroughs of A. K. Erlang from 1917. His 1915 manuscript &quot;Om beregningen av vælgere i et automatisk telefonsystem&quot; (1915) was not, however, published until 1918. That work was translated to German as &quot;Die Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung zur Bestimmung der Wählerzahl in automatischen Fernsprechämtern&quot;, in &quot;Elektrotechnische Zeitschrift&quot;, Heft 31, 1918. An English translation appeared in Arne Myskja, &quot;On the Calculation of Switches in an Automatic Telephone System&quot; in &quot;Telektronikk&quot;, 94(2):99-142, 1998.

He also published a work on nuclear physics (1927): &quot;Die Bahnen und die Lichtstrahlung der Wasserstoffelektronen. Ergänzende Betrachtungen über Bahnformen und Strahlungsfrequenzen&quot; (3 parts) in &quot;Annalen der Physik&quot;, 82 (1927) 1017; 83 (1927) 903; 84 (1927) 880.

<text>Personal life is the course or state of an individual&#x27;s life, especially when viewed as the sum of personal choices contributing to one&#x27;s personal identity.

Apart from hunter-gatherers, most pre-modern peoples&#x27; time was limited by the need to meet necessities such as food and shelter through subsistence farming; leisure time was scarce.
People identified with their social role in their community and engaged in activities based on necessity rather than on personal choice. Privacy in such communities was rare.

The modern conception of &quot;personal life&quot; is an offshoot of modern Western society. Modern people tend to distinguish their work activities from their personal life and may seek work–life balance.
It is a person&#x27;s choices and preferences outside of work that define personal life, including one&#x27;s choice of hobbies, cultural interests, manner of dress, mate, friends, and so on. In particular, what activities one engages in during leisure-time defines a person&#x27;s personal life. Religious authorities, moralists, managers and personal-development gurus have seized on the concept of an individual life as a fulcrum for potential control and manipulation.

People in Western countries, such as the United States and Canada, tend to value privacy. Privacy includes both information privacy and decisional privacy; people expect to be left alone with respect to intimate details of their life and they expect to be free from undue control by others.

==History==
In the past, before modern technology largely alleviated issues of economic scarcity in industrialised countries, most people spent a large portion of their time attempting to provide their basic survival needs, including water, food, and protection from the weather. Humans needed survival skills for the sake of both themselves and their community; food needed to be harvested and shelters needed to be maintained. There was little privacy in a community, and people identified one another according to their social role. Jobs were assigned out of necessity rather than personal choice.

Furthermore, individuals in many ancient cultures primarily viewed their self-existence under the aspect of a larger social whole, often one with mythological underpinnings which placed the individual in relation to the cosmos. People in such cultures found their identity not through their individual choices—indeed, they may not have been able to conceive a choice which was purely individual. Such individuals, if asked to describe themselves, would speak of the collective of which they were part: the tribe, the Church, the nation. Even in the 21st century, survival issues dominate in many countries and societies. For example, the continents of Africa and Asia are still largely mired in poverty and third-world conditions, without technology, secure shelter, or reliable food sources. In such places, the concepts of a &quot;personal life&quot;, &quot;self-actualization&quot;, &quot;personal fulfillment&quot;, or &quot;privacy&quot; are often unaffordable luxuries.

The English philosopher John Locke (1632–1704) figures among the pioneers in discussing the concept of individual rights. In the 17th century he promoted the natural rights of the individual to life, liberty, and property, and included the pursuit of happiness as one of the individual&#x27;s goals.

==Sociology==


The notion of a personal life, as currently understood in the west is in part an artefact of modern Western society. People in the United States of America, especially, place a high value on privacy. Since the colonial period, commentators have noted Americans&#x27; individualism and their pursuit of self-definition.
Indeed, the United States Declaration of Independence and the Constitution explicitly raise the pursuit of happiness and the expectation of privacy to the level of rights.

George Lakoff sees the metaphor of life as &quot;a journey&quot; as a noteworthy structuring idea in &quot;our culture&quot;.
Compare the traditional Chinese concept of tao.

In modern times, many people have come to think of their personal lives as separate from their work.
This 9 to 5 paradigm regards work and recreation as distinct; one is either on the job or not, and the transition is abrupt. Employees have certain hours they are bound to work, and work during recreational time is rare. This may reflect the continuing specialisation of jobs and the demand for increased efficiency, both at work and at home. The common phrase &quot;Work hard, play hard&quot; illustrates this mindset. There is a growing trend, however, towards living more holistically and minimising such rigid distinctions between work and play, in order to achieve an &quot;appropriate&quot; work–life balance.

The concept of personal life also tends to be associated with the way individuals dress, the food they eat, their schooling and further education as well as their hobbies, leisure activities, and cultural interests. Increasingly, in the developed world, a person&#x27;s daily life is also influenced by leisure-time use of consumer electronics such as televisions, computers and the Internet, mobile phones and digital cameras.

Other factors affecting personal life include individuals&#x27; health, personal relationships, pets as well as home and personal possessions.

==Leisure activities==

The way in which individuals make use of their spare time also plays an important role in defining their personal lives. In general, leisure activities can be categorised as either passive, in cases when no real effort is required, or active, when substantial physical or mental energy is needed.

Passive activities include watching television, listening to music, watching sports activities or going to the cinema. The individual simply relaxes without any special effort.

Active activities may be more or less intensive ranging from walking, through jogging and cycling to sports such as tennis or football. Playing chess or undertaking creative writing might also be considered as demanding as these require a fair amount of mental effort.

Based on 2007 data, a US survey on use of leisure time found that the daily use of leisure time by individuals over 15 averaged 4.9 hours. Of this, more than half (2.6 hours) went on watching TV while only 19 minutes involved active participation in sports and exercise.

==Privacy==

Privacy has been understood as entailing two different concepts; namely informational privacy and decisional privacy. The former concerns the right to be left alone in respect of the most intimate details of one&#x27;s personal life and is a more accepted doctrine than the latter which concerns freedom from undue regulation and control.

<text>Agilent Technologies, Inc. is an American global company headquartered in Santa Clara, California, that provides instruments, software, services, and consumables for laboratories. Agilent was established in 1999 as a spin-off from Hewlett-Packard. The resulting IPO of Agilent stock was the largest in the history of Silicon Valley at the time. From 1999 to 2014, the company produced optics (LED, laser), semiconductors, EDA software and test and measurement equipment for electronics; that division was spun off to form Keysight. Since then, the company has continued to expand into pharmaceutical, diagnostics &amp; clinical, and academia &amp; government (research) markets.

== Products and services ==

Agilent serves analytical laboratories and the clinical and routine diagnostics markets with a full suite of technology platforms. These include: automation, bioreagents, FISH probes, gas and liquid chromatography, immunohistochemistry, informatics, mass spectrometry, microarrays, spectroscopy, target enrichment, and vacuum technologies. 

Agilent also provides lab management services, including enterprise asset management, laboratory business intelligence, equipment management and service, software maintenance, regulatory compliance, sample preparation, genomics and cloning, GC and HPLC columns, spectrometry and spectroscopy supplies, and consumables. The company is known for investing in R&amp;D within its own research labs and those of leading universities to advance the state of knowledge in the life sciences, diagnostics, and chemical analysis space.

In recent years, the company has advanced digital lab instrumentation and technology that improves lab workflow and overall efficiency and productivity. In 2020, Agilent introduced CrossLab Virtual Assist, a mobile app that facilities high-quality remote technical support. Agilent’s digital advancements, including CrossLab Connect, have also improved lab optimization and sustainability by providing more efficient utilization of instruments, which can lower a lab’s energy consumption.

Agilent is also a pioneer of the target enrichment used as part of a NGS workflow. The portfolio also includes sample prep, QA/QC instrumentation, 2100 bioanalyzers, and automation tools. 

In early 2023, the company announced a $725 million expansion of its nucleic acid-based therapeutics manufacturing facility in Frederick, Colorado.

== History ==
Agilent Technologies was created in 1999 as a spin-off of several business units of Hewlett-Packard including test &amp; measurement, optics, instrumentation and chemical analysis, electronic components, and medical equipment product lines. The split was predicated on the difficulty of growing HP&#x27;s revenue stream and on the competitive vigor of smaller, more agile competitors. The company&#x27;s launch slogan was &quot;Innovating the HP Way&quot;, which capitalized on the strong HP corporate culture. The starburst logo was selected to reflect &quot;a burst of insight&quot; (or &quot;spark of insight&quot;) and the name &quot;Agilent&quot; aimed to invoke the notion of agility as a trait of the new firm. The Agilent spin-off was accompanied by an initial public offering which raised $2.1 billion, setting a record at the time.

=== 2000–2009 ===
In the early 2000s, &quot;economic uncertainty&quot; depressed demand for Agilent&#x27;s products, including slow sales of health care products to hospitals in the United States, which accounted for 60% of the company&#x27;s revenue at the time. The downturn also struck sales in the communications and semiconductor markets, where orders amounting to $500 million were canceled by buyers. These poor economic conditions prompted large reductions in force; from a headcount in 1999 of 35,000, which had risen to 48,000 by May 2001, it had by early 2003 cut 18,500 positions. In 2001, in midst of this downsizing, Agilent sold its health care and medical products organization to Philips Medical Systems, and was noted as having a valuation of about $11 billion. HP Medical Products had been the second oldest part of Hewlett-Packard, acquired in the 1950s.

In August 2005, Agilent announced the sale of its business which produced semiconductor integrated circuits (known as &quot;chips&quot;) for consumer and industrial uses to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Silver Lake Partners for $2.66 billion. This move was part of a broad effort to concentrate &quot;on the test-and-measurement business at its historic core,&quot; and would entail termination of about 1,300 of the company&#x27;s 28,000 employees. The group operated as a private company, Avago Technologies, until August 2009, when it was brought public in an IPO. After purchasing Broadcom Corporation in 2016, Avago changed its name to Broadcom Limited.

Also in August 2005, Agilent sold its 47% stake in the light-emitting diode manufacturer Lumileds to Philips for $1 billion. Lumileds originally started as Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s optoelectronics division.

Also in August 2005, Agilent announced a plan to divest its semiconductor test business, composed of both the system-on-chip and memory test market areas. Agilent listed the new company as Verigy on the Nasdaq in mid-2006.

===2010 onwards===
In 2009, Agilent announced the closure of a subsection of its Test &amp; Measurement division. The product lines affected included the automated optical inspection, solder paste inspection, and automated products [5DX] in 2004. In 2011, the company, along with the University of California, Davis, announced that it would be establishing the &quot;Davis Millimeter Wave Research Center&quot;. Agilent announced it would increase its life sciences engagement through the acquisition of Halo Genomics, based in Uppsala, Sweden, which was involved in next-generation sequencing technology development.

On May 17, 2012, Agilent agreed to buy Dako, a Danish cancer diagnostics company, for $2.2 billion, to expand its presence in the life sciences industry.

On September 19, 2013, Agilent announced its decision to separate into two publicly traded companies: Agilent, a life sciences, diagnostics, and applied markets company, and an electronic measurement company. The life sciences company retained the Agilent name and the electronic measurement company was called Keysight Technologies. On October 14, 2014, the company announced that it is exiting its Nuclear Magnetic Resonance business. On November 1, the formal separation of Agilent and Keysight Technologies was completed. Agilent announced it had completed the spin-off of its electronic measurement business, Keysight Technologies. 

Hewlett-Packard Co., Agilent&#x27;s predecessor, acquired F&amp;M Scientific Corp., maker of gas chromatographs, on August 8, 1965. In September 2015, the company announced it would acquire Seahorse Bioscience for $235 million.

On July 7, 2016, Agilent announced that they had acquired U.K. based Cobalt Light Systems, which develops and manufactures Raman spectroscopy instruments, for £40 million in cash. In December the company acquired Multiplicom N.V.

In January 2018, the company announced it would acquire Luxcel Biosciences, increasing the company&#x27;s cell analysis portfolio. In May, Agilent acquired Lasergen, Inc. after the end of its two-year option on a prior investment. In the same month it acquired digital laboratory management company, Genohm, Ultra Scientific, provider of chemical standards and reference materials and Advanced Analytical Technologies, Inc. (AATI), provider of capillary electrophoresis-based molecules for $250 million in cash. In August the company announced it would acquire glycan reagent producer, ProZyme, Inc. and South Korean instrument distributor, Young In Scientific Co. Ltd. In September Agilent acquired ACEA Biosciences for $250 million increasing the company&#x27;s presence in cell analysis technologies. In August 2019, Agilent acquired US-based BioTek Instruments, a designer, manufacturer, and distributor of life science instrumentation, for $1.165 billion.

On May 1, 2024, Padraig McDonnell succeeded Mike McMullen as CEO.

<doc id="162469" wikidata="Q1075994" url="?curid=162469" title="Special Broadcasting Service">
<text>The Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) is an Australian hybrid-funded public service broadcaster. About 80 percent of funding for the company is derived from tax revenue. SBS operates six TV channels (SBS, SBS Viceland, SBS World Movies, SBS Food, NITV and SBS WorldWatch) and seven radio networks (SBS Radios 1, 2 and 3, Arabic24, SBS Chill, SBS South Asian and SBS PopAsia). SBS Online is home to SBS On Demand video streaming service. 
The stated purpose of SBS is &quot;to provide multilingual and multicultural radio and television services that inform, educate and entertain all Australians and, in doing so, reflect Australia&#x27;s multicultural society&quot;. SBS is one of five main free-to-air networks in Australia.

SBS formally came into existence in 1978 as a radio network. Full-time transmission began on a new television channel in 1980. In-show advertising commenced in 2006. Commercial breaks are set at five minutes per hour. SBS&#x27;s most successful imported television series is &quot;South Park&quot;.

==History==
As a result of extensive post-World War II immigration to Australia and the end of the White Australia Policy, the federal government began to consider the need for &quot;ethnic broadcasting&quot; – programming targeted at ethnic minorities and mostly delivered in languages other than English. Until 1970, radio stations were prevented by law from broadcasting in foreign languages for more than 2.5 hours per week. In June 1975 at the behest of Minister for Immigration Al Grassby, two &quot;experimental&quot; radio stations began broadcasting: 2EA in Sydney and 3EA in Melbourne (EA stood for &quot;Ethnic Australia&quot;), partly to publicise the Whitlam government&#x27;s social policy changes to ethnic communities. In March 1976, the Fraser government established the Consultative Committee on Ethnic Broadcasting, followed by the National Ethnic Broadcasting Advisory Council in January 1977. Initially, it was considered feasible for ethnic broadcasting to be delivered by the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC); however, this plan was abandoned in mid-1977.

In October 1977, the government announced the creation of SBS as a new independent statutory authority for ethnic broadcasting. This was achieved as a result of an amendment to the &quot;Broadcasting Act 1942&quot;. SBS formally came into existence on 1 January 1978. The inaugural Chair of SBS was Grisha Sklovsky, and the inaugural executive director was Ronald Fowell. The service was initially a radio network, and had oversight only of the two existing stations 2EA and 3EA. It was always intended that it would be enlarged, but this process was controversial – the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations wanted the television functions to be controlled by the ABC.

In March 1979, the government set up the Ethnic Television Review Panel, which recommended that SBS should expand multilingual services into television. SBS TV began test transmissions in April 1979 when it showed various foreign language programs on ABV-2 Melbourne and ABN-2 Sydney on Sunday mornings. Full-time transmission began on a new television channel at 6:30 pm on 24 October 1980 (United Nations Day). The first program shown was a documentary entitled &quot;Who Are We?&quot;, which was hosted by veteran news presenter Peter Luck. At the time, SBS was broadcasting on UHF Channel 28 and VHF Channel 0 (pronounced as &quot;oh&quot; and not &quot;zero&quot;), with a planned discontinuation of the latter at some time in the future. Bruce Gyngell, who introduced television to Australia in 1956, was given the task of introducing the first batch of programs on the new station.

SBS programming content was initially imported from the suppliers in the countries-of-origin of Australia&#x27;s major migrant communities and then subtitled into English.

In October–November 1983, the service expanded to service the centres of Canberra, Cooma and Goulburn, subsequently changing its name to Network 0–28. Its new slogan was the eventual long-running &quot;Bringing the World Back Home&quot;. The network changed its name to simply SBS in February 1985 and soon began daytime transmissions. SBS also expanded to the cities of Brisbane, Adelaide, Newcastle, Wollongong and the Gold Coast in June of that year.

On 5 January 1986, SBS ceased broadcasting on the VHF channel 0 frequency. Although many Australians at the time did not have UHF antennas, SBS&#x27;s VHF licence had already been extended by a year at this stage and not all antennas had worked well with the low-frequency Channel 0.

In August 1986, the government proposed legislation that would amalgamate SBS into the ABC. This was highly unpopular with ethnic-minority communities, and after protests from both SBS staff and communities, resulted in the Prime Minister of Australia, Bob Hawke announcing in 1987 that the proposed amalgamation would not proceed. The SBS Radio and Television Youth Orchestra was soon launched in 1988 with founding conductor Matthew Krel.

Plans to introduce limited commercial-program sponsorship, as well as the establishment of SBS as an independent corporation with its own charter, were put in place in July 1989. A program called &quot;Eat Carpet&quot;, showcasing local and international short films, was also launched in 1989. The passage into law of the Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991 officially made SBS a corporation in 1991. Throughout the early 1990s, SBS TV coverage was expanded further to include new regional areas such as the Latrobe Valley, Spencer Gulf, Darwin, northeast Tasmania, Cairns and Townsville.

In 1992, SBS&#x27;s radio and television facilities were gradually relocated to new premises in Artarmon, New South Wales. Radio services were initially located in Bondi Junction and television services in Milsons Point. The new building was officially opened on 10 November 1993 by the prime minister, Paul Keating, and a national radio network was launched in January 1994. The new service initially covered Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, and Darwin, while original stations 2EA and 3EA were renamed Radio Sydney and Radio Melbourne respectively. However, the new national service was launched on a separate frequency in Sydney and Melbourne in July of that year. Throughout 1996, the radio services were expanded to cover Hobart and Canberra, while SBS TV&#x27;s coverage was further expanded to include the New South Wales North Coast and the town of Albury.

Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;South Park&quot;, SBS&#x27;s most successful imported television series, was first aired in 1997. A time-delay system was installed for South Australia in May 1999, shortly before the establishment of the Transmission Services division (intended to manage transmission and self-help services). A New Media division, responsible for the SBS website, was established at the start of 2000 in time for the first webcast of the Australian Film Institute Awards. Ratings continued to increase through 2000 to 2001 – increasing to an overall 5.2% average weekly audience share.

In April 2003, SBS Radio dropped four languages from its schedule, Irish, Scots Gaelic, Welsh, and Belarusian, and added four others, Amharic, Nepalese, Malay, and Somali, while increasing the broadcast hours for Cantonese, Mandarin, and Arabic. SBS broadcast the 2004 Athens Olympics in partnership with the Seven Network. and also broadcast Euro 2008 in Austria and Switzerland.
Tagalog, Vietnamese and Arabic language broadcasts were added to SBS&#x27;s &quot;WorldWatch&quot; television schedule in 2003. However, the Vietnamese community protested the Vietnamese-language service, whose content was taken from VTV4, Vietnam&#x27;s government-controlled national broadcaster. They found the portrayal of the communist Vietnamese flag and Ho Chi Minh offensive and stated that the program&#x27;s lack of reporting on political arrests and religious oppression was also offensive, especially to those who had fled the country following the Vietnam War. This backlash prompted SBS to remove the bulletin from schedule and from then on to display disclaimers before all externally produced bulletins in order to distance it from the content.

In May 2008, SBS unveiled a new-look logo as well as a new backronymic slogan: &quot;Six Billion Stories and counting&quot;.

On 8 May 2012, SBS received $158 million in government funding, of which $15 million would be used yearly, to fund the formation of a new free-to-air channel devoted to the indigenous peoples of Australia. which would replace the existing National Indigenous Television on 12 December 2012, with 90% of its staff transferring to this new channel. On 12 December 2012, NITV was re-launched as an SBS-operated free-to-air channel, replacing SBS4.

SBS is a supporter of same-sex marriage and pulled an anti-same-sex marriage advertisement ahead of its telecast of the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. Then managing director, Michael Ebeid, defended SBS&#x27;s position on the issue.

On 17 November 2015, the new food channel, SBS Food Network, was launched. On 17 November 2018, the channel became SBS Food.

In June 2016, SBS announced that SBS 2 was set to be rebranded as SBS Viceland with content from US-Canadian youth Vice Media from November 2016.

On 1 July 2019, SBS relaunched their former pay-TV movie channel, World Movies as SBS World Movies and it became a free-to-air channel.

On 12 January 2022, SBS announced that a sixth free-to-air television channel, with the working title SBS WorldWatch, would be launched in 2022. The channel would be free to air and would broadcast all foreign-language bulletins currently broadcast on SBS and SBS Viceland, and new locally-produced news bulletins in Arabic and Mandarin Chinese in prime time. The Arabic and Mandarin bulletins launched on 15 February 2022 through SBS On Demand, while the official trailer for the SBS WorldWatch channel was released six days later, which announced the launch date of 23 May.

==Services==
===Television===

Regardless of state or territory, SBS television services always use the callsign &quot;SBS&quot;. On 14 December 2006, SBS announced its intention to change to 720p as its high-definition transmission standard for SBS HD. SBS had previously down converted its scheduled SBS high-definition content to the 576p standard. On 5 June 2012, SBS upgraded its HD format from 720p to 1080i.

On 1 June 2006, the SBS managing director, Shaun Brown, announced the corporation&#x27;s desire to initiate in-show commercial breaks, in the same manner as the commercial television networks. He said that the move would raise $10 million in the first year, as he believes that SBS&#x27;s current strategy of showing ads between programs &quot;is unpopular with viewers&quot;. &quot;On average we lose more than half our audience during these breaks – this is 30 percent more than other broadcasters&quot;, claimed Brown upon announcing the new move.

SBS&#x27;s commercial breaks remained at their existing statutory limit of five minutes per hour, as opposed to the fifteen minutes per hour permitted on Australia&#x27;s fully commercial stations. An individual break lasted between one and two minutes. A related change was the launch of a one-hour edition of &quot;World News&quot;, replacing the half-hour &quot;World News Australia&quot; and &quot;World Sport&quot; programs. In-show advertising commenced on 9 October 2006 during the broadcast of &quot;MythBusters&quot;.

Former SBS television services are SBS Essential (LCN 31, sporting events, and other digital-only projects, when available) and SBS World News Channel (LCN 32, foreign news service).

====Subscription channels====
In 1995, SBS launched a new division called SBS Subscription TV. In October 1995, the first subscription channel to launch was World Movies; the channel focuses on independent international films. It was closed on 31 January 2018 but relaunched on free-to-air television on 1 July 2019. In April 2010, SBS launched Studio (previously marketed at as STVDIO); that channel focused on arts programming such as classical and popular music, literature, film, visual arts and dance with documentaries and performances. However, Studio closed down on 27 March 2015 and was replaced by Foxtel Arts.

===Radio===

SBS Radio broadcasts in 74 languages in all Australian states, producing an estimated 13,500 hours of Australian programming for its two frequencies in Sydney and Melbourne as well as for its national network. Much like SBS TV, SBS radio receives funding from a mix of government grants, paid-for government information campaigns and commercial advertising. SBS Radio broadcast the UEFA Euro 2008 in Austria and Switzerland.

Following &quot;extensive community consultation&quot; in 2003, SBS introduced a range of new programs, including services in Malay, Somali and Amharic – in addition to the expansion of many existing programs.

In April 2013, SBS rolled out a major overhaul of its radio schedule. The last major review of the SBS Radio schedule had taken place in 1994, and since then Australia&#x27;s demographics had changed significantly. With the new schedule SBS intends to better reflect Australia&#x27;s ethnic composition. With the addition of six new languages: Malayalam, Dinka, Hmong, Pashto, Swahili and Tigrinya, SBS has brought the total number of languages from 68 to 74.

SBS rolled out a trial of RDS (Radio Data System) in the Melbourne and Sydney broadcast areas in November 2012. Radio listeners can identify the SBS Radio service by the &quot;SBSRadio&quot; identifier and, if their radio permits, by RDS scrolling text on their FM-capable RDS radio.

NOW and NEXT data was progressively added to all radio services in 2012 and 2013. This now/next data is displayed on FM RDS Radio (Melbourne/Sydney) and DAB+ receptions areas for radios that can display metadata.

NOW and NEXT Radio schedule is also displayed on free-to-air Terrestrial Digital Television (DTV) program guides and on TiVo and TBox where applicable.

SBS rolled out the 14-day rolling radio schedule over DTV television in November 2012. A radio event (or program) can be viewed and booked/recorded to PVR or the listener reminded. The schedule adapts to daylight saving changes as required.

Following the Language Services Review in 2021, SBS re-introduced a range of new and existing programs in revised languages in November 2022.

===Other===
====On demand====

SBS on Demand is a video on demand and catch-up TV service run by SBS. In April 2016, SBS launched a video on demand application called &quot;SBS On Demand VR&quot;, later renamed &quot;SBS VR&quot;.

====Multilingual services====
SBS has been providing multilingual services since 1975. Alongside news and radio, the SBS in-language units in both Sydney and Melbourne, provide a range of language services for medium to large organisations, private and government businesses. These include accredited translations, typesetting, voiceovers/re-narration, subtitling and video services in over 68 languages.

====SBS independent====

SBS independent (SBSi) was the primary production unit of SBS programming, which existed from August 1994 to December 2007. At the end of 2007, SBS independent was merged with the SBS Content and Online Division.

====Youth orchestra====

The SBS Youth Orchestra was an Australian premier youth orchestra, founded in 1988 by the now late Matthew Krel. It was disbanded in 2013.

====SBS Sexuality====
An online platform that celebrates &quot;the diversity of sexuality in Australia and its multicultural communities&quot;.

====Film distribution====
SBS used to distribute films in the early 1990s. In 2014, SBS revived its film distribution division as SBS Movies, which then teamed up with SBS&#x27; home video distributor Madman Entertainment. Both SBS and Madman released the 2016 American film &quot;Hell or High Water&quot; in Oceania.

<doc id="162473" wikidata="Q948595" url="?curid=162473" title="Chuck Wepner">
<text>Charles Wepner (born February 26, 1939) is an American former professional boxer. He fell just nineteen seconds short of a full fifteen rounds against world heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali in a 1975 championship fight. Wepner also scored notable wins over Randy Neumann and former world heavyweight champion Ernie Terrell. He was also the last man to fight former undisputed world heavyweight champion Sonny Liston.

Wepner&#x27;s boxing career, and fight with Ali, inspired the 1976 film &quot;Rocky,&quot; and other life events were chronicled in the 2016 film, &quot;Chuck&quot;. He was also the subject of the 2019 film &quot;The Brawler&quot;.

== Early life ==
Charles Wepner was born on February 26, 1939, in New York City. He is of German, Ukrainian, and Polish descent.

Wepner learned to fight on the streets of Bayonne, New Jersey, saying, &quot;This was a tough town with a lot of people from the docks and the naval base and you had to fight to survive&quot;. Wepner was about a year old when he moved in with his grandmother on 28th Street near Hudson Boulevard (now Kennedy Boulevard). He was raised by his mother and grandparents, living in a room that was a converted coal shed until he was 13. He was an avid player of sports in his youth, playing basketball for the Police Athletic League. At Bayonne High School, his height helped him get a spot on the basketball team.

At the age of 15, Wepner decided he would join the U.S. Marines, inspired by the movie &quot;Battle Cry&quot;. In the Marines, he became a member of the boxing team, developing a reputation for being able to withstand other boxers&#x27; punches, and becoming a military champion at one of the airbases. A 1975 &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; article said that Wepner had saved the lives of three Marine pilots, pulling them from blazing airplanes.

== Career ==
Wepner turned professional in 1964 and became a popular boxer on the Northeast&#x27;s Club Boxing circuit, where he began posting many wins and some losses fighting throughout the region, including in arenas close to his boyhood home such as North Bergen and Secaucus.

Nicknamed &quot;The Bayonne Bleeder&quot; due to repeated facial injuries in the ring, he took the name that was initially meant as an insult and made it his &quot;nom de guerre&quot;. In an interview with the BBC, Wepner said &quot;I was a big bleeder. I had 328 stitches in my career. My nose was broken nine times in 16 years. And, uh, it never fazed me, you know?&quot;

He had formerly boxed while a member of the United States Marine Corps, and had worked as a bouncer before turning pro. He was the New Jersey state heavyweight boxing champion, but after losing bouts to George Foreman (by cut eye stoppage in three) and Sonny Liston (by technical knockout in nine) many boxing fans thought that his days as a contender were numbered. After the match with Liston, Wepner needed 72 stitches in his face. After his retirement, Wepner stated that Liston was the hardest puncher he ever fought.

However, after losing to Joe Bugner by a cut eye stoppage in three in England, Wepner won nine of his next eleven bouts, including victories over Charlie Polite and former WBA heavyweight champion Ernie Terrell.

=== Muhammad Ali fight ===
In 1975, it was announced that Wepner would challenge Muhammad Ali for the world heavyweight title. According to the &quot;Cleveland Plain Dealer&quot; (February 9, 1975, Page 4-C), Carl Lombardo invested $1.3 million to finance the Wepner-Ali heavyweight title bout. According to a &quot;Time&quot; article, &quot;In Stitches&quot;, Ali was guaranteed $1.5 million and Wepner signed for $100,000. This was considerably more than Wepner had ever earned; thus, he &quot;needed no coaxing.&quot; Wepner spent eight weeks training in the Catskill Mountains under the guidance of Al Braverman (trainer and noted cutman) and Bill Prezant (manager). 

Prezant prophesied that the match would be a big surprise. This bout was the first time Wepner had been able to train full-time; since 1970 his typical day had consisted of road work in the morning, followed by his job selling liquor during the day. Then he was able to spend his nights working out and sparring in Bayonne boxing clubs. The match was held on March 24 at the Richfield Coliseum in Richfield, Ohio, south of Cleveland. Before the match, a reporter asked Wepner if he thought he could survive in the ring with the champion, to which Wepner allegedly answered, &quot;I&#x27;ve been a survivor my whole life ... if I survived the Marines, I can survive Ali.&quot;

In the ninth round, Wepner scored a knockdown, which Ali said occurred because Wepner was stepping on his foot. Published photographs showed Wepner stepping on Ali&#x27;s foot at the time of the knockdown. Wepner went to his corner and said to his manager Al Braverman, &quot;Al, start the car. We&#x27;re going to the bank. We are millionaires.&quot; To this, Wepner&#x27;s manager replied: &quot;You better turn around. He&#x27;s getting up and he looks pissed off.&quot;

In the remaining rounds, Ali decisively outboxed Wepner and opened up cuts above both of Wepner&#x27;s eyes and broke his nose. Wepner was far behind on the scorecards when Ali knocked him down with 19 seconds left in the 15th round. The referee counted to seven before calling a technical knockout.

After the Ali-Wepner bout, Sylvester Stallone wrote the script for &quot;Rocky&quot;, which was released in theatres in 1976. Like Wepner, (Rocky) Balboa lasts 15 rounds, but unlike Wepner, he actually &quot;goes the distance&quot;. For years after &quot;Rocky&quot; was released, Stallone denied that Wepner provided inspiration for the movie, though he eventually admitted it.

=== Late career ===
In 1976, Wepner fought professional wrestler André the Giant and lost by countout after Andre threw him out of the ring.

Wepner&#x27;s last match was on May 2, 1978, for the New Jersey state heavyweight championship against a new rising prospect, Scott Frank, noted for using a heavy left hook. Wepner lost the match in a 12-round decision, but again proved durable. He announced his retirement afterwards.

== Later life ==
After his retirement from boxing, Wepner began abusing drugs. In 1979, Sylvester Stallone wanted to cast Wepner as a sparring partner in &quot;Rocky II&quot;, but he failed the audition due to his drug problems.

In November 1985, Wepner was arrested on drug charges when he was found with four ounces of cocaine in an undercover police investigation. Under a plea-bargain agreement, he was sentenced in 1988 to ten years in prison. He served 17 months in Northern State Prison, Newark, New Jersey, then spent another 20 months in New Jersey&#x27;s intensive supervision program.

In 2003, Wepner sued Sylvester Stallone, seeking payment for his use as the inspiration for &quot;Rocky&quot; and the film series. The lawsuit was settled with Stallone in 2006 for an undisclosed amount.

As of 2010, Wepner had been working for 10 years with his third wife Linda in the liquor sales field for Majestic Wines and Spirits in Carlstadt, New Jersey, and was an expert in consumer liquors, wines and spirits.

A film about Wepner&#x27;s career was released in 2012, and ESPN aired a documentary titled &quot;The Real Rocky&quot; on October 25, 2011. The ESPN film features a clip of Wepner&#x27;s ninth round knockdown of Muhammad Ali in their 1975 world heavyweight title bout.

=== Ring appearances ===
Wepner occasionally makes ringside appearances at boxing cards in his home state of New Jersey, signing autographs and posing for photos with boxing fans. On October 12, 2012, Wepner appeared ringside with former World Light Heavyweight champion Mike Rossman in Atlantic City, New Jersey, at a Tropicana Casino &amp; Resort Atlantic City fight card featuring a WBA NABA Lightweight title bout in the main event. Wepner held the WBA NABA heavyweight title during his boxing career.

== Portrayals and inspirations ==
* Sylvester Stallone&#x27;s character Rocky Balboa and portions of the &quot;Rocky&quot; film series were inspired by the life of Chuck Wepner. For instance, it was speculated that a scene from the 1982 film &quot;Rocky III&quot; had been influenced by Wepner&#x27;s fight against Andre the Giant, as the movie features a match versus wrestler Hulk Hogan as &quot;Thunderlips&quot;, who throws Rocky out of the ring.
* Liev Schreiber played the role of Wepner in a sports film, &quot;Chuck&quot;.
* Zach McGowan played the role of Wepner in another sports film, &quot;The Brawler&quot;.
*In 2022, a statue of Wepner was unveiled in Collins Park in Bayonne. The project had been several years in the works.

<doc id="162480" wikidata="Q1822" url="?curid=162480" title="Baguio">
<text>Baguio ( , , ), officially the City of Baguio (; ; ), is a highly urbanized city in the Cordillera Administrative Region, Philippines. It is known as the &quot;Summer Capital of the Philippines&quot;, owing to its cool climate since the city is located approximately above mean sea level, often cited as in the Luzon tropical pine forests ecoregion, which also makes it conducive for the growth of mossy plants, orchids and pine trees, to which it attributes its other moniker as the &quot;City of Pines&quot;.

Baguio was established as a hill station by the United States in 1900 at the site of an Ibaloi village known as &quot;Kafagway&quot;. It was the United States&#x27; only hill station in Asia.

Baguio is classified as a highly urbanized city (HUC). It is the largest city in Benguet, serving as the provincial capital from 1901 to 1916, but has since been administered independently from the province following its conversion into a chartered city. Baguio is geographically located within the province of Benguet by the Philippine Statistics Authority for its geographical and statistical purposes only. The city is the center of business, commerce, and education in northern Luzon, as well as the most populous and seat of government of the Cordillera Administrative Region. According to the 2020 census, Baguio has a population of 366,358.

== Etymology ==
Baguio was called Kafagway by indigenous peoples. The name Baguio originated in the American period and is derived from the Ibaloi word bagiw (moss), which was then Hispanicized as Baguio. A demonym for natives of the city, Ibagiw, is also derived from it. It is also the name for the city&#x27;s annual arts festival.

==History==
===Ibaloi town of Kafagway===
Baguio used to be a vast mountain zone with lush highland forests, teeming with various wildlife such as the indigenous deer, cloud rats, Philippine eagles, Philippine warty pigs, and numerous species of flora. The area was a hunting ground of the indigenous peoples, notably the Ibalois and other Igorot ethnic groups. When the Spanish arrived in the Philippines, the area was never fully subjugated by Spain due to the intensive defense tactics of the indigenous Igorots of the Cordilleras.

Igorot oral history states the Benguet upper class, &quot;baknang&quot;, was founded between 1565 and the early 1600s, by the marriage of a gold trader, Amkidit, and a Kankanaey maiden gold panning in Acupan. Their son, Baruy, discovered a gold deposit in the area, which he developed with hired workers and slaves.

In 1755, the Augustinian Fray Pedro de Vivar established a mission in Tonglo (Tongdo) outside Baguio. Before he was driven out the following year, this included 220 people, including several &quot;baknang&quot; families. The Spanish tried to regain the mission in 1759, but were ambushed. This prompted the Governor General Pedro Manuel de Arandía Santisteban to send Don Manuel Arza de Urrutia on a punitive expedition, which resulted in the mission being burned to the ground.

===Spanish rule===
During Spanish rule in 1846, the Spaniards established a command post or a &quot;&quot; in the nearby town of La Trinidad, and organized Benguet into 31 , one of which was Kafagway, a wide grassy area where the present Burnham Park is situated. Kafagway was then a minor consisting of only about 20 houses; most of the lands in Kafagway were owned by a prominent Ibaloi, Mateo Cariño, who served as its chieftain. The Spanish , which was located at Bag-iw at the vicinity of Guisad Valley was later moved to Cariño&#x27;s house where the current city hall stands. &quot;Bag-iw&quot; was the Ibaloi toponym of the town, an Ibaloi term for &quot;moss&quot; which was historically abundant in the area. This name was spelled by the Spaniards as &quot;Baguio&quot;.

===First Philippine Republic===

During the Philippine Revolution in July 1899, Filipino revolutionary forces under Pedro Paterno liberated La Trinidad from the Spaniards and took over the government, proclaiming Benguet as a province of the new Philippine Republic. Baguio was converted into a &quot;town&quot;, with Mateo Cariño being the (mayor).

===American rule===
When the United States occupied the Philippines after the Spanish–American War, Baguio was selected to become the summer capital of the then Philippine Islands. American zoologist Dean Conant Worcester headed an expedition in 1900 after convincing U.S. Secretary of State Elihu Root to order an expedition to a cool place in the northern mountains of the Philippines. Governor-General William Taft, on his first visit in 1901, noted the &quot;air as bracing as Adirondacks or Murray Bay...&quot; On November 11, 1901, the American colonial government expropriated lands in Baguio owned by the Ibaloi people, who were forced to sell their lands.

In 1903, Filipinos, Japanese and Chinese workers were hired to build Kennon Road, the first road directly connecting Baguio with the lowlands of La Union and Pangasinan. Before this, the only road to Benguet was Naguilian Road, and it was largely a horse trail at higher elevations. Camp John Hay was established in October 1903, after President Theodore Roosevelt signed an executive order setting aside land in Benguet for a military reservation for the United States Army to rest and recuperate from the lowland heat. It was named after Roosevelt&#x27;s Secretary of State, John Milton Hay.

The Mansion, built in 1908, served as the official residence of the American Governor-General during the summer to escape Manila&#x27;s heat. The Mansion was designed by architect William E. Parsons based on preliminary plans by architect Daniel Burnham.

Burnham, one of the earliest successful modern city planners, designed the mountain retreat following the tenets of the City Beautiful movement. In 1904, the rest of the city was planned out by Burnham. On September 1, 1909, Baguio was declared as a chartered city and nicknamed the &quot;Summer Capital of the Philippines&quot;.

The succeeding period saw further developments of and in Baguio with the construction of Wright Park in honor of Governor-General Luke Edward Wright, Burnham Park in honor of Burnham, Governor Pack Road, and Session Road.

===World War II===

Prior to World War II, Baguio was the summer capital of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, and the home of the Philippine Military Academy. As such, it was very important in military and political terms. Philippine President Manuel Quezon was even in Baguio when the war began.

On December 8, 1941, 17 Japanese bombers attacked Camp John Hay,as part of the first Japanese air raid on Luzon. Baguio was declared an open city in December 27.

Following the Japanese invasion of the Philippines in 1941, the Imperial Japanese Army used Camp John Hay, an American installation in Baguio, as a military base. The nearby Philippine Constabulary base, Camp Holmes, was used as an internment camp for about 500 civilian enemy aliens, mostly Americans, between April 1942 and December 1944.

President José P. Laurel of the Second Philippine Republic, a puppet state established in 1943, departed the city on March 22 and reached Taiwan eight days later, on March 30. The remainder of the Second Republic government, along with Japanese civilians, were ordered to evacuate Baguio on March 30. General Tomoyuki Yamashita and his staff then relocated to Bambang, Nueva Vizcaya.

By late March 1945, Baguio was within range of the American and Filipino military artillery. Between March 4 and 10, United States Fifth Air Force planes dropped 933 tons of bombs and 1,185 gallons of napalm on Baguio, reducing much of the city to rubble. A major offensive to capture Baguio did not occur until April 1945, when the USAFIP-NL&#x27;s 1st Battalion of the 66th Infantry, attached with the United States Army&#x27;s 37th Infantry Division, the USAFIP-NL&#x27;s 2nd Battalion of 66th Infantry, attached with the US 33rd Infantry Division, and the USAFIP-NL&#x27;s 3rd Battalion of the 66th Infantry, converged on Baguio. By April 27, 1945, the city was liberated and the joint force proceeded to liberate the La Trinidad valley.

In September 1945, the Japanese forces in the Philippines, headed by General Yamashita and Vice Admiral Okochi, formally surrendered at Camp John Hay&#x27;s American Residence in the presence of lieutenant generals Arthur Percival and Jonathan Wainwright.

=== Post-World War II recovery ===
With the end of World War II, Baguio recovered quickly, earning a significant reputation as a tourism venue and earning significantly from tourism even though it ceased to be the official &quot;Summer Capital of the Philippines&quot; in 1976.

=== During the Marcos dictatorship ===
The beginning months of the 1970s marked a period of turmoil and change in the Philippines, as well as in Baguio. During his bid to be the first Philippine president to be re-elected for a second term, Ferdinand Marcos launched an unprecedented number of public works projects. This caused the Philippine economy took a sudden downwards turn known as the 1969 Philippine balance of payments crisis, which in turn led to a period of economic difficulty and social unrest. With only a year left in his last constitutionally allowed term as president Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines under Martial Law in September 1972 and thus retained the position for fourteen more years. This period in Philippine history is remembered for the Marcos administration&#x27;s record of human rights abuses, particularly targeting political opponents, student activists, journalists, religious workers, farmers, and others who fought against the Marcos dictatorship. 

During this time, Baguio City jail was partially adapted to become a detention center for &quot;political detainees&quot; who were jailed because the administration saw them as threats, and who were often held without being formally charged, which is why they were classified as &quot;detainees&quot;, not &quot;prisoners.&quot; Among the prominent prisoners held at the Baguio City jail were 1967 Miss Philippines–World Maita Gomez who had spoken against the government, and Bulletin Today journalist Isidoro Chammag who had angered Marcos&#x27; soldiers by covering the 1983 Beew Massacre in Tubo, Abra. Camp Henry T. Allen, the original site of the Philippine Military Academy near the Baguio City Hall, was also designated as a detention center during this time. Many of these politidal detainees could not afford represenation, so the Baguio Chapter of the Free Legal Assistance Group, headed by Human Rights Lawyer Arthur Galace, was kept busy defending them throughout the Martial law era.

=== During the 1986 People Power Revolution ===

In the wake of the Snap Presidential elections of 1986, antidictatorship organizers were based largely in the Azotea Building midway up Session Road, and in Cafe Amapola further up Session, on its intersection with Governor Pack Road. Because the United States&#x27; Armed Forces Radio and Television Network station at Camp John Hay was transmitting news from Manila, they learned early on that the People Power Revolution had begun in Manila. Deciding that their locations were too unsafe, they encamped in the courtyard of the Baguio Cathedral, which was located on higher ground. They were later joined by Lt. Benjamin Magalong, of the Philippine Constabulary detachment in Buguias, Benguet, who had defected from the government, gone to the nearby Central Police Station in Baguio, and disarmed its personnel to prevent any untoward incidents while Baguio residents continued to gather at the cathedral to protest the abuses of the Marcos administration. The Baguio Cathedral, and Session Road adjacent to it, thus became the center of the People Power revolution in Baguio - paralleling similar protests in Cebu, Davao, Bacolod, Manila, and other major Philippine cities, eventually leading to the ouster of President Ferdinand Marcos on February 25, 1986.

=== Creation of the Cordillera Administrative Region ===
On July 15, 1987, President Corazon Aquino issued &quot;Executive Order 220&quot; which created the Cordillera Administrative Region, and made the highly urbanized city of Baguio its seat of government. Various attempts at legally turning the Cordillera Administrative Region into an autonomous region have been pursued, but failed to gather enough public support in two separate autonomy plebiscites.

=== 1990 Luzon Earthquake and aftermath ===
The 1990 Luzon earthquake ( = 7.7) destroyed some parts of Baguio and the surrounding province of Benguet on the afternoon of July 16, 1990. A significant number of buildings and infrastructure were damaged, including the Hyatt Terraces Plaza, Nevada Hotel, Baguio Park Hotel, FRB Hotel and Baguio Hilltop Hotel; major highways were temporarily blocked due to landslides and pavement breakup; and a number of houses were leveled or severely shaken with numerous casualties. Some of the fallen buildings were built on or near fault lines; local architects later admitted structural building codes should have been followed more religiously, particularly regarding concrete and rebar standards, and &quot;soft stories.&quot; Baguio has been rebuilt with aid from the national government and international donors such as Japan, Singapore and the United States.

==Geography==
Baguio is a highland city nestled within the Cordillera Central mountain range in northern Luzon. While the downtown core ranges from 1400 to 1500 meters above sea level, elevations within Baguio&#x27;s administrative boundaries extend from about 900 meters (along the Bued River) to almost (around the Busol watershed). Mountain peaks on the outskirts of Baguio reach over above sea level, the highest being Mount Santo Tomas in Tuba.

Enclosed by the province of Benguet, the city covers a small area of . Most of the developed part of the city is built on uneven, hilly terrain of the northern section. When Daniel Burnham drew plans for the city, he made the City Hall a reference point where the city limits extend from east to west and from north to south.

===Barangays===
Baguio is composed of 129 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.

====Proposed merger of barangays====
A proposed merging of the city&#x27;s 129 barangays had not been implemented since its inception in 2000. Several local officials stressed that many of the city&#x27;s barangays did not comply with the minimum requirements in the Local Government Code of the Philippines that a highly urbanized city must have a certified population of least 5,000 inhabitants. According to Mayor Mauricio Domogan, in the past, benefits granted to local governments were based on the number of existing barangays; this led former local officials to create as many barangays as possible in the city in order to acquire additional benefits from the national government. The proposed merger, which will reduce the barangays from 130 to about 40 to 50 by merging adjacent ones, is believed to solve several issues concerning barangay boundary disputes, seemingly biased allocation of funds for larger barangays in relation to barangays with lesser area and population, as well as the inadequate honorarium of barangay officials.

===Climate===
As a city with varying terrain, Baguio features a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification: Am) and a subtropical highland climate (Köppen climate classification: Cwb), depending on the local elevation. Owing to its generally high elevation, the city is known for its mild climate and unusually low temperature: usually about cooler than the lowland temperatures near sea level. Average temperature ranges from , with the lowest temperatures occurring between November and February. The lowest recorded temperature was on January 18, 1961; in contrast, the all-time high of was recorded on March 15, 1988, during the 1988 El Niño season. The temperature seldom exceeds even during the warmest part of the year.

====Precipitation====
Like many other cities with a subtropical highland climate, Baguio receives noticeably less precipitation during its dry season. However, the city has an extraordinary amount of precipitation during the rainy season from June to October. The city averages over of rainfall annually, the highest in the country.

== Environment ==
=== Pollution ===
Baguio suffers from air pollution and is one of the cities with the dirtiest air in the Philippines, according to a 2014 WHO report; a slight improvement in the city&#x27;s air quality was cited in 2017 by the DENR&#x27;s Environmental Management Bureau. In a 2018 WHO report, the city was listed as having the most polluted air among 8 other local cities (Cebu, Dagupan, Davao, Manila, San Carlos, Urdaneta and Zamboanga). Eco-vehicles and Euro 4 compliant vehicles have been tested whether or not they are suited for the city&#x27;s steep slopes in line with efforts to modernize its Public Utility Vehicles (PUVs). PUVs, specifically jeepneys, have been pushed for its modernization, in line with President Duterte&#x27;s PUV modernization initiative.

Another problem that plagues Baguio is its garbage and waste disposal. The city has been dumping its garbage in a landfill in Urdaneta City, but rising costs are putting a strain on the city&#x27;s budget. In early 2018, the city government started using its garbage transfer station in the city outskirts near Marcos Highway, drawing protests from residents of the nearby town of Tuba, who cited the facility poses health hazards to their communities. As of 2019, the Philippine National Oil Company has offered to test a waste-to-energy technology as a possible solution to its garbage woes. Baguio&#x27;s waste water treatment plant is also eyed for an expansion as it has been unable to fully cater to the city&#x27;s needs; wastewater which the plant could not accommodate were dumped in the Balili River, leading to its high coliform levels—even higher than that of Manila Bay&#x27;s.

== Landscape ==
Baguio is also a planned city. American Architect and Urban Planner Daniel Burnham was commissioned to design the new capital; his design for the city was based on the City Beautiful movement, which features broad streets and avenues radiating out from rectangles.

During the Second World War, Baguio was razed to the ground during the Japanese forces&#x27; invasion and the subsequent shelling by American forces during the liberation. After the liberation, rebuilding began and most of the historical buildings were thoroughly reconstructed. However, some of the historic buildings from the 19th century that had been preserved in reasonably reconstructible form were nonetheless eradicated or otherwise left to deteriorate. The 1990 Luzon earthquake further devastated Baguio&#x27;s old buildings, which include 28 collapsed buildings such as hotels, factories, government and university buildings, and many private homes and establishments.

Baguio&#x27;s current landscape is mostly of contemporary architecture.

=== Architecture ===
Baguio&#x27;s contemporary architecture is largely of American build, since Americans were the ones to establish a station here. A few examples include those built at Teacher&#x27;s Camp and Camp John Hay, previous American installations in the city as well as the current Baguio City Hall. Some buildings are also influenced by Spanish building concepts, such as &quot;Porta Vaga Mall&quot; and &quot;La Azotea&quot;. One of the more modern buildings in the city is SM City Baguio, established in 2003.

Moves by various groups with the goal to preserve these buildings have been made. As a historic building, the Baguio City Hall has faced opposition to renovation of its grounds, since that may be against laws on national cultural heritage sites; the renovations, however, continued as there has been no documentation supporting the City Hall as a national heritage site. The construction of the City Hall park was finished in May 2019 as was said to define the city&#x27;s new moniker as a creative center for crafts and folk arts.

==Demographics==
The original inhabitants of Baguio are the Ibaloi people (natively pronounced as &quot;Ivadoi&quot;). When the Americans established the city in the early 1900s, early settlers in the city included members of other Igorot tribes (&quot;Igudut&quot; in Ibaloi), the lowlander Ilocanos (&quot;Iduko&quot;), Americans (&quot;Merikano&quot;), and &quot;mestizos&quot;. A significant number of Chinese (both Cantonese and Hokkien) and Japanese laborers were also hired to build Kennon Road, many of whom later settled in the city.

Baguio is an overpopulated city, having a population density of more than 6,000 people per square kilometer. Originally planned by Daniel Burnham to accommodate 25,000 to 30,000 people, the city&#x27;s population has swelled to 366,358 persons as of May 2020. The city has a very young age structure as 65.5 percent of its total population is below thirty years old. Females comprise 51.3 percent of the population as against 48.7 percent for males. The household population comprises 98 percent of the total population, or 245,000 persons. With an average of 4.6 members per household, a total of 53,261 households are gleaned. During the peak of the annual tourist influx, particularly during the Lenten period, transients triple the population.

=== Crime ===
Crime in Baguio is concentrated in theft and vehicular accidents. Crime in the city is also directly related to its changing demographics and unique criminal justice system. The illegal drug trade is also a problem of the city as 24 of its 129 barangays are considered as drug affected as of December 2017.

In 2018, Baguio was listed as one of the safest cities both in the ASEAN region, ranking sixth with a crime index of 40.57 and safety index of 59.43. The Baguio City Police Office also has the highest crime solution efficiency nationwide of 84%, compared to the national 77% and the region&#x27;s 70%. In May 2019 BCPO also reported a drop of 27% in crimes, from 1,150 in 2018 to 834 in 2019. The BCPO was awarded as the country&#x27;s best city police station in 2018.

===Religion===
Baguio is a predominantly Christian city, as of 2015; Roman Catholics at , Evangelicals (Philippine Council of Evangelical Churches) at , National Council of Churches in the Philippines at , and Iglesia ni Cristo at .

As of 2015, Muslims comprise of the city&#x27;s total population. The largest mosque in the area is &quot;Masjid Al-Maarif&quot;, which is a centre of Islamic studies in the Philippines. The city also has smaller numbers of Buddhists and atheists, along with members of other faiths.

==Economy==

As a melting pot of different peoples and cultures in the Cordillera Administrative Region, numerous investments and business opportunities are lured to Baguio. Baguio has a large retail industry, with shoppers coming to the city to take advantage of the diversity of competitively priced commercial products on sale. The city is also popular with bargain hunters; some of the most popular bargaining areas include Baguio Market and Maharlika Livelihood Center. The city is home to numerous shopping centers and malls catering to increasing commercial and tourist activity; these include: SM City Baguio, Baguio Center Mall, Abanao Square, and Tiong San.

Various food and retail businesses run by local residents proliferate, forming a key part of Baguio&#x27;s cultural landscape. Several retail outlets and dining outlets are situated along Bonifacio Street, Session Road, Teacher&#x27;s Camp, Mines View Park and Baguio Fastfood Center near the market.

The areas of Session Road, Harrison Road, Magsaysay Avenue and Abanao Street, comprise the city&#x27;s trade center, where commercial and business structures such as cinemas, hotels, restaurants, department stores, and shopping centers are concentrated. The City Market offers a wide array of locally sourced goods and products, usually from Benguet province, which includes colorful woven fabrics and hand-strung beads to primitive wood carvings, cut flowers, strawberries and &quot;Baguio&quot; vegetables. The term &#x27;Baguio vegetables&#x27; often denotes vegetable types that thrive in the cooler growing climate. Strawberries and string beans—referred to as &quot;Baguio beans&quot; across the Philippines—are shipped to major urban markets across the archipelago.

Another key source of income for Baguio is its position as the economic hub of the Cordillera Administrative Region. The economy of the city has benefited from the vibrant mining industry in several towns of Benguet. Many agricultural goods produced in Benguet pass through Baguio for processing, sale or further distribution to the lowlands.

===Industrial===
Baguio is one of the Philippines&#x27; most profitable and best investment areas.

A Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA)-accredited business and industrial park called the Baguio City Economic Zone (BCEZ) is located in the southern part of the city between Camp John Hay Country Club and Philippine Military Academy in Barangay Loakan. Firms located in the BCEZ mostly produce and export knitted clothing, transistors, small components for vehicles, electronics and computer parts. Notable firms include Texas Instruments Philippines, which is the second largest exporter in the country. Other companies headquartered within the economic zone include Baguio Ayalaland Technohub, Moog Philippines, Inc., Linde Philippines, Inc., LTX Philippines Corporation, and Sitel Philippines, Baguio.

===Outsourcing===
Outsourcing contributes to the city&#x27;s economy and employment. Sitel, whose main office is located in the Baguio City Economic Zone, is the largest BPO company in the city with four sites established within the BCEZ. There are also multiple BPOs present in the city with numerous PEZA-accredited private economic zones established to cater to this industry. The Ayala Technohub located in Camp John Hay hosts Cocentrix and InterContinental Hotels Group alongside other commercial establishments. Teleperformance Baguio and Thoughtfocus is established at the SM Cyberzone Building (also known as SM Fiesta Strip) located in front of Sunshine Park, while other call centers downtown are Optimum Transsource, Sterling Global and Global Translogic. Tech-Synergy operates a large transcription and back office operation near Wright park.

In recent years, there has been a surge of ESL (English as a Second Language) Tutorial Schools throughout Baguio that caters to students from other countries and also provide online services. This industry however has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic with foreign students returning to their home countries.

==Culture==

=== Arts and museums ===

The city became a haven for many Filipino artists in the 1970s–1990s. Drawn by the cool climate and low cost of living, artists such as Ben Cabrera (now a National Artist) and filmmaker Butch Perez relocated to the city. At the same time, locals such as mixed-media artist Santiago Bose and filmmaker Kidlat Tahimik were also establishing work in the city. Even today, artists like painters and sculptors from all over the country are drawn to the Baguio Arts Festival which is held annually. The city houses several museums, such as the Baguio Museum, Museo Kordilyera, Emilio F. Aguinaldo Museum, the Laperal White House and the SLU Museum of Arts and Cultures.

Baguio has been included in UNESCO&#x27;s Creative Cities Network due to craft and folk art traditions of the city particularly ranging on expressions to wood carving, silver craft, traditional weaving and tattooing. Baguio is the first city in the Philippines to be part of the inter-city network which aims to promote the creative industries as well as integrate culture in sustainable urban development.

=== Languages ===
The languages commonly spoken in Baguio are Ilocano, Tagalog, and English. Languages like Ibaloi, Kankanaey, Pangasinan, Cantonese, Hokkien, Japanese, Kapampangan, Cebuano, Hiligaynon, Maranao, Maguindanaon and Tausug are also spoken to varying degrees by their respective ethnic communities within the city.

=== Media ===
In 1939, when the country&#x27;s literacy was below 50%, the city already had a weekly paper. Manila Bulletin&#x27;s predecessor, The Manila Daily Bulletin, published a weekly supplement, &quot;Baguio Bulletin&quot;.

Local and regional newspapers circulating in Baguio include the &quot;Baguio Midland Courier&quot;, &quot;Baguio Herald Express&quot;, &quot;Zigzag Weekly&quot;, and &quot;Baguio Chronicle&quot;.

&quot;Baguio Midland Courier&quot; was the largest newspaper publication around Baguio and Cordillera Administrative Region. It started out as a four-page tabloid on April 28, 1947, by Sinai Hamada and siblings Oseo and Cecilia. Sinai was its first and longest-lasting editor-in-chief while his older brother Oseo managed its business operations. Circa 1963, it distributed 7,500 copies. It launched its website in its 60th anniversary. The Baguio Midland Courier announced its closure effective July 22, 2024 and it issued its final edition on July 21, 2024. Baguio Midland Courier&#x27;s publisher, Hamada Printers &amp; Publishers Corp., however stated that despite cessation of print operations, its website and social media pages can still be accessed.

=== Festivals and holidays ===
The annual flower festival, called the Panagbenga Festival, is held every February; it was created to highlight the city&#x27;s flowers and cool temperature and as a way to rise up from the devastation of the 1990 Luzon earthquake. The festival includes floats covered mostly with flowers; it also includes street dancing, presented by dancers clad in flower-inspired costumes inspired by the &quot;Bendian&quot;, an Ibaloi dance of celebration. The indigenous people were initially wary with government-led tourism due to a perceived threat that the government would interfere with or change their communities&#x27; rituals.

The annual Gong Festival is celebrated on the 29th of October. Baguio Gong Day coincides with the National Indigenous Peoples’ Thanksgiving Day. The festivity includes the Gaddang people&#x27;s courtship dances palakis and the takik and the symbolic beating of the seven gongs to attain peace, unity and cultural heritage preservation.

Baguio celebrates its city charter anniversary every September 1, which has been declared as a special non-working holiday in 1989 through Republic Act 6710.

== Tourism ==

Tourism is one of Baguio&#x27;s main industries due to its cool climate and history. The city is one of the country&#x27;s top tourist destinations. During the year end holidays some people from the lowlands prefer spending their vacation in Baguio, to experience cold temperatures they rarely have in their home provinces. Also, during summer, especially during Holy Week, tourists from all over the country flock to the city. During this time, the total number of people in the city doubles. To accommodate visitors, there are more than 80 hotels and inns available, as well as numerous transient houses set up by the locals. Local festivities such as the Panagbenga Festival also attracts both local and foreign tourists.

Baguio is the lone Philippine destination in the 2011 TripAdvisor Traveller&#x27;s Choice Destinations Awards (Asia category) with the city being among the top 25 destinations in Asia. Burnham Park, Mines View Park, Wright Park, The Mansion, and Botanical Garden are among the popular tourist sites in Baguio.

==Government==
===Local government===

As a highly urbanized city with its own charter, it is not subject to the jurisdiction of Benguet province, of which it was formerly a part.

The City of Baguio is led by its own mayor and vice mayor. The vice mayor leads the city council, composed of 12 elected councilors and 3 &quot;ex-officio&quot; members (the ABC President, SK President, and IPMR of the city). The City Government holds office at the Baguio City Hall.

The 129 barangays are led by their own captains assisted by a 7-man barangay council.

These officials are term-limited by up to 3 consecutive terms, with each term lasting for 3 years.

===Elected officials===
The city government&#x27;s composition as of June 30, 2022:

===Congress representation===
Baguio is represented in the House of Representatives by its own congressman, Marquez O. Go. The city is a lone district, separate from the province of Benguet.

=== Summer residences ===
The city hosts the summer residences of the President, Vice President, Senate President and House Speaker at Barangay Lualhati, while the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals and the Cabinet Secretaries cottages are housed at Cabinet Hill. The Supreme Court and Court of Appeals hold summer sessions in the city, usually during the month of April.

==Sports==
Baguio has hosted several sporting events, even those of international standing. The Baguio Athletic Bowl within the grounds of Burnham Park is one of Baguio&#x27;s primary sporting venues. Baguio hosted the 1978 World Chess Championship match between Anatoly Karpov and Viktor Korchnoi, building the Baguio Convention Center for that purpose. The city is a participant in the CARAA games or the Cordillera Administrative Region Athletic Association, hosting it last in 2016 and 2017. The winners of the said event will eventually represent the region in the annual Palarong Pambansa games, which is also sponsored by the Department of Education. As of 2019, the city is still the overall champion with 205 gold, 110 silver and 79 bronze medals.

In recent years, Baguio has been racking up titles and medals in the field of Mixed Martial Arts led by Team Lakay.

==Infrastructure==
=== Transportation ===

====Air====
Loakan Airport is the lone airport serving the general area of Baguio. The airport is classified as a trunkline airport, or a major commercial domestic airport, by the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines. Major commercial operations to Baguio however ceased after Philippine Airlines closed their Baguio route in 1998. There were attempts to reopen Baguio routes throughout the following two decades by different airline operators such as Asian Spirit and Sky Pasada but none were able to sustain continuous operation. Commercial flights resumed in 2022 with Philippine Airlines (operated by PAL Express) operating Baguio–Cebu flights and vice versa but operations was halted by Philippine Airlines in July 2024 because of poor passenger traffic.

The airport is located south of the city center. Due to the limited length of the runway, being only long, it is restricted to commuter size aircraft. The airport is used primarily by helicopters, turbo-prop and piston engine aircraft, although on rare occasions light business jets (LBJ) have flown into the airport.

====Land====
Jeepneys and taxis are the main means of public transportation in the city. The government&#x27;s push for jeepney modernization has led to an increase of modern EURO 4 compliant PUVs plying Baguio&#x27;s center. The rollout however for full jeepney modernization had been hampered by the COVID-19 pandemic. There are several bus lines linking Baguio with Manila, Bontoc, Mariveles, Olongapo, Cabanatuan, and provinces such as Pangasinan, Pampanga, Bataan, Nueva Ecija, Aurora, Cavite, La Union, Nueva Vizcaya and those in the Ilocos regions. Notable bus companies that operate the Baguio to Manila routes are Victory Liner, Genesis Transport and its premium bus line JoyBus, and Solid North.

From Metro Manila, Baguio is accessible via NLEX (from Bulacan to Pampanga), SCTEX (Pampanga to Tarlac) and TPLEX (from Tarlac to La Union). The three main access roads leading to Baguio from the lowlands are Kennon Road (formerly known as the &quot;Benguet Road&quot;), Aspiras–Palispis Highway (previously known as &quot;Marcos Highway&quot;) and Naguilian Road, also known as &quot;Quirino Highway&quot;. The newest road that connects the city to the lowlands is Asin Road (also known as &quot;Asin-San Pascual-Tubao, La Union Road&quot;). All these roads traverse the municipality of Tuba, Benguet.

* Kennon Road starts in Rosario, La Union and winds upwards through a narrow, steep valley. This is often the fastest route to Baguio but it is particularly perilous, with landslides during the rainy season and sharp dropoffs, some without guardrails. The recently passed Republic Act No. 11604 pushes for the full rehabilitation of Kennon Road as an all-weather highway.
* Aspiras-Palispis Highway starts in Agoo, La Union and connects to Palispis Highway, at the boundary of Benguet and La Union provinces.
* Asin-Tubao Road starts in Tubao, La Union and serves as secondary alternative road if gridlock occurs at Aspiras-Palispis Highway
* Naguilian Road, which starts in Bauang, La Union, are both longer routes but are much safer than Kennon Road especially during rainy season, and are the preferred routes for coaches, buses and trucks.

The Benguet-Nueva Vizcaya Road, which links Baguio to Aritao in Nueva Vizcaya province, traverses the towns of Itogon, Bokod, and Kayapa.

Another road, Halsema Highway, (also known as the &quot;Baguio-Bontoc Road&quot; or the &quot;Mountain Trail&quot;) leads north through the mountainous portion of the provinces of Benguet and Mountain Province; it starts at the northern border of Baguio with La Trinidad.

Since 2021, Baguio has developed its own bicycle lane network consisting of shared lanes (Class 3) and segregated lanes with paint and physical separators (Class 2) on existing roads. As of 2024, the city has implemented of Class 3 lanes, of Class 2 lanes with paint separation, and Class 2 lanes with physical separation.

=====HoHo Bus=====
In an effort to address traffic congestion and the lack of car parking at tourist spots in the city, Baguio operates a free bus shuttle service called the Hop On, Hop Off (HoHo) Tourist Bus. Through a park and ride scheme, the service encourages tourists with private vehicles to park their vehicles at the Baguio Convention Center (BCC) for a fee and ride the bus to various tourists sites free of charge. Relaunched on July 15, 2022, the HoHo bus has scheduled departure and arrival times, operating a looped route between the BCC, the Baguio Botanical Garden, the Mansion House, Mines View Park, Wright Park, and Governor Pack Road. The bus service has an estimated waiting interval of 30 minutes and is operational from 8:30 AM to 6:20 PM daily.

All times are in Philippine Standard Time (UTC+08:00).

==== Possible future modes ====

* Cable Cars - As of July 8, 2019, Secretary Tugade of the Department of Transportation said that the feasibility study for the installation of the cable cars in Manila may be finished within the year, with Baguio soon to follow. The Philippine government earlier secured a P27 million grant from France for this venture, with Manila and Baguio seen as possible initial sites.
* Monorail - A monorail project from Baguio to La Trinidad is being mulled over by the SSS as a possible investment in CAR. It is seen to further boost tourism and decongest traffic. The project is similar to the one installed by the Department of Science and Technology at the UP Campus in 2012.

=== Water and electricity ===
Most of the water supply of the city is provided for by the Baguio Water District, founded in 1975 as the successor to the now-defunct Department of Public Services. It currently operates 60 deep wells to cater to its more than 300,000 consumers. It currently serves 122 out of the 129 barangays in the city and some parts of Tuba, Benguet. In recent years, the BWD has expressed concern over the city&#x27;s depleting water supply, due in part to the private wells dug by private individuals and companies.

Electric services are provided by Benguet Electric Cooperative (BENECO), the sole electric power distributor in Benguet. In 2012, a bill was filled in the House of Representatives seeking the creation of the Baguio Electric Cooperative or BAELCO, an entity to provide for the city&#x27;s own electricity needs, separate from BENECO. Its creation has been met with opposition by various groups citing the need of a feasibility study on the separation. The creation of a separate electric franchise for Baguio would also infringe on BENECO&#x27;s existing franchise that mandated BENECO to provide electricity for both Baguio and Benguet which would create legal implications if it was to be amended.

The city is also the only local government unit to own and operate its own renewable energy plant. Originally constructed in the 1920s, the Asin Mini Hydropower Plants 1, 2 and 3 located in Tuba, Benguet came under the city&#x27;s possession after the lapse of the 25-year lease agreement with the Aboitiz-owned Hydroelectric Development Corporation (HEDCOR). The plant acted as both a power source and another income-generating asset of the city as BENECO was also its main client. The power plant however was forced to cease operation in 2015 when the Energy Regulatory Commission issued a cease and desist order to the city due to the lack of a certificate of compliance from the city. The city currently has plans to rehabilitate the power plants so that they could resume operations once again.

== Healthcare ==

Baguio&#x27;s healthcare is mainly provided by various private corporations. Private hospitals operating in the city are the Baguio Medical Center, BCU-Santo Niño de Jesus Medical Center Foundation, Notre Dame de Chartres Hospital, Pines City Doctors&#x27; Hospital and Saint Louis University&#x27;s Hospital of Sacred Heart. The BCU-Santo Niño de Jesus Medical Center Foundation ceased operations in 2009 due to financial reasons but was reopened during the COVID-19 pandemic with the local government refurbishing it as an isolation center for COVID-19 patients. In early 2019, several groups were eyeing to establish a hospital in Barangay Scout Barrio, but was met with opposition; as of March 2019, the project has been shelved.

The Baguio City Health Services Office is the office responsible for the health care programs provided by the city government, operating 16 health centers and 15 satellite clinics. Baguio hosts the Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center or BGHMC, a tertiary state-owned hospital administered and operated by the Department of Health. It is the sole government hospital in the city and the largest government tertiary hospital in the Cordillera Administrative Region.

==Education==
Education is a major contributor to the economy of Baguio. Considered as the &quot;Educational Center of the North&quot;, the city has a transient student population who migrate to the city to attend tertiary education.

Baguio is the center of education in the Northern Philippines due to high performances in various professional licensure exams as well as adherence to high educational quality standards, housing some of the prestigious and largest universities in Northern Luzon.

=== Elementary and secondary ===
The city has 45 public elementary schools and 21 public secondary schools. Most of its secondary private schools are divisions of the private universities of the city. The Philippine Science High School - CAR campus was established in the city in 2009 and is located in Irisan. In 2016, the city government established in Irisan the Baguio City Science High School to create a unified science high school campus.

Baguio Central School, the country&#x27;s first public primary school was opened on September 2, 1899. It was once a one-room school built upon Mateo Cariño&#x27;s 2 hectare lot and Ibaloy house he donated to the local government. Its roof was made of reed and cogongrass with hewn wood walls and floor. Its first students were only 25 Igorot boys, including Dr. Jose Cariño and Maximo Carantes, under a United States Armed Forces teacher, Mr. Patrick. The pupils used slate and chalks to write. In 1901, female students were enrolled. World War II heavily damaged the school which was renovated by the Department of Education in 2004. The Heritage conservation Society declared it as a heritage school. On May 24, 2024, the City Planning, Development, and Sustainability Office stopped the P41.2-million reconstruction project on BCS’ right wing portions of the Gabaldon School Buildings. Under the Cultural Mapping Book, BCS is a “significant tangible and immovable cultural heritage property, and the biggest elementary school in the city, with about 70 classrooms, 3,300 pupils and 83 teaching staff” which ought to be restored to its 1949 state.

=== Universities ===

The city houses eight major institutions of higher education. Baguio&#x27;s first private school, Easter College, was set up in 1906 by the Rt. Rev. Charles Brent, who was a bishop of the Episcopalian Church.

The University of the Philippines, the country&#x27;s premier state university, was established as an extension campus in Vigan, Ilocos Sur before transferring to Baguio in 1938. In 1961, it became a branch campus of UP Diliman, before finally becoming UP Baguio in 2002.

Saint Louis University is the largest university in the city and in the north of Manila, catering to over 30,000 students; it was founded by Belgian CICM missionaries in 1911 initially as a one-storey school for boys. It became a college in the 1950s before becoming a university in 1963. It currently has four campuses spread across the city.

Baguio Central University was founded in 1945 as the Centro Academy by the Fernandez family. The following year, another educational institution, the University of the Cordilleras was established as the Baguio Colleges before becoming the Baguio Colleges Foundation; it became a full-fledged university in 2003. The University of Baguio was established as the Baguio Technical and Commercial Institute in 1948 by the Bautista family; it was upgraded to university status in 1969.

Mainly a nursing and medical school, Pines City Colleges was founded in 1969 as the Pines City Doctors Hospital School of Nursing, three years after the opening of Pines City Doctors&#x27; Hospital in 1966.

The Philippine Military Academy, the country&#x27;s military school, was originally founded in the Walled City of Intramuros in 1907 before relocating to Baguio in 1908.

<doc id="162483" wikidata="Q486680" url="?curid=162483" title="Transvestism">
<text>Transvestism is the practice of dressing in a manner traditionally or stereotypically associated with a different gender.

The terms &quot;transvestism&quot; and &quot;transvestite&quot; were coined by Magnus Hirschfeld in 1910. In the early 20th century, &quot;transvestite&quot; referred to cross-dressers, and also a variety of people who would now be considered transgender.

The term &quot;transvestite&quot; is now considered outdated and derogatory, and has been replaced with the more neutral word &quot;cross-dresser&quot;.

==History==

Though the term was coined as late as the 1910s by Magnus Hirschfeld, the phenomenon is not new. It was referred to in the Hebrew Bible. Being part of the homosexual movement of Weimar Germany in the beginning, a first transvestite movement of its own started to form since the mid-1920s, resulting in founding first organizations and the first transvestite magazine, &quot;Das 3. Geschlecht&quot;. The rise of National Socialism stopped this movement from 1933 onwards.

===Etymology===
Magnus Hirschfeld coined the word &quot;transvestite&quot; (from Latin &quot;trans-&quot;, &quot;across, over&quot; and &quot;vestitus&quot;, &quot;dressed&quot;) in his 1910 book &quot;Die Transvestiten&quot; (&quot;Transvestites&quot;) to refer to the sexual interest in cross-dressing. He used it to describe persons who habitually and voluntarily wore clothes of the opposite sex. Hirschfeld&#x27;s group of transvestites consisted of both males and females, with heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, and asexual orientations.

Hirschfeld himself was not happy with the term: He believed that clothing was only an outward symbol chosen on the basis of various internal psychological situations. In fact, Hirschfeld helped people to achieve changes of their first name (legal given names were required to be gender-specific in Germany) and performed the first reported sexual reassignment surgery. Hirschfeld&#x27;s transvestites therefore were, in today&#x27;s terms, not only transvestites, but a variety of people from the transgender spectrum.

Hirschfeld also noticed that sexual arousal was often associated with transvestism. In more recent terminology, this is sometimes called transvestic fetishism. Hirschfeld also clearly distinguished between transvestism as an expression of a person&#x27;s &quot;contra-sexual&quot; (transgender) feelings and fetishistic behavior, even if the latter involved wearing clothes of the other sex.

The use of the term meaning cross-dresser was already common in French in the early 19th century, from where it was imported into Portuguese, with the same meaning.

===&quot;Transvestite&quot;===
Today, the term &quot;transvestite&quot; is commonly considered outdated and derogatory, with the term &quot;cross-dresser&quot; used as a more appropriate replacement.

The term &quot;transvestite&quot; was historically used to diagnose medical disorders, including mental health disorders, and transvestism was viewed as a disorder, while the term &quot;cross-dresser&quot; was coined by the trans community.

In some cases, the term &quot;transvestite&quot; is seen as more appropriate for use by members of the trans community instead of by those outside the trans community, and some have reclaimed the word.

==Transvestism as a “disorder”==
When cross-dressing occurs for erotic purposes over a period of at least six months and also causes significant distress or impairment, the behavior is considered a mental disorder in the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot;, and the psychiatric diagnosis &quot;transvestic fetishism&quot; is applied.

The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) listed &quot;dual-role transvestism&quot; (non-sexual cross-dressing) and &quot;fetishistic transvestism&quot; (cross-dressing for sexual pleasure) as disorders in ICD-10 (1994). Both items were removed for ICD-11 (2022).

<doc id="162489" wikidata="Q2596183" url="?curid=162489" title="Tincture of cannabis">
<text>Tincture of cannabis, sometimes known as green dragon, is an alcoholic cannabis concentrate. The solubility of THC in ethanol is greater than 1 g/mL.

According to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) cannabis tinctures (&quot;tincturea&quot;) are a type of liquid cannabis extract obtained using ethanol, water, glycerol, propylene glycol and fatty oils as extraction solvents, depending on the type of tincture (and also on the solvent used) it can have a specific mass/volume ratio or a specific therapeutic agents content.

Cannabis tinctures are used in the production of specific extracts, like nabiximols.

== History ==

Cannabis tincture appeared in the &quot;United States Pharmacopoeia&quot; until 1942 (Australia 1977, UK 1970s). In the 20th century cannabis lost its appeal as a medicinal product, largely due to the development of apparently suitable alternatives, such as the hypodermic needle, water-soluble analgesics and synthetic hypnotics. A major concern of the regulatory authorities at that time was the widespread recreational use of cannabis.

The pharmacological target for cannabis, the endocannabinoid system, has been researched since its discovery in the 1980s.

== Preparation ==
The tincture is typically made by soaking the dried flowers of the female hemp plant (marijuana) in ethanol. The tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and other cannabinoids dissolve into the alcohol. Some preparations also extract some of the water-based plant products such as chlorophyll, resulting in a dark green or brown liquid. Baking or drying the cannabis to decarboxylate prior to the alcohol bath increases the amount of THC in the resulting preparation.

== Methods of use ==
The tincture is ordinarily consumed orally, but may also be applied to the skin.

<doc id="162498" wikidata="Q105807" url="?curid=162498" title="Nuclear meltdown">
<text>A nuclear meltdown (core meltdown, core melt accident, meltdown or partial core melt) is a severe nuclear reactor accident that results in core damage from overheating. The term &quot;nuclear meltdown&quot; is not officially defined by the International Atomic Energy Agency or by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission. It has been defined to mean the accidental melting of the core of a nuclear reactor, however, and is in common usage a reference to the core&#x27;s either complete or partial collapse.

A core meltdown accident occurs when the heat generated by a nuclear reactor exceeds the heat removed by the cooling systems to the point where at least one nuclear fuel element exceeds its melting point. This differs from a fuel element failure, which is not caused by high temperatures. A meltdown may be caused by a loss of coolant, loss of coolant pressure, or low coolant flow rate or be the result of a criticality excursion in which the reactor is operated at a power level that exceeds its design limits.

Once the fuel elements of a reactor begin to melt, the fuel cladding has been breached, and the nuclear fuel (such as uranium, plutonium, or thorium) and fission products (such as caesium-137, krypton-85, or iodine-131) within the fuel elements can leach out into the coolant. Subsequent failures can permit these radioisotopes to breach further layers of containment. Superheated steam and hot metal inside the core can lead to fuel–coolant interactions, hydrogen explosions, or steam hammer, any of which could destroy parts of the containment. A meltdown is considered very serious because of the potential for radioactive materials to breach all containment and escape (or be released) into the environment, resulting in radioactive contamination and fallout, and potentially leading to radiation poisoning of people and animals nearby.

== Causes ==
Nuclear power plants generate electricity by heating fluid via a nuclear reaction to run a generator. If the heat from that reaction is not removed adequately, the fuel assemblies in a reactor core can melt. A core damage incident can occur even after a reactor is shut down because the fuel continues to produce decay heat.

A core damage accident is caused by the loss of sufficient cooling for the nuclear fuel within the reactor core. The reason may be one of several factors, including a loss-of-pressure-control accident, a loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA), an uncontrolled power excursion. Failures in control systems may cause a series of events resulting in loss of cooling. Contemporary safety principles of defense in depth ensure that multiple layers of safety systems are always present to make such accidents unlikely.

The containment building is the last of several safeguards that prevent the release of radioactivity to the environment. Many commercial reactors are contained within a thick pre-stressed, steel-reinforced, air-tight concrete structure that can withstand hurricane-force winds and severe earthquakes.
* In a loss-of-coolant accident, either the physical loss of coolant (which is typically deionized water, an inert gas, NaK, or liquid sodium) or the loss of a method to ensure a sufficient flow rate of the coolant occurs. A loss-of-coolant accident and a loss-of-pressure-control accident are closely related in some reactors. In a pressurized water reactor, a LOCA can also cause a &quot;steam bubble&quot; to form in the core due to excessive heating of stalled coolant or by the subsequent loss-of-pressure-control accident caused by a rapid loss of coolant. In a loss-of-forced-circulation accident, a gas cooled reactor&#x27;s circulators (generally motor or steam driven turbines) fail to circulate the gas coolant within the core, and heat transfer is impeded by this loss of forced circulation, though natural circulation through convection will keep the fuel cool as long as the reactor is not depressurized.
* In a loss-of-pressure-control accident, the pressure of the confined coolant falls below specification without the means to restore it. In some cases, this may reduce the heat transfer efficiency (when using an inert gas as a coolant), and in others may form an insulating &quot;bubble&quot; of steam surrounding the fuel assemblies (for pressurized water reactors). In the latter case, due to localized heating of the &quot;steam bubble&quot; due to decay heat, the pressure required to collapse the &quot;steam bubble&quot; may exceed reactor design specifications until the reactor has had time to cool down. (This event is less likely to occur in boiling water reactors, where the core may be deliberately depressurized so that the emergency core cooling system may be turned on). In a depressurization fault, a gas-cooled reactor loses gas pressure within the core, reducing heat transfer efficiency and posing a challenge to the cooling of fuel; as long as at least one gas circulator is available, however, the fuel will be kept cool.

==Light-water reactors (LWRs)==

Before the core of a light-water nuclear reactor can be damaged, two precursor events must have already occurred:
* A limiting fault (or a set of compounded emergency conditions) that leads to the failure of heat removal within the core (the loss of cooling). Low water level uncovers the core, allowing it to heat up.
* Failure of the emergency core cooling system (ECCS). The ECCS is designed to rapidly cool the core and make it safe in the event of the maximum fault (the design basis accident) that nuclear regulators and plant engineers could imagine. There are at least two copies of the ECCS built for every reactor. Each division (copy) of the ECCS is capable, by itself, of responding to the design basis accident. The latest reactors have as many as four divisions of the ECCS. This is the principle of redundancy, or duplication. As long as at least one ECCS division functions, no core damage can occur. Each of the several divisions of the ECCS has several internal &quot;trains&quot; of components. Thus the ECCS divisions themselves have internal redundancy – and can withstand failures of components within them.

The Three Mile Island accident was a compounded group of emergencies that led to core damage. What led to this was an erroneous decision by operators to shut down the ECCS during an emergency condition due to gauge readings that were either incorrect or misinterpreted; this caused another emergency condition that, several hours after the fact, led to core exposure and a core damage incident. If the ECCS had been allowed to function, it would have prevented both exposure and core damage. During the Fukushima incident the emergency cooling system had also been manually shut down several minutes after it started.

If such a limiting fault occurs, and a complete failure of all ECCS divisions also occurs, both Kuan, &quot;et al&quot; and Haskin, &quot;et al&quot; describe six stages between the start of the limiting fault (the loss of cooling) and the potential escape of molten corium into the containment (a so-called &quot;full meltdown&quot;):

# Uncovering of the core – In the event of a transient, upset, emergency, or limiting fault, LWRs are designed to automatically SCRAM (a SCRAM being the immediate and full insertion of all control rods) and spin up the ECCS. This greatly reduces reactor thermal power (but does not remove it completely); this delays core becoming uncovered, which is defined as the point when the fuel rods are no longer covered by coolant and can begin to heat up. As Kuan states: &quot;In a small-break LOCA with no emergency core coolant injection, core uncovery [sic] generally begins approximately an hour after the initiation of the break. If the reactor coolant pumps are not running, the upper part of the core will be exposed to a steam environment and heatup of the core will begin. However, if the coolant pumps are running, the core will be cooled by a two-phase mixture of steam and water, and heatup of the fuel rods will be delayed until almost all of the water in the two-phase mixture is vaporized. The TMI-2 accident showed that operation of reactor coolant pumps may be sustained for up to approximately two hours to deliver a two phase mixture that can prevent core heatup.&quot;
# Pre-damage heat up – &quot;In the absence of a two-phase mixture going through the core or of water addition to the core to compensate water boiloff, the fuel rods in a steam environment will heat up at a rate between 0.3 °C/s (0.5 °F/s) and 1 °C/s (1.8 °F/s) (3).&quot;
# Fuel ballooning and bursting – &quot;In less than half an hour, the peak core temperature would reach . At this temperature, the zircaloy cladding of the fuel rods may balloon and burst. This is the first stage of core damage. Cladding ballooning may block a substantial portion of the flow area of the core and restrict the flow of coolant. However, complete blockage of the core is unlikely because not all fuel rods balloon at the same axial location. In this case, sufficient water addition can cool the core and stop core damage progression.&quot;
# Rapid oxidation – &quot;The next stage of core damage, beginning at approximately , is the rapid oxidation of the Zircaloy by steam. In the oxidation process, hydrogen is produced and a large amount of heat is released. Above , the power from oxidation exceeds that from decay heat (4,5) unless the oxidation rate is limited by the supply of either zircaloy or steam.&quot;
# Debris bed formation – &quot;When the temperature in the core reaches about , molten control materials (1,6) will flow to and solidify in the space between the lower parts of the fuel rods where the temperature is comparatively low. Above , the core temperature may escalate in a few minutes to the melting point of zircaloy [] due to increased oxidation rate. When the oxidized cladding breaks, the molten zircaloy, along with dissolved UO2 (1,7) would flow downward and freeze in the cooler, lower region of the core. Together with solidified control materials from earlier down-flows, the relocated zircaloy and UO2 would form the lower crust of a developing cohesive debris bed.&quot;
# Corium relocation to the lower plenum – &quot;In scenarios of small-break LOCAs, there is generally a pool of water in the lower plenum of the vessel at the time of core relocation. The release of molten core materials into the water always generates large amounts of steam. If the molten stream of core materials breaks up rapidly in water, there is also a possibility of a steam explosion. During relocation, any unoxidized zirconium in the molten material may also be oxidized by steam, and in the process hydrogen is produced. Recriticality also may be a concern if the control materials are left behind in the core and the relocated material breaks up in unborated water in the lower plenum.&quot;
At the point at which the corium relocates to the lower plenum, Haskin, &quot;et al&quot; relate that the possibility exists for an incident called a &quot;fuel–coolant interaction (FCI)&quot; to substantially stress or breach the primary pressure boundary when the corium relocates to the lower plenum of the reactor pressure vessel (&quot;RPV&quot;).
This is because the lower plenum of the RPV may have a substantial quantity of water - the reactor coolant - in it, and, assuming the primary system has not been depressurized, the water will likely be in the liquid phase, and consequently dense, and at a vastly lower temperature than the corium. Since corium is a liquid metal-ceramic eutectic at temperatures of , its fall into liquid water at may cause an extremely rapid evolution of steam that could cause a sudden extreme overpressure and consequent gross structural failure of the primary system or RPV. Though most modern studies hold that it is physically infeasible, or at least extraordinarily unlikely, Haskin, &quot;et al&quot; state that there exists a remote possibility of an extremely violent FCI leading to something referred to as an &quot;alpha-mode failure&quot;, or the gross failure of the RPV itself, and subsequent ejection of the upper plenum of the RPV as a missile against the inside of the containment, which would likely lead to the failure of the containment and release of the fission products of the core to the outside environment without any substantial decay having taken place.

The American Nuclear Society has commented on the TMI-2 accident, that despite melting of about one-third of the fuel, the reactor vessel maintained its integrity and contained the damaged fuel.

===Breach of the primary pressure boundary===

There are several possibilities as to how the primary pressure boundary could be breached by corium.
* Steam explosion
As previously described, FCI could lead to an overpressure event leading to RPV fail, and thus, primary pressure boundary fail. Haskin &quot;et al&quot; report that in the event of a steam explosion, failure of the lower plenum is far more likely than ejection of the upper plenum in the alpha mode. In the event of lower plenum failure, debris at varied temperatures can be expected to be projected into the cavity below the core. The containment may be subject to overpressure, though this is not likely to fail the containment. The alpha-mode failure will lead to the consequences previously discussed.
* Pressurized melt ejection (PME)
It is quite possible, especially in pressurized water reactors, that the primary loop will remain pressurized following corium relocation to the lower plenum. As such, pressure stresses on the RPV will be present in addition to the weight stress that the molten corium places on the lower plenum of the RPV; when the metal of the RPV weakens sufficiently due to the heat of the molten corium, it is likely that the liquid corium will be discharged under pressure out of the bottom of the RPV in a pressurized stream, together with entrained gases. This mode of corium ejection may lead to direct containment heating (DCH).

===Severe accident ex-vessel interactions and challenges to containment===
Haskin &quot;et al&quot; identify six modes by which the containment could be credibly challenged; some of these modes are not applicable to core melt accidents.

# Overpressure
# Dynamic pressure (shockwaves)
# Internal missiles
# External missiles (not applicable to core melt accidents)
# Meltthrough
# Bypass

===Standard failure modes===

If the melted core penetrates the pressure vessel, there are theories and speculations as to what may then occur.

In modern Russian plants, there is a &quot;core catching device&quot; in the bottom of the containment building. The melted core is supposed to hit a thick layer of a &quot;sacrificial metal&quot; that would melt, dilute the core and increase the heat conductivity, and finally the diluted core can be cooled down by water circulating in the floor. There has never been any full-scale testing of this device, however.

In Western plants there is an airtight containment building. Though radiation would be at a high level within the containment, doses outside of it would be lower. Containment buildings are designed for the orderly release of pressure without releasing radionuclides, through a pressure release valve and filters. Hydrogen/oxygen recombiners also are installed within the containment to prevent gas explosions.

In a melting event, one spot or area on the RPV will become hotter than other areas, and will eventually melt. When it melts, corium will pour into the cavity under the reactor. Though the cavity is designed to remain dry, several NUREG-class documents advise operators to flood the cavity in the event of a fuel melt incident. This water will become steam and pressurize the containment. Automatic water sprays will pump large quantities of water into the steamy environment to keep the pressure down. Catalytic recombiners will rapidly convert the hydrogen and oxygen back into water. One debated positive effect of the corium falling into water is that it is cooled and returns to a solid state.

Extensive water spray systems within the containment along with the ECCS, when it is reactivated, will allow operators to spray water within the containment to cool the core on the floor and reduce it to a low temperature.

These procedures are intended to prevent release of radioactivity. In the Three Mile Island event in 1979, a theoretical person standing at the plant property line during the entire event would have received a dose of approximately 2 millisieverts (200 millirem), between a chest X-ray&#x27;s and a CT scan&#x27;s worth of radiation. This was due to outgassing by an uncontrolled system that, today, would have been backfitted with activated carbon and HEPA filters to prevent radionuclide release.

In the Fukushima incident, however, this design failed. Despite the efforts of the operators at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant to maintain control, the reactor cores in units 1–3 overheated, the nuclear fuel melted and the three containment vessels were breached. Hydrogen was released from the reactor pressure vessels, leading to explosions inside the reactor buildings in units 1, 3 and 4 that damaged structures and equipment and injured personnel. Radionuclides were released from the plant to the atmosphere and were deposited on land and on the ocean. There were also direct releases into the sea.

As the natural decay heat of the corium eventually reduces to an equilibrium with convection and conduction to the containment walls, it becomes cool enough for water spray systems to be shut down and the reactor to be put into safe storage. The containment can be sealed with release of extremely limited offsite radioactivity and release of pressure. After perhaps a decade for fission products to decay, the containment can be reopened for decontamination and demolition.

Another scenario sees a buildup of potentially explosive hydrogen, but passive autocatalytic recombiners inside the containment are designed to prevent this. In Fukushima, the containments were filled with inert nitrogen, which prevented hydrogen from burning; the hydrogen leaked from the containment to the reactor building, however, where it mixed with air and exploded. During the 1979 Three Mile Island accident, a hydrogen bubble formed in the pressure vessel dome. There were initial concerns that the hydrogen might ignite and damage the pressure vessel or even the containment building; but it was soon realized that lack of oxygen prevented burning or explosion.

===Speculative failure modes===

One scenario consists of the reactor pressure vessel failing all at once, with the entire mass of corium dropping into a pool of water (for example, coolant or moderator) and causing extremely rapid generation of steam. The pressure rise within the containment could threaten integrity if rupture disks could not relieve the stress. Exposed flammable substances could burn, but there are few, if any, flammable substances within the containment.

Another theory, called an &quot;alpha mode&quot; failure by the 1975 Rasmussen (WASH-1400) study, asserted steam could produce enough pressure to blow the head off the reactor pressure vessel (RPV). The containment could be threatened if the RPV head collided with it. (The WASH-1400 report was replaced by better-based newer studies, and now the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has disavowed them all and is preparing the overarching State-of-the-Art Reactor Consequence Analyses [SOARCA] study - see the Disclaimer in NUREG-1150.)

By 1970, there were doubts about the ability of the emergency cooling systems of a nuclear reactor to prevent a loss-of-coolant accident and the consequent meltdown of the fuel core; the subject proved popular in the technical and the popular presses. In 1971, in the article &quot;Thoughts on Nuclear Plumbing&quot;, former Manhattan Project nuclear physicist Ralph Lapp used the term &quot;China syndrome&quot; to describe a possible burn through of the containment structures, and the subsequent escape of radioactive material(s) into the atmosphere and environment. The hypothesis derived from a 1967 report by a group of nuclear physicists, headed by W. K. Ergen. Some fear that a molten reactor core could penetrate the reactor pressure vessel and containment structure and burn downwards to the level of the groundwater.

It has not been determined to what extent a molten mass can melt through a structure (although that was tested in the loss-of-fluid-test reactor described in Test Area North&#x27;s fact sheet). The Three Mile Island accident provided real-life experience with a molten core: the corium failed to melt through the reactor pressure vessel after over six hours of exposure due to dilution of the melt by the control rods and other reactor internals, validating the emphasis on defense in depth against core damage incidents.

==Other reactor types==

Other types of reactors have different capabilities and safety profiles than the LWR does. Advanced varieties of several of these reactors have the potential to be inherently safe.

===CANDU reactors===
CANDU reactors, Canadian-invented deuterium-uranium design, are designed with at least one, and generally two, large low-temperature and low-pressure water reservoirs around their fuel/coolant channels. The first is the bulk heavy-water moderator (a separate system from the coolant), and the second is the light-water-filled shield tank (or calandria vault). These backup heat sinks are sufficient to prevent either the fuel meltdown in the first place (using the moderator heat sink), or the breaching of the core vessel should the moderator eventually boil off (using the shield tank heat sink). Other failure modes aside from fuel melt will probably occur in a CANDU rather than a meltdown, such as deformation of the calandria into a non-critical configuration. All CANDU reactors are located within standard Western containments as well.

===Gas-cooled reactors===
One type of Western reactor, known as the advanced gas-cooled reactor (or AGR), built by the United Kingdom, is not very vulnerable to loss-of-cooling accidents or to core damage except in the most extreme of circumstances. By virtue of the relatively inert coolant (carbon dioxide), the large volume and high pressure of the coolant, and the relatively high heat transfer efficiency of the reactor, the time frame for core damage in the event of a limiting fault is measured in days. Restoration of some means of coolant flow will prevent core damage from occurring.

===Lead and lead-bismuth-cooled reactors===

Recently heavy liquid metal, such as lead or lead-bismuth, has been proposed as a reactor coolant. Because of the similar densities of the fuel and the HLM, an inherent passive safety self-removal feedback mechanism due to buoyancy forces is developed, which propels the packed bed away from the wall when certain threshold of temperature is attained and the bed becomes lighter than the surrounding coolant, thus preventing temperatures that can jeopardize the vessel’s structural integrity and also reducing the recriticality potential by limiting the allowable bed depth.

=== Experimental or conceptual designs ===
Some design concepts for nuclear reactors emphasize resistance to meltdown and operating safety.

The PIUS (process inherent ultimate safety) designs, originally engineered by the Swedes in the late 1970s and early 1980s, are LWRs that by virtue of their design are resistant to core damage. No units have ever been built.

Power reactors, including the Deployable Electrical Energy Reactor, a larger-scale mobile version of the TRIGA for power generation in disaster areas and on military missions, and the TRIGA Power System, a small power plant and heat source for small and remote community use, have been put forward by interested engineers, and share the safety characteristics of the TRIGA due to the uranium zirconium hydride fuel used.

The Hydrogen Moderated Self-regulating Nuclear Power Module, a reactor that uses uranium hydride as a moderator and fuel, similar in chemistry and safety to the TRIGA, also possesses these extreme safety and stability characteristics, and has attracted a good deal of interest in recent times.

The liquid fluoride thorium reactor is designed to naturally have its core in a molten state, as a eutectic mix of thorium and fluorine salts. As such, a molten core is reflective of the normal and safe state of operation of this reactor type. In the event the core overheats, a metal plug will melt, and the molten salt core will drain into tanks where it will cool in a non-critical configuration. Since the core is liquid, and already melted, it cannot be damaged.

Advanced liquid metal reactors, such as the U.S. Integral Fast Reactor and the Russian BN-350, BN-600, and BN-800, all have a coolant with very high heat capacity, sodium metal. As such, they can withstand a loss of cooling without SCRAM and a loss of heat sink without SCRAM, qualifying them as inherently safe.

==Soviet Union–designed reactors==

=== RBMKs ===
Soviet-designed RBMK reactors (&quot;Reaktor Bolshoy Moshchnosti Kanalnyy)&quot;, found only in Russia and other post-Soviet states and now shut down everywhere except Russia, do not have containment buildings, are naturally unstable (tending to dangerous power fluctuations), and have emergency cooling systems (ECCS) considered grossly inadequate by Western safety standards.

RBMK emergency core cooling systems only have one division and little redundancy within that division. Though the large core of the RBMK is less energy-dense than the smaller Western LWR core, it is harder to cool. The RBMK is moderated by graphite. In the presence of both steam and oxygen at high temperatures, graphite forms synthesis gas and with the water gas shift reaction, the resultant hydrogen burns explosively. If oxygen contacts hot graphite, it will burn. Control rods used to be tipped with graphite, a material that slows neutrons and thus speeds up the chain reaction. Water is used as a coolant, but not a moderator. If the water boils away, cooling is lost, but moderation continues. This is termed a positive void coefficient of reactivity.

The RBMK tends towards dangerous power fluctuations. Control rods can become stuck if the reactor suddenly heats up and they are moving. Xenon-135, a neutron absorbent fission product, has a tendency to build up in the core and burn off unpredictably in the event of low power operation. This can lead to inaccurate neutronic and thermal power ratings.

The RBMK does not have any containment above the core. The only substantial solid barrier above the fuel is the upper part of the core, called the upper biological shield, which is a piece of concrete interpenetrated with control rods and with access holes for refueling while online. Other parts of the RBMK were shielded better than the core itself. Rapid shutdown (SCRAM) takes 10 to 15 seconds. Western reactors take 1 - 2.5 seconds.

Western aid has been given to provide certain real-time safety monitoring capacities to the operating staff. Whether this extends to automatic initiation of emergency cooling is not known. Training has been provided in safety assessment from Western sources, and Russian reactors have evolved in response to the weaknesses that were in the RBMK. Nonetheless, numerous RBMKs still operate.

Though it might be possible to stop a loss-of-coolant event prior to core damage occurring, any core damage incidents will probably allow massive release of radioactive materials.

Upon entering the EU in 2004, Lithuania was required to phase out its two RBMKs at Ignalina NPP, deemed incompatible with European nuclear safety standards. The country planned to replace them with safer reactors at Visaginas Nuclear Power Plant.

===MKER===
The MKER is a modern Russian-engineered channel type reactor that is a distant descendant of the RBMK, designed to optimize the benefits and fix the serious flaws of the original.

Several unique features of the MKER&#x27;s design make it a credible and interesting option. The reactor remains online during refueling, ensuring outages only occasionally for maintenance, with uptime up to 97-99%. The moderator design allows the use of less-enriched fuels, with a high burnup rate. Neutronics characteristics have been optimized for civilian use, for superior fuel fertilization and recycling; and graphite moderation achieves better neutronics than is possible with light water moderation. The lower power density of the core greatly enhances thermal regulation.

An array of improvements make the MKER&#x27;s safety comparable to Western Generation III reactors: improved quality of parts, advanced computer controls, comprehensive passive emergency core cooling system, and very strong containment structure, along with a negative void coefficient and a fast-acting rapid shutdown system. The passive emergency cooling system uses reliable natural phenomena to cool the core, rather than depending on motor-driven pumps. The containment structure is designed to withstand severe stress and pressure. In the event of a pipe break of a cooling-water channel, the channel can be isolated from the water supply, preventing a general failure.

The greatly enhanced safety and unique benefits of the MKER design enhance its competitiveness in countries considering full fuel-cycle options for nuclear development.

===VVER===
The VVER is a pressurized light-water reactor that is far more stable and safe than the RBMK. This is because it uses light water as a moderator (rather than graphite), has well-understood operating characteristics, and has a negative void coefficient of reactivity. In addition, some have been built with more than marginal containments, some have quality ECCS systems, and some have been upgraded to international standards of control and instrumentation. Present generations of VVERs (starting from the VVER-1000) are built to Western-equivalent levels of instrumentation, control, and containment systems.

Even with these positive developments, however, certain older VVER models raise a high level of concern, especially the VVER-440 V230.

The VVER-440 V230 has no containment building, but only has a structure capable of confining steam surrounding the RPV. This is a volume of thin steel, perhaps in thickness, grossly insufficient by Western standards.
* Has no ECCS. Can survive at most one pipe break (there are many pipes greater than that size within the design).
* Has six steam generator loops, adding unnecessary complexity.
** Apparently steam generator loops can be isolated, however, in the event that a break occurs in one of these loops. The plant can remain operating with one isolated loop—a feature found in few Western reactors.
The interior of the pressure vessel is plain alloy steel, exposed to water. This can lead to rust, if the reactor is exposed to water. One point of distinction in which the VVER surpasses the West is the reactor water cleanup facility—built, no doubt, to deal with the enormous volume of rust within the primary coolant loop—the product of the slow corrosion of the RPV.
This model is viewed as having inadequate process control systems.

Bulgaria had a number of VVER-440 V230 models, but they opted to shut them down upon joining the EU rather than backfit them, and are instead building new VVER-1000 models. Many non-EU states maintain V230 models, including Russia and the CIS. Many of these states, rather than abandon the reactors entirely, have opted to install an ECCS, develop standard procedures, and install proper instrumentation and control systems. Though confinements cannot be transformed into containments, the risk of a limiting fault resulting in core damage can be greatly reduced.

The VVER-440 V213 model was built to the first set of Soviet nuclear safety standards. It possesses a modest containment building, and the ECCS systems, though not completely to Western standards, are reasonably comprehensive. Many VVER-440 V213 models operated by former Soviet bloc countries have been upgraded to fully automated Western-style instrumentation and control systems, improving safety to Western levels for accident prevention—but not for accident containment, which is of a modest level compared to Western plants. These reactors are regarded as &quot;safe enough&quot; by Western standards to continue operation without major modifications, though most owners have performed major modifications to bring them up to generally equivalent levels of nuclear safety.

During the 1970s, Finland built two VVER-440 V213 models to Western standards with a large-volume full containment and world-class instrumentation, control standards and an ECCS with multiple redundant and diversified components. In addition, passive safety features such as 900-tonne ice condensers have been installed, making these two units safety-wise the most advanced VVER-440s in the world.

The VVER-1000 type has a definitely adequate Western-style containment, the ECCS is sufficient by Western standards, and instrumentation and control has been markedly improved to Western 1970s-era levels.

== Effects ==
The effects of a nuclear meltdown depend on the safety features designed into a reactor. A modern reactor is designed both to make a meltdown unlikely, and to contain one should it occur.

In a modern reactor, a nuclear meltdown, whether partial or total, should be contained inside the reactor&#x27;s containment structure. Thus (assuming that no other major disasters occur) while the meltdown will severely damage the reactor itself, possibly contaminating the whole structure with highly radioactive material, a meltdown alone should not lead to significant radioactivity release or danger to the public.

== Reactor design ==
Although pressurized water reactors are more susceptible to nuclear meltdown in the absence of active safety measures, this is not a universal feature of civilian nuclear reactors. Much of the research in civilian nuclear reactors is for designs with passive nuclear safety features that may be less susceptible to meltdown, even if all emergency systems failed. For example, pebble bed reactors are designed so that complete loss of coolant for an indefinite period does not result in the reactor overheating. The General Electric ESBWR and Westinghouse AP1000 have passively activated safety systems. The CANDU reactor has two low-temperature and low-pressure water systems surrounding the fuel (i.e. moderator and shield tank) that act as back-up heat sinks and preclude meltdowns and core-breaching scenarios. Liquid fueled reactors can be stopped by draining the fuel into tankage, which not only prevents further fission but draws decay heat away statically, and by drawing off the fission products (which are the source of post-shutdown heating) incrementally. The ideal is to have reactors that fail-safe through physics rather than through redundant safety systems or human intervention.

Certain fast breeder reactor designs may be more susceptible to meltdown than other reactor types, due to their larger quantity of fissile material and the higher neutron flux inside the reactor core. Other reactor designs, such as Integral Fast Reactor model EBR II, had been explicitly engineered to be meltdown-immune. It was tested in April 1986, just before the Chernobyl failure, to simulate loss of coolant pumping power, by switching off the power to the primary pumps. As designed, it shut itself down, in about 300 seconds, as soon as the temperature rose to a point designed as higher than proper operation would require. This was well below the boiling point of the unpressurised liquid metal coolant, which had entirely sufficient cooling ability to deal with the heat of fission product radioactivity, by simple convection.
The second test, deliberate shut-off of the secondary coolant loop that supplies the generators, caused the primary circuit to undergo the same safe shutdown. This test simulated the case of a water-cooled reactor losing its steam turbine circuit, perhaps by a leak.

* The reactor at EBR-I suffered a partial meltdown during a coolant flow test on 29 November 1955.

* The SNAP8DR reactor at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory experienced damage to approximately a third of its fuel in an accident in 1969.
* The Three Mile Island accident, in 1979, referred to in the press as a &quot;partial core melt&quot;, led to the total dismantlement and the permanent shutdown of reactor 2. Unit 1 continued to operate until 2019.

=== France ===
* Saint-Laurent Nuclear Power Plant (civilian), France, in 1969

== China syndrome ==
The China syndrome (loss-of-coolant accident) is a nuclear reactor operations accident characterized by the severe meltdown of the core components of the reactor, which then burn through the containment vessel and the housing building, then (figuratively) through the crust and body of the Earth until reaching the opposite end, presumed to be in &quot;China&quot;. While the antipodes of China include Argentina with its Atucha Nuclear Power Plant the phrasing is metaphorical; there is no way a core could penetrate the several-kilometer thickness of the Earth&#x27;s crust, and even if it did melt to the center of the Earth, it would not travel back upwards against the pull of gravity. Moreover, any tunnel behind the material would be closed by immense lithostatic pressure.

=== History ===

The system design of the nuclear power plants built in the late 1960s raised the concern that a severe reactor accident could release large quantities of radioactive materials into the atmosphere and environment. By 1970, there were doubts about the ability of the emergency core cooling system to cope with the effects of a loss of coolant accident and the consequent meltdown of the fuel core. In 1971, in the article &quot;Thoughts on Nuclear Plumbing&quot;, former Manhattan Project (1942–1946) nuclear physicist Ralph Lapp used the term &quot;China syndrome&quot; to describe a possible burn-through, after a loss of coolant accident, of the nuclear fuel rods and core components melting the containment structures, and the subsequent escape of radioactive material(s) into the atmosphere and environment; the hypothesis derived from a 1967 report by a group of nuclear physicists, headed by W. K. Ergen. In the event, Lapp’s hypothetical nuclear accident was cinematically adapted as &quot;The China Syndrome&quot; (1979).

The real scare, however, came from a quote in the 1979 film &quot;The China Syndrome&quot;, which stated, &quot;It melts right down through the bottom of the plant—theoretically to China, but of course, as soon as it hits ground water, it blasts into the atmosphere and sends out clouds of radioactivity. The number of people killed would depend on which way the wind was blowing, rendering an area the size of Pennsylvania permanently uninhabitable.&quot; The actual threat of this was coincidentally tested just 12 days after the release of the film when a meltdown at Pennsylvania&#x27;s Three Mile Island Plant 2 (TMI-2) created a molten core that moved toward &quot;China&quot; before the core froze at the bottom of the reactor pressure vessel. Thus, the TMI-2 reactor fuel and fission products breached the fuel rods, but the melted core itself did not break the containment of the reactor vessel.

A similar concern arose during the Chernobyl disaster. After the reactor was destroyed, a liquid corium mass from the melting core began to breach the concrete floor of the reactor vessel, which was situated above the bubbler pool (a large water reservoir for emergency pumps and to contain any steam pipe rupture). There was concern that a steam explosion would have occurred if the hot corium made contact with the water, resulting in more radioactive materials being released into the air. Due to damages from the accident, three station workers manually operated the valves necessary to drain this pool. However, this concern was proven to be unfounded as (unknown to those at the time) the corium already contacted the reservoir before it could be drained, where instead of creating a steam explosion it harmlessly cooled rapidly and created a light-brown ceramic pumice that floated on the water.

<text>The year 2001 in film involved some significant events, including the first installments of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot;, &quot;Spy Kids&quot;, &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; and &quot;Shrek&quot; franchises, and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;Ocean&#x27;s&quot; trilogies. Significant non-English language films released included &quot;Monsoon Wedding&quot;, &quot;Amélie&quot; and &quot;Spirited Away&quot;. There was one film, &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, that passed over $1 billion in a re-release of 2020.

The inaugural entries of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; film franchises prompted a shift in both the film and literary communities by propelling fantasy into mainstream culture, popularising young adult novels, and reforming the blockbuster to promote film franchises and cater to fandom communities.

==Highest-grossing films==

The top 10 films released in 2001 by worldwide gross are as follows:

&quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; grossed $974 million, and became the second highest-grossing film of all time. It was also the highest-grossing film in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film franchise before the finale, &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot;, surpassed it in 2011.

2001 was the first time that two films released in the same year grossed more than $800 million at the box office, with &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; surpassing the milestone.

The highest-grossing non-English film was Studio Ghibli&#x27;s anime &quot;Spirited Away&quot;, which was the 15th highest-grossing film of the year.

==Events==
* May 18 – &quot;Shrek&quot; was released to critical acclaim and went on to win the first Academy Award for Best Animated Feature the following year beating out &quot;Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot; and &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;
* June 22 – &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; is released, launching one of the highest-grossing franchises in film history.
* August 8 – actors Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman divorce.
* November 2 – &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; opens with the best ticket sales ever for an animated film and the 6th-best of all time.
* November 16 and December 19 – The beginning of two acclaimed fantasy film series based on best-selling novels: &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, respectively.

<text>The 1968 Winter Olympics, officially known as the X Olympic Winter Games (), were a winter multi-sport event held from 6 to 18 February 1968 in Grenoble, France. Thirty-seven countries participated.
The 1968 Winter Games marked the first time the IOC permitted East and West Germany to enter separately, and the first time the IOC ordered drug and gender testing of competitors.

Norway won the most gold and overall medals, the first time since the 1952 Winter Olympics that the Soviet Union did not top the medal table by both parameters.

== Host city selection ==
On 24 November 1960, François Raoul, the prefect of the Isère Département, and Raoul Arduin, the president of the Dauphiné Ski Federation, officially presented the idea of hosting the 1968 Winter Olympic Games in Grenoble. After the city council agreed in principle, different government agencies offered their support, and the villages around Grenoble also reacted positively, an application committee was formed and led by Albert Michallon, the former mayor of Grenoble on 30 December 1960. The application was officially given to the IOC during a meeting between IOC executives and representatives of international sport agencies in Lausanne in February 1963.
In the application, the decision was not solely based on sport, because there had only been two important sport events in the Isère Département: the Bobsleigh World Championships of 1951 in L&#x27;Alpe d&#x27;Huez and the Luge World Championships of 1959 in Villard-de-Lans. Between 1946 and 1962, the number of inhabitants in Grenoble increased from 102,000 to 159,000, and the total inhabitants in the Département Isère increased from 139,000 to 250,000. The development of the infrastructure could not keep up with this rapid increase, and was, for the most part, at the same level as before World War II. The people who were responsible never made a secret out of it that it was mainly for them about using the Olympic Games to receive larger grants to quickly develop dated infrastructure and support the local economy.

The 61st IOC session, where the awarding of the Olympic Games would have been voted for, would have taken place in Nairobi, Kenya. This session was moved to Baden-Baden, West Germany, because Kenya refused entry to IOC members from Portugal and apartheid South Africa for political reasons. Due to a lack of time, only the 1968 Summer Olympics host city could be voted for. The vote finally took place in Innsbruck on 28 January 1964, a day before the start of the 1964 Winter Olympics. 51 members who were eligible to vote were in attendance and Grenoble were awarded the games after the third round of voting and were competing against Calgary, who were awarded the Games 20 years later.

== Organisation ==
After Grenoble was voted as the host city, the French National Olympic Sports Committee decided the foundation of the organisation committee. The Comité d&#x27;Organisation des dixièmes Jeux Olympiques (COJO), the committee for the organisation of the 10th Olympic Winter Games, started to plan the games for the first time on 1 August 1964. Albert Michallon, alongside being the former mayor of Grenoble, was also president of COJO. The upper panel was made up of the general assembly with its 340 members and the supervisory board conduct business with 39 members, 19 of which were appointed and the other 20 were voted for. The general secretary consisted of five main departments and 17 subordinate departments. The number of employees grew to 1920 in February 1968.

The French government played a major role in the preparations for the Games, as president Charles de Gaulle saw an opportunity to present Grenoble as a symbol for a modern France. Francois Missoffe, Minister for Youth and Sport, formed an interministerial committee for the coordination of the work commissioned by prime minister Georges Pompidou. Over 7000 soldiers of the French armed forces and also employees of the ministries for Youth and Sport, Finance, Social Building, Education, Post, Culture and Transport were employed. The sum of the investments contributed to CNF$1.1 billion Francs (roughly 775 million pounds). The government contributed 47.08%, the Isere Department 3.65%, the city of Grenoble 20.07% and the surrounding communities 1.37%. Different institutions, such as the national train company SNCF; the television broadcaster ORTF; the government housing association and the regional association of hospitals provided the rest of the money.

These means were used accordingly; 465.181 million Francs for the infrastructure of transport and communications, 250.876 million for the olympic village and press area, 92.517 million for the sports arenas, 57.502 million for television and radio, 45.674 million for culture, 95.116 million for the city&#x27;s infrastructure and 90.429 million for the running of COJO. They built a new airport, two motorway sections of 7.5 miles and 15 miles, a switchboard, a new town hall, a new police station, a fire station, a hospital with 560 beds, a congress and exhibition centre and a culture palace. They upgraded the access road to the outer sport arenas, an orbital road round Grenoble as well as relocating the rail tracks and removing the level crossings and building a completely new main train station.

To test the new sport complex and to improve organisational processes, they organized &quot;International Sports Weeks&quot;. Speed skating competitions and ski races took place from 20 January to 19 February 1967; an ice hockey tournament from 12 to 15 October; and a figure-skating competition from 23 to 25 November.

== Torch relay ==
On 16 December 1967, the Olympic torch was lit in Olympia, Greece. The ceremony would have taken place on 13 December, but was postponed due to the attempted coup d&#x27;état of King Constantine II, who had been forced from his throne eight months before, against the dictatorial military regime of Georgios Papadopoulos. From there,the flame was run to the Old Olympic Stadium in Athens the torch was flown by an Air France Boeing 707 to the Orly International Airport, where the torch was received by Jean Vuarnet, the 1960 Winter Olympics Downhill Olympic gold medalist, on 19 December, who handed it on to the first torchbearer Alain Mimoun, the 1956 Summer Olympics Marathon Olympic gold medalist.

The torch relay in France went over a distance of 7,222 kilometers through 41 districts and 170 towns to the Isère district. 5,000 torchbearers, who transported the torch on foot, by bike, by boat, by skies or by motorbike, took part in the relay. The first part of the relay was made at the old port of Marseille was done by a diver who, while swimming, held the torch just over the surface of the water. The torchbearers were accompanied by around 80,000 athletes and watched by an audience of about two million people. The last stop on the day before the opening ceremony was Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse. From there, the torch was carried to Grenoble.

The 33 torches that were used in the relay were produced by the Société technique d&#x27;équipement, a subsidiary of the Compagnie de Saint-Gobain. They were 70 cm tall, weighed 1750 g, were made of copper and had a propane gas tank. The reserve flames (a cautionary measure in case the torch went out) burned in twenty carbide lamps, the same as the Olympic fire when it was transported from Athens to Paris in a plane.

== Visual identity ==
The logo for the 1968 Winter Olympic Games portrays a floating snow crystal surrounded by three stylised roses on top of the single-coloured (in white) Olympic rings. The roses can be found in the same pattern (two on the top and one below) as Grenoble&#x27;s emblem.

For the first time, there was an Olympic mascot, although it was unofficial. The mascot was named Schuss, a stylised skier wearing a blue skiing costume and a large red ball as a head. The mascot designed by Aline Lafargue was hardly recognised publicly. It had unofficial character, was marked with great restraint and appeared solely on pins and several toys.

Jack Lesage, a videomaker who specialised in mountain and winter sport recordings, filmed two Olympic advertisements of 15–18 minutes in length before the Olympic Games took place and was contracted by the Organisation Committee. &quot;Trois roses, cinq anneaux&quot; (&quot;Three roses, five rings&quot;) emerged in 1966, and showed Grenoble, as well as the surrounding venues, in the early stage of preparation. In 1967, &quot;Vaincre à Grenoble&quot; (&quot;Victory in Grenoble&quot;) emerged, and documented the progress of the workers, complemented with images of the sport competitions. Both films appeared in three different versions with French, English and German commentary. In France, the films were shown in cimemas before particular feature films, abroad for receptions and presentations.

The French post office issued six Olympic-themed postage stamps. On 22 April 1967, a label next appeared worth 0.60 francs with the official logo as its motif. On 27 January 1968, ten days before the opening ceremony, a series of five semi-postal stamps followed. The designs were ski jumpers and skiers (0.30++ 0,10 F), ice hockey players (0.40 + 0,10 F), the olympic torch (0.60 + 0.20 F), a female ice skater (0.75 + 0.25 F) and slalom racers (0.95 + 0.35 F). The proceeds from the supplement stamps were split between the French Red Cross and the Organisation Committee.

== Highlights and controversies ==


* These were the first Winter Olympics on which doping control tests were performed.
* Norway won the most medals, 6 gold, 6 silver, and 2 bronze, the first time a country other than the Soviet Union had done so since the USSR first entered the Winter Games in 1956.
* In the downhill alpine skiing event, the French Jean-Claude Killy navigated the track with a time of 1:59.85 and won the gold medal. 
* Killy also swept the other men&#x27;s alpine events, winning three gold medals overall, but only after one of the greatest controversies in the history of the Winter Olympics. Austrian superstar Karl Schranz claimed that a mysterious man dressed in black crossed his path during the slalom race, causing him to skid to a halt. Given a restart, Schranz beat Killy&#x27;s time. However, a Jury of Appeal disqualified Schranz and gave the medal to Killy.
* In women&#x27;s luge, there were three East German racers Ortrun Enderlein, Anna-Maria Müller, and Angela Knösel in the top 4 after three runs, but they were disqualified when the International Luge Federation (FIL) determined that they had been heating their runners, a banned practice. Italian Erika Lechner, third after three runs, was moved into first place, and won gold after the fourth run was cancelled due to bad weather. West German media alleged race fixing, while the GDR sports officials blamed the West German Luge Association for staging the incident. According to Stasi documents which came to light in 2006, the FIL official who made the decision had allegedly been bribed by the Federal Republic of Germany and Austria to make the allegation. The question of whether the GDR lugers really cheated remains unresolved, with some contemporary media in Germany maintaining that the GDR team were unfairly disqualified.
* Swedish skier Toini Gustafsson was a star in women&#x27;s cross-country events, winning both individual races and earning a silver medal in the relay.
* American figure skater Peggy Fleming built up a huge lead after the compulsory figures and won the first-place votes of all nine judges. Her victory marked the first gold medal won by an American after the 1961 Sabena Flight 548 incident when the entire US figure skating team died, and heralded an American figure skating renaissance.
* Lyudmila Belousova and Oleg Protopopov successfully defended their pairs figure skating title from Innsbruck for the Soviet Union.
* The Italian bobsleigh pilot Eugenio Monti drove both the two-man and four-man events to win gold. All bobsleigh contests had to be scheduled to start before sunrise and end shortly after dawn because the track at L&#x27;Alpe d&#x27;Huez was designed with insufficient cooling capability and could not keep the ice solid in bright daylight.
* In speed skating, the women&#x27;s 3,000-metre event turned out to be particularly fast, with the first 10 finishers beating the previous Olympic record set in 1960 Winter Olympics. However, the gold medallist, the Netherlands&#x27; Johanna Schut, was unable to beat the world record—until the next year on the same oval in Grenoble.
* The 1968 Winter Olympics were the first to use &quot;Bugler&#x27;s Dream&quot; by Leo Arnaud as the theme for Olympic television coverage on ABC. It was also the first Olympics to be broadcast in color.
* Italian cross-country skier Franco Nones became the first athlete not from Norway, Sweden, Finland, or the Soviet Union to win an Olympic medal in cross-country skiing.

There were five other venues surrounding Grenoble used as sporting venues for the Winter Olympic Games in 1968. For the first time in history, the venues were divided into four clusters. Grenoble set a new trend by having venues in different parts of the surrounding areas. Compared to the investments for the infrastructure, the investments for building sports arenas was very small. This investment only contributed nine percent.

Almost half of this investment, 46 million Francs, was used to build the new ice rink &quot;Stade de glace&quot; (now &quot;Palais des Sports&quot;), the venue where the main ice hockey matches, the figure skating competition and the closing ceremony were held. The arena has 12,000 seats and is situated in &quot;Parc Paul Mistral&quot;, Grenoble&#x27;s main public park located in the center of the city. The architects were Robert Demartini and Pierre Junillon. Construction began in mid-November 1965 and finished in October 1967. The roof was made of two cylindrical which crossed over each other, four columns which could support 10,000 tonnes. Today, the arena is used for concerts, fairs and various other sporting events (among others, six-day races since 1971).

Less than 100m away from the &quot;Stade de glace&quot;, and also in Parc Paul Mistral, the 400m track for the speed skating events was installed between February and November 1966. The venue &quot;Patinoire de vitesse&quot;, which does not have a roof and has a practice ice-rink in the middle of it, had a capacity of 2,500. The cooling system was removed after a few years and today the concrete track is used by roller skaters. The existing was the city&#x27;s ice-rink &quot;Patinoire Municipale&quot;, which opened in September 1963, next to the speed skating track, where the 1964 European Figure Skating Championships took place. The arena, which has 2,000 seats and 700 can stand, was the venue for Group B&#x27;s ice hockey matches.

The venue for the alpine skiing was Chamrousse, a town 30 kilometres east of Grenoble. The finish line for five out of the six races was in the region of &quot;Recoin de Chamrousse&quot;, the other was the men&#x27;s downhill event was in Casserousse. In the construction of the new ski slopes, around 300,000m3 of rocks had to be blown up or dug away; particularly large movements of the earth and changes to the terrain were necessary in the upper part of the men&#x27;s downhill section and in the slalom section. In addition, six new chairlifts were installed. In the preparation of the slopes, over 10,000 people were needed, this consisted mainly of soldiers.

In Autrans, 36 kilometres west of Grenoble in Vercors Massif, the cross-country skiing and biathlon events took place there. Provisional stands at the finish line were available for spectators, which were to the north and southwest of the village. Also in Autrans, the ski jumping in the normal hill took place. The ski jumping hill of Le Claret is still in use today. It originally had a hill size of 70m, but later was made bigger and now measures 90m high.

The 90m hill could have been built without any problems in Autrans, but the organisers decided instead to use Saint-Nizier-du-Moucherotte, 17 kilometres away from Grenoble, as well as Vercors-Massif. The relatively small distance to the city and the better accessibility guaranteed a larger audience. The construction period lasted from July 1966 to January 1967. After the games, the Dauphine hill was rarely used and closed down and fell into ruin beginning in 1990. A third Olympic venue in the Vercors-Massif was Villard-de-Lans, 34 kilometres from Grenoble, where the luge competition took place. The track is exactly 1,000m long, has 14 curves and has a drop of 110m. After it temporarily closed down in 1994 it was remodelled. Today, it now has an artificial surface which makes it possible to use all-year-round. It is no longer used for competitions.

The third Olympic venue in Vercors Massif was 34 km away from Grenoble in the commune of Villard-de-Lans, where the luge competition took place. The track for the luge was exactly 1 km long, had 14 corners and had a drop of 110m. After the track was temporarily closed in 1994, it was rebuilt at today&#x27;s location. It has an artificial surface, which makes using the track all year round possible. For competitions it is no longer used.

The furthest distance, which is also the highest, is L&#x27;Alpe d&#x27;Huez, 65 kilometres southeast of Grenoble. The bobsleigh took place at Col de Poutran at a height of around 2,000m. It was 1,500m long, had 13 corners and had a drop of 140m. It was principally a natural course, but three of the corners were exposed to direct sunlight, and was kept artificially frozen by ammonia and liquid nitrogen. In L&#x27;Alpe d&#x27;Huez, a replacement course was made available for the alpine skiing.

== Accommodation ==
The Olympic village was located in the southern part of the city on the border with the suburbs of Échirolles and Eybens. The chosen place was the site of the former Grenoble-Mermoz Airport, a large housing estate with 6,500 rooms was built in two years. After the games some areas was turned a primary school, secondary school, nursery, youth center, shopping center, and a library. The public places are still in use today. The male athletes were housed in a tower block and in eleven apartment blocks. The female athletes lived in a building with 263 individual rooms, which later went on to serve as a home for workers. Other buildings on the estate housed around 12,000 trainers, officials, timekeepers, volunteers, police and drivers. The catering took place in a future school kitchen. Two more secondary Olympic villages were available to the Nordic and Alpine skiers as well as their physios. Holiday homes were also newly built and were located in Autrans and Chamrousse. A year before the Olympics, there was great adversity at the pre-Olympic competitions. The accommodation did not meet the necessary standards, so much so the Austrian team left the village and housed in a local hotel. This led the hosts to have a rethink and make improvements.

==Medal winners==
There were 35 events contested in 6 sports (10 disciplines).

==Participating nations==
In Grenoble, there were 1158 athletes and 37 teams, a new record in terms of the number of participants. This was Morocco&#x27;s first appearance at the Winter Olympics.

=== The case of Germany ===
Similar to the 1952 Summer Olympics with Saarland, who had sent its own team but had not been integrated as a part of West Germany, there were two teams participating from Germany.

For the first time, the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) was present with its own team. It was provisionally accepted into the IOC, as long as it formed a complete German team consisting of athletes from both the West and East. This had to be done under the leadership of the National Olympic Committee for Germany, a board recognised by the IOC. Following on from this, the National Olympic Committee of East Germany tried to achieve complete recognition. This did not work out because of resistance from Karl Ritter von Halt, the president of the National Olympic Committee for Germany, who was close friends with then-IOC president Avery Brundage. After Halt died in 1961, the same year the Berlin Wall was built by East Germany to prevent the defections of its citizens to the West, the close contact with the IOC leadership was lost under his successor Willi Daume. The reality of the split made the qualification almost impossible. On 8 October 1965, the IOC decided to accept East Germany as a full member. Both national olympic committees agreed on using the same flag and anthem. The black-red-gold flag with the white Olympic rings in the middle of it has been used at all Olympic Games since 1960, as well as the replacement anthem &quot;Ode an die Freude&quot; (Ode to Joy) from Beethoven&#x27;s 9th symphony, which was used previously. Both countries presented themselves as completely independent from 1972, using their respective national flags and anthems.

On 21 January 1968, 21-year-old Ralph Pöhland, one of the most famous East German winter olympians, fled to West Germany after the pre-Olympic tournament at Les Bioux, Switzerland. His assistant in helping to flee was Georg Thoma, a West German ski jumper. This incident led to relationships between the two German teams turning sour, which never used to be the case.

===Number of athletes by National Olympic Committees===
==Medal table==

These are the top ten nations that won medals at the 1968 Winter Games.
=== Medals and diplomas ===
For the 1968 Winter Games, 228 gold, silver and bronze medals were manufactured in total, designed by Roger Excoffon and coined by French minting company Monnaie de Paris. For the first time in Olympic history, the medals, given out for the winners in every sport, had their own design. The logo of the games was depicted on the front of the medal, and on the back was a pictogram etched into the surface that depicted the sport that the medal winner competed in. The medals had a diameter of and were thick. The gold and silver medals consisted of silver with a composition of 925/1000, but the gold medals were coated in an additional six grams of gold. The medals hang of ribbons in the Olympic colours, which happened to also be a first, as they had used chains before 1968 . In addition, the athletes received a box made of black leather, lined with either white, blue or red silk.

The commemoration medal was designed by Josette Hébert-Coeffin. The front side of the medal depicted the decorated head of a Greek athlete with snowflakes and ice crystals in the background. The other side depicted the silhouette of Grenoble in front of the mountain range Belladonne. There were three different types of medals. 20 were made of silver, 210 of silver-coated bronze and 15,000 of bronze.

Excoffon also designed the Olympic diplomas, which were given to the six best athletes in each discipline. They were made of cream coloured parchment paper. Around the logo contained the words &quot;Xes Jeux Olympiques d&#x27;Hiver Grenoble 1968&quot;, as well as the Olympic motto &quot;Citius, altius, fortius&quot;. In the middle of the paper, the word &quot;Diplome&quot; was written in gold writing. However, similar diplome were handed out to officials, participants, journalists and volunteers on ordinary white paper and without the gold writing as a souvenir.

The medal ceremonies took place in the evening of the finals event in the Stade de Glace.

== Schedule ==
Compared to the 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, the number of disciplines increased to 35, and the men&#x27;s biathlon relay was also added.

On 4 February, two days before the official opening ceremony, the first ice hockey preliminary matches took place.This games had a function to lead the vacant spots for 4 teams,the three winners are placed into Group A alongside the five teams already assigned to the group. The losing team was placed into Group B.

== Ceremonies ==
=== Opening ceremony ===

For first time, a temporary stadium was built to host the ceremonies, supported by scaffolding and able to hold 60,000 spectators. The Olympic Stadium was situated in the immediate vicinity to the Olympic Village and IBC/MPC. At the back of the stadium, there was a steel scaffold that kept host to the Olympic flame, located in a 4m wide bowl at the top, which also was able to take 550 kg in weight. There were also stairs leading to the top, containing 96 steps.

The ceremony began on Tuesday, 6 February at 3:00 p.m., with French president Charles de Gaulle in attendance. Among the 500 invited guests of honour was IOC president Avery Brundage, the Irani empress Farah Pahlavi, the Danish Princess Margrethe and the Grand Duchess of Luxembourg Josephine Charlotte. After the Marseillaise was sung, the French national anthem, cultural performances followed.

The procession of the athletes into the stadium was traditionally led by the Greek team. The other teams proceeded into the stadium in alphabetical order, starting with West Germany (Allemagne) and then East Germany (Allemagne d&#x27;Est). The last team out was the hosts, the French team. Albert Michallon, president of COJO, said in his speech that all athletes and visitors were welcome. Brundage again recollected Pierre de Coubertin&#x27;s ideals and expressed the hope of these ideals lead to a peaceful and less materialistic world. He invited Charles de Gaulle to open the Games. De Gaulle appeared on the stage and read out the opening set-phrase.

14 Chasseurs Alpins soldiers carried a giant 54m2 Olympic flag into the stadium and hoisted. The organisers had decided against the usual tradition of letting the peace dove fly. Instead, they let out 500 small Olympic flags on paper parachutes and 30,000 perfumed paper roses from three helicopters over the stadium. Following this, figure skater Alain Calmat was the last torch bearer to enter the stadium. He climbed up the steps to the bowl, where his a sound of his heartbeat amplified over the loudspeakers. Once at the top, he lit the Olympic flame.

Shortly afterwards, skier Leo Lacroix read out the Olympic oath. At the end, the Patrouille de France, the aerobatic flight display team, flew over the stadium and marked out the colours of the Olympic rings with their vapour trails in the sky.

=== Closing ceremony ===

The Winter Olympics ended on Sunday, 18 February, with the closing ceremony in the &quot;Ice Stadium&quot;. The first highlight was the figure skaters gala session. It also included ice dancing, an event that was first introduced into the main programme eight years after in 1976. The best ten partners from the last world championship took part in the event and there was no scores. After that, the last award ceremonies then took place.

After the Marseillaise was played, all athletes who were still in Grenoble reassembled onto the ice and the flag bearers formed a semi-circle. Whilst the flags of Greece, France and next host Japan were put up, a torchbearer brought the Olympic flame into the stadium and ignited it into a small cauldron on the center of ice. IOC president Avery Brundage thanked the organisers and declared the games over. When the Olympic flag was lowed and retired from the venue, gun salutes were heard all across the town and finally the flame went out.

== Top athletes and performances ==
11-years-old Romanian figure skater Beatrice Huștiu became the youngest female participant at the 1968 Winter Games. She took part in the singles event and finished in 29th place, which was third from bottom. The youngest male participant was aged 12 years and 110 days. He was also a figure skater called Jan Hoffmann, who represented East Germany. In Grenoble, he finished in 26th place and was also third from bottom. In 1974 and 1980, he became world champion, and in 1980, he won silver in the Olympic Games at Lake Placid.

American speed skater Dianne Holum was the youngest medal winner. She won silver in the 500m event at the age of 16 years and 266 days. Two days later, she added a bronze by competing in the 1000m event. The youngest gold medal winner was also from the United States: 19-year-old figure skater Peggy Fleming.

The oldest medal winner and oldest gold medal winner was 40-year-old Italian Eugenio Monti, who won the gold medal in the four-man bobsleigh team. Five days before, he had also won the two-man bobsleigh team gold medal.

== Doping and gender control ==
The public became more aware of the doping issue during the 1960s. The first death caused by doping at the Olympic Games occurred in 1960 in Rome, when Danish cyclist Knut Enemark Jensen, who took amphetamines, fell off his bike and died. It took four years until the IOC recognised the seriousness of the situation and created a medical commission. In 1967, the IOC followed the example set by other sport associations and proclaimed a ban on doping. For the first time, doping control was carried out at the 1968 Winter Olympics. The IOC tested 86 athletes but all the tests came back negative.

Also in 1967, the IOC decided to carry out gender controls in order to prevent intersex people from competing at women&#x27;s competitions. Multiple athletes from Eastern Europe immediately retired after the IOC had decided this, which led to much speculation. Erik Schinegger, the 1966 female downhill world champion from Austria, was tested a couple of days before the 1968 Winter Games. It turned out Schinegger had been born with internal sex organs doctors had never tested for. After learning of this condition, Schinegger ultimately decided to have gender reassignment surgery and legally changed his first name from Erika to Erik.

== Media coverage ==

The media representatives lived in an apartment complex built between April 1966 and October 1967, a few hundred meters away from the Olympic village in Malherbe, a central part of Grenoble. The complex consisted of seven eight to ten floored towers totaling 637 flats, an underground car park and a school. The school housed an IBM computer center, a copy center, the studios of French radio and TV broadcaster ORTF and broadcasters from other countries, photo laboratories, and other technical amenities. The offices of the newspaper and photo journalists, the technicians, and the general administration were situated on the bottom floors of the towers, the other floors serving as accommodation. The press restaurant was later used as a car park. There were also smaller press centers in the Stade de glace in Grenoble, and at the five other venues in Autrans, Chamrousse, L&#x27;Alpe d&#x27;Huez, Saint-Nizier-du-Moucherotte, and Villard-de-Lans.

The organising committee COJO assigned 1,545 accreditations to the following people: 1,095 went to press, radio and television journalists, 301 to photographers, and 149 to other unnamed groups. On 19 September 1966, COJO signed an exclusive contract with ORTF for the provision of broadcasting on the television to EBU&#x27;s catchment area and to Canada. On 14 February 1967, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) received the exclusive broadcasting rights for the United States and Latin America. On 15 October 1967, NHK received the rights to broadcast in Japan.

For the first time in the history of the Olympic Games, the Games were transmitted in colour. ORTF installed 25 colour and 37 black and white cameras (ABC had an independent broadcasting system). The total broadcasting time lasted 150 hours and 15mins, 91 hours and 25 mins were in colour. The total number of viewers was recorded at 600 million.

Concerning the question of scoring the men&#x27;s freestyle figure skating and the unfortunate circumstances of the men&#x27;s slalom, the Bild am Sonntag published the title &quot;Am Ende kam der große Krach&quot; (&quot;At the end there was a great bust-up&quot;). The &quot;Münchner Merkur&quot; said they would have tolerated Schranz&#x27;s disqualification, but the incidents in the figure skating had led to a bitter aftertaste.

<text>Octavio Paz Lozano (March 31, 1914 – April 19, 1998) was a Mexican poet and diplomat. For his body of work, he was awarded the 1977 Jerusalem Prize, the 1981 Miguel de Cervantes Prize, the 1982 Neustadt International Prize for Literature, and the 1990 Nobel Prize in Literature.

==Early life==
Octavio Paz was born near Mexico City. His family was a prominent liberal political family in Mexico, with Spanish and indigenous Mexican roots. His grandfather, Ireneo Paz, the family&#x27;s patriarch, fought in the War of the Reform against conservatives, and then became a staunch supporter of liberal war hero Porfirio Díaz up until just before the 1910 outbreak of the Mexican Revolution. Ireneo Paz became an intellectual and journalist, starting several newspapers, where he was publisher and printer. Ireneo&#x27;s son, Octavio Paz Solórzano, supported Emiliano Zapata during the Revolution, and published an early biography of him and the Zapatista movement. Octavio was named for him, but spent considerable time with his grandfather Ireneo, since his namesake father was active fighting in the Mexican Revolution; his father died in a violent fashion. The family experienced financial ruin after the Mexican Revolution; they briefly relocated to Los Angeles, before returning to Mexico. Paz had blue eyes and was often mistaken for a foreigner by other children—according to a biography written by his long-time associate, historian Enrique Krauze, when Zapatista revolutionary Antonio Díaz Soto y Gama met young Octavio, he said, &quot;&quot;Caramba&quot;, you didn&#x27;t tell me you had a Visigoth for a son!&quot; Krauze quotes Paz as saying, &quot;I felt myself Mexican but they wouldn&#x27;t let me be one.&quot;

Paz was introduced to literature early in his life through the influence of his grandfather Ireneo&#x27;s library, filled with classic Mexican and European literature. During the 1920s, he discovered Gerardo Diego, Juan Ramón Jiménez, and Antonio Machado; these Spanish writers had a great influence on his early writings.

As a teenager in 1931, Paz published his first poems, including &quot;Cabellera&quot;. Two years later, at the age of nineteen, he published &quot;Luna Silvestre&quot; (&quot;Wild Moon&quot;), a collection of poems. In 1932, with some friends, he founded his first literary review, &quot;Barandal&quot;.

For a few years, Paz studied law and literature at National University of Mexico. During this time, he became familiar with leftist poets, such as Chilean Pablo Neruda. In 1936, Paz abandoned his law studies, and left Mexico City for Yucatán to work at a school in Mérida. The school was set up for the sons of peasants and workers. There, he began working on the first of his long, ambitious poems, &quot;Entre la piedra y la flor&quot; (&quot;Between the Stone and the Flower,&quot; 1941, revised 1976); influenced by the work of T. S. Eliot, it explores the situation of the Mexican peasant under the domineering landlords of the day.

In July 1937 he attended the Second International Writers&#x27; Congress—the purpose of which was to discuss the attitude of intellectuals to the war in Spain—held in Valencia, Barcelona and Madrid and attended by many writers, including André Malraux, Ernest Hemingway, Stephen Spender, and Pablo Neruda. Paz showed his solidarity with the Republican side, and against the fascists led by Francisco Franco and supported by Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. While in Europe he also visited Paris, where he encountered the surrealist movement, which left a profound impact upon him. After his return to Mexico, in 1938 Paz co-funded a literary journal, &quot;&quot; (&quot;Workshop&quot;) and wrote for that magazine until 1941. In 1937 he married Elena Garro, considered to be one of Mexico&#x27;s finest writers; they had met in 1935. They had one daughter, Helena, and were divorced in 1959.

In 1943, Paz received a Guggenheim Fellowship and used it to study at the University of California at Berkeley in the United States. Two years later, he entered the Mexican diplomatic service, and was assigned for a time to New York City. In 1945, he was sent to Paris, where he wrote &quot;El Laberinto de la Soledad&quot; (&quot;The Labyrinth of Solitude&quot;, English translation 1963); &quot;The New York Times&quot; later described it as &quot;an analysis of modern Mexico and the Mexican personality in which he described his fellow countrymen as instinctive nihilists who hide behind masks of solitude and ceremoniousness.&quot; In 1952, he travelled to India for the first time, and that same year went to Tōkyō as &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot;. He next was assigned to Geneva, Switzerland. He returned to Mexico City in 1954, where he wrote his great poem &quot;Piedra de sol&quot; (&quot;Sunstone&quot;) in 1957, and published &quot;Libertad bajo palabra&quot; (&quot;Liberty under Oath&quot;), a compilation of his poetry up to that time. He was again sent to Paris in 1959, and in 1962, he was named Mexico&#x27;s ambassador to India.

==Later life==
In New Delhi, as Ambassador of Mexico to India, Paz completed several works, including &quot;El mono gramático&quot; (&quot;The Monkey Grammarian&quot;) and &quot;Ladera este&quot; (&quot;Eastern Slope&quot;). While in India, he met numerous writers of a group known as the Hungry Generation and had a profound influence on them.

In 1965, he married Marie-José Tramini, a French woman who would be his wife for the rest of his life. That fall, he went to Cornell University and taught two courses, one in Spanish and the other in English—the magazine &quot;LIFE en Español&quot; published a piece, illustrated with several pictures, about his tenure there in their July 4, 1966 issue. He subsequently returned to Mexico.

In 1968, Paz resigned from the diplomatic service in protest against the Mexican government&#x27;s massacre of student demonstrators in Tlatelolco; after seeking refuge in Paris, he again returned to Mexico in 1969, where he founded his magazine &quot;Plural&quot; (1970–1976) with a group of liberal Mexican and Latin American writers.
From 1969 to 1970, Paz was Simón Bolívar Professor at the University of Cambridge. He was also a visiting lecturer during the late 1960s, and the A. D. White Professor-at-Large from 1972 to 1974 at Cornell. In 1974, he was the Charles Eliot Norton Professor of Poetry at Harvard University; his book &quot;Los hijos del limo&quot; (&quot;Children of the Mire&quot;) was the result of his lectures. After the Mexican government closed &quot;Plural&quot; in 1975, Paz founded &quot;Vuelta&quot;, another cultural magazine. He was editor of that until his death in 1998, when the magazine closed.

Paz won the 1977 Jerusalem Prize for literature on the theme of individual freedom. In 1980, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Harvard, and in 1982, he won the Neustadt Prize. Once good friends with novelist Carlos Fuentes, Paz became estranged from him in the 1980s in a disagreement over the Sandinistas, whom Paz opposed and Fuentes supported.; in 1988, Paz&#x27;s magazine &quot;Vuelta&quot; published criticism of Fuentes by Enrique Krauze, resulting in the estrangement.

A collection of Paz&#x27;s poems (written between 1957 and 1987) was published in 1990, and in that year, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.

Paz died of cancer on April 19, 1998, in Mexico City. His ashes, along with those of his spouse, Marie-José Tramini, are kept at a memorial in the Colegio de San Ildefonso in Mexico City.

Guillermo Sheridan, who in 1998 was named by Paz as director of the Octavio Paz Foundation, published a book, &quot;Poeta con paisaje&quot; (2004), with several biographical essays about the poet.

==Aesthetics==
&quot;The poetry of Octavio Paz,&quot; wrote the critic Ramón Xirau, &quot;does not hesitate between language and silence; it leads into the realm of silence where true language lives.&quot;

==Writings==
A prolific author and poet, Paz published scores of works during his lifetime, many of which have been translated into other languages. His poetry has been translated into English by Samuel Beckett, Charles Tomlinson, Elizabeth Bishop, Muriel Rukeyser and Mark Strand. His early poetry was influenced by Marxism, surrealism, and existentialism, as well as religions such as Buddhism and Hinduism. His poem, &quot;Piedra de sol&quot; (&quot;Sunstone&quot;), written in 1957, was praised as a &quot;magnificent&quot; example of surrealist poetry in the presentation speech of his Nobel Prize.

His later poetry dealt with love and eroticism, the nature of time, and Buddhism. He also wrote poetry about his other passion, modern painting, dedicating poems to the work of Balthus, Joan Miró, Marcel Duchamp, Antoni Tàpies, Robert Rauschenberg, and Roberto Matta. As an essayist, Paz wrote on topics such as Mexican politics and economics, Aztec art, anthropology, and sexuality. His book-length essay, &quot;The Labyrinth of Solitude&quot;, delves into the minds of his countrymen, describing them as hidden behind masks of solitude; due to their history, their identity is lost between a pre-Columbian and a Spanish culture, negating either. A key work in understanding Mexican culture, the essay greatly influenced other Mexican writers, such as Carlos Fuentes. Ilan Stavans wrote that Paz was &quot;the quintessential surveyor, a Dante&#x27;s Virgil, a Renaissance man&quot;.
Paz wrote the play &quot;La hija de Rappaccini&quot; in 1956. The plot centers around a young Italian student who wanders about Professor Rappaccini&#x27;s beautiful gardens, where he espies the professor&#x27;s daughter, Beatrice. He is horrified to discover the poisonous nature of the garden&#x27;s beauty. Paz adapted the play from an 1844 short story by American writer Nathaniel Hawthorne, which was also entitled &quot;Rappaccini&#x27;s Daughter&quot;; he combined Hawthorne&#x27;s story with sources from the Indian poet Vishakadatta and influences from Japanese Noh theatre, Spanish &quot;autos sacramentales&quot;, and the poetry of William Butler Yeats. The play&#x27;s opening performance was designed by the Mexican painter Leonora Carrington. In 1972, Surrealist author André Pieyre de Mandiargues translated the play into French as &quot;La fille de Rappaccini &quot; (Editions Mercure de France). First performed in English in 1996 at the Gate Theatre in London, the play was translated and directed by Sebastian Doggart and starred Sarah Alexander as Beatrice. The Mexican composer Daniel Catán adapted the play as an opera in 1992.

Paz&#x27;s other works translated into English include several volumes of essays, some of the more prominent of which are &quot;Alternating Current&quot; (tr. 1973), &quot;Configurations&quot; (tr. 1971), in the UNESCO Collection of Representative Works, &quot;The Other Mexico&quot; (tr. 1972); and &quot;El Arco y la Lira&quot; (1956; tr. &quot;The Bow and the Lyre&quot;, 1973). In the United States, Helen Lane&#x27;s translation of &quot;Alternating Current&quot; won a National Book Award.
Along with these are volumes of critical studies and biographies, including of Claude Lévi-Strauss and Marcel Duchamp (both, tr. 1970), and &quot;The Traps of Faith&quot;, an analytical biography of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, the Mexican, seventeenth-century nun, feminist poet, mathematician, and thinker.

Paz&#x27;s works include the poetry collections &quot;¿Águila o sol?&quot; (1951), &quot;La Estación Violenta&quot;, (1956), &quot;Piedra de Sol&quot; (1957). In English, &quot;Early Poems: 1935–1955&quot; (tr. 1974) and &quot;Collected Poems, 1957–1987&quot; (1987) have been edited and translated by Eliot Weinberger, Paz&#x27;s principal translator into American English.

==Political thought==

Originally, Paz supported the Republicans during the Spanish Civil War, but after learning of the murder of one of his friends by the Stalinist secret police, he became gradually disillusioned. While in Paris in the early 1950s, influenced by David Rousset, André Breton and Albert Camus, he started publishing his critical views on totalitarianism in general, and particularly against Joseph Stalin, leader of the Soviet Union.

In his magazines &quot;Plural&quot; and &quot;Vuelta&quot;, Paz exposed the violations of human rights in Communist regimes, including Castro&#x27;s Cuba. This elicited much animosity from sectors of the Latin American Left: in the prologue to Volume IX of his complete works, Paz stated that from the time when he abandoned Communist dogma, the mistrust of many in the Mexican intelligentsia started to transform into an intense and open enmity. Paz continued to consider himself a man of the left—the democratic, &quot;liberal&quot; left, not the dogmatic and illiberal one. He also criticized the Mexican government and leading party that dominated the nation for most of the twentieth century.

Politically, Paz was a social democrat, who became increasingly supportive of liberal ideas without ever renouncing his initial leftist and romantic views. In fact, Paz was &quot;very slippery for anyone thinking in rigid ideological categories,&quot; Yvon Grenier wrote in his book on Paz&#x27;s political thought. &quot;Paz was simultaneously a romantic who spurned materialism and reason, a liberal who championed freedom and democracy, a conservative who respected tradition, and a socialist who lamented the withering of fraternity and equality. An advocate of fundamental transformation in the way we see ourselves and modern society, Paz was also a promoter of incremental change, not revolution.&quot;

In 1990, during the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin wall, Paz and his &quot;Vuelta&quot; colleagues invited several of the world&#x27;s writers and intellectuals to Mexico City to discuss the collapse of Communism; writers included Czesław Miłosz, Hugh Thomas, Daniel Bell, Ágnes Heller, Cornelius Castoriadis, Hugh Trevor-Roper, Jean-François Revel, Michael Ignatieff, Mario Vargas Llosa, Jorge Edwards and Carlos Franqui. The encounter was called &quot;The Experience of Freedom&quot; (Spanish: &quot;La experiencia de la libertad&quot;), and broadcast on Mexican television from 27 August to 2 September.

Paz said that the literature on Spanish and Portuguese colonialism is biased and &quot;is full of somber details and harsh judgments&quot;. He said that there were also immense gains:Paz criticized the Zapatista uprising in 1994. He spoke broadly in favor of a &quot;military solution&quot; to the uprising of January 1994, and hoped that the &quot;army would soon restore order in the region&quot;. With respect to President Zedillo&#x27;s offensive in February 1995, he signed an open letter that described the offensive as a &quot;legitimate government action&quot; to re-establish the &quot;sovereignty of the nation&quot; and to bring &quot;Chiapas peace and Mexicans tranquility&quot;.

=== First literary experiences ===
Paz was dazzled by &quot;The Waste Land&quot; by T. S. Eliot, in Enrique Munguia&#x27;s translation as &quot;El Páramo&quot; which was published in the magazine &quot;Contemporaries&quot; in 1930. As a result of this, although he maintained his primary interest in poetry, Paz also had an unavoidable outlook on prose: &quot;Literally, this dual practice was for me a game of reflections between poetry and prose&quot;.

Worried about confirming the existence of a link between morals and poetry, in 1931, at the age of sixteen, he wrote what would be his first published article, &quot;Ethics of the Artist&quot;, in which he posed the question of the duty of an artist among what would be deemed &quot;art of thesis,&quot; or pure art, which disqualifies the second as a result of the teaching of tradition. Employing language that resembles a religious style and, paradoxically, a Marxist one, Paz finds the true value of art in its purpose and meaning, for which the followers of pure art—of whom he is &quot;not&quot; one—are found in an isolated position and favor the Kantian idea of the &quot;man that loses all relation with the world&quot;.

The magazine &quot;Barandal&quot; appeared in August 1931, put together by Rafael López Malo, Salvador Toscano, Arnulfo Martínez Lavalle and Paz; all of them were not yet in their youth, except for Salvador Toscano, who was a renowned writer thanks to his parents. Rafael López participated in the magazine &quot;Modern&quot; and, along with Miguel D. Martínez Rendón, in the movimiento de los agoristas, although it was more commented on and known by high-school students, over all for his poem, &quot;The Golden Beast&quot;. Octavio Paz Solórzano became known in his circle as the occasional author of literary narratives that appeared in the Sunday newspaper add-in El Universal, as well as Ireneo Paz which was the name that gave a street in Mixcoac identity.

<doc id="162526" wikidata="Q1341343" url="?curid=162526" title="Neal Adams">
<text>Neal Adams (June 15, 1941 – April 28, 2022) was an American comic book artist. He was the co-founder of the graphic design studio Continuity Associates, and was a creators-rights advocate who helped secure a pension and recognition for Superman creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. During his career, Adams co-created the characters John Stewart, Man-Bat, and Ra&#x27;s al Ghul for DC Comics.

After drawing the comic strip based on the television drama &quot;Ben Casey&quot; in the early 1960s, Adams was hired as a freelancer by DC Comics in 1967. Later that year, he became the artist for the superhero character Deadman in the science fiction comic book &quot;Strange Adventures&quot;. Adams and writer Dennis O&#x27;Neil collaborated on influential runs on &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Green Lantern/Green Arrow&quot; in the early 1970s. For &quot;Batman&quot;, the duo returned the Batman character to his gothic roots as a contrast to the &quot;Batman&quot; television series of the 1960s. During their &quot;Green Lantern/Green Arrow&quot; run, O&#x27;Neil and Adams introduced a mature, realistic tone through stories such as &quot;Snowbirds Don&#x27;t Fly&quot;, in which Green Arrow&#x27;s ward Roy Harper is revealed to have become addicted to drugs. The duo created and introduced the Green Lantern character John Stewart in 1971.

Following his runs on &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Green Lantern&quot;, Adams drew other books for DC such as &quot;Superman vs. Muhammad Ali&quot; in 1978. In addition to his work with DC, Adams simultaneously freelanced for Marvel Comics on books such as &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; and &quot;The Avengers&quot;. In 1971, Adams established the art and illustration studio Continuity Associates with Dick Giordano. In 1984, Adams founded his own comic book company Continuity Comics, which was in business until 1994.

Adams was inducted into the Eisner Awards&#x27; Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 1998, the Harvey Awards&#x27; Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1999, and the Inkwell Awards Joe Sinnott Hall of Fame in 2019.

==Early life==
Neal Adams was born June 15, 1941, on Governors Island, New York City, to Frank Adams, a writer for the military, and Lilian, who ran a boardinghouse. Raised in a military family, he grew up in a series of army bases, ranging from Brooklyn to Germany. with his father largely absent from his life. Adams attended the School of Industrial Art high school in Manhattan, graduating in 1959.

==Career==
===Early work===
After graduation in 1959, he unsuccessfully attempted to find freelance work at DC Comics, and turned then to Archie Comics, where he wanted to work on the publisher&#x27;s fledgling superhero line, edited by Joe Simon. At the suggestion of staffers, Adams drew &quot;three or four pages of [the superhero] the Fly&quot;, but did not receive encouragement from Simon. Sympathetic staffers nonetheless asked Adams to draw samples for the Archie teen-humor comics themselves. While he did so, Adams said in a 2000s interview, he unknowingly broke into comics:

That panel ran in &quot;Adventures of the Fly&quot; #4 (Jan. 1960). Afterward, Adams began writing, penciling, inking, and lettering humorous full-page and half-page gag fillers for &quot;Archie&#x27;s Joke Book Magazine&quot;. In a 1976 interview, he recalled earning &quot;[a]bout $16.00 per half-page and $32.00 for a full page. That may not seem like a great deal of money, but at the time it meant a great deal to myself as well as my mothers ... as we were not in a wealthy state. It was manna from heaven, so to speak.&quot; A recommendation led him to artist Howard Nostrand, who was beginning the &quot;Bat Masterson&quot; syndicated newspaper comic strip, and he worked as Nostrand&#x27;s assistant for three months, primarily drawing backgrounds at what Adams recalled as $9 a week and &quot;a great experience&quot;.

Having &quot;not left Archie Comics under the best of circumstances&quot;, Adams turned to commercial art for the advertising industry. After a rocky start freelancing, he began landing regular work at the Johnstone and Cushing agency, which specialized in comic-book styled advertising. Helped by artist Elmer Wexler, who critiqued the young Adams&#x27; samples, Adams brought his portfolio to the agency, which initially &quot;didn&#x27;t believe I had done those particular samples since they looked so much like Elmer Wexler&#x27;s work. But they gave me a chance and ... I stayed there for about a year&quot;.

===&quot;Ben Casey&quot;===
In 1962, Adams began his comics career in earnest at the Newspaper Enterprise Association syndicate. From a recommendation, writer Jerry Caplin, a.k.a. Jerry Capp, brother of &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; creator Al Capp, invited Adams to draw samples for Capp&#x27;s proposed &quot;Ben Casey&quot; comic strip, based on the popular television medical-drama series. On the strength of his samples and of his &quot;Chip Martin, College Reporter&quot; AT&amp;T advertising comic-strip pages in &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot; magazine, and of his similar Goodyear Tire ads, Adams landed the assignment. The first daily strip, which carried Adams&#x27; signature, appeared November 26, 1962; a color Sunday strip was added September 20, 1964. Adams continued to do Johnston &amp; Cushing assignments during &quot;Ben Casey&quot;&#x27;s -year run.

Comics historian Maurice Horn said the strip &quot;did not shrink from tackling controversial problems, such as heroin addiction, illegitimate pregnancy, and attempted suicide. These were usually treated in soap opera fashion ... but there was also a touch of toughness to the proceedings, well rendered by Adams in a forceful, direct style that exuded realism and tension and accorded well with the overall tone of the strip&quot;.

In addition to Capp, Jerry Brondfield also wrote for the strip, with Adams stepping in occasionally.

The ABC series, which ran five seasons, ended March 21, 1966, with the final comic strip appearing Sunday, July 31, 1966. Despite the end of the series, Adams has said the strip, which he claimed at different points to have appeared in 365 newspapers, 265 newspapers, and 165 newspapers, ended &quot;for no other reason that it was an unhappy situation&quot;:

Adams&#x27; goal at this point was to be a commercial illustrator. While drawing &quot;Ben Casey&quot;, he had continued to do storyboards and other work for ad agencies, and said in 1976 that after leaving the strip he had shopped around a portfolio for agencies and for men&#x27;s magazines, &quot;but my material was a little too realistic and not exactly right for most. I left my portfolio in an advertising agency promising they were going to hold on to it. In the meantime I needed to make some money ... and I thought, &#x27;Why don&#x27;t I do some comics?&#x27;&quot; In a 2000s interview, he remembered the events slightly differently, saying &quot;I took [my portfolio] to various advertising people. I left it at one place overnight and when I came back to get it the next morning it was gone. So six months worth of work down the drain. ... &quot;

He worked as a ghost artist for a few weeks in 1966 on the comic strip &quot;Peter Scratch&quot; (1965–1967), a Hardboiled detective serial created by writer Elliot Caplin, brother of Al Capp and Jerry Capp, and artist Lou Fine. Comics historians also credit Adams with ghosting two weeks of dailies for Stan Drake&#x27;s &quot;The Heart of Juliet Jones&quot;, but are uncertain on dates; some sources give 1966, another 1968, and Adams himself 1963. As well, Adams drew 18 sample dailies (three weeks&#x27; continuity) of a proposed dramatic serial, &quot;Tangent&quot;, about construction engineer Barnaby Peake, his college-student brother Jeff, and their teenaged sibling Chad, in 1965, but it was not syndicated. Adams later said that Elliot Caplin offered Adams the job of drawing a comic strip based on author Robin Moore&#x27;s &quot;The Green Berets&quot;, but that Adams, who opposed the Vietnam War, where the series was set, suggested longtime DC Comics war comics artist Joe Kubert, who landed that assignment.

===Silver Age splash===

Turning to comic books, Adams found work at Warren Publishing&#x27;s black-and-white horror-comics magazines, under editor Archie Goodwin. Adams debuted there as penciler and inker of writer Goodwin&#x27;s eight-page story &quot;Curse of the Vampire&quot; in &quot;Creepy&quot; #14 (April 1967). He and Goodwin quickly collaborated on two more stories, &quot;Fair Exchange&quot; in &quot;Eerie&quot; #9 (May 1967) and &quot;The Terror Beyond Time&quot; in &quot;Creepy&quot; #15 (June 1967), and Adams as well reapproached DC Comics.

With DC war comics stalwart Joe Kubert now concentrating on the comic strip &quot;The Green Berets&quot;, Adams, despite his opposition to then-current U.S. military involvement in Vietnam, saw an opening:

Adams made his DC debut as penciler-inker of the -page story &quot;It&#x27;s My Turn to Die&quot;, written by Howard Liss, in the anthology series &quot;Our Army at War&quot; #182 (July 1967). He did a smattering of additional horror and war stories, respectively, for the two publishers, and then, after being turned down by DC&#x27;s Batman editor Julius Schwartz, approached fellow DC editor Murray Boltinoff in the hopes of drawing for Boltinoff&#x27;s Batman team-up title &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot;. Boltinoff instead assigned him to &quot;The Adventures of Jerry Lewis&quot; #101 (July–August 1967) and its full-length story &quot;Jerry the Asto-Nut&quot;, written by Arnold Drake. It became the first of a slew of stories and covers Adams would draw for that series and &quot;The Adventures of Bob Hope&quot;, two licensed titles starring fictional versions of the TV, film and nightclub comedians.

During this period near the end of the industry revival historians call the Silver Age of comic books, Adams was soon assigned his first superhero covers, illustrating that of the Superman flagship &quot;Action Comics&quot; #356 (Nov. 1967) and the same month&#x27;s &quot;Superman&#x27;s Girl Friend, Lois Lane&quot; #79 (Nov. 1967), featuring Superman and a mysterious new costumed character, Titanman. Also that month, Adams drew his first superhero story, teaming with writer Gardner Fox on the lighthearted backup feature &quot;The Elongated Man&quot; in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #369 (November 1967), the flagship Batman title. Shortly afterward, he drew Batman himself, along with the supernatural superhero the Spectre, on the cover of &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #75 (Jan. 1968) – the first published instance of Adams&#x27; work on what would become two of his signature comics characters. The first instance of Adams drawing Batman in an interior story was &quot;The Superman-Batman Revenge Squads&quot; in &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; #175 (May 1968).

Another signature character, in what would prove Adams&#x27; breakout series, was the supernatural hero Deadman, who had debuted in DC&#x27;s &quot;Strange Adventures&quot; #205 (Nov. 1967). Adams succeeded co-creator artist Carmine Infantino with the following issue&#x27;s 17-page story &quot;An Eye for an Eye&quot;, written by Arnold Drake, with George Roussos inking Adams&#x27; pencils. Adams went on to draw both the covers and stories for issues 207–216 (Dec. 1967 – Feb. 1969), and taking over the scripting with #212 (June 1968). The series became a fan sensation, winning many awards and being almost immediately inducted into the Alley Award Hall of Fame, with Adams himself receiving a special award &quot;for the new perspective and dynamic vibrance he has brought to the field of comic art&quot;.

Adams concurrently drew covers and stories for &quot;The Spectre&quot; #2–5 (Feb.-Aug. 1968), also writing the latter two issues, and became DC&#x27;s primary cover artist well into the 1970s. Adams recalled that Infantino &quot;was appointed art director, and decided I was going to be his spark plug. I also thought it was a good idea, and was promised a number of things which were never fulfilled. But I thought it would be an adventure anyway, so I knuckled down to things like &#x27;Deadman&#x27;, &quot;The Spectre&quot; and whatever odd things would come my way. I was also doing large amounts of covers&quot;.

Adams was called upon to rewrite and redraw a &quot;Teen Titans&quot; story which had been written by then-newcomers Len Wein and Marv Wolfman. The story, titled &quot;Titans Fit the Battle of Jericho!&quot;, would have introduced DC&#x27;s first African American superhero but was rejected by publisher Carmine Infantino. The revised story appeared in &quot;Teen Titans&quot; #20 (March–April 1969).

Adams&#x27; art style, honed in advertising and in the photorealistic school of dramatic-serial comics strips, marked a signal change from most comics art to that time. Comics writer and columnist Steven Grant wrote in 2009 that,

===First Marvel Comics work===

While continuing to freelance for DC, Adams in 1969 also began freelancing for Marvel Comics, where he penciled several issues of the mutant-superhero team title &quot;X-Men&quot; and one story for a horror anthology title. The Marvel &quot;Bullpen Bulletins&quot; column of &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #87 (June 1969) described Adams as having &quot;one foot planted in our Marvel doorway. We&#x27;re guessing your ecstatic comments, when you see the way he illustrated our latest &quot;X-Men&quot; bombshell, will transform him into a Marvel madman from head to toe.&quot; Such freelancing across the two leading companies was rare at the time; most DC creators who did so worked pseudonymously. Adams recalled in 1976:

He teamed with writer Roy Thomas on &quot;X-Men&quot;, then on the verge of cancellation, starting with issue #56 (May 1969). Adams penciled, colored, and, according to Thomas, did most of the plotting, including the entire plot for issue #65. In that issue, his final work on the series, Adams and writer Dennis O&#x27;Neil, in one of that creative team&#x27;s earliest collaborations, revived the Professor X character. While working on the series, Adams was paired for the first time with inker Tom Palmer, with whom he would collaborate on several acclaimed Marvel comics; the duo&#x27;s work here netted them 1969 Alley Awards for Best Pencil Artist and Best Inking Artist, respectively. Thomas won that year for Best Writer. Though the team failed to save the title, which ended its initial run with #66 (March 1970), the collaboration here and on the &quot;Kree-Skrull War&quot; arc of &quot;The Avengers&quot; #93–97 (Nov. 1971 – May 1972) produced what comics historians regard as some of Marvel&#x27;s creative highlights of the era. Adams also wrote and penciled the horror story &quot;One Hungers&quot; in &quot;Tower of Shadows&quot; #2 (Dec. 1969), and co-wrote with Thomas, but did not draw, another in &quot;Chamber of Darkness&quot; #2 (Dec. 1969). Thomas and Adams collaborated again along with scripter Gerry Conway and penciler Howard Chaykin to introduce the series &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; and its central character, Killraven, in &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot; vol. 2 #18 (May 1973).

===&quot;Batman&quot;===
Continuing to work for DC Comics during this sojourn, while also contributing the occasional story to Warren Publishing&#x27;s black-and-white horror-comics magazines (including the Don Glut-scripted &quot;Goddess from the Sea&quot; in &quot;Vampirella&quot; #1, Sept. 1969), Adams had his first collaboration on Batman with writer Dennis O&#x27;Neil. The duo, under the direction of editor Julius Schwartz, would revitalize the character with a series of noteworthy stories reestablishing Batman&#x27;s dark, brooding nature and taking the books away from the campy look and feel of the 1966–68 ABC TV series. Their first two stories were &quot;The Secret of the Waiting Graves&quot; in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #395 (Jan. 1970) and &quot;Paint a Picture of Peril&quot; in issue #397 (March 1970), with a short Batman backup story, written by Mike Friedrich, coming in-between, in &quot;Batman&quot; #219 (Feb. 1970). Adams introduced new characters to the Batman mythos beginning with Man-Bat co-created with writer Frank Robbins in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #400 (June 1970). O&#x27;Neil and Adams&#x27; creation Ra&#x27;s al Ghul was introduced in the story &quot;Daughter of the Demon&quot; in &quot;Batman&quot; #232 (June 1971) and the character would later become one of Batman&#x27;s most common adversaries. The same creative team would revive Two-Face in &quot;Batman&quot; #234 (Aug. 1971) and revitalize the Joker in &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Five-Way Revenge!&quot; in &quot;Batman&quot; #251 (Sept. 1973), a landmark story bringing the character back to his roots as a homicidal maniac who murders people on a whim and delights in his mayhem.

===&quot;Green Lantern/Green Arrow&quot; and &quot;relevant comics&quot;===

Batman&#x27;s enduring makeover was contemporaneous with Adams and O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s celebrated and, for the time, controversial revamping of the longstanding DC characters Green Lantern and Green Arrow.

Rechristening &quot;Green Lantern&quot; vol. 2 as &quot;Green Lantern/Green Arrow&quot; with issue #76 (April 1970), O&#x27;Neil and Adams teamed these two very different superheroes in a long story arc in which the characters undertook a social-commentary journey across America. A few months earlier, Adams updated Green Arrow&#x27;s visual appearance by designing a new costume and giving him a distinctive goatee beard for the character in &quot;The Brave and the Bold #85&quot; (Aug.-Sept 1969). A major exemplar of what the industry and the public at the time called &quot;relevant comics&quot;, the landmark run began with the 23-page story &quot;No Evil Shall Escape My Sight&quot; and continued to &quot;... And through Him Save a World&quot; in the series&#x27; finale, #89 (May 1972). It was during this period that one of the best known O&#x27;Neil/Adams stories appeared, in &quot;Green Lantern&quot; #85–86, when it was revealed that Green Arrow&#x27;s ward Speedy was addicted to heroin. Wrote historian Ron Goulart,

After &quot;Green Lantern&quot; was cancelled, the adventures of both super-heroes continued in the pages of &quot;The Flash&quot; #217–219 and #226 (1972–74).

===Other work for DC===
After &quot;Green Lantern/Green Arrow&quot;, Adams&#x27; contributions to DC, apart from his work on &quot;Batman&quot;, were sporadic, limiting to draw a Clark Kent back-up story in &quot;Superman&quot; #254 (1972) and sharing credits with Jim Aparo pencilling the Teen Titans in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #102 (1972). Adams also drew a few stories for &quot;Weird Western Tales&quot; and &quot;House of Mystery&quot; and covers for &quot;Action Comics&quot; and &quot;Justice League of America&quot; as well. Adams worked on the first intercompany superhero crossover &quot;Superman vs. the Amazing Spider-Man&quot;. Several of the Superman figures were redrawn by him.

The last complete story that Adams drew at DC before opening his own company, Continuity Associates, was the oversize &quot;Superman vs. Muhammad Ali&quot; (1978) which Adams has called a personal favorite. After this, Adams&#x27; production for DC and Marvel was mainly limited to new covers for reprint editions of some of his work, such as &quot;Green Lantern/Green Arrow&quot;, &quot;The Avengers: The Kree-Skrull War&quot;, &quot;X-Men: Visionaries&quot;, &quot;Deadman Collection&quot; and &quot;The Saga of Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&quot;, which were variously published as reprint miniseries or trade paperback collections. In 1988, he designed a new costume for DC&#x27;s Robin character Dick Grayson. DC loved the redesign and adopted it to the comics years later when they introduced new Robin Tim Drake. a miniposter included in the first issue of the &quot;Robin&quot; limited series.

===21st century===

In 2005 Adams returned to Marvel (his last collaboration for this publisher had been in 1981 drawing a story for the &quot;Bizarre Adventures&quot; magazine) to draw an eight-page story for the &quot;Giant-Size X-Men&quot; #3. The following year Adams (among other artists) provided art to &quot;Young Avengers Special&quot; #1.

In 2010, Adams returned to DC Comics as writer and artist on the miniseries &quot;Batman: Odyssey&quot;. Originally conceived as a 12-issue story, the series ran for six issues, being relaunched with vol. 2, #1 in October 2011. A total of seven issues were published for the second series until its end in June 2012.

Apart from those assignments for DC, Adams penciled &quot;The New Avengers&quot; vol. 2, #16.1 (Nov. 2011) for Marvel Comics. In May 2012, Marvel announced that Adams would work on the X-Men again with &quot;The First X-Men&quot;, a five-issue miniseries drawn and plotted by him and written by Christos Gage. Adams produced short stories for &quot;Batman Black and White&quot; vol. 2 #1 (Nov. 2013) and &quot;Detective Comics&quot; vol. 2 #27 (March 2014).

In February 2016, Adams revisited some of his most notable covers done for DC Comics in the 1960s and 1970s, replacing the original characters with some of the New 52 ones. Later that same year, Adams wrote and drew the six-part &quot;Superman: Coming of the Supermen&quot; miniseries. In 2017, Adams wrote and drew a &quot;Deadman&quot; limited series. He drew a new five-page story titled &quot;The Game&quot;, which was written by Paul Levitz, for the &quot;Action Comics: 80 Years of Superman&quot; hardcover collection.

In August 2020, Adams and writer Mark Waid released &quot;Fantastic Four: Antithesis&quot;, a four issue miniseries starring the Fantastic Four in a battle with a new cosmic threat. This would be his final work as an interior artist. Adams&#x27; final work as a writer (in addition to providing the artwork) would be &quot;Batman vs Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&quot;, a miniseries that was originally published in November 2019 before the final two issues were delayed to March 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Film, TV and theater==
Adams&#x27; pencil drawings on his later &quot;Batman&quot; stories were frequently inked by Dick Giordano, with whom Adams formed Continuity Associates, a company that supplied storyboards for motion pictures and interior artwork for comics publishers.

In the early 1970s, Adams was the art director, costume designer, as well as the poster/playbill illustrator for &quot;Warp!&quot;, a science fiction stage play by director Stuart Gordon and playwright Lenny Kleinfeld under the pseudonym Bury St. Edmund.

In 1980, Neal Adams directed and starred in &quot;Nannaz,&quot; later released by Troma under the title &quot;Death to the Pee Wee Squad.&quot; The film co-starred Adams&#x27; children Jason and Zeea as well as fellow comics professionals Denys Cowan, Ralph Reese, Larry Hama, and Gray Morrow.

In late 2013 Adams appeared in the PBS TV documentary &quot;Superheroes: A Never-Ending Battle&quot;.

==Creators&#x27; rights==
During the 1970s, Adams was politically active in the industry, and attempted to unionize its creative community. His efforts, along with precedents set by Atlas/Seaboard Comics&#x27; creator-friendly policies and other factors, helped lead to the modern industry&#x27;s standard practice of returning original artwork to the artist, who can earn additional income from art sales to collectors. He won his battle in 1987, when Marvel returned original artwork to him and industry legend Jack Kirby, among others. Adams helped lead lobbying efforts that resulted in Superman creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster receiving decades-overdue credit and financial remuneration.

Inker Bob McLeod recalled in the 2000s the unique place Adams held in the industry when McLeod entered the comics industry in 1973:

In 1978, Adams helped form the Comics Creators Guild, which over three dozen comic-book writers and artists joined.

Also during the 1970s, Adams illustrated paperback novels in the &quot;Tarzan&quot; series for Ballantine Books. With the independent-comic publishing boom of the early 1980s, he began working for Pacific Comics (where he produced the poorly received &quot;Skateman&quot;) and other publishers, and founded his own Continuity Comics as an offshoot of Continuity Associates. His comic-book company&#x27;s characters include Megalith, Bucky O&#x27;Hare, Skeleton Warriors, CyberRad, and Ms. Mystic. He and fellow artist Michael Netzer entered into a dispute over intellectual property rights to Ms. Mystic, a character they had worked on jointly in 1977, which Adams had published under the Pacific Comics and Continuity Comics imprints, leading to a lawsuit against Adams in United States District Court in 1993. The case was dismissed in 1997, citing the statute of limitations.

== Dina Babbitt and work related to the Holocaust ==
In collaboration with Rafael Medoff, director of the David S. Wyman Institute for Holocaust Studies, Adams championed an effort to get the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, which is operated by the government of Poland, to return the original artwork of Dina Babbitt. In exchange for his sparing her mother and herself from the gas chambers, Babbitt worked as an illustrator for Nazi death camp doctor Josef Mengele, who wanted detailed paintings to demonstrate his pseudoscientific theories about Romani racial inferiority. Using text from Medoff, Adams illustrated a six-page graphic documentary about Babbitt that was inked by Joe Kubert and contains an introduction by Stan Lee. However, Adams deemphasized any comparison between the Babbitt case and his struggle for creator rights, saying that her situation was &quot;tragic&quot; and &quot;an atrocity.&quot;

In 2010, Adams and Medoff teamed with Disney Educational Productions to produce &quot;They Spoke Out: American Voices Against the Holocaust&quot;, an online educational motion comics series that tells stories of Americans who protested Nazis or helped rescue Jews during the Holocaust. Each standalone episode, which runs from five to ten minutes, utilizes a combination of archival film footage and animatics drawn by Adams (who also narrates), and focus on a different person. The first episode, &quot;La Guardia&#x27;s War Against Hitler&quot; was screened in April 2010 at a festival sponsored by the Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art, and tells the story of the forceful stand New York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia took against Nazi Germany. La Guardia&#x27;s actions stood in contrast to the relative passivity of President Franklin Roosevelt, who historians such as David S. Wyman believe did not do as much as he could have to save European Jews, a point underlined in the episode &quot;Messenger from Hell&quot;. Other episodes include &quot;Voyage of the Doomed&quot;, which focuses on the S.S. &quot;St. Louis&quot;, the ship that carried more than 900 German-Jewish refugees but was turned away by Cuban authorities and later the Roosevelt administration, and &quot;Rescue Over the Mountains&quot;, which depicts Varian Fry, the young journalist who led an underground rescue network that smuggled Jewish refugees out of Vichy France.

==Awards and honors==

Adams&#x27; first Deadman cover won the 1967 Alley Award for Best Cover. A Batman/Deadman team-up in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #79 (Sept. 1968), by Adams and writer Bob Haney, tied with another comic for the 1968 Alley Award for Best Full-Length Story; and in 1969, Adams won the Alley Award for Best Pencil Artist, the feature &quot;Deadman&quot; was elected to the Alley Award Hall of Fame, and Adams received a special award &quot;for the new perspective and dynamic vibrance he has brought to the field of comic art&quot;.

He also won Shazam Awards in 1970 for Best Individual Story (&quot;No Evil Shall Escape My Sight&quot; in &quot;Green Lantern&quot; vol. 2, #76, with writer Dennis O&#x27;Neil), and Best Pencil Artist (Dramatic Division); and in 1971 for Best Individual Story (&quot;Snowbirds Don&#x27;t Fly&quot; in &quot;Green Lantern&quot; vol. 2, #85, with O&#x27;Neil).

Adams won the 1971 Goethe Award for Favorite Pro Artist, as well as the 1971 Goethe Award for Favorite Comic-Book Story for &quot;No Evil Shall Escape My Sight&quot; (written by Denny O&#x27;Neil) in &quot;Green Lantern/Green Arrow&quot; #76.

He won an Inkpot Award in 1976 and was voted the &quot;Favourite Comicbook Artist&quot; at the 1977 and the 1978 Eagle Awards.

In 1985, DC Comics named Adams as one of the honorees in the company&#x27;s 50th anniversary publication &quot;Fifty Who Made DC Great&quot;.

Adams was inducted into the Eisner Awards&#x27; Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 1998, and the Harvey Awards&#x27; Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1999.

In 2019, Adams was inducted into the Inkwell Awards Joe Sinnott Hall of Fame for his lifetime achievement and outstanding accomplishments.

==Advocacy of expanding Earth hypothesis==
Adams believed the Earth is growing through a process called pair production. Adams held the work of Australian geologist Samuel Warren Carey in high esteem, but considered the term &quot;Expanding Earth&quot; a misnomer. While Carey did advocate an expanding Earth in the mid-20th century, his model was rejected following the development of the theory of plate tectonics. Adams advocated his ideas in a DVD documentary he wrote and produced, clips of which are available on his YouTube channel. Planet growth animations created by Neal&#x27;s daughter Zeea Adams.

Adams appeared on the radio show &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; several times to discuss his claims. He was also interviewed by Steven Novella on a &quot;Skeptics Guide&quot; podcast in 2006, and afterward continued the debate on Novella&#x27;s blog. &quot;Japan Times&quot; columnist Jeff Ogrisseg wrote a three-part feature promoting Adams&#x27;s ideas, which was roundly criticized by Novella for being an example of &quot;outright promotion of pseudoscience as if it were news.&quot; Adams also used the concept as the basis for his &quot;Batman: Odyssey&quot; series, in which the planet&#x27;s expansion has produced a Hollow Earth, the inside of which is inhabited by dinosaurs and Neanderthal versions of the main characters.

==Personal life and death==
Adams&#x27; first wife was the innovative and exceptional comics colorist Cory Adams. Their children are Kristine (Neal&#x27;s business right hand), Joel (award-winning artist and character designer on King of the Hill), Jason (works in toy and fantasy sculpture), and Zeea (colorist, painter, digital artist and animator)

Adams and his second wife Marilyn lived in New York. Adams had their son Josh. Josh illustrated a pinup of Batman in &quot;Batman: Odyssey&quot; #1 (Sept. 2010).

Adams died in New York on April 28, 2022, at the age of 80. Marilyn, his wife of 45 years, told &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; that Adams had died from complications of sepsis.

<doc id="162533" wikidata="Q3262883" url="?curid=162533" title="Louis Philippe (musician)">
<text>Philippe Auclair (24 June 1959), also known by his moniker Louis Philippe, is a French singer-songwriter, musician, news correspondent and football journalist who has been active from the mid-1980s onwards. He is associated with the short-lived él record label, where he served as an in-house writer and producer.

==Solo career==
Born in Normandy and raised on a fruit farm, Philippe first recorded for Belgian label Les Disques du Crépuscle, under the names &quot;The Border Boys&quot; (the &quot;Tribute&quot; 12-inch EP, produced by Andy Paley, who had worked with The Ramones and the Modern Lovers previously), and &#x27;The Arcadians&#x27; (one single and one album, &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad World&quot;, 1986, later re-released on a variety of labels as &quot;Let&#x27;s Pretend&quot;). On the advice of A&amp;R man Mike Alway, Louis Philippe moved to London in late 1986, and soon became one of the major figures of cult indie label él Records (1986–1989), a subsidiary of Cherry Red Records for which he recorded five singles and three albums (&quot;Appointment With Venus&quot;, 1987; &quot;Ivory Tower&quot;, 1988; &quot;Yuri Gagarin&quot;, 1989). He also appeared in one guise or another — as songwriter, arranger, backing vocalist or instrumentalist — on more than half of all the label&#x27;s releases. él, now considered to be one of the most influential labels of its time, was, however, not a commercial success in the UK; but it scored a string of independent hits in Japan, where Louis Philippe (whose &quot;You Mary You&quot; was él&#x27;s best-selling single) became an iconic figure for the so-called Shibuya-kei, or &#x27;Shibuya Sound&#x27;.

Following the demise of él in 1989, he turned to Japan to pursue his career, with the support of celebrity fans such as Cornelius. A number of albums followed, all of them released on the Trattoria label: &quot;Rainfall&quot;, 1991; &quot;Jean Renoir&quot;, 1992, both of them recorded with multi-instrumentalist Dean Brodrick; &quot;Delta Kiss&quot;, 1993; &quot;Sunshine&quot;, produced by Bertrand Burgalat, 1994; &quot;Jackie Girl&quot;, 1996, the first of his records to feature XTC guitarist Dave Gregory; &quot;Azure&quot;, recorded with the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra, and &quot;Nusch&quot;, a collection of Francis Poulenc mélodies, 1999. All these albums were conceived and realised with the help of long-time collaborator, pianist and double-bassist Danny Manners. Trattoria&#x27;s help enabled him to find licenses for these records, first in France, Britain and Spain, then in the US. These critically well-received records consolidated his &quot;cult&quot; status in the indiepop world; a couple of them charted: &quot;L&#x27;Hiver te va bien&quot; reached the Top 30 in France in 1994, while &quot;She Means Everything To Me&quot; reached the no.1 spot on the Campus Radio Charts in the US in 1998, following an appearance at New York&#x27;s CMJ Music Marathon. 

==Collaborations==
Louis Philippe has enjoyed a parallel career as an arranger, producer and instrumentalist since the late 1980s. The artists he has worked with or for include Valérie Lemercier, April March, P. J. Proby, Martin Newell, Sean O&#x27;Hagan of The High Llamas, Mathilde Santing, Towa Tei, Nina Morato, Cinnamon, Humbert Humbert, Laïla Amezian, La Buena Vida, The Clientele, Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka (contributing to the arranged soundtrack for the Famicom video game &quot;Mother&quot; in 1989.), Big Big Train (the albums &quot;English Electric Part One&quot; and &quot;English Electric Part Two)&quot;, Ralegh Long, Bertrand Burgalat and others. A collaboration of note was the album &quot;9th &amp; 13th&quot; (Tricatel, 2001), in which he teamed up with Danny Manners and novelist Jonathan Coe, to produce musical settings for the latter&#x27;s writings. Jonathan Coe, who had contributed the sleevenotes to &quot;Azure&quot;, and had used a verse of his song &quot;Yuri Gagarin&quot; as an epigraph for his best-seller &quot;What a Carve Up!&quot;, has also written a number of lyrics for him since &quot;My Favourite Part of You&quot; (2002).

==Recent projects==
Louis Philippe has worked with Young Marble Giants leader Stuart Moxham since the 1990s; the duo have played a number of live dates and released a CD, &quot;The Huddle House&quot;, in 2007. That CD was released on Auclair&#x27;s own record label, Wonder Records, in London. Louis arranged and co-produced Louise Le May&#x27;s debut CD &quot;Tell Me One Thing That is New&quot; (Folkwit Records) in 2010 and completed the same singer&#x27;s debut album in April 2015. Releases include &quot;My Favourite Part of You&quot; (2002) and &quot;The Wonder of it All&quot; (2004). A live double-album was released in February 2007, followed by a new studio album, entitled &quot;An Unknown Spring&quot;, in May of the same year. &quot;The Ocean Tango&quot;, conceived and recorded with Swedish band Testbild!, was released in the autumn of 2010. Another duo album with Stuart Moxham, &quot;The Devil Laughs&quot;, was released in July 2020 on the Chicago-based tinyGLOBAL Solutions label. His new solo album, &quot;Thunderclouds&quot;, recorded with The Night Mail, a band which comprises Robert Rotifer, Ian Button and Andy Lewis was released on Tapete Records in December 2020.

==Other activities==
Louis Philippe is also well known in his native country (under his real name Philippe Auclair) as a football journalist. He has held the position of England correspondent for &quot;France Football&quot; magazine since 1999 and fulfilled a similar role for news and sports radio RMC Info until 2018. He appeared as French football analyst on Setanta Sports News channel in England, and can be heard regularly on Talksport radio in England, Newstalk radio in Ireland, the BBC World Service, BBC Five Live, BBC London, BBC Scotland and Football Weekly, a podcast hosted by &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper. His biography of Eric Cantona, &quot;Cantona — The Rebel Who Would Be King&quot; (Macmillan publishing) was long-listed for the William Hill Sports Book of the Year award in September 2009, and was the joint winner of the &#x27;Best Football Book&#x27; category of the British Sports Book Awards in March 2010. His second biography, an account of Thierry Henry&#x27;s life and career entitled &quot;Lonely at the Top&quot; was also long-listed for the 2013 William Hill Prize.

<text>Joshua Slocum (February 20, 1844 – on or shortly after November 14, 1909) was the first person to sail single-handedly around the world. He was a Nova Scotian-born, naturalised American seaman and adventurer, and a noted writer. In 1900 he wrote a book about his journey, &quot;Sailing Alone Around the World&quot;, which became an international best-seller. He disappeared in November 1909 while aboard his boat, the &quot;Spray&quot;.

==Nova Scotian childhood==
Joshua Slocum was born on February 20, 1844, in Mount Hanley, Annapolis County, Nova Scotia (officially recorded as Wilmot Station), a community on the North Mountain within sight of the Bay of Fundy. The fifth of eleven children of John Slocomb and Sarah Jane Slocombe &quot;née&quot; Southern, Joshua descended, on his father&#x27;s side, from a Quaker known as &quot;John the Exile&quot;, who left the United States shortly after 1780 because of his opposition to the American War for Independence. As part of the Loyalist migration to Nova Scotia, the Slocombes were granted of farmland in Nova Scotia&#x27;s Annapolis County.

Joshua Slocum was born in the family&#x27;s farmhouse in Mount Hanley and learned to read and write at the nearby Mount Hanley School. His earliest ventures on the water were made on coastal schooners operating out of the small ports such as Port George and Cottage Cove near Mount Hanley along the Bay of Fundy.

When Joshua was eight years old, the Slocomb family (Joshua changed the spelling of his last name later in his life) moved from Mount Hanley to Brier Island in Digby County, at the mouth of the Bay of Fundy. Slocum&#x27;s maternal grandfather was the keeper of the lighthouse at Southwest Point there. His father, a stern man and strict disciplinarian, took up making leather boots for the local fishermen, and Joshua helped in the shop. However, the boy found the scent of salt air much more alluring than the smell of shoe leather. He yearned for a life of adventure at sea, away from his demanding father and his increasingly chaotic life at home among so many brothers and sisters.

He made several attempts to run away from home, finally succeeding, at age fourteen, by hiring on as a cabin boy and cook on a fishing schooner, but he soon returned home. In 1860, after the birth of the eleventh Slocombe child and the subsequent death of his kindly mother, Joshua, then sixteen, left home for good. He and a friend signed on at Halifax as ordinary seamen on a merchant ship bound for Dublin, Ireland.

==Early life at sea==
From Dublin, he crossed to Liverpool to become an ordinary seaman on the British merchant ship &quot;Tangier&quot; (also recorded as &quot;Tanjore&quot;), bound for China. During two years as a seaman he rounded Cape Horn twice, landed at Batavia (now Jakarta) in the Dutch East Indies, and visited the Maluku Islands, Manila, Hong Kong, Saigon, Singapore, and San Francisco. While at sea, he studied for the Board of Trade examination, and, at the age of eighteen, he received his certificate as a fully qualified Second Mate. Slocum quickly rose through the ranks to become a Chief Mate on British ships transporting coal and grain between the British Isles and San Francisco.

In 1865, he settled in San Francisco, became an American citizen, and, after a period spent salmon fishing and fur trading in the Oregon Territory of the northwest, he returned to the sea to pilot a schooner in the coastal trade between San Francisco and Seattle. His first blue-water command, in 1869, was the barque &quot;Washington&quot;, which he took across the Pacific, from San Francisco to Australia, and home via Alaska.

He sailed for thirteen years out of the port of San Francisco, transporting mixed cargo to China, Australia, the Spice Islands, and Japan. Between 1869 and 1889 he was the master of eight vessels, the first four of which (the &quot;Washington&quot;, the &quot;Constitution&quot;, the &quot;Benjamin Aymar&quot; and the &quot;Amethyst&quot;) he commanded in the employ of others. Later, there would be four others that he himself owned, in whole or in part.

==Family at sea==

On 9 January 1871, Slocum and the &quot;Constitution&quot; put in at Sydney. There he met, courted, and married Virginia Albertina Walker. They were married on January 31, 1871 and the couple left Sydney on the &quot;Constitution&quot; the following day. Miss Walker, quite coincidentally, was an American whose New York family had migrated west to California at the time of the 1849 gold rush and eventually continued on, by ship, to settle in Australia. She sailed with Slocum, and, over the next thirteen years, the couple had seven children, all born at sea or foreign ports. Four children, sons Victor, Benjamin Aymar, and James Garfield, and daughter Jessie, survived to adulthood.

In Alaska, the &quot;Washington&quot; was wrecked when she dragged her anchor during a gale, ran ashore, and broke up. Slocum, however, at considerable risk to himself, managed to save his wife, the crew, and much of the cargo, bringing all back to port safely in the ship&#x27;s open boats. The owners of the shipping company that had employed Slocum were so impressed by this feat of ingenuity and leadership, they gave him the command of the &quot;Constitution&quot; which he sailed to Hawaii and the west coast of Mexico.

His next command was the &quot;Benjamin Aymar&quot;, a merchant vessel in the South Seas trade. However, the owner, strapped for cash, sold the vessel out from under Slocum, and he and Virginia found themselves stranded in the Philippines without a ship.

=== The &quot;Pato&quot; ===
While in the Philippines, in 1874, under a commission from a British architect, Slocum organized native workers to build a 150-ton steamer in the shipyard at Subic Bay. In partial payment for the work, he was given the ninety-ton schooner, &quot;Pato&quot; (Spanish for &quot;Duck&quot;), the first ship he could call his own.

Ownership of the &quot;Pato&quot; afforded Slocum the kind of freedom and autonomy he had never previously experienced. Hiring a crew, he contracted to deliver a cargo to Vancouver in British Columbia. Thereafter, he used the &quot;Pato&quot; as a general freight carrier along the west coast of North America and in voyages back and forth between San Francisco and Hawaii. During this period, Slocum also fulfilled a long-held ambition to become a writer, and became a temporary correspondent for the &quot;San Francisco Bee&quot;.

The Slocums sold the &quot;Pato&quot; in Honolulu in the spring of 1878. Returning to San Francisco, they purchased the &quot;Amethyst.&quot; He worked this ship until June 23, 1881.
The Slocums next bought a third share in the &quot;Northern Light 2&quot;. This large clipper was 233 feet in length, 44 feet beam, 28 feet in the hold. It was capable of carrying 2000 tons on three decks. Although Joshua Slocum called this ship &quot;my best command&quot;, it was a command plagued with mutinies and mechanical problems. Under troubling legal circumstances (caused by his alleged treatment of the chief mutineer) he sold his share in the &quot;Northern Light 2&quot; in 1883.

===The &quot;Aquidneck&quot;===
The Slocum family continued on their next ship, the 326-ton &quot;Aquidneck&quot;. In 1884, Slocum&#x27;s wife Virginia became ill aboard the &quot;Aquidneck&quot; in Buenos Aires and died. After sailing to Massachusetts, Slocum left his three youngest children, Benjamin Aymar, Jessie, and Garfield in the care of his sisters; his oldest son Victor continued as his first mate.

In 1886, at age 42, Slocum married his 24-year-old cousin, Henrietta &quot;Hettie&quot; Elliott. The Slocum family, with the exception of Jessie and Benjamin Aymar, again took to the sea aboard the &quot;Aquidneck&quot;, bound for Montevideo, Uruguay. Slocum&#x27;s second wife would find life at sea much less appealing than his first. A few days into Henrietta&#x27;s first voyage, the &quot;Aquidneck&quot; sailed through a hurricane. By the end of this first year, the crew had contracted cholera, and they were quarantined for six months. Later, Slocum was forced to defend his ship from pirates, one of whom he shot and killed; following which he was tried and acquitted of murder. Next, the &quot;Aquidneck&quot; was infected with smallpox, leading to the death of three of the crew. Disinfecting of the ship was performed at considerable cost. Shortly afterward, near the end of 1887, the &quot;Aquidneck&quot; was wrecked in southern Brazil.

===The &quot;Liberdade&quot;===
After being stranded in Brazil with his wife and sons Garfield and Victor, he started building a boat that could sail them home. He used local materials, salvaged materials from the &quot;Aquidneck&quot;, and worked with local workers. The boat was launched on May 13, 1888, the very day slavery was abolished in Brazil, and therefore the ship was given the name &quot;Liberdade&quot;, the Portuguese word for freedom.
It was an unusual junk-rigged design which he described as &quot;half Cape Ann dory and half Japanese sampan&quot;. He and his family began their voyage back to the United States, his son Victor (15) being the mate.

After fifty-five days at sea and 5510 miles, the Slocums reached Cape Roman, South Carolina and continued inland to Washington D.C. for the winter and finally reaching Boston via New York in 1889. This was the last time Henrietta sailed with the family. In 1890, Slocum published his accounts of these adventures in &quot;Voyage of the Liberdade&quot;.

==Voyage of the &quot;Destroyer&quot;==
In the northern winter of 1893–94, Slocum undertook what he described as, at that time, being &quot;the hardest voyage that I have ever made, without any exception at all.&quot; It involved delivering the steam-powered torpedo boat &quot;Destroyer&quot; from the east coast of the United States to Brazil.

&quot;Destroyer&quot; was a ship in length, conceived by the Swedish-American inventor and mechanical engineer John Ericsson, and intended for the defence of harbours and coastal waters. Equipped in the early 1880s, with sloping armour plate and a bow-mounted submarine gun, it was an evolution of the Monitor warship type of the American Civil War. &quot;Destroyer&quot; was intended to fire an early form of torpedo at an opposing ship from a range of , and was a &quot;vessel of war partially armored to attack bows-on at short range.&quot;

Despite the loss of the &quot;Aquidneck&quot;, and the privations of his family&#x27;s voyage in the self-built &quot;Liberdade&quot;, Slocum retained a fondness for Brazil. During 1893, Brazil was faced with a political crisis in Rio Grande do Sul, and an attempt at civil war that was intensified by the revolt of the country&#x27;s navy in September.

Slocum agreed to a request by the Brazilian government to deliver the &quot;Destroyer&quot; to Pernambuco, Brazil, with financial and vindictive motives. As Slocum describes, his contract with the commander of government forces at Pernambuco was, &quot;to go against the rebel fleet, and sink them all, if we could find them – big and little – for a handsome sum of gold ...&quot; Slocum also saw the possibility of getting even with the &quot;arch rebel&quot; Admiral Melo (of whom he writes as &quot;Mello&quot;): &quot;Confidentially: I was burning to get a rake at Mello and his &quot;Aquideban&quot;. He it was, who in that ship expelled my bark, the &quot;Aquidneck&quot;, from Ilha Grande some years ago, under the cowardly pretext that we might have sickness on board. But that story has been told. I was burning to let him know and palpably feel that this time I had in dynamite instead of hay&quot;.

Towed by the &quot;Santuit&quot;, Slocum and a small crew aboard the &quot;Destroyer&quot; left Sandy Hook, New Jersey, on 7 December 1893. The following day the ship was already taking on water: &quot;A calamity has overtaken us. The ship&#x27;s top seams are opening and one of the new sponsons, the starboard one, is already waterlogged.&quot; Despite all hands pumping and bailing, by midnight the seas were extinguishing the fires in the boilers which were kept alight only by throwing on rounds of pork fat and tables and chairs from the vessel.

With a storm continuing to blow on the 9th, the crew was able to lower the level of water in the hold and plug some of the holes and leaks. The bailing out of water, using a large improvised canvas bag, continued from the 9th to the 13th and succeeded in maintaining the level of water in the hold below . On the 13th they were again hit by a storm and cross seas and had to bail all night. On the 14th, heavy seas disabled the rudder. By the afternoon of 15 December, the &quot;Destroyer&quot; was to the south-west of Puerto Rico, heading for Martinique, and still weathering storms.

By that time, with the fires in the boilers extinguished, all hands were bailing for their lives: &quot;The main hull of the &quot;Destroyer&quot; is already a foot (30cm) under water, and going on down&quot;. The crew had no other option than to keep bailing and try to keep the ship afloat, as the vessel &quot;could not be insured for the voyage; nor would any company insure a life on board&quot;. By the morning of the 16th the storm had abated, allowing the &quot;Destroyer&quot; to anchor to the south of Puerto Rico.

Although the ship&#x27;s best steam pump had been put out of action on 19 December, more favourable seas allowed the crew to reach Martinique, where repairs were made before again setting sail on 5 January 1894. On 18 January, the &quot;Destroyer&quot; arrived at Fernando de Noronha, an island some from the coast of Brazil, before finally reaching Recife, Pernambuco, on the 20th. Slocum wrote: &quot;My voyage home from Brazil in the canoe &quot;Liberdade&quot;, with my family for crew and companions, some years ago, although a much longer voyage was not of the same irksome nature.&quot;

At Pernambuco, the &quot;Destroyer&quot; joined up with the Brazilian navy and the crew was again engaged in repairs as the long tow in heavy seaways had severed rivets at the bow, resulting in leaks. Wet powder led to a failed test-firing of the submarine gun and the ship was grounded to remove the projectile. But the strain of the swell led to a further leak. Following further repairs, the &quot;Destroyer&quot; made for Bahia with replenishments of powder for the Brazilian fleet, arriving on 13 February. Once there, however, Admiral Gonçalves of the Brazilian navy seized the ship. At the Arsenal at Bahia, an apparently incompetent alternative crew grounded the &quot;Destroyer&quot; on a rock in the basin. The vessel was holed and subsequently abandoned.

==The &quot;Spray&quot;: First solo circumnavigation of the earth==
Slocum rebuilt the gaff rigged sloop oyster boat named &quot;Spray&quot; in Fairhaven, Massachusetts, during 1891 and 1892. On June 21, 1892, he launched the painstakingly rebuilt vessel.

On April 24, 1895, he set sail from Boston, Massachusetts. In his famous book, &quot;Sailing Alone Around the World&quot;, now considered a classic of travel literature, he described his departure in the following manner:

After an extended visit to his boyhood home at Brier Island and visiting old haunts on the coast of Nova Scotia, Slocum departed North America at Sambro Island Lighthouse near Halifax, Nova Scotia, on July 3, 1895.

Slocum intended sailing eastward around the world, using the Suez Canal, but when he got near Gibraltar he realized that sailing through the southern Mediterranean would be too dangerous for a lone sailor because piracy was still prevalent there at the time. So he decided to sail westward, in the southern hemisphere. He headed to Brazil, and then to the Straits of Magellan. At that point he was unable to start across the Pacific for forty days because of a storm. Eventually, he made his way to Australia, sailed north along its east coast, crossed the Indian Ocean, rounded the Cape of Good Hope, and then headed back to North America.

Slocum navigated without a chronometer, instead relying on the traditional method of dead reckoning to establish longitude, which required only a cheap tin clock for approximate time, and used noon-sun sights for latitude. On one long passage in the Pacific, he also famously shot a lunar distance observation, decades after those observations had ceased to be commonly employed, which allowed him to check his longitude independently. However, Slocum&#x27;s primary method for finding longitude was still dead reckoning, and he recorded only one lunar observation during the entire circumnavigation.

Slocum normally sailed the &quot;Spray&quot; without touching the helm. Due to the length of the sail plan relative to the hull, and the long keel, the &quot;Spray&quot; was capable of self-steering (unlike faster modern craft), and he balanced it stably on any course relative to the wind by adjusting or reefing the sails and by lashing the helm fast. He sailed west across the Indian Ocean without once touching the helm.

More than three years later, on June 27, 1898, he returned to Newport, Rhode Island, having circumnavigated the world and sailing a distance of more than 46,000 miles (74,000 km). Slocum&#x27;s return went almost unnoticed. The Spanish–American War, which had begun two months earlier, dominated the headlines but, after the end of major hostilities, many American newspapers published articles describing Slocum&#x27;s adventure.

===&quot;Sailing Alone Around the World&quot;===

In 1899, he published his account of the voyage in &quot;Sailing Alone Around the World&quot;, first serialized in &quot;The Century Magazine&quot; and then in several book-length editions. Reviewers received the slightly anachronistic age-of-sail adventure story enthusiastically. Arthur Ransome went so far as to declare: &quot;Boys who do not like this book ought to be drowned at once.&quot; In his review, Sir Edwin Arnold wrote, &quot;I do not hesitate to call it the most extraordinary book ever published.&quot;

Slocum&#x27;s book deal was an integral part of his journey. His publisher had provided Slocum with an extensive on-board library, and Slocum wrote several letters to his editor from distant points around the globe. His &quot;Sailing Alone&quot; won him widespread fame in the English-speaking world, and he was one of eight invited speakers at a dinner in honor of Mark Twain in December 1900. Slocum hauled the &quot;Spray&quot; up the Erie Canal to Buffalo, New York, for the Pan-American Exposition in the summer of 1901, and he was well compensated for participating in the fair.

==Later life==
In 1901, Slocum&#x27;s book revenues and income from public lectures provided him enough financial security to purchase a small farm in West Tisbury, on the island of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, in Massachusetts. After a year and a half, he found he could not adapt to a settled life and he sailed the &quot;Spray&quot; from port to port in the northeastern US during the summer and in the West Indies during the winter, lecturing and selling books wherever he could. Slocum spent little time with his wife on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard and preferred life aboard the &quot;Spray&quot;, usually wintering in the Caribbean. In 1902 he was arrested in Riverton, New Jersey, on a charge of raping a twelve-year-old girl who had taken a public tour of the Spray. It emerged that the girl had not been assaulted but that Slocum may have exposed himself to her, though he said that he had no memory of the incident. He pleaded no contest to the reduced charge of indecent exposure and spent over a month in jail.

Slocum and the &quot;Spray&quot; visited Sagamore Hill, the estate of US President Theodore Roosevelt on the north shore of Long Island, New York. Roosevelt and his family were interested in the tales of Slocum&#x27;s solo circumnavigation. The President&#x27;s young son, Archie, along with a guardian, spent the next few days sailing with Slocum up to Newport aboard the &quot;Spray&quot;, which, by then, was a decrepit, weather-worn vessel. Slocum again met with President Roosevelt in May 1907, this time at the White House in Washington. Supposedly, Roosevelt said to him, &quot;Captain, our adventures have been a little different.&quot; Slocum answered, &quot;That is true, Mr. President, but I see you got here first.&quot;

By 1909, Slocum&#x27;s funds were running low; book revenues had tailed off. He prepared to sell his farm on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard and began to make plans for a new adventure in South America. He had hopes of another book deal.

==Disappearance==
On November 14, 1909, Slocum set sail in the &quot;Spray&quot; from Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts, for the West Indies on one of his usual winter voyages. He had also expressed interest in starting his next adventure, exploring the Orinoco, Rio Negro and Amazon Rivers. Slocum was never heard from again. In July 1910, his wife informed the newspapers that she believed he was lost at sea.

Despite being an experienced mariner, Slocum never learned to swim and considered learning to swim to be useless. Many mariners shared this thought, as swimming would only be useful if land was extremely close by.

In 1924, Joshua Slocum was declared legally dead.

==Legacy==
Slocum&#x27;s achievements have been well publicised and honoured. The name &quot;Spray&quot; has become a choice for cruising yachts ever since the publication of Slocum&#x27;s account of his circumnavigation. Over the years, many versions of &quot;Spray&quot; have been built from the plans in Slocum&#x27;s book, more or less reconstructing the sloop with various degrees of success.

Similarly, the French long-distance sailor Bernard Moitessier christened his ketch-rigged boat &quot;Joshua&quot; in honor of Slocum. It was this boat that Moitessier sailed from Tahiti to France, and he also sailed &quot;Joshua&quot; in the 1968 Sunday Times Golden Globe Race around the world, making good time, only to abandon the race near the end and sail on to the Polynesian Islands.

Ferries named in Slocum&#x27;s honour (&quot;Joshua Slocum&quot; and &quot;Spray&quot;) served the two Digby Neck runs in Nova Scotia between 1973 and 2004. The &quot;Joshua Slocum&quot; was featured in the film version of &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot;.

An underwater glideran autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), designed by the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, was named after Slocum&#x27;s ship &quot;Spray&quot;. It became the first AUV to cross the Gulf Stream, while operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Another AUV has been named after Slocum himself: the Slocum Electric Glider, designed by Douglas Webb of Webb Research (since 2008, Teledyne Webb Research).

In 2009, a Slocum glider, modified by Rutgers University, crossed the Atlantic in 221 days. The RU27 traveled from Tuckerton, New Jersey, to Baiona, Pontevedra, Spain – the port where Christopher Columbus landed on his return from his first voyage to the New World. Like Slocum himself, the Slocum glider is capable of traveling over thousands of kilometers. These gliders continue to be used by various research institutions, including Texas A&amp;M University&#x27;s Department of Oceanography and Geochemical and Environmental Research Group (GERG), to explore the Gulf of Mexico and other bodies of water.

A monument to Slocum exists on Brier Island, Nova Scotia, not far from his family&#x27;s boot shop. He is commemorated in museum exhibits at the New Bedford Whaling Museum in Massachusetts, the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and the Mount Hanley Schoolhouse Museum near his birthplace. Several biographies about Slocum are published.

The Slocum River in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, was named for him, as was a newly discovered plant in Mauritius while he was there: &quot;Returning to the &quot;Spray&quot; by way of the great flower conservatory near Moka, the proprietor, having only that morning discovered a new and hardy plant, to my great honor named it &#x27;Slocum&#x27;&quot;. Slocum himself discovered an island by accident, and named it &quot;Alan Erric Island&quot;.

Slocum was inducted into the National Sailing Hall of Fame in 2011.

<text>Hugo Banzer Suárez (; 10 May 1926 – 5 May 2002) was a Bolivian politician and military officer who served as the 51st president of Bolivia. He held the Bolivian presidency twice: from 1971 to 1978 as a military dictator; and then again from 1997 to 2001, as a democratically elected president.

Banzer rose to power via a coup d&#x27;état against socialist president Juan José Torres and repressed labor leaders, clergymen, indigenous people, and students during his 1971–1978 dictatorship. Several thousand Bolivians were either forced to seek asylum in foreign countries, arrested, tortured, or killed during this period, known as the &quot;Banzerato&quot;.

After Banzer&#x27;s removal via a coup led by Juan Pereda, he remained an influential figure in Bolivian politics and would run for election to the presidency via the ballot box on several occasions, eventually succeeding in 1997 via a narrow plurality of 22.26% of the popular vote. During Banzer&#x27;s constitutional term, he extended presidential term limits from four years to five and presided over the Cochabamba Water War, declaring a state of siege in 2000 that suspended several civil liberties and lead to violent clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement. After being diagnosed with lung cancer, Banzer resigned in 2001 and was succeeded by Vice President Jorge Quiroga.

==Military and ideological formation==
Banzer was native to the rural lowlands of the Santa Cruz Department. He attended military schools in Bolivia, Argentina, Brazil and the United States, including the Armored Cavalry School at Fort Hood, Texas. He took a Motor Officer Course at the School of the Americas. He was a descendant of the German immigrant Georg Banzer Schewetering.

Banzer was promoted to colonel in 1961, and appointed three years later to head the Ministry of Education and Culture in the government of General René Barrientos, a personal friend. Banzer became increasingly involved in politics, siding with the right wing of the Bolivian Army. He was also appointed director of the military academy and the Coronel Gualberto Villarroel Military School.

==As plotter (1970–1971)==
In 1970, President Juan José Torres was leading the country in a leftist direction, arousing the ire and mistrust of conservative anti-communist circles in Bolivia and, crucially, in the Nixon administration. He had called an Asamblea del Pueblo, or People&#x27;s Assembly, in which representatives of specific &quot;proletarian&quot; sectors of society were represented (miners, unionized teachers, students, peasants). The Assembly was imbued with all the powers of a working parliament, even though the right-wing opponents of the regime tended to call it a gathering of virtual soviets. Torres also allowed labor leader, Juan Lechín, to resume his post as head of the Central Obrera Boliviana/Bolivian Workers&#x27; Union (COB). These measures, coupled with Ovando&#x27;s earlier nationalization of Gulf Oil properties, angered his opponents even more, chief among whom was Banzer and his US supporters. In early 1971, a faction of the Bolivian military attempted to unseat the new president but failed, whereupon Banzer fled to Argentina, but did not give up his ambitions to the presidency.
On 17 August 1971, Banzer, at long last, masterminded a successful military uprising that erupted in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, where he had many supporters. Eventually, the plotters gained control over the La Paz garrisons, although not without considerable bloodshed. The combined levels of United States and Brazilian involvement for the coup d&#x27;état have been debated but according to Stephen Zunes it is apparent that significant clandestine financial and advisory assistance existed at a critical level within the Nixon administration for Banzer.
With such backing secured, Banzer emerged as the strong man of the new regime, and, on 22 August, was given full power as president. Conversely, President Juan José Torres was forced to take refuge in Buenos Aires, Argentina where five years later he was kidnapped and assassinated by right-wing death squads associated with the Videla government and with the acquiescence of Banzer. His murder was part of Operation Condor. Banzer received the political support of the center-right Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario (MNR) of former president Víctor Paz Estenssoro and the conservative Falange Socialista Boliviana of Mario Gutiérrez, considered to be the two largest parties in the country. For the next seven years, and with the rank of army general, he ruled Bolivia as dictator.

Frustrated by the political divisions and protests that characterized the Torres and Ovando years, and, traditionally an enemy of dissent and freedom of speech, Banzer banned all the left-leaning parties, suspended the powerful Central Obrera Boliviana, and closed the nation&#x27;s universities. &quot;Order&quot; was now the paramount aim, and no means were spared to restore authority and stifle dissent. Buoyed by the initial legitimacy provided by Paz and Gutierrez&#x27;s support, the dictator ruled with a measure of civilian support until 1974, when the main parties realized he did not intend to hold elections and was instead using them to perpetuate himself in power. At that point, Banzer dispensed with all pretenses and banned all political activity, exiled all major leaders (Paz Estenssoro included), and proceeded to rule henceforth solely with military support.

Human rights groups claim that during Banzer&#x27;s 1971–1978 tenure (known as the &quot;Banzerato&quot;) several thousand Bolivians sought asylum in foreign countries, 3,000 political opponents were arrested, 200 were killed, and many more were tortured. In the basement of the Ministry of the Interior or &quot;the horror chambers&quot; around 2,000 political prisoners were held and tortured during the 1971–1978 military rule. Many others simply disappeared. Among the victims of the regime were Colonel Andrés Selich, Banzer&#x27;s first Minister of the Interior and co-conspirator in the August 1971 coup. Selich was accused of plotting to overthrow Banzer and died of blows sustained while in custody. Two other leaders with sufficient stature to potentially eclipse the dictator were murdered under suspicious circumstances while in exile: General Joanquin Zenteno Anaya and former president Juan José Torres, both in 1976. Klaus Barbie, former head of the Gestapo de Lyon, was integrated into the special services in order to &quot;renew&quot; repression techniques and received Bolivian nationality. During the Banzer government, drug trafficking experienced an unprecedented expansion that lasted until the 1980s.

Much of the stability achieved by the &quot;Banzerato&quot; was sustained by the constant flow of easy credit from abroad, which was often used on mammoth &quot;white elephant&quot; projects of dubious usefulness but which nonetheless impressed certain sectors of the population. The loans would soon raise Bolivia&#x27;s external debt to record levels, but proved useful in the manipulation of political patronage. In 1975, Banzer restored diplomatic relations with Chile, broken since 1962, with an eye toward obtaining an access to the Pacific Ocean, denied to Bolivia since the loss of its maritime coast in the 19th century War of the Pacific. The Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet offered a narrow outlet just north of the port of Arica, on the border with Peru, on lands that had previously belonged to that country. According to the terms of the treaty that handed that territory to Chile, Peru had to agree to any proposal of transferring that land to a third party. Peru refused to accept the Pinochet proposal and instead created its own counter-proposal, which declared Arica and its waters an area of joint-sovereignty between the three nations. Chile refused this proposal and talks with Bolivia ended. Diplomatic relations were once again frozen in 1978.

===Democratic opening of 1978 and toppling===
Pressure from the Carter administration forced Banzer to institute a carefully regulated &quot;democratic opening&quot; in 1978. A restricted amnesty was declared, and the country prepared for democratic elections. Since the Bolivian constitution did not at the time allow a sitting president to immediately succeed himself, Banzer initially endorsed General Juan Pereda as the regime&#x27;s candidate. It was assumed that Pereda would be elected with government &quot;help&quot; at the polls, rule for four years, and then allow Banzer to return as constitutional president once he had time to polish up his image and transition to civilian politics. However, by election time the popularity of a left-wing coalition of former president Hernán Siles was such that nothing could disguise it.

Nonetheless, the elections of 9 July were rigged. Official results showed Pereda not only far ahead of Siles, but with just a few thousand votes over the threshold to win the presidency outright. However, massive protests brought the country to a halt, and independent organizations agreed that all exit polls indicated that Siles had actually won handily. It later emerged that some 200,000 more votes were cast than the total number of registered voters.

With the evidence of irregularities too great to ignore, Banzer had the Electoral Court annul the elections. He denounced the electoral fraud, blaming it on Pereda and his supporters. He declared he would call fresh elections within a year or two.

However, Pereda and other officers felt Banzer was manipulating them for his own political ends. They overthrew Banzer in a coup on 21 July. Pereda blamed Banzer for the fraud and promised to call elections in the future, though he did not specify a time frame. Pereda, in turn, was overthrown in November 1978 by democratically oriented officers under General David Padilla who, embarrassed by the events of the last few months, and suspecting that Pereda did not intend to call new elections either, promptly set a firm date for a return to civilian rule.

==Civilian political leader==
Upon leaving office, Banzer formed the ADN party &quot;(Acción Democrática Nacionalista)&quot;, a large organization that attracted most conservative groups under his leadership. Banzer ran for elections in 1979 and 1980, obtaining third place in both contests. The 1979 contest remained inconclusive because, no candidate having received the necessary 50% of the vote, Congress had to determine the president. The legislature would have likely picked Siles had it not been for the coup of 17 July 1980 which installed a reactionary (and cocaine-tainted) dictatorship led by General Luis García Meza. With the military&#x27;s reputation badly damaged by the excesses of the 1980–1982 dictatorship, it was decided to accept the 1980 election results and reconvene the Congress elected that year. That body duly elected Siles as president.

Banzer opposed bitterly the UDP government of Siles which lasted from 1982 to 1985, but turned more conciliatory when Víctor Paz Estenssoro was elected president (by congress, due to the virtual unattainability of the 50% necessary for direct election) in 1985. Indeed, Banzer&#x27;s party claimed authorship of some of the most prominent neoliberal economic reforms instituted by Paz to curb galloping hyperinflation, repress the influence of labor unions, and generally reduce government control of the economy. 

Banzer finished second in the 1989 elections closely behind the MNR&#x27;s Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada and ahead of the centre-left Revolutionary Left Movement&#x27;s Jaime Paz Zamora. Until the 1989 election Banzer and Paz Zamora had been staunch political enemies, but driven by a shared disdain for the MNR they came to a deal. Banzer and the ADN agreed to vote in congress for Paz Zamora to become president, in return for Paz Zamora&#x27;s promise to support Banzer in a future election.

At the 1993 election Banzer once again finished second to the MNR and Sánchez de Lozada. The MNRs plurality, in coalition with the small center-left Bolivia Libre party, made it possible to confirm the MNR&#x27;s electoral victory. In the 1997 elections, however, Banzer finished first by a small plurality, and was able to take the presidency with the support of Paz and others in a grand coalition ranging from Paz&#x27; Revolutionary Left Movement to Banzer&#x27;s ADN on the right.

==As constitutional president (1997–2001)==
In 1997, Banzer finally achieved democratic election as president of Bolivia, at the age of 71. He was the first former dictator in Latin America&#x27;s recent history to transition successfully to democratic politics and return to power by way of the ballot box. During his tenure he launched – under the guidelines outlined by the United States – a program to fight drug-trafficking in Bolivia which called for the eradication of coca, a controversial strategy. During his tenure a bitter divide developed within the ADN between Banzer and his vice president Jorge Quiroga. Banzer&#x27;s faction, known as the &quot;dinosaurios&quot;, comprised the party&#x27;s old guard and its members were less ideologically inclined, being mostly concerned with holding power and preserving Banzer&#x27;s historical reputation. In contrast, Quiroga&#x27;s &quot;pitufos&quot; faction was made up of technocratic free-market hardliners, and was far more willing to use force against protestors than the &quot;dinosaurios&quot; were. Relations between Banzer and Quiroga soon broke down, causing frequent chaos within the cabinet.

Banzer was the president during the Cochabamba Water War in 2000, which centered on the privatization of the water works of Bolivia&#x27;s third largest city, Cochabamba. In 1999, the World Bank discouraged water subsidies, writing &quot;... no subsidies should be given to ameliorate the increase in water tariffs in Cochabamba.&quot; However, that year, in Cochabomba, a water contract was awarded to Aguas del Tunari, a subsidiary of Bechtel (a U.S. company) and the only bidder, for $2.5 billion. According to a report from &quot;Historic.ly&quot;, &quot;The federal congress did this without consideration of the &quot;pueblo&quot; or the autonomy of the indigenous people who lived there.&quot; After one month of the contract, Bechtel raised the water rates over 60%. Local people could not collect rainwater either, as the rights to rainwater had also been given to the company. By January 2000, protests erupted in Bolivia in response to the privatization of water. Violence occurred when police and demonstrators clashed. Banzer then declared a &quot;state of siege&quot;. When officials of the consortium who had bought the right to run the water works fled after being told by the authorities that their safety could not be guaranteed, the Banzer government declared that they had abandoned the project in April 2000, declared the contract void, and settled with the demonstrators.

Banzer was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2001, and even though he had a year left of his five-year term (he had himself agitated to legally extend the presidential term), he resigned on 7 August. He was succeeded by Vice President Jorge Quiroga.

==Death==
Banzer died of lung cancer at a medical clinic in Santa Cruz de la Sierra on 5 May 2002, aged 75, five days before he would have turned 76 and around two months before his original presidential term ended. His remains were buried at the General Cemetery of Santa Cruz in Santa Cruz.

<text>The birds-of-paradise are members of the family Paradisaeidae of the order Passeriformes. The majority of species are found in eastern Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and eastern Australia. The family has 45 species in 17 genera. The members of this family are perhaps best known for the plumage of the males of the species, the majority of which are sexually dimorphic. The males of these species tend to have very long, elaborate feathers extending from the beak, wings, tail, or head. For the most part, they are confined to dense rainforest habitats. The diet of all species is dominated by fruit and to a lesser extent arthropods. The birds-of-paradise have a variety of breeding systems, ranging from monogamy to lek-type polygamy.

A number of species are threatened by hunting and habitat loss.

The family Paradisaeidae is introduced (as Paradiseidae) in 1825 with &quot;Paradisaea&quot; as the type genus by the English naturalist William Swainson. For many years the birds-of-paradise were treated as being closely related to the bowerbirds. Today while both are treated as being part of the Australasian lineage Corvida, the two are now thought to be only distantly related. The closest evolutionary relatives of the birds-of-paradise are the crow and jay family Corvidae, the monarch flycatchers Monarchidae, and the Australian mudnesters Struthideidae.

A 2009 study examining the mitochondrial DNA of all species to examine the relationships within the family and to its nearest relatives estimated that the family emerged 24 million years ago, earlier than previous estimates. The study identified five clades within the family, and placed the split between the first clade, which contains the monogamous manucodes and paradise-crow, and all the other birds-of-paradise, to be 10 million years ago. The second clade includes the parotias and the King of Saxony bird-of-paradise. The third clade provisionally contains several genera, including &quot;Seleucidis&quot;, the &quot;Drepanornis&quot; sicklebills, &quot;Semioptera&quot;, &quot;Ptiloris,&quot; and &quot;Lophorina&quot;, although some of these are questionable. The fourth clade includes the &quot;Epimachus&quot; sicklebills, &quot;Paradigalla,&quot; and the astrapias. The final clade includes the &quot;Cicinnurus&quot; and the &quot;Paradisaea&quot; birds-of-paradise.

The exact limits of the family have been the subject of revision as well. The three species of satinbird (the genera &quot;Cnemophilus&quot; and &quot;Loboparadisea&quot;) were treated as a subfamily of the birds-of-paradise, Cnemophilinae. In spite of differences in the mouth, foot morphology, and nesting habits they remained in the family until a 2000 study moved them to a separate family closer to the berrypeckers and longbills (Melanocharitidae). The same study found that the Macgregor&#x27;s bird-of-paradise was actually a member of the large Australasian honeyeater family. In addition to these three species, a number of systematically enigmatic species and genera have been considered potential members of this family. The two species in the genus &quot;Melampitta&quot;, also from New Guinea, have been linked with the birds-of-paradise, but their relationships remain uncertain, more recently being linked with the Australian mudnesters. The silktail of Fiji has been linked with the birds-of-paradise many times since its discovery, but never formally assigned to the family. Recent molecular evidence now places the species with the fantails.

===Hybrids===

Hybrid birds-of-paradise may occur when individuals of different species, that look similar and have overlapping ranges, confuse each other for their own species and crossbreed.

When Erwin Stresemann realised that hybridisation among birds-of-paradise might be an explanation as to why so many of the described species were so rare, he examined many controversial specimens and, during the 1920s and 1930s, published several papers on his hypothesis. Many of the species described in the late 19th and early 20th centuries are now generally considered to be hybrids, though some are still subject to dispute; their status is not likely to be settled definitely without genetic examination of museum specimens, which will come soon in summer 2021 in North America, South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, and Australia, and some birds in an aviary in Central Park Zoo.

==Description==

Birds-of-paradise are closely related to the corvids. Birds-of-paradise range in size from the king bird-of-paradise at and to the curl-crested manucode at and . The male black sicklebill, with its long tail, is the longest species at . In most species, the tails of the males are larger and longer than those of the females, the differences ranging from slight to extreme. The wings are rounded and, in some species, structurally modified on the males in order to make sound. There is considerable variation in the family with regard to bill shape. Bills may be long and decurved, as in the sicklebills and riflebirds, or small and slim like the Astrapias. As with body size, bill size varies between the sexes, although species where the females have larger bills than the males are more common, particularly in the insect-eating species.

Plumage variation between the sexes is closely related to the breeding system. The manucodes and paradise-crow, which are socially monogamous, are sexually monomorphic. So are the two species of &quot;Paradigalla&quot;, which are polygamous. All these species have generally black plumage with varying amounts of green and blue iridescence. The female plumage of the dimorphic species is typically drab to blend in with their habitat, unlike the bright attractive colours found on the males. Younger males of these species have female-like plumage, and sexual maturity takes a long time, with the full adult plumage not being obtained for up to seven years. This affords the younger males protection from predators of more subdued colours and also reduces hostility from adult males.

==Distribution and habitat==
The centre of bird-of-paradise diversity is the large island of New Guinea; all but two genera are found in New Guinea. Those other two are the monotypic genera &quot;Lycocorax&quot; and &quot;Semioptera&quot;, both of which are endemic to the Maluku Islands, to the west of New Guinea. Of the riflebirds in the genus &quot;Ptiloris&quot;, two are endemic to the coastal forests of eastern Australia, one occurs in both Australia and New Guinea, and one is only found in New Guinea. The only other genus to have a species outside New Guinea is &quot;Phonygammus&quot;, one representative of which is found in the extreme north of Queensland. The remaining species are restricted to New Guinea and some of the surrounding islands. Many species have very small ranges, particularly those with restricted habitat types such as mid-montane forest (like the black sicklebill) or island endemics (like the Wilson&#x27;s bird-of-paradise).

The majority of birds-of-paradise live in tropical forests, including rainforests, swamps, and moss forests, nearly all of them solitary tree dwellers. Several species have been recorded in coastal mangroves. The southernmost species, the paradise riflebird of Australia, lives in sub-tropical and temperate wet forests. As a group the manucodes are the most plastic in their habitat requirements; in particular, the glossy-mantled manucode, which inhabits both forest and open savanna woodland. Mid-montane habitats are the most commonly occupied habitat, with thirty of the forty species occurring in the altitudinal band.

==Behaviour and ecology==

===Diet and feeding===

The diet of the birds-of-paradise is dominated by fruit and arthropods, although small amounts of nectar and small vertebrates may also be taken. The ratio of the two food types varies by species, with fruit predominating in some species, and arthropods dominating the diet in others. The ratio of the two will affect other aspects of the behaviour of the species; for example, frugivorous species tend to feed in the forest canopy, whereas insectivores may feed lower down in the middle storey. Frugivores are more social than the insectivores, which are more solitary and territorial.

Even the birds-of-paradise that are primarily insect eaters will still take large amounts of fruit. The family is overall an important seed disperser for the forests of New Guinea, as they do not digest the seeds. Species that feed on fruit will range widely searching for fruit, and while they may join other fruit-eating species at a fruiting tree, they will not associate with them otherwise and will not stay with other species for long. Fruit is eaten while perched and not in the air, and birds-of-paradise are able to use their feet as tools to manipulate and hold their food, allowing them to extract certain capsular fruit. There is some niche differentiation in fruit choice by species and any one species will only consume a limited number of fruit types compared to the large choice available. For example, the trumpet manucode and crinkle-collared manucode will eat mostly figs, whereas the Lawes&#x27;s parotia focuses mostly on berries and the greater lophorina and raggiana bird-of-paradise take mostly capsular fruit.

===Breeding===

Most species have elaborate mating rituals, with at least eight species exhibiting lek mating systems, including the genus &quot;Paradisaea&quot;. Others, such as the &quot;Cicinnurus&quot; and &quot;Parotia&quot; species, have highly ritualised mating dances. Across the family (Paradisaeidae), female preference is incredibly important in shaping the courtship behaviors of males and, in fact, drives the evolution of ornamental combinations of sound, color, and behavior. Males are polygamous in the sexually dimorphic species, but monogamous in at least some of the monomorphic species. Hybridisation is frequent in these birds, suggesting the polygamous species of bird of paradise are very closely related despite being in different genera. Many hybrids have been described as new species in the past, and doubt remains regarding whether some forms, such as Rothschild&#x27;s lobe-billed bird-of-paradise, are valid.

Birds-of-paradise build their nests from soft materials, such as leaves, ferns, and vine tendrils, typically placed in a tree fork. The typical number of eggs in each clutch varies among the species and is not known for every species. For larger species, it is almost always just one egg, but smaller species may produce clutches of 2–3 eggs. Eggs hatch after 16–22 days, and the young leave the nest at between 16 and 30 days of age.

==Relationship with humans==

Societies of New Guinea often use bird-of-paradise plumes in their dress and rituals, and the plumes were popular in Europe in past centuries as adornment for ladies&#x27; millinery. Hunting for plumes and habitat destruction have reduced some species to endangered status; habitat destruction due to deforestation is now the predominant threat.

Best known are the members of the genus &quot;Paradisaea&quot;, including the type species, the greater bird-of-paradise, &quot;Paradisaea apoda&quot;. This species was described from specimens brought back to Europe from trading expeditions in the early sixteenth century. These specimens had been prepared by native traders by removing their wings and feet so that they could be used as decorations. This was not known to the explorers, and in the absence of information, many beliefs arose about them. They were briefly thought to be the mythical phoenix. The often footless and wingless condition of the skins led to the belief that the birds never landed but were kept permanently aloft by their plumes. The first Europeans to encounter their skins were the voyagers in Ferdinand Magellan&#x27;s circumnavigation of the Earth. Antonio Pigafetta wrote that &quot;The people told us that those birds came from the terrestrial paradise, and they call them bolon diuata, that is to say, &#x27;birds of God&#x27;.&quot; This is the origin of both the name &quot;bird of paradise&quot; and the specific name &quot;apoda&quot; – without feet. An alternate account by Maximilianus Transylvanus used the term Mamuco Diata, a variant of Manucodiata, which was used as a synonym for birds-of-paradise up to the 19th century.

===Birdwatching===
In recent years the availability of pictures and videos about birds of paradise on the internet has raised the interest of birdwatchers around the world. Many of them fly to West Papua to watch various species of birds of paradise from Wilson&#x27;s Bird of Paradise (&quot;Diphyllodes respublica&quot;) and Red Bird of Paradise (Paradisaea rubra) in Raja Ampat to Lesser Birds of Paradise (&quot;Paradisaea minor&quot;), Magnificent Riflebird (&quot;Ptiloris magnificus&quot;), King Bird of Paradise (&quot;Cicinnurus regius&quot;), crescent-caped lophorina (&quot;Lophorina niedda&quot;), and Magnificent Bird of Paradise (&quot;Diphyllodes magnificus&quot;) in Susnguakti forest.

This activity significantly reduces the number of local villagers who are involved in the hunting of paradise birds.

===Hunting===
Hunting of birds of paradise has occurred for a long time, possibly since the beginning of human settlement. It is a peculiarity that among the most frequently hunted species, males start mating opportunistically even before they grow their ornamental plumage. This may be an adaptation to maintaining population levels in the face of hunting pressures, which have probably been present for hundreds of years.

The naturalist, explorer, and author Alfred Russel Wallace spent six years in the region, which he chronicled in &quot;The Malay Archipelago&quot; (published in 1869). His expedition team shot, collected, and described many specimens of animals and birds, including the great, king, twelve-wired, superb, red, and six-shafted birds of paradise.

Hunting to provide plumes for the millinery trade was extensive in the late 19th and early 20th century, but today the birds have legal protection except for hunting at a sustainable level to fulfill the ceremonial needs of the local tribal population. In the case of &quot;Pteridophora&quot; plumes, scavenging from old bowerbird bowers is encouraged.

<text>The two-source hypothesis (or 2SH) is an explanation for the synoptic problem, the pattern of similarities and differences between the three Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. It posits that the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke were based on the Gospel of Mark and a hypothetical sayings collection from the Christian oral tradition called Q.

The two-source hypothesis emerged in the 19th century. B. H. Streeter definitively stated the case in 1924, adding that two other sources, referred to as M and L, lie behind the material in Matthew and Luke respectively. The strengths of the hypothesis are its explanatory power regarding the shared and non-shared material in the three gospels; its weaknesses lie in the exceptions to those patterns, and in the hypothetical nature of its proposed collection of Jesus-sayings. Later scholars have advanced numerous elaborations and variations on the basic hypothesis, and even completely alternative hypotheses. Nevertheless, &quot;the 2SH commands the support of most biblical critics from all continents and denominations.&quot;

When Streeter&#x27;s two additional sources, M and L, are taken into account, this hypothesis is sometimes referred to as the four-document hypothesis.

== History ==

The two-source hypothesis was first articulated in 1838 by Christian Hermann Weisse, but it did not gain wide acceptance among German critics until Heinrich Julius Holtzmann endorsed it in 1863. Prior to Holtzmann, most Catholic scholars held to the Augustinian hypothesis (Matthew → Mark → Luke) and Protestant biblical critics favored the Griesbach hypothesis (Matthew → Luke → Mark). The Two-Source Hypothesis crossed the channel into England in the 1880s primarily due to the efforts of William Sanday, culminating in B. H. Streeter&#x27;s definitive statement of the case in 1924. Streeter further argued that additional sources, referred to as M and L, lie behind the material in Matthew and Luke respectively.

== Background: the synoptic problem ==

The hypothesis is a solution to what is known as the synoptic problem: the question of how best to account for the differences and similarities between the three synoptic gospels, Matthew, Mark and Luke. The answer to this problem has implications for the order in which the three were composed, and the sources on which their authors drew.

Any solution to the synoptic problem needs to account for two features:
*The &quot;triple tradition&quot;: The three gospels frequently share both wording and arrangement of &quot;pericopes&quot; (incidents, stories - this substantial sharing is what led to them being called &quot;synoptic&quot;, or seeing-together). Where they differ on this shared material, Mark and Luke will agree against Matthew, or Mark and Matthew will agree against Luke, but very rarely will Mark be the odd one out. Matthew&#x27;s and Luke&#x27;s versions of shared pericopes will usually be shorter than Mark&#x27;s.
*The &quot;double tradition&quot;: Sometimes Matthew and Luke share material which is not present in Mark. In these cases Matthew and Luke sometimes parallel each other closely, but at other times are widely divergent.

== Overview of the hypothesis ==

The 2SH attempts to solve the synoptic problem by advancing two propositions, Marcan priority to explain the triple tradition, and the existence of a lost Q document to solve the double tradition. In summary, the two-source hypothesis proposes that Matthew and Luke used Mark for its narrative material as well as for the basic structural outline of chronology of Jesus&#x27; life; and that Matthew and Luke use a second source, Q (from German Quelle, &quot;source&quot;), not extant, for the sayings (logia) found in both of them but not in Mark.

=== Marcan priority ===

The 2SH explains the features of the triple tradition by proposing that both Matthew and Luke used Mark as a source. Mark appears more &#x27;primitive&#x27;: his diction and grammar are less literary than Matthew and Luke, his language is more prone to redundancy and obscurity, his Christology is less supernatural, and he makes more frequent use of Aramaic. The more sophisticated versions of Mark&#x27;s pericopes in Matthew and Luke must be either the result of those two &quot;cleaning up&quot; Mark, if his is the first gospel, or of Mark &quot;dumbing down&quot; Matthew and/or Luke, if he was later. Critics regard the first explanation as the more likely. On a more specific level, Marcan priority seems to be indicated due to instances where Matthew and Luke apparently omit explanatory material from Mark, where Matthew adds his own theological emphases to Mark&#x27;s stories, and in the uneven distribution of Mark&#x27;s stylistic features in Matthew.

=== The existence of Q ===

The 2SH explains the double tradition by postulating the existence of a lost &quot;sayings of Jesus&quot; document known as Q, from the German &quot;Quelle&quot;, &quot;source&quot;. It is this, rather than Marcan priority, which forms the distinctive feature of the 2SH as against rival theories. The existence of Q follows from the conclusion that, as Luke and Matthew are independent of Mark in the double tradition, the connection between them must be explained by their joint but independent use of a missing source or sources. (That they used Q independently of each other follows from the fact that they frequently differ quite widely in their use of this source).

== Problems with the hypothesis ==
While the 2SH remains the most popular explanation for the origins of the synoptic gospels, two questions - the existence of the so-called &quot;minor agreements,&quot; and problems with the hypothesis of Q - continue at the centre of discussion over its explanatory power.

=== The minor agreements ===

The &quot;minor agreements&quot;—the word &quot;minor&quot; here is not intended to be belittling—are those points where Matthew and Luke agree against Mark (for example, the mocking question at the beating of Jesus, &quot;Who is it that struck you?&quot;, found in both Matthew and Luke but not in Mark). The &quot;minor agreements&quot; thus call into question the proposition that Matthew and Luke knew Mark but not each other. Streeter devoted a chapter to the matter, arguing that the Matthew/Luke agreements were due to coincidence, or to the result of the two authors&#x27; reworking of Mark into more refined Greek, or to overlaps with Q or oral tradition, or to textual corruption.

A few later scholars explain the minor agreements as being due to Luke&#x27;s using Matthew in addition to Q and Mark (3SH). But the modern argument for Q requires Matthew and Luke to be independent, so the 3SH raises the question of how to establish a role for Q if Luke is dependent on Matthew. Accordingly, some scholars (like Helmut Koester) who wish to keep Q while acknowledging the force of the minor agreements attribute them to a proto-Mark, such as the Ur-Markus in the Marcan Hypothesis (MkH), adapted by Mark independently from its use by Matthew and Luke. Still other scholars feel that the minor agreements are due to a revision of the Mark found in the Bible, called deutero-Mark. In this case, both Matthew and Luke are dependent on proto-Mark, which did not survive the ages.

&quot;Therefore, the minor agreements, if taken seriously, force a choice between accepting pure Marcan priority on one hand or the existence of Q on the other hand, but not both simultaneously as the 2SH requires.&quot;

=== Problems with Q ===

A principal objection to the 2SH is that it requires a hypothetical document, Q, the existence of which is not attested in any way, either by existing fragments (and a great many fragments of early Christian documents do exist) or by early Church tradition. The minor agreements are also, according to the critics, evidence of the non-existence of, or rather the non-necessity for, Q: if Matthew and Luke have passages which are missing in Mark (the &quot;Who is it that struck you?&quot; sentence quoted above is a famous example), this demonstrates only that Matthew is quoting Luke or vice versa.

Two additional problems are noteworthy, the &quot;problem of fatigue&quot; and the Q narrative problem. The first relates to the phenomenon that a scribe, when copying a text, will tend to converge on his source out of simple fatigue. Thus Mark calls Herod by the incorrect title &quot;basileus&quot;, &quot;king&quot;, throughout, while Matthew begins with the more correct &quot;tetrarches&quot; but eventually switches to &quot;basileus&quot;. When similar changes occur in double tradition material, which according to the 2SH are the result of Matthew and Luke relying on Q, they usually show Luke converging on Matthew.

Pierson Parker in 1940 suggested that the non-canonical Gospel of the Hebrews was the second source used in the Gospel of Luke. This view is yet to gain influence.

==Variants==

The two-document hypothesis emerged in the 19th century: Mark as the earliest gospel, Matthew and Luke written independently and reliant on both Mark and the hypothetical Q.
In 1924 B. H. Streeter refined the &quot;two-document hypothesis&quot; into the &quot;four-document hypothesis&quot; based on the possibility of a Jewish M source (see the Gospel according to the Hebrews).

While the standard two-source theory holds Mark and Q to be independent, some argue that Q was also a source for Mark. This is sometimes called the &quot;Modified two-document hypothesis&quot; (although that term was also used in older literature to refer to the Four-document hypothesis).

A number of scholars have suggested a Three-source hypothesis, that Luke actually did make some use of Matthew after all. This allows much more flexibility in the reconstruction of Q.

Dunn proposes an &quot;Oral Q&quot; hypothesis, in which Q is not a document but a body of oral teachings.

==Other hypotheses==
Some form of the Two Source hypothesis continues to be preferred by a majority of New Testament scholars as the theory that is best able to resolve the synoptic problem. Nevertheless, doubts about the problems of the minor agreements and, especially, the hypothetical Q, have produced alternative hypotheses.

In 1955 a British scholar, A. M. Farrer, proposed that one could dispense with Q by arguing that Luke revised both Mark and Matthew. In 1965 an American scholar, William R. Farmer, also seeking to do away with the need for Q, revived an updated version of Griesbach&#x27;s idea that Mark condensed both Matthew and Luke. In Britain, the most influential modern opponents of the 2SH favor the Farrer hypothesis, while Farmer&#x27;s revised Griesbach hypothesis, also known as the Two Gospel hypothesis, is probably the chief rival to the Two Source hypothesis in America.

In 1838, the German theologian Christian Gottlob Wilke argued for a solution that combined Marcan priority with an extensively developed argument for Matthew&#x27;s direct dependence upon both Mark and Luke. Thus, like Farrer, Wilke&#x27;s hypothesis has no need for Q, but it simply reverses the direction of presumed dependence between Matthew and Luke proposed by Farrer. A few other German scholars supported Wilke&#x27;s hypothesis in the nineteenth century, but in time most came to accept the two-source hypothesis, which remains the dominant theory to this day. The Wilke hypothesis was accepted by Karl Kautsky in his Foundations of Christianity and has begun to receive new attention in recent decades since its revival in 1992 by Huggins, then Hengel, then independently by Blair. Additional recent supporters include Garrow and Powell.

The traditional view is represented by the Augustinian hypothesis, which is that the four gospels were written in the order in which they appear in the bible (Matthew → Mark → Luke), with Mark a condensed edition of Matthew. This hypothesis was based on the claim by the 2nd century AD bishop Papias that he had heard that Matthew wrote first. By the 18th century the problems with Augustine&#x27;s idea led Johann Jakob Griesbach to put forward the Griesbach hypothesis, which was that Luke had revised Matthew and that Mark had then written a shorter gospel using material on which both Matthew and Luke agreed (Matthew → Luke → Mark).

A variant of the Augustinian hypothesis, attempting to synchronise Matthew and Mark on the basis of the Mosaic &quot;two witnesses&quot; requirement of Deuteronomy 19:15 (Matthew + Mark → Luke), was proposed by Eta Linnemann, following rejection of the view of her teacher Rudolf Bultmann.

<doc id="162549" wikidata="Q2087968" url="?curid=162549" title="MacOS version history">
<text>The history of [[macOS]], Apple&#x27;s current Mac operating system formerly named Mac OS X until 2011 and then OS X until 2016, began with the company&#x27;s project to replace its &quot;classic&quot; Mac OS. That system, up to and including its final release Mac OS 9, was a direct descendant of the operating system Apple had used in its Mac computers since their introduction in 1984. However, the current macOS is a UNIX operating system built on technology that had been developed at NeXT from the 1980s until Apple purchased the company in early 1997.

macOS components derived from BSD include multiuser access, TCP/IP networking, and memory protection.

Although it was originally marketed as simply &quot;version 10&quot; of Mac OS (indicated by the Roman numeral &quot;X&quot;), it has a completely different codebase from Mac OS 9, as well as substantial changes to its user interface. The transition was a technologically and strategically significant one. To ease the transition for users and developers, versions 10.0 through 10.4 were able to run Mac OS 9 and its applications in the Classic Environment, a compatibility layer.

macOS was first released in 1999 as Mac OS X Server 1.0. It was built using the technologies Apple acquired from NeXT, but did not include the signature Aqua user interface (UI). The desktop version aimed at regular users—Mac OS X 10.0—shipped in March 2001. Since then, several more distinct desktop and server editions of macOS have been released. Starting with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, macOS Server is no longer offered as a standalone operating system; instead, server management tools are available for purchase as an add-on. The macOS Server app was discontinued on April 21, 2022, and will stop working on macOS 13 Ventura or later. Starting with the Intel build of Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, most releases have been certified as Unix systems conforming to the Single UNIX Specification.

Lion was referred to by Apple as &quot;Mac OS X Lion&quot; and sometimes as &quot;OS X Lion&quot;; Mountain Lion was officially referred to as just &quot;OS X Mountain Lion&quot;, with the &quot;Mac&quot; being completely dropped. The operating system was further renamed to &quot;macOS&quot; starting with macOS Sierra.

macOS retained the major version number 10 throughout its development history until the release of macOS 11 Big Sur in 2020.

Mac OS X 10.0 and 10.1 were given names of big cats as internal code names (&quot;Cheetah&quot; and &quot;Puma&quot;). Starting with Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar, big-cat names were used as marketing names; starting with OS X 10.9 Mavericks, names of locations in California were used as marketing names instead.

The current major version, macOS 15 Sequoia, was announced on June 10, 2024, at WWDC 2024 and released on September 16 of that year.

==Development==

===Development outside Apple===

After Apple removed Steve Jobs from management in 1985, he left the company and attempted to create the &quot;next big thing&quot;, with funding from Ross Perot and himself. The result was the NeXT Computer. As the first workstation to include a digital signal processor (DSP) and a high-capacity optical disc drive, NeXT hardware was advanced for its time, but was expensive relative to the rapidly commoditizing workstation market. The hardware was phased out in 1993; however, the company&#x27;s object-oriented operating system NeXTSTEP had a more lasting legacy as it eventually became the basis for Mac OS X.

NeXTSTEP was based on the Mach kernel developed at CMU (Carnegie Mellon University) and BSD, an implementation of Unix dating back to the 1970s. It featured an object-oriented programming framework based on the Objective-C language. This environment is known today in the Mac world as Cocoa. It also supported the innovative Enterprise Objects Framework database access layer and WebObjects application server development environment, among other notable features.

All but abandoning the idea of an operating system, NeXT managed to maintain a business selling WebObjects and consulting services, only ever making modest profits in its last few quarters as an independent company. NeXTSTEP underwent an evolution into OPENSTEP which separated the object layers from the operating system below, allowing it to run with less modification on other platforms. OPENSTEP was, for a short time, adopted by Sun and HP.

However, by this point, a number of other companies — notably Apple, IBM, Microsoft, and even Sun itself — were claiming they would soon be releasing similar object-oriented operating systems and development tools of their own. Some of these efforts, such as Taligent, did not fully come to fruition; others, like Java, gained widespread adoption.

On February 4, 1997, Apple Computer acquired NeXT for $427 million, and used OPENSTEP as the basis for Mac OS X, as it was called at the time. Traces of the NeXT software heritage can still be seen in macOS. For example, in the Cocoa development environment, the Objective-C library classes have &quot;NS&quot; prefixes, and the HISTORY section of the manual page for the codice_1 command in macOS straightforwardly states that the command &quot;First appeared in NeXTStep.&quot;

===Internal development===
Meanwhile, Apple was facing commercial difficulties of its own. The decade-old Macintosh System Software had reached the limits of its single-user, co-operative multitasking architecture, and its once-innovative user interface was looking increasingly outdated. A massive development effort to replace it, known as Copland, was started in 1994, but was generally perceived outside Apple to be a hopeless case due to political infighting and conflicting goals. By 1996, Copland was nowhere near ready for release, and the project was eventually cancelled. Some elements of Copland were incorporated into Mac OS 8, released on July 26, 1997.

After considering the purchase of BeOS — a multimedia-enabled, multi-tasking OS designed for hardware similar to Apple&#x27;s, the company decided instead to acquire NeXT and use OPENSTEP as the basis for their new OS. Avie Tevanian took over OS development, and Steve Jobs was brought on as a consultant. At first, the plan was to develop a new operating system based almost entirely on an updated version of OPENSTEP, with the addition of a virtual machine subsystem — known as the &quot;Blue Box&quot; — for running &quot;classic&quot; Macintosh applications. The result was known by the code name Rhapsody, slated for release in late 1998.

Apple expected that developers would port their software to the considerably more powerful OPENSTEP libraries once they learned of its power and flexibility. Instead, several major developers such as Adobe told Apple that this would never occur, and that they would rather leave the platform entirely. This &quot;rejection&quot; of Apple&#x27;s plan was largely the result of a string of previous broken promises from Apple; after watching one &quot;next OS&quot; after another disappear and Apple&#x27;s market share dwindle, developers were not interested in doing much work on the platform at all, let alone a re-write.

===Changed direction under Jobs===
Apple&#x27;s financial losses continued and the board of directors lost confidence in CEO Gil Amelio, asking him to resign. The board asked Steve Jobs to lead the company on an interim basis, essentially giving him &quot;&quot; to make changes to return the company to profitability. When Jobs announced at the World Wide Developer&#x27;s Conference that what developers really wanted was a modern version of the Mac OS, and Apple was going to deliver it, he was met with applause.

Over the next two years, a major effort was applied to porting the original Macintosh API to Unix libraries known as &quot;Carbon&quot;. Mac OS applications could be ported to Carbon without the need for a complete re-write, making them operate as native applications on the new operating system. Meanwhile, applications written using the older toolkits would be supported using the &quot;Classic&quot; Mac OS 9 environment. Support for C, C++, Objective-C, Java, and Python were added, furthering developer comfort with the new platform.

During this time, the lower layers of the operating system (the Mach kernel and the BSD layers on top of it) were re-packaged and released under the Apple Public Source License. They became known as Darwin. The Darwin kernel provides a stable and flexible operating system, which takes advantage of the contributions of programmers and independent open-source projects outside Apple; however, it sees little use outside the Macintosh community.

During this period, the Java programming language had increased in popularity, and an effort was started to improve Mac Java support. This consisted of porting a high-speed Java virtual machine to the platform, and exposing macOS-specific &quot;Cocoa&quot; APIs to the Java language.

The first release of the new OS — Mac OS X Server 1.0 — used a modified version of the Mac OS GUI, but all client versions starting with Mac OS X Developer Preview 3 used a new theme known as Aqua. Aqua was a substantial departure from the Mac OS 9 interface, which had evolved with little change from that of the original Macintosh operating system: it incorporated full color scalable graphics, anti-aliasing of text and graphics, simulated shading and highlights, transparency and shadows, and animation. A new feature was the Dock, an application launcher which took advantage of these capabilities.

Despite this, Mac OS X maintained a substantial degree of consistency with the traditional Mac OS interface and Apple&#x27;s own Apple Human Interface Guidelines, with its pull-down menu at the top of the screen, familiar keyboard shortcuts, and support for a single-button mouse. The development of Aqua was delayed somewhat by the switch from OpenStep&#x27;s Display PostScript engine to one developed in-house that was free of any license restrictions, known as Quartz.

==Releases==
With the exception of Mac OS X Server 1.0 and the original public beta, the first several macOS versions were named after big cats. Prior to its release, version 10.0 was code named &quot;Cheetah&quot; internally at Apple, and version 10.1 was code named internally as &quot;Puma&quot;.

After the code name &quot;Jaguar&quot; for version 10.2 received publicity in the media, Apple began openly using the names to promote the operating system: 10.3 was marketed as &quot;Panther&quot;, 10.4 as &quot;Tiger&quot;, 10.5 as &quot;Leopard&quot;, 10.6 as &quot;Snow Leopard&quot;, 10.7 as &quot;Lion&quot;, and 10.8 as &quot;Mountain Lion&quot;. &quot;Panther&quot;, &quot;Tiger&quot;, and &quot;Leopard&quot; were registered as trademarks.

Apple registered &quot;Lynx&quot; and &quot;Cougar&quot;, but these were allowed to lapse. Apple started using the name of locations in California for subsequent releases: 10.9 Mavericks was named after Mavericks, a popular surfing destination; 10.10 Yosemite was named after Yosemite National Park; 10.11 El Capitan was named for the El Capitan rock formation in Yosemite National Park; 10.12 Sierra was named for the Sierra Nevada mountain range; and 10.13 High Sierra was named for the area around the High Sierra Camps.

In 2016, OS X was renamed to macOS. A few years later, in 2020, with the release of macOS Big Sur, the first component of the version number was incremented from 10 to 11, so Big Sur&#x27;s initial release&#x27;s version number was 11.0 instead of 10.16, making the version numbers of macOS behave the way the version numbers of Apple&#x27;s other operating systems do. All subsequent major releases also increased the first component of the version number.

===Mac OS X Public Beta===

On September 13, 2000, Apple released a $29.95 &quot;preview&quot; version of Mac OS X (internally codenamed Kodiak) in order to gain feedback from users. It marked the first public availability of the Aqua interface, and Apple made many changes to the UI based on customer feedback. Mac OS X Public Beta expired and ceased to function in spring 2001.

===Mac OS X 10.0 &quot;Cheetah&quot;===
On March 24, 2001, Apple released Mac OS X 10.0 (internally codenamed Cheetah).
The initial version was slow, incomplete, and had very few applications available at the time of its launch, mostly from independent developers. Critics suggested that the operating system was not ready for mainstream adoption, but they recognized the importance of its initial launch as a base to improve upon. Simply releasing Mac OS X was received by the Macintosh community as a great accomplishment, for attempts to completely overhaul the Mac OS had been underway since 1996, and delayed by countless setbacks. Following some bug fixes, kernel panics became much less frequent.

===Mac OS X 10.1 &quot;Puma&quot;===
Mac OS X 10.1 (internally codenamed &quot;Puma&quot;) was released on September 25, 2001.
It has better performance and provided missing features, such as DVD playback. Apple released 10.1 as a free upgrade CD for 10.0 users. Apple released a upgrade CD for Mac OS 9.

On January 7, 2002, Apple announced that Mac OS X was to be the default operating system for all Macintosh products by the end of that month.

=== Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar ===
On August 23, 2002,
Apple followed up with Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar, the first release to use its code name as part of the branding.
It brought great raw performance improvements, a sleeker look, and many powerful user-interface enhancements (over 150, according to Apple
), including Quartz Extreme for compositing graphics directly on an ATI Radeon or Nvidia GeForce2 MX AGP-based video card with at least 16 MB of VRAM, a system-wide repository for contact information in the new Address Book, and an instant messaging client named iChat.
The Happy Mac which had appeared during the Mac OS startup sequence for almost 18 years was replaced with a large grey Apple logo with the introduction of Mac OS X 10.2.

=== Mac OS X 10.3 Panther ===
Mac OS X Panther was released on October 24, 2003. In addition to providing much improved performance, it also incorporated the most extensive update yet to the user interface. Panther included as many or more new features as Jaguar had the year before, including an updated Finder, incorporating a brushed-metal interface, Fast user switching, Exposé (Window manager), FileVault, Safari, iChat AV (which added videoconferencing features to iChat), improved Portable Document Format (PDF) rendering and much greater Microsoft Windows interoperability.
Support for some early G3 computers such as the Power Macintosh and PowerBook was discontinued.

=== Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger ===
Mac OS X Tiger was released on April 29, 2005. Apple stated that Tiger contained more than 200 new features.
As with Panther, certain older machines were no longer supported; Tiger requires a Mac with a built-in FireWire port.
Among the new features, Tiger introduced Spotlight, Dashboard, Smart Folders, updated Mail program with Smart Mailboxes, QuickTime 7, Safari 2, Automator, VoiceOver, Core Image and Core Video. The initial release of the Apple TV used a modified version of Tiger with a different graphical interface and fewer applications and services.

On January 10, 2006, Apple released the first Intel x86-based Macs along with the 10.4.4 update to Tiger. This operating system functioned identically on the PowerPC-based Macs and the new Intel-based machines, with the exception of the Intel release dropping support for the Classic environment. 10.4.4 introduced Rosetta, which translated 32-bit PowerPC machine code to 32-bit x86 code, allowing applications for PowerPC to run on Intel-based Macs without modification.
Only PowerPC Macs can be booted from retail copies of the Tiger client DVD, but there is a Universal DVD of Tiger Server 10.4.7 (8K1079) that can boot both PowerPC and Intel Macs.

=== Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard ===
Mac OS X Leopard was released on October 26, 2007. Apple called it &quot;the largest update of Mac OS X&quot;. Leopard supports both PowerPC- and Intel x86-based Macintosh computers; support for Macs with the G3 processor was dropped, and Macs with the G4 processor required a minimum clock rate of 867 MHz and at least 512 MB of RAM to be installed. The single DVD works for all supported Macs (including 64-bit machines). New features include a new look, an updated Finder, Time Machine, Spaces, Boot Camp pre-installed, full support for 64-bit applications (including graphical applications), new features in Mail and iChat, and a number of new security features.

Leopard is an Open Brand UNIX 03 registered product on the Intel platform. It was also the first BSD-based OS to receive UNIX 03 certification. Leopard dropped support for the Classic Environment and all Classic applications, and was the final version of Mac OS X to support the PowerPC architecture.

=== Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard ===
Mac OS X Snow Leopard was released on August 28, 2009, the last version to be available on disc. Rather than delivering big changes to the appearance and end user functionality like the previous releases of , the development of Snow Leopard was deliberately focused on &quot;under the hood&quot; changes, increasing the performance, efficiency, and stability of the operating system. For most users, the most noticeable changes were a difference in the disk space that the operating system frees up after a clean installation when compared to Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, a more responsive Finder rewritten in Cocoa, faster Time Machine backups, more reliable and user friendly disk ejects, a more powerful version of the Preview application, and a faster Safari web browser.

An update also introduced support for the Mac App Store, Apple&#x27;s digital distribution platform for macOS applications and subsequent macOS upgrades. Snow Leopard only supports Macs with Intel CPUs, requires at least 1 GB of RAM, and drops default support for applications built for the PowerPC architecture. However, Rosetta can be installed as an additional component to retain support for PowerPC-only applications.

=== Mac OS X 10.7 Lion ===
Mac OS X Lion (also known as OS X Lion) was released on July 20, 2011. It brought developments made in Apple&#x27;s iOS, such as an easily navigable display of installed applications (Launchpad) and (a greater use of) multi-touch gestures, to the Mac. This release removed Rosetta, making it incapable of running PowerPC applications. It dropped support for 32-bit Intel processors and requires 2 GB of memory. Changes made to the graphical user interface (GUI) include the Launchpad (similar to the home screen of iOS and iPadOS devices), auto-hiding scrollbars that only appear when they are being used, and Mission Control, which unifies Exposé, Spaces, Dashboard, and full-screen applications within a single interface.
Apple also made changes to applications: they resume in the same state as they were before they were closed (similar to iOS). Documents auto-save by default.

=== OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion ===
OS X Mountain Lion was released on July 25, 2012. It incorporates some features seen in iOS 5, which include Game Center, support for iMessage in the new Messages messaging application, and Reminders as a to-do list app separate from iCal (which is renamed as Calendar, like the iOS app). It also includes support for storing iWork documents in iCloud. 2 GB of memory is required. Application pop-ups are now concentrated on the corner of the screen, and the Center itself is pulled from the right side of the screen. Mountain Lion also includes more Chinese features, including support for Baidu as an option for Safari search engine. Notification Center is added, providing an overview of alerts from applications. It is a desktop version similar to the one in iOS 5.0 and higher. Notes is added, as an application separate from Mail, synching with its iOS counterpart through the iCloud service. Messages, an instant messaging software application, replaces iChat.

=== OS X 10.9 Mavericks ===
OS X Mavericks was released on October 22, 2013, as a free update through the Mac App Store worldwide.
It placed emphasis on battery life, Finder enhancements, other enhancements for power users, and continued iCloud integration, as well as bringing more of Apple&#x27;s iOS apps to the OS X platform. iBooks and Apple Maps applications were added. Mavericks requires 2 GB of memory to operate. It is the first version named under Apple&#x27;s then-new theme of places in California, dubbed &quot;Mavericks&quot; after the surfing location. Unlike previous versions of OS X, which had progressively decreasing prices since 10.6, 10.9 was available at no charge to all users of compatible systems running Snow Leopard (10.6) or later, beginning Apple&#x27;s policy of free upgrades for life on its operating system and business software.

===OS X 10.10 Yosemite===
OS X Yosemite was released to the general public on October 16, 2014, as a free update through the Mac App Store worldwide. It featured a major overhaul of user interface, replaced skeuomorphism with flat graphic design and blurred translucency effects, following the aesthetic introduced with iOS 7. It introduced features called Continuity and Handoff, which allow for tighter integration between paired OS X and iOS devices: the user can handle phone calls or text messages on either their Mac or their iPhone, and edit the same Pages document on either their Mac or their iPad. A later update of the OS included Photos as a replacement for iPhoto and Aperture.

=== OS X 10.11 El Capitan ===
OS X El Capitan was revealed on June 8, 2015, during the WWDC 2015 keynote speech. It was made available as a public beta in July and was made available publicly on September 30, 2015. Apple described this release as containing &quot;Refinements to the Mac Experience&quot; and &quot;Improvements to System Performance&quot; rather than new features. Refinements include public transport built into the Maps application, GUI improvements to the Notes application, as well as adopting San Francisco as the system font. Metal API, an application enhancing software, had debuted in this operating system, being available to &quot;all Macs since 2012&quot;.

=== macOS 10.12 Sierra ===
macOS Sierra was announced on June 13, 2016, during the WWDC16 keynote speech. The update brought the Siri assistant to macOS, featuring several Mac-specific features, like searching for files. It also allowed websites to support Apple Pay as a method of transferring payment, using either a nearby iOS device or Touch ID to authenticate. iCloud also received several improvements, such as the ability to store a user&#x27;s Desktop and Documents folders on iCloud so they could be synced with other Macs on the same Apple ID. It was released publicly on September 20, 2016.

=== macOS 10.13 High Sierra ===
macOS High Sierra was announced on June 5, 2017, during the WWDC17 keynote speech. It was released on September 25, 2017. The release includes many under-the-hood improvements, including a switch to Apple File System (APFS), the introduction of Metal 2, support for HEVC video, and improvements to virtual reality support. In addition, numerous changes were made to standard applications including Photos, Safari, Notes, and Spotlight.

=== macOS 10.14 Mojave ===
macOS Mojave was announced on June 4, 2018, during the WWDC18 keynote speech. It was released on September 24, 2018. Some of the key new features were Dark wallpaper in dark mode, Desktop stacks and Dynamic Desktop, which changes the desktop background image to correspond to the user&#x27;s current time of day.

=== macOS 10.15 Catalina ===
macOS Catalina was announced on June 3, 2019, during the WWDC19 keynote speech. It was released on October 7, 2019. It primarily focuses on updates to built-in apps, such as replacing iTunes with separate Music, Podcasts, and TV apps, redesigned Reminders and Books apps, and a new Find My app. It also features Sidecar, which allows the user to use an iPad as a second screen for their computer, or even simulate a graphics tablet with an Apple Pencil. It is the first version of macOS not to support 32-bit applications. The Dashboard application was also removed in the update. Since macOS Catalina, iOS apps can run on macOS with Project Catalyst but requires the app to be made compatible unlike ARM-powered Apple silicon Macs that can run all iOS apps by default.

=== macOS 11 Big Sur ===
macOS Big Sur was announced on June 22, 2020, during the WWDC20 keynote speech. It was released November 12, 2020. The major version number is changed, for the first time since &quot;Mac OS X&quot; was released, making it macOS 11. It brings ARM support, new icons, GUI changes to the system, and other bug fixes.
Since macOS 11.2.3, it is no longer possible to install iOS apps by default from an IPA file instead of the Mac App Store on Apple silicon Macs, which now requires third-party software to unlock the functionality. Big Sur introduced Rosetta 2 to allow 64-bit Intel applications to run on Apple silicon Macs. However, Intel-based Macs are unable to run ARM-based applications, including iOS and iPadOS apps.

=== macOS 12 Monterey ===
macOS Monterey was announced on June 7, 2021, during the WWDC21 keynote speech. It was released on October 25, 2021. macOS Monterey introduces new features such as Universal Control, which allows users to use a single keyboard and mouse to move between devices; AirPlay, which now allows users to present and share almost anything; the Shortcuts app, also introduced to macOS, gives users access to galleries of pre-built shortcuts, designed for Macs, a service brought from iOS, and users can now also set up shortcuts, among other things. macOS Monterey is the final version of macOS that officially supports macOS Server.

=== macOS 13 Ventura ===
macOS Ventura was announced on June 6, 2022, during the WWDC22 keynote speech. It was released on October 24, 2022. macOS Ventura introduces Stage Manager, a new and optional window manager, a redesigned settings app, and Continuity Camera, which is a program that allows Mac users to use their iPhone as a camera, and several other new features. It is also the first version of macOS without macOS Server support.

=== macOS 14 Sonoma ===
macOS Sonoma was announced on June 5, 2023, during the WWDC23 keynote speech. Key changes include a revamp of Widgets, the user lock screen, and a video wallpaper/screensaver feature using Apple TV&#x27;s screen saver videos. It was released on September 26, 2023.

=== macOS 15 Sequoia ===
macOS Sequoia was announced on June 10, 2024, during the WWDC24 keynote speech. It was released on September 16, 2024.

<text>Collusion is a deceitful agreement or secret cooperation between two or more parties to limit open competition by deceiving, misleading or defrauding others of their legal right. Collusion is not always considered illegal. It can be used to attain objectives forbidden by law; for example, by defrauding or gaining an unfair market advantage. It is an agreement among firms or individuals to divide a market, set prices, limit production or limit opportunities.
It can involve &quot;unions, wage fixing, kickbacks, or misrepresenting the independence of the relationship between the colluding parties&quot;. In legal terms, all acts effected by collusion are considered void.

== Definition ==
In the study of economics and market competition, collusion takes place within an industry when rival companies cooperate for their mutual benefit. Conspiracy usually involves an agreement between two or more sellers to take action to suppress competition between sellers in the market. Because competition among sellers can provide consumers with low prices, conspiracy agreements increase the price consumers pay for the goods. Because of this harm to consumers, it is against antitrust laws to fix prices by agreement between producers, so participants must keep it a secret. Collusion often takes place within an oligopoly market structure, where there are few firms and agreements that have significant impacts on the entire market or industry. To differentiate from a cartel, collusive agreements between parties may not be explicit; however, the implications of cartels and collusion are the same.

Under competition law, there is an important distinction between direct and covert collusion. Direct collusion generally refers to a group of companies communicating directly with each other to coordinate and monitor their actions, such as cooperating through pricing, market allocation, sales quotas, etc. On the other hand, tacit collusion is where companies coordinate and monitor their behavior without direct communication. This type of collusion is generally not considered illegal, so companies guilty of tacit conspiracy should face no penalties even though their actions would have a similar economic impact as explicit conspiracy.

Collusion results from less competition through mutual understanding, where competitors can independently set prices and market share. A core principle of antitrust policy is that companies must not communicate with each other. Even if conversations between multiple companies are illegal but not enforceable, the incentives to comply with collusive agreements are the same with and without communication. It is against competition law for companies to have explicit conversations in private. If evidence of conversations is accidentally left behind, it will become the most critical and conclusive evidence in antitrust litigation. Even without communication, businesses can coordinate prices by observation, but from a legal standpoint, this tacit handling leaves no evidence. Most companies cooperate through invisible collusion, so whether companies communicate is at the core of antitrust policy.

Collusion is illegal in the United States, Canada, Australia and most of the EU due to antitrust laws, but implicit collusion in the form of price leadership and tacit understandings still takes place.

=== Tacit collusion ===
Covert collusion is known as tacit collusion and is considered legal. Adam Smith in &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; explains that since the masters (business owners) are fewer in number, it is easier to collude to serve common interests among those involved, such as maintaining low wages, whilst it is difficult for the labour to coordinate to protect their interests due to their vast numbers. Hence, business owners have a bigger advantage over the working class. Nevertheless, according to Adam Smith, the public rarely hears about coordination and collaborations that occur between business owners as it takes place in informal settings. Some forms of explicit collusion are not considered impactful enough on an individual basis to be considered illegal, such as that which occurred by the social media group WallStreetBets in the GameStop short squeeze.
There are many ways that implicit collusion tends to develop:
* The practice of stock analyst conference calls and meetings of industry participants almost necessarily results in tremendous amounts of strategic and price transparency. This allows each firm to see how and why every other firm is pricing their products.
* If the practice of the industry causes more complicated pricing, which is hard for the consumer to understand (such as risk-based pricing, hidden taxes and fees in the wireless industry, negotiable pricing), this can cause competition based on price to be meaningless (because it would be too complicated to explain to the customer in a short advertisement). This causes industries to have essentially the same prices and compete on advertising and image, something theoretically as damaging to consumers as normal price fixing.

==Base model of (price) collusion==
For a cartel to work successfully, it must:

* Co-ordinate on the conspiracy agreement (bargaining, explicit or implicit communication).
* Monitor compliance.
* Punish non-compliance.
* Control the expansion of non-cartel supply.
* Avoid inspection by customers and competition authorities.

Regarding stability within the cartel:
* Collusion on high prices means that members have an incentive to deviate.
* In a one-off situation, high prices are not sustainable.
* Requires long-term vision and repeated interactions.
* Companies need to choose between two approaches：
# Insist on collusion agreements (now) and promote cooperation (future).
# Turn away from the alliance (now) and face punishment (future).
* Two factors influence this choice: (1) deviations must be detectable (2) penalties for deviations must have a significant effect.
* Collusion is illegal, contracts between cartels establishing collusion are not protected by law, cannot be enforced by courts, and must have other forms of punishment

== Variations ==
* formula_1
* formula_2
* formula_3
* formula_4
* formula_5

Suppose this market has formula_6 firms. At the collusive price, the firms are symmetric, so they divide the profits equally between the whole industry, represented as formula_7. If and only if the profit of choosing to deviate is greater than that of sticking to collude, i.e.
* formula_8 (Companies have no incentive to deviate unilaterally)
* Therefore, the cartel alliance will be stable when formula_9 is the case, i.e. the firm has no incentive to deviate unilaterally. So as the number of firms increases, the more difficult it is for The Cartel to maintain stability.
As the number of firms in the market increases, so does the factor of the minimum discount required for collusion to succeed.

According to neoclassical price-determination theory and game theory, the independence of suppliers forces prices to their minimum, increasing efficiency and decreasing the price-determining ability of each firm. However if all firms collude to increase prices, loss of sales will be minimized, as consumers lack choices at lower prices and must decide between what is available. This benefits the colluding firms, as they generate more sales at the cost of efficiency to society. However, depending on the assumptions made in the theoretical model on the information available to all firms, there are some outcomes, based on Cooperative Game Theory, where collusion may have higher efficiency than if firms did not collude.

One variation of this traditional theory is the theory of kinked demand. Firms face a kinked demand curve if, when one firm decreases its price, other firms are expected to follow suit to maintain sales. When one firm increases its price, its rivals are unlikely to follow, as they would lose the sales gains they would otherwise receive by holding prices at the previous level. Kinked demand potentially fosters supra-competitive prices because any one firm would receive a reduced benefit from cutting price, as opposed to the benefits accruing under neoclassical theory and certain game-theoretic models such as Bertrand competition.

Collusion may also occur in auction markets, where independent firms coordinate their bids (bid rigging).

== Deviation ==

Actions that generate sufficient returns in the future are important to every company, and the probability of continued interaction and the company discount factor must be high enough. The sustainability of cooperation between companies also depends on the threat of punishment, which is also a matter of credibility. Firms that deviate from cooperative pricing will use MMC in each market. MMC increases the loss of deviation, and incremental loss is more important than incremental gain when the firm&#x27;s objective function is concave. Therefore, the purpose of MMC is to strengthen corporate compliance or inhibit deviant collusion.

The principle of collusion: firms give up deviation gains in the short term in exchange for continued collusion in the future.
* Collusion occurs when companies place more emphasis on future profits
* Collusion is easier to sustain when the choice deviates from the maximum profit to be gained is lower (i.e. the penalty profit is lower) and the penalty is greater.
* Future collusive profits − future punishment profits ≥ current deviation profits − current collusive profits-collusion can sustain.

Scholars in economics and management have tried to identify factors explaining why some firms are more or less likely to be involved in collusion. Some have noted the role of the regulatory environment and the existence of leniency programs.

== Indicators ==
Some actions that may indicate collusion among competitors are:

* Charging uniform prices or setting prices that are either too high or too low without justification
* Paying or receiving kickbacks and agreeing to refer customers only to each other
* Dividing territories and horizontal territorial allocation of markets among themselves 
* Tying agreements and anticompetitive Product bundling (although, not all product bundling is anticompetitive)
* Refusal to deal with certain customers or suppliers and exclusive dealing with certain customers or suppliers
* Selling products below cost in order to drive out competitors (also known as dumping)
* Restricting the distribution or supply of products along the supply chain through vertical restraints
* Bid rigging by fixing bids or agreeing not to bid for certain contracts

== Examples ==

* In the example in the picture, the dots in Pc and Q represent competitive industry prices. If firms collude, they can limit production to Q2 and raise the price to P2. Collusion usually involves some form of agreement to seek a higher price.
*When companies discriminate, price collusion is less likely, so the discount factor needed to ensure stability must be increased. In such price competition, competitors use delivered pricing to discriminate in space, but this does not mean that firms using delivered pricing to discriminate cannot collude.

=== United States ===
* Market division and price-fixing among manufacturers of heavy electrical equipment in the 1960s, including General Electric.
* An attempt by Major League Baseball owners to restrict players&#x27; salaries in the mid-1980s.
* The sharing of potential contract terms by NBA free agents in an effort to help a targeted franchise circumvent the salary cap.
* Price fixing within food manufacturers providing cafeteria food to schools and the military in 1993.
* Market division and output determination of livestock feed additive, called lysine, by companies in the US, Japan and South Korea in 1996, Archer Daniels Midland being the most notable of these.
* Chip dumping in poker or any other card game played for money.
*Ben and Jerry&#x27;s and Häagen-Dazs collusion of products in 2013: Ben and Jerry&#x27;s makes chunkier flavors with more treats in them, while Häagen-Dazs sticks to smoother flavors.
* Google and Apple against employee poaching, a collusion case in 2015 wherein it was revealed that both companies agreed not to hire employees from one another in order to halt the rise in wages.
* Google has been hit with a series of antitrust lawsuits. In October 2020, the US Department of Justice filed a landmark lawsuit alleging that Google unlawfully boxed out competitors by reaching deals with phone makers, including Apple and Samsung, to be the default search engine on their devices. Another lawsuit filed by nearly 40 attorneys general on Dec. 17, 2020 alleges that Google’s search results favored its own services over those of more-specialized rivals, a tactic that harmed competitors.

=== Europe ===
* The illegal collusion between the giant German automakers BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen, discovered by the European Commission in 2019, to hinder technological progress in improving the quality of vehicle emissions in order to reduce the cost of production and maximize profits.

=== Australia ===

* Japanese shipping company Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd (K-Line) were fined $34.5 million by the Federal Court for engaging in criminal cartel conduct. The court found that K-Line participated in a cartel with other shipping companies to fix prices on the transportation of cars, trucks, and buses to Australia between 2009 and 2012. K-Line pleaded guilty in April 2018 and the fine is the largest ever imposed under the Competition and Consumer Act. The court noted that the penalty should serve as a strong warning to businesses that cartel conduct will not be tolerated and will result in serious consequences.
* Between 2004 and 2013, Dr Esra Ogru, the former CEO of an Australian biotech company called Phosphagenics, colluded with two colleagues by using false invoicing and credit card reimbursements to defraud her employer of more than $6.1 million.

== Barriers ==
There can be significant barriers to collusion. In any given industry, these may include:

* The number of firms: As the number of firms in an industry increases, it is more difficult to successfully organize, collude and communicate.
* Cost and demand differences between firms: If costs vary significantly between firms, it may be impossible to establish a price at which to fix output. Firms generally prefer to produce at a level where marginal cost meets marginal revenue, if one firm can produce at a lower cost, it will prefer to produce more units, and would receive a larger share of profits than its partner in the agreement.
*Asymmetry of information: Colluding firms may not have all the correct information about all other firms, from a quantitative perspective (firms may not know all other firms&#x27; cost and demand conditions) or a qualitative perspective (moral hazard). In either situation, firms may not know each others&#x27; preferences or actions, and any discrepancy would incentive at least one actor to renege.
* Cheating: There is considerable incentive to cheat on collusion agreements; although lowering prices might trigger price wars, in the short term the defecting firm may gain considerably. This phenomenon is frequently referred to as &quot;chiseling&quot;.
* Potential entry: New firms may enter the industry, establishing a new baseline price and eliminating collusion (though anti-dumping laws and tariffs can prevent foreign companies from entering the market).
* Economic recession: An increase in average total cost or a decrease in revenue provides the incentive to compete with rival firms in order to secure a larger market share and increased demand.
* Anti-collusion legal framework and collusive lawsuit. Many countries with anti-collusion laws outlaw side-payments, which are an indication of collusion as firms pay each other to incentivize the continuation of the collusive relationship, may see less collusion as firms will likely prefer situations where profits are distributed towards themselves rather than the combined venture.
* Leniency Programs: Leniency programs are policies that reduce sanctions against collusion if a participant voluntarily confesses their behavior or cooperates with the public authority’s investigation. One example of a leniency program is offering immunity to the first firm who comes clean and gives the government information about collusion. These programs are designed to destabilize collusion and increase deterrence by encouraging firms to report illegal behavior.

== Conditions conducive to collusion ==
There are several industry traits that are thought to be conducive to collusion or empirically associated with collusion. These traits include:

* High market concentration: High market concentration refers to a market with few firms, which makes it easier for these firms to collude and coordinate their actions.
* Homogeneous products: Homogeneous products refer to products that are similar in nature, which makes it easier for firms to agree on prices and reduces the incentive for firms to compete on product differentiation
* Stable demand and/or excess capacity: Stable demand and capacity implies predictability and therefore demand and capacity does not fluctuate significantly, which makes it easier for firms to coordinate their actions and maintain a collusive agreement. This can also refer to a situation where firms have more production capacity than is needed to meet demand.

==Government intervention==

Collusion often occurs within an oligopoly market structure, which is a type of market failure. Therefore, natural market forces alone may be insufficient to prevent or deter collusion, and government intervention is often necessary.

Fortunately, various forms of government intervention can be taken to reduce collusion among firms and promote natural market competition.

* Fines and imprisonment to companies that collude and their executives who are personally liable.
* Detect collusion by screening markets for suspicious pricing activity and high profitability.
* Provide immunity (leniency) to the first company to confess and provide the government with information about the collusion.

<text>The Japanese beetle (Popillia japonica) is a species of scarab beetle. Due to the presence of natural predators, the Japanese beetle is not considered a pest in its native Japan, but in North America and some regions of Europe, it is a noted pest to roughly 300 species of plants. Some of these plants include rose bushes, grapes, hops, canna, crape myrtles, birch trees, linden trees, and others.

The adult beetles damage plants by skeletonizing the foliage (i.e., consuming only the material between a leaf&#x27;s veins) as well as, at times, feeding on a plant&#x27;s fruit. The subterranean larvae feed on the roots of grasses.

==Taxonomy==
English entomologist Edward Newman described the Japanese beetle in 1841.

== Description ==
Adult &quot;P. japonica&quot; measure in length and in width, with iridescent copper-colored elytra and green thorax and head. A row of white tufts (spots) of hair project from under the wing covers on each side of the body. Males are slightly smaller than females. Grubs are white and lie in curled positions. A mature grub is roughly long.

== Distribution ==
&quot;Popillia japonica&quot; is native to Japan, but is an invasive species in North America and Europe.

The first written evidence of the insect appearing within the United States was in 1916 in a nursery near Riverton, New Jersey. The beetle larvae are thought to have entered the United States in a shipment of iris bulbs prior to 1912, when inspections of commodities entering the country began. As of 2015, just nine western states of the United States were considered free of Japanese beetles. These beetles have been detected in airports on the west coast of the United States since the 1940s. Only three were found in Washington State in 2020, but from late June to September 3, 2021, there were over 20,000 found in Grandview alone.

The first Japanese beetle found in Canada was inadvertently brought by tourists to Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, by ferry from Maine in 1939. During the same year, three additional adults were captured at Yarmouth and three at Lacolle in southern Quebec.

Japanese beetles have been found on the islands of the Azores since the 1970s. In 2014, the first population in mainland Europe was discovered near Milan, Italy. In 2017, the pest was detected in nearby Ticino, Switzerland. In 2023, the first population north of the Alps was detected in Kloten near Zürich, Switzerland.

== Life cycle ==


Eggs are laid individually or in small clusters near the soil surface. Within approximately two weeks, the ova hatch, then the larvae feed on fine roots and other organic material. As the larvae mature, they become c-shaped grubs, which consume progressively coarser roots and may do economic damage to pasture and turf at this time.

Larvae hibernate in small cells in the soil, emerging in the spring when soil temperatures rise again. Within 4–6 weeks of breaking hibernation, the larvae will pupate. Most of the beetle&#x27;s life is spent as a larva, with only 30–45 days spent as an imago. Adults feed on leaf material above ground, using pheromones to attract other beetles and overwhelm plants, skeletonizing leaves from the top of the plant downward. The aggregation of beetles will alternate daily between mating, feeding, and ovipositing. An adult female may lay as many as 40–60 ova in her lifetime.

Throughout the majority of the Japanese beetle&#x27;s range, its life cycle takes one full year; however, in the extreme northern parts of its range, as well as high-altitude zones as found in its native Japan, development may take two years.

== Pest control ==
Phenological models might be useful in predicting the timing of the presence of larvae or adults of the Japanese beetle. Model outputs can be used to support the timely implementation of monitoring and control actions against the pest, thus reducing its potential impact.

Owing to their destructive nature, traps have been invented specifically to target Japanese beetles. These comprise a pair of crossed walls with a bag or plastic container underneath and are baited with floral scent, pheromone, or both. However, studies conducted at the University of Kentucky and Eastern Illinois University suggest beetles attracted to traps frequently do not end up in the traps; instead, they land on plants in the vicinity and cause more damage along the flight path and near the trap than may have occurred if the trap were not present.

During the larval stage, the Japanese beetle lives in lawns and other grasslands, where it eats the roots of grasses. During that stage, it is susceptible to a fatal disease called milky spore disease, caused by a bacterium called milky spore, &quot;Paenibacillus&quot; (formerly &quot;Bacillus&quot;) &quot;popilliae.&quot; The USDA developed this biological control, and it is commercially available in powder form for application to lawn areas. Standard applications (low density across a broad area) take from two to four years to establish maximal protection against larval survival, expanding through the soil through repeated rounds of infection. Control programs based on milky spore disease have been found to work most efficiently when applied as large-scale treatment programs, rather than by isolated landowners. &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot; is also used to control Japanese beetle populations in the same manner.

On field crops such as squash, floating row covers can be used to exclude the beetles, but this may necessitate hand pollination of the flowers. Kaolin sprays can also be used as barriers and have been shown to be as effective as standard pesticides programs.

Research performed by many US extension service branches has shown that pheromone traps attract more beetles than they catch; under favorable conditions, only up to three quarters of the insects attracted to a trap will be captured by it. Traps are most effective when spread out over an entire community and downwind and at the borders (i.e., as far away as possible, particularly upwind) of managed property containing plants being protected.

When present in small numbers, the beetles may be manually controlled using a soap-water spray mixture, shaking a plant in the morning hours and disposing of the fallen beetles, or simply picking them off attractions such as rose flowers, since the presence of beetles attracts more beetles to that plant.

Several insect predators and parasitoids have been introduced to the United States for biocontrol. Two of them, the fly &quot;Istocheta aldrichi&quot;, a parasite of adult beetles, and the solitary wasp &quot;Tiphia vernalis&quot;, a parasite of larvae, are well established with significant but variable rates of parasitism. &quot;Tiphia vernalis&quot; reproduces by locating beetle grubs through digging, and on finding one, it paralyzes it with a sting and lays an egg on it; on hatching, the wasp larva consumes the grub. &quot;Istocheta aldrichi&quot; instead seeks out adult female beetles and lays eggs on their thoraxes, allowing its larvae to burrow into the insect&#x27;s body and kill it in this manner. A female &quot;I. aldrichi&quot; can lay up to 100 eggs over two weeks, and the rapidity with which its larvae kill their hosts allows the use of these flies to suppress beetle populations before they can themselves reproduce.

Soil-dwelling nematodes are known to seek out and prey on Japanese beetle grubs during the subterranean portion of their life cycle by entering larvae and reproducing within their bodies. Varieties that have seen commercial use as pest control agents include &quot;Steinernema glaseri&quot; and &quot;Heterorhabditis bacteriophora&quot;.

Recent studies have begun to explore a microsporidian pathogen, &quot;Ovavesicula popilliae&quot;, as a form of biocontrol against Japanese beetles. Initially discovered in 1987, O. popilliae has been observed inhabiting the malpighian tubules of third-instar larvae. This leads to swelling, inefficiency in the gut, and potentially cause microsporidiosis in the infected beetles. This infection weakens the beetle and creates a suitable breeding ground for opportunistic pathogens.

== Host plants ==
While the larvae of Japanese beetles feed on the roots of many genera of grasses, the adults consume the leaves of a much wider range of hosts, including these common crops: bean, cannabis, strawberry, tomato, pepper, grape, hop, rose, cherry, plum, pear, peach, raspberry, blackberry, corn, pea, okra, and blueberry.

<doc id="162572" wikidata="Q4120972" url="?curid=162572" title="List of presidents of Colombia">
<text>Under the Colombian Constitution of 1991, the president of Colombia is the head of state and head of government of the Republic of Colombia. As chief of the executive branch and head of the national government as a whole, the presidency is the highest political office in Colombia by influence and recognition. The president is also the commander-in-chief of the Military Forces of Colombia. The president is directly elected to a four-year term in a popular election. Since the passing of the &quot;Legislative Act 2 of 2004&quot;, no person may be elected president more than twice. In 2015, a constitutional amendment repealed the 2004 changes and reverted to the original one-term limit. Upon the death, resignation, or removal from office of an incumbent president, the vice president assumes the office. The president must be at least 30 years of age and a &quot;natural born&quot; citizen of Colombia.

==List of Presidents during the War of Independence==

=== Pre-independence period (1810–1819) ===
Although Colombia has historically been considered an independent country since 1819, the quality of &quot;president&quot; of Colombia of the leaders who governed the current South American country before the Independence of Spain was consolidated is equally accepted. The following is a list of those rulers prior to 1819, considered official by various sources in the country such as the Museum of the Bank of the Republic.

The following were the leaders who exercised executive power during the First Republic, either as presidents of the Supreme Junta of Santa Fe (1810–1811), presidents of the State of Cundinamarca (1811–1814) (in red) or presidents of the Congress of the United Provinces of New Granada (1811–1816), the last two states in dispute.

=== Supreme Governing Junta of Santa Fe in New Granada (1810–1811) ===
=== Free and Independent State of Cundinamarca (1811–1814) ===
=== United Provinces of New Granada (1811–1816) ===

== Official List of Presidents ==

===Republic of Colombia (1819–1831)===
This list includes those persons who were sworn into or forcibly took the office of president of the Republic of Colombia following the passing of the Colombian Constitution of Cúcuta, which took effect on 30 August 1821.
The Republic of Colombia of 1821–1831 is now commonly referred to as the &quot;Gran Colombia&quot; to differentiate it from the present-day Republic of Colombia. Gran Colombia was the union of the territories that comprised the Viceroyalty of the New Granada under the &quot;uti possidetis&quot; principle, and it included the political entities that had formed in the New Granada after the initial wars of independence of 1810 against the Kingdom of Spain under King Joseph I; those included the Second Republic of Venezuela, the United Provinces of New Granada, the Presidency of Quito, and the Royal Audiencia of Panama.The presidency dates back to the Congress of Angostura. This quasi-constituent assembly was formed to lay the ground work for a self-ruled governing administration after independence. The Constituent Assembly was formed by regional leaders that represented areas under rebel control; these areas did not include parts of what is now Colombia, as those areas were still under Spanish control, but aimed to legislate on its behalf. Congress elected an interim-executive officer and vested this figure with the title of president. Chosen to be first president of Colombia, was General Simón Bolívar y Palacios, leader of the revolutionary forces, who up to that point was titled &quot;Supreme Chief&quot; for his role in the revolution. The following day, Congress elected Francisco Antonio Zea Díaz, first vice president of Colombia. Bolívar was subsequently re-elected interim president by the Angostura Assembly on after Colombia was conquered following the Battle of Boyacá, and elected again in 1821 in a permanent interim basis, pending national elections, by the Congress of Cúcuta, another constituent assembly mandated by the Angostura Assembly, and this time with elected officials representing the Colombian territories, during this time, and until 1826, the executive power was entrusted to the vice president Francisco de Paula Santander y Omaña, while Bolívar was away in battle fighting to liberate Spanish colonies in Bolivia, and Peru. Bolívar was formally elected in a national election in 1826 for a period of four years, but on 27 August 1828, Bolívar declared martial law and assumed dictatorship style powers after the Congress of Ocaña failed to pass a new constitution. Bolívar eventually relinquished power in 1830, and Congress elected Joaquín de Mosquera y Arboleda as his successor, but was shortly deposed by General Rafael Urdaneta y Faría who hoped Bolívar would once again re-take power, but Bolívar not only declined the presidency, but also shortly died, leaving Urdaneta with no mandate for power. Urdaneta ceded executive-power to the vice president Domingo Caycedo y Sanz de Santamaría, as Congress had impeached Mosquera for his failure to prevent the coup; during this time, and until 1832 the presidency remained vacant as there was no law for succession of power. In 1832, former vice president Santander was elected by Congress as president of Gran Colombia, and it would be the last, since the territories of Venezuela and Ecuador broke away, which prompted the drafting of a new constitution.


===Republic of New Granada (1832–1858)===
This list includes those persons who were sworn into or forcibly took the office of president of the Republic of New Granada following the passing of the Colombian Constitution of 1832, which took effect on 26 November 1832.

There were 8 people in office serving a presidency each. All were popularly elected under an electoral college system except one, José María Melo y Ortiz who took power by mounting a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;. Francisco de Paula Santander y Omaña, the first president, served initially on a provisional basis but in 1833 began a regular four-year term as president of the Republic of New Granada, to which he was popularly elected. Santander spent the longest time in office with 5 years and 22 days. José María Obando del Campo spent the shortest time in office with just 1 year and 6 days before being deposed.

The president and the vice president were elected separately two years apart for a period of four years each, resulting in a president having two vice presidents given normal circumstances. The Colombian Constitution of 1832, just like its predecessor, did not provide for a way to fill a vacancy in the presidency or the vicepresidency until the next electoral period, because of this the presidency was vacant between 1854 and 1857 when Melo, who had deposed President Obando in a coup, handed power to the previous administration; Obando would have taken back the presidency, but he had been impeached by Congress and hence there was no president to take power. During this time Vice President José de Obaldía y Orejuela served as acting president until the end of his term, at which point the newly elected vice president Manuel María Mallarino Ibargüen served as acting president for the remainder of the term Obando had been elected for until 1857 when Mariano Ospina Rodríguez was elected. The vice presidency was also vacant between 1837 and 1839, when Vice President José Ignacio de Márquez Barreto was elected president and the post remained vacant until the next vice presidencial election in 1839.

===Granadine Confederation (1858–1863)===
This list includes those persons who were sworn into, succeeded to, or forcibly took office as President of the Granadine Confederation following the passing of the Colombian Constitution of 1858, which took effect on 22 May 1858.

The Constitution of 1858 abolished the Office of the Vice Presidency. The line of succession was modified by the introduction of the figures of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Presidential Designates, who were elected annually by Congress amongst its members, but held no office or duties other than providing a succession to the presidency in the event of the president&#x27;s temporal or permanent absence.

There were only 3 people in office who served a presidency each. Mariano Ospina Rodríguez initially took office in 1857 as the 8th and last president of the Republic of New Granada. In 1861 Julio Arboleda Pombo became the first person to be elected President of the Granadine Confederation under the new electoral college system set up by the new constitution, however during this time the country was going through a civil war and Congress was closed down. Furthermore, according to the new constitution the president had to take office before Congress; since this couldn&#x27;t happen, Pombo could not take office and did not become the president. When Ospina&#x27;s term ended on 1 April 1861, with no congress to swear in the elected president, the power would have been transferred to one of the Presidential Designates, however with Congress closed down no designates were elected for that year, and with no designates to succeed Ospina, the presidency was handed out to the next person in the line of succession which was the Inspector General, Bartolomé Calvo Díaz. Calvo&#x27;s presidential tenure was short; within three months of holding the post, General Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera y Arboleda, leader of the Liberal forces, marched into Bogotá deposing Calvo in a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;.

Giving the great animosity between Conservatives and Liberals at the time of the 1860-62 civil war, another thing that marked this period in regards to the presidency was that there were multiple attempts to undermine the government in power by laying claims on the presidency using various arguments. The first one of these was the Liberal General Juan José Nieto Gil, who claimed the presidency by disregarding the legitimacy of Ospina and claiming power in virtue of being the second presidential designate; he finally ceded power to his fellow Liberal General, Mosquera, when he took power in Bogotá. Mosquera had also claimants to the presidency in opposition to him. Julio Arboleda Pombo who was elected president but could not take office was appointed inspector general by President Calvo when he was in power, thus when Mosquera captured him, Arboleda claimed the presidency as the next in theline of succession to Calvo, even though that by this time the government and city had fallen, and the Conservative administration had fled the capital. After Arboleda was also captured by Mosquera a few days after Calvo was taken prisoner, the Secretary of Finance, Ignacio Gutierrez Vergara, succeeded Arboleda to the claimed presidency as next in the line of succession being the oldest government secretary of the previous administration. When Gutiérrez was captured by Mosquera, the next in line of succession by age was the Secretary of Government and War, General Leonardo Canal González. As pretender to presidency, he moved the capital of the nation to Pasto, where he led the Conservative Government in exile. In 1862 Canal left to fight the Liberal forces and left Manuel del Río y de Narváez, his Secretary of Government and War, as acting president of the government-in-exile. This struggle for power all came to an end in 1863 when del Río finally capitulated to Mosquera presenting the surrender of the government-in-exile and recognising the presidency of Mosquera bringing the civil war to an end.

===United States of Colombia (1863–1886)===
This list includes those persons who were sworn into, succeeded to, or forcibly took office as President of the United States of Colombia following the passing of the Colombian Constitution of 1863, which took effect on 8 May 1863.

There were 11 people in office, and 14 presidencies as three presidents served two non-consecutive terms each and are counted chronologically twice, they are: Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera y Arboleda, Manuel Murillo Toro, and Rafael Núñez Moledo, the last two having actually been elected twice. Out of the 11 individuals in office, 9 were elected, one succeeded to the presidency (José Eusebio Otálora Martínez), and one took the presidency by mounting a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; (Santos Acosta Castillo). Only one president died in office from natural causes (Francisco Javier Zaldúa y Racines).

Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera y Arboleda, the first president of the United States of Colombia, had actually started his tenure in 1861 (he became the third and last president of the Granadine Confederation with a coup). In this capacity he was appointed by the National Constituent Assembly of 1863 to continue serving while the assembly drafted, passed, signed, and implemented a new constitution. The first elected president of the United States of Colombia was Manuel Murillo Toro, elected in 1864 for a constitutional two-year term. The longest serving president was Rafael Núñez Moledo with 10 years, 5 months, and 17 days, of which only 2 years, 4 months, and 5 days were actually served as the elected president of the United States of Colombia, but still longer than anyone else. Francisco Javier Zaldúa y Racines spent the shortest time in office with just 8 months, and 20 days in 1882.

The Colombian Constitution of 1858 had effectively abolished the vice presidency, and introduced a new line of succession system featuring the figures of first, second, and third Presidential designates. These designates were elected annually by Congress amongst its members, but held no office or duties other than providing a succession for the president in the event of the resident&#x27;s temporal or permanent absence. Both changes to vice presidency and presidential designates were kept by the Colombian Constitution of 1863. This system of succession was implemented in 1882 when President Zaldúa died in office and the third presidential designate, Clímaco Calderón Reyes, became acting president while the first presidential designate, Rafael Núñez Moledo, took office, however Núñez turned down the presidency and therefore the second presidential designate, José Eusebio Otálora Martínez, succeeded Zaldúa to presidency.

===Republic of Colombia (1886–present)===
This list includes those persons who were sworn into, succeeded to, or forcibly took office as president of the present-day Republic of Colombia following the passing of the Colombian Constitution of 1886, which took effect on 6 August 1886. For Colombian leaders before this, see the above lists.

There have been 31 people in office, and 32 presidencies as Alfonso López Pumarejo served two non-consecutive terms and is counted chronologically as both the 14th and 16th president. Out of the 31 individuals in office, 26 were elected president, three succeeded to the presidency (Miguel Antonio Caro Tobar, Ramón González Valencia and Jorge Holguín Mallarino), two took the presidency by mounting a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; (José Manuel Marroquín Ricaurte and Gustavo Rojas Pinilla against Manuel Antonio Sanclemente Sanclemente and Laureano Gómez Castro respectively), two permanently resigned from office (Rafael Reyes Prieto and Marco Fidel Suárez) and one died in office of natural causes (Rafael Núñez Moledo).

Rafael Núñez Moledo, the first president, was actually inaugurated in 1884 as the 14th and last president of the United States of Colombia for a two-year constitutional term; in this capacity he was appointed by the National Constituent Assembly of 1885 to serve a new six-year term while the assembly drafted, passed, signed, and implemented a new constitution; at the end of this term he was elected in 1892 for his first constitutional six-year term as president of Colombia. Núñez spent the longest time in office with 10 years, 5 months, and 17 days, but having only spent 2 years, 1 month, and 11 days as the elected president of Colombia before his death. The longest serving elected president was Álvaro Uribe Vélez with 8 years between 2002 and 2010 having been re-elected for a second term in 2006. Ramón González Valencia spent the shortest time in office with just 1 year between 1909 and 1910 when he was elected by Congress to finish the term that President Rafael Reyes Prieto had resigned to. The shortest serving elected president was Manuel Antonio Sanclemente Sanclemente with 1 year, 11 months, and 24 days before he was deposed. Carlos Eugenio Restrepo Restrepo, was the first president to serve under the new four-year constitutional term after the Constitutional Reform of 1910 when he was appointed president by that year&#x27;s National Constituent Assembly; the first elected president to serve the four-year constitutional term would be his successor, José Vicente Concha Ferreira elected in 1914. Eduardo Santos Montejo was the first to be elected by men of all classes in 1938 after all land-ownership and literacy restrictions were repealed by the Constitutional Reform of 1936. Alberto Lleras Camargo in 1958 became the first president elected after women gained voting rights after the Constitutional Reform of 1954.

The vice presidency was abolished after the Constitutional Reform of 1905 and was only re-introduced after the passing of the Colombian Constitution of 1991 which remains in place. Article 127 of the Colombian Constitution of 1886 only allowed for re-election of the president in a non-immediate form; this was changed by the Constitutional Reform of 2005 allowing for immediate re-elections for a maximum of two terms.

Under the Colombian Constitution of 1991, the President of Colombia is the head of state and head of government of the Republic of Colombia. As chief of the executive branch and head of the national government as a whole, the presidency is the highest political office in Colombia as measure by influence and recognition. The president is also the commander-in-chief of the military of Colombia. The president is directly elected to a four-year term in a popular election. The &quot;Legislative Act 2 of 2004&quot; established that no person may be elected president more than twice, allowing Álvaro Uribe and Juan Manuel Santos consecutive reelection in 2006 and 2014 respectively. Nonetheless, in 2015 Congress reformed the Constitution again and suppressed consecutive and non-consecutive presidential reelection. Since 1991 Constitution it was established that if no presidential candidate obtain more than 50% of the popular vote a run-off vote is needed. Upon the death, resignation, or removal from office of an incumbent president, the vice president assumes the office. The president must be at least 30 years of age and a &quot;natural born&quot; citizen of Colombia.

<text>Corvidae is a cosmopolitan family of oscine passerine birds that contains the crows, ravens, rooks, magpies, jackdaws, jays, treepies, choughs, and nutcrackers. In colloquial English, they are known as the crow family or corvids. Currently, 139 species are included in this family. The genus &quot;Corvus&quot; containing 50 species makes up over a third of the entire family. Corvids (ravens) are the largest passerines.

Corvids display remarkable intelligence for animals of their size, and are among the most intelligent birds thus far studied. Specifically, members of the family have demonstrated self-awareness in mirror tests (Eurasian magpies) and tool-making ability (e.g. crows and rooks), skills which until recently were thought to be possessed only by humans and a few other higher mammals. Their total brain-to-body mass ratio is equal to that of non-human great apes and cetaceans, and only slightly lower than that of humans.

They are medium to large in size, with strong feet and bills, rictal bristles, and a single moult each year (most passerines moult twice). Corvids are found worldwide, except for the southern tip of South America and the polar ice caps. The majority of the species are found in tropical South and Central America and in southern Asia, with fewer than 10 species each in Africa and Australasia. The genus &quot;Corvus&quot; has re-entered Australia in relatively recent geological prehistory, with five species and one subspecies there. Several species of raven have reached oceanic islands, and some of these species are now highly threatened with extinction, or have already become extinct.

==Systematics, taxonomy, and evolution==
The name Corvidae for the family was introduced by the English zoologist William Elford Leach in a guide to the contents of the British Museum published in 1820. Over the years, much disagreement has arisen on the exact evolutionary relationships of the corvid family and their relatives. What eventually seemed clear was that corvids are derived from Australasian ancestors, and spread throughout the world from there. Other lineages derived from these ancestors evolved into ecologically diverse, but often Australasian, groups. In the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, Sibley and Ahlquist united the corvids with other taxa in the Corvida, based on DNA–DNA hybridization. The presumed corvid relatives included: currawongs, birds of paradise, whipbirds, quail-thrushes, whistlers, monarch flycatchers and drongos, shrikes, vireos, and vangas, but current research favors the theory that this grouping is partly artificial. The corvids constitute the core group of the Corvoidea, together with their closest relatives (the birds of paradise, Australian mud-nesters, and shrikes). They are also the core group of the Corvida, which includes the related groups, such as Old World orioles and vireos.

Clarification of the interrelationships of the corvids has been achieved based on cladistic analysis of several DNA sequences. The jays and magpies do not constitute monophyletic lineages, but rather seem to split up into an American and Old World lineage, and an Holarctic and Oriental lineage, respectively. These are not closely related among each other. The position of the azure-winged magpie, which has always been of undistinguished lineage, is less clear than previously thought.

The crested jayshrike (&quot;Platylophus galericulatus&quot;) is traditionally included in the Corvidae, but is not a true member of this family, being closer to the helmetshrikes (Malaconotidae) or shrikes (Laniidae). Likewise, the Hume&#x27;s ground &quot;jay&quot; (&quot;Pseudopodoces humilis&quot;) is, in fact, a member of the tit family, Paridae. The following tree showing the phylogeny of the crow family is based on a molecular study by Jenna McCullough and collaborators published in 2023.
=== Fossil record ===
The earliest corvid fossils date to mid-Miocene Europe, about 17 million years ago; &quot;Miocorvus&quot; and &quot;Miopica&quot; may be ancestral to crows and some of the magpie lineage, respectively, or similar to the living forms, due to convergent evolution. The known prehistoric corvid genera appear to be mainly of the New World and Old World jay and Holarctic magpie lineages:

* &quot;Miocorvus&quot; (Middle Miocene of Sansan, Gers in southwestern France)
* &quot;Miopica&quot; (Middle Miocene of SW Ukraine)
* &quot;Miocitta&quot; (Pawnee Creek Late Miocene of Logan County, US)
* Corvidae gen. et sp. indet. (Edson Early Pliocene of Sherman County, Kansas, US)
* &quot;Protocitta&quot; (Early Pleistocene of Reddick, US)
* Corvidae gen. et sp. indet. (Early/Middle Pleistocene of Sicily) – probably belongs in an extant genus
* &quot;Henocitta&quot; (Arredondo Clay Middle Pleistocene of Williston, US)

In addition, there are numerous fossil species of extant genera since the Mio–Pliocene, mainly European &quot;Corvus&quot;.

==Morphology==

Corvids are large to very large passerines with a robust build and strong legs; all species, except the pinyon jay, have nostrils covered by bristle-like feathers. Many corvids of temperate zones have mainly black or blue coloured plumage; however, some are pied black and white, some have a blue-purple iridescence, and many tropical species are brightly coloured. The sexes are very similar in color and size. Corvids have strong, stout bills and large wingspans. The family includes the largest members of the passerine order.

The smallest corvid is the dwarf jay (&quot;Cyanolyca nanus&quot;), at and . The largest corvids are the common raven (&quot;Corvus corax&quot;) and the thick-billed raven (&quot;Corvus crassirostris&quot;), both of which regularly exceed and .

Species can be identified based on size, shape, and geography; however, some, especially the Australian crows, are best identified by their raucous calls.

==Ecology==
Corvids occur in most climatic zones. Most are sedentary, and do not migrate significantly. However, during a shortage of food, irruptive migration can occur. When species are migratory, they will form large flocks in the fall (around August in the Northern Hemisphere) and travel south.

One reason for the success of crows, compared to ravens, is their ability to overlap breeding territory. During breeding season, crows were shown to overlap breeding territory six times as much as ravens. This invasion of breeding ranges allowed a related increase in local population density.

Since crows and magpies have benefited and even increased in numbers due to human development, it was suggested that this might cause increased rates of nest predation of smaller bird species, leading to declines. Several studies have shown this concern to be unfounded. One study examined American crows, which had increased in numbers, were a suspect in nest predation of threatened marbled murrelets. However, Steller&#x27;s jays, which are successful independently of human development, are more efficient in plundering small birds&#x27; nests than American crows and common ravens. Therefore, the human relationship with crows and ravens did not significantly increase nest predation when compared to other factors, such as habitat destruction. Similarly, a study examining the decline of British songbirds found no link between Eurasian magpie numbers and population changes of 23 songbird species.

==Behaviour==
Some corvids have strong organization and community groups. Jackdaws, for example, have a strong social hierarchy, and are facultatively colonial during breeding. Providing mutual aid has also been recorded within many of the corvid species.

Young corvids have been known to play and take part in elaborate social games. Documented group games follow &quot;king of the mountain&quot; or &quot;follow the leader&quot; patterns. Other play involves the manipulation, passing, and balancing of sticks. Corvids also take part in other activities, such as sliding down smooth surfaces. These games are understood to play a large role in the adaptive and survival ability of the birds.

Mate selection is quite complex, and accompanied with much social play in the Corvidae. Youngsters of social corvid species undergo a series of tests, including aerobatic feats, before being accepted as a mate by the opposite sex.

Some corvids can be aggressive. Blue jays, for example, are well known to attack anything that threatens their nest. Crows have been known to attack dogs, cats, ravens, and birds of prey. Most of the time, these assaults take place as a distraction long enough to allow an opportunity for stealing food.

===Food and feeding===

The natural diet of many corvid species is omnivorous, consisting of invertebrates, nestlings, small mammals, berries, fruits, seeds, and carrion. However, some corvids, especially the crows, have adapted well to human conditions, and have come to rely on human food sources. In a US study of American crows, common ravens, and Steller&#x27;s jays around campgrounds and human settlements, the crows appeared to have the most diverse diet of all, taking anthropogenic foods, such as: bread, spaghetti, fried potatoes, dog food, sandwiches, and livestock feed. The increase in available human food sources is contributing to population rises in some corvid species.

Some corvids are predators of other birds. During the wintering months, corvids typically form foraging flocks. However, some crows also eat many agricultural pests, including cutworms, wireworms, grasshoppers, and harmful weeds. Some corvids will eat carrion, and since they lack a specialized beak for tearing into flesh, they must wait until animals are opened, whether by other predators or as roadkill.

===Reproduction===

Many species of corvid are territorial, protecting territories throughout the year, or simply during the breeding season. In some cases, territories may only be guarded during the day, with the pair joining off-territory roosts at night. Some corvids are well-known communal roosters. Some groups of roosting corvids can be very large, with a roost of 65,000 rooks counted in Scotland. Some, including the rook and the jackdaw, are also communal nesters.

The partner bond in corvids is extremely strong, and even lifelong in some species. This monogamous lifestyle, however, can still contain extra-pair copulations. Males and females build large nests together in trees or on ledges; jackdaws are known to breed in buildings and in rabbit warrens. The male will also feed the female during incubation. The nests are constructed of a mass of bulky twigs lined with grass and bark. Corvids can lay between 3 and 10 eggs, typically ranging between 4 and 7. The eggs are usually greenish in colour with brown blotches. Once hatched, the young remain in the nests for up to 6–10 weeks depending on the species.

Corvids use several different forms of parental care, including bi-parental care and cooperative breeding. Cooperative breeding takes place when parents are helped in raising their offspring, usually by relatives, but also sometimes by non-related adults. Such helpers at the nest in most cooperatively-breeding birds are males, while females join other groups. White-throated magpie-jays are cooperatively-breeding corvids where the helpers are mostly female.

===Intelligence===
Jerison (1973) has suggested that the degree of brain encephalization (the ratio of brain size to body size, EQ) may correlate with an animal&#x27;s intelligence and cognitive skills. Corvids and psittacids have higher EQ than other bird families, similar to that of the apes. Among the Corvidae, ravens possess the largest brain to body size ratio. In addition to the high EQ, the Corvid&#x27;s intelligence is boosted by their living environment. Firstly, Corvids are found in some of the harshest environments on Earth, where surviving requires higher intelligence and better adaptations. Secondly, most of the Corvids are omnivorous, suggesting that they are exposed to a wider variety of different stimuli and environments. Furthermore, many corvid species live in a large family group, and demonstrate high social complexities.

Their intelligence is boosted by the long growing period of the young. By remaining with the parents, the young have more opportunities to learn necessary skills.

When compared to dogs and cats in an experiment testing the ability to seek out food according to three-dimensional clues, corvids out-performed the mammals. A meta-analysis testing how often birds invented new ways to acquire food in the wild found corvids to be the most innovative birds. A 2004 review suggested that their cognitive abilities are on par with those of non-human great apes. Despite structural differences, the brains of corvids and great apes both evolved the ability to make geometrical measurements.

==== Empathy-consolation ====
Ravens are found to show bystander affiliation, and solicited bystander affiliation after aggressive conflicts. Most of the time, bystanders already sharing a valuable relationship with the victim are more likely to affiliate with the victim to alleviate the victim&#x27;s distress (&quot;consolation&quot;) as a representation of empathy. Ravens are believed to be able to be sensitive to other&#x27;s emotions.

==== Empathy-emotional contagion ====
Emotion contagion refers to the emotional state matching between individuals. Adriaense et al. (2018) used a bias paradigm to quantify emotional valence, which along with emotional arousal, define emotions. They manipulated the positive and negative affective states in the demonstrator ravens, which showed significantly different responses to the two states: behaving pessimism to the negative states, and optimism to the positive states. Then, the researchers trained another observer raven to first observe the demonstrator&#x27;s responses. The observer raven was then presented with ambiguous stimuli. The experiment results confirmed the existence of negative emotional contagions in ravens, while the positive emotional contagion remained unclear. Therefore, ravens are capable of both discerning the negative emotions in their conspecifics and showing signs of empathy.

==== Interspecific communications ====
Interspecific communications are evolutionarily beneficial for species living in the same environment. Facial expressions are the most widely used method to express emotions by humans. Tate et al. (2006) explored the issue of non-human mammals processing the visual cues from faces to achieve interspecific communication with humans. Researchers also examined the avian species&#x27; capabilities to interpret this non-verbal communication, and their extent of sensitivity to human emotions. Based on the experimental subject of American Crows&#x27; behavioral changes to varying human gazes and facial expressions, Clucas et al. (2013) identified that crows are able to change their behaviors to the presence of direct human gaze, but did not respond differentially to human emotional facial expressions. They further suggested that the high intelligence of the crows enables them to adapt well to human-dominated environments.

==== Personality conformity ====
It is considered difficult to study emotions in animals when humans could not communicate with them. One way to identify animal personality traits is to observe the consistency of the individual&#x27;s behavior over time and circumstances. For group-living species, there are two opposing hypotheses regarding the assortment of personalities within a group: the social niche specialization hypothesis, and the conformity hypothesis. To test these two hypotheses, McCune et al. (2018) performed an experiment on the boldness of two species in Corvidae: the Mexican Jay and California Scrub-Jay. Their results confirmed the conformity hypothesis, supported by the significant differences in the group effects.

==== Social construction ====
The individual personality is both determined by genetics and shaped by social contexts. Miller et al. (2016) examined the role of the developmental and social environment in personality formation in common ravens and carrion crows, which are highly social corvids. The researchers highlighted the correlation between social contexts and an individual&#x27;s consistent behavior over time (personality), by showing that conspecific presence promoted the behavioral similarities between individuals. Therefore, the researchers demonstrated that social contexts had a significant impact on the development of the raven&#x27;s and crow&#x27;s personalities.

==== Social complexity ====
The social complexity hypothesis suggests that living in a social group enhances the cognitive abilities of animals. Corvid ingenuity is represented through their feeding skills, memorization abilities, use of tools, and group behaviour. Living in large social groups has long been connected with high cognitive ability. To live in a large group, a member must be able to recognize individuals, and track the social position and foraging of other members over time. Members must also be able to distinguish between sex, age, reproductive status, and dominance, and to update this information constantly. It might be that social complexity corresponds to their high cognition, as well as contributing to the spread of information between members of the group.

==== Consciousness, culture-rudiments, and neurology ====
A study published in 2008 suggested that the Eurasian magpie is the only non-mammal species known to be able to recognize itself in a mirror test, but later research could not replicate this finding. Studies using very similar setups could not find such behaviour in other corvids (e.g., Carrion crows). Magpies have been observed taking part in elaborate grieving rituals, which have been likened to human funerals, including laying grass wreaths. Marc Bekoff, at the University of Colorado, argues that it shows that they are capable of feeling complex emotions, including grief. Furthermore, carrion crows show a neuronal response that correlates with their perception of a stimulus, which some scientists have argued to be an empirical marker of (avian/corvid) sensory consciousness—the conscious perception of sensory input—in the crows which do not have a cerebral cortex. A related study shows that the birds&#x27; pallium&#x27;s neuroarchitecture is reminiscent of the mammalian cortex.

====Tool use, memory, and complex rational thought====
There are also specific examples of corvid cleverness. One carrion crow was documented cracking nuts by placing them on a crosswalk, letting the passing cars crack the shell, waiting for the light to turn red, and then safely retrieving the contents. A group of crows in England took turns lifting garbage bin lids while their companions collected food.

Members of the corvid family have been known to watch other birds, remember where they hide their food, then return once the owner leaves. Corvids also move their food around between hiding places to avoid thievery—but only if they have previously been thieves themselves (that is, they remember previous relevant social contexts, use their own experience of having been a thief to predict the behavior of a pilferer, and can determine the safest course to protect their caches from being pilfered). Studies to assess similar cognitive abilities in apes have been inconclusive.

The ability to hide food requires highly accurate spatial memories. Corvids have been recorded to recall their food&#x27;s hiding places up to nine months later. It is suggested that vertical landmarks (like trees) are used to remember locations. There has also been evidence that California scrub jays, which store perishable foods, not only remember where they stored their food, but for how long. This has been compared to episodic memory, previously thought unique to humans.

New Caledonian crows (&quot;Corvus moneduloides&quot;) are notable for their highly developed tool fabrication. They make angling tools of twigs and leaves trimmed into hooks, and then subsequently use the hooks to pull insect larvae from tree holes. Tools are engineered according to task, and apparently, also to learned preferences. Recent studies revealed abilities to solve complicated problems, which suggested high levels of innovation of a complex nature. Other corvids that have been observed using tools include: the American crow, blue jay, and green jay. Researchers have discovered that New Caledonian crows do not just use single objects as tools—they can also construct novel compound tools through assemblage of otherwise non-functional elements. Diversity in tool design among corvids suggests cultural variation. Again, great apes are the only other animals known to use tools in such a fashion.

Clark&#x27;s nutcrackers and jackdaws were compared in a 2002 study based on geometric rule learning. The corvids, along with a domestic pigeon, had to locate a target between two landmarks, while distances and landmarks were altered. The nutcrackers were more accurate in their searches than the jackdaws and pigeons.

==== Implications and specific comparisons with other animals ====
The scarecrow is an archetypal scare tactic in the agricultural business. However, due to corvids&#x27; quick wit, scarecrows are soon ignored, and used as perches. Despite farmers&#x27; efforts to rid themselves of corvid pests, their attempts have only expanded corvid territories, and strengthened their numbers.

Contrary to earlier teleological classifications, in which they were seen as &quot;highest&quot; songbirds due to their intelligence, current systematics might place corvids—based on their total number of physical characteristics, instead of just their brains (which are the most developed of birds)—in the lower middle of the passerine evolutionary tree, dependent on which subgroup is chosen as the most derived. As per one observer:

The other major group of highly intelligent birds of the order Psittaciformes (which includes &#x27;true&#x27; parrots, cockatoos, and New Zealand parrots) is not closely related to corvids.

A study found that four-month-old ravens can have physical and social cognitive skills similar to that of adult great apes, and concluded that the &quot;dynamic of the different influences that, during ontogeny, contributes to adult cognition&quot; is required for the study of cognition.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1038/s41598-020-77060-8&quot;&gt; Available under CC BY 4.0.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disease==
Corvids are reservoirs (carriers) for the West Nile virus in the United States. They are infected by mosquitoes (the vectors), primarily of the &quot;Culex&quot; species. Crows and ravens are quickly killed by this disease, so their deaths are an early-warning system when West Nile virus arrives in an area (as are horses and other bird-species deaths). One of the first signs that West Nile virus first arrived in the US in 1999 was the death of crows in New York.

==Relationship with humans==
Several different corvids, particularly ravens, have occasionally served as pets, although they are not able to speak as readily as parrots, and are not suited to a caged environment.

It is illegal to own corvids, or any other migratory bird, without a permit in North America, due to the Migratory Bird Act.

Humans have been able to coexist with many members of the Corvidae family throughout history, most notably crows and ravens (see: &quot;Role in myth and culture&quot; section below). These positive interactions have extended into modern times.

===Role in myth and culture===

Folklore often represents corvids as clever, and even mystical, animals. Some Native Americans, such as the Haida, believed that a raven created the earth, and despite being a trickster spirit, ravens were popular on totems, credited with creating man, and considered responsible for placing the Sun in the sky.

Due to their carrion diet, the Celtic peoples strongly associated corvids with war, death, and the battlefield; their great intelligence meant that they were often considered messengers, or manifestations of the gods, such as Bendigeidfran (Welsh for &quot;Blessed Crow&quot;) or the Irish Morrigan (Middle Irish for &quot;Great Queen&quot;), both who were underworld deities that may be related to the later Arthurian Fisher King. The Welsh &quot;Dream of Rhonabwy&quot; illustrates well the association of ravens with war. In many parts of Britain, gatherings of crows, or more often magpies, are counted using the divination rhyme: &quot;one for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl, four for a boy, five for silver, six for gold, seven for a secret never to be told.&quot; Another rhyme is: &quot;one for sorrow, two for mirth, three for a funeral, four for a birth, five for heaven, six for hell, and seven for the Devil, his own sel.&quot; Cornish superstition holds that when a lone magpie is encountered, it must be loudly greeted with respect.

Various Germanic peoples highly revered the raven, and the raven was often depicted as a motif on shields or other war gear in Anglo-Saxon art, such as the Sutton Hoo burial, and Vendel period art. The major deity, Odin, was so commonly associated with ravens throughout history that he gained the kenning &quot;Raven God,&quot; and the raven banner was the flag of various Viking Age Scandinavian chieftains. Odin was also attended by Hugin and Munin, two ravens who flew all over the world, and whispered information they acquired into his ears. The Valravn sometimes appeared in modern Scandinavian folklore. On a shield and purse lid excavated among the Sutton Hoo treasures, imagery of stylised corvids with scrolled beaks are meticulously detailed in the decorative enamel work. The corvid symbolism reflected their common totemic status to the Anglo-Saxons, whose pre-Christian indigenous beliefs were of the same origin as that of the aforementioned Vikings.

The sixth century BCE Greek scribe Aesop featured corvids as intelligent antagonists in many fables. Later, in western literature, popularized by American poet Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s work &quot;The Raven&quot;, the common raven becomes a symbol of the main character&#x27;s descent into madness.

The children&#x27;s book &quot;Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH&quot; and its animated film adaptation features a protagonist crow named Jeremy.

===Status and conservation===
Unlike many other bird families, corvid fitness and reproduction, especially with many crows, has increased due to human development. The survival and reproductive success of certain crows and ravens is assisted by their close relationship with humans.

Human development provides additional resources by clearing land, creating shrublands rich in berries and insects. When the cleared land naturally replenishes, jays and crows use the young dense trees for nesting sites. Ravens typically use larger trees in denser forest.

Most corvids are not threatened, and many species are even increasing in population due to human activity. However, a few species are in danger. For example, the destruction of the Southeast Asian rainforest is endangering mixed-species feeding flocks with members from the family Corvidae. Also, since its semiarid scrubland habitat is an endangered ecosystem, the Florida scrub jay has a small and declining population. A number of island species, which are more vulnerable to introduced species and habitat loss, have been driven to extinction, such as the New Zealand raven, or are threatened, like the Mariana crow.

The American crow population of the United States has grown over the years. It is possible that the American crow, due to humans increasing suitable habitat, will cause Northwestern crows and fish crows to decline.

<text>Thomas Penson De Quincey (; Thomas Penson Quincey; 15 August 17858 December 1859) was an English writer, essayist, and literary critic, best known for his &quot;Confessions of an English Opium-Eater&quot; (1821). Many scholars suggest that in publishing this work De Quincey inaugurated the tradition of addiction literature in the West.

==Life and work==
===Child and student===
Thomas Penson Quincey was born at 86 Cross Street, Manchester, Lancashire. His father was a successful merchant with an interest in literature. Soon after Thomas&#x27;s birth, the family moved to &quot;The Farm&quot; and then later to Greenheys, a larger country house in Chorlton-on-Medlock near Manchester. In 1796, three years after the death of his father, Thomas Quincey, his mother – the erstwhile Elizabeth Penson – took the name De Quincey. That same year, his mother moved to Bath and enrolled him at King Edward&#x27;s School. He was a weak and sickly child. His youth was spent in solitude, and when his elder brother, William, came home, he wrought havoc in the quiet surroundings. De Quincey&#x27;s mother was a woman of strong character and intelligence but seems to have inspired more awe than affection in her children. She brought them up strictly, taking De Quincey out of school after three years because she was afraid he would become big-headed, and sending him to an inferior school at Wingfield, Wiltshire.

Around this time, in 1799, De Quincey first read &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot; by William Wordsworth and Coleridge. In 1800, De Quincey, aged 15, was ready for the University of Oxford; his scholarship was far in advance of his years. &quot;That boy could harangue an Athenian mob better than you or I could address an English one,&quot; his master at Bath said. He was sent to Manchester Grammar School, in order that after three years&#x27; stay he might obtain a scholarship to Brasenose College, Oxford, but he took flight after 19 months.

His first plan had been to reach Wordsworth, whose &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot; (1798) had consoled him in fits of depression and had awakened in him a deep reverence for the poet. But for that De Quincey was too timid, so he made his way to Chester, where his mother dwelt, in the hope of seeing a sister; he was caught by the older members of the family, but through the efforts of his uncle, Colonel Penson, he received the promise of a guinea () a week to carry out his later project of a solitary tramp through Wales. While on his journey around Wales and Snowdon, he avoided sleeping in inns to save what little money he had and instead lodged with cottagers or slept in a tent he had made himself. He sustained himself by eating blackberries and rose hips, only rarely getting enough proper food from the goodwill of strangers. From July to November 1802, De Quincey lived as a wayfarer. He soon lost his guinea by ceasing to keep his family informed of his whereabouts and had difficulty sustaining himself. Still, apparently fearing pursuit, he borrowed some money and travelled to London, where he tried to borrow more. Having failed, he lived close to starvation rather than return to his family.
Discovered by chance by his friends, De Quincey was brought home and finally allowed to go to Worcester College, Oxford, on a reduced income. Here, we are told, &quot;he came to be looked upon as a strange being who associated with no one.&quot; In 1804, while at Oxford, he began the occasional use of opium. He completed his studies, but failed to take the oral examination leading to a degree, and he left the university without graduating. He became an acquaintance of Coleridge and Wordsworth, having already sought out Charles Lamb in London. His acquaintance with Wordsworth led to his settling in 1809 at Grasmere in the Lake District. He lived for ten years in Dove Cottage, which Wordsworth had occupied and which is now a popular tourist attraction, and for another five years at Foxghyll Country House, Ambleside. De Quincey was married in 1816, and soon after, having no money left, he took up literary work in earnest.

He and his wife Margaret had eight children before her death in 1837. One of their sons, Paul Frederick de Quincey (1828–1894), emigrated to New Zealand.

===Journalist===

In July 1818, de Quincey became editor of the &quot;Westmorland Gazette&quot;, a Tory newspaper published in Kendal, after its first editor had been dismissed, but he was unreliable at meeting deadlines, and in June 1819 the proprietors complained about &quot;their dissatisfaction with the lack of &#x27;regular communication between the Editor and the Printer&#x27;&quot;, and he resigned in November 1819. His political sympathies tended towards the right. He was &quot;a champion of aristocratic privilege&quot; and &quot;reserved Jacobin as his highest term of opprobrium.&quot; Moreover, he held reactionary views on the Peterloo massacre and the Sepoy rebellion, on Catholic Emancipation, and on the enfranchisement of the common people.

De Quincey was also a proponent of British imperialism, believing it to be inherently just regardless of its cost. Despite his ideological commitment to personal identity and freedom that derived from his addiction to and struggles with opium, and in spite of his opposition to the notion of slavery, De Quincey aligned himself against the abolitionist movement in Britain. In his articles for &quot;The Edinburgh Post&quot;, on the issue in 1827 and 1828, he accused anti-slavery campaigners of running &quot;schemes of personal aggrandizement&quot;, and worried that abolition would undermine the basis of the British Empire and cause uprisings like the Haitian Revolution against colonial rule. Instead he proposed that there should be gradual reformation led by the slave-owners themselves.

===Translator and essayist===
In 1821, he went to London to dispose of some translations from German authors, but was persuaded first to write and publish an account of his opium experiences, which that year appeared in the &quot;London Magazine&quot;. His account proved to be a new sensation that eclipsed interest in Lamb&#x27;s &quot;Essays of Elia&quot;, which were then appearing in the same periodical. The &quot;Confessions of an English Opium-Eater&quot; were soon published in book form. De Quincey then made a number of new literary acquaintances. Thomas Hood found the shrinking author &quot;at home in a German ocean of literature, in a storm, flooding all the floor, the tables and the chairs—billows of books...&quot; De Quincey was a famed conversationalist. Richard Woodhouse wrote, &quot;His conversation appeared like the elaboration of a mine of results...&quot;

From this time on, De Quincey maintained himself by contributing to various magazines. He soon exchanged London and the Lakes for Edinburgh, the nearby village of Polton, and Glasgow, and he spent the remainder of his life in Scotland. In the 1830s, he was listed as living at 1 Forres Street, a large townhouse on the edge of the Moray Estate in Edinburgh.

&quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Edinburgh Magazine&quot; and its rival &quot;Tait&#x27;s Magazine&quot; received numerous contributions. &quot;Suspiria de Profundis&quot; (1845) appeared in Blackwood&#x27;s, as did &quot;The English Mail-Coach&quot; (1849). &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; (1847) was published in &quot;Tait&#x27;s&quot;. Between 1835 and 1849, &quot;Tait&#x27;s&quot; published a series of De Quincey&#x27;s reminiscences of Wordsworth, Coleridge, Robert Southey and other figures among the Lake Poets, a series that taken together constitutes one of his most important works.

==Financial pressures==

Along with his opium addiction, debt was one of the primary constraints of De Quincey&#x27;s adult life. De Quincey came into his patrimony at the age of 21, when he received £2,000 () from his late father&#x27;s estate. He was unwisely generous with his funds, making loans that could not or would not be repaid, including a £300 loan to Coleridge in 1807. After leaving Oxford without a degree, he made an attempt to study law, but desultorily and unsuccessfully; he had no steady income and spent large sums on books (he was a lifelong collector). By the 1820s he was constantly in financial difficulties. More than once in his later years, De Quincey was forced to seek protection from arrest in the debtors&#x27; sanctuary of Holyrood in Edinburgh. (At the time, Holyrood Park formed a debtors&#x27; sanctuary; people could not be arrested for debt within those bounds. The debtors who took sanctuary there could emerge only on Sundays, when arrests for debt were not allowed.) Yet De Quincey&#x27;s money problems persisted; he got into further difficulties for debts he incurred within the sanctuary.

His financial situation improved only later in his life. His mother&#x27;s death in 1846 brought him an income of £200 per year. When his daughters matured, they managed his budget more responsibly than he ever had himself.

==Medical issues==
De Quincey suffered neuralgic facial pain, &quot;trigeminal neuralgia&quot;  – &quot;attacks of piercing pain in the face, of such severity that they sometimes drive the victim to suicide.&quot; He reports using opium first in 1804 to relieve his neuralgia. Thus, as with many addicts, his opium addiction may have had a &quot;self-medication&quot; aspect for real physical illnesses, as well as a psychological aspect. 

By his own testimony, De Quincey first used opium in 1804 to relieve his neuralgia; he used it for pleasure, but no more than weekly, through 1812. It was in 1813 that he first commenced daily usage, in response to illness and his grief over the death of Wordsworth&#x27;s young daughter Catherine. During 1813–1819 his daily dose was very high, and resulted in the sufferings recounted in the final sections of his &quot;Confessions&quot;. For the rest of his life, his opium use fluctuated between extremes; he took &quot;enormous doses&quot; in 1843, but late in 1848 he went for 61 days with none at all. There are many theories surrounding the effects of opium on literary creation, and notably, his periods of low use were literarily unproductive. From 1842 until 1859 he spent long periods in a cottage near Midfield House south of Lasswade, assembling his writings in the peace of the countryside.

==Death==
He died in his rooms on 42 Lothian Street, in south Edinburgh, and was buried in St Cuthbert&#x27;s Church yard at the west end of Princes Street. His stone, in the southwest section of the churchyard on a west-facing wall, is plain and says nothing of his work. His residence on Lothian Street was demolished in the 1970s to make way for the Edinburgh University student center.

==Collected works==
During the final decade of his life, De Quincey labored on a collected edition of his works. He believed the task was impossible. Ticknor and Fields, a Boston publishing house, first proposed such a collection and solicited De Quincey&#x27;s approval and co-operation. It was only when De Quincey, a chronic procrastinator, failed to answer repeated letters from James Thomas Fields that the American publisher proceeded independently, reprinting the author&#x27;s works from their original magazine appearances. Twenty-two volumes of &quot;De Quincey&#x27;s Writings&quot; were issued from 1851 to 1859.

The existence of the American edition prompted a corresponding British edition. Since the spring of 1850, De Quincey had been a regular contributor to an Edinburgh periodical called &quot;Hogg&#x27;s Weekly Instructor&quot;, whose publisher, James Hogg, undertook to publish &quot;Selections Grave and Gay from Writings Published and Unpublished by Thomas De Quincey&quot;. De Quincey edited and revised his works for the Hogg edition; the 1856 second edition of the &quot;Confessions&quot; was prepared for inclusion in &quot;Selections Grave and Gay…&quot;. The first volume of that edition appeared in May 1853, and the fourteenth and last in January 1860, a month after the author&#x27;s death. Both of these were multi-volume collections, yet made no pretence to be complete. Scholar and editor David Masson attempted a more definitive collection: &quot;The Works of Thomas De Quincey&quot; appeared in fourteen volumes in 1889 and 1890. Yet De Quincey&#x27;s writings were so voluminous and widely dispersed that further collections followed: two volumes of &quot;The Uncollected Writings&quot; (1890), and two volumes of &quot;Posthumous Works&quot; (1891–93). De Quincey&#x27;s 1803 diary was published in 1927. Another volume, &quot;New Essays by De Quincey&quot;, appeared in 1966.

==Influence==

His immediate influence extended to Edgar Allan Poe, Fitz Hugh Ludlow, Charles Baudelaire and Nikolai Gogol, but even major 20th-century writers such as Jorge Luis Borges admired and claimed to be partly influenced by his work. Berlioz also loosely based his &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot; on &quot;Confessions of an English Opium-Eater&quot;, drawing on the theme of the internal struggle with one&#x27;s self.

Dario Argento used De Quincey&#x27;s &quot;Suspiria&quot;, particularly &quot;Levana and Our Ladies of Sorrow&quot;, as an inspiration for his &quot;Three Mothers&quot; trilogy of films, which include &quot;Suspiria&quot;, &quot;Inferno&quot; and &quot;The Mother of Tears&quot;. This influence carried over into Luca Guadagnino&#x27;s 2018 version of the film.

Shelby Hughes created &quot;Jynxies Natural Habitat&quot;, an online archive of stamp art on glassine heroin bags, under the pseudonym &quot;Dequincey Jinxey&quot;, in reference to De Quincey. She also used the pseudonym in interviews related to the archive.

De Quincey&#x27;s accomplished mastery of Greek was widely known and respected in the 1800s. Treadwell Walden, Episcopal priest and sometime rector of St. Paul&#x27;s Church, Boston, quotes a letter from De Quincey&#x27;s &quot;Autobiographic Sketches&quot; in support of his 1881 treatise about the mistranslation of the word metanoia into &quot;repent&quot; by most English translations of the Bible.

<text>The Polynesian languages form a genealogical group of languages, itself part of the Oceanic branch of the Austronesian family.

There are 38 Polynesian languages, representing 7 percent of the 522 Oceanic languages, and 3 percent of the Austronesian family. While half of them are spoken in geographical Polynesia (the Polynesian triangle), the other half – known as Polynesian outliers – are spoken in other parts of the Pacific: from Micronesia to atolls scattered in Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands or Vanuatu. The most prominent Polynesian languages, by number of speakers, are Samoan, Tongan, Tahitian, Māori and Hawaiian.

The ancestors of modern Polynesians were Lapita navigators, who settled in the Tonga and Samoa areas about 3,000 years ago. Linguists and archaeologists estimate that this first population went through common development during about 1000 years, giving rise to Proto-Polynesian, the linguistic ancestor of all modern Polynesian languages. After that period of shared development, the Proto-Polynesian society split into several descendant populations, as Polynesian navigators scattered around various archipelagoes across the Pacific – some travelling westwards to already populated areas, others navigating eastwards and settling in new territories (Society Islands, Marquesas, Hawaii, New Zealand, Rapa Nui, etc.).

Still today, Polynesian languages show strong similarity, particularly cognate words in their vocabulary; this includes culturally important words such as &quot;tapu&quot;, &quot;ariki&quot;, &quot;motu&quot;, &quot;fenua&quot;, &quot;kava&quot;, and &quot;tapa&quot; as well as , the mythical homeland for some of the cultures.

==Internal classification==

===History of classification===
The contemporary classification of the Polynesian languages began with certain observations by Andrew Pawley in 1966 based on shared innovations in phonology, vocabulary and grammar showing that the East Polynesian languages were more closely related to Samoan than they were to Tongan, calling Tongan and its nearby relative Niuean &quot;Tongic&quot; and Samoan and all other Polynesian languages of the study &quot;Nuclear Polynesian&quot;.

Previously, there had been lexicostatistical studies that squarely suggested a &quot;West Polynesian&quot; group composed of at least Tongan and Samoan and that an &quot;East Polynesian&quot; group was equally distant from both Tongan and Samoan.

Pawley published another study in 1967. It began the process of extracting relationships from Polynesian languages on small islands in Melanesia, the &quot;Polynesian Outliers&quot;, whose languages Pawley was able to trace to East Futuna in the case of those farther south and perhaps to Samoa itself in the case of those more to the north.

Except for some minor differentiation of the East Polynesian tree, further study paused for almost twenty years until Wilson published a study of Polynesian pronominal systems in 1985 suggesting that there was a special relationship between the East Polynesian languages and all other Nuclear Polynesian but for Futunic, and calling that extra-Futunic group the &quot;Ellicean languages&quot;. Furthermore, East Polynesian was found to more likely have emerged from extra-Samoan Ellicean than out of Samoa itself, in contradiction to the long assumption of a Samoan homeland for the origins of East Polynesian. Wilson named this new group &quot;Ellicean&quot; after the pre-independence name of Tuvalu and presented evidence for subgroups within that overarching category.

Marck, in 2000, was able to offer some support for some aspects of Wilson&#x27;s suggestion through comparisons of shared sporadic (irregular, unexpected) sound changes, e. g., Proto-Polynesian and Proto-Nuclear-Polynesian *mafu &#x27;to heal&#x27; becoming Proto-Ellicean *mafo. This was made possible by the massive Polynesian language comparative lexicon (&quot;Pollex&quot; – with reconstructions) of Biggs and Clark.

===Internal correspondences===
Partly because Polynesian languages split from one another comparatively recently, many words in these languages remain similar to corresponding words in others. The table below demonstrates this with the words for &#x27;sky&#x27;, &#x27;north wind&#x27;, &#x27;woman&#x27;, &#x27;house&#x27; and &#x27;parent&#x27; in a representative selection of languages: Tongan; Niuean; Samoan; Sikaiana; Takuu; North Marquesan; South Marquesan; Mangarevan; Hawaiian; Rapanui language; Tahitian; Māori and Cook Islands Māori (Rarotongan).

Certain regular correspondences can be noted between different Polynesian languages. For example, the Māori sounds , , , and correspond to , , , and in Hawaiian. Accordingly, &quot;man&quot; is &quot;tangata&quot; in Māori and &quot;kanaka&quot; in Hawaiian, and Māori &quot;roa&quot; &quot;long&quot; corresponds to Hawaiian &quot;loa&quot;. The famous Hawaiian greeting &quot;aloha&quot; corresponds to Māori &quot;aroha&quot;, &quot;love, tender emotion&quot;. Similarly, the Hawaiian word for kava is &quot;awa&quot;.

Similarities in basic vocabulary may allow speakers from different island groups to achieve a significant degree of understanding of each other&#x27;s speech. When a particular language shows unexpectedly large divergence in vocabulary, this may be the result of a name-avoidance taboo situation – see examples in Tahitian, where this has happened often.

Many Polynesian languages have been greatly affected by European colonization. Both Māori and Hawaiian, for example, have lost many speakers to English, and only since the 1990s have they resurged in popularity.

==Grammatical characteristics==
===Personal pronouns===
In general, Polynesian languages have three numbers for pronouns and possessives: singular, dual and plural. For example, in Māori: &quot;ia&quot; (he/she), &quot;rāua&quot; (they two), &quot;rātou&quot; (they 3 or more). The words &quot;rua&quot; (2) and &quot;toru&quot; (3) are still discernible in endings of the dual and plural pronouns, giving the impression that the plural was originally a trial (threesome) or paucal (a few), and that an original plural has disappeared.
Polynesian languages have four distinctions in pronouns and possessives: first exclusive, first inclusive, second and third. For example, in Māori, the plural pronouns are: &quot;mātou&quot; (we, exc), &quot;tātou&quot; (we, inc), &quot;koutou&quot; (you), &quot;rātou&quot; (they). The difference between exclusive and inclusive is the treatment of the person addressed. &quot;Mātou&quot; refers to the speaker and others but not the person or persons spoken to (i.e., &quot;I and some others, but not you&quot;), while &quot;tātou&quot; refers to the speaker, the person or persons spoken to, and everyone else (i.e., &quot;You and I and others&quot;).

===&quot;a&quot; and &quot;o&quot; possession===
Many Polynesian languages distinguish two possessives. The a-possessives (as they contain that letter in most cases), also known as subjective possessives, refer to possessions that must be acquired by one&#x27;s own action (alienable possession). The o-possessives or objective possessives refer to possessions that are fixed to someone, unchangeable, and do not necessitate any action on one&#x27;s part but upon which actions can still be performed by others (inalienable possession). Some words can take either form, often with a difference in meaning. One example is the Samoan word , which takes the o-possessive in (her breast) and the a-possessive in (her breastmilk). Compare also the particles used in the names of two of the books of the Māori Bible: (The Book of Jeremiah) with (The Book of Joshua); the former belongs to Jeremiah in the sense that he was the author, but the Book of Joshua was written by someone else about Joshua. The distinction between one&#x27;s birth village and one&#x27;s current residence village can be made similarly.

===Numerals in Polynesian languages===
Numerals:
==Orthography==
Written Polynesian languages use orthography based on Latin script. Most Polynesian languages have five vowel qualities, corresponding roughly to those written &quot;i, e, a, o, u&quot; in classical Latin. However, orthographic conventions for phonemes that are not easily encoded in standard Latin script had to develop over time. Influenced by the traditions of orthographies of languages they were familiar with, the missionaries who first developed orthographies for unwritten Polynesian languages did not explicitly mark phonemic vowel length or the glottal stop. By the time that linguists trained in more modern methods made their way to the Pacific, at least for the major languages, the Bible was already printed according to the orthographic system developed by the missionaries, and the people had learned to read and write without marking vowel length or the glottal stop.

This situation persists in many languages. Despite efforts at reform by local academies, the general conservative resistance to orthographic change has led to varying results in Polynesian languages, and several writing variants co-exist. The most common method, however, uses a macron to indicate a long vowel, while a vowel without that diacritical mark is short, for example, ā versus a. Sometimes, a long vowel is instead written double, e.g. &quot;Maaori&quot;.

The glottal stop (not present in all Polynesian languages, but, where present, one of the most common consonants) is indicated by an apostrophe, for example, &#x27;a versus a. Hawaiʻian uses the ʻokina, also called by several other names, a unicameral consonant letter used within the Latin script to mark the phonemic glottal stop. It is also used in many other Polynesian languages, each of which has its own name for the character. Apart from the ʻokina or the somewhat similar Tahitian ʻeta, a common method is to change the simple apostrophe for a curly one, taking a normal apostrophe for the elision and the inverted comma for the glottal stop. The latter method has come into common use in Polynesian languages.

<doc id="162595" wikidata="Q2387015" url="?curid=162595" title="Tactical frivolity">
<text>Tactical frivolity is a form of public protest involving humour; often including peaceful non-compliance with authorities, carnival and whimsical antics. Humour has played a role in political protests at least as far back as the Classical period in ancient Greece. However, it is only since the 1990s that the term &quot;tactical frivolity&quot; gained common currency for describing the use of humour in opposing perceived political injustice. Generally, the term is used to denote a whimsical, nonconfrontational approach rather than aggressive mocking or cutting jokes.

==History of humour in political protest==

The study of humour by social historians did not become popular until the early 1980s and the literature on this subject studying periods before the 20th century is relatively sparse. An exception is the frequently cited Rabelais and His World by Mikhail Bakhtin, a Russian scholar considered by some to be the most important thinker of the 20th century. The work discusses the life and times of the writer and satirist François Rabelais with emphases on what the author considers to be the powerful role of humour in medieval and early times. Carnivals, Satire and the French folk custom of Charivari were discussed as mediums that allowed the lower classes to use humour to highlight unjust behaviour by the upper classes. These humorous protests were generally tolerated by the ruling authorities. Examples of the use of humour for political protest even from Classical times, such as the play Lysistrata by ancient Greek dramatist Aristophanes, have been described as &quot;Rabeleisan protest&quot;.
Studies of hunter gather tribes thought to have systems of social organisation that have changed little since prehistoric times, have found that ridicule or anger is used by many tribes to oppose any individual who tries to assume authority in a way that violates the tribe&#x27;s egalitarian norms. Tribes observed to show this behaviour include the !Kung, Mbuti, Naskapi and Hazda.
An example of a political protest making extensive use of humour in early modern times was the 17th century British movement, the Levellers.
There is much more extensive literature covering the use of humour by the protest movements which emerged in the 20th century.

In the United States, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, and the Yippies were well-known users of frivolous tactics. Active in the 1960s and 1970s, their actions included dropping money onto the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange, running a pig as a candidate for president, and &quot;levitating&quot; the Pentagon. 

One of the earliest protest groups whose use of humour has been specifically described as &quot;tactical frivolity&quot; is the Orange Alternative, a movement that emerged in Poland during the early 1980s as a part of the broader Solidarity campaign. They made extensive use of visual jokes and theatrical stunts to protest against oppression by the authorities. A common theme was to dress up as elves (sometimes translated dwarves or gnomes). Orange Alternative have been described as the most &quot;influential of the solidarity factions&quot;, central to enabling the overall movement to prevail, due in part to the success their comedic &quot;happenings&quot; enjoyed in attracting the attention of the world&#x27;s media. 
A protest movement described as partly responsible for popularising the contemporary use of &quot;Tactical Frivolity&quot; is Reclaim the Streets (&quot;RTS&quot;). They formed in 1991 in Great Britain, inspired in part by the anti-road protests of the previous decades and in part by the Situationists. As the 1990s advanced, RTS inspired splinter groups in other countries across the world, and was heavily involved in organising the international Carnival against Capitalism—an anti-capitalism event held in many cities simultaneously on June 18, 1999. &quot;Carnival against Capitalism&quot;, frequently known as &quot;J18&quot;, is sometimes credited as being the first of the major international anti-capitalist protests. &quot;RTS&quot; have reported that many of their organisers were inspired by independently reading the work of Bakhtin.

==In international anti-capitalist protests==

Large scale International anti-capitalist protests are widely seen as dawning between 1998 and 2000 with events such as the protests at the Birmingham 1998 G8, &quot;J18&quot;, the Seattle 1999 WTO protests and the Prague 2000 IMF protests.

The 1999 Seattle demonstrations saw extensive violent clashes with the police. For the 2000 protest in Prague, demonstrators divided themselves into three broad groupings based in part on the way they wished to engage with the authorities. There was a &quot;Yellow march&quot; for traditional non violent protest, a &quot;Blue march&quot; for those who were up for physically taking on the police, and a &quot;Silver and Pink&quot; group which is described as employing &quot;tactical frivolity&quot;, this group being the most successful in terms of penetrating the security cordon around the IMF meeting. Attending Prague was also a small group specifically calling itself &quot;Tactical Frivolity&quot;, which consisted of a Samba band plus thirteen women from Yorkshire dressed as pink fairies.

Ten months later, a group of protesters dressed in carnival outfits and again calling themselves the Pink and Silver bloc, or &quot;Pink Fairies&quot;, used the term &quot;tactical frivolity&quot; to describe their own methods when protesting at the 27th G8 summit in Genoa. These included waving &quot;magic fairy wands&quot; at the police and training &quot;radical cheerleaders,&quot; as well as the deployment of a &quot;revolutionary spaghetti catapult&quot; designed to &quot;splatter the leaders with pasta&quot;. The device failed to hit any leaders with spaghetti, but, according to journalist Johann Hari, the &quot;Pink Fairies&quot; did succeed in causing mass laughter among the crowds.

In the early 21st century, tactical frivolity was often used at much smaller events than global summits; for example, the group Billionaires for Bush would stage humorous events at US Republican conventions. Similar actions and pranks were staged in Australia during the 2004 federal election by the John Howard Ladies’ Auxiliary Fan Club, named for the country&#x27;s conservative Prime Minister. According to David Graeber, this upswell in the use of humorous protest tactics can be traced in part to the Yippies of the 1960s and the Zapatista, which began operations in the 1990s.

At the 2005 G8 summit in Scotland, tactical frivolity was again used by protesters such as the Clandestine Insurgent Rebel Clown Army a group whose theatrical and carnival like performances succeeded in attracting considerable media attention and were funded by Arts Council England.
The large scale use of tactical frivolity at the 2001 and 2005 G8 protests failed to deliver any tangible change in policy, but the method continued to be used, for example at protests held concerning air travel at Heathrow, England during 2007.

Tactical frivolity was used at the 2011 London anti-cuts protest. Some of the &quot;tactical frivolity protestors&quot; integrated fully into the main march; others trailed in the wake of black bloc anarchists, while remaining non violent themselves.
Adbusters, the magazine credited for starting the global Occupy movement, called for Occupiers to use tactical frivolity, though the method has only been used sporadically. Author and academic Luke Bretherton has suggested that tactical frivolity allows protestors to represent the otherwise inexpressible sacred power of imagination, which is achieved partly through the &quot;use of huge puppets, dance and street theatre&quot;.

==Ku Klux Klan counter protests==
Klan marches reliably attract counter protests.
*Molly Ivins describes one: &quot;A recent Ku Klux Klan rally in Austin produced an eccentric counter- demonstration. When the fifty Klansmen appeared (they were bused in from Waco) in front of the state capitol, they were greeted by five thousand locals who had turned out for a &#x27;Moon the Klan&#x27; rally. Citizens dropped trou both singly and in groups, occasionally producing a splendid wave effect. It was a swell do.&quot;
*In North Carolina, a group of clowns shouting &quot;wife power&quot; and throwing white flour outnumbered and outshouted the Klansmen.
*In South Carolina, Matt Buck humiliated the KKK simply by walking with them while performing on his sousaphone.

<doc id="162597" wikidata="Q355725" url="?curid=162597" title="Guerrilla communication">
<text>Guerrilla communication and communication guerrilla refer to an attempt to provoke subversive effects through interventions in the process of communication.
It can be distinguished from other classes of political action because it is not based on the critique of the dominant discourses but in the interpretation of the signs in a different way. Its main goal is to make a critical non-questioning of the existing, for reasons ranging from political activism to marketing. In terms of marketing, journalist Warren Berger explains unconventional guerrilla-style advertising as &quot;something that lurks all around, hits us where we live, and invariably takes us by surprise&quot;. These premises apply to the entire spectrum of guerrilla communication because each tactic intends to disrupt cognitive schemas and thought processing.

The term was created in 1997 by Luther Blissett and Sonja Brünzels, with the publication of &quot;Kommunication Guerrilla Handbook&quot; (originally in German, translated in 2001 to Spanish and Italian). Both pertain to &quot;autonome a.f.r.i.k.a gruppe&quot;, which includes many people involved in communication guerrillas such as activists and non-artists living in different German peripheries. However, it was used before in 1984 by Jay Conrad Levinson, as a marketing strategy for small businesses.

==Forms==
One form of guerrilla communication is the creation of a ritual via participative public spectacle to disrupt or protest a public event or to shift the perspectives of passers-by. Such spectacles often take the form of street and guerrilla theater. Another way to create such spectacle is via tactical frivolity.
Pie-throwing as performance art is a form of guerrilla communication. Other forms of guerrilla communication include adbusting, graffiti, hacktivism (notably cybersquatting), and reclaiming.

An example of guerrilla communication are the demonstrations taking place since 15 May 2011 in Spain and cities in other countries, such as London, Berlin or Paris. These demonstrations, organized through the Internet, are trying to create awareness among the population about other ways to manage governments, using the motto &quot;Real Democracy NOW!&quot;

==Main methods of action==
Generally, the techniques and methods used are guided by two principles: distanciation and over-identification.

Distanciation is based on subtle modifications in the regular representation, which lights new aspects of the representation and produces by displacement, new meanings unforecast. It consists on taking images, ideas and forms to change the communication process or its usual presentation to create confusion and reconsideration about each own cultural grammar. The new elements in the communication process create perturbations, which are effective to offer a critic vision to general public in front of the traditional point of view. The goal of this method is to create distance in front the existing to gain a new perspective. For example, in the mid-1990s the ad agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky employed distanciation in order to raise support for a local homeless shelter. Their method included printing posters on dumpsters that said &quot;kitchen&quot; and a &quot;House&quot; poster was placed on bus shelters. Creative director Bogusky had the notion that the homeless &quot;live in separate culture, where things take on new meanings- a bench becomes your bed; a shopping cart becomes your closet&quot;. In this case, distinction confronts the passers-by to re-consider the traditional concept of &quot;home&quot; and how this seemingly basic concept is not applicable to homeless people.

On the other hand, over-identification means to publicly express those aspects which are well known but still taboo, or consciously disregarded. An effective way of subversion may consist in expressing positively the hidden aspects of the communication in a convincing way, better if it is close to the system dominant logic. This is a call to the background parts of the message not always seen but felt. Another example of over-identification exists in the work of street artist Banksy. In October 2003 he entered the landscape room at the Tate Britain, removed a framed painting from his bag, and glued it to the wall. Beside the work, a rural scene with an image of police tape stenciled over it, the artist placed a card reading: &quot;Banksy 1975. Crimewatch UK Has Ruined The Countryside For All Of Us. 2003. Oil On Canvas.&quot; As mentioned prior, this installation ensures that the &quot;felt message&quot; is also the &quot;seen message&quot;. It is a reaction to a culturally dominating institution, Crimewatch UK. It was accomplished in a guerrilla-esque, under-the-radar manner, and it also amplifies a consensus of sentiments towards such institutions.

<text>Hacktivism (or hactivism; a portmanteau of &quot;hack&quot; and &quot;activism&quot;), is the use of computer-based techniques such as hacking as a form of civil disobedience to promote a political agenda or social change. A form of Internet activism with roots in hacker culture and hacker ethics, its ends are often related to free speech, human rights, or freedom of information movements.

Hacktivist activities span many political ideals and issues. Hyphanet, a peer-to-peer platform for censorship-resistant communication, is a prime example of translating political thought and freedom of speech into code. Hacking as a form of activism can be carried out by a singular activist or through a network of activists, such as Anonymous and WikiLeaks, working in collaboration toward common goals without an overarching authority figure. For context, according to a statement by the U.S. Justice Department, Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, plotted with hackers connected to the &quot;Anonymous&quot; and &quot;LulzSec&quot; groups, who have been linked to multiple cyberattacks worldwide. In 2012, Assange, who was being held in the United Kingdom on a request for extradition from the United States, gave the head of LulzSec a list of targets to hack and informed him that the most significant leaks of compromised material would come from the National Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency, or the New York Times.

&quot;Hacktivism&quot; is a controversial term with several meanings. The word was coined to characterize electronic direct action as working toward social change by combining programming skills with critical thinking. But just as &quot;hack&quot; can sometimes mean cyber crime, &quot;hacktivism&quot; can be used to mean activism that is malicious, destructive, and undermining the security of the Internet as a technical, economic, and political platform. In comparison to previous forms of social activism, hacktivism has had unprecedented success, bringing in more participants, using more tools, and having more influence in that it has the ability to alter elections, begin conflicts, and take down businesses.

According to the United States 2020–2022 Counterintelligence Strategy, in addition to state adversaries and transnational criminal organizations, &quot;ideologically motivated entities such as hacktivists, leaktivists, and public disclosure organizations, also pose significant threats&quot;.

== Origins and definitions ==
Writer Jason Sack first used the term hacktivism in a 1995 article in conceptualizing New Media artist Shu Lea Cheang&#x27;s film &quot;Fresh Kill&quot;. However, the term is frequently attributed to the Cult of the Dead Cow (cDc) member &quot;Omega,&quot; who used it in a 1996 e-mail to the group. Due to the variety of meanings of its root words, the definition of hacktivism is nebulous and there exists significant disagreement over the kinds of activities and purposes it encompasses. Some definitions include acts of cyberterrorism while others simply reaffirm the use of technological hacking to effect social change.

==Forms and methods==
Self-proclaimed &quot;hacktivists&quot; often work anonymously, sometimes operating in groups while other times operating as a lone wolf with several cyber-personas all corresponding to one activist within the cyberactivism umbrella that has been gaining public interest and power in pop-culture. Hacktivists generally operate under apolitical ideals and express uninhibited ideas or abuse without being scrutinized by society while representing or defending themselves publicly under an anonymous identity giving them a sense of power in the cyberactivism community.

In order to carry out their operations, hacktivists might create new tools; or integrate or use a variety of software tools readily available on the Internet. One class of hacktivist activities includes increasing the accessibility of others to take politically motivated action online.

Repertoire of contention of hacktivism includes among others:

# Code: Software and websites can achieve political goals. For example, the encryption software PGP can be used to secure communications; PGP&#x27;s author, Phil Zimmermann said he distributed it first to the peace movement. Jim Warren suggests PGP&#x27;s wide dissemination was in response to Senate Bill 266, authored by Senators Biden and DeConcini, which demanded that &quot;...communications systems permit the government to obtain the plain text contents of voice, data, and other communications...&quot;. WikiLeaks is an example of a politically motivated website: it seeks to &quot;keep governments open&quot;.
# Mirroring: Website mirroring is used as a circumvention tool in order to bypass various censorship blocks on websites. This technique copies the contents of a censored website and disseminates it on other domains and sub-domains that are not censored. Document mirroring, similar to website mirroring, is a technique that focuses on backing up various documents and other works. RECAP is software that was written with the purpose to &#x27;liberate US case law&#x27; and make it openly available online. The software project takes the form of distributed document collection and archival. Major mirroring projects include initiatives such as the Internet Archive and Wikisource. 
# Anonymity: A method of speaking out to a wide audience about human rights issues, government oppression, etc. that utilizes various web tools such as free and/or disposable email accounts, IP masking, and blogging software to preserve a high level of anonymity.
# Doxing: The practice in which private and/or confidential documents and records are hacked into and made public. Hacktivists see this as a form of assured transparency, experts claim it is harassment. 
# Denial-of-service attacks: These attacks, commonly referred to as DoS attacks, use large arrays of personal and public computers that hackers take control of via malware executable files usually transmitted through email attachments or website links. After taking control, these computers act like a herd of zombies, redirecting their network traffic to one website, with the intention of overloading servers and taking a website offline.
#Virtual sit-ins: Similar to DoS attacks but executed by individuals rather than software, a large number of protesters visit a targeted website and rapidly load pages to overwhelm the site with network traffic to slow the site or take it offline.
#Website defacements: Hackers infiltrate a web server to replace a specific web page with one of their own, usually to convey a specific message.
#Website redirects: This method involves changing the address of a website within the server so would-be visitors of the site are redirected to a site created by the perpetrator, typically to denounce the original site.
# Geo-bombing: A technique in which netizens add a geo-tag while editing YouTube videos so that the location of the video can be seen in Google Earth.
# Protestware: The use of malware to promote a social cause or protest. Protestware is self-inflicted by a project&#x27;s maintainer in order to spread a message; most commonly in a disruptive manner. The term was popularized during the Russo-Ukrainian War after the peacenotwar supply chain attack on the npm ecosystem.

==Controversy==
Depending on who is using the term, hacktivism can be a politically motivated technology hack, a constructive form of anarchic civil disobedience, or an undefined anti-systemic gesture. It can signal anticapitalist or political protest; it can denote anti-spam activists, security experts, or open source advocates.

Some people describing themselves as hacktivists have taken to defacing websites for political reasons, such as attacking and defacing websites of governments and those who oppose their ideology. Others, such as Oxblood Ruffin (the &quot;foreign affairs minister&quot; of Cult of the Dead Cow and Hacktivismo), have argued forcefully against definitions of hacktivism that include web defacements or denial-of-service attacks.

Hacktivism is often seen as shadowy due to its anonymity, commonly attributed to the work of fringe groups and outlying members of society. The lack of responsible parties to be held accountable for the social-media attacks performed by hactivists has created implications in corporate and federal security measures both on and offline.

While some self-described hacktivists have engaged in DoS attacks, critics suggest that DoS attacks are an attack on free speech and that they have unintended consequences. DoS attacks waste resources and they can lead to a &quot;DoS war&quot; that nobody will win. In 2006, Blue Security attempted to automate a DoS attack against spammers; this led to a massive DoS attack against Blue Security which knocked them, their old ISP and their DNS provider off the Internet, destroying their business.

Following denial-of-service attacks by Anonymous on multiple sites, in reprisal for the apparent suppression of WikiLeaks, John Perry Barlow, a founding member of the EFF, said &quot;I support freedom of expression, no matter whose, so I oppose DDoS attacks regardless of their target... they&#x27;re the poison gas of cyberspace...&quot;. On the other hand, Jay Leiderman, an attorney for many hacktivists, argues that DDoS can be a legitimate form of protest speech in situations that are reasonably limited in time, place and manner.

==Notable hacktivist events==
*In late 1990s, the Hong Kong Blondes helped Chinese citizens get access to blocked websites by targeting the Chinese computer networks. The group identified holes in the Chinese internet system, particularly in the area of satellite communications. The leader of the group, Blondie Wong, also described plans to attack American businesses that were partnering with China.
*In 1996, the title of the United States Department of Justice&#x27;s homepage was changed to &quot;Department of Injustice&quot;. Pornographic images were also added to the homepage to protest the Communications Decency Act.
*In 1998, members of the Electronic Disturbance Theater created FloodNet, a web tool that allowed users to participate in DDoS attacks (or what they called electronic civil disobedience) in support of Zapatista rebels in Chiapas.
*In December 1998, a hacktivist group from the US called Legions of the Underground emerged. They declared a cyberwar against Iraq and China and planned on disabling internet access in retaliation for the countries&#x27; human rights abuses. Opposing hackers criticized this move by Legions of the Underground, saying that by shutting down internet systems, the hacktivist group would have no impact on providing free access to information.
*In July 2001, Hacktivismo, a sect of the Cult of the Dead Cow, issued the &quot;Hacktivismo Declaration&quot;. This served as a code of conduct for those participating in hacktivism, and declared the hacker community&#x27;s goals of stopping &quot;state-sponsored censorship of the Internet&quot; as well as affirming the rights of those therein to &quot;freedom of opinion and expression&quot;.
* During the 2009 Iranian election protests, Anonymous played a role in disseminating information to and from Iran by setting up the website Anonymous Iran; they also released a video manifesto to the Iranian government.
* Google worked with engineers from SayNow and Twitter to provide communications for the Egyptian people in response to the government sanctioned Internet blackout during the 2011 protests. The result, Speak To Tweet, was a service in which voicemail left by phone was then tweeted via Twitter with a link to the voice message on Google&#x27;s SayNow.
*On Saturday 29 May 2010 a hacker calling himself &#x27;Kaka Argentine&#x27; hacked into the Ugandan State House website and posted a conspicuous picture of Adolf Hitler with the swastika, a Nazi Party symbol.
* During the Egyptian Internet black out, January 28 – February 2, 2011, Telecomix provided dial up services, and technical support for the Egyptian people. Telecomix released a video stating their support of the Egyptian people, describing their efforts to provide dial-up connections, and offering methods to avoid internet filters and government surveillance. The hacktivist group also announced that they were closely tracking radio frequencies in the event that someone was sending out important messages.
* Project Chanology, also known as &quot;Operation Chanology&quot;, was a hacktivist protest against the Church of Scientology to punish the church for participating in Internet censorship relating to the removal of material from a 2008 interview with Church of Scientology member Tom Cruise. Hacker group Anonymous attempted to &quot;expel the church from the Internet&quot; via DDoS attacks. In February 2008 the movement shifted toward legal methods of nonviolent protesting. Several protests were held as part of Project Chanology, beginning in 2008 and ending in 2009.
*On June 3, 2011, LulzSec took down a website of the FBI. This was the first time they had targeted a website that was not part of the private sector. That week, the FBI was able to track the leader of LulzSec, Hector Xavier Monsegur.
*On June 20, 2011, LulzSec targeted the Serious Organised Crime Agency of the United Kingdom, causing UK authorities to take down the website.
*In August 2011 a member of Anonymous working under the name &quot;Oliver Tucket&quot; took control of the Syrian Defense Ministry website and added an Israeli government web portal in addition to changing the mail server for the website to one belonging to the Chinese navy.
* Anonymous and New World Hackers claimed responsibility for the 2016 Dyn cyberattack in retaliation for Ecuador&#x27;s rescinding Internet access to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at their embassy in London. WikiLeaks alluded to the attack. Subsequently, FlashPoint stated that the attack was most likely done by script kiddies.
* In 2013, as an online component to the Million Mask March, Anonymous in the Philippines crashed 30 government websites and posted a YouTube video to congregate people in front of the parliament house on November 5 to demonstrate their disdain toward the Filipino government. 
* In 2014, Sony Pictures Entertainment was hacked by a group by the name of Guardians Of Peace (GOP) who obtained over 100 Terabytes of data including unreleased films, employee salary, social security data, passwords, and account information. GOP hacked various social media accounts and hijacked them by changing their passwords to diespe123 (die pictures entertainment) and posting threats on the pages.
* In 2016, Turkish programmer Azer Koçulu removed his software package, left-pad, from npm, causing a cascading failure of other software packages that contained left-pad as a dependency. This was done after Kik, a messaging application, threatened legal action against Koçulu after he refused to rename his codice_1 package. npm ultimately sided with Kik, prompting Koçulu to unpublish all of his packages from npm in protest, including left-pad.
* British hacker Kane Gamble, who was sentenced to 2 years in youth detention, posed as John Brennan, the then director of the CIA, and Mark F. Giuliano, a former deputy director of the FBI, to access highly sensitive information. The judge said Gamble engaged in &quot;politically motivated cyber-terrorism.&quot;
* In 2021, Anonymous hacked and leaked the databases of American web hosting company Epik.
* As a response against 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Anonymous performed multiple cyberattacks against Russian computer systems.
* Following the Israel-Hamas war since 2023, multiple cyberattacks attacks were seen from pro-Israel and pro-Palestine hacktivist groups. India&#x27;s pro-Israel hacktivists took down the portals of Palestinian National Bank, the National Telecommunications Company and the website of Hamas. Multiple Israeli websites were flooded with malicious traffic by pro-Palestine hacktivists. Israeli newspaper The Jerusalem Post reported that its website was down due to a series of cyberattacks initiated against them.

==Notable hacktivist people/groups==

=== WikiLeaks ===
WikiLeaks is a media organisation and publisher founded in 2006. It operates as a non-profit and is funded by donations and media partnerships. It has published classified documents and other media provided by anonymous sources. It was founded by Julian Assange, an Australian editor, publisher, and activist, who is currently challenging extradition to the United States over his work with WikiLeaks. Since September 2018, Kristinn Hrafnsson has served as its editor-in-chief. Its website states that it has released more than ten million documents and associated analyses. WikiLeaks&#x27; most recent publication was in 2021, and its most recent publication of original documents was in 2019. Beginning in November 2022, many of the documents on the organisation&#x27;s website could not be accessed.

WikiLeaks has released document caches and media that exposed serious violations of human rights and civil liberties by various governments. It released footage, which it titled &quot;Collateral Murder&quot;, of the 12July 2007 Baghdad airstrike, in which Iraqi Reuters journalists and several civilians were killed by a U.S. helicopter crew. WikiLeaks has also published leaks such as diplomatic cables from the United States and Saudi Arabia, emails from the governments of Syria and Turkey, corruption in Kenya and at Samherji. WikiLeaks has also published documents exposing cyber warfare and surveillance tools created by the CIA, and surveillance of the French president by the National Security Agency. During the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign, WikiLeaks released emails from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and from Hillary Clinton&#x27;s campaign manager, showing that the party&#x27;s national committee had effectively acted as an arm of the Clinton campaign during the primaries, seeking to undercut the campaign of Bernie Sanders. These releases resulted in the resignation of the chairwoman of the DNC and caused significant harm to the Clinton campaign. During the campaign, WikiLeaks promoted false conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party and the murder of Seth Rich.

WikiLeaks has won a number of awards and has been commended for exposing state and corporate secrets, increasing transparency, assisting freedom of the press, and enhancing democratic discourse while challenging powerful institutions. WikiLeaks and some of its supporters say the organisation&#x27;s publications have a perfect record of publishing authentic documents. The organisation has been the target of campaigns to discredit it, including aborted ones by Palantir and HBGary. WikiLeaks has also had its donation systems disrupted by problems with its payment processors. As a result, the Wau Holland Foundation helps process WikiLeaks&#x27; donations.

The organisation has been criticised for inadequately curating some of its content and violating the personal privacy of individuals. WikiLeaks has, for instance, revealed Social Security numbers, medical information, credit card numbers and details of suicide attempts. News organisations, activists, journalists and former members have also criticised the organisation over allegations of anti-Clinton and pro-Trump bias, various associations with the Russian government, buying and selling of leaks, and a lack of internal transparency. Journalists have also criticised the organisation for promotion of false flag conspiracy theories, and what they describe as exaggerated and misleading descriptions of the contents of leaks. The CIA defined the organisation as a &quot;non-state hostile intelligence service&quot; after the release of Vault 7.

===Anonymous===

Perhaps the most prolific and well known hacktivist group, Anonymous has been prominent and prevalent in many major online hacks over the past decade. Anonymous is a decentralized group that originated on the forums of 4chan during 2003, but didn&#x27;t rise to prominence until 2008 when they directly attacked the Church of Scientology in a massive DoS attack. Since then, Anonymous has participated in a great number of online projects such as Operation: Payback and Operation: Safe Winter. However, while a great number of their projects have been for a charitable cause, they have still gained notoriety from the media due to the nature of their work mostly consisting of illegal hacking.

Following the Paris terror attacks in 2015, Anonymous posted a video declaring war on ISIS, the terror group that claimed responsibility for the attacks. Since declaring war on ISIS, Anonymous since identified several Twitter accounts associated with the movement in order to stop the distribution of ISIS propaganda. However, Anonymous fell under heavy criticism when Twitter issued a statement calling the lists Anonymous had compiled &quot;wildly inaccurate,&quot; as it contained accounts of journalists and academics rather than members of ISIS.

Anonymous has also been involved with the Black Lives Matter movement. Early in July 2015, there was a rumor circulating that Anonymous was calling for a Day of Rage protests in retaliation for the shootings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, which would entail violent protests and riots. This rumor was based on a video that was not posted with the official Anonymous YouTube account. None of the Twitter accounts associated with Anonymous had tweeted anything in relation to a Day of Rage, and the rumors were identical to past rumors that had circulated in 2014 following the death of Mike Brown. Instead, on July 15, a Twitter account associated with Anonymous posted a series of tweets calling for a day of solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. The Twitter account used the hashtag &quot;#FridayofSolidarity&quot; to coordinate protests across the nation, and emphasized the fact that the Friday of Solidarity was intended for peaceful protests. The account also stated that the group was unaware of any Day of Rage plans.

In February 2017 the group took down more than 10,000 sites on the Dark web related to child porn.

=== DkD[|| ===
DkD[||, a French cyberhacktivist, was arrested by the OCLCTIC (office central de lutte contre la criminalité liée aux technologies de l’information et de la communication), in March 2003. DkD[|| defaced more than 2000 pages, many were governments and US military sites. Eric Voulleminot of the Regional Service of Judicial Police in Lille classified the young hacker as &quot;the most wanted hacktivist in France&quot;

DkD[|| was a very known defacer in the underground for his political view, doing his defacements for various political reasons. In response to his arrest, The Ghost Boys defaced many sites using the “Free DkD[||!!” slogan.

===LulzSec===

In May 2011, five members of Anonymous formed the hacktivist group Lulz Security, otherwise known as LulzSec. LulzSec&#x27;s name originated from the conjunction of the internet slang term &quot;lulz&quot;, meaning laughs, and &quot;sec&quot;, meaning security. The group members used specific handles to identify themselves on Internet Relay Channels, the most notable being: &quot;Sabu,&quot; &quot;Kayla,&quot; &quot;T-Flow,&quot; &quot;Topiary,&quot; &quot;AVUnit,&quot; and &quot;Pwnsauce.&quot; Though the members of LulzSec would spend up to 20 hours a day in communication, they did not know one another personally, nor did they share personal information. For example, once the members&#x27; identities were revealed, &quot;T-Flow&quot; was revealed to be 15 years old. Other members, on the basis of his advanced coding ability, thought he was around 30 years old.

One of the first notable targets that LulzSec pursued was HBGary, which was performed in response to a claim made by the technology security company that it had identified members of Anonymous. Following this, the members of LulzSec targeted an array of companies and entities, including but not limited to: Fox Television, Tribune Company, PBS, Sony, Nintendo, and the Senate.gov website. The targeting of these entities typically involved gaining access to and downloading confidential user information, or defacing the website at hand. LulzSec while not as strongly political as those typical of WikiLeaks or Anonymous, they shared similar sentiments for the freedom of information. One of their distinctly politically driven attacks involved targeting the Arizona State Police in response to new immigration laws.

The group&#x27;s first attack that garnered significant government attention was in 2011, when they collectively took down a website of the FBI. Following the incident, the leader of LulzSec, &quot;Sabu,&quot; was identified as Hector Xavier Monsegur by the FBI, and he was the first of the group to be arrested. Immediately following his arrest, Monsegur admitted to criminal activity. He then began his cooperation with the US government, helping FBI authorities to arrest 8 of his co-conspirators, prevent 300 potential cyber attacks, and helped to identify vulnerabilities in existing computer systems. In August 2011, Monsegur pleaded guilty to &quot;computer hacking conspiracy, computer hacking, computer hacking in furtherance of fraud, conspiracy to commit access device fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud, and aggravated identity theft pursuant to a cooperation agreement with the government.&quot; He served a total of one year and seven months and was charged a $1,200 fine.

=== SiegedSec ===

SiegedSec, short for Sieged Security and commonly self-referred to as the &quot;Gay Furry Hackers&quot;, is a black-hat criminal hacktivist group that was formed in early 2022, that has committed a number of high-profile cyber attacks, including attacks on NATO, The Idaho National Laboratory, and Real America&#x27;s Voice. On July 10, 2024, the group announced that they would be disbanding after attacking The Heritage Foundation.

SiegedSec is led by an individual under the alias &quot;vio&quot;. Short for &quot;Sieged Security&quot;, SiegedSec&#x27;s Telegram channel was first created in April 2022, and they commonly refer to themselves as &quot;gay furry hackers&quot;. On multiple occasions, the group has targeted right-wing movements through breaching data, including The Heritage Foundation, Real America&#x27;s Voice, as well as various U.S. states that have pursued legislative decisions against gender-affirming care.

==Related practices==
=== Culture jamming ===
Hacking has been sometime described as a form of culture jamming. This term refers to the practice of subverting and criticizing political messages as well as media culture with the aim of challenging the status quo. It is often targeted toward subliminal thought processes taking place in the viewers with the goal of raising awareness as well as causing a paradigm shift. Culture jamming takes many forms including billboard hacking, broadcast signal intrusion, ad hoc art performances, simulated legal transgressions, memes, and artivism.

The term &quot;culture jamming&quot; was first coined in 1984 by American musician Donald Joyce of the band Negativland. However, some speculation remains as to when the practice of culture jamming first began. Social researcher Vince Carducci believes culture jamming can be traced back to the 1950s with European social activist group Situationist International. Author and cultural critic Mark Dery believes medieval carnival is the earliest form of culture jamming as a way to subvert the social hierarchy at the time.

Culture jamming is sometimes confused with acts of vandalism. However, unlike culture jamming, the main goal of vandalism is to cause destruction with any political themes being of lesser importance. Artivism usually has the most questionable nature as a form of culture jamming because defacement of property is usually involved.

===Media hacking===
&quot;Media hacking&quot; refers to the usage of various electronic media in an innovative or otherwise abnormal fashion for the purpose of conveying a message to as large a number of people as possible, primarily achieved via the World Wide Web. A popular and effective means of media hacking is posting on a blog, as one is usually controlled by one or more independent individuals, uninfluenced by outside parties. The concept of social bookmarking, as well as Web-based Internet forums, may cause such a message to be seen by users of other sites as well, increasing its total reach.

Media hacking is commonly employed for political purposes, by both political parties and political dissidents. A good example of this is the 2008 US Election, in which both the Democratic and Republican parties used a wide variety of different media in order to convey relevant messages to an increasingly Internet-oriented audience. At the same time, political dissidents used blogs and other social media like Twitter in order to reply on an individual basis to the presidential candidates. In particular, sites like Twitter are proving important means in gauging popular support for the candidates, though the site is often used for dissident purposes rather than a show of positive support.

Mobile technology has also become subject to media hacking for political purposes. SMS has been widely used by political dissidents as a means of quickly and effectively organising smart mobs for political action. This has been most effective in the Philippines, where SMS media hacking has twice had a significant impact on whether or not the country&#x27;s Presidents are elected or removed from office.

===Reality hacking===
&quot;Reality hacking&quot; is any phenomenon that emerges from the nonviolent use of illegal or legally ambiguous digital tools in pursuit of politically, socially, or culturally subversive ends. These tools include website defacements, URL redirections, denial-of-service attacks, information theft, web-site parodies, virtual sit-ins, and virtual sabotage.

Art movements such as Fluxus and Happenings in the 1970s created a climate of receptibility in regard to loose-knit organizations and group activities where spontaneity, a return to primitivist behavior, and an ethics where activities and socially engaged art practices became tantamount to aesthetic concerns.

The conflation of these two histories in the mid-to-late 1990s resulted in cross-overs between virtual sit-ins, electronic civil disobedience, denial-of-service attacks, as well as mass protests in relation to groups like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The rise of collectives, net.art groups, and those concerned with the fluid interchange of technology and real life (often from an environmental concern) gave birth to the practice of &quot;reality hacking&quot;.

Reality hacking relies on tweaking the everyday communications most easily available to individuals with the purpose of awakening the political and community conscience of the larger population. The term first came into use among New York and San Francisco artists, but has since been adopted by a school of political activists centered around culture jamming.

====In fiction====
The 1999 science fiction-action film &quot;The Matrix&quot;, among others, popularized the simulation hypothesis — the suggestion that reality is in fact a simulation of which those affected by the simulants are generally unaware. In this context, &quot;reality hacking&quot; is reading and understanding the code which represents the activity of the simulated reality environment (such as Matrix digital rain) and also modifying it in order to bend the laws of physics or otherwise modify the simulated reality.

Reality hacking as a mystical practice is explored in the Gothic-Punk aesthetics-inspired White Wolf urban fantasy role-playing game &quot;&quot;. In this game, the Reality Coders (also known as Reality Hackers or Reality Crackers) are a faction within the Virtual Adepts, a secret society of mages whose magick revolves around digital technology. They are dedicated to bringing the benefits of cyberspace to real space. To do this, they had to identify, for lack of a better term, the &quot;source code&quot; that allows our Universe to function. And that is what they have been doing ever since. Coders infiltrated a number of levels of society in order to gather the greatest compilation of knowledge ever seen. One of the Coders&#x27; more overt agendas is to acclimate the masses to the world that is to come. They spread Virtual Adept ideas through video games and a whole spate of &quot;reality shows&quot; that mimic virtual reality far more than &quot;real&quot; reality. The Reality Coders consider themselves the future of the Virtual Adepts, creating a world in the image of visionaries like Grant Morrison or Terence McKenna.

In a location-based game (also known as a pervasive game), reality hacking refers to tapping into phenomena that exist in the real world, and tying them into the game story universe.

===Academic interpretations ===
There have been various academic approaches to deal with hacktivism and urban hacking. In 2010, Günther Friesinger, Johannes Grenzfurthner and Thomas Ballhausen published an entire reader dedicated to the subject. They state:

<text>A palatine or palatinus (Latin; : &quot;palatini&quot;; cf. derivative spellings below) is a high-level official attached to imperial or royal courts in Europe since Roman times. The term &quot;palatinus&quot; was first used in Ancient Rome for chamberlains of the Emperor due to their association with the Palatine Hill. The imperial palace guard, after the rise of Constantine I, were also called the &quot;Scholae Palatinae&quot; for the same reason. In the Early Middle Ages the title became attached to courts beyond the imperial one; one of the highest level of officials in the papal administration were called the &quot;judices palatini&quot;. Later the Merovingian and Carolingian dynasties had counts palatine, as did the Holy Roman Empire. Related titles were used in Hungary, Poland, Lithuania, the German Empire, and the County of Burgundy, while England, Ireland, and parts of British North America referred to rulers of counties palatine as &quot;palatines&quot;.

==Derivative terms==
The different spellings originate from the different languages that used the title throughout the ages (a phenomenon called lenition). The word &quot;palatine&quot; evolved from the Latin word &quot;palatinus&quot;, asserting a connection to the Palatine Hill, where the house of the Roman emperor was situated since Augustus (hence &quot;palace&quot;). The meaning of the term hardly changed, since Latin was the dominant language in medieval writing. But its spelling slightly changed in European languages: Latin &quot;palatinus&quot;, plural &quot;palatini&quot; was still an office in Merovingian times, today referred to as the Count Palatine. The word became in French &quot;palaisin&quot;, and with the Norman dynasty entered the English language as &quot;palatine&quot;. The word paladin, referring to one of the legendary Twelve Peers of Charlemagne in the Matter of France, is also related.

The word &quot;palatinus&quot; and its derivatives also translate the titles of certain great functionaries in eastern Europe, such as the Slavic voivode, a military governor of a province. In Poland the title of &quot;Palatyn&quot; (&quot;Comes Palatinus&quot;) has merged with that of &quot;Wojewoda&quot; (&quot;Dux Exercituum&quot;).

==History==

===Ancient Rome: &quot;palatinus&quot;===

The members of the Imperial Guard were named after Palatine Hill, the mythical founding place of Rome. On the same hill lived the members of the older of two schools of the ancient Salii brotherhood of God of War Mars, which had some symbolism in common with that of the imperial palace. Military training schools were the scholae, and the Imperial Guard was called Scholae Palatinae. It was a personal army that the emperor was allowed to use personally on campaigns.

===Holy Roman Empire: &quot;comes palatinus&quot;===

From the Middle Ages on, the term palatine was applied to various officials across Europe. The most important of these was the &quot;comes palatinus&quot;, the count palatine, who in Merovingian and Carolingian times (5th through 10th century) was an official of the sovereign&#x27;s household, in particular of his court of law in the imperial palaces (see &quot;kaiserpfalz&quot;). The count palatine was the official representative at proceedings of the court such as oath takings or judicial sentences and was in charge of the records of those developments. At first he examined cases in the king&#x27;s court and was authorized to carry out the decisions, in time, these rights extended to having his own judicial rights. In addition to those responsibilities, the count palatine had administrative functions, especially concerning the king&#x27;s household.

In the 9th century Carolingian rule came to an end and the title of Holy Roman emperor with it. About a century later the title was resurrected by Otto I though the new empire was now centered on Germany rather than France. Under the German kings of the Saxon and Salian dynasties (10th to 12th century), the function of the counts palatine corresponded to those of the &quot;missi dominici&quot; at the Carolingian Court. They had various tasks: representatives of the king in the provinces, they were responsible for the administration of the royal domain and for protecting and guiding the legal system in certain duchies, such as Saxony and Bavaria, and, in particular, Lotharingia. Later other palatine rights were absorbed by ducal dynasties, by local families, or, in Italy, by bishops. Increasingly, the count palatine of Lotharingia, whose office had been attached to the royal palace at Aachen from the 10th century onward, became the &quot;real successor to the Carolingian count palatine&quot;. From his office grew the Countship Palatine of the Rhine, or simply the Palatinate, which became a great territorial power from the time of the emperor Frederick I (Barbarossa) (d. 1190) on. The term &quot;palatine&quot; reoccurs under Charles IV, but they had only voluntary jurisdiction and some honorific functions.

===Papal States: &quot;judices palatini&quot;===

In the Middle Ages, the &quot;judices palatini&quot; (&quot;papal palace judges&quot;) were the highest administrative officers of the pope&#x27;s household.

===Modern era===
In Early Modern Britain, the term &quot;palatinate&quot;, or county palatine, was also applied to counties of lords who could exercise powers normally reserved to the crown. Likewise, there were palatine provinces among the English colonies in North America: Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, was granted palatine rights in Maryland in 1632, as were the proprietors of the Carolinas in 1663. And although with tongue in cheek, legal historian John Phillip Reid once asked if the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company jurisdiction of &quot;Rupert&#x27;s Land can be analogized to a county palatine&quot;. His question is yet to receive serious scholarly attention.

In 19th-century Germany, &quot;Paladin&quot; was an official rank and considered an honorary title for a man in the service of his emperor. It was a knight with additional honors, they were entitled to exercise powers normally reserved to the crown. In Nazi Germany, Hermann Göring was also given the title &quot;Paladin&quot;, referring to the tradition of a title that made the bearer second to the monarch.
