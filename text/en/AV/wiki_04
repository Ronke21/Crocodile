<text>Romance of the Three Kingdoms () is a 14th-century historical novel attributed to Luo Guanzhong. It is set in the turbulent years towards the end of the Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period in Chinese history, starting in 184 AD and ending with the reunification of the land in 280 by the Western Jin. The novel is based primarily on the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, written by Chen Shou in the 3rd century.

The story – part historical and part fictional – romanticises and dramatises the lives of feudal lords and their retainers, who tried to supplant the dwindling Han dynasty or restore it. While the novel follows hundreds of characters, the focus is mainly on the three power blocs that emerged from the remnants of the Han dynasty, and would eventually form the three states of Cao Wei, Shu Han, and Eastern Wu. The novel deals with the plots, personal and military battles, intrigues, and struggles of these states to achieve dominance for almost 100 years.

&quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; is acclaimed as one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature; it has a total of 800,000 words and nearly a thousand dramatic characters (mostly historical) in 120 chapters. The novel is among the most beloved works of literature in East Asia, and its literary influence in the region has been compared to that of the works of Shakespeare on English literature. It is arguably the most widely read historical novel in late imperial and modern China. Herbert Giles stated that among the Chinese themselves, this is regarded as the greatest of all their novels.

==Origins and versions==
Stories about the heroes of the Three Kingdoms were the basis of entertainment dating back to the Sui and Tang dynasty (6th–10th centuries). By the Song dynasty (10th–13th centuries), there were several records of professional oral storytellers who specialized in the Three Kingdoms hero cycles. The earliest written work to combine these stories was a &quot;pinghua&quot; named &quot;Sanguozhi Pinghua&quot; published sometime between 1321 and 1323.

===Expansion of the history===
&quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; is traditionally attributed to Luo Guanzhong, a playwright who lived sometime between 1315 and 1400 (late Yuan to early Ming period) known for compiling historical plays in styles which were prevalent during the Yuan period. It was first printed in 1522 as &quot;Sanguozhi Tongsu Yanyi&quot; () in an edition which bore a preface dated 1494. The text may well have circulated before either date in handwritten manuscripts.

Regardless of when it was written or whether Luo was the writer, the author made use of several available historical records, primarily the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; compiled by Chen Shou in the 3rd century. The &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; covered events ranging from the Yellow Turban Rebellion in 184 to the unification of the Three Kingdoms under the Jin dynasty in 280. The novel also includes material from Tang dynasty poetic works, Yuan dynasty operas and his own personal interpretation of elements such as virtue and legitimacy. The author combined this historical knowledge with his own storytelling skills to create a rich tapestry of personalities.

===Recensions and standardised text===
Luo Guanzhong&#x27;s version in 24 volumes, known as the &quot;Sanguozhi Tongsu Yanyi&quot;, is now held in the Shanghai Library in China, Tenri Central Library in Japan, and several other major libraries. Various 10-volume, 12-volume and 20-volume recensions of Luo&#x27;s text, made between 1522 and 1690, are also held at libraries around the world. However, the standard text familiar to general readers is a recension by Mao Lun and his son Mao Zonggang.

In the 1660s, during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor in the Qing dynasty, Mao Lun and Mao Zonggang significantly edited the text, fitting it into 120 chapters, and abbreviating the title to &quot;Sanguozhi Yanyi&quot;. The text was reduced from 900,000 to 750,000 characters; significant editing was done for narrative flow; use of third-party poems was reduced and shifted from conventional verse to finer pieces; and most passages praising Cao Cao&#x27;s advisers and generals were removed. Scholars have long debated whether the Maos&#x27; viewpoint was anti-Qing (identifying Southern Ming remnants with Shu-Han) or pro-Qing.

The famous opening lines of the novel, &quot;The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been&quot; (), long understood to be Luo&#x27;s introduction and cyclical philosophy, were actually added by the Maos in their substantially revised edition of 1679. None of the earlier editions contained this phrase. In addition, Mao also added Yang Shen&#x27;s &quot;The Immortals by the River&quot; as the famous introductory poem (which began with &quot;The gushing waters of the Yangzi River pour and disappear into the East&quot;, ) to the novel. The earlier editions, moreover, spend less time on the process of division, which they found painful, and far more time on the process of reunification and the struggles of the heroes who sacrificed for it.

==Plot==
The following is a summary of the central plot and some well-known highlights in the novel.

===Yellow Turban Rebellion and the Ten Attendants===
In the late second century, towards the end of the Han dynasty in China, corruption was rampant on all levels throughout the government, with treacherous eunuchs and villainous officials deceiving the emperor and persecuting those who stood up to them. The Han Empire gradually deteriorated and became increasingly fragmented, with many regional officials being warlords with their own armies. In the meantime, the common people suffered, and the Yellow Turban Rebellion (led by Zhang Jiao and his brothers) eventually broke out during the reign of Emperor Ling.

The rebellion was barely suppressed by imperial forces commanded by the general He Jin. Shortly after Emperor Ling&#x27;s death, He Jin installed the young Emperor Shao on the throne and took control of the central government. The Ten Attendants, a group of influential court eunuchs, feared that He Jin was growing too powerful, so they lured him into the palace and assassinated him. In revenge, He Jin&#x27;s followers broke into the palace and indiscriminately slaughtered any person who looked like a eunuch. In the ensuing chaos, Emperor Shao and his younger half-brother, the Prince of Chenliu, disappeared from the palace.

===Dong Zhuo&#x27;s tyranny===
The missing emperor and prince were found by soldiers of the warlord Dong Zhuo, who escorted them back to the palace and used the opportunity to seize control of the imperial capital, Luoyang, under the pretext of protecting the emperor. Dong Zhuo later deposed Emperor Shao and replaced him with the Prince of Chenliu (Emperor Xian), who was merely a figurehead under his control. Dong Zhuo monopolised state power, persecuted his political opponents, and oppressed the common people for his personal gain. During this time, there were two attempts on his life: the first was by a military officer Wu Fu (), who failed and died a gruesome death; the second was by Cao Cao, who was also unsuccessful but managed to escape.

Cao Cao fled from Luoyang, returned to his home commandery, and sent out a fake imperial edict to various warlords, calling them to rise up against Dong Zhuo. Under Yuan Shao&#x27;s leadership, eighteen warlords formed a coalition and launched a punitive campaign against Dong Zhuo. After Dong Zhuo lost the battles of Sishui Pass and Hulao Pass, he forced the citizens of Luoyang to relocate to Chang&#x27;an with him and burnt down Luoyang. The coalition ultimately broke up due to indecisive leadership and conflicting interests among its members. Meanwhile, in Chang&#x27;an, Dong Zhuo was betrayed and murdered by his foster son Lü Bu in a dispute over the maiden Diaochan as part of a plot orchestrated by the minister Wang Yun.

===Conflict among the various warlords and nobles===
In the meantime, the Han Empire was already disintegrating into civil war as warlords fought for territories and power. Sun Jian found the Imperial Seal in the ruins of Luoyang and secretly kept it for himself. When Yuan Shao confronted him, he refused to hand over the Imperial Seal and left, but was attacked by Liu Biao (acting on Yuan Shao&#x27;s instruction) on the way back to his base. At the same time, Yuan Shao waged war against Gongsun Zan to consolidate his power in northern China. Other warlords such as Cao Cao and Liu Bei, who initially had no titles or land, were also gradually forming their own armies and taking control of territories. During those times of upheaval, Cao Cao saved Emperor Xian from Dong Zhuo&#x27;s followers, established the new imperial capital in Xu, and became the new head of the central government. He also defeated rival warlords such as Lü Bu, Yuan Shu and Zhang Xiu in a series of wars and gained control over much of central China.

Meanwhile, Sun Jian was killed in an ambush by Liu Biao&#x27;s forces. His eldest son, Sun Ce, delivered the Imperial Seal as a tribute to the warlord Yuan Shu, a rising pretender to the throne, in exchange for troops and horses. Sun Ce then secured himself a power base in the rich riverlands of Jiangdong (Wu), on which the state of Eastern Wu was founded later. Tragically, Sun Ce also died at the pinnacle of his career from illness under stress of his terrifying encounter with the ghost of Yu Ji, a venerable magician whom he had falsely accused of heresy and executed in jealousy. Sun Quan, his younger brother and successor, proved to be a capable and charismatic ruler. With assistance from Zhou Yu, Zhang Zhao and others, Sun Quan found hidden talents such as Lu Su to serve him, built up his military forces, and maintained stability in Jiangdong.

===Liu Bei&#x27;s ambition===
Liu Bei and his oath brothers Guan Yu and Zhang Fei swore allegiance to the Han Empire in the Oath of the Peach Garden and pledged to do their best for the people. However, their ambitions were not realised as they did not receive due recognition for helping to suppress the Yellow Turban Rebellion and participating in the campaign against Dong Zhuo. After Liu Bei succeeded Tao Qian as the governor of Xu Province, he offered shelter to Lü Bu, who had just been defeated by Cao Cao. However, Lü Bu betrayed his host, seized control of the province and attacked Liu Bei. After combining forces with Cao Cao to defeat Lü Bu at the Battle of Xiapi, Liu Bei followed Cao Cao back to the imperial capital, Xu, where Emperor Xian honoured him as his &quot;Imperial Uncle&quot; upon learning that he was also a descendant of the imperial clan. When Cao Cao showed signs that he wanted to usurp the throne, Emperor Xian wrote a secret decree in blood to his father-in-law, Dong Cheng, and ordered him to get rid of Cao Cao. Dong Cheng secretly contacted Liu Bei, Ma Teng and others, and they planned to assassinate Cao Cao. However, their plans were leaked, and Cao Cao had Dong Cheng and the others arrested and executed along with their families.

Liu Bei had already left the imperial capital when the plot was exposed, and he moved on to seize control of Xu Province from Che Zhou, the new governor appointed by Cao Cao. In retaliation, Cao Cao attacked Xu Province and defeated Liu Bei, causing him to be separated from his oath brothers. While Liu Bei briefly joined Yuan Shao after his defeat, Zhang Fei took control of a small city, and Guan Yu temporarily served under Cao Cao and helped him slay two of Yuan Shao&#x27;s generals in battle. The three oath brothers were eventually reunited and managed to establish a new base in Runan, but they were defeated by Cao Cao&#x27;s forces again so they retreated south to Jing Province, where they took shelter under the governor Liu Biao.

===Battle of Guandu===
After pacifying the nearby provinces, suppressing a rebellion by former Yellow Turbans, and consolidating power in the central government, Cao Cao turned his attention north to Yuan Shao, who had recently eliminated Gongsun Zan and now controlled most of northern China. Yuan Shao amassed a large army and camped along the northern bank of the Yellow River.

In the summer of 200, after months of preparations, Cao Cao and Yuan Shao clashed at the Battle of Guandu. Although Cao Cao was heavily outnumbered by Yuan Shao, he secured a decisive victory over his rival after launching a surprise raid on Yuan Shao&#x27;s supply train and throwing the enemy into disarray. Yuan Shao retreated north after his defeat, fell ill and died about two years later. Cao Cao took advantage of Yuan Shao&#x27;s death, which had resulted in internal conflict among his sons who were fighting over their father&#x27;s territories, and advanced north to attack and seize all of Yuan Shao&#x27;s lands. By the end of 207, after a victorious campaign beyond the frontier against the Wuhuan, Cao Cao achieved complete dominance of northern China. The territories in central and northern China which came under Cao Cao&#x27;s control became the foundation of the state of Cao Wei, which would later be established by Cao Cao&#x27;s son and successor Cao Pi.

===Zhuge Liang joins Liu Bei===
In the meantime, Liu Biao had put Liu Bei in charge of Xinye. During this time, Liu Bei visited Zhuge Liang thrice and recruited him. Acting on Zhuge Liang&#x27;s advice, Liu Bei built up his forces in preparation for war against Cao Cao. Following his unification of central and northern China under his control, Cao Cao, having been appointed Imperial Chancellor by Emperor Xian, led his forces on a southern campaign to eliminate Liu Bei and Sun Quan. By then, Liu Biao had died and his younger son Liu Cong decided to surrender control of Jing Province to Cao Cao.

In 208, although Liu Bei managed to repel two attacks by Cao Cao at Xinye, he was eventually forced to flee due to the overwhelming strength of the enemy forces. Cao Cao and his cavalry caught up with Liu Bei and his forces at Changban and defeated them. During the battle, Liu Bei&#x27;s generals Zhao Yun and Zhang Fei displayed heroics: the former fought his way through enemy lines to rescue Liu Bei&#x27;s infant son Liu Shan and deliver him safely back to his father; the latter single-handedly held off enemy forces at a bridge by intimidating and staring them down. Liu Bei and his forces managed to rendezvous with Guan Yu, who had left earlier to seek help from Liu Biao&#x27;s elder son Liu Qi, and they retreated to Xiakou.

===Battle of Red Cliffs===
In 208, Liu Bei dispatched Zhuge Liang on a diplomatic mission to Jiangdong to meet Sun Quan and discuss forming a Sun–Liu alliance to counter Cao Cao. Although Sun Quan was initially hesitant due to many of his followers advising him to surrender to Cao Cao, he ultimately made up his mind to ally with Liu Bei, placing Zhou Yu in command of his forces to prepare for the upcoming war. Zhuge Liang temporarily remained in Jiangdong to assist Zhou Yu, who sensed that Zhuge Liang posed a future threat to his lord. Zhou Yu attempted to outwit and kill Zhuge Liang, but failed and had no choice but to cooperate with the latter. The Sun–Liu forces scored a decisive victory over Cao Cao at the Battle of Red Cliffs.

Sun Quan and Liu Bei started vying for control of southern Jing Province after their victory, but Liu Bei won and took over the territories from Cao Cao&#x27;s general Cao Ren. Sun Quan, unhappy over having gained nothing, sent messengers to ask Liu Bei to &quot;return&quot; the territories to him, but Liu Bei dismissed the messenger each time with a different excuse. Sun Quan was unwilling to give up, so he followed Zhou Yu&#x27;s plan to trick Liu Bei to come to Jiangdong to marry his sister Lady Sun and then hold Liu Bei hostage in exchange for Jing Province. However, Zhuge Liang foiled Zhou Yu&#x27;s plot, and the newlywed couple returned to Jing Province safely. Zhou Yu later died in frustration after Zhuge Liang repeatedly thwarted his moves to take Jing Province.

===Liu Bei&#x27;s takeover of Yi Province===
Relations between Liu Bei and Sun Quan deteriorated after Zhou Yu&#x27;s death, but not to the point of war. Following Zhuge Liang&#x27;s Longzhong Plan, Liu Bei led his forces westward into Yi Province and seized control of the territories from the governor Liu Zhang. By then, Liu Bei ruled over a vast stretch of land from Yi Province to southern Jing Province; these territories served as the foundation of the state of Shu Han later. Liu Bei declared himself King of Hanzhong after defeating Cao Cao in the Hanzhong Campaign and capturing Hanzhong Commandery.

At the same time, Emperor Xian awarded Cao Cao the title of a vassal king – King of Wei – while Sun Quan was known as the Duke of Wu. In eastern China, Sun Quan and Cao Cao&#x27;s forces fought in various battles along the Yangtze River, including the battles of Hefei and Ruxu, but neither side managed to gain a significant advantage over the other.

===Death of Guan Yu===
Meanwhile, Sun Quan plotted to take Jing Province after growing tired of Liu Bei&#x27;s repeated refusals to hand over the territories. He secretly made peace and allied with Cao Cao against Liu Bei. While Guan Yu, who guarded Liu Bei&#x27;s territories in Jing Province, was away attacking Cao Ren at the Battle of Fancheng, Sun Quan sent his general Lü Meng to launch a stealth invasion on Jing Province. Guan Yu was unable to capture Fancheng so he retreated, but was caught off guard by Lü Meng and had already lost Jing Province before he knew it. With his army&#x27;s morale falling and the troops gradually deserting, Guan Yu and his remaining men withdrew to Maicheng, where they were surrounded by Sun Quan&#x27;s forces. In desperation, Guan Yu attempted to break out of the siege but failed and was captured in an ambush. Sun Quan had him executed after he refused to surrender.

Shortly after Guan Yu&#x27;s death, Cao Cao died of a brain tumour in Luoyang. His son and successor, Cao Pi, forced Emperor Xian to abdicate the throne to him and established the state of Cao Wei to replace the Han dynasty. About a year later, Liu Bei declared himself emperor and founded the state of Shu Han as a continuation of the Han dynasty. While Liu Bei was planning to avenge Guan Yu, Zhang Fei was assassinated in his sleep by his subordinates.

===Battle of Yiling===
As Liu Bei led a large army to avenge Guan Yu and retake Jing Province, Sun Quan attempted to appease him by offering to return him the territories in southern Jing Province. Liu Bei&#x27;s subjects urged him to accept Sun Quan&#x27;s offer but Liu Bei insisted on avenging his oath brother. After initial victories against Sun Quan&#x27;s forces, a series of strategic mistakes resulted in Sun Quan&#x27;s general Lu Xun inflicting a calamitous defeat on Liu Bei at the Battle of Yiling. Lu Xun initially pursued Liu Bei during his retreat, but gave up after getting trapped inside and barely escaping from Zhuge Liang&#x27;s Stone Sentinel Maze.

Liu Bei died in Baidicheng from illness a few months later. On his deathbed, Liu Bei granted Zhuge Liang permission to take the throne if his son and successor, Liu Shan, proved to be an inept ruler. Zhuge Liang firmly refused and swore to remain faithful to the trust Liu Bei had placed in him.

===Zhuge Liang&#x27;s campaigns===
After Liu Bei&#x27;s death, Cao Pi induced several forces, including Sun Quan, a turncoat Shu general Meng Da, the Nanman and Qiang tribes, to attack Shu, in coordination with a Wei army. However, Zhuge Liang managed to make the five armies retreat without any bloodshed. He also sent Deng Zhi to make peace with Sun Quan and restore the alliance between Shu and Wu. Zhuge Liang then personally led a southern campaign against the Nanman, defeated them seven times, and won the allegiance of the Nanman king Meng Huo.

After pacifying the south, Zhuge Liang led the Shu army on five military expeditions to attack Wei as part of his mission to restore the Han dynasty. Each time, as Zhuge Liang was on the verge of success, he was recalled due to various unfortunate circumstances, such as Liu Shan listening to rumours spread by eunuchs. Moreover, his days were numbered because he had been suffering from chronic illness and his condition worsened under stress. He died of illness at the Battle of Wuzhang Plains while leading a stalemate battle against the Wei general Sima Yi.

===End of the Three Kingdoms===
The long years of battle between Shu and Wei saw many changes in the ruling Cao family in Wei. The influence of the Caos weakened after Cao Rui&#x27;s death and state power eventually fell into the hands of the regent Sima Yi and subsequently to his sons, Sima Shi and Sima Zhao.

In Shu, Jiang Wei inherited Zhuge Liang&#x27;s legacy and continued to lead another nine campaigns against Wei for three decades, but ultimately failed to achieve any significant success. The Shu emperor Liu Shan also turned out to be an incompetent ruler who trusted corrupt officials. Shu gradually declined under Liu Shan&#x27;s rule and was eventually conquered by Wei forces. Jiang Wei attempted to restore Shu with the help of Zhong Hui, a disgruntled Wei general, but their plan failed and Zhong Hui was killed by Wei troops while Jiang Wei died by suicide. Shortly after the fall of Shu, Sima Zhao died and his son, Sima Yan, forced the last Wei emperor, Cao Huan, to abdicate the throne to him. Sima Yan then established the Jin dynasty to replace the state of Cao Wei.

In Wu, there had been internal conflict among the nobles since Sun Quan&#x27;s death. The regents Zhuge Ke and Sun Chen consecutively attempted to usurp the throne but were eventually ousted from power and eliminated in coups. Although stability was temporarily restored in Wu, the last Wu emperor, Sun Hao, turned out to be a tyrant. Wu, the last of the Three Kingdoms, was eventually conquered by the Jin dynasty. The fall of Wu marked the end of the near century-long era of civil strife historically known as the Three Kingdoms period.

==Historical accuracy==
The novel draws from Chen Shou&#x27;s &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; as the main historical source. Other major influences include Liu Yiqing&#x27;s &quot;A New Account of the Tales of the World&quot; (&quot;Shishuo Xinyu&quot;), published in 430, and the &quot;Sanguozhi Pinghua&quot;, a chronological collection of eighty fictional sketches starting with the peach garden oath and ending with Zhuge Liang&#x27;s death.

Some 50 or 60 Yuan and early Ming plays about the Three Kingdoms are known to have existed, and their material is almost entirely fictional, based on thin threads of actual history. The novel is thus a return to greater emphasis on history, compared to these dramas. The novel also shifted towards better acknowledgement of southern China&#x27;s historical importance, while still portraying some prejudice against the south. The Qing dynasty historian Zhang Xuecheng famously wrote that the novel was &quot;seven-parts fact and three-parts fiction.&quot; The fictional parts are culled from different sources, including unofficial histories, folk stories, the &quot;Sanguozhi Pinghua&quot;, and also the author&#x27;s own imagination. Nonetheless, the description of the social conditions and the logic that the characters use is accurate to the Three Kingdoms period, creating &quot;believable&quot; situations and characters, even if they are not historically accurate.

&quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, like the dramas and folk stories of its day, features Liu Bei and his associates as the protagonists; hence the depiction of the people in Shu Han was glorified. The antagonists, Cao Cao, Sun Quan and their followers, on the other hand, were often denigrated. This suited the political climate in the Ming dynasty, unlike in the Jin dynasty when Cao Wei was considered the legitimate successor to the Han dynasty.

Some non-historical scenes in the novel have become well-known and subsequently became a part of traditional Chinese culture.

==Literary analysis==
In the introduction to the 1959 reprint of the Brewitt-Taylor translation, Roy Andrew Miller argues that the novel&#x27;s chief theme is &quot;the nature of human ambition&quot;, to which Moody adds the relationship between politics and morality, specifically the conflict between the idealism of Confucian political thought and the harsh realism of Legalism, as a related theme. Other dominant themes of the novel include: the rise and fall of the ideal liege (Liu Bei); finding the ideal minister (Zhuge Liang); the conflict between the ideal liege (Liu Bei) and the consummate villain (Cao Cao); and the cruelties and injustice of feudal or dynastic government.

The opening lines of the novel, &quot;The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been&quot;, added by Mao Lun and Mao Zonggang in their recension, epitomise the tragic theme of the novel. One recent critic notes that the novel takes political and moral stands and lets the reader know which of the characters are heroes and which villains, yet the heroes are forced to make a tragic choice between equal values, not merely between good and evil. The heroes know that the end of the empire is ordained by this cosmic cycle of division and unity, yet their choices are moral, based on loyalty, not political.

Plaks states the novel deals with the &quot;cyclical theories of dynastic decline,&quot; and relates the &quot;breakdown of order&quot; at the end of the Han dynasty to &quot;the improper exercise of imperial authority, the destabilisation influence of special-interest groups (eunuchs, imperial clansmen), the problem of factional and individual idealism carried to the point of civil strife-all of which eventually surface in the body of the narrative.&quot; He goes on to say, the &quot;overlapping claims to legitimacy and multiple spheres of power,&quot; give the novel a &quot;sense of epic greatness&quot; with its &quot;combination of grandeur and futility.&quot;

==Cultural impact==
Besides the famous Peach Garden Oath, many in use today are derived from the novel:
The writing style adopted by &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; was part of the emergence of written vernacular during the Ming period, as part of the so-called &quot;Four Masterworks&quot; (&quot;si da qishu&quot;).

===Buddhist aspects===

&quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; recorded stories of a Buddhist monk called Pujing (普净), who was a friend of Guan Yu. Pujing made his first appearance during Guan&#x27;s arduous journey of crossing five passes and slaying six generals, in which he warned Guan of an assassination plot. As the novel was written in the Ming dynasty, more than 1,000 years after the era, these stories showed that Buddhism had long been a significant ingredient of the mainstream culture and may not be historically accurate. Luo Guanzhong preserved these descriptions from earlier versions of the novel to support his portrait of Guan as a faithful man of virtue. Guan has since then been respectfully addressed as &quot;Lord Guan&quot; or &quot;Guan Gong&quot;.

=== Adaptations ===
The story of the &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; has been retold in numerous forms including television series, manga and video games.

==Translations==

=== Manchu ===
The Jurchen chieftain Nurhaci was an avid reader of the &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; and &quot;Water Margin&quot;, learning all he knew about Chinese military and political strategies from them. Thus, when his descendants founded the Qing dynasty and became the rulers of China, the book was one of the first Chinese books to be translated into their Manchu language along with military manuals. Indeed, it is one of only two Chinese novels that had a Manchu translation put into print during the Qing dynasty (the other being &quot;Jin Ping Mei&quot;).

A Manchu translation of the &quot;Romance&quot;, known in Manchu as &quot;Ilan gurun-i bithe&quot; (), was first attempted in 1631 by the eminent scholar Dahai (; 1595–1632), but he died the following year before it could be finished. A complete translation based on the 1522 edition of the novel was done in 1647 and published in 1650 by a team of high-ranking officials including Kicungge (; d. 1651) and Fan Wencheng (1597–1666), commissioned by the prince-regent Dorgon. This is the first translation of the &quot;Romance&quot; that could be dated with certainty in any language.

The Manchu translation was itself translated into a number of languages including Xibe, Mongolian, Korean, Tibetan and French (the first translation of the novel into a European language). It was also back-translated into Chinese in a bilingual Manchu-Chinese edition during the Yongzheng period (1723–1735).

===English ===
The &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; has been translated into English a number of times.

====Excerpts ====
The first known translation was performed in 1907 by John G. Steele and consisted of a single chapter excerpt that was distributed in China to students learning English at Presbyterian missionary schools. Herbert A. Giles included an excerpt in his 1923 &quot;Gems of Chinese Literature&quot;. Z. Q. Parker published a 1925 translation containing four episodes from the novel including the events of the Battle of Red Cliffs, while Yang Xianyi and Gladys Yang published excerpts in 1981, including chapters 43–50.

==== Abridged ====
In 1976, Moss Roberts published an abridged translation of the novel, presenting approximately one-fourth of the original text. This edition featured maps and over 40 woodblock illustrations derived from three Chinese versions of the work. Designed to be accessible to college students and general readers, Roberts’ abridgment employed a mixed approach: translating entire chapters, providing partial translations of others, and summarizing the remainder in italicized text. This translation includes approximately 100 pages of endnotes, detailed maps, and an extensive essay by Roberts discussing the text and its context.

In 2018, Penguin Classics released a new abridged translation by Martin Palmer, assisted by He Yun, Jay Ramsay, and Victoria Finlay. Palmer&#x27;s version covers the full narrative by including at least portions of all 120 chapters, ensuring continuity without gaps in the story. Unlike Roberts&#x27; earlier approach, Palmer translated only the most significant episodes in full while summarizing the rest.

====Unabridged====
A complete and faithful translation of the novel was published in two volumes in 1925 by Charles Henry Brewitt-Taylor, a long time official of the Chinese Maritime Customs Service. The translation was well written, but lacked any supplementary materials such as maps or character lists that would aid Western readers; a 1959 reprint was published that included maps and an introduction by Roy Andrew Miller to assist foreign readers.

After decades of work, Moss Roberts published a full translation in 1991 complete with an afterword, eleven maps, a list of characters, titles, terms, and offices, and almost 100 pages of notes from Mao Zonggang&#x27;s commentaries and other scholarly sources. Roberts&#x27;s complete translation remains faithful to the original; it is reliable yet still matches the tone and style of the classic text. Yang Ye, a professor in Chinese Literature at the UC Riverside, wrote in &quot;Encyclopedia of Literary Translation into English&quot; (1998) that Roberts&#x27;s translation &quot;supersedes Brewitt-Taylor&#x27;s translation and will no doubt remain the definitive English version for many years to come&quot;. Roberts&#x27;s translation was republished in 1995 by the Foreign Languages Press without the illustrations.

In 2014, Tuttle published a new, three-volume translation of the novel, translated by Yu Sumei and edited by Ronald C. Iverson (). According to its publisher, this translation is an unabridged &quot;dynamic translation&quot; intended to be more readable than past English translations of the novel.

<text>Herbert W. Armstrong (July 31, 1892 – January 16, 1986) was an American evangelist who founded the Worldwide Church of God (WCG). An early pioneer of radio and television evangelism, Armstrong preached what he claimed was the comprehensive combination of doctrines in the entire Bible, in the light of the New Covenant scriptures, which he maintained to be the restored true Gospel. These doctrines and teachings have been referred to as Armstrongism by non-adherents.

Armstrong&#x27;s teachings required observance of parts of the Mosaic Law including seventh-day Sabbath, dietary prohibitions, and the covenant law &quot;Holy Days&quot;. He also proclaimed that behind contemporary world events loomed various Biblical prophecies, interpreted in light of British Israelism. As founder and head of the Ambassador International Cultural Foundation, Armstrong and his advisers met with heads of governments in various nations, for which he described himself as an &quot;ambassador without portfolio for world peace.&quot;

==Early life==
Herbert Armstrong was born on July 31, 1892, in Des Moines, Iowa, into a Quaker family, the son of Eva (Wright) and Horace Elon Armstrong. He regularly attended the services and the Sunday school of First Friends Church in Des Moines. At age 18, on the advice of an uncle, he decided to take a job in the want-ad department of a Des Moines newspaper, the &quot;Daily Capital&quot;. His early career in the print advertising industry which followed had a strong impact on his future ministry and would shape his communication style.

On a trip back home in 1917, he met Loma Dillon, a school teacher and distant cousin from nearby Motor, Iowa. They married on his 25th birthday, July 31, 1917, and returned to live in Chicago.

Within a month or two after their marriage, (the US had entered World War I on April 6) Loma had an unusual dream or vision. She was with Herbert, at a road intersection, where she saw in the sky, a banner of dazzling stars, appearing then vanishing twice-over. She was happy, but sad for others, and thought she was witnessing Christ&#x27;s return. Angels then flew to them and said that Christ was not coming then, but would be &quot;coming very soon&quot;. Saying that God was giving them an &quot;important work&quot; to do, preparing the way before Christ&#x27;s second coming. At the time, Herbert was not at all religious and it was only in later years that he came to believe that the vision &quot;really was a message from God.&quot;

On May 9, 1918, they had their first child, Beverly Lucile, and on July 7, 1920, a second daughter, Dorothy Jane. In 1924, after several business setbacks, Armstrong and family moved to Eugene, Oregon where his parents lived at the time. While living in Oregon, they had two sons, Richard David (born October 13, 1928) and Garner Ted (born February 9, 1930). Armstrong continued in the advertising business despite the setbacks.

==Beginnings of ministry==
During their stay in Oregon, his wife, Loma, became acquainted with a member of the Church of God (Seventh Day), Emma Runcorn. Emma and her husband O.J. were lay leaders in the Oregon conference of the Church of God, Seventh Day, a seventh-day-keeping Adventist group that rejected the authority of Ellen G. White and her teachings.
Loma became persuaded that the Bible taught Sabbath observance on Saturday, the seventh day, one of the beliefs of that church. Her assertion of this to her husband was met with dismay and appeared to him to be &quot;religious fanaticism.&quot; She challenged him to find biblical support for Sunday observance. As his business was struggling against larger competitors, Armstrong had the time to take up this challenge. He began what would become a lifelong habit of intensive, lengthy Bible study sessions. He soon felt God was inspiring this, opening his mind to truths that historical Christian churches had not found or accepted. Shortly after, as related in his autobiography, Armstrong would take up a similar study on the topic of evolution of the species after a conflict with his sister-in-law. His studies on Sabbath and evolution convinced him that his wife was right, and that the theory of evolution was false.

He was eventually baptized, along with his brother Dwight L. Armstrong, in the summer of 1927 by Dr. Dean, the non-Sabbatarian pastor of Hinson Memorial Baptist Church in Portland, Oregon. It is unknown, however, if he ever joined this denomination. He would later recollect over four decades later that he believed, &quot;On being baptized I &quot;knew&quot; God then and there gave me HIS HOLY SPIRIT!&quot; Despite his own unique teaching on baptism his own account is noteworthy for the absence of any mention of the process of laying on of hands or a special prayer in the dispensation of the Holy Spirit, which were considered fundamental for membership in the Worldwide Church of God and reason for many a new convert&#x27;s rebaptism.

In 1931 Armstrong became an ordained minister of the Oregon Conference of the Church of God (Seventh Day). The existence and history of this church became a significant factor in Armstrong&#x27;s later beliefs.

While a member of The Church of God (Seventh Day), Armstrong became acquainted with ministers John Kiesz and Israel Hager who began to suspect that Herbert was a little too arrogant and tended to go against church doctrine. They cited Armstrong&#x27;s refusal to submit to the Church of God ministers to be baptized but went out to a local Baptist minister instead as a point. After his ordination, Armstrong allied himself with two other rogue ministers by the names of Andrew N. Dugger and C. O. Dodd, both of whom had written a book called &quot;A History of the True Religion, from 33 AD to Date&quot;, in which they claimed that the New Testament Church of the first century had secretly descended through history and eventually became the Sabbath-keeping Church of God (Seventh Day). Dugger also predicted that the apocalypse would occur in 1936. Eventually, this led to Dugger and Dodd&#x27;s ouster and when they promised to make Armstrong an apostle in their new church, The Church of God (Seventh Day), he joined with them.

After severing ties with the Church of God (Seventh Day) as the result of doctrinal disputes, he began to teach a form of British Israelism, which would later make up his book &quot;The United States and Britain in Prophecy&quot;. His ministerial credentials with Dugger&#x27;s church were revoked in 1938. This, Armstrong believed, indicated God was now directing him in leading a revived work into the next &quot;church era.&quot;

==Radio and publishing==
In October 1933, a small 100-watt radio station in Eugene, Oregon, KORE, offered free time to Armstrong for a morning devotional, a 15-minute time slot shared by other local ministers. After positive responses from listeners, the station owner let Armstrong start a new program of his own. On the first Sunday in 1934, the Radio Church of God first aired. These broadcasts eventually became known as &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot; of the future Worldwide Church of God. Shortly thereafter, in February 1934, Armstrong began the publication of &quot;The Plain Truth&quot;, which started out as a church bulletin. It was at this time that Armstrong began to make prophetic claims and among them were the claims that Hitler and Mussolini were the prophesied Beast and False Prophet of the Book of Revelation who would deceive the nations for a short time just before the return of Jesus Christ. This piqued the interest of his audience. The broadcast expanded to other cities, and in 1942 began to be broadcast nationwide from WHO of Des Moines Iowa, a 50,000-watt superstation.

Critics point to statements in his early writings that proved to be inaccurate. For example, a statement from a lead article in the February 1939 edition of &quot;The Plain Truth&quot;, about a coming world war, said this:

By way of brief review of previous articles, and radio messages, notice, first, that this war will involve ALL nations. It will be the first real world war. Secondly, it will center around Jerusalem...And thirdly, this war will END with the Second Coming of Christ!

From his new contacts in Los Angeles, Armstrong began to realize the potential for reaching a much larger audience. He searched for a suitable location and chose Pasadena, California, as being ideal as it was a conservative residential community. During this time, Armstrong also reflected on starting a college to aid the growing church, by teaching and training young men and women. Hence, in 1946 Armstrong moved his headquarters from Eugene to Pasadena and on March 3, 1946, the Radio Church of God was officially incorporated within the state of California. He purchased a lavish mansion on Millionaires Row just off of the Rose Parade route on Orange Grove Boulevard, quickly acquired his own printing plant, and was broadcasting internationally in prime-time radio time slots. On October 8, 1947, his new college, Ambassador College opened its doors with four students.

==International expansion==
During the 1950s and 1960s, the church continued to expand and the radio program was broadcast in England, Australia, the Philippines, Latin America, and Africa. In 1953, &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot; began to air on Radio Luxembourg, making it possible to hear the program throughout much of Europe. The beginning of the European broadcast provides the context of a booklet published in 1956 called &quot;1975 in Prophecy!&quot; In this book Armstrong put forward a controversial vision of what the world could look like by 1975—featuring vivid illustrations by noted comics artist Basil Wolverton of mass burials and tidal waves destroying cities. Overall he thought that World War III and Christ&#x27;s glorious return were at the doorstep and that world peace and utopia would follow. Armstrong believed that God had exciting plans for mankind that would see the end of such wars—though the message went far beyond an earthly utopia.

Several books and booklets focused on the key events that would signal the imminence of Christ&#x27;s return, and taught of a specific end-time prophecy to be fulfilled, manifested in the form of European peacekeeping forces surrounding Jerusalem, at which time God&#x27;s Church would be taken to a place of protection, or &quot;place of safety&quot;—possibly Petra in Jordan. World War III was predicted to be triggered by a &quot;United States of Europe&quot; led by Germany which would destroy both the United States and the United Kingdom. From the place of safety they would continue the work and prepare to help Christ establish Utopia upon His return.

In 1952, Armstrong published &quot;Does God Heal Today?&quot;, which provided the details on his doctrine on healing and his ban on doctors. Among his tenets were that only God heals and that medical science is of pagan origin and is ineffective. He believed that most illnesses were caused by faulty diet and that doctors should prescribe proper diet rather than medicine. He taught that members are not to go to doctors for healing but must trust in divine healing alone. This was his teaching despite his father&#x27;s death in 1933 after &quot;an all-night vigil of prayer.&quot; This teaching has been the cause of much controversy as individuals influenced by such teachings came to die.

The book &quot;The United States and Britain in Prophecy&quot; was published in 1954. It became the most well-known and requested church publication, with over six million copies distributed. In this book, Armstrong makes the claim that the peoples of the United States, the British Commonwealth nations, and the nations of Northwestern Europe are descendants of the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel. This belief, called British Israelism, formed the central basis of the theology of the Worldwide Church of God.

Franz Josef Strauss, a major politician in post-WWII Germany, became the target of the broadcasting and publishing media blitz that Armstrong unleashed upon Europe through the daily offshore pirate radio station broadcasts by his son Garner Ted Armstrong, &quot;The Plain Truth&quot;, and the Ambassador College campus at Bricket Wood in Hertfordshire, England. Strauss was portrayed as being the coming Führer who would lead a United States of Europe into a prophetic World War III against the U.S. and U.K. at some time between 1972 and 1975, and emerge victorious. In 1971, Strauss played along with the prophetic interest shown in him, as Herbert W. Armstrong recalled in a 1983 letter: &quot;I entertained him at dinner in my home in Pasadena, and he spoke to the faculty and students of Ambassador College. I have maintained contact with him.&quot; Strauss appeared in an interview on &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot; television program.

The volume of literature requests for material written by Armstrong continued to grow during the 1960s and 1970s, and the literature was translated into several languages and distributed to a worldwide audience. They were distributed for free &quot;as a public service.&quot; &quot;The Plain Truth&quot; magazine continued to be published and circulated, eventually reaching a monthly press run of eight million.

On April 15, 1967, Armstrong&#x27;s wife Loma died, three and a half months before their 50th anniversary. Before she died he sent a co-worker a letter that has often been criticized for its harsh tone to &quot;failing&quot; members and for its calls for more money.

==Worldwide Church of God==

On January 5, 1968, the Radio Church of God was renamed the &quot;Worldwide Church of God&quot;. Shortly before, the church began to broadcast a television version of &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot;. The program would eventually expand to 382 U.S. television stations, and 36 television outlets internationally, dwarfing televangelists Jerry Falwell, Jimmy Swaggart, Oral Roberts, and Jim Bakker. By this time, Garner Ted Armstrong, the son of Herbert W. Armstrong, was the voice and face of the program. It was speculated that with his charisma and personality, he was the logical successor to Armstrong, but doctrinal disagreements and widespread reports of extramarital sex led to his suspension in 1972. After initially changing his behavior he returned, but these issues resurfaced, coupled with his challenging his father&#x27;s authority as Pastor General, resulting in him being permanently &quot;disfellowshipped&quot; (the church&#x27;s term for excommunication) in 1978.

==Ambassador International Cultural Foundation==
With the assistance of church accountant and adviser Stanley Rader, Armstrong created the Ambassador International Cultural Foundation in 1975. The foundation was funded by the church. The foundation&#x27;s efforts reached into several continents, providing staffing and funds to fight illiteracy, to create schools for the disabled, to set up mobile schools, and for several archaeological digs of biblically significant sites. These humanitarian projects led to Armstrong receiving a series of invitations to meet with prominent heads of state, including (among others) Margaret Thatcher, Emperor Hirohito of Japan, King Hussein of Jordan, and Indira Gandhi. Armstrong was also internationally recognized as Ambassador for World Peace.

==Final years==
In 1977, Armstrong, a widower in his 80s, married Ramona Martin, then 38, a long-time member and church secretary who had a 15-year-old son from a previous marriage. The controversial marriage would last for only a few years. The Armstrongs separated in 1982, with Herbert Armstrong returning to live in Pasadena full-time, and the marriage finally ended in divorce in 1984. During pre-trial proceedings in the divorce case, Armstrong&#x27;s lawyers had sought to limit evidence of &quot;prior incestuous conduct with his daughter for many years,&quot; but his wife&#x27;s attorneys said &quot;it was crucial since the church leader alleged Mrs. Armstrong had breached an agreement of love and fidelity.&quot;

In his latter years, Armstrong stated that he did not know whether or not Christ would return in his lifetime but did know, based on the sequence of events in the Bible, that the Lord&#x27;s return was approaching. He had long written of his belief that the primary sign to look for would be some sort of dissolving of the Eastern Bloc alliance under Soviet control, followed by those nations&#x27; subsequent incorporation into an eastern leg of a United States of Europe. In August 1985, Armstrong&#x27;s final work, &quot;Mystery of the Ages&quot;, was published. He wrote that &quot;time may prove this to be the most important book written in almost 1,900 years&quot; and called it a &quot;synopsis of the Bible in the most plain and understandable language.&quot; It was more or less a compendium of theological concepts, as articulated by Armstrong, which included the notion that God deliberately coded the bible &quot;so that it would not be understood until our modern time&quot;.

In September 1985, with his failing health widely known, Armstrong delivered his final sermon on the Feast of Trumpets in the Ambassador Auditorium. He spent his final days confined at his home on the college campus in Pasadena, California, on South Orange Grove Boulevard.

Almost until his final days, there was uncertainty about who would succeed Armstrong in the event of his death. The church&#x27;s Advisory Council of Elders, acting on a clause in church by-laws added in 1981, was to select a successor after his death, yet Armstrong reportedly worried about the ramifications if certain individuals were selected, such as his son Garner Ted or evangelist Roderick Meredith. Finally, Armstrong opted to select the next Pastor General personally. Armstrong told the Church&#x27;s Advisory Council of Elders of his decision to appoint evangelist-rank minister Joseph W. Tkach on January 7, 1986. Tkach had worked closely with former church executive Stanley R. Rader prior to Rader&#x27;s retirement from active service with the Church, and had been ordained to the ministerial rank of evangelist along with Rader and Ellis LaRavia in 1979.

Armstrong died shortly before 6:00 a.m. on January 16, 1986, only nine days after naming Tkach as his successor. He was 93. Approximately 4,000 people attended his funeral, including a number of political figures from other countries. He was buried in Altadena&#x27;s Mountain View Cemetery, between Loma and his mother, Eva Wright Armstrong. Evangelist Herman L. Hoeh, a long-time church member and one of the first graduates of Ambassador College, officiated at the graveside service, and Tkach gave the closing prayer.

In the years after his death in 1986, WCG leaders came to the conclusion that many of Armstrong&#x27;s theological arguments were not biblical, causing the church to reject his teachings as &quot;aberrant&quot; and to completely rewrite its doctrines. The vastly changed organization has come into full agreement with the statement of faith of the National Association of Evangelicals. In April 2009, in light of the major doctrinal shifts made, the church also changed its name to Grace Communion International (GCI) to better reflect its new teachings.

==Theology and teachings==

* Worldwide Church of God (WCG) members viewed Herbert W. Armstrong as having the Church rank of &quot;apostle&quot;. Armstrong taught that God works only through &quot;one man at a time&quot; and that he was God&#x27;s selected representative on earth.
* Armstrong taught a form of Sabbatarianism, explaining that; by creating the Sabbath (on the seventh day of creation, through resting – not working) God &quot;HALLOWED the seventh-day of every week (Ex. 20:11)&quot; and therefore made &quot;future TIME holy!&quot; Resting on the Sabbath day is thus commanded for all mankind and should be kept holy from Friday sunset to sunset on Saturday. The Worldwide Church of God conducted its worship Services during that period, accordingly, on Saturdays. Armstrong further explained that Christ is &quot;Lord of the Sabbath&quot; (Mt. 12:8) for it is He who &#x27;made&#x27; it for mankind, thus it is a &quot;blessing... to be ENJOYED, to spiritually REFRESH, in blessed fellowship and communion with CHRIST!&quot; He believed that the observance of Sunday as the &quot;Lord&#x27;s Day&quot; was a papal and/or satanic corruption introduced without authority from God or the Bible.
* Armstrong adhered to a form of British Israelism which stated that the British, American and many European peoples were descended from the so-called Ten Lost Tribes of Israel, using this belief to state that biblical references to Israel, Jacob, etc., were in fact prophecies relating to the modern day, with literal application to the US, Britain, and the British Commonwealth. In the course of this teaching, he also accepted the concept of an Assyrian-German connection and often made identifications of other nations in &quot;Bible prophecy&quot;, such as Russia and China.
* As a result of this, Armstrong believed that a unified Europe (identified by him as a &quot;revived Roman Empire&quot; and as the first-mentioned &quot;beast&quot; of Revelation 13) would oppose Jesus at his second coming in the battle at Armageddon. Furthermore, he stated repeatedly that a unified Europe would have previously defeated and enslaved the American and British peoples. He often pointed to the European &quot;Common Market&quot; or European Community as its precursor, but tended to refer to it as &quot;a kind of United States of Europe.&quot; Splinter groups who were previously members of the Worldwide Church of God usually identify the European Union as the unified Europe to which Armstrong devoted much writing.
* Armstrong taught that God&#x27;s purpose in creating mankind was to &quot;reproduce Himself&quot;, and that the process of being &quot;born again&quot; was not instantaneous — that the believer (as a result of baptism by immersion) was only &quot;begotten&quot; until reborn as a spirit being at the return of Jesus. These &quot;begotten&quot; believers were referred to as being &quot;firstfruits&quot; of a divine harvest and &quot;true Christians&quot; of the existing age. The birth of those spiritually &quot;begotten&quot; occurring at the time of Christ&#x27;s return, at the &quot;first resurrection.&quot; As Christ is &quot;the FIRST born from the dead&quot; (Col. 1:18), Armstrong concluded that many other &quot;sons&quot; (begotten by God&#x27;s Spirit) would also be brought &quot;to glory&quot; (Heb. 2:10) at that &quot;first resurrection&quot; (Rev. 20:5). Those &#x27;begotten&#x27; will then be instantaneously &#x27;born anew&#x27; (John 3:3) but not again, &quot;a second time&quot;, as &quot;perishable&quot; flesh and blood mortals (1 Cor. 15:53) but as &quot;imperishable&quot;, immortal Spirit &#x27;God&#x27; beings. He concluded that; &quot;Until the resurrection, therefore, we cannot see, enter into or inherit the Kingdom of God. WE CANNOT BE BORN AGAIN UNTIL THE RESURRECTION!&quot;
* Armstrong preached that Jesus Christ will return to earth to &quot;rescue&quot; humanity from the brink of self-annihilation, resulting in the establishment of &quot;God&#x27;s government&quot; upon earth, during a &#x27;Millennium&#x27; period, under the rulership of Christ and first-resurrected saints. After His return, those surviving the &quot;great tribulation&quot; will be given the chance to voluntarily accept &quot;God&#x27;s way of life.&quot; Christ is in heaven &quot;until&quot; the &quot;times of restitution&quot; (Acts 3:19–21) when God&#x27;s government, world peace and utopian conditions shall be restored to this earth.
* Armstrong did not accept the concept of eternal judgment in this life. He believed that those who die as unbelievers prior to the return of Christ, exist in a state of &quot;unconsciousness&quot; (see Soul sleep) until after the &#x27;Millennium&#x27; at the second resurrection, during which they will be offered the choice to submit to God&#x27;s government. All those incorrigibly wicked, those who refuse to accept God&#x27;s government and laws being judged guilty of rebellion against God to rise in a third resurrection, &amp; thrown into &#x27;Gehenna&#x27; fire. Including persons who had committed the &quot;unpardonable sin&quot;. Such persons suffering eternal death. Armstrong identified such as being the &quot;second death&quot; mentioned in the Book of Revelation.
* In Armstrong&#x27;s view, the scourging of Jesus prior to crucifixion &quot;paid the penalty&quot; for physical disease and sickness, allowing the option of divine healing. The crucifixion itself was considered to be the act which enabled God to allow humanity into the three-tiered resurrection scheme, as Jesus had paid the initial death penalty for breaking the Law.
* Armstrong did not accept Trinitarianism, believing it to be a doctrine of satanic authorship as part of a &quot;counterfeit Christianity&quot; (which he identified as the Roman Catholic Church). Armstrong taught that the Father and the Word were co-eternal, but that the Holy Spirit was not an actual person. He believed that the Holy Spirit was part of God&#x27;s essence, a power emanating from him that suffused all creation, and especially believers, and through which God was omnipresent and able to act at all places and at all times.
* Because of his teachings identifying both the primacy of Sabbath and the &quot;identity of modern Israel&quot;, Armstrong would come to accept that the Mosaic Law had not been &quot;done away.&quot; Although he excluded certain segments he regarded as &quot;already fulfilled&quot;, &quot;ceremonial&quot; or otherwise unfit, he taught adherence to the Levitical food regulations and the observance of the &quot;Holy Days&quot; of the Mosaic Law. The Worldwide Church of God taught seven &#x27;Festivals of God&#x27; (Passover, Days of Unleavened Bread, Pentecost, Feast of Trumpets, Day of Atonement, Feast of Tabernacles, Last Great Day) and regarded such to be &#x27;worship&#x27; days including Sukkot or &quot;Feast of Tabernacles.&quot; The latter was practiced by setting up church &quot;conventions&quot; in various cities worldwide to which their various congregations had to attend, leaving homes and booking into hotel-type accommodation. For many, this eight-day festival was a &#x27;highlight&#x27; of the year.
* As part of a larger paradigm in which common observances were often discarded, Armstrong rejected traditional holidays such as Christmas, Easter, Halloween and the celebration of birthdays, stating that all of these were of pagan origin. A similar principle extended also to the display of crosses and depictions of Jesus.
* Armstrong placed much emphasis on faith in God for healing and taught against the medical practice, except in the case of &quot;repair&quot; (setting of broken bones, cleansing of wounds, etc.). Medical intervention was consequently frowned-upon, there were consequently numerous controversial incidents involving death of members or member&#x27;s children due to lack of medical attention. Armstrong spoke highly of principles of good diet (outside of the Levitical food regulations) and proper living, and members of the Worldwide Church of God as a result tended to gravitate towards whole grains, home-grown vegetables etc., although such acts were not an express tenet of faith.
* Armstrong taught against fornication, masturbation, adultery, homosexuality, and other practices he viewed as aberrations, authoring the book &quot;God Speaks Out On The &#x27;New Morality&quot; (later retitled &quot;The Missing Dimension in Sex&quot;) on the subject. As a result of this fundamentalist view on morality, he also taught against the use of cosmetics, long hair on men, and other matters of personal appearance.
* Armstrong and the Worldwide Church of God viewed Revelation 2 and 3, (which contains seven messages to seven churches in Asia Minor at the time of its writing), to also be descriptive of seven &quot;church eras&quot; to pass, in chronological order. He stated that the &quot;Sardis&quot; era ended with his severance from the Church of God (Seventh-Day) and that the &quot;Philadelphia&quot; era officially began in October 1933. &quot;Laodicea&quot; would follow wherein lukewarmness would be the &quot;dominant Church attitude at the end.&quot; His great concern was that they, &quot;undoubtedly of the Philadelphia era&quot;, were &quot;in serious danger of BECOMING also the Laodicean era.&quot; He apparently modified such era teaching from an earlier version preached by a previous Church of God, Seventh Day minister, G. G. Rupert. This concept has assumed greater importance among WCG splinter groups, as those that practice Armstrong&#x27;s teachings tend to view the modern Worldwide Church of God (and sometimes other splinter groups) as &quot;Laodicean&quot; or entirely Protestant.
* Armstrong instituted a three-tiered annual tithing process for his followers. The first tithe (10% of member&#x27;s gross household income) went to the Worldwide Church of God organization, which viewed itself as the &quot;Melchizedek priesthood&quot; with Jesus Christ as the High Priest with the rank of Melchizedek, which priesthood superseded the Levitical priesthood, and thereby entitled to support by tithes. The second tithe (a second 10% of member&#x27;s gross household income) was saved by members and used as individual support during the &quot;Feast of Tabernacles.&quot; The third tithe (a third 10% of members gross household income), which was paid every three years per member, was used to support widows and other members in need. The church did not overtly solicit funds from outside but did accept donations from &quot;co-workers&quot; and commonly sent &quot;co-worker&quot; letters that often called for money to be sent.

==Criticism and controversy==
Armstrong&#x27;s teachings and the church he created have been the subject of much criticism and controversy. Armstrong&#x27;s theology and teachings are defended by his followers, but face criticism from ex-followers and the greater Christian community. Common points of criticism and controversy include:

===Theological===
* Salvation: Armstrong believed that repentance, faith and the indwelling of God&#x27;s Holy Spirit enables true and full obedience to God&#x27;s law, but stressed that keeping God&#x27;s law (and repentance upon having sinned) is a requirement for salvation. Critics state that Armstrong taught salvation as being legalistic obedience to God&#x27;s law, including such laws as Sabbath keeping, dietary laws, and other laws kept by Ancient Israelites but not typically kept by &#x27;mainstream&#x27; Christian denominations.
* The Covenants: Armstrong taught that the New Covenant is an &#x27;amplification&#x27; of the Old Covenant, and that certain laws (excluding temple and unenforceable ancient civil laws) from the Old Covenant are still in effect for Christians. This included laws such as literal Sabbath keeping, &#x27;Clean and Unclean&#x27; meats and Holy Day observances. He believed that the New Covenant was yet future, to be finalized as a marriage covenant between Christ and the Church and that Christians currently existed &#x27;between&#x27; the two Covenants. Critics say that Armstrong confused the two Covenants and selectively picked which aspects of the two Covenants to keep.
* Gospel of the Kingdom: Armstrong taught that a reason for Jesus Christ&#x27;s presence on earth was to proclaim the Gospel message of a literal Kingdom of God that will be established on earth at Christ&#x27;s &#x27;second coming&#x27;, and that the message of the Kingdom should be the focus of the gospel rather than the person of Christ. Critics indicate that this represents a diminishment of the person and importance of Christ, through whom salvation is attained, and that this represents a flawed understanding about the nature of the Kingdom. Armstrong taught that – the gospel &quot;of&quot; Christ – began to change to – a gospel &quot;about&quot; Christ – around twenty to thirty years after the founding of the Church in 31 A.D. He made the extraordinary claim that the gospel Christ brought (of the Kingdom) had &quot;not been proclaimed to the world&quot; for about 1,900 years &quot;until the first week in 1953&quot; when he began preaching it again on Radio Luxembourg.
* Prophetic predictions: Proponents believe that Herbert Armstrong was inspired by God and had the gift to understand prophecy. They believe that many of his predictions were inspired. Armstrong was considered gifted with spiritual understanding also and that, through him, God was revealing the true meaning of parts of the Bible which, till his time, had remained locked or sealed (so could not be correctly understood). That desire for understanding had been with Armstrong since he was a small boy, &quot;always wanting to know &#x27;why?&#x27; or &#x27;how?&#x27; That obsession for understanding was to have a great influence on founding the Plain Truth magazine and Ambassador College in later years.&quot; According to critics, Armstrong&#x27;s predictions were rife with speculation and remain mostly unfulfilled.
* British Israelism: Armstrong taught a form of British Israelism, which is the belief that those of Western European descent, notably England (Ephraim) and the United States (Manasseh), are direct descendants of the ancient northern Kingdom of Israel. This theory is inconsistent with the findings of modern research on the genetic history of Jews. It is commonly criticized for poor standards of research, and general inconsistency with archeological, anthropological and linguistic research.

===Personality, personal conduct, and governance===
Armstrong was often criticized for having lived in extravagant wealth in comparison to a few church members. Personal luxuries enjoyed by Armstrong included a personal jet, the finest clothing, furniture and other conveniences.

===Teachings inferred from the Bible===
Armstrong taught that the observance of principles that he believed could be inferred from biblical intent. Examples of these teachings include:
* Women were not allowed to wear makeup because it was believed that this was not pleasing to God. Armstrong stated

God&#x27;s Church, the now imminent Bride of Christ, is not going to rise to meet the returning Christ in the air with painted faces and plucked and repainted eyebrows! How cleverly, without our suspecting it, did Satan influence leading ministers to derail the Church in many ways!...Now JESUS CHRIST, through His chosen apostle, is going to RULE on this question once and for all!...How did it get into our mid-and-latter 20th century society? FROM PROSTITUTES!...Women do not use makeup to PLEASE GOD today – for I can tell you ON HIS AUTHORITY it is NOT pleasing to HIM!
* The use of medicine and doctors was discouraged because members were expected to place their faith in God for healing. Armstrong stated:

Here&#x27;s God&#x27;s instruction to YOU, today, if you are ill. If we are to live by every Word of God, we should obey this Scripture. God does not say call your family physician...He does not say, call the doctors and let them give medicines and drugs, and God will cause the medicines and drugs and dope to cure you... Instead God says call GOD&#x27;S MINISTERS. And let them PRAY, anointing with oil (the type and symbol of the Holy Spirit). Then GOD PROMISES He will HEAL YOU!
* Various members suffered discomfort and even death due to reluctance to resort to medical help, yet Armstrong made use of doctors and medicine later in his life.
* At least one writer, Jerald Walker, with experience of Armstrong’s sermons, spoke of his racism: segregation was to be enforced on earth as it was expected to be enforced in heaven. In Armstrong’s view, black people were to serve white people.
* Divorce was strongly discouraged. At times this was strictly enforced by requiring members that had previously divorced and remarried to divorce their new spouses so that they were not &quot;living in adultery&quot;. Armstrong acknowledged that this belief caused significant hardship for many members but argued that this hardship was the consequent result of the earlier &#x27;sin of divorce&#x27;. This policy was changed by Armstrong at a later time. Interracial marriage was also discouraged as Armstrong emphasized requirements for Ancient Israelites (who, according to British Israelism, became Western Europeans) to remain racially and religiously separate from other nations.
* As the Bible teaches that &quot;the body is the temple of God&#x27;s Spirit,&quot; Armstrong believed that it should therefore be kept in good health and presented in a manner glorifying to Christ. Members were consequently expected to conform to strict dress codes. Long hair and piercings were not allowed for men, whereas makeup and short hair were frowned upon for women. Members were expected to dress conservatively and modestly, and required to do so for church. Smoking was considered to be a spiritual sin and was grounds for a minister to refuse baptism. Critics contend that these requirements base salvation on the &#x27;teachings of men&#x27; rather than the grace of God or the instructions of the Bible.
* Armstrong concluded that a third resurrection would take place, in which the incorrigibly wicked and those who had been converted (baptized members of WCG) but had &#x27;fallen away&#x27; (left WCG) and who also had not repented in the &quot;Great Tribulation&quot; would be resurrected and sentenced to eternal death in the &#x27;lake of fire.&#x27; Critics reject this interpretation.

<doc id="157841" wikidata="Q146095" url="?curid=157841" title="Viola (plant)">
<text>Viola is a genus of flowering plants in the violet family Violaceae. It is the largest genus in the family, containing over 680 species. Most species are found in the temperate Northern Hemisphere; however, some are also found in widely divergent areas such as Hawaii, Australasia, and the Andes.

Some &quot;Viola&quot; species are perennial plants, some are annual plants, and a few are small shrubs. Many species, varieties and cultivars are grown in gardens for their ornamental flowers. In horticulture, the term pansy is normally used for those multi-colored large-flowered cultivars which are raised annually or biennially from seed and used extensively in bedding. The terms viola and violet are normally reserved for small-flowered annuals or perennials, including the wild species.

==Description==

Annual or perennial caulescent or acaulescent (with or without a visible plant stem above the ground) herbs, shrubs or very rarely treelets. In acaulescent taxa the foliage and flowers appear to rise from the ground. The remainder have short stems with foliage and flowers produced in the axils of the leaves (axillary).

&quot;Viola&quot; typically have heart-shaped or reniform (kidney-shaped), scalloped leaves, though a number have linear or palmate leaves. The simple leaves of plants with either habit are arranged alternately; the acaulescent species produce basal rosettes. Plants always have leaves with stipules that are often leaf-like.

The flowers of the vast majority of the species are strongly zygomorphic with bilateral symmetry and solitary, but occasionally form cymes. The flowers are formed from five petals; four are upswept or fan-shaped with two per side, and there is one, broad, lobed lower petal pointing downward. This petal may be slightly or much shorter than the others and is weakly differentiated. The shape of the petals and placement defines many species, for example, some species have a &quot;spur&quot; on the end of each petal while most have a spur on the lower petal. The spur may vary from scarcely exserted (projecting) to very long, such as in &quot;Viola rostrata&quot;.

Solitary flowers end long stalks with a pair of bracteoles. The flowers have five sepals that persist after blooming, and in some species the sepals enlarge after blooming. The corolla ranges from white to yellow, orange or various shades of blue and violet or multicolored, often blue and yellow, with or without a yellow throat.

The flowers have five free stamens with short free filaments that are oppressed against the ovary, with a dorsal connective appendage that is large, entire and oblong to ovate. Only the lower two stamens are calcarate (possessing nectary spurs that are inserted on the lowest petal into the spur or a pouch). The styles are filiform (threadlike) or clavate (clubshaped), thickened at their tip, being globose to rostellate (beaked). The stigmas are head-like, narrowed or often beaked. The flowers have a superior ovary with one cell, which has three placentae, containing many ovules.

After flowering, fruit capsules are produced that are thick walled, with few to many seeds per carpel, and dehisce (split open) by way of three valves. On drying, the capsules may eject seeds with considerable force to distances of several meters. The nutlike seeds, which are obovoid to globose, are typically arillate (with a specialized outgrowth) and have straight embryos, flat cotyledons, and soft fleshy endosperm that is oily.

One characteristic of some &quot;Viola&quot; is the elusive scent of their flowers; along with terpenes, a major component of the scent is a ketone compound called ionone, which temporarily desensitizes the receptors of the nose, thus preventing any further scent being detected from the flower until the nerves recover.

==Taxonomy==
===History===
First formally described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 with 19 species, the genus &quot;Viola&quot; bears his botanical authority, L. When Jussieu established the hierarchical system of families (1789), he placed Viola in the Cisti (rock roses), though by 1811 he suggested Viola be separated from these. However, in 1802 Batsch had already established a separate family, which he called Violariae based on Viola as the type genus, with seven other genera. Although Violariae continued to be used by some authors, such as Bentham and Hooker in 1862 (as Violarieae), most authors adopted the alternative name Violaceae, first proposed by de Lamarck and de Candolle in 1805, and Gingins (1823) and Saint-Hilaire (1824). However de Candolle also used Violarieae in his 1824 &quot;Prodromus&quot;.

===Phylogeny===
&quot;Viola&quot; is one of about 25 genera and about 600 species in the large eudicot family Violaceae, divided into subfamilies and tribes. While most genera are monotypic, &quot;Viola&quot; is a very large genus, variously circumscribed as having between 500 and 600 species. Historically it was placed in subfamily Violoideae, tribe Violeae. But these divisions have been shown to be artificial and not monophyletic. Molecular phylogenetic studies show that &quot;Viola&quot; occurs in Clade I of the family, as &quot;Viola&quot;, &quot;Schweiggeria&quot;, &quot;Noisettia&quot; and &quot;Allexis&quot;, in which &quot;Schweiggeria&quot; and &quot;Noisettia&quot; are monotypic and form a sister group to &quot;Viola&quot;.

===Subdivision===
&quot;Viola&quot; is a large genus that has traditionally been treated in sections. One of these was that of Gingins (1823), based on stigma morphology, with five sections (&quot;Nomimium&quot;, &quot;Dischidium&quot;, &quot;Chamaemelanium&quot;, &quot;Melanium&quot;, &quot;Leptidium&quot;). The extensive taxonomic studies of Wilhelm Becker, culminating in his 1925 conspectus, resulted in 14 sections and many infrasectional groups. The largest and most diverse, being section &quot;Viola&quot;, with 17 subsections. In addition to subsections, series were also described. Alternatively, some authors have preferred to subdivide the genus into subgenera. Subsequent treatments were by Gershoy (1934) and Clausen (1964), using subsections and series. These were all based on morphological characteristics. Subsequent studies using molecular phylogenetic methods, such as that of Ballard et al. (1998) have shown that many of these traditional divisions are not monophyletic, the problem being related to a high degree of hybridization. In particular section &quot;Nomimium&quot; was dismembered into several new sections and transferring part of it to section &quot;Viola&quot;. Section Viola &quot;s. lat.&quot; is represented by four sections, &quot;Viola&quot; &quot;sensu stricto&quot;, &quot;Plagiostigma&quot; &quot;s. str.&quot;, &quot;Nosphinium&quot; &quot;sensu lato&quot;. and the &quot;V. spathulata&quot; group. In that analysis, the S American sections appear to be the basal groups, starting with &quot;Rubellium&quot;, then &quot;Leptidium&quot;. However, the exact phylogenetic relationships remain unresolved, as a consequence many different taxonomic nomenclatures are in use, including groupings referred to as Grex. Marcussen et al. place the five S American sections, &quot;Andinium&quot;, &quot;Leptidium&quot;, &quot;Tridens&quot;, &quot;Rubellium&quot; and &quot;Chilenium&quot; at the base of the phylogenetic tree, in that order. These are followed by the single Australian section, &quot;Erpetion&quot;, as sister group to &quot;Chilenium&quot;, the northern hemisphere sections and finally the single African section, &quot;V. abyssinica&quot;. These sections are morphologically, chromosomally, and geographically distinct.

===Evolution and biogeography===
One fossil seed of †Viola rimosa has been extracted from borehole samples of the Middle Miocene fresh water deposits in Nowy Sacz Basin, West Carpathians, Poland. The genus is thought to have arisen in S America, most likely the Andes.

===Genetics===
Habitat fragmentation has been shown to have minimal effect on the genetic diversity and gene flow of the North American woodland violet &quot;Viola pubescens.&quot; This may be partially attributed to the ability of &quot;Viola pubescens&quot; to continue to persist within a largely agricultural matrix. This trend of unexpectedly high genetic diversity is also observed in &quot;Viola palmensis&quot;, a Canary Island endemic known only from a 15 square kilometer range on La palma island. High levels of genetic diversity within these species indicate that these plants are outcrossing, even though many violet species can produce many clonal offspring throughout the year via cleistogamous flowers. Plants that produce copious amounts of clonal seeds from cleistogamous flowers often experience increased levels of inbreeding. These reportedly high rates of outcrossing and genetic diversity indicate that these violets are strong competitors for pollinators during the early spring when they are in bloom and that those pollinators can travel considerable distances between often fragmented populations.

==Distribution and habitat==
The worldwide northern temperate distribution of the genus distinguishes it from the remaining largely tropical Violaceae genera, restricted to either Old World or New World species, while in the tropics the distribution is primarily in high mountainous areas. Centres of diversity occur mainly in the northern hemisphere, in mountainous regions of eastern Asia, Melanesia, and southern Europe, but also occur in the Andes and the southern Patagonian cone of South America. One of the highest species concentrations is in the former USSR. Australia is home to a number of &quot;Viola&quot; species, including &quot;Viola hederacea&quot;, &quot;Viola betonicifolia&quot; and &quot;Viola banksii&quot;, first collected by Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander on the Cook voyage to Botany Bay.

==Ecology==
&quot;Viola&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including the giant leopard moth, large yellow underwing, lesser broad-bordered yellow underwing, high brown fritillary, small pearl-bordered fritillary, pearl-bordered fritillary, regal fritillary, cardinal, and Setaceous Hebrew character. The larvae of many fritilary butterfly species use violets as an obligate host plant, although these butterflies do not always ovaposit directly onto violets. While the ecology of this genera is extremely diverse, violets are mainly pollinated by members within the orders Diptera and Hymenoptera. Showy flowers are produced in early spring, and clonal cleistogamous flowers are produced from late spring until the end of the growing season under favorable conditions. Cleistogamy allows plants to produce offspring year round and have more chances for establishment. This system is especially important in violets, as these plants are often weak competitors for pollination due to their small size.

Many violet species exhibit two modes of seed dispersal. Once seed capsules have matured, seeds are dispelled around the plant through explosive dehiscence. &quot;Viola pedata&quot; seeds have been reported being dispersed distances of up to 5 meters away from the parent plant. Often, seeds are then further dispersed by ants through a process called myrmecochory. Violets whose seeds are dispersed this way have specialized structures on the exterior of the seeds called elaiosomes. This interaction allows violet seed to germinate and establish in a protected, stable environment.

Many violet seeds exhibit physiological dormancy and require some period of cold stratification to induce germination under &quot;ex situ&quot; conditions. Rates of germination are often quite poor, especially when seeds are stored for extended periods of time. In North American habitat restoration, native violets are in high demand due to their relationship with the aforementioned fritillary butterflies.

Violet species occupy a diverse array of habitats, from bogs (&quot;Viola lanceolata&quot;) to dry hill prairies (&quot;V. pedata&quot;) to woodland understories (&quot;V. labradorica&quot;). While many of these species are indicators of high quality habitat, some violets are capable of thriving in a human altered landscape. Two species of zinc violet (&quot;V. calaminaria&quot; and &quot;V. guestphalica&quot;) are capable of living in soils severely contaminated with heavy metals. Many violets form relationships with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and in the case of the zinc violets, this allows them to tolerate such highly contaminated soils.

Flowering is often profuse, and may last for much of the spring and summer. &quot;Viola&quot; are most often spring-blooming with chasmogamous flowers that have well-developed petals pollinated by insects. Many species also produce self-pollinated cleistogamous flowers in summer and autumn that do not open and lack petals. In some species the showy chasmogamous flowers are infertile (e.g.,&quot;Viola sororia&quot;).

==Horticultural uses==
The international registration authority for the genus is the American Violet Society, where growers register new Viola cultivars. A coding system is used for cultivar description of ten horticultural divisions, such as Violet (Vt) and Violetta (Vtta). Examples include &quot;Viola&quot; &#x27;Little David&#x27; (Vtta) and &quot;Viola&quot; &#x27;Königin Charlotte&#x27; (Vt).

In this system violets (Vt) are defined as &quot;stoloniferous perennials with small, highly fragrant, self-coloured purple, blue or white flowers in late winter and early spring&quot;.

===Species and cultivars===

Many species, varieties and cultivars are grown in gardens for their ornamental flowers. In horticulture the term pansy is normally used for those multi-colored, large-flowered cultivars which are raised annually or biennially from seed and used extensively in bedding. The terms viola and violet are normally reserved for small-flowered annuals or perennials, including the wild species.

Cultivars of &quot;Viola cornuta&quot;, &quot;Viola cucullata&quot;, and &quot;Viola odorata&quot;, are commonly grown from seed. Other species often grown include &quot;Viola labradorica&quot;, &quot;Viola pedata&quot;, and &quot;Viola rotundifolia&quot;.

The modern garden pansy (&quot;V. &quot;×&quot; wittrockiana&quot;) is a plant of complex hybrid origin involving at least three species, &quot;V. tricolor&quot; (wild pansy or heartsease), &quot;V. altaica&quot;, and &quot;V. lutea&quot; (mountain pansy). The hybrid horned pansy (&quot;V.&quot; × &quot;williamsii&quot;) originates from hybridization involving garden pansy and &quot;Viola cornuta&quot;.

===Bedding plants===
In 2005 in the United States, &quot;Viola&quot; cultivars (including pansies) were one of the top three bedding plant crops and 111 million dollars worth of flats of &quot;Viola&quot; were produced for the bedding flower market. Pansies and violas used for bedding are generally raised from seed, and F1 hybrid seed strains have been developed which produce compact plants of reasonably consistent flower coloring and appearance. Bedding plants are usually discarded after one growing season.

===Perennial cultivars===

There are hundreds of perennial viola and violetta cultivars; many of these do not breed true from seed and therefore have to be propagated from cuttings. Violettas can be distinguished from violas by the lack of ray markings on their petals. The following cultivars, of mixed or uncertain parentage, have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:

* &#x27;Aspasia&#x27;
* &#x27;Clementina&#x27;
* &#x27;Huntercombe Purple&#x27;
* &#x27;Jackanapes&#x27;
* &#x27;Molly Sanderson&#x27; 
* &#x27;Moonlight&#x27;
* &#x27;Nellie Britton&#x27;
Other popular examples include:

*&#x27;Ardross Gem&#x27; (viola)
*&#x27;Blackjack&#x27;
*&#x27;Buttercup&#x27; (violetta)
*&#x27;Columbine&#x27; (viola)
*&#x27;Dawn&#x27; (violetta)
*&#x27;Etain&#x27; (viola)
*&#x27;Irish Molly&#x27; (viola)
*&#x27;Maggie Mott&#x27; (viola)
*&#x27;Martin&#x27; (viola)
*&#x27;Rebecca&#x27; (violetta)
*&#x27;Vita&#x27; (viola)
*&#x27;Zoe&#x27; (violetta)
==Other uses==
===Culinary===

When newly opened, &quot;Viola&quot; flowers may be used to decorate salads or in stuffings for poultry or fish. Soufflés, cream, and similar desserts can be flavoured with essence of &quot;Viola&quot; flowers. The young leaves are edible raw or cooked as a mild-tasting leaf vegetable. The flowers and leaves of the cultivar &#x27;Rebecca&#x27;, one of the Violetta violets, have a distinct vanilla flavor with hints of wintergreen. The pungent perfume of some varieties of &quot;V. odorata&quot; adds inimitable sweetness to desserts, fruit salads, and teas while the mild pea flavor of &quot;V. tricolor&quot; combines equally well with sweet or savory foods, like grilled meats and steamed vegetables. The heart-shaped leaves of &quot;V. odorata&quot; provide a free source of greens throughout a long growing season, while the petals are used for fragrant flavoring in milk puddings and ice cream or in salads and as garnishes.

A candied violet or crystallized violet is a flower, usually of &quot;Viola odorata&quot;, preserved by a coating of egg white and crystallised sugar. Alternatively, hot syrup is poured over the fresh flower (or the flower is immersed in the syrup) and stirred until the sugar recrystallizes and has dried. This method is still used for rose petals and was applied to orange flowers in the past (when almonds or orange peel are treated this way they are called pralines). Candied violets are still made commercially in Toulouse, France, where they are known as &quot;violettes de Toulouse&quot;. They are used as decorating cakes or trifles or included in aromatic desserts.

The French are also known for their violet syrup, most commonly made from an extract of violets. In the United States, this French violet syrup is used to make violet scones and marshmallows. &quot;Viola&quot; essence flavours the liqueurs Creme Yvette, Creme de Violette, and Parfait d&#x27;Amour. It is also used in confectionery, such as Parma Violets and C. Howard&#x27;s Violet candies.

===Medicinal===
Many &quot;Viola&quot; species contain antioxidants called anthocyanins. Fourteen anthocyanins from &quot;V. yedoensis&quot; and &quot;V. prionantha&quot; have been identified. Some anthocyanins show strong antioxidant activities. Most violas tested and many other plants of the family Violaceae contain cyclotides, which have a diverse range of &quot;in vitro&quot; biological activities when isolated from the plant, including uterotonic, anti-HIV, antimicrobial, and insecticidal activities. &quot;Viola canescens,&quot; a species from India, exhibited &quot;in vitro&quot; activity against &quot;Trypanosoma cruzi&quot;.

Viola has been evaluated in different clinical indications in human studies. A double blind clinical trial showed that the adjuvant use of &quot;Viola odorata&quot; syrup with short-acting β-agonists can improve the cough suppression in children with asthma. In another study intranasal administration of &quot;Viola odorata&quot; extract oil showed to be effective in patients with insomnia. Topical use of an herbal formulation containing &quot;Viola tricolor&quot; extract also showed promising effects in patients with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis.

===Perfume===
&quot;Viola odorata&quot; is used as a source for scents in the perfume industry. Violet is known to have a &#x27;flirty&#x27; scent as its fragrance comes and goes. Ionone is present in the flowers, which turns off the ability for humans to smell the fragrant compound for moments at a time.

==Cultural associations==

===Birth===
Violet is the traditional birth flower for February in English tradition.

===Geographical territories===
In the United States, the common blue violet &quot;Viola sororia&quot; is the state flower of Illinois, Rhode Island, New Jersey and Wisconsin. In Canada, the &quot;Viola cucullata&quot; is the provincial flower of New Brunswick, adopted in 1936. In the United Kingdom, &quot;Viola riviniana&quot; is the county flower of Lincolnshire.

===Lesbian and bisexual culture===
Violets became symbolically associated with romantic love between women. This connection originates from fragments of a poem by Sappho about a lost love, in which she describes her as &quot;Close by my side you put around yourself [many wreaths] of violets and roses.&quot; In another poem, Sappho describes her lost love as wearing &quot;violet tiaras, braided rosebuds, dill and crocus twined around&quot; her neck. In 1926, one of the first plays to involve a lesbian relationship, &quot;La Prisonnière&quot; by Édouard Bourdet, used a bouquet of violets to signify lesbian love.

===Tributes===

Violets, and badges depicting them,
were sold in fund-raising efforts in Australia and New Zealand on and around Violet Day in commemoration of the lost soldiers of World War I.

<text>Grace Communion International (GCI), formerly named the Radio Church of God (RCG) and the Worldwide Church of God (WCG), is a Christian denomination based in Charlotte, North Carolina.

According to the organization&#x27;s website, the denomination has 30,000 members in 550 churches in 70 countries, is structured in the episcopal model and is a member of the National Association of Evangelicals.

== Founding ==
In 1934, Herbert W. Armstrong, an advertising agent turned radio- and televangelist, founded the Radio Church of God, a radio ministry in Eugene, Oregon. Armstrong&#x27;s biography states that he had been ordained in 1931 by the Oregon Conference of the Church of God (Seventh Day), an Adventist group, but split with them in 1933. On January 7, 1934, Armstrong began hosting a broadcast on a local 100-watt radio station KORE in Eugene. The program was essentially a condensed church service on the air, with hymn singing featured along with Armstrong&#x27;s message. Armstrong later named his program &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot;, perhaps inspired by the theme of the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair, &quot;The World of Tomorrow&quot;. To facilitate the work of the growing church, Armstrong incorporated it on March 3, 1946, as the &quot;Radio Church of God&quot;. Although his views were rejected by the local congregation, he gained a following through his &quot;World Tomorrow&quot; broadcasts and &quot;The Plain Truth&quot; magazine. 

In 1947, Armstrong incorporated his California ministry, relocated the church&#x27;s headquarters to Pasadena, California, and founded Ambassador College as the denomination&#x27;s educational arm. The broadcast of &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot; went into Europe on Radio Luxembourg on January 7, 1953. In 1968, the movement was renamed the Worldwide Church of God (WCG).

== Under Herbert W. Armstrong (1934–1986) ==

The Worldwide Church of God adhered to the teachings of its founder, Herbert W. Armstrong, until his death. Armstrong practiced a blend of Christian fundamentalism with some tenets of Judaism and Seventh-Day Sabbath doctrine. Armstrong preached that Britain and the United States were populated by descendants of two &quot;lost tribes&quot; of Ancient Israel. Armstrong&#x27;s doctrine included strict observation of the Saturday Sabbath, annual festivals and holy days described in Leviticus Chapter 23; the distinction between the flesh of ritually clean and unclean animals listed in Leviticus Chapter 11; the forbidding of medical interventions, and the required payment of three tithes to the church. Armstrong rejected what he regarded as pagan practices and beliefs that had been absorbed into mainstream Christianity. These included the idea of the holy Trinity, and the celebrations of Christmas, Easter, Halloween, and birthdays. Members were encouraged to follow a dress code during services. Armstrong&#x27;s doctrine strictly opposed divorce and remarriage, and encouraged members who had divorced to seek reconciliation with their former spouses, even if they had remarried. 

Armstrong explained that those &quot;called&quot; by God, who believed the gospel of the Kingdom, and received God&#x27;s Spirit upon full-immersion baptism, became part of the true, biblical, &#x27;Church of God&#x27;. Ministers were obligated to &quot;disfellowship&quot; any in their congregations who caused trouble or division. Such &quot;disfellowshipments&quot; were announced at services before the assembled congregation.

In 1956, Armstrong published &quot;1975 in Prophecy!&quot;, a pamphlet that predicted catastrophic draught, famine, and epidemic disease in the United States between 1965 and 1972, as well as an upcoming nuclear world war instigated by underground German Nazis, the subsequent enslavement of Christians in Europe, concluding in the return of Jesus Christ. Armstrong predicted that these events would take place for three-and-a-half years, and would conclude by 1975. Because of Armstrong&#x27;s emphasis on these prophetic dates, the church grew quickly in the late 1960s. On January 5, 1968, the church was renamed the &quot;Worldwide Church of God&quot;.

By the mid-1950s, Armstrong had his son Garner Ted Armstrong take over as host of the radio and television versions of &quot;The World&quot; &quot;Tomorrow.&quot; By the late 1960s, Garner Ted was executive vice president of the church, vice-chancellor of Ambassador College (which by then had two more campuses in Texas and the United Kingdom), and executive editor of church publications including &quot;Tomorrow’s World, Good News,&quot; and &quot;The Plain Truth.&quot;

Armstrong&#x27;s first wife, Loma Dillon Armstrong, died on April 15, 1967, after almost 50 years of marriage.

=== 1970s: Scandal and conflict ===
By the early 1970s, the church began to splinter. Members were disappointed that the events predicted by Herbert Armstrong had not occurred. Because church literature such as &quot;The Wonderful World Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;1975 in Prophecy!&quot;, and many others had attempted to pinpoint the date of Christ&#x27;s return, members continued to wait anxiously for the Second Coming. Some of Armstrong&#x27;s evangelists, such as Gerald Waterhouse, had presented detailed, step-by-step accounts of the Second Coming in their sermons, which included Armstrong himself as one of two witnesses of the Book of Revelation.

In an article in the May 15, 1972, edition of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Herbert Armstrong was reported to have ousted Garner Ted from his leadership roles in the church, on the grounds that Garner Ted was &quot;in the bonds of Satan.&quot; When questioned about the specifics of his accusation, the elder Armstrong responded, &quot;Look up I Timothy, Chapter 3, first five or six verses and Titus, Chapter 1, verse 6.&quot;. The article surmised:Both passages make two points in common: that a bishop or church elder must be faithful to his wife and rule strictly over believing children. Had handsome Garner Ted succumbed to an old and common temptation? His father was cryptic: &quot;The fault was spiritual, not moral.&quot; In 1972, the elder Armstrong declared Garner Ted repentant and named him the divinely ordained successor in the church after the latter signed a letter stating &quot;I have sinned against my wife, the children and the church&quot;, though neither specified what Garner Ted&#x27;s transgression had been. While some congregants speculated adultery, others guessed that father and son had disagreed on the format of their radio and television programs, or on some tenets of the church, such as the Elder Armstrong&#x27;s vocal support for racial segregation.

By March 1974, multiple ministers had quit or been ousted as dissidents, with several citing the church&#x27;s unfairly lax response to Garner Ted&#x27;s violations, denouncing elements of Armstrong&#x27;s doctrine, and founding offshoot churches. Thirty-five ministers formed the Associated Church of God in Washington, D.C. Texas Minister Barry Chase sent an open letter to church members signaling his departure, citing &quot;monumental immorality in the highest echelons of this church.&quot; 

Alfred Carozzo, former WCG director of ministers in the western US, sent an open letter to WCG members denouncing the church&#x27;s tithe system, the Armstrongs&#x27; lavish lifestyle and expenditures, Armstrong&#x27;s positions on divorce and remarriage, and alleging that Armstrong had treated Garner Ted leniently compared to church members accused of similar trespasses. Carozzo incorporated his own offshoot, the 20th Century Church of God. More departures followed, some retaining the &quot;Church of God&quot; component in their names based on Armstrong&#x27;s assertion that this is the name God calls the Church in the Bible. 

In 1977, Herbert Armstrong married Ramona Martin, a woman nearly fifty years his junior, and moved to Tucson, Arizona while recovering from a heart attack. During this time, Armstrong administered and guided church affairs through Stanley Rader, the church&#x27;s general counsel, and the church administration. The church continued to be headquartered in Pasadena.
That year, six former students of Ambassador College published a pamphlet alleging that the church misused funds and violated church members&#x27; civil rights. The pamphlet asserted that the church&#x27;s tithing system reduced members to poverty, costing up to 40% of their income, to support the Armstrongs&#x27; lavish lifestyle, including multiple homes, expensive cars, and a Gulfstream jet.

By 1978, Armstrong had disfellowshipped Garner Ted and ousted him from the church permanently. Garner Ted began his own church in 1978 in Tyler, Texas, called the Church of God International. Herbert and Garner Ted Armstrong remained estranged for the remainder of the elder Armstrong&#x27;s life. 

=== Ambassador International Cultural Foundation ===
During the 1960s, &quot;Armstrong had sought to put into stronger action what he later termed God&#x27;s &quot;way of give&quot;&quot;, which was said to include &quot;the way of character, generosity, cultural enrichment, true education: of beautifying the environment and caring for fellow man.&quot; He began undertaking humanitarian projects in underprivileged locales around the world, which led to the creation of the church-run Ambassador International Cultural Foundation (AICF) in 1975. The Foundation worked in several countries, providing staffing and funds to fight illiteracy, create schools for disabled people, set up mobile schools, and conduct several archaeological digs at significant biblical sites. The church auditorium hosted, at highly subsidized ticket prices, hundreds of performances by noted artists such as Luciano Pavarotti, Vladimir Horowitz, Bing Crosby, Marcel Marceau, and Bob Hope. 

&quot;Quest&quot; periodical was published monthly by AICF from July 1977 to September 1981. Originally named &quot;Human Potential&quot;, the project was directed by Stanley Rader as a secular outreach of the church-funded AICF. &quot;Quest&quot; publishers hired a professional staff unrelated to the church to create a high-quality publication devoted to the humanities, travel, and the arts. The periodical was created in the aftermath of Armstrong&#x27;s poorly received &quot;1975 in Prophecy!&quot;, a publication which caused accusations of false prophecy to spread like wildfire. (The use of the year 1975 was defended by church ministers as a device to explain biblical prophecy, by contrasting it with the scientific world&#x27;s declaration of 1975 as the year of technological &quot;Utopia&quot;). The AICF become secular in its approach and thinking and the church began to cut back on its funding. Eventually it was discontinued by Armstrong and its assets were sold to other interests.

=== Receivership crisis ===
Several members in good standing with the WCG prompted the State of California to investigate charges of malfeasance by Rader and Herbert W. Armstrong. A coalition of six ex-ministers brought accusations of misappropriation of funds against Herbert W. Armstrong and Stanley Rader to the Attorney General of California, contending that the two men were siphoning millions of dollars for their personal indulgences. In 1979, California Attorney General George Deukmejian placed the church campus in Pasadena into financial receivership for a half year. 

The matter gained the attention of Mike Wallace who investigated the church in a report for &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. Wallace alleged that there had been lavish secret expenditures, conflict of interest, insider deals, posh homes and lifestyles in the higher ranks, and the heavy involvement of Stanley Rader in financial manipulation. No legal charges were leveled against Herbert W. Armstrong, Stanley Rader, or the WCG. Wallace invited Rader to appear on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; on April 15, 1979. Wallace showed Rader a secret tape recording in which Herbert Armstrong clearly stated to C. Wayne Cole, who was made temporary acting head of the church by Herbert Armstrong, that Rader was attempting to take over the church after Armstrong&#x27;s death, reasoning that the donated tithe money was the incentive and quite a &quot;magnet&quot; to Stan Rader. Rader abruptly ended the interview. This tape was made during a conversation about Stanley Rader by Herbert W. Armstrong, and C. Wayne Cole. Wayne Cole gave the tape to &quot;60 Minutes&quot; for use in its exposé of Rader. In the meantime, Herbert Armstrong switched the WCG Inc. corporations to &quot;corporate sole&quot; status, making him the sole officer and responsible party for the affairs of the corporations. All income, tithes and checks were then made payable to the personal name of Herbert W. Armstrong and sent to his home in Tucson, Arizona. In referring to the investigation of the California Attorney General, Rader wrote &quot;Against the Gates of Hell: The Threat to Religious Freedom in America&quot; in 1980, in which he contended that his fight with the Attorney General was solely about the government&#x27;s circumventing religious freedoms rather than about abuse of public trust or fraudulent misappropriation of tithe funds.

The California Second Court of Appeals overturned the decision on procedural grounds and added as dicta, &quot;We are of the opinion that the underlying action [i.e., the state-imposed receivership] and its attendant provisional remedy of receivership were from the inception constitutionally infirm and predestined to failure.&quot;

Stanley Rader left his positions within the church in 1981. While remaining a member, he left the public spotlight as an attorney, retired, but continued to receive payments from the WCG on his lifetime contract, $300,000 per year, until his death from acute pancreatic cancer on July 2, 2002.

=== Analysis of Armstrongism ===
Walter Martin, in his book &quot;The Kingdom of the Cults&quot; (1965), devoted 34 pages to the group, claiming that Armstrong borrowed freely from Seventh-day Adventist, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and Mormon doctrines. Armstrong said that all Church doctrine could be proven simply and effectively through the Bible.

== After Armstrong (1986–2009) ==

===Armstrong&#x27;s death and doctrinal changes===
On January 16, 1986, Herbert Armstrong died in Pasadena, California. Shortly before his death, on January 7, Armstrong appointed Joseph W. Tkach Sr. to succeed him &quot;... as pastor general, in the difficult times ahead&quot;. Joseph W. Tkach took on leadership of the denomination. Tkach and other ministers came to the conclusion that a great many of their doctrines were not biblical.

===Changes under new leadership===

As early as 1988, Joseph W. Tkach Sr. began to make doctrinal changes, at first quietly and slowly, but then openly and radically. The changes were presented as new understandings of Christmas and Easter, Babylon and the harlot, British Israelism, Saturday Sabbath, and other doctrines.

Tkach Sr. directed the church theology towards mainstream evangelical Christian belief, against the wishes of some of the membership. This caused much disillusionment among the membership and another rise of splinter groups. While the church admitted that its changes had brought about &quot;catastrophic results,&quot; they stood by their belief that the changes were for the best. During the tenure of Joseph Tkach Sr., the church&#x27;s membership declined by 80%. 

All of Herbert Armstrong&#x27;s writings were withdrawn from print by the WCG, though they are still made available by other denominations. In the 2004 video production &quot;Called To Be Free&quot;, former dean of WCG&#x27;s Ambassador College Greg Albrecht, declared Herbert Armstrong to be both a false prophet and a heretic.

In 1995, Tkach Sr died of cancer and his son, Joseph Tkach Jr., became the leader of the WCG. Tkach Jr. affirmed his father&#x27;s reforms within the church, and continued to make changes. As a result, many members and ministers left and formed other churches that conformed to many of the teachings of Armstrong. 

In 2009, the WCG changed its name to Grace Communion International. In October 2018, Joe Tkach Jr. retired and installed Greg Williams as the President of GCI.

==Contemporary beliefs and practices==

===Teachings===
Much of GCI&#x27;s current doctrine follows mainstream Protestant beliefs that faith in Jesus is the only way to receive salvation and that the Bible is the divinely inspired and the infallible word of God.

===Women&#x27;s ordination===
In 2007, the WCG decided to allow women to serve as pastors and elders. This decision was reached after several years of study. In Pikeville, Kentucky that same year, Debby Bailey became the first female elder in the WCG.

=== Name change to Grace Communion International ===
According to the organization&#x27;s press release regarding their name change, the name Grace Communion International was chosen to &quot;precisely describe&quot; the denomination as &quot;an international community, bound together by God&#x27;s grace.”

The name change was revealed in 2009 during a conference of over a thousand ministers and their spouses that had gathered from around the world. The theme of the conference was “Renewed in Christ” and reflected the importance of the changes that had occurred within the church. The new name for the church was seen to truly reflect the nature of the church as it had been transformed in past years. GCI felt that these changes had come about by pastors being led by the Holy Spirit with a close examination of scripture.

=== Grace Communion Seminary ===
Grace Communion Seminary (GCS) originated from Ambassador College. Classes are delivered in an online format. Accredited graduate programs include courses on the Bible, theology, church history, and ministry.

== Structure ==

===International===
Grace Communion International has a hierarchical polity. Its ecclesiastical policies are determined by the Advisory Council of Elders. Members of the Advisory Council are appointed by the President. The President, who also holds the title of Pastor General, is chief executive and ecclesiastical officer of the denomination. A Doctrinal Advisory Team may report to the Advisory Council on the church&#x27;s official doctrinal statements, epistemology, or apologetics. The President may pocket veto doctrinal positions he determines to be heretical. However, the President is also a member of the Doctrinal Advisory Team, and so he is aware of and involved in the activities of that committee. Historically, Presidents, as chairmen of the board of directors, have appointed their own successor. This and the President&#x27;s power to appoint and remove members of the Advisory Council have remained areas of concern even among those who applaud the church&#x27;s doctrinal changes.

The Church maintains national offices and satellite offices in multiple countries. Membership and tithe income originate primarily from the eastern United States.

===Regional and local===
In the United States, denominational contact with local assemblies or local church home small group meetings, i.e., cell churches, is facilitated by district superintendents, each of which is responsible for a large number of churches in a geographical region (such as Florida or the Northeast) or in a specialized language group (such as Spanish-speaking congregations).

Local churches are led by a senior pastor, pastoral leadership team (with one person designated as a congregational pastoral leader), each of which is supervised by a district pastoral leader. Some senior pastors are responsible for a single local church, but many are responsible for working in two or more churches. Salary compensation for the paid local church pastor, if available, is determined by the local church.

==Finances==
The early WCG used a three-tithe system, under which members were expected to give a tithe or 10% &quot;of their increase&quot;, usually interpreted as a family&#x27;s income.
*The first tithe, 10% of a member&#x27;s total income, was sent to church headquarters to finance &quot;the work&quot;, which was all operations of the church, as well as broadcasting and publishing the church&#x27;s message.
*The second tithe was saved by the individual member to fund the member&#x27;s (and his family&#x27;s) observance of the annual biblical feasts and holy days, especially the contiguous 8-day-long Feast of Tabernacles (seven days) and Eighth Day of Assembly (one day). Unlike the first tithe, these funds were not sent into the church but retained by the member.
*A third tithe was required in the third and sixth years of a personal seven-year tithing cycle, and it was also sent to headquarters. The third tithe was used to support the indigent, widows, and orphans – distribution was decided privately at the discretion of the ministry.

In contrast to many other churches&#x27; religious services, the practice of the WCG was not to pass around offering plates during weekly church services but only during holy day church services (seven days each year). These funds were considered &quot;freewill offerings&quot; and regarded as entirely separate from regular tithes. The church also gathered funds in the form of donations from &quot;co-workers,&quot; those who read the church&#x27;s free literature or watched the weekly TV show but did not actually attend services.

Under Joseph W. Tkach Sr., the mandatory nature of the church&#x27;s three-tithe system was abolished, and it was suggested that tithes could be calculated on net, rather than gross, income. GCI headquarters were subsequently downsized. The denomination sold much of its property, including sites used for festivals, camps built for teenagers, college campuses, and private aircraft. They discontinued publishing all the books, booklets and magazines published by Armstrong.

To further economize, the church sold its properties in Pasadena and purchased an office building in Glendora, California. That building was sold in 2018 and the home office was moved to Charlotte, North Carolina. Formerly, the church&#x27;s membership – meeting in rented halls on Saturdays such as public school buildings, dance halls, hotels and other venues – sent all tithe donations directly to the denomination. Under the new financial reporting system, local churches typically use the majority of funds locally for ministry, including buying or constructing local church buildings for use by the congregations with around 15% going to the denominational office; depending on how the congregation is affiliated with the denomination.

<text>Esteban de Jesús (August 2, 1950 – May 11, 1989) was a Puerto Rican world lightweight champion boxer. De Jesús, a native of the town of Carolina, Puerto Rico, was a gymmate of Wilfred Benítez and was trained by Benitez&#x27;s father, Gregorio Benitez. He was the first boxer to defeat Roberto Durán as a pro, and the only fighter to defeat Duran during his lightweight reign. His career was mired in controversy, problems, and scandals.

== Professional career ==

De Jesús debuted as a professional in 1969, he won his first twenty fights, thirteen by knockout. He then stepped up in class, for the first time, when he boxed future world title challenger Josue Marquez in 1971, beating him in a twelve-round decision to claim the Puerto Rican national Lightweight championship.. His next fight was a fourth-round knockout victory over Victor Ortíz. After that, there was a rematch with Marquez, who was beaten again, also over twelve rounds, to retain the Puerto Rican Lightweight title.

Next came his first international fight, in Caracas, Venezuela, against the future four-time world title challenger Leonel Hernandez. De Jesús won the ten round fight by unanimous decision in what was the start of a four fight tour of Venezuela. That Venezuelan campaign ended with a ten-round decision loss against former world champion Antonio Gomez in Caracas.

1972 was a pivotal year in de Jesús&#x27; career. He won six fights in a row, including a twelve-round knockout win in a third fight with Marquez to again retain the Puerto Rican Lightweight title, and a ten-round decision over Doug McClendon. Despite all the wins, he was virtually unknown to most boxing fans. That changed quickly in his last fight of 1972 against the undefeated new world&#x27;s Lightweight champion Roberto Durán at the Madison Square Garden arena. In a televised bout that marked the beginning of the &quot;Durán - de Jesús trilogy&quot;, de Jesús dropped Durán in round one and went on to inflict Durán&#x27;s first defeat in a ten-round decision.

In 1973, he was rewarded for his efforts, receiving a chance to challenge Ray Lampkin for the North American Boxing Federation lightweight belt. He won the vacant title by beating Lampkin in a twelve-round decision. He went on to beat Johnny Gant and Raul Montoya in ten-round decisions and beat Lampkin by decision in a rematch in New York. He finished 1973 with a first-round knockout win over fringe contender Al Foster.

He began 1974 by knocking out former world Jr. Welterweight champion Alfonso &quot;Peppermint&quot; Frazer in ten rounds in San Juan, Puerto Rico, after which he traveled to Panama City to receive his first world title shot and, at the same time, face Durán in the second fight of their trilogy. He once again dropped Durán in round one, but this time Durán rebounded and dominated the bout, retaining the title in an eleventh-round knockout. He recovered from that defeat with two more wins before the end of the year.

In 1975, he went up in weight briefly, and after beating Jesse Lara by a knockout in three, he returned to Panama City to challenge Colombia&#x27;s Antonio Cervantes for the world&#x27;s Jr. Welterweight title, losing in a fifteen-round decision. He beat Rudy Barros by knockout in round five to end that year, and started 1976 by beating Valentin Ramos by knockout in round two.

Next came his third world title try when the WBC&#x27;s world Lightweight champion Ishimatsu Suzuki of Japan traveled to Puerto Rico to defend his title against de Jesús. The third time proved to be the charm for de Jesús, who won the world title by beating Suzuki in a fifteen-round decision. He retained the title against Hector Medina with a knockout in round seven.

De Jesús admitted publicly to using drugs during his boxing career. He began using cocaine and heroin early in his boxing career with an older brother, Enrique.

In 1977, he retained the title against Buzzsaw Yamabe by knockout in round six and against Vicente Mijares Saldivar by knockout in round eleven.

1978 began with the third and final chapter of his trilogy with Durán. In a title unification bout in Las Vegas, which displayed Durán at the peak of his power, Durán systematically broke down de Jesús resulting in a twelfth-round knockout.

De Jesús rebounded with three wins before the end of that year, including one over former world title challenger Edwin Viruet.

In 1979, he had two more wins, including one over Jimmy Blevins. After beating José Vallejo by a knockout in round seven in San Juan to start 1980, he traveled to Bloomington, Minnesota, to challenge Saoul Mamby for Mamby&#x27;s WBC world Jr. Welterweight title, in the major supporting event of the Larry Holmes-Scott Le Doux world heavyweight championship bout&#x27;s undercard. In what turned out to be his last fight, he was beaten by a knockout in thirteen rounds.

His record was 57 wins and 5 losses, with 32 wins by knockout.

==Professional boxing record==


==Crime, commuted sentence and death==

On November 27, 1980, in what became a famous case in Puerto Rico, after having injected himself with cocaine, de Jesús was involved in a traffic dispute with 17-year-old Roberto Cintron Gonzalez, which ended in de Jesús fatally shooting Gonzalez in the head. De Jesús was sentenced to life in prison. There, he excelled in another sport, baseball, making the Puerto Rico penal system all star team three times. In 1984, he became a born-again Christian and started to turn his life around, becoming a preacher.

In 1985, he learned that his brother Enrique, with whom he had shared needles, had died of AIDS. De Jesús tested positive for the virus, and symptoms began to appear. After it became public knowledge that de Jesús had acquired HIV and had become a sufferer of AIDS, governor Rafael Hernández Colón commuted his sentence.

After returning to spend his last days with his family, de Jesús was visited by many celebrities, including hall of fame baseball player Orlando Cepeda, Salsa music superstar Cheo Feliciano and his old nemesis Roberto Durán. Durán hugged and kissed de Jesús and told his daughter to do the same. This event was witnessed by José Torres who said he was amazed to see Durán&#x27;s compassionate gesture as he lifted de Jesús out of his bed and hugged him at a time when so little was known and so much feared about AIDS.

Esteban de Jesús died one month after being released, at the age of 38.

<text>Melanie Klein (née Reizes; 30 March 1882 – 22 September 1960) was an Austrian-British author and psychoanalyst known for her work in child analysis. She was the primary figure in the development of object relations theory. Klein’s work primarily focused on the role of ambivalence and moral ambiguity in human development. Klein suggested that pre-verbal existential anxiety in infancy catalyzed the formation of the unconscious, which resulted in the unconscious splitting of the world into good and bad idealizations. In her theory, how the child resolves that split depends on the constitution of the child and the character of nurturing the child experiences. The quality of resolution can inform the presence, absence, and/or type of distresses a person experiences later in life.

==Life==

Melanie Klein was born into a Jewish family and spent most of her early life in Vienna. She was the fourth and final child of parents Moriz, a doctor, and Libussa Reizes. Educated at the Gymnasium, Klein wanted to go on to university to study medicine. However, her family&#x27;s loss of wealth – and the pressure on her, as a young woman, to marry and have children – caused her to give up on realizing this wish.

At the age of 21, she married an industrial chemist, Arthur Klein, and soon after gave birth to their first child, Melitta. Klein then had her second child, Hans, in 1907 and her third and final child, Erich, in 1914. After having those two additional children, Klein suffered from clinical depression as these pregnancies took a toll on her. This and her unhappy marriage soon led Klein to seek treatment. Shortly after her family moved to Budapest in 1910, Klein began a course of therapy with psychoanalyst Sándor Ferenczi. It was during their time together that Klein developed an interest in the study of psychoanalysis.

Encouraged by Ferenczi, Klein began her studies by observing her own children. During this time, there was little documentation on the topic of psychoanalysis in children. So, Klein took advantage of this by developing her &quot;play technique&quot;. According to Klein, play is symbolic of unconscious material that can be interpreted and analyzed in the same way that dreams and free associations are in adults. Later, her research contributed to the development of play therapy.

During 1921, with her marriage failing, Klein moved to Berlin where she joined the Berlin Psycho-Analytic Society under the tutelage of Karl Abraham. Although Abraham supported her pioneering work with children, neither Klein nor her ideas received much support in Berlin. As a divorced woman whose academic qualifications did not even include a bachelor&#x27;s degree, Klein was a visible iconoclast within a profession dominated by male physicians. Nevertheless, Klein&#x27;s early work had a strong influence on the developing theories and techniques of psychoanalysis, particularly in Great Britain.

Her theories on human development and defense mechanisms were a source of controversy, as they conflicted with Freud&#x27;s theories on development, and caused much discussion in the world of developmental psychology. Around the same time Klein presented her ideas, Anna Freud was doing the very same. The two became unofficial rivals of sorts, amid the protracted debates between the followers of Klein and the followers of Freud. Amid these so-called &#x27;controversial discussions&#x27;, the British Psychoanalytical Society split into three separate training divisions: (1) Kleinian, (2) Freudian, and (3) Independent. These debates finally ceased with an agreement on a dual approach to instruction in the field of child analysis.

==Contributions to psychoanalysis==
Klein was one of the first to use traditional psychoanalysis with young children. She was innovative in both her techniques (such as working with children using toys) and her theories on infant development.

By observing and analyzing the play and interactions of children, Klein built on the work of Freud&#x27;s unconscious mind. Her dive into the unconscious mind of the infant yielded the findings of the early Oedipus complex, as well as the developmental roots of the superego.

Klein&#x27;s theoretical work incorporates Freud&#x27;s belief in the existence of the death drive, reflecting the notion that all living organisms are inherently drawn toward an &quot;inorganic&quot; state, and therefore, somehow, towards death. In psychological terms, Eros (properly, the life drive), the postulated sustaining and uniting principle of life, is thereby presumed to have a companion force, Thanatos (death drive), which seeks to terminate and disintegrate life (although Freud never used the term &#x27;Thanatos&#x27; in his own writing). Both Freud and Klein regarded these &quot;bio-mental&quot; forces as the foundations of the psyche. These primary unconscious forces, whose mental matrix is the id, spark the ego—the experiencing self—into activity. Id, ego, and superego, to be sure, were merely shorthand terms (similar to the instincts) referring to highly complex and mostly uncharted psychodynamic operations.

== Infant observations ==
Klein&#x27;s work on the importance of observing infants began in 1935 with a public lecture in London on weaning.

Klein states that mother–infant relationships are built on more than feeding and developing the infant&#x27;s attachment; the mother&#x27;s attachment and bond with her baby is just as important, if not more. Klein came to this conclusion by using actual observations of herself and mothers that she knew. She described how infants show interest in their mothers&#x27; face, the touch of their mothers&#x27; hands, and the infants&#x27; pleasure in touching their mothers&#x27; breast. The relationship is built on affection that emerges very soon after birth. Klein says that as early as two months, infants show interest in the mother that goes beyond feeding. She observed that the infant will often smile up at the mother and cuddle against her chest. The way the infant reacts and responds to their mother&#x27;s attitude and feelings, the love and interest which the infant shows, accounts for an object relation.

Klein also goes on to say that infants recognize that their achievements, such as crawling and walking, give their parents joy. In one observation, Klein says that the infant wishes to evoke love and pleasure in their mother with their achievements. Klein says that the infant notices that their smile makes their mother happy and results in the mothers attention. The infant also recognizes that their smile may serve a better purpose than their cry.

Klein also talks about the &quot;apathetic&quot; baby. She says that it is easy to mistake a baby that enjoys their food and cries a little for a happy baby. Development later shows that some of these easy-going babies are not happy. Their lack of crying may be due to some kind of apathy. It is hard to assess a young person&#x27;s state of mind without allowing for a great complexity of emotions. When these babies are followed up on we see that a great deal of difficulty appears. These children are often shy of people, and their interest in the external world, play, and learning is inhibited. They are often slow at learning to crawl and walk because there seems to be little incentive. They are often showing signs of neurosis as their development goes on.

== Child analysis ==
While Freud&#x27;s ideas concerning children mostly came from working with adult patients, Klein was innovative in working directly with children, often as young as two years old. Klein saw children&#x27;s play as their primary mode of emotional communication. While observing children as they played with toys such as dolls, animals, plasticine or pencils and paper, Klein documented their activities and interactions. She then attempted to interpret the unconscious meaning behind their play. Following Freud, she emphasized the significant role that parental figures played in the child&#x27;s fantasy life and concluded that the timing of Freud&#x27;s Oedipus complex was incorrect. Contradicting Freud, she proposed that the superego was present from birth.

After exploring ultra-aggressive fantasies of hate, envy, and greed in very young and disturbed children, Melanie Klein proposed a model of the human psyche that linked significant oscillations of state, with the postulated Eros or Thanatos pulsations. She named the state of the mind in which the sustaining principle of life dominates the depressive position. A depressive position is the understanding that good and evil things are one. The fears and worries about the fate of the people destroyed in the child&#x27;s fantasy are all in the latter. The child tries to repair his mother through phantasm and behavior therapy, overcoming his depression and anxiety. He employs phantasies representing love and restoration to restore the others he destroyed. Morality is based on the standpoint of depression. Klein named it the depressive position because the efforts to restore the integrity of the damaged object are accompanied by depression and despair. After all, the child doubts whether it can fix everything it hurts. Many consider this to be her most significant contribution to psychoanalytic philosophy. She later developed her ideas about an earlier developmental psychological state corresponding to the disintegrating tendency of life, which she called the paranoid-schizoid position.
Klein coined the term &quot;paranoid-schizoid defense&quot; to emphasize how the child&#x27;s worries manifest as persecution fantasies and how he defends himself against persecution by separating. The paranoid-schizoid position develops at birth is a common psychotic condition.

Klein&#x27;s insistence on regarding aggression as an important force in its own right when analyzing children brought her into conflict with Freud&#x27;s daughter Anna Freud, who was one of the other prominent child psychotherapists in continental Europe but who moved to London in 1938 where Klein had been working for several years. Many controversies arose from this conflict, and these are often referred to as the controversial discussions. Battles were played out between the two sides, each presenting scientific papers, working out their respective positions and where they differed, during war-time Britain. A compromise was eventually reached whereby three distinct training groups were formed within the British Psychoanalytical Society, with Anna Freud&#x27;s influence remaining largely predominant in the US.

According to Klein, events such as wars affect the course of child development. A shift occurs from a paranoid-schizoid position to a depressive position. The paranoid-schizoid position is characterized by splitting the self and other into dichotomous good and evil with little ability to integrate the two or to recognize the relativity of these terms.

== Object relation theory ==

Klein is known to be one of the primary founders of object relations theory. This theory of psychoanalysis is based on the assumption that all individuals have within them an internalized, and primarily unconscious realm of relationships. These relationships refer not only to the world around the individual, but more specifically to other individuals surrounding the subject. Object relation theory focuses primarily on the interaction individuals have with others, how those interactions are internalized, and how these now internalized object relations affect one&#x27;s psychological framework. The term &quot;object&quot; refers to the potential embodiment of fear, desire, envy or other comparable emotions. The object and the subject are separated, allowing for a more simplistic approach to addressing the deprived areas of need when used in the clinical setting.

Klein&#x27;s approach differed from Anna Freud&#x27;s ego-psychology approach. Klein explored the interpersonal aspect of the structural model. In the mid-1920s, she thought differently about the first mode of defense. Klein thought it was expulsion while Freud speculated it was repression (Stein, 1990). Klein suggested that the infant could relate – from birth – to its mother, who was deemed either &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; and internalized as archaic part-object, thereby developing a phantasy life in the infant. Because of this supposition, Klein&#x27;s beliefs required her to proclaim that an ego exists from birth, enabling the infant to relate to others early in life (Likierman &amp; Urban, 1999).

==Influence on feminism==
In Dorothy Dinnerstein&#x27;s book &quot;The Mermaid and the Minotaur&quot; (1976) (also published in the UK as &quot;The Rocking of the Cradle and the Ruling of the World&quot;), drawing from elements of Sigmund Freud&#x27;s psychoanalysis, particularly as developed by Klein, Dinnerstein argued that sexism and aggression are both inevitable consequences of child-rearing being left exclusively to women. Klein concluded that the infant&#x27;s first and major concern is fear of being annihilated by the anger it feels, for example, when it is frustrated by the mother. As a solution, Dinnerstein proposed that men and women equally share infant and childcare responsibilities. She argues that if men shared childcare equally with women, they would be equally involved in the phantasies associated with infancy&#x27;s paranoid and depressive worries. There would then be no way out of dealing with these anxieties and creating a more realistic attitude toward both men and women This book became a classic of U.S. second-wave feminism and was later translated into seven languages.

Feminists critical of Klein&#x27;s work have drawn attention to an unwarranted assumption of a natural causality connecting sex, gender and desire, stereotypical gender descriptions and in general a prescriptive normative privileging of heterosexual dynamics.

==In popular culture==
* Melanie Klein was the subject of a 1988 play by Nicholas Wright, entitled &quot;Mrs. Klein&quot;. Set in London in 1934, the play involves a conflict between Melanie Klein and her daughter Melitta Schmideberg, after the death of Melanie&#x27;s son Hans Klein. The depiction of Melanie Klein is quite unfavorable: the play suggests that Hans&#x27; death was a suicide and also reveals that Klein had analysed these two children. In the original production at the Cottesloe Theatre in London, Gillian Barge played Melanie Klein, with Zoë Wanamaker and Francesca Annis playing the supporting roles. In the 1995 New York revival of the play, Melanie Klein was played by Uta Hagen, who described Melanie Klein as a role that she was meant to play. The play was broadcast on the British radio station BBC 4 in 2008 and revived at the Almeida Theatre in London in October 2009 with Clare Higgins as Melanie Klein.
* The indie band Volcano Suns dedicated their first record &quot;The Bright Orange Years&quot; to Klein for her work on childhood aggression.
* Scottish author Alexander McCall Smith makes extensive use of Melanie Klein and her theories in his 44 Scotland Street series. One of the characters, Irene, has an obsession with Kleinian theory, and uses it to &quot;guide&quot; her in the upbringing of her son, Bertie.

<text>Ron Stander (October 17, 1944 – March 8, 2022) was an American professional boxer, who fought from 1969 to 1982. The highlight of Stander&#x27;s pro career came on May 25, 1972 when he challenged for the world heavyweight championship in Omaha, Nebraska. Stander lost to champion Joe Frazier by fifth-round technical knockout when the ring doctor stopped the fight after the fourth round. Prior to his unsuccessful match versus Frazier, Stander had scored a fifth-round knockout victory over hard-punching Earnie Shavers in 1970, and a decision win over contender Thad Spencer in 1971. An award-winning documentary titled &quot;The Bluffs Butcher,&quot; after his adopted hometown of Council Bluffs, Iowa, produced by journalism student Andrew Batt, was released in 2004. The documentary tells the story of Iowa&#x27;s arguably best shot at a World Heavyweight Boxing Title and chronicled Stander&#x27;s journey from virtual unknown to boxing&#x27;s largest stage.

==Frazier-Stander Fight==
Stander was largely an unknown commodity when he was given the opportunity to fight for the world heavyweight title in Omaha. The fight prompted Stander&#x27;s then wife Darlene Stander, to famously compare it to putting a Volkswagen to compete at the Indianapolis 500 race, when she said &quot;You don&#x27;t take a Volkswagen into the Indy 500, unless you know of a hell of a shortcut&quot;. It marked the first time a world heavyweight title fight had been held in Nebraska. Stander had a solid 23-1-1 record entering the bout and was clearly the fans&#x27; favorite based on the huge, enthusiastic ovation he received when he was introduced. Frazier was the undefeated champion and entered the ring as a 10-1 betting favorite. He was booed after being introduced. Both men employed the same aggressive fighting style of pushing forward and fighting at close quarters, which made for an exciting contest. Stander was quite competitive in the first round, even buckling Frazier&#x27;s knees with one blow late in the round. However, by the second round, Frazier&#x27;s superiority in class began to show and the champion was getting the better of the frequent exchanges. In the third round Frazier opened a cut on the bridge of Stander&#x27;s nose and severely staggered him late in the round. Stander was not knocked down, however. By the fourth round Stander was bleeding profusely from the cut and again was badly staggered towards the end of the round as Frazier landed numerous telling blows to Stander&#x27;s face. Between rounds four and five the fight was stopped by veteran referee Zack Clayton on the advice of the ring doctor. Officially Frazier was credited with a victory by a fifth-round technical knockout.

==Personal life and death==
Stander died from complications of diabetes on March 8, 2022, at the age of 77.

<text>Bernard Francis Cardinal Law (November 4, 1931 – December 20, 2017) was a senior-ranking prelate of the Catholic Church, known largely for covering up the serial rape of children by Catholic priests. He served as Archbishop of Boston, archpriest of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, and Cardinal Priest of Santa Susanna, which was the American parish in Rome until 2017, when the American community was relocated to San Patrizio.

Law was Archbishop of Boston from 1984 until his resignation on December 13, 2002, after his involvement in the Archdiocese of Boston sex abuse scandal became public knowledge. Law was proven to have ignored or concealed the molestation of many underage children; Church documents demonstrate that he had extensive knowledge of widespread child sexual abuse committed by dozens of Catholic priests in his archdiocese over almost two decades; he failed to report these crimes to the authorities, instead merely transferring the accused priests between parishes. One priest in Law&#x27;s archdiocese, John Geoghan, raped or molested more than 130 children in six different parishes in a career of 30 years. Law was widely denounced for his handling of the sexual abuse cases, and outside the church his public image was destroyed in the aftermath of the scandal.

Two years after Law resigned from his position in Boston, which Bishop William Skylstad called &quot;an important step in the healing process&quot;, Pope John Paul II appointed him Archpriest of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome in 2004. He resigned the position upon reaching age 80 in November 2011, and died in Rome on December 20, 2017 at age 86.

==Early life and education==
Law was born in Torreón, Coahuila, Mexico, on November 4, 1931, the only child of Bernard Aloysius Law (1890–1955) and Helen A. Law (née Stubblefield; 1911–1991). His father was a United States Air Force colonel and a veteran pilot of World War I.

Law grew up on military bases in the United States and Latin America. He attended schools in New York; Florida; Georgia; Barranquilla, Colombia; and graduated from Charlotte Amalie High School in Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. While in high school, he was employed by &quot;The Virgin Islands Daily News&quot;. He graduated from Harvard College with a major in medieval history before studying philosophy at Saint Joseph Seminary College in St. Benedict, Louisiana, from 1953 to 1955, and theology at the Pontifical College Josephinum in Worthington, Ohio, from 1955 to 1961.

==Priestly ministry in the civil rights era==
On May 21, 1961, Law was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Natchez-Jackson in Mississippi. He served two years as an assistant pastor of St. Paul&#x27;s Catholic Church in Vicksburg, Mississippi, where he was the editor of &quot;The Mississippi Register&quot;, the diocesan newspaper. He also held several other diocesan posts from 1963 to 1968, including director of the family life bureau and spiritual director of the minor seminary.

The young Fr. Law was a civil rights activist.

He was a member of the Mississippi Leadership Conference and Mississippi Human Relations Council. For his civil rights activities and his strong positions on civil rights in the &quot;Mississippi Register&quot;, of which he was editor, he received death threats.
Charles Evers, activist and brother of murdered civil rights activist Medgar Evers, praised Law and said he acted &quot;not for the Negro, but for justice and what is right.&quot;

Law&#x27;s brave civil rights activity led him to develop ties with Protestant church leaders and he received national attention for his work for ecumenism, and in 1968 he was tapped for his first national post, as executive director of the US Bishops&#x27; Committee on Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs.

==Bishop of Springfield–Cape Girardeau==

Pope Paul VI named Law bishop of the Diocese of Springfield–Cape Girardeau in Missouri on October 22, 1973, and he was consecrated on December 5 of that year. Law&#x27;s predecessor in Springfield–Cape Girardeau was William Wakefield Baum, another future cardinal.

In 1975, he arranged for the resettlement in his diocese of 166 Vietnamese refugees who arrived in the United States, and were members of a Vietnamese religious congregation, the Congregation of the Mother Co-Redemptrix.

In continuing his ecumenical work, Law formed the Missouri Christian Leadership Conference. He was made a member of the Vatican&#x27;s Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity and served from 1976 to 1981 as a consultor to its Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews. In the late 1970s, Law would also chair the U.S. bishops&#x27; Committee on Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs.

In 1981, Law was named the Vatican delegate to develop and oversee a program instituted by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in which U.S. Episcopal priests would be accepted into the Catholic priesthood. In the program&#x27;s first year, sixty-four Episcopal priests applied for acceptance. This brought married priests with their families into U.S. Roman Catholic dioceses for the first time.

==Archbishop of Boston==
On January 11, 1984, Law was appointed Archbishop of Boston by Pope John Paul II and was installed on March 23, 1984.

That same year, Law reassigned a local priest, Fr John Geoghan, to St. Julia&#x27;s in Weston, on the recommendation of medical professionals. Geoghan had previously been known to abuse children, and at least one auxiliary bishop in Boston warned Law that the priest was unfit to return to parish ministry.

On May 25, 1985, Law was created cardinal, and Santa Susanna was assigned as his titular church.

In 1985, delivering one of the few speeches in Latin at the Synod of Bishops, he called for the creation of a &quot;universal catechism&quot; to guard against dissent, especially by theologians. He was the second prelate to call for such a document, which became the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; (1992). Law oversaw the first draft of its English translation.

In the mid-1980s, Law chaired the bishops&#x27; Committee on Pastoral Research and Practices at the time it distributed a report on Freemasonry. The bishops&#x27; report concluded that &quot;the principles and basic rituals of Masonry embody a naturalistic religion, active participation in which is incompatible with Christian faith and practice&quot;.

In 1989, Geoghan was once again removed from ministry due to continued child sex abuse, but was later allowed to return to St Julia&#x27;s. Further incidents resulted in his permanent removal in 1993, and his defrocking in 1998.

=== Sex abuse scandal exposés ===

In January 2001, Law was named a defendant in several high-profile cases involving pedophile priests, including one involving Geoghan. Reporter Kristen Lombardi, who was assigned to investigate by Susan Ryan-Vollmar, the editor of the &quot;Boston Phoenix&quot; weekly, wrote &quot;Cardinal sin&quot;, an article about the cases.

Mark Keane, a victim of Geoghan, believed that Law had direct knowledge that Geoghan, who worked in the Archdiocese of Boston from 1962 to 1993, was repeatedly molesting children. Keane said that the archbishop not only allowed the priest to continue working, but repeatedly moved him from parish to parish where he had daily contact with many children (one of whom was Keane).

Even though abuse by Geoghan had been reported repeatedly in the media since 1996, the new editor of the daily &quot;Boston Globe&quot; newspaper Martin Baron set the &quot;Spotlight&quot; investigatory team to work on the case in September 2001. Lombardi acknowledged that the &quot;Globe&quot; may have had the story before she did, but was delayed somewhat pending the release of sealed records.

===Resignation===
In April 2002, following the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;″s public exposure of the cover up by Cardinal Law (and his predecessor Cardinal Humberto Medeiros) of offending priests in the Boston Archdiocese, Law consulted with Pope John Paul II and other Vatican officials and said he was committed to staying on as archbishop and addressing the scandal: &quot;It is my intent to address at length the record of the Archdiocese&#x27;s handling of these cases by reviewing the past in as systematic and comprehensive way as possible, so that legitimate questions which have been raised might be answered.&quot;

Even so, Law submitted his resignation as Archbishop of Boston to the Vatican, which Pope John Paul II accepted on December 13, 2002. Law wrote in a personal declaration, &quot;The particular circumstances of this time suggest a quiet departure. Please keep me in your prayers.&quot; and moved to Rome. In July 2003, Seán O&#x27;Malley, OFMCap was named the new Archbishop of Boston.

The &quot;Boston Globe&quot; said in an editorial the day after Law&#x27;s resignation was accepted that &quot;Law had become the central figure in a scandal of criminal abuse, denial, payoff, and coverup that resonates around the world&quot;. A letter urging Law&#x27;s resignation had been signed by 58 priests, mostly diocesan priests who had sworn obedience to Law as their direct superior; the editorial said that this letter was &quot;surely one of the precipitating events in his departure&quot;. The &quot;Globe&quot;″s exposé of the scandal was the subject of an Oscar-winning film, &quot;Spotlight&quot; released in the United States in November 2015, in which Law was portrayed by Len Cariou.

In a statement, Cardinal Law said, &quot;It is my fervent prayer that [my resignation] may help the Archdiocese of Boston to experience the healing, reconciliation and unity which are so desperately needed. To all those who have suffered from my shortcomings and mistakes I both apologize and from them beg forgiveness.&quot; While no longer Archbishop of Boston, Law remained a bishop and cardinal of the Catholic Church in good standing; as a cardinal, he participated in the 2005 papal conclave. By the time of the 2013 papal conclave, he had become ineligible to vote as he was over the age of 80.

==Roman appointment==
Within weeks of his resignation, Law moved from Boston to Rome. When the state attorney general issued his report entitled &quot;Child Sexual Abuse in the Archdiocese of Boston&quot; (July 23, 2003), he severely criticized Law, mentioning that &quot;the Archdiocese has shown an institutional reluctance to adequately address the problem and, in fact, made choices that allowed the abuse to continue,&quot; but did not allege that Law had tried to evade investigation. He said that Cardinal Law had not broken any laws, because the law requiring abuse to be reported was not expanded to include priests until 2002.

Law was a member of the Congregations for the Oriental Churches, the Clergy, Divine Worship and Discipline of the Sacraments, Evangelisation of Peoples, Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, Catholic Education, Bishops as well as the Pontifical Council for the Family. He held membership in all these congregations and of the council before resigning from the governance of the Archdiocese of Boston, and at that time was also a member of the Pontifical Council for Culture. He became even more influential in those Vatican congregations and, being based in Rome, he could attend all their meetings, unlike cardinals based in other countries.

In May 2004, Pope John Paul II appointed Law to a post in Rome, as Archpriest of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, a largely ceremonial role. Some saw this an attempt to shield Law from potential criminal prosecution as his new position conveyed citizenship in Vatican City.

Law reached 80 on November 4, 2011, and lost the right to participate in a papal conclave as well as his memberships in offices of the Roman Curia. He remained as archpriest of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore until November 21, 2011, when Archbishop Santos Abril y Castelló was appointed as the new archpriest.

In Rome, Law was considered an active and important conservative voice within many of the Vatican offices in which he served. Robert Mickens, a longtime Vatican journalist, reported that Law believed he had been &quot;badly done by&quot;, and that other cardinals saw him as a victim rather than a guilty party. Until his retirement, Mickens said, &quot;He did not lose his influence. He was a member of more congregations than any other bishop ... Cardinals that are members of these offices can&#x27;t always go to the meetings—they are not in Rome—but Bernie Law did and he goes everywhere and he keeps his head held high.&quot;

==Retirement and death==
It was &quot;commonly believed that [Law would] live out his retirement in Rome&quot; (when he reached 80 years of age). After his retirement in 2011, Law continued to live in Vatican City, and regularly attended the annual July 4 Independence Day parties held by the United States Embassy to the Holy See.

In March 2013, Law was living at the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. , he was living in the Palazzo della Cancelleria. He visited the United States for the last time in August 2015 for the funeral of Cardinal William Wakefield Baum in Washington, D.C.

In May 2012, the &quot;National Catholic Reporter&quot; and &quot;The Tablet&quot;, a British Catholic weekly, reported that Law was &quot;the person in Rome most forcefully supporting&quot; Baltimore Archbishop William E. Lori&#x27;s petition to investigate and discipline the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, a large group of American nuns.

After a long illness, Law died in Rome on December 20, 2017, at the age of 86. He is buried in a chapel at the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore. His funeral rites, following the standard for a cardinal who dies in Rome, included Mass in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica on December 21 at which Pope Francis said the final prayers. Vatican TV did not livestream the Mass as it normally does.

Upon his death, his successor as Archbishop of Boston, Cardinal Seán O&#x27;Malley, OFMCap, said it was &quot;unfortunate&quot; that Law &quot;had such a high-profile place in the life of the Church&quot;. He speculated that today Law would not receive the sort of Vatican appointments he enjoyed after leaving Boston &quot;but unfortunately we&#x27;re living with the consequences of that&quot;.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; noted at the time that Law had become &quot;a symbol of the Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s systematic protection of paedophile priests&quot; because of his refusal to stop sexual abuse in Boston.

==In popular culture==
Law is portrayed by Len Cariou in the 2015 biographical drama &quot;Spotlight&quot;.

<doc id="157859" wikidata="Q2636185" url="?curid=157859" title="Al Perkins">
<text>Al Perkins (born January 18, 1944) is an American guitarist known primarily for his steel guitar work. The Gibson guitar company called Perkins &quot;the world&#x27;s most influential Dobro player&quot; and began producing an &quot;Al Perkins Signature&quot; Dobro in 2001—designed and autographed by Perkins.

==Early years==
Al Perkins was born and raised in Texas and learned to play Hawaiian steel guitar at the age of 9. In the 1950s Perkins was considered a child prodigy, playing with regional country and western bands, appearing on TV/radio, and winning several talent contests. In the early 1960s, Perkins began playing electric guitar with west Texas rock bands, and was discovered by Mickey Jones and Kenny Rogers of The First Edition. By 1966, he enlisted into the Army National Guard and was discharged from the US Army Reserves in 1970.

==1970s==
In 1970, Perkins joined the east Texas country rock band, Shiloh, and moved to California. The band included Don Henley and future producer/record executive Jim Ed Norman. Perkins was then hired to play in the new incarnation of the Flying Burrito Brothers and recorded the live album &quot;The Last of the Red Hot Burritos&quot; in 1972. Perkins, along with Chris Hillman, formerly of The Byrds, went on to join Stephen Stills&#x27; Manassas, whose material fused Latin, rock, blues, country, folk, and bluegrass influences. He also played steel guitar on the Rolling Stones&#x27; song, &quot;Torn and Frayed&quot; on &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot;

With Stills working with Crosby Stills and Nash, Perkins and Hillman joined Richie Furay (Buffalo Springfield and Poco founding member) and JD Souther in the Souther–Hillman–Furay Band. Perkins moved into record production in the mid-1970s, but did tour again with Michael Nesmith and McGuinn &amp; Hillman. As a session player, Perkins contributed to many notable albums, including the Eagles&#x27; &quot;On the Border&quot;.

He joined the British band Ark in 1977 and recorded the album &quot;The Angels Come&quot;.

==1980s==
Continuing his production work into the 1980s, Perkins also toured with Chris Hillman as a duo before joining Dolly Parton in 1986, touring and recording with her for several years before moving to Nashville.

In Nashville Perkins formed a new project called The Nash Ramblers with Emmylou Harris, with whom he had worked previously on the two solo albums recorded by Gram Parsons. (It was his association with Parsons that led to Perkins being called in to play on the sessions for the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Exile on Main Street&quot;). The &quot;Live at the Ryman album&quot; was to win Perkins his first Grammy award in 1992.

Perkins is listed playing pedal steel guitar on two albums by Christian singer Don Francisco: &quot;Holiness&quot; and &quot;One Heart at a Time&quot;.

==1990s–present==
Al Perkins continues to tour and record. To date, other artists Al Perkins has played for are: James Taylor, Bob Dylan, Tori Amos, Garth Brooks, Dwight Yoakam, Dan Fogelberg, Joe Walsh, Mike Love, Solomon Burke, Patty Loveless, Cher, Rita Coolidge, Iris DeMent, Michael Martin Murphey, Buddy Miller, Tommy Womack, Yo La Tengo, and Jim Lauderdale.

In 2002 Perkins released a collection of studio outtakes and rare recordings. &quot;Snapshots&quot; features recordings by the Nash Ramblers and the Flying Burrito Brothers among others. This was followed in 2003 by &quot;Triple Play&quot;, Perkins&#x27; first solo album, revealing blues, country, bluegrass, gospel and Cajun influences.

Perkins appeared on stage alongside James Burton and Keith Richards at the Gram Parsons tribute show in California in summer 2004.

Throughout the 2000s Perkins toured periodically with the Road Trippers, a band led by Kevin Montgomery and occasionally included Mike McAdam and Mavericks Paul Deakin and Robert Reynolds.

In 2009, Perkins formed &quot;Big Dog 3&quot;, a trio with bassist Chris Donohue and drummer Brady Blade. Big Dog 3&#x27;s self-titled debut album features guests such as Jim Lauderdale and Emmylou Harris. Today Al Perkins performs with The HiPower Band, which includes vocalist Kristine Arnold (Sweethearts of the Rodeo).

<text>Daniela Luján (; born Daniela Barrios Rodríguez, 5 April 1988) is a Mexican pop singer and actress. She got prominence in &quot;Una familia de diez&quot;, playing Gabriela &quot;Gaby&quot; del Valle de López, &quot;Sortilegio&quot;, playing Lisette Albarrán and &quot;De que te quiero, te quiero&quot;, playing Karina Montiel, projects that marked her transition and artistic maturity. In her musical career, some critics call her the Princess of Cumbia.

==Biography==

Born on 5 April 1988, to Miguel Barrios Luján and Amalia Rodríguez Gómez, she is the youngest of three daughters.
She started her artistic career at the age of five when she played María on the show &quot;Plaza Sésamo&quot; (the Mexican version of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;). She shot to fame in 1996 with the telenovela &quot;Luz Clarita&quot;, where Daniela played the main character, seven-year-old &quot;Luz Clarita&quot;. Daniela went on to star in other telenovelas like &quot;El diario de Daniela&quot; and &quot;Primer amor, a mil por hora&quot;. She has released two solo albums, one in 1999 titled &quot;Por un mundo mejor&quot; (&quot;For a better world&quot;) and the other in 2001 titled &quot;Corazón.com&quot; (&quot;Heart.com&quot;).

In 2004, she signed a contract with Menudo creator Edgardo Díaz, who is now in charge of her singing career.

In February 2017, she returned to Univision to become the captain of &quot;Pequeños Gigantes USA&quot;.

In 2024, Luján returned to telenovelas, starring in &quot;Papás por conveniencia&quot;. Later that year, she competed as &quot;Huesito Peligroso&quot; during the sixth season of &quot;¿Quién es la máscara?&quot;, reaching the finale and finishing in third place.

<doc id="157861" wikidata="Q624036" url="?curid=157861" title="Filibuster">
<text>A filibuster is a political procedure in which one or more members of a legislative body prolong debate on proposed legislation so as to delay or entirely prevent a decision. It is sometimes referred to as &quot;talking a bill to death&quot; or &quot;talking out a bill&quot;, and is characterized as a form of obstruction in a legislature or other decision-making body.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;filibuster&quot; ultimately derives from the Dutch (&quot;freebooter&quot;, a pillaging and plundering adventurer), but the precise history of the word&#x27;s borrowing into English is obscure. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; finds its only known use in early modern English in a 1587 book describing &quot;flibutors&quot; who robbed supply convoys. In the late 18th century, the term was re-borrowed into English from its French form , a form that was used until the mid-19th century.

The modern English form &quot;filibuster&quot; was borrowed in the early 1850s from the Spanish (lawless plunderer). The term was applied to private military adventurers like William Walker who were then attacking and pillaging Spanish colonies in Central America. Spain lost all its Central American territory in 1821. Over the course of the mid to late 19th century, the term &quot;filibustering&quot; became common in American English in the sense of &quot;obstructing progress in a legislative assembly&quot;.

==Ancient Rome==
One of the first known practitioners of the filibuster was the Roman senator Cato the Younger. In debates over legislation he especially opposed, Cato would often obstruct the measure by speaking continuously until nightfall. As the Roman Senate had a rule requiring all business to conclude by dusk, Cato&#x27;s purposely long-winded speeches were an effective device to forestall a vote.

Cato attempted to use the filibuster at least twice to frustrate the political objectives of Julius Caesar. The first incident occurred during the summer of 60 BC, when Caesar was returning home from his propraetorship in Hispania Ulterior. Caesar, by virtue of his military victories over the raiders and bandits in Hispania, had been awarded a triumph by the Senate. Having recently turned forty, Caesar had also become eligible to stand for consul. This posed a dilemma. Roman generals honored with a triumph were not allowed to enter the city prior to the ceremony, but candidates for the consulship were required, by law, to appear in person at the Forum. The date of the election, which had already been set, made it impossible for Caesar to stand unless he crossed the &quot;pomerium&quot; and gave up the right to his triumph. Caesar petitioned the Senate to stand &quot;,&quot; but Cato employed a filibuster to block the proposal. Faced with a choice between a triumph and the consulship, Caesar chose the consulship and entered the city.

Cato made use of the filibuster again in 59 BC in response to a land reform bill sponsored by Caesar, who was then consul. When it was Cato&#x27;s time to speak during the debate, he began one of his characteristically long-winded speeches. Caesar, who needed to pass the bill before his co-consul, Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, took possession of the &quot;fasces&quot; at the end of the month, immediately recognized Cato&#x27;s intent and ordered the lictors to jail him for the rest of the day. The move was unpopular with many senators and Caesar, realizing his mistake, soon ordered Cato&#x27;s release. The day was wasted without the Senate ever getting to vote on a motion supporting the bill, but Caesar eventually circumvented Cato&#x27;s opposition by taking the measure to the Tribal Assembly, where it passed.

==Westminster-style parliaments==

===Australia===
Both houses of the Australian parliament have strictly enforced rules on how long members may speak, so filibusters are generally not possible, though this is not the case in some state legislatures.

In opposition, Tony Abbott&#x27;s Liberal National coalition used suspension of standing orders in 2012 for the purposes of filibustering, most commonly during question time against the Labor government.

In 2022, Liberal Senator Michaelia Cash engaged in a nine-hour filibuster in committee of the whole (in which senators can usually question ministers as often as they liked) in an effort to stall the passage of industrial relations laws.

===Canada===

====Federal====
A dramatic example of filibustering in the House of Commons of Canada took place between Thursday June 23, 2011 and Saturday June 25, 2011. In an attempt to prevent the passing of Bill C-6, which would have legislated the imposing of a four-year contract and pay conditions on the locked out Canada Post workers, the New Democratic Party (NDP) led a filibustering session which lasted for fifty-eight hours. The NDP argued that the legislation in its then form undermined collective bargaining. Specifically, the NDP opposed the salary provisions and the form of binding arbitration outlined in the bill.

The House was supposed to break for the summer on June 23 but remained open in an extended session due to the filibuster. The 103 NDP MPs had been taking it in turn to deliver 20-minute speeches, plus 10 minutes of questions and comments, to delay the passing of the bill. MPs are allowed to give such speeches each time a vote takes place, and many votes were needed before the bill could be passed. As the Conservative Party of Canada held a majority in the House, the bill passed. This was the longest filibuster since the 1999 Reform Party of Canada filibuster, on native treaty issues in British Columbia.

Former Conservative Member of Parliament Tom Lukiwski was known for his ability to stall Parliamentary Committee business by filibustering. One such example occurred on October 26, 2006, when he spoke for almost 120 minutes to prevent the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development from studying a private member&#x27;s bill to implement the Kyoto Accord. He also spoke for about 6 hours on February 5, 2008, and February 7, 2008, at the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs meetings to block inquiry into allegations that the Conservative Party spent more than the maximum allowable campaign limits during the 2006 Canadian federal election.

Another example of filibuster in Canada federally came in early 2014 when NDP MP and Deputy Leader David Christopherson filibustered the government&#x27;s bill C-23, the Fair Elections Act at the Procedure and House Affairs Committee. His filibuster lasted several meetings, in the last of which he spoke for over 8 hours. It was done to support his own motion to hold cross-country hearings on the bill so that MPs could hear what the Canadian public thought of the bill. In the end, given that the Conservative government had a majority at committee, his motion was defeated and the bill passed — though with some significant amendments.

In the spring of 2017 Conservative and NDP Opposition MPs united to filibuster a motion from Government House Leader Bardish Chagger, arguing it was an attempt by the Liberal government to limit the ability of opposition parties to hold the government to account. David Christopherson was again one of the leaders in this filibuster along with Conservative Scott Reid. Several other opposition MPs made significant contributions to the filibuster, including Conservatives Blake Richards, John Nater, and Jamie Schmale. The filibuster lasted from March 21 until May 2, when the governing Liberals agreed to drop the most controversial elements of their proposal.

====Provincial====

=====Newfoundland and Labrador=====

An ironic example of filibustering occurred when the Liberal Party of Newfoundland and Labrador reportedly had &quot;nothing else to do in the House of Assembly&quot; and debated between only themselves about their own budget after both the Conservative and NDP party indicated either their support for the bill or intent to vote.

=====Ontario=====
The Legislature of the Province of Ontario has witnessed several significant filibusters, although two are notable for the unusual manner by which they were undertaken. The first was an effort on May 6, 1991, by Mike Harris — later premier but then leader of the opposition Progressive Conservatives — to derail the implementation of the budget tabled by the NDP government under premier Bob Rae. The tactic involved the introduction of Bill 95 (&quot;a.k.a.&quot; Zebra Mussel Act), the title of which contained the names of every lake, river and stream in the province. Between the reading of the title by the proposing MPP, and the subsequent obligatory reading of the title by the clerk of the chamber, this filibuster occupied the entirety of the day&#x27;s session until adjournment. To prevent this particular tactic from being used again, changes were eventually made to the Standing Orders to limit the time allocated each day to the introduction of bills to 30 minutes.

A second high-profile and uniquely implemented filibuster in the Ontario Legislature occurred in April 1997, where the Ontario New Democratic Party, then in opposition, tried to prevent the governing Progressive Conservatives&#x27; Bill 103 from taking effect. To protest the Tory government&#x27;s legislation that would amalgamate the municipalities of Metro Toronto into the &quot;megacity&quot; of Toronto, the small NDP caucus introduced 11,500 amendments to the megacity bill, created on computers with mail merge functionality. Each amendment would name a street in the proposed city, and provide that public hearings be held in the megacity with residents of the street invited to participate. The Ontario Liberal Party also joined the filibuster with a smaller series of amendments; a typical Liberal amendment would give a historical designation to a named street. The NDP then added another series of over 700 amendments, each proposing a different date for the bill to come into force.

The filibuster began on April 2 with the Abbeywood Trail amendment and occupied the legislature day and night, the members alternating in shifts. On April 4, exhausted and often sleepy government members inadvertently let one of the NDP amendments pass, and the handful of residents of Cafon Court in Etobicoke were granted the right to a public consultation on the bill, although the government subsequently nullified this with an amendment of its own. On April 6, with the alphabetical list of streets barely into the Es, Speaker Chris Stockwell ruled that there was no need for the 220 words identical in each amendment to be read aloud each time, only the street name. With a vote still needed on each amendment, Zorra Street was not reached until April 8. The Liberal amendments were then voted down one by one, eventually using a similar abbreviated process, and the filibuster finally ended on April 11.

===India===
The Rajya Sabha (Council of states) — which is the upper house in the Indian bicameral legislature — allows for a debate to be brought to a close with a simple majority decision of the house, on a closure motion so introduced by any member. On the other hand, the Lok Sabha (Council of the people) — the lower house — leaves the closure of the debate to the discretion of the speaker once a motion to end the debate is moved by a member.

===Ireland===
In 2014, Irish Justice Minister Alan Shatter performed a filibuster; he was perceived to &quot;drone on and on&quot; and hence this was termed a &quot;Drone Attack&quot;.

===New Zealand===
In August 2000, New Zealand opposition parties National and ACT delayed the voting for the Employment Relations Bill by voting slowly, and in some cases in Māori (which required translation into English).

In 2009, several parties staged a filibuster of the Local Government (Auckland Reorganisation) Bill in opposition to the government setting up a new Auckland Council — under urgency and without debate or review by the select committee — by proposing thousands of wrecking amendments and voting in Māori as each amendment had to be voted on and votes in Māori translated into English. Amendments included renaming the council to &quot;Auckland Katchafire Council&quot; or &quot;Rodney Hide Memorial Council&quot; and replacing the phrase &quot;powers of a regional council&quot; with &quot;power and muscle&quot;.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the Parliament of the United Kingdom, a bill defeated by a filibustering manoeuver may be said to have been &#x27;talked out&#x27;. The procedures of the House of Commons require that members cover only points germane to the topic under consideration or the debate underway whilst speaking. Example filibusters in the Commons and Lords include:
* In 1874, Joseph Gillis Biggar started making long speeches in the House of Commons to delay the passage of Irish coercion acts. Charles Stewart Parnell, a young Irish nationalist Member of Parliament (MP), who in 1880 became leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, joined him in this tactic to obstruct the business of the House and force the Liberals and Conservatives to negotiate with him and his party. The tactic was enormously successful, and Parnell and his MPs succeeded, for a time, in forcing Parliament to take the Irish Question of return to self-government seriously.
* In 1983, Labour MP John Golding talked for over 11 hours during an all-night sitting at the committee stage of the British Telecommunications Bill. However, as this was at a standing committee and not in the Commons chamber, he was also able to take breaks to eat.
* On July 3, 1998, Labour MP Michael Foster&#x27;s Wild Mammals (Hunting with Dogs) Bill was blocked in Parliament by opposition filibustering.
* In January 2000, filibustering directed by Conservative MPs to oppose the Disqualifications Bill led to the cancellation of the day&#x27;s parliamentary business on Prime Minister Tony Blair&#x27;s 1,000th day in office. However, since this business included Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions, William Hague, the Conservative leader at that time, was deprived of the opportunity of a high-profile confrontation with the Prime Minister.
* On Friday, April 20, 2007, a private member&#x27;s bill aimed at exempting Members of Parliament from the Freedom of Information Act was &#x27;talked out&#x27; by a collection of MPs, led by Liberal Democrats Simon Hughes and Norman Baker who debated for five hours, therefore running out of time for the parliamentary day and &#x27;sending the bill to the bottom of the stack.&#x27; However, since there were no other private member&#x27;s bills to debate, it was resurrected the following Monday.
* In January 2011, Labour peers, including most notably John Prescott, were attempting to delay the passage of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill 2010 until after February 16, the deadline given by the Electoral Commission to allow the referendum on the Alternative Vote to take place on May 5. On the eighth day of debate, staff in the House of Lords set up camp beds and refreshments to allow peers to rest, for the first time in eight years.
* In January 2012, Conservative and Scottish National Party MPs used filibustering to successfully block the Daylight Savings Bill 2010–12, a private member&#x27;s bill that would put the UK on Central European Time. The filibustering included an attempt by Jacob Rees-Mogg to amend the bill to give the county of Somerset its own time zone, 15 minutes behind London.
* In November 2014, Conservative MPs Philip Davies and Christopher Chope successfully filibustered a private member&#x27;s bill that would have prohibited retaliatory evictions. Davies&#x27;s speech was curtailed by Deputy Speaker Dawn Primarolo for disregarding her authority after she ordered Davies to wrap up his then hour-long speech. A closure motion moved by the government, which was agreed to 60–0, failed due to being inquorate.
* In October 2016 Conservative Minister Sam Gyimah filibustered a bill sponsored by John Nicolson of the Scottish National Party that would pardon historic convictions for homosexual acts (which were no longer an offence), replacing an existing law that requires each pardon to be applied for separately.

The all-time Commons record for non-stop speaking, six hours, was set by Henry Brougham in 1828, though this was not a filibuster. The 21st century record was set on December 2, 2005, by Andrew Dismore, Labour MP for Hendon. Dismore spoke for three hours and 17 minutes to block a Conservative private member&#x27;s bill, the Criminal Law (Amendment) (Protection of Property) Bill, which he claimed amounted to &quot;vigilante law&quot;. Although Dismore is credited with speaking for 197 minutes, he regularly accepted interventions from other MPs who wished to comment on points made in his speech. Taking multiple interventions artificially inflates the duration of a speech and thus may be used as a tactic to prolong a speech.

In local unitary authorities of England a motion may be carried into closure by filibustering. This results in any additional motions receiving less time for debate by councillors instead of forcing a vote by the council under closure rules.

====Northern Ireland====
A notable filibuster took place in the Northern Ireland House of Commons in 1936 when Tommy Henderson (Independent Unionist MP for Shankill) spoke for nine and a half hours (ending just before 4 a.m.) on the Appropriation Bill. As this bill applied government spending to all departments, almost any topic was relevant to the debate, and Henderson used the opportunity to list all of his many criticisms of the Unionist government.

==Other==
On October 28, 1897, Otto Lecher, delegate for Brünn, spoke continuously for twelve hours before the &quot;Abgeordnetenhaus&quot; (&quot;House of Delegates&quot;) of the &quot;Reichsrat&quot; (&quot;Imperial Council&quot;) of Austria, to block action on the &quot;Ausgleich&quot; with Hungary, which was due for renewal. Mark Twain was present, and described the speech and the political context in his essay &quot;Stirring Times in Austria&quot;.

In the Southern Rhodesia Legislative Assembly, Independent member Ahrn Palley staged a similar filibuster against the Law and Order Maintenance Bill on November 22, 1960, although this took the form of moving a long series of amendments to the Bill, and therefore consisted of multiple individual speeches interspersed with comments from other Members. Palley kept the Assembly sitting from 8 PM to 12:30 PM the following day.

In the Senate of the Philippines, Roseller Lim of the Nacionalista Party held out the longest filibuster in Philippine Senate history. On the election for the President of the Senate of the Philippines in April 1963, he stood on the podium for more than 18 hours to wait for party-mate Alejandro Almendras who was to arrive from the United States. The Nacionalistas, who comprised exactly half of the Senate, wanted to prevent the election of Ferdinand Marcos to the Senate Presidency. Prohibited from even going to the comfort room, he had to relieve in his pants until Almendras&#x27; arrival. He voted for party-mate Eulogio Rodriguez just as Almendras arrived, and had to be carried off via stretcher out of the session hall due to exhaustion. However, Almendras voted for Marcos, and the latter wrested the Senate Presidency from the Nacionalistas after more than a decade of control.

On December 16, 2010, Werner Kogler of the Austrian Green Party gave his speech before the budget committee, criticizing the failings of the budget and the governing parties (Social Democratic Party and Austrian People&#x27;s Party) in the last years. The filibuster lasted for 12 hours and 42 minutes (starting at 13:18, and speaking until 2:00 in the morning), thus breaking the previous record held by his party-colleague Madeleine Petrovic (10 hours and 35 minutes on March 11, 1993), after which the standing orders were changed, limiting speaking time to 20 minutes. However, it did not keep Kogler from giving his speech.

==United States==

===Senate===

The filibuster is a powerful legislative device in the United States Senate. Senate rules permit a senator or senators to speak for as long as they wish and on any topic they choose, unless &quot;three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn&quot; (usually 60 out of 100 senators) bring debate to a close by invoking cloture under Senate Rule XXII. Even if a filibuster attempt is unsuccessful, the process takes floor time. Defenders call the filibuster &quot;The Soul of the Senate&quot;.

The procedure is not enumerated in the U.S. Constitution; it only became theoretically possible with a change of Senate rules in 1806, and was not used until 1837. Rarely used for much of the Senate&#x27;s first two centuries, it was strengthened in the 1970s, and especially since the 2010s the majority has preferred to avoid filibusters by moving to other business when a filibuster is threatened and attempts to achieve cloture have failed. As a result, in recent decades this has come to mean that all major legislation (apart from budget reconciliation, which requires a simple 51-vote majority) now requires a 60-vote majority to pass.

Under current Senate rules, any modification or limitation of the filibuster would be a rule change that itself could be filibustered, with two-thirds of those senators present and voting (as opposed to the normal three-fifths of those sworn) needing to vote to break the filibuster. However, under Senate precedents, a simple majority can act (and has acted) to limit the practice by overruling decisions of the chair. The removal or substantial limitation of the filibuster by a simple majority, rather than a rule change, is called the constitutional option by proponents, and the nuclear option by opponents.

On November 21, 2013, the Democratic-controlled Senate voted 52 to 48 to require only a majority vote to end a filibuster of all executive and judicial nominees, excluding Supreme Court nominees, rather than the three-fifths of votes previously required. On April 6, 2017, the Republican-controlled Senate voted 52 to 48 to require only a majority vote to end a filibuster of Supreme Court nominees. A three-fifths (60 vote) supermajority is still required to end filibusters on legislation.

While president, Donald Trump spoke out against the 60-vote requirement for legislation on several occasions. In opposition to Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell committed to not abolish the filibuster for legislation; in April 2017, a broad mix of 61 senators (32 Republicans, 28 Democrats, and one independent) signed a letter stating their support for the 60-vote threshold and their opposition to abolishing the filibuster for legislation.

In 2021, the Senate filibuster&#x27;s past, particularly its historical usage in blocking civil rights legislation, a practice described by the Associated Press as racist, fuelled arguments for its end. On January 19, 2022, the Democratic-controlled Senate voted to change the filibuster. The vote, however, failed 52–48, due to the defection of Democratic Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema.

=== House of Representatives ===
In the United States House of Representatives, the filibuster (the right to unlimited debate) was used until 1842, when a permanent rule limiting the duration of debate was created. The disappearing quorum was a tactic used by the minority until Speaker Thomas Brackett Reed eliminated it in 1890. As the membership of the House grew much larger than the Senate, the House had acted earlier to control floor debate and the delay and blocking of floor votes. The magic minute allows party leaders to speak for as long as they wish, which Kevin McCarthy used in 2021 to set a record for the longest speech on the House floor (8 hours and 33 minutes) in opposition to the Build Back Better Act.

=== State legislatures ===
Only 14 state legislatures permit a filibuster:
* Alabama
* Alaska
* Arkansas
* Connecticut
* Florida
* Hawaii
* Idaho
* Maine
* Missouri
* Nebraska
* South Carolina
* Texas
* Utah
* Vermont

==France==
In France, since the duration of speeches themselves are limited, points of order (&quot;rappels au règlement&quot;) and — especially — amendments are popular tools for parliamentary obstructionism.

The record number of amendments occurred in August 2006; the left-wing opposition submitted 137,449 amendments to the proposed law bringing the share in Gaz de France owned by the French state from 80% to 34% in order to allow for the merger between Gaz de France and Suez. Normal parliamentary procedure would have required 10 years to vote on all the amendments.

The French constitution gives the government two options to defeat such a filibuster. The first such option was originally the use of the article 49 paragraph 3 procedure, according to which the law was adopted unless a majority is reached on a no-confidence motion (A reform of July 2008 resulted in this power being restricted to budgetary measures only, plus one time each ordinary session — i.e. from October to June — on any bill. Before this reform, article 49.3 was frequently used, especially when the government lacked a majority in the National Assembly to support the text but still enough to avoid a no-confidence vote). The second option is article 44 paragraph 3, through which the government can force a global vote on all amendments it did not approve or submit itself.

In the end, the government did not have to use either of those procedures. As the parliamentary debate started, the left-wing opposition chose to withdraw all the amendments to allow for the vote to proceed. The &#x27;filibuster&#x27; was aborted because the opposition to the privatisation of Gaz de France appeared to lack support amongst the general population. It also appeared that this privatisation law could be used by the left-wing in the presidential election of 2007 as a political argument. Indeed, Nicolas Sarkozy — president of the Union pour un Mouvement Populaire (UMP, the right-wing party), Interior Minister, former Finance Minister and future President — had previously promised that the share owned by the French government in Gaz de France would never go below 70%.

==Chile==

In 1993, Jorge Ulloa of the Independent Democratic Union held a six-hour-long speech at the Chamber of Deputies in Valparaíso, to allow Pablo Longueira to arrive from Concepción and vote on the impeachment of three Supreme Court justices.

In the Chamber of Deputies of Chile, on November 8, 2021, Jaime Naranjo, deputy from the Socialist Party, spoke for almost 15 hours during the discussion of the impeachment against President Sebastián Piñera, allowing for Broad Front&#x27;s Gonzalo Winter and Giorgio Jackson (both on a COVID-19 close contact pre-emptive quarantine until that midnight) to arrive in Congress to participate in the session. Christian Democratic Jorge Sabag was in Chillán and had a PCR test taken earlier that day; although initially refusing to attend the session, members of the Christian Democratic Party board convinced him to make the trip to Valparaíso, arriving that night, just after Jackson and Winter. Their votes were essential to impeach Piñera.

==Hong Kong==
The first incidence of filibuster in the Legislative Council (LegCo) after the Handover occurred during the second reading of the Provision of Municipal Services (Reorganization) Bill in 1999, which aimed at dissolving the partially elected Urban Council and Regional Council. As the absence of some pro-Establishment legislators would mean an inadequate support for the passing of the bill, the Pro-establishment Camp filibustered along with Michael Suen, then Secretary for Constitutional Affairs; voting on the bill was delayed until the following day so the absentees could cast their votes. Though the filibuster was criticised by the pro-democracy camp, Lau Kong-wah of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB) defended their actions, saying &quot;it (a filibuster) is totally acceptable in a parliamentary assembly.&quot;

Legislators of the Pro-democracy Camp filibustered during a debate about financing the construction of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link by raising many questions on very minor issues, delaying the passing of the bill from December 18, 2009, to January 16, 2010. The Legislative Council Building was surrounded by thousands of anti–high-speed rail protesters during the course of the meetings.

In 2012, Albert Chan and Wong Yuk-man of People Power submitted a total of 1306 amendments to the Legislative Council (Amendment) Bill, by which the government attempted to forbid lawmakers from participating in by-elections after their resignation. The bill was a response to the so-called Five Constituencies Referendum, in which 5 lawmakers from the pro-democracy camp resigned and then joined the by-election, claiming that it would affirm the public&#x27;s support to push forward electoral reform. The pro-democracy camp strongly opposed the bill, saying it was a deprivation of the citizens&#x27; political rights. As a result of the filibuster, the LegCo carried on multiple overnight debates on the amendments. In the morning of May 17, 2012, the President of the LegCo, Jasper Tsang, terminated the debate, citing Article 92 of the Rules of Procedure of LegCo: &quot;In any matter not provided for in these Rules of Procedure, the practice and procedure to be followed in the Council shall be such as may be decided by the President who may, if he thinks fit, be guided by the practice and procedure of other legislatures.&quot; In the end, all motions to amend the bill were defeated and the bill was passed.

To ban filibuster, Ip Kwok-him of the DAB sought to limit each member to move only one motion, by amending the procedures of the Finance Committee and its two subcommittees in 2013. All 27 members from pan-democracy camp submitted 1.9 million amendments. The Secretariat estimated that 408 man-months (each containing 156 working hours) were needed to vet the facts and accuracy of the motions, and — if all amendments were admitted by the chairman — the voting time would take 23,868 two-hour meetings.

== Italy ==

In Italy, filibustering has ancient traditions and is expressed overall with the proposition of legal texts such as motions or amendments on which debates take place.

==Iran==
During Iranian oil nationalisation, the filibustering speech of Hossain Makki — the National Front deputy — took four days and made the pro-British and pro-royalists in Majlis (Iran) inactive. For four days Makki forestalled the vote by talking about the country&#x27;s tortuous experience with AIOC and the shortcomings of the bill. Four days later when the term ended, the debate had reached no conclusion. The fate of the bill remained to be decided by the next Majlis.

==South Korea==
South Korean opposition lawmakers started a filibuster on February 23, 2016, to stall the Anti-Terrorism bill, which they claimed would give too much power to the National Intelligence Service and result in invasions of citizens&#x27; privacy. The filibuster ended on March 2 with a total of 193 hours, and the passing of the bill. South Korea&#x27;s 20th legislative elections were held 2 months after the filibuster, and the opposite party the Minjoo Party of Korea won more seats than the ruling party, the Saenuri Party.

== Spain ==
In the Catalonian parliament, opposition lawmakers started a filibuster on September 6, 2017, to stall the independence referendum.

<text>Ellery Queen is a pseudonym created in 1928 by the American detective fiction writers Frederic Dannay (1905–1982) and Manfred Bennington Lee (1905–1971). It is also the name of their main fictional detective, a mystery writer in New York City who helps his police inspector father solve baffling murder cases. From 1929 to 1971, Dannay and Lee wrote around forty novels and short story collections in which Ellery Queen appears as a character. 

Under the pseudonym Ellery Queen, they also edited more than thirty anthologies of crime fiction and true crime. Dannay founded, and for many years edited, the crime fiction magazine &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;, which has been published continuously from 1941 to the present. From 1961 onwards, Dannay and Lee commissioned other authors to write thrillers using the pseudonym Ellery Queen, but not featuring Ellery Queen as a character; some such novels were juvenile and were credited to Ellery Queen Jr. They also wrote four novels under the pseudonym Barnaby Ross, which featured the detective Drury Lane. Several movies, radio shows, and television shows have been based on their works.

Dannay and Lee were cousins, who were better known by their professional names. Frederic Dannay was the professional name of Daniel Nathan and Manfred Bennington Lee that of Emanuel Benjamin Lepofsky.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica/Ellery-Queen&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;somethingisgoingtohappen/rand-b-lee&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2013, the complete works of Ellery Queen have been represented by JABberwocky Literary Agency.&lt;ref name=&quot;queen.spaceports/Copyright&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal lives of Dannay and Lee==
Manfred Bennington Lee was born as Emanuel Benjamin Lepofsky on January 11, 1905, in Brooklyn, New York. He graduated from the New York University with a &quot;summa cum laude&quot; degree in English in the 1920s. He died on April 3, 1971, in Roxbury, Connecticut, survived by his second wife Kaye Brinker and seven children from the two marriages.

Frederic Dannay was born as Daniel Nathan on October 20, 1905, in Brooklyn, New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;queen.spaceports/Whodunit-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He married his third wife Rose Koppel, an assistant registrar at the Ethical Culture Fieldston School, in 1975 (his first two wives had both died; Dannay had three children from those marriages). He died on September 3, 1982, in White Plains, New York.

== Pseudonym==

Ellery Queen was created in the fall of 1928 when Dannay and Lee entered a mystery novel writing contest offering a prize of $7500 () jointly sponsored by &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; magazine and Frederick A. Stokes Company. They decided to use as their collective pseudonym the same name they had given to their detective as they believed readers tended to remember the names of detectives but forget those of their creators. They were informed that they had won the contest, but &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; magazine went bankrupt and was absorbed by &quot;The Smart Set&quot; magazine before they received any money.

&quot;The Smart Set&quot; magazine rejudged the contest and awarded the prize to an entry by the writer Isabel Briggs Myers but in 1929, Frederick A. Stokes Company agreed to publish Dannay and Lee&#x27;s story under the title &quot;The Roman Hat Mystery.&quot; Buoyed by its success, they were contracted to write more mysteries and they went on to write a successful series of novels and short stories that lasted 42 years.

During the 1940s, Ellery Queen was probably the most popular American mystery writer. More than 150 million copies of Queen&#x27;s books were sold globally and &#x27;he&#x27; remained the best-selling mystery writer in Japan till the end of the 1970s.

Many short stories were also published under the Queen name, which were mostly well-received. The novelist and critic Julian Symons called them &quot;as absolutely fair and totally puzzling as the most passionate devotee of orthodoxy could wish&quot; and said they were &quot;composed with wonderful skill&quot; whereas the historian Jaques Barzun said they were &quot;full of ingenious gimmicks and adorned with excellent titles&quot;.

Dannay, without much involvement from Lee, founded the crime fiction magazine &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot; in 1941, and served as its editor-in-chief until his death in 1982. However, they together edited numerous collections and anthologies of crime fiction such as &quot;The Misadventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; and &quot;101 Years&#x27; Entertainment, The Great Detective Stories, 1841–1941.&quot; They were awarded the Grand Master Award by the Mystery Writers of America in 1961 for their work under the Ellery Queen pseudonym.

From 1961 onwards, they allowed the &#x27;Ellery Queen&#x27; &quot;nom de plume&quot; to be used as a house name for several crime thrillers written by other authors. Dannay had initially opposed this project but was eventually persuaded by Lee, who was in financial difficulty at that time and wanted the extra royalties it would bring. The editing and supervision of these thrillers was done almost entirely by Lee; Dannay refused to even read these books. 

None of the ghostwritten novels feature Ellery Queen as a character. Three of them star &quot;the governor&#x27;s troubleshooter&quot; Micah &quot;Mike&quot; McCall and six of them feature Captain Tim Corrigan of the New York City Police Department. The prominent science-fiction writer Jack Vance wrote three such novels including the 1965 locked room mystery &quot;A Room to Die In&quot;.

Dannay and Lee remained reticent about their writing methods. Novelist and critic H.R.F. Keating wrote, &quot;How actually did they do it? Did they sit together and hammer the stuff out word by word? Did one write the dialogue and the other the narration? ... What eventually happened was that Fred Dannay, in principle, produced the plots, the clues, and what would have to be deduced from them as well as the outlines of the characters and Manfred Lee clothed it all in words. But it is unlikely to have been as clear cut as that.&quot;

According to the crime fiction critic Otto Penzler, &quot;As an anthologist, Ellery Queen is without peer, his taste unequalled. As a bibliographer and a collector of the detective short story, Queen is, again, a historical personage. Indeed, Ellery Queen clearly is, after Poe, the most important American in mystery fiction.&quot;

British crime novelist Margery Allingham said that Dannay and Lee had &quot;done far more for the detective story than any other two men put together&quot; and critic Anthony Berkeley Cox famously quoted &quot;Ellery Queen &quot;is&quot; the American Detective Novel&quot;.

Although Dannay outlived Lee by eleven years, the Ellery Queen &quot;nom de plume&quot; died with Lee. The last novel featuring the character Ellery Queen, &quot;A Fine and Private Place&quot;, was published in 1971, the year of Lee&#x27;s death. However, &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot; is still in print as of 2023, now published as six &quot;double issues&quot; per year by Dell Magazines.

==Barnaby Ross==
In 1932 and 1933, Dannay and Lee wrote four novels using the pseudonym Barnaby Ross featuring Drury Lane, a Shakespearean actor who had retired from the stage due to deafness and is now often consulted as an amateur detective. The novels also feature Inspector Thumm (initially as a member of the New York police, later as a private investigator) and his crime-solving daughter Patience. From the 1940s, republications of the Drury Lane books were mostly under the Ellery Queen name.

In the early 1930s, before their identity as the authors behind Ellery Queen and Barnaby Ross had been made public, Dannay and Lee staged a series of public debates with Lee impersonating Queen and Dannay impersonating Ross, both of them wearing masks to preserve their anonymity. According to H.R.F. Keating, &quot;People said Ross must be the wit and critic Alexander Woollcott and Queen [must be] S.S. Van Dine, creator of the super-snob detective Philo Vance, on whom &#x27;Ellery Queen&#x27; was indeed modeled.&quot;

In the 1960s, Dannay and Lee allowed the Barnaby Ross name to be used as a pseudonym for a series of historical romance novels by the writer Don Tracy.

==Fictional style==
The Queen novels are examples of &quot;fair play&quot; mysteries, a subgenre of the whodunit mystery in which the reader obtains the clues along with the detective and the mysteries are presented as intellectually challenging puzzles. These type of novels comprised what would later be known as the Golden age of detective fiction (Usually dated from 1920 to 1940 but some critics include the 1940s and even the 1950s). Mystery writer John Dickson Carr called this subgenre &quot;the grandest game in the world&quot;.

The first Ellery Queen book &quot;The Roman Hat Mystery&quot; established a reliable template: a geographic formula title (&quot;The Dutch Shoe Mystery&quot;, &quot;The Egyptian Cross Mystery&quot;, etc.); an unusual crime; a complex series of clues and red herrings; multiple misdirected solutions before the final correct solution is revealed, and a cast of supporting characters including Ellery Queen, the detective, Queen&#x27;s father Inspector Richard Queen and his irascible assistant Sergeant Thomas Velie. What became the best known part of the early Ellery Queen books was the &quot;Challenge to the Reader&quot;, a single page near the end of the book, on which Queen, the detective, paused the narrative, directly addressed the reader, declared that they had now seen all the clues needed to solve the mystery, and only one solution was possible. According to Julian Symons, &quot;The rare distinction of the books is that this claim is accurate. These are problems in deduction that do really permit of only one answer, and there are few crime stories indeed of which this can be said... Judged as exercises in rational deduction, these are certainly among the best detective stories ever written.&quot;
In many earlier books like &quot;The Greek Coffin Mystery&quot; and &quot;The Siamese Twin Mystery&quot;, multiple solutions to the mystery are proposed, a feature that also showed up in later books such as &quot;Double, Double&quot; and &quot;Ten Days&#x27; Wonder&quot;. Queen&#x27;s &quot;false solution, followed by the true&quot; became a hallmark of the canon. Another stylistic element in many early books (notably &quot;The Dutch Shoe Mystery&quot;, &quot;The French Powder Mystery&quot; and &quot;Halfway House&quot;) is Queen&#x27;s method of creating a list of attributes (the murderer is male, the murderer smokes a pipe, etc.) and comparing each suspect to these attributes, thereby reducing the list of suspects to a single name, often an unlikely one.

By the late 1930s, when Ellery Queen, the fictional character, had moved to Hollywood to try movie scriptwriting, the tone of the novels changed along with the detective&#x27;s character. Romance was introduced, solutions began to involve more psychological elements, and the &quot;Challenge to the Reader&quot; vanished. The novels also shifted from mere puzzles to more introspective themes. The three novels set in the fictional New England town of Wrightsville even showed the limitations of Queen&#x27;s methods of detection. Julian Symons said &quot;Ellery... occasionally lost his father, as his exploits took place more frequently in the small town of Wrightsville... where his arrival as a house guest was likely to be the signal for the commission of one or more murders. Very intelligently, Dannay and Lee used this change in locale to loosen the structure of their stories. More emphasis was placed on personal relationships and less on the details of investigation.&quot;

In the 1950s and the 1960s, Dannay and Lee became more experimental, especially in the novels they wrote with other writers. &quot;The Player on the Other Side&quot; (1963), ghost-written with Theodore Sturgeon, delves more deeply into motive than most Queen novels. &quot;And on the Eighth Day&quot; (1964), ghost-written with Avram Davidson, is a religious allegory about fascism.

==Ellery Queen, the fictional character==
Ellery Queen, the fictional character, is the hero of more than thirty novels and several short story collections, written by Dannay and Lee and published under the Ellery Queen pseudonym. The creation of Queen was probably inspired by Philo Vance, the detective created by the writer S.S. Van Dine. According to the critic H.R.F. Keating, &quot;Later the cousins [Dannay and Lee] took a sharper view of Vance, Manfred Lee calling him, with typical vehemence, &#x27;the biggest prig that ever came down the pike&#x27;.&quot;

As Van Dine had done earlier with Philo Vance, Dannay and Lee gave Ellery Queen an extremely elaborate back story that was rarely mentioned after the first few novels. In fact, Queen goes through several transformations in his personality and his approach to investigation over the course of the series.

In the earlier novels, he is a snobbish Harvard-educated intellectual of independent means who wears pince-nez glasses and investigates crimes because he finds them stimulating. He supposedly derives these characteristics from his unnamed late mother, the daughter of an aristocratic New York family, who had married Richard Queen, a bluff and short policeman.

Beginning in the 1938 novel &quot;The Four of Hearts&quot;, he spends some time working in Hollywood as a screenwriter. Soon, he has a slick façade, is part of Hollywood society and hobnobs comfortably with the wealthy and the famous. Beginning with &quot;Calamity Town&quot; in 1942, he becomes less of a cypher and more of a human being, often becoming emotionally affected by the people in his cases, and at one point quitting detective work altogether. &quot;Calamity Town&quot; and some other novels during this period are set in the imaginary town of Wrightsville, where subsidiary characters recur from story to story as Queen relates to the various strata of American society as an outsider.

However, after his Hollywood and Wrightsville periods, he returns to his New York City roots for the rest of his career, and is then seen again as an ultra-logical crime solver who remains distant from his cases. In the very late novels, he often seems a near-faceless, near-characterless persona whose role is purely to solve the mystery. So striking are the differences between the different periods of the Ellery Queen character that Julian Symons advanced the theory that there were two Ellery Queens — an older and younger brother.

Queen is said to be married and the father of a child in the introductions of the first few novels, but this plot line is never developed and he is portrayed as a bachelor in all of his later appearances. Nikki Porter, who acts as Queen&#x27;s secretary and is something of a love interest, is first introduced in the radio series &quot;The Adventures of Ellery Queen&quot; in 1939. Her first appearance in a written story is on the final pages of the 1943 novel &quot;There Was an Old Woman&quot;, when a character with whom Queen has had some flirtatious moments suddenly announces that she will change her name to Nikki Porter and will work as Queen&#x27;s secretary. Nikki Porter appears sporadically thereafter in the novels and short stories, linking the character from radio and movies to the written canon.

Paula Paris, an agoraphobic gossip columnist, is linked romantically with Queen in the 1938 novel &quot;The Four of Hearts&quot; and in some short stories in the 1940s but does not appear in the radio series or films and soon vanishes from the books. Queen is not given any serious romantic interests after Nikki Porter and Paula Paris disappear from the books.

The Queen household, an apartment on West 87th street in New York City, is shared by Ellery Queen and his widowed father, Richard Queen. (Very late in the series, Richard Queen remarries, but how this affects his living arrangement is never spelled out.) The household also contains a houseboy named Djuna in the earlier novels. Possibly of Roma origin, Djuna appears periodically in the canon, apparently ageless and family-free, in a supporting role as cook, receiver of parcels, valet, and occasional comedy relief. He is the protagonist in most of the juvenile novels ghost-written under the pseudonym Ellery Queen Jr.

==In other media==

===Radio===
The radio series &quot;The Adventures of Ellery Queen&quot; was broadcast on several networks from 1939 to 1948 with the lead role played by Hugh Marlowe (1939–1940), Carleton Young (1942–1943), Sydney Smith (1943–1947), Lawrence Dobkin (1947–48) and Howard Culver (1948). All episodes in this series were paused just before the end to allow a panel of celebrities a chance to solve the mystery. Some of the surviving scripts were published for the first time in the 2005 book &quot;The Adventure of the Murdered Moths.&quot;

Between 1965 and 1967, &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Minute Mysteries&quot; were broadcast as radio fillers. They began with the radio announcer Bill Owen saying &quot;This is Ellery Queen...&quot; and contained a short one-minute case.

===Television===
Some of the scripts of the television series &quot;The Adventures of Ellery Queen&quot; (1950–1951 on Dumont, 1951-1952 on ABC) were written by Helene Hanff, best known for her 1970 novel &quot;84, Charing Cross Road&quot;. Shortly after the series began, Richard Hart, who played Queen, died and was replaced by Lee Bowman.

In 1954, Norvin Productions produced the syndicated series &quot;Ellery Queen, Detective&quot; with Hugh Marlowe as the title character. Episodes from this series were broadcast on many local American networks and in United Kingdom between 1954 and 1959 under various titles like &quot;Mystery Is My Business&quot;, &quot;Crime Detective&quot; and &quot;New Adventures of Ellery Queen.&quot;

George Nader played Queen in NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Further Adventures of Ellery Queen&quot; (1958–1959), but was replaced by Lee Philips in the final episodes.

Peter Lawford starred as Ellery Queen in the 1971 television film &quot;Ellery Queen: Don&#x27;t Look Behind You (&quot;a loose adaptation of the 1949 novel &quot;Cat of Many Tails)&quot;. Harry Morgan played Inspector Richard Queen in this film, but he is described as Ellery Queen&#x27;s uncle (perhaps to account for the fact that Morgan was only eight years Lawford&#x27;s senior, or to account for Lawford&#x27;s British accent).

The 1975 television movie &quot;Ellery Queen&quot; (aka &quot;Too Many Suspects&quot;, a loose adaptation of the 1965 novel &quot;The Fourth Side of the Triangle&quot;) led to the 1975–1976 television series of the same name starring Jim Hutton in the title role with David Wayne as his widowed father Richard Queen. This series was developed by Richard Levinson and William Link, who later won a Special Edgars Award for creating it and &quot;Columbo&quot;. It was done as a period piece set in New York City in 1946–1947. Sergeant Velie, Inspector Queen&#x27;s assistant, regularly appeared in it; he had previously appeared in the novels and the radio series, but had not been seen regularly in any of the previous television versions. Each episode contained a &quot;Challenge to the Viewer&quot; in which Queen broke the fourth wall to go over the facts of the case and encouraged the audience to try to solve the mystery before the correct solution was revealed. Eve Arden, George Burns, Joan Collins, Roddy McDowall, Milton Berle, Guy Lombardo, Rudy Vallée, and Don Ameche were among the celebrities featured in this series.

In 2011, in an episode of the crime series &quot;Leverage&quot;, “The 10 Li&#x27;l Grifters Job”, Timothy Hutton&#x27;s character Nate Ford appears at a murder mystery party dressed as Ellery Queen, in a homage to the actor&#x27;s late father, Jim Hutton.

In February 1990, Queen was used as a guest star by the comic book writer Mike W. Barr in the ninth issue of the magazine &quot;Maze Agency&quot; in the story titled &quot;The English Channeler Mystery: A Problem in Deduction&quot;.

In July 1996, Queen, the character, was highlighted in the &quot;Gosho Aoyoma&#x27;s Mystery Library&quot; section of volume 11 of the &quot;Detective Conan&quot; manga, a section of the series in which Aoyoma introduces a detective (or occasionally a villain) from mystery literature. A character also stated that he preferred Queen, the author, to Arthur Conan Doyle in volume 12 of the manga.

===Board games and jigsaw puzzles===
Ellery Queen&#x27;s name was attached to many games and puzzles including (&quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Great Mystery Game) Trapped&quot; in 1956, &quot;The Case of the Elusive Assassin by Ellery Queen&quot; in 1967, &quot;Ellery Queen: The Case of His Headless Highness&quot; in 1973, &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine Game&quot; in 1986 and a VCR-based game called &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Operation: Murder&quot; (loosely based on &quot;The Dutch Shoe Mystery&quot;) in 1986.

<doc id="157870" wikidata="Q2205151" url="?curid=157870" title="Boron deficiency (plant disorder)">
<text>Boron deficiency is a common deficiency of the micronutrient boron in plants. It is the most widespread micronutrient deficiency around the world and causes large losses in crop production and crop quality. Boron deficiency affects vegetative and reproductive growth of plants, resulting in inhibition of cell expansion, death of meristem, and reduced fertility.

Plants contain boron both in a water-soluble and insoluble form. In intact plants, the amount of water-soluble boron fluctuates with the amount of boron supplied, while insoluble boron does not. The appearance of boron deficiency coincides with the decrease of water-insoluble boron. It appears that the insoluble boron is the functional form while the soluble boron represents the surplus.

Boron is essential for the growth of higher plants. The primary function of the element is to provide structural integrity to the cell wall in plants. Other functions likely include the maintenance of the plasma membrane and other metabolic pathways.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms include dying growing tips and bushy, stunted growth; extreme cases may prevent fruit set. Crop-specific symptoms include:
*&quot;Apple&quot; - interacting with calcium, may display as &quot;water core&quot;, internal areas appearing frozen
*&quot;Beetroot&quot; - rough, cankered patches on roots, internal brown rot.
*&quot;Cabbage&quot; - distorted leaves, hollow areas in stems.
*&quot;Cauliflower&quot; - poor development of curds, and brown patches. Stems, leafstalks and midribs roughened.
*&quot;Celery&quot; - leaf stalks develop cracks on the upper surface, inner tissue is reddish brown.
*&quot;Celeriac&quot; - causes brown heart rot.
*&quot;Mango&quot; - fruits show internal lesions and cracking
*&quot;Pears&quot; - new shoots die back in spring, fruits develop hard brown flecks in the skin.
*&quot;Strawberries&quot; - Stunted growth, foliage small, yellow and puckered at tips. Fruits are small and pale.
*&quot;Swede (rutabaga)&quot; and &quot;turnip&quot; - brown or gray concentric rings develop inside the roots.
*&quot;Arecaceae&quot; (&quot;Palm Tree&quot;) - brown spots on fronds &amp; lower productivity.

==Soil conditions==
Boron is present in the soil in many forms, the most common being boric acid (H3BO3). An adequate amount of boron in the soil is 12 mg/kg. If the boron content of the soil drops below 0.14 mg/kg then boron deficiency is likely to be observed. Boron deficiency is also observed in basic soils with a high pH because in basic conditions boric acid exists in an undissociated form which the plant is unable to absorb. Soils with low organic matter content (&lt;1.5%) are also susceptible to boron deficiency. Highly leached sandy soils are also characteristic of boron deficiency because the boron will not be retained in the soil.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.agnet.org/library/bc/51006/&quot;&gt;www.agnet.org &lt;/ref&gt; Boron toxicity is also possible if the boron content of the soil is high enough that the plant cannot cope with the excess boron. The levels at which boron is toxic to plants varies with different species of plants.

==Boron requirements==
Boron is an essential micronutrient which means it is essential for plant growth and development, but is required in very small quantities. Although Boron requirements vary among crops, the optimum boron content of the leaves for most crops is 20-100 ppm. Excess boron can result in boron toxicity and the toxicity level varies between plants.

==Treatment==
Boric acid (16.5% boron), borax (11.3% boron) or Solubor (20.5% boron) can be applied to soils to correct boron deficiency. Typical applications of actual boron are about 1.1 kg/hectare or 1.0 lb/acre but optimum levels of boron vary with plant type. Borax, Boric Acid or Solubor can be dissolved in water and sprayed or applied to soil in blended dry fertilizer. Excess boron is toxic to plants so care must be taken to ensure correct application rate and even coverage. While boron may be sprayed on leaves, excess will cause plant damage. Application of boron may not correct boron deficiency in alkaline soils because even with the addition of boron, it may remain unavailable for plant absorption. Continued application of boron may be necessary in soils that are susceptible to leaching such as sandy soils. Flushing soils containing toxic levels of boron with water can remove the boron through leaching.

A boron-containing granular potash fertilizer, called Aspire, has been developed to evenly distribute boron through potassium chloride granules. This product contains two forms of boron - sodium borate for quick release and calcium borate for gradual release - to ensure season-long boron availability. These boron-infused potash granules prevent localized boron toxicity, while the granular size allows it to be distributed by common fertilizer equipment along with typical granular NPK fertilizer blends.

==Functions==
Once boron has been absorbed by the plant and incorporated into the various structures that require boron, the plant is unable to disassemble these structures and re-transport boron through the plant resulting in boron being a non-mobile nutrient. Due to translocation difficulties the youngest leaves often show deficiency symptoms first.

===Cell wall===
Boron is part of the dRG-II-B complex which is involved in the cross linking for pectin located in the primary cell wall and the middle lamella of plant cells. This cross linking is thought to stabilize the matrix of plant cell walls.

===Enhances protein synthesis ===
===Germination and pollination===
The B requirement is much higher for reproductive growth than for vegetative growth in most
plant species. Boron increases flower production and retention, pollen tube elongation and
germination, and seed and fruit development.

A deficiency of B can cause incomplete pollination of corn or prevent maximum pod-set in
soybeans.

===Sugar translocation===
Photosynthesis transforms sunlight energy into plant energy compounds such as sugars. For this
process to continue in plants, the sugars must be moved away from the site of their development,
and stored or used to make other compounds.

Boron increases the rate of transport of sugars (which are produced by photosynthesis in mature
plant leaves) to actively growing regions and also in developing fruits.
Boron is essential for providing sugars which are needed for root growth in all plants and also for
normal development of root nodules in legumes such as alfalfa, soybeans and peanuts.

<doc id="157871" wikidata="Q3131232" url="?curid=157871" title="SportsCenter">
<text>SportsCenter (SC) is an American daily sports news television program that serves as the flagship program and brand of American cable and satellite television network ESPN and occasionally on sister broadcast network ABC. The show covers various sports teams and athletes from around the world and often shows highlights of sports from the day. Originally broadcast only once per day, &quot;SportsCenter&quot; now has up to twelve airings each day, excluding overnight repeats. The show often covers the major sports in the U.S. including basketball, hockey, football, and baseball. &quot;SportsCenter&quot; is also known for its recaps after sports events and its in-depth analysis.

Since it premiered upon the network&#x27;s launch on September 7, 1979, the show has broadcast more than 60,000 episodes, more than any other program on American television; &quot;SportsCenter&quot; is broadcast from ESPN&#x27;s studio facilities in Bristol, Connecticut, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles.

== Overview and format ==
As of March 2023 , &quot;SportsCenter&quot; normally runs live at the following times:

* Weekdays: 7:00–8:00 a.m., 2:00–3:00 p.m., 6:00–7:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m.–1:00 a.m. ET.
* Saturday: 7:00 a.m.–9:00 a.m., and 12:00 am.–2:00 a.m. ET.
* Sunday: 7:00–9:00 a.m., and 11:00 p.m.–12:30 a.m. ET.

The program&#x27;s runtime and starting time depend on the games&#x27; runtime. In case a game overlaps the starting time of any &quot;SportsCenter&quot; edition, it is occasionally moved to either ESPN2 or ESPNews (depending on whether one of the networks is carrying an event) until the event concludes. Conversely, &quot;SportsCenter&quot; may start early and run longer if the preceding event finishes early or breaking sports news requires it.

Most editions of the show originate from a studio at ESPN&#x27;s headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut. However, the Scott Van Pelt edition of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; has been produced out of a studio in Washington, D.C., inside the ABC News bureau since 2020, in the former studio of &quot;Around the Horn&quot;. The 1 a.m. Eastern edition of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; has been produced out of ESPN&#x27;s Los Angeles Production Center at L.A. Live since 2009; that edition also is repeated during the overnight hours.

ESPN also produces short 90-second capsules known as &quot;SportsCenter Right Now&quot;, which air at select points within game telecasts on the network and sister broadcast network ABC to provide updates of other ongoing and recently concluded sporting events.

In addition to providing game highlights and news from the day in sports outside of the scheduled slate of games (including team player and management transactions, injury reports and other news), the program also features live reports from sites of sports events scheduled to be held or already concluded, extensive analysis of completed and upcoming sports events from sport-specific analysts and special contributors, and feature segments providing interviews with players, coaches, and franchise management in the headlines. In addition to airing simulcasts or network-exclusive editions on sister networks ESPN2 and ESPNews, the program also produces short in-game updates during sports events aired on ABC and, until 2017, an interstitial play countdown segment for fellow network Disney XD.

=== Conditions to showing highlights ===
Some sports leagues and organizations, including the National Basketball Association (NBA), National Hockey League (NHL), and college athletic conferences that are members of the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) and the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), allow for brief highlights to be shown while a game is in progress. From 2006 to 2013, Major League Baseball only allowed ongoing game highlights to air during &quot;SportsCenter&quot; within the &quot;Baseball Tonight Extra&quot; segments in the broadcast. The National Football League (NFL) does not permit the use of highlights for games that are ongoing at all, outside of those featured within its own live game broadcasts on the league&#x27;s broadcast partners.

ESPN is traditionally unable to air highlights of Olympic events until after they have aired on tape-delay on NBC (which currently holds the American rights to the Olympic Games through 2032) or its co-owned sister cable networks. ESPN began showing more Olympics highlights on-air and online beginning with the 2006 Winter Olympics, with the network obtaining these extended rights from NBC as part of the 2006 deal that saw ABC release Al Michaels from his contract, in order to join John Madden and key production personnel for the new &quot;NBC Sunday Night Football&quot; (this same deal also reverted rights to the Walt Disney-produced &quot;Oswald The Lucky Rabbit&quot; cartoons from Universal Pictures, which originally distributed the shorts).

In addition, there are many anecdotal reports of various television networks (such as CBS Sports, NBC Sports, and beIN Sport) that will not release highlights of certain sporting events to ESPN, unless the originating U.S. broadcaster&#x27;s name is displayed on-screen for the entire length of the highlight (for example, &quot;Courtesy NBC Sports&quot;).

Starting in 2007 and until its final season of broadcasting in 2014, ESPN stopped displaying the actual name of the NASCAR Nationwide Series or Sprint Cup Series race during highlights of such events (for example, the &quot;Allstate 400 at the Brickyard&quot; was referred to as the &quot;Brickyard 400 pres. by Golden Corral&quot;), unless the title sponsor of the race is paid for to the network; a similar stipulation also applied to the network&#x27;s IndyCar Series coverage until 2018.

== History ==
&quot;SportsCenter&quot; was conceived in 1979 and created by ESPN executives Chet Simmons and Scotty Connal. The program was originally anchored by Chris Berman, George Grande, Greg Gumbel, Lee Leonard, Bob Ley, Sal Marchiano and Tom Mees.

===1970s===

Grande introduced the country to ESPN when he co-anchored the premiere episode of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; on September 7, 1979, with Leonard, a longtime New York City sports broadcaster. According to &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Leonard said in the opening of the show: &quot;If you&#x27;re a fan, what you will see in the next minutes, hours, and days to follow may convince you that you&#x27;ve gone to sports heaven.&quot; Grande spent ten more years with ESPN and &quot;SportsCenter&quot; until he left the network in 1989.

Chris Berman joined ESPN one month after its launch and became a fixture on the program until the early 1990s, when his efforts became more focused on National Football League and Major League Baseball coverage. He does, however, still occasionally appear as a substitute anchor. Bob Ley, who also hosted &quot;Outside the Lines&quot;, regularly appeared on the Sunday morning edition of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; until his retirement in 2019.

===1980s===

In 1988, the program&#x27;s format was changed by executive producer Walsh from focusing on individual sports or leagues to a &quot;newspaper-style&quot; structure, prioritizing stories by importance rather than by sport.

The program&#x27;s title sequence during its early years included various kinds of sports balls flying outward, set to a rapid-fire electronic music version of &quot;Pulstar&quot; by Vangelis. By 1989, the first of several theme songs to incorporate ESPN&#x27;s trademark six-note fanfare went into use. The theme music was originally composed by John Colby, who served as ESPN&#x27;s music director from 1984 to 1992, creating and producing music for various sporting events and programs seen on the network. The current version of the theme was composed in 2006 by Annie Roboff, who also co-wrote Faith Hill&#x27;s 1998 hit &quot;This Kiss&quot;.

===1990s===

In 1994, ESPN launched the &quot;This is SportsCenter&quot; advertising campaign, a series of humorous, tongue-in-cheek spots featuring anchors and crew, based on the show&#x27;s opening tagline. The ads ran from 1995 to 2024 when the campaign was replaced by &quot;My Life, My Team.&quot; The team of Dan Patrick and Keith Olbermann—who anchored the 11:00 p.m. (Eastern) edition of the program—achieved great popularity during the late 1980s and the 1990s, a period interrupted by Olbermann&#x27;s brief move to spin-off channel ESPN2 upon that network&#x27;s launch in 1993. After Olbermann left ESPN in 1997, Kenny Mayne became Patrick&#x27;s co-anchor on the late broadcast; when Patrick was moved to the 6:00 p.m. edition, Rich Eisen and Stuart Scott became the show&#x27;s primary anchor team.

===2000s===

In 2001, Toronto-based Bell Globemedia and ESPN (which received a minority stake) jointly acquired The Sports Network (TSN). As part of its shift to ESPN-influenced branding, the specialty channel rebranded its existing sports news program &quot;SportsDesk&quot; and changed its name to &quot;SportsCentre&quot;, using the same introductions and theme music as the ESPN version, except with its title rendered using Canadian spelling.

On September 11, 2001, ESPN interrupted regular programming at 11:05 a.m. Eastern to cover the immediate aftermath of the terror attacks through a simulcast of ABC News coverage. ESPN considered suspending that night&#x27;s editions of &quot;SportsCenter&quot;, before deciding to air a half-hour edition in which they announced the cancellations of major upcoming sporting events.

On June 7, 2004, &quot;SportsCenter&quot; began broadcasting in high definition. Along with the conversion, the program introduced a new set designed by Walt Disney Imagineering (situated in a studio located at ESPN&#x27;s new &quot;Digital Center&quot;), and a new graphics package titled &quot;Revolution&quot; that was developed by Troika Design Group. During that summer, ESPN celebrated its 25th anniversary, by counting down the top 100 moments in sports over the previous 25 years. The countdown was seen on each &quot;SportsCenter&quot; broadcast daily beginning on May 31, 2004; the countdown concluded with the #1 moment, the United States men&#x27;s national ice hockey team&#x27;s victory over the USSR during the 1980 Winter Olympics, airing on September 7, 2004.

During the summer of 2005, &quot;SportsCenter&quot; premiered a segment called &quot;50 States in 50 Days&quot;, where a different &quot;SportsCenter&quot; anchor traveled to a different state each day to discover the sports, sports history, and athletes of the state.

On April 4, 2006, &quot;SportsCenter&quot; began to show highlights of Major League Baseball games in progress at the program&#x27;s airtime; the rights to broadcast these highlights while games were ongoing was previously given exclusivity to fellow ESPN program, &quot;Baseball Tonight&quot;; the in-progress highlights are shown as part of the &quot;Baseball Tonight Extra&quot; segment. Prior to that date, video footage from MLB games was not shown on any &quot;SportsCenter&quot; broadcasts until the games completed play.

On February 11, 2007, following the NBA game between the Chicago Bulls and the Phoenix Suns, &quot;SportsCenter&quot; aired its 30,000th broadcast. The special milestone edition was anchored by Steve Levy and Stuart Scott; Bob Ley, Chris Berman and Dan Patrick made guest appearances to recap events as well as bloopers from the first 10,000 shows (all three men individually counted down each set of 10,000 clips). ESPN also debuted the &quot;SportsCenter Minute&quot;, a one-minute &quot;SportsCenter&quot; update that is streamed exclusively on ESPN.com.

Four months later on May 6, another major change to &quot;SportsCenter&quot; was introduced on that night&#x27;s 11:00 p.m. (Eastern) edition, with the debut of a &quot;rundown&quot; graphic that appears on the right-side third of the screen. This feature was originally only shown during rebroadcasts of the overnight edition on Monday through Saturday nights, and on the main Sunday night telecast; on ESPNHD, the sidebar graphic filled the right pillarbox where the ESPNHD logo would usually appear when standard definition footage was presented.

The 6:00 p.m. edition of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; moved one hour earlier to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on May 28, 2007; at that time, the early-evening edition was, for the first time, expanded to three hours. During that broadcast, ESPN aired live coverage of Roger Clemens&#x27;s second start for the New York Yankees&#x27; minor league affiliate in Scranton, Pennsylvania. The 11:00 p.m. Eastern Time edition of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; on August 7, 2007, which was anchored by John Buccigross and Cindy Brunson, showed live coverage of Barry Bonds&#x27;s 756th career home run, which broke the old MLB record set by Hank Aaron (ESPN was carrying the game live on ESPN2). In August 2008, the former WWE employee Jonathan Coachman joined ESPN to anchor the show.

On August 11, 2008, during the opening week of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, &quot;SportsCenter&quot; began airing live from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The original plan was to start the live block three hours earlier at 6:00 a.m. Eastern; however, the network decided to scale back the length of the daytime broadcast before the expansion occurred.

That same year, Hannah Storm (former NBC Sports reporter and anchor of CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Early Show&quot;) joined ESPN to anchor the 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. block of the program. The new format included two teams of two anchors in three-hour shifts:

* 9:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time: Kevin Negandhi (originally Josh Elliott) and Hannah Storm
* 12:00 p.m. – 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time: Jay Crawford (originally Robert Flores, then John Buccigross) and Chris McKendry

In addition, Sage Steele would provide updates every 30 minutes from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. The changes also included a new website for the program – SportsCenter.com, which launched on August 11, 2008 – to promote more interaction with viewers. To promote these changes, ESPN held an employee casting call to see who would be featured in almost 25 live and unscripted commercials per day. Steve Braband, an International Programmer for the network, won, and was featured in ads shown about every half-hour (excluding from 2:00 to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time) on ESPN. Additionally, the network launched the website, steveislive.com, featuring Braband&#x27;s daily appearance schedule, blog, and video clips of past appearances and audition footage.

Upon that network&#x27;s launch on February 13, 2009, &quot;SportsCenter&quot; began producing a countdown segment, the &quot;SportsCenter High-5&quot;, for sister channel Disney XD (which is owned by ESPN majority owner The Walt Disney Company).

On April 6, 2009 (starting with the 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time edition, which was anchored by Hannah Storm and Sage Steele), &quot;SportsCenter&quot; debuted a new graphics package that saw the &quot;rundown&quot; graphic – shown during the daytime editions – being shifted to the left side of the screen. On that same date, &quot;SportsCenter&quot; began producing its 1:00 a.m. Eastern Time edition of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; live from ESPN&#x27;s production facilities in the newly constructed L.A. Live complex (just across from the Staples Center) in Los Angeles. The set is virtually identical to the setup at the main facilities in Bristol, and the late-night West Coast broadcast would be produced as simply another edition of the program. Neil Everett and Stan Verrett were appointed as the primary anchors for the Los Angeles-based editions of &quot;SportsCenter&quot;. A new BottomLine ticker was also unveiled that day on four of the five ESPN networks (ESPN, ESPN2, ESPN Classic and ESPNU); the redesigned ticker was quickly dropped, reverting to the old BottomLine design – which had been in use since April 2003 – due to an equipment failure (however, this ticker was operational for the 2009 NFL draft and the 2009 NBA draft). After technical issues with the revamped BottomLine were fixed, the new BottomLine was reinstated on July 8.

The 2009 U.S. Open Golf Championship, which was repeatedly delayed due to weather, aired on both NBC and ESPN. Portions of ESPN&#x27;s broadcast, including the early parts of the Monday final round, were presented under the &quot;&quot;SportsCenter&quot; at the U.S. Open&quot; banner – using a similar branding as the segments-within-the-show focusing on nightly highlights and analysis of a particular event originating from the event locations (such as &quot;&quot;SportsCenter&quot; at the Super Bowl&quot; and &quot;&quot;SportsCenter&quot; at the World Series&quot;). In August 2009, Robert Flores – co-anchor of the program&#x27;s 12:00 to 3:00 p.m. block – was replaced on the early-afternoon broadcasts with John Buccigross.

===2010s===

On August 30, 2010, ESPN expanded &quot;SportsCenter&quot; to ESPNEWS, airing an additional seven hours of the program in separate blocks from 3:00 to 6:00 p.m. and 7:00 to 11:00 p.m. Eastern Time, canceling the channel&#x27;s self-named rolling coverage. By late 2010, the &quot;rundown&quot; graphic was expanded to all editions of &quot;SportsCenter&quot;. On April 22, 2011, Josh Elliott – original and main co-anchor of the 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time block of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; – left ESPN to become news anchor for ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and was replaced on the late morning block of the program by Kevin Negandhi.

By mid-2011, shortly after ESPN and ESPN2 both converted to a 16:9 letterbox format (in compliance with the #10 AFD code) on their primary standard definition feeds, &quot;SportsCenter&quot; began showing all high-definition and standard-definition footage in the appropriate aspect ratio on the SD feed (with stylized pillarboxes adorned with the ESPN logo used on footage presented in standard definition). That same year on October, the former WWE employee Todd Grisham joined ESPN to anchor the show. The move required the letterboxed image to be shrunk in order to be displayed in that manner, with the &quot;rundown&quot; graphic continuing to be placed on the left side of the screen. In August 2011, John Anderson – who previously served as the 11:00 p.m. (Eastern) anchor – was moved to the early-evening 6:00 p.m. broadcast, replacing Brian Kenny (who departed ESPN to become a program host for the MLB Network). ESPN launched a completely redesigned SportsCenter.com website on October 16, 2011.

On August 25, 2012, the BottomLine was used to acknowledge the death of astronaut Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the Moon. It was reportedly only the fifth of six times that an outside news event not involving an athlete was reported on the ticker, alongside the news of the September 11 attacks, the death of civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks in 2005, the election of Barack Obama as President of the United States in 2008, the Killing of Osama bin Laden, and the later death of former South African president Nelson Mandela on December 5, 2013.

On December 3, 2012, Lindsay Czarniak became the main co-anchor of the 6:00 p.m. edition of &quot;SportsCenter&quot;. On February 8 and 9, 2013, the 11:00 p.m. editions of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; on both nights were broadcast from Los Angeles, due to a massive snowstorm in the Northeastern United States that prevented some staff from conducting the program out of ESPN&#x27;s Bristol headquarters. Stan Verrett anchored both editions from the network&#x27;s Los Angeles studios.

In late March 2013, David Lloyd and Sage Steele, both of whom were previously co-anchored the weekend morning editions – moved to the weekday early-afternoon block (from 1:00 to 3:00 p.m. Eastern). The current daytime format, which was implemented that month, now features three teams of two anchors in two-hour shifts. On June 21, 2013, a large LED high definition monitor placed behind the main anchor desk was added to the main &quot;SportsCenter&quot; set in the network&#x27;s Bristol facility.

In February 2014, production of the weeknight 1:00 and 2:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) editions of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; was temporarily relocated back to Bristol, due to renovations being made at the network&#x27;s &quot;SportsCenter&quot; studio in Los Angeles. In addition, Neil Everett and Stan Verrett – both of whom had anchored &quot;SportsCenter&quot; from Los Angeles since 2009 – were moved back to the network&#x27;s headquarters, before both hosts and the program&#x27;s production returned to the then-newly renovated Los Angeles studio on June 23, 2014.

On June 22, 2014, &quot;SportsCenter&quot; began broadcasting from Studio X of ESPN&#x27;s new Digital Center 2 facility, which concurrently resulted in a major overhaul to the program&#x27;s production and on-air appearance. The new studio incorporates over 114 displays – including two touchscreens, large vertical screens, and a &quot;multidimensional&quot; video wall consisting of 56 monitors of varying sizes and positions that can be used to create pseudo-3D effects. The monitor displays can be used to show video content (such as highlights) and other relevant imagery (such as statistics), emphasizing the ability for anchors to present content on-set through means other than just through voiceovers. A new graphics package was also introduced, emphasizing a bolder, yet more simplified look – in both their appearance and the level of content. To coincide with the redesign of &quot;SportsCenter&quot;, a revised variant of ESPN&#x27;s BottomLine ticker was introduced to complement the new graphical design, using a dark grey color scheme. A downscaled replica of DC2&#x27;s set was constructed for broadcasts originating from ESPN&#x27;s Los Angeles studio.

On February 2 and 3, 2015, Lindsay Czarniak anchored the 6:00 p.m. (Eastern) edition of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; from ESPN&#x27;s Los Angeles facilities, due to a major snowstorm that hit the Northeastern United States the previous weekend, which also affected ESPN&#x27;s main facilities in Bristol. The previous week from January 26 to 30, Czarniak had co-anchored the 6:00 p.m. edition alongside John Anderson from the parking lot of the Scottsdale Fashion Square in Scottsdale, Arizona as part of the program&#x27;s coverage of Super Bowl XLIX. After that week, Anderson was moved back to the 11:00 p.m. broadcast, making Czarniak the solo anchor of the 6:00 p.m. editions on weeknights starting on February 2.

On September 7, 2015, Scott Van Pelt became the solo anchor of a revised 12:00 a.m. (Eastern) edition of the program, which is more freeform than other &quot;SportsCenter&quot; editions and promoted as &quot;SportsCenter at Night,&quot; or SC@Night for short. In addition to featuring highlights and discussion panels, it features Van Pelt&#x27;s analysis of sports events in a style similar to that conducted on his former radio talk show &quot;SVP and Russillo&quot;, during the replacement of Danny Kanell as the new co-host of Russillo Show alongside Ryen Russillo, and utilizes a modified version of the show&#x27;s theme (composed by Timbaland), as well as a different lighting and graphics set.

In October 2015, Ronda Rousey became the first female athlete to guest host on the show.

On February 8, 2016, &quot;SportsCenter&quot; moved its start time from 9:00 to 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time, with the launch of a new three hour morning block from 7:00 to 10:00 a.m., titled &quot;SportsCenter:AM&quot;, also branded &quot;SC:AM&quot;. Maintaining a faster-paced format, the program focuses on highlights from the previous night in the first hour, the top plays and moments of the previous night&#x27;s sporting events in the second hour, and the upcoming day in sports in the third hour. &quot;SportsCenter:AM&quot; also shares resources with &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and ESPN2/ESPN Radio&#x27;s &quot;Mike &amp; Mike&quot;.

On October 11, 2016, ESPN named &quot;His &amp; Hers&quot; co-hosts Jemele Hill and Michael Smith as co-anchors of the 6:00 p.m. ET edition of &quot;SportsCenter&quot;, effective February 6, 2017 (the day after Super Bowl LI). They replaced Lindsay Czarniak, who had been anchoring the 6:00 p.m. ET edition of the show since December 3, 2012.

On November 13, 2015, ESPN interrupted regular programming around 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time, to cover the immediate aftermath of the terror attacks on Stade de France and downtown Paris as well as the hostage situation in the Bataclan theatre, where a concert by American rock band Eagles of Death Metal was interrupted by terrorists who killed 89 people. ESPN FC correspondent Jonathan Johnson, as well as then French president François Hollande, were attending the game in the Stade de France, around which the three explosions occurred. While Hollande was evacuated from the stadium at half-time, Johnson remained in the stadium, and after the game he described to the viewers the panic of the fans who attended the game and then rushed the field, after being noticed by the Stade de France&#x27;s PA announcer. After the hostage crisis ended, a special edition of the program was aired, featuring analysis and reports on the impact that the Paris attacks had on the sports world and social media reactions of sportspeople to the attacks, announcing the postponements of some major European sporting events that had been announced up to that weekend.

On January 3, 2017, the 10:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. ET editions of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; moved from ESPN to ESPN2, effectively switching channels with the two-hour debate program &quot;First Take&quot;, which moved from ESPN2 to ESPN.

On February 6, 2017, the newly revamped 6:00 p.m. ET of &quot;SportsCenter&quot;, known as &quot;SC6&quot; &quot;with Michael/Jemele&quot; (pronounced &quot;SportsCenter at 6&quot;), debuted with Michael Smith and Jemele Hill as co-anchors. This new format featured some elements taken from Smith and Hill&#x27;s former show, &quot;His &amp; Hers&quot; and, like &quot;SportsCenter with SVP&quot;, was more freeform than other editions of &quot;SportsCenter&quot;. In addition, &quot;SC6&quot; focused on the night ahead in sports, as well as breaking sports news as warranted.

On April 26, 2017, &quot;SportsCenter&quot; anchors Jay Crawford, Chris Hassel, Jade McCarthy, Sara Walsh and Jaymee Sire (who had co-anchored &quot;SportsCenter:AM&quot; since its debut on February 8, 2016) were among the 100 staffers who were let go by ESPN.

Several notable changes were implemented for &quot;SportsCenter&quot; beginning on August 28, 2017. Sage Steele and Randy Scott replaced Sire (who was laid off four months earlier) and Kevin Negandhi as co-anchors for the weekday editions of &quot;SportsCenter:AM&quot; joining Jay Harris, while Matt Barrie and Elle Duncan co-anchor the weekend editions of &quot;SportsCenter:AM&quot; alongside Negandhi (who has since left that show to co-anchor the weeknight 6:00 p.m. ET editions of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; with Steele). In another notable change, the &quot;rundown&quot; graphic has been permanently removed after a decade and (with the exception of the midnight ET edition with Scott Van Pelt) it has now been replaced by a bug on the lower-left portion of the 16:9 screen. The bug now identifies specific editions of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; (such as &quot;SC:AM&quot;, &quot;SC@Night&quot; and so on).

ESPN debuted a brand new advertising campaign for &quot;SportsCenter&quot; which was created by Droga5 in late 2017. It was originally expected to replace the long-running This is SportsCenter advertising campaign as it would be discontinued. As of 2020, the latter advertising campaign (This is SportsCenter) is still being shown.

On November 29, 2017, within an announcement of 150 behind-the-scenes staff members being laid off, ESPN announced the end of the primetime &quot;SportsCenter&quot; editions airing on ESPNews as of November 30 (breaking sports news coverage will be maintained where needed).

Following Jemele Hill&#x27;s departure from &quot;SportsCenter&quot; for The Undefeated after the final &quot;SC6&quot; show on February 2, 2018, Michael Smith became the solo anchor of the 6:00 p.m. ET edition of &quot;SportsCenter&quot;, which itself reverted to that title on February 5; Smith himself departed from &quot;SportsCenter&quot; on March 9. As of March 1, 2021, the weeknight 6:00 p.m. ET editions of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; are now co-anchored by Kevin Neghandi and Elle Duncan, the latter of whom replaced Sage Steele (who in turn, moved to the noon ET edition).

With the debut of &quot;Get Up!&quot; on ESPN on April 2, 2018, &quot;SportsCenter:AM&quot; moved to ESPN2 (the first hour of the latter show has since moved back to ESPN), while &quot;Golic and Wingo&quot; moved to ESPNEWS. Consequently, the 10:00 a.m. ET edition of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; on ESPN2 was eliminated.

On September 6, 2019, in honor of the 40th anniversary of ESPN&#x27;s launch, Keith Olbermann and Dan Patrick made a surprise on-air reunion as guest hosts for the late-night edition, which featured tributes to their time at the network.

===2020s===
On March 11, 2020, the NBA announced that it would suspend the 2019–20 NBA season indefinitely following the conclusion of that night&#x27;s games as a result of Rudy Gobert testing positive for COVID-19 before a game between the Utah Jazz and the Oklahoma City Thunder at Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City, which caused the game to be initially postponed. The following day, all of the other major sports leagues followed suit in suspending their seasons for an indefinite period in order to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, and several major college basketball tournaments were also canceled after plans to initially play the games without an audience fell through. After the cancellations were announced, ESPN aired a special edition of the program chronicling the effects of the pandemic and its impact on sporting events and the athletes&#x27; reactions to the pandemic via social media.

As a result of the pandemic, ESPN significantly reduced the production of &quot;SportsCenter&quot;, which at the time aired live three times each weekday (noon, 6:00 and 11:00 p.m., all times Eastern) and twice each on Saturday and Sunday.

Beginning with the weekend of September 12, 2020, and also, the week of September 14, 2020, &quot;SportsCenter:AM&quot; returned to its regularly-scheduled daily 7:00 a.m. ET time slot. On weekdays, the first hour of the show is now aired on ESPN from 7–8 a.m. ET, with the remaining two hours on ESPN2 from 8–10 a.m. ET. On weekends, ESPN airs a two-hour block of the show from 7–9 a.m. ET.

On August 29, 2022, &quot;SportsCenter&quot; debuted a newly revamped Studio X, complete with a larger LED video wall, new LED monitors and a bigger news desk to accommodate in-studio guests. Studio X underwent a second revamp the following summer and on September 7, 2023 (coincidentally the 44th anniversary of ESPN&#x27;s launch), &quot;SportsCenter&quot; returned to the main news desk in the same studio, starting with that day&#x27;s inaugural 2pm ET edition (which replaced the noon ET edition; that time slot has since been filled by &quot;The Pat McAfee Show&quot;).

In April 2012, the ESPN America edition of the program was expanded to weekends, and moved to 8:00 a.m. WET (9:00 a.m. CET). At that time, a localized version of the program that was previously produced was discontinued and was replaced with an edited version of the 2:00 a.m. Eastern Time telecast from Los Angeles, recut to fit a 45-minute time block through the removal of commercial breaks and stories on European sports (such as soccer); the program began to be repeated at 8.45 a.m., 4:00 p.m. and 4.45 p.m. (WET).

=== &quot;ESPN Radio SportsCenter&quot; ===

=== &quot;SportsCenter AM&quot; ===
SportsCenter AM was a radio show on ESPN Radio hosted by &quot;ESPN Radio SportsCenter&quot; anchor Jay Reynolds. The show has been replaced by &quot;First and Last&quot; in July 2017. &quot;SportsCenter AM&quot; featured scores from all major sporting events including the NFL, NBA, NHL, and MLB. The show usually played audio highlights for last minute shots, game winning homers, and other exciting events from the previous day&#x27;s sporting events.

&quot;SportsCenter AM&quot; lasted one hour from 4:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m. ET, re-airing at 5:00 am ET. The show led into &quot;Mike and Mike in the Morning&quot;. It ran much like the &quot;SportsCenter&quot; program on ESPN television. Reynolds recapped scores and played audio highlights and earlier interviews from a variety of sports. No live interviews or call-ins took place during the hour. Bob Picozzi did one &quot;SportsCenter&quot; update at 4:30 a.m. A &quot;SportsCenter&quot; &quot;Express&quot;, hosted by Doug Brown, took place where the normal &quot;SportsCenter&quot; breaks would be, at 4:20 and 4:40 a.m.

=== TSN &quot;SportsCentre&quot; ===
&quot;SportsCentre&quot; is the daily sports news television program on TSN, the Canadian sports network in which ESPN is a minority owner. The title is rendered in Canadian spelling.

<text>Eye is a small village in the Eye, Moreton and Ashton civil parish of Herefordshire, England, and north from Leominster, north from the city and county town of Hereford, and in the catchment area of the River Lugg.

Eye has a small historic church with a square tower and effigies; beside it is Eye Manor, noted for its decorated plaster ceilings, and a village hall—the Cawley Hall—named after the local Cawley family.

At to the east, between the villages of Moreton and Ashton, is Berrington Hall, a Henry Holland house with Capability Brown landscape, which was built for Thomas Harley.

The Welsh Marches Line runs through the closed Berrington and Eye railway station, which previously served the village. The station opened on 6 December 1853 and closed on 9 June 1958.

Admiral James Vashon (1742 – 1827) was born here. In 2015 metal detectorists found a viking hoard worth £3 million in a field in the village but failed to report it as treasure.

<doc id="157873" wikidata="Q50608" url="?curid=157873" title="Trent Lott">
<text>Chester Trent Lott Sr. (born October 9, 1941) is an American lobbyist, lawyer, author, and politician who represented Mississippi in the United States House of Representatives from 1973 to 1989 and in the United States Senate from 1989 to 2007. Lott served in numerous leadership positions in both chambers of Congress as one of the first of a wave of Republicans winning seats in Southern states that had been solidly Democratic. Later in his career, he served twice as Senate Majority Leader, and also, alternately, Senate Minority Leader. In 2003, he stepped down from the position after controversy due to his praising of Senator Strom Thurmond&#x27;s 1948 segregationist Dixiecrat presidential bid.

From 1968 to 1972, Lott was an administrative assistant to Representative William M. Colmer of Mississippi, who was also the chairman of the House Rules Committee. Upon Colmer&#x27;s retirement, Lott won Colmer&#x27;s former seat in the House of Representatives. In 1988, Lott ran successfully for the U.S. Senate to replace another retiree, John C. Stennis. After Republicans took the majority in the Senate, Lott became Senate Majority Whip in 1995 and then Senate Majority Leader in 1996, upon the resignation of presidential nominee Bob Dole of Kansas. Following GOP losses in the 2000 Senate races that resulted in a 50–50 split, Lott briefly became Senate Minority Leader, as Democrat Al Gore was still Vice President and President of the Senate at the beginning of the new term on January 3, 2001. Seventeen days later, Lott was restored as Senate Majority Leader after Republicans regained control of the chamber upon the inauguration of the new vice president, Dick Cheney, on January 20. Lott was Senate Majority Leader until June 6, 2001, when Vermont Senator Jim Jeffords changed his party affiliation from Republican to Independent, and caucused with the Senate Democrats for the remainder of his term. Thereafter, Lott again served as Senate Minority Leader.

Following Republican gains in the 2002 midterm elections, Lott was slated to again become Majority Leader when the next Senate session began in January 2003. However, on December 20, 2002, after significant controversy following comments he made regarding Strom Thurmond&#x27;s presidential candidacy, Lott resigned as Senate Minority Leader.

Though no longer in leadership, Lott remained in the Senate until resigning in 2007. Fellow Republican Roger Wicker won the 2008 special election to replace him. Lott became a lobbyist, co-founding the Breaux–Lott Leadership Group. The firm was later acquired by law and lobbying firm Patton Boggs. Lott serves as a Senior Fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC), where he focuses on issues related to energy, national security, transportation and congressional reforms. Lott is also a co-chair of BPC&#x27;s Energy Project. In June 2020 Lott was fired from the Washington law and lobbying firm Squire Patton Boggs while negotiating to join another firm. Days later on June 15, 2020, Lott joined Crossroads Strategies along with his longtime colleague John Breaux.

==Early life==
Lott was born in Grenada, Mississippi, and lived his early years in nearby Duck Hill, where his father, Chester Paul Lott, sharecropped a stretch of cotton field. Lott&#x27;s mother, the former Iona Watson, was a schoolteacher. Lott&#x27;s father was a philanderer with a drinking problem, and Lott frequently acted as a mediator when his mother threatened his father with divorce. When Lott was in the sixth grade, the family moved to Pascagoula, where Lott&#x27;s father worked at a shipyard.

Lott attended college at the University of Mississippi in Oxford, where he obtained an undergraduate degree in public administration in 1963 and a Juris doctor degree in 1967. He served as a field representative for Ole Miss and was president of his fraternity, Sigma Nu. Lott was also an Ole Miss cheerleader, on the same team with future U.S. Senator Thad Cochran. At the time that Lott was president, the Sigma Nu fraternity house was raided by the troops from the 716th Battalion during the &quot;Battle of Oxford&quot;. They discovered a sizeable weapon cache.

Regarding his education, the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; from 1999 quotes Senator Lott declaring: &quot;I am a product of public education from the first grade through the second, third, and fourth grades where I went to school at Duck Hill, Mississippi, and I had better teachers in the second, third, and fourth grades in Duck Hill, Mississippi, than I had the rest of my life.&quot;

While an undergraduate at the University of Mississippi, Lott participated in the effort at the 1964 national convention of the Sigma Nu fraternity to oppose a civil rights amendment proposed by the Dartmouth College and Duke University chapters to end mandatory racial exclusion by the fraternity. Lott sided with the segregationists who defeated the amendment. The Dartmouth chapter subsequently seceded from the fraternity, and Sigma Nu remained whites-only until later in the decade.

==Political career==

===House of Representatives===
 
Lott served as administrative assistant to House Rules Committee chairman William M. Colmer, also of Pascagoula, from 1968 to 1972.

In 1972, Colmer, one of the most conservative Democrats in the House, announced his retirement after 40 years in Congress. He endorsed Lott as his successor in Mississippi&#x27;s 5th District, located in the state&#x27;s southern tip, even though Lott ran as a Republican. Lott won handily, in large part due to Richard Nixon&#x27;s landslide victory in that year&#x27;s presidential election. Nixon won the 5th district with an astonishing 87 percent of the vote; it was his strongest congressional district in the entire nation.

Lott and his future Senate colleague, Thad Cochran (also elected to Congress that year), were only the second and third Republicans elected to Congress from Mississippi since Reconstruction (Prentiss Walker was the first in 1964). Lott&#x27;s strong showing in the polls landed him on the powerful House Judiciary Committee as a freshman, where he voted against all three articles of impeachment drawn up against Nixon during the committee&#x27;s debate. After Nixon released the infamous &quot;smoking gun&quot; transcripts (which proved Nixon&#x27;s involvement in the Watergate cover-up), however, Lott announced that he would vote to impeach Nixon when the articles came up for debate before the full House (as did the other Republicans who voted against impeachment in committee).

Lott became very popular in his district, even though almost none of its living residents had been represented by a Republican before. As evidence, in November 1974, Lott won a second term in a blowout. Cochran was also reelected in a rout; he and Lott were the first Republicans to win a second term in Congress from the state since Reconstruction. They were among the few bright spots in a year that saw many Republicans turned out of office due to anger over Watergate. Lott was re-elected six more times without much difficulty, and even ran unopposed in 1978. However, conservative Democrats continued to hold most of the region&#x27;s seats in the state legislature, as well as most local offices, well into the 2000s.

In 1980, he served as Ronald Reagan&#x27;s Mississippi state chairman. He served as House Minority Whip (the second-ranking Republican in the House) from 1981 to 1989; he was the first Southern Republican to hold such a high leadership position.

===United States Senate===

Lott ran for the Senate in 1988, after 42-year incumbent John Stennis announced he would not run for another term. He defeated Democratic 4th District Congressman Wayne Dowdy by almost eight points. Lott won by running up a 70 percent margin in his congressional district, and was also helped by George H. W. Bush easily carrying the state in the presidential election. He never faced another contest nearly that close. He was re-elected in 1994, 2000, and 2006 with no substantive Democratic opposition. He gave some thought to retirement for much of 2005, however, after Hurricane Katrina, he announced on January 17, 2006, that he would run for a fourth term.

In 1989, on the 25th anniversary of the murder of the civil rights activists James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner, Lott and the rest of the Mississippi congressional delegation refused to vote for the non-binding resolution honoring the three men which nevertheless passed the Congress.

He became Senate Majority Whip when the Republicans took control of the Senate in 1995. In June 1996, he ran for the post of Senate Majority Leader to succeed Republican Bob Dole, who had resigned from the Senate to concentrate on his presidential campaign. Lott faced his Mississippi colleague Thad Cochran, the then-Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference. Cochran cast himself as an &quot;institutionalist&quot; and who would help to rebuild public trust in Congress through compromise over conflict. Lott promised a &quot;more aggressive&quot; style of leadership and courted the younger Senate conservatives. Lott won by 44 votes to 8. As majority leader, Lott had a major role in the Senate trial following the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. After the House narrowly voted to impeach Clinton, Lott proceeded with the Senate trial in early 1999, despite criticisms that Republicans were far short of the two-thirds majority required under the Constitution to convict Clinton and remove him from office.

Lott generally pursued a conservative position in politics and was a noted social conservative. For instance, in 1998, Lott caused some controversy in Congress when as a guest on the Armstrong Williams television show, he equated homosexuality with alcoholism, kleptomania and sex addiction. When Williams, a conservative talk show host, asked Lott whether homosexuality is a sin, Lott simply replied, &quot;Yes, it is.&quot; Lott&#x27;s stance against homosexuality was disconcerting to liberal Democratic Party elected officials and the Human Rights Campaign Fund, an advocacy group for gay rights.

According to the Anti-Defamation League, Lott was a frequent speaker at the white supremacist group Council of Conservative Citizens. Although he denied knowing of the group&#x27;s intentions, it was later revealed members of his family had CCC membership.

After the 2000 elections produced a 50–50 partisan split in the Senate, Vice President Al Gore&#x27;s tie-breaking vote gave the Democrats the majority from January 3 to 20, 2001, when George W. Bush took office and Vice President Dick Cheney&#x27;s tie-breaking vote gave the Republicans the majority once again. Later in 2001, he became Senate Minority Leader again after Vermont senator Jim Jeffords became an independent and caucused with the Democrats, allowing them to regain the majority. He was due to become majority leader again in early 2003 after Republican gains in the November 2002 elections.

====Resignation from Senate leadership====
Lott spoke on December 5, 2002, at the 100th birthday party of Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, a retiring Republican senator who had switched parties from the Democrats decades earlier. Thurmond had run for President of the United States in 1948 on the Dixiecrat (or States&#x27; Rights Democratic) ticket. Lott said: &quot;When Strom Thurmond ran for president, we voted for him. We&#x27;re proud of it. And if the rest of the country had followed our lead, we wouldn&#x27;t have had all these problems over the years, either.&quot;

As a senator and presidential candidate, Thurmond maintained an explicit States&#x27; Rights platform that challenged the Civil Rights Movement and later, the Civil Rights Act as illegally overturning the separation of powers under the United States Constitution and called for the preservation of racial segregation. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Lott had made similar comments about Thurmond&#x27;s candidacy in a 1980 rally. Lott gave an interview to BET explaining himself and repudiating Thurmond&#x27;s former views.

In the wake of the controversy, Lott resigned as Senate Republican Leader on December 20, 2002, effective at the start of the next session, January 3, 2003. Bill Frist of Tennessee was later elected to the leadership position. In the book &quot;Free Culture&quot;, Lawrence Lessig argues that Lott&#x27;s resignation would not have occurred had it not been for the effect of Internet blogs. He says that though the story &quot;disappear[ed] from the mainstream press within forty-eight hours&quot;, &quot;bloggers kept researching the story&quot; until, &quot;finally, the story broke back into the mainstream press.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot;, however, attributed his resignation to &quot;ruthless maneuvering&quot; by Karl Rove and George W. Bush to depose Lott, &quot;a threat to the president’s agenda&quot;, and replace him with Frist, who had &quot;long been the president&#x27;s choice.&quot;
After losing the Majority Leader post, Lott was less visible on the national scene, although he did break with some standard conservative positions. He battled with Bush over military base closures in his home state. He showed support for passenger rail initiatives, notably his 2006 bipartisan introduction, with Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, of legislation to provide 80 percent federal matching grants to intercity rail and guarantee adequate funding for Amtrak. On July 18, 2006, Lott voted with 19 Republican senators for the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act to lift restrictions on federal funding for the research. On November 15, 2006, Lott regained a leadership position in the Senate, when he was named Minority Whip after defeating Lamar Alexander of Tennessee 25–24.

Senator John E. Sununu (R) of New Hampshire said, after Lott&#x27;s election as Senate Minority Whip, &quot;He understands the rules. He&#x27;s a strong negotiator.&quot; Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R) said he&#x27;s &quot;the smartest legislative politician I&#x27;ve ever met.&quot;

==== 2006 re-election campaign ====

Lott faced no Republican opposition in his primary race. State representative Erik R. Fleming placed first of four candidates in the June Democratic primary, but did not receive the 50 percent of the vote required to earn the party&#x27;s nomination. Fleming and the second-place finisher, business consultant Bill Bowlin, faced off in a runoff on June 27, which Fleming won with 65% of the vote. Fleming criticized Lott for not doing enough to alleviate poverty in &quot;the poorest state in the nation.&quot; Fleming&#x27;s bid was viewed as a longshot, and Lott handily defeated him with 64% of the vote in November.

==== Resignation ====
On November 26, 2007, Lott announced that he would resign his Senate seat by the end of 2007. According to CNN, his resignation was at least partly due to the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, which forbade lawmakers from lobbying for two years after leaving office. Those who left by the end of 2007 were covered by the previous law, which he cosponsored and which required a wait of only one year. In an interview regarding his resignation, Lott said that the new law &quot;didn&#x27;t have a big role&quot; in his decision to resign.

Lott&#x27;s resignation became effective at 11:30 p.m. on December 18, 2007. On January 7, 2008, it was announced that Lott and former Senator John Breaux of Louisiana, a Democrat, opened their lobbying firm about a block from the White House.

== Post-Senate career ==

In January 2008, he co-founded the Breaux-Lott Leadership Group, a &quot;strategic advice, consulting, and lobbying&quot; firm together with former Louisiana Senator John Breaux. The firm was later acquired by law and lobbying firm Patton Boggs, now Squire Patton Boggs following the June 2014 merger with Squire Sanders. In September 2014, lobbyist filings revealed that Lott was contracted to advocate on behalf of Gazprombank, a Russian majority state-owned bank targeted with sanctions over the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine. Lott was fired by Squire Patton Boggs in June 2020; no explanation was initially provided for his departure. The firm later said Lott was removed because of the anti-racism 2020 protests, though Lott was already in negotiations to leave the firm. Lott joined lobbying firm Crossroad Strategies; John Breaux joined shortly after leaving Squire Patton Boggs. Lott also served on the EADS North America (now known as Airbus) board of directors.

On February 14, 2009, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported the indictment of Judge Bobby DeLaughter for taking bribes from Richard Scruggs, Lott&#x27;s brother-in-law. Scruggs represented Lott in litigation against State Farm Insurance company after the insurer refused to pay claims for the loss of his Mississippi home in Hurricane Katrina. According to &quot;The New York Times,&quot; federal prosecutors have said that Lott was induced by Scruggs to offer DeLaughter a federal judgeship in order to gain the judge&#x27;s favor. In 2012, Lott testified in federal court that he never told DeLaughter that he would be recommended for a federal judgeship.

For the 2016 presidential election, Lott served as a national co-chair for John Kasich, before shifting his support to Donald Trump&#x27;s campaign once he became the nominee.

In 2018 Sacha Baron Cohen&#x27;s television program &quot;Who Is America?&quot; premiered showing Lott supporting the &quot;kinderguardians program&quot; which supported training toddlers with firearms. Lott appeared not to know it was a hoax.

Lott has been named an Honorary Patron of the University Philosophical Society, Trinity College, Dublin. Lott is on the Board of Selectors of Jefferson Awards for Public Service.

===Memoir===
Lott&#x27;s memoir, entitled &quot;Herding Cats: A Life in Politics&quot;, was published in 2005. In the book, Lott spoke about the remark he made at the Strom Thurmond birthday party, former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, and his feelings of betrayal toward the Tennessee senator, claiming &quot;If Frist had not announced exactly when he did, as the fire was about to burn out, I would still be majority leader of the Senate today.&quot; He also described former Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota as &quot;trustworthy&quot;. He also revealed that President George W. Bush, then–Secretary of State Colin Powell, and other GOP leaders played a major role in ending his career as Senate Republican Leader.

== Personal life ==
Lott married Patricia Thompson on December 27, 1964. The couple has two children: Chester Trent &quot;Chet&quot; Lott Jr., and Tyler Lott.

Lott is a Freemason, and holds the Grand Cross in the Southern Jurisdiction of the United States in the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite.

In April 2007, Lott reached a confidential settlement with the State Farm insurance company after suing State Farm for fraud. Lott lost his Mississippi home due to Hurricane Katrina, and State Farm declined to pay an insurance claim after ruling the home had water damage.

==Legacy==
Trent Lott Academy in the Pascagoula School District is named after him. Lott is also the namesake of Trent Lott International Airport in Moss Point, Mississippi. The character of Lott Dod, a Neimoidian senator of the Trade Federation from the film &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; is named after him.

The Trent Lott Leadership Institute is named after him, located at his alma mater, the University of Mississippi.

<doc id="157877" wikidata="Q5018821" url="?curid=157877" title="Calcium deficiency (plant disorder)">
<text>Calcium (Ca) deficiency is a plant disorder that can be caused by insufficient level of biologically available calcium in the growing medium, but is more frequently a product of low transpiration of the whole plant or more commonly the affected tissue. Plants are susceptible to such localized calcium deficiencies in low or non-transpiring tissues because calcium is not transported in the phloem. This may be due to water shortages, which slow the transportation of calcium to the plant, poor uptake of calcium through the stem, or too much nitrogen in the soil.

==Causes==
Acidic, sandy, or coarse soils often contain less calcium. Uneven soil moisture and overuse of fertilizers can also cause calcium deficiency. At times, even with sufficient calcium in the soil, it can be in an insoluble form and is then unusable by the plant or it could be attributed to a &quot;transport protein&quot;. Soils containing high phosphorus are particularly susceptible to creating insoluble forms of calcium.

Calcium and magnesium are opposed within the plant cells, and have antagonistic interactions. As a result, a homeostatic balance between Ca and Mg within the plant is necessary for optimal growth and proper development.

==Symptoms==

Calcium deficiency symptoms appear initially as localized tissue necrosis leading to stunted plant growth, necrotic leaf margins on young leaves or curling of the leaves, and eventual death of terminal buds and root tips. Generally, the new growth and rapidly growing tissues of the plant are affected first. The mature leaves are rarely if ever affected because calcium accumulates to high concentrations in older leaves. Calcium deficiencies in plants are associated with reduced height, fewer nodes, and less leaf area.

Crop-specific symptoms include:

; Apple : &#x27;Bitter pit&#x27; – fruit skins develop pits, brown spots appear on skin and/or in flesh and taste of those areas is bitter. This usually occurs when fruit is in storage, and Bramley apples are particularly susceptible. Related to boron deficiency, &quot;water cored&quot; apples seldom display bitter pit effects.
; Cabbage, lettuce and brussels sprouts :There is some evidence that plants like lettuce are more likely to experience tipburn (burned edges of leaves) if they&#x27;re experiencing a deficiency of calcium. 
; Carrot : &#x27;Cavity spot&#x27; – oval spots develop into craters which may be invaded by other disease-causing organisms.
; Celery : Stunted growth, central leaves stunted.
; Tomatoes and peppers:&#x27;Blossom end rot&#x27; – Symptoms start as sunken, dry decaying areas at the blossom end of the fruit, furthest away from the stem, not all fruit on a truss is necessarily affected. Sometimes rapid growth from high-nitrogen fertilizers may exacerbate blossom end rot. Water management and preventing water stress is key to minimizing its occurrence. Although it was once common knowledge that blossom end rot was caused by calcium deficiencies, there are also other proposed causes.

==Treatment==

Calcium deficiency can sometimes be rectified by adding agricultural lime to acid soils, aiming at a pH of 6.5, unless the subject plants specifically prefer acidic soil. Organic matter should be added to the soil to improve its moisture-retaining capacity. However, because of the nature of the disorder (i.e. poor transport of calcium to low transpiring tissues), the problem cannot generally be cured by the addition of calcium to the roots. In some species, the problem can be reduced by prophylactic spraying with calcium chloride of tissues at risk.

Plant damage is difficult to reverse, so corrective action should be taken immediately, supplemental applications of calcium nitrate at 200 ppm nitrogen, for example. Soil pH should be tested, and corrected if needed, because calcium deficiency is often associated with low pH.

Early fruit will generally have the worst symptoms, with them typically lessening as the season progresses. Preventative measures, such as irrigating prior to especially high temperatures and stable irrigation will minimize the occurrence.

<doc id="157879" wikidata="Q6072950" url="?curid=157879" title="Iron deficiency (plant disorder)">
<text>Iron (Fe) deficiency is a plant disorder also known as &quot;lime-induced chlorosis&quot;. It can be confused with manganese deficiency. If soil iron concentration is high, in spite of this it can become unavailable for absorption if soil pH is higher than 6.5. Excess of elements such as manganese in the soil can interfere with plant iron uptake triggering iron deficiency.

Iron is needed to produce chlorophyll, hence its deficiency causes chlorosis. For example, iron is used in the active site of glutamyl-tRNA reductase, an enzyme needed for the formation of 5-Aminolevulinic acid which is a precursor of heme and chlorophyll.

== Symptoms ==

Yellowing (Chlorosis) occur in the newly emerging leaves instead of the older leaves and usually seen in the interveinal region. Fruit would be of poor quality and quantity. Chlorosis occurs in younger leaves because iron is not a mobile element, and as such, the younger leaves cannot draw iron from other areas of the plant. Over time, the yellowing may even turn a pale white or the whole leaf may be affected. Iron deficient plants may overaccumulate heavy metals such as cadmium. Any plant may be affected, but raspberries and pears are particularly susceptible, as well as most acid-loving plants such as azaleas and camellias.

== Treatment ==

Iron deficiency can be avoided by choosing appropriate soil for the growing conditions (e.g., avoid growing acid loving plants on lime soils), or by adding well-rotted manure or compost. If iron deficit chlorosis is suspected then check the pH of the soil with an appropriate test kit or instrument. Take a soil sample at surface and at depth. If the pH is over seven then consider soil remediation that will lower the pH toward the 6.5 - 7 range. Remediation includes: i) adding compost, manure, peat or similar organic matter (warning. Some retail blends of manure and compost have pH in the range 7 - 8 because of added lime. Read the MSDS if available.) ii) applying Ammonium Sulphate as a Nitrogen fertilizer (acidifying fertilizer due to decomposition of ammonium ion to nitrate in the soil and root zone) iii) applying elemental Sulphur to the soil (oxidizes over the course of months to produce sulphate/sulphite and lower pH). Note: adding acid directly e.g. sulphuric/hydrochloric/citric acid is dangerous as you may mobilize metal ions in the soil that are toxic and otherwise bound. Iron can be made available immediately to the plant by the use of iron sulphate or iron chelate compounds. Two common iron chelates are Fe EDTA and Fe EDDHA. Iron sulphate (Iron(II) sulfate) and iron EDTA are only useful in soil up to PH 7.1 but they can be used as a foliar spray (Foliar feeding). Iron EDDHA is useful up to PH 9 (highly alkaline) but must be applied to the soil and in the evening to avoid photodegradation. EDTA in the soil may mobilize Lead, EDDHA does not appear to.

<doc id="157880" wikidata="Q1130353" url="?curid=157880" title="Boeremag">
<text>The Boeremag (, &quot;Boer Power&quot;) was a far-right white supremacist terrorist organisation in South Africa. The South African government described them as a South African right-wing terrorist organization with white separatist aims. The Boeremag were accused of planning to overthrow the ruling African National Congress government and to reinstate a new Boer-administered republic reminiscent of the era when Boers administered independent republics during the 19th century after the Great Trek.

South African law-enforcement officials charged the Boeremag for being responsible for the 2002 Soweto bombings and arrested twenty-six men, alleged to be members of the Boeremag, in November and December 2002, reportedly seizing over 1,000 kilograms of explosives in the process. Further arrests followed in March 2003.

The first trial of Boeremag suspects began under tight security in Pretoria during May 2003. Twenty-two men were charged with forty-two counts of treason, murder, and illegal weapons possession. Six pleaded not guilty, two did not enter pleas, one refused to plead, and thirteen challenged the court&#x27;s jurisdiction, alleging that the post-apartheid constitution and government of South Africa are illegitimate. During the trial plans to blow up South African actor Casper de Vries together with eight other individuals were revealed. The group is quoted as saying that the reason for this plan was because De Vries &quot;was not on the right path&quot;.

In October 2004 the Pretoria High Court heard testimony from a witness, Deon Crous, who stated under oath that he had assisted two of the accused, Kobus Pretorius and Jacques Jordaan, to manufacture 1500 kg of explosives. Crous testified that five amounts of 300 kg were reserved for five separate bombs. One of the planned bomb attacks was cancelled as there was too high a risk of white civilians being injured. The bombs were to be detonated on December 13, 2002, with various attacks planned to follow the bombings.

In early May 2006 Herman van Rooyen and Rudi Gouws, two of the leading members being tried, escaped from custody. The two men were recaptured on 20 January 2007.

In late October 2013, Mike du Toit, the ringleader of a plot to assassinate Nelson Mandela and expel Black people out of South Africa, was convicted of treason and sentenced to 35 years in prison. Twenty other members of Boeremag were also sentenced to prison terms of between five and 35 years. Herman van Rooyen and Rudi Gouws, two of the co-conspirators of Du Toit, were given longer sentences of 25 years imprisonment for their role in planting bombs in their attempt to assassinate Nelson Mandela.

These men have been imprisoned since 2002. The trial lasted 11 years.

<doc id="157881" wikidata="Q200547" url="?curid=157881" title="Counties of Sweden">
<text>The counties of Sweden () are the first-level administrative subdivisions of Sweden. There are twenty-one counties; however, the number of counties has varied over time, due to territorial changes and to divisions or mergers of existing counties.

They are &quot;not&quot; regarded as geographical areas by Swedes as they are not connected to dialects or identity, which is a role fulfilled by the historical provinces of Sweden (). This level of administrative unit was first established in the 1634 Instrument of Government on Lord Chancellor Count Axel Oxenstierna&#x27;s initiative, and superseded the landskap, in order to introduce a more efficient administration of the realm. At that time, they were what the translation of &quot;län&quot; into English literally means: fiefdoms. The county borders often follow the provincial borders, but the Crown often chose to make slight relocations to suit its purposes.

In every county there is a county administrative board (&quot;länsstyrelse&quot;) headed by a governor (&quot;landshövding&quot;), appointed by the government, as well as a separate regional council (&quot;region&quot;). In the county of Gotland however, the county&#x27;s only municipality has adopted regional responsibilities. The aims of the county administrative board are to supervise local state administration (that is not otherwise assigned to other government agencies), and to coordinate political goals with the central government. The regional council is the elected regional political assembly that oversees the municipal affairs of the county, primarily in regard to public healthcare, public transport, and culture.

Beginning in the 2000s, many major government agencies have reorganised from a county-based subdivisional structure into larger geographical or functional areas. This include the Swedish Tax Agency (1 January 2004), the Swedish Social Insurance Agency (1 January 2005), the Swedish Public Employment Service (1 January 2008), and the Swedish Police Authority (1 January 2015).

Each county region contains a number of municipalities (), the existence of which is partly at the discretion of the central government. Since 2004 their number has been 290, thus an average of 13.8 municipalities per county.

Until 1968, the City of Stockholm had its own &quot;county code&quot; A, which is still used interchangeably with AB in some contexts, and County of Stockholm had county code B. L was for Kristianstad County and M was for Malmöhus County but since they were merged to form Skåne County, M is usually used. O used to stand for Gothenburg and Bohus County but has been used for Västra Götaland County since it was merged with Skaraborg County (R) and Älvsborg County (P).

== History ==
=== Older subdivisions ===
Sweden&#x27;s provinces, or &quot;landskap&quot;, and the &quot;lands&quot;, or &quot;landsdelar&quot;, lack political importance today but are common denominations culturally and historically. The provinces had their own laws and justice systems and could have large cultural and religious differences. The province of Småland (literally &quot;small land&quot;) historically was several provinces with its own laws. Here burial tradition in the era before the Viking Age could differ significantly from province to province. The province of Norrbotten is a relatively recent creation; it was part of Västerbotten which extended all the way to Österbotten in today&#x27;s Finland before 1809. Finnish and Swedish Lappland was also one province until 1809.

Historically, the provinces were grouped in three lands: Götaland, being southern and western Sweden; Svealand being eastern and south-eastern, and Norrland being the entire northern half. The names of the first two refer to ancient tribes, and the third is a geographical reference. They are still commonly used as geographical references. The boundaries have changed over time, with the most significant in 1658 (the cession of provinces from Denmark-Norway to Sweden) and 1812 (due to the loss of Finland to Russia in 1809). In 1812, some provinces were moved from Götaland to Svealand.

=== Finland ===
After the Finnish War, Sweden was forced to cede the counties in Finland to Russia following the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in (1809). However, the counties were upheld in Finland until a reform in 1997. They are still in use in Sweden, 370 years later.

The counties in Finland established in 1634 were: Turku and Pori County, Nyland and Tavastehus County, Viborg and Nyslott County, Ostrobothnia County and Kexholm County. Over time the number of subdivisions in Finland increased to twelve, until a reorganization in 1997 reduced their number to six provinces, while keeping the administrative model intact. The counties in Finland were abolished in 2010.

=== Abolished counties ===
Abolished counties in current-day Sweden proper were:

* Skaraborg County + Gothenburg and Bohus County + Älvsborg County (merged as Västra Götaland County in 1998)
* Kopparberg County (became Dalarna County in 1997)

== Proposed regions ==

Under the aegis of the Swedish government, &quot;Ansvarskommittén&quot; has been investigating the possibilities of merging the current 21 counties into 6 to 9 larger regions. These proposals are from their final report, delivered in 2007:
# &quot;Norra Sverige&quot;: Norrbotten County + Västerbotten County + Jämtland County + Västernorrland County + Nordanstig and Hudiksvall
# &quot;Bergslagen&quot;: the rest of Gävleborg County + Dalarna County + Örebro County + Värmland County
# &quot;Mälardalen&quot;: Stockholm County + Uppsala County + Södermanland County + Västmanland County + Gotland County
# &quot;Västra Götaland&quot;: Västra Götaland County + Halland County
# &quot;Östra Götaland&quot;: Östergötland County + Jönköping County + Kronoberg County + Kalmar County
# &quot;Södra Götaland&quot;: Skåne County + Blekinge County

# &quot;Norra Sverige&quot;: Norrbotten County + Västerbotten County + Örnsköldsvik
# &quot;Mellannorrland&quot;: Jämtland County + Västernorrland County (except Örnsköldsvik) + Nordanstig and Hudiksvall
# &quot;Dalarna-Gävleborg&quot;: Dalarna County + Gävleborg County (except Nordanstig and Hudiksvall)
# &quot;Västra Svealand&quot;: Värmland County + Örebro County
# &quot;Mälardalen&quot;: Stockholm County + Uppsala County + Södermanland County + Västmanland County + Gotland County
# &quot;Västra Götaland&quot;: Västra Götaland County + Halland County
# &quot;Östergötland&quot;: Östergötland County + Västervik
# &quot;Småland&quot;: Jönköping County + Kronoberg County + Kalmar County (except Västervik)
# &quot;Södra Götaland&quot;: Skåne County + Blekinge County
A model for this comes from the merger of some counties into Skåne County and Västra Götaland County in 1997 and 1998, respectively, which is now considered a success.

The counties are discussing the proposal. An obstacle is that Stockholm County does not want to merge with any other county, while its neighbours want to merge with Stockholm.
After this discussion the following proposal has in 2016 emerged:
# Norrbotten, Västerbotten, Västernorrland and Jämtland county
# Dalarna, Gävleborgs, Södermanlands, Uppsala, Västmanland and Örebro county
# Östergötland, Jönköping, Kalmar and Kronoberg county
# Gotland and Stockholm county
# Halland, Värmland and Västra Götaland county
# Blekinge and Skåne county
The main difference is that the proposed Bergslagen is divided to other counties, and Stockholm is on its own (plus the small Gotland which has air connections to Stockholm)

== Riksområden ==
The counties in Sweden correspond to the third level of division in the European Union&#x27;s system of Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics. For the purpose of creating regions corresponding to the second level, counties have been grouped into eight , or &quot;National Areas&quot;: Stockholm, East Middle Sweden, North Middle Sweden, Middle Norrland, Upper Norrland, Småland and the islands, West Sweden and South Sweden.

<text>Eye is a village in the unitary authority area of Peterborough, in the ceremonial county of Cambridgeshire, England. The village is west of Thorney and south of Crowland, both known for their historic abbeys. The hamlet of Eye Green is immediately to the north, separated by the A47 trunk road.

==History==
According to &quot;A Dictionary of British Place Names&quot;, Eye derives from the Old English &quot;ēg&quot;, meaning a place at &quot;the island or well-watered land, or dry ground in marsh&quot;. In the 10th century, this particular Eye was spelt &quot;Ege&quot;.

There has been a chapel at Eye since at least 1543. The present church, dedicated to Saint Matthew, was built by George Basevi in 1846. The broach spire added 10 years later was removed for safety reasons in the early 1980s and the steeple now has a saddleback roof. Adjoining the southeast corner of the churchyard on Back Lane stands the former village fire station dating from 1826, when it housed a Merryweather fire engine. Closed after 1945, it was repaired by the parish council in 2011.

Eye Cornmill was an eight-storey windmill with eight sails from the church. The village previously had a brick pit (a quarry for clay for making bricks). Northolme in Crowland Road was the site of the brickworks social club. When this closed, the buildings and pit were taken over by the British Sub-Aqua Club and run as a national dive site. The buildings were later demolished and it is now a nature reserve.

Eye Green railway station (originally named Eye) on the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway line between Peterborough and Wisbech was opened in 1866 and closed in 1957. Eye war memorial, carved in granite, was erected at Crowland Road cemetery in 1920. It is dedicated to forty-one killed in the First World War, with fourteen Second World War deaths added later. The memorial was Grade II-listed in 2016.

Eye was part of the Soke of Peterborough in Northamptonshire until 1965, when it became part of the short-lived county of Huntingdon and Peterborough. From 1974, it has formed part of the City of Peterborough in Cambridgeshire. The Eye, Thorney and Newborough ward, comprising or , was formed in 2016; it elects three councillors.

The three-mile £7m A47 Eye bypass opened in October 1991. In recent decades Eye has seen expansion due to the growing demand for property seen throughout the UK. However, this generated much resistance from residents as a result of the rapid rate of expansion. Between the years of 2001-2011 the population grew from under 3,900 to over 4,400.

==Community facilities==
Local facilities include a GP surgery, a dentist&#x27;s surgery, a library, a community centre, a care home, a household recycling centre, a cemetery and a skate park. There are shops and restaurants in the village. There is a Church of England primary school on Eyebury Road.

<doc id="157884" wikidata="Q6748783" url="?curid=157884" title="Manganese deficiency (plant)">
<text>Manganese (Mn) deficiency is a plant disorder that is often confused with, and occurs with, iron deficiency. Most common in poorly drained soils, also where organic matter levels are high. Manganese may be unavailable to plants where pH is high. 

Affected plants include onion, apple, peas, French beans, cherry and raspberry, and symptoms include yellowing of leaves with smallest leaf veins remaining green to produce a ‘chequered’ effect. The plant may seem to grow away from the problem so that younger
leaves may appear to be unaffected. Brown spots may appear on leaf surfaces, and severely affected leaves turn brown and wither.

== Symptoms ==
Manganese deficiency can be easy to spot in plants because, much like Magnesium deficiency (agriculture), the leaves start to turn yellow and undergo interveinal chlorosis. The difference between these two is that the younger leaves near the top of the plant show symptoms first because manganese is not mobile while in magnesium deficiency show symptoms in older leaves near the bottom of the plant.

== Treatment ==
Manganese deficiency is easy to cure and homeowners have several options when treating these symptoms. The first is to adjust the soil pH. Two materials commonly used for lowering the soil pH are ammonium sulfate and sulfur. Ammonium sulfate will change the soil pH instantly because the ammonium produces the acidity as soon as it dissolves in the soil. Sulfur, however, requires some time for the conversion to sulfuric acid by soil bacteria. If the soil pH is not a problem and there is no manganese in the soil then Foliar feeding for small plants and Medicaps for large trees are both common ways for homeowners to get manganese into the plant.

To mitigate issues with manganese deficiency, Manganese oxide and sulfate are components of fertilizers. In the year 2000, an estimated 20,000 tons of these compounds were used in fertilizers in the US alone.

<doc id="157885" wikidata="Q923534" url="?curid=157885" title="Nitrogen deficiency">
<text>Nitrogen deficiency is a deficiency of nitrogen in plants. This can occur when organic matter with high carbon content, such as sawdust, is added to soil. Soil organisms use any nitrogen available to break down carbon sources, making nitrogen unavailable to plants. This is known as &quot;robbing&quot; the soil of nitrogen. All vegetables apart from nitrogen-fixing legumes are prone to this disorder.

Nitrogen deficiency can be prevented by using grass mowings as a mulch or foliar feeding with manure. Sowing green manure crops such as grazing rye to cover soil over the winter will help to prevent nitrogen leaching, while leguminous green manures such as winter tares will fix additional nitrogen from the atmosphere.

Moreover, poor irrigation system in the field can lead to loss of nitrogen in plants as stagnant water in the field will cause the nitrogen to evaporate in the air.

==Symptoms==
Some symptoms of nitrogen deficiency (in absence or low supply) are given below:
#The chlorophyll content of the plant leaves is reduced which results in pale yellow color (chlorosis). Older leaves turn completely yellow.
#Flowering, fruitings, protein and starch contents are reduced. Reduction in protein results in stunted growth and dormant lateral buds.

===Disease===
Plants look thin and pale, and the condition is called &quot;general starvation&quot;.

=== Effect on Potato Production ===
Symptoms of nitrogen deficiencies in plants is general chlorosis of the leaves, which is when leaves turn pale green and cup upwards severely in deficient plants. Nitrogen deficiencies also cause leaves to remain small and drop prematurely, resulting in less photosynthesis occurring in the plant. In addition, fewer and smaller tubers can form for harvest. There is a direct correlation between tuber size and yield and the amount of plant-available nitrogen in the soil. This makes it crucial that fields have enough nitrogen in the soil to grow prosperous crops. However, excess nitrogen in the soil can also be harmful to potato production, influencing how well the roots are able to develop, and delays can occur in tuber initiation during the tuberization stage of potato growth.

== Detection ==
The visual symptoms of nitrogen deficiency make it relatively easy to detect in some plant species. Symptoms include poor plant growth, and leaves become pale green or yellow because they are unable to make sufficient chlorophyll. Leaves in this state are said to be chlorotic. Lower leaves (older leaves) show symptoms first, since the plant will move nitrogen from older tissues to more important younger ones. Nevertheless, plants are reported to show nitrogen deficiency symptoms at different parts. For example, Nitrogen deficiency of tea is identified by retarded shoot growth and yellowing of younger leaves.

However, these physical symptoms can also be caused by numerous other stresses, such as deficiencies in other nutrients, toxicity, herbicide injury, disease, insect damage or environmental conditions. Therefore, nitrogen deficiency is most reliably detected by conducting quantitative tests in addition to assessing the plant&#x27;s visual symptoms. These tests include soil tests and plant tissue test.

Plant tissue tests destructively sample the plant of interest. However, nitrogen deficiency can also be detected non-destructively by measuring chlorophyll content.

Chlorophyll content tests work because leaf nitrogen content and chlorophyll concentration are closely linked, which would be expected since the majority of leaf nitrogen is contained in chlorophyll molecules. Chlorophyll content can be detected with a Chlorophyll content meter; a portable instrument that measures the greenness of leaves to estimate their relative chlorophyll concentration.

Chlorophyll content can also be assessed with a chlorophyll fluorometer, which measures a chlorophyll fluorescence ratio to identify phenolic compounds that are produced in higher quantities when nitrogen is limited. These instruments can therefore be used to non-destructively test for nitrogen deficiency.

==Corrective Measures==
Fertilizers like ammonium phosphate, calcium ammonium nitrate, and urea can be supplied. Foliar spray of urea is a quick method.

<doc id="157887" wikidata="Q2938157" url="?curid=157887" title="Potassium deficiency (plants)">
<text>Potassium deficiency, also known as [[potash]] deficiency, is a plant disorder that is most common on light, sandy soils, because potassium ions (K+) are highly soluble and will easily leach from soils without colloids. Potassium deficiency is also common in chalky or peaty soils with a low clay content. It is also found on heavy clays with a poor structure.

==Role of potassium in plants==

The main role of potassium is to provide the ionic environment for metabolic processes in the cytosol, and as such functions as a regulator of various processes including growth regulation. Plants require potassium ions (K+) for protein synthesis and for the opening and closing of stomata, which is regulated by proton pumps to make surrounding guard cells either turgid or flaccid. A deficiency of potassium ions can impair a plant&#x27;s ability to maintain these processes. Potassium also functions in other physiological processes such as photosynthesis, protein synthesis, activation of some enzymes, phloem solute transport of photoassimilates into source organs, and maintenance of cation:anion balance in the cytosol and vacuole.

==Symptoms of potassium deficiency==

Typical symptoms of potassium deficiency in plants include brown scorching and curling of leaf tips as well as chlorosis (yellowing) between leaf veins. Purple spots may also appear on the leaf undersides. Plant growth, root development, and seed and fruit development are usually reduced in potassium-deficient plants. Often, potassium deficiency symptoms first appear on older (lower) leaves because potassium is a mobile nutrient, meaning that a plant can allocate potassium to younger leaves when it is K deficient. Deficient plants may be more prone to frost damage and disease, and their symptoms can often be confused with wind scorch or drought.
The deficiency is most common in several important fruit and vegetable crops; notably potatoes, brassicas, tomatoes, apples, currants, gooseberries, and raspberries. Sugar beets, cereals, and clover are also commonly affected. Specific symptoms for each of these plants are as follows:

In potatoes, tuber size is much reduced and crop yield is low. The leaves of the plant appear dull and are often blue-green in color with interveinal chlorosis. Leaves will also develop small, dark brown spots on the undersides and a bronzed appearance on the upper surfaces.

In brassicas, leaves are blue-green in color and may have a low degree of interveinal chlorosis. Scorching along the outside edges of leaves is common, and leaves are often tough in texture due to slow growth.

In tomatoes, the stems are woody and growth is slow. Leaves are blue-green in color, and the interveinal area often fades to a pale gray color. Leaves may also have a bronzed appearance and yellow and orange patches may develop on some of the leaflets. Fruits often ripen unevenly and sometimes have green patches near the stalks.

In apples, leaves are scorched around the edges, and interveinal chlorosis is common. Apple fruits often have a slightly acidic or woody taste.

In gooseberries, currants, and raspberries, dieback of shoots and branches is common and although the plant may produce many blossom buds in the early stages of deficiency, fruit yields turn out low and the fruits are of poor quality.

==Potassium deficiency and plant disease==

For many species, potassium-deficient plants are more susceptible to frost damage and certain diseases than plants with adequate potassium levels. Increased disease resistance associated with adequate potassium levels indicates that potassium has roles in providing disease resistance, and increasing the potassium levels of deficient plants have been shown to decrease the intensity of many diseases. However, increasing potassium concentration above the optimal level does not provide greater disease resistance. In agriculture, some cultivars are more efficient at K uptake due to genetic variations, and often these plants have increased disease resistance.
The mechanisms involved with increased host resistance and potassium include a decreased cell permeability and decreased susceptibility to tissue penetration. Silica, which is accumulated in greater quantities when adequate potassium is present, is incorporated into cell walls, strengthening the epidermal layer which functions as a physical barrier to pathogens. Potassium has also been implicated to have a role in the proper thickening of cell walls. To aid in potassium deficiency, farmers and many monoculture crop producers use vermiculite as a form of nutrition, soil aeration assistance as well as water retention to aid in nutrient poor environments.

== Plant adaptation to low-K environments ==
When potassium is readily available in the soil, a plant absorb it through plasma membrane channels and high-affinity H+/K+ transporters and store it in vacuoles. However, when K+ is present at very low concentrations, vacuolar K+ is used to feed the cytoplasm.

This process is initiated by a Ca2+-dependent signaling network which induces the release of K+ from the vacuole to the cytosol.

==Prevention and cure==

The most widely used potassium fertilizer is potassium chloride (muriate of potash). Other inorganic potassium fertilizers include potassium nitrate, potassium sulfate, and monopotassium phosphate. Wood ash also has high potassium content but must be used cautiously due its effect on pH level. Adequate moisture is necessary for effective potassium uptake; low soil water reduces K uptake by plant roots. Liming acidic soils can increase potassium retention in some soils by reducing leaching; practices that increase soil organic matter can also increase potassium retention.

<doc id="157893" wikidata="Q777509" url="?curid=157893" title="Eye, Suffolk">
<text>Eye () is a market town and civil parish in the Mid Suffolk district, in the north of the English county of Suffolk, about south of Diss, north of Ipswich and south-west of Norwich. The population in the 2011 census of 2,154 was estimated to be 2,361 in 2019 and updated to 2,210 following the 2021 census. It lies close to the River Waveney, which forms the border with Norfolk, and on the River Dove. Eye is twinned with the town of Pouzauges in the Vendée department of France.

==Etymology==
The town of Eye derives its name from the Old English word for &quot;island, land by water&quot;. It is thought that the first settlement on the site was almost surrounded by water and marshland formed by the Dove and its tributaries. The area remains prone to flooding close to the river.

==History==
There have been Palaeolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age finds in and around Eye, but the earliest evidence of settlement dates from the Roman period. It includes buildings and coins from about 365 CE. A large Anglo-Saxon cemetery with many urned cremations and some furnished inhumations, in use in the 6th century, was excavated near the Waterloo Plantation in 1818.

In 1781 labourers unearthed a lead box by the river at Clint Farm in Eye, south of Scole and south–west of Hoxne. It contained some 600 Roman gold coins from the reigns of Valens and Valentinian I (reigned 364–375), Gratian (375–383), Theodosius I (378–395), Arcadius (395–408) and Honorius (393–423).

Eye before the Norman Conquest was one of numerous holdings of Edric of Laxfield, a wealthy, influential Saxon, who was the third largest landholder in Suffolk. After the Norman Conquest, the town&#x27;s regional importance was confirmed when the Honour of Eye was granted to William Malet, a Norman lord.

In 1066–1071, Malet built a castle as his military and administrative headquarters and started a market that initiated the urbanisation of Eye. In 1086–1087, William&#x27;s son Robert Malet, tenant-in-chief of the Honour of Eye in the hundred of Hartismere, founded Eye Priory.
Eye began to lose its strategic importance after 1173 when the castle was attacked by Hugh Bigod, 1st Earl of Norfolk during a rebellion against Henry II, and later during the Second Barons&#x27; War of 1265, after which it never regained its former status. Its prison continued in use up until the early 17th century, despite a programme of demolishing most of the castle buildings in the 14th century. A windmill built in 1561–1562 stood on the motte until a circular mock keep was built there in 1844.

Eye was once the smallest borough in the country, its claim based on the 1205 Charter of King John. The charter was renewed in 1408, then by Elizabeth I in 1558 and 1574, by James I in 1604, and by William III in 1697. However, in 1885 the town clerk of Hythe proved that the original charter belonged only to Hythe in Kent, the error having arisen from the similarity of the early English names, the error was confirmed by archivists in the 1950s but borough status was not discontinued until 1974. In 1835 Eye became a municipal borough which became part of the administrative county of East Suffolk in 1889, the district contained the parish of Eye. On 1 April 1974 the district was abolished and became part of Mid Suffolk in the non-metropolitan county of Suffolk. A successor parish was formed covering the same area as the former district and its parish. Eye retained a Town Council, a Mayor and its insignia. From 1571 to 1832 Eye returned two Members of Parliament (MPs), then after the Reform Act 1832, a single MP until 1983, when the Eye Constituency became the Suffolk Central constituency.

The notable Cornwallis family was established at nearby Brome Hall in the 14th century. Individuals from the family, such as Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis, represented Suffolk county in the House of Commons over the next three hundred years.

The Lordship of the Manor of Eye (Sokemere) and Constableship of the Castle is held by the Palmer family of Haughley in Suffolk. The current Lord is Kieron Palmer of Haughley, succeeding his father Kenneth Palmer. The Manor was held by the Malet family in Norman times, Henry Earl of Brabant, the De Ufford, De la Pole, Cornwallis and Kerrison families as well as King Stephen, Edward I, Mary I and Thomas Beckett in previous years. Known as the Honour of Eye, it consisted of 129 manors and had the right to a court of &quot;pie poudre&quot; at its Whit Monday market fairs and those of Thrandeston and Finningham.

The earliest mention of industry in Eye records that in 1673 &quot;the women&#x27;s employ in this town is making of bone lace&quot; and in 1830, &quot;the humbler class of industrious females employ themselves in lace making.&quot; It would appear that Eye was at the centre of a localised lace-making industry for many years. In 1846 Eye Borough Council failed in its attempt to route the new London-Norwich railway line through Eye. The line, completed in 1849, went instead through Diss, which was ensured growth in prosperity and population, while the importance of Eye waned. Eye railway station, at the end of a branch line from Mellis, closed to passengers in 1931 and to freight in 1964.

Eye Airfield, to the north-east of the town, began as RAF Eye, occupied by the 490th Bomb Group of the USAAF&#x27;s VIII Bomber Command during the Second World War.

==Services and amenities==
Eye today has a population of just over 2000. Hartismere School provides secondary education and St Peter and St Paul CE Primary School primary education. It has a health centre, a library, a police station and a retained fire station. A community hospital opened in 2012, after a previous one closed in 2005.

The town&#x27;s Guildhall is a Grade I listed building now converted into a private residence. Eye Town Hall, an imaginative and unorthodox building dating from 1856 and listed Grade II*, was designed by Edward Buckton Lamb.

==Church of St Peter and St Paul==

The Grade 1 listed Church of St Peter and St Paul from the 14th century is seen as one of the finest in the county.

A 13th-century Early English doorway was retained from an earlier building. The 15th and again the 16th century brought new work and renovation. This included installing an altar tomb to William Honnyng in the South or Lady Chapel and one to Nicholas Cutler to the north-west of the nave. The church was restored in 1868 by James Colling, a London architect. A notable added feature is a remarkable late 15th-century rood screen, with a loft and rood designed by Ninian Comper in 1925.

The tower of the church is high to the tip of the pinnacles.

<text>Group dynamics is a system of behaviors and psychological processes occurring within a social group (&quot;intra&quot;group dynamics), or between social groups (&quot;inter&quot;group dynamics). The study of group dynamics can be useful in understanding decision-making behaviour, tracking the spread of diseases in society, creating effective therapy techniques, and following the emergence and popularity of new ideas and technologies. These applications of the field are studied in psychology, sociology, anthropology, political science, epidemiology, education, social work, leadership studies, business and managerial studies, as well as communication studies.

==History==
The history of group dynamics (or group processes) has a consistent, underlying premise: &quot;the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.&quot; A social group is an entity that has qualities which cannot be understood just by studying the individuals that make up the group. In 1924, Gestalt psychologist Max Wertheimer proposed &quot;There are entities where the behaviour of the whole cannot be derived from its individual elements nor from the way these elements fit together; rather the opposite is true: the properties of any of the parts are determined by the intrinsic structural laws of the whole&quot;.

As a field of study, group dynamics has roots in both psychology and sociology. Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920), credited as the founder of experimental psychology, had a particular interest in the psychology of communities, which he believed possessed phenomena (human language, customs, and religion) that could not be described through a study of the individual. On the sociological side, Émile Durkheim (1858–1917), who was influenced by Wundt, also recognized collective phenomena, such as public knowledge. Other key theorists include Gustave Le Bon (1841–1931) who believed that crowds possessed a &#x27;racial unconscious&#x27; with primitive, aggressive, and antisocial instincts, and William McDougall (psychologist), who believed in a &#x27;group mind,&#x27; which had a distinct existence born from the interaction of individuals.

Eventually, the social psychologist Kurt Lewin (1890–1947) coined the term &quot;group dynamics&quot; to describe the positive and negative forces within groups of people. In 1945, he established &quot;The Group Dynamics Research Center&quot; at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the first institute devoted explicitly to the study of group dynamics. Throughout his career, Lewin was focused on how the study of group dynamics could be applied to real-world, social issues.

Increasingly, research has applied evolutionary psychology principles to group dynamics. As human&#x27;s social environments became more complex, they acquired adaptations by way of group dynamics that enhance survival. Examples include mechanisms for dealing with status, reciprocity, identifying cheaters, ostracism, altruism, group decision, leadership, and intergroup relations.

==Key theorists==

===Gustave Le Bon===

Gustave Le Bon was a French social psychologist whose seminal study, &quot;The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind&quot; (1896) led to the development of group psychology.

===William McDougall===

The British psychologist William McDougall in his work &quot;The Group Mind&quot; (1920) researched the dynamics of groups of various sizes and degrees of organization.

===Sigmund Freud===

In &quot;Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego,&quot; (1922), Sigmund Freud based his preliminary description of group psychology on Le Bon&#x27;s work, but went on to develop his own, original theory, related to what he had begun to elaborate in &quot;Totem and Taboo.&quot; Theodor Adorno reprised Freud&#x27;s essay in 1951 with his &quot;Freudian Theory and the Pattern of Fascist Propaganda&quot;, and said that &quot;It is not an overstatement if we say that Freud, though he was hardly interested in the political phase of the problem, clearly foresaw the rise and nature of fascist mass movements in purely psychological categories.&quot;

===Jacob L. Moreno===

Jacob L. Moreno was a psychiatrist, dramatist, philosopher and theoretician who coined the term &quot;group psychotherapy&quot; in the early 1930s and was highly influential at the time.

===Kurt Lewin===

Kurt Lewin (1943, 1948, 1951) is commonly identified as the founder of the movement to study groups scientifically. He coined the term &quot;group dynamics&quot; to describe the way groups and individuals act and react to changing circumstances.

===William Schutz===

William Schutz (1958, 1966) looked at interpersonal relations as stage-developmental, inclusion (am I included?), control (who is top dog here?), and affection (do I belong here?). Schutz sees groups resolving each issue in turn in order to be able to progress to the next stage.

Conversely, a struggling group can devolve to an earlier stage, if unable to resolve outstanding issues at its present stage. 
Schutz referred to these group dynamics as &quot;the interpersonal underworld,&quot; group processes which are largely unseen and un-acknowledged, as opposed to &quot;content&quot; issues, which are nominally the agenda of group meetings.

===Wilfred Bion===

Wilfred Bion (1961) studied group dynamics from a psychoanalytic perspective, and stated that he was much influenced by Wilfred Trotter for whom he worked at University College Hospital London, as did another key figure in the Psychoanalytic movement, Ernest Jones. He discovered several mass group processes which involved the group as a whole adopting an orientation which, in his opinion, interfered with the ability of a group to accomplish the work it was nominally engaged in. Bion&#x27;s experiences are reported in his published books, especially &quot;Experiences in Groups.&quot; The Tavistock Institute has further developed and applied the theory and practices developed by Bion.

===Bruce Tuckman===

Bruce Tuckman (1965) proposed the four-stage model called Tuckman&#x27;s Stages for a group. Tuckman&#x27;s model states that the ideal group decision-making process should occur in four stages:

* &quot;Forming&quot; (pretending to get on or get along with others)
* &quot;Storming&quot; (letting down the politeness barrier and trying to get down to the issues even if tempers flare up)
* &quot;Norming&quot; (getting used to each other and developing trust and productivity)
* &quot;Performing&quot; (working in a group to a common goal on a highly efficient and cooperative basis)

Tuckman later added a fifth stage for the dissolution of a group called &quot;adjourning&quot;. (&quot;Adjourning&quot; may also be referred to as &quot;mourning&quot;, i.e. mourning the adjournment of the group). This model refers to the overall pattern of the group, but of course individuals within a group work in different ways. If distrust persists, a group may never even get to the norming stage.

===M. Scott Peck===

M. Scott Peck developed stages for larger-scale groups (i.e., communities) which are similar to Tuckman&#x27;s stages of group development. Peck describes the stages of a community as:

* &quot;Pseudo-community&quot;
* &quot;Chaos&quot;
* &quot;Emptiness&quot;
* &quot;True Community&quot;

Communities may be distinguished from other types of groups, in Peck&#x27;s view, by the need for members to eliminate barriers to communication in order to be able to form true community. Examples of common barriers are: expectations and preconceptions; prejudices; ideology, counterproductive norms, theology and solutions; the need to heal, convert, fix or solve and the need to control. A community is born when its members reach a stage of &quot;emptiness&quot; or peace.

===Richard Hackman===
Richard Hackman developed a synthetic, research-based model for designing and managing work groups. Hackman suggested that groups are successful when they satisfy internal and external clients, develop capabilities to perform in the future, and when members find meaning and satisfaction in the group. Hackman proposed five conditions that increase the chance that groups will be successful. These include:
# &quot;Being a real team&quot;: which results from having a shared task, clear boundaries which clarify who is inside or outside of the group, and stability in group membership.
# &quot;Compelling direction&quot;: which results from a clear, challenging, and consequential goal.
# &quot;Enabling structure&quot;: which results from having tasks which have variety, a group size that is not too large, talented group members who have at least moderate social skill, and strong norms that specify appropriate behaviour.
# &quot;Supportive context&quot;: which occurs in groups nested in larger groups (e.g. companies). In companies, supportive contexts involves a) reward systems that reward performance and cooperation (e.g. group based rewards linked to group performance), b) an educational system that develops member skills, c) an information and materials system that provides the needed information and raw materials (e.g. computers).
# &quot;Expert coaching&quot;: which occurs on the rare occasions when group members feel they need help with task or interpersonal issues. Hackman emphasizes that many team leaders are overbearing and undermine group effectiveness.

==Intragroup dynamics==
&quot;Intragroup dynamics&quot; (also referred to as ingroup-, within-group, or commonly just ‘group dynamics’) are the underlying processes that give rise to a set of norms, roles, relations, and common goals that characterize a particular social group. Examples of groups include religious, political, military, and environmental groups, sports teams, work groups, and therapy groups. Amongst the members of a group, there is a state of interdependence, through which the behaviours, attitudes, opinions, and experiences of each member are collectively influenced by the other group members. In many fields of research, there is an interest in understanding how group dynamics influence individual behaviour, attitudes, and opinions.

The dynamics of a particular group depend on how one defines the &quot;boundaries&quot; of the group. Often, there are distinct &quot;subgroups&quot; within a more broadly defined group. For example, one could define U.S. residents (‘Americans’) as a group, but could also define a more specific set of U.S. residents (for example, &#x27;Americans in the South&#x27;). For each of these groups, there are distinct dynamics that can be discussed. Notably, on this very broad level, the study of group dynamics is similar to the study of &quot;culture&quot;. For example, there are group dynamics in the U.S. South that sustain a &quot;culture of honor&quot;, which is associated with norms of toughness, honour-related violence, and self-defence.

===Group formation===
Group formation starts with a psychological bond between individuals. The &quot;social cohesion approach&quot; suggests that group formation comes out of bonds of interpersonal attraction. In contrast, the &quot;social identity approach&quot; suggests that a group starts when a collection of individuals perceive that they share some social category (‘smokers’, ‘nurses,’ ‘students,’ ‘hockey players’), and that interpersonal attraction only secondarily enhances the connection between individuals. Additionally, from the social identity approach, group formation involves both identifying with some individuals and explicitly &quot;not&quot; identifying with others. So to say, a level of psychological &quot;distinctiveness&quot; is necessary for group formation. Through interaction, individuals begin to develop group norms, roles, and attitudes which define the group, and are internalized to influence behaviour.

&quot;Emergent groups&quot; arise from a relatively spontaneous process of group formation. For example, in response to a natural disaster, an &quot;emergent response group&quot; may form. These groups are characterized as having no preexisting structure (e.g. group membership, allocated roles) or prior experience working together. Yet, these groups still express high levels of interdependence and coordinate knowledge, resources, and tasks.

=== Joining groups ===
Joining a group is determined by a number of different factors, including an individual&#x27;s personal traits; gender; social motives such as need for affiliation, need for power, and need for intimacy; attachment style; and prior group experiences. Groups can offer some advantages to its members that would not be possible if an individual decided to remain alone, including gaining social support in the forms of emotional support, instrumental support, and informational support. It also offers friendship, potential new interests, learning new skills, and enhancing self esteem. However, joining a group may also cost an individual time, effort, and personal resources as they may conform to social pressures and strive to reap the benefits that may be offered by the group.

The Minimax Principle is a part of social exchange theory that states that people will join and remain in a group that can provide them with the maximum amount of valuable rewards while at the same time, ensuring the minimum amount of costs to themselves. However, this does not necessarily mean that a person will join a group simply because the reward/cost ratio seems attractive. According to Howard Kelley and John Thibaut, a group may be attractive to us in terms of costs and benefits, but that attractiveness alone does not determine whether or not we will join the group. Instead, our decision is based on two factors: our comparison level, and our comparison level for alternatives.

In John Thibaut and Harold Kelley&#x27;s social exchange theory, comparison level is the standard by which an individual will evaluate the desirability of becoming a member of the group and forming new social relationships within the group. This comparison level is influenced by previous relationships and membership in different groups. Those individuals who have experienced positive rewards with few costs in previous relationships and groups will have a higher comparison level than a person who experienced more negative costs and fewer rewards in previous relationships and group memberships. According to the social exchange theory, group membership will be more satisfying to a new prospective member if the group&#x27;s outcomes, in terms of costs and rewards, are above the individual&#x27;s comparison level. As well, group membership will be unsatisfying to a new member if the outcomes are below the individual&#x27;s comparison level.

Comparison level only predicts how satisfied a new member will be with the social relationships within the group. To determine whether people will actually join or leave a group, the value of other, alternative groups needs to be taken into account. This is called the comparison level for alternatives. This comparison level for alternatives is the standard by which an individual will evaluate the quality of the group in comparison to other groups the individual has the opportunity to join. Thiabaut and Kelley stated that the &quot;comparison level for alternatives can be defined informally as the lowest level of outcomes a member will accept in the light of available alternative opportunities.”

Joining and leaving groups is ultimately dependent on the comparison level for alternatives, whereas member satisfaction within a group depends on the comparison level. To summarize, if membership in the group is above the comparison level for alternatives and above the comparison level, the membership within the group will be satisfying and an individual will be more likely to join the group. If membership in the group is above the comparison level for alternatives but below the comparison level, membership will be not be satisfactory; however, the individual will likely join the group since no other desirable options are available. When group membership is below the comparison level for alternatives but above the comparison level, membership is satisfying but an individual will be unlikely to join. If group membership is below both the comparison and alternative comparison levels, membership will be dissatisfying and the individual will be less likely to join the group.

===Types of groups===

Groups can vary drastically from one another. For example, three best friends who interact every day as well as a collection of people watching a movie in a theater both constitute a group. Past research has identified four basic types of groups which include, but are not limited to: primary groups, social groups, collective groups, and categories. It is important to define these four types of groups because they are intuitive to most lay people. For example, in an experiment, participants were asked to sort a number of groups into categories based on their own criteria. Examples of groups to be sorted were a sports team, a family, people at a bus stop and women. It was found that participants consistently sorted groups into four categories: intimacy groups, task groups, loose associations, and social categories. These categories are conceptually similar to the four basic types to be discussed. Therefore, it seems that individuals intuitively define aggregations of individuals in this way.

====Primary groups====
Primary groups are characterized by relatively small, long-lasting groups of individuals who share personally meaningful relationships. Since the members of these groups often interact face-to-face, they know each other very well and are unified. Individuals that are a part of primary groups consider the group to be an important part of their lives. Consequently, members strongly identify with their group, even without regular meetings. Cooley believed that primary groups were essential for integrating individuals into their society since this is often their first experience with a group. For example, individuals are born into a primary group, their family, which creates a foundation for them to base their future relationships. Individuals can be born into a primary group; however, primary groups can also form when individuals interact for extended periods of time in meaningful ways. Examples of primary groups include family, close friends, and gangs.

====Social groups====
A social group is characterized by a formally organized group of individuals who are not as emotionally involved with each other as those in a primary group. These groups tend to be larger, with shorter memberships compared to primary groups. Further, social groups do not have as stable memberships, since members are able to leave their social group and join new groups. The goals of social groups are often task-oriented as opposed to relationship-oriented. Examples of social groups include coworkers, clubs, and sports teams.

====Collectives====
Collectives are characterized by large groups of individuals who display similar actions or outlooks. They are loosely formed, spontaneous, and brief. Examples of collectives include a flash mob, an audience at a movie, and a crowd watching a building burn.

====Categories====
Categories are characterized by a collection of individuals who are similar in some way. Categories become groups when their similarities have social implications. For example, when people treat others differently because of certain aspects of their appearance or heritage, for example, this creates groups of different races. For this reason, categories can appear to be higher in entitativity and essentialism than primary, social, and collective groups. Entitativity is defined by Campbell as the extent to which collections of individuals are perceived to be a group. The degree of entitativity that a group has is influenced by whether a collection of individuals experience the same fate, display similarities, and are close in proximity. If individuals believe that a group is high in entitativity, then they are likely to believe that the group has unchanging characteristics that are essential to the group, known as essentialism. Examples of categories are New Yorkers, gamblers, and women.

===Group membership and social identity===
The social group is a critical source of information about individual identity. We naturally make comparisons between our own group and other groups, but we do not necessarily make objective comparisons. Instead, we make evaluations that are self-enhancing, emphasizing the positive qualities of our own group (see ingroup bias). In this way, these comparisons give us a distinct and valued social identity that benefits our self-esteem. Our social identity and group membership also satisfies a need to belong. Of course, individuals belong to multiple groups. Therefore, one&#x27;s social identity can have several, qualitatively distinct parts (for example, one&#x27;s ethnic identity, religious identity, and political identity).

Optimal distinctiveness theory suggests that individuals have a desire to be similar to others, but also a desire to differentiate themselves, ultimately seeking some balance of these two desires (to obtain &quot;optimal distinctiveness&quot;). For example, one might imagine a young teenager in the United States who tries to balance these desires, not wanting to be ‘just like everyone else,’ but also wanting to ‘fit in’ and be similar to others. One&#x27;s collective self may offer a balance between these two desires. That is, to be similar to others (those who you share group membership with), but also to be different from others (those who are outside of your group).

===Group cohesion===

In the social sciences, group cohesion refers to the processes that keep members of a social group connected. Terms such as attraction, solidarity, and morale are often used to describe group cohesion. It is thought to be one of the most important characteristics of a group, and has been linked to group performance, intergroup conflict and therapeutic change.

Group cohesion, as a scientifically studied property of groups, is commonly associated with Kurt Lewin and his student, Leon Festinger. Lewin defined group cohesion as the willingness of individuals to stick together, and believed that without cohesiveness a group could not exist. As an extension of Lewin&#x27;s work, Festinger (along with Stanley Schachter and Kurt Back) described cohesion as, “the total field of forces which act on members to remain in the group” (Festinger, Schachter, &amp; Back, 1950, p. 37). Later, this definition was modified to describe the forces acting on individual members to remain in the group, termed &quot;attraction to the group&quot;. Since then, several models for understanding the concept of group cohesion have been developed, including Albert Carron&#x27;s hierarchical model and several bi-dimensional models (vertical v. horizontal cohesion, task v. social cohesion, belongingness and morale, and personal v. social attraction). Before Lewin and Festinger, there were, of course, descriptions of a very similar group property. For example, Emile Durkheim described two forms of solidarity (mechanical and organic), which created a sense of collective conscious and an emotion-based sense of community.

===Black sheep effect===
Beliefs within the ingroup are based on how individuals in the group see their other members. Individuals tend to upgrade likeable in-group members and deviate from unlikeable group members, making them a separate outgroup. This is called the black sheep effect. The way a person judges socially desirable and socially undesirable individuals depends upon whether they are part of the ingroup or outgroup.

This phenomenon has been later accounted for by subjective group dynamics theory. According to this theory, people derogate socially undesirable (deviant) ingroup members relative to outgroup members, because they give a bad image of the ingroup and jeopardize people&#x27;s social identity.

In more recent studies, Marques and colleagues have shown that this occurs more strongly with regard to ingroup full members than other members. Whereas &quot;new members&quot; of a group must prove themselves to the full members to become accepted, full members have undergone socialization and are already accepted within the group. They have more privilege than newcomers but more responsibility to help the group achieve its goals. &quot;Marginal members&quot; were once full members but lost membership because they failed to live up to the group&#x27;s expectations. They can rejoin the group if they go through re-socialization. Therefore, full members&#x27; behavior is paramount to define the ingroup&#x27;s image.

Bogart and Ryan surveyed the development of new members&#x27; stereotypes about in-groups and out-groups during socialization. Results showed that the new members judged themselves as consistent with the stereotypes of their in-groups, even when they had recently committed to join those groups or existed as marginal members. They also tended to judge the group as a whole in an increasingly less positive manner after they became full members. However, there is no evidence that this affects the way they are judged by other members. Nevertheless, depending on the self-esteem of an individual, members of the in-group may experience different private beliefs about the group&#x27;s activities but will publicly express the opposite—that they actually share these beliefs. One member may not personally agree with something the group does, but to avoid the black sheep effect, they will publicly agree with the group and keep the private beliefs to themselves. If the person is privately self-aware, he or she is more likely to comply with the group even if they possibly have their own beliefs about the situation.

In situations of hazing within fraternities and sororities on college campuses, pledges may encounter this type of situation and may outwardly comply with the tasks they are forced to do regardless of their personal feelings about the Greek institution they are joining. This is done in an effort to avoid becoming an outcast of the group. Outcasts who behave in a way that might jeopardize the group tend to be treated more harshly than the likeable ones in a group, creating a black sheep effect. Full members of a fraternity might treat the incoming new members harshly, causing the pledges to decide if they approve of the situation and if they will voice their disagreeing opinions about it.

===Group influence on individual behaviour===
Individual behaviour is influenced by the presence of others. For example, studies have found that individuals work harder and faster when others are present (see social facilitation), and that an individual&#x27;s performance is reduced when others in the situation create distraction or conflict. Groups also influence individual&#x27;s decision-making processes. These include decisions related to ingroup bias, persuasion (see Asch conformity experiments), obedience (see Milgram Experiment), and groupthink. There are both positive and negative implications of group influence on individual behaviour. This type of influence is often useful in the context of work settings, team sports, and political activism. However, the influence of groups on the individual can also generate extremely negative behaviours, evident in Nazi Germany, the My Lai Massacre, and in the Abu Ghraib prison (also see Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse).

===Group structure===
A group&#x27;s structure is the internal framework that defines members&#x27; relations to one another over time. Frequently studied elements of group structure include roles, norms, values, communication patterns, and status differentials. Group structure has also been defined as the underlying pattern of roles, norms, and networks of relations among members that define and organize the group.

Roles can be defined as a tendency to behave, contribute and interrelate with others in a particular way. Roles may be assigned formally, but more often are defined through the process of role differentiation. Role differentiation is the degree to which different group members have specialized functions. A group with a high level of role differentiation would be categorized as having many different roles that are specialized and narrowly defined. A key role in a group is the leader, but there are other important roles as well, including task roles, relationship roles, and individual roles. Functional (task) roles are generally defined in relation to the tasks the team is expected to perform. Individuals engaged in task roles focus on the goals of the group and on enabling the work that members do; examples of task roles include coordinator, recorder, critic, or technician. A group member engaged in a relationship role (or socioemotional role) is focused on maintaining the interpersonal and emotional needs of the groups&#x27; members; examples of relationship role include encourager, harmonizer, or compromiser.

Norms are the informal rules that groups adopt to regulate members&#x27; behaviour. Norms refer to what should be done and represent value judgments about appropriate behaviour in social situations. Although they are infrequently written down or even discussed, norms have powerful influence on group behaviour. They are a fundamental aspect of group structure as they provide direction and motivation, and organize the social interactions of members. Norms are said to be emergent, as they develop gradually throughout interactions between group members. While many norms are widespread throughout society, groups may develop their own norms that members must learn when they join the group. There are various types of norms, including: prescriptive, proscriptive, descriptive, and injunctive.
* &quot;Prescriptive Norms&quot;: the socially appropriate way to respond in a social situation, or what group members are supposed to do (e.g. saying thank you after someone does a favour for you)
* &quot;Proscriptive Norms&quot;: actions that group members should not do; prohibitive (e.g. not belching in public) 
* &quot;Descriptive Norms&quot;: describe what people usually do (e.g. clapping after a speech)
* &quot;Injunctive Norms&quot;: describe behaviours that people &quot;ought&quot; to do; more evaluative in nature than a descriptive norm

Intermember Relations are the connections among the members of a group, or the social network within a group. Group members are linked to one another at varying levels. Examining the intermember relations of a group can highlight a group&#x27;s density (how many members are linked to one another), or the degree centrality of members (number of ties between members). Analysing the intermember relations aspect of a group can highlight the degree centrality of each member in the group, which can lead to a better understanding of the roles of certain group (e.g. an individual who is a &#x27;go-between&#x27; in a group will have closer ties to numerous group members which can aid in communication, etc.).

Values are goals or ideas that serve as guiding principles for the group. Like norms, values may be communicated either explicitly or on an ad hoc basis. Values can serve as a rallying point for the team. However, some values (such as conformity) can also be dysfunction and lead to poor decisions by the team.

Communication patterns describe the flow of information within the group and they are typically described as either centralized or decentralized. With a centralized pattern, communications tend to flow from one source to all group members. Centralized communications allow standardization of information, but may restrict the free flow of information. Decentralized communications make it easy to share information directly between group members. When decentralized, communications tend to flow more freely, but the delivery of information may not be as fast or accurate as with centralized communications. Another potential downside of decentralized communications is the sheer volume of information that can be generated, particularly with electronic media.

Status differentials are the relative differences in status among group members. When a group is first formed the members may all be on an equal level, but over time certain members may acquire status and authority within the group; this can create what is known as a &quot;pecking order&quot; within a group. Status can be determined by a variety of factors and characteristics, including specific status characteristics (e.g. task-specific behavioural and personal characteristics, such as experience) or diffuse status characteristics (e.g. age, race, ethnicity). It is important that other group members perceive an individual&#x27;s status to be warranted and deserved, as otherwise they may not have authority within the group. Status differentials may affect the relative amount of pay among group members and they may also affect the group&#x27;s tolerance to violation of group norms (e.g. people with higher status may be given more freedom to violate group norms).

===Group performance===

Forsyth suggests that while many daily tasks undertaken by individuals could be performed in isolation, the preference is to perform with other people.

====Social facilitation and performance gains====

In a study of dynamogenic stimulation for the purpose of explaining pacemaking and competition in 1898, Norman Triplett theorized that &quot;the bodily presence of another rider is a stimulus to the racer in arousing the competitive instinct...&quot;. This dynamogenic factor is believed to have laid the groundwork for what is now known as social facilitation—an &quot;improvement in task performance that occurs when people work in the presence of other people&quot;.

Further to Triplett&#x27;s observation, in 1920, Floyd Allport found that although people in groups were more productive than individuals, the quality of their product/effort was inferior.

In 1965, Robert Zajonc expanded the study of arousal response (originated by Triplett) with further research in the area of social facilitation. In his study, Zajonc considered two experimental paradigms. In the first—audience effects—Zajonc observed behaviour in the presence of passive spectators, and the second—co-action effects—he examined behaviour in the presence of another individual engaged in the same activity.

Zajonc observed two categories of behaviours—dominant responses to tasks that are easier to learn and which dominate other potential responses and nondominant responses to tasks that are less likely to be performed. In his Theory of Social Facilitation, Zajonc concluded that in the presence of others, when action is required, depending on the task requirement, either social facilitation or social interference will impact the outcome of the task. If social facilitation occurs, the task will have required a dominant response from the individual resulting in better performance in the presence of others, whereas if social interference occurs the task will have elicited a nondominant response from the individual resulting in subpar performance of the task.

Several theories analysing performance gains in groups via drive, motivational, cognitive and personality processes, explain why social facilitation occurs.

Zajonc hypothesized that compresence (the state of responding in the presence of others) elevates an individual&#x27;s drive level which in turn triggers social facilitation when tasks are simple and easy to execute, but impedes performance when tasks are challenging.

Nickolas Cottrell, 1972, proposed the evaluation apprehension model whereby he suggested people associate social situations with an evaluative process. Cottrell argued this situation is met with apprehension and it is this motivational response, not arousal/elevated drive, that is responsible for increased productivity on simple tasks and decreased productivity on complex tasks in the presence of others.

In The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life (1959), Erving Goffman assumes that individuals can control how they are perceived by others. He suggests that people fear being perceived as having negative, undesirable qualities and characteristics by other people, and that it is this fear that compels individuals to portray a positive self-presentation/social image of themselves. In relation to performance gains, Goffman&#x27;s self-presentation theory predicts, in situations where they may be evaluated, individuals will consequently increase their efforts in order to project/preserve/maintain a positive image.

Distraction-conflict theory contends that when a person is working in the presence of other people, an interference effect occurs splitting the individual&#x27;s attention between the task and the other person. On simple tasks, where the individual is not challenged by the task, the interference effect is negligible and performance, therefore, is facilitated. On more complex tasks, where drive is not strong enough to effectively compete against the effects of distraction, there is no performance gain. The Stroop task (Stroop effect) demonstrated that, by narrowing a person&#x27;s focus of attention on certain tasks, distractions can improve performance.

Social orientation theory considers the way a person approaches social situations. It predicts that self-confident individuals with a positive outlook will show performance gains through social facilitation, whereas a self-conscious individual approaching social situations with apprehension is less likely to perform well due to social interference effects.

==Intergroup dynamics==
&quot;Intergroup dynamics&quot; (or intergroup relations) refers to the behavioural and psychological relationship between two or more groups. This includes perceptions, attitudes, opinions, and behaviours towards one&#x27;s own group, as well as those towards another group. In some cases, intergroup dynamics is prosocial, positive, and beneficial (for example, when multiple research teams work together to accomplish a task or goal). In other cases, intergroup dynamics can create conflict. For example, Fischer &amp; Ferlie found initially positive dynamics between a clinical institution and its external authorities dramatically changed to a &#x27;hot&#x27; and intractable conflict when authorities interfered with its embedded clinical model. Similarly, underlying the 1999 Columbine High School shooting in Littleton, Colorado, United States, intergroup dynamics played a significant role in Eric Harris’ and Dylan Klebold’s decision to kill a teacher and 14 students (including themselves).

===Intergroup conflict===
According to social identity theory, intergroup conflict starts with a process of comparison between individuals in one group (the ingroup) to those of another group (the outgroup). This comparison process is not unbiased and objective. Instead, it is a mechanism for enhancing one&#x27;s self-esteem. In the process of such comparisons, an individual tends to:

* favour the ingroup over the outgroup
* exaggerate and overgeneralize the differences between the ingroup and the outgroup (to enhance group distinctiveness)
* minimize the perception of differences between ingroup members
* remember more detailed and positive information about the ingroup, and more negative information about the outgroup

Even without any intergroup interaction (as in the minimal group paradigm), individuals begin to show favouritism towards their own group, and negative reactions towards the outgroup. This conflict can result in prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination. Intergroup conflict can be highly competitive, especially for social groups with a long history of conflict (for example, the 1994 Rwandan genocide, rooted in group conflict between the ethnic Hutu and Tutsi). In contrast, intergroup competition can sometimes be relatively harmless, particularly in situations where there is little history of conflict (for example, between students of different universities) leading to relatively harmless generalizations and mild competitive behaviours. Intergroup conflict is commonly recognized amidst racial, ethnic, religious, and political groups.

The formation of intergroup conflict was investigated in a popular series of studies by Muzafer Sherif and colleagues in 1961, called the Robbers Cave Experiment. The Robbers Cave Experiment was later used to support realistic conflict theory. Other prominent theories relating to intergroup conflict include social dominance theory, and social-/self-categorization theory.

===Intergroup conflict reduction===
There have been several strategies developed for reducing the tension, bias, prejudice, and conflict between social groups. These include the &quot;contact hypothesis&quot;, the &quot;jigsaw classroom&quot;, and several categorization-based strategies.

====Contact hypothesis (intergroup contact theory)====
In 1954, Gordon Allport suggested that by promoting contact between groups, prejudice can be reduced. Further, he suggested four optimal conditions for contact: equal status between the groups in the situation; common goals; intergroup cooperation; and the support of authorities, law, or customs. Since then, over 500 studies have been done on prejudice reduction under variations of the contact hypothesis, and a meta-analytic review suggests overall support for its efficacy. In some cases, even without the four optimal conditions outlined by Allport, prejudice between groups can be reduced.

====Superordinate identities====
Under the contact hypothesis, several models have been developed. A number of these models utilize a &quot;superordinate identity&quot; to reduce prejudice. That is, a more broadly defined, ‘umbrella’ group/identity that includes the groups that are in conflict. By emphasizing this superordinate identity, individuals in both subgroups can share a common social identity. For example, if there is conflict between White, Black, and Latino students in a high school, one might try to emphasize the ‘high school’ group/identity that students share to reduce conflict between the groups. Models utilizing superordinate identities include the common ingroup identity model, the ingroup projection model, the mutual intergroup differentiation model, and the ingroup identity model. Similarly, &quot;recategorization&quot; is a broader term used by Gaertner et al. to describe the strategies aforementioned.

====Interdependence====
There are techniques that utilize interdependence, between two or more groups, with the aim of reducing prejudice. That is, members across groups have to rely on one another to accomplish some goal or task. In the Robbers Cave Experiment, Sherif used this strategy to reduce conflict between groups. Elliot Aronson’s Jigsaw Classroom also uses this strategy of interdependence. In 1971, thick racial tensions were abounding in Austin, Texas. Aronson was brought in to examine the nature of this tension within schools, and to devise a strategy for reducing it (so to improve the process of school integration, mandated under Brown v. Board of Education in 1954). Despite strong evidence for the effectiveness of the &quot;jigsaw classroom,&quot; the strategy was not widely used (arguably because of strong attitudes existing outside of the schools, which still resisted the notion that racial and ethnic minority groups are equal to Whites and, similarly, should be integrated into schools).

<doc id="157898" wikidata="Q7364" url="?curid=157898" title="Eye">
<text>An eye is a sensory organ that allows an organism to perceive visual information. It detects light and converts it into electro-chemical impulses in neurons (neurones). It is part of an organism&#x27;s visual system.

In higher organisms, the eye is a complex optical system that collects light from the surrounding environment, regulates its intensity through a diaphragm, focuses it through an adjustable assembly of lenses to form an image, converts this image into a set of electrical signals, and transmits these signals to the brain through neural pathways that connect the eye via the optic nerve to the visual cortex and other areas of the brain.

Eyes with resolving power have come in ten fundamentally different forms, classified into compound eyes and non-compound eyes. Compound eyes are made up of multiple small visual units, and are common on insects and crustaceans. Non-compound eyes have a single lens and focus light onto the retina to form a single image. This type of eye is common in mammals, including humans.

The simplest eyes are pit eyes. They are eye-spots which may be set into a pit to reduce the angle of light that enters and affects the eye-spot, to allow the organism to deduce the angle of incoming light.

Eyes enable several photo response functions that are independent of vision. In an organism that has more complex eyes, retinal photosensitive ganglion cells send signals along the retinohypothalamic tract to the suprachiasmatic nuclei to effect circadian adjustment and to the pretectal area to control the pupillary light reflex.

==Overview==
Complex eyes distinguish shapes and colours. The visual fields of many organisms, especially predators, involve large areas of binocular vision for depth perception. In other organisms, particularly prey animals, eyes are located to maximise the field of view, such as in rabbits and horses, which have monocular vision.

The first proto-eyes evolved among animals about the time of the Cambrian explosion. The last common ancestor of animals possessed the biochemical toolkit necessary for vision, and more advanced eyes have evolved in 96% of animal species in six of the ~35 main phyla. In most vertebrates and some molluscs, the eye allows light to enter and project onto a light-sensitive layer of cells known as the retina. The cone cells (for colour) and the rod cells (for low-light contrasts) in the retina detect and convert light into neural signals which are transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve to produce vision. Such eyes are typically spheroid, filled with the transparent gel-like vitreous humour, possess a focusing lens, and often an iris. Muscles around the iris change the size of the pupil, regulating the amount of light that enters the eye and reducing aberrations when there is enough light. The eyes of most cephalopods, fish, amphibians and snakes have fixed lens shapes, and focusing is achieved by telescoping the lens in a similar manner to that of a camera.

The compound eyes of the arthropods are composed of many simple facets which, depending on anatomical detail, may give either a single pixelated image or multiple images per eye. Each sensor has its own lens and photosensitive cell(s). Some eyes have up to 28,000 such sensors arranged hexagonally, which can give a full 360° field of vision. Compound eyes are very sensitive to motion. Some arthropods, including many Strepsiptera, have compound eyes of only a few facets, each with a retina capable of creating an image. With each eye producing a different image, a fused, high-resolution image is produced in the brain.

The mantis shrimp has the world&#x27;s most complex colour vision system. It has detailed hyperspectral colour vision.

Trilobites, now extinct, had unique compound eyes. Clear calcite crystals formed the lenses of their eyes. They differ in this from most other arthropods, which have soft eyes. The number of lenses in such an eye varied widely; some trilobites had only one while others had thousands of lenses per eye.

In contrast to compound eyes, simple eyes have a single lens. Jumping spiders have one pair of large simple eyes with a narrow field of view, augmented by an array of smaller eyes for peripheral vision. Some insect larvae, like caterpillars, have a type of simple eye (stemmata) which usually provides only a rough image, but (as in sawfly larvae) can possess resolving powers of 4 degrees of arc, be polarization-sensitive, and capable of increasing its absolute sensitivity at night by a factor of 1,000 or more. Ocelli, some of the simplest eyes, are found in animals such as some of the snails. They have photosensitive cells but no lens or other means of projecting an image onto those cells. They can distinguish between light and dark but no more, enabling them to avoid direct sunlight. In organisms dwelling near deep-sea vents, compound eyes are adapted to see the infra-red light produced by the hot vents, allowing the creatures to avoid being boiled alive.

==Types==
There are ten different eye layouts. Eye types can be categorised into &quot;simple eyes&quot;, with one concave photoreceptive surface, and &quot;compound eyes&quot;, which comprise a number of individual lenses laid out on a convex surface. &quot;Simple&quot; does not imply a reduced level of complexity or acuity. Indeed, any eye type can be adapted for almost any behaviour or environment. The only limitations specific to eye types are that of resolution—the physics of compound eyes prevents them from achieving a resolution better than 1°. Also, superposition eyes can achieve greater sensitivity than apposition eyes, so are better suited to dark-dwelling creatures.

Eyes also fall into two groups on the basis of their photoreceptor&#x27;s cellular construction, with the photoreceptor cells either being ciliated (as in the vertebrates) or rhabdomeric. These two groups are not monophyletic; the Cnidaria also possess ciliated cells, and some gastropods and annelids possess both.

Some organisms have photosensitive cells that do nothing but detect whether the surroundings are light or dark, which is sufficient for the entrainment of circadian rhythms. These are not considered eyes because they lack enough structure to be considered an organ, and do not produce an image.

Every technological method of capturing an optical image that humans commonly use occurs in nature, with the exception of zoom and Fresnel lenses.

===Non-compound eyes===
Simple eyes are rather ubiquitous, and lens-bearing eyes have evolved at least seven times in vertebrates, cephalopods, annelids, crustaceans and Cubozoa.

====Pit eyes====
Pit eyes, also known as stemmata, are eye-spots which may be set into a pit to reduce the angles of light that enters and affects the eye-spot, to allow the organism to deduce the angle of incoming light. Found in about 85% of phyla, these basic forms were probably the precursors to more advanced types of &quot;simple eyes&quot;. They are small, comprising up to about 100 cells covering about 100 μm. The directionality can be improved by reducing the size of the aperture, by incorporating a reflective layer behind the receptor cells, or by filling the pit with a refractile material.

Pit vipers have developed pits that function as eyes by sensing thermal infra-red radiation, in addition to their optical wavelength eyes like those of other vertebrates (see infrared sensing in snakes). However, pit organs are fitted with receptors rather different from photoreceptors, namely a specific transient receptor potential channel (TRP channels) called TRPV1. The main difference is that photoreceptors are G-protein coupled receptors but TRP are ion channels.

====Spherical lens eye====
The resolution of pit eyes can be greatly improved by incorporating a material with a higher refractive index to form a lens, which may greatly reduce the blur radius encountered—hence increasing the resolution obtainable. The most basic form, seen in some gastropods and annelids, consists of a lens of one refractive index. A far sharper image can be obtained using materials with a high refractive index, decreasing to the edges; this decreases the focal length and thus allows a sharp image to form on the retina. This also allows a larger aperture for a given sharpness of image, allowing more light to enter the lens; and a flatter lens, reducing spherical aberration. Such a non-homogeneous lens is necessary for the focal length to drop from about 4 times the lens radius, to 2.5 radii.

So-called under-focused lens eyes, found in gastropods and polychaete worms, have eyes that are intermediate between lens-less cup eyes and real camera eyes. Also box jellyfish have eyes with a spherical lens, cornea and retina, but the vision is blurry.

Heterogeneous eyes have evolved at least nine times: four or more times in gastropods, once in the copepods, once in the annelids, once in the cephalopods, and once in the chitons, which have aragonite lenses. No extant aquatic organisms possess homogeneous lenses; presumably the evolutionary pressure for a heterogeneous lens is great enough for this stage to be quickly &quot;outgrown&quot;.

This eye creates an image that is sharp enough that motion of the eye can cause significant blurring. To minimise the effect of eye motion while the animal moves, most such eyes have stabilising eye muscles.

The ocelli of insects bear a simple lens, but their focal point usually lies behind the retina; consequently, those can not form a sharp image. Ocelli (pit-type eyes of arthropods) blur the image across the whole retina, and are consequently excellent at responding to rapid changes in light intensity across the whole visual field; this fast response is further accelerated by the large nerve bundles which rush the information to the brain. Focusing the image would also cause the sun&#x27;s image to be focused on a few receptors, with the possibility of damage under the intense light; shielding the receptors would block out some light and thus reduce their sensitivity. This fast response has led to suggestions that the ocelli of insects are used mainly in flight, because they can be used to detect sudden changes in which way is up (because light, especially UV light which is absorbed by vegetation, usually comes from above).

====Multiple lenses====
Some marine organisms bear more than one lens; for instance the copepod &quot;Pontella&quot; has three. The outer has a parabolic surface, countering the effects of spherical aberration while allowing a sharp image to be formed. Another copepod, &quot;Copilia&quot;, has two lenses in each eye, arranged like those in a telescope. Such arrangements are rare and poorly understood, but represent an alternative construction.

Multiple lenses are seen in some hunters such as eagles and jumping spiders, which have a refractive cornea: these have a negative lens, enlarging the observed image by up to 50% over the receptor cells, thus increasing their optical resolution.

====Refractive cornea====

In the eyes of most mammals, birds, reptiles, and most other terrestrial vertebrates (along with spiders and some insect larvae) the vitreous fluid has a higher refractive index than the air. In general, the lens is not spherical. Spherical lenses produce spherical aberration. In refractive corneas, the lens tissue is corrected with inhomogeneous lens material (see Luneburg lens), or with an aspheric shape. Flattening the lens has a disadvantage; the quality of vision is diminished away from the main line of focus. Thus, animals that have evolved with a wide field-of-view often have eyes that make use of an inhomogeneous lens.

As mentioned above, a refractive cornea is only useful out of water. In water, there is little difference in refractive index between the vitreous fluid and the surrounding water. Hence creatures that have returned to the water—penguins and seals, for example—lose their highly curved cornea and return to lens-based vision. An alternative solution, borne by some divers, is to have a very strongly focusing cornea.

A unique feature of most mammal eyes is the presence of eyelids which wipe the eye and spread tears across the cornea to prevent dehydration. These eyelids are also supplemented by the presence of eyelashes, multiple rows of highly innervated and sensitive hairs which grow from the eyelid margins to protect the eye from fine particles and small irritants such as insects.

====Reflector eyes====
An alternative to a lens is to line the inside of the eye with &quot;mirrors&quot;, and reflect the image to focus at a central point. The nature of these eyes means that if one were to peer into the pupil of an eye, one would see the same image that the organism would see, reflected back out.

Many small organisms such as rotifers, copepods and flatworms use such organs, but these are too small to produce usable images. Some larger organisms, such as scallops, also use reflector eyes. The scallop &quot;Pecten&quot; has up to 100 millimetre-scale reflector eyes fringing the edge of its shell. It detects moving objects as they pass successive lenses.

There is at least one vertebrate, the spookfish, whose eyes include reflective optics for focusing of light. Each of the two eyes of a spookfish collects light from both above and below; the light coming from above is focused by a lens, while that coming from below, by a curved mirror composed of many layers of small reflective plates made of guanine crystals.

===Compound eyes===


A compound eye may consist of thousands of individual photoreceptor units or ommatidia (ommatidium, singular). The image perceived is a combination of inputs from the numerous ommatidia (individual &quot;eye units&quot;), which are located on a convex surface, thus pointing in slightly different directions. Compared with simple eyes, compound eyes possess a very large view angle, and can detect fast movement and, in some cases, the polarisation of light. Because the individual lenses are so small, the effects of diffraction impose a limit on the possible resolution that can be obtained (assuming that they do not function as phased arrays). This can only be countered by increasing lens size and number. To see with a resolution comparable to our simple eyes, humans would require very large compound eyes, around in radius.

Compound eyes fall into two groups: apposition eyes, which form multiple inverted images, and superposition eyes, which form a single erect image. Compound eyes are common in arthropods, annelids and some bivalved molluscs. Compound eyes in arthropods grow at their margins by the addition of new ommatidia.

====Apposition eyes====
Apposition eyes are the most common form of eyes and are presumably the ancestral form of compound eyes. They are found in all arthropod groups, although they may have evolved more than once within this phylum. Some annelids and bivalves also have apposition eyes. They are also possessed by &quot;Limulus&quot;, the horseshoe crab, and there are suggestions that other chelicerates developed their simple eyes by reduction from a compound starting point. (Some caterpillars appear to have evolved compound eyes from simple eyes in the opposite fashion.)

Apposition eyes work by gathering a number of images, one from each eye, and combining them in the brain, with each eye typically contributing a single point of information. The typical apposition eye has a lens focusing light from one direction on the rhabdom, while light from other directions is absorbed by the dark wall of the ommatidium.

====Superposition eyes====
The second type is named the superposition eye. The superposition eye is divided into three types:
* refracting,
* reflecting and
* parabolic superposition

The refracting superposition eye has a gap between the lens and the rhabdom, and no side wall. Each lens takes light at an angle to its axis and reflects it to the same angle on the other side. The result is an image at half the radius of the eye, which is where the tips of the rhabdoms are. This type of compound eye, for which a minimal size exists below which effective superposition cannot occur, is normally found in nocturnal insects, because it can create images up to 1000 times brighter than equivalent apposition eyes, though at the cost of reduced resolution. In the parabolic superposition compound eye type, seen in arthropods such as mayflies, the parabolic surfaces of the inside of each facet focus light from a reflector to a sensor array. Long-bodied decapod crustaceans such as shrimp, prawns, crayfish and lobsters are alone in having reflecting superposition eyes, which also have a transparent gap but use corner mirrors instead of lenses.

====Parabolic superposition====
This eye type functions by refracting light, then using a parabolic mirror to focus the image; it combines features of superposition and apposition eyes.

====Other====
Another kind of compound eye, found in males of Order Strepsiptera, employs a series of simple eyes—eyes having one opening that provides light for an entire image-forming retina. Several of these &quot;eyelets&quot; together form the strepsipteran compound eye, which is similar to the &#x27;schizochroal&#x27; compound eyes of some trilobites. Because each eyelet is a simple eye, it produces an inverted image; those images are combined in the brain to form one unified image. Because the aperture of an eyelet is larger than the facets of a compound eye, this arrangement allows vision under low light levels.

Good fliers such as flies or honey bees, or prey-catching insects such as praying mantis or dragonflies, have specialised zones of ommatidia organised into a fovea area which gives acute vision. In the acute zone, the eyes are flattened and the facets larger. The flattening allows more ommatidia to receive light from a spot and therefore higher resolution. The black spot that can be seen on the compound eyes of such insects, which always seems to look directly at the observer, is called a pseudopupil. This occurs because the ommatidia which one observes &quot;head-on&quot; (along their optical axes) absorb the incident light, while those to one side reflect it.

There are some exceptions from the types mentioned above. Some insects have a so-called single lens compound eye, a transitional type which is something between a superposition type of the multi-lens compound eye and the single lens eye found in animals with simple eyes. Then there is the mysid shrimp, &quot;Dioptromysis paucispinosa&quot;. The shrimp has an eye of the refracting superposition type, in the rear behind this in each eye there is a single large facet that is three times in diameter the others in the eye and behind this is an enlarged crystalline cone. This projects an upright image on a specialised retina. The resulting eye is a mixture of a simple eye within a compound eye.

Another version is a compound eye often referred to as &quot;pseudofaceted&quot;, as seen in &quot;Scutigera&quot;. This type of eye consists of a cluster of numerous ommatidia on each side of the head, organised in a way that resembles a true compound eye.

The body of &quot;Ophiocoma wendtii&quot;, a type of brittle star, is covered with ommatidia, turning its whole skin into a compound eye. The same is true of many chitons. The tube feet of sea urchins contain photoreceptor proteins, which together act as a compound eye; they lack screening pigments, but can detect the directionality of light by the shadow cast by its opaque body.

====Nutrients====
The ciliary body is triangular in horizontal section and is coated by a double layer, the ciliary epithelium. The inner layer is transparent and covers the vitreous body, and is continuous from the neural tissue of the retina. The outer layer is highly pigmented, continuous with the retinal pigment epithelium, and constitutes the cells of the dilator muscle.

The vitreous is the transparent, colourless, gelatinous mass that fills the space between the lens of the eye and the retina lining the back of the eye. It is produced by certain retinal cells. It is of rather similar composition to the cornea, but contains very few cells (mostly phagocytes which remove unwanted cellular debris in the visual field, as well as the hyalocytes of Balazs of the surface of the vitreous, which reprocess the hyaluronic acid), no blood vessels, and 98–99% of its volume is water (as opposed to 75% in the cornea) with salts, sugars, vitrosin (a type of collagen), a network of collagen type II fibres with the mucopolysaccharide hyaluronic acid, and also a wide array of proteins in micro amounts. Amazingly, with so little solid matter, it tautly holds the eye.

Photoreception is phylogenetically very old, with various theories of phylogenesis. The common origin (monophyly) of all animal eyes is now widely accepted as fact. This is based upon the shared genetic features of all eyes; that is, all modern eyes, varied as they are, have their origins in a proto-eye believed to have evolved some 650-600 million years ago, and the PAX6 gene is considered a key factor in this. The majority of the advancements in early eyes are believed to have taken only a few million years to develop, since the first predator to gain true imaging would have touched off an &quot;arms race&quot; among all species that did not flee the photopic environment. Prey animals and competing predators alike would be at a distinct disadvantage without such capabilities and would be less likely to survive and reproduce. Hence multiple eye types and subtypes developed in parallel (except those of groups, such as the vertebrates, that were only forced into the photopic environment at a late stage).

Eyes in various animals show adaptation to their requirements. For example, the eye of a bird of prey has much greater visual acuity than a human eye, and in some cases can detect ultraviolet radiation. The different forms of eye in, for example, vertebrates and molluscs are examples of parallel evolution, despite their distant common ancestry. Phenotypic convergence of the geometry of cephalopod and most vertebrate eyes creates the impression that the vertebrate eye evolved from an imaging cephalopod eye, but this is not the case, as the reversed roles of their respective ciliary and rhabdomeric opsin classes and different lens crystallins show.

The very earliest &quot;eyes&quot;, called eye-spots, were simple patches of photoreceptor protein in unicellular animals. In multicellular beings, multicellular eyespots evolved, physically similar to the receptor patches for taste and smell. These eyespots could only sense ambient brightness: they could distinguish light and dark, but not the direction of the light source.

Through gradual change, the eye-spots of species living in well-lit environments depressed into a shallow &quot;cup&quot; shape. The ability to slightly discriminate directional brightness was achieved by using the angle at which the light hit certain cells to identify the source. The pit deepened over time, the opening diminished in size, and the number of photoreceptor cells increased, forming an effective pinhole camera that was capable of dimly distinguishing shapes. However, the ancestors of modern hagfish, thought to be the protovertebrate, were evidently pushed to very deep, dark waters, where they were less vulnerable to sighted predators, and where it is advantageous to have a convex eye-spot, which gathers more light than a flat or concave one. This would have led to a somewhat different evolutionary trajectory for the vertebrate eye than for other animal eyes.

The thin overgrowth of transparent cells over the eye&#x27;s aperture, originally formed to prevent damage to the eyespot, allowed the segregated contents of the eye chamber to specialise into a transparent humour that optimised colour filtering, blocked harmful radiation, improved the eye&#x27;s refractive index, and allowed functionality outside of water. The transparent protective cells eventually split into two layers, with circulatory fluid in between that allowed wider viewing angles and greater imaging resolution, and the thickness of the transparent layer gradually increased, in most species with the transparent crystallin protein.

The gap between tissue layers naturally formed a biconvex shape, an optimally ideal structure for a normal refractive index. Independently, a transparent layer and a nontransparent layer split forward from the lens: the cornea and iris. Separation of the forward layer again formed a humour, the aqueous humour. This increased refractive power and again eased circulatory problems. Formation of a nontransparent ring allowed more blood vessels, more circulation, and larger eye sizes.

===Relationship to life requirements===
Eyes are generally adapted to the environment and life requirements of the organism which bears them. For instance, the distribution of photoreceptors tends to match the area in which the highest acuity is required, with horizon-scanning organisms, such as those that live on the African plains, having a horizontal line of high-density ganglia, while tree-dwelling creatures which require good all-round vision tend to have a symmetrical distribution of ganglia, with acuity decreasing outwards from the centre.

Of course, for most eye types, it is impossible to diverge from a spherical form, so only the density of optical receptors can be altered. In organisms with compound eyes, it is the number of ommatidia rather than ganglia that reflects the region of highest data acquisition. Optical superposition eyes are constrained to a spherical shape, but other forms of compound eyes may deform to a shape where more ommatidia are aligned to, say, the horizon, without altering the size or density of individual ommatidia. Eyes of horizon-scanning organisms have stalks so they can be easily aligned to the horizon when this is inclined, for example, if the animal is on a slope.

An extension of this concept is that the eyes of predators typically have a zone of very acute vision at their centre, to assist in the identification of prey. In deep water organisms, it may not be the centre of the eye that is enlarged. The hyperiid amphipods are deep water animals that feed on organisms above them. Their eyes are almost divided into two, with the upper region thought to be involved in detecting the silhouettes of potential prey—or predators—against the faint light of the sky above. Accordingly, deeper water hyperiids, where the light against which the silhouettes must be compared is dimmer, have larger &quot;upper-eyes&quot;, and may lose the lower portion of their eyes altogether. In the giant Antarctic isopod Glyptonotus a small ventral compound eye is physically completely separated from the much larger dorsal compound eye. Depth perception can be enhanced by having eyes which are enlarged in one direction; distorting the eye slightly allows the distance to the object to be estimated with a high degree of accuracy.

Acuity is higher among male organisms that mate in mid-air, as they need to be able to spot and assess potential mates against a very large backdrop. On the other hand, the eyes of organisms which operate in low light levels, such as around dawn and dusk or in deep water, tend to be larger to increase the amount of light that can be captured.

It is not only the shape of the eye that may be affected by lifestyle. Eyes can be the most visible parts of organisms, and this can act as a pressure on organisms to have more transparent eyes at the cost of function.

Eyes may be mounted on stalks to provide better all-round vision, by lifting them above an organism&#x27;s carapace; this also allows them to track predators or prey without moving the head.

==Physiology==

===Visual acuity===
Visual acuity, or resolving power, is &quot;the ability to distinguish fine detail&quot; and is the property of cone cells. It is often measured in &quot;cycles per degree&quot; (CPD), which measures an angular resolution, or how much an eye can differentiate one object from another in terms of visual angles. Resolution in CPD can be measured by bar charts of different numbers of white/black stripe cycles. For example, if each pattern is 1.75 cm wide and is placed at 1 m distance from the eye, it will subtend an angle of 1 degree, so the number of white/black bar pairs on the pattern will be a measure of the cycles per degree of that pattern. The highest such number that the eye can resolve as stripes, or distinguish from a grey block, is then the measurement of visual acuity of the eye.

For a human eye with excellent acuity, the maximum theoretical resolution is 50 CPD (1.2 arcminute per line pair, or a 0.35 mm line pair, at 1 m). A rat can resolve only about 1 to 2 CPD. A horse has higher acuity through most of the visual field of its eyes than a human has, but does not match the high acuity of the human eye&#x27;s central fovea region.

Spherical aberration limits the resolution of a 7 mm pupil to about 3 arcminutes per line pair. At a pupil diameter of 3 mm, the spherical aberration is greatly reduced, resulting in an improved resolution of approximately 1.7 arcminutes per line pair. A resolution of 2 arcminutes per line pair, equivalent to a 1 arcminute gap in an optotype, corresponds to 20/20 (normal vision) in humans.

However, in the compound eye, the resolution is related to the size of individual ommatidia and the distance between neighbouring ommatidia. Physically these cannot be reduced in size to achieve the acuity seen with single lensed eyes as in mammals. Compound eyes have a much lower acuity than vertebrate eyes.

===Colour perception===

&quot;Colour vision is the faculty of the organism to distinguish lights of different spectral qualities.&quot; All organisms are restricted to a small range of electromagnetic spectrum; this varies from creature to creature, but is mainly between wavelengths of 400 and 700 nm. This is a rather small section of the electromagnetic spectrum, probably reflecting the submarine evolution of the organ: water blocks out all but two small windows of the EM spectrum, and there has been no evolutionary pressure among land animals to broaden this range.

The most sensitive pigment, rhodopsin, has a peak response at 500 nm. Small changes to the genes coding for this protein can tweak the peak response by a few nm; pigments in the lens can also filter incoming light, changing the peak response. Many organisms are unable to discriminate between colours, seeing instead in shades of grey; colour vision necessitates a range of pigment cells which are primarily sensitive to smaller ranges of the spectrum. In primates, geckos, and other organisms, these take the form of cone cells, from which the more sensitive rod cells evolved. Even if organisms are physically capable of discriminating different colours, this does not necessarily mean that they can perceive the different colours; only with behavioural tests can this be deduced.

Most organisms with colour vision can detect ultraviolet light. This high energy light can be damaging to receptor cells. With a few exceptions (snakes, placental mammals), most organisms avoid these effects by having absorbent oil droplets around their cone cells. The alternative, developed by organisms that had lost these oil droplets in the course of evolution, is to make the lens impervious to UV light—this precludes the possibility of any UV light being detected, as it does not even reach the retina.

===Rods and cones===
The retina contains two major types of light-sensitive photoreceptor cells used for vision: the rods and the cones.

Rods cannot distinguish colours, but are responsible for low-light (scotopic) monochrome (black-and-white) vision; they work well in dim light as they contain a pigment, rhodopsin (visual purple), which is sensitive at low light intensity, but saturates at higher (photopic) intensities. Rods are distributed throughout the retina but there are none at the fovea and none at the blind spot. Rod density is greater in the peripheral retina than in the central retina.

Cones are responsible for colour vision. They require brighter light to function than rods require. In humans, there are three types of cones, maximally sensitive to long-wavelength, medium-wavelength, and short-wavelength light (often referred to as red, green, and blue, respectively, though the sensitivity peaks are not actually at these colours). The colour seen is the combined effect of stimuli to, and responses from, these three types of cone cells. Cones are mostly concentrated in and near the fovea. Only a few are present at the sides of the retina. Objects are seen most sharply in focus when their images fall on the fovea, as when one looks at an object directly. Cone cells and rods are connected through intermediate cells in the retina to nerve fibres of the optic nerve. When rods and cones are stimulated by light, they connect through adjoining cells within the retina to send an electrical signal to the optic nerve fibres. The optic nerves send off impulses through these fibres to the brain.

==Pigmentation==
The pigment molecules used in the eye are various, but can be used to define the evolutionary distance between different groups, and can also be an aid in determining which are closely related—although problems of convergence do exist.

Opsins are the pigments involved in photoreception. Other pigments, such as melanin, are used to shield the photoreceptor cells from light leaking in from the sides. The opsin protein group evolved long before the last common ancestor of animals, and has continued to diversify since.

There are two types of opsin involved in vision; c-opsins, which are associated with ciliary-type photoreceptor cells, and r-opsins, associated with rhabdomeric photoreceptor cells. The eyes of vertebrates usually contain ciliary cells with c-opsins, and (bilaterian) invertebrates have rhabdomeric cells in the eye with r-opsins. However, some &quot;ganglion&quot; cells of vertebrates express r-opsins, suggesting that their ancestors used this pigment in vision, and that remnants survive in the eyes. Likewise, c-opsins have been found to be expressed in the &quot;brain&quot; of some invertebrates. They may have been expressed in ciliary cells of larval eyes, which were subsequently resorbed into the brain on metamorphosis to the adult form. C-opsins are also found in some derived bilaterian-invertebrate eyes, such as the pallial eyes of the bivalve molluscs; however, the lateral eyes (which were presumably the ancestral type for this group, if eyes evolved once there) always use r-opsins. Cnidaria, which are an outgroup to the taxa mentioned above, express c-opsins—but r-opsins are yet to be found in this group. Incidentally, the melanin produced in the cnidaria is produced in the same fashion as that in vertebrates, suggesting the common descent of this pigment.

<text>Crowd psychology (or mob psychology) is a subfield of social psychology which examines how the psychology of a group of people differs from the psychology of any one person within the group. The study of crowd psychology looks into the actions and thought processes of both the individual members of the crowd and of the crowd as a collective social entity. The behavior of a crowd is much influenced by deindividuation (seen as a person&#x27;s loss of responsibility)
and by the person&#x27;s impression of the universality of behavior, both of which conditions increase in magnitude with size of the crowd. Notable theorists in crowd psychology include Gustave Le Bon (1841-1931), Gabriel Tarde (1843-1904), and Sigmund Freud (1856-1939). Many of these theories are today tested or used to simulate crowd behaviors in normal or emergency situations. One of the main focuses in these simulation works aims to prevent crowd crushes and stampedes.

==Origins==
According to his biological theory of criminology suggests that criminality is inherited and that someone “born criminal” could be identified by the way they look Enrico Ferri expressed his view of crime as degeneration more profound than insanity, for in most insane persons the primitive moral sense has survived the wreck of their intelligence. Along similar lines were the remarks of Benedickt, Sergi and Marro. A response from the French, who put forward an environmental theory of human psychology, M. Anguilli called attention to the importance of the influence of the social environment upon crime. Professor Alexandre Lacassagne thought that the atavistic and degenerative theories as held by the Italian school were exaggerations and false interpretations of the facts, and that the important factor was the social environment.&quot;
In Paris during 10–17 August 1889, the Italian school received a stronger rebuke of their biological theories during the 2nd International Congress of Criminal Anthropology. A radical divergence in the views between the Italian and the French schools was reflected in the proceedings.
: &quot;Professor Lombroso laid stress upon epilepsy in connection with his theory of the &#x27;born criminal&#x27;. Professor Léonce Pierre Manouvrier characterized Lombroso&#x27;s theory as nothing but the exploded science of phrenology. The anomalies observed by Lombroso were met with in honest men as well as criminals, Manouvrier claimed, and there is no physical difference between them. Baron Raffaele Garofalo, Drill, Alexandre Lacassagne and Benedikt opposed Lombroso&#x27;s theories in whole or in part. Pugliese found the cause of crime in the failure of the criminal to adapt himself to his social surroundings, and Benedikt, with whom Tarde agreed, held that physical defects were not marks of the criminal qua criminal.&quot; It is in this context that you have a debate between Scipio Sighele, an Italian lawyer and Gabriel Tarde, a French magistrate on how to determine criminal responsibility in the crowd and hence who to arrest. (Sighele, 1892; Tarde, 1890, 1892, 1901) Both thinkers had published early studies on this matter (Sighele wrote &quot;The Criminal Crowd&quot;, and Tarde &quot;La criminalité comparée&quot;.)

Earlier, literature on crowds and crowd behavior had appeared as early as 1841, with the publication of Charles Mackay&#x27;s book &quot;Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds&quot;. The attitude towards crowds underwent an adjustment with the publication of Hippolyte Taine&#x27;s six-volume &quot;The Origins of Contemporary France&quot; (1875). In particular Taine&#x27;s work helped to change the opinions of his contemporaries on the actions taken by the crowds during the 1789 Revolution. Many Europeans held him in great esteem. While it is difficult to directly link his works to crowd behavior, it may be said that his thoughts stimulated further study of crowd behavior. However, it was not until the latter half of the 19th century that scientific interest in the field gained momentum. French physician and anthropologist Gustave Le Bon became its most-influential theorist.

==Types of crowds==

There is limited research into the types of crowd and crowd membership and there is no consensus as to the classification of types of crowds. Two recent scholars, Momboisse (1967) and Berlonghi (1995) focused upon purpose of existence to differentiate among crowds. Momboisse developed a system of four types: casual, conventional, expressive, and aggressive. Berlonghi classified crowds as spectator, demonstrator, or escaping, to correlate to the purpose for gathering.

Another approach to classifying crowds is sociologist Herbert Blumer&#x27;s system of emotional intensity. He distinguishes four types of crowds: casual, conventional, expressive, and active. A group of people who just so happen to be at the same location at the same time is known as a casual crowd. This kind of mob lacks any true identity, long-term goal, or shared connection. A group of individuals who come together for a particular reason is known as a conventional crowd. They could be going to a theater, concert, movie, or lecture. According to Erich Goode, conventional crowds behave in a very conventional and hence somewhat structured manner; as their name suggests, they do not truly act out collective behavior. A group of people who come together solely to show their excitement and feelings is known as an expressive crowd. A political candidate&#x27;s rally, a religious revival, and celebrations like Mardi Gras are a few examples.  An active crowd behaves violently or in other damaging ways, such looting, going above and beyond an expressive crowd. One of the main examples of an acting crowd is a mob, which is an extremely emotional group that either commits or is prepared to do violence. A crowd changes its level of emotional intensity over time, and therefore, can be classed in any one of the four types.

Generally, researchers in crowd psychology have focused on the negative aspects of crowds, but not all crowds are volatile or negative in nature. For example, in the beginning of the socialist movement crowds were asked to put on their Sunday dress and march silently down the street. A more-modern example involves the sit-ins during the Civil Rights movement. Crowds can reflect and challenge the held ideologies of their sociocultural environment. They can also serve integrative social functions, creating temporary communities.

Crowds can be defined as active (&quot;mobs&quot;) or passive (&quot;audiences&quot;). Active crowds can be further divided into aggressive, escapist, acquisitive, or expressive mobs. Aggressive mobs are often violent and outwardly focused. Examples are football riots,the Los Angeles riots of 1992, and the 2011 English riots. Escapist mobs are characterized by a large number of people trying to get out of a dangerous situation like the November 2021 Astroworld Festival. Incidents involving crowds are often reported by media as the results of &quot;panic&quot;, but some experts have criticized the media&#x27;s implication that panic is a main cause of crowd disasters, noting that actual panic is relatively rare in fire situations, and that the major factors in dangerous crowd incidents are infrastructure design, crowd density and breakdowns in communication. Acquisitive mobs occur when large numbers of people are fighting for limited resources. An expressive mob is any other large group of people gathering for an active purpose. Civil disobedience, rock concerts, and religious revivals all fall under this category.

==Theoretical perspectives==

===Le Bon===
Gustave Le Bon held that crowds existed in three stages: submergence, contagion, and suggestion. During submergence, the individuals in the crowd lose their sense of individual self and personal responsibility. This is quite heavily induced by the anonymity of the crowd. Contagion refers to the propensity for individuals in a crowd to unquestioningly follow the predominant ideas and emotions of the crowd. In Le Bon&#x27;s view, this effect is capable of spreading between &quot;submerged&quot; individuals much like a disease. Suggestion refers to the period in which the ideas and emotions of the crowd are primarily drawn from a shared unconscious ideology. Crowd members become susceptible to any passing idea or emotion. This behavior comes from an archaic shared unconscious and is therefore uncivilized in nature. It is limited by the moral and cognitive abilities of the least capable members. Le Bon believed that crowds could be a powerful force only for destruction. Additionally, Le Bon and others have indicated that crowd members feel a lessened sense of legal culpability, due to the difficulty in prosecuting individual members of a mob. In short, the individual submerged in the crowd loses self control as the &quot;collective mind&quot; takes over and makes the crowd member capable of violating personal or social norms.

Le Bon&#x27;s idea that crowds foster anonymity and generate emotion has been contested by some critics. Clark McPhail points out studies which show that &quot;the madding crowd&quot; does not take on a life of its own, apart from the thoughts and intentions of members. Norris Johnson, after investigating a panic at a 1979 The Who concert concluded that the crowd was composed of many small groups of people mostly trying to help each other. Additionally, Le Bon&#x27;s theory ignores the socio-cultural context of the crowd, which some theorists argue can disempower social change. R. Brown disputes the assumption that crowds are homogenous, suggesting instead that participants exist on a continuum, differing in their ability to deviate from social norms.

===Freudian theory===
Sigmund Freud&#x27;s crowd behavior theory primarily consists of the idea that becoming a member of a crowd serves to unlock the unconscious mind. This occurs because the super-ego, or moral center of consciousness, is displaced by the larger crowd, to be replaced by a charismatic crowd leader. McDougall argues similarly to Freud, saying that simplistic emotions are widespread, and complex emotions are rarer. In a crowd, the overall shared emotional experience reverts to the least common denominator (LCD), leading to primitive levels of emotional expression. This organizational structure is that of the &quot;primal horde&quot;—pre-civilized society—and Freud states that one must rebel against the leader (re-instate the individual morality) in order to escape from it.

Theodor Adorno criticized the belief in a spontaneity of the masses: according to him, the masses were an artificial product of &quot;administrated&quot; modern life. The Ego of the bourgeois subject dissolved itself, giving way to the Id and the &quot;de-psychologized&quot; subject. Furthermore, Adorno stated the bond linking the masses to the leader through the spectacle is feigned:
&quot;When the leaders become conscious of mass psychology and take it into their own hands, it ceases to exist in a certain sense. ... Just as little as people believe in the depth of their hearts that the Jews are the devil, do they completely believe in their leader. They do not really identify themselves with him but act this identification, perform their own enthusiasm, and thus participate in their leader&#x27;s performance. ... It is probably the suspicion of this fictitiousness of their own &#x27;group psychology&#x27; which makes fascist crowds so merciless and unapproachable. If they would stop to reason for a second, the whole performance would go to pieces, and they would be left to panic.&quot;

===Deindividuation theory===
Deindividuation theory is largely based on the ideas of Gustave Le Bon and argues that in typical crowd situations, factors such as anonymity, group unity, and arousal can weaken personal controls (e.g. guilt, shame, self-evaluating behavior) by distancing people from their personal identities and reducing their concern for social evaluation. This lack of restraint increases individual sensitivity to the environment and lessens rational forethought, which can lead to antisocial behavior. More recent theories have stated that deindividuation hinges upon a person being unable, due to situation, to have strong awareness of their self as an object of attention. This lack of attention frees the individual from the necessity of normal social behavior.

American social psychologist Leon Festinger and colleagues first elaborated the concept of deindividuation in 1952. It was further refined by American psychologist Philip Zimbardo, who detailed why mental input and output became blurred by such factors as anonymity, lack of social constraints, and sensory overload. Zimbardo&#x27;s Stanford Prison Experiment has been presented as a strong argument for the power of deindividuation, although it was later criticised as unscientific. Further experimentation has had mixed results when it comes to aggressive behaviors, and has instead shown that the normative expectations surrounding the situations of deindividuation influence behavior (i.e. if one is deindividuated as a KKK member, aggression increases, but if it is as a nurse, aggression does not increase).

A further distinction has been proposed between public and private deindividuation. When private aspects of self are weakened, one becomes more subject to crowd impulses, but not necessarily in a negative way. It is when one no longer attends to the public reaction and judgement of individual behavior that antisocial behavior is elicited. Philip Zimbardo also did not view deindividuation exclusively as a group phenomenon, and applied the concept to suicide, murder, and interpersonal hostility.

===Convergence theory===
Convergence theory holds that crowd behavior is not a product of the crowd, but rather the crowd is a product of the coming together of like-minded individuals. Floyd Allport argued that &quot;An individual in a crowd behaves just as he would behave alone, only more so.&quot; Convergence theory holds that crowds form from people of similar dispositions, whose actions are then reinforced and intensified by the crowd.

Convergence theory claims that crowd behavior is not irrational; rather, people in crowds express existing beliefs and values so that the mob reaction is the rational product of widespread popular feeling. However, this theory is questioned by certain research which found that people involved in the 1970s riots were less likely than nonparticipant peers to have previous convictions.

Critics of this theory report that it still excludes the social determination of self and action, in that it argues that all actions of the crowd are born from the individuals&#x27; intents.

===Emergent norm theory===
Ralph H. Turner and Lewis Killian put forth the idea that norms emerge from within the crowd. Emergent norm theory states that crowds have little unity at their outset, but during a period of milling about, key members suggest appropriate actions, and following members fall in line, forming the basis for the crowd&#x27;s norms.

Key members are identified through distinctive personalities or behaviors. These garner attention, and the lack of negative response elicited from the crowd as a whole stands as tacit agreement to their legitimacy. The followers form the majority of the mob, as people tend to be creatures of conformity who are heavily influenced by the opinions of others. This has been shown in the conformity studies conducted by Sherif and Asch. Crowd members are further convinced by the universality phenomenon, described by Allport as the persuasive tendency of the idea that if everyone in the mob is acting in such-and-such a way, then it cannot be wrong.

Emergent norm theory allows for both positive and negative mob types, as the distinctive characteristics and behaviors of key figures can be positive or negative in nature. An antisocial leader can incite violent action, but an influential voice of non-violence in a crowd can lead to a mass sit-in. When a crowd described as above targets an individual, anti-social behaviors may emerge within its members.

A major criticism of this theory is that the formation and following of new norms indicates a level of self-awareness that is often missing in the individuals in crowds (as evidenced by the study of deindividuation). Another criticism is that the idea of emergent norms fails to take into account the presence of existent sociocultural norms. Additionally, the theory fails to explain why certain suggestions or individuals rise to normative status while others do not.

=== Social identity theory ===
The social identity theory posits that the self is a complex system made up primarily of the concept of membership or non-membership in various social groups. These groups have various moral and behavioral values and norms, and the individual&#x27;s actions depend on which group membership (or non-membership) is most personally salient at the time of action.

This influence is evidenced by findings that when the stated purpose and values of a group changes, the values and motives of its members also change.

Crowds are an amalgam of individuals, all of whom belong to various overlapping groups. However, if the crowd is primarily related to some identifiable group (such as Christians or Hindus or Muslims or civil-rights activists), then the values of that group will dictate the crowd&#x27;s action.

In crowds which are more ambiguous, individuals will assume a new social identity as a member of the crowd. This group membership is made more salient by confrontation with other groups – a relatively common occurrence for crowds.

The group identity serves to create a set of standards for behavior; for certain groups violence is legitimate, for others it is unacceptable. This standard is formed from stated values, but also from the actions of others in the crowd, and sometimes from a few in leadership-type positions.

A concern with this theory is that while it explains how crowds reflect social ideas and prevailing attitudes, it does not explain the mechanisms by which crowds enact to drive social change.

<doc id="157901" wikidata="Q380640" url="?curid=157901" title="Gratuity">
<text>A gratuity (often called a tip) is a sum of money customarily given by a customer to certain service sector workers such as hospitality for the service they have performed, in addition to the basic price of the service.

Tips and their amount are a matter of social custom and etiquette, and the custom varies between countries and between settings. In some countries, it is customary to tip servers in bars and restaurants, taxi drivers, tattoo artists, hair stylists and so on. However, in some places tipping is not expected and may be discouraged or considered insulting. The customary amount of a tip can be a specific range or a certain percentage of the bill based on the perceived quality of the service given.

It is illegal to offer tips to some groups of workers, such as U.S. government workers and more widely police officers, as the tips may be regarded as bribery. A fixed percentage service charge is sometimes added to bills in restaurants and similar establishments. Tipping may not be expected when a fee is explicitly charged for the service.

Giving a tip is typically irreversible, differentiating it from the reward mechanism of a placed order, which can be refunded. From a theoretical economic point of view, gratuities may solve the principal–agent problem (the situation in which an agent, such as a server, is working for a principal, such as a restaurant owner or manager) and many managers believe that tips provide incentive for greater worker effort. However, studies of the practice in America suggest that tipping is often discriminatory or arbitrary: workers receive different levels of gratuity based on factors such as age, sex, race, hair color and even breast size, and the size of the gratuity is found to be only tenuously related to the quality of service.

==Etymology and history==
According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the word &quot;tip&quot; originated as a slang term and its etymology is unclear. According to the &quot;Online Etymology Dictionary&quot;, the meaning &quot;give a small present of money&quot; began around 1600, and the meaning &quot;give a gratuity to&quot; is first attested in 1706. The noun in this sense is from 1755. The term in the sense of &quot;to give a gratuity&quot; first appeared in the 18th century. It derived from an earlier sense of &quot;tip&quot;, meaning &quot;to give; to hand, pass&quot;, which originated in the thieves&#x27; cant in the 17th century. This sense may have derived from the 16th-century &quot;tip&quot; meaning &quot;to strike or hit smartly but lightly&quot; (which may have derived from the Low German &quot;tippen&quot;, &quot;to tap&quot;), but this derivation is &quot;very uncertain&quot;. The word &quot;tip&quot; was first used as a verb in 1707 in George Farquhar&#x27;s play &quot;The Beaux&#x27; Stratagem&quot;. Farquhar used the term after it had been &quot;used in criminal circles as a word meant to imply the unnecessary and gratuitous gifting of something somewhat taboo, like a joke, or a sure bet, or illicit money exchanges.&quot;

The etymology for the synonym for tipping, &quot;gratuity&quot;, dates back either to the 1520s, from &quot;graciousness&quot;, from the French &quot;gratuité&quot; (14th century) or directly from Medieval Latin &quot;gratuitas&quot;, &quot;free gift&quot;, probably from earlier Latin &quot;gratuitus&quot;, &quot;free, freely given&quot;. The meaning &quot;money given for favor or services&quot; is first attested in the 1530s. In some languages, the term translates to &quot;drink money&quot; or similar: for example &quot;pourboire&quot; in French, &quot;Trinkgeld&quot; in German, &quot;drikkepenge&quot; in Danish, &quot;drinksilver&quot; in Middle Scots, and &quot;napiwek&quot; in Polish. This comes from a custom of inviting a servant to drink a glass in honour of the guest, and paying for it, in order for the guests to show generosity among each other. The term &quot;bibalia&quot; in Latin was recorded in 1372.

The practice of tipping began in Tudor England. In medieval times, tipping was a master-serf custom wherein a servant would receive extra money for having performed superbly well. By the 17th century, it was expected that overnight guests to private homes would provide sums of money, known as vails, to the host&#x27;s servants. Soon afterwards, customers began tipping in London coffeehouses and other commercial establishments&quot;.

The practice was imported from Europe to America in the 1850s and 1860s by Americans who wanted to seem aristocratic. However, until the early 20th century, Americans viewed tipping as inconsistent with the values of an egalitarian, democratic society, as the origins of tipping were premised upon noblesse oblige, which promoted tipping as a means to establish social status to inferiors. Six American states passed laws that made tipping illegal. Enforcement of anti-tipping laws was problematic. The earliest of these laws was passed in 1909 (Washington), and the last of these laws was repealed in 1926 (Mississippi). Some have argued that &quot;The original workers that were not paid anything by their employers were newly freed slaves&quot; and that &quot;This whole concept of not paying them anything and letting them live on tips carried over from slavery.&quot; The anti-tipping movement spread to Europe with the support of the labour movement, which led to the eventual abolition of customary tipping in most European countries.

Also, proprietors regarded tips as equivalent to bribing an employee to do something that was otherwise forbidden, such as tipping a waiter to get an extra large portion of food. However, the introduction of Prohibition in the US in 1919 had an enormous impact on hotels and restaurants, who lost the revenue of selling alcoholic beverages. The resulting financial pressure caused proprietors to welcome tips, as a way of supplementing employee wages. Contrary to popular belief, tipping did not arise because of servers&#x27; low wages, because the occupation of waiter (server) was fairly well paid in the era when tipping became institutionalized.

==Reasons for tipping==
Tipping researcher Michael Lynn identifies five motivations for tipping:
* Showing off
* To supplement the server&#x27;s income and make them happy
* For improved future service
* To avoid disapproval from the server
* A sense of duty

A 2009 academic paper by Steven Holland calls tipping &quot;an effective mechanism for risk sharing and welfare improvement&quot; which reduces the risk faced by a service customer, because the customer can decide whether or not to tip. Tipping is sometimes given as an example of the principal–agent problem in economics. One example is a restaurant owner who engages servers to act as agents on his behalf. In some cases, &quot;[c]ompensation agreements [can] increase worker effort [...] if compensation is [...] tied to the firm&#x27;s success&quot; and one example of such a compensation agreement is waiters and waitresses who are paid tips. Studies show however that, in the real world, the size of the tip is only weakly correlated with the quality of the service and other effects dominate.

==Tronc==
A tronc is an arrangement for the pooling and distribution to employees of tips, gratuities and/or service charges in the hotel and catering trade. The person who distributes monies from the tronc is known as the troncmaster. Where a tronc exists in the UK, responsibility for deducting pay-as-you-earn taxes from the distribution may lie with the troncmaster rather than the employer. The word &quot;tronc&quot; has its origins in the French for collecting box. In June 2008, the Employment Appeals Tribunal ruled in a UK test case (Revenue and Customs Commissioners v Annabel’s (Berkeley Square) Ltd) that income from a tronc cannot be counted when assessing whether a wage or salary meets the national minimum wage.

==Mandatory tipping==
Tipping may not be expected when a fee is explicitly charged for the service. A service charge is sometimes added to bills in restaurants and similar establishments. Attempts to hide service charge by obscuring the line on the receipt have been reported. A service charge, or fee assessed, is determined by and paid directly to the company. The charges may be for services rendered, administrative fees, or processing cost.

In the United States, criminal charges were dropped in two separate cases over non-payment of mandatory gratuities. Courts ruled that automatic does not mean mandatory. Some cruise lines charge their patrons US$10 per day in mandatory tipping; this does not include extra gratuities for alcoholic beverages.

==By region==
===Africa===
====Nigeria====
In Nigeria, tipping is common at upscale hotels and restaurants but a service charge is usually included in the bill, though the employees rarely get this as part of their wages.

====Madagascar====
In Madagascar, tipping is not expected.

====Morocco====

In Morocco, tipping is not mandatory, but rounding up the bill and leaving tips at restaurants and cafés, or to the service providers is a standard practice and appreciated.

===Asia===

==== Azerbaijan ====
Tipping in Azerbaijan is mostly observed in services such as taxi as well as restaurants. Total size of the tip is also based on the overall cost of the said service. Restaurants often do not charge tipping in the receipt, however, it is still considered a necessity by many to tip the waiter for their work. Additionally, gratuity is widely acceptable in parking. Unlike valet parking, tip is usually customary when a person helps you park, or guides you to a suitable parking space.

====China====
In China, traditionally there is no tipping. However, hotels that routinely serve foreign tourists allow tipping, as do tour guides and associated drivers.

In cities bordering Hong Kong like Shenzhen, some restaurants and hotels also started to charge gratuity since the 1980s.

==== Hong Kong ====
In Hong Kong, tipping is not typically expected at hotels or restaurant establishments, where a &quot;service charge&quot; of 10% is added to a bill instead of expecting a gratuity. Taxi drivers in Hong Kong may also charge the difference between a fare and a round sum as a &quot;courtesy fee&quot; to avoid making change for larger bills.

====Japan====

As a service charge is typically included as part of bills at hotels and restaurants, tipping is generally not practiced in Japan. In addition, Japan has a set of traditions and customs regarding giving money as a gift, so tipping may cause confusion or be considered rude if the money is given without being placed in a special gift envelope first. Like many other countries in East Asia, Japanese people see tipping as insulting. The Tip Project, a plan to normalise tipping in Japan in 2021, was met with severe backlash from locals who deemed the practice &quot;un-Japanese&quot;, and the project was abandoned in early 2023.

====India====
In India, tipping is not normal in hotels and restaurants, but may be appreciated. Tips can be rounding off the bill or 5%-10% of the bill. However, it is gaining popularity and the food delivery apps often nudge the customers to tip the delivery partners.

====Iran====
Tipping is not expected for occupations mostly.

====Malaysia====
In Malaysia, tipping is not the norm and is not expected for any service. Instead restaurants can add a service charge of 10% to the bill. In Malaysia the people are familiar with tipping, so if a person does leave a tip then it is accepted and appreciated. Tips, when given, usually take the form of rounding up the bill.

====Pakistan====

Tipping is not an obligation, and it is not considered rude not to tip, though workers will be pleased if tipped. Normally in low to medium-end restaurants, the bill is rounded up to the nearest Rs.100 or 1000 and the change is given as tip either directly to the waiter or left on the table.

In more formal settings, hotels and restaurants add a 10% service charge to the bill, which is paid along with the bill itself.

====Philippines====

Tipping is not customary in most areas and is not generally expected.

In upscale restaurants, if a service charge is added, tipping is not needed nor expected. Among smaller side street restaurants, service charge is usually not included and tip amount may vary from loose changes to not at all (most do not give tips). The customer in this case can give any amount he/she wishes.

Fastfood areas (McDonald&#x27;s, Jollibee, Popeyes, etc.) are not tipping locations and staffs are reluctant to accept money.

Hotels bellboys are generally provided tips but amount is not fixed and may depend on the customer. Taxis are not provided tips but customer may pay extra to avoid loose change (usual range of 10 to 30 pesos). App based vehicles (Grab etc.) are usually paid tips via app and therefore under the discretion of the customer.

There are establishments that strictly implement a &quot;No tipping policy&quot;.

There are establishments that can accept tips but must be placed in designated tipping containers.

====South Korea====
Tipping is not customary in Korean culture, and tipping is not expected in the general service industry. Some people even regard tipping as an inappropriate behaviour. High-end hotels and restaurants often include a service charge of between 10% and 15%, but it is always included in the bill and customers are not expected to leave an additional gratuity for servers.

====Singapore====
In Singapore, bars and restaurants typically add a 10% service charge, which is subject to the 9% Goods &amp; Services Tax. Excess tipping is not practiced and is rarely expected in most instances. Tips may be regarded as an insult or mistaken for illegal bribery. Taxi drivers given a tip will mistake it for overpayment, and return the exact change.

====Taiwan====
In Taiwan, tipping is not customary, but all mid and high end restaurants include a mandatory &quot;10% service charge&quot;, which is not given to the service staff, but rather considered by Taiwanese law as general revenue, as reported by the &quot;Taipei Times&quot; in &quot;False Gratuity&quot; on July 9, 2013.

====Nepal====

In Nepal, tipping is not compulsory, but is commonly practiced in the country&#x27;s tourist sector, particularly among tour groups and in hotels.

===Europe===

====Albania====

Tipping (&quot;bakshish&quot;) in Albania is very much expected almost everywhere. In recent times it has become more common, as many foreigners and Albanians living abroad visit Albania. Leaving a tip of around 10% of the bill is customary in restaurants; even porters, guides and chauffeurs expect tips. Duty-free alcohol is often used as a type of tip for porters, bellhops and the like, though some people (such as Muslims) can find it offensive.

====Austria====
Tipping is not required but often expected, particularly in restaurants where roughly 5% to 10% is common. This depends on the service one received and the restaurant level (low, medium, high prices). In standard restaurants it is OK to round up to the next euro. Another common setting where tipping is customary is taxis, where bills may be rounded up to the next euro.

====Croatia====
Even though most people in the service industry are paid a living wage, tips (in Croatian: &quot;napojnica&quot;, &quot;manča&quot;) are quite common. 10% (or more, depending on the service) is expected in restaurants. Absence of a tip is generally interpreted as dissatisfaction with the food and/or service. In clubs and café bars, it is common to round up the bill (e.g. to 10 kn if the bill is more than 5 kn, or 100 kn if the bill is 88 kn). Tips are always expected in cash, even when the bill is paid by credit card. If a customer leaves a tip with a credit card, the employee does not receive any of it. It is not common to tip hairdressers, but the rounding-up method is common for taxi drivers.

==== Czech Republic ====
Tipping (&quot;spropitné&quot;, informally &quot;dýško&quot; or &quot;tuzér&quot;) in the Czech Republic, like in Germany and Austria, is optional but polite and very welcome, especially in restaurants, and less often in taxis, hairdressers and similar services. The usual practice is for the customer to round the price to the nearest higher &quot;nice number&quot; so as not to have to handle small coins, and to tell the waiter what amount to round the price to. The resulting tip tends to be around 10%, but this is not a hard and fast rule. So, for example, if the waiter says the price is 279 CZK, the customer pays with a 500 CZK note and says: &quot;Three hundred crowns.&quot; This means that the waiter should return only 200 CZK and keep 21 CZK as a tip. When paying by card, the tip can either be added to the payment or given separately in cash. If the waiter does not have to return anything after rounding up (e.g. if the price is 174 CZK and the customer pays with a 200 CZK note), it is customary to say &quot;To je v pořádku&quot; (&quot;Keep the change&quot;, literally &quot;That&#x27;s alright&quot;). A tip of more than 10-15% is more likely to be given in recognition of outstanding service. On the other hand, especially in the case of dissatisfaction with the service, it is perfectly acceptable not to tip at all. It is not customary to leave a tip on the table. According to Czech law, service charge must always be included in the listed price (but tips do not appear in the bill). Some Prague restaurants have been reported to display &quot;Service is not included&quot; signs to persuade foreign tourists to pay more, mimicking the practice in the United States. However, this is a scam.

====Denmark====
Tips (&quot;drikkepenge&quot;, lit. &quot;drinking money&quot;) are not required in Denmark since service charges must always be included in the bill by law. Tipping for outstanding service is a matter of choice, but is not expected.

====Estonia====
In Estonia, tipping (&quot;jootraha, lit. &quot;drinking money&quot;&quot;) is not required and never expected.

====Finland====
In Finland, tipping is never expected. Rounding the bill in restaurant, hairsalon or in taxi is not frowned upon. If service is great one can give a tip, usually around 10%.

====France====
Tips (&quot;pourboires&quot;, lit. &quot;for drinking&quot;) in France are neither required nor expected, and should only be offered after the customer received outstanding service. Waiters are paid a living wage and do not depend on tips, and cafés and restaurants are required by law to include a service charge (usually 15%) in the menu price; it is not usually set out separately on the bill. Tipping is better received in venues accustomed to tourists, but can be treated with disdain in smaller food establishments and those in more rural areas. Should one decide to tip after experiencing excellent service, it is customary to round up to the next Euro for small bills, and up to 5% for larger ones. Anything over 5% is considered very generous. For superior service in higher-end eating establishments, a more generous (10% or more) tip would not be out of place. Tips should always be offered in cash, as credit card terminals don&#x27;t include a tipping option. Attending a performance in a private theater may be the only case in France where a tip is expected (generally €1), even though it is illegal.

==== Germany ====

Tipping (&quot;Trinkgeld&quot;) is not seen as obligatory. In the case of waiting staff, and in the context of a debate about a minimum wage, some people disapprove of tipping and say that it should not substitute for employers paying a good basic wage. But most people in Germany consider tipping to be good manners as well as a way to express gratitude for good service.

It is illegal, and rare, to charge a service fee without the customer&#x27;s consent. However, a tip of about 5% to 10%, depending on the type of service, is customary. For example, Germans usually tip their waiters. As a rule of thumb, the more personal the service, the more common it is to tip. Payments by card may also include the tip, but the tip is usually paid in cash when the card is handed over.

At times, rather than tipping individually, a tipping box is set up. Rounding up the bill in Germany is commonplace, sometimes with the comment &quot;stimmt so&quot; (&quot;keep the change&quot;), rather than asking for all the change and leaving the tip afterwards. Or the customer says how much he will pay in total, including the tip: thus if the basic price is €10.50, the customer might, rather generously but not unusually, say &quot;zwölf&quot; (&quot;twelve&quot;), pay with a €20 note and get €8 in change. When paying a small amount, it is common to round up to the nearest euro (e.g. €1.80 to €2.00).

Sometimes a sign reading &quot;Aufrunden bitte&quot; (&quot;round up please&quot;) is found in places where tipping is not common (like supermarkets, or clothing retailers). This requests that the bill be rounded up to the nearest €0.10. This is not to tip the staff, but a charity donation (fighting child poverty), and completely voluntary.

In Germany, tips are considered as income, but they are tax free according to § 3 Nr. 51 of the German Income Tax Law.

====Hungary====
The Hungarian word for tip is (literally &quot;intended for wine&quot;, a loose calque from ) or colloquially (from &quot;bakhshesh&quot;), often written in English as backsheesh. Tipping is widespread in Hungary; the degree of expectation and the expected amount varies with price, type and quality of service, and also influenced by the satisfaction of the customer. As in Germany, rounding up the price to provide a tip is commonplace. The typical value of a tip is 10 percent in Hungary.

Depending on the situation, tipping might be unusual, optional or expected. Almost all bills include a service charge; similarly, some employers calculate wages on the basis that the employee would also receive tips, while others prohibit accepting them. In some cases a tip is only given if the customer is satisfied; in others it is customary to give a certain percentage regardless of the quality of the service; and there are situations when it is hard to tell the difference from a bribe. Widespread tipping based on loosely defined customs and an almost imperceptible transition into bribery is considered a main factor contributing to corruption. A particular example of a gratuity is (&quot;gratitude money&quot;) or , which is the very much expected – almost obligatory even though illegal – tipping of state-employed physicians. (Hungary&#x27;s healthcare system is almost completely state-run and there is an obligatory social insurance system).

====Iceland====
In Iceland, tipping (&quot;&quot;, lit. &quot;serving money&quot;) is not customary and never expected. Foreign tourists sometimes still tip without thinking because that is the custom in their home country. Tourist guides in Iceland also sometimes encourage their guests to tip them, but there is no requirement to do so.

====Ireland====
It is uncommon for Irish people to tip cleaning staff at hotel. Tips are sometimes given to reward high quality service or as a kind gesture, particularly during the Christmas holiday season. Tipping is most often done by leaving small change (5–10%) at the table or rounding up the bill, or for a taxi driver.

However, some people may choose to tip in restaurants and for food deliveries. Hairdressers are expected to be tipped for a good job, usually 5–20 euro.

Tips and service charges, whether mandatory or not, collected electronically such as by credit card payment must be distributed in full to staff. Tips distributed this way are to be treated as pay and tax deducted in the usual way, while cash tips must be declared by staff via a tax return.

====Italy====
Tips (&quot;la mancia&quot;) are not customary in Italy, and are given only for a special service or as thanks for high quality service, but they are very uncommon. Almost all restaurants (with the notable exception of those in Rome) have a service charge (called &quot;coperto&quot; and/or &quot;servizio&quot;). As restaurants are required to inform customers of any fees they charge, they usually list the &quot;coperto&quot;/&quot;servizio&quot; on the menu.

====Lithuania====
Tipping is commonly not expected, but is practiced to reward high quality service or as a kind gesture. Tipping is most common at restaurants, bars and walking tours.

====Netherlands====
Tipping (&quot;fooi&quot;) in the Netherlands is not obligatory by law as all the service costs are included in the listed price for the products and the income of the staff is not depending on the provided (amount or quality of) service. However everybody is free to donate. It is illegal to charge (an extra) service fee without the customer&#x27;s consent.

====Norway====
It is uncommon for Norwegians to tip taxi drivers or cleaning staff at hotels. In restaurants and bars it is more common, but not expected. Tips are often given to reward high quality service or as a kind gesture. Tipping is most often done by leaving small change (5–15%) at the table or rounding up the bill.

&quot;Oslo Servitørforbund&quot; and &quot;Hotell- og Restaurantarbeiderforbundet&quot; (The Labor Union for Hotel and Restaurant Employees) has said many times that they discourage tipping, except for extraordinary service, because it makes salaries decrease over time, makes it harder to negotiate salaries and does not count towards pensions, unemployment insurance, loans and other benefits.

====Romania====
The amount of the tip (&quot;bacșiș&quot;) and method of calculating it will vary with the venue and can vary from 1–5 RON to 10% of the bill. According to the recent regulation (implemented in January 2023), the tips must appear on bills and are taxed (10%). If paying by card, the tip is usually left in cash alongside the bill. While tipping is not the norm, servers, taxi drivers, hairdressers, hotel maids, parking valets, tour guides, spa therapists et al. are used to receiving tips regularly, and are likely to consider it an expression of appreciation for the quality of the service (or lack of it). If offering a tip, 5–10% of the bill is customary, or small amounts of 5, 10 or 20 RON for services which are not directly billed. For other types of services it depends on circumstances; it will not usually be refused, but will be considered a sign of appreciation. For instance, counter clerks in drugstores or supermarkets are not tipped, but their counterparts in clothing stores can be.

Tipping can be used proactively to obtain favors, such as reservations or better seats. However, care should be taken for it not to be seen as a bribe, depending on circumstances. While tipping is overlooked in Romania, bribery is a larger issue which may have legal consequences. There is an ongoing aversion about both giving and receiving tips in coins, due to the low value of the denominations. It is best to stick to paper money. Offering coins can be considered a rude gesture and may prompt sarcastic or even angry remarks.

On the other hand, the coin handling aversion has resulted in the widespread practice of rounding payments. This is not technically a tip, and as such is not aimed primarily at the individual at the counter, but rather at the business. Nevertheless, if done with a smile it can be seen as a form of appreciation from the customer towards the clerk. Etiquette demands that one of the parties offers the change, but the other can choose to tell them to keep all or part of it. Small businesses may sometimes force the issue by just claiming they are out of change, or offering small value products instead, such as sticks of gum; this is considered rude and it is up to the customer to accept or call them out for it. The reverse can also happen, where the clerk does not have small change to make for the customer&#x27;s paper money, but chooses to return a smaller paper denomination and round down in favor of the customer, in exchange for getting them through faster. The latter usually happens only in the larger store chains.

====Russia====
In Russian language, a gratuity is called &quot;chayeviye&quot; (чаевые), which literally means &quot;for the tea&quot;. Tipping small amounts of money in Russia for people such as waiters, cab drivers and hotel bellboys was quite common before the Communist Revolution of 1917. During the Soviet era, and especially with the Stalinist reforms of the 1930s, tipping was discouraged and was considered an offensive capitalist tradition aimed at belittling and lowering the status of the working class. So from then until the early 1990s tipping was seen as rude and offensive. With the fall of the Soviet Union and the dismantling of the Iron Curtain in 1991, and the subsequent influx of foreign tourists and businessmen into the country, tipping started a slow but steady comeback. Since the early 2000s tipping has become somewhat of a norm again. However, still a lot of confusion persists around tipping: Russians do not have a widespread consensus on how much to tip, for what services, where and how. In larger urban areas, like Moscow and St Petersburg, tips of 10% are expected in high-end restaurants, coffee shops, bars and hotels, and are normally left in cash on the table, after the bill is paid by credit card; or as part of cash payment if a credit card is not used. Tipping at a buffet or any other budget restaurant, where there are no servers to take one&#x27;s order at the table (called &quot;stolovaya&quot;) is not expected and not appropriate. Fast food chains, such as Vkusno &amp; Tochka, Chaynaya Lozhka, Teremok and so on, do not allow tipping either. Tipping bartenders in a pub is not common, but it is expected in an up-market bar. Metered taxi drivers also count on a tip of 5–10%, but non-metered drivers who pre-negotiate the fare do not expect one. It should also be noted that the older Russians, who grew up and lived most of their lives during the Soviet era, still consider tipping an offensive practice and detest it. In smaller rural towns, tipping is rarely expected and may even cause confusion.

====Slovenia====
Tipping is common in Slovenia, but most locals do not tip other than to round up to the nearest euro. Absence of a tip is generally interpreted as dissatisfaction with the food and/or service. Since about 2007, areas visited by many tourists have begun to accept tips of around 10–20%.

====Spain====
Tipping (&quot;propina&quot;) is not generally considered mandatory in Spain, and depends on the quality of the service received. In restaurants the amount of the tip, if any, depends mainly on the kind of locale: higher percentages are expected in upscale restaurants. In bars and small restaurants, Spaniards sometimes leave as a tip the small change left on their plate after paying a bill. Outside the restaurant business, some service providers, such as taxi drivers, hairdressers and hotel personnel, may expect a tip in an upscale setting. In 2007 the Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, blamed excessive tipping for the increase in the inflation rate.

====Sweden====
Tipping (&quot;dricks&quot;) is commonly not expected, but is practiced to reward high quality service or as a kind gesture. Tipping is most often done by leaving small change on the table or rounding up the bill. This is mostly done at restaurants (less often if payment is made at the desk) and in taxis (some taxis are very expensive as there is no fixed tariff, so they might not be tipped). Less often hairdressers are tipped. Tips are taxed in Sweden, but cash tips are not often declared to the tax authority. Cards are heavily used in Sweden as of the 2010s, and tips paid by cards in restaurants are regularly checked by the tax 
authority. Amounts given have increased after 2020 because card terminals has started to offer the choice of giving none, 10 or 20% as tips.

====Turkey====
In Turkey, tipping, or &quot;bahşiş&quot; (lit. gift, from the Persian word بخشش, often rendered in English as &quot;baksheesh&quot;) is usually optional and not customary in many places. Though not necessary, a tip of 5–10% is appreciated in restaurants, and is usually paid by &quot;leaving the change&quot;. Cab drivers usually do not expect to be tipped, though passengers may round up the fare. A tip of small change may be given to a hotel porter. However, many customers started to tip generously ever since the pandemic in order to help, especially local, establishments.

====United Kingdom====

Tipping is not expected in Britain the way it is in some other countries; however, for the majority of people tipping in some circumstances is customary as a sign of appreciation. As all staff in the UK must be paid at least the National Minimum Wage, companies that accept tips are not allowed to use tips as a means to reduce wages below the minimum wage. The minimum wage varies by age: as of 2024, it is £11.44 for those aged 21 and over, £8.60 for those aged 18 to 20 and £6.40 for those under 18.

Employers are also banned from topping up wages with tips from customers. However rounding up a bill is acceptable (but not required) at restaurants with table service, and also for barbers, hairdressers and taxi drivers.

Sometimes, more often in London than in other areas, or at expensive restaurants, a service charge may be included in the bill, or added separately. 12.5% is reported as a common amount. Since it is a legal requirement to include all taxes and other obligatory charges in the prices displayed, a service charge is compulsory only if it is displayed, or the trader makes it clear verbally, before the meal. Even so, if the level of service is unacceptable, and in particular it falls short of the requirements of the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982, the customer can refuse to pay some or all of a service charge.

===North America and the Caribbean===

====Canada====

Tipping is practiced in Canada in a similar, but often less vigorous manner than the United States. Though a 15% gratuity is fairly common when food is served, tipping is not otherwise as widespread as in American culture. This has led to concerns in American border cities, where businesses relying on Canadian tourists often suffer.

In Canadian provinces other than Quebec, a deeply entrenched practice is &quot;tipping out&quot;, in which servers&#x27; tips are shared with kitchen staff, a practice that would be illegal in the United States. Another custom in some restaurants is &quot;house tipping&quot;, in which the manager or owner takes a share of the tips, a practice that is permitted in some provinces and forbidden in others.

Canadian Federal tax law considers tips as income. Workers who receive tips are legally required to report the income to the Canada Revenue Agency and pay income tax on it. In July 2012, &quot;The Toronto Star&quot; reported that CRA is concerned with tax evasion. An auditing of 145 servers in four restaurants by CRA mentioned in the report uncovered that among 145 staff audited, C$1.7 million was unreported. In 2005, The CRA was quoted that it will closely check the tax returns of individuals who would reasonably be expected to be receiving tips to ensure that the tips are reported realistically.

====Caribbean====
Tipping in the Caribbean varies from island to island. In the Dominican Republic, restaurants add a 10% gratuity and it is customary to tip an extra 10%. In St. Barths, it is expected that a tip be 10% to 15% if gratuity is not already included.

====Mexico====
Workers in small, economy restaurants usually do not expect a tip. However, tipping in Mexico is common in larger, medium and higher end restaurants. It is customary in these establishments to tip not less than 10% but not more than 15% of the bill as a voluntary offering for good service based on the total bill before value added tax, &quot;IVA&quot; in English, VAT. Value added tax is already included in menu or other service industry pricing since Mexican Consumer Law requires the exhibition of final costs for the customer. Thus, the standard tip in Mexico is 11.5% of the pre-tax bill which equates to 10% after tax in most of the Mexican territory, except in special lower tax stimulus economic zones.

Tips to taxi drivers are unusual in Mexico, but drivers used to ask for them from tourists, knowing that is common in other countries. Locally, taxi drivers are only tipped when they offer an extra service, like helping with the luggage or similar help.

A gratuity may be added to the bill without the customer&#x27;s consent, contrary to the law, either explicitly printed on the bill, or by more surreptitious means alleging local custom, in some restaurants, bars, and night clubs. However, in 2012, officials began a campaign to eradicate this increasingly rampant and abusive practice not only due to it violating Mexican consumer law, but also because frequently it was retained by owners or management.

If a service charge for tip (&quot;propina&quot; or &quot;restaurant service charge&quot;) is added, it is a violation of Article 10 of the Mexican Federal Law of the Consumer and Mexican authorities recommend patrons require management to refund or deduct this from their bill. Additionally, in this 2012 Federal initiative to eliminate the illegal add-ons, the government clarified that contrary even to the belief of many Mexicans, that the Mexican legal definition of tips (&quot;propinas&quot;) require it be discretionary to pay so that an unsatisfied client is under no obligation to pay anything to insure the legal definition of a tip is consistent with the traditional, cultural definition, and going as far to encourage all victims subject to the increasing illicit practice report the establishments to the PROFECO, the Office of the Federal Prosecutor for the Consumer, for prosecution.

====United States====

Tipping is a practiced social custom in the United States. Tipping by definition is voluntary – at the discretion of the customer. In restaurants offering traditional table service, a gratuity of 15–20% of the amount of a customer’s check (before tax) is customary when good to excellent service is provided. In buffet-style restaurants where the server brings only beverages, 10–15% is customary. Higher tips may be given for excellent service, and lower tips for mediocre or &quot;subpar&quot; service. In the case of bad or rude service no tip may be given, and the restaurant manager may be notified of the issue at hand. Tips are also generally given for services provided at golf courses, casinos, hotels, spas, salons, and for concierge services, food delivery, and taxis. This etiquette applies to service at weddings where the host should provide appropriate tips to workers at the end of an event; the amount may be negotiated in the contract.

The Fair Labor Standards Act defines tippable employees as individuals who customarily and regularly receive tips of $30 or more per month. Federal law permits employers to include tips towards satisfying the difference between employees&#x27; hourly wage and minimum wage. Federal minimum wage for tipped employees in the United States is $2.13 per hour, as long as the combination of tips and $2.13 hourly wage exceed the standard minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, although some states and territories provide more generous provisions for tipped employees. For example, laws in Alaska, California, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, and Guam specify that employees must be paid the full minimum wage of that state/territory (which is equal or higher than the federal minimum wage in these instances) without regard to tips.

However, a report in 2012 from the Department of Labor&#x27;s and Wage and Hours Division (WHD) uncovered that 84% of the 9,000 restaurants they investigated disobeyed the subminimum wage system. In the end the WHD found &quot;1,170 tip credit infractions that resulted in nearly $5.5 million in back wages.&quot;

Before 2018, a tip pool could not be allocated to employers, or to employees who do not customarily and regularly receive tips. These non-eligible employees included dishwashers, cooks, chefs, and janitors. In March 2018 an amendment was added to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) that allowed restaurants in a majority of states to split the split tips between front and back of house workers. Before this legislation passed there was concern of income inequality and the ability to pay rents between front and back of house workers. Over the span of 30 years since 1985 back of house workers in New York City restaurants had a compensation increase of about 25%. Meanwhile, their front of house counterpoints saw an increase of 300% in compensation. In 2015 the average wage of cooking staff in New York was $10–12, many of whom dealt with high monthly rent payments and also debt from culinary school. As seemingly low skilled front of house workers were making more money than the skilled back of house chefs, many cooks decided to switch over into serving instead.

There is only limited information available on levels of tipping. A study at Iowa State University provided data for a suburban restaurant surveyed in the early 1990s. The mean tip was $3.00 on a mean bill of $19.78. As such, the mean tip rate was 16.1%, and the median tip rate was about 15%. In a 2003 research study at Brigham Young University, the sample restaurants had an average tip percentage ranging from 13.57 to 14.69% between 1999 and 2002. A 2001 study done at Cornell University exploring the relationship between tip amount and quality of service has shown that quality of service is only weakly related to the amount the server is tipped by the guest. This study suggests that servers who provide amazing service are tipped marginally better, or not better at all, than servers who provide standard service.

Beginning in late 2022, concurrent with a global inflation surge, Americans have started to more openly debate the nature of tipping. This is in part because many fast service restaurants have started adding a &quot;tip screen&quot; to the credit card process, asking a customer to tip before any service is actually provided or where the service provided is the minimum required to provide the goods purchased with no other interaction or service. The phenomenon, known as tipflation, has caused for lower and lower gratuities being handed out at restaurants.

===== Service charges =====
Service charges are mandatory payments, typically added by caterers and banqueters. A service charge is not to be confused with a tip or gratuity which is optional and at the discretion of the customer. Restaurants commonly add it to checks for large parties. Some bars have decided to include service charge as well, for example in Manhattan, New York. Disclosure of service charge is required by law in some places, such as in State of Florida A standard predetermined percent, often ~18%, is sometimes labeled as a &quot;service charge&quot;.

=====Taxation=====

Tips are considered income. The entire tip amount is treated as earned wages with the exception of months in which tip income was under $20. Unlike wages where payroll tax (Social Security and Medicare tax) are split between employee and employer, the employee pays 100% of payroll tax on tip income and tips are excluded from worker&#x27;s compensation premiums in most states. This discourages no-tip policies because employers would pay 7.65% additional payroll taxes and up to 9% worker&#x27;s compensation premiums on higher wages in lieu of tips.

Research finds that consistent tax evasion by waitstaff due to fraudulent declaration is a concern in the US. According to the IRS, between 40% and 50% of tips to waiters are not reported for taxation. Employers are responsible for Federal Unemployment Insurance premiums on tips paid directly from customers to employees, and this encourages employers to collaborate in under reporting tips.

=====Employee taxation responsibilities=====
The IRS states that employees making income from tips have three main responsibilities.

# Keep a daily tip record.
# Report tips to the employer, unless less than $20.
# Report all tips on an individual income tax return.

Tips should be reported to employers by the 10th of the month after the tips were received unless the 10th ends up landing on a weekend day or a legal holiday. In that case the tips should be reported on the next available day that is not a weekend or a legal holiday. If the employee does not report the tips earned to their employer the employer will not be liable for the employer share of social security and Medicare taxes on the unreported tips. Employers will also not be liable for withholding and paying the employee&#x27;s share of social security and Medicare taxes.

=====Employer taxation responsibilities=====
Employers that hire employees that make tips for their income have 5 main responsibilities with the IRS.

# Retain employee tip reports.
# Withhold employee income taxes.
# Withhold employee share of social security and Medicare taxes.
# Report this information to the IRS.
# Pay the employer share of social security and Medicare taxes based on the reported tip income.
Employers should distinguish between service charges and tipped income and file and report the two separately. An employer operating a large food or beverage establishment will need to file a specific Form 8027 for each establishment they operate. A business that is recognized as a large food or beverage establishment must fall into all four categories shown below:

# The food or beverage operation must be based in one of the 50 states in the United States or the District of Columbia.
# Food and beverage is served for consumption on the premises. This does not include fast food operations.
# Customers tipping employees at the food or beverage operation must be a common practice.
# In the last year the operation employed over 10 employees on a typical business day regularly.

=====US federal employees=====
The US Government recognizes tips as allowable expenses for federal employee travel. However, US law prohibits federal employees from receiving tips under Standards of Ethical Conduct. Asking for, accepting or agreeing to take anything of value that influences the performance of an official act is not allowed. A 2011 rule issued by the US Department of Labor which prohibited employers from tip pooling employees who were paid at least the federal minimum wage and who don&#x27;t &quot;customarily and regularly&quot; receive tips was repealed in 2018. Instead, workers will have more rights to sue their employers for stolen tips, with assistance from the US Department of Labor.

=====Ride sharing=====
In the past ride sharing companies in the US were against the implementation of a tipping system. Uber wanted to prioritize quick transactions through their app and believed a tipping system would lead to an inconvenient experience for users. In 2017 Uber started its &quot;180 days of change&quot; to improve relations with its drivers. Part of the PR campaign included adding a tipping option to the app. The data shows that given the option to tip, close to 60% of Uber users never tip their drivers and only 1% will consistently tip their drivers. Only 16% of rides will result in the driver being tipped and the average tip amount in 2019 was $3.11.

===== Discrimination =====
A study from 2005 showed that average tips varied depending on the race of New Haven cab drivers. The average tip for white cab drivers was 20.3%, while black cab drivers received 12.6%, and cab drivers of other races received 12.4%. Both the study with cab drivers and another study about a southern restaurant showed that both white and black customers tipped black workers less on average than their white counterparts.

===South America===

====Bolivia====
Service charges are included with the bill. A tip of around 5% or so is sometimes given, and is considered polite.

====Brazil====
The term &quot;caixinha&quot; (literally &quot;little box&quot;) refers to a gratuity left at juice shops or similar establishments where full meals are not served. This gratuity is typically small and can be just the coins from the change, which are dropped into a decorated box beside the cashier. Additionally, tipping practices in Brazil vary across different service industries. While taxi drivers generally do not expect tips, delivery services may include a charge for convenience, leading to a decrease in tipping frequency. In other instances, tips ranging from 1 to 5 Brazilian reals, or more in luxury establishments, may be given to service providers such as parking attendants, luggage carriers, or gas station attendants who perform additional tasks beyond their primary duties.

====Paraguay====
Service charges are included with the bill and tipping is uncommon.

===Oceania===

====Australia====

Tipping is not expected or required in Australia. The minimum wage in Australia is reviewed yearly, and as of 2023 it was set at A$23.23 per hour (A$29.03 for casual employees) and this is fairly standard across all types of venues. Tipping at cafés and restaurants (especially for a large party), and tipping of taxi drivers and home food deliverers is again, not required or expected. However many people tend to round up the amount owed while indicating that they are happy to let the worker &quot;keep the change&quot;. Smaller cafes and similar places could have tip jars which people might put a bit of small change into but again, it certainly isn&#x27;t a requirement.

There is no tradition of tipping somebody who is just providing a service (e.g. a hotel porter). Casinos in Australia—and some other places—generally prohibit tipping of gaming staff, as it is considered bribery. For example, in the state of Tasmania, the Gaming Control Act 1993 states in section 56 (4): &quot;It is a condition of every special employee&#x27;s licence that the special employee must not solicit or accept any gratuity, consideration or other benefit from a patron in a gaming area&quot;. There is concern that tipping might become more common in Australia.

====New Zealand====
Tipping is not a traditional practice in New Zealand, though has become more common in recent years, especially in finer establishments. Tipping in New Zealand is likely the result of tourists visiting from tipping cultures (such as the United States) who may follow their own tipping customs. It is still extremely rare among locals, especially among the working and middle-class. The minimum wage in New Zealand is reviewed yearly, and as of April 2024 was set at NZ$23.15 per hour for employees 18 and over.

Where tipping does occur among New Zealanders it is usually to reward a level of service that is far in excess of the customer&#x27;s expectations, or as an unsolicited reward for a voluntary act of service. A number of websites published by the New Zealand government advise tourists that &quot;tipping in New Zealand is not obligatory – even in restaurants and bars. However, tipping for good service or kindness is at the discretion of the visitor&quot;. A Sunday Star-Times reader poll in 2011 indicated 90% of their readers did not want tipping for good service to become the norm in New Zealand.

==Criticisms==

===Inconsistency of percentage-based gratuities===

In countries where tipping is the norm, some employers pay workers with the expectation that their wages will be supplemented by tips. Some have criticized the inherent &quot;social awkwardness&quot; in transactions that involve tipping, the inconsistency of tipping for some services but not similar ones, and the irrationality of basing tips on price, rather than the amount and quality of service (a customer pays a larger tip to a server bringing a lobster rather than a hamburger, for example). Also in countries where tips are not paid by most but where many do, managers tell new waiters that the salary might not be so high but there will be tips, meaning that waiters get little reward for serving customers who do not pay a tip.

===Travellers following home rather than local customs===
Some nationalities, such as people from the United States, are used to paying tips, and often do so even when they visit countries where this is less of a norm. In contrast, tourists from such countries may neglect or even refuse to pay tips when they visit countries such as the US where tips are expected. This is particularly common in American cities along the Canadian border, and is seen as a problem by many in the hospitality sector.

===Discomfort===
Tipping might be discomforting to some people because it adds the necessity of figuring out the tip amount each time, which is made harder by the fact that the tip amount the service provider is hoping to receive, is in general unknown to the customer. As lack of, or too low, tip might offend the service provider this adds the discomfort of fear of creating an unpleasant social encounter to each service purchase transaction the customer suspects might involve the expectation of tipping.
Tipping might be discomforting also to some service providers as they might view it as derogating to their occupation, as &quot;a token of inferiority&quot;. William Scott in his &quot;The Itching Palm&quot; study wrote: &quot;The relation of a man giving a tip and a man accepting it is as undemocratic as the relation of master and slave. A citizen in a republic ought to stand shoulder to shoulder with every other citizen, with no thought of cringing, without an assumption of superiority or an acknowledgment of inferiority&quot;.

===Discrimination===
In the episode of the &quot;Freakonomics&quot; podcast Lynn found that &quot;attractive waitresses get better tips than less attractive waitresses. Men’s appearance, not so important&quot;. Lynn&#x27;s research also found that &quot;blondes get better tips than brunettes. Slender women get better tips than heavier women. Large breasted women get better tips than smaller breasted women. Surprisingly, at least in the studies I’ve done, women in their 30s get better tips than either younger or older women.” A woman server interviewed for the podcast episode stated: &quot;lost my job because my manager said that I didn’t fit the look of the company, or the restaurant. So I don’t know if it was because I’m a lot more curvier than the other girls or because my skin is darker. I don’t know&quot;.

Lynn states of tipping: &quot;It’s discriminatory. Yes, and the Supreme Court has ruled that even neutral business practices that are not intended to discriminate, if they have the effect of adversely impacting a protected class are illegal. And so it’s not inconceivable to me that there will be a class-action lawsuit on the part of ethnic minority waiters and waitresses claiming discrimination in terms of employment. And it’s conceivable that tipping might be declared illegal on that basis.”

<text>Robert Guiscard ( , ; – 17 July 1085), also referred to as Robert de Hauteville, was a Norman adventurer remembered for his conquest of southern Italy and Sicily in the 11th century.

Robert was born into the Hauteville family in Normandy, the sixth son of Tancred de Hauteville and his wife Fressenda. He inherited the County of Apulia and Calabria from his brother in 1057, and in 1059 he was made Duke of Apulia and Calabria and Lord of Sicily by Pope Nicholas II. He was also briefly Prince of Benevento (1078–1081), before returning the title to the papacy.

==Name==
Robert&#x27;s sobriquet, &quot;Guiscard&quot; (in contemporary Latin and Old French , closely related to the English archaism ) is often rendered as &quot;the Resourceful&quot;, &quot;the Cunning&quot;, &quot;the Wily&quot;, &quot;the Fox&quot;, or &quot;the Weasel&quot;. In Italian sources he is known as &quot;Roberto il Guiscardo&quot; or &quot;Roberto d&#x27;Altavilla&quot; (meaning Robert Guiscard and Robert de Hauteville), while medieval Arabic sources call him simply &quot;Abārt al-dūqa&quot; (Duke Robert).

==Historical background==
From 999 to 1042, different Normans began migrating to Italy, where they mainly worked as mercenaries, serving at various times the Byzantines and a number of Lombard nobles. The first of the independent Norman lords was Rainulf Drengot, who established himself in the fortress of Aversa, becoming Count of Aversa and Duke of Gaeta.

In 1038, William Iron Arm and Drogo, the eldest sons of Tancred of Hauteville (Seigneur of Hauteville-La-Guichard, a town in Cotentin, Normandy), and elder brothers of Robert Guiscard, arrived in Italy. The two joined a revolt against the Byzantine rule of Apulia, started by the Lombards. By 1040 the Byzantines had lost most of the province. In 1042 a group of Normans settled in Apulia and chose Melfi as their capital; in September of the same year they elected William Iron Arm as their count, who was succeeded in turn by his brothers Drogo, &quot;comes Normannorum totius Apuliæ e Calabriæ&quot; (&quot;the count of all Normans in Apulia and Calabria&quot;), and after him Humphrey, who arrived around 1044.

==Arrival in Italy==
Robert Guiscard was born around 1015, a son of Tancred of Hauteville and his second wife Fressenda, and the sixth of Tancred&#x27;s twelve sons. According to the Byzantine historian Anna Komnene, he left Normandy to follow his brothers&#x27; footsteps with only five mounted riders and thirty followers on foot. Upon arriving in southern Italy in 1047, he became the chief of a roving band of robbers. Anna Komnene gives us a physical description of Guiscard:
When Robert arrived in Apulia, lands were scarce, and thus he couldn&#x27;t expect any land grant from his brother Drogo, then count (especially since Drogo had already given Humphrey the county of Lavello). In 1048, Guiscard joined Pandulf IV of Capua in a war against Guaimar IV of Salerno. The next year, however, he left the war. Chronicler Amatus of Montecassino says this was due to Pandulf denying a previous promise that he had made to Robert, which included the gift of a castle and his daughter&#x27;s hand in marriage. Robert therefore returned to Drogo&#x27;s court, and he asked his brother to grant him a fief. Drogo, who had just finished a military campaign in Calabria, granted him command of the fortress of Scribla, but Guiscard, dissatisfied, transferred to the castle of San Marco Argentano. During his time in Calabria, Robert married Alberada of Buonalbergo, under the promise of her nephew Girard of Buonalbergo that he would join Robert with his 200 knights if the marriage took place.

As the Normans gained more and more power in southern Italy, the Lombards, of whom they had been allies for a long time, turned against him. Pope Leo IX formed an anti-Norman coalition in an effort to expel them from the peninsula, but in 1053 he was defeated in the Battle of Civitate by the Norman forces, led by Humphrey, now count. Robert fought personally in the battle, and according to William of Apulia he was dismounted from his horse on three occasions, but he remounted every time.

==Rule==
===Accession to the throne and treaty of Melfi===
 When Humphrey died in 1057, Guiscard succeeded him as Count of Apulia and Calabria, skipping over his elder half-brother Geoffrey in the line of succession. Soon after, probably in 1058, Guiscard&#x27;s marriage to Alberada was annulled due to consanguinity. It was the first time that a marriage was annulled for this cause. After that, Robert married Sikelgaita, sister of Gisulf II of Salerno, securing a new alliance between Lombards and Normans. In return for his sister&#x27;s hand in marriage, Gisulf demanded that Guiscard destroyed two castles which belonged to his brother William, because they stood on Gisulf&#x27;s territory.

The Papacy, in a conflict with the Holy Roman Emperor due to the Investiture Controversy, now opted to secure the Normans as allies. Therefore, in the Treaty of Melfi of 1059, Guiscard swore fealty to Pope Nicholas II. In return, Nicholas invested Guiscard of the titles of Duke of Apulia and Calabria and Lord of Sicily (&quot;by the Grace of God and St Peter duke of Apulia and Calabria and, if either aid me, future lord of Sicily&quot;), legitimizing his intervention against the Sicilian emirates, of Muslim faith.

===Campaigns in Calabria===
After the treaty of Melfi, Robert engaged in a large series of conquests in southern Italy, mainly in Calabria and Sicily, with the help of his younger brother Roger I. At the time of treaty, Guiscard was already leading an army in Calabria, in an attempt to fully subjugate the province, still partially held by the Byzantines. After being invested of his titles, Guiscard returned to Calabria, where his army was besieging Cariati. Upon his arrival Cariati submitted, and, before winter, Rossano and Gerace followed. He briefly returned to Apulia to remove the Byzantine garrisons from Taranto and Brindisi, before returning once again in Calabria, where after a long and arduous siege, he conquered Reggio. Finally, he took Scilla, an island to which the Reggian garrison had fled. The complete control over Calabria opened the way to his planned conquest of Sicily.

===Conquest of Sicily===

Robert&#x27;s brother, Roger, had initially led a tiny force to attack Messina, but he was easily repulsed by the Saracen garrison. After that, Guiscard was once again forced to return to Apulia, under the threat of Byzantine emperor Constantine X&#x27;s army, which in January 1061 had begun besieging Melfi itself. The full weight of Guiscard&#x27;s army forced the Byzantines to retreat, and by May Apulia was free again.

Robert and Roger returned to Sicily, where in 1061 they took Messina by surprise with comparable ease. After fortifying the city, Guiscard allied himself with the emir of Syracuse, ibn al-Timnah, against the emir of Castrogiovanni, Ibn al-Hawas. The forces of Robert, Roger and their Muslim ally marched into central Sicily through Rometta, conquering Paternò. They then tried to besiege Castrogiovanni, failing to conquer the fort. In 1063 Robert left for Apulia to spend Christmas with Sikelgaita, leaving behind the fort of San Marco d&#x27;Alunzio (which he had named after San Marco Argentano, his castle in Calabria). In 1064 he returned to Sicily, bypassing Castrogiovanni and going straight for Palermo. His campsite was however infested with tarantulas, and the expedition was abandoned.

In 1071 the Norman County of Sicily was created, and given to Roger. A year later Palermo finally fell, and the rest of Sicily was gradually conquered. A last resistance was held by Benavert, emir of Syracuse, but he was ultimately defeated in 1086. The last Muslim holding in Sicily, Noto, fell in 1091. As a result of his Sicilian campaigns, Robert Guiscard is also referred to as &quot;Black Shirt Robert&quot; because throughout the campaign he wore elegant black clothing.

===Conquests of Bari, Salerno and Benevento===

While the Conquest of Sicily was still in progress, Robert had to fight once again with the Byzantines. The Byzantine forces had occupied Bari, on request of Robert&#x27;s nephew Abelard of Hauteville, who wanted to claim the throne for himself. Guiscard besieged the city by land and water for four years, until in 1071 the people decided to surrender; he would later repair the damages done by the siege. The Byzantines were finally chased off the Italian peninsula, and Robert now focused his attention on the various Lombard independent realms in southern Italy.

Robert firstly attacked the Principality of Salerno, held by his brother in law Gisulf II. Salerno was besieged and fell in December 1076, and Gisulf abandoned his castle with his court in May 1077. Robert then took the principality of Benevento in 1078. Pope Gregory VII was alarmed, as Benevento was considered possession of the papal state. Nevertheless, he decided not to enter a conflict with the Normans, as he was already busy with Emperor Henry IV due to the investiture controversy. Simon de Crépy negotiated an alliance with Guiscard on behalf of Gregory VII, and in June 1080 the Pope gave Guiscard claims on Abruzzi, Salerno, Amalfi, and on the March of Fermo. Robert would later return Benevento to the papacy in 1081.

===Against the Byzantines===
In his last campaign, Guiscard attacked the Byzantine Empire itself, supporting the cause of Raiktor, a monk who claimed to be deposed emperor Michael VII. Even after it was clear that Raiktor was lying, Robert didn&#x27;t stop, believing that he himself had the right to rule the Byzantine Empire since Constantine Doukas, son of the real Michael VII, had once been proposed to his daughter Olympias.

In May 1081 Robert sailed with an army of Norman and Lombard troop (1,300 knights according to Geoffrey Malaterra, up to 10,000 troops according to Orderic Vitalis). In October 1081 defeated Alexios I Komnenos in the Battle of Dyrrachium, and by 1082 he had occupied Corfu and Durazzo. In 1083, however, he was forced to return to Italy to help Pope Gregory VII, who was being besieged in Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo by Henry IV. In May 1084 Guiscard entered Rome, and forced Henry to retreat. A revolt of the citizens led to a three-day sack of the city, after which Robert escorted the Pope out of the city. Guiscard&#x27;s son Bohemond, who had remained in the Balkans, had by this time lost his father&#x27;s conquests. Robert returned to the Balkans and reoccupied Corfu and Cephalonia, with the help of Ragusa and other dalmatian cities under the rule of king Demetrius Zvonimir.

=== Death ===
On 17 July 1085, Guiscard died of a fever in Cephalonia, at Atheras, north of Lixouri. His remains were brought back to Italy, and he was buried in the Hauteville family mausoleum, the Abbey of Santissima Trinità in Venosa. The town of Fiskardo in Cephalonia is named after him. On his epigraph there are four Latin verses; the last one reads &quot;&quot;Hic terror mundi Guiscardus&quot;, which translates to &quot;Here (lies) Guiscard, terror of the world&quot;&quot;.

==Succession==
Robert&#x27;s oldest son, Bohemond, was declared illegitimate when Robert and Alberada&#x27;s marriage was annulled due to consanguinity. Thus, he was succeeded as Duke of Apulia and Calabria by his eldest son by Sikelgaita, Roger Borsa. Bohemond was initially supposed to inherit Robert&#x27;s conquests in the Balkans, but this didn&#x27;t happen as they were soon re-conquered by the Byzantines. He instead got some land around the city of Taranto. Bohemond would later become one of the leaders of the first crusade and the first prince of Antioch. Guiscard&#x27;s other sons, Guy and Robert Scalio, never claimed any title for themselves.

The descendants of Robert&#x27;s brother, Roger I, Count of Sicily, would later create the Kingdom of Sicily.

==Religion==
Due to his conquest of Calabria and Sicily, Guiscard was instrumental in bringing Latin Christianity to an area that had historically followed the Byzantine rite. Guiscard laid the foundation of the Salerno Cathedral and of a Norman monastery at Sant&#x27;Eufemia Lamezia in Calabria. This latter monastery, famous for its choir, began as a community of eleven monks from Saint-Evroul in Normandy under the abbot Robert de Grantmesnil.

Although his relationship with the pope was rocky, Guiscard preferred to be on good terms with the papacy, and he made a gesture of abandoning his first wife in response to church law. While the popes were often fearful of his growing power, they preferred the strong and independent hand of a Catholic Norman to the rule of a Byzantine Greek. Guiscard received his investment with Sicily at the hands of Pope Nicholas II, who feared the opposition of the Holy Roman Emperor to the Papal reforms more. Guiscard supported the reforms, coming to the rescue of a besieged Pope Gregory VII, who had once excommunicated him for encroaching on the territory of the Papal States. After the Great Schism of 1054, the polarized religious atmosphere served to strengthen Guiscard&#x27;s alliance with papal forces, resulting in a formidable papal-Norman opposition to the Eastern Empire.

==Marriage and issue==

Guiscard&#x27;s first wife was Alberada of Buonalbergo, whom he married in 1051. They had two children:
* Bohemond I, prince of Antioch.
* Emma, married Odo the Good Marquis

Guiscard and Alberada&#x27;s marriage was later annulled, and in 1058 or 1059 he remarried to Sichelgaita. They had ten children:
* Matilda, married to Count Ramon Berenguer II of Barcelona.
* Roger Borsa, Duke of Apulia and Calabria.
* Mabel, married to William de Grandmesnil.
* A daughter (maybe named Héria), married to Count Hugh V of Maine.
* Robert Scalio
* Guy
* Sibylla, married to Count Ebles II of Roucy.
* Olympias (renamed Helena), betrothed to Constantine Doukas.
* Cecile
* Gaitelgrima, married to Humphrey, Count of Sarno.

==Depictions==
In the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, Dante sees Guiscard&#x27;s spirit in the Heaven of Mars, along with other &quot;warriors of the faith&quot; who exemplify the cardinal virtue of fortitude. In the &quot;Inferno&quot;, Dante describes Guiscard&#x27;s enemies as a field of mutilated shades stretching out to the horizon.

Guiscard was the protagonist of Kleist&#x27;s verse drama &quot;Robert Guiskard&quot;, incomplete at the author&#x27;s death (1811).

<doc id="157904" wikidata="Q315297" url="?curid=157904" title="Roger I of Sicily">
<text>Roger I (; ; ; Norse: &quot;Rogierr&quot;; 1031 – 22 June 1101), nicknamed &quot;Roger Bosso&quot; and &quot;Grand Count Roger&quot;, was a Norman nobleman who became the first Grand Count of Sicily from 1071 to 1101.

As a member of the House of Hauteville, he participated in several military expeditions against the Emirate of Sicily (beginning in 1061). He was later invested with part of Sicily by his brother, Robert Guiscard, Duke of Apulia, in 1071. By 1090, he had conquered the entire island. In 1091, he conquered Malta. The state he created was merged with the Duchy of Apulia in 1127 and became the Kingdom of Sicily in 1130. His descendants in the male line continued to rule Sicily down to 1194.

== Early life ==
Roger was born in Normandy, probably in the village of Hauteville-la-Guichard, of which his father was &quot;seigneur&quot;. He was the youngest son of Tancred de Hauteville and his second wife Fressenda. Through his mother he was possibly grandson of Richard the Fearless. Little is known about his and his brothers&#x27; lives before the expeditions to Southern Italy.

==Arrival to Italy and Conquest of Calabria==
Roger arrived in Southern Italy as a young man in the summer of 1057. The Benedictine monk Goffredo Malaterra, who compares Robert Guiscard and his brother Roger to &quot;Joseph and Benjamin of old,&quot; gives this description of Roger: 
His travel to Italy, together with his brother Robert, was caused by the death of their older half-brother Humphrey, Count of Apulia. While Robert, being the oldest among the two, inherited the main title, Roger became his vassal after being given the newly conquered County of Calabria.

For a time, Roger lived like a bandit in his castle of Scalea, near Cosenza. In a treaty of 1062, the brothers divided the conquest so that each &quot;was to have half of every castle and town in Calabria&quot;. Roger then established his court at Mileto. On Christmas 1061, he married Judith d&#x27;Évreux, daughter of the count of Évreux, William.

The two brothers then conquered Reggio, the only city in Calabria still under Greco-Roman control, after a long and difficult siege. The fort of Squillace, where the Byzantine soldiers took refuge, was taken too. From the fortresses of Calabria, the two brothers started planning the conquest of Sicily, at the time controlled by Muslims.

== Expeditions to Sicily ==
At the time, Sicily was ruled by Muslims, and the population was composed mostly of Byzantine Greek Christians. The Arab princes controlling the island had become all but independent from the sultan of Tunis.

Robert and Roger found the excuse to invade Sicily after the request for help from Ibn al-Thumna, emir of Catania, who was at war with his brother-in-law, Ibn al-Hawwas, emir of Agrigento. In May 1061 the brothers crossed from Reggio and captured Messina. From then on, they advanced almost undisturbed all the way to Castrogiovanni.
A disagreement between Roger and Robert led the former to leave Sicily, but he quickly returned along with Countess Judith to defend the inhabitants of Troina, then threatened by the Muslims. He was well received by the Greek peasants. While Roger was seizing Nicosia, however, the same Greeks tried to capture the poorly-guarded countess, and Roger had to turn back to save his wife. Despite the Muslims joining forces with the Greeks, Roger managed to defeat them and continued his advance.
In June 1063, Roger defeated a Muslim army at the famous Battle of Cerami. Even if Goffredo Malaterra reports an utterly exaggerated account of the battle, we know that Serlo II, Roger&#x27;s nephew, led a smaller army in the conflict. According to legend, Saint Michael Archangel, shining with light, appeared galloping in front of the Christians and guided them to victory.

After putting together an army of 500 soldiers, Roger tried to seize control of Palermo, but after three months of scarce results, he decided to abandon the idea. His demeanor kept increasing, and he won another important victory at the Battle of Misilmeri in 1068, against a much bigger Islamic army.

After Duke Robert conquered Bari, last Byzantine holding in Italy, in 1070, he redirected his focus to Sicily, and helped Roger in the conquest of the island&#x27;s major cities. In 1071, Roger was given the title of Grand Count of Sicily, while Robert kept Messina and Val Demone for himself. The two brothers besieged Palermo on opposite sides, and the Muslims resisted for 5 months. Then Guiscard managed to open a door for his brother to enter the city, and on 10 January 1072 Palermo was finally taken. Few cities remained for Sicily to be fully controlled.

When Robert died in 1085, Roger, being the senior member in the family, had to return to Apulia to settle the dispute among Bohemond, Robert&#x27;s first son by Alberada (considered illegitimate), and Roger Borsa, Robert&#x27;s first son by Sikelgaita. In return for supporting Roger Borsa, he got to keep Calabria, which had been given to him by Robert, for himself, and was later given Palermo in 1091.

Returned to Sicily, Roger went to war with Benavert, emir of Syracuse and Noto. On May 1086, together with his son Jordan, Roger launched an attack on Syracuse. In the middle of the night they attacked the Saracen fleet, taken by surprise. Roger directly jumped on Benavert&#x27;s galley, and the emir, frightened, tried to jump on another boat, but failed and drowned because of his heavy armor. Benavert&#x27;s death caused confusion, and in October Syracuse surrendered because of hunger.

After Syracuse, in 1087 Agrigento fell to the Normans, together with Castrogiovanni, as they were both held by emir Kamut. During the siege of Butera in 1089, Roger was notified about the arrival of Pope Urban II at Troina, and had to leave the work to his men. He treated the Pope with utter respect and was given precious gifts. He then returned to Butera, which fell in 1090. Arrived at Mileto to celebrate his marriage to Adelaide del Vasto, he received some ambassadors from the city of Noto who asked for peace and surrendered to Sicily. Finally, in 1091, Roger controlled the whole island.

Roger&#x27;s rule in Sicily became more absolute than that of Robert Guiscard in Italy. In addition, due to immigration by Lombards and Normans, Latin Christianity gradually replaced that of the Greek Byzantine tradition. At the enfeoffments of 1072 and 1092, no great undivided fiefs were created. The mixed Norman, French and Italian vassals all owed their benefices to the count. No feudal revolt of importance arose against Roger.

==Conquest of Malta==

In 1091 Roger, in order to avoid an attack from North Africa, set sail with a fleet to conquer Malta. His ship reached the island before the rest. On landing, the few defenders the Normans encountered retreated and the following day Roger marched to the capital Mdina. Terms were discussed with the local &quot;qadi&quot;. It was agreed that the islands would become tributaries of the count himself and that the &quot;qadi&quot; should continue to administer the islands. With the treaty many Greek and other Christian prisoners were released, who chanted to Roger the &quot;Kyrie eleison&quot;. He left the islands with many who wished to join him and so many were on his ship that it nearly sank, according to Geoffrey Malaterra. The invasion was romanticized in later centuries, and legends arose that the Count gave the Maltese their red and white flag by cutting a part of his banner. Mass is said once a year in remembrance of the Count at the Cathedral of Mdina, as a recognition for the count&#x27;s role in liberating Maltese Christians from Muslim dominance and sex.

==Rule of Sicily==

Politically supreme, the count also became master of the island&#x27;s church. The Papacy, favouring a prince who had recovered Sicily from Greeks and Muslims, in 1098 granted Roger and his heirs the apostolic legateship of the island. Roger created new Latin bishoprics at Syracuse, Girgenti and elsewhere, nominating the bishops personally, while he turned the archbishopric of Palermo into a Catholic see. Of these bishops and other important clergy positions, a minority were French, and of those even fewer were Norman. Of the five new sees he founded, one bishop was Norman and three others were from other parts of France. He practiced general toleration towards Arabs and Greeks, even sponsoring the construction of over twelve Greek monasteries in the Val Demone region. In the cities, the Muslims, who had generally secured such rights in their terms of surrender, retained their mosques, their qadis, and freedom of trade; in the country, however, they became serfs. Roger drew the mass of his infantry from the Muslims; Saint Anselm, visiting him at the siege of Capua, 1098, found &quot;the brown tents of the Arabs innumerable&quot;. Nevertheless, the Latin element began to prevail, as Lombards and other Italians flocked to the island in the wake of the conquest, and the conquest of Sicily proved decisive in the steady decline of Muslim power in the western Mediterranean from this time.

== Death and succession ==
Roger I died on 22 of June 1101 in Mileto and was buried at the Benedictine Abbey of the Holy Trinity. The abbey was destroyed in the earthquake of 1783. Its ruins are currently located in the Mileto Antica archaeological park.

Upon Roger&#x27;s death, his son, Simon of Hauteville, became the Count of Sicily, with his mother, Adelaide del Vasto, acting as his regent. On 28 September 1105, at the age of 12, Simon died, and the title of count passed to his younger brother, Roger II of Sicily, with Adelaide continuing on as regent, being the mother of Roger II as well.

==Marriage and issue==

Roger had three known illegitimate sons:
* Jordan (c. 1060 – 1092), commander, predeceased his father
* A certain William, legitimacy unclear, maybe son by first or second marriage
* Geoffrey (died c. 1120), Count of Ragusa. Legitimacy unclear, maybe son by first or second marriage. He had no chance of inheriting as he was affected by leprosy.

Roger&#x27;s first marriage took place in 1062, to Judith d&#x27;Évreux. The marriage produced only daughters:
* Flandina, first married to Hugh of Jarzé, first count of Paternò. When he died after 1075, she remarried to Henry del Vasto, second count of Paternò and brother of Adelaide del Vasto, Roger&#x27;s third wife.
* Matilda (c. 1062 – before 1094), first married to Robert of Aceto, count of Eu and lord of Hastings. She was repudiated by her husband, and remarried in 1080 to Raymond IV of Toulouse.
* Adelisa (died before 1096), married in 1083 to Henry, Count of Monte Sant&#x27;Angelo
* Emma (c. 1070 – 1120), briefly engaged to Philip I of France; married, firstly, William VI of Auvergne and, secondly, Rudolf of Montescaglioso.

In 1077, a year after Judith&#x27;s death, Roger married a second time, to Eremburga of Mortain. Their children were:
* Mauger (c. 1080 – c. 1100), Count of Troina
* Muriel (died 1119), married Josbert de Lucy
* Constance (1082 – after 1135), married Conrad II of Italy, son of Emperor Henry IV
* Felicia (died 1102), married Coloman, King of Hungary
* Judith (died 1136), married Robert I of Bassunvilla
* Sybilla, married Robert, son of Robert I of Burgundy.

In 1087 Eremburga died, and Roger remarried to Adelaide del Vasto, a sister of his son-in-law Henry del Vasto. Roger and Adelaide&#x27;s children were:

* Matilda (died before 1094), married Ranulf II, Count of Alife and pretender to the Duchy of Apulia
* Simon (1093–1105), Count of Sicily
* Roger II (1095–1154), King of Sicily
* Maximilla, also called Matilda (died after 1137), married Ildebrandino VI Aldobrandeschi family.

One of Roger&#x27;s daughters, named Matilda, married Guigues III, Count of Albon.

<text>Noto (; ) is a city and in the Province of Syracuse, Sicily, Italy. It is southwest of the city of Syracuse at the foot of the Iblean Mountains. It lends its name to the surrounding area Val di Noto. In 2002 Noto and its church were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==Etymology==
Noto is regarded as having a possible Ancient Greek etymology. Likely, the name is derived from &quot;south&quot; (Greek: Νότιο &quot;Notio&quot;), as in Notion.

==History==
The old town, Noto Antica, lies directly north on Mount Alveria. A city of Sicel origin, it was known as Netum in ancient times. In 263 BCE the city was granted to Hiero II by the Romans. According to legend, Daedalus stayed in the city after his flight over the Ionian Sea, as did Hercules after his seventh task. During the Roman era, it opposed the magistrate Verres.

In 866 it was conquered by the Muslims, who elevated the city to become a capital of one of the three districts of the island (the Val di Noto). In 1091, it became the last Islamic stronghold in Sicily to fall to the Christians. Later it became a rich Norman city.

In the 16th and 17th centuries, the city was home to several notable intellectual figures, including Giovanni Aurispa, jurists Andrea Barbazio and Antonio Corsetto, as well as architect Matteo Carnelivari and composer Mario Capuana. In 1503 King Ferdinand III granted it the title of &quot;civitas ingeniosa&quot; (&quot;Ingenious City&quot;). In the following centuries, the city expanded, growing beyond its medieval limits, and new buildings, churches and convents were built.

The medieval town of Noto was virtually razed by the 1693 Sicilian earthquake. Over half the population is said to have died from the earthquake. It was decided to rebuild the town at the present site, on the left bank of the River Asinaro, closer to the Ionian shore. These circumstances have led this town to have a unique architectural homogeneity since the core of the town was all built over the next decades after the calamity in what is a typical and highly preserved example of Sicilian baroque. The layout followed a grid system by Giovanni Battista Landolina and utilized the sloping hillside for scenographic effects. The architects Rosario Gagliardi, Francesco Sortino and others each participated in designing multiple structures. The town was dubbed the &quot;Stone Garden&quot; by Cesare Brandi and is currently listed among UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage Sites. Many of the newer structures are built of a soft tufa stone, which assumes a honey tonality under sunlight. Parts of the cathedral, however, unexpectedly collapsed in 1996.

The city, which had lost its provincial capital status in 1817, rebelled against the House of Bourbon on 16 May 1860, leaving its gates open to Giuseppe Garibaldi and his expedition. Five months later, on 21 October, a plebiscite sealed the annexation of Noto to Piedmont.

In 1844, Noto was named a diocese, but in 1866 suffered the abolition of the religious guilds, which had been deeply linked to the city&#x27;s structures and buildings.

Noto was freed from the fascist dictatorship of Benito Mussolini in July 1943 when the town was liberated by British troops under General Bernard Montgomery as part of the opening phase of Operation Husky, the allied mission to liberate Sicily. The Notinesi people voted in favour of the monarchy in the referendum of 1946.

===Archaeological sites===
The remains of Noto&#x27;s ancient structures are almost entirely hidden beneath the ruins of the mediaeval town, except for three chambers cut into the rock. One is noted by an inscription in the library at Noto to have belonged to a gymnasium, while the other two were &quot;heroa&quot; (shrines of heroes). Explorations have discovered four cemeteries dating to the third Sicel period and one from the Greek period. Among other finds are catacombs of the Christian period and several Byzantine tombs.

About south of Noto, on the left bank of the Tellaro (Helorus) river, stands a stone column about high, which is believed to be a memorial to the surrender of Nicias. In the 3rd century BC, a tomb was excavated in the rectangular area which surrounds it, destroying an apparently pre-existing tomb. Remnants of a later burial site belonging to the necropolis of the small town of Helorus, to the southeast, have been discovered. The Villa Romana del Tellaro is a Roman villa located south of Noto.

===Nature reserves===
Two nature reserves can be found near Noto: the Riserva naturale orientata Cavagrande del Cassibile, established in 1990, and the Riserva naturale orientata Oasi Faunistica di Vendicari, established in 1984.

==Culture==

In the Noto neighbourhood, a 32-m radiotelescope was installed by the Istituto di Radioastronomia di Bologna as part of the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche. It works in collaboration with a similar instrument in Medicina, Bologna. 

The city has held an annual flower festival, the Infiorata, every May since the 1980s, lining the Corrado Nicolaci with floral mosaics.

One episode of the movie &quot;L&#x27;Avventura&quot; (1960) directed by Michelangelo Antonioni was shot in Noto and features views of its cathedral and square.

==Economy==
The local area is home to several quality wine producers.

<doc id="157907" wikidata="Q468653" url="?curid=157907" title="Tancred, King of Sicily">
<text>Tancred (; 113820 February 1194) was King of Sicily from 1189 to 1194. He was born in Lecce, an illegitimate son of Roger III, Duke of Apulia (the eldest son of King Roger II) by his mistress Emma, a daughter of Achard II, Count of Lecce. He inherited the title &quot;Count of Lecce&quot; from his grandfather and is consequently often referred to as Tancred of Lecce. Due to his short stature and unhandsome visage, he was mocked by his critics as &quot;The Monkey King&quot;.

== Early career ==
After the death of Duke Roger, to prevent any future trouble, King Roger II kept Tancred and his younger brother William in close custody in Palermo.

On 9 March 1161, Tancred joined his uncle Simon, Prince of Taranto, in invading the palace, detained the king and queen, William I and Margaret, and their two sons, and incited a massacre of Muslims. Originally, the older of these two sons, Roger IV, Duke of Apulia, was destined to be crowned in place of William, but soon the populace supported the accession of Simon himself. Before Simon could put himself forward as a candidate, however, the rebellion had broken down and the people were restless. The insurrectionists were forced to free the king and retreat to their castles. Pardon was given them on condition of exile and many, including Tancred, took the offer. Tancred was exiled to Constantinople and returned to Sicily in 1166 upon the accession of the new king, his cousin William II.

In 1174, a large fleet, led by Tancred on behalf of William II, sailed to Egypt and briefly besieged the city of Alexandria. The Sicilians realised that their expected allies would not be coming (due to King Amalric I of Jerusalem&#x27;s death) and with Saladin&#x27;s army approaching they returned to their ships and sailed home.

As William II was heirless, Tancred had a chance to claim the throne; to prevent this, in October 1184 William released his aunt Constance from monastery, approved her marriage and designated her as his heir.

In June 1185, Tancred led a huge Sicilian fleet of 300 ships under the command of Richard, Count of Acerra his brother-in-law to Durazzo to attack the core of the Byzantine Empire. In August, surrounded by navy and army, Thessaloniki was occupied and looted. The Sicilian army was then heavily damaged by the army of the Byzantine emperor Isaac II and was annihilated on the way back to the Balkans, while the fleet of Tancred returned to Sicily unharmed.

In June 1186, Tancred and Margaritus of Brindisi led the Norman fleet to Cyprus, whose Byzantine governor, Isaac Comnenus, had rebelled against Isaac II. They swiftly defeated the expeditionary force which Isaac II had sent against the rebels, capturing 70 warships. Margaritus was later made Count of Zakynthos, Cephalonia, and Ithaki.

Tancred was the governor of Lecce, where he built the Church of St. Nicholas in Catado (1180), the St. Maria church complex near Squinzano and the important works in Otranto Cathedral.

== Kingship ==
=== Accession ===
Despite having sworn fealty to Constance, as soon as William II died, in 1189, Tancred rebelled and seized control of the island. He was crowned early in 1190. His coup was backed by the vice chancellor Matthew d&#x27;Ajello and the official class, while the rival claims of Constance and her husband, Henry VI, King of the Romans, were supported by most of the nobles. Roger, Count of Andria, also a candidate for Sicilian throne, was among the supporters of Constance and Henry. Matthew d&#x27;Ajello managed to defame Roger, and in the same year Richard, Count of Acerra brother-in-law of Tancred tricked Roger into captivity and execution. Matthew also persuaded Pope Clement III to support Tancred, and Tancred appointed Matthew as chancellor.

=== Treaty with Richard ===
Tancred was a good soldier, though his tiny stature earned him the nickname &quot;Tancredulus&quot; from the poet chronicler Peter of Eboli. Despite a measure of popular support, his rule faced daunting challenges right from the start.

In 1190, King Richard I of England arrived in Sicily at the head of a large crusading army on its way to the Holy Land. Richard immediately demanded the release of his sister, William II&#x27;s wife Joan, imprisoned by Tancred in 1189, along with every penny of her dowry and dower (in response of her vocal support of Germans). He also insisted that Tancred fulfil the financial commitments made by William II to the crusade. When Tancred balked at these demands, Richard seized a monastery and the castle of La Bagnara.

Richard was joined in Sicily by the French crusading army, led by King Philip II. The presence of two foreign armies soon caused unrest among the locals. In October the people of Messina revolted, demanding that the foreigners leave the island. Richard responded by attacking Messina, which he captured on 4 October 1190. After the city had been looted and burned, Richard established his base there and decided to stay the winter.

Richard remained at Messina until March 1191, when Tancred finally agreed to a treaty. According to the treaty&#x27;s main terms:
*Joan was to be released, receiving her dower along with the dowry.
*Richard and Philip recognised Tancred as King of Sicily and vowed to keep the peace among all three of their kingdoms.
*Richard officially proclaimed his nephew Arthur of Brittany as his heir presumptive, and Tancred promised to marry one of his daughters to Arthur when he came of age (Arthur was four years old at the time).

After signing the treaty Richard and Philip finally left Sicily for the Holy Land. It is rumoured that before he left, Richard gave Tancred a sword he claimed was Excalibur in order to secure their friendship.

=== Contention with Constance ===
Having at last rid himself of the crusaders, Tancred next confronted the threat from the north. In April 1191 in Rome, Henry and Constance were crowned emperor and empress of the Holy Roman Empire by Pope Celestine III, and now the pair turned south to claim the Kingdom of Sicily. Constance accompanied her husband at the head of a substantial imperial army that descended into the Regno. The northern towns of the kingdom opened their gates to Henry, including the earliest Norman strongholds Capua and Aversa. Salerno, once Roger II&#x27;s mainland capital, sent word ahead that Henry was welcome and invited Constance to stay in her father&#x27;s old palace to escape the summer heat. Naples offered the first resistance of the whole campaign, withstanding a siege with the help of Margaritus of Brindisi&#x27;s fleet, until much of the imperial army had succumbed to malaria and disease. Eventually the imperial army was forced to withdraw from the kingdom altogether. Constance remained in Salerno with a small garrison, as a sign that Henry would soon return.

Once Henry had withdrawn with the bulk of the imperial army, the towns that had supposedly fallen to the empire immediately declared their allegiance to Tancred, for the most part now fearing his retribution. The populace of Salerno saw an opportunity to win some favour with Tancred and delivered Constance to him in Messina, an important prize given that Henry had every intention of returning. Tancred angrily blamed Constance for German invasion, but Constance, in her attire as empress, replied that she was taking back her dominion grabbed by Tancred. Despite this Tancred always treated his aunt, now detained, honourably with courtesy, which his wife Queen Sibylla strongly opposed, believing this would implicitly acknowledge the claim of the latter. Constance was sent to Palermo supervised by Sibylla, eating with her and sleeping in her bedroom. Sibylla suggested that Constance be put to death after sensing that the citizens of Palermo seemed to sympathize with her or view her as the legal heiress of Sicily, but Tancred did not agree, worrying that this would harm his popularity; instead, he suggested Sibylla to consult with Matthew d&#x27;Ajello, and after receiving a letter written by Matthew d&#x27;Ajello in presence of Sibylla, he had Constance locked in Castel dell&#x27;Ovo in Naples to be better-guarded. With the empress in his hand Tancred initially wanted to force Henry into a cease-fire and would not permit her to be ransomed unless Henry recognized him. In 1192 he created Margaritus Count of Malta, perhaps for his unexpected success in capturing the empress. However, Tancred was willing to give up his negotiation advantage, that is, his aunt, in exchange for Pope Celestine III legitimizing him as King of Sicily. In turn, the Pope was hoping that by securing Constance&#x27;s safe passage back to Rome, Henry would be better disposed towards the papacy, and he was still hoping to keep the empire and the kingdom from uniting. Under the Pope&#x27;s threat of excommunication, Tancred was forced to do so and gave Constance gifts. However, imperial soldiers were able to intervene at the borders of the Papal States before Constance made it to Rome; and they returned her safely across the Alps in summer 1192. So both Tancred and Pope effectively gained nothing from the captivity of the Empress.

Henry had left garrisons along the frontiers of the Regno. Tancred now sought to win over the towns by extensive grants of privileges. At Gravina (June 1192) he reinforced his papal support by surrendering the royal legateship over Sicily. In 1192 and 1193 he personally led successful campaigns against the Apulian barons. But his death at Palermo (20 February 1194) two months after that of his young son and co-king, Roger III, opened the way for Hohenstaufen rule in Sicily.

His widow, Sibylla of Acerra, established a regency for their son, William III, but Henry returned to Italy later that year, with his army financed by the lucrative ransom of Richard I. Naples surrendered in May, almost without a blow, and the rest of the Regno followed. Sibylla and the loyal Margaritus prepared to defend Palermo, but the citizens admitted the Emperor on 20 November 1194. Tancred&#x27;s family fell into Henry&#x27;s hands, and William III, rumoured castrated and blinded, seemed to have died in Germany in 1198. Henry also had the body of Tancred pulled out of his grave.

<doc id="157908" wikidata="Q646525" url="?curid=157908" title="Battle of Turnhout (1597)">
<text>The Battle of Turnhout, also known as the Battle of Tielenheide, was fought on 24 January 1597 by allied forces of the Dutch Republic and the Kingdom of England against those of the Spanish Empire. The battle took place near Turnhout in the Southern Netherlands (now in modern-day Belgium), and was part of the Eighty Years&#x27; War and the concurrent Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604).

The engagement occurred as the Spanish were withdrawing ahead of an impending Dutch and English attack on their winter quarters in Turnhout (which did not have defensive walls), to Herentals, the nearest fortified town, to the southwest. The vanguard of the allied army caught up with the Spanish column en route to Herentals, and after some skirmishing, both armies confronted each other on a heath called Tielenheide. The Spanish cavalry was driven off, after which the English and Dutch cavalry fell upon the disordered Spanish infantry who were routed with heavy casualties.

==Background==
After the successful attack on Cadiz in 1596, the English forces allied to the Dutch led by Sir Francis Vere were urgently required back in the Netherlands and went there directly. The severe damage from the raid contributed to the bankruptcy of Spain for the third time, which meant that payments to their armies dried up, leading to frequent mutinies. In addition, many Spanish troops had been sent from the Spanish Netherlands to France by Philip II of Spain to assist the Catholic League in the French Wars of Religion.

During the winter of 1596/1597 Archduke Albert&#x27;s Spanish army of 4,500 under the command of the Burgundian Philibert de Rye, Count Varax, had advanced to the town of Turnhout, about south of the Dutch city of Breda; their design was to surprise the town of Tholen in a rare winter offensive.

Varax had under his command four infantry units: the Tercio of Naples led by the Marquis of Treviso, the Germans under the Count of Sulz, and two Walloon and Burgundian regiments under the Comtes de Hachicourt and de Barlaymont. The cavalry under Nicolo Basta comprised four squadrons of Spanish horse commanded by Juan de Cordova, Alonzo de Mendoza, Juan de Guzman and Alonzo Mondragon, and a Flemish unit under de Grubbendonck. These were split into two units, one of heavy demi-lancers and the other of lighter &quot;herreruelos&quot; (harquebusiers).&lt;ref name=&quot;Coetzee/Eysturlid&quot;&gt;Coetzee &amp; Eysturlid pp 117-18&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch Stadtholder, Maurice of Nassau, had received orders from the States General to collect a force at Geertruidenberg to counter this Spanish threat. Though the town was not walled, Turnhout was strategically important - it held a small castle surrounded by a moat and contained a garrison of forty men. A force of nearly 6,800 infantry with two demi-cannons and two field pieces was assembled at Geertruidenberg. Six companies of Dutch infantry were under Maurice, and the counts of Hohenlohe, Brederode, and Solms arrived with contingents gathered from their various garrisons. Vere led the English force once more - nearly two-thirds of Maurice&#x27;s army were in fact English and Scots. A minority were subsidized allied troops or &#x27;religious volunteers&#x27;, most of whom were long-term mercenaries sent by Elizabeth I. Among these were Sir Alexander Murray&#x27;s regiment of Scots, as well as eight companies of English infantry under the command of Captain Henry Docwra. The cavalry totaled 800 men commanded by Marcellus Bacx and included a contingent of one hundred elite cuirassiers made up of volunteers from among the English gentry, &#x27;the gentlemen of the [Protestant] religion&#x27;, under Sir Robert Sydney and Sir Nicholas Parker.

On the morning of 23 January 1597 the allied army departed Geertruidenberg in four divisions, with the cavalry on the flanks. In a one-day forced march of in poor road conditions they managed to reach the village of Ravels that evening ( northeast of Turnhout), and made camp.

At midnight the Dutch and English broke camp and approached the outskirts of Turnhout.

==Battle==

Varax heard exaggerated reports of the size of Maurice&#x27;s approaching army; this information and the lack of defensive walls at Turnhout caused him to immediately order a withdrawal south to the fortified town of Herentals. By daybreak of 24 January the whole of the Spanish force was en route to Herentals. Maurice soon discovered that the Spanish rearguard had marched out of the village just before his arrival. The country was intersected in all directions by hedges and ditches and having reached the banks of the river Aa, Varax removed all but one plank from the wooden bridge that crossed it. Parties of Spanish musketeers were stationed on the other side to contest any crossing attempt, but the English advance guard swiftly forced them off.

English carabineers and musketeers were sent forward to follow and engage the Spanish rearguard and a skirmish ensued which continued for . Dutch musketeers crossed the bridge, while others, with the cavalry, traversed the river at a nearby ford. The Spanish were now in full retreat, while Maurice ordered the whole of the Anglo-Dutch cavalry to pursue, leaving his infantry and artillery well behind, struggling with the muddy road.

Having come across a large wood further on from the river, Vere called up his detached musketeers and placed them along the edges to conceal them. These skirmishers kept up a constant harassing fire on the Spanish rearguard, while Vere along with sixteen horsemen followed them along the highway in full sight and at the same time sent back a report to Maurice to come up in support. Vere had his horse shot from under him which slightly wounded his leg, but continued to lead on foot, until he was remounted. This skirmish between the Anglo-Dutch scouting force and the Spanish rearguard lasted for over three hours until the main body of the former&#x27;s cavalry arrived. The Spanish had by then emerged onto the Tielenheide, an open heath suitable for cavalry action.

Varax formed his infantry in four solid squares of pikemen in column in the open space of the heath as they marched south, with musketeers on the flanks as was standard practice for the Spanish. His cavalry and wagons had entered an enclosed lane beyond the heath. The first square consisted of Germans led by the Count of Sulz, followed by the Walloons and Burgundians. The Marquis of Treviso brought up the rear with the veteran Spanish and Italian troops. Vere continued to follow them, until all of Maurice&#x27;s cavalry had joined with him having emerged from the wood. The Anglo-Dutch then formed on the heath in front of the Spanish.

The Spanish steadily continued their march but as they became aware of the allied movements on their left, their cavalry changed position and transferred from the right to the left of the line and rode between the infantry and the belt of woods. After the first volley by Vere&#x27;s musketeers the Spanish harquebusiers on foot broke and fled. Varax ordered his cavalry to cover the retreat but Count Hohenlohe and his Dutch cavalry charged the Spanish right flank, as Vere followed suit upon their rear. Hohenlohe fell upon Sulz&#x27;s regiment of Germans while Vere&#x27;s English and Bacx&#x27;s Dutch cavalry assailed the Spanish rearguard. The surprise was complete; the Spanish cavalry which included the famed squadrons of Guzman, Mondragon, and Mendoza were hit hard at the first onset and within moments retreated for the opening of the enclosed lane. Most of them escaped through this into the boggy ground beyond. Several companies of Parker&#x27;s cavalry galloped down the Herentals road, in pursuit of the Spanish cavalry and baggage.

With the Spanish cavalry having been driven off, the Dutch and English cavalry fell upon the disordered Spanish infantry. The Walloon regiments tried to form a line with the flank protected by a copse, but their morale was already low after witnessing the flight of their cavalry. When they saw in the distance the mass of Dutch infantry approaching to support their cavalry they broke and tried to swim across the Aa river to reach Herentals. The musketeers of Sultz&#x27;s regiment fell back in confusion upon the pikemen behind them and the whole formation promptly surrendered en masse upon being charged by the Anglo-Dutch cavalry. The veteran tercio under Treviso managed to deploy in combat formation and resisted manfully for some time, but Vere and Bacx&#x27;s charge upon them was decisive. The Dutch and English troopers rode up very close to the massed ranks of the Spanish infantry and discharged their pistols and carbines at point-blank range, inflicting carnage. Varax, fighting in the front line with his men, was among the casualties. The cuirassiers&#x27; fire opened gaps within the Spanish ranks into which the troopers rode in and started attacking the formation from within, rapidly causing a rout.

While the veteran Spanish troops were fighting, the surviving Germans in the front and the other infantry in the rear had been simultaneously shattered and the panicked survivors swamped the two other regiments, those of Hachicourt and La Barlotte which were placed between them, masking their fire and spreading panic among them. The English and Dutch soon broke these formations as well and put nearly all of the Spanish infantry to flight. The pursuing cavalry harried them and the Spanish infantry were &quot;cut down with terrible slaughter&quot;. Parker&#x27;s cavalry had in the meantime gone through the enclosed lane and plundered the Spanish baggage train. The Spanish had been completely routed and the battle had lasted no more than half an hour.

The remnants of the Spanish force managed to retreat to Herentals where Nicolo Basta took command and rallied the survivors.
==Aftermath==
Out of 4,000 Spanish soldiers and 500 horsemen nearly half were casualties; 2000 were killed or wounded. In addition thirty-eight ensigns were taken and prisoners numbered around 600. Of the allied force only fifty were casualties including ten killed. The whole action was won by around 800 Dutch and English horsemen and the majority of the Dutch infantry were never brought into action. That night the victors rested in Turnhout; the next morning the castle there capitulated and the Dutch promptly burned parts of it. However, Maurice had to leave the town after several days before the arrival of Spanish reinforcements led by the Archduke Albert, including the Spanish infantry of Francisco Velasco and several cavalry units, joined by the survivors of the battle. The allied force then began their return march to Geertruidenberg. The victory at Turnhout therefore did not result in any long-term strategic gain as there was no follow up.

On 8 February Maurice returned to The Hague - the captured Spanish flags were displayed in the Ridderzaal (the political headquarters of the States General) as a symbol of victory. The prisoners were treated with kindness and the wounded were cared for, and the body of Varax was sent to the Archduke. In return Albert assured the Stadtholder that he would follow his generous example for the duration of the war. The English under Vere and Sidney greatly distinguished themselves. Vere accompanied Sidney to Willemstad, wrote his official despatches and gave them to one of Sidney&#x27;s captains to deliver in England. Both generals spoke generously of each other - Vere thought that Sidney excelled in battle, being one of the first that charged. Sidney reported that the victory was only due to Vere.

News of the victory was received in England with great rejoicing, and congratulations poured in on all sides. The satirist Stephen Gosson composed a sermon called the &quot;Trumpet of Warre&quot; a justification of war with Spain. The battle was even dramatised in London, and introduced on the stage known as the &quot;Overthrow of Turnholt&quot;. All of the officers who were present at the battle were impersonated.

Queen Elizabeth I of England herself wrote to Vere on February 7, 1597, in the following terms:

===Analysis===
At the time the battle was of great importance for the evolution of mounted warfare for two reasons:

The first impact was that Maurice&#x27;s army had demonstrated the superiority of the new type of cavalry, the cuirassiers or reiters, as used by Henry IV of France at the battle of Ivry. The cuirassiers wore half-armour and a light helmet and were armed with several pistols but also carried carbines as well as a sword. No lances were carried, so instead of being arrayed in a thin line (&quot;en haye&quot;) to maximize the number of lances being deployed they charged in dense formations (eight ranks deep) and fired their pistols only at the moment of contact. This tactic, which had already defeated French gendarmes (lancers in full armour) at Ivry, proved to be effective as well against the lighter Spanish demi-lancers.

The second impact was that the Dutch and English cuirassiers, with the support of a few hundred musketeers, had destroyed a Spanish tercio without the help of their own heavy infantry. These lessons on the value of the cuirassiers were quickly learned and most European armies abandoned the use of lancers soon after, with only the Poles retaining them within their famed husaria. The Spaniards finally drew their own conclusions after their defeat at Nieuwpoort three years later.
== Cultural ==
Music composer Kevin Houben commemorated the battle in his concert work, &quot;Thyellene: The Battle on the Heath&quot;. In September 2008, Brassband Kempenzonen Tielen played this work on the site where once the battle took place.

The victory at Turnhout inspired the writing of the Dutch hymn &quot;We Gather Together&quot;.

<text>Repentance is reviewing one&#x27;s actions and feeling contrition or regret for past or present wrongdoings, which is accompanied by commitment to and actual actions that show and prove a change for the better.

In modern times, it is generally seen as involving a commitment to personal change and the resolve to live a more responsible and humane life. In other words, being sorry for one&#x27;s misdeeds. It can also involve sorrow over a specific sin or series of sins that an individual feels guilt over, or conviction that they have committed. The practice of repentance plays an important role in the soteriological doctrines of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

Analogous practices have been found in other world religions as well. In religious contexts, it often involves an act of confession to God or to a spiritual elder (such as a monk or priest). This confession might include an admission of guilt, a promise or intent not to repeat the offense, an attempt to make restitution for the wrong, or in some way reverse the harmful effects of the wrong where possible.

== Judaism ==

Repentance (, literally, &quot;return&quot;, pronounced &quot;tshuva&quot; or &quot;teshuva&quot;) is one element of atoning for sin in Judaism. Judaism recognizes that everybody sins on occasion, but that people can stop or minimize those occasions in the future by repenting for past transgressions. Thus, the primary purpose of repentance in Judaism is ethical self transformation.

A Jewish penitent is traditionally known as a &quot;baal teshuva&quot; (&quot;lit.&quot;, &quot;master of repentance&quot; or &quot;master of return&quot;) (; for a woman: , &quot;baalat teshuva&quot;; plural: , &quot;baalei teshuva&quot;). An alternative modern term is &quot;hozer beteshuva&quot; () (&quot;lit.&quot;, &quot;returning in repentance&quot;). &quot;In a place where &quot;baalei teshuva&quot; stand&quot;, according to halakha, &quot;even the full-fledged righteous do not stand.&quot;

== Christianity ==

Repentance is a stage in Christian salvation where the believer turns away from sin. As a distinct stage in the &quot;ordo salutis&quot;, the Reformed theological tradition argues that it occurs after faith. In Orthodox, Roman Catholic and Lutheran theology, repentance is part of the larger theological concept behind the sacrament of confession and absolution.

Christian denominations that adhere to the liturgical kalendar, such as Catholicism, Lutheranism, Moravianism and Anglicanism, focus on repentance especially during the season of Lent, while emphasizing its importance in the life of the believer throughout the year.

== Islam ==

&quot;Tawba&quot; is the Islamic concept of repenting to God due to performing any sins and misdeeds. It is a direct matter between a person and God, so there is no intercession. There is no original sin in Islam. It is the act of leaving what God has prohibited and returning to what he has commanded. The word denotes the act of being repentant for one&#x27;s misdeeds, atoning for those misdeeds, and having a strong determination to forsake those misdeeds (remorse, resolution, and repentance). If someone sins against another person, restitution is required.

== Hinduism ==
Dharma Shastras and Vedas advocate for self-reflection, repentance paschatapa and atonement prayaschitta. Stories such as that of Ajamila speak about forgiveness by grace of God even to the worst sinners.

== Buddhism ==
The Buddha considered shame over doing wrong (Pali: &quot;hiri&quot;) and fear of the consequences of wrongdoing (Pali:&quot;otappa&quot;) as essential safeguards against falling into evil ways and further as extremely useful in the path of purification. Also recommended was the regular practice of self-assessment or wise reflection (Pali: &quot;yoniso manasikara&quot;) on one&#x27;s own actions in relation to others and the bigger picture.

In Mahayana Buddhism, one of the most common repentance verses used for reflection is Samantabhadra&#x27;s Repentance Verse taken from Chapter 40 of the Flower Adornment Sutra:
&lt;poem&gt;
 For all the evil deeds I have done in the past 
 Created by my body, mouth, and mind, 
 From beginningless greed, anger, and delusion, 
 I now know shame and repent of them all.&quot; 
&lt;/poem&gt;

== Hawaiian religion ==
&quot;Hooponopono&quot; (ho-o-pono-pono) is an ancient practice in Hawaiian religion of reconciliation and forgiveness, combined with (repentance) prayers. Similar forgiveness practices were performed on islands throughout the South Pacific, including Samoa, Tahiti and New Zealand. Traditionally &quot;hooponopono&quot; is practiced by healing priests or &quot;kahuna lapaau&quot; among family members of a person who is physically ill. Modern versions are performed within the family by a family elder, or by the individual alone.

<doc id="157910" wikidata="Q367415" url="?curid=157910" title="William I of Sicily">
<text>William I (1120 or 1121May 7, 1166), called the Bad or the Wicked (), was the second king of Sicily, ruling from his father&#x27;s death in 1154 to his own in 1166. He was the fourth son of Roger II and Elvira of Castile.

William&#x27;s title &quot;the Bad&quot; seems little merited and expresses the bias of the historian Hugo Falcandus and the baronial class against the king and the official class by whom he was guided.

==Early life==
William was the son of King Roger II of Sicily, grandson of Count Roger I of Sicily, and great-grandson of Tancred of Hauteville. He grew up with little expectation of ruling. The deaths of his three older brothers Roger, Tancred, and Alfonso between 1138 and 1148 changed matters, though when his father died William was still not well-prepared to take his place.

==Kingship==

On assuming power, William kept the administration which had guided his father&#x27;s rule for his final years. Only the Englishman Thomas Brun was removed, and the chancellor Maio of Bari was promoted. The real power in the kingdom was at first exercised by Maio, a man of low birth, whose title &quot;ammiratus ammiratorum&quot; was the highest in the realm. Maio continued Roger&#x27;s policy of excluding the nobles from the administration and that was one of the most hated laws made by a ruler in The Middle Ages, and sought also to curtail the liberties of the towns. The barons, always chafing against the royal power, were encouraged to revolt by Pope Adrian IV, whose recognition William had not yet sought, by the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Comnenus, and by the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I.

At the end of 1155, Roman troops recovered Bari, Trani, Giovinazzo, Andria, Taranto and began to besiege Brindisi. William and his army landed on the peninsula and destroyed the Roman fleet (4 ships) and army at Brindisi on May 28, 1156, and recovered Bari. Adrian came to terms at Benevento on June 18, 1156, where he and William signed the Treaty of Benevento, abandoning the rebels and confirming William as king. During the summer of 1157, William sent a fleet of 164 ships carrying 10,000 men to sack Euboea and Almira. In 1158 William made peace with the Romans.

These diplomatic successes were probably due to Maio; on the other hand, the African dominions were lost to the Almohads, and it is possible that he advised their abandonment in face of the dangers threatening the kingdom from the north. In 1156, a revolt began in Sfax and quickly spread and nothing was done to put it down. In 1159, the admiral Peter led a raiding expedition against the Saracen-held Balearic Islands with 160 ships. He tried to relieve besieged Mahdia with the same fleet, but turned around just after engaging in battle. Peter did not fall out of favour, but no further assistance was sent to the Christians holding out in Mahdia and the city surrendered on 11 January 1160, ending the &quot;African empire&quot;.

The policy of Maio led to a general conspiracy, and in November 1160 Maio was murdered in Palermo by Matthew Bonello, leader of the Sicilian nobles. The barons, however, had long been plotting to overthrow the king. Desiring a weak power on the throne, they had been eyeing the king&#x27;s eldest son, Roger IV, Duke of Apulia, as a possible replacement for his father.

After the assassination of Maio, the royal palace was stormed by two of the king&#x27;s own relatives: his illegitimate half-brother Simon, whom he had dispossessed of Taranto early in his reign and his bastard nephew Tancred, the count of Lecce. The king was captured along with his whole family, his life being barely spared by one Richard of Mandra. Roger was then paraded through the streets and it was announced that he would be crowned in the cathedral three days thence.

For a while the king remained in the hands of the conspirators who purposed murdering or just deposing him, but the people and the army rallied round him; he recovered power, crushed the Sicilian rebels, had Bonello blinded, and in a short campaign reduced the rest of the &quot;Regno&quot;, avenging the rebel burning of Butera. During the initial assault on the palace, to release the captive king, the king&#x27;s son Roger was killed by a wayward arrow (though the historian Falcandus, seemingly ever-ready to impugn the royal character, has the king kicking his &quot;faithless&quot; son dead).

==Later years==

Thus freed from feudal revolts, William confided the government to men trained in Maio&#x27;s school, creating a triumvirate: the grand protonotary, Matthew of Ajello; Count Sylvester of Marsico, who had inherited Maio&#x27;s property; and the Bishop Palmer of Syracuse, elect, but not consecrated. His latter years were peaceful; he became the champion of the true pope against the Holy Roman Emperor, and Alexander III was installed in the Lateran Palace in November 1165 by a guard of Normans.

William died on May 7, 1166, and was interred in Palermo Cathedral, although he was later moved to Monreale Cathedral by his son and heir William II of Sicily when that building was completed. By his wife, Margaret of Navarre, daughter of García Ramírez of Navarre, he had four sons:

#Roger IV, Duke of Apulia (1152–1161)
#Robert III, Prince of Capua (1153–c. 1160)
#William II of Sicily (1153–1189)
#Henry, Prince of Capua (1158–1172)

== Controversial accounts ==
&quot;De Mulieribus Claris&quot; by Boccaccio said that at the birth of Constance, whom it described as the daughter of William, a Calabrian abbot named Joachim told William that she would cause the destruction of Sicily. William believed the prediction and forced the young Constance to become a nun to prevent her from marrying and having children. This apparently contradicted the fact that Constance was indeed the posthumous daughter of Roger II and half-sister of William. Giovanni Villani said William I sought to put her to death due to the prediction until Tancred, a bastard son of Count Roger I of Sicily, persuaded him to send her to a convent instead.

Joachim Camerarius argued that Constance was simply sent to the convent during the coup against William I for her safety and stayed there until her betrothal without ever being a nun. Hugo Falcandus and Richard of San Germano argued Constance was brought up and educated in royal palace rather than a monastery. François Eudes de Mézeray said Constance had never become a nun.

<doc id="157911" wikidata="Q898338" url="?curid=157911" title="Battle of Turnhout (1789)">
<text>The Battle of Turnhout (27 October 1789) was a decisive military engagement between Belgian revolutionary and Austrian forces at Turnhout in the Austrian Netherlands (modern-day Belgium). It was the first engagement of the Brabant Revolution and took place shortly after the revolutionary (patriot) army of Jean-André van der Mersch crossed the border from the Dutch Republic where it had previously been in exile. Their unlikely victory in the engagement led to the rapid collapse of Austrian rule across the Southern Netherlands and the temporary withdrawal of Austrian forces in the region to Luxembourg.

==Context==
The Holy Roman Emperor, Joseph II, was an important figure of European Enlightenment and a believer in reforming institutions he believed to be outdated. As the head of Habsburg Austria and ruler of the Austrian Netherlands, he decreed a wide-reaching programme of reforms: Josephinism. He imposed his own policies in the internal affairs of the Church. Furthermore, he published a number of edicts reforming the law and administration of the territory with the aim of re-enforcing the power of the state.

These laws were received reluctantly by the people and the church, the bourgeois however saw them as an attack on their democracy and civil rights. In response, a movement of protests against Austrian rule appeared. In January 1789, the states of Brabant and Hainaut refused to pay imperial taxes. The Imperial response was an occupation of the County of Hainaut and a suspension of the rights guaranteed to the Duchy of Brabant on 18 June 1789. The Austrian military governor Count Richard d&#x27;Alton judged it useful to concentrate his troops in De Kempen and around Liège, leaving much of the remainder the Austrian Netherlands thinly protected.

===Resistance===
In May 1789, the secret society &quot;Pro aris et focis&quot; was founded in Brussels with the aim of gathering resistance against the emperor. At the same time, the &quot;Brabançons&quot; gathered an army in the United Provinces commanded by Jean-André van der Mersch. The army moved into Hoogstraten in Belgium without meeting severe Austrian opposition. In the town, Henri Van der Noot read the &quot;Manifesto of the People of Brabant&quot; proclaiming the end of Austrian control of the Southern Netherlands. Van der Noot proclaimed that the attack on southern Netherlands was a reaction to the Austrian Emperor who had not complied with the rights guaranteed by the Joyous Entry of 1356.

==Battle of Turnhout==

In October 1789, one of the two &quot;divisions&quot; of the patriotic army marched towards Brabant. It arrived in, and easily captured, Turnhout on the 25th. They had just left the town when they were informed that an Austrian force was moving towards them. Van der Mersch knew that a battle in open country would be futile and decided that his best chance would be to hold the town and fight in the streets, reducing the numerical advantage of the Austrian forces.

With the help of Emmanuel-Joseph Van Gansen, son of a brewer in Westerlo, the inhabitants of the town threw up barricades in the streets. A group took position in the square and another at the entrance to the town near a mill. The town of Turnhout was besieged by the Austrians on 27 October and a violent combat took place. As van der Meersch had hoped, the Austrian forces were not well prepared for fighting in the town itself and, after five hours of fighting, they were forced to retreat, leaving behind five cannons.

==Aftermath==
News of the victory at Turnhout spread over the Flanders and Brabant and resistance increased. The Brabant Revolution became a reality. The towns of Ghent, Diest, Tienen, and Brussels fell to the rebels. Austrian forces withdrew to the Duchy of Luxembourg.

On 31 December Brabant declared its own independence and was joined, in January 1790, by many other Belgian states leading to the creation of the United Belgian States.

==Commemoration==
Each year in the Turnhout battle is commemorated with a spectacle in the Gasthuisstraat, the location where the fighting was fiercest. A memorial by P. Brozius in the Market of Turnhout recalls this battle. The stone dates from 1889, on the occasion of the celebration of 100 years Battle of Turnhout.

<doc id="157912" wikidata="Q367387" url="?curid=157912" title="William II of Sicily">
<text>William II (December 115311 November 1189), called the Good, was king of Sicily from 1166 to 1189. From surviving sources William&#x27;s character is indistinct. Lacking in military enterprise, secluded and pleasure-loving, he seldom emerged from his palace life at Palermo. Yet his reign is marked by an ambitious foreign policy and a vigorous diplomacy. Champion of the papacy and in secret league with the Lombard cities, he was able to defy the common enemy, Frederick Barbarossa. In the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, Dante places William II in Paradise. He is also referred to in Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Decameron&quot; (tale IV.4, where he reportedly has two children, and tale V.7).

William was nicknamed &quot;the Good&quot; only in the decades following his death. It is due less to his character than to the cessation of the internal troubles that plagued his father&#x27;s reign and the wars that erupted under his successor. Under the Staufer dynasty his reign was characterised as a golden age of peace and justice. His numeral is contemporary and he himself used it.

==Kingship==

===Regency of his mother===
William was born in Palermo to William I and Margaret of Navarre. At the age of twelve his father died, and he was placed under the regency of his mother. In 1171 he was declared adult and until then the government was controlled first by the chancellor Stephen du Perche (1166–1168), cousin of Margaret, and then by Walter Ophamil, archbishop of Palermo, and Matthew of Ajello, the vice-chancellor.

In 1168, du Perche was overthrown by a coup, while the revolts claimed that William was murdered and du Perche planned to have his brother marry Constance, aunt of William who was confined to Santissimo Salvatore, Palermo as a nun from childhood due to a prediction that &quot;her marriage would destroy Sicily&quot;, to claim the throne, despite the existence of Henry, Prince of Capua brother of William.

===Marriage and alliances===
An effort by Bertrand II, archbishop of Trani, to negotiate the hand of Byzantine Princess Maria for William yielded no fruit and led to his breaking up with Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Comnenus in 1172. In 1173, the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa proposed William&#x27;s marriage with his daughter, Beatrice, but William refused to offend the pope.

In the same year the death of Henry, Prince of Capua marked a potential succession crisis: it was said that William II had Constance, the last legitimate heir to the throne, appointed heir and sworn fealty in 1174, but she remained confined in her monastery.

In 1174 and 1175 William made treaties with Genoa and Venice and his marriage in February 1177 with Joan, daughter of King Henry II of England and Duchess Eleanor of Aquitaine, marks his high position in European politics. Although Joan produced no surviving heir, William showed no intention to annul the marriage.

In July 1177, William sent a delegation of Archbishop Romuald II of Salerno and Count Roger of Andria to sign the Treaty of Venice with the Emperor. In 1184, he released 30-year-old Constance from convent, engaged her to the Emperor&#x27;s son, the future Emperor Henry VI to secure the peace, and married her off on January 1186, causing a general oath to be taken to her as his heir presumptive. This step, of great consequence to the Norman realm, was possibly taken that William might devote himself to foreign conquests, or aiming to prevent Tancred, Count of Lecce, an illegitimate cousin of William, to claim the throne.

===Wars with Egypt and Byzantine Empire===

Unable to revive the African dominion, William directed his attack on Ayyubid Egypt, from which Saladin threatened the Latin kingdom of Jerusalem. In July 1174, 30,000 men were landed before Alexandria, but Saladin&#x27;s arrival forced the Sicilians to re-embark in disorder. A better prospect opened in the confusion in Byzantine affairs which followed the death of Manuel Comnenus (1180), and William took up the old design and feud against the Byzantine Empire. Dyrrhachium was captured (11 June 1185). Afterwards while the army (allegedly 80,000 men including 5,000 knights) marched upon Thessalonica, the fleet (200 ships) sailed towards the same target capturing on their way the Ionian islands of Corfu, Cephalonia, Ithaca and Zakynthos. In August 1185, Thessalonica fell to the joint attack of the Sicilian fleet and army and was subsequently sacked.

The troops then marched upon the capital, but the army of the emperor Isaac Angelus, under the general Alexios Branas, defeated the invaders on the banks of the Strymon (7 November 1185). Thessalonica was at once abandoned and in 1189 William made peace with Isaac, abandoning all the conquests. He was now planning to induce the crusading armies of the West to pass through his territories, and seemed about to play a leading part in the Third Crusade. His admiral Margarito, a naval genius equal to George of Antioch, with 60 vessels kept the eastern Mediterranean open for the Franks, and forced the strong Saladin to retire from before Tripoli in the spring of 1188.

==Death==
In November 1189 William died at Palermo, leaving no children, although Robert of Torigni records a short-lived son in 1181: Bohemond, who was named Duke of Apulia.

After his death Norman officials led by Matthew of Ajello supported his cousin Tancred to succeed him, instead of Constance, in order to avoid German rule.
