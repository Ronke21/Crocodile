<text>Harvard Law School (HLS) is the law school of Harvard University, a private research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Founded in 1817, Harvard Law School is the oldest law school in continuous operation in the United States.

Each class in the three-year JD program has approximately 560 students, which is among the largest of the top 150 ranked law schools in the United States. The first-year class is broken into seven sections of approximately 80 students, who take most first-year classes together. Aside from the JD program, Harvard also awards both LLM and SJD degrees.

HLS is home to the world&#x27;s largest academic law library. The school has an estimated 115 full-time faculty members. According to Harvard Law&#x27;s 2020 ABA-required disclosures, 99% of 2019 graduates passed the bar exam. The school&#x27;s graduates accounted for more than one-quarter of all Supreme Court clerks between 2000 and 2010, more than any other law school in the United States.

==History ==
===Founding===
Harvard Law School&#x27;s founding is traced to the establishment of a &#x27;law department&#x27; at Harvard in 1819. Dating the founding to the year of the creation of the law department makes Harvard Law School the oldest continuously operating law school in the United States. William &amp; Mary Law School opened first in 1779, but it closed due to the American Civil War, reopening in 1920. The University of Maryland School of Law was chartered in 1816 but did not begin classes until 1824, and it also closed during the Civil War.
The founding of the law department came two years after the establishment of Harvard&#x27;s first endowed professorship in law, funded by a bequest from the estate of wealthy slave-owner Isaac Royall Jr., in 1817. Royall left roughly 1,000 acres of land in Massachusetts to Harvard when he died in exile in Nova Scotia, where he fled to as a Loyalist during the American Revolution, in 1781, &quot;to be appropriated towards the endowing a Professor of Laws ... or a Professor of Physick and Anatomy, whichever the said overseers and Corporation [of the college] shall judge to be best.&quot; The value of the land, when fully liquidated in 1809, was $2,938; the Harvard Corporation allocated $400 from the income generated by those funds to create the Royall Professorship of Law in 1815. The Royalls were so involved in the slave trade, that &quot;the labor of slaves underwrote the teaching of law in Cambridge.&quot; The dean of the law school traditionally held the Royall chair; deans Elena Kagan and Martha Minow declined the Royall chair due to its origins in the proceeds of slavery.

The Royall family&#x27;s coat of arms, which shows three stacked wheat sheaves on a blue background, was adopted as part of the law school&#x27;s arms in 1936, topped with the university&#x27;s motto (&quot;Veritas&quot;, Latin for &#x27;truth&#x27;). Until the school began investigating its connections with slavery in the 2010s, most alumni and faculty at the time were unaware of the origins of the arms. In March 2016, following requests by students, the school decided to remove the emblem because of its association with slavery. In November 2019, Harvard announced that a working group had been tasked to develop a new emblem. In August 2021, the new Harvard Law School emblem was introduced.

Royall&#x27;s Medford estate, the Isaac Royall House, is now a museum which features the only remaining slave quarters in the northeast United States. In 2019, the government of Antigua and Barbuda requested reparations from Harvard Law School on the grounds that it benefitted from Royall&#x27;s enslavement of people in the country.

===Growth===
By 1827, the school, with one faculty member, was struggling. Nathan Dane, a prominent alumnus of the college, then endowed the Dane Professorship of Law, insisting that it be given to then Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story. For a while, the school was called &quot;Dane Law School.&quot; In 1829, John H. Ashmun, son of Eli Porter Ashmun and brother of George Ashmun, accepted a professorship and closed his Northampton Law School, with many of his students following him to Harvard. Story&#x27;s belief in the need for an elite law school based on merit and dedicated to public service helped build the school&#x27;s reputation at the time, although the contours of these beliefs have not been consistent throughout its history. Enrollment remained low through the 19th century as university legal education was considered to be of little added benefit to apprenticeships in legal practice. After first trying lowered admissions standards, in 1848 HLS eliminated admissions requirements. In 1869, HLS also eliminated examination requirements.

In the 1870s, under Dean Christopher Columbus Langdell, HLS introduced what has become the standard first-year curriculum for American law schools – including classes in contracts, property, torts, criminal law, and civil procedure. At Harvard, Langdell also developed the case method of teaching law, now the dominant pedagogical model at U.S. law schools. Langdell&#x27;s notion that law could be studied as a &quot;science&quot; gave university legal education a reason for being distinct from vocational preparation. Critics at first defended the old lecture method because it was faster and cheaper and made fewer demands on faculty and students. Advocates said the case method had a sounder theoretical basis in scientific research and the inductive method. Langdell&#x27;s graduates became leading professors at other law schools where they introduced the case method. The method was facilitated by casebooks. From its founding in 1900, the Association of American Law Schools promoted the case method in law schools that sought accreditation.

===20th century===

During the 20th century, Harvard Law School was known for its competitiveness. For example, Bob Berring called it &quot;a samurai ring where you can test your swordsmanship against the swordsmanship of the strongest intellectual warriors from around the nation.&quot; When Langdell developed the original law school curriculum, Harvard President Charles Eliot told him to make it &quot;hard and long.&quot; An urban legend holds that incoming students are told to &quot;Look to your left, look to your right, because one of you won&#x27;t be here by the end of the year.&quot; Scott Turow&#x27;s memoir &quot;One L&quot; and John Jay Osborn&#x27;s novel &quot;The Paper Chase&quot; describe such an environment. Trailing many of its peers, Harvard Law did not admit women as students until 1950, for the class of 1953.

Eleanor Kerlow&#x27;s book &quot;Poisoned Ivy: How Egos, Ideology, and Power Politics Almost Ruined Harvard Law School&quot; criticized the school for a 1980s political dispute between newer and older faculty members over accusations of insensitivity to minority and feminist issues. Divisiveness over such issues as political correctness lent the school the title &quot;Beirut on the Charles.&quot;

In &quot;Broken Contract: A Memoir of Harvard Law School&quot;, Richard Kahlenberg criticized the school for driving students away from public interest and toward work in high-paying law firms. Kahlenberg&#x27;s criticisms are supported by Granfield and Koenig&#x27;s study, which found that &quot;students [are directed] toward service in the most prestigious law firms, both because they learn that such positions are their destiny and because the recruitment network that results from collective eminence makes these jobs extremely easy to obtain.&quot; The school has also been criticized for its large first year class sizes (at one point there were 140 students per classroom; in 2001 there were 80), a cold and aloof administration, and an inaccessible faculty. The latter stereotype is a central plot element of &quot;The Paper Chase&quot; and appears in &quot;Legally Blonde&quot;.

In response to the above criticisms, HLS eventually implemented the once-criticized but now dominant approach pioneered by Dean Robert Hutchins at Yale Law School, of shifting the competitiveness to the admissions process while making law school itself a more cooperative experience. Robert Granfield and Thomas Koenig&#x27;s 1992 study of Harvard Law students that appeared in &quot;The Sociological Quarterly&quot; found that students &quot;learn to cooperate with rather than compete against classmates,&quot; and that contrary to &quot;less eminent&quot; law schools, students &quot;learn that professional success is available for all who attend, and that therefore, only neurotic &#x27;gunners&#x27; try to outdo peers.&quot;

===21st century===

Under Kagan, the second half of the 2000s saw significant academic changes since the implementation of the Langdell curriculum. In 2006, the faculty voted unanimously to approve a new first-year curriculum, placing greater emphasis on problem-solving, administrative law, and international law. The new curriculum was implemented in stages over the next several years, with the last new course, a first-year practice-oriented problem-solving workshop, being instituted in January 2010. In late 2008, the faculty decided that the school should move to an Honors/Pass/Low Pass/Fail (H/P/LP/F) grading system, much like those in place at Yale and at Stanford Law School. The system applied to half the courses taken by students in the Class of 2010 and fully started with the Class of 2011.

In 2009, Kagan was appointed solicitor general of the United States by President Barack Obama and resigned the deanship. On June 11, 2009, Harvard University president, Drew Gilpin Faust named Martha Minow as the new dean. She assumed the position on July 1, 2009. On January 3, 2017, Minow announced that she would conclude her tenure as dean at the end of the academic year. In June 2017, John F. Manning was named as the new dean, effective as of July 1, 2017.

In September 2017, the school unveiled a plaque acknowledging the indirect role played by slavery in its history:

=== Coat of arms ===

The governing body of the university voted to retire the law school&#x27;s coat of arms. The school&#x27;s shield incorporated the three garbs of wheat from the armorial bearings of Isaac Royall Jr., a university benefactor who had endowed the first professorship in the law school. The shield had become a source of contention among a group of law school students, who objected to the Royall family&#x27;s history of slave ownership.

The president of the university and dean of the law school, acting upon the recommendation of a committee formed to study the issue, ultimately agreed with its majority decision, that the shield was inconsistent with the values of both the university and the law school. Their recommendation was ultimately adopted by the Harvard Corporation and on March 15, 2016, the shield was ordered retired.

On August 23, 2021, it was announced that a new emblem was approved by the Harvard Corporation. The new design features Harvard&#x27;s traditional motto, (Latin for &#x27;truth&#x27;), resting above the Latin phrase &quot;Lex et Iustitia&quot;, meaning &#x27;law and justice&#x27;. According to the HLS Shield Working Group&#x27;s final report, the expanding or diverging lines, some with no obvious beginning or end, are meant to convey a sense of broad scope or great distance — the limitlessness of the school&#x27;s work and mission. The radial lines also allude to the latitudinal and longitudinal lines that define the arc of the earth, conveying the global reach of the Law School&#x27;s community and impact. The multifaceted, radiating form — a form inspired by architectural details found in both Austin Hall and Hauser Hall — seeks to convey dynamism, complexity, inclusiveness, connectivity, and strength.

=== Rankings ===
HLS was ranked as the fifth best law school in the United States by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in its 2023 rankings. HLS was ranked first in the world by QS World University Rankings in 2023. It is ranked first in the world by the 2019 Academic Ranking of World Universities.

In November 2022, the law school made a joint decision along with Yale Law School to withdraw from the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; Best Law Schools rankings, citing the system&#x27;s &quot;flawed methodology.&quot;

== Student life ==

=== Student organizations ===
Harvard Law School has more than 90 student organizations that are active on campus. These organizations include the student-edited journals, &quot;Harvard Law Record&quot;, and the HLS Drama Society, which organizes the annual &quot;Harvard Law School Parody&quot;, the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau as well as other political, social, service, and athletic groups.

HLS Student Government is the primary governing, advocacy, and representative body for Law School students. In addition, students are represented at the university level by the Harvard Graduate Council.

==== &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; ====

Students of the Juris Doctor (JD) program are involved in preparing and publishing the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot;, one of the most highly cited university law reviews, as well as several other law journals and an independent student newspaper. The &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; was first published in 1887 and has been staffed and edited by some of the school&#x27;s most notable alumni.

In addition to the journal, the Harvard Law Review Association, in conjunction with the Columbia Law Review, University of Pennsylvania Law Review, and &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot; also publishes &quot;The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation&quot;, the most widely followed authority for legal citation formats in the United States.

The student newspaper, the &quot;Harvard Law Record&quot;, has been published continuously since the 1940s, making it one of the oldest law school newspapers in the country, and has included the exploits of fictional law student Fenno for decades. The Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance and Financial Regulation, formerly known as the &quot;Harvard Law School Corporate Governance Blog&quot;, is one of the most widely read law websites in the country. &quot;Harvard Human Rights Reflections,&quot; which is hosted by the Human Rights Program&quot;,&quot; is a widely read discussion platform for critical engagement with the human rights project. It features legal arguments, advocacy pieces, applied research, practitioner&#x27;s notes and other forms of reflections related to human rights law, theory, and practice.

The &quot;Harvard Law Bulletin&quot; is the magazine of record for Harvard Law School. The &quot;Harvard Law Bulletin&quot; was first published in April 1948. The magazine is currently published twice a year, but in previous years has been published four or six times a year. The magazine was first published online in fall 1997.

<doc id="158986" wikidata="Q2440952" url="?curid=158986" title="Culture of Australia">
<text>Australian culture is of primarily Western origins, and is derived from its British, Indigenous and migrant components.

Indigenous peoples arrived as early as 60,000 years ago, and evidence of Aboriginal art in Australia dates back at least 30,000 years. The British colonisation of Australia began in 1788 and waves of multi-ethnic (primarily Anglo-Celtic) migration followed shortly thereafter. Several states and territories had their origins as penal colonies, with this convict heritage having an enduring effect on Australian music, cinema and literature.

Manifestations of British colonial heritage in Australia include the primacy of the English language and Western Christianity, the institution of constitutional monarchy, a Westminster-style system of democratic parliamentary government, and Australia&#x27;s inclusion within the Commonwealth of Nations. The American political ideals of constitutionalism and federalism have also played a role in shaping Australia&#x27;s distinctive political identity.

The Australian gold rushes from the 1850s resulted in exponential population and economic growth, as well as racial tensions and the introduction of novel political ideas; the growing disparity between the prospectors and the established colonial governments culminated in the Eureka Stockade rebellion and the shifting political climate ushered in significant electoral reform, the labour movement, and women&#x27;s rights ahead of any such changes in other Western countries.

Federation occurred in 1901 as the result of a burgeoning sense of national unity and identity that had developed over the latter half of the 19th century, hitherto demonstrated in the works of Heidelberg School artists and authors like Banjo Paterson, Henry Lawson, and Dorothea Mackellar. World War I and World War II profoundly impacted Australia, ushering in the heroic ANZAC legend of the former and the geopolitical reorientation in which the United States became Australia&#x27;s foremost military ally after the latter. After the Second World War, 6.5 million people settled in Australia from 200 nations, further enriching Australian culture in the process. Over time, as immigrant populations gradually assimilated into Australian life, their cultural and culinary practices became part of mainstream Australian culture.

==Historical development of Australian culture==
The oldest surviving cultural traditions of Australia—and some of the oldest surviving cultural traditions on earth—are those of Australia&#x27;s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, collectively referred to as Indigenous Australians. Their ancestors have inhabited Australia for between 40,000 and 60,000 years, living a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. In 2006, the Indigenous population was estimated at 517,000 people, or 2.5 per cent of the total population. Most Aboriginal Australians have a belief system based on the Dreaming, or Dreamtime, which refers both to a time when ancestral spirits created land and culture, and to the knowledge and practices that define individual and community responsibilities and identity. 

The arrival of the first British settlers at what is now Sydney in 1788 introduced Western civilisation to the Australian continent. Although Sydney was initially used by the British as a place of banishment for prisoners, the arrival of the British laid the foundations for Australia&#x27;s democratic institutions and rule of law, and introduced the long traditions of English literature, Western art and music, and Judeo-Christian ethics and religious outlook which shaped the Australian national culture and identity.
The British Empire expanded across the whole continent and established six colonies. The colonies were originally penal colonies, with the exception of Western Australia and South Australia, which were each established as a &quot;free colony&quot; with no convicts and a vision for a territory with political and religious freedoms, together with opportunities for wealth through business and pastoral investments. However, Western Australia became a penal colony after insufficient numbers of free settlers arrived. Adelaide, the capital of South Australia, grew from its status as a convict free region and experienced prosperity from the late nineteenth century.

Contact between the Indigenous Australians and the new settlers ranged from cordiality to violent conflict, but the diseases brought by Europeans were devastating to Aboriginal populations and culture. According to the historian Geoffrey Blainey, during the colonial period: &quot;Smallpox, measles, influenza and other new diseases swept from one Aboriginal camp to another ... The main conqueror of Aborigines was to be disease and its ally, demoralization.&quot;

Calls for responsible government began to develop; William Wentworth established Australia&#x27;s first political party in 1835 to demand democratic government for New South Wales and later was central in the establishment of Australia&#x27;s first parliament. From the 1850s, the colonies set about writing constitutions which produced democratically advanced parliaments as constitutional monarchies with Queen Victoria as the head of state.Women&#x27;s suffrage in Australia was achieved from the 1890s. Women became eligible to vote in South Australia in 1895. This was the first legislation in the world permitting women to stand for political office and, in 1897, Catherine Helen Spence, an Adelaidean, became the first female political candidate. Though constantly evolving, the key foundations for elected parliamentary government have maintained an historical continuity in Australia from the 1850s into the 21st century.

During the colonial era, distinctive forms of Australian art, music, language and literature developed through movements like the Heidelberg school of painters and the work of bush balladeers like Henry Lawson and Banjo Paterson, whose poetry and prose did much to promote an egalitarian Australian outlook which placed a high value on the concept of &quot;mateship&quot;. Games like cricket and rugby were imported from Britain at this time and with a local variant of football, Australian Rules Football, became treasured cultural traditions.

The Commonwealth of Australia was founded in 1901, after a series of referendums conducted in the British colonies of Australasia. The Australian Constitution established a federal democracy and enshrined human rights such as sections 41 (right to vote), 80 (right to trial by jury) and 116 (freedom of religion) as foundational principles of Australian law and included economic rights such as restricting the government to acquiring property only &quot;on just terms&quot;. The Australian Labor Party was established in the 1890s and the Liberal Party of Australia in 1944, both rising to be the dominant political parties and rivals of Australian politics, though various other parties have been and remain influential. Voting is compulsory in Australia and government is essentially formed by a group commanding a majority of seats in the Australian House of Representatives selecting a leader who becomes Prime Minister. Australia remains a constitutional monarchy in which the largely ceremonial and procedural duties of the monarch are performed by a Governor General selected by the Australian government.

Australia fought at Britain&#x27;s side from the outset of World War I and World War II and came under attack from the Empire of Japan during the latter conflict. These wars profoundly affected Australia&#x27;s sense of nationhood and a proud military legend developed around the spirit of Australia&#x27;s ANZAC troops, who came to symbolise the virtues of endurance, courage, ingenuity, good humour, and mateship.

The Australian colonies had a period of extensive non-British European and Chinese immigration during the Australian gold rushes of the latter half of the 19th century, but following Federation in 1901, the Parliament instigated the White Australia Policy that gave preference to British migrants and ensured that Australia remained a predominantly Anglo-Celtic society until well into the 20th century. The post-World War II immigration program saw the policy relaxed then dismantled by successive governments, permitting large numbers of non-British Europeans, and later Asian and Middle Eastern migrants to arrive. The Menzies Government (1949-1966) and Holt government maintained the White Australia Policy but relaxed it, and then the legal barriers to multiracial immigration were dismantled during the 1970s, with the promotion of multiculturalism by the Whitlam and Fraser governments.

From the protest movements from the 1930s, with the gradual lifting of restrictions, Indigenous Australians began to develop a unity sense of Aboriginality, maintained by all Aboriginal artists, musicians, sportsmen and writers. However, some States and Territories of Australia retained discriminatory laws relating to voting rights for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people into the 1960s, at which point full legal equality was established. A 1967 referendum to include all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the national electoral roll census was overwhelmingly approved by voters, signal the beginning of action and organisation at a national level in Aboriginal affairs. Since then, conflict and reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians has been a source of much art and literature in Australia. In 1984, a group of Pintupi people who were living a traditional hunter-gatherer desert-dwelling life were tracked down in the Gibson Desert and brought into a settlement. They are believed to have been the last uncontacted tribe.

While the British cultural influence remained strong into the 21st century, other influences became increasingly important. Australia&#x27;s post-war period was marked by an influx of Europeans who broadened the nation&#x27;s vision. The Hawaiian sport of surfing was adopted in Australia where a beach culture and the locally developed surf lifesaving movement was already burgeoning in the early 20th century. American pop culture and cinema were embraced in the 20th century, with country music and later rock and roll sweeping Australia, aided by the new technology of television and a host of American content. The 1956 Melbourne Olympics, the first to be broadcast to the world, announced a confident, prosperous post-war nation, and new cultural icons like Australian country music star Slim Dusty and dadaist Barry Humphries expressed a uniquely Australian identity.

Australia&#x27;s contemporary immigration program has two components: a program for skilled and family migrants and a humanitarian program for refugees and asylum seekers. By 2010, the post-war immigration program had received more than 6.5 million migrants from every continent. The population tripled in the six decades to around 21 million in 2010, including people originating from 200 countries. More than 43 per cent of Australians were either born overseas or have one parent who was born overseas. The population is highly urbanised, with more than 75% of Australians living in urban centres, largely along the coast though there has been increased incentive to decentralise the population, concentrating it into developed regional or rural areas.

Contemporary Australia is a pluralistic society, rooted in liberal democratic traditions and espousing informality and egalitarianism as key societal values. While strongly influenced by Anglo-Celtic origins, the culture of Australia has also been shaped by multi-ethnic migration which has influenced all aspects of Australian life, including business, the arts, cuisine, sense of humour and sporting tastes.

Contemporary Australia is also a culture that is profoundly influenced by global movements of meaning and communication, including advertising culture. In turn, globalising corporations from Holden to Exxon have attempted to associate their brand with Australian cultural identity. This process intensified from the 1970s onwards. According to Paul James,

==Symbols==
When the Australian colonies federated on 1 January 1901, an official competition for a design for an Australian flag was held. The design that was adopted contains the Union Jack in the left corner, symbolising Australia&#x27;s historical links to the United Kingdom, the stars of the Southern Cross on the right half of the flag indicating Australia&#x27;s geographical location, and the seven-pointed Federation Star in the bottom left representing the six states and the territories of Australia. Other official flags include the Australian Aboriginal flag, the Torres Strait Islander flag and the flags of the individual states and territories.

The Australian Coat of Arms was granted by King George V in 1912 and consists of a shield containing the badges of the six states, within an ermine border. The crest above the shield and helmet is a seven-pointed gold star on a blue and gold wreath, representing the 6 states and the territories. The shield is supported by a red kangaroo and an emu, which were chosen to symbolise a nation moving forward.

Green and gold were confirmed as Australia&#x27;s national colours in 1984, though the colours had been adopted on the uniforms of Australia’s sporting teams long before this. The Golden Wattle (&quot;Acacia pycnantha&quot;) was officially proclaimed as the national floral emblem in 1988.

Reflecting the country&#x27;s status as a constitutional monarchy, the Crown remains part of Australian public life, maintaining a visual presence through federal and state coats of arms, charitable and cultural patronage, the names and symbols of public institutions and the governor-general and state governors, who are the monarch&#x27;s representatives on Australian soil. Some Australian banknotes and all coins bear an image of the monarch. At least 14,9% of lands in Australia are referred to as Crown land, considered public land. There are many geographic places that have been named in honour of a reigning monarch, including the states of Queensland and Victoria, named after Queen Victoria, with numerous rivers, streets, squares, parks and buildings carrying the names of past or present members of the royal family.

==Language==

Although Australia has no official language, it is largely monolingual with English being the de facto national language. Australian English is a major variety of the language that is immediately distinguishable from British, American, and other national dialects by virtue of its unique accents, pronunciations, idioms and vocabulary, although its spelling more closely reflects British versions rather than American. According to the 2011 census, English is the only language spoken in the home for around 80% of the population. The next most common languages spoken at home are Mandarin (1.7%), Italian (1.5%), and Arabic (1.4%); almost all migrants speak some English. Australia has multiple sign languages, the most spoken known as Auslan, which in 2004 was the main language of about 6,500 deaf people, and Australian Irish Sign Language with about 100 speakers.

It is believed that there were between 200 and 300 Australian Aboriginal languages at the time of first European contact, but only about 70 of these have survived and all but 20 are now endangered. An Indigenous language is the main language for 0.25% of the population.

==Humour==
Comedy is an important part of the Australian identity. The &quot;Australian sense of humour&quot; is characterised as dry and sarcastic, exemplified by the works of performing artists like Barry Humphries and Paul Hogan.

The convicts of the early colonial period helped establish anti-authoritarianism as a hallmark of Australian comedy. Influential in the establishment of stoic, dry wit as a characteristic of Australian humour were the bush balladeers of the 19th century, including Henry Lawson, author of &quot;The Loaded Dog&quot;. His contemporary, Banjo Paterson, contributed a number of classic comic poems including &quot;The Man from Ironbark&quot; and &quot;The Geebung Polo Club&quot;. CJ Dennis wrote humour in the Australian vernacular – notably in &quot;The Songs of a Sentimental Bloke&quot;. The &quot;Dad and Dave&quot; series about a farming family was an enduring hit of the early 20th century. The World War I ANZAC troops were said to often display irreverence in their relations with superior officers and dark humour in the face of battle.

Australian comedy has a strong tradition of self-mockery, from the outlandish Barry McKenzie &quot;expat-in-Europe&quot; ocker comedies of the 1970s, to the quirky outback characters of the &quot;&quot;Crocodile&quot; Dundee&quot; films of the 1980s, the suburban parody of Working Dog Productions&#x27; 1997 film &quot;The Castle&quot; and the dysfunctional suburban mother–daughter sitcom &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot;. In the 1970s, satirical talk-show host Norman Gunston (played by Garry McDonald), with his malapropisms, sweep-over hair and poorly shaven face, rose to great popularity by pioneering the satirical &quot;ambush&quot; interview technique and giving unique interpretations of pop songs. Roy and HG provide an affectionate but irreverent parody of Australia&#x27;s obsession with sport.

The unique character and humour of Australian culture was defined in cartoons by immigrants, Emile Mercier and George Molnar, and in the novel &quot;They&#x27;re a Weird Mob&quot; (1957) by John O&#x27;Grady, which looks at Sydney through the eyes of an Italian immigrant. Post-war immigration has seen migrant humour flourish through the works of Vietnamese refugee Anh Do, Egyptian-Australian stand-up comic Akmal Saleh and Greek-Australian actor Nick Giannopoulos.

Since the 1950s, the satirical character creations of Barry Humphries have included housewife &quot;gigastar&quot; Edna Everage and &quot;Australian cultural attaché&quot; Les Patterson, whose interests include boozing, chasing women and flatulence. For his delivery of dadaist and absurdist humour to millions, biographer Anne Pender described Humphries in 2010 as &quot;the most significant comedian to emerge since Charlie Chaplin&quot;.

The vaudeville talents of Daryl Somers, Graham Kennedy, Don Lane and Bert Newton earned popular success during the early years of Australian television. The variety show &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot; screened for three decades. Among the best loved Australian sitcoms was &quot;Mother and Son&quot;, about a divorcee who had moved back into the suburban home of his mother – but sketch comedy has been the stalwart of Australian television. &quot;The Comedy Company&quot;, in the 1980s, featured the comic talents of Mary-Anne Fahey, Ian McFadyen, Mark Mitchell, Glenn Robbins, Kym Gyngell and others. Growing out of Melbourne University and &quot;The D-Generation&quot; came &quot;The Late Show&quot; (1991–1993), starring the influential talents Santo Cilauro, Tom Gleisner, Jane Kennedy, Tony Martin, Mick Molloy and Rob Sitch (who later formed Working Dog Productions); and during the 1980s and 1990s &quot;Fast Forward&quot; (Steve Vizard, Magda Szubanski, Marg Downey, Michael Veitch, Peter Moon and others) and its successor &quot;Full Frontal&quot;, which launched the career of Eric Bana and featured Shaun Micallef.

The perceptive wit of Clive James and Andrew Denton has been popular in the talk-show interview style. Representatives of the &quot;bawdy&quot; strain of Australian comedy include Rodney Rude, Austen Tayshus and Chad Morgan. Rolf Harris helped defined a comic tradition in Australian music.

Cynical satire has had enduring popularity, with television series such as &quot;Frontline&quot;, targeting the inner workings of &quot;news and current affairs&quot; TV journalism, &quot;The Hollowmen&quot; (2008), set in the office of the Prime Minister&#x27;s political advisory (spin) department, and &quot;The Chaser&#x27;s War on Everything&quot;, which cynically examines domestic and international politics. Actor/writer Chris Lilley has produced a series of award-winning &quot;mockumentary&quot; style television series about Australian characters since 2005.

The annual Melbourne International Comedy Festival is one of the largest comedy festivals in the world, and a popular fixture on the city&#x27;s cultural calendar.

==Arts==
The arts in Australia—film, music, painting, theatre, dance and crafts—have achieved international recognition. While much of Australia&#x27;s cultural output has traditionally tended to fit with general trends and styles in Western arts, the arts as practised by Indigenous Australians represent a unique Australian cultural tradition, and Australia&#x27;s landscape and history have contributed to some unique variations in the styles inherited by Australia&#x27;s various migrant communities.

===Literature===
As the convict era passed—captured most famously in Marcus Clarke&#x27;s &quot;For the Term of His Natural Life&quot; (1874), a seminal work of Tasmanian Gothic—the bush and Australian daily life assumed primacy as subjects. Charles Harpur, Henry Kendall and Adam Lindsay Gordon won fame in the mid-19th century for their lyric nature poems and patriotic verse. Gordon drew on Australian colloquy and idiom; Clarke assessed his work as &quot;the beginnings of a national school of Australian poetry&quot;. First published in serial form in 1882, Rolf Boldrewood&#x27;s &quot;Robbery Under Arms&quot; is regarded as the classic bushranging novel for its vivid use of the bush vernacular and realistic detail of situations in the Australian bush.
Founded in 1880, &quot;The Bulletin&quot; did much to create the idea of an Australian national character—one of anti-authoritarianism, egalitarianism, mateship and a concern for the &quot;battler&quot;—forged against the brutalities of the bush. This image was expressed within the works of its bush poets, the most famous of which are Henry Lawson, widely regarded as Australia&#x27;s finest short-story writer, and Banjo Paterson, author of classics such as &quot;Clancy of the Overflow&quot; (1889) and &quot;The Man From Snowy River&quot; (1890). In a literary debate about the nature of life in the bush, Lawson said Paterson was a romantic while Paterson attacked Lawson&#x27;s pessimistic outlook. C. J. Dennis wrote humour in the Australian vernacular, notably in the verse novel &quot;The Songs of a Sentimental Bloke&quot; (1915), while Dorothy Mackellar wrote the iconic patriotic poem &quot;My Country&quot; (1908) which rejected prevailing fondness for England&#x27;s &quot;green and shaded lanes&quot; and declared: &quot;I love a sunburned country&quot;. Early Australian children&#x27;s literature was also embedded in the bush tradition; perennial favourites include Norman Lindsay&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Pudding&quot; (1918), May Gibbs&#x27; &quot;Snugglepot and Cuddlepie&quot; (1918) and Dorothy Wall&#x27;s &quot;Blinky Bill&quot; (1933).

Significant poets of the early 20th century include Kenneth Slessor, Mary Gilmore and Judith Wright. The nationalist Jindyworobak Movement arose in the 1930s and sought to develop a distinctive Australian poetry through the appropriation of Aboriginal languages and ideas. In contrast, the Angry Penguins, centred around Max Harris&#x27; journal of the same name, promoted international modernism. A backlash resulted in the Ern Malley affair of 1943, Australia&#x27;s most famous literary hoax.
The legacy of Miles Franklin, renowned for her 1901 novel &quot;My Brilliant Career&quot;, is the Miles Franklin Award, which is &quot;presented each year to a novel which is of the highest literary merit and presents Australian life in any of its phases&quot;. Patrick White won the inaugural award for &quot;Voss&quot; in 1957; he went on to win the 1973 Nobel Prize in Literature. Peter Carey, Thomas Keneally and Richard Flanagan are recipients of the Booker Prize. Other acclaimed Australian authors include Colleen McCullough, Nevil Shute, Tim Winton, Ruth Park and Morris West. Helen Garner&#x27;s 1977 novel &quot;Monkey Grip&quot; is widely considered one of Australia&#x27;s first contemporary novels–she has since written both fiction and non-fiction work. Notable expatriate authors include the feminist Germaine Greer and humourist Clive James. Greer&#x27;s controversial 1970 nonfiction book &quot;The Female Eunuch&quot; became a global bestseller and is considered a watershed feminist text. Among the best known contemporary poets are Les Murray and Bruce Dawe.

David Unaipon is known as the first Indigenous Australian author. Oodgeroo Noonuccal was the first Aboriginal Australian to publish a book of verse. A significant contemporary account of the experiences of Indigenous Australia can be found in Sally Morgan&#x27;s &quot;My Place&quot;. Contemporary academics and activists including Marcia Langton and Noel Pearson are prominent essayists and authors on Aboriginal issues.

Charles Bean (&quot;The Story of Anzac: From the Outbreak of War to the End of the First Phase of the Gallipoli Campaign 4 May 191&quot;5, 1921) Geoffrey Blainey (&quot;The Tyranny of Distance&quot;, 1966), Robert Hughes (&quot;The Fatal Shore&quot;, 1987), Manning Clark &quot;(A History of Australia&quot;, 1962–87), and Marcia Langton (&quot;First Australians&quot;, 2008) are authors of important Australian histories.

===Theatre===

European traditions came to Australia with the First Fleet in 1788, with the first production being performed in 1789 by convicts. In 1988, the year of Australia&#x27;s bicentenary, the circumstances of the foundations of Australian theatre were recounted in Timberlake Wertenbaker&#x27;s play &quot;Our Country&#x27;s Good&quot;.
Hobart&#x27;s Theatre Royal opened in 1837 and is Australia&#x27;s oldest continuously operating theatre. Inaugurated in 1839, the Melbourne Athenaeum is one of Melbourne&#x27;s oldest cultural institutions, and Adelaide&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Theatre, established in 1841, is today the oldest purpose-built theatre on the mainland. The mid-19th-century gold rushes provided funds for the construction of grand theatres in the Victorian style, such as the Princess Theatre in Melbourne, established in 1854.

After Federation in 1901, theatre productions evidenced the new sense of national identity. &quot;On Our Selection&quot; (1912), based on the stories of Steele Rudd, portrays a pioneer farming family and became immensely popular. Sydney&#x27;s grand Capitol Theatre opened in 1928 and after restoration remains one of the nation&#x27;s finest auditoriums.

In 1955, &quot;Summer of the Seventeenth Doll&quot; by Ray Lawler portrayed resolutely Australian characters and went on to international acclaim. That same year, young Melbourne artist Barry Humphries performed as Edna Everage for the first time at Melbourne University&#x27;s Union Theatre. His satirical stage creations, notably Dame Edna and Les Patterson, became Australian cultural icons. Humphries also achieved success in the US with tours on Broadway and has been honored in Australia and Britain.

Founded in Sydney 1958, the National Institute of Dramatic Art boasts famous alumni including Cate Blanchett, Mel Gibson and Hugo Weaving. Construction of the Adelaide Festival Center began in 1970 and South Australia&#x27;s Sir Robert Helpmann became director of the Adelaide Festival of Arts. The new wave of Australian theatre debuted in the 1970s as “a new and more realistic look into [Australia’s] beginnings as a nation”. It explored the confrontation in social relations, the use of vernacular language and expressions of masculine social habits in contemporary Australia. The Belvoir St Theatre presented works by Nick Enright and David Williamson. The Sydney Opera House, inaugurated in 1973, is the home of Opera Australia and the Sydney Theatre Company.

The Bell Shakespeare Company was created in 1990. A period of success for Australian musical theatre came in the 1990s with the debut of musical biographies of Australian music singers Peter Allen (&quot;The Boy From Oz&quot; in 1998) and Johnny O&#x27;Keefe (&quot;Shout! The Legend of The Wild One&quot;).

In &quot;The One Day of the Year&quot;, Alan Seymour studied the paradoxical nature of the ANZAC Day commemoration by Australians of the defeat of the Battle of Gallipoli. &quot;Ngapartji Ngapartji&quot;, by Scott Rankin and Trevor Jamieson, recounts the story of the effects on the Pitjantjatjara people of nuclear testing in the Western Desert during the Cold War. It is an example of the contemporary fusion of traditions of drama in Australia with Pitjantjatjara actors being supported by a multicultural cast of Greek, Afghan, Japanese and New Zealand heritage.

===Architecture===


Australia has three architectural listings on UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage list: Australian Convict Sites (comprising a collection of 11 separate sites around Australia, including Hyde Park Barracks in Sydney, Port Arthur in Tasmania, and Fremantle Prison in Western Australia); the Sydney Opera House; and the Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne. Examples of contemporary Australian architecture includes the Shine Dome in Canberra, considered &quot;the only true example in Australia of geometric structuralism&quot;; the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the bridge with the second longest span when completed; and the Sidney Myer Music Bowl, Melbourne’s first major purpose-built. Significant architects who have worked in Australia include Governor Lachlan Macquarie&#x27;s colonial architect, Francis Greenway; the ecclesiastical neo-Gothic architect William Wardell; the designer of Canberra&#x27;s layout, Walter Burley Griffin; the modernist Harry Seidler; and Jørn Utzon, designer of the Sydney Opera House. The National Trust of Australia is a non-governmental organisation charged with protecting Australia&#x27;s built heritage.

Evidence of permanent structures built by Indigenous Australians before European settlement of Australia in 1788 is limited. Much of what they built was temporary, and was used for housing and other needs. As a British colony, the first European buildings were derivative of the European fashions of the time. Tents and wattle and daub huts preceded more substantial structures. Georgian architecture is seen in early government buildings of Sydney and Tasmania and the homes of the wealthy. While the major Australian cities enjoyed the boom of the Victorian era, the Australian gold rushes of the mid-19th century brought major construction works and exuberant Victorian architecture to the major cities, particularly Melbourne, and regional cities such as Ballarat and Bendigo. Other significant architectural movements in Australian architecture include the Federation style at the turn of the 20th century, and the modern styles of the late 20th century which also saw many older buildings demolished. The Victorian and Federation eras saw the development of the Filigree style, style of vernacular architecture developed by early European migrants as a response to the new subtropical climate. The style favoured the usage of ornamental verandahs, both for decorative and climatic cooling purposes. The Queenslander developed in Queensland and the northern parts of New South Wales as a regional variation of the Filigree style, as is strongly associated with that region&#x27;s iconography.

Religious architecture is also prominent throughout Australia, with large Anglican and Catholic cathedrals in every major city and Christian churches in most towns. Notable examples include St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Melbourne and St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Sydney. Other houses of worship are also common, reflecting the cultural diversity existing in Australia; the oldest Islamic structure in the Southern Hemisphere is the Central Adelaide Mosque (built in the 1880s), and one of the Southern Hemisphere&#x27;s largest Buddhist Temples is Wollongong&#x27;s Nan Tien Temple. Sydney&#x27;s Gothic-style Great Synagogue was consecrated in 1878.

Coffee palaces are large and elaborate examples of High Victorian and Second Empire styles. Historically, Australian pubs have also been noted for often distinctive designs.

Significant concern was raised during the 1960s, with developers threatening the destruction of historical buildings, especially in Sydney. Heritage concerns led to union-initiated &quot;green bans&quot;, which saved significant examples of Australia&#x27;s architectural past. Green bans helped to protect historic 18th-century buildings in The Rocks from being demolished to make way for office towers, and prevented the Royal Botanic Gardens from being turned into a car park for the Sydney Opera House.

===Visual arts===


Aboriginal rock art is the oldest continuous art tradition in the world, dating as far back as 60,000 years. From the Gwion Gwion and Wondjina imagery in the Kimberley to the Sydney rock engravings, it is spread across hundreds of thousands of sites, making Australia the richest continent in terms of prehistoric art. 19th-century Indigenous activist William Barak painted ceremonial scenes, such as corroborees. The Hermannsburg School, led by Albert Namatjira, received national fame in the 1950s for their desert watercolours. Leading critic Robert Hughes saw contemporary Indigenous art as &quot;the last great art movement of the 20th century&quot;. Key exponents such as Emily Kame Kngwarreye, Rover Thomas and the Papunya Tula group use acrylic paints on canvas to depict dreamings set in a symbolic topography. Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri&#x27;s &quot;Warlugulong&quot; (1977) typifies this style, popularly known as &quot;dot painting&quot;. Art is important both culturally and economically to Indigenous society; central Australian Indigenous communities have &quot;the highest per capita concentrations of artists anywhere in the world&quot;. Issues of race and identity are raised in the works of many &#x27;urban&#x27; Indigenous artists, including Gordon Bennett and Tracey Moffatt.
John Glover and Eugene von Guerard were among the foremost landscape painters during the colonial era. The origins of a distinctly Australian school of painting is often associated with the Heidelberg School of the late 1800s. Major figures of the movement include Tom Roberts, Arthur Streeton and Frederick McCubbin. They painted &quot;en plein air&quot;, like the French Impressionists, and sought to capture the intense light and unique colours of the Australian bush. Popular works such as McCubbin&#x27;s &quot;Down on His Luck&quot; (1889) and Roberts&#x27; &quot;Shearing the Rams&quot; (1890) defined an emerging sense of national identity in the lead-up to Federation. Civic monuments to national heroes were erected; an early example is Charles Summers&#x27; 1865 statue of the ill-fated explorers Burke and Wills, located in Melbourne.

Among the first Australian artists to gain a reputation overseas was the impressionist John Peter Russell in the 1880s. He and Charles Conder of the Heidelberg School were the only Australian painters known to have close links with the European avant-garde at the time. Other notable expatriates include Rupert Bunny, a salon painter of sensual portraits, and sculptor Bertram Mackennal, known for his commissioned works in Australia and abroad.

The Heidelberg tradition lived on in Hans Heysen&#x27;s imagery of gum trees. Roy de Maistre and Grace Cossington Smith were pioneers of modernism in Australia. Jessie Traill and Margaret Preston excelled at printmaking; the latter artist advocated for a modern national art based on Aboriginal designs. The conservative art establishment largely opposed modern art, as did the Lindsays and Australian Tonalists. Controversy over modern art in Australia reached a climax when William Dobell won the 1943 Archibald Prize for portraiture. Despite such opposition, new artistic trends grew in popularity. Photographer Max Dupain created bold modernist compositions of Sydney beach culture. Sidney Nolan, Arthur Boyd, Joy Hester and Albert Tucker were members of the Angry Penguins, a group of expressionists who revived Australian landscape painting through the use of myth, folklore and personal symbolism. The use of surrealism allowed artists to evoke the strange disquiet of the outback, exemplified in Nolan&#x27;s iconic Ned Kelly series and Russell Drysdale&#x27;s &quot;The Cricketers&quot; (1948). The post-war landscapes of Fred Williams, Ian Fairweather and John Olsen border on abstraction, while the Antipodeans and Brett Whiteley further explored the possibilities of figurative painting.

Photographer Bill Henson, sculptor Ron Mueck, and &quot;living art exhibit&quot; Leigh Bowery are among Australia&#x27;s best-known contemporary artists. Pro Hart&#x27;s output of Australiana, Michael Leunig&#x27;s poetic cartoons, and Ken Done&#x27;s Sydney Harbor views are widely known through reproductions. Public artworks have sprung up in unlikely places, from the annual Sculpture by the Sea exhibitions to the rural folk art of &quot;Australia&#x27;s big things&quot;. Australian street art flourished at the turn of the 21st century, particularly in Melbourne.

Major arts institutions in Australia include the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, the National Gallery of Australia, National Museum of Australia and National Portrait Gallery in Canberra, and the Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney. The Museum of Old and New Art in Hobart is the Southern Hemisphere&#x27;s largest private museum.

===Cinema===
Australia&#x27;s first dedicated film studio, the Limelight Department, was created by The Salvation Army in Melbourne in 1898, and is believed to be the world&#x27;s first. The world&#x27;s first feature-length film was the 1906 Australian production &quot;The Story of the Kelly Gang&quot;. Tales of bushranging, gold mining, convict life and the colonial frontier dominated the silent film era of Australian cinema. Filmmakers such as Raymond Longford and W. J. Lincoln based many of their productions on Australian novels, plays, and even paintings. An enduring classic is Longford and Lottie Lyell&#x27;s 1919 film &quot;The Sentimental Bloke&quot;, adapted from the 1915 poems by C. J. Dennis. After such early successes, Australian cinema suffered from the rise of Hollywood.

In 1933, &quot;In the Wake of the Bounty&quot; was directed by Charles Chauvel, who cast Errol Flynn as the leading actor. Flynn went on to a celebrated career in Hollywood. Chauvel directed a number of successful Australian films, the last being 1955&#x27;s &quot;Jedda&quot;, which was notable for being the first Australian film to be shot in colour, and the first to feature Aboriginal actors in lead roles and to be entered at the Cannes Film Festival. It was not until 2006 and Rolf de Heer&#x27;s &quot;Ten Canoes&quot; that a major feature-length drama was shot in an Indigenous language (Yolngu).

Ken G. Hall&#x27;s 1942 documentary feature &quot;Kokoda Front Line!&quot; was the first Australian film to win an Academy Award. In 1976, Peter Finch posthumously became the first Australian actor to win an Oscar for his role in &quot;Network&quot;.

During the late 1960s and 1970s an influx of government funding saw the development of a new generation of filmmakers telling distinctively Australian stories, including directors Peter Weir, George Miller and Bruce Beresford. This era became known as the Australian New Wave. Films such as &quot;Wake in Fright&quot;, &quot;Walkabout&quot; and &quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot; had an immediate international impact. These successes were followed in the 1980s with the historical epic &quot;Gallipoli&quot;, the romantic drama &quot;The Man From Snowy River&quot;, the comedy &quot;&quot;Crocodile&quot; Dundee&quot;, and the post-apocalyptic Mad Max series.
The 1990s saw a run of successful comedies including &quot;Muriel&#x27;s Wedding&quot; and &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot;, which helped launch the careers of Toni Collette and Baz Luhrmann respectively. Australian humour features prominently in Australian film, with a strong tradition of self-mockery, from the &quot;Ozploitation&quot; style of the Barry McKenzie &quot;expat-in-Europe&quot; movies of the 1970s, to the Working Dog Productions&#x27; 1997 homage to suburbia &quot;The Castle&quot;, starring Eric Bana in his debut film role. Comedies like the barn yard animation &quot;Babe&quot; (1995), directed by Chris Noonan; Rob Sitch&#x27;s &quot;The Dish&quot; (2000); and Stephan Elliott&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot; (1994) all feature in the top ten box-office list. During the 1990s, a new crop of Australian stars were successful in Hollywood, including Russell Crowe, Cate Blanchett and Heath Ledger. Between 1996 and 2013, Catherine Martin won four Academy Awards for her costume and production designs, the most for any Australian. &quot;Saw&quot; (2004) and &quot;Wolf Creek&quot; (2005) are credited with the revival of Australian horror. The comedic, exploitative nature and &quot;gimmicky&quot; style of 1970s Ozploitation films waned in the mid to late 1980s, as social realist dramas such as &quot;Romper Stomper&quot; (1992), &quot;Lantana&quot; (2001) and &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; (2009) became more reflective of the Australian experience in the 1980s, 90s and 2000s.

The domestic film industry is also supported by US producers who produce in Australia following the decision by Fox head Rupert Murdoch to utilise new studios in Melbourne and Sydney where filming could be completed well below US costs. Notable productions include &quot;The Matrix&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot; episodes II and III, and &quot;Australia&quot; starring Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman.

===Music===
====Indigenous music====
Music is an integral part of Aboriginal culture as a way of passing ancestral knowledge, cultural values and wisdom through generations. The most famous feature of their music is the didgeridoo, considered the &quot;national instrument of Australia&quot;. This wooden instrument, used among the Aboriginal tribes of northern Australia, makes a distinctive droning sound and it has been adopted by a wide variety of non-Aboriginal performers.

Since the 1980s, Indigenous music has experienced a &quot;cultural renaissance&quot;, turning to Western popular musical forms and &quot;demand[ing] a space within the Australian arts industry&quot;. Pioneers include Lionel Rose and Jimmy Little, while notable contemporary examples include Archie Roach, Kev Carmody, the Warumpi Band, Troy Cassar-Daley and Yothu Yindi. Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu (formerly of Yothu Yindi) has attained international success singing contemporary music in English and in the language of the Yolngu. Christine Anu is a successful Torres Strait Islander singer. Among young Australian aborigines, African-American and Aboriginal hip hop music and clothing is popular.

The Deadly Awards are an annual celebration of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander achievement in music, sport, entertainment and community.

====Folk music and national songs====

The national anthem of Australia is &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot;.

The early Anglo-Celtic immigrants of the 18th and 19th centuries introduced folk ballad traditions which were adapted to Australian themes: &quot;Bound for Botany Bay&quot; tells of the voyage of British convicts to Sydney, &quot;The Wild Colonial Boy&quot; evokes the spirit of the bushrangers, and &quot;Click Go the Shears&quot; speaks of the life of Australian shearers. The lyrics of Australia&#x27;s best-known folk song, &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot;, were written by the bush poet Banjo Paterson in 1895. This song remains popular and is regarded as &quot;the nation&#x27;s unofficial national anthem&quot;.

Well-known singers of Australian folk music include Rolf Harris (who wrote &quot;Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport&quot;), John Williamson, and Eric Bogle whose 1972 anti-war ballad &quot;And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda&quot; is a criticism of Australian involvements in Gallipolli and Vietnam War.

====Classical music====
The earliest Western musical influences in Australia can be traced back to two distinct sources: the first free settlers who brought with them the European classical music tradition, and the large body of convicts and sailors, who brought the traditional folk music of England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The practicalities of building a colony mean that there is very little music extant from this early period, although some samples of music originating from Hobart and Sydney date back to the early-19th century.

Nellie Melba traveled to Europe in 1886 to commence her international career as an opera singer. She became among the best-known Australians of the period and participated in early gramophone-recording and radio-broadcasting. The establishment of choral societies ( 1850) and of symphony orchestras ( 1890) led to increased compositional activity, although many Australian classical composers worked entirely within European models. Popular works such as Percy Grainger&#x27;s &quot;Country Gardens&quot; (1918) were heavily influenced by the folk music of other countries and by a conservative British orchestral tradition.

In the mid 20th century, as the desire to express a uniquely Australian identity in music developed, composers such as John Antill
and Peter Sculthorpe drew influences from nature and Aboriginal culture, and Richard Meale turned to south-east Asian music. Nigel Butterley combined his penchant for international modernism with his own individual voice.

At the beginning of the 1960s Australian classical music erupted with influences, with composers incorporating disparate elements into their work, ranging from Aboriginal and Southeast Asian music and instruments, to American jazz and blues, and belatedly discovering European atonality and the avant-garde. Composers like Don Banks (1923–1980), Don Kay, Malcolm Williamson and Colin Brumby (1933–2018) epitomise this period. In recent times composers including Liza Lim, Nigel Westlake, Ross Edwards, Graeme Koehne, Julian Cochran, Georges Lentz, Elena Kats-Chernin, Richard Mills, Brett Dean and Carl Vine have embodied the pinnacle of established Australian composers.

Well-known Australian classical performers include: sopranos Dame Joan Sutherland, Dame Joan Hammond, Joan Carden, Yvonne Kenny, and Emma Matthews; pianists Roger Woodward, Eileen Joyce, Geoffrey Tozer, Leslie Howard and Ian Munro; guitarists John Williams and Slava Grigoryan; horn player Barry Tuckwell; oboist Diana Doherty; violinists Richard Tognetti and Elizabeth Wallfisch; cellist David Pereira; orchestras including the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, the Australian Chamber Orchestra and the Australian Brandenburg Orchestra; and conductors Sir Charles Mackerras, and Simone Young. Indigenous performers like didgeridoo-player William Barton and immigrant musicians like Egyptian-born oud virtuoso Joseph Tawadros have stimulated interest in their own music traditions and have also collaborated with other musicians and ensembles, both in Australia and internationally.

====Popular music====

Johnny O&#x27;Keefe became the first Australian rock and roll artist to reach the national charts with his 1958 hit &quot;Wild One&quot;. While American and British content dominated airwaves and record sales into the 1960s, local successes began to emerge, notably The Easybeats and The Seekers. The Bee Gees and AC/DC rose to prominence in Australia before going on to international success. Australian performers continued to do well at a local and international level into the 1980s, for example Cold Chisel, INXS, Nick Cave, Crowded House, Midnight Oil and Little River Band. Held since 1987, the ARIAs are Australia&#x27;s premier music awards. Silverchair, Powderfinger, AC/DC, John Farnham, Jimmy Barnes, the Bee Gees, Savage Garden, Tina Arena, Vanessa Amorosi and Kylie Minogue are among the most successful artists in the awards&#x27; history. Singer-songwriter Paul Kelly, whose music style straddles folk, rock, and country, has been described as the &quot;poet laureate&quot; of Australian music. Spurred in part by the national expansion of ABC youth radio station Triple J, a string of successful alternative Australian acts have emerged since the 1990s, including You Am I, Gotye, Sia and Tame Impala.

Australian country music has developed a style quite distinct from its American counterpart, drawing more on local folklore like the Australian bushranging tradition. Pioneers of popular Australian country music include Tex Morton in the 1930s and Smoky Dawson from the 1940s onward. Known as the &quot;King of Australian Country Music&quot;, Slim Dusty released over 100 albums in a career spanning almost six decades; his 1957 hit &quot;A Pub With No Beer&quot; was the first Australian single to go gold. Dusty&#x27;s wife Joy McKean penned several of his most popular songs. Other notable Australian country music performers include John Williamson who wrote the iconic song &quot;True Blue&quot;, Lee Kernaghan, Adam Brand and Kasey Chambers. Olivia Newton-John and Keith Urban have attained success in the United States. The Tamworth Country Music Festival is held annually in Tamworth, the &quot;Country Music Capital of Australia&quot;. During the festival the Country Music Association of Australia holds the Country Music Awards of Australia ceremony awarding the Golden Guitar trophies.

===Dance===

The ceremonial dances of Indigenous Australians recount stories of the Dreamtime and have been performed for thousands of years. They usually consist of short, intensive rythmic and imitative sequences, accompanied by chants alluding to the myth of the characters danced, clapping with the hands or, sometimes, with a didgeridoo.

Bush dance is a traditional style of Australian dance with strong Celtic roots influenced by country music. It is generally accompanied by such instruments as the fiddle, accordion, concertina and percussion instruments.

===Television===

Experiments with television began in Australia in the 1930s and television was officially launched on 16 September 1956 in Sydney. Colour TV arrived in 1975. The Logie Awards are the major annual awards for Australian TV.

While US and British television is popular in Australia, locally produced content has had many successes. Successful local product has included &quot;Homicide&quot; and &quot;Division 4&quot; in the late 1960s and early 1970s, &quot;Play School&quot; and &quot;Skippy the Bush Kangaroo&quot; in the late 1960s, &quot;Matlock Police&quot;, &quot;The Sullivans&quot;, &quot;The Young Doctors&quot;, &quot;Number 96&quot; and &quot;The Box&quot; in the 1970s, &quot;The Flying Doctors&quot;, &quot;Round the Twist&quot;, &quot;Prisoner&quot; and &quot;A Country Practice&quot; (1981–1993) in the 1980s, &quot;Blue Heelers&quot;, &quot;Neighbours&quot; and &quot;Home and Away&quot; in the 1980s and 1990s and &quot;Summer Heights High&quot; and &quot;H2O: Just Add Water&quot; in the 2000s. Since then shows like &quot;Packed to the Rafters&quot;, &quot;SeaChange&quot; and &quot;Wentworth&quot; have continued to help redefine Australian television. Many of the shows from the mid-1980s onwards have been exported and have sometimes been even more successful abroad, such as Steve Irwin&#x27;s &quot;The Crocodile Hunter&quot;. Popular stars of Australian TV have included: the pioneer variety show hosts Graham Kennedy, Bert Newton, Don Lane and Daryl Somers, and contemporary talk show hosts Mike Willesee, Steve Vizard, Ray Martin, Mike Munro, Andrew Denton and Rove McManus. Popular international exports include the Bee Gees, Dame Edna Everage, Sir Les Patterson, AC/DC, The Fairies, Clive James, Geoffrey Robertson and The Wiggles. Australian Content Standard requires all free-to-air commercial networks to broadcast an annual minimum of 55% Australian content for primary channels and 1460 hours for non-primary channels between 6 a.m. and midnight.
While Australia has ubiquitous media coverage, the longest established part of that media is the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), the Federal Government owned and funded organisation offering national TV and radio coverage. The ABC, like the BBC in Britain, CBC in Canada, and PBS in the United States, is a non-commercial public service broadcaster, showing many BBC or ITV productions from Britain. The publicly funded Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) has a multicultural focus, broadcasting TV and radio programs in a variety of languages, as well as world news and documentary programming in English. SBS commenced as a commercial-free enterprise, but this changed in 2006 with the broadcasting of commercials between programs. In 2005, ABC and SBS accounted for 15.7% and 6.1% of the national ratings, respectively. 

Commercial broadcasters include the Seven Network, the Nine Network and Network Ten on free-to-air broadcasting to the larger cities with affiliated regional networks like Prime Television and WIN Television broadcasting to regional areas. Foxtel, Austar and Optus Television have been the main providers of pay TV. Fox 8 and Sky News Australia are among the popular Pay TV channels. The Australia Network, established in 2001, is Australia&#x27;s international television service, beaming to more than 44 countries across Asia, the Pacific and the Indian subcontinent.

The ABC has made a significant contribution to television drama with popular series like &quot;SeaChange&quot; and &quot;Brides of Christ&quot;, and to comedy with the 1970s hits &quot;Aunty Jack&quot; and &quot;The Norman Gunston Show&quot; and more recently Roy &amp; HG, &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot; and &quot;The Chaser&#x27;s War on Everything&quot;. ABC status as Australia&#x27;s flagship broadcaster is facing significant challenges in recent years such as budget cuts and declining in overall reach. 

==Religion==

Australia has no official state religion and the Australian Constitution prohibits the Commonwealth government from establishing a church or interfering with the freedom of religion. According to the 2011 Australian Census, 61.1% of Australians were listed as Christian. Historically, this proportion has been higher and a growing proportion of the population define themselves as irreligious, with 22.3% of Australians declaring &quot;no religion&quot; on the census. There are also growing communities of various other religions. From the early decades after federation, people from diverse religious backgrounds have held public office. The first Jewish Governor General, Isaac Isaacs, was selected by the first Catholic prime minister, James Scullin, in the 1930s. In the 21st-century, some prime ministers have identified as religious, others as non-religious.
Christianity has had an enduring impact on Australia. At the time of Federation in 1901, 97% of Australians professed to be Christians. The Anglican Church (formerly Church of England) remained the largest denomination until 1986, when it was surpassed by the Roman Catholic Church. Australian Catholics were predominantly of Irish origin until post-World War II immigration brought more than a million Catholics from elsewhere in Europe. The Christian festivals of Christmas and Easter are national public holidays in Australia. Christian charitable organisations, hospitals and schools have played a prominent role in welfare and education since colonial times. In 2008, 20% of total students attended Catholic schools. Christian organisations such as the St. Vincent de Paul Society, the Salvation Army and Anglicare provide social services throughout Australia. Historically significant Christians include preachers David Unaipon, the first Aboriginal author, and the Reverend John Flynn, who founded the Royal Flying Doctor Service. Suffragette Catherine Helen Spence was not only Australia&#x27;s first female political candidate, but also one of its first female preachers. Mary MacKillop, who co-founded an order of nuns in the 19th century, called the Sisters of St. Joseph, became the first Australian to be canonised as a Catholic Saint in 2010, and Sir Douglas Nicholls, a preacher and Aboriginal rights activist was the first Indigenous Australian to be appointed Governor of an Australian State.
The proportion of the total population who are Christian fell from 71% in 1996 to around 61.1% in 2011, while people affiliated with non-Christian religions increased from around 3.5% to 7.2% over the same period. Buddhism increased most rapidly from 1.1% to 2.5%. Increased immigration from South-East Asia has been a major factor in this growth, but Australians of Anglo-Celtic origin have also shown increasing interest in Buddhism. Islam increased during the period from 1.1% to 2.2% with diverse communities concentrated mainly in Sydney and Melbourne. The history of the Jews in Australia dates back to the First Fleet, which brought Jewish convicts to Sydney in 1788. Today, many Jews in Australia originated as refugees and Holocaust survivors who arrived during and after World War II. Hindus came to Australia as laborers and merchants during the 19th century and numbers increased dramatically from the 1960s, more than doubling between 1996 and 2006.

The tradition and spirituality of Aboriginal Australians places great emphasis on the role of tribal Elders in passing down stories of the Dreaming, and skills and lessons for survival (such as hunting and tracking). The creation story and belief system of the Aboriginal tradition, known in English as the &quot;Dreamtime&quot;, reverences the land and the animals and spirits that inhabit the land and animals. European settlement introduced Indigenous Australians to Christianity, especially through &quot;missions&quot;. There was a wide range of experiences of the missions by Aboriginal people.

==Public holidays==

The national Australia Day holiday is celebrated on 26 January, the anniversary of the day First Fleet Captain Arthur Phillip first raised the Union Jack flag in Sydney Cove. That date marks the beginning of modern Australia and national awards are distributed to distinguished citizens for services to the community, as on the King&#x27;s Birthday.

Also strongly associated with Australian nationhood is Anzac Day. It specifically commemorates the landing of troops in the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915. The day is named in their honour but more generally commemorates all Australians who have fought in wars.

The Christian festivals of Easter and Christmas are public holidays in Australia. Christmas Day, 25 December, falls during the Southern Hemisphere summer.

The King&#x27;s Birthday is generally observed on the second Monday in June, except in Western Australia, where it usually is observed in September or October to distance it from Western Australia Day.

New Year&#x27;s Day is celebrated and coincidentally marks the date upon which the Australian colonies officially federated in 1901.

Labor Day is also a public holiday, but on different days throughout the nation.

==Cuisine==
Contemporary Australian cuisine combines British and Indigenous origins with Mediterranean and Asian influences. Australia&#x27;s abundant natural resources allow access to a large variety of quality meats, and to barbecue beef or lamb in the open air is considered a cherished national tradition. The great majority of Australians live close to the sea and Australian seafood restaurants have been listed among the world&#x27;s best.

Bush tucker refers to a wide variety of plant and animal foods native to the Australian bush: bush fruits such as kakadu plums, finger limes and desert quandongs; fish and shellfish of Australia&#x27;s saltwater river systems; and bush meats including emu, crocodile and kangaroo. Many of these are still seasonally hunted and gathered by Indigenous Australians, and are undergoing a renaissance of interest on contemporary Australian menus. The macadamia nut is the most famous bushfood plant harvested and sold in large quantities.
Early British settlers brought familiar meats and crops with them from Europe and these remain important in the Australian diet. The British settlers found some familiar game – such as swan, goose, pigeon, and fish – but the new settlers often had difficulty adjusting to the prospect of native fauna as a staple diet. They established agricultural industries producing more familiar Western style produce. Queensland and New South Wales became Australia&#x27;s main beef cattle producers, while dairy cattle farming is found in the southern states, predominantly in Victoria. Wheat and other grain crops are spread fairly evenly throughout the mainland states. Sugar cane is also a major crop in Queensland and New South Wales. Fruit and vegetables are grown throughout Australia. &quot;Meat and three veg&quot;, fish and chips, and the Australian meat pie continue to represent traditional meals for many Australians. The post-World War II multicultural immigration program brought new flavours and influences, with waves of immigrants from Greece, Italy, Thailand, Vietnam, China, and elsewhere bringing about diversification and of the typical diet consumed–leading to an increasingly gastronomical culinary scene.

Australia&#x27;s fishing zone is the third largest in the world and allows for easy access to seafood which significantly influences Australian cuisine. Clean ocean environments produce high quality seafoods. Lobster, prawns, tuna, salmon and abalone are the main ocean species harvested commercially, while aquaculture produces more than 60 species for consumption, including oysters, salmonoids, southern bluefin tuna, mussels, prawns, barramundi, yellowtail kingfish, and freshwater finifish. While inland river and lake systems are relatively sparse, they nevertheless provide some unique fresh water game fish and crustacea suitable for dining. Fishing and aquaculture constitute Australia&#x27;s fifth most valuable agricultural industry after wool, beef, wheat and dairy.

Vegemite is a well-known spread originating from Australia. Iconic Australian desserts include pavlova and lamingtons. ANZAC biscuits recall the diet of Australia&#x27;s World War I soldiers at the Battle of Gallipoli.

===Beverages===
Australia&#x27;s reputation as a nation of heavy drinkers goes back to the earliest days of colonial Sydney, when rum was used as currency and grain shortages followed the installation of the first stills. James Squires is considered to have founded Australia&#x27;s first commercial brewery in 1798 and the Cascade Brewery in Hobart has been operating since 1832. Since the 1970s, Australian beers have become increasingly popular globally, with Foster&#x27;s Lager being an iconic export. Foster&#x27;s is not however the biggest seller on the local market, with alternatives including Carlton Draught and Victoria Bitter outselling it.

Billy tea was a staple drink of the Australian colonial period, considered to be a symbol of the bush lifestyle. It is typically boiled over a camp fire on a billy can, with a gum or lemon myrtle leaf added for flavouring.

The Australian wine industry is one of the largest exporters of wine in the world, contributing $2.2 billion to the nation&#x27;s economy in 2023–24. Wine is produced in every state, however, wine regions are mainly in the southern, cooler regions. Among the most famous wine districts are the Hunter Valley and Barossa Valley and among the best known wine producers are Penfolds, Rosemount Estate, Wynns Coonawarra Estate and Lindemans. The Australian Penfolds Grange was the first wine from outside France or California to win the &quot;Wine Spectator&quot; award for Wine of the Year in 1995.

==Clothing and apparel==
Australia has no official designated national dress, but iconic local styles include &quot;bushwear&quot; and &quot;surfwear&quot;. The country&#x27;s best-known fashion event is Australian Fashion Week, a twice yearly industry gathering showcasing seasonal collections from Australian and Asia Pacific Designers. Top Australian models include Elle Macpherson, Miranda Kerr and Jennifer Hawkins (Miss Universe 2004).

Major clothing brands associated with bushwear are the broad brimmed Akubra hats, Driza-Bone coats and RM Williams bushmen&#x27;s outfitters (featuring in particular: moleskin trousers, riding boots and merino woolwear). Blundstone Footwear and Country Road are also linked to this tradition. Made from the leaves of &quot;Livistona australis&quot;, the cabbage tree hat was the first uniquely Australian headwear, dating back to the early 1800s, and was the hat of choice for colonial-born Australians. Traditionally worn by jackaroos and swagmen in the blow-fly infested Australian outback, the cork hat is a type of headgear strongly associated with Australia, and comprises cork strung from the brim, to ward off insects.

World-famous Australian surfwear labels include Billabong, Rip Curl, Mambo and Quiksilver. Australian surfers popularised the ugg boot, a unisex sheepskin boot with fleece on the inside, a tanned outer surface and a synthetic sole. Worn by the working classes in Australia, the boot style emerged as a global fashion trend in the 2000s. Underwear and sleepwear brands include Bonds, Berlei, Bras N Things and Peter Alexander Sleepwear.

The slouch hat was first worn by military forces in Australia in 1885, looped up on one side so that rifles could be held at the slope without damaging the brim. After federation, the slouch hat became standard Australian Army headgear in 1903 and since then it has developed into an important national symbol and is worn on ceremonial occasions by the Australian army.

Australians generally have a relaxed attitude to what beachgoers wear, although this has not always been the case. At the start of the twentieth century a proposed ordinance in Sydney would have forced men to wear skirts over their &quot;bathing costume&quot; to be decent. This led to the 1907 Sydney bathing costume protests which resulted in the proposal being dropped. In 1961, Bondi inspector Aub Laidlaw, already known for kicking women off the beach for wearing bikinis, arrested several men wearing swim briefs charging them with indecency. The judge found the men not guilty because no pubic hair was exposed. As time went on Australians&#x27; attitudes to swimwear became much more relaxed. Over time swim briefs, better known locally as speedos after the Australian brand, became an iconic swimwear for males.

==Sport==

Early colonial Australian sport was influenced by British sport heritage brough by the convicts and free settlers, serving as an nostalgic link to their nations of origin and a way for replicating the English lifestyle for the upper classes in an environment far from familiar for the settlers. As a result of this influence, many Australians are passionate about sport, and it forms a major part of the country&#x27;s culture and economy in terms of spectating and participation. Cricket is popular in the summer, and football codes are popular in the winter. Australian traditions such as grand finals and footy tipping are shared among the codes.

Australia&#x27;s successes in events such as the Olympic Games, Commonwealth Games, World Cup competitions in cricket, rugby union, rugby league, field hockey, netball, and major tournaments in tennis, golf, surfing, and other sports are a source of pride for many Australians. Sports people such as Donald Bradman, Dawn Fraser, and Cathy Freeman remain in the nation&#x27;s cultural memory and are accorded high civilian honours and public status.

===Cricket===
Cricket is Australia&#x27;s most popular summer sport and has been played since colonial times. It is followed in all states and territories, unlike the football codes which vary in popularity between regions.
The first recorded cricket match in Australia took place in Sydney in 1803. Intercolonial contests started in 1851 and Sheffield Shield inter-state cricket continues to this day. In 1866–67, prominent cricketer and Australian rules football pioneer Tom Wills coached an Aboriginal cricket team, which later toured England in 1868 under the captaincy of Charles Lawrence. The 1876–77 season is notable for a match between a combined XI from New South Wales and Victoria and a touring English team at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, which was later recognised as the first Test match. A famous victory on the 1882 tour of England resulted in the placement of a satirical obituary in an English newspaper saying that English cricket had &quot;died&quot;, and the &quot;body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia&quot;. The English media then dubbed the next English tour to Australia (1882–83) as the quest to &quot;regain the ashes&quot;. This success of the national cricket team ignited sport nationalism in the Australian population, and ultimately helped pave the way for political federation. The tradition continues with the Ashes series, an icon of the sporting rivalry between the two countries.

Australian cricket developed more distinctive traditions after 1900, paralleling the federation of the country in 1901, wich helped stimulate pride for &quot;Australian things&quot;. Successful cricketers often become lasting celebrities in Australia. Sir Donald Bradman, who made his Test debut in the 1928–29 series against England, is regarded as the game&#x27;s greatest batsman and a byword for sporting excellence. Other Australian cricketers who remain household names include Richie Benaud, Dennis Lillee and Shane Warne and others who pursued media careers after they retired from the game. Internationally, Australia has for most of the last century sat at or near the top of the cricketing world. In the 1970s, Australian media tycoon Kerry Packer founded World Series Cricket from which many international forms of the game have evolved.

Events on the cricket pitch have occasionally been elevated to diplomatic incidents in Australian history, such as the infamous Bodyline controversy of the 1930s, in which the English team bowled in a physically intimidating way leading to accusations of &quot;unsportsmanlike&quot; conduct.

===Football codes===
Australian rules football is the most highly attended spectator sport in Australia. Its core support lies in four of the six states: Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. Originating in Melbourne and codified during the late 1850s and early 1860s, the sport is the world&#x27;s oldest codified football game. The national competition, the Australian Football League (AFL), evolved from the Victorian Football League in 1990, and has expanded to all states except Tasmania. The AFL Grand Final is traditionally played on the last Saturday of September at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the sport&#x27;s &quot;spiritual home&quot;. Australian rules football culture has a strong set of rituals and traditions, such as kick-to-kick and . International rules football is a hybrid sport of Australian football and Gaelic football devised to facilitate matches between Australia and Ireland.

Rugby union was first played in Australia in the 1860s and is followed predominately in Queensland, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. The national team is known as the Wallabies. Despite having a relatively small player base, Australia has twice won the Rugby World Cup, in 1991 and 1999, and hosted the 2003 Rugby World Cup. Other notable competitions include the annual Bledisloe Cup, played against Australia&#x27;s main rivals, the New Zealand All Blacks, and the Rugby Championship, involving South Africa, New Zealand, and Argentina. Provincial teams from Australia, South Africa and New Zealand compete in the annual Super Rugby competition. Rugby test matches are also popular and have at times become highly politicised, such as when many Australians, including the Wallabies, demonstrated against the racially selected South African teams of the 1970s. Notable Australian rugby union players include Sir Edward Dunlop, Mark Ella and David Campese.

In 1908, rugby league was established in Australia, by former rugby union players and supporters as a breakaway professional code. The new code gained and has maintained a wider following in Australia than rugby union, which remained amateur until the 1990s. The sport has roots in the working class communities of Lancashire and Yorkshire in Northern England, translating to similar areas in Sydney and Brisbane. The elite club competition is the National Rugby League (NRL), which features ten teams from New South Wales, four teams from Queensland, and one team each from Victoria, Australian Capital Territory and New Zealand. The season culminates in the NRL Grand Final. The New South Wales Blues and Queensland Maroons compete in the annual State of Origin series. Australia&#x27;s national team, the Kangaroos, has contested all 15 Rugby League World Cup titles, winning 11 of them.

Despite attracting less media attention, spectators and sponsorship than Australian rules football and rugby league, soccer is Australia&#x27;s highest participation football code, although in South Australia, Australian rules football is still the most-participated football code. During the second half of the 20th century many Australian soccer clubs were based around ethnic groups, mostly European. However, the national league was completely reformed in 2004. Australia&#x27;s national male team, the Socceroos, has competed in the finals of five FIFA World Cup championships. In 2006 the Socceroos moved from the Oceania Football Confederation to the Asian Football Confederation, a much stronger confederation which has allowed the Australian team to avoid repetition of a history of missed World Cup qualifications in forced sudden-death playoffs. Australia won the 2015 AFC Asian Cup. Major international stars from Australia include Tim Cahill, Mark Viduka, Mark Schwarzer and Harry Kewell. In the 2023 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, Australia&#x27;s national women&#x27;s team set an Australian TV rating record, averaging 7.13 million viewers in the semi-finals against England, after the previous game against France became the most viewed event of the year. The significant outpouring of community support for the team was dubbed by the media as &quot;Matildas fever&quot;.

===Water sports===
Australia&#x27;s warm climate and long coastline of sandy beaches and rolling waves provide ideal conditions for water sports such as swimming and surfing. The majority of Australians live in cities or towns on or near the coast, and so beaches are a place that millions of Australians visit regularly.

Swimming is a popular pastime for Australians. In the early 1900s, members of the Australian Cavill family pioneered the crawl stroke (&quot;Australian crawl&quot;) and butterfly stroke. Australia is a world power in Olympic swimming, second only to the United States in total gold medals in the sport. Swimmers like Dawn Fraser, Kieren Perkins and Ian Thorpe have taken multiple gold medals. Most states have a compulsory school swimming program, so it is common for Australians to be competent in swimming and water safety.

Australians have a particular affinity for surf lifesaving, and surf lifesavers have a revered status in Australian culture. The world&#x27;s first surf lifesaving club, Bondi Surf Bathers&#x27; Life Saving Club, was founded at Bondi Beach, Sydney, in 1906. Surf Life Saving Australia has conducted hundreds of thousands of rescues around Australia. Tens of thousands of Australians compete in surf lifesaving training and competitions, such as Ironman events.

In the summer of 1915, Duke Kahanamoku of Hawaii introduced surf board riding to Sydney&#x27;s Freshwater Beach, amazing locals and starting a long-term love affair with the sport in Australia. Over 1 in 10 Australians surf recreationally, and more Australians have been declared world surfing champions than any other nation.

The Sydney to Hobart yacht race is a much anticipated fixture on the Australian sporting calendar. Australia won the America&#x27;s Cup under skipper John Bertrand in 1983, becoming the first country other than the United States to win the race.

===Other sports===

Horse racing has had a prominent place in Australian culture since the colonial era, with the first spectator sports event in Australia being Lachlan Macquarie&#x27;s race meeting at Hyde Park, Sydney, in 1810. First run in 1861, the Melbourne Cup is known as &quot;the race that stops a nation&quot; for the enthusiasm with which Australians tune in for the annual race, and is said to encapsulate the country&#x27;s twin obsessions of sport and gambling.

Basketball is popular in Australia in terms of participation, especially among children. The National Basketball League (NBL) began in 1979 and is contested by eight teams—seven from Australia and one from New Zealand. The Women&#x27;s National Basketball League (WNBL) is the top women&#x27;s basketball league, having begun in 1981, and the national women&#x27;s team (the Opals) has won medals at the Olympics since 1994. Netball has the highest participation rate of any women&#x27;s sport in Australia. Established in 2008, the ANZ Championship is the premier netball league in Australia and New Zealand, featuring five teams from each country. The Australian national netball team (the Diamonds) is considered the best in the world, having won 10 of 13 World Netball Championships.

The Australian V8 Supercars series is steadily growing in popularity across the world, where television coverage allows.

Australia regularly raises world champion field hockey teams. Australian cyclists have won international cycling competitions, most notably Cadel Evans&#x27; win in the 2011 Tour de France. In 2008, the Tour Down Under, centred around Adelaide, became the first UCI ProTour cycling race to be held outside of Europe. Among young people and within schools nationwide, various forms of handball or downball games have been among the most prevalent sports games for some decades.
Snow sports are enjoyed in the Australian Alps and in Tasmania. Skiing in Australia was first introduced by Norwegian miners in the gold mining town of Kiandra in the Snowy Mountains of New South Wales around 1859. The sport remains a popular winter activity in the south-eastern states and territories. Major alpine skiing resorts include Thredbo, Perisher and Charlotte Pass in New South Wales; Mount Hotham, Falls Creek and Mount Buller in Victoria and Mount Ben Lomond in Tasmania. Extensive areas are available for cross country skiing within national parks including Kosciuszko National Park (NSW), Alpine National Park (VIC); Namadgi National Park (ACT) and in the Tasmanian Wilderness. Australia has long participated in the Winter Olympics and has won medals at the Games since the 1990s.

Increased interest and participation in American sports has led to opportunities for Australians to play at the top level in sports such as baseball, ice hockey and American football. Grant Balfour is a relief pitcher for the Tampa Bay Rays, and played in the 2008 World Series. The skill set of Australian rules footballers fits the mould of US National Football League (NFL) punters, and they stand out from their American peers with their ability to tackle returners. Two former AFL footballers competed in the 2009 NFC Championship game as punters, Saverio Rocca for the Philadelphia Eagles and Ben Graham for the Arizona Cardinals. Graham&#x27;s appearance in Super Bowl XLIII made him the first Australian to play in the NFL&#x27;s championship game. The first College Bowl game to feature two Australians was the 2012 BCS National Championship Game with punter Brad Wing from LSU and defensive end Jesse Williams for Alabama. In 2018, Nathan Walker, the first Australian drafted by an NHL team, also became the first to play on a Stanley Cup winning team, the 2018 Washington Capitals.

==Folklore==
Australian stories and legends have a cultural significance independent of their empirical truth or falsehood. This can be seen in the portrayal of bushranger Ned Kelly as a mixture of the underdog and Robin Hood and an example of “the independence and the maverick spirit of early Australia”.

Militarily, Australians have served in numerous overseas wars, ranging from World War I through to recent regional security missions, such as East Timor, Iraq and Afghanistan. Australian war culture generally consists of somber reflection and commemoration, focusing on “on-field heroism and sacrifice” rather than glory. An annual national holiday, Anzac Day, exists for this purpose. The Australian experience of defeat in the Gallipoli Campaign, the first iconic moment in modern Australia&#x27;s involvement in war, is viewed by Australians with both pride for the fighting of the soldiers, and bitterness for the perceived negligence on the part of British commanders. The instances of bravery and determination displayed during the campaign for Gallipoli, as well as the mutual respect for their Turkish adversaries led by Kemal Atatürk, are seen as part of the ANZAC spirit. During the First World War, Australian soldiers were considered to be remarkably determined, united and hard-working. Many Australians knew how to ride and shoot prior to enlistment, making them talented recruits, but they were also infamous for their lax attitude towards formal parade ground discipline, a notoriety that the Australian soldiers reveled in. From this the notion of the larrikin Digger emerged, an important part of contemporary Australian identity.

==Attitudes, beliefs and stereotypes==

Critics and scholars have sometimes scrutinised the Australian culture, with aspects of it loosely criticised for being kitsch, low-brow or rooted in poor taste. The term &quot;cultural cringe&quot; was coined to describe this entrenched national inferiority complex which assumes ideas and cultures of other places are automatically superior. Some links have been made between the cultural cringe and a perceived anti-intellectualism that has underpinned public life in Australia. Some commentators have noted a decline in the cultural cringe in the 21st century, with a &quot;social change&quot; and wider reverence for Australian culture.

The phrase &quot;the lucky country&quot;, coined by Donald Horne, is a reference to Australia&#x27;s weather, lifestyle, and history. Ironically, Horne was using the term to denigrate the political philistinism, a lack of innovation and criticise the complacency of Australian society in the early 1960s. Since he coined the phrase it has commonly been misapplied by both the media and general public to denote Australia&#x27;s perceived fortunes. Despite Horne&#x27;s lament that Australia had no &quot;major city&quot; that &quot;set the nation&#x27;s trends&quot;, a counter-cultural movement and intellectual scene known as the Sydney Push did emerge in Sydney in the 1940s–70s, of which feminist Germaine Greer was a noted member.

&quot;Mateship&quot;, or loyal fraternity is the code of conduct, particularly between men, although more recently also between men and women, stressing equality and friendship. The value of mateship is sourced in the difficulty of subduing the land. Unlike other cultures based on a nurturing landscape that they seek to protect from others, Australian settlers experienced great hardship and had to support each other in order to survive. The battle against the elements led to the nickname of a member of Australia&#x27;s working class being the &quot;Aussie battler&quot;.

An aspect of the mateship culture on language is that Australians have a propensity for the diminutive forms of names e.g. Hargrave → Hargie; Wilkinson → Wilko; John → Johnno; David → Davo; Hogan → Hoges; James → Jimmy → Jim → Jimbo. This is a display of affection and acceptance rather than belittlement. Any disloyalty to or poor treatment of their &quot;mates&quot; is treated harshly. Australians particularly dislike bragging or overly advertising one&#x27;s own successes. The term &quot;tall poppy syndrome&quot; is commonly used to describe people who grow greater than their peers and are harshly criticised as being narcissistic, or &quot;up themselves&quot;. Even the most successful and beautiful Australians are eager to proclaim how ordinary they are, to the extent that two-thirds of the highest earning households define themselves as middle class, lower middle class or even working class. This egalitarian social system makes Australians appear &quot;laid-back&quot;, welcoming or relaxed to others. Australians generally address one another verbally by the first name alone. In formal situations, people may use a person’s title (e.g. Mr., Mrs., Ms., Doctor, etc.) followed by their family name. Middle names are almost never used to address a person, unless quoted on formal/legal documentation.

The mateship culture combined with the original convict and then colonial culture has created an irreverence for established authority, particularly if it is pompous or out of touch with reality. Politicians, or &quot;pollies&quot;, are generally disliked and distrusted. Politicians who seek to lead must comply to the views of the egalitarian electorate, who will punish any hint of arrogance or glory-seeking behavior. Voter turnout at elections had in fact been so low that compulsory voting was introduced for the 1925 federal election.

Mirroring the tall poppy syndrome which brings back to Earth the high fliers, the egalitarian Australian society has a traditional Australian support for the underdog. Australians will show support for those who appear to be at a disadvantage even when the underdog is competing against fellow Australians, such as in sporting events. Related to the underdog is the belief in a &quot;fair go&quot;, which is said to be a key part of Australian culture and Australian society. One accepted definition of a &quot;fair go&quot; in this Australian sense is &quot;a chance, an adequate opportunity. Often used to describe a fair and reasonable course of action&quot;.
The right to &quot;a fair go&quot; has been found to be the most highly rated value on a recent published survey of the opinion of Australian citizens. This belief sustains bipartisan political support for strong public health and education systems in Australia, as well as equal opportunity legislation to ensure people are not excluded from jobs or positions by their race, gender or sexual orientation.
This value is frequently cited by politicians who wish to associate themselves or their party with the positive connotations of this notion. There has been ongoing public and political discussion of the place and future of &quot;the fair go&quot; in Australian society. This is especially frequent with reference to economics issues and policies. The call for &quot;a fair go&quot; is also regularly used by advocates wanting to point out groups who have been overlooked or treated unfairly according to the expectations of treatment by the wider community. Recent examples of this include media presentation of the treatment of illegal immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees, as well as the community campaign in support of &quot;a fair go&quot; for the large group of Australian doctors who have been classified as &quot;non-vocationally registered general practitioners&quot; (non-VR GPs), and are subject to discriminatory pay and conditions compared to their colleagues, for identical work.

<text>Stanley Augustus Holloway (1 October 1890 – 30 January 1982) was an English actor, comedian, singer and monologist. He was famous for his comic and character roles on stage and screen, especially that of Alfred P. Doolittle in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. He was also renowned for his comic monologues and songs, which he performed and recorded throughout most of his 70-year career.

Born in London, Holloway pursued a career as a clerk in his teen years. He made early stage appearances before infantry service in the First World War, after which he had his first major theatre success starring in &quot;Kissing Time&quot; when the musical transferred to the West End from Broadway. In 1921, he joined a concert party, &quot;The Co-Optimists&quot;, and his career began to flourish. At first, he was employed chiefly as a singer, but his skills as an actor and reciter of comic monologues were soon recognised. Characters from his monologues such as Sam Small, invented by Holloway, and Albert Ramsbottom, created for him by Marriott Edgar, were absorbed into popular British culture, and Holloway developed a following for the recordings of his many monologues. By the 1930s, he was in demand to star in variety, pantomime and musical comedy, including several revues.

Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Holloway made short propaganda films on behalf of the British Film Institute and Pathé News and took character parts in a series of films including &quot;Major Barbara&quot;, &quot;The Way Ahead&quot;, &quot;This Happy Breed&quot; and &quot;The Way to the Stars&quot;. In the decade after the war, he appeared in the film &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; and made a series of films for Ealing Studios, including &quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot;, &quot;The Lavender Hill Mob&quot; and &quot;The Titfield Thunderbolt&quot;.

In 1956 he was cast as the irresponsible and irrepressible Alfred P. Doolittle in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, a role that he played on Broadway, the West End and in the film version in 1964. The role brought him international fame, and his performances earned him nominations for a Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. In his later years, Holloway appeared in television series in the UK and the US, toured in revues, appeared in stage plays in Britain, Canada, Australia and the US, and continued to make films into his eighties. Holloway was married twice and had five children, including the actor Julian Holloway.

==Biography==

===Family background and early life===
Holloway was born in Manor Park, Essex (now in the London Borough of Newham), on 1 October 1890. He was the younger child and only son of George Augustus Holloway (1860–1919), a lawyer&#x27;s clerk, and Florence May (, 1862–1913), a housekeeper and dressmaker. He was named after Henry Morton Stanley, the journalist and explorer famous for his exploration of Africa and for his search for David Livingstone. There were theatrical connections in the Holloway family going back to Charles Bernard (1830–1894), an actor and theatre manager, who was the brother of Holloway&#x27;s maternal grandmother.

Holloway&#x27;s paternal grandfather was Augustus Holloway (1829–1884), brought up in Poole, Dorset. Augustus became a wealthy shopkeeper, with a brush-making business. He married Amelia Catherine Knight in September 1856, and they had three children, Maria, Charles and George. In the early 1880s the family moved to Poplar, London. When Augustus died, George Holloway (Stanley&#x27;s father) moved to nearby Manor Park and became a clerk for a city lawyer, Robert Bell. George married Bell&#x27;s daughter Florence in 1884, and they had two children, Millie (1887–1949) and Stanley. George left Florence in 1905 and was never seen or heard from again by his family.

During his early teenage years, Holloway attended the Worshipful School of Carpenters in nearby Stratford and joined a local choir, which he later called his &quot;big moment&quot;. He left school at the age of 14 and worked as a junior clerk in a boot polish factory, where he earned ten shillings a week. He began performing part-time as &quot;Master Stanley Holloway – The Wonderful Boy Soprano&quot; from 1904, singing sentimental songs such as &quot;The Lost Chord&quot;. A year later, he became a clerk at Billingsgate Fish Market, where he remained for two years before commencing training as an infantry soldier in the London Rifle Brigade in 1907.

===Career===
====Early career and First World War====

Holloway&#x27;s stage career began in 1910, when he travelled to Walton-on-the-Naze to audition for &quot;The White Coons Show&quot;, a concert party variety show arranged and produced by Will C. Pepper, father of Harry S. Pepper, with whom Holloway later starred in &quot;The Co-Optimists&quot;. This seaside show lasted six weeks. From 1912 to 1914, Holloway appeared in the summer seasons at the West Cliff Gardens Theatre, Clacton-on-Sea, where he was billed as a romantic baritone.

In 1913 Holloway was recruited by the comedian Leslie Henson to feature as a support in Henson&#x27;s more prestigious concert party called &quot;Nicely, Thanks&quot;. In later life, Holloway often spoke of his admiration for Henson, citing him as a great influence on his career. The two became firm friends and often consulted each other before taking jobs. In his 1967 autobiography, Holloway dedicated a whole chapter to Henson, whom he described as &quot;the greatest friend, inspiration and mentor a performer could have had&quot;. Later in 1913, Holloway decided to train as an operatic baritone, and so he went to Italy to take singing lessons from Ferdinando Guarino in Milan. However, a yearning to start a career in light entertainment and a contract to re-appear in Bert Graham and Will Bentley&#x27;s concert party at the West Cliff Theatre caused him to return home after six months.

In the early months of 1914, Holloway made his first visit to the United States and then went to Buenos Aires and Valparaíso with the concert party &quot;The Grotesques&quot;. At the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, he decided to return to England, but his departure was delayed for six weeks due to his contract with the troupe. At the age of 25, Holloway enlisted in the Connaught Rangers in which he was commissioned as a subaltern in December 1915 because of his previous training in the London Rifle Brigade. In 1916 he was stationed in Cork and fought against the rebels in the Easter Rising. Later that year, he was sent to France, where he fought in the trenches alongside Michael O&#x27;Leary, who was awarded the Victoria Cross for gallantry in February 1915. Holloway and O&#x27;Leary stayed in touch after the war and remained close friends.

Holloway spent much of his time in the later part of the war organising shows to boost army morale in France. One such revue, &quot;Wear That Ribbon&quot;, was performed in honour of O&#x27;Leary winning the VC. He, Henson and his newly established &quot;Star Attractions&quot; concert party, entertained the British troops in Wimereux. The party included such performers as Jack Buchanan, Eric Blore, Binnie Hale, and Phyllis Dare, as well as the performers who would later form &quot;The Co-Optimists&quot;. Upon his return from France, Holloway was stationed in Hartlepool, and immediately after the war ended he starred in &quot;The Disorderly Room&quot; with Leslie Henson, which Eric Blore had written while serving in the South Wales Borderers. The production toured theatres on England&#x27;s coast, including Walton-on-the-Naze and Clacton-on-Sea.

====Inter-war years====

After relinquishing his army commission in May 1919, Holloway returned to London and resumed his singing and acting career, finding success in two West End musicals at the Winter Garden Theatre. Later that month, he created the role of Captain Wentworth in Guy Bolton and P. G. Wodehouse&#x27;s &quot;Kissing Time&quot;, followed in 1920 by the role of René in &quot;A Night Out&quot;. Following its provincial success, &quot;The Disorderly Room&quot; was given a West End production at the Victoria Palace Theatre in late 1919, in which Holloway starred alongside Henson and Tom Walls. Holloway made his film debut in a 1921 silent comedy called &quot;The Rotters&quot;.

From June 1921, Holloway had considerable success in &quot;The Co-Optimists&quot;, a concert party formed with performers whom he had met during the war in France, which &quot;The Times&quot; called &quot;an all-star &#x27;pierrot&#x27; entertainment in the West-end.&quot; It opened at the small Royalty Theatre and soon transferred to the much larger Palace Theatre, where the initial version of the show ran for over a year, giving more than 500 performances. The entertainment was completely rewritten at regular intervals to keep it fresh, and the final edition, beginning in November 1926, was the 13th version. &quot;The Co-Optimists&quot; closed in 1927 at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre after 1,568 performances over eight years. In 1929, a feature film version was made, with Holloway rejoining his former co-stars.

In 1923 Holloway established himself as a BBC Radio performer. The early BBC broadcasts brought variety and classical artists together, and Holloway could be heard in the same programme as the cellist John Barbirolli or the Band of the Scots Guards. He developed his solo act throughout the 1920s while continuing his involvement with the musical theatre and &quot;The Co-Optimists&quot;. In 1924 he made his first gramophone discs, recording for His Master&#x27;s Voice two songs from &quot;The Co-Optimists&quot;: &quot;London Town&quot; and &quot;Memory Street&quot;. After &quot;The Co-Optimists&quot; disbanded in 1927, Holloway played at the London Hippodrome in Vincent Youmans&#x27;s musical comedy &quot;Hit the Deck&quot; as Bill Smith, a performance judged by &quot;The Times&quot; to be &quot;invested with many shrewd touches of humanity&quot;. In &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, Ivor Brown praised him for a singing style &quot;which coaxes the ear rather than clubbing the head.&quot;
Holloway began regularly performing monologues, both on stage and on record, in 1928, with his own creation, Sam Small, in &quot;Sam, Sam, Pick oop thy Musket&quot;. Over the following years, he recorded more than 20 monologues based around the character, most of which he wrote himself. He created Sam Small after Henson had returned from a tour of northern England and told him a story about an insubordinate old soldier from the Battle of Waterloo. Holloway developed the character, naming him after a Cockney friend of Henson called Annie Small; the name Sam was chosen at random. Holloway adopted a northern accent for the character. &quot;The Times&quot; commented, &quot;For absolute delight ... there is nothing to compare with Mr. Stanley Holloway&#x27;s monologue, concerning a military contretemps on the eve of Waterloo ... perfect, even to the curled moustache and the Lancashire accent of the stubborn Guardsman hero.&quot;

In 1929 Holloway played another leading role in musical comedy, Lieutenant Richard Manners in &quot;Song of the Sea&quot;, and later that year he performed in the revue &quot;Coo-ee&quot;, with Billy Bennett, Dorothy Dickson and Claude Hulbert. When &quot;The Co-Optimists&quot; re-formed in 1930, he rejoined that company, now at the Savoy Theatre, and at the same venue appeared in &quot;Savoy Follies&quot; in 1931, where he introduced to London audiences the monologue &quot;The Lion and Albert&quot;. The monologue was written by Marriott Edgar, who based the story on a news item about a boy who was eaten by a lion in the zoo. In the monologue, Mr. and Mrs. Ramsbottom react in a measured way when their son Albert is swallowed. Neither Edgar nor Holloway was convinced that the piece would succeed, but needing material for an appearance at a Northern Rugby League dinner Holloway decided to perform it. It was well received, and Holloway introduced it into his stage act. Subsequently, Edgar wrote 16 monologues for him. In its obituary of Holloway, &quot;The Times&quot; wrote that Sam and Albert &quot;became part of English folklore during the 1930s, and they remained so during the Second World War.&quot; These monologues employed the Holloway style that has been called &quot;the understated look-on-the-bright-side world of the cockney working class. ... Holloway&#x27;s characters are [mischievous, like Albert, or] obstinate, and hilariously clueless. He often told his stories in costume; sporting outrageous attire and bushy moustaches.&quot; In 1932 Harry S. Pepper, with Holloway and others, revived the White Coons Concert Party show for BBC Radio.

Beginning in 1934, Holloway appeared in a series of British films, three of which featured his creation Sam Small. He started his association with the filmmakers Ealing Studios in 1934, appearing in the fifth Gracie Fields picture &quot;Sing As We Go&quot;. His other films from the 1930s included &quot;Squibs&quot; (1935) and &quot;The Vicar of Bray&quot; (1937). In December 1934, Holloway made his first appearance in pantomime, playing Abanazar in &quot;Aladdin&quot;. In his first season in the part, he was overshadowed by his co-star, Sir Henry Lytton, as the Emperor, but he quickly became established as a favourite in his role, playing it in successive years in Leeds, London, Edinburgh and Manchester.

====Second World War and post-war====
On the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 Holloway, who was 48, was too old for active service. Instead, he appeared in short propaganda pieces for the British Film Institute and Pathé News. He narrated documentaries aimed at lifting war-time morale in Britain, including &quot;Albert&#x27;s Savings&quot; (1940), written by Marriott Edgar and featuring the character Albert Ramsbottom, and &quot;Worker and Warfront No.8&quot; (1943), with a script written by E. C. Bentley about a worker who neglects to have an injury examined and contracts blood poisoning. Both films were included on a 2007 Imperial War Museum DVD &quot;Britain&#x27;s Home Front at War: Words for Battle&quot;.

On stage during the war years, Holloway appeared in revues, first &quot;Up and Doing&quot;, with Henson, Binnie Hale and Cyril Ritchard in 1940 and 1941, and then &quot;Fine and Dandy&quot;, with Henson, Dorothy Dickson, Douglas Byng and Graham Payn. In both shows, Holloway presented new monologues, and &quot;The Times&quot; thought a highlight of &quot;Fine and Dandy&quot; was a parody of the BBC radio programme &quot;The Brains Trust&quot;, with Holloway &quot;ponderously anecdotal&quot; and Henson &quot;gigglingly omniscient&quot;.

In 1941 Holloway took a character part in Gabriel Pascal&#x27;s film of Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Major Barbara&quot;, in which he played a policeman. He had leading parts in later films, including &quot;The Way Ahead&quot; (1944), &quot;This Happy Breed&quot; (1944) and &quot;The Way to the Stars&quot; (1945). After the war, he played Albert Godby in &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; and had a cameo role as the First Gravedigger in Laurence Olivier&#x27;s 1948 film of &quot;Hamlet&quot;. In 1951 Holloway played the same role on the stage to the Hamlet of Alec Guinness. For Pathé News, he delivered the commentary for documentaries in a series called &quot;Time To Remember&quot;, where he narrated over old newsreels from significant dates in history from 1915 to 1942. Holloway also starred in a series of films for Ealing Studios, beginning with &quot;Champagne Charlie&quot; in 1944 alongside Tommy Trinder. After that he made &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; (1947) and &quot;Another Shore&quot; (1948). He next appeared in three of the most famous Ealing comedies, &quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot; (1949), &quot;The Lavender Hill Mob&quot; (1951) and &quot;The Titfield Thunderbolt&quot; (1953). His final film with the studio was &quot;Meet Mr. Lucifer&quot; (1953).

In 1948 Holloway conducted a six-month tour of Australia and New Zealand and supported by the band leader Billy Mayerl. He made his Australian début at The Tivoli Theatre, Melbourne, and recorded television appearances to publicise the forthcoming release of &quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot;. Holloway wrote the monologue &quot;Albert Down Under&quot; especially for the tour.

====1950s and 1960s stage and screen====

In 1954 Holloway joined the Old Vic theatre company to play Bottom in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, with Robert Helpmann as Oberon and Moira Shearer as Titania. After playing at the Edinburgh Festival, the Royal Shakespeare Company took the production to New York, where it played at the Metropolitan Opera House and then on tour of the US and Canada. The production was harshly reviewed by critics on both sides of the Atlantic, but Holloway made a strong impression. Holloway said of the experience: &quot;Out of the blue I was asked by the Royal Shakespeare Company to tour America with them, playing Bottom. ... From that American tour came the part of Alfred Doolittle in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; and from then on, well, just let&#x27;s say I was able to pick and choose my parts and that was very pleasant at my age.&quot; Holloway&#x27;s film career continued simultaneously with his stage work; one example was the 1956 comedy &quot;Jumping for Joy&quot;. American audiences became familiar with his earlier film roles when the films began to be broadcast on television in the 1950s.
In 1956 Holloway created the role of Alfred P. Doolittle in the original Broadway production of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. The librettist, Alan Jay Lerner, remembered in his memoirs that Holloway was his first choice for the role, even before it was written. Lerner&#x27;s only concern was whether, after so long away from the musical stage, Holloway still had his resonant singing voice. Holloway reassured him over a lunch at Claridge&#x27;s: Lerner recalled, &quot;He put down his knife and fork, threw back his head and unleashed a strong baritone note that resounded through the dining room, drowned out the string quartet and sent a few dozen people off to the osteopath to have their necks untwisted.&quot; Holloway had a long association with the show, appearing in the original 1956 Broadway production at the Mark Hellinger Theatre, the 1958 London version at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and the film version in 1964, which he undertook instead of the role of Admiral Boom in &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; that he had been offered the same year. In &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, Alistair Cooke wrote, &quot;Stanley Holloway distils into the body of Doolittle the taste and smell of every pub in England.&quot; Also in 1964, he appeared as Bellomy in the Hallmark Hall of Fame television production of &quot;The Fantasticks&quot;.
Looking back in 2004, Holloway&#x27;s biographer Eric Midwinter wrote, &quot;With his cockney authenticity, his splendid baritone voice, and his wealth of comedy experience, he made a great success of this role, and, as he said, it put him &#x27;bang on top of the heap, in demand&#x27; again at a time when, in his mid-sixties, his career was beginning to wane&quot;. His performances earned him a Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actor in a Musical and an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Following his success on Broadway, Holloway played Pooh-Bah in a 1960 US television Bell Telephone Hour production of &quot;The Mikado&quot;, produced by the veteran Gilbert and Sullivan performer Martyn Green. Holloway appeared with Groucho Marx and Helen Traubel of the Metropolitan Opera. His notable films around this time included &quot;&quot;Alive and Kicking&quot;&quot; in 1959, co-starring Sybil Thorndike and Kathleen Harrison, and &quot;No Love for Johnnie&quot; in 1961 opposite Peter Finch. In 1962, Holloway took part in a studio recording of &quot;Oliver!&quot; with Alma Cogan and Violet Carson, in which he played Fagin.

In 1962 Holloway played the role of an English butler called Higgins in a US television sitcom called &quot;Our Man Higgins&quot;. It ran for only a season. His son Julian also appeared in the series. In 1964 he again appeared on stage in Philadelphia in &quot;Cool Off!&quot;, a short-lived Faustian spoof. He returned to the US a few more times after that to take part in &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot; three times and &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot; twice. He also appeared in the 1965 war film &quot;In Harm&#x27;s Way&quot;, together with John Wayne and Kirk Douglas.

====Last years====

Holloway appeared for the first time in a major British television series in the BBC&#x27;s 1967 adaptation of P. G. Wodehouse&#x27;s &quot;Blandings Castle&quot; stories, playing Beach, the butler, to Ralph Richardson&#x27;s Lord Emsworth. His portrayal of Beach was received with critical reservation, but the series was a popular success. After &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, Holloway was able to get film roles in &quot;Mrs. Brown You&#x27;ve Got A Lovely Daughter&quot; (1968), which featured the 1960s British pop group Herman&#x27;s Hermits, &quot;The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, &quot;Flight of the Doves&quot; and &quot;Up the Front&quot;, all in the early 1970s. His final film was &quot;Journey into Fear&quot; (1974).

In 1970, Holloway began an association with the Shaw Festival in Canada, playing Burgess in &quot;Candida&quot;. He made what he considered his West End debut as a straight actor in &quot;Siege&quot; by David Ambrose at the Cambridge Theatre in 1972, co-starring with Alastair Sim and Michael Bryant. He returned to Shaw and Canada, playing the central character Walter/William in &quot;You Never Can Tell&quot; in 1973.

Holloway continued to perform until well into his eighties, touring Asia and Australia in 1977 together with Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and David Langton in &quot;The Pleasure of His Company&quot;, by Samuel A. Taylor and Cornelia Otis Skinner. He made his last appearance performing at the Royal Variety Performance at the London Palladium in 1980, aged 89.

Holloway died of a stroke at the Nightingale Nursing Home in Littlehampton, West Sussex, on 30 January 1982, aged 91. He is buried, along with his wife Violet, at St Mary the Virgin Church in East Preston.

===Personal life===
Holloway was married twice, first to Alice &quot;Queenie&quot; Foran. They met in June 1913 in Clacton, while he was performing in a concert party and she was selling charity flags on behalf of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. Queenie was orphaned at the age of 16, something that Holloway felt they had in common, as his mother had died that year and his father had earlier abandoned the family. He married Queenie in November 1913.

Holloway and Queenie had four children: Joan, born on Holloway&#x27;s 24th birthday in 1914, Patricia (b. 1920), John (1925–2013) and Mary (b. 1928). Upon the death of her mother, Queenie inherited some property in Southampton Row and relied on the rents from the property for her income. During the First World War, while Holloway was away fighting in France, Queenie began to have financial trouble, as the tenants failed to pay their rent. Out of desperation, she approached several loan sharks, incurring a large debt about which Holloway knew nothing. She also started to drink heavily as the pressures from the war and of supporting her daughter took their toll. On Holloway&#x27;s return from the war, the debt was paid off and they moved to Hampstead, West London. By the late 1920s, Holloway found himself in financial difficulties with the British tax authorities and was briefly declared bankrupt. In the 1930s, Holloway and Queenie moved to Bayswater and remained there until Queenie&#x27;s death in 1937 at the age of 45, from cirrhosis of the liver. Of the children from this first marriage, John worked as an engineer in an electrics company, and Mary worked for British Petroleum for many years.

On 2 January 1939, Holloway married the 25-year-old actress and former chorus dancer Violet Marion Lane (1913–1997), and they moved to Marylebone. Violet was born into a working-class family from Leeds. Although he was a client of the Aza Agency in London, Violet effectively managed Holloway&#x27;s career, and no project was taken on without her approval. In his autobiography, Holloway said of her, &quot;I suppose I am committing lawful bigamy. Not only is she my wife, lover, mother, cook, chauffeuse, private secretary, house keeper, hostess, electrician, business manager, critic, handy woman, she is also my best friend.&quot; Together, they had one son, Julian, whose brief relationship with Tessa Dahl produced a daughter, the model and author Sophie Dahl.

Holloway, Violet and Julian lived mainly in the tiny village of Penn, Buckinghamshire. Holloway also owned other properties including a flat in St John&#x27;s Wood in North West London, which he used when working in the capital, and a flat in Manhattan during the &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; Broadway years. The final years of his life were spent in Angmering, West Sussex, with Violet. Holloway forged close friendships with fellow performers including Leslie Henson, Gracie Fields, Maurice Chevalier, Laurence Olivier and Arthur Askey, who said of him, &quot;He was the nicest man I ever knew. He never had a wrong word to say about anyone. He was a great actor, a super mimic and a one-man walking comic show.&quot; While working in the US, Holloway numbered among his friends Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Burgess Meredith and Groucho Marx.

==Honours, memorials and books==

Holloway was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1960 New Year Honours for his services to entertainment. In 1978 he was honoured with a special award by the Variety Club of Great Britain.

There is a memorial plaque dedicated to Holloway in St Paul&#x27;s, Covent Garden, London, which is known as &quot;the actors&#x27; church&quot;. The plaque is next to a memorial to Gracie Fields. In 2009 English Heritage unveiled a blue plaque at 25 Albany Road, Manor Park, Essex, the house in which he was born in 1890. There is a building named after him at 2 Coolfin Road, Newham, London, called Stanley Holloway Court.

Holloway entitled his autobiography &quot;Wiv a Little Bit o&#x27; Luck&quot; after the song he performed in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. The book was ghostwritten by the writer and director Dick Richards and published in 1967. Holloway oversaw the publication of three volumes of the monologues by or associated with him: &quot;Monologues&quot; (1979); &quot;The Stanley Holloway Monologues&quot; (1980); and &quot;More Monologues&quot; (1981).

==Recordings==

Holloway had a 54-year recording career, beginning in the age of acoustic recording, and ending in the era of the stereophonic LP. He mainly recorded songs from musicals and revues, and he recited many monologues on various subjects. Most prominent among his recordings (aside from his participation in recordings of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;) are those of three series of monologues that he made at intervals throughout his career. They featured Sam Small, Albert Ramsbottom, and historical events such as the Battle of Hastings, Magna Carta and the Battle of Trafalgar. In all, his discography runs to 130 recordings, spanning the period 1924 to 1978. A review in &quot;The Gramophone&quot; of one of his 1957 albums containing recordings of his old &quot;concert party&quot; songs commented, &quot;what a fine voice he has and how well he can use it – diction, phrasing, range and the interpretative insight of the artist&quot;.

<text>Dame Barbara Windsor (born Barbara Ann Deeks; 6 August 193710 December 2020) was an English actress, known for her roles in the &quot;Carry On&quot; films and for playing Peggy Mitchell in the BBC One soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;. She joined the cast of &quot;EastEnders&quot; in 1994 and won the 1999 British Soap Award for Best Actress, before leaving the show in 2016 when her character was killed off.

Windsor began her career on stage in 1950 at the age of 13, and made her film debut as a schoolgirl in &quot;The Belles of St. Trinian&#x27;s&quot; (1954) while studying shipping management at Bow Technical College. She received a BAFTA Award nomination for the film &quot;Sparrows Can&#x27;t Sing&quot; (1963), and a Tony Award nomination for the 1964 Broadway production of &quot;Oh, What a Lovely War!&quot;. In 1972, she starred opposite Vanessa Redgrave in the West End production of &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;.

Between 1964 and 1974, she appeared in nine Carry On films, including &quot;Carry On Spying&quot; (1964), &quot;Carry On Doctor&quot; (1967), &quot;Carry On Camping&quot; (1969), &quot;Carry On Henry&quot; (1971), and &quot;Carry On Abroad&quot; (1972). She also co-presented the 1977 Carry On compilation &quot;That&#x27;s Carry On!&quot;. Windsor also starred in all four &quot;Carry On Christmas&quot; Thames TV specials, and appeared in both series of the 1975 ATV sitcom &quot;Carry On Laughing&quot;. Outside of Carry On, her other film roles included &quot;A Study in Terror&quot; (1965), &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; (1968), and as the voice of Mallymkun, the Dormouse in &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (2010) and &quot;Alice Through the Looking Glass&quot; (2016).

Windsor was made a Dame (DBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to charity and entertainment. She was awarded the British Soap Award for Outstanding Achievement in 2010, as well as the Freedom of the City of London in 2010.

==Early life==
Windsor was born in Shoreditch, London, in 1937 (though her birth was registered in Stepney), the only child of John Deeks, a bus driver, and his wife, Rose (&quot;née&quot; Ellis), a dressmaker. The family lived on Angela Street. Her maternal great-grandmother was the daughter of Irish immigrants who fled to Great Britain from Ireland between 1846 and 1851 in order to escape the Great Famine. 

In 1939, at the start of World War II, Windsor&#x27;s father was called up for the war, so Windsor and her mother went to live with her mother&#x27;s family in Yoakley Road, Stoke Newington, where Windsor attended St Mary&#x27;s Infants&#x27; School in nearby Lordship Road. 

Windsor&#x27;s mother initially refused to let her be evacuated, but conceded after one of Windsor&#x27;s school friends was killed by a bomb during an air raid. Aged six, Windsor was evacuated to Blackpool to live with a couple, but they attempted to sexually abuse her. A neighbour heard Windsor&#x27;s screams and alerted the authorities. The couple were arrested and were found to not be married, but to be brother and sister. 

Windsor moved in with a schoolfriend and her parents, although they struggled to cope with her loud behaviour. They sent Windsor to dancing school, which sparked her interest in performing, although one night after a class, Windsor found her friend&#x27;s father kissing another woman in a bus shelter. Humiliated by this, Windsor was sent back to London in 1944 along with a note from her dance teacher which read: &quot;Barbara is a born show-off who loves to perform.&quot;

Impressed by this, Windsor&#x27;s mother sent her to Madame Behenna&#x27;s Juvenile Jollities, a drama school at which she appeared in several charity concerts and pantomimes. After the war, she passed her 11-plus exams, gaining the top mark in North London, and earned a scholarship for a place at Our Lady&#x27;s Catholic High School, Stamford Hill, although she was expelled because she argued with the reverend mother after the latter refused to let Barbara have time off to appear in a pantomime. 

Windsor moved to the Aida Foster School, Golders Green, and took elocution lessons. When Windsor&#x27;s father came to watch a performance, she was ridiculed by the others as her father had begun working as a trolley bus conductor and had come in his uniform. Enraged, Windsor covered the girls in theatrical face powder, throwing more over the chaperone who tried to stop her. Despite this, Windsor was chosen to appear in the chorus of the successful musical &quot;Love From Judy&quot; in the West End in 1952, which ran for two years. Her stage name of &quot;Windsor&quot; was inspired by the Coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953. By the time she was 16, Windsor&#x27;s parents divorced, and she was unwillingly made to testify against her father in court. Awarded to her mother, following the divorce, Windsor&#x27;s father ceased all contact with Barbara, and would ignore her if he saw her in the street for many years afterwards.

==Career==
Windsor made her film debut as an uncredited extra in 1954 playing a schoolgirl in &quot;The Belles of St. Trinians&quot;; she followed this with several other uncredited roles until she appeared in &quot;Too Hot to Handle&quot; (1960) with Jayne Mansfield. According to Windsor, Mansfield demanded that she appear at the back of the scene they shared, as she was worried Windsor&#x27;s blonde hair and large chest would overshadow her own. After this, Windsor made her television debut when Johnny Brandon, with whom Windsor had starred in &quot;Love from Judy&quot;, asked her to appear in his television series &quot;Dreamer&#x27;s Highway&quot;. Windsor later appeared in musical shows &quot;Variety Parade&quot;, &quot;The Jack Jackson Show&quot;, and &quot;Six-Five Special&quot;, regularly singing with bands. She then became a regular cabaret act at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club in Soho, and went on to do the same at the Winston&#x27;s club alongside Danny La Rue and Amanda Barrie.

After joining Joan Littlewood&#x27;s Theatre Workshop at the Theatre Royal, Stratford East, she came to prominence in their 1959 stage production &quot;Fings Ain&#x27;t Wot They Used T&#x27;Be&quot; and Littlewood&#x27;s film &quot;Sparrows Can&#x27;t Sing&quot; (1963), achieving a BAFTA nomination for Best British Film Actress. She also appeared in the comedy films &quot;Crooks in Cloisters&quot; (1964) and &quot;San Ferry Ann&quot; (1965), the thriller film &quot;A Study in Terror&quot; (1965), the fantasy film &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; (1968) and Ken Russell&#x27;s musical film &quot;The Boy Friend&quot; (1971), and the TV sitcoms &quot;The Rag Trade&quot; and &quot;Wild, Wild Women&quot;.

===&quot;Carry On&quot;===

Windsor came to prominence with her portrayals of a &quot;good-time girl&quot; in nine Carry On films. Her first was &quot;Carry On Spying&quot; in 1964 and her final one was &quot;Carry On Dick&quot; in 1974. She also appeared in several &quot;Carry On...&quot; television and compilation specials between 1964 and 1977.

One of her best known scenes was in &quot;Carry On Camping&quot; (1969), where her bikini top flew off during outdoor aerobic exercises. In typical Carry On style, exposure is implied, but little is, in fact, seen.

From 1973 to 1975, she appeared with several of the Carry On team in the West End revue &quot;Carry On London!&quot;.

She was strongly identified with the Carry On films for many years, which restricted the roles she was offered later in her career.

===Theatre===
Windsor starred on Broadway in the Theatre Workshop&#x27;s &quot;Oh, What a Lovely War!&quot; and received a 1965 Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actress in a Musical. She also appeared in several stage productions including Lionel Bart&#x27;s musical flop &quot;Twang!!&quot; (1965) (directed by Joan Littlewood), &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; (1967), &quot;Come Spy with Me&quot; (1966–67) with Danny La Rue and in 30 pantomimes between 1950 and 2011.

In 1970, she landed the role of music hall legend Marie Lloyd in the musical-biopic &quot;Sing A Rude Song&quot;. In 1972, she appeared in the West End in Tony Richardson&#x27;s &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; with Vanessa Redgrave. In 1975, she toured the UK, New Zealand, and South Africa in her own show, &quot;Carry On Barbara!&quot;, and followed this with the role of Maria in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; at the Chichester Festival Theatre.

In 1981, she played sex-mad landlady Kath in Joe Orton&#x27;s black comedy &quot;Entertaining Mr Sloane&quot; at the Lyric Hammersmith, directed by her friend Kenneth Williams. She reprised the role for a national tour with the National Theatre in 1993 co-starring John Challis of &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; fame.

===&quot;EastEnders&quot;===
When &quot;EastEnders&quot; was launched in 1985, the producers said they would not cast well-known actors (although Wendy Richard was a rare exception). Windsor has said that she would have liked to have been part of the original cast. By 1994, this policy was relaxed, and Windsor accepted an offer to join &quot;EastEnders&quot;. She took over the role of Peggy Mitchell (who was previously a minor character played by Jo Warne in 1991). Peggy was the widowed mother of established key characters Phil and Grant Mitchell, and younger sister Samantha. For this role, she received the Best Actress award at the 1999 British Soap Awards, and a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2009 British Soap Awards.

A debilitating case of the Epstein–Barr virus forced a two-year absence from the role between 2003 and 2005, although Windsor was able to make a two-episode guest appearance in 2004. She rejoined the cast full-time in the summer of 2005. In October 2009, Windsor announced she was to leave her role as Peggy Mitchell, saying she wanted to spend more time with her husband. On 10 September 2010, her character left Albert Square after a fire destroyed the Queen Victoria pub, of which she was the owner.

In July 2013, it was announced that Windsor was to return for one episode, which aired on 20 September 2013. She again returned for a single episode on 25 September 2014, and made a further appearance for &quot;EastEnders&quot; 30th anniversary on 17 February 2015. In February 2015, Windsor, along with Pam St Clement (Pat Evans), took part in &quot;EastEnders: Back to Ours&quot; to celebrate 30 years of &quot;EastEnders&quot;. Windsor and St. Clement looked back on some of their characters&#x27; most dramatic moments.

In November 2015, Windsor secretly filmed a return to &quot;EastEnders&quot;, which was shown in January 2016. After this, the character was confirmed to be killed off later in the year. This was Windsor&#x27;s decision, as she said that she would always be open to a return to the show unless bosses decided to kill the character off. Her last appearance aired on BBC One on 17 May 2016. On 25 January 2022, by which time Windsor had died, an episode aired in which Peggy&#x27;s son Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) hears his mother&#x27;s voice giving him advice. The scene was made using archived audio from previous episodes.

==Later life==
Windsor hosted two series of the BBC documentary &quot;Disaster Masters&quot; in 2005. She provided the voice of the Dormouse in Walt Disney&#x27;s live-action adaptation of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (2010), directed by Tim Burton. Windsor appeared in the pantomime &quot;Dick Whittington&quot; at the Bristol Hippodrome over the Christmas/New Year period of 2010/2011. In September 2010, it was announced that Windsor would be fronting a TV campaign for online bingo site Jackpotjoy as the Queen of Bingo. She appeared as herself in one episode of &quot;Come Fly with Me&quot; in January 2011.
From 2011 onwards, she regularly did presenting work for BBC Radio 2 music and showbusiness history programmes, and also was a regular stand in for Elaine Paige on &quot;Elaine Paige on Sunday&quot;. She reprised her voice role of the Dormouse in the film &quot;Alice Through the Looking Glass&quot; (2016).

In 2016, Windsor was invited to switch on the Blackpool Illuminations 57 years after her co-star in the film &quot;Too Hot to Handle&quot;, Jayne Mansfield, had performed the task during a break in filming.

In May 2017, Windsor appeared in a cameo role as herself in BBC Television&#x27;s biopic about her life, &quot;Babs&quot;, written by &quot;EastEnders&quot; scriptwriter Tony Jordan. It showed Windsor in the 1990s as she prepared to go on stage, and recalled events from her life, including her childhood, marriage to gangster Ronnie Knight, and her roles in the Carry On films.

==Personal life==
Windsor was married three times, and had no children. She was married to:

# Ronnie Knight, (married 2 March 1964, divorced January 1985)
# Stephen Hollings, chef/restaurateur (married 12 April 1986 in Jamaica, divorced 1995)
# Scott Mitchell, former actor and recruitment consultant (married 8 April 2000)

Prior to her marriage to Knight, Windsor had a one-night stand with East End criminal Reggie Kray, and a longer relationship with his older brother Charlie Kray. During the time of making her later &quot;Carry On&quot; films, she had a well-publicised affair with her fellow actor and co-star Sid James, which lasted three years, until 1976. Windsor was initially uninterested in James, 24 years her senior, but later stated that she thought she would have sex with him once, and then he would leave her alone; however, James reportedly became obsessed with Windsor and suffocatingly possessive of her, to the extent that during the &quot;Carry On London!&quot; stage show, he shouted at Bernard Bresslaw because he had helped Windsor off the stage, the only reason being that Bresslaw had touched Windsor.

James, who, like Windsor, was also already married, would send her a dozen red roses with a note attached with the words &quot;Love Romeo&quot;, and even arranged to see her in Australia during her &quot;Carry On Barbara&quot; one-woman show, as he could not bear to be without her. He would also state his love for her in public and to Windsor&#x27;s friends, but after the affair began damaging Windsor&#x27;s mental health, she ended it. Devastated by her decision, James became depressed and started to drink whisky; he died soon afterwards from a heart attack.

Another of Windsor&#x27;s &quot;Carry On&quot; co-stars, Kenneth Williams, accompanied Windsor and Knight on their honeymoon, also bringing his mother and sister with him.

Windsor also dated Gary Crosby in the 1960s and had brief sexual encounters with Victor Mature, Anthony Newley, Ronnie Scott, James Booth, George Best and Maurice Gibb, the latter two while she was still married. In the late 1950s, Windsor became engaged to singer Cliff Lawrence, but he physically beat her. In her autobiography, &quot;All of Me&quot;, Windsor stated that she often turned up at Winston&#x27;s, the club where she sang, with a black eye, and detailed one occasion when Lawrence dragged her down the street by her hair. Windsor ended the relationship, and then started dating Knight. Windsor said that Lawrence would spy on her and Knight from telephone boxes, only leaving them alone after Knight threatened him.

In her autobiography, Windsor discussed her five abortions: three in her 20s, and the last at the age of 42. She said that she never wanted children as a result of her father rejecting her after her parents&#x27; divorce.

Windsor was best friends with fellow actress Anna Karen, whom she met while filming &quot;Carry On Camping&quot; and who later went on to play Peggy Mitchell&#x27;s sister Aunt Sal in &quot;EastEnders&quot; on and off for 20 years.

Windsor was friends with Amy Winehouse, and in 2012 became a patron of the Amy Winehouse Foundation. In 2014, Windsor unveiled a statue of Winehouse in Camden Market.

===Health===
In April 2014, Windsor was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. She chose not to make news of the condition public, but it was known to her friends and colleagues. On 10 May 2018, Windsor&#x27;s husband, Scott Mitchell, publicly revealed her condition. In January 2019, Mitchell and some of Windsor&#x27;s former co-stars from &quot;EastEnders&quot; announced that they would be running the London Marathon in aid of a dementia campaign. Mitchell said that Windsor&#x27;s health and mental state had been deteriorating, and she had moments when she no longer recognised him.

On Windsor&#x27;s 82nd birthday in August 2019, she and Mitchell became ambassadors for the Alzheimer&#x27;s Society. On the same day, Mitchell and Windsor appeared in a video for the charity, in which Windsor said, &quot;Unite with me, against dementia&quot;. Mitchell highlighted the problems many face with the disease, and urged viewers to sign a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, saying he &quot;urgently needs to address these challenges.&quot; In August 2020, BBC News reported that Windsor had been moved into a care home in London.

==Death==
Windsor died at Anita Dorfman House, a Jewish Care home in Stanmore, north London, on 10 December 2020, aged 83.

The next episode of &quot;EastEnders&quot;, broadcast on 11 December 2020, was dedicated to Windsor&#x27;s memory. As well as this, the 2017 biopic &quot;Babs&quot;, which documented Windsor&#x27;s life, was also broadcast. Among those who paid tributes to her were her &quot;EastEnders&quot; co-stars, entertainers, politicians including then Prime Minister Boris Johnson, former Prime Minister David Cameron, the then Leader of the Opposition Keir Starmer and members of the Royal family, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge – who described Windsor as &quot;a true national treasure ... a giant of the entertainment world&quot; – and Charles, Prince of Wales with his wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.

Windsor&#x27;s funeral took place on 8 January 2021. Her body was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium. The service was attended by Anna Karen, Christopher Biggins, Ross Kemp, David Walliams and Matt Lucas, amongst others, although numbers were limited due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Floral decorations on Windsor&#x27;s coffin spelled out the words &quot;The Dame&quot;, &quot;Saucy&quot; (Windsor&#x27;s catchphrase in the &quot;Carry On&quot; films) and &quot;The Queen Peggy&quot;. Windsor&#x27;s funeral programme featured the famous photo of her in &quot;Carry On Camping&quot;, a photo that she said &quot;will follow me right to the end&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Windsor was played by Samantha Spiro in Terry Johnson&#x27;s play &quot;Cleo, Camping, Emmanuelle and Dick&quot;, which premiered at the National Theatre in 1998. Rachel Clarke took over the role of Windsor in the touring production of the play in 2001. Spiro reprised the role in the subsequent TV film adaptation, &quot;Cor, Blimey!&quot; (2000). The latter also featured a cameo appearance from Windsor, playing herself.

In the 2006 BBC television film &quot;Kenneth Williams: Fantabulosa!&quot;, Windsor was again played by Rachel Clarke. Spiro reprised her role as Windsor in the TV biopic &quot;Babs&quot; in 2017, with Jaime Winstone and Honor Kneafsey playing younger versions of Windsor.

==Honours==
Windsor was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2000 New Year Honours, and in the same year she was the first person to be inducted into the newly created BBC Hall of Fame. In August 2010 she was given the Freedom of the City of London, and in November 2010 she was honoured by the City of Westminster at a tree-planting and plaque ceremony.

She was inducted into the Hackney Empire Walk of Fame on 25 May 2017.

Windsor was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to charity and entertainment.

In November 2014, she was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of East London.

<text>The Kansas River, also known as the Kaw, is a meandering river in northeastern Kansas in the United States. It is potentially the southwestern most part of the Missouri River drainage, which is sometimes in turn the northwesternmost portion of the extensive Mississippi River drainage. Its two names both come from the Kanza (Kaw) people who once inhabited the area; &quot;Kansas&quot; was one of the anglicizations of the French transcription &quot;Cansez&quot; () of the original &quot;kką:ze&quot;. The city of Kansas City, Missouri, was named for the river, as was later the state of Kansas.

The river valley averages in width, with the widest points being between Wamego and Rossville, where it is up to wide, then narrowing to or less in places below Eudora and De Soto. Much of the river&#x27;s watershed is dammed for flood control, but the Kansas River is generally free-flowing and has only minor obstructions, including diversion weirs and one low-impact hydroelectric dam.

==Course==
Beginning at the confluence of the Republican and Smoky Hill rivers, just east of aptly named Junction City (), the Kansas River flows some generally eastward to join the Missouri River at Kaw Point () in Kansas City, Kansas. Dropping on its journey seaward, the water in the Kansas River falls less than . The Kansas River valley is only long; the surplus length of the river is due to meandering across the floodplain. The river&#x27;s course roughly follows the maximum extent of a Pre-Illinoian glaciation, and the river likely began as a path of glacial meltwater drainage.

==Drainage==
The Kansas drains of land in Kansas (almost all of the northern half), along with in Nebraska and in Colorado, making a total of just over . When including the Republican River and its headwater tributaries, the Kansas River system has a length of , making it the 21st longest river system in the United States. Its highest headwaters are at about and extend nearly to Limon, Colorado. Much of the drainage of the river lies within the Great Plains, but the river itself exists entirely within the Mid-Continent Region. The majority of the rest of the state is drained by the Arkansas (and its tributaries, the Neosho, Cimarron, and Verdigris, all three of which drain into the Arkansas in Oklahoma). A portion of central-eastern Kansas is drained by the Marais des Cygnes River, which flows into Missouri to meet the Missouri River. A small area in the extreme northeast part of the state drains directly into the Missouri. In the Kansas City metro area, some streams drain east into the Blue River tributary of the Missouri.

==Geology==
The Kansas River flows through what is known as the Stable Interior region. Since this region is near the center of the North American Plate, it has not experienced any extensive geologic faulting, folding, or mountain building in recent geologic time. From the confluence at Junction City, the river flows through limestone, shale, mudstone, and occasional sandstone strata that, except for diagenesis, remain largely undisturbed since deposition in shallow Carboniferous and Permian seas. The age of the rock exposed by the river becomes progressively older as the river moves downstream for two main reasons. First, downstream areas experience more erosion from increased flow, and second because the slight uplift of the Ozark dome to the southeast caused the strata in Kansas to dip very slightly to the west. The Smoky Hill River and Republican River tributaries reach far to the west into the Cretaceous deposits of the Western Interior Seaway and the Neogene Period deposits of material from the uplift of the Rocky Mountains, which created the Ogallala Formation.

All of the rocks in the eastern Kansas valley are sedimentary, ranging from Late Pennsylvanian (300 million years ago) through the Permian, with three notable exceptions from the Quaternary Period. The first is river sand and gravel deposits, which have been carried in largely from erosion of the Ogallala and Cretaceous rocks by the western extents of the Kansas River tributaries. Second, the retreat of the Kansan glaciation left behind a combination of ice- and meltwater-deposited sediments known as drifta, a poorly sorted mixture of clay, sand, gravel, and even large boulders that cover parts the Kansas River basin from the Big Blue River and eastward. The third is loess, a fine silt that may have originally been deposited by the melting water of the receding glaciers, then redeposited by the wind. The thickest loess deposits can be found in the northwest and north-central part of the Kansas River basin from southern Nebraska into northwest Kansas, as well as near the river&#x27;s mouth.

==History==

The first map showing the Kansas River is French cartographer Guillaume de L&#x27;Isle&#x27;s &quot;Carte de la Louisiane,&quot; which was drawn about 1718. On it, the &quot;Grande Riviere des Cansez&quot; flows into the Missouri River at about the 39th parallel. This map, with virtually no changes except for the translation of French into English, was subsequently published by John Senex, a London cartographer and engraver, in 1721.

From June 26 through 29, 1804, the Lewis and Clark Expedition camped at Kaw Point at the Kansas River&#x27;s mouth. They praised the scenery in their accounts and noted the area would be a good location for a fort.

In August 1819, Maj. Stephen H. Long steered the first steamer into the Kansas River with his 30-ton boat &quot;Western Engineer&quot;. He made it scarcely a mile up the river before turning back, citing mud bars from the recent floods.

The mouth of the Kansas River in the West Bottoms area of Kansas City (at a longitude of 94 degrees 36 minutes West) was the basis for Missouri&#x27;s western boundary from Iowa to Arkansas when it became a state in 1821 (Kansas entered the Union in 1861.) South of the Missouri River, that longitude still remains the boundary between Kansas and Missouri. North of the Missouri River, the state of Missouri extended its boundary further to the west in 1836 with the Platte Purchase. The river has moved slightly since this designation, but the state boundary has remained the same. This line is known as the Osage Boundary.

From the 1840s through the early 1870s, the southern ridgelines of the lower section of the Kansas River were the beginnings of the Oregon, California, and Santa Fe trails as they left Kansas City.

Beginning in 1854, steamboats operated regularly from Kansas City to Lawrence and Topeka, and sometimes as far as Manhattan, Junction City, and Fort Riley. This traffic continued through the territorial period and the early years of statehood, falling off rapidly about 1860. The last steamer to travel the Kansas was the Alexander Majors, which was chartered in 1866 to run between Kansas City and Lawrence until the railroad bridge at the mouth of the river, which had been destroyed by floods, could be rebuilt. This traffic into statehood gave the Kansas legal status as a navigable stream in the eyes of the Federal government. In the 1860s, the country&#x27;s goods were increasingly transported by the extensive and comparatively efficient railroad system.

On February 25, 1864, the state legislature declared the Kansas River nonnavigable, allowing railroad and bridge companies to build bridges and dams without restriction. The first train to operate in Kansas south of the Kansas River did so by crossing the river in Lawrence on November 1, 1867. This law remained in effect until 1913, when, after it had been characterized as &quot;a crime against the public welfare of Kansas&quot;, it was finally repealed and the river&#x27;s status was restored to a navigable stream. The status has not since changed, though modern commercial navigation on the river is largely confined to dredging.

==Recreation==
Recreation along the Kansas River includes fishing, canoeing and kayaking, and rowing. There are 18 public access points along the river. The Friends of the Kaw organizes many float trips down the river each year (as well as cleanup efforts), and the Lawrence KOA rents canoes for self-guided trips. At least two rowing teams regularly use the river: The University of Kansas rowing team uses the pool above the Bowersock Dam for their training, and the Kansas City Boat Club as well as University of Missouri-Kansas City rows in the final stretches of the river, near its mouth and the connection to the Missouri River.

==River modifications==
===On the river===
* Kansas City: A few yards downstream from the I-435 bridge, a weir diverts water to an intake for WaterOne. Portage access is on the left bank.
* Lawrence: Bowersock Dam is the largest obstruction on the river. It serves not only to create a standing pool for one of Lawrence&#x27;s municipal water intakes (the other is at Clinton Lake), but also to create a head for the Bowersock Mills &amp; Power Company. At this site, the Bowersock Mills &amp; Power Company operates the only hydroelectric power station in Kansas: a 2.5-megawatt low-impact hydropower facility. The University of Kansas&#x27;s rowing team uses the pool for its exercises. Portage access is on the left bank.
* Tecumseh: An easily navigable low head weir diverts water to the Tecumseh power plant, just downstream from Topeka.
* Topeka: A Topeka water department dam diverts water to the right bank for a municipal water intake. Portage access is on the left bank.

===Within the watershed===
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Land Management operate many reservoirs within the watershed of the Kansas River for local and Mississippi River flood control, with secondary recreational uses.

==In popular culture==
The river is featured prominently in the 2017 documentary &quot;When Kings Reigned&quot;. The film talks about life along the Kansas River in the late 1800s, and the trials that the fishermen on the river faced.

Étienne de Veniard Sieur de Bourgmont&#x27;s expedition into the Kansas River valley and the history of the Kanza people in their villages along the river is discussed in &quot;The Last Wild Places of Kansas&quot;, a book by George Frazier.

In Sara Paretsky&#x27;s 2017 detective novel &quot;Fallout&quot;, in which Paretsky&#x27;s Chicago-based private detective V.I. Warshawski carries out an investigation in Lawrence, Kansas, a Lawrence resident tells her: &quot;You should always say &#x27;The Kaw&#x27; when you speak of our river. Only strangers and Google Maps call it &#x27;The Kansas River&#x27;&quot;(Ch. 32).

Johnny Kaw is a fictional Kansas settler created in a series of tall tale publications started in 1955 — one of his fictional feats was to have dug the Kansas River Valley.

The &quot;Kaw River&quot; is mentioned as a location in the western series Wagon Train, in the opening scene of &quot;The Tom Tuckett Story&quot; episode (March 2, 1960).

<text>Irene Joan Marion Sims (9 May 1930 – 27 June 2001) was an English actress, best remembered for her roles in the &quot;Carry On&quot; franchise, appearing in 24 of the films (the most for any actress).

On television, she is known for playing Gran in &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot; (1967–1975), Madge Kettlewell in &quot;Sykes&quot; (1972–1978), Mrs Bloomsbury-Barton in Worzel Gummidge (1979–1981), an eccentric youth hostel owner in Victoria Wood (1990), Mrs Wembley, the cook with a liking for sherry, in &quot;On the Up&quot; (1990–1992), and Madge Hardcastle in &quot;As Time Goes By&quot; (1994–1998).

==Early life and education==
Sims was born on 9 May 1930, the only child of John Henry Sims (1888–1964), Station Master of Laindon railway station in Essex, and his wife Gladys Marie Sims, &quot;née&quot; Ladbrook (1896–1981). Sims&#x27;s early interest in being an actress came from living at the railway station. She would often put on performances for waiting passengers. She decided that she wanted to pursue show business during her teens, and soon became a familiar face in a growing number of amateur productions locally. One of her first stage appearances was as Miranda Bute in the Langdon Players production of Esther McCracken&#x27;s comedy &quot;Quiet Wedding&quot; in May 1946.

In 1946, Sims first applied to Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), but her audition was unsuccessful. Her first audition included a rendition of Winnie the Pooh. She did succeed in being admitted to PARADA, the academy&#x27;s preparatory school, and after her successful fourth attempt, she joined and was trained at RADA, graduating in 1950 at the age of 19. One of her first stage performances was in the 1951 pantomime, &quot;The Happy Ha&#x27;penny&quot;, opposite Stanley Baxter at Glasgow&#x27;s Citizens Theatre.

==Career==
===Early work===
Sims made her first film appearance in &quot;Will Any Gentleman?&quot; with George Cole in 1953, closely followed by &quot;Trouble in Store&quot; with Norman Wisdom. In 1954, she appeared as Miss Dawn in &quot;The Belles of St. Trinian&#x27;s&quot;, and made an appearance in &quot;Doctor in the House,&quot; opposite Dirk Bogarde as the sexually repressed Nurse Rigor Mortis. Sims became a regular in the &quot;Doctor&quot; series, which was produced by Betty E. Box, and was hence spotted by Box&#x27;s husband Peter Rogers.
She had a small part in the 1957 film &quot;Carry On Admiral&quot;, unrelated to the later &quot;Carry On&quot; series and with no other cast members in common with the series.

===&quot;Carry On&quot; films===
In 1958, Sims received a script from Peter Rogers; it was for &quot;Carry On Nurse&quot;. The film &quot;Carry On Sergeant&quot; had been a huge success at the box office and in the autumn of that year, Rogers and director Gerald Thomas began planning a follow-up.

She first starred in &quot;Carry On Nurse&quot;, then &quot;Carry On Teacher&quot;, followed by &quot;Carry On Constable&quot; and &quot;Carry On Regardless&quot;, and this sealed her future as a regular &quot;Carry On&quot; performer. Following a bout of ill health, Dilys Laye had to be brought in to take her place in &quot;Carry On Cruising&quot; at very short notice; however, Sims rejoined the team with &quot;Carry On Cleo&quot;.

===Later work===
After the &quot;Carry On&quot; series ended in 1978, Sims continued to work on television. She appeared opposite Katharine Hepburn and Laurence Olivier in the award-winning 1975 television film &quot;Love Among the Ruins&quot; and had a recurring role as Gran in the BBC comedy series &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot; (though she was only in her late thirties when she assumed the role).

From 1979 to 1980, she played the recurring character Mrs Bloomsbury-Barton in &quot;Worzel Gummidge&quot; for Southern Television. During 1986 and 1987, Sims starred as Annie Begley alongside Angela Thorne in the Yorkshire Television sitcom &quot;Farrington of the F.O.&quot; Also in 1986, Sims appeared in the long-running BBC science fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in the four episodes of &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord: The Mysterious Planet&quot; as Katryca. She also played Miss Murgatroyd in the &quot;Miss Marple&quot; adaptation &quot;A Murder is Announced&quot; (1985).

In 1989, she appeared as a medium in the video for Morrissey&#x27;s &quot;Ouija Board, Ouija Board&quot;.

She played Mrs Wembley in the BBC comedy series &quot;On the Up&quot;, which starred Dennis Waterman and ran from 1990 to 1992. From 1994, she played Madge Hardcastle, drum-playing wife to Rocky Hardcastle played by Frank Middlemass, and stepmother of Geoffrey Palmer&#x27;s character Lionel in &quot;As Time Goes By&quot;. She also played Betsey Prig in a star-studded adaptation of Dickens&#x27; &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot; (1994) and Lady Fox-Custard in &quot;Simon and the Witch&quot;.

==Music career==
During 1963, Sims made several recordings. &quot;Hurry Up Gran&quot; / &quot;Oh Not Again Ken&quot; was issued as a single, followed by &quot;Spring Song&quot; / &quot;Men&quot;. Both were produced by George Martin for the Parlophone label but neither single made an impact on the UK Singles Chart. This did not deter her from releasing a third and final single during 1967, &quot;Sweet Lovely Whatsisname&quot; / &quot;The Lass With the Delicate Hair&quot;. Again it failed to chart, and as a result the singles are now quite rare. As of 2009, both &quot;Spring Song&quot; and &quot;Men&quot; are available for the first time through iTunes and other download services, as well as on CD as part of re-issues of the comedy compilation albums &quot;Oh! What a Carry On!&quot; and &quot;Laugh A Minute&quot;. Sims also featured on an original cast recording of &quot;The Lord Chamberlain Regrets&quot; in 1961, as well as &quot;The Water Gypsies&quot;.

==Personal life==

Sims, like her fellow &quot;Carry On&quot; star Kenneth Williams, never married. Williams, who was homosexual, did, however, propose a marriage of convenience to her, which she promptly declined. From 1958, she lived for three years with fellow actor Tony Baird but, every time her parents visited, she asked Baird to remove all of his belongings from their London flat.

After she told her mother on a visit that she was living with Baird, her father wrote her a stern letter, condemning the relationship. Sims replied, telling her parents that they had to come to terms with Tony being an extremely important part of her life. For the next six months she had no contact with her parents. Sims was a devoted daughter and found the separation from her parents difficult.

The relationship with Baird began to flounder, Sims said, due to her success and Tony Baird&#x27;s failure as an actor. Sims writes Had house husbands been in vogue in those days we&#x27;d have made an excellent couple, since Tony was not very successful as an actor and I soon became the main breadwinner. If we had been able to accept that I would go out and earn the money and he would concentrate on running the home, things might have turned out better... For three years I was besotted with this loveable reprobate, but then the icing on the cake began to chip off and the love started to wear thin. I was virtually keeping him and the friction of the situation was getting harder to bear. Of the break-up, which was finally triggered by Sims returning from a tour to find Baird had not done any washing or housework, she wrote &quot;I could tell that he was genuinely heartbroken, and so was I, but I had to do it for my own survival.&quot;

Following this came a relationship with John Walters whom Sims had known for a long time. He had been assistant stage manager for the revue &quot;High Spirits&quot;, in which she appeared. They had had an &#x27;innocent&#x27; romance at the time, but they embarked on a more serious relationship after Sims&#x27;s break-up with Baird. However, Sims never felt it would be a long-term relationship: John was a much moodier character than Tony. During what she described as the &#x27;one broody phase of my life&#x27;, they discussed marriage and children, but it came to nothing and the relationship, the last serious one of Sims&#x27;s life, ended after around two years of living together.

===Health===

Sims had depression for many of her later years. This was worsened by the deaths of her agent Peter Eade, her best friend Hattie Jacques and her mother, all within a two-year period, after which she fell into alcoholism. Sims suffered from Bell&#x27;s palsy in 1999 and fractured her hip in 2000, but recovered well. However, her alcoholism was beginning to dominate life in her rented Kensington flat, and she described herself as &quot;the queen of puddings&quot;. After assessment by a doctor, she was offered a place in a rehabilitation centre, but declined.

===&quot;High Spirits&quot;===

The tone of Sims&#x27;s 2000 autobiography &quot;High Spirits&quot; is revealing (though not sensationalist), frank and sometimes mordant:

&quot;High Spirits&quot; concluded with Sims in reflective and rueful mood. Having been disappointed to miss out on the part in a BBC adaptation of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, she is somewhat crestfallen to discover that there are only two entries on her &#x27;Trivia&#x27; page on IMDb. It ends:

==Death==
Sims was admitted to hospital in November 2000, and complications of a routine operation caused her to slip into a coma. Her lifelong friend and stand-in, Norah Holland spoke of the doctors&#x27; amazement at her strength and courage throughout her final illness.

On 27 June 2001, ten minutes before she died, Holland spoke to her gently about Kenneth Williams, Hattie Jacques and their time on the &quot;Carry On&quot; films. Sims died from liver failure and diverticulitis, with diabetes and COPD cited as contributory factors. She was cremated at Putney Vale Crematorium, and her ashes scattered in the grounds there.

Her authorised biography, &quot;Too Happy A Face&quot;, by Andrew Ross, was published in 2014.

==In popular culture==
Sims was played by Chrissie Cotterill in the 2000 television film, &quot;Cor, Blimey!&quot;, an adaptation of Terry Johnson&#x27;s play &quot;Cleo, Camping, Emmanuelle and Dick&quot;, and by Beatie Edney in the 2006 television film &quot;Kenneth Williams: Fantabulosa!&quot;

<doc id="158996" wikidata="Q207821" url="?curid=158996" title="Hurdy-gurdy">
<text>The hurdy-gurdy is a string instrument that produces sound by a hand-turned crank, rosined wheel rubbing against the strings. The wheel functions much like a violin (or nyckelharpa) bow, and single notes played on the instrument sound similar to those of a violin. Melodies are played on a keyboard that presses &quot;tangents&quot;—small wedges, typically made of wood or metal—against one or more of the strings to change their pitch. Like most other acoustic stringed instruments, it has a sound board and hollow cavity to make the vibration of the strings audible.

Most hurdy-gurdies have multiple drone strings, which give a constant pitch accompaniment to the melody, resulting in a sound similar to that of bagpipes. For this reason, the hurdy-gurdy is often used interchangeably or along with bagpipes. It is mostly used in Occitan, Aragonese, Cajun French, Asturian, Cantabrian, Galician, Hungarian, and Slavic folk music. It can also be seen in early music settings such as medieval, renaissance or baroque music. One or more of the gut strings called &#x27;trompette&#x27; usually passes over a buzzing bridge called the &#x27;chien&#x27; that can be made to produce a distinctive percussive buzzing sound as the player turns the wheel.

== History ==
The hurdy-gurdy is generally thought to have originated from fiddles in either Europe or the Middle East (e.g., the rebab instrument) before the eleventh century A.D. The first recorded reference to fiddles in Europe was in the 9th century by the Persian geographer Ibn Khurradadhbih (d. 911) describing the lira (&quot;lūrā&quot;) as a typical instrument within the Byzantine Empire. One of the earliest forms of the hurdy-gurdy was the organistrum, a large instrument with a guitar-shaped body and a long neck in which the keys were set (covering one diatonic octave). The organistrum had a single melody string and two drone strings, which ran over a common bridge, and a relatively small wheel. Due to its size, the organistrum was played by two people, one of whom turned the crank while the other pulled the keys upward. Pulling keys upward is cumbersome, so only slow tunes could be played on the organistrum.

The pitches on the organistrum were set according to Pythagorean temperament and the instrument was primarily used in monastic and church settings to accompany choral music. Abbot Odo of Cluny (died 942) is supposed to have written a short description of the construction of the organistrum entitled &quot;Quomodo organistrum construatur&quot; (How the Organistrum Is Made), known through a much later copy, but its authenticity is very doubtful. Another 10th-century treatise thought to have mentioned an instrument like a hurdy-gurdy is an Arabic musical compendium written by Al Zirikli. One of the earliest visual depictions of the organistrum is from the twelfth-century &quot;Pórtico da Gloria&quot; (Portal of Glory) on the cathedral at Santiago de Compostela, Galicia, Spain: it has a carving of two musicians playing an organistrum.

Later, the &quot;organistrum&quot; was made smaller to let a single player both turn the crank and work the keys. The &quot;solo organistrum&quot; was known from Spain and France, but was largely replaced by an improved variant, known as a &quot;symphonia&quot;, in the 13th century, a small box-shaped version of the hurdy-gurdy with three strings and a diatonic keyboard. At about the same time, a new form of key pressed from beneath was developed. These keys were much more practical for faster music and easier to handle; eventually they completely replaced keys pulled up from above. Medieval depictions of the &quot;symphonia&quot; show both types of keys.

During the Renaissance, the hurdy-gurdy was a very popular instrument (along with the bagpipe) and the characteristic form had a short neck and a boxy body with a curved tail end. It was around this time that &quot;buzzing bridges&quot; first appeared in illustrations. The buzzing bridge (commonly called the &quot;dog&quot;) is an asymmetrical bridge that rests under a drone string on the sound board. When the wheel is accelerated, one foot of the bridge lifts from the soundboard and vibrates, creating a buzzing sound. The buzzing bridge is thought to have been borrowed from the &quot;tromba marina&quot; (monochord), a bowed string instrument.

During the late Renaissance, two characteristic shapes of hurdy-gurdies developed. The first was guitar-shaped and the second had a rounded lute-type body made of staves. The lute-like body is especially characteristic of French instruments.

By the end of the 17th century changing musical tastes demanded greater polyphonic capabilities than the hurdy-gurdy could offer and pushed the instrument to the lowest social classes; as a result it acquired names like the German &quot;Bauernleier&quot; &#x27;peasant&#x27;s lyre&#x27; and &quot;Bettlerleier&quot; &#x27;beggar&#x27;s lyre&#x27;. During the 18th century, however, French Rococo tastes for rustic diversions brought the hurdy-gurdy back to the attention of the upper classes, where it acquired tremendous popularity among the nobility, with famous composers writing works for the hurdy-gurdy. The most famous of these is Nicolas Chédeville&#x27;s &quot;Il pastor Fido&quot;, published under the name Antonio Vivaldi. At this time the most common style of hurdy-gurdy developed, the six-string &quot;vielle à roue&quot;. This instrument has two melody strings and four drones. The drone strings are tuned so that by turning them on or off, the instrument can be played in multiple keys (e.g., C and G, or G and D).

During this time the hurdy-gurdy also spread further to Central Europe, where further variations developed in western Slavic countries, German-speaking areas and Hungary (see the list of types below for more information on them). Most types of hurdy-gurdy were essentially extinct by the early twentieth century, but a few have survived. The best-known are the French &quot;vielle à roue&quot;, the Hungarian &quot;tekerőlant&quot;, and the Spanish &quot;zanfoña&quot;. In Ukraine, a variety called the &quot;lira&quot; was widely used by blind street musicians, most of whom were purged by Stalin in the 1930s (see Persecuted bandurists).

The hurdy-gurdy tradition is well-developed particularly in Hungary, Poland, Belarus, Southeastern France and Ukraine. In Ukraine, it is known as the lira or relia. It was and still is played by professional, often blind, itinerant musicians known as lirnyky. Their repertoire has mostly para-religious themes. Most of it originated in the Baroque period. In Eastern Ukraine, the repertoire includes unique historic epics known as &quot;dumy&quot; and folk dances.

Lirnyky were categorised as beggars by the Russian authorities and fell under harsh repressive measures if they were caught performing in the streets of major cities until 1902, when the authorities were asked by ethnographers attending the 12th All-Russian Archaeological conference to stop persecuting them.

The hurdy-gurdy is the instrument played by &quot;Der Leiermann&quot;, the street musician portrayed in the last, melancholy song of Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Winterreise&quot;. It is also featured and played prominently in the film &quot;Captains Courageous&quot; (1937) as the instrument of the character Manuel, played by Spencer Tracy.

The instrument came into a new public consciousness when Donovan released his hit pop song &quot;Hurdy Gurdy Man&quot; in 1968. Although the song does not use a hurdy-gurdy, the repeated reference to the instrument in the song&#x27;s lyrics sparked curiosity and interest among young people, eventually resulting in an annual hurdy-gurdy music festival in the Olympic Peninsula area of the state of Washington each September.
Today, the tradition has resurfaced. Revivals have been underway for many years as well in Austria, Belarus, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, and Ukraine. As the instrument has been revived, musicians have used it in a variety of styles of music (see the list of recordings that use hurdy-gurdy), including contemporary forms not typically associated with it.

== Terminology ==

A person who plays the hurdy-gurdy is called a hurdy-gurdist, or (particularly for players of French instruments) viellist.

In France, a player is called &quot;un sonneur de vielle&quot; (literally &quot;a sounder of vielle&quot;), &quot;un vielleux&quot; or &quot;un vielleur&quot;.

Because of the prominence of the French tradition, many instrument and performance terms used in English are commonly taken from the French, and players generally need to know these terms to read relevant literature. Such common terms include:

* &quot;Trompette&quot;: the highest-pitched drone string that features the buzzing bridge
* &quot;Mouche&quot;: the drone string pitched a fourth or fifth below the trompette
* &quot;Petit bourdon&quot;: the drone string pitched an octave below the trompette
* &quot;Gros bourdon&quot;: the drone string pitched an octave below the mouche
* &quot;Chanterelle(s)&quot;: melody string(s), also called &quot;chanters&quot; or &quot;chanter strings&quot; in English
* &quot;Chien&quot;: (literally &quot;dog&quot;), the buzzing bridge
* &quot;Tirant&quot;: a small peg set in the instrument&#x27;s tailpiece that is used to control the sensitivity of the buzzing bridge

== Nomenclature ==

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the mid 18th century origin of the term &quot;hurdy-gurdy&quot; is onomatopoeic in origin, after the repetitive warble in pitch that characterizes instruments with solid wooden wheels that have warped due to changes in humidity or after the sound of the buzzing-bridge. Alternately, the term is thought to come from the Scottish and northern English term for uproar or disorder, &quot;hirdy-girdy&quot; or from &quot;hurly-burly&quot;, an old English term for noise or commotion. The instrument is sometimes more descriptively called a &quot;wheel fiddle&quot; in English, but this term is rarely used among players of the instrument. Another possible derivation is from the Hungarian &quot;hegedűs&quot; (Slovenian variant &quot;hrgadus&quot;) meaning a fiddle.

In France, the instrument is known as &quot;vielle à roue&quot; (wheel fiddle) or simply &quot;vielle&quot; (even though there is another instrument with this name), while in the French-speaking regions of Belgium it is also known in local dialects as &quot;vièrlerète/vièrlète&quot; or &quot;tiesse di dj&#x27;va&quot; (&#x27;horse&#x27;s head&#x27;). The Flemings and the Dutch call it a &quot;draailier&quot;, which is similar to its German name, &quot;Drehleier&quot;. An alternate German name, &quot;Bauernleier&quot;, means &quot;peasant&#x27;s lyre&quot;. In Italy, it is called the &quot;ghironda&quot; or &quot;lira tedesca&quot; while in Spain, it is a &quot;zanfona&quot; in Galicia, &quot;zanfoña&quot; in Zamora, &quot;rabil&quot; in Asturias and &quot;viola de roda&quot; in Catalonia. In the Basque language, it is known as a &quot;zarrabete&quot;. In Portugal, it is called &quot;sanfona&quot;.

The Hungarian name &quot;tekerőlant&quot; and the alternative &quot;forgólant&quot; both mean &quot;turning lute&quot;. Another Hungarian name for the instrument is &quot;nyenyere&quot;, which is thought to be an onomatopoeic reference to the repetitive warble produced by a wheel that is not even. This term was considered derogatory in the Hungarian lowlands, but was the normal term for the instrument on Csepel island directly south of Budapest. The equivalent names &quot;ninera&quot; and &quot;niněra&quot; are used in Slovakia and the Czech Republic respectively. In Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian the instrument is called &quot;wheel lyre&quot; (&quot;колёсная лира&quot;, &quot;колісна ліра&quot;, &quot;колавая ліра&quot;). In Poland it is called &quot;cranked lyre&quot; (lira korbowa).

&quot;Leier&quot;, &quot;lant&quot;, and related terms today are generally used to refer to members of the lute or lyre family, but historically had a broader range of meaning and were used for many types of stringed instruments.

In the eighteenth century, the term &quot;hurdy-gurdy&quot; was also applied to a small, portable barrel organ or street organ (a cranked box instrument with a number of organ pipes, a bellows and a barrel with pins that rotated and programmed the tunes) that was frequently played by poor buskers, street musicians specifically called organ grinders. Such organs require only the turning of the crank to play; the music is coded by pinned barrels, perforated paper rolls, and, more recently, by electronic modules. The French call these organs &quot;Orgue de Barbarie&quot; (&quot;Barbary organ&quot;), while the Germans and Dutch say &quot;Drehorgel&quot; and &quot;draaiorgel&quot; (&quot;turned organ&quot;), instead of &quot;Drehleier&quot; (&quot;turning lyre&quot;). In Czech, the organ is called &quot;flašinet&quot;.

== Design ==

=== Shape ===
In her overview of the instrument&#x27;s history, Palmer recorded twenty-three different forms, and there is still no standardized design today.

The six-stringed French &quot;vielle à roue&quot; is the best-known and most common sort. A number of regional forms developed, but outside France the instrument was considered a folk instrument and there were no schools of construction that could have determined a standard form.

There are two primary body styles for contemporary instruments: guitar-bodied and lute-backed. Both forms are found in French-speaking areas, while guitar-bodied instruments are the general form elsewhere. The box form &quot;symphonia&quot; is also commonly found among players of early music and historical re-enactors.

=== Strings ===
Historically, strings were made of gut, which is still a preferred material today and modern instruments are mounted with violin (D or A) and cello (A, G, C) strings. However, metal-wound strings have become common in the twentieth century, especially for the heavier drone strings or for lower melody strings if octave tuning is used. Nylon is also sometimes used, but is disliked by many players. Some instruments also have optional sympathetic strings, generally guitar or banjo B strings.

The drone strings produce steady sounds at fixed pitches. The melody string(s) (French &quot;chanterelle(s)&quot;, Hungarian &quot;dallamhúr(ok)&quot;) are stopped with tangents attached to keys that change the vibration length of the string, much as a guitarist uses his or her fingers on the fretboard of a guitar. In the earliest hurdy-gurdies these keys were arranged to provide a Pythagorean temperament, but in later instruments the tunings have varied widely, with equal temperament most common because it allows easier blending with other instruments. However, because the tangents can be adjusted to tune individual notes, it is possible to tune hurdy-gurdies to almost any temperament as needed. Most contemporary hurdy-gurdies have 24 keys that cover a range of two chromatic octaves.

To achieve proper intonation and sound quality, each string of a hurdy-gurdy must be wrapped with cotton or similar fibers. The cotton on melody strings tends to be quite light, while drone strings have heavier cotton. Improper cottoning results in a raspy tone, especially at higher pitches. In addition, individual strings (in particular the melody strings) often have to have their height above the wheel surface adjusted by having small pieces of paper placed between the strings and the bridge, a process called &quot;shimming&quot;. Shimming and cottoning are connected processes since either one can affect the geometry of the instrument&#x27;s strings.

=== Buzzing bridge ===


In some types of hurdy-gurdy, notably the French &quot;vielle à roue&quot; (&#x27;fiddle with a wheel&#x27;) and the Hungarian &quot;tekerőlant&quot; (&quot;tekerő&quot; for short), makers have added a buzzing bridge—called a &quot;chien&quot; (French for dog) or &quot;recsegő&quot; (Hungarian for &quot;buzzer&quot;)—on one drone string. Modern makers have increased the number of buzzing bridges on French-style instruments to as many as four. This mechanism consists of a loose bridge under a drone string. The tail of the buzzing bridge is inserted into a narrow vertical slot (or held by a peg in Hungarian instruments) that holds the buzzing bridge in place (and also serves as a bridge for additional drone strings on some instruments).

The free end of the dog (called the &quot;hammer&quot;) rests on the soundboard of the hurdy-gurdy and is more or less free to vibrate. When the wheel is turned regularly and not too fast the pressure on the string (called the &quot;trompette&quot; on French instruments) holds the bridge in place, sounding a drone. When the crank is struck, the hammer lifts up suddenly and vibrates against the soundboard, producing a characteristic rhythmic buzz that is used as an articulation or to provide percussive effect, especially in dance pieces.

On French-style instruments, the sensitivity of the buzzing bridge can be altered by turning a peg called a &quot;tirant&quot; in the tailpiece of the instrument that is connected by a wire or thread to the &quot;trompette&quot;. The &quot;tirant&quot; adjusts the lateral pressure on the &quot;trompette&quot; and thereby sets the sensitivity of the buzzing bridge to changes in wheel velocity. When hard to trigger, the strike or the bridge is said &quot;sec&quot; (dry), &quot;chien sec&quot;, or &quot;coup sec&quot;. When easy to trigger, the strike or the bridge is said &quot;gras&quot; (fat), &quot;chien gras&quot;, or &quot;coup gras&quot;.

There are various stylistic techniques that are used as the player turns the crank, striking the wheel at various points in its revolution. This technique is often known by its French term, the &quot;coup-de-poignet&quot; (or, more simply, the shortened &quot;coup&quot;). The percussion is transmitted to the wheel by striking the handle with the thumb, fingers or base of the thumb at one or more of four points in the revolution of the wheel (often described in terms of the clock face, 12, 3, 6, and 9 o&#x27;clock) to achieve the desired rhythm. A long buzz can also be achieved by accelerating the wheel with the handle. It is called either &quot;un glissé&quot; (a slide) or &quot;une trainée&quot; (a streak). More accomplished players are able to achieve six, eight, or even twelve buzzes within one turn of the wheel.

On the Hungarian &quot;tekerő&quot; the same control is achieved by using a wedge called the &quot;recsegőék&quot; (control wedge, or literally &quot;buzzer wedge&quot;) that pushes the drone string downward. In traditional &quot;tekerő&quot; playing, the buzzing bridge is controlled entirely by the wrist of the player and has a very different sound and rhythmic possibilities from those available on French instruments.

=== Regional types ===

Regional types of hurdy-gurdies since the Renaissance can also be classified based on wheel size and the presence or absence (and type) of a buzzing bridge. The following description of various types uses this framework:

==== Small wheel ====

Small-wheeled (wheel diameter less than 14 cm, or about 5.5 inches) instruments are traditionally found in Central and Eastern Europe. They feature a broad keybox and the drone strings run within the keybox. Because of the small size of the wheel these instruments most commonly have three strings: one melody string, one tenor drone, and one bass drone. They sometimes have up to five strings.

* &quot;String-adjusted buzzing bridge&quot;
** &quot;German pear-shaped Drehleier.&quot; Two to three drone strings and one or two chromatic melody strings. Characteristic V-shaped pegbox. Often extensively decorated. The type of buzzing bridge found on this instrument usually has the adjustment peg set in a block next to the string, rather than in the tailpiece (as is typical of French instruments).
** &quot;lira/vevlira&quot; (Sweden). Revived in the twentieth century based on historical examples. Two body forms: an elongated boxy shape and a long pear shape. Usually diatonic, but has been extended with a chromatic range with the additional keys placed &quot;below&quot; the normal diatonic range (the opposite of most chromatic hurdy-gurdy keyboards).
* &quot;Wedge-adjusted buzzing bridge&quot;
** &quot;tekerőlant (Hungarian)&quot;. Usually two drones (sometimes three) + one or two chromatic melody strings. The broad keybox is often carved or decorated extensively.
** &quot;Tyrolian Drehleier (Austria).&quot; Very similar to the tekerőlant, but usually has a diatonic keyboard. May be the historical source for the tekerő.
* &quot;No buzzing bridge&quot;
** &quot;lira korbowa&quot; (Poland). Guitar-shaped. Two drones + one diatonic melody string.
** &quot;lira/лира&quot; (Russia). Guitar-shaped. Two drones + one diatonic melody string. Evenly spaced keyboard.
** &quot;lira/ліра&quot; or &quot;relia/реля&quot; (Ukraine). Guitar-shaped. Two drones + one diatonic melody string. Two body types: carved from a single piece of wood and guitar-shaped with transverse pegs and mult-piece construction with vertical pegs. Evenly spaced keyboard.
** &quot;ninera/kolovratec&quot; (Slovakia). Guitar-shaped. Two drones + one diatonic melody string. Broad keybox. Superficially similar to the tekerő, but lacks the buzzing bridge.
** &quot;German tulip-shaped Drehleier.&quot; Three drones + one diatonic melody string.

==== Large wheel ====

Large-wheeled instruments (wheel diameters between 14 and 17 cm, or about 5.56.6 inches) are traditionally found in Western Europe. These instruments generally have a narrow keybox with drone strings that run outside the keybox. They also generally have more strings, and doubling or tripling of the melody string is common. Some modern instruments have as many as fifteen strings played by the wheel, although the most common number is six.
* &quot;String-adjusted buzzing bridge&quot;
** &quot;vielle à roue&quot; (French). Usually four drones + two melody strings, but often extended to have more strings. Two body forms: guitar-bodied and lute-backed (&quot;vielle en luth&quot;). French instruments generally have a narrow key box with drone strings that run on the outside of the key box. Traditional French instruments have two melody strings and four drone strings with one buzzing bridge. Contemporary instruments often have more: the instrument of well-known player Gilles Chabenat has four melody strings fixed to a viola tailpiece, and four drone strings on a cello tailpiece. This instrument also has three trompette strings.
** &quot;Niněra&quot; (Czech). Guitar-shaped. Two forms: one has a standard drone-melody arrangement, while the other runs the drone strings between the melody strings in the keybox. Both diatonic and chromatic forms are found. Other mechanisms for adjusting the amount of &quot;buzz&quot; on the trompette string.
* &quot;No buzzing bridge&quot;
** &quot;Zanfona&quot; (Spain). Typically guitar-shaped body, with three melody strings, and two drone strings. Some older examples had a diatonic keyboard, and most modern models have a chromatic keyboard. Zanfonas are usually tuned to the key of C major, with the melody strings tuned in unison to G above the middle C on the piano. The drones are: the &quot;bordonciño&quot; in G (one octave below the melody strings) and the &quot;bordón&quot; in C (two octaves below middle C). Sometimes, two of the melody strings are in unison, and the remaining string is tuned an octave lower, in unison with the &quot;bordonciño&quot; (this string was sometimes known as the &quot;human voice&quot;, because it sounds as if someone is humming the melody an octave lower).
** &quot;niněra&quot; (Czech). Guitar-shaped. Two forms: one has a standard drone-melody arrangement, while the other runs the drone strings between the melody strings in the keybox. Both diatonic and chromatic forms are found.

== Electric and electronic versions ==
In pop music, especially in the popular neo-medieval music, electric hurdy-gurdies are used, wherein electro magnetic pickups convert the vibration of its strings into electrical signals. Similar to electric guitars, the signals are transmitted to an instrument amplifier or reproduced by synthesizer in a modified form.

Electronic hurdy-gurdies, on the other hand, have no strings. The signals for the melody strings are generated electronically by the keys and also in combination with the rotation of the wheel. The signals for drone strings and the snares are generated by the crank movements of the wheel. Depending on the technical equipment of the instrument, the digital audio signal can be output directly via an integrated processor and sound card. The data exchange of the musical information between the hurdy-gurdy and connected computers, samplers or synthesizers are managed via MIDI interface.

<text>Hattie Jacques (; born Josephine Edwina Jaques; 7 February 1922 – 6 October 1980) was an English comedy actress of stage, radio and screen. She is best known as a regular of the &quot;Carry On&quot; films, where she typically played strict, no-nonsense characters, but was also a prolific television and radio performer.

Jacques started her career in 1944 with an appearance at the Players&#x27; Theatre in London, but came to national prominence through her appearances on three highly popular radio series on the BBC: with Tommy Handley on &quot;It&#x27;s That Man Again&quot;; with ventriloquist Peter Brough on &quot;Educating Archie&quot;; and then with Tony Hancock on &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;. After the Second World War Jacques made her cinematic debut in &quot;Green for Danger&quot; (1946), in which she had a brief, uncredited role. From 1958 to 1974 she appeared in 14 &quot;Carry On&quot; films, playing various roles including the formidable hospital matron. On television she had a long professional partnership with Eric Sykes, with whom she co-starred in his long-running series &quot;Sykes&quot; and &quot;Sykes and a...&quot;. The role endeared her to the public and the two became staples of British television.

In private, Jacques led a turbulent life. She was married to the actor John Le Mesurier from 1949 until their divorce in 1965, a separation caused by her five-year affair with another man. Jacques, who had been overweight since her teenage years, suffered ill-health soon after the separation from Le Mesurier and her weight rose to nearly &lt;ins&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;. She died of a heart attack on 6 October 1980, at the age of 58. Her biographer, Frances Gray, considers Jacques had a &quot;talent for larger-than-life comedy which never lost its grip on humanity&quot;, while she could also display &quot;a broader comic mode&quot; as a result of her &quot;extraordinary versatility&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life: 1922–1944===
Jacques was born Josephine Edwina Jaques on 7 February 1922 at 125 Sandgate High Street, Sandgate, Kent. She was the youngest child of Robin Rochester Jaques, an officer in the British Army and later a flying officer in the Royal Air Force, and Mary Jaques ( Thorn), a nurse who served in the Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD).

The Jaques family were predominantly non-theatrical, with the exception of Mary who appeared in the small role of Harry Hathaway in the Christmas pantomime &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; at the Palace Theatre, Cologne, in 1920. Mary enjoyed the theatre, and took Jacques to live performances from an early age. The result had a &quot;profound effect&quot; on the young girl, particularly a love of dance. Robin Rochester Jaques, who attained the rank of flight lieutenant with the RAF, was a keen sportsman and became a semi-professional footballer. He signed to Clapton Orient and Fulham F.C., but his career was cut short when he died in a flying accident on 8 August 1923. Upon his death, Mary, Jacques and her elder brother Robin moved from Newton in Lincolnshire to London, where Jacques was sent to the Lady Margaret primary school in Chelsea. In July 1930 Jacques started her secondary schooling at the Godolphin and Latymer School in Hammersmith, and also attended a local dance school, the Dean Sisters Academy, where she was a principal dancer in the academy&#x27;s shows. She left Godolphin and Latymer in the summer of 1939 with unremarkable grades. She continued intermittently with amateur theatricals, and in May 1939 appeared with the Curtain Club in Barnes in productions of &quot;Fumed Oak&quot; and &quot;Borgia&quot;.

At the outbreak of the Second World War Jacques became a nurse in the VAD; she served in a mobile unit in London, attending bombed sites during the Blitz. After a reorganisation in the VAD, Jacques sought new work and, in the summer of 1943, she became a welder in a factory in north London, a job that lasted until the end of the year. Around this time she became romantically involved with an American soldier, Major Charles Kearney. Jacques later claimed that the pair had been engaged and that Kearney had been killed in action, although her biographer, Andy Merriman, discovered that Kearney had a wife and children in the United States when he had proposed to Jacques, and had returned to them after the war.

===Early post-war work: 1944–1950===
In 1944, after being auditioned by Leonard Sachs, Jacques made her professional theatrical debut as Josephine Jacques—adding a &quot;c&quot; to her birth name as she did so—at the Players&#x27; Theatre, London in a revue called &quot;Late Joys&quot;. Almost immediately she became a regular performer with the company, appearing in music hall revues and playing the Fairy Queen in their Victorian-style pantomimes. Her biographer, Frances Gray, described the Players&#x27; as being Jacques&#x27;s drama school, as she acted, directed, wrote lyrics and &quot;developed the persona she was to use in pantomime for years, the large, bossy, but vulnerable fairy queen&quot;. It was while appearing in a &quot;Late Joys&quot; revue in June 1946 that she made her debut on television, when the show was broadcast on the BBC. While appearing at the Players&#x27; in 1946 she acquired the nickname &quot;Hattie&quot; after performing in the minstrel show &quot;Coal Black Mammies for Dixie&quot;. A member of the backstage staff compared her &quot;blacked up&quot; appearance with the American actress Hattie McDaniel, known for her work in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, and Jacques adopted the name for the rest of her life.

Jacques made her big-screen debut, briefly and uncredited, in the 1946 film &quot;Green for Danger&quot;, directed by Sidney Gilliat. In December that year, she joined the Young Vic Theatre Company and played Smeraldina in &quot;The King Stag&quot;. The play ran at the Lyric Theatre for a month before going on a five-month tour of the UK. It received favourable reviews; the &quot;Gloucestershire Echo&quot; described the piece as &quot;a noble play&quot;, and thought that Jacques was &quot;very solidly in step&quot;. In March 1947 Alberto Cavalcanti&#x27;s film &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; was released, in which Jacques had her first credited big-screen role as Mrs Kenwick. While engaged at the Players&#x27; in June 1947, Jacques was introduced to the actor John Le Mesurier and the two began a relationship. Le Mesurier was married but estranged from his wife.
In August 1947 Ted Kavanagh, the scriptwriter of the BBC Home Service show &quot;It&#x27;s That Man Again&quot; (&quot;ITMA&quot;), visited the Players&#x27; and invited Jacques to audition for the series, which she did on 18 September, for a fee of five guineas. She became so nervous during the audition that Tommy Handley, the show&#x27;s star, held her hand, which she found made her more nervous. Jacques joined the cast of &quot;ITMA&quot; as the greedy schoolgirl Sophie Tuckshop, where she &quot;would regale listeners with terrifying accounts of epic binges&quot;, before finishing her stories with the catchphrase &quot;But I&#x27;m alright now&quot;. Jacques started her run in &quot;ITMA&quot; in September 1947, at the beginning of series eleven, which ran for 38 episodes, and was paid ten guineas per episode.

For much of 1948 Jacques continued to record episodes of &quot;ITMA&quot; for half the week, while spending evenings in the Players&#x27; Theatre; she also found time during the spring to record the role of Flora in &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot; for the BBC and appear at the Whitehall Theatre in &quot;Bates Wharf&quot; with the Under Thirty Theatre Group. Later that year she appeared as a singer at the Three Cripples tavern in the David Lean film &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;. In September she started recording her second series of &quot;ITMA&quot;—the show&#x27;s twelfth—before returning to the Players&#x27; for the Christmas pantomime, &quot;The Sleeping Beauty in the Wood&quot;. In the latter performance, &quot;The Times&quot; commented that Jacques &quot;must surely be among the funniest fairies&quot; in her role as the Fairy Queen Antedota—which was one of her favourite parts.

Tommy Handley died suddenly on 9 January 1949; the BBC decided that he was &quot;so much the keystone and embodiment of the actual performance&quot; of &quot;ITMA&quot;, that they cancelled the show immediately. Jacques later remarked that Handley was &quot;one of the greatest radio performers we have ever known. I learned ... so much from him&quot;. Later that year Le Mesurier divorced his wife; shortly after the divorce came through, Jacques proposed to him, asking, &quot;don&#x27;t you think it&#x27;s about time we got married?&quot; The couple wed on 10 November that year, at Kensington Registrar&#x27;s Office. After a week&#x27;s honeymoon in Southsea, she returned to the Players&#x27; where she was engaged to appear as Marrygolda in the Christmas pantomime &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;.

===Increasing fame: 1950–1958===
In the early months of 1950 &quot;Chance of a Lifetime&quot; was released into British cinemas; it was a film in which Jacques &quot;really made her mark&quot;, according to her biographer, Andy Merriman. &quot;Chance of a Lifetime&quot; is a social and industrial relations drama based in a plough factory whose manager cedes control to the workforce. Jacques played Alice, a welder: when she was offered her fee for 17 days filming, she replied &quot;I&#x27;ve done this job welding Bailey and Pontoon Bridges and I know how hard it is. That&#x27;s not enough money!&quot; and the offer was raised accordingly. The film critic Geoff Mayer considered that Jacques had &quot;the best scene in the film with her mock seductive dance in front of an angry [Niall] MacGinnis&quot;.

On 6 June 1950 Jacques was cast in the first episode of the weekly radio show &quot;Educating Archie&quot; as Agatha Dinglebody. The &quot;Archie&quot; of the title was the ventriloquist&#x27;s dummy Archie Andrews, operated by Peter Brough. The first series ran for 29 weeks until 19 December. In the show Jacques appeared alongside Max Bygraves, Julie Andrews, Beryl Reid and—in the second series—Tony Hancock. It was on this programme that she first worked with Eric Sykes, who was providing scripts for the series. Sykes had been impressed with Jacques since he visited the Players&#x27; in 1948. He later wrote that she &quot;moved about the stage with an elegance and grace as if she owned it. At the end of her act, to great applause, she leapt in the air, finishing in the splits, landing as softly as a snowflake in July&quot;. After the show Sykes was introduced to Jacques backstage and thought that the meeting was &quot;the beginning of a new flight&quot; in his professional life. At the end of the series Jacques returned to the Players&#x27; to appear in the Christmas pantomime, &quot;Ali Baba and the Thirty-nine Thieves&quot;, which she and Joan Sterndale-Bennett had adapted after they had copied it out long-hand at the British Museum. The reviewer in &quot;The Times&quot; thought that Jacques was &quot;as appealing as last year&quot;, in her performance as Ali Baba&#x27;s wife, Cogia.

Throughout 1951 Jacques continued to mix work in different media, including appearing as Mrs Fezziwig in the film &quot;Scrooge&quot; starring Alastair Sim; from 3 August until 25 January 1952 she appeared in a second radio series of &quot;Educating Archie&quot;, as well as appearing in the related stage show, &quot;The Archie Andrews Christmas Show&quot; at the Prince of Wales Theatre from December 1952 to January 1953. She again appeared in—and co-adapted—a Christmas pantomime at the Players&#x27; Theatre, &quot;Riquet with the Tuft&quot;, a French fairy tale by Charles Perrault. In 1952 Jacques also portrayed Mrs Jenks in John Gilling&#x27;s comedy horror film &quot;Mother Riley Meets the Vampire&quot;, co-starring Arthur Lucan and Bela Lugosi.
Jacques became pregnant in 1952, but worked through most of her pregnancy, appearing in the Players&#x27; revue &quot;The Bells of St Martins&quot; between August and November 1952: she slid down the table and did the splits at the end—something &quot;The Times&quot; thought was &quot;especially good&quot;, although &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; considered that she was &quot;monumental of person but surprisingly thin of voice&quot;. Le Mesurier reported that he was &quot;faintly relieved&quot; when the revue came to an end because of her exertions, added to which she appeared in the 27 episodes of the third series of &quot;Educating Archie&quot; between September 1952 and June 1953. She then directed—but did not appear in—the Players&#x27; Christmas pantomime of 1952, &quot;Babes in the Wood&quot;. In March 1953 Jacques gave birth to her first son, Robin, and returned to work after a few days to film &quot;Up to His Neck&quot;. Later that year she provided the lead alongside Le Mesurier in the 38-minute &quot;movie-masque&quot; &quot;The Pleasure Garden&quot;; filmed in 1952, it won the at the 1954 Cannes Film Festival. From October until April 1954 she was in series four of &quot;Educating Archie&quot;, while in December 1953 she also appeared in and directed &quot;Cinderella&quot; at the Players&#x27;; &quot;The Times&quot; commented that &quot;Miss Jacques as actress, playing a deliciously arch and absent-minded Fairy Queen, goes a long way to retrieve the failure of Miss Jacques as dramatist&quot;.

In 1954 Jacques continued to work on radio. Between April and July she was in &quot;Paradise Street&quot;, a spin-off series from &quot;Educating Archie&quot;, while in June she was in &quot;Archie in Goonland&quot;, a one-off special programme that was a collaboration between &quot;Educating Archie&quot; and &quot;The Goon Show&quot;. As well as recording in series five of &quot;Educating Archie&quot;, she was also cast as Mrs Leathers for 18 episodes of &quot;Mrs Dale&#x27;s Diary&quot; between February and April 1955. She both produced and directed &quot;Twenty Minutes South&quot;, first at the Players&#x27; Theatre, and then for 105 performances at the St Martin&#x27;s Theatre and finished the year by appearing in seven episodes of &quot;The Granville Melodramas&quot; on ITV between October and December.

A second pregnancy led to the birth of a son, Kim, &quot;who came rollicking and laughing into the world in October 1956, a trifle before his allotted time&quot;, according to Le Mesurier. In June 1956 Jacques appeared in an episode of &quot;The Tony Hancock Show&quot; on ITV; this led to the role of Hancock&#x27;s secretary, Griselda Pugh, in the BBC radio series &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;. She appeared in 16 episodes from November 1956 to February 1957, alongside Hancock and regulars Sidney James, Bill Kerr and Kenneth Williams. Jacques&#x27;s arrival on &quot;Hancock&quot; &quot;provided an additional boost to the series&quot;, according to television historian Richard Webber. She appeared again in five further episodes of &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot; between April and June 1957, and again for a further 20 episodes between January and June 1958, before a special edition on Christmas Day 1958. She spent much of 1958 at the London Palladium, undertaking 380 performances of the revue &quot;Large as Life&quot;, alongside Terry-Thomas, Eric Sykes and Harry Secombe. She appeared in the sketches &quot;Concerto for Three Buffoons&quot; with Secombe and Sykes, &quot;The Good Old Days&quot;, and the two full company numbers that closed each of the two halves of the show.

===The &quot;Carry On&quot; series: 1958–1963===
When the first &quot;Carry On&quot; film was made in 1958, Jacques formed part of the cast. This series would go on to employ the same group of actors who would collectively become known as the &quot;Carry On team&quot;. Jacques appeared in 14 of these films over a 15-year period and like many of her &quot;Carry On&quot; co-stars, she quickly became typecast. A recurring role for Jacques was a no-nonsense matron which she played in five of the films – &quot;Carry On Nurse&quot;, &quot;Carry On Doctor&quot;, &quot;Carry On Again Doctor&quot;, &quot;Carry On Camping&quot; and &quot;Carry On Matron&quot;. She became known by the team as a &quot;Mother Hen&quot; figure, and was a close friend to many of her co-stars, including Kenneth Williams and Joan Sims, whom Jacques provided with a great deal of advice and practical help. In return, Sims regarded Jacques as her &quot;greatest friend&quot;, and as &quot;both a sister and a mother to me&quot;. Jacques would frequently invite Sims, Williams and Hawtrey to her house for Christmas dinner.

Jacques began her association with the &quot;Carry On&quot; series in March 1958 with the first film in the series, &quot;Carry On Sergeant&quot;. She played the small role of Captain Clark, a &quot;battleaxe medical officer&quot; who fails to believe the fabricated ailments of the hypochondriac Private Horace Strong, played by Kenneth Connor. The following year she played &quot;Matron&quot; for the first time in &quot;Carry On Nurse&quot;, a film which broke that year&#x27;s box office records, selling more than 10 million tickets in British cinemas. Although Jacques&#x27;s role was still relatively small, she appeared in perhaps the best known scene of the film, in which she retrieves a daffodil from Wilfrid Hyde-White&#x27;s buttocks, put there by a mischievous nurse as revenge for his constant harassment of the staff. So popular was Jacques&#x27;s scene, that the producers imported two million plastic daffodils from Japan which were then used to promote the comedy. Other characterisations followed, including the formidable maths mistress Grace Short in &quot;Carry On Teacher&quot; (1959) and the friendly Police Sergeant Laura Moon in &quot;Carry On Constable&quot; (1960). Of the former film, Derek Prouse of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; thought that Jacques &quot;triumph[ed] over material so remorselessly juvenile that one is battered into a kind of fascinated admiration&quot;.

On 29 January 1960 Jacques appeared in the first episode of the BBC comedy series &quot;Sykes and a...&quot;, co-starring with Eric Sykes as a pair of twins; Richard Wattis and Deryck Guyler were also regulars in the cast. Jacques&#x27;s character—Hattie (Hat) Sykes—was &quot;a middle-class, slightly pretentious lady struggling to keep her dignity as the men made fools of themselves&quot;. &quot;Sykes and a...&quot; went on to run for sixty episodes over nine series during the next five years. According to the media historian Graham McCann, the show was &quot;one of the best-natured, least pretentious and most successful British sitcoms of the 1960s&quot;. Because of the success, Jacques and Sykes &quot;became embedded in the public mind as a priceless comic partnership&quot;; to capitalise, they released a comedy album entitled &quot;Eric and Hattie and Things!!!&quot;, but it failed to chart. In September 1960 she starred in her second television series, &quot;Our House&quot;, alongside Charles Hawtrey, Bernard Bresslaw and Joan Sims; Jacques played the librarian Georgina Ruddy, who was forced to keep quiet at work and so made up for it by being extremely noisy at home. Later that year she played minor roles in two films: &quot;Watch Your Stern&quot;, with many of the &quot;Carry On&quot; regulars, and &quot;School for Scoundrels&quot;, opposite Ian Carmichael. After these her screen time increased with the part of Nanette Parry in &quot;Make Mine Mink&quot; in which she co-starred with Terry-Thomas and Athene Seyler. She later described this as her favourite film.

In October 1961 Jacques appeared on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, and said that she would be too lonely on such a quiet island for someone of her temperament. By this time &quot;Carry On&quot; had become a leading film franchise, with the author Robert Ross describing it as a &quot;phenomenon&quot;. That year&#x27;s film, &quot;Carry On Regardless&quot;, was the fifth in the series; Jacques received a fee of £100 for the small role of a disgruntled hospital sister, who appeared briefly on screen alongside the English character actor Kynaston Reeves. Jacques was initially intended for a major part in the film, but she was unable to commit to a longer role because of ill health. She appeared in her sixth &quot;Carry On&quot;, &quot;Carry On Cabby&quot;, in 1963, as &quot;Peggy Hawkins&quot;, the emotionally neglected wife of taxi-firm boss &quot;Charlie&quot;, played by Sid James. Jacques later named the film as her favourite of the series, as she was allowed to drop her &quot;battleaxe&quot; persona and play the romantic lead opposite James.

===Private turmoil; new acting ventures: 1963–1967===
Jacques&#x27;s private life became complicated in 1963. The previous year she had met John Schofield, a cockney used-car dealer, who chauffeured her to a Leukaemia Research Fund event. The couple became romantically involved after the driver gave her the attention and support that Le Mesurier did not. When Jacques decided to move Schofield into the family home, Le Mesurier moved into a separate room. He later commented about this period: &quot;I could have walked out, but, whatever my feelings, I loved Hattie and the children and I was certain—I had to be certain—that we could repair the damage&quot;. During these upheavals in her personal life, Jacques was surprised to be the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in February 1963, when she was approached by Eamonn Andrews during rehearsal for the sixth series of &quot;Sykes and a...&quot;. Although Le Mesurier did not mention the marital situation when being questioned by Andrews, he made the comment that for Jacques &quot;the home comes first&quot;, which Merriman considered had been said &quot;rather pointedly&quot;. Despite the matrimonial upsets, Jacques and Le Mesurier both appeared in the 1963 Tony Hancock film, &quot;The Punch and Judy Man&quot;. In 1964 Le Mesurier moved out of the marital home, made a decision to protect Jacques from any negative publicity, and allowed her to bring a divorce suit on grounds of his own infidelity. This ensured that the press blamed him for the break-up, casting Jacques as the victim in the matter.

In 1964, as well as recording four episodes of the radio show &quot;Housewives&#x27; Choice&quot;, Jacques starred in her own television series, &quot;Miss Adventure&quot;, as the private investigator Stacey Smith. Although Jacques wanted the series to be full of suspense, the programmes were more comedic and she was disappointed with the results. In August that year she appeared as Madame Arcati in an ITV production of &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot;. The play&#x27;s writer, Noël Coward, felt that &quot;finally someone had delivered a performance that wasn&#x27;t overshadowed by Margaret Rutherford&quot;, who had originated the stage role in 1940 and played it in the 1945 film version.

Jacques went to Rome in 1966 to film &quot;The Bobo&quot; with Peter Sellers; before this she went on a strict diet and lost five stone (32 kg), although she was disappointed that so few people noticed. She enjoyed the filming experience, calling it &quot;one of the loveliest things I&#x27;ve worked on&quot;. While she was in Italy, Schofield came out to stay, started an affair with an Italian heiress and broke off his relationship with Jacques; deeply upset, Jacques, who had had a weight problem since her teens, began eating comfort food and her weight increased to nearly .

===Return to &quot;Carry On&quot;: 1967–1974===
In the summer of 1967 the &quot;Carry On&quot; producer Peter Rogers assembled the cast for the 15th film of the series, &quot;Carry On Doctor&quot;. Rogers initially chose Joan Sims to play the role of the hospital matron but she declined the part, stating that Jacques&#x27;s performance of the role in &quot;Carry On Nurse&quot; could not be bettered. As such, Rogers cast Jacques as Matron, with Sims accepting a smaller role as the timid assistant of the film&#x27;s lead character Francis Bigger, played by Frankie Howerd. Jacques&#x27;s screen time was increased from &quot;Carry On Nurse&quot;, as the producers considered her part to be an extension of the earlier role. &quot;Carry On Doctor&quot; was released in December of that year, to much success.

Jacques started 1968 by appearing with Spike Milligan and Frank Thornton in thirteen episodes of the sketch show &quot;The World of Beachcomber&quot;, based on the Beachcomber column in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; newspaper and broadcast on the BBC from January to April. Shortly after the series finished, she appeared alongside Frankie Howerd in his sketch show, &quot;Howerd&#x27;s Hour&quot;, on ITV. She continued her busy schedule with appearances in six films for 1969, including another with Sellers, &quot;The Magic Christian&quot;. Here she portrayed a character named Ginger, who was described as a &quot;grotesque figure&quot;, with an &quot;insatiable lust for bestsellers on the atrocities of World War Two&quot;. She also appeared on television alongside Harry Secombe and Roy Castle in &quot;Pickwick&quot;, which was based on the musical of the same name, and in &quot;Carry On Christmas&quot;, broadcast on Christmas Eve. Although 1969 had been busy, 1970 was relatively quiet in terms of her professional output: apart from an episode of &quot;Catweazle&quot;, she appeared alongside Willoughby Goddard in a six-episode series of &quot;Charley&#x27;s Grants&quot;. She spent May and June filming &quot;Carry On Loving&quot;, in which she played Sophie Bliss, released in September that year. Another &quot;Carry On&quot; film followed in 1971, &quot;Carry On at Your Convenience&quot;, where she played Beattie Plummer, the housebound wife of Sid Plummer, played by Sid James. In the same year she completed another series with Sykes, &quot;Sykes and a Big, Big Show&quot;, a music and sketch programme which had six episodes, broadcast between February and April.

Two further &quot;Carry On&quot; films followed for Jacques in 1972: &quot;Carry On Matron&quot;, for which she was engaged in the title role, and &quot;Carry On Abroad&quot;, as Floella, the fiery Spanish cook at a half-finished hotel. As well as the film being Charles Hawtrey&#x27;s last, it also marked a reduction in Jacques&#x27;s screen time; she spent only one week filming her scenes. During post-production, the film&#x27;s insurers became concerned about Jacques&#x27;s deteriorating health. In a letter to the series producer Peter Rogers, they expressed their reluctance to insure her on set in any future film.

During the course of 1972 Jacques co-starred in the first series of &quot;Sykes&quot;, in which she played Hattie Sykes, &quot;the wide-eyed, less-knowing but remarkably patient sister-cum-mother-figure&quot;; at its height, &quot;Sykes&quot; had 17 million viewers. In February 1972 Jacques was at home with her son Robin to watch Le Mesurier win the British Academy of Film and Television Arts &quot;Best Television Actor&quot; award for his portrayal of a &quot;boozy British aristocrat ... who became a spy for the Soviets&quot; in Dennis Potter&#x27;s television play &quot;Traitor&quot;. Jacques cried when her ex-husband won the award, and divulged to her son that she &quot;wasn&#x27;t crying out of professional resentment or even envy about Joan Le Mesurier ... but from an unhappiness that, through her own actions, she lost John or there was now no-one with whom to spend her life&quot;.

===After &quot;Carry On&quot;: 1974–1980===

====Final appearances====
In 1974 Jacques&#x27;s sons were arrested for possession of cannabis, and her house was searched by police. In the same week that the two boys appeared in court, she received official notification of the intention to appoint her as an OBE. In order to protect her sons from further press intrusion she declined the honour. Later that year, while filming the third series of &quot;Sykes&quot;, she suffered a cancer scare and lost a considerable amount of weight. Despite this she refused to interrupt the busy production schedule; when filming was completed on 5 December she underwent surgery at Charing Cross Hospital for what proved to be benign tumours on her kidneys.

In 1976 Jacques appeared in a promotional advertising film for British Rail, which pitted her against racing driver Jackie Stewart in a race to London. From 1976 onwards Sykes and Jacques appeared together in the stage play &quot;A Hatful of Sykes&quot;, both in the UK and internationally. During the course of the different tours relations between the two stars became increasingly strained and Sykes altered the act several times to ensure he received more acclaim than Jacques. While appearing in Blackpool in 1977 Jacques&#x27;s health became problematic as she suffered from arthritis and ulcerated legs, which required daily dressing. Because a dressing room was arranged that avoided her needing to use stairs, Sykes accused her of receiving special treatment. When the show moved to Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), Sykes &quot;began to behave rather strangely ... and he even accused Hattie ... of not being able to deliver a proper feed line&quot;. By the time the show appeared in Brighton in 1979 the relationship between the two &quot;was rapidly deteriorating&quot;, and, although the pair praised each other in public, Jacques felt hurt by Sykes&#x27;s treatment of her. Despite the differences, the pair filmed the seventh series of &quot;Sykes&quot; in 1979, and—in April 1980—the television film &quot;Rhubarb Rhubarb&quot;; although her part was a small one, she looked &quot;a little unsteady on her feet&quot;, according to Merriman.

====Death and tributes====
In May 1980 Jacques&#x27;s doctor advised her against travelling to Greece on holiday as planned, so she visited Ireland instead. During the return ferry crossing she told her friend Bruce Copp that &quot;You know I&#x27;m not going to live long&quot;. Her health remained poor, and insurance companies refused to insure her for film work. By October her weight had risen again; she had problems breathing and was again admitted to Charing Cross Hospital. She took a weekend break from hospital and returned home to Eardley Crescent, where on 6 October she died from a heart attack in her sleep at the age of 58; she was also suffering from kidney failure.

Jacques&#x27;s funeral took place at Putney Vale Crematorium, where her ashes were scattered. Her sons refused to allow Sykes entry to the funeral because they resented the way he had treated her during the stage show; Sykes was upset by the exclusion and failed to understand why he had been banned. The other notable absentee from the funeral was Joan Sims, who &quot;stayed in her home and spent the day drinking, reading old letters from Hattie and wallowing in self pity&quot;, according to Merriman.

Kenneth Williams was deeply saddened by the loss of his friend, and wrote that &quot;all the chums have died ... one is left marooned on the shore ... the tide is receding and leaving some incongruous wrecks exposed ... I fear I am one of them&quot;. John Le Mesurier described Jacques as &quot;a remarkable lady ... [who] had an aura of love and kindness about her&quot;, while her obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; observed that &quot;she will be remembered with affection by all who saw her&quot;. A month after the funeral, a memorial service was held at St Paul&#x27;s, Covent Garden, otherwise known as the Actors&#x27; Church, which was described by Le Mesurier as a &quot;joyous occasion&quot;.

A memorial plaque to Jacques is situated in St Paul&#x27;s, Covent Garden. In November 1995 a blue plaque was unveiled by Eric Sykes and Clive Dunn—a colleague from her Players&#x27; Theatre days—at her former house: 67 Eardley Crescent, Earls Court, London. In 2002 plaques were unveiled for Jacques, Sid James and Tony Hancock at BBC Broadcasting House in London.

In 2011 Jacques and Le Mesurier&#x27;s marriage was the subject of a BBC Four biographical film called &quot;Hattie&quot;, which focused on Jacques&#x27;s affair with John Schofield. She was played by Ruth Jones, who Robin Le Mesurier thought &quot;had captured my mother perfectly&quot;. Jones was thrilled at playing Jacques whom she considered to be her comedy heroine, describing her as an &quot;incredibly talented and fascinating woman both on and off screen&quot;.

==Reputation==
The writer Susan Leckey described Jacques as &quot;one of the best-loved British comedy stars&quot;, while Jacques&#x27;s obituarist in &quot;The Times&quot; observed that &quot;she was invariably successful&quot; at making people &quot;laugh with, rather than at you&quot;. Peter Chapman of &quot;The Independent&quot; stated that Jacques was &quot;blessed with remarkable grace, delicacy and warmth, giving her an almost unique comic appeal&quot;. &quot;Sunday Life&quot; said that for decades she was &quot;Britain&#x27;s favourite silly, sexually frustrated, fat woman&quot;. Nina Wadia of &quot;Goodness Gracious Me&quot; considers Jacques along with Joan Sims and Barbara Windsor to have &quot;paved the way for younger comediennes in Britain today&quot;, remarking that &quot;if it had not been for women like Hattie and Barbara, there is no way that younger actresses would have any role model, or probably the ambition to do what they do&quot;.

Jacques&#x27;s biographer, Frances Gray, highlighted two aspects of the actress&#x27;s abilities; in her appearances in the sequence of post-war Dickens adaptations (&quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot;, &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, &quot;Scrooge&quot; and &quot;Pickwick&quot;) Jacques &quot;reflected her talent for larger-than-life comedy which never lost its grip on humanity&quot;, while in other films, such as &quot;Mother Riley Meets the Vampire&quot;, she displayed &quot;a broader comic mode&quot;. In her later career Jacques showed &quot;a comic talent of extraordinary versatility. In &quot;Sykes&quot; her performance had to be a foil for the main character; in the &quot;Carry Ons&quot; she blossomed&quot;. As a singer she was also praised; Jonathan Cecil of &quot;The Spectator&quot; said that her &quot;bell-tone voice with its cut-crystal diction—perfect for radio—had an edge of pain which suggested a greater depth to her talents than she was generally allowed to express&quot;. The actor Neville Phillips, who toured with Jacques, described her as having a &quot;pretty voice&quot; and able to &quot;take an innocuous old Victorian or Edwardian ballad and with just a few intonations and expressions give it another meaning entirely&quot;.

Gray observes that &quot;Jacques is enduringly associated with the role of hospital matron&quot; and her portrayal of the character in five films had a lasting impact on both her legacy and on the role and view of Matrons in the National Health Service. An article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; by Mark Lawson mixed fiction with reality when he wrote that &quot;standards of hygiene have slipped since Hattie Jacques ran NHS wards&quot;. According to &quot;The Scotsman&quot;, the 2003 Labour Party Conference &quot;applauded deliriously because the government has revived Hattie Jacques&quot;, in relation to a change in government policy. After complaints about the NHS in 2008, the &quot;Western Morning News&quot; suggested the government should &quot;clone a Hattie Jacques-type matron to run a tight ship everywhere&quot;. NHS nurses have complained about the stereotype: in August 2013 the &quot;Nursing Times&quot; quoted one matron, who protested that they were &quot;not like Hattie Jacques anymore&quot;.

Alan Simpson, the co-writer of &quot;Hancock&quot;, enjoyed writing for Jacques, and thought that she was &quot;almost like a fella in terms of playing comedy; you didn&#x27;t write for her thinking she&#x27;s a woman so we&#x27;ve got to write the feminine point of view. That made it easier for us&quot;. Neville Phillips thought she was a &quot;complete revelation&quot;, adding &quot;although she was a large lady (very large, in fact), her movements were dainty, light and graceful, and she had a way of playing comedy that put me in mind of the great Beatrice Lillie ... a subtle, sophisticated actress&quot;. Her friend Bob Monkhouse thought that her career was overshadowed by her size: &quot;She was such a great comedienne ... everyone wanted her but the movers and shakers of entertainment didn&#x27;t perceive her as anything other than a fat lady&quot;. Garth Pearce, writing in the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, noted that &quot;she always chose to play women in funny situations, rather than refer directly to her weight. She concentrated on the script and its interpretation instead of winning easy laughs by playing &#x27;the fattie&#x27;.&quot; The approach of writers differed in how they dealt with the characters they asked Jacques to portray. Morwenna Banks and Amanda Swift consider Jacques to have been &quot;unimaginatively cast as the &#x27;fat person&#x27;&quot; in &quot;ITMA&quot;, while in &quot;Sykes&quot;, her weight was rarely referred to—and Jacques said that Sykes &quot;hardly ever made jokes about my size which was a refreshing change&quot;. Gray considers that &quot;although often cast in broad comedy, she never played it broadly, but with an elegance of voice and body that belied all the clichés about women and weight&quot;.

<doc id="158998" wikidata="Q7756371" url="?curid=158998" title="The Patterns of Chaos">
<text>The Patterns of Chaos is a 1972 science fiction novel by British writer Colin Kapp. It originally appeared in &quot;If&quot; magazine, serialized in three parts.

It combines grand space operatic themes of battle between space empires and intergalactic alien invasion with philosophical themes of predestination and destiny, and detailed character development of a tight set of central characters.

Earth&#x27;s Stellar Commando has placed their secret agent Commander Bron on a planet where they hope he will be able to find out the coordinates of a rival space empire, the Destroyers.
Bron is there to impersonate a famous scientist of interest to the Destroyers, and has been given implants through which a monitoring team can see what he sees, hear what he hears and talk to him, even when separated by interstellar distances. The plot hinges on a fictional science, the study of the entropic &quot;patterns of Chaos&quot;, which allows predictions of events with an accuracy that was not before possible. Both Earth and the Destroyers—and specifically Bron himself—are discovered to be the target of an extraterrestrial interstellar murder campaign that was hatched 700 million years ago. He succeeds in joining together the Earth and Destroyer fleets and confronts the aliens, to discover that his destiny is inextricably entangled with theirs.

<doc id="159001" wikidata="Q1689081" url="?curid=159001" title="Jim Dale">
<text>Jim Dale (born James Smith; 15 August 1935) is an English actor, composer, director, narrator, singer and songwriter. In the United Kingdom he is known as a pop singer of the 1950s who became a leading actor at the National Theatre. In British film, along with Larry Dann, Angela Douglas, Patricia Franklin, Hugh Futcher, Linda Hooks, Valerie Leon, Jacki Piper, Anita Harris and others, he is now one of just a few surviving actors to star in multiple &quot;Carry On&quot; films. 

Dale was also a leading actor on Broadway, where he had roles in &quot;Scapino&quot;, &quot;Barnum&quot;, &quot;Candide&quot; and &quot;Me and My Girl&quot;. He also narrated the U.S. audiobooks for all seven novels in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series, for which he won two Grammy Awards. Dale appeared in the ABC series &quot;Pushing Daisies&quot; (2007–2009); he also starred in the Disney film &quot;Pete&#x27;s Dragon&quot; (1977). He was nominated for a BAFTA Award for portraying a young Spike Milligan in &quot;Adolf Hitler: My Part in His Downfall&quot; (1973).

As a lyricist, Dale was nominated for both an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for the song &quot;Georgy Girl&quot;, the theme for the 1966 film of the same title.

==Early life==
Dale was born James Smith, to William Henry and Miriam Jean (&quot;née&quot; Wells) Smith in Rothwell, Northamptonshire. He was educated at Kettering Grammar School. He trained as a dancer for six years before his debut as a stage comic in 1951. He completed two years of national service in the Royal Air Force.

==Career==
===Music===
At the age of 22, Dale became the first pop singer to work with Parlophone head George Martin. He achieved four hits on the UK Singles Chart; &quot;Be My Girl&quot; (1957, UK No. 2), &quot;Just Born (To Be Your Baby)&quot; (1958, UK No. 27), &quot;Crazy Dream&quot; (1958, UK No. 24), and &quot;Sugartime&quot; (1958, UK No. 25). Dale recorded an album with Martin, &quot;Jim!&quot; (1958), and appeared contemporaneously as a presenter and performer on BBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Six-Five Special&quot;, but he was vocal about comedy aspirations and his career as a teen idol was ultimately short-lived.

As a songwriter, Dale is best remembered as the lyricist for the film theme &quot;Georgy Girl&quot;, for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song and the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song in 1966. The song (performed by the Seekers) reached number 2 in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart the following year, it also made number 3 in Dale&#x27;s native UK and Number 1 in Australia, going on to sell over 11 million records around the world. He also wrote lyrics for the title songs of the films &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, &quot;Shalako&quot;, &quot;Twinky&quot; (&quot;Lola&quot; in the United States) and &quot;Joseph Andrews&quot;. He also wrote and recorded the song &quot;Dick-a-Dum-Dum (King&#x27;s Road)&quot;, which became a hit for Des O&#x27;Connor in 1969.

Between 1957 and 1958, Dale was the compère for Stanley Dale&#x27;s National Skiffle Contest, a touring music competition.

===Film===
Dale&#x27;s film debut was in &quot;Break-In&quot; (1956), a War Office  information film. He next appeared in &quot;Six Five Special&quot; (1958), a spin-off from the BBC TV series of the same title. This film was also released under the name &quot;Calling All Cats&quot;. He then had a tiny role in the comedy &quot;Raising the Wind&quot; (1961) as a trombone player who thwarts orchestral conductor Kenneth Williams. However, he is best known in Britain for his appearances in eleven &quot;Carry On&quot; films, a long-running series of comedy farces, generally playing the hapless romantic lead. His &quot;Carry On&quot; career began in small roles: first as an expectant father in &quot;Carry On Cabby&quot; (1963), which was followed by &quot;Carry On Jack&quot; (1964). From &quot;Carry On Spying&quot; (1964) onwards, his roles were more substantial. Following &quot;Carry On Cleo&quot; (1964), his first principal role was &quot;Carry On Cowboy&quot; (1965), set in the Wild West, where he played an immigrant English sanitary engineer called Marshall P. Knutt who is mistakenly hired as a police marshal. Then came &quot;Carry On Screaming!&quot; (1966), &quot;Don&#x27;t Lose Your Head&quot; (1966), &quot;Follow That Camel&quot; (1967), &quot;Carry On Doctor&quot; (1967), &quot;Carry On Again Doctor&quot; (1969) and the 1992 revival &quot;Carry On Columbus&quot;.

Dale played Harold, the policeman in the 1965 comedy film &quot;The Big Job&quot; with two of his regular Carry On co-stars, Sidney James and Joan Sims. 

In 1973, Dale appeared in the role of Spike Milligan in &quot;Adolf Hitler: My Part in His Downfall,&quot; the film adaptation of the first volume of Spike Milligan&#x27;s autobiography. It starred Dale as the young Terence &quot;Spike&quot; Milligan, while Milligan himself plays the part of his father, Leo. Dale was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles for his performance.

Dale played Dr. Terminus in Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Pete&#x27;s Dragon&quot; (1977). In the 1978 Walt Disney comedy film &quot;Hot Lead and Cold Feet&quot; he played three characters, including both lead male parts, whilst 1973 saw him co-star in &quot;The National Health&quot;.

===Stage===
At the age of 17, Dale became one of the youngest professional comedians in Britain, touring all the variety music halls.

In 1970 Sir Laurence Olivier invited Dale to join the National Theatre Company in London, then based at the Old Vic. At the Young Vic Theatre, he created the title role in &quot;Scapino&quot; (ca. 1970), which he co-adapted with Frank Dunlop, and played Petruchio in &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;.

His other UK credits include &quot;The Card&quot; (1973), and &quot;The Wayward Way&quot; in London. He appeared in &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; as Autolycus and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; as Bottom at the Edinburgh Festivals in 1966 and 1967 for Frank Dunlop&#x27;s Pop Theatre. He took over the part of Fagin in Cameron Mackintosh&#x27;s &quot;Oliver!&quot; at the London Palladium in September 1995.

For his Broadway performances, Dale has been nominated for five Tony Awards, winning one for &quot;Barnum&quot; (1980) for which the &quot;New York Times&quot; described him as &quot;The Toast of Broadway&quot;, also winning the second of five Drama Desk Awards, and the second of five Outer Critics Awards. Other work includes &quot;Scapino&quot; (1974) (Drama Desk Award, Outer Critics Award, Tony Award Nomination), &quot;A Day in the Death of Joe Egg&quot; (1985) (Outer Critics Award, Tony Award Nomination), &quot;Me and My Girl&quot; (1986) &quot;Candide&quot; (1997) (Tony Award Nomination) and &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; (2006) for the Roundabout Theatre Company. Dale played Mister Peacham and won a Drama Desk Award, Outer Critics&#x27; Award, The Richard Seff Award and a Tony Award nomination.

Credits Off-Broadway include &quot;Travels with My Aunt&quot; (1995) (Drama Desk Award, Lucille Lortel Award, Outer Critics Award), &quot;Privates On Parade&quot; (1989), &quot;Comedians&quot; (2003) (Drama Desk Award nomination and a Lucille Lortel Award nomination) and &quot;Address Unknown&quot; (2004).

Dale&#x27;s other stage work includes &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; as Petruchio with the Young Vic, London (1970) and the Brooklyn Academy of Music, New York (1974); &quot;The Music Man&quot; U.S. tour (1984), and &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; at the Cleveland Play House (1998). He played the part of Ebenezer Scrooge in &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; at the Theater at Madison Square Garden, New York City, from 28 November to 27 December 2003.

In November 2006 Dale starred as Charlie Baxter in a one-night only concert version of the Sherman brothers musical &quot;Busker Alley&quot; alongside Glenn Close. This was a benefit for the York Theatre Company, and was held at Hunter College in New York City. He wrote and appeared in his one-man show, &quot;Just Jim Dale&quot;, looking back over nearly sixty years in show business. It opened on 15 May 2014 at the Roundabout Theatre Company Laura Pels Theatre, winning Dale his fifth Outer Critics Circle Award, and his fifth Drama Desk Award. It opened at the Vaudeville Theatre in the West End in May 2015.

===Voice work===
In the United States, Jim Dale is known as the voice of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; audiobooks, narrating the U.S. versions of all seven novels in the series. Dale&#x27;s &quot;Harry Potter&quot; narrations are universally acclaimed. He won two Grammy Awards (in 2001 and 2008) and received seven Grammy nominations and a record ten Audie Awards including &quot;Audio Book of the Year 2004&quot; for &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;, &quot;Best Children&#x27;s Narrator 2001/2005/2007/2008,&quot; &quot;Best Children&#x27;s Audio Book 2005,&quot; two Benjamin Franklin Awards from the Independent Book Publishers Association (one of these was in 2001 for &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;) and 23 &quot;AudioFile&quot; Earphone Awards. The audio short series &quot;Dirty Potter&quot; uses sound editing of Dale&#x27;s past voice work to narrate the series. The series is a parody narrated by a &quot;re-imagined&quot; version of Dale, and its content was created without Dale&#x27;s input.

He narrates the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; video games and many of the interactive &quot;extras&quot; on the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; DVD releases. He also holds one current and two former Guinness World Records. He holds one current record for occupying the first six places in the Top Ten Audio Books of America and Canada 2005. Previously, he held records for creating the most character voices for an audiobook (134 for &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; in 2003, followed by 146 voices for &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; in 2007), though the record was later awarded to Roy Dotrice for his 2004 recording of &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;. Dale opened every episode of the ABC drama &quot;Pushing Daisies&quot; as the unseen narrator.

In the mid-1960s, Dale presented &quot;Children&#x27;s Favourites&quot; on BBC Radio for a year.

He narrated the &quot;Peter and the Starcatchers&quot; (2004) audio book, and its three sequels. In 2018, Dale narrated &quot;SPIN: The Rumpelstiltskin Musical&quot; by Edelman and Fishman, noted as being the first audiobook musical of its kind. &quot;SPIN&quot; was released by Harper Audio on 9 January 2018. The following year, Dale narrated &quot;Puss In Boots a Musical&quot; by Edelman and Fishman, adapted for the audiobook by Edelman, Fishman, and Khristine Hvam. It was released by Harper Audio on 27 August 2019.

== Honours ==
In 2003, Dale was awarded the MBE, as part of the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List, for his work in promoting children&#x27;s English literature.

<text>Kenneth Mackenzie Clark, Baron Clark (13 July 1903 – 21 May 1983) was a British art historian, museum director and broadcaster. His expertise covered a wide range of artists and periods, but he is particularly associated with Italian Renaissance art, most of all that of Leonardo da Vinci. After running two art galleries in the 1930s and 1940s, he came to wider public notice on television, presenting a succession of programmes on the arts from the 1950s to the 1970s, the largest and best known being the &quot;Civilisation&quot; series in 1969.

The son of rich parents, Clark was introduced to the arts at an early age. Among his early influences were the writings of John Ruskin, which instilled in him the belief that everyone should have access to great art. After coming under the influence of the art experts Bernard Berenson and Roger Fry, Clark was appointed director of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford aged twenty-seven, and three years later he was put in charge of Britain&#x27;s National Gallery. His twelve years there saw the gallery transformed to make it accessible and inviting to a wider public. During the Second World War, when the collection was moved from London for safe keeping, Clark made the building available for a series of daily concerts which proved a celebrated morale booster during the Blitz.

After the war, and three years as Slade Professor of Fine Art at Oxford, Clark surprised many by accepting the chairmanship of the UK&#x27;s first commercial television network. Once the service had been successfully launched he agreed to write and present programmes about the arts. These established him as a household name in Britain, and he was asked to create the first colour series about the arts, &quot;Civilisation&quot;, first broadcast in 1969 in Britain and in many other countries soon afterwards.

Among many honours, Clark was knighted at the unusually young age of thirty-five, and three decades later was made a life peer shortly before the first transmission of &quot;Civilisation&quot;. Three decades after his death, Clark was celebrated in an exhibition at Tate Britain in London, prompting a reappraisal of his career by a new generation of critics and historians. Opinions varied about his aesthetic judgment, particularly in attributing paintings to old masters, but his skill as a writer and his enthusiasm for popularising the arts were widely recognised. Both the BBC and the Tate described him in retrospect as one of the most influential figures in British art of the twentieth century.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Clark was born at 32 Grosvenor Square, London, the only child of Kenneth Mackenzie Clark and his wife, (Margaret) Alice, daughter of James McArthur of Manchester. The Clarks were a Scottish family who had grown rich in the textile trade. Clark&#x27;s great-great-grandfather invented the cotton spool, and the Clark Thread Company of Paisley had grown into a substantial business. Kenneth Clark senior worked briefly as a director of the firm and retired in his mid-twenties as a member of the &quot;idle rich&quot;, as Clark junior later put it: although &quot;many people were richer, there can have been few who were idler&quot;. The Clarks maintained country homes at Sudbourne Hall, Suffolk, and at Ardnamurchan, Argyll, and wintered on the French Riviera. Kenneth senior was a sportsman, a gambler, an eccentric and a heavy drinker. Clark had little in common with his father, though he always remained fond of him. Alice Clark was shy and distant, but her son received affection from a devoted nanny.

As an only child not especially close to his parents, the young Clark had a boyhood that was often solitary, but he was generally happy. He later recalled that he used to take long walks, talking to himself, a habit he believed stood him in good stead as a broadcaster: &quot;Television is a form of soliloquy&quot;. On a modest scale Clark senior collected pictures, and the young Kenneth was allowed to rearrange the collection. He developed a competent talent for drawing, for which he later won several prizes as a schoolboy. When he was seven he was taken to an exhibition of Japanese art in London, which was a formative influence on his artistic tastes; he recalled, &quot;dumb with delight, I felt that I had entered a new world&quot;.

Clark was educated at Wixenford School and, from 1917 to 1922, Winchester College. The latter was known for its intellectual rigour and – to Clark&#x27;s dismay – enthusiasm for sports, but it also encouraged its pupils to develop interests in the arts. The headmaster, Montague Rendall, was a devotee of Italian painting and sculpture; he inspired Clark, among many others, to appreciate the works of Giotto, Botticelli, Bellini and their compatriots. The school library contained the collected writings of John Ruskin, which Clark read avidly, and which influenced him for the rest of his life, not only in their artistic judgments but in their progressive political and social beliefs.

From Winchester, Clark won a scholarship to Trinity College, Oxford, where he studied modern history. He graduated in 1925 with a second-class honours degree. In the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, Sir David Piper comments that Clark had been expected to gain a first-class degree, but had not applied himself single-mindedly to his historical studies: &quot;his interests had already turned conclusively to the study of art&quot;.

While at Oxford, Clark was greatly impressed by the lectures of Roger Fry, the influential art critic who staged the first Post-Impressionism exhibitions in Britain. Under Fry&#x27;s influence he developed an understanding of modern French painting, particularly the work of Paul Cézanne. Clark attracted the attention of Charles F. Bell, Keeper of the Fine Art Department of the Ashmolean Museum. Bell became a mentor to him and suggested that for his B Litt thesis Clark should write about the Gothic revival in architecture. At that time it was a deeply unfashionable subject; no serious study had been published since the nineteenth century. Although Clark&#x27;s main area of study was the Renaissance, his admiration for Ruskin, the most prominent defender of the neo-Gothic style, drew him to the topic. He did not complete the thesis, but later turned his researches into his first full-length book, &quot;The Gothic Revival&quot; (1928). In 1925, Bell introduced Clark to Bernard Berenson, an influential scholar of the Italian Renaissance and consultant to major museums and collectors. Berenson was working on a revision of his book &quot;Drawings of the Florentine Painters&quot;, and invited Clark to help. The project took two years, overlapping with Clark&#x27;s studies at Oxford.

===Early career===

In 1929, as a result of his work with Berenson, Clark was asked to catalogue the extensive collection of Leonardo da Vinci drawings at Windsor Castle. That year he was the joint organiser of an exhibition of Italian painting which opened at the Royal Academy on 1 January 1930. He and his co-organiser Lord Balniel secured masterpieces never seen before outside Italy, many of them from private collections. The exhibition covered Italian art &quot;from Cimabue to Segantini&quot; – from the mid-thirteenth to the late-nineteenth century. It was greeted with public and critical acclaim, and raised Clark&#x27;s profile, but he came to regret the propaganda value derived from the exhibition by the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini who had been instrumental in making so many sought-after paintings available. Several senior figures in the British art world disapproved of the exhibition; Bell was among them, but nevertheless he continued to regard Clark as his favoured successor at the Ashmolean.

Clark was not convinced that his future lay in administration; he enjoyed writing, and would have preferred to be a scholar rather than a museum director. Nonetheless, when Bell retired in 1931 Clark agreed to succeed him as Keeper of the Fine Art Department at the Ashmolean. Over the next two years Clark oversaw the building of an extension to the museum to provide a better space for his department. The development was made possible by an anonymous benefactor, subsequently revealed as Clark himself. His acquisitions while at the Ashmolean included a large piece of mid-19th-century furniture known as the Great Bookcase. Victorian art and architecture were out of fashion in the 1930s, &quot;generally despised and derided&quot;, according to the art historian Matthew Winterbottom, but Clark believed that they should be represented in the collection, although the bookcase was not put on display until 2016. A later curator of the museum wrote that Clark would be remembered for his time there, &quot;when, with his characteristic mixture of arrogance and energy, he transformed both the collections and their display.&quot;

===National Gallery===
In 1933 the director of the National Gallery in London, Sir Augustus Daniel, was aged sixty-seven, and due to retire at the end of the year. His assistant director, W. G. Constable, who had been in line to succeed him, had moved to the new Courtauld Institute of Art as its director in 1932. The historian Peter Stansky writes that behind the scenes the National Gallery &quot;was in considerable turmoil; the staff and the trustees were in a state of continual warfare with each other.&quot; The chairman of the trustees, Lord Lee, convinced the prime minister, Ramsay MacDonald, that Clark would be the best appointment, acceptable to the professional staff and the trustees, and able to restore harmony. When he received MacDonald&#x27;s offer of the post, Clark was not enthusiastic. He thought himself too young, aged 30, and once again felt torn between a scholarly and an administrative career. He accepted the directorship in January 1934, although, as he wrote to Berenson, &quot;in between being the manager of a large department store I shall have to be a professional entertainer to the landed and official classes&quot;.At about the same time as accepting MacDonald&#x27;s offer of the directorship, Clark had declined one from King George V&#x27;s officials to succeed C. H. Collins Baker as Surveyor of the King&#x27;s Pictures. He felt that he could not do justice to the post in tandem with his new duties at the gallery. The king, determined to succeed where his staff had failed, went with Queen Mary to the National Gallery and persuaded Clark to change his mind. The appointment was announced in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; in July 1934; Clark held the post for the next ten years.

Clark believed in making fine art accessible to everyone, and while at the National Gallery he devised many initiatives with this aim in mind. In an editorial, &quot;The Burlington Magazine&quot; said, &quot;Clark put all his insight and imagination into making the National Gallery a more sympathetic place in which the visitor could enjoy a great collection of European paintings&quot;. He had rooms re-hung and frames improved; by 1935 he had achieved the installation of a laboratory and introduced electric lighting, which made evening opening possible for the first time. A programme of cleaning was begun, despite sporadic sniping from those opposed in principle to cleaning old pictures; experimentally, the glass was removed from some pictures. In several years he had the gallery opened two hours earlier than usual on the day of the FA Cup Final, for the benefit of people coming to London for the match.

Clark wrote and lectured during the decade. The annotated catalogue of the royal collection of Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s drawings, on which he had begun work in 1929, was published in 1935, to highly favourable reviews; eighty years later Oxford Art Online called it &quot;a work of firm scholarship, the conclusions of which have stood the test of time&quot;. Another 1935 publication by Clark offended some in the avant-garde: an essay, published in &quot;The Listener&quot;, &quot;The Future of Painting&quot;, in which he rebuked surrealists on the one hand and abstract artists on the other for claiming to represent the future of art. He judged both as too elitist and too specialised – &quot;the end of a period of self-consciousness, inbreeding and exhaustion&quot;. He maintained that good art must be accessible to everyone and must be rooted in the observable world. During the 1930s Clark was in demand as a lecturer, and he frequently used his research for his talks as the basis of his books. In 1936 he gave the Ryerson Lectures at Yale University. From these came his study of Leonardo, published three years later; it too, attracted much praise, at the time and subsequently.

&quot;The Burlington Magazine&quot;, looking back at Clark&#x27;s time at the gallery, singled out among the works acquired under his leadership the seven panels forming Sassetta&#x27;s San Sepolcro Altarpiece from the fifteenth century, four works by Giovanni di Paolo from the same period, Niccolò dell&#x27;Abate&#x27;s &quot;The Death of Eurydice&quot; from the sixteenth century and Ingres&#x27; &quot;Madame Moitessier&quot; from the nineteenth. Other important acquisitions, listed by Piper, were Rubens&#x27;s &quot;Watering Place&quot;, Constable&#x27;s &quot;Hadleigh Castle&quot;, Rembrandt&#x27;s &quot;Saskia as Flora&quot;, and Poussin&#x27;s &quot;The Adoration of the Golden Calf&quot;.

One of Clark&#x27;s least successful acts as director was buying four early-sixteenth century paintings now known as &quot;Scenes from Tebaldeo&#x27;s Eclogues&quot;. He saw them in 1937 in the possession of a dealer in Vienna, and against the united advice of his professional staff he persuaded the trustees to buy them. He believed them to be by Giorgione, whose work he considered inadequately represented in the gallery at the time.{{refn|There are only a handful of attested paintings by Giorgione anywhere in the world. The National Gallery in 2025 has two: &quot;The Adoration of the Kings&quot;, bought in 1884, and {{lang|it|Il Tramonto}} (The Sunset), bought in 1961.|group=n}} The trustees authorised the expenditure of £14,000 of public funds and the paintings went on display in the gallery with considerable fanfare. His staff did not accept the attribution to Giorgione, and within a year scholarly research established the paintings as the work of Andrea Previtali, one of Giorgione&#x27;s minor contemporaries. The British press protested at the waste of taxpayers&#x27; money, Clark&#x27;s reputation suffered a considerable blow, and his relations with his professional team, already uneasy, were further strained.{{refn|Relations between Clark and his subordinates had been tense for some years: two of his senior officials, Harold Kay and Martin Davies, felt their autonomy undermined by what they saw as Clark&#x27;s dictatorial management style.|group= n}}

====Wartime====
The approach of war with Germany in 1939 obliged Clark and his colleagues to consider how to protect the National Gallery&#x27;s collection from bombing raids. It was agreed that all the works of art must be moved out of central London, where they were acutely vulnerable. One suggestion was to send them to Canada for safekeeping, but by this time the war had started and Clark was worried about the possibility of submarine attacks on the ships taking the collection across the Atlantic; he was not displeased when the prime minister, Winston Churchill, vetoed the idea: &quot;Hide them in caves and cellars, but not one picture shall leave this island.&quot; A disused slate mine near Blaenau Ffestiniog in north Wales was chosen as the store. To protect the paintings special storage compartments were constructed, and from careful monitoring of the collection discoveries were made about control of temperature and humidity that benefited its care and display when back in London after the war.
With an empty gallery to preside over, Clark contemplated volunteering for the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, but was recruited, at Lord Lee&#x27;s instigation, into the newly formed Ministry of Information, where he was put in charge of the film division, and was later promoted to be controller of home publicity. He set up the War Artists&#x27; Advisory Committee, and persuaded the government to employ official war artists in considerable numbers. There were up to two hundred engaged under Clark&#x27;s initiative. Those designated &quot;official war artists&quot; included Edward Ardizzone, Paul and John Nash, Mervyn Peake, John Piper and Graham Sutherland. Artists employed on short-term contracts included Jacob Epstein, Laura Knight, L. S. Lowry, Henry Moore and Stanley Spencer.

Although the pictures were in storage, Clark kept the National Gallery open to the public during the war, hosting a celebrated series of lunchtime and early evening concerts. They were the inspiration of the pianist Myra Hess, whose idea Clark greeted with delight, as a suitable way for the building to be &quot;used again for its true purposes, the enjoyment of beauty.&quot; There was no advance booking, and audience members were free to eat their sandwiches and walk in or out during breaks in the performance. The concerts were an immediate and enormous success. &quot;The Musical Times&quot; commented, &quot;Countless Londoners and visitors to London, civilian and service alike, came to look on the concerts as a haven of sanity in a distraught world.&quot; 1,698 concerts were given to an aggregate audience of more than 750,000 people. Clark instituted an additional public attraction of a monthly featured picture brought from storage and exhibited along with explanatory material. The institution of a &quot;picture of the month&quot; was retained after the war, and, at 2025, has continued to the present day.

In 1945, after overseeing the return of the collections to the National Gallery, Clark resigned as director, intending to devote himself to writing. During the war years he had published little. For the gallery he wrote a slim volume about Constable&#x27;s &quot;The Hay Wain&quot; (1944); from a lecture he gave in 1944 he published a short treatise on Leon Battista Alberti&#x27;s &quot;On Painting&quot; (1944). The following year he contributed an introduction and notes to a volume on Florentine paintings in a series of art books published by Faber and Faber. The three publications totalled fewer than eighty pages between them.

===Postwar===

In July 1946 Clark was appointed Slade Professor of Fine Art at Oxford for a three-year term. The post required him to give eight public lectures each year on the &quot;History, Theory, and Practice of the Fine Arts&quot;. The first holder of the professorship had been Ruskin; Clark took as his first subject Ruskin&#x27;s tenure of the post. James Stourton, Clark&#x27;s authorised biographer, judges the appointment to be the most rewarding his subject ever held, and notes how, during this period, Clark established himself as Britain&#x27;s most sought-after lecturer, and wrote two of his finest books, &quot;Landscape into Art&quot; (1947) and &quot;Piero della Francesca&quot; (1951).{{refn|In 1961, by when the appointment was for an annual term, Clark was again Slade Professor at Oxford.|group= n}} By this time Clark no longer hankered after a career in pure scholarship, but saw his role as sharing his knowledge and experience with the wide public.

Clark served on numerous official committees during this period,{{refn|Stourton lists the British Committee on the Preservation and Restitution of Works of Art; the governing council of the Bath Institute of Art; the governing body of the Courtauld; the Council of the Festival of Britain; and the Royal Fine Art Commission.|group= n}} and helped to stage a ground-breaking exhibition in Paris of works by his friend and protégé Henry Moore. He was more in sympathy with modern painting and sculpture than with much of modern architecture. He admired Giles Gilbert Scott, Maxwell Fry, Frank Lloyd Wright, Alvar Aalto and others, but found many contemporary buildings mediocre. Clark had been among the first to conclude that private patronage could no longer support the arts; during the war he had been a prominent member of the state-funded Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts. When it was reconstituted as the Arts Council of Great Britain in 1945 he was invited to serve as a member of its executive committee, and as chairman of the council&#x27;s arts panel.

In 1953 Clark became the Arts Council&#x27;s chairman. He held the post until 1960, but it was a frustrating experience for him; he found himself chiefly a figurehead. Moreover, he was concerned that the way the council went about funding the arts was in danger of damaging the individualism of the artists whom it supported.

===Broadcasting: administrator, 1954–1957===
The year after becoming chairman of the Arts Council, Clark surprised many and shocked some by accepting the chairmanship of the new Independent Television Authority (ITA). It had been set up by the Conservative government to introduce ITV, commercial television, funded by advertising, as a rival to the British Broadcasting Corporation. Many of those opposed to the new broadcaster feared vulgarisation on the lines of American television, and although Clark&#x27;s appointment reassured some, others thought his acceptance of the post a betrayal of artistic and intellectual standards.{{refn|Clark recalled being booed at his London club, the Athenaeum, after the appointment was announced, although some doubt has been cast on the reliability of his memory on this point.|group= n}}

Clark was no stranger to broadcasting. He had appeared on air frequently from 1936, when he gave a radio talk on an exhibition of Chinese Art at Burlington House; the following year he made his television debut, presenting Florentine paintings from the National Gallery. During the war he appeared regularly on BBC radio&#x27;s &quot;The Brains Trust&quot;. While presiding over the new ITA he generally kept off the air, and concentrated on keeping the new network going during its difficult early years. By the end of his three-year term as chairman, Clark was hailed as a success, but privately considered that there were too few high-quality programmes on the network. Lew Grade, who as chairman of Associated Television (ATV) held one of the ITV franchises, felt strongly that Clark should make arts programmes of his own, and as soon as Clark stood down as chairman in 1957, he accepted Grade&#x27;s invitation. Stourton comments, &quot;this was the true beginning of arguably his most successful career – as a presenter of the arts on television&quot;.

===Broadcasting: ITV, 1957–1966===

Clark&#x27;s first series for ATV, &quot;Is Art Necessary?&quot;, began in 1958. Both he and television were finding their way, and programmes in the series ranged from the stiff and studio-bound to a film in which Clark and Henry Moore toured the British Museum at night, flashing their torches at the exhibits. When the series came to an end in 1959, Clark and the production team reviewed and refined their techniques for the next series, &quot;Five Revolutionary Painters&quot;, which attracted a considerable audience. The British Film Institute observes:
{{blockquote|With the television camera strolling among the paintings (by Goya, Breughel, Caravaggio, Van Gogh and Rembrandt) and the urbane, confident Clark conveying his tremendous knowledge in exceptionally clear English, the viewer was treated to the essence of what the painter saw in his creation (not an easy task in the era of black and white television).|}}

By the time in 1960 when he presented a programme about Picasso, Clark had further honed his presentational skills and came across as relaxed as well as authoritative. Two series on architecture followed, culminating in a programme called &quot;The Royal Palaces of Britain&quot; in 1966, a joint venture by ITV and the BBC, described as &quot;by far the most important heritage programme shown on British television to date&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; described Clark as &quot;the ideal man for the job – scholarly, courtly and gently ironical&quot;. &quot;The Royal Palaces&quot;, unlike its predecessors, was shot on 35mm colour film, but transmission was still in black and white, at which Clark chafed. The BBC was by this time planning to broadcast in colour, and his renewed contact with the corporation for this film paved the way for his eventual return to its schedules. In the interim he remained with ITV for a 1966 series, &quot;Three Faces of France&quot;, featuring the works of Courbet, Manet and Degas.

===&quot;Civilisation&quot;, 1966–1969===
{{main|Civilisation (TV series)|}}
{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote= I had no clear idea what &quot;civilisation&quot; meant, but thought it was preferable to barbarism, and fancied that this was the moment to say so.|salign = right|source= Clark on the genesis of &quot;Civilisation&quot;}}
David Attenborough, the controller of the BBC&#x27;s new second television channel, BBC2, was in charge of introducing colour broadcasting to the UK. He conceived the idea of a series about great paintings as the standard-bearer for colour television, and had no doubt that Clark would be much the best presenter for it. Clark was attracted by the suggestion, but at first declined to commit himself. He later recalled that what convinced him that he should take part was Attenborough&#x27;s use of the word &quot;civilisation&quot; to sum up what the series would be about.

The series consisted of thirteen programmes, each fifty minutes long, written and presented by Clark, covering western European civilisation from the end of the Dark Ages to the early twentieth century. As the civilisation under consideration excluded Graeco-Roman, Asian and other historically important cultures, a title was chosen that disclaimed comprehensiveness: &quot;Civilisation: A Personal View by Kenneth Clark&quot;.{{refn|In the book derived from the series Clark wrote, &quot;I didn&#x27;t suppose that anyone would be so obtuse as to think that I had forgotten about the great civilisations of the pre-Christian era and the East. However, I confess the title has worried me. It would have been easy in the eighteenth century: &quot;Speculations on the Nature of Civilisation as illustrated by the Phases of Civilised Life in Western Europe from the Dark Ages to Present Day&quot;. Unfortunately, this is no longer practicable.&quot;|group= n}} Although it focused chiefly on the visual arts and architecture, there were substantial sections about drama, literature, philosophy and socio-political movements. Clark wanted to include more about law and philosophy, but &quot;I could not think of any way of making them visually interesting.&quot;

After initial mutual antipathy, Clark and his principal director, Michael Gill, established a congenial working relationship. They and their production team spent three years from 1966 filming in a hundred and seventeen locations in thirteen countries. The filming was to the highest technical standards of the day, and quickly went over budget; it cost £500,000 by the time it was complete. Attenborough rejigged his broadcasting schedules to spread the cost by transmitting each episode twice in a week.
{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote= Scholars and academics had their understandable quibbles, but for the general public the series was something like a revelation. Art-museum exhibits in both England and the U.S. reported a surge of visitors following each episode.|salign = right|source= &quot;The New Yorker&quot; on &quot;Civilisation&quot;}}

There were complaints, then and later, that by focusing on a traditional choice of the great artists over the centuries – all of them male – Clark had neglected women and presented &quot;a saga of noble names and sublime objects with little regard for the shaping forces of economics or practical politics&quot;. His &quot;modus operandi&quot; was dubbed &quot;the great man approach&quot;, and he described himself on screen as a hero-worshipper and a stick-in-the-mud. He commented that his outlook was &quot;nothing striking, nothing original, nothing that could not have been written by an ordinary harmless bourgeois of the later nineteenth century&quot;:
{{blockquote|I hold a number of beliefs that have been repudiated by the liveliest intellects of our time. I believe that order is better than chaos, creation better than destruction. I prefer gentleness to violence, forgiveness to vendetta. On the whole I think that knowledge is preferable to ignorance, and I am sure that human sympathy is more valuable than ideology.|}}
The broadcaster Huw Wheldon believed that &quot;Civilisation&quot; was &quot;a truly great series, a major work ... the first magnum opus attempted and realised in terms of TV.&quot; There was a widespread view among critics, including some unsympathetic to Clark&#x27;s selections, that the filming set new standards.{{refn|The series was described as &quot;visually stunning&quot; by critics on both sides of the Atlantic, including Paul B. Harvey in the US and Mary Beard in Britain. In 2011 Jonathan Jones wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; of &quot;Civilisation&#x27;s&quot; &quot;sheer visual beauty ... the camerawork and direction ... rise to the poetry of cinema&quot;.|group= n}} &quot;Civilisation&quot; attracted unprecedented viewing figures for a high art series: 2.5 million viewers in Britain and 5 million in the US. Clark&#x27;s accompanying book has never been out of print, and the BBC continued to sell thousands of copies of the DVD set of &quot;Civilisation&quot; every year. In 2016, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; echoed the words of John Betjeman, describing Clark as &quot;the man who made the best telly you&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;.

The British Film Institute notes how &quot;Civilisation&quot; changed the shape of cultural television, setting the standard for later documentary series, from Alastair Cooke&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1972) and Jacob Bronowski&#x27;s &quot;The Ascent of Man&quot; (1973) to the present day.

===Later years: 1970–1983===
Clark made a series of six programmes for ITV. They were collectively titled &quot;Pioneers of Modern Painting&quot;, directed by his son Colin. They were screened in November and December 1971, with a programme on each of Manet, Cezanne, Monet, Seurat, Rousseau and Munch. Although they were shown on commercial television, there were no advertising breaks during each programme. With the aid of a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC acquired copies of the series and distributed them to colleges and universities throughout the US. In 1973 he made &quot;Romantic Art Versus Classic Art&quot; for ITV.

In 1976 Clark returned to the BBC, presenting five programmes about Rembrandt. The series, directed by Colin Clark, considered various aspects of the painter&#x27;s work, from his self-portraits to his biblical scenes. The National Gallery observes about this series, &quot;These art history lectures are an authoritative study of Rembrandt and feature examples of his work from over fifty museums&quot;.

Clark was chancellor of the University of York from 1967 to 1978 and a trustee of the British Museum. During his last ten years he wrote thirteen books. As well as some drawn from his researches for his lectures and television series, there were two volumes of memoirs, &quot;Another Part of the Wood&quot; (1974) and &quot;The Other Half&quot; (1977). He was known throughout his life for his impenetrable façade and enigmatic character, which were reflected in the two autobiographical books: Piper describes them as &quot;elegantly and subtly polished, at times very moving, often very funny [but] somewhat distanced, as if about someone else.&quot;

In his last years Clark suffered from arteriosclerosis. He died on 21 May 1983 at the age of seventy-nine, in a nursing home in Hythe, Kent, after a fall.

==Family and personal life==
In 1927 Clark married a fellow student, Elizabeth Winifred Martin, known as &quot;Jane&quot; (1902–1976), the daughter of Robert Macgregor Martin, a Dublin businessman, and his wife, Emily Winifred Dickson. The couple had three children: Alan, in 1928, and twins, Colette (known as Celly, pronounced &quot;Kelly&quot;) and Colin, in 1932.

Away from his official duties, Clark enjoyed what he described as &quot;the Great Clark Boom&quot; in the 1930s. He and his wife lived and entertained in considerable style in a large house in Portland Place. In Piper&#x27;s words, &quot;the Clarks in joint alliance became stars of London high society, intelligentsia, and fashion, from Mayfair to Windsor&quot;.

The Clarks&#x27; marriage was devoted but stormy. Clark was a womaniser, and although Jane had love affairs, notably with the composer William Walton, she took some of her husband&#x27;s extramarital relationships badly. She suffered severe mood swings and later alcoholism and a stroke. Clark remained firmly supportive of his wife during her decline. The Clarks&#x27; relations with their three children were sometimes difficult, particularly with their elder son, Alan. He was regarded by his father as a fascist by conviction though also as the ablest member of the Clark family &quot;parents included&quot;; he became a Conservative member of parliament and junior minister, and a celebrated diarist. The younger son, Colin, became a film-maker, who among other work directed his father in television series in the 1970s. The twin daughter, Colette, became an official and board member of the Royal Opera House; she outlived her parents and brothers, and was the key source for James Stourton&#x27;s authorised biography of her father, published in 2016.
During the Second World War the Clarks lived at Capo Di Monte, a &quot;cottage&quot; in Hampstead, or rather &quot;three cottages knocked into one&quot;, before moving to the much larger Upper Terrace House nearby. They moved in 1953 when Clark bought the Norman castle of Saltwood in Kent, which became the family home. In his later years he passed the castle to his elder son, moving to a purpose-built house in the grounds.

Jane Clark died in 1976. Her death was expected, but left Clark devastated. Several of his women friends had hopes of marriage to him. His closest female friend, across thirty years, was the photographer Janet Woods, wife of the engraver Reynolds Stone; in common with Clark&#x27;s daughter and sons, she was dismayed when he announced his intention to marry Nolwen de Janzé-Rice, daughter of Frederic and Alice de Janzé. The family felt that Clark was acting precipitately in marrying someone he had not known well for very long, but the wedding took place in November 1977. Clark and his second wife remained together until his death.

===Beliefs===
Clark&#x27;s parents were Liberal in outlook, and Ruskin&#x27;s social and political views influenced the young Clark. Mary Beard wrote in a &quot;Guardian&quot; article that Clark was a lifelong Labour voter. His religious outlook was unconventional, but he believed in the divine, rejected atheism, and found the Church of England too secular in its outlook.{{refn|Clark&#x27;s widow said that her husband always had a profound Christian sensitivity, and that whenever he went into a church in search of works of art he would first kneel and pray.|group= n}} Shortly before his death he was received into the Roman Catholic Church.

==Honours and legacy==
===Awards and memorials===
State and other honours received by Clark included Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1938; Fellow of the British Academy, 1949; Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour, 1959; life peer, 1969;{{refn|As Baron Clark of Saltwood in the County of Kent.|group=n}} Companion of Literature, 1974; and Member of the Order of Merit, 1976. Overseas honours included Commander of the Legion of Honour, France; Commander of the Order of the Lion of Finland; and the Order of Merit, Austria.

Clark was elected a member or honorary member of the Conseil Artistique des Musées Nationaux of France; the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; the American Institute of Architects. the Swedish Academy; the Spanish Academy; the Florentine Academy; the Académie française; and the Institut de France. He was awarded honorary degrees by the universities of Bath, Cambridge, Glasgow, Liverpool, London, Oxford, Sheffield, Warwick, York, and in the US Columbia and Brown universities. He was an honorary fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects and the Royal College of Art. Other honours and awards included Serena Medal of the British Academy (for Italian Studies); the Gold Medal and Citation of Honour of New York University; and the US National Gallery of Art Medal.
Clark&#x27;s old school, Winchester College, holds an annual art history speaking competition for the Kenneth Clark Prize. The winner of the competition is awarded a golden Lord Clark Medal sculpted by a fellow Old Wykehamist, Anthony Smith. At the Courtauld Institute in London, the lecture theatre is named in Clark&#x27;s honour.

===Reputation===
In 2014 the Tate held the &quot;Kenneth Clark: Looking for Civilisation&quot; exhibition, highlighting Clark&#x27;s impact &quot;as one of the most influential figures in British art of the twentieth century&quot;. The exhibition, drawing on works from Clark&#x27;s personal collection and many other sources, examined his role as &quot;a patron and collector, art historian, public servant and broadcaster ... bringing art in the twentieth century to a more popular audience&quot;. The BBC called him &quot;arguably the most influential figure in 20th century British art&quot;. Clark&#x27;s early and continuing insistence that Victorian architecture and art should be considered seriously contributed to a gradual change in public taste. The art historian Ayla Lepine writes that Clark&#x27;s writing and his &quot;perennial commitment to John Ruskin&#x27;s output and significance&quot; made an important contribution to the re-evaluation of Victorian art and architecture.

Clark knew that his broadly traditional view of art would be anathema to the Marxist element in the artistic world, and was unsurprised when he was attacked by younger critics, notably John Berger, in the 1970s. Clark&#x27;s reputation among critics in the twenty-first century is higher for his books and television series than for his consistency as a collector. At the time of the Tate celebration of Clark in 2014, the critic Richard Dorment commented that both in his public and private capacity Clark made many fine purchases but also many errors. In addition to the Andrea Previtali &quot;Scenes from Tebaldeo&#x27;s Eclogues&quot;, Dorment lists works misattributed by Clark to Michelangelo, Pontormo, Elsheimer and Claude, and a Seurat and a Corot that were genuine but poor examples of the artists&#x27; work.

Among his books is what Dorment has called &quot;the best introduction to the art of Leonardo da Vinci ever written&quot;. Piper singles out, in addition to the Leonardo monograph, Clark&#x27;s &quot;Piero della Francesca&quot; (1951), &quot;The Nude&quot; (1956, based on his Mellon lectures in Washington in 1953), and &quot;Rembrandt and the Italian Renaissance&quot; (1966 from his Wrightsman lectures in New York). The critic Jackie Wullschlager wrote in 2014 that it was as a writer rather than a collector that Clark excelled: &quot;unrivalled since Ruskin for lucidity, erudition, moral conviction&quot;. James Hall, in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, expressed a similar view, calling Clark &quot;the most seductive writer on art since Ruskin and Pater ... &quot; In &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of Architecture&quot; James Stevens Curl ranks Clark higher than Ruskin as a writer: &quot;Although he claimed Ruskin was a major influence on his thought, he delivered his own messages with lucidity, elegance, and aplomb, never wallowing in purple prose or exaggeration (faults painfully evident in Ruskin&#x27;s work)&quot;. Hall concludes, &quot;Today, when most art historians write as joylessly as lawyers and accountants, such verve is sorely needed&quot;.

<text>Tacrolimus, sold under the brand name Prograf among others, is an immunosuppressive drug. After allogenic organ transplant, the risk of organ rejection is moderate. To lower the risk of organ rejection, tacrolimus is given. The drug can also be sold as a topical medication in the treatment of T cell-mediated diseases such as eczema and psoriasis. For example, it is prescribed for severe refractory uveitis after a bone marrow transplant, exacerbations of minimal change disease, Kimura&#x27;s disease, and vitiligo. It can be used to treat dry eye syndrome in cats and dogs.

Tacrolimus inhibits calcineurin, which is involved in the production of interleukin-2, a molecule that promotes the development and proliferation of T cells, as part of the body&#x27;s learned (or adaptive) immune response.

Chemically, it is a macrolide lactone that was first discovered in 1987, from the fermentation broth of a Japanese soil sample that contained the bacterium &quot;Streptomyces tsukubensis&quot;. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. In 2021, it was the 296th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 500,000 prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
===Organ transplantation===
It has similar immunosuppressive properties to ciclosporin, but is much more potent. Immunosuppression with tacrolimus was associated with a significantly lower rate of acute rejection compared with ciclosporin-based immunosuppression (30.7% vs 46.4%) in one study. Clinical outcome is better with tacrolimus than with ciclosporin during the first year of liver transplantation. Long-term outcome has not been improved to the same extent. Tacrolimus is normally prescribed as part of a post-transplant cocktail including steroids, mycophenolate, and IL-2 receptor inhibitors such as basiliximab. Dosages are titrated to target blood levels at specific times after medication administration.

===Skin===

As an ointment, tacrolimus is used in the treatment of dermatitis (eczema), in particular atopic dermatitis, if topical corticosteroids and moisturisers fail in helping. It suppresses inflammation in a similar way to steroids, and is equally as effective as a mid-potency steroid. An important advantage of tacrolimus is that, unlike steroids, it does not cause skin thinning (atrophy), or other steroid related side effects.

It is applied on the active lesions until they heal off, but may also be used continuously in low doses (twice a week), and applied to the thinner skin over the face and eyelids. Clinical trials of up to one year have been conducted. Recently it has also been used to treat segmental vitiligo in children, especially in areas on the face.

===Eyes===
Tacrolimus solution, as drops, is sometimes prescribed by veterinarians for keratoconjunctivitis, and other dry eye maladies, in the eyes of domestic cats, dogs, and horses. It has been studied for use in human eyes.

==Contraindications and precautions==
Contraindications and precautions include:
* Hepatic disease
* Immunosuppression
* Infants
* Infection
* Neoplastic disease, such as:
** Skin cancer
** Lung cancer
* Oliguria
* Pregnancy
* QT interval prolongation
* Sunlight (UV) exposure
* Grapefruit juice

===Topical use===
* Occlusive dressing
* Known or suspected malignant lesions
* Netherton&#x27;s syndrome or similar skin diseases
* Certain skin infections

==Side effects==
===By mouth or intravenous use===
Side effects can be severe and include infection, cardiac damage, hypertension, blurred vision, liver and kidney problems (tacrolimus nephrotoxicity), hyperkalemia, hypomagnesemia, hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus, itching, lung damage (sirolimus also causes lung damage), and various neuropsychiatric problems such as loss of appetite, insomnia, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, confusion, weakness, depression, vivid nightmares, cramps, neuropathy, seizures, tremors, and catatonia.

In addition, it may potentially increase the severity of existing fungal or infectious conditions such as herpes zoster or polyoma viral infections.

====Carcinogenesis and mutagenesis====
In people receiving immunosuppressants to reduce transplant graft rejection, an increased risk of malignancy (cancer) is a recognised complication. The most common cancers are non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma and skin cancers. The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of treatment.

===Topical use===
The most common adverse events associated with the use of topical tacrolimus ointments, especially if used over a wide area, include a burning or itching sensation on the initial applications, with increased sensitivity to sunlight and heat on the affected areas. Less common are flu-like symptoms, headache, cough, and burning eyes.

====Cancer risks====

Tacrolimus and a related drug for eczema (pimecrolimus) were suspected of carrying a cancer risk, though the matter is still a subject of controversy. The FDA issued a health warning in March 2005 for the drug, based on animal models and a small number of patients. Until further human studies yield more conclusive results, the FDA recommends that users be advised of the potential risks. However, current practice by UK dermatologists is not to consider this a significant real concern and they are increasingly recommending the use of these new drugs. A 2023 systematic review and meta-analysis published in The Lancet Child &amp; Adolescent Health concluded with moderate-certainty evidence that the two drugs were not associated with any increased risk of cancer.

== Interactions ==

Also like cyclosporin, it has a wide range of interactions. Tacrolimus is primarily metabolised by the cytochrome P450 system of liver enzymes, and there are many substances that interact with this system and induce or inhibit the system&#x27;s metabolic activity.

Interactions include that with grapefruit which increases tacrolimus plasma concentrations. As infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the post-transplant patient, the most commonly reported interactions include interactions with anti-microbial drugs. Macrolide antibiotics including erythromycin and clarithromycin, as well as several of the newer classes of antifungals, especially of the azole class (fluconazole, voriconazole), increase tacrolimus levels by competing for cytochrome enzymes.

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===

Tacrolimus is a macrolide calcineurin inhibitor. In T cells, activation of the T cell receptor normally increases intracellular calcium, which acts via calmodulin to activate calcineurin. Calcineurin then dephosphorylates the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT), which moves to the nucleus of the T cell and increases the activity of genes coding for IL-2 and related cytokines. Tacrolimus prevents the dephosphorylation of NF-AT.

In detail, tacrolimus reduces peptidylprolyl isomerase activity by binding to the immunophilin FKBP12 (FK506 binding protein), creating a new complex. This FKBP12–FK506 complex interacts with and inhibits calcineurin, thus inhibiting both T lymphocyte signal transduction and IL-2 transcription. Although this activity is similar to that of cyclosporin, the incidence of acute rejection is reduced by tacrolimus use over cyclosporin use. Although short-term immunosuppression concerning patient and graft survival is found to be similar between the two drugs, tacrolimus results in a more favorable lipid profile, and this may have important long-term implications given the prognostic influence of rejection on graft survival.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Oral tacrolimus is slowly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, with a total bioavailability of 20 to 25% (but with variations from 5 to 67%) and highest blood plasma concentrations (Cmax) reached after one to three hours. Taking the drug together with a meal, especially one rich in fat, slows down resorption and reduces bioavailability. In the blood, tacrolimus is mainly bound to erythrocytes; only 5% are found in the plasma, of which more than 98.8% are bound to plasma proteins.

The substance is metabolized in the liver, mainly via CYP3A, and in the intestinal wall. All metabolites found in the circulation are inactive. Biological half-life varies widely and seems to be higher for healthy persons (43 hours on average) than for patients with liver transplants (12 hours) or kidney transplants (16 hours), due to differences in clearance. Tacrolimus is predominantly eliminated via the faeces in form of its metabolites.

When applied locally on eczema, tacrolimus has little to no bioavailability.

===Pharmacogenetics===
The predominant enzyme responsible for metabolism of tacrolimus is CYP3A5. Genetic variations within &quot;CYP3A5&quot; that result in changes to the activity of the CYP3A5 protein can affect concentrations of tacrolimus within the body. In particular, individuals who are homozygous for the G allele at the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs776746 (also known as CYP3A5 *3/*3) have a non-functional CYP3A5 protein. The frequency of the G allele varies worldwide, from 4% in some African populations to 80–90% in Caucasian populations. Across a large number of studies, individuals homozygous for the G allele have been shown to have higher concentrations of tacrolimus and require lower doses of the drug, as compared to individuals who are not homozygous for the G allele. Achieving target concentrations of tacrolimus is important – if levels are too low, then there is a risk of transplant rejection, if levels are too high, there is a risk of drug toxicities. There is evidence to suggest that dosing patients based on rs776746 genotype can result in faster and more frequent achievement of target tacrolimus levels. However, there is a lack of consistent evidence as to whether dosing based on rs776746 genotype results in improved clinical outcomes (such as a decreased risk for transplant rejection or drug toxicities), likely because patients taking tacrolimus are subject to therapeutic drug monitoring.

Studies have shown that genetic polymorphisms of genes other than CYP3A5, such as NR1I2 (encoding PXR), also significantly influence the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus.

==History==
Tacrolimus was discovered in 1987; it was among the first macrolide immunosuppressants discovered, preceded by the discovery of rapamycin (sirolimus) on Rapa Nui (Easter Island) in 1975. It is produced by a soil bacterium, &quot;Streptomyces tsukubensis&quot;. The name tacrolimus is derived from &quot;Tsukuba macrolide immunosuppressant&quot;.

The early development (investigational new drug phase) of tacrolimus, called at the time by the development code FK-506, happened in the next several years. A firsthand account of that process is given in Thomas Starzl&#x27;s 1992 memoir.

Tacrolimus was first approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1994, for use in liver transplantation; the indications were extended to include kidney transplants. Generic versions of tacrolimus were approved in the US in 2017.

Tacrolimus was approved for medical use in the European Union in 2002, for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. In 2007, the indications were expanded to include the prophylaxis of transplant rejection in adult kidney or liver allograft recipients and the treatment of allograft rejection resistant to treatment with other immunosuppressive medicinal products in adults. In 2009, the indications were expanded to include the prophylaxis of transplant rejection in adult and paediatric, kidney, liver or heart allograft recipients and the treatment of allograft rejection resistant to treatment with other immunosuppressive medicinal products in adults and children.

==Available forms==
A branded version of the drug is owned by Astellas Pharma, and is sold under the brand name Prograf, given twice daily. A number of other manufacturers hold marketing authorisation for alternative brands of the twice-daily formulation.

Once-daily formulations with marketing authorisation include Advagraf (Astellas Pharma) and Envarsus (marketed as Envarsus XR in US by Veloxis Pharmaceuticals and marketed in Europe by Chiesi). These formulations are intended to reduce pharmacokinetic variation in blood levels and facilitate compliance with dosing.

The topical formulation is marketed by LEO Pharma under the name Protopic.

==Biosynthesis==

The biosynthesis of tacrolimus is hybrid synthesis of both type 1 polyketide synthases (PKS 1) and nonribosomal peptide syntheses (NRPS). The research shows the hybrid synthesis consists of ten modules of type 1 polyketide synthase and one module of nonribosomal peptide synthase. The synthetic enzymes for tacrolimus are found in 19 gene clusters named fkb. The 19 genes are fkbQ, fkbN, fkbM, fkbD, fkbA, fkbP, fkbO, fkbB, fkbC, fkbL, fkbK, fkbJ, fkbI, fkbH, fkbG, allD, allR, allK and allA.

There are several possible ways of biosynthesis of tacrolimus. The fundamental units for biosynthesis are following: one molecule of 4,5-dihydroxycyclohex-1-enecarboxylic acid (DHCHC) as a starter unit, four molecules of malonyl-CoA, five molecules of methylmalonyl-CoA, one molecule of allylmalonyl-CoA as elongation units. However, two molecules of malonyl-CoA are able to be replaced by two molecules of methoxymalonyl CoA. Once two malonyl-CoA molecules are replaced, post-synthase tailoring steps are no longer required where two methoxymalonyl CoA molecules are substituted. The biosynthesis of methoxymalonyl CoA to Acyl Carrier protein is proceeded by five enzymes (fkbG, fkbH, fkbI, fkbJ, and fkbK). Allylmalonyl-CoA is also able to be replaced by propionylmalonyl-CoA.

The starter unit, DHCHC from the chorismic acid is formed by fkbO enzyme and loaded onto CoA-ligase domain (CoL). Then, it proceeds to NADPH dependent reduction(ER). Three enzymes, fkbA,B,C enforce processes from the loading module to the module 10, the last step of PKS 1. fkbB enzyme is responsible of allylmalonyl-CoA synthesis or possibly propionylmalonyl-CoA at C21, which it is an unusual step of general PKS 1. As mentioned, if two methoxymalonyl CoA molecules are substituted for two malonyl-CoA molecules, they will take place in module 7 and 8 (C13 and C15), and fkbA enzyme will enforce this process. After the last step (module 10) of PKS 1, one molecule of -pipecolic acid formed from -lysine and catalyzed through fkbL enzyme synthesizes with the molecule from the module 10. The process of -pipecolic acid synthesis is NRPS enforced by fkbP enzyme. After synthesizing the entire subunits, the molecule is cyclized. After the cyclization, the pre-tacrolimus molecule goes through the post-synthase tailoring steps such as oxidation and &quot;S&quot;-adenosyl methionine. Particularly fkbM enzyme is responsible of alcohol methylation targeting the alcohol of DHCHC starter unit (Carbon number 31 depicted in brown), and fkbD enzyme is responsible of C9 (depicted in green). After these tailoring steps, the tacrolimus molecule becomes biologically active.

== Research ==
===Lupus nephritis===
Tacrolimus has been shown to reduce the risk of serious infections while also increasing remission of kidney function in lupus nephritis.

===Ulcerative colitis===
Tacrolimus has been used to suppress the inflammation associated with ulcerative colitis (UC), a form of inflammatory bowel disease. Although almost exclusively used in trial cases only, tacrolimus has shown to be significantly effective in the suppression of flares of UC. A 2022 updated Cochrane systematic review found that tacrolimus may be superior to placebo in achieving remission and improvement in UC.

<text>Dame Penelope Anne Constance Keith (&quot;née&quot; Hatfield; born 2 April 1940) is an English actress and presenter, active in film, radio, stage and television and primarily known for her roles in the British sitcoms &quot;The Good Life&quot; and &quot;To the Manor Born&quot;. She succeeded Lord Olivier as president of the Actors&#x27; Benevolent Fund after his death in 1989, and was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2014 New Year Honours for services to the arts and to charity.

Keith joined the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1963, and went on to win the 1976 Olivier Award for Best Comedy Performance for the play &quot;Donkeys&#x27; Years&quot;. She became a household name in the UK playing Margo Leadbetter in the sitcom &quot;The Good Life&quot; (1975–78), winning the 1977 BAFTA TV Award for Best Light Entertainment Performance.

In 1978 Keith won the BAFTA TV Award for Best Actress for &quot;The Norman Conquests&quot;. She then starred as Audrey fforbes-Hamilton in the sitcom &quot;To the Manor Born&quot; (1979–81), a show that received audiences of more than 20 million. She went on to star in another six sitcoms, including &quot;Executive Stress&quot; (1986–88), &quot;No Job for a Lady&quot; (1990–92) and &quot;Next of Kin&quot; (1995–97). Since 2000, she has worked mainly in the theatre, with her roles including Madam Arcati in &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; (2004) and Lady Bracknell in &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; (2007).

==Early life==
Penelope Anne Constance Hatfield was born in Sutton, Surrey in 1940. Her father, an army officer who was a Major by the end of the Second World War, left her mother, Connie, when Keith was a baby, and she spent her early years in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex and Clapham, south London. Her great uncle, John Gurney Nutting, was a partner in the coachbuilding firm of J Gurney Nutting &amp; Co Limited, and Keith recalls sitting in the Prince of Wales&#x27;s car.

Although not a Roman Catholic, at the age of six she was sent to a Catholic convent boarding school run by French nuns in Seaford, East Sussex, with Judy Cornwell. Here she became interested in acting, and she frequently went to matinées in the West End with her mother. When she was eight years old, her mother remarried and she adopted her stepfather&#x27;s surname, Keith. Whilst she did not get on with her stepfather, her mother was a &quot;rock of love&quot; to her. She was rejected by the Central School of Speech and Drama on the grounds that at 5&#x27;10&quot; (1.78 m) she was too tall. However she was then accepted at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art and spent two years there while working at the Hyde Park Hotel in the evenings.

Keith began her career working in repertory theatre around Britain, including Lincoln, Manchester, and Salisbury. Keith&#x27;s earliest appearances were in &quot;The Tunnel of Love&quot;, &quot;Gigi&quot;, and &quot;Flowering Cherry&quot;. In 1963, she joined the Royal Shakespeare Company and acted with them in Stratford and at the Aldwych Theatre in London.

<text>The Indianapolis 500, formally known as the Indianapolis 500-Mile Race, and commonly shortened to Indy 500, is an annual automobile race held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana, United States, an enclave suburb of Indianapolis. The event is traditionally held over Memorial Day weekend, usually the last weekend of May. It is contested as part of the IndyCar Series, the top level of American open-wheel car racing, a formula colloquially known as &quot;Indy car racing&quot;. The track itself is nicknamed the &quot;Brickyard&quot;, as the racing surface was first paved in brick in the fall of 1909. One yard of brick remains exposed at the start/finish line. The event, billed as &quot;The Greatest Spectacle in Racing&quot;, is considered part of the Triple Crown of Motorsport along with the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the Monaco Grand Prix, with which it typically shares a date.

The inaugural race was held in 1911 and was won by Ray Harroun. The event celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2011, and the 100th running was held in 2016. The event was put on hiatus twice, from 1917 to 1918 due to World War I and from 1942 to 1945 due to World War II. In two different periods, the race was part of FIA World Championships; between 1925 and 1928, the World Manufacturers&#x27; Championship and between 1950 and 1960, the World Drivers&#x27; Championship.

Josef Newgarden, the winner in 2023–2024, is the reigning champion. The most successful drivers are A. J. Foyt, Al Unser Sr., Rick Mears and Hélio Castroneves, each of whom has won the race four times. The active driver with the most victories is Castroneves. Rick Mears holds the record for most career pole positions with six. The most successful car owner is Roger Penske, owner of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Team Penske, which has 20 total wins and 18 poles. Penske also has five wins at the IndyCar Grand Prix, held on the combined road course.

The event is steeped in tradition, in pre-race ceremonies, post-race celebrations, and race procedure. The most noteworthy and most popular traditions are the 33-car field lining up three-wide for the start, the annual singing of the chorus of &quot;Back Home Again in Indiana&quot;, and the victory lane bottle of milk. Also unique is that qualifying requires the driver to complete four, rather than one, timed laps, and the time trials are conducted on a separate weekend. The official attendance is not disclosed by Speedway management, but the permanent seating capacity is upwards of 250,000, and infield patrons raise the total race-day attendance to a range of approximately 300,000–350,000.

== History ==

===Early years===
The Indianapolis Motor Speedway complex was built in 1909 as a gravel-and-tar track and hosted a smattering of small events, including ones for motorcycles. The first long-distance event, in &quot;fearful conditions&quot;, was the 100-lap Prest-O-Lite Trophy in 1909, won by Bob Burman in a Buick. The breakup of the track surface led to two fatal accidents in the first two long-distance events (a and , which was shortened to after two severe wrecks).

The fact that these spectacles had attracted 15,000 paying customers (and crowds of up to 40,000) persuaded principal owner Carl G. Fisher to spend $155,000 on repaving the track with 3.2 million bricks; he also added a concrete wall around the track&#x27;s circumference. During the 1910 Decoration Day weekend, the first events on the newly paved circuit drew 60,000 spectators; Ray Harroun won the Wheeler-Schebler Trophy in a Marmon.

The crowds grew progressively smaller for the rest of the season, however, so the track owners chose to focus on a single race, and considered a 24-hour contest, in the fashion of Le Mans, or a event. They decided on , the estimated distance a race car could run before dark descended on the track, and a spectacular purse of $25,000, equivalent to of pure gold. The combination allowed the track to rapidly acquire a privileged status for automobile races.

The first &quot;500&quot; was held at the Speedway in 1911 on Decoration Day, May 30, (as it was known from its inception in 1868 to 1967, when federal law made &quot;Memorial Day&quot; the official name), run to a maximum engine size formula. It saw a field of 40 starters, with Harroun piloting a Marmon Model 32-based &quot;Wasp&quot; racer—outfitted with his invention, the rear-view mirror. Harroun (with relief from Cyrus Patschke) was declared the winner, although Ralph Mulford protested the official result. Eighty thousand spectators were in attendance, and an annual tradition had been established. Many considered Harroun to be a hazard during the race, as he was the only driver in the race driving without a riding mechanic, who checked the oil pressure and let the driver know when traffic was coming.

In 1912, the purse was raised to $50,000, the field was limited to 33 (where it remains), and a riding mechanic was made mandatory. This second event was won by Joe Dawson in a National, after Ralph DePalma&#x27;s Mercedes broke. Although the first race was won by an American driver at the wheel of an American car, European makers such as the Italian Fiat or French Peugeot companies soon developed their vehicles to try to win the event, which they did from 1912 to 1919. The 1913 event saw a change to a maximum engine size.

After World War I, the native drivers and manufacturers regained their dominance of the race, and engineer Harry Miller set himself up as the most competitive of the post-war builders. His technical developments allowed him to be indirectly connected to a history of success that would last into the mid-1970s.

For musical entertainment before the start of the race, the Purdue All-American Marching Band has been the host band of the race since 1919. In 1946, American operatic tenor and car enthusiast James Melton started the tradition of singing &quot;Back Home Again in Indiana&quot; with the Purdue Band before the race when asked to do so on the spur of the moment by Speedway president Tony Hulman. This tradition has continued through the years, notably by actor and singer Jim Nabors from 1972 until 2014. Nabors announced in 2014, citing health-related reasons, that the 2014 Indy 500 would be the last at which he would sing the song. In 2015, the a cappella group Straight No Chaser sang the song before the race, and in the two races held after Nabors&#x27; retirement (and before he became the regular singer), the singing of the song was done on a rotating basis, with the Spring 2014 winner of &quot;The Voice&quot; Josh Kaufman performing in 2016. However, the Speedway has returned to a standard singer with Jim Cornelison doing it since 2017.

===Miller and Offenhauser===
Following the European trends, engine sizes were limited to during 1920–1922, for 1923–1925, and in 1926–1929. The 1920 race was won by Gaston Chevrolet in a Frontenac, prepared by his brothers, powered by the first eight-cylinder engine to win the 500. For 1923, riding mechanics were no longer required. A supercharged car, ID, first won the race in 1924. In 1925, Pete DePaolo was the first to win at an average over , with a speed of .

In the early 1920s, Miller built his 3.0-liter (183 in3) engine, inspired by the Peugeot Grand Prix engine which had been serviced in his shop by Fred Offenhauser in 1914, installing it in Jimmy Murphy&#x27;s Duesenberg and allowing him to win the 1922 edition of the race. Miller then created his own automobiles, which shared the &#x27;Miller&#x27; designation, which, in turn, were powered by supercharged versions of his 2.0- and 1.5-liter (122 and 91 in3) engine single-seaters, winning four more races for the engine up to 1929 (two of them, 1926 and 1928, in Miller chassis). The engines powered another seven winners until 1938 (two of them, 1930 and 1932, in Miller chassis), then ran at first with stock-type motors before later being adjusted to the international 3.0-liter formula.

After purchasing the Speedway in 1927, Eddie Rickenbacker prohibited supercharging and increased the displacement limit to , while also re-introducing the riding mechanic.

In 1935, Miller&#x27;s former employees, Fred Offenhauser and Leo Goossen, had already achieved their first win with the soon-to-become famous 4-cylinder Offenhauser or &quot;Offy&quot; engine. This motor was forever connected with the Brickyard&#x27;s history with a to-date record total of 27 wins, in both naturally aspirated and supercharged form, and winning a likewise record-holding 18 consecutive years between 1947 and 1964.

===European incursions and links to Formula One===
Meanwhile, European manufacturers, gone from the Indianapolis 500 for nearly two decades, made a brief return just before World War II, with the competitive Maserati 8CTF allowing Wilbur Shaw to become the first driver to win consecutively at Indianapolis, in 1939 and 1940. With the 500 having been a part of the World Drivers&#x27; Championship between 1950 and 1960, Ferrari made a discreet appearance at the 1952 event with Alberto Ascari, but European entries were few and far between during those days. Among the Formula One drivers who did drive at the speedway was five-time world champion Argentinian Juan Manuel Fangio, though he failed to qualify for the 1958 race.

It was not until the Indianapolis 500 was removed from the World Championship calendar that European entries made their return. In 1963, technical innovator Colin Chapman brought his Team Lotus to Indianapolis for the first time, attracted by the large monetary prizes, far bigger than the usual at a European event. Racing a mid-engined car, Scotsman Jim Clark was second in his first attempt in 1963, dominated in 1964 until suffering suspension failure on lap 47, and completely dominated the race in 1965, a victory which also interrupted the success of the Offy, and giving the 4.2-liter Ford V8 its first success at the race. The following year, 1966, saw another British win, this time Graham Hill in a Lola-Ford.

The Offenhauser engine was also paired with a European maker, McLaren, obtaining three wins for the chassis, one with the Penske team in 1972 with driver Mark Donohue, and two for the McLaren works team in 1974 and 1976 with Johnny Rutherford. This was also the last time the Offy would win a race, its competitiveness steadily decreasing until its final appearance in 1983. American drivers continued to fill the majority of entries at the Brickyard in the following years, but European technology had taken over. Starting in 1978, most chassis and engines were European, with the only American-based chassis to win during the CART era being the Wildcat and Galmer (which was technically built in Bicester, England) in 1982 and 1992, respectively. Ford and Chevrolet engines were built in the UK by Cosworth and Ilmor, respectively.

As of 2023, the most recent active Formula One driver to have entered the 500 is Fernando Alonso, who drove in the 2017 race. Alonso was the first Formula One driver to enter the 500 since Teo Fabi in 1984.

===World Series===
After foreign cars became the norm, foreign drivers began competing in the Indianapolis 500 regularly, choosing the United States as their primary base for their motor racing activities. Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi, Italian Teo Fabi, and Colombian Roberto Guerrero were able to obtain good outings in the 1980s, as was Dutchman Arie Luyendyk. In 1993, reigning Formula One World Champion Nigel Mansell shocked the racing world by leaving Formula One for CART. While he came in only third in the 500, he won the 1993 CART championship. Foreign-born drivers became a regular fixture of Indianapolis in the years to follow. Despite the increase in foreign drivers commonly being associated with the CART era, three of the first six Indianapolis 500 winners were non-American drivers.

===Centennial Era===

In 2009, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway began a three-year-long &quot;Centennial Era&quot; to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the opening of the track (1909), and the 100th anniversary of the first Indy 500 (1911). As a gesture to the nostalgic &quot;Centennial Era&quot; celebration (2009–2011), tickets for the 2009 race donned the moniker &quot;93rd 500 Mile International Sweepstakes&quot;. It is the first time since 1980 that the &quot;Sweepstakes&quot; title has been used. In May 2009, the ordinal (93rd) was used very sparingly, and for the first time since 1981, was not identified on the annual logo. Instead, in most instances in print, television, and radio, the race was referred to as the &quot;2009 Indianapolis 500&quot;. Since the race was not held during the United States&#x27; participation in the two World Wars (1917–1918, 1942–1945), the advertised Centennial Era occurred during the 93rd to 95th runnings. To avoid confusion between the 100th anniversary, and the actual number of times the race has been run, references to the ordinal during the &quot;Centennial Era&quot; were curtailed.

In the 2014 meeting, the road course became part of the race meeting for the first time. The GMR Grand Prix road course event, and the three upper tiers of Road to Indy, participated in road course events at the Speedway during the first week of activities.

Six years later, in 2016, the race celebrated its 100th running with about 350,000 in attendance.

Four local actors were hired to portray the Founding Four of James Allison, Carl Fisher, Frank Wheeler, and Arthur Newby during multiple Centennial Era events and the 100th race. Harold Hefner (Allison), Tom Harrison (Fisher), Jeff Angel (Wheeler), and Matthew Allen (Newby).

In 2020, the race was delayed for the first time from its usual Memorial Day running to August due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There was no audience in attendance, so as to comply with pandemic guidelines. The road course race was moved to the NASCAR weekend in July (which led to an IndyCar road course race added to the NASCAR weekend permanently in 2021), and the support races on the road course moved to its own September weekend. As races were cancelled because of local restrictions, the Speedway added two more road course races in October as part of the Intercontinental GT Challenge meeting, where attendance was capped to 10,000 per event.

In 2024, the race was delayed for over four hours due to heavy rain and thunderstorms in the area.

===Race name===
The race was originally advertised as the &quot;International 500-Mile Sweepstakes Race&quot; from 1911 to 1916. However, from its inception, the race has been widely known as the Indianapolis 500 or, more simply &quot;the 500&quot;, as for many years, it was the only noteworthy auto race of such distance. In 1919, the race was referred to as the &quot;Liberty Sweepstakes&quot; following WWI. From 1920 to 1980, the race officially reverted to the &quot;International Sweepstakes&quot; moniker, as printed on the tickets and other paraphernalia, with slight variations over the years.

Following WWII, the race was commonly recognized as &quot;The 500&quot;, &quot;The 500-Mile Race&quot;, &quot;Indianapolis 500-Mile Race&quot;, &quot;Indianapolis 500&quot;, or the simple form &quot;Indy 500&quot;. Usually the ordinal (e.g. &quot;50th&quot;) preceded it. Often the race was also advertised on the radio as the &quot;Annual Memorial Day race&quot;, or similar variations. By the late 20th century, the term &quot;Indy 500&quot; had slowly emerged as the most common and most popularly used moniker. As such, since 2016, the official race logo has used the contemporary and colloquial term &quot;Indy 500&quot;.

For the 1981 race, the name &quot;65th Indianapolis 500-Mile Race&quot; was officially adopted, with all references as the &quot;International Sweepstakes&quot; dropped. Since 1981, the race has been formally advertised in this fashion, complete with a unique annual logo with the ordinal almost always included. Around that same time, in the wake of the 1979 entry controversy, and the formation of CART, the race changed to an invitational event, rather than an Open, rendering the &quot;sweepstakes&quot; description inappropriate.

For nearly a century, the race eschewed any sort of naming rights or title sponsor, a move, though uncommon in the modern sports world, that was well received by fans. This tradition finally ended in 2016 when a presenting sponsor, PennGrade, was added for the first time. In the 21st century, the facility has also slowly added sponsorship ads on the retaining walls and infield grass. The ESPN-produced ABC telecast of the event did not recognize this sponsorship and instead had Firestone Tires as its presenting sponsorship.

The Borg-Warner Trophy, introduced in 1936, proclaims the event as the &quot;Indianapolis 500-Mile Race&quot;, with no reference at all to the name &quot;International Sweepstakes&quot;.

==Race specifics==
The Indianapolis 500 is held annually at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, a oval circuit. The track is a rounded rectangle, with four distinct turns of identical dimensions, connected by four straightaways (two long straightaways and two &quot;short chutes&quot;). Traditionally, the field consists of 33 starters, aligned in a starting grid of eleven rows of three cars apiece. Drivers race 200 laps, counter-clockwise around the circuit, for a distance of . Since its inception in 1911, the race has always been scheduled on or around Memorial Day. Since 1974, the race has been specifically scheduled for the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend. The Sunday of Memorial Day weekend is widely considered one of the most important days on the motorsports calendar, as it is the day of the Indianapolis 500, the Coca-Cola 600, and (usually) the Monaco Grand Prix. Practice and time trials are held in the two weeks leading up to the race, while miscellaneous preliminary testing is held as early as April.

The race is the most prestigious event of the IndyCar calendar, and one of the oldest and most important automobile races. It has been reported to be the largest single-day sporting event in the world. Likewise, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway itself is regarded as the world&#x27;s largest sporting facility in terms of capacity. The total purse exceeded $13 million in 2011, with over $2.5 million awarded to the winner, making it one of the richest cash prize funds in sports.

Similar to NASCAR&#x27;s Daytona 500, the Indianapolis 500 is typically held early in the IndyCar Series season. That is unique to most sports where major events are usually at the end of the respective season. Currently, the Indy 500 is the sixth event of the 17-race IndyCar schedule. From the 1970s to the 1990s, Indianapolis was often the second or third race of the season, and as late as the 1950s, it was sometimes the first championship event of the year. Due to the high prestige of the Indianapolis 500—rivaling or even surpassing the season championship—it is not uncommon for some teams and drivers to focus heavily on preparing for that race during the early part of the season, and not focus fully on the championship battle until after Indy.

Due to safety issues such as aquaplaning, the race is not held in wet conditions. In the event of a rain delay, the race will be postponed until rain showers cease, and the track is sufficiently dried. If rain falls during the race itself, officials will halt the race (red flag) and await safe conditions. The officials can end the race and declare the results official if more than half of the scheduled distance (i.e., 101 laps) has been completed. If less than half the distance has been completed, the race must be resumed and achieve at least the 101-lap distance in order to be official. A primary limiting factor is available daylight, as the track does not have lighting. If the race is halted and cannot be resumed before sunset, the resumption will be scheduled for the next possible day.

The Indianapolis 500, as well as other IndyCar Series races, does not utilize the green–white–checker finish in case of a late-race yellow. The race can be (and has at times) finished under caution. However, officials may call for a late-race red flag (in lieu of a lengthy yellow) to provide an opportunity for a green-flag finish, an option that was used in 2014, 2019, 2022, and 2023. The circuit lacks lights, therefore lateness can become a factor in the cases of lengthy delays.

=== Car ===
The event is contested by &quot;Indy cars&quot;, a formula of professional-level, single-seat, open cockpit, open-wheel, purpose-built race cars. As of 2020, all entrants utilize 2.2L V6, twin-turbocharged engines, tuned to produce a range of . Chevrolet and Honda are the current engine manufacturers involved in the sport. Dallara is at present the sole chassis supplier to the series. Firestone, which has a deep history in the sport, dating back to the first 500, is currently the exclusive tire provider.

=== Field ===
The traditional 33-car starting field at Indianapolis is larger than the fields at the other IndyCar races. The field at Indy typically consists of all of the full-time IndyCar Series entries (roughly 20–22 cars), along with roughly 10–15 part-time or &quot;Indy-only&quot; entries. The &quot;Indy-only&quot; entries, also known as &quot;One-offs&quot;, may be an extra car added to an existing full-time team, or a part-time team altogether that does not enter any of the other races, or enters only a few selected races. The &quot;Indy-only&quot; drivers may come from a wide range of pedigrees but are usually experienced Indy car competitors who either lack a full-time ride, are former full-time drivers who have elected to drop down to part-time status, or occasional one-off drivers from other racing disciplines. It is not uncommon for some drivers (particularly former Indy 500 winners) to quit full-time driving during the season, but race solely at Indy for numerous years afterward before entering full retirement.

===Technical regulations===
Technical specifications for the Indianapolis 500 are currently written by IndyCar. Rules are generally the same as every other IndyCar race. In the past, particularly during the era in which USAC sanctioned the Indy 500 (but CART sanctioned the other Indy car races), rules at Indy slightly differed at times. The result, for example, would be a particular chassis or engine configuration being legal at Indy, but not so at the CART-sanctioned events. This was rather commonplace in the 1980s and early 1990s, when &quot;stock-block&quot; engines (namely the V-6 Buick) were allotted an increased level of turbocharger boost by USAC at Indy, compared to the purpose-built V-8 quad-cam engines. While the &quot;stock block&quot; engines were technically legal in CART competition, they were not given the increased boost advantage, which effectively rendered them uncompetitive, and precluded their use by teams. The most famous manifestation of the USAC rules disparity was the Ilmor-built Mercedes-Benz 500I engine fielded by Roger Penske in 1994.

Teams may enter up to two machines under a given car number—the &quot;primary&quot; car and a &quot;backup&quot; car. The backup car is identified by the letter &quot;T&quot;. For example, the two cars for the #2 team would be numbered #2 and #2T. Both cars may be practiced during the month, but due to engine lease rules, they must share the same engine. It is not uncommon for teams to prefer their backup car, if it is deemed faster, or for other strategic reasons. Additionally, as the month wears on, a &quot;T car&quot; may be split off into a separate entry, and reassigned a new number, or be sold to another team.

All cars must pass a rigorous technical inspection before receiving a sticker signifying that the car is eligible to practice. Various criteria include minimum weight, dimensions, and approved parts, particularly safety equipment. Before and after qualification attempts, cars must pass another inspection. The pre-qualifying inspection is focused on safety aspects and is done on the pit lane qualifying queue. It is relatively brief, due to the time constraints of the qualifying procedure. The post-qualifying inspection is much more stringent and lengthy, taking place in the garage area. It is to detect deviations from the performance guidelines set forth by the league, and cars can and have been fined or outright disqualified if they fail inspection.

During the race, work on the car is permitted, but it is usually limited to routine pit stop work (changing tires and refueling) and minor adjustments (wing angles, etc.) Pit stop activity is rigorously rehearsed by the crews and in modern times, routine pits stops are regularly completed in under ten seconds. Other more involved work, such as replacing damaged bodywork (wings, nose cones, etc.), can also be completed quickly by the crews. More lengthy repairs are allowed, and since 1998 teams are permitted to return to the garage area to make repairs. However, there are limitations to the extent of repair work allowed and the practicality of such work. Teams are not allowed to change engines, and since 1933 a rule has been in place where teams are not allowed to add oil. In addition, the officials designate a certain lap after which off-track cars being serviced/repaired are no longer permitted to return to the race.

===Qualifying procedure===

Throughout the years, the race has used several different qualifying procedures. The current four-lap (ten-mile) qualifying distance was first introduced in 1920 and has been used every year since 1939.

Presently, qualifying occurs on over two days. On Day 1, positions 13–30 (or 13–33 if there are only 33 entries) have their position set with all other positions set on Day 2. Following Fast Friday practice, all cars are entered into a blind draw for the qualifying order.

*Saturday: All entries are guaranteed at least one attempt to qualify and can make additional attempts if time permits. At the end of the session, the fastest twelve drivers advance to a &quot;shootout&quot; session held on the next day to determine pole position and the first four rows of the grid. As mentioned above, drivers who qualify 10th–30th have their spots locked in and will not re-qualify. Drivers who qualify 31st and lower advance to a separate &quot;shootout&quot; session also held on the next day to determine the final three spots on the grid. For re-attempts, there are two lanes: Lane 2 is known as the &quot;no risk lane&quot; and drivers can keep their previous time if their second (or subsequent) run is slower. Lane 1 is known as the &quot;priority lane&quot;, and no cars from lane 2 are allowed on track unless lane 1 is empty. However, to re-qualify in lane 1 you must withdraw any previous times, regardless if the attempt is slower than a previous one.
*Sunday: The drivers who qualified 31st and lower from Saturday have their original times erased. There is one 75 minute session. Each driver gets one guaranteed attempt and can make additional attempts if time permits. Drivers who qualify 31st–33rd have their positions locked in. Drivers who finish 34th and lower fail to qualify. The fastest twelve drivers from Saturday take part in a second round of qualifying, with the top six advancing to the Firestone Fast Six. The qualifying order is based on the times from Saturday&#x27;s session from slowest to fastest. Once again, the times from Saturday are erased and each driver is given only one attempt, locking in positions 7–12. Following a cool down period, including all cars taking slow cool down laps on track behind the pace/safety car, the remaining six drivers get one final attempt. The fastest driver wins the highly coveted pole position and the remaining five drivers have their positions locked in based on their times.

For each attempt, cars are allowed two warm-up laps. At that time, a member of the team is stationed at the north end of the main stretch. He or she must wave a green flag, signaling an attempt, or else the car will be waved off. The attempt can be waved off during any of the four laps by the team, driver, or race officials. (The series will wave off the run if it is obvious the run will not be fast enough to qualify and it is getting late in the day.) If an attempt is waved off after the run starts, the attempt counts and the previous time is still forfeited unless race officials waved off the attempt because of weather. Weather can and often does affect qualifying and can result in last-minute format changes.

==Race sanctioning==
===AAA and USAC===
From 1911 to 1955, the race was organized under the auspices of the AAA Contest Board. Following the 1955 Le Mans disaster, AAA dissolved the Contest Board to concentrate on its membership program aimed at the general motoring public. Speedway owner Tony Hulman founded USAC in 1956, which took over sanctioning of the race and the sport of Championship racing.

From 1950 to 1960, the Indianapolis 500 also counted toward the FIA&#x27;s World Championship of Drivers (now synonymous with Formula One), although few drivers participated in the other races of that series. Italian driver Alberto Ascari was the only European-based driver to race in the 500 during its World Championship years. His appearance in 1952 in a Ferrari was also the only time a Ferrari has ever appeared in the race. Juan Manuel Fangio practiced at the track in 1958 but declined an offer to race.

Control issues of monetary prizes and squabbles over technical regulations caused conflict in the 1970s. Soon after the death of Tony Hulman in 1977, and the loss of several key USAC officials in a 1978 plane crash, several key team owners banded together and formed CART in late 1978 to sanction the sport of Indy car racing.

The Indianapolis 500 itself, however, remained under the sanctioning control of USAC. It became the lone top-level race the body still sanctioned, as it ultimately dropped all other Indy car races (as well as their stock car division) to concentrate on sprints and midgets. For the next three years, the race was not officially recognized on the CART calendar, but the CART teams and drivers comprised the field. By 1983, an agreement was made for the USAC-sanctioned Indy 500 to be recognized on the CART calendar and the race awarded points towards the CART championship.

Despite the CART/USAC divide, from 1983 to 1995 the race was run in relative harmony. CART and USAC occasionally quarreled over relatively minor technical regulations but utilized the same machines and the CART-based teams and driver comprised the bulk of the Indy 500 entries each year.

===IndyCar Series===
In 1994, Speedway owner Tony George announced plans for a new series, to be called the Indy Racing League, with Indy 500 as its centerpiece. George announced that he intended to reverse the tide of dramatic cost increases, the decreasing number of ovals in the CART series, and to allow for more opportunity for drivers from USAC sprint-car ranks. Detractors accused George of using the 500 as leverage to allow the Speedway to gain complete control of the sport of open-wheel racing in the United States.

In response to CART&#x27;s 1996 schedule that put several races in direct conflict with the first Indy Racing League events, George announced that 25 of the 33 starting positions at the 1996 Indy 500 would be reserved for the top 25 cars in IRL points standings. This effectively left eight starting positions open to the CART-regulars that chose not to participate in the IRL races and would be the first time that not all 33 spots were open for qualification in the history of the race. CART refused to compromise on the schedule conflicts, skip the IRL races required to accumulate the qualifying points, boycott the race, and stage a competing event, the U.S. 500, on the same day at Michigan. Veteran Buddy Lazier won a competitive but crash-filled 1996 Indy 500. Two CART teams, Walker Racing and Galles Racing, competed in the Indianapolis 500 to fulfill sponsor obligations and were welcomed without incident. The U.S. 500, meanwhile was marred by a crash on the pace laps that forced ten teams to use backup cars.

For 1997, new rules for less expensive cars and &quot;production-based&quot; engines were put into place. The move made it such that the IRL utilized different and incompatible equipment from CART; no CART-based teams would enter the Indy 500 for the next three years. CART would run a 300-mile race Gateway International Raceway on the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend from 1997 to 1999 to avoid a conflict.

In 2000, Target Chip Ganassi Racing, still a CART-mainstay, decided to compete at Indianapolis with drivers Jimmy Vasser and Juan Pablo Montoya. On race day, Montoya dominated the event, leading 167 of the 200 laps to victory. In 2001, Penske Racing returned and won the race with driver Hélio Castroneves. Penske and Castroneves repeated with a win in 2002.

By 2003, Ganassi, Penske and Andretti Green defected to the IRL permanently. CART went bankrupt later in the year, and its rights and infrastructure were purchased by remaining car owners, and it became the Champ Car World Series. The two series continued to operate separately through 2007. In early 2008, the two series were unified to create a single open-wheel championship after a 12-year split being run under Indy Racing League/IMS control—known as the IndyCar Series.

The 2012 race was the return of Turbocharged engines for the first time since 1996 with the use of the Dallara DW12 chassis and 2.2 L V-6 single-turbo and twin-turbocharged engines.

==NASCAR and the 500==
In the 1960s and early 1970s, the Indy 500 and the World 600 (now known as the Coca-Cola 600) at Charlotte Motor Speedway were held on different days of the week. A handful of NASCAR regulars participated in both events in the same year, including Bobby Allison, Donnie Allison, Cale Yarborough, and Lee Roy Yarbrough. From 1974 to 1992, the two events were scheduled for the same day and same starting time, making participation in both impossible. A few stock car drivers during that time, namely Neil Bonnett in 1979, nevertheless still attempted to qualify at Indy, even if that meant skipping Charlotte altogether.

===&quot;Double Duty&quot;===

From 1994 to 2014, several NASCAR drivers were able to compete in both the Indy 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte on the same day. Since 1993, the Coca-Cola 600 has been scheduled in the evening the same day as the Indy 500. The effort has been known as &quot;Double Duty&quot;.

After the Indy 500, drivers would catch a helicopter directly from the Speedway to Indianapolis International Airport. From there they would fly to Concord Regional Airport, and ride a helicopter to the NASCAR race. John Andretti, Tony Stewart, and Robby Gordon attempted the feat, with Kyle Larson being the latest in 2024. In 2001, Tony Stewart became the first driver to complete the full race distance (1,100 miles) in both races on the same day.

For 2005, the start of Indianapolis was pushed back to 1 p.m. EDT to improve television ratings. This significantly closed the window for a driver to be able to race both events on the same day. (The race&#x27;s original starting time had been set at 11 a.m. EST to 12 noon EDT—because in 1911, race promoters estimated it would take six hours to complete the event, and they did not want the race to finish too close to dinnertime. Nowadays, the race is routinely completed in under three-and-a-half hours.)

Two drivers, Mario Andretti and A. J. Foyt, have won the Indianapolis 500 and the Daytona 500. Foyt also won the 24 Hours of Daytona and 12 Hours of Sebring, America&#x27;s premier endurance races, as well as the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Foyt won Le Mans in 1967, about one month after winning his third Indy 500. Andretti won the Formula One World Championship and is a three-time Sebring winner (he also won the 6-hour version of Daytona). Indianapolis 500 winner Johnny Rutherford once won one of the Daytona 500 qualifying races. In 2010, Chip Ganassi became the first car owner to win the Daytona and Indianapolis 500s in the same year, with Jamie McMurray winning the Daytona 500 and Dario Franchitti winning the Indianapolis 500.

In 2010, Bruton Smith (owner of Speedway Motorsports, Inc.), offered $20 million to any driver, IndyCar or NASCAR, who can win both the Indianapolis 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 on the same day starting in 2011, a feat that had never been accomplished. For 2011, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway moved the start time of the Indy 500 back to 12:15 PM EDT (prior to 2005, the engines started at 10:52 AM EST; under the modern schedule, engines start around 12:05 PM for a start around 12:15 PM), which re-opened the window for travel. Brad Keselowski suggested that he would consider answering the challenge in 2014. It was announced on March 4, 2014, that Kurt Busch would attempt to qualify for the 2014 Indianapolis 500, driving a fifth car for the Andretti Autosport team. Busch completed all 500 miles at Indy to finish sixth but dropped out of the 600 with a blown engine just past the 400-mile mark. In 2024, Kyle Larson attempted, but could not complete the double, racing with Arrow McLaren in the 500 and intending to drive with Hendrick Motorsports in the 600. Kyle Larson finished 18th in the Indianapolis 500 and arrived part way through the Coke Zero 600 due to a four hour rain delay at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The 600 was red flagged for a thunderstorm shortly after Larson arrived at the track and was not restarted, with Larson not being able to participate.

For 2019, NBC Sports and the Speedway changed the start time. The engines started at 12:38 PM for a start time of 12:45 PM.

==Culture==
===Memorabilia===
Many people promote and share information about the Indianapolis 500 and its memorabilia collecting. The National Indy 500 Collectors Club is an independent active organization that has been dedicated to supporting such activities. The organization was established January 1, 1985, in Indianapolis by its founder John Blazier and includes an experienced membership available for discussion and advice on Indy 500 memorabilia trading and Indy 500 questions in general.

The longest-running Indy racing memorabilia show is the National Auto Racing Memorabilia Show.

===Entertainment===

The Indianapolis 500 has been the subject of several films and has been referenced many times in television, movies, and other media.

===Milk===
Louis Meyer requested a glass of buttermilk after winning his second Indy 500 race in 1933. After winning his third title in 1936, he requested another glass but instead received a bottle. He was captured by a photographer in the act of swigging from the bottle while holding up three fingers to signify the third win. A local dairy company executive recognized the marketing opportunity in the image and, being unaware Meyer was drinking buttermilk, offered a bottle of milk to the winners of future races. Milk has been presented each year since then, apart from 1947 to 1955. Modern drivers are offered a choice of whole, 2%, and skim.

At the 1993 Indianapolis 500, winner Emerson Fittipaldi, who owned and operated an orange grove, notoriously drank orange juice instead of milk during the televised winner&#x27;s interview. He eventually relented and also drank from the milk bottle later in the post-race ceremonies after the broadcast was over, but the public relations damage had already been done. The snub led to Fittipaldi being booed during driver introductions at the next race on the schedule, held at the Milwaukee Mile in Wisconsin, a state known for its dairy industry. Some continued to boo Fittipaldi as late as 2008, in which he drove the pace car.

In 2016, as a promotion, the track gave out commemorative bottles of milk to 100,000 attendees to toast the winner with milk after the race.

=== Female drivers ===

Female participation of any sort at Indianapolis was discouraged and essentially banned throughout the first several decades of competition. As such, female reporters were not even allowed in the pit area until 1971. There have been nine female drivers to qualify, starting with Janet Guthrie in 1977.

Sarah Fisher has competed nine times, the most of any woman. Danica Patrick holds the best finish (3rd) for a woman and is the only woman to have led laps during the race. Katherine Legge is the most recent woman to have competed in the race (2024), and holds the fastest one-lap (231.627 mph) and four-lap (231.070 mph) qualification speeds for a woman in the history of the race.

==Broadcasting==
Radio coverage of the race dates back to 1922. The race has been broadcast live on the radio in its entirety by the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network since 1953.

The Hulmans did not allow live television coverage of the 500 until 1986, largely to maximize gate attendance. The race was briefly televised live in 1949 and 1950 on WFBM-TV (today&#x27;s WRTV), after which the practice was discontinued. From 1964 to 1970, the race was broadcast live on closed-circuit television in theaters around the country. From 1965 through 1970, a highlighted version of the race was shown on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot;. From 1971 through 1985, an edited same-day, tape delay broadcast of the race was shown in prime time. The race broadcast was edited down to either two or three hours in duration (including commercials).

From 1986 through 2018, ABC televised the race live in its entirety. However Indianapolis affiliate WRTV was required by the Speedway to blackout the national broadcast, and instead carry it on tape delay to encourage local race attendance. In 1992 the tape-delay broadcast was pushed forward to Sunday evenings.

In 2007 (the first year in which the race was carried under the ESPN on ABC branding), the race was first aired in high-definition. In 2016, the IMS declared a sell-out of race tickets for the 100th running of the event, meaning that WRTV would be allowed to air the race live for the first time since 1950.

Under the live coverage arrangement, the Indianapolis affiliate of the network airing the race airs that day&#x27;s programming in a transposed arrangement, with network primetime programming airing during the race and transmitted to the affiliate in advance (for instance in 2019, WTHR aired the season finale of the NBC primetime series &quot;Good Girls&quot; at 2 p.m. local time), while the race airs on tape delay in prime time.

Coverage of time trials on ABC dates back to 1961. ABC covered time trials in various live and in tape-delayed formats from 1961 to 2008 and from 2014 to 2018. ESPN (and later along with ESPN2) carried various portions of time trials from 1987 to 2008. Versus covered time trials from 2009 to 2013. Practice sessions have been streamed live online dating back to at least 2001.

In 2019, coverage of the Indianapolis 500 moved to NBC, as part of a new three-year contract that unifies the IndyCar Series&#x27; television rights with NBC Sports (the parent division of its current cable partner NBCSN), and replaces the package of five races broadcast by ABC with an eight-race package on NBC. The Indianapolis 500 is one of the eight races; this contract ended ABC&#x27;s 54-year tenure as broadcaster of the race. WTHR is now the local broadcaster of the race under this contract; the existing blackout policy remains, though speedway officials have left the door open to allowing WTHR to air the race live in the event of a sellout. In contrast with the usual sell-out policy, in 2020, the race aired live on WTHR, as the Speedway ran the first three meetings (NASCAR in July, the Indianapolis 500 in August, and Road to Indy in September) behind closed doors as a result of COVID-19 cases in the state (the third INDYCAR meeting, the October road course races, admitted 10,000 spectators each day). The race was also shown live in 2021 on WTHR due to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway&#x27;s restricted capacity amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. WPBI-LD2 in Lafayette also blacks out live coverage of the race as although Lafayette is its own television market, Indianapolis stations are easily accessible (and outside of Lafayette&#x27;s CBS affiliate, were the only stations available to Lafayette viewers until the mid-2010s). The first day of qualifying is no longer broadcast on television and only available through streaming.

In 2022, the race was able to be viewed live within Central Indiana and Lafayette; however, it was only available on the Peacock streaming service and was not available live on WTHR or WPBI-DT2. The race aired on tape delay as normal.

In 2024, the race was televised live within Central Indiana on WTHR due to inclement weather causing significant delays. This lifting occurred as a convenience to those fans who changed their plans and were no longer planning to return to the track. The blackout lifting was announced around 2:30pm ET by IMS President Doug Boles.

Fox Sports will take over rights to IndyCar, including the Indianapolis 500, beginning in 2025. The Speedway will continue to enforce the live broadcast blackout on Indianapolis Fox affiliate WXIN, along with WPBI-LD1 in Lafayette.

<text>In graph theory, a tree decomposition is a mapping of a graph into a tree that can be used to define the treewidth of the graph and speed up solving certain computational problems on the graph.

Tree decompositions are also called junction trees, clique trees, or join trees. They play an important role in problems like probabilistic inference, constraint satisfaction, query optimization, and matrix decomposition.

The concept of tree decomposition was originally introduced by . Later it was rediscovered by and has since been studied by many other authors.

==Definition==
Intuitively, a tree decomposition represents the vertices of a given graph as subtrees of a tree, in such a way that vertices in are adjacent only when the corresponding subtrees intersect. Thus, forms a subgraph of the intersection graph of the subtrees. The full intersection graph is a chordal graph.

Each subtree associates a graph vertex with a set of tree nodes. To define this formally, we represent each tree node as the set of vertices associated with it.
Thus, given a graph , a tree decomposition is a pair , where is a family of subsets (sometimes called &quot;bags&quot;) of , and is a tree whose nodes are the subsets , satisfying the following properties:

# The union of all sets equals . That is, each graph vertex is associated with at least one tree node.
# For every edge in the graph, there is a subset that contains both and . That is, vertices are adjacent in the graph only when the corresponding subtrees have a node in common.
# If and both contain a vertex , then all nodes of the tree in the (unique) path between and contain as well. That is, the nodes associated with vertex form a connected subset of . This is also known as coherence, or the &quot;running intersection property&quot;. It can be stated equivalently that if , and are nodes, and is on the path from to , then formula_1.

The tree decomposition of a graph is far from unique; for example, a trivial tree decomposition contains all vertices of the graph in its single root node.

A tree decomposition in which the underlying tree is a path graph is called a path decomposition, and the width parameter derived from these special types of tree decompositions is known as pathwidth.

A tree decomposition of treewidth is &quot;smooth&quot;, if for all formula_2, and for all formula_3.

==Treewidth==

The &quot;width&quot; of a tree decomposition is the size of its largest set minus one. The treewidth of a graph is the minimum width among all possible tree decompositions of . In this definition, the size of the largest set is diminished by one in order to make the treewidth of a tree equal to one. Treewidth may also be defined from other structures than tree decompositions, including chordal graphs, brambles, and havens.

It is NP-complete to determine whether a given graph has treewidth at most a given variable .
However, when is any fixed constant, the graphs with treewidth can be recognized, and a width tree decomposition constructed for them, in linear time. The time dependence of this algorithm on is an exponential function of .

==Dynamic programming==
At the beginning of the 1970s, it was observed that a large class of combinatorial optimization problems defined on graphs could be efficiently solved by non-serial dynamic programming as long as the graph had a bounded &quot;dimension&quot;, a parameter related to treewidth. Later, several authors independently observed, at the end of the 1980s, that many algorithmic problems that are NP-complete for arbitrary graphs may be solved efficiently by dynamic programming for graphs of bounded treewidth, using the tree-decompositions of these graphs.

As an example, consider the problem of finding the maximum independent set in a graph of treewidth . To solve this problem, first choose one of the nodes of the tree decomposition to be the root, arbitrarily. For a node of the tree decomposition, let be the union of the sets descending from . For an independent set formula_4 let denote the size of the largest independent subset of such that formula_5 Similarly, for an adjacent pair of nodes and , with farther from the root of the tree than , and an independent set formula_6 let denote the size of the largest independent subset of such that formula_7 We may calculate these and values by a bottom-up traversal of the tree:
:formula_8
:formula_9
where the sum in the calculation of formula_10 is over the children of node .

At each node or edge, there are at most sets for which we need to calculate these values, so if is a constant then the whole calculation takes constant time per edge or node. The size of the maximum independent set is the largest value stored at the root node, and the maximum independent set itself can be found (as is standard in dynamic programming algorithms) by backtracking through these stored values starting from this largest value. Thus, in graphs of bounded treewidth, the maximum independent set problem may be solved in linear time. Similar algorithms apply to many other graph problems.

This dynamic programming approach is used in machine learning via the junction tree algorithm for belief propagation in graphs of bounded treewidth. It also plays a key role in algorithms for computing the treewidth and constructing tree decompositions: typically, such algorithms have a first step that approximates the treewidth, constructing a tree decomposition with this approximate width, and then a second step that performs dynamic programming in the approximate tree decomposition to compute the exact value of the treewidth.

<doc id="159024" wikidata="Q3109117" url="?curid=159024" title="Michael Atherton">
<text>Michael Andrew Atherton (born 23 March 1968) is a broadcaster, journalist and a former England international cricketer. A right-handed opening batsman for Lancashire and England, and occasional leg-break bowler, he achieved the captaincy of England at the age of 25 and led the side in a then record 54 Test matches. Known for his stubborn resistance during an era of hostile fast bowling, Atherton was described in 2001 as a determined defensive opener who made &quot;batting look like trench warfare&quot;. He had several famed bouts with bowlers including South Africa&#x27;s Allan Donald and Australia&#x27;s Glenn McGrath. Atherton often played the anchor role at a time when England batting performances lacked consistency.

His playing career included controversy, including ball tampering, and several brushes with the media with whom, by Atherton&#x27;s own admission, he did not have a good understanding when he was a player. Often hampered by a chronic back complaint which was to contribute to the end of his career, Atherton was considered a leading England batsman during the 1990s. Following retirement he became a journalist and is a cricket commentator with Sky Sports, and chief cricket correspondent of &quot;The Times&quot;.

==Early career==
Atherton was born in Failsworth, Lancashire, England. His family includes several known sportspeople, such as his father Alan, a former Manchester United reserve central defender in the 1960s.

As a youth, he captained the Manchester Grammar School cricket team, for whom he scored almost 3,500 runs and took 170 wickets. His performances led to selection for the England under-19 team, which he captained aged 16. He also represented Lancashire Schools from 1982 to 1986. In 1983 he won the Jack Hobbs Memorial Award as the Outstanding Schoolboy Cricketer at under-15 level. In a (non-first-class) match against the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1984 he took 6–27.

Entering Downing College, Cambridge, to read History, he was selected at 18 to play for Cambridge University Cricket Club and awarded a blue. A year later he made 73 on his county debut for Lancashire, scoring his maiden first-class hundred against Derbyshire a fortnight later. During this time he represented his university, the Combined Universities cricket team (which he captained to the quarter finals of the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup in 1989) and his county. This early rise through the ranks, and extensive leadership experience earned him the nickname &quot;FEC&quot;, which is thought to have stood for &quot;future England captain&quot;. In his autobiography &quot;Opening Up&quot;, Atherton is candid about the fact that there are more colourful alternatives for &quot;FEC&quot;; the second word being &quot;educated&quot;; as suggested by his teammates at the time.

==International career==
Atherton&#x27;s heady rise continued when he made his debut for England in the fifth test of 1989 against Australia at Trent Bridge, where he scored 0 and 47. Atherton&#x27;s chance came when several England players announced their decision to go on a rebel tour to South Africa and so were banned from the Test team. Despite these defections, he was selected as vice-captain of the 1989–90 A-team tour to Zimbabwe rather than for the West Indies tour. He learned that he would make his debut when captain David Gower threw a plastic bag of England caps and sweaters at him.

Atherton returned to the England side in the summer of 1990, partnering Graham Gooch at the top of the order and giving the first demonstration of his abilities at international level. In his first innings after recall, and his first opening the batting for England, he scored 151 against New Zealand. He shared an opening partnership of 204 with Gooch against India at Lord&#x27;s, in the match famous for Gooch&#x27;s scores of 333 and 123, as well as further big opening partnerships in the next two Tests, and Test centuries against New Zealand and India earned him the title of Young Cricketer of the Year.

During the winter of 1990–91, Atherton faced a sterner test on the Ashes tour of Australia. Although he made a century in the third Test at Sydney, which would prove to be his only century in an Ashes Test, he averaged just 31 for his 279 runs, and England lost 3–0. Atherton struggled against the West Indies in 1991 and missed the 1992 Cricket World Cup and tour of New Zealand with fitness problems, but was recalled to the Test team in the summer of 1992.

When Australia arrived for the 1993 Ashes series, Atherton&#x27;s place in the team was not assured. However, a consistent summer, during which he scored six 50s in six Tests (including 99 at Lord&#x27;s), cemented his place in the side at a fortunate time. Graham Gooch, frustrated by continual losses against Australia, resigned as captain after the fourth Test and Atherton, aged just 25, replaced him. He lost his first match in charge but England managed to beat Australia in a morale-boosting final Test; England had not beaten Australia in the previous 18 Test matches.

Atherton&#x27;s first tour as captain, to the West Indies in the winter of 1993–94, was not a success as England lost 3–1. This was a series of highs and lows: Brian Lara of the West Indies compiled a world-record 375 against them at Antigua; England were bowled out for 46 to lose the third Test (and with it the series) but then roared back at Bridgetown to win the fourth Test thanks to two centuries from Alec Stewart. For his part, Atherton was the best of the English batsmen, scoring 510 runs at an average of 56.67.

Earning plaudits for his determination and leadership, Atherton followed up with two centuries in the three-match series at home against New Zealand. His reputation suffered a blow when he was implicated in a ball-tampering controversy during the first Test against South Africa at Lord&#x27;s, for which he was fined £2,000 by Ray Illingworth. Atherton was accused of lying to Peter Burge, the match referee. Atherton claims in his autobiography that he answered &quot;no&quot; when asked if he had anything in his pockets. He believed that Burge was referring to nefarious substances such as resin or lip salve. Nonetheless the TV pictures were damning, showing Atherton deliberately putting dirt, taken from the pitch, on the ball. Strictly speaking, Atherton was not breaking the laws – he pointed out that plenty of bowlers improve their grip on the ball by rubbing their hands on the pitch.

After this incident Atherton and England headed to Headingley for the second Test. Atherton played one of his best innings, grinding out 99 before being caught and bowled by Brian McMillan. Atherton stated that this innings was the best answer he could have given to the &quot;gutter press&quot;. He led England to a win in the third Test at the Oval, which tied the series, although he failed to score a century.
After winning against South Africa, Atherton faced the supreme test of his leadership: an Ashes tour to Australia. His form stood well, with 407 runs at 40.7, but he was unable to convert any of his four half-centuries in the Test series into a hundred. Although England had a thrilling win at Adelaide, England&#x27;s first Test victory in Australia for eight years, the team stumbled to a 1–3 loss. There was also controversy in the drawn Sydney test when England&#x27;s Graeme Hick was approaching what would have been his only Ashes Test hundred. According to &quot;Wisden&quot;: &quot;In what was thought to be the last-but-one over of the innings, Hick, on 98, blocked three successive balls, and Atherton lost patience and ungenerously declared; he had batted far more slowly himself&quot;.

The next two years followed a similar pattern. Although a draw in a Test series against the West Indies in 1995 and victory in Test series at home against India and away against New Zealand suggested that England were improving, the team continued to struggle against the talent of Australia and Pakistan. Although Atherton led England to victory in the first test of the 1997 Ashes at Birmingham, England&#x27;s only victory in an Ashes Test that was not a dead rubber between 1986 and 2005, England lost the series 3-2. England also crashed out of the 1996 Cricket World Cup after defeat to eventual champions Sri Lanka, controversy also ensuing during this tournament after a defeat when Atherton&#x27;s irritated observation about a local journalist was picked up on tape. The lack of consistent progress and the effect of a back ailment contributed to Atherton&#x27;s decision to resign after five years as captain after a defeat in the West Indies in 1997-8.

Atherton continued to play Test cricket for a further four years before retiring at the end of the 2001 Ashes. However, plagued by his chronic back condition, he did not manage to attain his previous levels of performance. Highlights of his later career however included man of the match-winning Test centuries at the Oval and Karachi in 2000, in Tests which ensured England rare Test series victories respectively against the West Indies (their first for 31 years), and Pakistan (their first for 18 years).

Atherton&#x27;s finest performances came when he had his back against the wall. Notable examples include his monumental 185 not out in 643 minutes to salvage a draw against South Africa, and his negation of an outstanding Allan Donald onslaught in 1998. This doggedness prompted Steve Waugh to dub him &quot;The Cockroach&quot;, but his record against Australia was modest. He averaged under thirty, with only one century in 33 tests. and he was dismissed 19 times by Glenn McGrath, the Australian opening bowler, a record for any bowler against one batsman.

Alongside McGrath, two other world-class bowlers frequently tormented Atherton, with Courtney Walsh dismissing him seventeen times and Shane Warne ten times. As well as being seen as struggling against the very best, Atherton has the dubious honour of having the lowest batting average of any player to have scored 6,000 or more runs in Test cricket. He was also dismissed for nought on twenty occasions at Test level, which was an English record at the time of his retirement.

===International centuries===
During his career Atherton made eighteen centuries in international cricket, sixteen of which were scored in Test matches while the other two came in One Day Internationals. In Tests, thirteen of his centuries came in the first innings and three in the second innings.

==Post-playing career==

Since his retirement from the game, Atherton has carved out a successful career in the media. He was a journalist for &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; and succeeded Christopher Martin-Jenkins as &quot;The Times&quot; cricket correspondent on 1 May 2008.

Between 2002 and 2005, he was a member of the Channel 4 commentary team for the coverage of Test cricket in England. During this period he also worked as a commentator for BBC Radio and Talksport on Test matches outside England. Atherton joined the Sky Sports commentary team in 2005, after they won the rights to live Test cricket in England, joining long-time England teammate Nasser Hussain, their former England coach David &quot;Bumble&quot; Lloyd and former England captain David Gower. He commentates on all forms of the game, home and abroad, as well as covering some domestic matches. He often performs as the post-match master of ceremonies for internationals in England, presenting awards and interviewing players.

In 2002 he produced his autobiography: &quot;Opening Up&quot;. He has also written &quot;Gambling: A Story of Triumph and Disaster&quot;, published in 2006.

In March 2010, he won Sports Journalist of the Year, at the British Press Awards. The judges announced this was &quot;a unanimous choice&quot;, praised the former England cricket captain for &quot;tackling subjects way beyond cricket&quot; and said &quot;the brilliance of his writing shines.&quot; He was named the Sports Writer of the Year by the Sports Journalists&#x27; Association in 2009 and 2011.

He was one of the commentators in 2011 Cricket World Cup. He has gained fame for his no nonsense but dryly humorous views on cricket.

==Personal life==
Atherton is married to Isabelle De Caires (granddaughter of West Indies test cricketer Frank De Caires), hailing from Guyana. Atherton&#x27;s elder son, Josh de Caires, signed a professional contract with Middlesex in 2020, and made his first-class debut for Middlesex in July 2021.

==Health==
Atherton suffers from the degenerative condition ankylosing spondylitis, which meant he could not duck under bouncers, but had to stand tall and sway out of the way. Allan Donald used this against him by bowling short.

<text>Mathilde Laetitia Wilhelmine Bonaparte, Princesse Française, [[Prince of San Donato|Princess of San Donato]] (27 May 1820 – 2 January 1904), was a French princess and salonnière. She was a daughter of Napoleon&#x27;s brother Jérôme Bonaparte and his second wife, Catharina of Württemberg, daughter of King Frederick I of Württemberg.

== Biography ==

Born in Trieste on 27 May 1820, Mathilde Bonaparte was raised in Florence and Rome. She was originally engaged to her first cousin, the future Napoleon III of France, but the engagement was cancelled following his imprisonment at Ham. She married a rich Russian nobleman, Anatoly Nikolaievich Demidov, 1st Prince of San Donato, on 1 November 1840 in Rome. Anatole was raised to the position of &quot;Prince&quot; by Grand Duke Leopold II of Tuscany shortly before the wedding to fulfill the wishes of Mathilde&#x27;s father and to preserve Mathilde&#x27;s position as &quot;Princess&quot;. Anatole&#x27;s princely title was never recognised in Russia. They had no children.

The marriage between these two strong and prominent personalities was stormy. Prince Demidov insisted on keeping his mistress, Valentine, Duchess of Dino, which of course was fiercely resisted by Mathilde. In 1846, Mathilde fled the household for Paris with her new lover Émilien de Nieuwerkerke and with Anatole&#x27;s jewelry. The jewelry constituted the dowry that Anatole was forced to bankroll for his father-in-law, so it formed the property of Anatole.

Princess Mathilde&#x27;s mother was Emperor Nicholas I of Russia&#x27;s first cousin, and the emperor supported Mathilde in her clashes with her spouse, a Russian subject. As consequence, Anatole chose to live much of his remaining life outside Russia.

The terms of the separation announced by the Tribunal in Saint Petersburg forced Anatole to pay annual alimony of 200,000 French francs. Anatole vigorously pursued the return of his property, which led Mathilde and her strong circle of literary friends to mount highly personal and unfair counter-attacks using the public media. In the end, Anatole&#x27;s heirs never recovered his property since Mathilde&#x27;s last will was altered towards the end of her life.
Princess Mathilde lived in a mansion in Paris, where, as a prominent member of the new aristocracy during and after the Second French Empire, she entertained eminent men of arts and letters at her salon. She disliked etiquette, but welcomed her visitors, according to Abel Hermant, with an extreme refinement of snobbery and politeness. Théophile Gautier was employed as her librarian in 1868. Referring to her uncle, Emperor Napoleon I, she once told Marcel Proust: &quot;If it weren&#x27;t for him, I&#x27;d be selling oranges in the streets of Ajaccio.&quot;

At the fall of the monarchy in 1870, she lived in Belgium for a while, but soon returned to Paris. Throughout her time in France, she maintained ties with the Imperial court in Saint Petersburg, her maternal cousins. In 1873, following the death of Prince Demidov in 1870, she married the artist and poet Claudius Marcel Popelin (1825–1892). She was the only member of the Bonaparte family to stay in France after May 1886, when the French Republic expelled the princes of the former ruling dynasties. In 1896, she was invited to a ceremony at Invalides by Félix Faure at a visit of Emperor Nicholas II Russia and his wife Empress Alexandra.

She died in Paris on 2 January 1904 aged 83.

== In culture ==
An aged Princess Mathilde makes a brief appearance in Proust&#x27;s &quot;À l&#x27;ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs&quot; (&quot;In the Shadow of Young Girls In Flower&quot;), the second volume of &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;. She mentions that if she wants to visit les Invalides, she does not need an invitation: she has her own set of keys.

Princess Mathilde is referred to several times in Gore Vidal&#x27;s novel &quot;1876&quot; as being a friend of the fictional narrator, Charles Schermerhorn Schuyler. She is also mentioned by the Portuguese romantic realist Eça de Queiroz in one of his most relevant posthumous novels To the Capital.

<text>Peter Frederick Wedlock (23 May 1942 – 4 March 2010) was an English folk singer best known for his UK hit single &quot;The Oldest Swinger in Town&quot;, which was covered by German comedian Karl Dall as &quot;Der älteste Popper der Stadt&quot;. He performed at many venues in Britain and Europe, presented programmes for West Country TV and acted with the Bristol Old Vic, as well as undertaking after-dinner speaking engagements.

==Early life==
Fred Wedlock was born in the old Bristol Maternity Hospital in Southwell Street, Kingsdown, Bristol. He was brought up in Redcliffe, where his father ran the York House pub. He sang in the church choir at St Mary Redcliffe. Wedlock was educated at Bristol Grammar School in the 1950s. He represented the school and the Old Bristolians playing hockey.

==Career==

After attending Swansea University, he taught in the East End of London during the 1960s, at South Bristol College, Elm Park School Winterbourne and the Castle School, Thornbury (1969 to 1971), before taking up music full-time in the 1970s. Wedlock was a regular performer at the Bristol Troubadour Club and he played the folk circuit, both prior to, and in the wake of, his single chart success, with performances at clubs and festivals all over the world. He also presented many programmes on West Country TV including &quot;Bargain Hunters&quot; on HTV. In 1997 Wedlock took a leading role in Bristol Old Vic&#x27;s production of &quot;Up the Feeder, Down the Mouth&quot;, a theatrical history of Bristol Docks, written by A. C. H. Smith. In 2001 the production was restaged on the waterfront. He also appeared in several productions for Bristol theatre company, The Ministry of Entertainment, most recently in December 2009.

Wedlock&#x27;s albums include &quot;The Folker&quot; (1971) (notable for the title track parody of &quot;The Boxer&quot; by Simon and Garfunkel), &quot;Frollicks&quot; (1973), &quot;Out of Wedlock&quot; (1978), &quot;The Oldest Swinger in Town&quot; (1981) and &quot;Fred Wedlock Live&quot; (1982). In early 1981 &quot;The Oldest Swinger in Town&quot;, reached number 6 in the UK Singles Chart. The song was subsequently released in Australia where it peaked at number 60.

His daughter, Hannah Wedlock, was an occasional member of the Pigsty Hill Light Orchestra, another Bristol-based outfit, whom Fred made his support band at an early stage of their career. She now performs with the Blue Note Jazz Band. His grandfather, Billy Wedlock, captained Bristol City F.C. and was a regular for England in the early 20th century. The former Wedlock Stand at Ashton Gate was named in his honour. He lived at Amesbury near Timsbury, Somerset where for many years he contributed to village life by providing entertainment and helping with raising funds for local projects.

==Death==
It was announced on 4 March 2010 that Fred Wedlock had died, in hospital in Bath, Somerset, following a heart attack, after having contracted pneumonia. Dick Greener of &quot;Strawbs Web&quot;, the website of folk rock band The Strawbs, said that he was &quot;A huge comic talent, and an all round thoroughly nice guy, I know ... those who have seen Fred in the past during his long and successful career, would want to pass on their condolences to Fred&#x27;s family.&quot; Derek Cleverdon, chairman of the Variety Club Children&#x27;s Charity South West, said Wedlock was also devoted to charitable causes. &quot;He performed on numerous occasions for the Variety Club, and raised thousands of pounds for us over the years.&quot;

A large number of people attended a funeral service held at St Mary Redcliffe church on 15 March 2010. Family and friends paid homage with tributes and songs. A local press report said that &quot;he filled Bristol&#x27;s largest church to capacity.&quot;

Wedlock was survived by his wife and two daughters.

==Personal papers and recordings==
Videos and CDs of television programmes and performances, promotional photographs and press cuttings, song lyrics, jokes, scripts, research notes, papers and correspondence are held by Bristol Archives (Ref. 44790) (online catalogue).

<text>In popular music, a cover version, cover song, remake, revival, or simply cover is a new performance or recording by a musician other than the original performer or composer of the song. Originally, it referred to a version of a song released around the same time as the original in order to compete with it. Now, it refers to any subsequent version performed after the original.

== History ==
The term &quot;cover&quot; goes back decades when cover version originally described a rival version of a tune recorded to compete with the recently released (original) version. Examples of records covered include Paul Williams&#x27; 1949 hit tune &quot;The Hucklebuck&quot; and Hank Williams&#x27; 1952 song &quot;Jambalaya&quot;. Both crossed over to the popular hit parade and had numerous hit versions. Before the mid-20th century, the notion of an original version of a popular tune would have seemed slightly odd – the production of musical entertainment was seen as a live event, even if it was reproduced at home via a copy of the sheet music, learned by heart or captured on a gramophone record. In fact, one of the principal objects of publishing sheet music was to have a composition performed by as many artists as possible. This made the song more important than the performing artist and rival cover or &#x27;copycat&#x27; versions would vie for success.

In previous generations, some artists made very successful careers of presenting revivals or reworkings of once-popular tunes, even out of doing contemporary &quot;cover versions&quot; of current hits. Since the 1950s, musicians now play what they call &quot;cover versions&quot; (the reworking, updating, or interpretation) of songs as a tribute to the original performer or group. Using familiar material (such as evergreen hits, standard tunes or classic recordings) is an important method of learning music styles. Until the mid-1960s most albums, or long playing records, contained a large number of evergreens or standards to present a fuller range of the artist&#x27;s abilities and style. (See, for example, &quot;Please Please Me&quot;.) Artists might also perform interpretations (&quot;covers&quot;) of a favorite artist&#x27;s hit tunes for the simple pleasure of playing a familiar song or collection of tunes.

Today, three broad types of entertainers depend on cover versions for their principal repertoire:

* Tribute acts or bands are performers who make a living by recreating the music of one particular artist or band. Bands such as Björn Again, Led Zepagain, The Fab Four, Australian Pink Floyd Show and the Iron Maidens are dedicated to playing the music of ABBA, Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, Pink Floyd, and Iron Maiden respectively. Some tribute acts salute the Who, The Rolling Stones and many other classic rock acts. Many tribute acts target artists who remain popular but no longer perform, allowing an audience to experience the &quot;next best thing&quot; to the original act. The formation of tribute acts is roughly proportional to the enduring popularity of the original act; for example, dozens of Beatles tribute bands have formed and an entire subindustry has formed around Elvis impersonation. Many tribute bands attempt to recreate another band&#x27;s music as faithfully as possible, but some such bands introduce a twist. Dread Zeppelin performs reggae versions of the Zeppelin catalog and Beatallica creates heavy metal fusions of songs by the Beatles and Metallica. There are also situations in which a member of a tribute band will go on to greater success, sometimes with the original act they tribute. One notable example is Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens who, once the lead singer of Judas Priest tribute band British Steel, went on to join Judas Priest himself.

* Cover acts or bands are entertainers who perform a broad variety of crowd-pleasing cover songs for audiences who enjoy the familiarity of hit songs. Such bands draw from either current Top 40 hits or those of previous decades to provide nostalgic entertainment in bars, on cruise ships and at such events as weddings, family celebrations and corporate functions. Since the advent of inexpensive computers, some cover bands use a computerized catalog of songs, so that the singer can have the lyrics to a song displayed on a computer screen. The use of a screen for lyrics as a memory aid can dramatically increase the number of songs a singer can perform.

* Revivalist artists or bands are performers who are inspired by an entire genre of music and dedicate themselves to curating and recreating the genre and introducing it to younger audiences who have not experienced that music first hand. Unlike tribute bands and cover bands who rely primarily on audiences seeking a nostalgic experience, revivalist bands usually seek new young audiences for whom the music is fresh and has no nostalgic value. For example, Sha Na Na started in 1969 as a celebration of the doo-wop music of the 1950s, a genre of music that was not initially fashionable during the hippie counter-culture era. The Blues Brothers started in 1978 as a living salute to the blues, soul and R&amp;B music of the 1950s and 1960s that was not in vogue by the late 1970s. The Blues Brothers&#x27; creed was that they were &quot;on a mission from God&quot; as evangelists for blues and soul music. The Black Crowes formed in 1984, initially dedicated to reviving 1970s style blues-rock. They started writing their own material in the same vein.

==United States copyright law==
Since the Copyright Act of 1909, United States musicians have had the right to record a version of someone else&#x27;s previously recorded and released tune, whether it is music alone or music with lyrics. A license can be negotiated between representatives of the interpreting artist and the copyright holder, or recording published tunes can fall under a mechanical license whereby the recording artist pays a standard royalty to the original author/copyright holder through an organization such as the Harry Fox Agency, and is safe under copyright law even if they do not have any permission from the original author. A similar service was provided by Limelight by RightsFlow, until January 2015, when they announced they will be closing their service. The U.S. Congress introduced the mechanical license to head off an attempt by the Aeolian Company to monopolize the piano roll market.

Although a composer cannot deny anyone a mechanical license for a new recorded version, the composer has the right to decide who will release the first recording of a song. Bob Dylan took advantage of this right when he refused his own record company the right to release a live recording of &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;. Even with this, pre-release cover versions of songs can occasionally occur.

Live performances of copyrighted songs are typically arranged through performing rights organizations such as ASCAP or BMI.

==Early 20th century history==
===Multiple versions in various formats or locations===
Early in the 20th century it became common for phonograph record labels to have singers or musicians &quot;cover&quot; a commercially successful &quot;hit&quot; tune by recording a version for their own label in hopes of cashing in on the tune&#x27;s success. For example, &quot;Ain&#x27;t She Sweet&quot; was popularized in 1927 by Eddie Cantor (on stage) and by Ben Bernie and Gene Austin (on record), was repopularized through popular recordings by Mr. Goon Bones &amp; Mr. Ford and Pearl Bailey in 1949, and later still revived as 33 and 45 RPM records by the Beatles in 1964.

Because little promotion or advertising was done in the early days of record production, other than at the local music hall or music store, the average buyer purchasing a new record usually asked for the tune, not the artist. Record distribution was highly localized, so a locally popular artist could quickly record a version of a hit song from another area and reach an audience before the version by the artist(s) who first introduced the tune, and highly competitive record companies were quick to take advantage of this.

===Rival outlets and popularized recordings===
This began to change in the late 1930s, when the growing record-buying public began including a younger age group. During the swing era, when a bobby soxer went looking for a recorded tune, say &quot;In the Mood&quot;, typically she wanted the version popularized by her favorite artist(s), e.g. the Glenn Miller version (on RCA Victor&#x27;s cheaper Bluebird label), not someone else&#x27;s (sometimes presented on a more expensive record company&#x27;s label). This trend was marked closely by the charting of record sales by the different artists, not just hit tunes, on the music industry&#x27;s hit parades. However, for sound commercial reasons, record companies still continued to record different versions of tunes that sold well. Most audiences until the mid-1950s still heard their favorite artists playing live music on stage or via the radio. And since radio shows were for the most part aimed at local audiences, it was still rare for an artist in one area to reach a mass audience. Also radio stations tended to cater to broad audience markets, so an artist in one vein might not get broadcast on other stations geared to a set audience. So popular versions of jazz, country and western or rhythm and blues tunes, and vice versa, were frequent. An example is &quot;Mack the Knife&quot; (&quot;Die Moritat von Mackie Messer&quot;), originally from Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s 1928 &quot;Die Dreigroschenoper&quot;. It was popularized by a 1956 hit parade instrumental tune, &quot;Moritat&quot;, for the Dick Hyman Trio, also recorded by Richard Hayman &amp; Jan August, but a hit also for Louis Armstrong 1956/1959, Bobby Darin, 1959, and Ella Fitzgerald, 1960, as vocal versions of &quot;Mack the Knife&quot;.

Europe&#x27;s Radio Luxembourg, like many commercial stations, also sold &quot;air time&quot;; so record companies and others bought air time to promote their own artists or products, thus increasing the number of recorded versions of any tune then available. Add to this the fact that many radio stations were limited in their permitted &quot;needle time&quot; (the amount of recorded music they were allowed to play), or were regulated on the amount of local talent they had to promote in live broadcasts, as with most national stations like the BBC in the UK.

===Incentives to make duplicate recorded versions of a song===
In the US, broadcasters pay royalties to authors and publishers. Artists are not paid royalties, so there is an incentive to record numerous versions of a song, particularly in different genres. For example, King Records frequently cut both rhythm and blues and country and western versions of novelty songs like &quot;Good Morning, Judge&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Roll those Bloodshot Eyes at Me&quot;. This tradition was expanded when rhythm and blues songs began appearing on pop music charts.

In the early days of rock and roll, many tunes originally recorded by R&amp;B and country musicians were still being re-recorded in a more popular vein by other artists with a more toned-down style or professional polish. This was inevitable because radio stations were reluctant to play formats outside their target audience&#x27;s taste. By far the most popular style of music in the mid-1950s / mid-1960s was still the professional light orchestra, therefore popular recording artists sought that format.
For many purists these popular versions lacked the raw earthiness of the original introducing artists.

Most did not have the kudos that rebellious teenagers craved, the street credibility — of rock and roll music; most were performed, and some were written, by black artists not heard in popular mass entertainment markets. Most parents considered the bowdlerized popular cover versions more palatable for the mass audience of parents and their children. Artists targeting the white-majority family audience were more acceptable to programmers at most radio and TV stations. Singer-songwriter Don McLean called the cover version a &quot;racist tool&quot;. Many parents in the 1950s - 60s, whether intentionally racist or not, felt deeply threatened by the rapid pace of social change. They had, for the most part, shared entertainment with their parents in ways their children had become reluctant to do. The jukebox and the personal record disc player were still relatively expensive pieces of machinery — and the portable radio a great novelty, allowing truculent teenagers to shut themselves off.

Tunes by introducing or &quot;original&quot; niche market artists that became successful on the mass audience hit parade charts are called crossovers as they &quot;crossed over&quot; from the targeted country, jazz or rhythm audience. Also, many songs originally recorded by male artists were rerecorded by female artists, and vice versa. Such a cover version is also sometimes called a &quot;cross cover version&quot;, &quot;male cover&quot;, or &quot;female cover&quot;. Some songs such as &quot;If Only for One Night&quot; were originally recorded by female artists but covered by mostly male artists.

Reworking non-English language tunes and lyrics for the Anglo-Saxon markets was once a popular part of the music business. For example, the 1954 worldwide hit &quot;The Happy Wanderer&quot; was originally &quot;&quot;Der fröhliche Wanderer&quot;, to this must be added &quot;Hymne à l&#x27;amour&quot;, &quot;Mütterlein&quot;, &quot;Volare&quot;, &quot;Seeman&quot;, &quot;Quando, Quando, Quando&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;amour est bleu&quot;&quot;, etc.

==Modern cover versions of songs==
Cover versions of many popular songs have been recorded, sometimes with a radically different style, sometimes virtually unrecognizable from the original. For example, Sir Mix-a-Lot&#x27;s 1992 rap &quot;Baby Got Back&quot; was covered by indie rock singer Jonathan Coulton in 2005, in an acoustic soft rock style. Coulton&#x27;s cover was then covered, without attribution, in 2013 by the show &quot;Glee&quot;, and was so similar that Coulton, among others, alleged plagiarism of his arrangement and melody. Some producers or recording artists may also enlist the services of a sample replay company such as Titan Tribute Media or Scorccio, in order to replicate an original recording with precision detail and accuracy.

A song may be covered into another language. For example, in the 1930s, a recording of &quot;Isle of Capri&quot; in Spanish, by Osvaldo Fresedo and singer Roberto Ray, is known. Falco&#x27;s 1982 German-language hit &quot;Der Kommissar&quot; was covered in English by After the Fire, although the German title was retained. The English version, which was not a direct translation of Falco&#x27;s original but retained much of its spirit, reached the Top 5 on the US charts. &quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot; evolved over several decades and versions from a 1939 Solomon Linda &quot;a cappella&quot; song. Many of singer Laura Branigan&#x27;s 1980s hits were English-language covers of songs already successful in Europe, for the American record market. Numerable English-language covers exist of &quot;99 Luftballons&quot; by German singer Nena (notably one by punk band Goldfinger), one having been recorded by Nena herself following the success of her original German version. &quot;Popcorn&quot;, a song that was originally completely instrumental, has had lyrics added in at least six different languages in various covers. During the heyday of Cantopop in Hong Kong in the late 1970s to early 1990s, many hits were covers of English and Japanese titles that have gained international fame but with localized lyrics (sometimes multiple sets of lyrics sung to the same tune), and critics often chide the music industry of shorting the tune-composing process.

Although modern cover versions are often produced for artistic reasons, some aspects of the disingenuous spirit of early cover versions remain. In the album-buying heyday of the 1970s, albums of sound-alike covers were created, commonly released to fill bargain bins in the music section of supermarkets and even specialized music stores, where uninformed customers might easily confuse them with original recordings. The packaging of such discs was often intentionally confusing, combining the name of the original artist in large letters with a tiny disclaimer like &quot;as originally sung by&quot; or &quot;as made popular by&quot;. More recently, albums such as the Kidz Bop series of compact discs, featuring versions of contemporary songs sung by children, have sold successfully.

In 2009, the American musical comedy-drama television series &quot;Glee&quot; debuted, featuring several musical performances per episode. The series featured solely cover songs performed by the series&#x27; titular glee club until near the end of its second season with the episode &quot;Original Song&quot;. The series still primarily uses cover songs of both chart hits and show tunes, occasionally as mashups or distinct variations. The show&#x27;s musical performances have been a commercial success, with over twenty-one million copies of &quot;Glee&quot; cast single releases purchased digitally, and over nine million albums purchased worldwide.

Australian alternative/indie radio station Triple J presents a weekly segment called &quot;Like a Version&quot; in which a band or musician performs one of their own songs as well as a song they love by another artist. Originating in 2004, the popularity of the performances have resulted in the release of annual compilation albums of selected covers and, more recently, votes in the annual Triple J Hottest 100 poll (which has even sparked its own controversy).

Conjoined cover songs are collectively referred to as a &quot;cover medley&quot;.

On occasion, a cover can become more popular than the original, for instance Jimi Hendrix’s version of Bob Dylan’s &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; became the standard, and Dylan even adjusted his performance style closer to the Hendrix version. Johnny Cash’s 2002 cover of &quot;Hurt&quot; by Nine Inch Nails is another example of the cover version eclipsing the original. This is a widespread, common occurrence in the music industry.

With advancements in artificial intelligence, internet users can create covers using RVC models.

==Updating older songs==
Cover versions (as the term is now used) are often contemporary versions of familiar songs. For example, &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; was originally introduced by Cliff Edwards in the film &quot;The Hollywood Revue of 1929&quot;. The famous Gene Kelly version was a revision that brought it up to date for a 1950s Hollywood musical, and was used in the 1952 film &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;. In 1978, it was covered by French singer Sheila, accompanied by the B. Devotion group, as a disco song, once more updating it to suit the musical taste of the era. During the disco era there was a trend of taking well known songs and recording them in the disco style. More recently &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; has been covered and remixed by British act Mint Royale for a television commercial for Volkswagen. Another example of this, from a different angle, is the tune &quot;Blueberry Hill&quot;, many mistakenly believe the Fats Domino 1956 release to be the original recording and artist. In fact, it was originally introduced on film by Gene Autry and popularized on the record Hit Parade of 1940 by Glenn Miller. The Fats Domino rock and roll version is the only one that might currently get widespread airplay on most media. Similarly, &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; was originally performed by Todd Duncan, featured in the 1955 film &quot;Unchained&quot; (based on the non-fiction story &quot;Prisoners are People&quot; by Kenyon J. Scudder); Al Hibbler having the biggest number of worldwide record sales for the vocal version with Jimmy Young&#x27;s cover version rival outdoing this in the UK, Les Baxter&#x27;s Orchestra gaining the big instrumentalist sales, reaching the US Hit Parade number one spot in May 1955, but the Righteous Brothers&#x27; later version (top five on the US Hit Parade of September 1965 stalling at number 14 in the UK in August) is by far the wider known version, and especially so following its appearance in the 1990 film &quot;Ghost&quot;. &quot;House of the Rising Sun&quot; has hundreds of versions and in many genres such as folk, blues rock and punk as well as dance and dubstep.

Director Baz Luhrmann has contemporized and stylized older songs for use in his films. New or cover versions such as John Paul Young&#x27;s &quot;Love Is in the Air&quot; occur in &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot;, Candi Staton&#x27;s &quot;Young Hearts Run Free&quot; appear in &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot;, and adaptations of artists such as Nat King Cole, Nirvana, Kiss, Elton John, Thelma Houston, Marilyn Monroe, Madonna, T. Rex, David Bowie, Queen, and the Police are used in &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot;. The covers are carefully designed to fit into the structure of each film and suit the taste of the intended audience.

Other artists release new versions of their own songs, like German singer Nena who recorded an entire album with great success, with new versions of older hits. Cover songs can be used to display creativity of a performers work through the talent of another artist&#x27;s previous production. Not to be confused with a remix, which is defined as altering or distorting the original sound electronically; cover versions give a performer the ability to adapt music to their own style, typically allowing them to change the genre of a song and recreating it to their own taste. For example, in 2008, Fall Out Boy covered Michael Jackson&#x27;s hit song &quot;Beat It&quot;, changing the genre from pop rock to a more punk rock feel. Another example is when My Chemical Romance covered the Bob Dylan track &quot;Desolation Row&quot;. This is more common with today&#x27;s covers, taking older popular music and revamping it to compare with modern popular music. Aretha Franklin&#x27;s cover of Otis Redding&#x27;s &quot;Respect&quot; was voted the greatest cover song of all time, according to Forbes.com.

<text>In software development, a lead programmer is responsible for providing technical guidance and mentorship to a team of software developers. Alternative titles include &quot;development lead&quot;, &quot;technical lead&quot;, &quot;lead programmer&quot;, or &quot;lead application developer&quot;. When primarily contributing a low-level enterprise software design with focus on the structure of the app, e.g. design patterns, the role would be a software architect (as distinct to the high-level less technical role of &quot;solutions architect&quot;.)

==Responsibilities==

A lead programmer has responsibilities which may vary from company to company, but in general is responsible for overseeing the work, in a technical sense, of a team of software developers working on a project, ensuring work meets the technical requirements, such as coding conventions, set by the software architect responsible for the underlying architecture. A lead programmer&#x27;s duties are often &quot;hands on&quot;, meaning they typically write software code on a daily basis, assisting their team to meet deadlines and improve the quality of the codebase. They act as a mentor for new or lower-level software developers or programmers, as well as for all the members on the development team, primarily through processes such as pair programming, conducting of code reviews, promoting good development principles, such as test-driven development, and taking the lead in correcting code defects.

Although the responsibilities are primarily technical, lead programmer also generally serve as an interface between the programmers and management, have ownership of their team&#x27;s development plans and have supervisorial responsibilities in delegating work. They ensure that sections of software projects come in on time and under budget, and assisting technically with hiring and reviewing performance of staff. Lead programmers also serve as technical advisers to management and provide programming perspective on requirements. Typically a lead programmer will oversee a development team of between two and ten programmers.

A lead programmer typically reports to a principal who manages a number of teams. Technical direction may be provided by a software architect. Where teams follow the waterfall, extreme programming, or kanban approaches, the lead programmer is referred to as an &quot;engineering manager&quot;, or a &quot;software development manager&quot;, and collaborates directly with a peer, the &quot;product owner&quot;, who gathers the customer requirements that the end product must meet. In a true Agile approach, the lead programmer collaborates with a separate position of scrum master, who acts as an intermediary seeking a compromise between business demand (product owner) and team capacity and skillset, e.g. which &quot;story&quot; tickets from the &quot;product backlog&quot; will be passed into the next Agile &quot;sprint&quot;.

==Early life==
Paul was born in London, the first of three brothers, to an Italian mother and a British father. He attended St Mary&#x27;s Grammar School (as was) in Sidcup, Kent, where in his time in 6th Form, he established something of an empire based in the school library selling first so-called &quot;stales&quot; from the baker&#x27;s in Sidcup High Street, progressing to a selection of biscuits. Paul first became a model, then a dancer and choreographer. As a teenager, he was a capable footballer and made several appearances for Cray Wanderers in the London Spartan League between 1976 and 1978. In 1985, Paul moved to the United States to pursue careers in dance and modeling.

Paul spent time in the theatre, appearing in numerous plays, and has stated that these, along with an early television appearance on &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1987), helped to shape his acting abilities.

==Career==
Paul&#x27;s first role was on the ABC television series &quot;The Colbys&quot; in 1986, as ballet dancer Nikolai &quot;Kolya&quot; Rostov. This was followed by guest appearances on various television shows, including the aforementioned &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1987), two episodes of &quot;Tarzán&quot; (1991), &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; (1992), &quot;Relic Hunter&quot; (1999), and as himself in &quot;WWE SmackDown&quot; (1999). He also appeared in a January 2003 episode of &quot;Charmed&quot; and in the Off-Broadway play &quot;Bouncers&quot; (1987), as well as in the television films &quot;Shooter&quot; (1988) and &quot;The Cover Girl Murders&quot; (1993), the latter of which starred Lee Majors.

Paul&#x27;s first film appearance was in the 1988 film &quot;Last Rites&quot;, which starred Tom Berenger. He starred in the remake &quot;Masque of the Red Death&quot;, a re-telling of the Edgar Allan Poe tale. He also appeared in Sheena Easton&#x27;s &quot;Days Like This&quot; music video as her love interest and Duran Duran&#x27;s &quot;My Own Way&quot; music video as a dancer.

In 1989, he appeared in a regular role in the second season of the television series &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; as John Kincaid, three episodes of the 1991 &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; remake as Jeremiah Collins, and made a pilot for CBS Television for a series called &quot;The Owl&quot; (1991). In 2001, he starred in &quot;Tracker&quot;.

In 1992, Paul was cast in his most widely known role of Duncan MacLeod in the syndicated television series &quot;&quot;, which first aired in October 1992. He would portray the role on and off for the next 15 years, also starring in the big screen sequel &quot;&quot; (2000), and the television film &quot;&quot;, released on the Sci-Fi Channel on 15 September 2007.

Other films in which he has starred or co-starred are &quot;Dance to Win&quot; (1989), &quot;Love Potion No. 9&quot; (1992), &quot;Dead Men Can&#x27;t Dance&quot; (1997), &quot;Susan&#x27;s Plan&quot; (1998), &quot;&quot; (1999) as Lancelot, &quot;Convergence&quot; (1999), &quot;The Void&quot; (2001), &quot;The Breed&quot; (2001), &quot;Storm Watch&quot; (2002), &quot;Nemesis Game&quot; (2003) &quot;Throttle&quot; (2005), and &quot;Phantom Below&quot; (2005). In 2006, he co-starred in the horror film &quot;Séance&quot; and in &quot;Little Chicago&quot;. A year later, Paul appeared as Ananias Dare in the Sci-Fi Channel original film &quot;Wraiths of Roanoke&quot; (2007). 

Also in 2007, Paul played the lead role in the TV movie &quot;Tides of War&quot; as Commander Frank Habley, a gay officer in charge of a submarine that infiltrates North Korean waters where he instinctively discovers a secret stealth North Korean submarine and destroys it. The fleeting moments of Commander Habley and fellow officer Tom Palatonia&#x27;s relationship, played by Mike Doyle come to an abrupt end due to a fire aboard the submarine where Tom is killed while fighting the blaze. &quot;Tides of War&quot; also costars Matthew St. Patrick of &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; fame as Lieutenant Commander Steven Barker.

In 2008, Paul began voice acting the character of Patrick O&#x27;Brien in the animated &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; television show. He starred as Sir Francis Drake in the Sci-Fi Channel original film &quot;The Immortal Voyage of Captain Drake&quot; (2009), the futuristic thriller &quot;Eyeborgs&quot; (2009), and the thriller-drama &quot;The Heavy&quot; (2010). In 2012, Paul did a character voice-over in the Malaysian animated science fiction film &quot;War of the Worlds: Goliath&quot;. Paul starred in the 2013 science fiction film &quot;&quot;, a post-apocalyptic action-adventure film.

In 2015, he made a guest appearance as Commandant Leitner in &quot;Strike Back&quot;. In March 2019, he joined the CW series &quot;Arrow&quot; in a recurring role, playing a villainous character named Dante.

==Personal life==
Paul married actress Meilani Figalan in 1990. The couple divorced in 1997. Paul married long-time girlfriend Alexandra Tonelli in 2009. They have three children, a daughter born in 2009, and two sons born in 2012 and 2020.

Since the late 1980s, he has studied a range of martial arts, including Taekwondo, Choy Li Fut, and Hung Gar Kung Fu, and has been featured on the covers of &quot;Impact&quot; (three times), &quot;Inside Kung Fu&quot;, &quot;Karate International&quot; (four times) and &quot;Martial Arts Insider&quot;.

===Filmblips===
Paul is also involved in the development and production side of the entertainment industry. In 2008, he joined with Zoltan Furedi and founded Filmblips, an independent film and television media production company.

<text>Labradorite ((Ca, Na)(Al, Si)4O8) is a calcium-enriched feldspar mineral first identified in Labrador, Canada, which can display an iridescent effect (schiller).

Labradorite is an intermediate to calcic member of the plagioclase series. It has an anorthite percentage (%An) of between 50 and 70. The specific gravity ranges from 2.68 to 2.72. The streak is white, like most silicates. The refractive index ranges from 1.559 to 1.573 and twinning is common. As with all plagioclase members, the crystal system is triclinic, and three directions of cleavage are present, two of which are nearly at right angles and are more obvious, being of good to perfect quality (while the third direction is poor). It occurs as clear, white to gray, blocky to lath shaped grains in common mafic igneous rocks such as basalt and gabbro, as well as in anorthosites.

== Occurrence ==
The geological type area for labradorite is Paul&#x27;s Island near the town of Nain in Labrador, Canada. It has also been reported in Poland, Norway, Finland and various other locations worldwide, with notable distribution in Madagascar, China, Australia, Slovakia and the United States.

Labradorite occurs in mafic igneous rocks and is the feldspar variety most common in basalt and gabbro. The uncommon anorthosite bodies are composed almost entirely of labradorite. It also is found in metamorphic amphibolites and as a detrital component of some sediments. Common mineral associates in igneous rocks include olivine, pyroxenes, amphiboles and magnetite.

==Labradorescence==


Labradorite can display an iridescent optical effect (or &quot;schiller&quot;) known as labradorescence. The term &quot;labradorescence&quot; was coined by Ove Balthasar Bøggild, who defined it (labradorization) as follows:

Contributions to the understanding of the origin and cause of the effect were made by Robert Strutt, 4th Baron Rayleigh (1923), and by Bøggild (1924).

The cause of this optical phenomenon is phase exsolution lamellar structure, occurring in the Bøggild miscibility gap. The effect is visible when the lamellar separation is between ; the lamellae are not necessarily parallel; and the lamellar structure is found to lack long range order.

The lamellar separation only occurs in plagioclases of a certain composition; those of calcic labradorite (50–70% anorthite) and bytownite (formula: , &quot;i.e.&quot;, with an anorthite content of ~70 to 90%) particularly exemplify this. Another requirement for the lamellar separation is a very slow cooling of the rock containing the plagioclase. Slow cooling is required to allow the Ca, Na, Si, and Al ions to diffuse through the plagioclase and produce the lamellar separation. Therefore, not all labradorites exhibit labradorescence (they might not have the correct composition, cooled too quickly, or both), and not all plagioclases that exhibit labradorescence are labradorites (they may be bytownite).

Some gemstone varieties of labradorite exhibiting a high degree of labradorescence are called spectrolite.

<doc id="159035" wikidata="Q1018732" url="?curid=159035" title="Bytownite">
<text>Bytownite is a calcium rich member of the plagioclase solid solution series of feldspar minerals with composition between anorthite and labradorite. It is usually defined as having between 70 and 90%An (formula: ). Like others of the series, bytownite forms grey to white triclinic crystals commonly exhibiting the typical plagioclase twinning and associated fine striations.

The specific gravity of bytownite varies between 2.74 and 2.75. The refractive indices ranges are nα=1.563 – 1.572, nβ=1.568 – 1.578, and nγ=1.573 – 1.583. Precise determination of these two properties with chemical, X-ray diffraction, or petrographic analysis are required for identification.

==Occurrence==

Bytownite is a rock forming mineral occurring in mafic igneous rocks such as gabbros and anorthosites. It also occurs as phenocrysts in mafic volcanic rocks. It is rare in metamorphic rocks. It is typically associated with pyroxenes and olivine.

The mineral was first described in 1836 and named for an occurrence at Bytown (now Ottawa), Canada. Other noted occurrences in Canada include the Shawmere anorthosite in Foleyet Township, Ontario, and on Yamaska Mountain,
near Abbotsford, Quebec. It occurs on Rùm island, Scotland and Eycott Hill, near Keswick, Cumberland, England. It is reported from Naaraodal, Norway and in the Bushveld complex of South Africa. It is also found in Isa Valley, Western Australia.

In the US it is found in the Stillwater igneous complex of Montana; from near Lakeview, Lake County, Oregon. It occurs in the Lucky Cuss mine, Tombstone, Arizona; and from the Grants district, McKinley County, New Mexico. In the eastern US it occurs at Cornwall, Lebanon County, Pennsylvania and Phoenixville, Chester County, Pennsylvania.

<text>Jimmy James and the Blue Flames was an American rock group that was fronted by Jimi Hendrix, who was then going by the name &quot;Jimmy James&quot;. The band was Hendrix&#x27;s first extended foray into the 1966 Greenwich Village music scene and included future Spirit guitarist Randy California, then 15 years old. At various New York clubs, they played a mix of rock, blues, and rhythm and blues songs as well as early versions of songs that became part of the Jimi Hendrix Experience repertoire. It was at such a performance that the Animals&#x27; bassist Chas Chandler first heard their rendition of &quot;Hey Joe&quot; and decided to invite Hendrix to England and become his producer and manager.

==Background==
After his discharge from the United States Army in 1962, Jimi Hendrix toured and recorded with several well-known R&amp;B artists, including the Isley Brothers and Little Richard. By 1965, he had become more or less established in New York&#x27;s Harlem neighborhood and performed with local R&amp;B outfits Curtis Knight and the Squires and King Curtis. However, by mid-1966, Hendrix became disillusioned with the confines of the R&amp;B scene and barely subsistence-level wages. Following the advice of folk singer and guitarist Richie Havens, he began exploring New York&#x27;s Greenwich Village, a bohemian-style enclave of Manhattan.

At the time, the Village had a vibrant and diverse music scene and Hendrix was able to land a gig at the Cafe Wha? backed by the house band. He soon attracted other musicians and settled on the name Jimmy James and the Blue Flames, although he would later sometimes refer to the band as &quot;the Rain Flowers&quot;, &quot;the Blue Flames&quot; and &quot;the Blue Flame&quot;. According to Randy California, &quot;All I remember was that it was being called Jimmy James &amp; the Blue Flames. Maybe it was changed for one night ... just for fun&quot;. Hendrix chose &quot;the Blue Flames&quot; as a nod to Memphis blues singer Junior Parker&#x27;s backup band (with the accomplished guitarists Pat Hare, succeeded by Wayne Bennett and Mel Brown) and because it rhymed with his stage name, Jimmy James.

At first, the band was a trio with Hendrix, bassist Randy Palmer and drummer Dan Casey. They soon added a second guitarist, Randy Wolfe, who Hendrix met at Manny&#x27;s Music. With two Randys in the band, Hendrix called Wolfe &quot;Randy California&quot; and Palmer &quot;Randy Texas&quot; after their home states and, according to Roby, he became &quot;Jimi James&quot; (California was unaware that his last name was Hendrix until radio show host Dr. Demento showed him the &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; album cover and he heard the songs). Although Jeff Baxter claims that he sat in on bass when Palmer was unavailable, California did not recall him. Drummer Danny Taylor, who later played with Silver Apples, also claims to have sat in with the band.

==Repertoire==
At the Cafe Wha?, one of the first songs performed by Jimmy James and the Blue Flames was &quot;Wild Thing&quot;, then a Top-40 radio hit by the Troggs. Another was &quot;Hey Joe&quot; – Hendrix preferred the slower, moodier version by folk musician Tim Rose over the fast hit rendition by the Leaves. Other songs included Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Hang On Sloopy&quot; and &quot;House of the Rising Sun&quot;. Sometime Hendrix collaborator Paul Caruso recalled a performance of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Rain&quot; with the bassist attempting to sing John Lennon&#x27;s backwards vocal at the end of the song. Randy California also remembered &quot;High Heel Sneakers&quot;, &quot;Jimmy Reed kind of songs&quot;, and &quot;some standard blues things&quot;, such as Muddy Waters and Bo Diddley songs, also found on John Hammond Jr.&#x27;s blues-rock album &quot;So Many Roads&quot; (1965). During his time in the Village, Hendrix was distancing himself from the Harlem R&amp;B scene, where he felt overly criticized because of his evolving guitar style and lifestyle. However, he continued to play covers of R&amp;B hits with the Blue Flames, such as &quot;Shotgun&quot;, &quot;In the Midnight Hour&quot; and &quot;Mercy, Mercy&quot;, a song he had recorded with Don Covay.

Also performed were early versions of Hendrix compositions that the Experience later recorded. Hendrix biographer Keith Shadwick commented

The Blue Flames also performed &quot;Mr. Bad Luck&quot;, later recorded by the Experience, which first appeared as &quot;Look Over Yonder&quot; on &quot;Rainbow Bridge&quot; and later on &quot;Valleys of Neptune&quot;; later Hendrix biographer/producer John McDermott identified &quot;Mr. Bad Luck&quot; as &quot;among the few original compositions Hendrix performed in tiny Greenwich Village nightspots as a little known guitarist fronting Jimmy James &amp; the Blue Flames in 1966&quot;. According to Frank Von Elmo, an early jam partner, they also played an early &quot;Foxy Lady&quot; and guitarist Bob Kulick remembered &quot;a primitive version of &#x27;Third Stone from the Sun&#x27;&quot;. When &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; was first released, early supporter Linda Keith (who brought Hendrix to the attention of Chandler) said &quot;none of the tracks [on the album] were a complete surprise to her, because most featured riffs, patterns and ideas she&#x27;d first heard in Greenwich Village that summer [of 1966]&quot;.

==Performances==
According to Randy California, Jimmy James and the Blue Flames often played five sets a night, sometimes six days a week for little more than tips. After about a month into their three month stint at the Cafe Wha?, the group, with Hendrix as the focus, began to receive attention from the music establishment. Giorgio Gomelsky (producer for the Yardbirds), Andrew Loog Oldham (the Rolling Stones), John Hammond (Dylan/Columbia Records), and Seymour Stein (Sire Records) were among those who scouted the group&#x27;s performances. Other musicians who caught their sets around New York included members of the Rolling Stones, the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful, the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, and the Animals. In an interview, Butterfield guitarist Mike Bloomfield described Hendrix&#x27;s guitar work:
John Hammond Jr., who recorded several early blues-rock albums with members of the Band, Charlie Musselwhite and Bloomfield, also became involved with Jimmy James and the Blue Flames. In addition to Hendrix, Hammond had been &quot;particularly impressed with Randy California&#x27;s slide [guitar] technique&quot;. After several rehearsals with the group, they backed Hammond during his two-week engagement at the Village&#x27;s Cafe au Go Go during late August and September. They were dubbed the &quot;Screaming Night Hawkes&quot;, although in a newspaper ad, they were listed as &quot;John Hammond &amp; the Blue Flame&quot;. Hammond remembered Al Kooper and Barry Goldberg occasionally sitting in on keyboards and Hendrix performing one solo number by Bo Diddley, possibly &quot;I&#x27;m a Man&quot;. Other musicians who recalled their shows include Buzzy Linhart (who later added vibraphone to Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;Drifting&quot;), Robbie Robertson, John Sebastian and Stefan Grossman.

==Chas Chandler and breakup==
Jimmy James and the Blue Flames managed to attract a lot of attention during their short run and the Animals&#x27; Chas Chandler was the first to offer the all-important deal. Chandler had just heard Tim Rose&#x27;s folk-rock arrangement of the Billy Roberts song &quot;Hey Joe&quot; and thought that it might be a good vehicle to launch a new artist and his career as a producer. By chance, when Linda Keith brought him to hear the Blue Flames in August, the first song they played was &quot;Hey Joe&quot;; in the often repeated Bob Kulick quote, Chandler &quot;became so excited he spilled his milkshake all over himself&quot;. Upon his return to New York in September, Chas Chandler brought Michael Jeffery to hear Hendrix with Hammond at the Cafe au Go Go and the two agreed to become Hendrix&#x27;s co-managers.

Although it would have been fitting to continue in a blues-based vein that was then popular with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, John Hammond, and the Blues Project,
Hendrix wanted to keep the group together, but bringing them to England (with California still a minor) was unworkable. He expressed his discomfort to several other Village musicians: &quot;Jimi felt guilty, but he was going through with it&quot;, recalled Ellen McIlwaine, a folk singer whom Hendrix had accompanied at the Cafe Au Go Go. Although his economic circumstances had not improved appreciably, playing with the Blue Flames enabled him to explore his own sound and material. It also allowed him to raise his expectationsafter one last gig with Curtis Knight and the Squires, where he was again criticized for being too flashy and loud, he ripped out his guitar cord and announced, &quot;That&#x27;s the last time I play this shit. I&#x27;m going to England.&quot;
