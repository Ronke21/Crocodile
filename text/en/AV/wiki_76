<text>Sir Michael Murray Hordern (3 October 19112 May 1995) was an English actor. He is best known for his Shakespearean roles, especially King Lear. He often appeared in film, rising from a bit part actor to leading roles; by the time of his death he had appeared in nearly 140 films. His later work was predominantly in television and radio.

Born in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, into a family with no theatrical connections, Hordern was educated at Windlesham House School, then located in Portslade, East Sussex. He went on to Brighton College, where his interest in the theatre developed. After leaving the college he joined an amateur dramatics company, and came to the notice of several influential Shakespearean directors who cast him in minor roles in &quot;Othello&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot;. During the Second World War he served on HMS &quot;Illustrious&quot;, reaching the rank of lieutenant-commander. Upon demobilisation he resumed his acting career and made his television debut, becoming a bit-part actor in many films, particularly in the war film genre.

Hordern came to prominence in the early 1950s when he took part in a theatrical competition at the Arts Theatre in London. This led to a season-long contract at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, where he played major parts including Caliban in &quot;The Tempest&quot;, Jaques in &quot;As You Like It&quot;, and Sir Politick Would-Be in Ben Jonson&#x27;s comedy &quot;Volpone&quot;. The following season Hordern joined Michael Benthall&#x27;s company at the Old Vic where, among other parts, he played Polonius in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, and the title role in &quot;King John&quot;. In 1957 he won the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor for his role as the barrister in John Mortimer&#x27;s courtroom drama &quot;The Dock Brief&quot;. Along with his theatrical responsibilities Hordern had regular supporting roles in various films including &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1963), and &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot; (1966).

In the late 1960s Hordern met the British theatre director Jonathan Miller, who cast him in &quot;Whistle and I&#x27;ll Come to You&quot;, which was recorded for television and received wide praise. Hordern&#x27;s next major play was &quot;Jumpers&quot; at the Royal National Theatre in 1972. His performance was praised by critics and he reprised the role four years later. Hordern&#x27;s television credits towards the end of his life included &quot;Paradise Postponed&quot;, the BAFTA award-winning &quot;Memento Mori&quot;, and the BBC adaptation of &quot;Middlemarch&quot;. He was appointed a CBE in 1972 and was knighted eleven years later. Hordern suffered from kidney disease during the 1990s and died from it in 1995, aged 83.

==Life and career==
===Early life and education===
Hordern was born 3 October 1911 at Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, third son of Edward Joseph Calveley Hordern, of a family of Hampshire landed gentry with a strong clerical tradition, and Margaret Emily, daughter of mechanical engineer Edward Francis Murray.

Edward Hordern&#x27;s father, Rev. Joseph Calveley Hordern, was the rector at the Holy Trinity Church in Bury. As a young man Edward joined the Royal Indian Marines and gained the rank of lieutenant. During a short break on home-leave he fell in love with Margaret, after they were introduced by one of his brothers. The courtship was brief and the young couple married in Burma on 28 November 1903. They had their first child, a son, Geoffrey, in 1905, followed by another, Peter, in 1907.

Margaret was descended from James Murray, an Irish physician whose research into digestion led to his discovery of the stomach aid milk of magnesia in 1829. The invention earned him a knighthood and brought the family great wealth. Margaret grew up in England, and attended St Audries School for Girls in Somerset.

Four years after the birth of Peter, a pregnant Margaret returned to England, where Michael Hordern, her third son, was born. Still stationed abroad, Edward was promoted to the rank of captain, for which he received a good salary. The family lived in comfort, and Margaret employed a scullery maid, nanny, groundsman, and full-time cook.
Margaret left for India to visit her husband in 1916. The trip, although planned only as a short term stay, lasted two years because of the ferocity of the First World War. In her absence, Hordern was sent to Windlesham House School in Sussex at the age of five. His young age exempted him from full-time studies but he was allowed to partake in extracurricular activities, including swimming, football, rugby and fishing. After a few years, and along with a fellow enthusiast, he set up the &quot;A Acting Association&quot; (AAA), a small theatrical committee, which organised productions on behalf of the school. As well as the organisation of plays, Hordern arranged a regular group of players, himself included, to perform various plays which they wrote, directed, and choreographed themselves. He stayed at Windlesham House for nine years, later describing his time there as &quot;enormous fun&quot;.

Hordern was 14 when he left Windlesham House to continue his schooling as a member of Chichester House at Brighton College. By the time of his enrolment, his interest in acting had matured. In his 1993 autobiography, &quot;A World Elsewhere&quot;, he admitted: &quot;I didn&#x27;t excel in any area apart from singing; I couldn&#x27;t read music but I sang quite well.&quot; There he helped organise amateur performances of various Gilbert and Sullivan operas. The first of these was &quot;The Gondoliers&quot;, in which he played the role of the Duchess. The tutors called his performance a great success, and he was given a position within the men&#x27;s chorus in the next piece, &quot;Iolanthe&quot;. Over the next few years, he took part in &quot;The Mikado&quot; as a member of the chorus, and then appeared as the Major-General in &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;. It was a period which he later acknowledged as being the start of his career. When the war ended in 1918, Edward, who was by now a port officer in Calcutta, arranged for Margaret to return to England. With her, she brought home an orphaned baby girl named Jocelyn, whom she adopted. The following year, Edward retired from active service and returned to England, where he relocated his family to Haywards Heath in Sussex. There, Michael developed a love for fishing, a hobby about which he remained passionate for the rest of his life.

In his autobiography Hordern admitted that his family showed no interest in the theatre and that he had not seen his first professional play, &quot;Ever Green&quot;, until he was 19. Around this time he met Christopher Hassall, a fellow student at Brighton College. Hassall, who also went on to have a successful stage career, was, as Hordern noted, instrumental in his decision to become an actor. In 1925 Hordern moved to Dartmoor with his family where they converted a disused barn into a farm house. For Hordern the move was ideal; his love of fishing had become stronger and he was able to explore the remote landscape and its isolated rivers.

===Early acting career (1930–39)===
====Theatrical beginnings====
Hordern left Brighton College in the early 1930s and secured a job as a teaching assistant in a prep school in Beaconsfield. He joined an amateur dramatics company and in his spare time, rehearsed for the company&#x27;s only play, &quot;Ritzio&#x27;s Boots&quot;, which was entered into a British Drama League competition, with Hordern in the title role. The play did well but conceded the prize, a professional production at a leading London theatre, to &quot;Not This Man&quot;, a drama written by Sydney Box. So envious was he of the rival show&#x27;s success that Hordern supplied a scathing review to &quot;The Welwyn Times&quot; calling Box&#x27;s show a &quot;blasphemous bunk and cheap theatrical claptrap&quot;. The comment infuriated Box, who issued the actor with a writ to attend court on a count of slander. Hordern won the case and left Box liable for the proceeding&#x27;s expenses. Years later the two men met on a film set where Box, much to Hordern&#x27;s surprise, thanked him for helping to kick-start his career in film making, as he had received a lot of publicity as a result of the court case.

With the death of his mother in January 1933, Hordern decided to pursue a professional acting career. He briefly took a job at a prep school but fell ill with poliomyelitis and had to leave. Upon his recuperation, he was offered a job as a travelling salesman for the British Educational Suppliers Association, a family-run business belonging to a former school friend at Windlesham House. As part of his job he spent some time in Stevenage where he joined an amateur dramatics company and appeared in two plays; &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot;, in which he played Raleigh, and &quot;Diplomacy&quot;, a piece which the actor disliked as he considered it to be &quot;too old-fashioned&quot;. Both productions provided him with the chance to work with a cue-script, something which he found to be helpful for the rest of his career. That summer he joined a Shakespearean theatre company which toured stately homes throughout the United Kingdom. His first performance was Orlando in &quot;As You Like It&quot;, followed by &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;, in which he co-starred with Osmond Daltry. Hordern admired Daltry&#x27;s acting ability and later admitted to him being a constant influence on his Shakespearean career.

In addition to his Shakespearean commitments, Hordern joined the St Pancras People&#x27;s Theatre, a London-based company partly funded by the theatrical manager Lilian Baylis. Hordern enjoyed his time there, despite the tiresome commute between Sussex and London, and stayed with the company for five years. By the end of 1936 he had left his sales job in Beaconsfield to pursue a full-time acting career. He moved into a small flat at Marble Arch and became one of the many jobbing actors eager to make a name for themselves on the London stage.

====London debut====
Hordern&#x27;s London debut came in January 1937, as an understudy to Bernard Lee in the play &quot;Night Sky&quot; at the Savoy Theatre. On nights when he was not required, Hordern would be called upon to undertake the duties of assistant stage manager, for which he was paid £2.10s a week. In March, Daltry, who had since formed his own company, Westminster Productions, cast Hordern as Ludovico in &quot;Othello&quot;.
The part became Hordern&#x27;s first paid role as an actor for a theatre company. The play was an instant hit and ran at the People&#x27;s Theatre in Mile End for two weeks. It also starred the English actor Stephen Murray in the title role, but he became contractually obliged elsewhere towards the end of the run. This allowed Hordern to take his place for which Daltry paid Hordern an extra £1 a week.

After &quot;Othello&quot;&#x27;s closure, Daltry undertook a tour of Scandinavia and the Baltic with two plays, &quot;Outward Bound&quot;, and &quot;Arms and the Man&quot;. He employed Hordern in both with the first being the more successful. It was a time that the actor recognised as being a turning point in his professional acting career. On his return to London, and after spending a few weeks in unemployment, he was offered a part in the ill-fated &quot;Ninety Sail&quot;. The play, about Samuel Pepys and the Royal Navy, was cancelled on the day Hordern was due to start work, with &quot;unforeseen problems&quot; cited as the reason by its producers.

====Bristol repertory theatre====
In mid-1937 the theatre proprietor Ronald Russell offered Hordern a part in his repertory company, the Rapier Players, who were then based at Colston Hall in Bristol. Hordern&#x27;s first acting role within the company was as Uncle Harry in the play &quot;Someone at the Door&quot;. Because of the play&#x27;s success, Russell employed him in the same type of role, the monotony of which frustrated the actor who longed to play the leading man. It was whilst with the Rapier Players that Hordern fell in love with Eve Mortimer, a juvenile actress who appeared in minor roles in many of Russell&#x27;s productions. Hordern considered his experience with the Rapier Players to be invaluable; it taught him how a professional theatre company worked under a strict time frame and how it operated with an even stricter budget. He was allowed two minutes to study each page of the script, but because of the frequent mistakes and many stalled lines, rehearsals became long and laborious. Hordern described the company&#x27;s props as being made to a very high standard, despite being bought on a shoe-string budget.

After a brief holiday with Eve in Scotland in 1938, Hordern returned to London, where he appeared in &quot;Quinneys&quot;, a radio play broadcast by the BBC in June of that year. The main part went to Henry Ainley whom Hordern described as &quot;a great actor, who, sadly, was past his best&quot;.
Hordern then made a return to Bristol to prepare for the following season with the Rapier Players. One production singled out in the &quot;Western Daily Press&quot; as particularly good was &quot;Love in Idleness&quot;, in which Hordern played the lead character. A reporter for the paper thought that the play &quot;had been noticed&quot; among theatrical critics and that the players &quot;filled their respective roles excellently&quot;.

By the end of 1938 Hordern&#x27;s father had sold the family home and had bought a cottage in Holt, near Bath, Somerset. The arrangement was convenient for the young actor, who used the premises as a base while he appeared in shows with the Rapier Players. One such piece was an adaption of Stella Gibbons&#x27;s &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot;, which starred Mabel Constanduros, who had adapted the book with Gibbons&#x27;s permission. Hordern was cast in the supporting role of Seth, a part he described as being fun to perform. The modernised script was &quot;adored&quot; by the cast, according to Hordern, but loathed by the audience who expected it to be exactly like the book.

===Second World War and film debut===
Hordern and Eve left Bristol in 1939 for Harrogate, where Eve joined a small repertory company called the White Rose Players. After a brief spell of unemployment, and with the outbreak of war, Hordern volunteered for a post within the Air Raid Precautions (ARP). He was accepted but soon grew frustrated at not being able to conduct any rescues because of the lack of enemy action. He decided that it was &quot;not a very good way to fight the war&quot; and volunteered for the Royal Navy. While he was waiting to be accepted he and Eve responded to an advertisement in &quot;The Stage&quot; for actors in a repertory company in Bath. They were appointed as the company&#x27;s leading man and lady. Their first and only engagement was in a play entitled &quot;Bats in the Belfry&quot; which opened at the city&#x27;s Assembly Rooms on 16 October. Hordern&#x27;s elation at finally becoming a leading man was short-lived when he received his call-up that December. In the interest of helping to boost public morale, Hordern sought permission from the navy to allow him to complete his theatrical commitment in Bath and to appear in his first film, a thriller called &quot;Girl in the News&quot;, directed by Carol Reed; his request was accepted, and he was told to report for duty at Plymouth Barracks in the early months of 1940 when the show had finished and he was free from filming responsibilities.
In 1940, after a minor role in &quot;Without the Prince&quot; at the Whitehall Theatre, Hordern played the small, uncredited part of a BBC official alongside James Hayter in Arthur Askey&#x27;s comedy film &quot;Band Waggon&quot;. Soon after, he began his naval gunnery training on board &quot;City of Florence&quot;, a defensively equipped merchant ship (DEMS) which delivered ammunition to the city of Alexandria for the Mediterranean Fleet. He found that although his middle class upbringing hindered his ability to make friends on board the ship, it helped with his commanding officers.

By 1942 Hordern had been commissioned as an officer and given instruction in radar and the relaying of its data for the direction of fighter planes. He later said &quot;It was suggested that this would be excellent work for me with my strong actor&#x27;s voice&quot;. After his training at Yeovilton he was appointed Fighter Direction Officer on board the aircraft carrier . Shortly after the departure of his superior, he was promoted to lieutenant-commander, a rank which he held for two years. Alongside his naval responsibilities, he was also appointed as the ship&#x27;s entertainment officer and was responsible for organising shows featuring members of the crew. He was later appointed to the Admiralty to serve in the office of Naval Assistant to the Second Sea Lord, responsible for appointing Fighter Direction Officers. Also in the office was fellow actor Kenneth More.

===Marriage and post-war years===

During a short visit to Liverpool in 1943, Hordern proposed to Eve; they married on 27 April of that year with the actor Cyril Luckham as best man. After the honeymoon, Hordern resumed his duties on &quot;Illustrious&quot; while Eve returned to repertory theatre in Southport. During his time in the Admiralty Hordern and his wife rented a flat in Elvaston Place in Kensington, London, and he began to seek work as an actor. After a short while, he was approached by André Obey who cast him in his first television role, Noah, in a play adapted from the book of the same name. Hordern was apprehensive about performing in the new medium and found the rehearsal and live performance to be exhausting; but he was generously paid, earning £45 for the entire engagement.

Hordern&#x27;s first role in 1946 came as Torvald Helmar in &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; at the Intimate Theatre in Palmers Green. This was followed by the part of Richard Fenton, a murder victim, in &quot;Dear Murderer&quot; which premiered at the Aldwych Theatre on 31 July. The play was a success and ran for 85 performances until its closure on 12 October. &quot;Dear Murderer&quot; thrilled the critics and Hordern was singled out by one reporter for the &quot;Hull Daily Mail&quot; who thought that the actor brought &quot;sincerity to a difficult role&quot;. The following month Eve gave birth to the couple&#x27;s only child, a daughter, Joanna, who was born at Queen Charlotte&#x27;s Hospital in Chelsea. That Christmas he took the role of Nick Bottom in a festive reworking of Henry Purcell&#x27;s &quot;The Fairy-Queen&quot;. The play was the first performance by the Covent Garden Opera Company, which later became known as The Royal Opera.

Towards the end of April 1947, Hordern accepted the small part of Captain Hoyle in Richard Llewellyn&#x27;s comic drama film &quot;Noose&quot;. Two other roles occurred that year: as Maxim de Winter in a television adaption of Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s novel &quot;Rebecca&quot;, followed by the part of a detective in &quot;Good-Time Girl&quot;, alongside Dennis Price and Jean Kent. The following year he took part in three plays: Peter Ustinov&#x27;s &quot;The Indifferent Shepherd&quot;, which appeared at the newly opened Q Theatre in Brentford, West London; Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Ghosts&quot;; and an adaptation of &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon in which he portrayed the part of the blustery, eccentric Mr Toad.

In early 1949 Hordern appeared as Pascal in the Michael Redgrave-directed comedy &quot;A Woman in Love&quot;, but disliked the experience because of the hostile relationship between Redgrave and the show&#x27;s star, Margaret Rawlings. Next, he was engaged in the minor role of Bashford in the critically acclaimed Ealing comedy &quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot;, a performance which he described as &quot;tense and hyperactive&quot;.

===1950–1960s===

====&quot;Ivanov&quot; and &quot;Saint&#x27;s Day&quot;====

By the 1950s Hordern had come to the notice of many influential directors. In his autobiography, the actor recognised the decade as being an important era of his career. It started with a major role in Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Ivanov&quot; in 1950. The production took place at the Arts Theatre in Cambridge and excited audiences because of its 25-year absence from the English stage. The writer T. C. Worsley was impressed by Hordern&#x27;s performance and wrote: &quot;Perhaps an actor with star quality might have imposed on us more successfully than Mr Michael Hordern, and won our sympathy for Ivanov by his own personality. But such a performance would have raised the level of expectation all round. As it is, Mr Hordern is rich in intelligence, sensitivity and grasp, and with very few exceptions, the company give his impressive playing the right kind of support.&quot; The title character in &quot;Macbeth&quot;, directed by Alec Clunes, was Hordern&#x27;s next engagement. Critics wrote of their dislike of Clunes&#x27;s version, but the theatre reviewer Audrey Williamson singled out Hordern&#x27;s performance as being &quot;deeply moving&quot;.

The dramatist John Whiting, trying to make a name for himself in the theatre after the war, was called by Clunes to take part in a theatrical competition at the Arts Theatre in London in 1951, for which he entered his play &quot;Saint&#x27;s Day&quot;. Several other amateur directors also competed for the prize, which was to have their play funded and professionally displayed at the Arts. Having seen him perform the previous year, Whiting hired Hordern for the lead role of Paul Southman, a cantankerous old poet who fights off three rebellious army deserters who threaten the tranquillity of his sleepy country village. The play proved popular with audiences, but not so with theatrical commentators. Hordern liked the piece, calling it &quot;bitter and interesting&quot;, but the press, who extensively reported on the competition throughout each stage, thought differently and condemned it for winning. This infuriated the actors Laurence Olivier and John Gielgud, who wrote letters of complaint to the press.

====Shakespeare Memorial Theatre====

Hordern cited &quot;Saint&#x27;s Day&quot;″s negative publicity as having done his career &quot;the power of good&quot; as it brought him to the attention of the director Glen Byam Shaw, who cast him in a series of plays at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in 1951. Among the roles were Caliban in &quot;The Tempest&quot;, Jaques in &quot;As You Like It&quot;, and Sir Politick Would-Be in Ben Jonson&#x27;s comedy &quot;Volpone&quot;. Hordern claimed to know very little about the bard&#x27;s works and sought advice from friends about how best to prepare for the roles. The same year, he travelled down to Nettlefold Studios, Walton-on-Thames, to film &quot;Scrooge&quot;, an adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, in which he played Marley&#x27;s ghost. Reviews were mixed with &quot;The New York Times&quot; giving it a favourable write-up, while &quot;Time&quot; magazine remained ambivalent. The &quot;Aberdeen Evening Express&quot; echoed the comments made by an American reviewer by calling &quot;Scrooge&quot; a &quot;trenchant and inspiring Christmas show&quot;. The author Fred Guida, writing in his book &quot;Christmas Carol and Its Adaptations: A Critical Examination&quot; in 2000, thought that Marley&#x27;s ghost, though a &quot;small but pivotal role&quot;, was &quot;brilliantly played&quot; by Hordern.

With the first play of the season imminent, the Horderns moved to Stratford and took temporary accommodation at Goldicote House, a large country property situated on the River Avon. The first of his two plays, &quot;The Tempest&quot;, caused Hordern to doubt his own acting ability when he compared his interpretation of Caliban to that of Alec Guinness, who had played the same role four years earlier. Reassured by Byam Shaw, Hordern remained in the role for the entire run. A few days later, the actor was thrilled to receive a letter of appreciation from Michael Redgrave, who thought Hordern&#x27;s Caliban was &quot;immensely fine, with all the pity and pathos... but with real terror and humour as well&quot;. More praise was received as the season continued; an anonymous theatre reviewer, quoted in Hordern&#x27;s autobiography, called the actor&#x27;s portrayal of Menenius Aggripa &quot;a dryly acute study of the &#x27;humorous patrician&#x27; and one moreover that can move our compassion in the Volscian cameo&quot;, before going on to say &quot;we had felt that it would be long before Alec Guinness&#x27;s Menenius could be matched. The fact that Michael Hordern&#x27;s different reading can now stand beside the other does credit to a player who will be a Stratford prize.&quot;

====The Old Vic====

Hordern&#x27;s contract at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre lasted until mid-1952, and on its expiration, he secured a position within Michael Benthall&#x27;s theatrical company at the Old Vic in London. The company&#x27;s first play, &quot;Hamlet&quot;, starred Richard Burton, Claire Bloom, and Fay Compton, and opened on 14 September 1953. Hordern called it &quot;the perfect play with which to open the season&quot; as it featured &quot;fine strong parts for everyone and [was] a good showpiece for an actor&#x27;s latent vanity&quot;. Shortly after opening, it was transferred to Edinburgh, where it took part at the Fringe before returning to London. For his role of Polonius, Hordern received mixed reviews, with one critic saying: &quot;He was at his best in his early scenes with Ophelia... but towards the end of the performance he began to obscure less matter with more art&quot;. After Edinburgh, Benthall took &quot;Hamlet&quot; on a provincial tour and the play had a successful run of 101 performances.

In mid-1953 the Danish government invited Benthall and his company to Helsingør (Elsinore) to perform &quot;Hamlet&quot; for the Norwegian royal family. The play was well received by the royals. On the whole, the actor enjoyed his time in &quot;Hamlet&quot; but behind the scenes, relations between him and Burton were strained. Hordern noted his colleague&#x27;s &quot;likeability, charm and charisma&quot; but thought that Burton had a tendency to get easily &quot;ratty&quot; with him in social situations. Hordern described their working relationship as &quot;love-hate&quot; and admitted they were envious of each other&#x27;s success; Burton of Hordern because of the latter&#x27;s good reviews, and Hordern of Burton who received more attention from fans. When Burton left for Hollywood years later, he recommended Hordern to various casting directors; Hordern was subsequently engaged in six of Burton&#x27;s films.

&quot;King John&quot; was next for Benthall&#x27;s company and opened on 26 October 1953. The lead character initially went to an unknown and inexperienced young actor, but the part was re-cast with Hordern in the role. Hordern described &quot;King John&quot; as being &quot;a difficult play in the sense that it has no common purpose or apparent theme&quot;. Simultaneously to this, he was commuting back to Pinewood Studios where he was filming &quot;Forbidden Cargo&quot;. The hectic schedule brought on a bout of exhaustion for which he received medical advice to reduce his workload.

====Theatre Royal, Brighton====

In early 1955 Hordern was asked by the British theatre manager and producer Binkie Beaumont to take the lead in André Roussin&#x27;s comedy &quot;Nina&quot;, directed by Rex Harrison. The play, which starred Edith Evans, Lockwood West, and James Hayter, transferred from Oxford to the Theatre Royal in Brighton. Beaumont&#x27;s request came at short notice because Hordern&#x27;s predecessor had proved inadequate. The play was cursed with bad luck: Evans fell ill and was replaced midway by an understudy who neglected to learn her lines; Harrison frequently upset the cast, which resulted in reduced morale. When Evans did return, she walked off stage and left after seeing empty seats in the front row.

Hordern regretted his decision to take part in Roussin&#x27;s &quot;Nina&quot;, but admitted that the allure of appearing alongside Evans had got the better of him. Harrison held auditions to replace his leading lady and settled on the Australian-American actress Coral Browne. Hordern and Browne grew close, aided by their mutual dislike of their disciplinarian director. They fell in love and had an affair which lasted for the duration of the run. Years later Hordern confessed: &quot;I kept falling in love. It is a common complaint among actors. You cannot be at such close quarters, mind and body, without being sorely tempted.&quot;

Hordern and Harrison&#x27;s dislike for one another was evident to the rest of the cast. One night, after a performance of &quot;Nina&quot; in Eastbourne, and having felt that he had &quot;acted [his] socks off&quot;, Hordern, along with the rest of the cast, were berated by Harrison who accused them of producing a piece &quot;not fit for the end of a pier&quot;. &quot;Nina&quot; transferred to the Haymarket Theatre, London, not long after the incident but it was unsuccessful and closed after five weeks. &quot;The play was fine&quot;, opined Hordern, &quot;it was a disaster because of Rex Harrison.&quot; Hordern and Browne&#x27;s relationship ended shortly after the play closed and Hordern set about rebuilding his marriage with Eve, who had long known of the affair.

====Films and 1950s theatre====

Hordern viewed the 1950s as a good decade to appear in film, although he did not then particularly care for the medium. Writing in 1993 he said: &quot;With cinema one has to leap into battle fully armed. From the start of the film the character has to be pinned down like a butterfly on a board. One does not always get this right, of course, sometimes starting at the beginning of shooting a film on a comedic level that cannot be sustained.&quot; He disliked his physical appearance, which he found to be &quot;repulsive&quot;, and as a result loathed watching his performances. He preferred radio because the audience only heard his voice, which he then considered his best attribute. Another reason was his recognition of the differences between his sense of personal achievement within a theatre compared to that on a film set: &quot;You get a certain sort of satisfaction in delivering what the director wants of you, but the chances of being emotionally involved are slim.&quot; He acknowledged his good ability at learning lines, something which he found to be especially helpful for learning film scripts which frequently changed. He enjoyed the challenge of earning as much value as possible out of a scene and revelled in being able to hit &quot;the right mark for the camera&quot;. With the experience of &quot;Nina&quot; still fresh in his mind, Hordern took a break from the stage and decided to concentrate on his film career.

Hordern was appearing in three to four films a year by 1953 (including a small part as Jacob Marley&#x27;s ghost in &quot;Scrooge&quot;, the 1951 film adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;), a count that increased as the decade progressed. In 1956 he took a leading part in &quot;The Spanish Gardener&quot; for which he spent many months filming in southern Spain alongside Dirk Bogarde, Cyril Cusack, and Bernard Lee. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Hordern&#x27;s role of the strict and pompous Harrington Brande &quot;an unsympathetic assignment&quot;, but thought the actor did &quot;quite well&quot; in his portrayal. By the mid-1950s Hordern&#x27;s name was becoming one of reliability and good value; as a result, he was offered a clutch of roles. In 1956 he appeared as Demosthenes in &quot;Alexander the Great&quot;, and Commander Lindsay in &quot;The Night My Number Came Up&quot;. He appeared in two other films the following year; the medical drama &quot;No Time for Tears&quot;, and the thriller &quot;Windom&#x27;s Way&quot;. The Second World War was a popular genre for filmmakers during the 1950s. Hordern said the conflict took up a large part of people&#x27;s lives; &quot;whether it be one of love, loss, nostalgia or tragedy&quot;, everybody, according to the actor, had a story to tell and could relate to the situations that were being depicted before them on screen. He found his earlier naval experience to be an asset when cast in many war films, including &quot;The Man Who Never Was&quot;, &quot;Pacific Destiny&quot;, &quot;The Baby and the Battleship&quot;, all in 1956, and &quot;I Was Monty&#x27;s Double&quot; two years later.
Hordern was cast in John Mortimer&#x27;s 1957 play &quot;The Dock Brief&quot; in which Hordern played the barrister. The story centres on a failed lawyer who is hired at the last minute to defend a man on a charge of murder. Hordern played the barrister opposite David Kossoff&#x27;s murder suspect. After some positive comments from the theatrical press, the play transferred to radio in May the same year. It was broadcast on television in September, and earned Hordern a Best Actor Award at the 1958 British Academy Television Awards. The Horderns moved to Donnington, Berkshire in 1958 where they renovated three cottages into one; the property became the family home and is where Hordern and Eve remained until their deaths.

The year 1959 was professionally disastrous for Hordern. He made a return to stage at the Old Vic in Arthur Wing Pinero&#x27;s &quot;The Magistrate&quot; in which he played Mr. Posket. The play was not particularly successful and received mixed reviews: According to the author and theatre critic J. P. Wearing, Hordern was miscast, while a reporter for &quot;The Stage&quot;, thought he gave a &quot;convincing portrayal&quot;. Wearing believed that overall the play was not &quot;played briskly enough&quot;, while a critic for &quot;The Times&quot; thought that it had &quot;durable theatrical quality&quot;. The role was followed with a part of Pastor Manders in &quot;Ghosts&quot; opposite Flora Robson. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; published an unenthusiastic notice, and thought Hordern&#x27;s character had &quot;an anxious air&quot; about him. He received equally critical notices when he took to the stage to play the title character in &quot;Macbeth&quot;, opposite Beatrix Lehmann. The press wrote of Hordern&#x27;s &quot;unintended comic interpretation&quot; when characterising the evil king: &quot;Half his time on stage he cringed like an American carpet seller in an ankle-length black dressing gown of fuzzy candlewick&quot; thought one reviewer, who went on to say &quot;he would make a sinister Shylock, a frightening Fagin. But this Thane of Cawdor would be unnerved by Banquo&#x27;s valet, never mind Banquo&#x27;s ghost.&quot;

On 9 October 1959, Hordern made his debut on Broadway at the Cort Theatre in Marcel Aymé&#x27;s comedy &quot;Moonbirds&quot;, alongside the comedian Wally Cox. The play was a disaster and closed after only two nights and three performances. Little was offered in the way of praise, although critics singled out Hordern&#x27;s performance in particular as being good. He was unsure why the play failed, and attributed it to clashes of personality between cast and management.

====&quot;Cleopatra&quot; and the 1960s====

In 1960 Hordern played Admiral Sir John Tovey in the British war film &quot;Sink the Bismarck!&quot;, based on the book &quot;Last Nine Days of the Bismarck&quot; by C. S. Forester and with a plot reminiscent of his naval days. With a few smaller roles in between, Hordern started work on the American epic historical drama film &quot;Cleopatra&quot;. It was made in 1962 and, according to the actor, was &quot;the most extraordinary piece of film-making in which I had the pleasure to take part&quot;. He played the Roman orator Cicero and was hired on an eight-week contract which due to various setbacks, including cast sickness and adverse weather conditions, was extended to nine months. Much to Hordern&#x27;s annoyance, the film would require him to work once again with Rex Harrison, who was cast as Caesar. Despite the animosity between them, they agreed to endure each other&#x27;s company for the sake of the film. The agreement was short-lived; Harrison made a drunken quip at a cast dinner about &quot;Nina&quot; which prompted Hordern to assault him. The incident almost resulted in Hordern&#x27;s dismissal, but the matter was quickly resolved by producers and the two were kept separate in between filming. In 1993 Hordern claimed the incident had &quot;cleared the air&quot; between them and they eventually became friends. After &quot;Cleopatra&quot;&#x27;s release, Hordern made a return to films, appearing in &quot;The Spy Who Came In from the Cold&quot; (1965), &quot;Khartoum&quot; (1966, as Lord Granville), &quot;How I Won the War&quot; (1967), &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; (1968), and &quot;Anne of the Thousand Days&quot; (1969, as Thomas Boleyn). He was also featured in the Roman farce &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot; in 1966.

Hordern first met the British theatre director Jonathan Miller in 1968. Miller, who had long been an admirer of Hordern, offered him the part of the agonistic Professor Parkin in his forthcoming television drama &quot;Whistle and I&#x27;ll Come to You&quot;. Hordern, who had heard positive things of Miller from theatrical friends, likewise thought highly of the director, and was quick to take up location filming in Norfolk that year. He came to like Miller&#x27;s way of working, such as having the freedom to improvise instead of adhering to the strict rules of a script; the actor wrote in his autobiography that he had never experienced that degree of professional freedom. The programme was released towards the end of 1968 and was a hit with audiences and critics. Mark Duguid of the British Film Institute called it &quot;a masterpiece of economical horror that remains every bit as chilling as the day it was first broadcast&quot;, while a journalist for &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, writing in 2010 about that year&#x27;s remake starring John Hurt, reminded readers of the &quot;brilliant Sixties production by Jonathan Miller [in which] Michael Hordern made a fine, crusty Parkin&quot;. The year ended with a role in Peter Hall&#x27;s production of Edward Albee&#x27;s &quot;A Delicate Balance&quot; at the Aldwych Theatre. The piece received lukewarm reviews, with Hilary Spurling of &quot;The Spectator&quot; thinking Hordern was &quot;ill-served&quot; as the principal character, Tobias.

===Later career: 1969–1990===

====&quot;King Lear&quot;====

Miller and Hordern&#x27;s collaboration continued into 1969 with &quot;King Lear&quot; at the Nottingham Playhouse. Hordern immediately accepted the title role but later said that it was a character he never much cared to play. Writing about Miller in his autobiography, Hordern stated: &quot;It was one of the most exhilarating and funny experiences I have had in the theatre.&quot; Miller recruited Frank Middlemass to play the fool, but contrary to tradition, Miller made the character an intimate of Lear&#x27;s as opposed to a servant, something which Shakespearean purists found difficult to accept. Miller decided to further defy convention by concentrating on the relationships between the characters rather than adding detail to scenery and costume; he was eager not to use lavish sets and lighting for the fear of detracting from the characterisations and the sentimentality of the storyline. As such, the sets were bleak and the costumes more so; it was a style that was also used when the play was televised by the BBC later that decade.

When &quot;King Lear&quot; played at the Old Vic in 1970, reviews were mixed; J.W. Lambert thought that the &quot;grey sets&quot; and Hordern&#x27;s &quot;grizzled&quot; costume were how Shakespeare would have intended them to be, while Eric Shorter thought otherwise, stating &quot;I still do not understand those costumes.&quot; Of the performance, the dramatist and critic Martin Esslin called Hordern&#x27;s portrayal &quot;a magnificent creation&quot; before going on to say: &quot;Hordern&#x27;s timing of the silences from which snatches of demented wisdom emerge is masterly and illuminates the subterranean processes of his derangement.&quot; Writing for &quot;The Times&quot; later that year, the theatre critic Irving Wardle described Hordern&#x27;s Lear as a &quot;sharp, peremptory pedant; more a law-giver than a soldier, and (as justice is an old man&#x27;s profession) still in the prime of his life&quot;. Hordern played Lear once more that decade, in 1975, which was televised by the BBC for their series &quot;Play of the Month&quot;.

====&quot;Jumpers&quot;====

The playwright Tom Stoppard approached Hordern in 1971 with a view to him playing a leading part in the playwright&#x27;s new play &quot;Jumpers&quot;, a comic satire based around the field of academic philosophy. Hordern was to play George Moore, a bumbling old philosophy professor, who is employed at a modern university and who, throughout the play, is in constant debate with himself over his moral values. Hordern, though thinking the play was brilliant, disliked the script on the initial read-through as he did not understand its complex situations and strange dialogue. His co-star would be Diana Rigg, who played Moore&#x27;s wife Dotty, and the entire piece was to be directed by Peter Wood.

&quot;Jumpers&quot; was scheduled to appear at the National Theatre at the start of 1972, but encountered problems when the theatre&#x27;s director, Laurence Olivier, called the play &quot;unintelligible&quot; before walking out during the first read-through in disgust. Despite this, rehearsals went ahead, which the cast found difficult; the play featured many scenes, a complicated script, and relied heavily on the opening scene, a sceptical speech about the existence of God which lasted 13 minutes. In his autobiography, Hordern commented: &quot;Each day my fists would sink into my cardigan pockets as I tried to make sense of it all.&quot; In a meeting shortly before the opening night, Olivier complained to Stoppard that the play was overlong and, in some parts, laborious. Stoppard agreed to reduce the epilogue by half. The decision angered Hordern as it meant the extra stress of learning a new script at short notice. He vented his frustrations on Wood who agreed to leave his character alone and instead to cut many of the other scenes. The final dress rehearsal also experienced disruption when the revolving stage broke down and had to be fixed half-way through. The problems had ceased by the opening performance the following evening; it was a night which Hordern called &quot;unbelievable, one of the highlights of my career&quot;. The actress Maureen Lipman, who was in the audience on the opening night, said that her husband, the playwright Jack Rosenthal, had &quot;laughed so hard he thought he was going to be seriously ill&quot;.

The critic Michael Billington, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, gave a mixed review: &quot;Once or twice one of Stoppard&#x27;s brightly coloured balls falls to the ground, partly because Michael Hordern&#x27;s moral philosopher substitutes academic mannerism for apprehension of the argument. But this is not to deny that Hordern&#x27;s simian habit of scratching his left earlobe with right hand or leaning over his desk as if he is doing intellectual press-ups is very funny to watch or that he is brilliant at displaying cuckolded curiosity.&quot; Harold Hobson, the drama critic, thought that failing to enjoy the play was &quot;not actually a criminal offence but it is a sad evidence of illiteracy&quot;. &quot;Jumpers&quot; won the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;″s Best Play Award which, much to Hordern&#x27;s amusement, was presented by the philosopher A. J. Ayer.

====&quot;Stripwell&quot;, and voice work====
Between 1973 and 1981, Hordern appeared on radio for the BBC as Jeeves in the series &quot;What Ho! Jeeves&quot; alongside Richard Briers as Bertie Wooster. In 1974, Hordern narrated several other, one-off programmes for the broadcaster, including &quot;The Honest Broker&quot;, &quot;The Last Tsar&quot;, and &quot;Tell the King the Sky Is Falling&quot;. In 1975 Hordern played the judge in Howard Barker&#x27;s play &quot;Stripwell&quot; at the Royal Court Theatre. Hordern described the character as &quot;a man wracked by guilt, full of self-doubt and pessimism&quot;. It was a role which the actor found to be too close to his own personality for comfort. His time in the play was marred by personal problems; he and Eve had briefly separated and the actor was forced to rent a small flat in Sloane Square from the actor Michael Wilding after being banished from the family home. Hordern and Eve soon reconciled, but it was a time which he was keen to forget, including the play. Critics were complimentary of his performance, with one writing: &quot;&quot;Stripwell&quot;&#x27;s ambiguities are therefore viewed half affectionately and half contemptuously and this comes over well in Michael Hordern&#x27;s portrayal of bumbling, sometimes endearing ineffectiveness, as skilful and accomplished a performance as one would expect from this actor.&quot;

Later, in 1975, Hordern narrated &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;, Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s filmed adaptation of William Makepeace Thackeray&#x27;s novel &quot;The Luck of Barry Lyndon&quot;. The critic John Riley, writing for the British Film Institute, thought that the actor provided &quot;a witty and ironic foil to the characters&#x27; helplessness&quot;. The same year Hordern was asked to narrate 30 episodes of the children&#x27;s animation series &quot;Paddington&quot;, which was based on the Paddington Bear book series by Michael Bond. In his 1993 autobiography, Hordern wrote of his enjoyment at working on &quot;Paddington&quot; and that he could not differentiate between his enjoyment in comedy and drama: &quot;it&#x27;s a bit like difference between roast beef and meringue, both delicious in their way, but there is nothing more satisfying than a thousand people sharing their laughter with you&quot;.

====Return to Stratford-upon-Avon and &quot;Jumpers&quot; revival====

In 1976 Hordern joined the RSC in Stratford-upon-Avon, where he appeared as Prospero for Trevor Nunn in &quot;The Tempest&quot;, an engagement which the actor found to be unpleasant because of his poor relationship with the show&#x27;s director, Clifford Williams. After that came a short run of &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; in which he played Don Adriano de Armado opposite Alan Rickman and Zoë Wanamaker. Hordern was the oldest member of the company and found it difficult to adjust to the behaviour and attitudes of some of the younger and less experienced actors. He found it different from the 1950s: non-intimate, characterless, and lacking in morale because management preferred discipline rather than offering guidance and assistance to their young actors. Writing in his 1993 autobiography, Hordern wrote: &quot;Being at Stratford again after all these years was rather like being on a battleship or an aircraft carrier that doesn&#x27;t often come into harbour. You are at sea for long periods and away from the rest of your service and if the captain of your ship is a good one then the ship is happy; if not, then the commission you serve is very unhappy because you are a long way from land. At Stratford that season I was a long way from land.&quot; Later, in 1976, Hordern portrayed the kingly father of the Prince (played by Richard Chamberlain) in the musical film adaptation of &quot;Cinderella&quot;, &quot;The Slipper and the Rose&quot;, for which he received a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, and returned to the role of George in Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Jumpers&quot; at the Lyttelton Theatre. The theatre critic Kenneth Hurren &quot;enjoyed it immoderately&quot; and thought the revival revealed a &quot;tidier play than it look[ed]&quot;. Hordern compared it to the 1972 version by saying: &quot;It is unquestionably a busy little number, and my first impression of the piece, back in 1972, was that it had more decoration than substance, and that the decoration was more chaotic than coherent.&quot;

====Television and radio: 1980–83====

In 1981 Hordern played the role of Gandalf in the BBC radio adaptation of Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. The BBC&#x27;s budget was generous, and attracted well-known actors from stage and television. The series ran for 26 episodes and was a hit with audiences and critics. The author Ernest Mathijs singled out Hordern in particular as being one of the more powerful characters of the series and his personal favourite, while co-star Ian Holm, writing years later in his autobiography &quot;Acting My Life&quot;, said he thought Hordern interpreted the role &quot;in a grand, rather old fashioned way&quot;. Writing in his autobiography in 1993, Hordern said he found the part of Gandalf to be &quot;a bit of a slog&quot;.

Hordern and Jonathan Miller reprised their collaboration in 1982 with a final performance of &quot;King Lear&quot; for the BBC Television Shakespeare production. The actor considered this version to be his best and attributed its success to the fact he was getting older and therefore able to better understand the character. The author Joseph Pearce, writing in 2008, claimed that Hordern played the king &quot;straight up with no gloss&quot; and made a &quot;reliable and workmanlike Lear&quot; who is &quot;forceful when he should be forceful, compassionate when he should be compassionate, [and] sorrowful when he should be sorrowful&quot;. Despite the praise, Pearce thought that Hordern&#x27;s performance in Act3 &quot;lack[ed] the required fierceness and miss[ed] the mythic quality when compared to some of the bigger names&quot;.

In January 1983 Hordern was knighted, an honour which the actor called &quot;a great thrill and [a] surprise to us all&quot;. That year he became popular among children as the voice of Badger in the ITV film &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;. He then spent the rest of 1983 appearing as Sir Anthony Absolute in &quot;The Rivals&quot; for Peter Wood at the Royal National Theatre and received excellent notices. He was nominated for an award at that year&#x27;s Olivier Awards for best comedy performance of the year, but lost out to Griff Rhys Jones. His success on the stage was tinged with private turmoil; Eve was taken ill after she suffered a brain haemorrhage, a condition from which she never fully recuperated. She required constant care but recovered enough to become partially self-sufficient. However, in 1986 she had a fatal heart attack at the couple&#x27;s London flat. Hordern was devastated and became consumed in self-pity, in part because of his guilt at the extramarital affairs he had had with many of his leading ladies during the marriage.

====&quot;Paradise Postponed&quot; and &quot;You Never Can Tell&quot;====

In 1986, John Mortimer, a writer whom Hordern respected greatly, engaged the actor in &quot;Paradise Postponed&quot;, an eleven-part drama which took a year to make and cost in excess of £6 million. Set in rural England, the saga depicts the struggles within British middle-class society during the post-war years. In his autobiography, Hordern described himself as &quot;a man of prejudice rather than principle&quot; and as such, had very little in common with his character, the left-wing, Marxist-loving vicar, Simeon Simcox. Despite the political differences, Hordern felt great empathy towards his character, and admired his &quot;plain, straightforward attitude to life, his dottiness, and the way he hung to his faith in a wicked world with a saintliness verging on the simple&quot;.

Hordern made a return to the London stage in 1987 after a four-year absence. The play in which he starred, &quot;You Never Can Tell&quot;, transferred to the Haymarket Theatre that December having made its debut at the Theatr Clwyd in Wales earlier that year. It was the second time the actor had appeared in the play, the first being back in Bristol fifty years previously when he starred as the youthful lead, Valentine. This time he was cast as William, the elderly waiter, a part which he considered to be &quot;a real hell to play&quot;, partly because of the many meals he had to serve up on stage, whilst at the same time trying to remember the complex script. He enjoyed the play immensely and was thrilled at its successful run. His engagement also gave him a chance to reunite with some old friends, including Irene Worth, Michael Denison and Frank Middlemass, all of whom were in the cast. Hordern admitted that, on the whole, the experience made him feel &quot;a little happier&quot; about life.

===Final years and death===

By the early 1990s Hordern was concentrating more on television. His roles were mostly those of ageing teachers, bank managers, politicians and clergymen. In 1989 he appeared alongside John Mills in an adaptation of Kingsley Amis&#x27;s &quot;Ending Up&quot;, a tale about a group of pensioners growing old together in a residential home. After that he took the part of Godfrey Colston in &quot;Memento Mori&quot;, a television film about a group of elderly friends succumbing to old age, which was adapted for television from the Muriel Spark novel of the same name. The film received excellent notices and Hordern&#x27;s performance was described as outstanding by the critic Neil Sinyard. All that was required of Hordern in his next role, the wealthy but terminally ill landowner Peter Featherstone in the BBC adaptation &quot;Middlemarch&quot;, was for him simply to lie in bed and pretend to die. It was the kind of role which he found to be most fitting for someone of his advanced years and confirmed to him that the older he got, the more typecast he became. It was a situation that did not altogether bother him as he felt grateful for being employable at the age of 81.

In January 1995 Hordern was invited back to his old college in Brighton, where a room was named in his honour. Inside, the college had commissioned the sculptor Peter Webster to create a bronze bust of the actor which is displayed with a plaque. Hordern&#x27;s last physical acting role came shortly afterwards as Lord Langland in the comedy film &quot;A Very Open Prison&quot;. This was followed by two narration performances, firstly in &quot;Spode A History of Excellence&quot;, and then in the five-part film &quot;Dinosaurs and Their Living Relatives&quot;.

Hordern died of kidney disease at the Churchill Hospital, Oxford, on 2May 1995, aged 83. Medical staff confirmed that he had been suffering from &quot;a long illness and had been receiving dialysis treatment&quot;.

==Approach to acting==

Hordern was a self-confessed &quot;lazy bugger&quot; when it came to role preparation. He did not regret his lack of formal acting training, and attributed his abilities to watching and learning from other actors and directors. He said: &quot;I am bored of the intellectual view of the theatre. Actually, it scares the shit out of me, my view being that an actor should learn the lines without too much cerebral interference.&quot; In 1951, he asked Byam Shaw how best to rehearse unfamiliar roles. The director advised him to &quot;never read up on them&quot; before going on to say &quot;read the plays as much as [you like] but never read the commentators or critics&quot;. It was advice which Hordern adopted for the role of King Lear, and for the rest of his career. The critic Brian McFarlane, writing for the British Film Institute, said that Hordern, despite his relaxed attitude, &quot;had one of the most productive careers of any 20th century British actor&quot;.

Throughout his 1993 autobiography &quot;A World Elsewhere&quot;, Hordern exhibited his pride on being able to play a wide range of parts, something which made him a frequent subject among theatrical critics. The author Martin Banham thought that many of Hordern&#x27;s characters shared a general identity of &quot;an absent-minded, good-hearted English eccentric&quot;. The American journalist Mel Gussow, writing Hordern&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1995, described him as &quot;a classical actor with the soul of a clown&quot;. The actors John Hurt and Michael Bryant considered Hordern &quot;the Austin Princess among British actors&quot;, which implied to the author Sheridan Morley that Hordern possessed an element of &quot;reliability but [with] a faint lack of charisma&quot;. Morley, who wrote Hordern&#x27;s biography for the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, went on to describe the actor as being &quot;one of the great eccentrics of his profession, perched perilously somewhere half way between Alastair Sim and Alec Guinness&quot;.

<text>Robert William Hoskins (26 October 1942 – 29 April 2014) was an English actor and film director. Known for his intense but sensitive portrayals of &quot;tough guy&quot; characters, he began his career on stage before making his screen breakthrough playing Arthur Parker on the 1978 BBC Television serial &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot;. He subsequently played acclaimed lead roles in the films &quot;The Long Good Friday&quot; (1980), &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; (1986), &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (1988), &quot;Mermaids&quot; (1990) and &quot;The Good Pope: Pope John XXIII&quot; (2002).

Hoskins had supporting roles in &quot;Pink Floyd – The Wall&quot; (1982), &quot;The Honorary Consul&quot; (1983), &quot;The Cotton Club&quot; (1984), &quot;Brazil&quot; (1985), &quot;Hook&quot; (1991), &quot;Nixon&quot; (1995), &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot; (2001), &quot;Maid in Manhattan&quot; (2002), &quot;Mrs Henderson Presents&quot; (2005), &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (2009), &quot;Made in Dagenham&quot; (2010), and &quot;Snow White and the Huntsman&quot; (2012). He portrayed Mario in the 1993 film &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, based on the video game of the same name, and voiced Boris Goosinov in the animated film &quot;Balto&quot; (1995). Hoskins also directed two feature films: &quot;The Raggedy Rawney&quot; (1988) and &quot;Rainbow&quot; (1996).

Hoskins received the Best Actor Award at the Cannes Film Festival, the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama for his role in &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;. Hoskins won a Canadian Genie Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for &quot;Felicia&#x27;s Journey&quot;. In 2009, he won an International Emmy Award for Best Actor for his appearance on the BBC One drama &quot;The Street&quot;. Hoskins retired from acting in 2012 owing to Parkinson&#x27;s disease after being diagnosed the previous year. He died in April 2014 from pneumonia.

== Early life ==
Robert William Hoskins was born in Bury St Edmunds on 26 October 1942, the son of Elsie (née Hopkins), a cook and nursery school teacher, and Robert Hoskins, a bookkeeper and lorry driver. One of his grandmothers was Romani. From two weeks old, he was brought up in the Finsbury Park area of London. He attended Stroud Green Secondary School, where he was written off as &quot;stupid&quot; on account of his dyslexia. He left school at 15 with a single O-Level and worked as a porter, lorry driver, plumber, and window cleaner. He started but did not complete a three-year accountancy course. He spent six months on a kibbutz in Israel and two years tending to the camels of a Bedouin tribe in Syria.

== Career ==

Hoskins&#x27;s acting career began in 1968 at the Victoria Theatre in Stoke-on-Trent, in a production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; in which he played a servant named Peter. A year later, while waiting in the bar at Unity Theatre, London, for his friend the actor Roger Frost, Hoskins found himself being auditioned for a play after being handed a script and told, &quot;You&#x27;re next.&quot; His audition was successful and Frost became his understudy. Frost considered Hoskins &quot;a natural&quot;, recalling that &quot;he just got up on stage and was brilliant&quot;.

In late 1969, he was part of Bolton&#x27;s Octagon Theatre outreach troupe, which became the Ken Campbell Roadshow.

Hoskins&#x27;s London theatre career included portraying a &quot;vigorous&quot; Alfred Doolittle in a West End production of Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Pygmalion&quot; opposite Diana Rigg at the Albery Theatre in 1974, and in a Royal Shakespeare Company production of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot; at the Aldwych Theatre in 1976 as Rocky the bartender, opposite Patrick Stewart. In 1981, he starred with Helen Mirren in &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot; at the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester and the London Roundhouse.

Hoskins&#x27;s first major television role was in &quot;On the Move&quot; (1975–1976), an educational drama series directed by Barbara Derkow aimed at tackling adult illiteracy. He portrayed the character Alf Hunt, a removal man who had problems reading and writing. According to producer George Auckland, up to 17 million people watched the series. His breakthrough in television came later in the original BBC version of Dennis Potter&#x27;s 6-part drama &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot; (1978), in which he portrayed adulterous sheet music salesman Arthur Parker. He later played Iago (opposite Anthony Hopkins) in Jonathan Miller&#x27;s BBC Television Shakespeare production of &quot;Othello&quot; (1981). In 1983, Hoskins voiced an advert for Weetabix and, during the late 1980s and early 1990s, he appeared in advertising for British Gas and British Telecom (now BT Group). Other television work included &quot;Flickers&quot;, portraying Wilkins Micawber in &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; (2006).

British films such as &quot;The Long Good Friday&quot; (1980) and &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; (1986) won him the wider approval of critics, the latter film winning him a Cannes Award, Best Actor Golden Globe, BAFTA Awards and an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor.

Hoskins&#x27;s other film parts included Spoor in Terry Gilliam&#x27;s &quot;Brazil&quot; (1985), Smee in &quot;Hook&quot; (1991) and in &quot;Neverland&quot; (2011), starring opposite Cher in &quot;Mermaids&quot; (1990), portraying Nikita Khrushchev as a political commissar in &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot; (2001) and playing Uncle Bart, the violent psychopathic &quot;owner&quot; of Jet Li in &quot;Unleashed&quot; (2005, aka &quot;Danny the Dog&quot;). He had a small role as the protagonist&#x27;s rock and roll manager in &quot;The Wall&quot; (1982) and, in 1997, had a cameo as Ginger Spice&#x27;s disguise in the Spice Girls&#x27; film, &quot;Spice World&quot;. He directed two films that he also starred in: &quot;The Raggedy Rawney&quot; (1988) and &quot;Rainbow&quot; (1996), and produced &quot;Mrs Henderson Presents&quot; alongside Norma Heyman, for which he was nominated as Golden Globe Best Supporting Actor for his performance in the film.
A high point in Hoskins&#x27;s career was portraying the private investigator Edward &quot;Eddie&quot; Valiant in the live-action/animated family blockbuster, &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (1988). Hoskins was not the first choice for the role – Harrison Ford, Bill Murray and Eddie Murphy were all considered for the part. Film critics, among them Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, agreed that Hoskins was perfect for the role. As his character interacts and makes physical contact with animated characters in the film, Hoskins was required to take mime training courses in preparation. He experienced hallucinations for months after production on the film had ended. He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and won a British Evening Standard Award for his performance.

Hoskins&#x27;s portrayal of the Los Angeles investigator Valiant was one of several roles where he used an American accent; he was described by Trey Barrineau of &quot;USA Today&quot; as having &quot;a knack for playing Americans better than most American actors could&quot;. Others included Rocky the bartender in the play &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot; (1976), gangster Owney Madden in Francis Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Cotton Club&quot; (1984), Gus Klein in Wolfgang Petersen&#x27;s &quot;Shattered&quot; (1991),  Mario in &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; (1993), J. Edgar Hoover in Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Nixon&quot; (1995), and Eddie Mannix in &quot;Hollywoodland&quot; (2006). He was slated to be the last-minute replacement in case Robert De Niro refused the role of Al Capone in &quot;The Untouchables&quot; (1987).

In a 1988 interview with &quot;Fresh Air&quot; Terry Gross, when asked about many of his roles being underworld types, Hoskins said, &quot;I think if you&#x27;ve got a face like mine you don&#x27;t usually wind up with the parts that Errol Flynn played, you know?&quot;

Hoskins told &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2007 that he regretted starring as Mario in &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; (1993), saying that he was extremely unhappy with the film, greatly angered by his experiences making it, and referring to it as the &quot;worst thing I ever did&quot;. Hoskins was injured several times on set, spent most of the time with co-star John Leguizamo getting drunk to escape boredom, and was not aware that the film was based on a video game until he was informed later by his son. In a 2011 interview, he was asked, &quot;What is the worst job you&#x27;ve done?&quot;, &quot;What has been your biggest disappointment?&quot;, and &quot;If you could edit your past, what would you change?&quot; His answer to all three was &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;

In 2007, Hoskins appeared in the music video for Jamie T&#x27;s single &quot;Sheila&quot;. In 2009, he returned to television for Jimmy McGovern&#x27;s drama serial &quot;The Street&quot;, playing a publican who opposes a local gangster. For this role, he received his only Emmy: Best Actor at the 2010 International Emmys. The 2011 film &quot;In Search of La Che&quot; features a character &quot;Wermit,&quot; whose every line of dialogue is a quote from Bob Hoskins. On 8 August 2012, Hoskins announced his retirement from acting, having been diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease in 2011.

== Personal life ==
With his first wife Jane Livesey, Hoskins had two children: Alex (b. 1968) and Sarah (b. 1972). With his second wife, Linda Banwell, he had two more children: Rosa (b. ) and Jack (b. ). Hoskins divided his time between the Hampstead area of London and Chiddingly, East Sussex.

Later in life, Hoskins gave up drinking alcohol. He said that his wife persuaded him to go sober.

When asked in an interview which living person he most despised, Hoskins named Tony Blair and said, &quot;He&#x27;s done even more damage than Thatcher.&quot; He hated Blair to the point that he decided in 2010, for the first time in his life, not to vote for Labour, by then led by Gordon Brown.

Hoskins often made light of his similarities with film actor Danny DeVito, who he joked would play him in a film about his life.

== Illness and death ==

Hoskins was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease in 2011. He retired from acting in August 2012. On 29 April 2014, Hoskins died of pneumonia at a London hospital, aged 71. He was survived by his wife Linda and his four children.

Among actors who paid tribute at his funeral were Stephen Fry, Samuel L. Jackson, and Helen Mirren. Hoskins is buried in Highgate Cemetery in London.

<text>The , frequently abbreviated to LDP or , is a major conservative and nationalist political party in Japan. Since its foundation in 1955, the LDP has been in power almost continuously—a period called the 1955 System—except between 1993 and 1994, and again from 2009 to 2012. 

The LDP was formed in 1955 as a merger of two conservative parties, the Liberal Party and the Japan Democratic Party, and was initially led by prime minister Ichirō Hatoyama. The LDP supported Japan&#x27;s alliance with the United States and fostered close links between Japanese business and government, playing a major role in the country&#x27;s economic miracle from the 1960s to early 1970s and subsequent stability under prime ministers including Hayato Ikeda, Eisaku Satō, Kakuei Tanaka, Takeo Fukuda, and Yasuhiro Nakasone. Scandals and economic difficulties led to the LDP losing power between 1993 and 1994, and governing under a non-LDP prime minister from 1994 to 1996. The LDP regained stability during the premiership of Junichiro Koizumi in the 2000s before achieving its worst-ever electoral result in the 2009 election. The party regained control of the government in a landslide victory at the 2012 election under Shinzo Abe. After the 2024 and 2022 elections the LDP currently holds 191 seats in the House of Representatives and 119 seats in the House of Councillors; the party has governed in coalition with Komeito since 1999. Since the 2017 general election, the Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP) has been its primary opponent in national politics.

The LDP is often described as a big tent conservative party, including factions that range from moderate conservatism to right-wing nationalism. Although lacking a cohesive political ideology, the party&#x27;s platform has historically supported increased defense spending and, since the 21st century, maintaining close relations with its Indo-Pacific allies to counter the rise of China as a superpower. The party&#x27;s history and internal composition has been characterized by intense factionalism among its members since its emergence in 1955. Shigeru Ishiba, Japan&#x27;s incumbent prime minister, has served as party president since 27 September 2024.

==History==
===Beginnings===

The LDP was formed in 1955 as a merger between two of Japan&#x27;s political parties, the and the , both conservative parties, as a united front against the then popular , now the . The party won the following elections, and Japan&#x27;s first conservative government with a majority was formed by 1955. It would hold majority government until 1993.

The LDP began with reforming Japan&#x27;s international relations, ranging from entry into the United Nations, to establishing diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union. Its leaders in the 1950s also made the LDP the main government party, and in all the elections of the 1950s, the LDP won the majority vote, with the only other opposition coming from left-wing politics, made up of the Japan Socialist Party and the Japanese Communist Party.

From the 1950s to the early 1970s, the United States Central Intelligence Agency spent millions of dollars to aid the LDP against leftist parties such as the Socialists and the Communists, although this was not revealed until the mid-1990s when it was exposed by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Details remain classified, while available documents show connections to prime ministers Nobusuke Kishi and Eisaku Satō from the Satō–Kishi–Abe family.

===1960s to 1990s===
For the majority of the 1960s, the LDP (and Japan) were led by Eisaku Satō, beginning with the hosting of the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, and ending in 1972 with Japanese neutrality in the Vietnam War and with the beginning of the Japanese asset price bubble. By the end of the 1970s, the LDP went into its decline, where even though it held the reins of government many scandals plagued the party, while the opposition (now joined with the Kōmeitō (1962–1998)) gained momentum.

In 1976, in the wake of the Lockheed bribery scandals, a handful of younger LDP Diet members broke away and established their own party, the New Liberal Club (Shin Jiyu Kurabu). A decade later, however, it was reabsorbed by the LDP.

By the late 1970s, the Japan Socialist Party, the Japanese Communist Party, and the Komeito along with the international community used major pressure to have Japan switch diplomatic ties from Taiwan (Republic of China) to the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

In 1983, the LDP was a founding member of the International Democracy Union.
The LDP managed to consistently win elections for over three decades, and the LDP&#x27;s decades in power allowed it to establish a highly stable process of policy formation. This process would not have been possible if other parties had secured parliamentary majorities. LDP strength was based on an enduring, although not unchallenged, coalition of big business, small business, agriculture, professional groups, and other interests. Elite bureaucrats collaborated closely with the party and interest groups in drafting and implementing policy. In a sense, the party&#x27;s success was a result not of its internal strength but of its weakness. It lacked a strong, nationwide organization or consistent ideology with which to attract voters. Its leaders were rarely decisive, charismatic, or popular. But it functioned efficiently as a locus for matching interest group money and votes with bureaucratic power and expertise. This arrangement resulted in corruption, but the party could claim credit for helping to create economic growth and a stable, middle-class Japan. 

Despite winning the 1986 general election by a landslide, by the end of 1980s, the LDP started to suffer setbacks in elections due to unpopular policies on trade liberalisation and tax, as well as a scandal involving their leader Sōsuke Uno and the Recruit scandal. The party lost its majority in the House of Councillors for the first time in 34 years in the 1989 election.

===Out of power===
The LDP managed to hold on to power in 1990 Japanese general election despite some losses. In June 1993, 10 members of the party&#x27;s liberal-conservative faction split to form the New Party Sakigake. The end of the postwar miracle economy, the Japanese asset price bubble and other reasons such as the recruit scandal led to the LDP losing its majority in 1993 Japanese general election held in July of that year.

Seven opposition parties – including several formed by LDP dissidents – formed the Hosokawa government headed by Japan New Party leader and LDP dissident Morihiro Hosokawa, who became the Prime Minister preceded by Kiichi Miyazawa. However, the LDP was still far and away the largest party in the House of Representatives, with well over 200 seats; no other individual party crossed the 80-seat mark. Yohei Kono became the president of the LDP preceded by Kiichi Miyazawa, he was the first non-prime minister LDP leader as the leader of the opposition.

In 1994, the Japan Socialist Party and New Party Sakigake left the ruling coalition, joining the LDP in the opposition. The remaining members of the coalition tried to stay in power as the minority Hata Cabinet under the leadership of Tsutomu Hata, but this failed when the LDP and the Socialists, bitter rivals for 40 years, formed a majority coalition. The Murayama Cabinet was dominated by the LDP, but it allowed Socialist Tomiichi Murayama to occupy the Prime Minister&#x27;s chair until 1996 when the LDP&#x27;s Ryutaro Hashimoto took over.

===1996–2009===
In the 1996 election, the LDP made some gains but was still 12 seats short of a majority. However, no other party could possibly form a government, and Hashimoto formed a solidly LDP minority government. Through a series of floor-crossings, the LDP regained its majority within a year.

The party was practically unopposed until 1998 when the opposition Democratic Party of Japan was formed. This marked the beginning of the opposing parties&#x27; gains in momentum, especially in the 2003 and 2004 Parliamentary Elections, that would not slow for another 12 years.

In the dramatically paced 2003 House of Representatives elections, the LDP won 237 seats, while the DPJ won 177 seats. In the 2004 House of Councillors elections, in the seats up for grabs, the LDP won 49 seats and the DPJ 50, though in all seats (including those uncontested) the LDP still had a total of 114. Because of this electoral loss, former Secretary-General Shinzo Abe turned in his resignation, but Party President Koizumi merely demoted him in rank, and he was replaced by Tsutomu Takebe.

On 10 November 2003, the New Conservative Party (&quot;Hoshu Shintō&quot;) was absorbed into the LDP, a move which was largely because of the New Conservative Party&#x27;s poor showing in the 2003 general election. The LDP formed a coalition with the conservative Buddhist New Komeito (party founded by Soka Gakkai) from Obuchi Second shuffle Cabinet (1999–2000).

After a victory in the 2005 Japanese general election, the LDP held an absolute majority in the Japanese House of Representatives and formed a coalition government with the New Komeito Party. Shinzo Abe succeeded then-Prime Minister Junichirō Koizumi as the president of the party on 20 September 2006. The party suffered a major defeat in the election of 2007, however, and lost its majority in the upper house for the first time in its history.

The LDP remained the largest party in both houses of the Diet, until 29 July 2007, when the LDP lost its majority in the upper house.

In a party leadership election held on 23 September 2007, the LDP elected Yasuo Fukuda as its president. Fukuda defeated Tarō Asō for the post, receiving 330 votes against 197 votes for Aso. However Fukuda resigned suddenly in September 2008, and Asō became Prime Minister after winning the presidency of the LDP in a five-way election.

In the 2009 general election, the LDP was roundly defeated, winning only 118 seats—easily the worst defeat of a sitting government in modern Japanese history, and also the first real transfer of political power in the post-war era. Accepting responsibility for this severe defeat, Aso announced his resignation as LDP president on election night. Sadakazu Tanigaki was elected leader of the party on 28 September 2009, after a three-way race, becoming only the second LDP leader who was not simultaneously prime minister.

===2009–present===
The party&#x27;s support continued to decline, with prime ministers changing rapidly, and in the 2009 House of Representatives elections the LDP lost its majority, winning only 118 seats, marking the only time they would be out of the majority other than a brief period in 1993. Since that time, numerous party members have left to join other parties or form new ones, including , the and the . The party had some success in the 2010 House of Councilors election, netting 13 additional seats and denying the DPJ a majority. Abe became the president again in September 2012 after a five-way race. The LDP returned to power with its ally New Komeito after winning a clear majority in the lower house general election on 16 December 2012 after just over three years in opposition. Shinzo Abe became Prime Minister for the second time preceded by Yoshihiko Noda who was the leader of the DPJ.

In July 2015, the party pushed for expanded military powers to fight in foreign conflict through Shinzo Abe and the support of Komeito.

Yoshihide Suga took over from Shinzo Abe in September 2020 after a three-way race. After Suga declined to run for re-election, successor Fumio Kishida led the party to a victory in the October 2021 Japanese general election after a four-way race, defying expectations. Despite support dropping in 2022 after the assassination of Shinzo Abe over connections between various party members and the Unification Church, the party had a good showing in the 2023 Japanese unified local elections, winning over half of the 2260 prefectural assembly seats being contested and six governorship positions.

From 18 to 19 January 2024, following a scandal involving failure to report and misuse of ¥600 million in campaign funds by members of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan&#x27;s conservative Seiwa Seisaku Kenkyūkai and Shisuikai factions in violation of Japanese campaign finance and election law, three factions (Seiwa Seisaku Kenkyūkai, Shisuikai, in addition to PM Kishida&#x27;s Kōchikai) all announced their intention to dissolve entirely in hopes of restoring public trust. Several LDP lawmakers were indicted, including incumbent lawmakers Yasutada Ōno and Yaichi Tanigawa, who both resigned from the party following their indictments.

In the 2024 Japanese general election, the governing LDP and its coalition partner Komeito lost their parliamentary majority in the lower house for the first time since 2009, with the LDP suffering its second-worst result in its history, securing only 191 seats. The Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP), the main opposition party led by former Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, achieved its best result in its history, increasing its seat count from 96 to 148. This was the first general election in Japan since the 1955 election wherein no party secured at least 200 seats.
The election outcome is largely attributed to a major slush fund scandal that emerged in November. Millions of yen raised at LDP faction events were illegally funneled into secret accounts, violating political financing laws. This scandal implicated 82 lawmakers from both parliamentary houses, including factions associated with former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and then-Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. The scandal, combined with low approval ratings and economic stagnation, led to Kishida&#x27;s resignation in August. His successor, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, called for a snap election in September to bolster support. However, the LDP&#x27;s attempts to distance itself from the scandal backfired when reports surfaced that the party continued to provide funds to chapters headed by implicated members. In response to the election results, the prime minister has committed to implementing fundamental reforms regarding money in politics. The LDP&#x27;s coalition partner, Komeito, also performed poorly, with its leader Keiichi Ishii losing his seat and subsequently announcing his resignation. This electoral setback is particularly significant for the LDP, which has held power almost continuously since 1955, highlighting the impact of the corruption scandal on public trust in the party.

==Ideology and political stance==

The LDP is usually associated with conservatism, Japanese nationalism and being on the political right of the political spectrum. The LDP has been described as a variety of disparate ideologies such as conservative-liberal, liberal-conservative, social-conservative, ultranationalist, and ultraconservative. The party though has not espoused a well-defined, unified ideology or political philosophy, due to its long-term government, and has been described as a &quot;catch-all&quot; party.

The LDP members hold a variety of positions that could be broadly defined as being to the right of main opposition parties. Many of its ministers, including former Prime Ministers Fumio Kishida, Yoshihide Suga and Shinzo Abe, are/were affiliated with the parliamentary league of Nippon Kaigi, a far-right ultraconservative lobby group. In Japanese politics, the convention is to classify the Liberal Democratic Party and the Japanese Communist Party as occupying the conservative and progressive ends of the ideological spectrum respectively. However, this classification has faced challenges, especially among younger generations, since the 1990s.

The LDP has also been compared to the corporatist-inspired model of conservative parties, such as the Christian Democratic Union of Germany, in its relative openness towards economic interventionism, mixed market coordination and public expenditure, when compared to neoliberal orthodoxy.

=== History ===
In the case of the LDP administration under the 1955 System in Japan, their degree of economic control was stronger than that of Western conservative governments; it was also positioned closer to social democracy. Since the 1970s, the oil crisis has slowed economic growth and increased the resistance of urban citizens to policies that favor farmers. To maintain its dominant position, the LDP sought to expand party supporters by incorporating social security policies and pollution measures advocated by opposition parties. It was also historically closely positioned to corporate statism.

=== 2021 manifesto ===
During the 2021 general election, the party released the LDP policy manifesto, titled &quot;Create a new era together with you&quot;, which included support for policies such as:
* Wealth redistribution to revive the Japanese economy and empowering the middle class
* Tax breaks for corporations willing to raise wages
* Advance administrative reforms to facilitate digitalization
* High investment in science and technology and increased funds for university research
* Secure robust supply chains for critical materials, such as rare earths
* Continued development of nuclear fusion power generation, and expansion of renewable energy to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050
* Reaching UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goals targets
* Offer subsidies for enterprises if they move into new industries
* Electronic COVID-19 vaccine passports
* Expanding support for small and medium businesses hit by the COVID-19 pandemic 
* Constitutional amendments, including the proposed Japanese constitutional referendum to formalize the current existence of the Japan Self-Defense Forces in Article 9 of the Constitution and creating an emergency response clause
* Raising Japan&#x27;s defense budget from the current 1% to &quot;two percent or more&quot; of gross domestic product (GDP) and enhancing Japan&#x27;s defense capabilities
* Advance understanding of LGBT rights, although the party is not in favor of same-sex marriage, with 50% of its election candidates being &quot;undecided&quot; and those opposed largely outnumbering those in favor
* Acceptance of foreign workers and improving management to cover labor shortages
* Support Taiwan&#x27;s bid to join the CPTPP agreement and WHO observer status
* Promoting further nuclear disarmament and nuclear nonproliferation

==Factions==
Since the genesis of the Liberal Democratic Party in 1955, history and internal composition has been characterized by intense factionalism among its members since its emergence in 1955. Despite the change of factions, their history can be traced back to their 1955 roots, a testament to the stability and institutionalized nature of Liberal Democratic Party factions. The party&#x27;s history and internal composition have been characterized by intense factionalism ever since its emergence in 1955, with its parliamentary members currently split among six factions, each of which vies for influence in the party and the government.

All major factions that have existed in the history of the party can be categorised into the following two groups: the Conservative Mainstream (保守本流), which originated from Shigeru Yoshida&#x27;s Liberal Party, and the Conservative Substream (保守傍流), which traces its roots to Ichirō Hatoyama&#x27;s Japan Democratic Party.

The Conservative Mainstream has traditionally been associated with moderate, welfarist, and centrist policies and has included the Kōchikai (historical members include Hayato Ikeda, Masayoshi Ōhira, Kiichi Miyazawa, Fumio Kishida, and Yoshimasa Hayashi), the (Kakuei Tanaka), and the Heisei Kenkyūkai (formerly Keiseikai, with historical members include Noboru Takeshita, Keizō Obuchi, Ryutarō Hashimoto, and Toshimitsu Motegi). The only extant faction, Shikōkai, is part of this group.

The Conservative Substream, on the other hand, has typically included hard-line and nationalistic factions such as the Seiwa Seisaku Kenkyūkai (Takeo Fukuda, Shintarō Abe, Junichirō Koizumi, and Shinzō Abe) and the Shisuikai (formerly Seisaku Kagaku Kenkyūjo, associated with Yasuhiro Nakasone, Bunmei Ibuki, Shizuka Kamei, and Toshihiro Nikai). A notable exception within this group was the Banchō Seisaku Kenkyūjo (founded by Takeo Miki and Kenzō Matsumura), which was known for its leftist and progressive policies.

In the aftermath of the slush fund scandal involving members of the Seiwa Seisaku Kenkyūkai and the Shisuikai, then-party president and prime minister Fumio Kishida decided to dissolve all factions in January 2024. All factions, except for Shikōkai, led by former prime minister Tarō Asō, complied with this directive, making it the only extant faction.
==Structure==
At the apex of the LDP&#x27;s formal organization is the , who can serve three three-year terms. (The presidential term was increased from two years to three years in 2002 and from two to three terms in 2017). When the party has a parliamentary majority, the party president is the prime minister. The choice of party president is formally that of a party convention composed of Diet members and local LDP figures, but in most cases, they merely approved the joint decision of the most powerful party leaders. To make the system more democratic, Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda introduced a &quot;primary&quot; system in 1978, which opened the balloting to some 1.5 million LDP members. The process was so costly and acrimonious, however, that it was subsequently abandoned in favor of the old &quot;smoke-filled room&quot; method—so-called in allusion to the notion of closed discussions held in small rooms filled with tobacco smoke.

After the party president, the most important LDP officials are the Secretary-General (&quot;kanjicho&quot;), the chairmen of the LDP Executive Council (&quot;somukaicho&quot;), and of the .

===Leadership===
As of 12 November 2024:
==Membership==
The LDP had over 5.5 million party members in 1991. By December 2017, membership had dropped to approximately one million members. In 2023, the LDP had 1,091,075 members, a decrease of 33,688 from the year before.

==Performance in national elections until 1993==

Election statistics show that, while the LDP had been able to secure a majority in the twelve House of Representatives elections from May 1958 to February 1990, with only three exceptions (December 1976, October 1979, and December 1983), its share of the popular vote had declined from a high of 57.8% in May 1958 to a low of 41.8% in December 1976, when voters expressed their disgust with the party&#x27;s involvement in the Lockheed scandal. The LDP vote rose again between 1979 and 1990. Although the LDP won an unprecedented 300 seats in the July 1986 balloting, its share of the popular vote remained just under 50%. The figure was 46.2% in February 1990. Following the three occasions when the LDP found itself a handful of seats shy of a majority, it was obliged to form alliances with conservative independents and the breakaway New Liberal Club. In a cabinet appointment after the October 1983 balloting, a non-LDP minister, a member of the New Liberal Club, was appointed for the first time. On 18 July 1993, in lower house elections, the LDP fell so far short of a majority that it was unable to form a government.

In the upper house, the July 1989 election represented the first time that the LDP was forced into a minority position. In previous elections, it had either secured a majority on its own or recruited non-LDP conservatives to make up the difference of a few seats.

The political crisis of 1988–89 was testimony to both the party&#x27;s strength and its weakness. In the wake of a succession of issues—the pushing of a highly unpopular consumer tax through the Diet in late 1988, the Recruit insider trading scandal, which tainted virtually all top LDP leaders and forced the resignation of Prime Minister Takeshita Noboru in April (a successor did not appear until June), the resignation in July of his successor, Uno Sōsuke, because of a sex scandal, and the poor showing in the upper house election—the media provided the Japanese with a detailed and embarrassing dissection of the political system. By March 1989, popular support for the Takeshita cabinet as expressed in public opinion polls had fallen to 9%. Uno&#x27;s scandal, covered in magazine interviews of a &quot;kiss and tell&quot; geisha, aroused the fury of female voters.

Uno&#x27;s successor, the eloquent if obscure Kaifu Toshiki, was successful in repairing the party&#x27;s battered image. By January 1990, talk of the waning of conservative power and a possible socialist government had given way to the realization that, like the Lockheed affair of the mid-1970s, the Recruit scandal did not signal a significant change in who ruled Japan. The February 1990 general election gave the LDP, including affiliated independents, a comfortable, if not spectacular, majority: 275 of 512 total representatives.

In October 1991, Prime Minister Kaifu Toshiki failed to attain passage of a political reform bill and was rejected by the LDP, despite his popularity with the electorate. He was replaced as prime minister by Miyazawa Kiichi, a long-time LDP stalwart. Defections from the LDP began in the spring of 1992, when Hosokawa Morihiro left the LDP to form the Japan New Party. Later, in the summer of 1993, when the Miyazawa government also failed to pass political reform legislation, thirty-nine LDP members joined the opposition in a no-confidence vote. In the ensuing lower house election, more than fifty LDP members formed the Shinseitō and the Sakigake parties, denying the LDP the majority needed to form a government.

<doc id="164236" wikidata="Q379991" url="?curid=164236" title="Valerius Maximus">
<text>Valerius Maximus () was a 1st-century Latin writer and author of a collection of historical anecdotes: &quot;&quot; (&quot;Nine books of memorable deeds and sayings&quot;, also known as &quot;De factis dictisque memorabilibus&quot; or &quot;Facta et dicta memorabilia&quot;). He worked during the reign of Tiberius (14 AD to 37 AD).

During the Middle Ages, Valerius Maximus was one of the most copied Latin prose authors, second only to Priscian. More than 600 medieval manuscripts of his books have survived as a result.

==Biography==
Nothing is known of his life except that his family was poor and undistinguished, and that he owed everything to Sextus Pompeius (consul AD 14), proconsul of Asia, whom he accompanied to the East in 27. Pompeius was the center of a literary circle to which Ovid belonged; he was also an intimate friend of the most literary prince of the imperial family, Germanicus. Although he shared the same name as a prestigious family of the Republic, John Briscoe says &quot;it is unlikely in the extreme&quot; that Valerius Maximus belonged to the patrician Valerii Maximi. He suggests instead that he was either a descendant of the plebeian Valerii Tappones or Triarii, or earned the Roman citizenship thanks to the patronage of a Valerius of the Republic.

His attitude towards the imperial household is controversial: he has been represented as a mean flatterer of Tiberius, of the same type as Martial. Chisholm in 1911 argued however that, if the references to the imperial administration are carefully scanned, they will be seen to be extravagant neither in kind nor in number: few will now grudge Tiberius, when his whole action as a ruler is taken into account, such a title as &quot;salutaris princeps&quot;, which seemed to a former generation a specimen of shameless adulation. A quarter of a century later still, however, H J Rose claimed that Valerius &quot;cares nothing for historical truth if by neglecting it he can flatter Tiberius, which he does most fulsomely&quot;. 

Chisholm also maintained that the few allusions to Caesar&#x27;s murderers and to Augustus hardly pass beyond the conventional style of the writer&#x27;s day; and that the only passage which can fairly be called fulsome is the violently rhetorical tirade against Sejanus.

==Work==
The style of Valerius&#x27;s writing seems to indicate that he was a professional rhetorician; and his writing represents much of the worst rhetorical tendencies of the Silver Latin age. Direct and simple statement is avoided and novelty pursued at any price, producing a clumsy obscurity. The diction is like that of poetry; the uses of words are strained; metaphors are invented; there are startling contrasts, innuendoes and epithets; variations are played upon grammatical and rhetorical figures of speech.

In his preface, Valerius intimates that his work is intended as a commonplace book of historical anecdotes for use in the schools of rhetoric, where the pupils were trained in the art of embellishing speeches by references to history. According to the manuscripts, its title is &quot;Factorum ac dictorum memorabilium libri IX&quot; (shorter title &quot;Facta et dicta memorabilia&quot;), &quot;Nine Books of Memorable Deeds and Sayings.&quot; The stories are loosely and irregularly arranged, each book being divided into sections, and each section bearing as its title the topic, most commonly some virtue or vice, or some merit or demerit, which the stories in the section are intended to illustrate.

Most of the tales are from Roman history, but each section has an appendix consisting of extracts from the annals of other peoples, principally the Greeks. The exposition exhibits strongly the two currents of feeling which are intermingled by almost every Roman writer of the Empire—the feeling that the Romans of the writer&#x27;s own day are degenerate creatures when confronted with their own republican predecessors, and the feeling that, however degenerate, the latter-day Romans still tower above the other peoples of the world, and in particular are morally superior to the Greeks.

The author&#x27;s chief sources are Cicero, Livy, Sallust and Pompeius Trogus, especially the first two. Valerius&#x27;s treatment of his material is careless and inaccurate in the extreme; but in spite of his confusions, contradictions and anachronisms, the excerpts are apt illustrations, from the rhetorician&#x27;s point of view, of the circumstance or quality they were intended to illustrate. Valerius has also used sources that are now lost, preserving some glimpses into the much debated and very imperfectly recorded reign of Tiberius; as well as some fragmentary information on Hellenistic art; and a revealing glimpse into the early imperial consensus on the need for the orderly logic and stability of the ancient Roman religion, in a politically unsettled world.

==Legacy==
The collection of Valerius was much used for school purposes, and its popularity throughout the Middle Ages is attested by the large number of manuscripts in which it has been preserved: indeed, B. G. Niebuhr went so far as to claim that it was then &quot;the most important book next to the Bible&quot;. Like other schoolbooks it was epitomised: one complete epitome, probably of the 4th or 5th century, bearing the name of Julius Paris, has come down to us; also a portion of another by . Only in the Renaissance, however, did it enter the central Latin curriculum in unabridged form, and it is then that its influence was arguably at its peak. Dante for example used Valerius for details in his account of the generosity and modesty of Pisistratus.

Although in the manuscripts of Valerius a tenth book is given, which consists of the so-called &quot;Liber de Praenominibus&quot;, this is the work of some grammarian of a much later date.

==Editions and translations==
Editions by C. Halm (1865), C. Kempf (1888), contain the epitomes of Paris and Nepotianus. New editions have been produced by R. Combès (1995-) with a French translation, J. Briscoe (1998), and D.R. Shackleton Baily (2000) with an English translation. Recent discussions of Valerius&#x27; work include W. Martin Bloomer, &quot;Valerius Maximus and the Rhetoric of the New Nobility&quot; (Chapel Hill, 1992), Clive Skidmore, &quot;Practical Ethics for Roman Gentlemen: the Work of Valerius Maximus&quot; (Exeter, 1996), and Hans-Friedrich Mueller, &quot;Roman Religion in Valerius Maximus&quot; (London, 2002).

A translation into Dutch was published in 1614, and was read by Rembrandt and other artists (and their patrons), stimulating interest in some new subjects such as Artemisia drinking her husband&#x27;s ashes.

600 manuscripts of Valerius have survived, 800 when counting epitomes, more than any other Latin prose writer after the grammarian Priscian. Most manuscripts date from the late Middle Ages, but 30 predates the 12th century. The three oldest manuscripts are the authoritative sources for the text:

* Burgerbibliothek, Bern, Switzerland, n°366 (manuscript A). 
* Laurentian Library, Florence, Italy, Ashburnham 1899 (manuscript L). Both A and L were written in northern France in the 9th century and share a common source.
* Royal Library, Brussels, Belgium, n°5336 (manuscript G). It was probably written at Gembloux Abbey (south of Brussels) in the 11th century. Briscoe says that G has a different parent from A and L, as several mistakes shared by A and L are not found in G.

<text>David Garrick (19 February 1717 – 20 January 1779) was an English actor, playwright, theatre manager and producer who influenced nearly all aspects of European theatrical practice throughout the 18th century, and was a pupil and friend of Samuel Johnson. He appeared in several amateur theatricals, and with his appearance in the title role of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot;, audiences and managers began to take notice.

Impressed by his portrayals of Richard III and several other roles, Charles Fleetwood engaged Garrick for a season at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in the West End. He remained with the Drury Lane company for the next five years and purchased a share of the theatre with James Lacy. This purchase inaugurated 29 years of Garrick&#x27;s management of the Drury Lane, during which time it rose to prominence as one of the leading theatres in Europe. At his death, three years after he retired from Drury Lane and the stage, he was given a lavish public funeral at Westminster Abbey where he was laid to rest in Poets&#x27; Corner.

As an actor, Garrick promoted realistic acting that departed from the bombastic style that was entrenched when he first came to prominence. His acting delighted many audiences and his direction of many of the top actors of the English stage influenced their styles as well. During his tenure as manager of Drury Lane, Garrick also sought to reform audience behaviour. While this led to some discontent among the theatre-going public, many of his reforms eventually did take hold. Garrick also sought reform in production matters, bringing an overarching consistency to productions that included set design, costumes and even special effects.

Garrick&#x27;s influence extended into the literary side of theatre as well. Critics are almost unanimous in saying he was not a good playwright, but his work in bringing Shakespeare to contemporary audiences is notable. In addition, he adapted many older plays in the repertoire that might have been forgotten. These included many plays of the Restoration era. Indeed, while influencing the theatre towards a better standard he also gained a better reputation for theatre people. This accomplishment led Samuel Johnson to remark that &quot;his profession made him rich and he made his profession respectable.&quot;

==Early life==
Garrick was born at the Angel Inn, Widemarsh Street, Hereford in 1717 into a family with French Huguenot roots in Languedoc, Southern France. His grandfather, David Garric, was in Bordeaux in 1685 when the Edict of Nantes was abolished, revoking the rights of Protestants in France. Grandfather Garric fled to London and his son, Peter, who was an infant at the time, was later smuggled out by a nurse when he was deemed old enough to make the journey. David Garrick became a British subject upon his arrival in Britain and later Anglicised his name to Garrick. Sometime after David Garrick&#x27;s birth the family moved to Lichfield, home to his mother. His father, a captain in the army, was a recruiting officer stationed in Gibraltar through most of young Garrick&#x27;s childhood.

Garrick was the third of seven children and his younger brother, George (1723–1779), served as an aide to David for the remainder of his life. The playwright and actor Charles Dibdin writes that George, when on occasion discovering his brother&#x27;s absence, would often inquire &quot;Did David want me?&quot; Upon Garrick&#x27;s death in 1779, it was noted that George died 48 hours later, leading some to speculate that David did indeed want him.

His nephew, Nathan Garrick, married Martha Leigh, daughter of Sir Egerton Leigh, and sister of Sir Samuel Egerton Leigh, author of &quot;Munster Abbey; a Romance: Interspersed with Reflections on Virtue and Morality&quot; (Edinburgh 1797).
At the age of 19, Garrick, who had been educated at Lichfield Grammar School, enrolled in Samuel Johnson&#x27;s Edial Hall School. Garrick showed an enthusiasm for the theatre very early on and he appeared in a school production around this time in the role of Sergeant Kite in George Farquhar&#x27;s &quot;The Recruiting Officer&quot;. After Johnson&#x27;s school was closed, he and Garrick, now friends, traveled to London together to seek their fortunes. Upon his arrival in 1737, Garrick and his brother became partners in a wine business with operations in both London and Lichfield with David taking the London operation.

The business did not flourish, possibly due to Garrick&#x27;s distraction by amateur theatricals. Playwright Samuel Foote remarked that he had known Garrick to have only three quarts of vinegar in his cellar and still called himself a wine merchant. He was supposedly a pupil at Sir Joseph Williamson&#x27;s Mathematical School.

In 1740, four years after Garrick arrived in London, and with his wine business failing, he saw his first play, a satire, &quot;Lethe: or Aesop in the Shade&quot;, produced at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Within a year he was appearing professionally, playing small parts at the Goodman&#x27;s Fields Theatre under the management of Henry Giffard. The Goodman&#x27;s Fields Theatre had been shuttered by the Licensing Act 1737 which closed all theatres that did not hold the letters patent and required all plays to be approved by the Lord Chamberlain before the performance. Garrick&#x27;s performances at the theatre were a result of Giffard&#x27;s help with Garrick&#x27;s wine business. Giffard had helped Garrick win the business of the Bedford Coffee-house, an establishment patronised by many theatrical and literary people and a location Garrick frequented.

== Professional actor ==
He made his debut as a professional actor on a summer tour to Ipswich with Giffard&#x27;s troupe in 1741, where he played Aboan in Oroonoko at the theatre in Tankard Street. He appeared under the stage name &quot;Lyddal&quot; to avoid the consternation of his family. But, while he was successful under Giffard, the managers of Drury Lane and Covent Garden rejected him. On 19 October 1741, Garrick appeared in the title role of &quot;Richard III&quot;. He had been coached in the role by the actor and playwright Charles Macklin and his natural performance, which rejected the declamatory acting style so prevalent in the period, soon was the talk of London. Of his performance at Goodman&#x27;s Fields, Horace Walpole remarked, &quot;there was a dozen dukes a night at Goodman&#x27;s Fields&quot;. Following his rousing performance, Garrick wrote to his brother requesting withdrawal from the partnership to devote his time completely to the stage. Having found success with Richard III, Garrick moved onto several other roles including Tate&#x27;s adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot; and Pierre in Otway&#x27;s &quot;Venice Preserv&#x27;d&quot; as well as comic roles such as Bayes in Buckingham&#x27;s &quot;The Rehearsal&quot;; a total of 18 roles in all in just the first six months of his acting career. His success led Alexander Pope, who saw him perform three times during this period, to surmise, &quot;that young man never had his equal as an actor, and he will never have a rival&quot;.

With his success at Goodman&#x27;s Fields, Charles Fleetwood, manager of Drury Lane, engaged Garrick to play Chaumont in Otway&#x27;s &quot;The Orphan&quot; (a role he first played in Ipswich) on 11 May 1742 while he used his letters patent to close down Giffard&#x27;s theatre. That same month, Garrick played King Lear opposite Margaret &quot;Peg&quot; Woffington as Cordelia and his popular Richard III. With these successes, Fleetwood engaged Garrick for the full 1742–43 season.

== Drury Lane ==
At the end of the London season, Garrick, along with Peg Woffington, traveled to Dublin for the summer season at the Theatre Royal, Smock Lane. While in Dublin, Garrick added two new roles to his repertoire: Shakespeare&#x27;s Hamlet, Abel Drugger in Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;The Alchemist&quot; (a role that earned him much acclaim) and Captain Plume in Farquhar&#x27;s &quot;The Recruiting Officer&quot;. Some of his success could be attributed to one of his earliest fans, John Boyle, 5th Earl of Cork, who wrote letters to many noblemen and gentlemen recommending Garrick&#x27;s acting. His writings led Garrick to exclaim that it must have been the reason he was &quot;more caressed&quot; in Dublin.

Five years after joining the acting company at Drury Lane, Garrick again traveled to Dublin for a season where he managed and directed at the Smock Alley Theatre in conjunction with Thomas Sheridan, the father of Richard Brinsley Sheridan. After his return to London, he spent some time acting at Covent Garden under John Rich while a farce of his, &quot;Miss in Her Teens&quot;, was also produced there.

With the end of the 1746–1747 season, Fleetwoods&#x27; patent on Drury Lane expired in partnership with James Lacy, Garrick took over the theatre in April 1747. The theatre had been in decline for some years, but the partnership of Garrick and Lacy led to success and accolades. The first performance under Garrick and Lacy&#x27;s management opened with an &quot;Ode to Drury Lane Theatre, on dedicating a Building and erecting a Statue, to Shakespeare&quot; read by Garrick and written by his friend, Dr Johnson. The ode promised the patrons that &quot;The drama&#x27;s law the drama&#x27;s patrons give,/For we that live to please must please to live.&quot; Certainly, this statement could be regarded as succinctly summing up Garrick&#x27;s management at Drury Lane where he was able to balance both artistic integrity and the fickle tastes of the public.
After the Woffington affair, there were several botched love affairs, including possibly fathering a son with Jane Green. Garrick met Eva Marie Veigel (1724–1822), a German dancer in opera choruses who emigrated to London in 1746. The pair wed on 22 June 1749 and were preserved together in several portraits, including one by William Hogarth. Hogarth also made several drawings and paintings of them separately. The union was childless but happy, Garrick calling her &quot;the best of women and wives&quot;, and they were famously inseparable throughout their nearly 30 years of marriage. Garrick&#x27;s increasing wealth enabled him to purchase a palatial estate for Eva Marie and himself to live in, naming it Garrick&#x27;s Villa, that he bought at Hampton in 1754. He also indulged his passion for Shakespeare by building a Temple to Shakespeare on the riverside at Hampton to house his collection of memorabilia. Hogarth collaborated with Garrick on the furnishing of this temple, and their relationship to, and self-identification with, Shakespeare has been extensively examined by Robin Simon.

In September 1769 Garrick staged the Shakespeare Jubilee in Stratford-upon-Avon. It was a major focal point in the emerging movement that helped cement Shakespeare as England&#x27;s national poet. It involved a number of events held in the town to celebrate (five years too late) 200 years since Shakespeare&#x27;s birth. In a speech made on the second day of the Jubilee in Stratford Garrick recognized the Shakespeare Ladies Club as those who &quot;restor&#x27;d Shakespeare to the Stage,&quot; protecting his fame and erecting &quot;a Monument to his and your own honor in Westminster Abbey.&quot;

No Shakespeare plays were performed during the Jubilee, and heavy rain forced a Shakespeare Pageant to be called off. The Pageant was first staged a month later at Drury Lane Theatre under the title &quot;The Jubilee&quot; and proved successful enjoying 90 performances. The song &quot;Soft Flowing Avon&quot; was composed by Thomas Arne, with lyrics by Garrick, for the Jubilee.

Garrick would manage the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, until he retired from management in 1776. In his last years he continued to add roles to his repertoire; Posthumus in &quot;Cymbeline&quot; was among his last famous roles.

== Death ==
Shortly before his death he worked on the production of &quot;The Camp&quot; with Sheridan at Drury Lane and caught a very bad cold. &quot;The Camp&quot; satirized the British response to a threatened 18th-century invasion by France, leading some to jokingly claim that Garrick was the only casualty of the ultimately abandoned invasion.

He died less than three years after his retirement, at his house in Adelphi Buildings, London, and was interred in Poets&#x27; Corner in Westminster Abbey. Mrs. Garrick survived her husband by 43 years, living to the age of 98.

== Family ==
His great-grand-niece was the soprano Malvina Garrigues and her first cousin, the Danish-American doctor Henry Jacques Garrigues.

== Legacy ==
=== An easy, natural manner ===
Perhaps it was Garrick&#x27;s acting, the most showy of his careers, that brought him the most adulation. Garrick was not a large man, only standing 5&#x27;4&quot;, and his voice is not described as particularly loud. From his first performance, Garrick departed from the bombastic style that had been popular, choosing instead a more relaxed, naturalistic style that his biographer Alan Kendall states &quot;would probably seem quite normal to us today, but it was new and strange for his day.&quot; Certainly, this new style brought acclaim: Alexander Pope stated, &quot;he was afraid the young man would be spoiled, for he would have no competitor.&quot; Garrick quotes George Lyttelton as complimenting him by saying, &quot;He told me he never knew what acting was till I appeared.&quot; Even James Quin, an actor in the old style remarked, &quot;If this young fellow be right, then we have been all wrong.&quot;

While Garrick&#x27;s praises were being sung by many, there were some detractors. Theophilus Cibber in his &quot;Two Dissertations on the Theatres&quot; of 1756 believed that Garrick&#x27;s realistic style went too far:

But Garrick&#x27;s legacy was perhaps best summarised by the historian Rev Nicolas Tindal when he said that:

=== Memorials ===
* A two-volume biography, &quot;Memoirs of the life of David Garrick, Esq. : interspersed with characters and anecdotes of his theatrical contemporaries : the whole forming a history of the stage, which includes a period of thirty-six years&quot;, was written by Thomas Davies (–1785) 
*The Garrick Club in London, named in his honour.
*Garrick&#x27;s Temple to Shakespeare, built on &quot;Garrick&#x27;s Lawn&quot; in the riverside gardens of his Villa near Hampton Court, now restored as a memorial to David Garrick and his life in Hampton, London.
*A monument to Garrick in Lichfield Cathedral bears Johnson&#x27;s famous comment:

*A carved stone medallion showing Garrick, a metre or more in diameter, is on display at Birmingham Central Library.

*Garrick was the first actor to be granted the honour of being buried in Westminster Abbey, in Poets’ Corner, in the ground in front of the monument to William Shakespeare. Later Henry Irving, the first actor to be knighted, was buried beside Garrick on the same spot. In 1989, Laurence Olivier was the third to be given that honour. 
*In 1797, a sculptural memorial to Garrick was installed on the west wall of Poet’s Corner featuring the following poem by Samuel Jackson Pratt:

* In 1811, the poet and essayist Charles Lamb published “On Garrick, and Acting”—better known as “On the Tragedies of Shakespeare: Considered with Reference to Their Fitness for Stage Representation” (1818)—in response to his encounter with the Westminster Abbey Garrick memorial and inscription.
* Cedric Hardwicke portrayed Garrick in the 1935 British film &quot;Peg of Old Drury&quot;.
* A 1937 film called &quot;The Great Garrick&quot;, directed by James Whale, is a fictional story of how Garrick&#x27;s acting skills and ego inspire the actors of the Comédie-Française to try and teach him a lesson. Brian Aherne stars as Garrick.
*In 1969, Ian McShane played Garrick in an episode of the British television series &quot;Rogues&#x27; Gallery&quot;.
*He appears as a character in the plays &quot;David Garrick&quot; (1864) and &quot;Mr Foote&#x27;s Other Leg&quot; (2015).
*A School House at King Edward VI School, Lichfield, is named after him.
*The lyrics he penned for &quot;Heart of Oak&quot; remain, with William Boyce&#x27;s music, the official March of the Royal Navy.
*Legend has it that he was so engrossed in a performance of Richard III that he was oblivious to a bone fracture, inspiring the theatrical felicitation &quot;Break a leg!&quot;.
* There was a pub in Milton Keynes named after him in the Theatre District, open from 2000 and closed in 2016.
* The Garrick Inn, reputedly Stratford-upon-Avon&#x27;s oldest pub, is named after him.
* The Garrick Bar, a Belfast pub named after him since 1870.
* The Garrick&#x27;s Head, an Urmston, Manchester pub named after him since 1830.
* Garrick&#x27;s Head pub in Bath, behind the Georgian Theatre Royal, Bath is named after him.
* Five early Lodges of the Royal Antediluvian Order of Buffaloes were named after Garrick.
* David Garrick appears as an important character in the graphic novel &quot;La pièce manquante&quot; (&quot;The Missing Play&quot;, 2023) by . The novel stars actress Peg Woffington on a quest to find William Shakespeare&#x27;s missing play &quot;The History of Cardenio&quot;, with Garrick being her insistent suitor and sometime opponent, trying to get his hands on the text before she does - but, as revealed at the end, only so that he can gift it to her in an attempt to woo her.

=== Theatre names ===

Several theatres have been named after Garrick:
*Two theatres, in London, have been named for him. The first, Garrick Theatre (Leman St) in Whitechapel opened in 1831, and closed in 1881. The second, opened in 1889 as the Garrick Theatre, still survives.
*The Lichfield Garrick Theatre takes its name from David Garrick, as does the Garrick Room, the main function suite in Lichfield&#x27;s George Hotel.
*Two amateur dramatic theatres in Greater Manchester, the Altrincham Garrick Theatre and the Stockport Garrick Theatre (1901), also take his name.
*The arts and theatre building at Hampton School is named after him.
*A Community Theatre located in Guildford (north of Perth) in Western Australia, is named after Garrick. Established in 1932, the Garrick Theatre Club is the longest continually running amateur theatre in metropolitan Perth.
*A Community Theatre located in Bonavista, Newfoundland, Canada, is named after Garrick.

<text>Johann Gottfried Kinkel (11 August 1815 – 13 November 1882) was a German poet also noted for his revolutionary activities and his escape from a Prussian prison in Spandau with the help of his friend Carl Schurz.

==Early life==
He was born at Oberkassel (now part of Bonn). Having studied theology at Bonn and Berlin, he established himself at Bonn in 1836 as a &quot;Privatdozent&quot;, or theology tutor, became master at the secondary school there, and was for a short time assistant preacher in Cologne.

Changing his religious opinions, he abandoned theology and delivered lectures on the history of art, in which he had become interested on a journey to Italy in 1837. In 1843, he married Johanna Mockel (1810–1858), a writer, composer and musician who assisted her husband in his literary work and revolutionary activities. They had four children. In 1846 he was appointed extraordinary professor of the history of art at the University of Bonn.

==Revolutionary==
In 1848, with his wife and Carl Schurz, he started a newspaper, the &quot;Bonner Zeitung&quot;, mostly devoted to following revolutionary activities, but also providing the traditional material such as musical and theatrical reviews that people expected then from a full-service newspaper.
Kinkel joined the armed rebellion in the Palatinate in 1849, believing himself to be acting legally in obedience to the directives of the Frankfurt Parliament. In a battle he was wounded and arrested and later sentenced to life imprisonment. Although the authorities originally sentenced him to be incarcerated in a fortress where he would have been able to pursue some semblance of his professional activities, Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia found this sentence to be illegal since he was not sentenced to death and &quot;graciously&quot; commuted it to lifetime imprisonment in a reformatory where his head was shaved, and he had to wear prisoner&#x27;s garb and spend his time spinning wool. He was eventually transferred to Spandau Prison in Berlin, where his friend and former student Carl Schurz helped him escape the prison at Spandau and reach London, England in November 1850.

==Exile==
===London===
In London, he joined the Communist League. Later he became involved with the August Willich-Karl Schapper group within the League and came out against Karl Marx and Frederick Engels in the split within the Communist League.

Kinkel visited the United States to raise funds for a &quot;German National Loan&quot; that was to fund revolutionary activities in Germany. Although he was enthusiastically received, and met with President Millard Fillmore, he raised very little money.

Returning to London in 1853, he taught German and public speaking for women, and lectured on German literature, art, and the history of culture. In 1858, he founded the German paper, &quot;Hermann&quot;. Johanna Kinkel lost her life in late 1858 when she fell or threw herself out of a window. In 1860, Kinkel married Minna Emilia Ida Werner, a Königsberger who was living in London. In 1863, he was appointed examiner at the University of London and other schools in England.

===Switzerland===
In 1866 he accepted a professorship of archaeology and the history of art at the Polytechnikum in Zürich, where he died 16 years later. He was never able to return to Germany. The 1920 &quot;Encyclopedia Americana&quot; speculates that it was probably his love of his native country that brought him to Zürich.

==Writings==

In the estimation of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition (1911), Kinkel&#x27;s popularity was out of proportion to his talent. &quot;Britannica&quot; characterized his poetry as of the sweetly sentimental type in vogue in Germany in the mid-19th century.

Kinkel&#x27;s &quot;Gedichte&quot; first appeared in 1843, and went through several editions. His best works were the verse romances, &quot;Otto der Schütz, eine rheinische Geschichte in zwölf Abenteuern&quot; (1846), which by 1920 had gone through over 100 editions, and &quot;Der Grobschmied von Antwerpen&quot; (1868). Among his other works were the tragedy &quot;Nimrod&quot; (1857), and &quot;Geschichte der bildenden Künste bei den christichen Völkern&quot; (A history of visual arts among Christians, 1845), &quot;Die Ahr: Landschaft, Geschichte und Volksleben&quot; (Landscape, history and life of the people along the Ahr, 1845), and &quot;Mosaik zur Kunstgeschichte&quot; (1876).

==Media==
Kinkel&#x27;s escape from Spandau is briefly dramatized in the third part (&quot;Little Germanies&quot;) of Engstfeld Film&#x27;s four-part series &quot;Germans in America&quot; (2006).

==Notes==

==References==
* This work in turn cites:
**A. Strodtmann, &quot;Gottfried Kinkel&quot; (2 vols., Hamburg, 1851). 
**Otto Henne am Rhyn, &quot;G. Kinkel, ein Lebensbild&quot; (Zürich, 1883). 
*Carl Schurz, (3 vols., New York: McClure Publ. Co., 1907). Volume One has a detailed description of Kinkel&#x27;s revolutionary activities in Bonn and his subsequent trial, imprisonment and escape from the Prussian authorities. His life in exile is also discussed in some detail up to 1852 when Schurz left Kinkel and England to emigrate to the United States.

<doc id="164256" wikidata="Q58560" url="?curid=164256" title="Qinhuangdao">
<text>Qinhuangdao (; ) is a port city on the coast of China in northern Hebei. It is administratively a prefecture-level city, about east of Beijing, on the Bohai Sea, the innermost gulf of the Yellow Sea. Its population during the 2020 national census was 3,136,879, with 1,881,047 people living in the built-up (or &#x27;metro&#x27;) area made up of four urban districts.

==History==
The city&#x27;s name &quot;Qinhuangdao&quot; literally means &quot;Qin Emperor island&quot;, and is allegedly originated from the legend that the Jieshishan Scenic Area in Changli County was the site of First Emperor of Qin&#x27;s famous ritual during his fourth and final survey tour to the east (东巡) in 210 BC. The &quot;island&quot; refers to the Nanshan area of the Port of Qinhuangdao at the southern edge of the city&#x27;s Haigang District, which used to be a small offshore island until the late Qing dynasty, when dumping of dredged silt joined it to the mainland after the Guangxu Emperor approved the port&#x27;s construction in the late 19th century.

In the 19th century, Qinhuangdao included the separate towns of Qinhuangdao and Tanghe. Both were stations along the Peking–Mukden Railway. The design and construction of the new harbour and port of Ching Wang Tao in the Gulf of Pechili was undertaken by the partnership of Sir John Wolfe-Barry and Lt Col Arthur John Barry at the turn of the 20th century.

At the beginning of the Chinese Civil War, Du Yuming&#x27;s National Revolutionary Army forces landed in the city at the beginning of the Nationalist government&#x27;s offensive against the Chinese Communist Party in Soviet-occupied Manchuria. They were unable to land further north because other ports were either occupied by the Soviet Union or already garrisoned by the military forces which would become the People&#x27;s Liberation Army.

Qinhuangdao Olympic Sports Center Stadium was used as one of the soccer venues during the 2008 Summer Olympics.

==Geography==
Qinhuangdao sits on the northwest coast of the Bohai Sea and borders Tangshan to the southwest, Chengde to the northwest, and Liaoning to the northeast. Its administrative area ranges in latitude 39° 24&#x27; to 40° 37&#x27; N and in longitude from 118° 33&#x27; to 119° 51&#x27; E, and has a total area of .

Since the elevation of Tianjin to a provincial-level municipality, Qinhuangdao is the chief port of Hebei. The Qin emperor Qin Shi Huang is said to have sought immortality on an island in Haigang District but did not find it.

Qinhuangdao has three main developed areas:
* Beidaihe: A summer seaside resort for senior government officials. Many political decisions affecting China are made here, making it the equivalent to resorts in Maine or Camp David in Maryland, United States.
* Haigang: the harbor city. Qinhuangdao proper. Home of Yan Shan University, the leading university in NE Hebei province.
* Shanhaiguan: a popular tourist destination, featuring the eastern end of the Great Wall.

Qinhuangdao&#x27;s Olympic Sports Centre Stadium was used as an Olympic Competition Venue (Football Preliminary) during the 2008 Summer Olympics.

===Climate===
Qinhuangdao has a monsoon-influenced humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dwa&quot;), with four distinct seasons. Winters are cold and dry due to the Siberian high, which often causes winds to blow in from the northwest, minimising the oceanic influence: the monthly daily average temperature in January is , colder than Beijing&#x27;s . Summers are hot and humid due to the East Asian Monsoon, often allowing onshore flows; summer is also when the coast moderates the weather the most: the average high temperature in July here is , as compared to in Beijing. As measured by daily mean temperature, July and August are equally warm, averaging . The annual mean is , and 70% of the annual precipitation falls from June to August. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 6 January 2010 to on 15 June 2017.

The Qinhuangdao Economic &amp; Technology Development Zone was approved by the State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1984 to become one of China&#x27;s first state-level economic and technological development zones. Qinhuangdao is in the heart of the rapidly growing &quot;Bohai-Rim Economic Circle&quot;, in easy reach of Beijing () and Tianjin (). It covers a sea area of and has a coastline of . The planned and controlled area of the development zone has reached . By the end of 2006, the number of approved projects reached 4,546, in which 647 projects were foreign-invested, with a total investment of US$4.73 billion.

Qinhuangdao Export Processing Zone is the first export processing zone in Hebei Province. It passed joint appraisal held by the General Administration of Customs, the State Development Planning Commission, and other six departments in 2003. Industries encouraged in the zone include electronics assembly and manufacturing, building/construction materials, computer software, trading and distribution.

==Economy==
Qinhuangdao Port is a strategically important port and is the largest coal shipping port in the country, much of which is shipped to power plants elsewhere in China. With recent expansion, its capacity has reached 209 million metric tons. The harbor is adding a further six berths to add capacity and is increasingly being invested in by other port operators, such as South Africa&#x27;s Port of Richards Bay, who have announced plans to invest US$150 million to increase capacity by at least 28 percent.

China is the world&#x27;s third largest coal exporter, and Qinhuangdao is expected to handle much of the nation&#x27;s coal exports. Rail links from Shanxi (China&#x27;s largest coal producer) to Qinhuangdao Port are being upgraded, which should allow for Qinhuangdao to ultimately increase its throughput to 400 million tonnes of coal per annum from its current level of about 250 million tons by 2015. In 2018, the updated railway reached a record annual throughput of 451 million tons.

Other Chinese and foreign service suppliers are moving to Qinhuangdao to support this. China Ocean Shipping (Group) Co, China&#x27;s biggest shipping company, expects US$49 billion of spending on ports over the next five years as the industry tackles bottlenecks created by the nation&#x27;s unprecedented economic boom.

Qinhuangdao is on the Jingshen Expressway which links Beijing with Shenyang, Liaoning. The city is served by Qinhuangdao Beidaihe Airport.

==Tourism==
The Qinhuangdao Wildlife Park was opened in 1995 and is China&#x27;s second largest wildlife park.

==Red Ribbon==

Qinhuangdao is home to the Tanghe River Park, which features the Red Ribbon, a knee-high steel sculpture that runs the length of the park, providing seating, environmental interpretation, lighting, and the display of native plants. The project has won an honor award from the American Society of Landscape Architects and was selected by readers of &quot;Condé Nast Traveler&quot; magazine as one of the seven new wonders of the architecture world.

<text>Krispy Kreme, Inc. (previously Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Inc.) is an American multinational doughnut company and coffeehouse chain. Krispy Kreme was founded by Vernon Rudolph (1915–1973), who bought a yeast-raised recipe from a New Orleans chef, rented a building in 1937 in what is now historic Old Salem in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and began selling to local grocery stores. Steady growth preceded an ambitious expansion as a public company in the period 2000 to 2016, which ultimately proved unprofitable. In 2016, the company returned to private ownership under JAB Holding Company, a private Luxembourg-based firm. In July 2021, Krispy Kreme became publicly traded again on the Nasdaq. The brand name is a deliberate non-standard spelling of &quot;crispy cream&quot;, for marketing effect.

==History==

=== Early years ===
In 1933, eighteen-year-old Vernon Rudolph, along with his brother Lewis Rudolph, began working for his uncle, Ishmael Armstrong, who owned a small general store in Paducah, Kentucky, that sold a wide variety of goods, including its very popular doughnuts. While the exact origin of the doughnut recipe remains partially a mystery, it is believed that Ishmael Armstrong was inspired by an Ohio River barge cook named Joseph LeBeouf who was famous for his light and fluffy doughnuts, which contained potatoes.
The store struggled during the Great Depression. In 1934, Vernon and Ishmael decided to move to the larger city of Nashville, Tennessee, where they hoped business would be better. The uncle and nephew focused solely on selling their doughnuts and opened &quot;The Krispy Kreme Doughnut Company&quot; in a rented store on Gallatin Road. The shop did so well that Vernon&#x27;s father, Plumie, also left Kentucky and moved to Nashville to help sell doughnuts. In 1937, Rudolph opened his own store, deciding on Winston-Salem, North Carolina, for the location when he learned that his favorite cigarette company, Camel Cigarettes, was headquartered in the small North Carolina city. Rudolph primarily sold to convenience stores; however, he also sold hot doughnuts to individual customers who came during production time between midnight and 4 a.m. The first store in North Carolina was located in a rented building at 534 South Main Street in Winston-Salem in what is now called historic Old Salem. The Krispy Kreme logo was designed by Benny Dinkins, a local architect. The first Krispy Kreme bakery outside the South opened in Akron, Ohio, in 1939.

=== Growth ===
Expansion occurred in the 1950s, including an early store in Savannah, Georgia. By the 1960s, Krispy Kreme was known throughout the Southeast, and it began to expand into other areas. In 1976, Krispy Kreme Doughnut Corporation became a wholly owned subsidiary of Beatrice Foods of Chicago, Illinois. The headquarters for Krispy Kreme remained in Winston-Salem. A group of franchisees purchased the corporation back from Beatrice Foods in 1982.

Krispy Kreme began another phase of rapid expansion in the 1990s, opening stores outside the southeastern United States where most of their stores were located. In December 2001, Krispy Kreme opened its first store outside the US in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. The minimum investment amount to open a Krispy Kreme franchise ranges from approximately $450,000 to above $4M.

===IPO and accounting scandals===
On April 5, 2000, the corporation went public on the NASDAQ at $21 using the ticker symbol KREM. On May 17, 2001, Krispy Kreme switched to the New York Stock Exchange, with the ticker symbol KKD, which it carried until its private acquisition. The stock reached what would be its all-time high of $50 on the New York Stock Exchange in August 2003, a gain of 135 percent from its IPO price. For the fiscal year ending in February 2004, the company reported sales of $665.6 million and operating profits of $94.7 million from almost 400 stores (including international locations). The market initially considered the company as having &quot;solid fundamentals, adding stores at a rapid clip and showing steadily increasing sales and earnings.&quot;

In May 2004, the company missed quarterly estimates for the first time and suffered its first loss as a public company. Chairman and CEO Scott Livengood attributed the poor results to the low-carbohydrate diet craze. This explanation was viewed with skepticism by analysts, as &quot;blaming the Atkins diet for disappointing earnings carried a whiff of desperation&quot;, and as rival doughnut chain, Dunkin&#x27; Donuts, has not suffered from the low-carb trend over the same compared period.

By 2005, the company&#x27;s stock had lost 75-80 percent of its value, amid earnings declines, as well as an SEC investigation over the company&#x27;s alleged improper accounting practices. A turnaround plan in December 2005 aimed to close unprofitable stores in order to avoid bankruptcy.

Analysts suggested that Livengood had expanded the chain too rapidly after the IPO, which concentrated certain markets with too many stores. While this approach initially grew revenues and profits at the parent-company level, due to royalty payments from new franchisees, this reduced the profitability of individual franchisees in the long run as they were forced to compete with one another. For the 2003-04 fiscal year, while the parent enjoyed a 15 percent increase in second-quarter revenues, same-store sales increased only a tenth of a percent. Krispy Kreme also had supermarkets and gas stations carry their doughnuts, which soon contributed up to half of the chain&#x27;s sales, creating further market saturation as well as increasing competition to its franchisees. All this expansion devalued Krispy Kreme brand&#x27;s novelty, by making the once-specialty doughnuts ubiquitous, particularly as the newer sales outlets required pre-made doughnuts as opposed to the ones made fresh in factory stores, which alienated brand devotees.

Besides royalty payments from new stores, the parent company also enjoyed significant profits by requiring franchisees to purchase mix and doughnut-making equipment from the parent&#x27;s Krispy Kreme Manufacturing and Distribution (KKM&amp;D) division. KKM&amp;D earned $152.7 million in 2003, which made up 31 percent of sales, with a reported operating margin of 20 percent or higher, but these mark-ups were largely at the expense of its franchisees. By comparison, rival chain Dunkin&#x27; Donuts generally avoids selling equipment or materials to its franchisees which &quot;keeps company and franchisee interests aligned&quot;, as well as having a royalty stream based on same-store sales.

Krispy Kreme has been accused of channel stuffing by franchisees, whose stores reportedly &quot;received twice their regular shipments in the final weeks of a quarter so that headquarters could make its numbers&quot;. The company was also dogged by questionable transactions and self-dealing accusations over the buybacks of franchisees, including those operated by company insiders. A report released in August 2005 singled out then-CEO Livengood and then-COO John W. Tate to blame for the accounting scandals, although it did not find that the executives committed intentional fraud.

On March 4, 2009, the SEC issued a cease and desist order against Krispy Kreme for its actions inflating their revenues and engaging in illicit activities regarding the purchasing of its own stores to prop up revenues and setting up mechanisms to guarantee that it beat earnings estimates by $0.01, which eventually resulted in Krispy Kreme reducing net income over two years by over $10.5 million. In it, the SEC proposed remedial actions for Krispy Kreme to take.

===Return to private ownership===

In May 2016, JAB Holding Company, a German investment firm, announced that it made an offer to purchase the company for $1.35 billion over the following two months that would make the company privately owned. The transaction closed on July 27, 2016. In December 2017, Krispy Kreme moved its corporate headquarters to Charlotte, North Carolina; while Winston-Salem retained the majority of operational departments and the Krispy Kreme Support Center.

Also in 2010, Krispy Kreme Express, a delivery service for businesses, began testing at the Battleground Avenue location in Greensboro, North Carolina. In the early 2010s, the company began developing shops with tunnel ovens, which allow for an all-day &quot;Hot Now&quot; hot doughnut experience. On February 24, 2015, Krispy Kreme opened its 1,000th shop, in Kansas City, Kansas.

In 2018, Krispy Kreme acquired bakery chain Insomnia Cookies at a $175mm enterprise value, which continues to operate independently. On August 25, 2020, the first Krispy Kreme vending machine was launched in North Carolina, featuring 3-packs of doughnuts available 24 hours a day.

=== Going public again ===
In May 2021, Krispy Kreme confidentially filed for an initial public offering to once again go public. The company went public again on the Nasdaq on July 1, 2021, under the name Krispy Kreme Inc.

On March 26, 2024, Krispy Kreme and McDonald&#x27;s announced a partnership where Krispy Kreme doughnuts would be gradually rolled out to all McDonald&#x27;s locations nationwide by the end of 2026. This followed a successful test market experiment in Kentucky. Markets such as Pittsburgh and Columbus, Ohio were selling Krispy Kreme products at McDonald&#x27;s by the end of 2024.

In 2024, Krispy Kreme sold a majority stake of Insomnia Cookies, to Verlinvest and Mistral Equity Partners, at a $350mm enterprise value.

On December 12, 2013, Krispy Kreme opened its first store in Taipei, Taiwan.

On May 18, 2015, Krispy Kreme announced it has signed a development agreement with KK Doughnuts SA (Pty) Ltd., to open 31 Krispy Kreme shops in South Africa over the next five years.

On August 9, 2024, Krispy Kreme opened its first store in Morocco.

== Products ==

On February 19, 2007, Krispy Kreme began selling the Whole Wheat Glazed doughnut in an attempt to appeal to the health conscious. The doughnut has nearly the same number of calories as the original glazed doughnut (180 calories vs. 190 calories) but contains more fiber (2 grams vs. 0.5 grams). As of January 2008, the trans fat content of all Krispy Kreme doughnuts was reduced to 0.5 of a gram or less. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in its guidelines, allows companies to round up to 1 g in its nutrition facts label when the food contains as much as 0.5 of a gram per serving. Krispy Kreme benefited from this regulatory rule in its subsequent advertising campaign, touting its doughnuts as &quot;trans fat-free&quot; and having &quot;0 grams trans fat!&quot;.

On July 1, 2010, Krispy Kreme introduced a doughnut that included the soft drink Cheerwine, which was to be sold in grocery stores in North and South Carolina during July. The doughnuts proved so popular that the Salisbury, North Carolina, Krispy Kreme location (the town where Cheerwine is made) sold them as well. After July 31, this was the only place to get them. The Cheerwine Kreme doughnut returned for July 2011 and made its debut in Tennessee and Roanoke, Virginia.On May 25, 2017, Krispy Kreme doughnut-flavored Jelly Belly jelly beans were announced.

On August 5, 2019, Krispy Kreme released two new Reese&#x27;s-branded &quot;chocolate lovers&quot; and &quot;peanut butter lovers&quot; doughnuts to the public.

In July 2020, Krispy Kreme launched several candy-coated doughnuts with Nerds, Jelly Belly jelly beans, sour gummies, and marshmallows.

Krispy Kreme introduced a seasonal Pumpkin Spice Doughnut Collection in September 2020 with four flavors: 1) Pumpkin Spice Original Glazed Doughnut, 2) Pumpkin Spice Cake Doughnut, 3) Pumpkin Spice Original Filled Cheesecake Doughnut, and 4) Pumpkin Spice Cinnamon Roll Doughnut.

During Veganuary in January 2021, Krispy Kreme UK launched its Original Glazed vegan doughnut. In December 2021, Krispy Kreme UK launched three more vegan doughnut flavors, Fudge Brownie Bliss, Caramel Choc Delight, and Apple Custard Crumble.

In 2024, the Dolly Southern Sweets Doughnuts Collection included four new flavors available for a limited time in restaurants and some grocery stores—Dolly Dazzler, Peachy Keen Cobbler, Banana Puddin&#x27; Pie and Chocolate Creme Pie. Inspired by Dolly Parton, the flavors were the company&#x27;s first inspired by a celebrity.

Although based on informal advertising such as word-of-mouth, in 2006, Krispy Kreme moved into television and radio advertisements, beginning with its &quot;Share the Love&quot; campaign with heart-shaped doughnuts. Since 1955, the company has offered fundraising kits for organizations to sell boxes of doughnuts; Krispy Kreme would then split the proceeds with the organizations to raise funds for various causes.

In 2014, Krispy Kreme released a $1,685 doughnut as part of fundraising efforts for The Children&#x27;s Trust. It was covered with 24-karat gold and was decorated with edible diamonds. The inside was made from Dom Pérignon champagne jelly.

In March 2021, Krispy Kreme announced that they were providing a free Original Glazed doughnut every day (except Thanksgiving Day &amp; Christmas Day) for the rest of that year to customers in the US who could prove they have received a COVID-19 vaccine. Multiple physicians criticized this move, with former Baltimore health commissioner Leana Wen tweeting that a person who ate a doughnut every day without making other lifestyle changes could gain 15 pounds by the end of the year. Others criticized the physicians: Elyse Resch, a nutrition therapist, wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s an oppression. Weight stigma, fat-shaming, fatphobia – it&#x27;s oppressive, like every other oppression in the world. And it&#x27;s so wrong. We all deserve to have satisfaction in our eating, and having a doughnut is a delicious thing.&quot; In response to the criticisms, Krispy Kreme said, &quot;Like many sweet treats, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts are an occasional indulgence best enjoyed in moderation. And we know that&#x27;s how most of our guests enjoy our doughnuts. We&#x27;re certainly not asking people to get a free Original Glazed doughnut every day, we&#x27;re just making it available through the end of the year, especially given that not every group is eligible to get vaccinated yet.&quot;

== Controversies ==

=== Owner&#x27;s use of forced labour in Nazi Germany ===

Owning the controlling stake in Krispy Kreme Doughnuts as well as Insomnia Cookies and Pret A Manger (amongst other brands), one of the wealthiest families in Germany admitted in 2019 that they profited from forced labour during World War II. The New York Times reported that the two men who ran the family business in the 1930s and 1940s - Albert Reimann Sr. and his son Albert Reimann Jr. - actively participated in the abuse of their workers.

The German newspaper Bild originally published the story, based on an interim report by an economic historian at the University of Munich, Paul Erker - who was hired by the Reimann family to investigate their involvement with the Nazi Party. The family&#x27;s spokesman and a managing partner of JAB Holding Company, which the Reimanns control - Peter Harf - told Deutsche Welle, “Reimann Sr. and Reimann Jr. were guilty. The two businessmen have passed away, but they actually belonged in prison.”

Erker&#x27;s report concluded that Reimann Sr. and Reimann Jr. were virulent anti-Semites and keenly supported the Nazi Party, with Reimann Sr. donating to the SS in 1931, two years before Hitler was appointed chancellor of Germany. In addition to employing forced laborers in their private villa, their industrial chemicals factory in Germany employed forced laborers including Nazi-deportees from Russia and Eastern Europe, as well as prisoners of war from France. A third of their workforce, around 175 forced workers, produced items for the German army, states the AFP news agency. As reported by the New York Times, workers were beaten, and women were made to stand naked, and if they refused were sexually assaulted.

Director of the Leibniz Institute for Contemporary History, Andreas Wirsching, said that Reimann Sr. and Reimann Jr. were unusual in their direct participation in the abuse of workers. “It was very common for companies to use forced laborers—but it was not common for a company boss to be in direct and physical contact with these forced laborers,” Wirsching said.

As reported by Deutsche Welle, due to the successors&#x27; findings about their family&#x27;s Nazi past, the Reimanns pledged to donate $11 million to institutions helping victims and families of forced labourers. The report includes a statement from Harf to Bild saying “We were ashamed and white as sheets. There is nothing to gloss over. These crimes are disgusting.”

The Boston Globe published an article about it headlined, “I found out Nazi money is behind my favorite coffee. Should I keep drinking it?”

=== Ku Klux Klan ===
In February 2015, a Krispy Kreme branch in Kingston upon Hull, England, announced during the half-term break of schools that it was launching, among other events that week, &quot;Krispy Kreme Klub Wednesday&quot;, during which children could decorate doughnuts. However, it attracted controversy after it was promoted as &quot;KKK Wednesday&quot; on Facebook, due to it sharing an abbreviation with the Ku Klux Klan, an American white supremacist terrorist group. Krispy Kreme promptly apologized, canceled the event, pulled all marketing relating to it, and launched an internal investigation.

<text>Nonnus of Panopolis (, &quot;Nónnos ho Panopolítēs&quot;, 5th century AD) was the most notable Greek epic poet of the Imperial Roman era. He was a native of Panopolis (Akhmim) in the Egyptian Thebaid and probably lived in the 5th century AD. He is known as the composer of the &quot;Dionysiaca&quot;, an epic tale of the god Dionysus, and of the &quot;Metabole&quot;, a paraphrase of the &quot;Gospel of John&quot;. The epic &quot;Dionysiaca&quot; describes the life of Dionysus, his expedition to India, and his triumphant return. It was written in Homeric Greek and in dactylic hexameter, and it consists of 48 books at 20,426 lines.

==Life==
There is almost no evidence for the life of Nonnus. It is known that he was a native of Panopolis (Akhmim) in Upper Egypt from his naming in manuscripts and the reference in epigram 9.198 of the &quot;Palatine Anthology&quot;. Scholars have generally dated him from the end of the 4th to the central years of the 5th century AD. He must have lived after the composition of Claudian&#x27;s Greek &quot;Gigantomachy&quot; (i.e., after 394–397) as he appears to be familiar with that work. Agathias Scholasticus seems to have followed him, with a mid-6th-century reference to him as a &quot;recent author&quot;.

He is sometimes conflated with St Nonnus from the hagiographies of St Pelagia and with Nonnus, the bishop of Edessa who attended the Council of Chalcedon, both of whom seem to have been roughly contemporary, but these associations are probably mistaken.

==The &quot;Dionysiaca&quot;==

Nonnus&#x27;s principal work is the 48-book epic &quot;Dionysiaca&quot;, the longest surviving poem from classical antiquity. It has 20,426 lines composed in Homeric Greek and dactylic hexameters, the main subject of which is the life of Dionysus, his expedition to India, and his triumphant return. The poem is to be dated to the 5th century. It used to be considered of poor literary quality, but a mass of recent writing (most notably in the Budé edition and commentary on the poem in 18 volumes) has demonstrated that it shows consummate literary skill, even if its distinctly baroque extravagance is an acquired taste for a modern reader. His versification invites attention: writing in hexameters he uses a higher proportion of dactyls and less elision than earlier poets; this plus his subtle use of alliteration and assonance gives his verse a unique musicality.

==The &quot;Paraphrase of John&quot;==
His &quot;Paraphrase of John&quot; (&quot;Metabolḕ toû katà Iōánnēn Euaggelíou&quot;) also survives. Its timing is a debated point: textual analysis seems to suggest that it preceded the &quot;Dionysiaca&quot; while some scholars feel it unlikely that a converted Christian would have gone on to devote so much work to the &quot;Dionysiaca&quot;’s pagan themes. The terminus post quem for its composition is the commentary on the Gospel of John written by Cyril of Alexandria (i.e. 425–428), since the theological layer of Nonnus&#x27; &quot;Paraphrase&quot; is clearly dependent on it. A more difficult issue is to determine the terminus ante quem. Perhaps it is the time of the composition of Pseudo-Apollinaris&#x27; &quot;Metaphrase of the Psalms&quot; (c. 460), which seems to refer to Nonnus&#x27; poem.

<doc id="164260" wikidata="Q1258641" url="?curid=164260" title="Sinicization">
<text>Sinicization, sinofication, sinification, or sinonization (from the prefix , &#x27;Chinese, relating to China&#x27;) is the process by which non-Chinese societies or groups are acculturated or assimilated into Chinese culture, particularly the language, societal norms, cultural practices, and ethnic identity of the Han Chinese—the largest ethnic group of China.

Areas of influence include diet, writing, industry, education, language/lexicon, law, architectural style, politics, philosophy, religion, science and technology, value systems, and lifestyle.

The term &quot;sinicization&quot; is also often used to refer to processes or policies of acculturation or assimilation of norms from China on neighboring East Asian societies, or on minority ethnic groups within China. Evidence of this process is reflected in the histories of Korea, Japan, and Vietnam in the adoption of the Chinese writing system, which has long been a unifying feature in the Sinosphere as the vehicle for exporting Chinese culture to other Asian countries.

In recent times, the term &quot;Sinicization&quot; has sometimes been used more narrowly in reference to specific policies of the Government of China towards minorities, particularly toward religious minorities within China. Policies include the destruction of religious architecture and costumes, the attempt to blend religious traditions with traditions perceived as Chinese as well as the promotion of &quot;ethnic unity&quot;.

==Assimilation==
The assimilation policy is a type of Chinese nationalism aimed at strengthening the Chinese national identity (&quot;Zhonghua minzu&quot;) among the population. Proponents believe it will help to develop shared values, pride in being the country&#x27;s citizen, respect and acceptance towards cultural differences among citizens of China. Critics argue that assimilation destroys ethnic diversity, language diversity, and cultural diversity. The historian James A. Millward has claimed that the People&#x27;s Republic of China has used the concept of sinicization as a means to obscure Han settler colonialism.

In China there are 292 non-Mandarin languages spoken by native peoples of the region. There are also a number of immigrant languages, such as Khmer, Portuguese, and English.

==Sinicizations==
===Historical===
====Baiyue====
Before sinicization, non-Chinese indigenous peoples of southern China, collectively termed by the Chinese as &quot;Baiyue (&quot;&quot;),&quot; inhabited the coastline of China from as far north as the Yangtze River to as far south as the Gulf of Tonkin.

As early as the 11th century BC, some of the Baiyue peoples in the Yangtze River Delta started to sinicize, marked by their establishment of the Wu State. These Yue peoples, together with their southerner neighbours who formed the Yue State centuries later, are collectively termed as Yuyue peoples. Over time, the mutual contact between Baiyue peoples and Han Chinese, as well as southward spread of Han Chinese, mostly as war refugees, led to the sinicization of most of the Baiyue populations that remained in southern China, be they in the Yangtze Valley or in coastal areas from the mouth of the Yangtze to the Gulf of Tonkin. The remnants of these peoples who were not fully sinicized are now recognized officially as the ethnic minorities of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

====Mongolic and Turkic peoples====

Tuoba Wei of northern China was a sinicized empire of Mongolic-Xianbei origin. 

Historical Shatuo Turks founded three sinicized dynasties in northern China. Descendants of Buddhist Uyghurs (see also Yugurs, Kingdom of Qocho and Ganzhou Uyghur Kingdom) who migrated to Taoyuan County, Hunan, have assimilated into the Hui population and adopted Chinese culture practice Chinese customs, speaking varieties of Chinese as their language.

====Han, Jin, and Sixteen Kingdoms period====

From the late Han dynasty to the early Jin dynasty (266–420), large numbers of non-Chinese peoples living along China&#x27;s northern periphery settled in northern China. Some of these migrants such as the Xiongnu and Xianbei had been pastoralist nomads from the northern steppes. Others such as the Di and Qiang were farmers and herders from the mountains of western Sichuan of southwest China. As migrants, they lived among ethnic Chinese and were sinicized to varying degrees. Many worked as farm laborers. Some attained official positions in the court and military. The numerous tribal groups in the north and northwest who had been heavily drafted into the military then exploited the chaos to seize power by local Chinese warlords.

During the Three Kingdoms period, Cao Cao initiated the policy of settling Xiongnu nomads away from the frontier near Taiyuan in modern Shanxi province, where they would be less likely to rebel. The Xiongnu abandoned nomadism and the elite were educated in Chinese-Confucian literate culture. The migration of northern Chinese people to the south further settled China as a multi-ethnic empire.

====Northern and Southern dynasties====

The Northern and Southern dynasties was a period in the history of China that lasted from 386 to 589, following the tumultuous era of the Sixteen Kingdoms period. Though an age of civil war and political chaos, it was also a time of flourishing arts and culture, advancement in technology, and the spread of Mahayana Buddhism and Daoism. The period saw large-scale migration of Han Chinese to the lands south of the Yangtze. The period came to an end with the unification of all of China proper by Emperor Wen of the Sui dynasty. During this period, the process of sinicization accelerated among the non-Han arrivals in the north and among the indigenous people in the south. This process was also accompanied by the increasing popularity of Buddhism (introduced into China in the first century) and Daoism in both northern and southern China.

====Tang dynasty====
During the eighth and ninth centuries in the Tang dynasty, Chinese male soldiers moved into Guizhou (formerly romanized as Kweichow) and married native non-Chinese women, their descendants being known as &quot;Lao-han-jen&quot; (original Chinese), in contrast to new Chinese people who colonized Guizhou at later times. They still spoke an archaic dialect as of 1929. Many immigrants to Guizhou were descended from these soldiers in garrisons who married non-Chinese women.

====Yuan dynasty====
The Mongol-led Yuan dynasty appointed a Muslim from Bukhara, &quot;Sayyid&quot; Ajall Shams al-Din Omar, as governor of Yunnan after conquering the Bai-led Dali Kingdom. Sayyid Ajall is best known among Chinese for helping sinicize the Yunnan province; the promotion of Islam, Confucianism, and Buddhism would be part of his &#x27;civilizing mission&#x27; upon the non-Han Chinese peoples in Yunnan, who he viewed as &quot;backward and barbarian.&quot;

He founded a &quot;Chinese style&quot; city called Zhongjing Cheng, where modern Kunming is today, and ordered that a Buddhist temple, two mosques, and a Confucian temple be built in the city. The latter temple, built in 1274 and doubled as a school, was the first Confucian temple ever to be built in Yunnan. By incorporating Chinese and consequently Confucian thought in the dynasty, scholars now deem Kublai Khan as an adopted Chinese citizen of Mongol ethnicity, rather than simply being mutually excluded from the definition of fellow Chinese he governed. As such, Sayyid Ajall would be the one to introduce Confucian education, rituals, and traditions into Yunnan, including Chinese social structures, funeral rituals, and marriage customs. He would go on to construct numerous Confucian temples throughout his reign.

Confucian rituals were taught to students in newly founded schools by Sichuanese scholars. The natives of Yunnan were instructed by Sayyid Ajall in such Confucian ceremonies as weddings, matchmaking, funerals, ancestor worship, and kowtow. The native leaders had their &quot;barbarian&quot; clothing replaced by clothing given to them by Sayyid Ajall as well. The governor was praised and described as making &quot;the orangutans and butcherbirds become unicorns and phoenixes and their felts and furs were exchanged for gowns and caps&quot; by He Hongzuo, the Regional Superintendent of Confucian studies.

Sayyid Ajall would also be the first to bring Islam to the area, and thus the widespread presence of Islam in Yunnan is credited to his work. Both Marco Polo and Rashid al-Din Vatvat recorded that Yunnan was heavily populated by Muslims during the Yuan dynasty, with Rashid naming a city with all Muslim inhabitants as the &quot;great city of Yachi.&quot; It has been suggested that Yachi was Dali City (&quot;Ta-li&quot;), which had many Hui people.

Sayyid Ajall&#x27;s son Nasir al-Din became Governor of Yunnan in 1279 after his death.

Historian Jacqueline Armijo-Hussein has written on Sayyid Ajall&#x27;s confucianization and sinicization policies in various papers, including in her dissertation &quot;Sayyid &#x27;Ajall Shams al-Din: A Muslim from Central Asia, serving the Mongols in China, and bringing &#x27;civilization&#x27; to Yunnan&quot; (1997); and in &quot;The Origins of Confucian and Islamic Education in Southwest China: Yunnan in the Yuan Period&quot; (n.d.) and &quot;The Sinicization and Confucianization in Chinese and Western Historiography of a Muslim from Bukhara Serving Under the Mongols in China&quot; (1989).

====Ming dynasty====

During the Ming conquest of Yunnan Chinese military soldiers were settled in Yunnan, and many married the native women.

====Qing dynasty====
The rulers of the Qing dynasty were ethnic Manchus who adopted the norms of the Mandate of Heaven to justify their rule. The &quot;orthodox&quot; historical view emphasized the power of Han Chinese to &quot;sinicize&quot; their conquerors, although more recent research such as the New Qing History school revealed Manchu rulers were savvy in their manipulation of their subjects and from the 1630s through at least the 18th century, the emperors developed a sense of Manchu identity and used Central Asian models of rule as much as Confucian ones. There is also evidence of sinicization, however. For example, Manchus originally had their own separate style of naming from the Han Chinese, but eventually adopted Han Chinese naming practices.

Manchu names consisted of more than the two or one syllable Chinese names, and when phonetically transcribed into Chinese, they made no sense at all. The meaning of the names that Manchus used were also very different from the meanings of Chinese names. The Manchus also gave numbers as personal names.

Historical records report that as early as 1776, the Qianlong Emperor was shocked to see a high Manchu official, Guo&#x27;ermin, not understand what the emperor was telling him in Manchu, despite coming from the Manchu stronghold of Shengjing (now Shenyang). By the 19th century even the imperial court had lost fluency in the language. The Jiaqing Emperor (reigned 1796–1820) complained that his officials were not proficient at understanding or writing Manchu.

Eventually, the Qing royal family (the Aisin Gioro) gave their children Chinese names, which were separate from the Manchu names, and even adopted the Chinese practice of generation names, although its usage was inconsistent and error-ridden. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Manchu royal family stopped using Manchu names.

The Niohuru family of the Manchu changed their family name to Lang, which sounded like &quot;wolf&quot; in Chinese, since wolf in Manchu was Niohuru; thus forming a translation.

Although the Manchus replaced their Manchu names with Chinese personal names, the Manchu bannermen followed their traditional practice in typically used their first/personal name to address themselves and not their last name, while Han Chinese bannermen used their last name and first in normal Chinese style.

Usage of surnames was not traditional to the Manchu while it was to the Han Chinese.

The Vietnamese Nguyễn emperor Minh Mạng sinicized ethnic minorities such as Khmers, Chams and Montagnards, claimed the legacy of Confucianism and China&#x27;s Han dynasty for Vietnam. Directing his policies at the Khmers and hill tribes, Minh Mang declared that &quot;We must hope that their barbarian habits will be subconsciously dissipated, and that they will daily become more infected by Han [Sino-Vietnamese] customs.&quot; Moreover, he would use the term &quot;Han&quot; () to refer to the Vietnamese people, and the name (中國, the same Chinese characters as for &#x27;China&#x27;) to refer to Vietnam. Likewise, the lord Nguyễn Phúc Chu had referred to Vietnamese as &quot;Han&quot; people in 1712 when differentiating between Vietnamese and Chams.

Chinese clothing was also adopted by the Vietnamese people. Variations of them are still being used today.

=== Republic of China ===

==== Ma Clique ====
Hui Muslim General Ma Fuxiang created an assimilationist group and encouraged the integration of Muslims into Chinese society. Ma Fuxiang was a hardcore assimilationist and said that Hui should assimilate into Han.

===Contemporary===
====Hong Kong and Macau====
====Xinjiang====
The Hui Muslim 36th Division (National Revolutionary Army) governed the southern region of Xinjiang in 1934–1937. The administration that was set up was colonial in nature, importing Han cooks and baths, changing the Uyghur-language-only street names and signs to Chinese, as well as switching carpet patterns in state-owned carpet factories from Uyghur to Han.

Strict surveillance and mass detentions of Uyghurs in the Xinjiang internment camps is a part of the ongoing sinicization policy by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Since 2015, it has been estimated that over a million Uyghurs have been detained in these camps. The camps were established under CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping&#x27;s administration with the main goal of ensuring adherence to national ideology. Critics of China&#x27;s treatment of Uyghurs have accused the Chinese government of propagating a policy of sinicization in Xinjiang in the 21st century, calling this policy a cultural genocide, or ethnocide, of Uyghurs.

====Taiwan====
After the Republic of China took control of Taiwan from the Empire of Japan in 1945 and relocated its capital to Taipei in 1949, the intention of Chiang Kai-shek was to eventually go back to mainland China and retake control of it. Chiang believed that to retake mainland China, it would be necessary to re-Sinicize Taiwan&#x27;s inhabitants who had undergone assimilation under Japanese rule. Examples of this policy included the renaming of Japanese-named streets with mainland geographical names, the use of Mandarin Chinese in schools and punishments for using other regional Chinese languages, or &quot;dialects&quot; (such as Hakka and Hokkien), and teaching students to revere traditional ethics, develop pan-Chinese nationalism, and view Taiwan from the perspective of China. Other reasons for the policy were to combat the Japanese influences on the culture that had occurred in the previous 50 years, and to help unite the recent immigrants from mainland China that had come to Taiwan with the KMT and among whom there was a tendency to be more loyal to one&#x27;s city, county or province than to China as a nation.

The process of re-asserting non-Chinese identity, as in the case of ethnic groups in Taiwan, is sometimes known as desinicization. This is an issue in, for example, the Taiwan independence movement and Taiwan localization movements.

====Tibet====

The sinicization of Tibet is the change of Tibetan society to Han Chinese standards by means of state propaganda, police presence, cultural assimilation, religious persecution, immigration, population transfer, land development, land transfer, and political reform. According to the U.S. branch of the Offices of Tibet, it has been underway since the Chinese regained control of Tibet in 1951. Sources quoted by Radio Free Asia have stated that in present-day Tibet, traditional Tibetan festivals have &quot;been turned into a platform for propaganda and political theater&quot; where &quot;government workers and retirees are barred from engaging in religious activities, and government workers and students in Tibetan schools are forbidden from visiting local monasteries.&quot;

===Religion===

In April 2016, CCP general secretary Xi Jinping declared that to &quot;actively guide the adaptation of religions to socialist society, an important task is supporting China&#x27;s religions&#x27; persistence in the direction of sinicization.&quot; He later reiterated this plan to the 19th Communist Party Congress saying &quot;We will fully implement the Party&#x27;s basic policy on religious affairs, insist on the sinicization of Chinese religions, and provide active guidance for religion and socialism to coexist.&quot;

====Protestantism====
The Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM) of Protestant churches in China has described the Boxer Rebellion and the anti-Christian movement of 1922–1927 as early efforts to sinicize Christianity.

The TSPM and China Christian Council arranged a conference in Shanghai on August 4–6, 2014, commemorating the anniversary of the TSPM. This conference included a seminar on the sinicizaton of Christianity, with Fu Xianwei, chairman of the TSPM, saying &quot;churches in China will continue to explore the sinicization of Christianity [and] ensure Christianity takes root in the soil of Chinese culture, ethnicity, and society... To advance the sinicization of Christianity, churches will need guidance and support from government agencies in charge of religious affairs.&quot;

In 2019, TSPM chairman Xu Xiaohong made a pledge to eliminate any Western &quot;imprint&quot; from Chinese faith saying &quot;[We] must recognise that Chinese churches are surnamed &#x27;China&#x27;, not &#x27;the West&#x27;&quot; and &quot;No matter how much effort or time it takes, our resolution in upholding the Sinicisation of Protestantism will never change, and our determination to walk a path that is adapted to a socialist society will never waver.&quot;

In December 2023, Wang Huning stated that Christian groups must &quot;adhere to the direction of the sinicisation of Christianity.&quot;

====Catholicism====

In December 2016, the Ninth National Congress of the Chinese Catholic Representatives reaffirmed their plan for the United Front Work Department&#x27;s Catholic Patriotic Association to uphold the principle of independence and self-governance, along with the promotion of sinicization.

In March 2018, Archbishop Paul Gallagher, Secretary for Relations with States within the Holy See&#x27;s Secretariat of State, said that &quot;two expressions or, more precisely, two principles stand out, which should interact with each other, namely &quot;sinicization&quot; and &quot;inculturation.&quot; I am convinced that an important intellectual and pastoral challenge arises in an almost natural way from the bringing together of these two terms, which indicate two real visions of the world.&quot;

In June 2018, the Bishops&#x27; Conference of the Catholic Church in China and the Catholic Patriotic Association issued a &quot;Five-Year Plan on Carrying Forward the Catholic Church&#x27;s Adherence to the Direction of Sinicization in Our Country&quot;. This document calls for Catholics to accept Communist party leadership, love the motherland and obey the state, as well as to embrace the state&#x27;s directive to implement Chinese cultural integration within Catholicism. Churches in Hebei province and the Yibin Diocese of Sichuan province began holding training seminars immediately.

Cardinal Parolin, the Vatican secretary of state, in a 2019 interview with the CCP-owned &quot;Global Times&quot; newspaper, claimed that sinicization was a form of &#x27;inculturation&#x27;, which is a Catholic missionary term that refers to adopting local culture to proclaim the gospel. He cited Matteo Ricci as an example and pointed out that the Chinese leadership had promised not to undermine the doctrine and nature of each religion. He stated in the interview: &quot;These two terms, &quot;inculturation&quot; and &quot;sinicization,&quot; refer to each other without confusion and without opposition: in some ways, they can be complementary and can open avenues for dialogue on the religious and cultural level.&quot;

====Islam====
In 2015, CCP general secretary Xi Jinping first raised the issue of &quot;sinicization of Islam&quot;. In 2018, a confidential directive was issued ordering local officials to &quot;prevent Islam from interfering with secular life and the state&#x27;s functions&quot;.

Yang Faming, leader of the Islamic Association of China, said in a 2018 speech that &quot;We must allow traditional Chinese culture to permeate Islam and jointly guard the spiritual homeland of the Chinese people.&quot; He encouraged Chinese characteristics to be present in religious ceremony, culture, and architecture.

In 2018, over one million Chinese government workers began forcibly living in the homes of Uyghur Muslim families to monitor and assess resistance to assimilation, and to watch for frowned-upon religious or cultural practices. These government workers were trained to call themselves &quot;relatives&quot; and have been described in Chinese state media as being a key part of enhancing &quot;ethnic unity&quot;.

, it was estimated that Chinese authorities may have detained one and a half million people in secretive internment camps. The vast majority of those forcibly interned are Muslim Uyghurs but Kazakhs and other minority groups have also been included.

In September 2020, sinicization policies targeted Muslim Utsuls in the Hainan province. Restrictions included limiting the size of mosques, requiring a Communist Party member on mosque management committees, forbidding the use of Arabic words on food stalls (such as &quot;halal&quot;), and banning the hijab in schools and government offices.

In June 2023, CNN reported that Chinese authorities had forcibly rebuilt a number of mosques to eliminate traditional Islamic architecture (e.g. minarets, domes) and replace them with Chinese architecture. In July 2023, the United Front Work Department&#x27;s Central Institute of Socialism developed a plan to &quot;meld Islam with Confucianism&quot; using the Han Kitab texts as a guide.

<doc id="164264" wikidata="Q3275016" url="?curid=164264" title="Three Links">
<text>The Three Links or Three Linkages () was a 1979 proposal from the National People&#x27;s Congress of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) to open up postal, transportation (especially airline), and trade links between mainland China and Taiwan, with the goal of unifying Mainland China and Taiwan.

Before the establishment of the &quot;Three Links&quot;, communication between the two sides were routed through intermediate destinations, primarily Hong Kong; Macau; Jeju, South Korea and Ishigaki, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. The &quot;Three Links&quot; were officially established on 15 December 2008, with the commencement of direct flights, shipping and post.

==History==
===Proposal===
In December 1978, Deng Xiaoping and his supporters won the 3rd plenary session of the 11th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, starting China&#x27;s economic reform. This also began a new direction in the PRC&#x27;s foreign policy. On January 1, 1979, Beijing proposed the Three Links of postal, commercial and transportation. It was also proposed together with the Four flows/Four exchanges which included relatives, tourists, academic groups, cultural groups and sports representatives. This was greeted in Taiwan by Republic of China (ROC) President Chiang Ching-kuo&#x27;s Three Noes.

===Lead-up to liberalization===

While the PRC and ROC agreed in principle on opening the Three Links, there were overriding concerns. According to the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) of the ROC, the major obstacle resided in the PRC&#x27;s One-China position which does not recognize the sovereignty of the ROC. The Council stated that the Three links would only be considered when the PRC stopped its animosity against ROC sovereignty and improved the cross-strait relationship. The PRC government considers the cross-strait flights as domestic flights, according to the One China Policy. However, the ROC&#x27;s Democratic Progressive Party government in Taiwan regarded this position the same as recognizing Taiwan (ROC) as a part of the PRC and thus would compromise the ROC sovereignty.

The previous administration led by President Chen Shui-bian, who was in power from 2000 to 2008, was keen to establish direct links under his &quot;four noes and one without&quot; pledge. China reacted with caution however, and was eventually infuriated when Chen spoke of &quot;Taiwan and China on each side of the Taiwan Strait, each side is a country&quot;, and the Taiwanese administration believed establishment of the links would not be possible. However, China eventually shifted its position when it realized that the three links may be an opportunity to hold on to Taiwan, with its Minister of Transport and former Minister of Foreign Affairs Qian Qichen declaring that the &quot;one China&quot; principle would no longer be necessary during talks to establish the links, which would be labelled merely as &quot;special cross-strait flights&quot; and not &quot;international&quot; nor &quot;domestic&quot; flights.

In 2004, Beijing proposed a cross-strait controlled-access highway project linking Beijing to Taipei connecting the two sides of the Taiwan Straits together. However, due to the potential technical difficulties, some people in Taipei consider this move as political propaganda.

The Three Links are mentioned in the Anti-Secession Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

===Limited liberalization===


Under the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government, gradual steps were taken to lift restrictions on the three links. The so-called Little Three Links, also referred to as Mini Three Links or Three Small Links (小三通; xiǎo sān tōng) allows for limited postal, transportation, and trade links between the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s Fujian province cities of Xiamen, Mawei and Quanzhou, and the islands of Kinmen and Matsu, which are administered by the Republic of China. When introduced in January 2001, they allowed only those with household registrations in Kinmen and Matsu to use the trade links, as well as China-based Taiwan businessmen. Travels must be done in groups. Restrictions were lifted to allow individual travelers, as well as to open the routes to former residents and relatives of Kinmen and Matsu. Quanzhou was also added to the list in the same year.

The ferry trip, which takes at least 30 minutes, involved regular routes connecting Kinmen 
to the ports of Xiamen and Quanzhou, and Matsu to Mawei. Occasional trips were also made between Kinmen and Meizhou, a popular religious site. The routes saw 21,377 entries and exits in 2001. It ballooned to 341,152 in 2006, but still represents a small part of overall trade.

In early 2002 a China Airlines flight to Hong Kong crashed into the Taiwan strait killing all 225 people on board. The majority of the passengers were intending to transfer at Hong Kong for flights to mainland China. Relatives of the victims advocated for direct cross-strait flights.

In early 2003, the Republic of China (ROC) government permitted its air carriers to ferry Chinese New Year passengers back and forth across the Strait by way of &quot;indirect charter flights&quot; that touched down briefly in Hong Kong or Macau. The ROC and People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) did not repeat the charter flights during the 2004 Chinese New Year, in part because the two sides could not agree on the terms for meetings to discuss how PRC carriers might also participate.

The two sides agreed to permit cross-strait flights for the Chinese New Year of Rooster in 2005. Unlike the 2003 flights, the 2005 flights did not have to touch down in Hong Kong or Macau, but still must enter its airspace. The first direct commercial flights from China (from Guangzhou) to Taiwan since 1949 arrived in Taipei on January 29, 2005. Shortly afterwards, a China Airlines carrier landed in Beijing. Airports on both sides saw ceremonial displays on the arrival of the first passengers, with dancing lions and dragons, and officials making speeches. For the three-week holiday period, 48 flights were scheduled.

On 19 July 2006, the first direct chartered all-cargo flight since 1949 operated by China Airlines landed in Shanghai from Taipei. Four other flights were operated on 25 July, 30 July, 8 August, and 10 August 2006.

===Further liberalization===
In the lead-up to the 2008 presidential elections in Taiwan, the Kuomintang candidate, Ma Ying-jeou, pledged opening the Three Links at an accelerated rate should he be elected president. The ruling DPP has traditionally been reluctant to implement this, citing the PRC&#x27;s refusal to negotiate unless the Taiwanese counterparty accepts the one-China principle under the 1992 consensus. In June 2007, DPP presidential candidate Frank Hsieh criticised Ma&#x27;s plans as a reflection of his lack of experience in handling cross-strait affairs. He also stressed that while the direct links may benefit Taiwan economically, Taiwan&#x27;s values must not be compromised as a result.

On 29 February 2008, Ma announced plans to commence weekend charter flights by 1 July 2008, which will be expanded to daily charters by the end of the year. Regular scheduled flights may commence by June 2009. The airports of Taoyuan, Taipei, Taichung, Kaohsiung, Hualien, Taitung, and Penghu will be open for these cross-strait flights, while the seaports of Keelung, Taipei, Taichung, Kaohsiung, Hualien, Chiayi, and Tainan will be open to direct shipping routes. All restrictions limiting the scope of the &quot;mini three links&quot; will be lifted, including allowing all Taiwanese to use them. Hsieh responded by promising to expand cross-strait charter flights within three months after taking office, including increased flight frequencies and the addition of destinations on the Chinese which may be flown to. Both liberalization plans were greeted by enthusiasm amongst Taiwanese airlines.

Formal agreements to launch regular weekend charter flights were signed on 13 June 2008, allowing for an initial 36 return flights per weekend from Friday to Monday, divided equally to allow 18 return flights amongst up to six China-based and six Taiwan-based airlines respectively. The agreement will involve five airports from China, including those in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xiamen and Nanjing, and eight airports in Taiwan, namely Taipei Taoyuan International Airport, Kaohsiung International Airport, Taichung Airport, Taipei Songshan Airport, Makung Airport, Hualien Airport, Kinmen Airport and Taitung Airport. Flights to China cities of Chengdu, Chongqing, Hangzhou, Dalian, Guilin and Shenzhen may be added later. The first flights are scheduled to commence on 4 July 2008, and flight frequencies may be increased on demand, with expectations to increase to 72 each weekend after the 2008 Olympic Games. For the first time, the flights will be open to anyone holding valid travel documents, and will no longer be restricted to Chinese and Taiwanese residents only, and no longer required to fly through the Hong Kong FIR. There are also frequency caps on certain sectors: flights from Shanghai to Taiwan are capped at nine return trips each week, while those from China to Taichung must not exceed six return flights each week. There will be no restrictions out of Nanjing.

On 17 June 2008, the Civil Aviation Administration of China announced that the 18 return flights available to Chinese airlines will be apportioned such that Air China and Hainan Airlines will fly to Taiwan from Beijing with four return flights and two return flights respectively; China Eastern Airlines and Shanghai Airlines will fly from Shanghai to Taiwan with four return flights and two return flights respectively; China Southern Airlines fly depart for Taiwan from Guangzhou for four return flights per week, and Xiamen Airlines will connect Xiamen with Taiwan with two weekly return flights.

Allocation amongst Taiwanese carriers was adjusted from six airlines to five after the suspension of Far Eastern Air Transport. A rotating allocation system was adopted, whereby in the first week, Mandarin Airlines, TransAsia Airways and UNI Air would fly four return flights each and China Airlines and EVA Airways will fly three flights each, and in the second week, four flights will be operated by TransAsia Airways, UNI Air and China Airlines, while EVA Airways and Mandarin Airlines will fly three flights. The rights will be rotated through in subsequent weeks such that each airline will fly in aggregate the same number of flights every five weeks. On the Taiwan-Shanghai route, three airlines will be allocated two roundtrip flights each week, and another airline one weekly flight, to be cycled through the five airlines. China Airlines and its subsidiary Mandarin Airlines would fly seven round-trips a week, with four to Shanghai, two to Beijing and one to Guangzhou from Kaohsiung, Makung, Taichung and Taipei. Eva Air and subsidiary UNI Air would fly from Taiwan Taoyuan, Songshan and Kaohsiung to Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou, while TransAsia Airways will operate from Songshan to Shanghai, Guangzhou and Xiamen. China Airlines and its Mandarin Airlines subsidiary would offer 29 return flights in the month of July to Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and Xiamen, while Eva Air would offer 7 flights per week initially from Taiwan Taoyuan and Songshan airports.

Announced routes so far are as follows:

Negotiators are expected to meet again in Taiwan to tackle outstanding issues, including revisiting the issue of introducing cross-strait charter cargo flights within three months, the introduction of direct flight routes without the need to fly via Hong Kong airspace and subsequent addition of destinations and frequencies.

On 19 June 2008, the &quot;Little Three Links&quot; between the islands of Kinmen and Matsu and Fujian was greatly liberalised, allowing any Taiwanese to use the ferry services by travelling to either island on their onward journey into Fujian province and beyond. In response, several Taiwanese airlines increased flights to Kinmen, including Mandarin Airlines (increased Taipei-Kinmen flights), Trans Asia Airways (an additional weekly Taipei-Kinmen flight) and UNI Airways Corporation (increase Taipei-Kinmen flights by one or two each week, for a total of 24 weekly flights). Still, the sudden surge in travellers caused flights to become overbooked in the immediately aftermath of liberalization. There were calls for further relaxation on travel restrictions of Chinese travelling into the islands so as to enable them to also travel onwards to the main island. Work was also needed to correct the current trade and movement imbalance, where 300,000 Taiwanese travel via the route to reach China, compared to 37,000 Chinese who travel in the opposite direction. On the other hand, the volume of Chinese goods using the route was significantly higher compared to Taiwanese goods. The MAC Minister Lai Shin-yuan remarked that the Straits Exchange Foundation will negotiate with Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits to allow the Chinese to travel to Taiwan via the route, and to lift a US$100,000 trade value ceiling imposed by the Chinese on Taiwanese goods using the route.

===Full restoration===
Full restoration of the Three Links officially commenced on 15 December 2008, with inaugural direct shipping, direct flights, and direct mail.

On August 31, 2009, the number of flights between China and Taiwan increased to 270. They no longer had to bypass Hong Kong airspace and also were no longer all operating as chartered flights; i.e., a large number of regular scheduled flights began across the Taiwan Strait out of 25 Chinese airports.

==Controversies==
During the period of the direct charter flights, the PRC state media stressed that they were domestic flights, whereas the ROC government stressed that they were international flights.

In reaction to 13 June 2008 agreements, the DPP criticized the government of &quot;yielding to China&quot;, and accused Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung of &quot;defying the legislature&quot;, saying the &quot;Act Governing Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area stipulates that legislative resolutions are required before any direct cross-strait links are opened&quot;, which was not carried out. Chiang dismissed the accusations, saying he followed the precedent set by former SEF chairman Koo Chen-fu, and would &quot;report to the legislature&#x27;s Home and Nations Committee instead of the legislative caucuses&quot;.

The DPP and the Pan-Green Coalition has routinely claimed there was a potential compromise on Taiwan&#x27;s national security should there be liberal three links, suggesting the PRC could disguise troop carriers as commercial aircraft to invade Taiwan, a charge met by criticism from both the PRC and the Pan-Blue Coalition. In the wake of 13 June 2008 agreements, the DPP raised the issue of national security again, criticising its plans to open up to eight airports when China would open only five. The eight airports included Hualien and Taitung, which also operate as military airfields, thus creating a security threat. They also expressed concern over the possibility of absconding Chinese tourists. A defense ministry report on 18 May 2008 concluded that direct charter flights would be a national security threat, and the air force has reportedly expressed concern that six of the airports except the Taiwan Taoyuan and Kaohsiung airports have military installations and aircraft. The Vice Minister of National Defense Lin Chen-yi has further recommended to maintain indirect flight routes via a third party&#x27;s air space on 23 May 2008. But on 18 June 2008, the Minister of National Defense Chen Chao-min declared that direct flights without the involvement of any third party air space would not pose a threat to national security, saying &quot;The final routes for direct charter flights shall be decided by the Mainland Affairs Council and the Ministry of Transportation and Communications. We will submit recommendations to the MOTC that take national security into consideration, but I do not foresee any problems if the flights travel directly between Taiwan and China&quot;.

The DPP gave itself credit for having &quot;laid the groundwork&quot; for opening weekend charter flights and allowing Chinese tourists into Taiwan, both of which did not occur under KMT rule, and criticised the current negotiators as being &quot;inexperienced and ill-prepared&quot;.

==Impact==
Visitor data from Taiwan&#x27;s Mainland Affairs Council indicates that the China-Taiwan aviation market is about 8 million passengers annually just prior to the June 2008 agreements, and may be expected to immediately increased to 10 million as a result of liberalization. IATA&#x27;s figures puts the market figure at about 6 million passengers annually based on number of air tickets issued, with the Shanghai-Taipei pair accounting for 40% of the entire market. The ten biggest markets are as follows:

===Transit points===
The enforcement of the ban on direct trade links has benefited third party transit points, in particular Hong Kong, since 1988. Current China-Taiwan traffic channels about 60% of its traffic via Hong Kong, 30% via Macau, and the rest via other points such as Jeju. In 1997, the Taipei-Hong Kong air route alone constituted one-sixth of the passengers handled at the Hong Kong Airport with five million passengers, and by 2001, this figure has jumped to 6.7 million. In the fiscal year 2006–07, the Taipei-Hong Kong air route accounted for 18% of Hong Kong&#x27;s 45 million passengers, making it one of the busiest international air routes by passenger numbers in the world.

1.6 million air travelers flew into China from Hong Kong in 1996, and in 2000, 18% of Hong Kong&#x27;s 2.4 million tourists came from Taiwan, out of which 36% of them traveled on to China with or without staying in Hong Kong. In the five-year period from 2003 to 2007 there were an average of 3.68 million passengers annually who travel through Hong Kong between the two locations. Today, about 60% of Taiwan-Hong Kong traffic connects onwards to flights into the Chinese, and for the Macau-Taiwan sector, about 80%.

Currently, over 3,000 flights offering nearly one million seats are operated every month by five airlines, namely China Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Dragonair, EVA Air and Thai Airways International, between Hong Kong and Taipei. In addition, flights are operated between Hong Kong and Kaohsiung by China Airlines, Dragonair and Mandarin Airlines, and between Hong Kong and Taichung by Dragonair, Hong Kong Express Airways, Mandarin Airlines and Uni Air. Summary of flights through Hong Kong and Macau are as follows:

Conversely, liberation of the three links may have adverse economic consequences on Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Airport Authority&#x27;s chairman Victor Fung Kwok-king estimated up to 6% reduction in air travel through Hong Kong as a result of direct China-Taiwan flights. The city&#x27;s tourism operators estimated losses of over HK$3 billion annually should the three links be liberated in 2008. A possible 6.6% reduction in tourism in Hong Kong may be limited in economic impact as transit passengers typically spend far less during transit, but it may have significant impact on Hong Kong-based airlines, in particular Cathay Pacific and its affiliate Dragonair. It was reported on 18 May 2008 that Taiwan&#x27;s China Airlines intents to trim its Taiwan-Hong Kong flights by two to three flights per day once direct flights resume in July 2008, but the airline denied this, saying &quot;when cross-strait relations improve and market trends are clearer, then we&#x27;ll make a specific plan&quot;. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao believes Hong Kong will not be affected as the increased economic exchange may benefit the city too. In the immediate aftermath of the announcements for 4 July direct flights, shares of Cathay Pacific fell by 1.8% over fears of its negative impact on the airline, which derives significant profits from the route. Shares of Xiamen Gaoqi International Airport and Shanghai Airlines gained 1.18% and 1.27% respectively over expectations of possible gains from the deal.

===Air services===

Gradual liberalization has paved the way for direct cooperation between airlines from both sides. China Southern Airlines and China Airlines announced their intention to seal a strategic cooperation contract on 23 June 2008 for cooperation on the weekend chartered flights, soon after the announcement of their liberalization. Officials from each of the three largest Chinese airlines also flew to Taiwan with attempts to negotiate with Taiwanese airlines on cooperation deals, with likely cooperation between all parties in areas including marketing, ground services, maintenance and airline catering.

The impending competition also prompted the main Chinese airlines to embark on a publicity blitz, highlighting their intentions to provide their best aircraft, crew and service to passengers, including customized in-flight meals to suit tastes from both sides.

Announced ticket prices for the first flights were shown to be almost similar to those requiring a stopover, negating expectations of the direct flights depressing ticket prices except on the Xiamen-Taipei route. This was due to high fuel costs, but prices were not expected to rise further.

===Ship routes===
In December 2015, the Huangqi-Matsu ship route was introduced as part of the Mini Three Links.

<doc id="164266" wikidata="Q249870" url="?curid=164266" title="Kinmen">
<text>Kinmen, alternatively known as Quemoy, is a group of islands governed as a county by the Republic of China (Taiwan), only east from the city of Xiamen in Fujian, located at the southeastern coast of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, from which they are separated by Xiamen Bay. Kinmen is also located west from the closest shoreline of the island of Taiwan across the Taiwan Strait.

The county consists of the major island of Kinmen along with several surrounding islets, as well as Wuqiu Township remotely located northeast from the rest of the county. Kinmen is one of two counties that constitute Fuchien Province; the other is Lienchiang County (Matsu).

Kinmen&#x27;s strategic location in the Taiwan Strait has caused numerous confrontations, making it a visible embodiment of political change on cross-strait relations. In August 1958, Kinmen was heavily bombarded by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army during the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis. Travel restrictions between Kinmen and the main island of Taiwan were lifted in 1994 following the end of decades-long military administration over Kinmen. A direct ferry route to Xiamen was inaugurated in January 2001 following the establishment of the Three Links.

The People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC, China) claims Kinmen as part of its own Fujian Province and considers Wuqiu to be a separate territory of Fujian apart from Kinmen itself; conversely, the ROC claims the Dadeng Islands (Tateng) as part of Kinmen, even though the PRC has effectively transferred the jurisdiction of those islands to Xiamen.

==Names==
Kinmen (金門) means &#x27;golden gate&#x27;. The name was first recorded in 1387 when the Hongwu Emperor appointed Zhou Dexing to administer the island and protect it from pirate attacks. The spelling &quot;Kinmen&quot; is a postal romanization. This transcription system is a variation of Nanking Syllabary, a system developed by Herbert Giles in 1892. It was adopted by the Chinese Imperial Post, part of the Chinese Maritime Customs Service led by Irishman Robert Hart. It is based on pronunciation in the Southern Mandarin, or Jianghuai, dialect. This dialect is widely spoken in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, including the city of Nanjing. The Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs uses &quot;Kinmen,&quot; while the United States Board on Geographic Names gives &quot;Kinmen Island.&quot; Jinmen is the island&#x27;s name both in Tongyong Pinyin and in Hanyu Pinyin. Chin-men / Chinmen is the Wade–Giles romanization of the county and island&#x27;s name.

Quemoy, pronounced , is a name for the island in English and in other European languages. It may have originated as a Spanish or Portuguese transcription of the Zhangzhou Hokkien pronunciation of the name, &quot;Kim-mûi&quot;. This is the most common form of the islands&#x27; name in English. For example, works that deal with the First and Second Taiwan Strait Crises (the Quemoy Incident) and the 1960 United States presidential election debates when the islands received prominent worldwide news coverage all use the word Quemoy. In addition, the former National Kinmen Institute of Technology was renamed National Quemoy University in 2010. Kinmen scholar Wei Jian-feng advocates the use of the word Quemoy to better connect the island to &quot;international society or achieve more recognition in the world&quot;. Kimoi is a Hokkien-derived spelling also used in the postal romanization system.

==History==


Humans have lived on Kinmen for 5,800 to 8,000 years. During the reign of Emperor Yuan (317 CE), the Five Barbarians invasion of China led six extended families to flee south and they settled in Kinmen, then called Wuzhou. More people settled there during the Tang dynasty, changing the name from&quot; Wuzhou&quot; to &quot;Kinmen&quot;.

During the Ming dynasty, more migrants settled in Kinmen. Koxinga used Kinmen as a base to capture Formosa and Penghu from the Dutch. He cut down trees to build his navy, resulting in massive deforestation that made Kinmen vulnerable to soil erosion.

The Prince of Lu, a member of the Southern Ming dynasty, resisted the invading Manchu Qing dynasty forces. In 1651, he fled to Kinmen, which the Qing dynasty took in 1663. During the Qing Dynasty, the Kinmen area was part of Tungan County.

After the establishment of the Republic of China (ROC) in 1912, Kinmen became part of Fujian Province. In 1913, the Kinmen area was made part of Siming County. Kinmen County was established in 1914. In 1928, the county came under direct administration of the provincial government.

The Empire of Japan captured Kinmen in 1937 during the Second Sino-Japanese War. They blockaded the island on September 3 and landed on October 23. Fighting was light with ROC forces fleeing rather than fighting. The only casualty was sustained by a local self-defense unit. Many of the residents fled to the mainland or to Southeast Asia. The purpose of the Japanese seizure of Kinmen was to use it as a position from which to attack the neighboring city of Xiamen which they would seize in May 1938. Following the seizure of Xiamen many of the locals who had fled there returned to Kinmen.

After the capture of the island the county government went into exile in Dadeng. The Japanese administered Kinmen as a special municipality of Xiamen, the government was composed of locals, people from other parts of occupied China, and Taiwanese.

A poor harvest in 1938 brought challenges for islanders. The Japanese engaged in economic development of the island including through the use of forced labor. KMT forces engaged in two serious attempts to retake the island and kept up a low level campaign against the Japanese. In 1943, insurgents kidnapped two Taiwanese officials who had been overseeing the salt fields and took them to China before executing them. In retaliation the Japanese authorities rounded up 300 young men from the local community eventually executing four.

Towards the end of WWII conditions worsened with Japanese authorities conscripting 500 locals (with their mules) into the military and confiscating household goods. The island came under allied bombing including one attack on 30 August 1944 which killed 19 locals.

WWII ended on 15 August 1945 with the surrender of Japan. Following the end of the war there were attacks by locals against Taiwanese who took shelter with the Japanese garrison. Kinmen was effectively ungoverned until 3 October 1945 when ROC forces landed and installed a new government. A celebration on Oct. 10 marked the end of hostilities. Locals who had survived the war following their conscription by the Japanese were treated as traitors by the KMT occupation authorities.

After the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) by the Chinese Communists in October 1949, Kinmen County was claimed by both the Nationalists and the Communists. Dadeng, Xiaodeng and Jiaoyu were taken by the Communists on 9 October or 15 October, 1949. While those islands are still claimed by the ROC, they are governed as part of Dadeng Subdistrict, Xiang&#x27;an District, Xiamen, Fujian, China.

On 25 October 1949, People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) forces landed on Kinmen Island near Guningtou beginning the Battle of Kuningtou. ROC forces successfully defended the island and prevented an attack on Taiwan.

At the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, retired Admiral Charles M. Cooke Jr., advisor to President Chiang Kai-shek, opposed withdrawing ROC forces from Quemoy (Kinmen). On 26 July 1950, ROC forces on Dadan Island (Tatan), in total 298 soldiers, repulsed an attack (大擔島戰役) from a People&#x27;s Liberation Army force of 700 soldiers that landed on the island. General Douglas MacArthur and other US officials supported ROC efforts to defend the islands.

The PLA extensively shelled the island during the First and Second Taiwan Strait crises in 1954–1955 and 1958 respectively. In 1954, the United States considered responding by using nuclear weapons against the PRC. Again in 1958, General Nathan Farragut Twining and the Joint Chiefs of Staff believed that the United States should not permit the loss of the islands to the communists and recommended to President Eisenhower the use of whatever force was necessary, including atomic weapons.

The phrase &quot;Quemoy and Matsu&quot; became part of American political language in the 1960 U.S. presidential election. During the debates, both candidates, Vice President Richard Nixon and Senator John F. Kennedy, pledged to use American forces if necessary to protect Taiwan from invasion by the PRC, which the United States did not recognize as a legitimate government. But in the second debate on 7 October 1960, the two candidates presented different opinions about whether to use American forces to protect Taiwan&#x27;s forward positions, Quemoy and Matsu, also. Senator Kennedy stated that these islands – as little as 9 kilometres (5.5 mi) off the coast of China and as much as 170 kilometres (106 mi) from Taiwan – were strategically indefensible and were not essential to the defense of Taiwan. Vice President Nixon maintained that since Quemoy and Matsu were in the &quot;area of freedom,&quot; they should not be surrendered to the Communists as a matter of principle.

Earlier in the debate, then-Vice President Nixon mentioned:

Later in the debate, Edward P. Morgan asked then-Senator Kennedy:

Then-Senator Kennedy responded to Morgan&#x27;s question saying:

Then–Vice President Nixon retorted:

After the third debate on 13 October 1960, Kennedy&#x27;s advisers spoke with then Secretary of State Herter and said Kennedy was willing to revise his position on the Quemoy and Matsu issue so as not to give the Communists the impression that the USA would not stand united against aggression. Nixon pointed out the change in Kennedy&#x27;s position but decided not to press the point due to the importance of the USA&#x27;s role in what was an extremely tense situation. Nixon&#x27;s polls among Republicans and Democrats showed overwhelming support for Nixon&#x27;s position on the issue.

Kinmen was originally a military reserve under the Martial Law curfews, which eventually led to the tragedies of innocent civilian casualties, such as the 1985 Shi Islet Slaughter and 1987 Lieyu massacre. The island was returned to the civilian government in the mid-1990s, after which travel to and from it was allowed. Direct travel between mainland China and Kinmen re-opened in January 2001 under the mini Three Links, and there has been extensive tourism development on the island in anticipation of mainland tourists. Direct travel was suspended in 2003 as a result of the SARS outbreak, but has since resumed.

Many Taiwanese businessmen use the link through Kinmen to enter the Chinese mainland, seeing it as cheaper and easier than entering through Hong Kong. However, this changed following the 2005 Pan–Blue visits to mainland China and the 2008 presidential and legislative victories of the KMT, that allowed easier cross-Strait relations. Kinmen has experienced a considerable economic boom as businessmen relocate to the island for easier access to the vast markets of the PRC.

On 30 June 2014, Dadan Island and Erdan Island were handed over from the military to civilians, represented by Kinmen County Government. Since 1 January 2015, tourists from Mainland China could directly apply for the Exit and Entry Permit upon arrival in Kinmen. This privilege also applies to Penghu and Matsu Islands as means to boost tourism in the outlying islands of Taiwan.

On 23 August 2019, the sixty-first anniversary of the beginning of the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis, President Tsai Ing-wen visited the Taiwushan martyrs&#x27; shrine () in Mount Taiwu where she placed flowers and offered incense.

== Climate ==
Kinmen&#x27;s climate is classified as humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;, bordering on &quot;Cwa&quot;). Among them, the annual average temperature is , the hottest month in August is , and the coldest month is in January. The annual precipitation is , of which August is the wettest with , while November is the driest with only . The extreme temperature throughout the year ranged from on January 25, 2016 to on August 31, 2020.

== Geology ==
Kinmen, much like the surrounding Chinese mainland, is predominantly composed of Cretaceous aged granite, with lesser amounts of Eocene-Oligocene sandstone, Miocene basalt and Pleistocene-Holocene conglomerate. The thickness of the sediments varies from 150 metres in the west to only a few metres in the east.

==Demographics==

==Culture==

The people of Kinmen see themselves as Kinmenese, &quot;Mínnánrén&quot;/&quot;Mǐnnánrén&quot; (people of Southern Fujian), or Chinese. They identify as citizens of the Republic of China but not so much as Taiwanese. Kinmen&#x27;s strong Chinese identity was forged during the period of the ROC&#x27;s military confrontation with the People&#x27;s Republic of China (1949–1992) when Kinmen was under military administration. In the 1980s, as the militarization decreased and martial law was ended on Taiwan, the Taiwan independence movement and efforts in de-Sinicization grew in strength on Taiwan. To Kinmenese, however, these developments were viewed with concern and there was a feeling that &quot;Taiwan didn&#x27;t identify with Kinmen&quot;. Many worried that Taiwanese &quot;de jure&quot; independence from China would lead to the severing of ties with Kinmen. These concerns play a strong role in Kinmenese politics as well. Legally speaking, Kinmenese people are not Taiwanese either and have a unique identity from that of the Taiwanese. &quot;Taiwanization&quot; is sometimes perceived as a threat to the cultural identity of the Kinmenese people.

===Language===
Many of the county&#x27;s inhabitants speak Hokkien; the Quanzhou accent is predominant. Most residents will say they speak Kinmenese, which is mutually intelligible with Taiwanese Hokkien. The residents of Wuchiu Township speak Pu-Xian Min, as opposed to Hokkien for the rest of Kinmen.

===Others===
Kinmen is notable for a number of cultural products. Due to the extensive shelling by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army in the 1950s, Kinmen is famous for its artillery shell knives. Local artisans would collect the vast amounts of exploded ordnance and make high-quality knives which are still sought after by chefs and connoisseurs. Kinmen is also home of the regionally famous Kinmen Kaoliang liquor, a spirit ranging between 38 and 63 percent alcohol, which is highly appreciated by the Taiwanese. Other local culinary specialties include , &quot;&quot; and beef jerky (bakkwa).

Like the Ryukyus, Kinmen is known for shisa (wind-lion god) figures (風獅爺).

==Military==
Kinmen is home to the ROC Army’s 101st Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion also known as the ROC Army Frogman, whose main headquarter is garrisoned on Liaoluo Bay (料羅灣). As of 2024, United States soldiers are stationed in the islands.

== Economy ==
Kinmen&#x27;s economy is mainly based on tourism and services due to its proximity to mainland China.

===Tourism===
Because of its military importance, development on the island was extremely limited. Only by 2003, Kinmen opened up itself to tourists from Fujian in Mainland China. It is now a popular weekend tourist destination for Taiwanese and is known for its quiet villages, old-style architecture and beaches. Chinese and Taiwanese tour groups also spend a short time touring the island whilst transiting between the ferry and the airport, as an intermediate stop between China and Taiwan. Large parts of Kinmen form the Kinmen National Park which highlights military fortifications and structures, historical dwellings and natural scenery.

The year 2014 recorded the highest number of passengers traveling by ferry between Kinmen and Fujian ports for as many as 1.5 million people. Since 1 January 2015, Chinese mainland tourists were no longer required to apply for Exit and Entry Permit in advance for visits to Kinmen, Penghu and Matsu Islands. Instead, they can apply for it upon arrival at a cost of NT$600.

By 2016, two infrastructure projects are expected to boost tourism and meetings, incentives, conferencing, exhibitions visitors to the islands. One includes a yet-to-be-named five-star resort spearheaded by Xiamen property developer, Wu Youhua, president of Xiamen Huatian Group, the first time a Chinese interest has been allowed to invest in the Taiwanese hotel sector.

According to local authorities in Kinmen, they had recorded over 745,000 tourists from mainland China in 2018, who had collectively spent over 360 million dollars during that year.

====Tourist attractions====

Tourist-related affairs in Kinmen are governed by Transportation and Tourism Bureau of Kinmen County Government. Major tourist attractions in Kinmen are:

===Industry===
Kinmen is famous for the production of Kaoliang liquor, which takes up about 75% of Taiwan&#x27;s market share, in which it is a strong economic backbone of the county. Traditional industries are also being kept and improved, ranging from agriculture, fishery and livestock. It has a good fishery industry also due to its nature being surrounded by unpolluted sea.

Kinmen also produces its unique Kinmen knife, in which the raw material used to produce it is taken from the remnants of shells fired by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army in 1958–1978. The knife was made as gift to the visiting Head of Taiwan Affairs Office Zhang Zhijun to Kinmen on 23–24 May 2015 to symbolize mutual peace between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and to bury the hatchet left from Chinese Civil War.

===Imported goods===
Kinmen often import more goods from Mainland China than Taiwan Island because of lower costs due to the proximity of the county to the mainland. During the campaign for the 2014 county magistrate, all of the magistrate candidates spent their money on campaign materials produced in mainland provinces, such as Guangdong, Zhejiang and Fujian instead of from Taiwan Island.

==Politics==

The island consistently votes for the Kuomintang (KMT). Until the early 1990s, proponents of Taiwan independence argued that they would consider handing Kinmen over to the PRC in any negotiated settlement. Residents of the island have broadly opposed such measures.

The Democratic Progressive Party has a minor presence on the island and typically does not present candidates to stand in local elections, although it does hold a single seat in Kinmen County Council from both of the 2009 and 2014 local elections. However, the party occasionally lends support to liberal or center-left candidates.

On 29 November 2014, independent candidate Chen Fu-hai won the county magistrate election and took office as the Magistrate of Kinmen County on 25 December 2014, the first independent candidate to win the office. He replaced Magistrate Lee Wo-shih of the Kuomintang. The 2014 Kinmen County magistrate election consisted of 10 candidates, the highest number of nominated candidates in the electoral history of Taiwan.

Kinmen County Constituency is represented by a single seat in the Legislative Yuan. It is currently represented by Chen Yu-chen () of the Kuomintang. The current majority seats of Kinmen County Council is from independent, but headed by speaker Hung Yun-tien () of the Kuomintang. The incumbent Magistrate of Kinmen County is independent Chen Fu-hai.

=== Townships ===

Kinmen County is divided into three urban townships and three rural townships. Jincheng Township is the county seat which houses Kinmen County Government and Kinmen County Council. The township also houses the headquarter office of Kinmen-Matsu Joint Services Center. Kinmen County has the fewest rural townships among other counties in Taiwan.

All those townships on Greater Kinmen Island start their names with &quot;Jin&quot; (i.e., &quot;Kin&quot;, lit. &quot;gold&quot;). Lieyu Township encompasses the entire Lesser Kinmen Island, and is the closest to Xiamen. Wuqiu Township comprises Greater Qiu Islet () and Lesser Qiu Islet ().

Jincheng and Jinsha are the largest of the six townships. Altogether, there are 37 villages in Kinmen County.

===Cross-Strait relations===
In the controversy regarding the political status of Taiwan, the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) has continuously claimed the territory of Kinmen County as part of its own Fujian Province, claiming the Kinmen Islands as a county of Quanzhou prefecture-level city. The PRC claims the Wuqiu (Ockseu) Islands as part of Xiuyu District in Putian prefecture-level city. Taiwan (Republic of China) claims the Dadeng (Tateng) Islands in Dadeng Subdistrict, Xiang&#x27;an District, Xiamen, Fujian as part of Kinmen County.

==Education==

In August 2010, National Quemoy University was established from the predecessor National Kinmen Institute of Technology and Kinmen Division of National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences established in 1997. It is located in Jinning Township. The islands also have a satellite campuses of Ming Chuan University and National University of Kaohsiung. Secondary educational institutions include National Kinmen Senior High School and National Kinmen Agricultural and Industrial Vocational Senior High School. In total, there are 24 junior high schools, elementary schools and kindergartens.

The Kinmen County Government have invested millions in education in Kinmen, with an average of NT$20,000 per student. Schools in the county also accept the growing number of Taiwanese students whose parents are doing business in Fujian, China. The county government has been striving to encourage universities in Taiwan and China to set up branches in the county, as well as to attract Chinese students to study in Kinmen.

==Infrastructure==
===Electricity===
The Kinmen Power Company was founded in 1967 and gradually built five power plants in the county and is in charge of providing power resources to all residents in Kinmen. It used to rely on light diesel oil which created high cost burden to its management. Since 1992, the ROC central government approved the power company to authorize Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) for five-year management. All of the power development projects were invested by Taipower and helped the region economic development. In July 1997, Kinmen Power Company was officially incorporated to Taipower. In 1999, the diesel-fired Tashan Power Plant was built to supply electricity to Kinmen grid. The other smaller power plants were subsequently discontinued to reduce cost. The county is also powered by its Jinmen Wind wind farm with a capacity of 4 MW and photovoltaic system with a capacity of 9 MW.

===Submarine telecommunication cable===
In August 2012, Kinmen and Xiamen established the first submarine telecommunication cable between the two sides. On Taiwan side, the infrastructure was constructed by Chunghwa Telecom, while on mainland China&#x27;s side was done by China Telecom, China Unicom and China Mobile. The project began in 1996 and took 16 years to build.

The telecommunication system consists of two cables, one is an long cable that runs from Kinmen&#x27;s Lake Tzu and Xiamen&#x27;s Mount Guanyin, and the other is a long cable that runs from Guningtou on Greater Kinmen Island (ROC) to Dadeng Island (PRC). The system is a non-repeater system with a bilateral transmission capacity of 90 Gbit/s, which might be expanded in the future if demand arises.

===Water supply===

The current daily water demand for Kinmen is 50,000 tonnes, which are used for households, industries and agriculture sectors. One tonne of water produced for Kinmen costs about NT$50–60 and may surge to NT$70 during summer. In extreme drought condition, water shipment from Taiwan Island may cost as much as NT$200 per tonne. Because Kinmen residents pay only NT$10 for each tonne water they use, the cost of water supply has become a heavy burden for the county government.

For decades, Kinmen has been facing difficulties in water supply to its residents due to its shallow lakes, lack of rainfall and geographical constraints which makes building reservoirs and dams unfeasible. Therefore, Kinmen often overuses its groundwater, causing rising tidal flood and soil salinity.
In early September 2013, the People&#x27;s Republic of China government agreed to supply Kinmen with water from Jinjiang City in Fujian due to the ongoing water shortage problem in Kinmen. Kinmen draws more than 8,000 tonnes of groundwater every day and water from its reservoir is barely enough to support the residents during the dry season. It was judged that a shortage would affect the local economy badly if no mitigation plan was enacted by 2016. The water supply agreement was officially signed on 20 July 2015 in Kinmen between Kinmen County Waterworks Director Weng Wen-kuei () and Fujian Water Supply Co chairman Zhu Jinliang () witnessed by Kinmen County Magistrate Chen Fu-hai and Fujian Province Governor Su Shulin.

The Jinjiang–Kinmen Pipeline was officially opened on 5 August 2018 when it first started supplying water, and was celebrated by separate ceremonies held in both Kinmen County and Jinjiang City in mainland China.

==Transport==

===Air===
Kinmen is served by Kinmen Airport, a domestic airport located at Jinhu Township, connecting Kinmen with Penghu Airport, Penghu and Taipei Songshan, Kaohsiung, Taichung, Chiayi and Tainan Airport on Taiwan Island.

===Sea===
People coming from China can also travel to Kinmen via ferry from Xiamen&#x27;s Wutong Ferry Terminal or Quanzhou, arriving at Shuitou Pier in Jincheng Township. The Kinmen-Quanzhou Ferry is only available to local travelers. Foreigner passport holders are not permitted to use this service.

A new commercial port has been built on newly reclaimed land adjacent to the Shuitou Pier. The new port will handle the majority of sea freight to and from Kinmen. Previously, most of this traffic was handled by a smaller port in Jinhu Township, on the southeast corner of the island. In the past, due to constant artillery shelling from China, an underground port at the Zhaishan Tunnel was used to supply the island in times of conflict. It has since been decommissioned and converted into a tourist attraction.

===Road===
A bridge, the Kinmen Bridge, connecting Kinmen Island (Greater Kinmen) and Lieyu was completed in October 2022, estimated to cost NT$7.5 billion (US$250 million). It is expected to increase local tourism.

In October 2019, China announced a plan to build a bridge linking Xiamen to Kinmen. Taiwan&#x27;s Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said that the plans were made unilaterally by China as part of its schemes to absorb Taiwan and divide Taiwanese society, and that they see no need for bridges linking either Matsu or Kinmen to China.

<text>Franz Ludwig Carl Friedrich Passow (20 September 1786 – 11 March 1833) was a German classical scholar and lexicographer.

==Biography==
He was born at Ludwigslust in the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. In 1807 he was appointed to the professorship of Greek literature at the Weimar gymnasium by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, whose acquaintance he had made during a holiday tour; his lessons were attended by the young Arthur Schopenhauer. In 1815 he became professor of ancient literature at the University of Breslau, where he continued to live until his death. His endorsement of gymnastic exercises, in which he himself took part, caused a quarrel known as the &quot;Breslauer Turnfehde&quot; (“Breslau gymnastics feud”).

==Works==

Passow&#x27;s great work was his &quot;Handwörterbuch der griechischen Sprache&quot; (1819–1824) (&quot;Dictionary of the Greek Language&quot;), originally a revision of Johann Gottlob Schneider&#x27;s lexicon, which appeared in the fourth edition (1831) as an independent work, without Schneider&#x27;s name. Other works by Passow are &quot;Grundzüge der griech. und röm. Literatur und Kunstgeschichte&quot; (“Foundations of Greek and Roman Literature and History of Art”; 2nd ed., 1829) and editions of Persius, Longus, Tacitus&#x27;s &quot;Germania&quot;, Dionysius Periegetes, and Musaeus. His miscellaneous writings were collected in &quot;Opuscula academica&quot; (“Minor academic works”; 1835) and &quot;Vermischte Schriften&quot; (“Miscellaneous writings”; 1843).

Passow&#x27;s Greek lexicon was the basis for the &quot;Greek-English Lexicon&quot; of Liddell and Scott.

<doc id="164269" wikidata="Q315572" url="?curid=164269" title="Nobusuke Kishi">
<text>was a Japanese bureaucrat and politician who served as prime minister of Japan from 1957 to 1960. He is remembered for his exploitative economic management of the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo in China in the 1930s, imprisonment as a suspected war criminal following World War II, and provocation of the massive Anpo protests as prime minister, retrospectively receiving the nickname &quot;Monster of the Shōwa era&quot; (昭和の妖怪; &quot;Shōwa no yōkai&quot;). Kishi was the founder of the Satō–Kishi–Abe dynasty in Japanese politics, with his younger brother Eisaku Satō and his grandson Shinzo Abe both later serving as prime ministers of Japan.

Born in Yamaguchi Prefecture, Kishi graduated from Tokyo Imperial University in 1920. He rose through the ranks at the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and during the 1930s led the industrial development of Manchukuo, where he exploited Chinese slave labor. Kishi served in the wartime cabinet of Hideki Tōjō as minister of commerce and industry from 1941 to 1943 and vice minister of munitions from 1943 to 1944. At the end of the war in 1945, Kishi was imprisoned as a suspected Class A war criminal, but U.S. occupation authorities did not charge, try, or convict him, and released him in 1948 during the Reverse Course. At the end of the occupation in 1952, Kishi was de-purged, enabling his election to the National Diet in 1953. With overt and covert U.S. support, he consolidated Japanese conservatives against perceived threats from the Japan Socialist Party, and in 1955 was instrumental in forming the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Kishi was thus key in establishing the &quot;1955 System&quot; under which the LDP remains Japan&#x27;s dominant party.

Kishi served as the first secretary-general of the LDP and as foreign minister under Prime Minister Tanzan Ishibashi before succeeding Ishibashi in 1957. During his tenure, Kishi had the strong backing of business, and promoted domestic industry and commercial interests in Southeast Asia. In 1958, he introduced a bill which would have granted police vastly expanded powers, but withdrew it under heavy opposition. Kishi&#x27;s mishandling of the 1960 revision of the U.S.–Japan Security Treaty led to the Anpo protests, the largest protests in Japan&#x27;s modern history, and he resigned in disgrace. He remained a member of the House of Representatives until 1979 as a staunch anti-communist and conservative with links to right-wing groups.

== Early life and career ==
Kishi was born Nobusuke Satō in Tabuse, Yamaguchi Prefecture, the son of a sake brewer from a once illustrious samurai family that had recently fallen on hard times. His older brother, Ichirō Satō, would go on to become a Vice Admiral in the Imperial Japanese Navy, and his younger brother, Eisaku Satō, would also go on to become a prime minister. Nobusuke attended an elementary school and middle school in Okayama, and then transferred to another middle school in Yamaguchi. When he was about to graduate from middle school, Nobusuke was adopted by his father&#x27;s older brother, Nobumasa Kishi, adopting their family name. The Kishi family lacked a male heir, so they adopted Nobusuke in order to continue the family line.

Kishi passed the difficult entrance examination to enter First Higher School in Tokyo, the most prestigious preparatory school in the country, and then attended the Faculty of Law of Tokyo Imperial University. While at the university, Kishi became a protégé of the right-wing ultranationalist legal scholar Shinkichi Uesugi. Because he studied German law under Uesugi, Kishi&#x27;s views tended toward German-style statism, compared to the more progressive approaches favored by some of his classmates who studied English law. Kishi graduated in 1920 at the top of his class. Uesugi sought recruit him for an academic career, promising to make Kishi his successor as a professor in the future, but Kishi declined. Instead he entered the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce. This was an unusual choice, because at the time, the most brilliant aspiring bureaucrats typically sought to enter the Home Ministry and eventually gain appointment as a prefectural governor. Several of Kishi&#x27;s mentors even criticized his choice. However, Kishi was uninterested in administrative work, and aimed to be directly involved in Japan&#x27;s economic development.

In 1925, the Ministry was split into the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, with Kishi becoming part of the latter. In 1926–27, Kishi traveled around the world to study industry and industrial policy in various industrialised states around the world, such as the United States, Germany, and the Soviet Union. Besides the Soviet Five-Year Plan, which left Kishi with an obsession with economic planning, Kishi was also greatly impressed with the labor management theories of Frederick Winslow Taylor in the United States, the German policy of industrial cartels, and the high status of German technological engineers within the German business world. Kishi became known as one of the more prominent members of a group of &quot;reform bureaucrats&quot; within the Japanese government who favored a statist model of economic development with the state guiding and directing the economy.

Kishi was a trusted subordinate of Shinji Yoshino, his senior in the ministry. Following Yoshino&#x27;s appointment as vice minister in December 1931, Kishi steadily rose to prominence. He was named chief of the industrial policy section in January 1932, chief of the documents section in December 1933, and ultimately chief of the Industrial Affairs Bureau in April 1935. In March 1936, Gōtarō Ogawa became the Minister of Commerce and Industry. Ogawa was opposed to the faction within the Ministry represented by Yoshino and Kishi. Seeking to remove them from their positions, he pressured Kishi to accept a post in Manchukuo, where the Kwangtung Army were requesting his services, while Yoshino was offered the presidency of a public corporation in Tohoku. Both Kishi and Yoshino left the Ministry in September 1936.

==Economic manager of Manchukuo==

In the &quot;Manchurian Incident&quot; of September 1931, the Japanese Kwantung Army seized the Chinese region of Manchuria ruled by the warlord Zhang Xueliang (the &quot;Young Marshal&quot;) and turned it into a puppet state called &quot;Manchukuo&quot;. Although nominally ruled by Puyi, who had been the last emperor of the Qing dynasty, Manchukuo was in practice a Japanese puppet state and colony. All of the ministers in the Manchukuo government were Chinese or Manchus, but all of the vice ministers were Japanese, and these were the men who really ruled Manchukuo. From the start, the Japanese Army sought to turn Manchukuo into an industrial powerhouse in support of the Japanese Empire and carried out a policy of forced industrialization. Reflecting the military&#x27;s ideas about the &quot;national defense state&quot;, Manchukuo&#x27;s industrial development was focused completely upon heavy industry such as steel production for the purposes of arms manufacture.

Kishi has been described as the &quot;mastermind&quot; behind the industrial development of Japan&#x27;s puppet state in Manchuria. Kishi had first come to the attention of the Kwantung Army officers as a rising star in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry who openly touted the policies of Nazi Germany and called for policies of &quot;industrial rationalization&quot; to eliminate capitalist competition in support of state goalsideas that accorded with the Army&#x27;s idea of a &quot;national defense state&quot;. In 1935, Kishi was appointed Manchukuo&#x27;s Vice Minister of Industrial Development. Kishi was given complete control of Manchukuo&#x27;s economy by the military, with the authority to do whatever he liked just as long as industrial growth was increased.

In 1936, Kishi was one of the drafters of Manchukuo&#x27;s first Five-Year Plan. Clearly modeled on the Soviet Union&#x27;s First Five-Year Plan, Manchukuo&#x27;s Five-Year Plan was intended to dramatically boost heavy industry in order to vastly increase production of coal, steel, electricity, and weapons for military purposes. In order to enact the new plan, Kishi persuaded the military to allow private capital into Manchukuo, successfully arguing that the military&#x27;s policy of having state-owned corporations leading Manchukuo&#x27;s industrial development was costing the Japanese state too much money. One of the new public-private corporations founded to assist in carrying out the Five-Year Plan was the Manchurian Industrial Development Company (MIDC), established in 1937, which attracted a staggering 5.2 billion yen in private investment, making it by far the largest capital project in the Japanese empire; by comparison, the total annual budget of Japan&#x27;s national government was 2.5 billion yen in 1937 and 3.2 billion yen in 1938. Kishi was instrumental in recruiting Nissan Group founder Yoshisuke Ayukawa as president of the MIDC. As part of the deal, the Nissan Group&#x27;s entire operations were supposed to be transferred over to Manchuria to form the basis of the new MIDC. The system that Kishi pioneered in Manchuria of a state-guided economy where corporations made their investments on government orders later served as the model for Japan&#x27;s post-1945 development, and subsequently, that of South Korea and China as well.

In order to make it profitable for the &quot;zaibatsu&quot; to invest in Manchukuo, Kishi had a policy of lowering the wages of the workers to the lowest possible point, even below the &quot;line of necessary social reproduction&quot;. The purpose of Manchukuo was to provide the industrial basis for the &quot;national defense state&quot;, with American historian Mark Driscoll noting that, &quot;Kishi&#x27;s planned economy was geared towards production goals and profit taking, not competition with other Japanese firms; profit would come primarily from rationalizing labor costs as much as possible. The &quot;ne plus ultra&quot; of wage rationalization would be withholding pay altogetherthat is, unremunerated forced labor.&quot; Accordingly, the Japanese conscripted hundreds of thousands of Chinese as slave labor to work in Manchukuo&#x27;s heavy industrial plants. In 1937, Kishi signed a decree calling for the use of slave labor to be conscripted both in Manchukuo and in northern China, stating that in these &quot;times of emergency&quot; (i.e. war with China), industry needed to grow at all costs while guaranteeing healthy profits for state and private investors. From 1938 to 1944, an average of 1.5 million Chinese were taken every year to work as slaves in Manchukuo. The harsh conditions of Manchukuo were well illustrated by the Fushun coal mine, which at any given moment had about 40,000 men working as miners, of whom about 25,000 had to be replaced every year as their predecessors had died due to poor working conditions and low living standards.

Kishi showed little interest in upholding the rule of law in Manchukuo. Kishi expressed views typical of his fellow colonial bureaucrats when he disparagingly referred the Chinese people as &quot;lawless bandits&quot; who were &quot;incapable of governing themselves&quot;. According to Kishi&#x27;s subordinates, he saw little point in following legal or juridical procedures because he felt the Chinese were more akin to dogs than human beings and would only understand brute force. According to Driscoll, Kishi always used the term &quot;Manshū&quot; to refer to Manchukuo, instead of &quot;Manshūkoku&quot;, which reflected his viewpoint that Manchukuo was not actually a state, but rather just a region rich in resources to be used for Japan&#x27;s benefit.

As a self-described &quot;playboy of the Eastern world&quot;, Kishi was known during his four years in Manchukuo for his lavish spending amid much drinking, gambling, and womanizing. Kishi spent almost all of his time in Manchukuo&#x27;s capital, Xinjing (modern Changchun, China) with the exception of monthly trips on the world famous Asia Express railroad line to Dalian, where he indulged in his passion for women in alcohol- and sex-drenched weekends. When he was locked up in Sugamo prison in 1946 awaiting trial, he reminisced about his Manchukuo years: &quot;I came so much, it was hard to clean it all up”. According to Driscoll, &quot;photographs and written descriptions of Kishi during this period never fail to depict a giddy exuberance: laughing and joking while doling out money during the day and looking forward to drinking and fornicating at night.&quot; Kishi was able to afford his hedonistic, free-spending lifestyle as he had control over millions of yen with virtually no oversight, thanks to being deeply involved in and profiting from the opium trade. Before returning to Japan in October 1939, Kishi is reported to have advised his colleagues in the Manchukuo government about corruption: &quot;Political funds should be accepted only after they have passed through a &#x27;filter&#x27; and been &#x27;cleansed&#x27;. If a problem arises, the &#x27;filter&#x27; itself will then become the center of the affair, while the politician, who has consumed the &#x27;clean water&#x27;, will not be implicated. Political funds become the basis of corruption scandals only when they have not been sufficiently &#x27;filtered.&#x27;&quot;

==Minister in the Konoe and Tōjō governments==

In 1939, Kishi became Vice Minister of Commerce and Industy in the government of Prince Fumimaro Konoe. Kishi intended to create within Japan the same sort of totalitarian &quot;national defense state&quot; that he had pioneered in Manchuria, but these plans ran into vigorous opposition from the &quot;zaibatsu&quot;, who accused him of being a communist, and Kishi was fired from his post in December 1940. However, Kishi entered the cabinet as Minister of Commerce and Industry under new prime minister Hideki Tōjō less than one year later, in October 1941. Kishi and General Tōjō had worked closely together in Manchuria, and Tōjō regarded Kishi as his protégé.

On 1 December 1941, Kishi voted in the Cabinet for war with the United States and Britain, and co-signed the declaration of war issued on 7 December 1941. Kishi was also elected to the Lower House of the Diet of Japan in April 1942 as a member of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association. Kishi&#x27;s many connections with the business world and his organizational skills proved an asset to keeping Japan&#x27;s war effort going despite growing obstacles. In 1943, the Ministry of Commerce was abolished and replaced with the newly created Ministry of Munitions. Kishi was forced to accept a demotion, becoming Vice Minister of Munitions as Tōjō concentrated power in his own hands by simultaneously serving as prime minister, Minister of War, and Minister of Munitions, although Kishi retained his status as a member of the cabinet. This demotion was the beginning of a rift in the relationship between the two men.

Meanwhile, Kishi increasingly became convinced that the war was unwinnable under Tōjō. In July 1944, during the political crisis caused by the Japanese defeat at the Battle of Saipan, Tōjō attempted to save his government from collapse by reorganizing his cabinet. However, Kishi refused a request to resign, telling Tōjō he would only resign if the prime minister also resigned along with the entire cabinet, saying a partial reorganization was unacceptable. Despite Tōjō&#x27;s tears as he begged Kishi to help him save his government, Kishi was unmoved. Kishi&#x27;s actions succeeded in bringing down the Tōjō cabinet and led directly to Tōjō&#x27;s replacement as prime minister with General Kuniaki Koiso.

==National Defense Brotherhood==

After the fall of the Tōjō cabinet, Kishi temporarily withdrew from frontline politics, reinventing himself as a key figure in the civilian &quot;continue the war&quot; (&quot;kōsenha&quot;) faction while working in the background to foment a new political movement dedicated to prolonging the war. Between January and March 1945 Kishi held meetings with several close associates such as Ryōichi Sasakawa, a preeminent fascist political fixer; Yoshio Kodama, a prominent rightist deeply involved in Japan&#x27;s criminal underworld; Mamoru Shigemitsu, the then-Foreign Minister; and party politician and future prime minister Ichirō Hatoyama. Out of these meetings came a plan to form a new renovationist political movement aimed at further mobilizing the Japanese population for a final, decisive confrontation with the Allies.

Kishi&#x27;s plans coincided with the dissolution of the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association (IRAPA) in March 1945. Out of the IRAPA&#x27;s disbandment emerged two political associations: the mainstream Greater Japan Political Association (&quot;Dai Nippon Seijikai&quot;), led by General Jirō Minami, and Kishi&#x27;s anti-mainstream National Defense Brotherhood (&quot;Gokoku Dōshikai&quot;). Some 32 Diet members jumped ship to join Kishi&#x27;s new association by the end of March.

Under Kishi&#x27;s guidance, the Dōshikai advocated the mass evacuation and dispersion of the urban population and industrial base to the countryside to avoid the increasingly devastating effects of US aerial bombardment, the further rationalization of the economy in line with Kishi&#x27;s technocratic worldview, and systematic preparation for a &quot;decisive battle&quot; (&quot;kessen&quot;) with the Americans on Japanese soil that would reverse the tide of the war and reignite popular support for his Total War ideology.

The Dōshikai soon came into conflict with the new government of Prime Minister Kantarō Suzuki, who had grave doubts about how much longer the war could be sustained without bringing about a revolution, and sought to suppress Kishi&#x27;s nascent political movement. Excluded from the cabinet, members of the Dōshikai were limited to occasionally haranguing against Suzuki&#x27;s policies during Diet debates.

In any case, events rapidly overtook Kishi&#x27;s new movement, and the war came to an end just a few months after the Dōshikai&#x27;s formation. With Emperor Hirohito&#x27;s announcement of Japan&#x27;s surrender on 15 August, the &quot;continue the war&quot; movement came to an end. That same day, Kishi and his followers met in an undisclosed office and agreed to formally disband the Dōshikai.

==Prisoner in Sugamo==
After the Japanese surrender to the Allies in August 1945, Kishi, with other members of the former Japanese government, was held at Sugamo Prison as a suspected &quot;Class A&quot; war criminal by the order of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers. Kishi, Kodama, Sasakawa, and Matsutarō Shōriki, the former president of the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper, lived in the same prison cell and were never judged. Their fraternity formed in prison continued for the rest of their lives.

During this time, a group of influential Americans who had formed themselves into an &quot;American Council on Japan&quot; came to Kishi&#x27;s aid, and lobbied the American government to release him as they considered Kishi to be among the best men to lead post-war Japan. The American Council on Japan included former ambassador to Japan Joseph C. Grew, retired diplomat Eugene Dooman, &quot;Newsweek&quot; journalists Harry Kern and Compton Packenham, and corporate lawyer James L. Kauffman. Unlike Hideki Tōjō (and several other Cabinet members) who were put on trial, Kishi was released in December 1948 as part of the Reverse Course, and was never indicted or tried by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. However, he remained legally prohibited from entering public affairs because of the Allied occupation&#x27;s purge of members of the old regime.

During his time as a prisoner, Kishi had already begun planning his political comeback. He conceived of the idea of building on his earlier National Defense Brotherhood to establish a mass party uniting the more moderate socialists and conservatives into a &quot;popular movement of national salvation&quot;, a populist party that would use statist methods to encourage economic growth and would mobilize all Japanese citizens to rally in support of its nationalist policies.

== Return to politics ==

When the prohibition on former government members was fully rescinded in 1952 with the end of the Allied occupation of Japan, Kishi returned to politics and was central in creating the &quot;Japan Reconstruction Federation&quot; (&quot;Nippon Saiken Renmei&quot;), drawing upon his earlier efforts with the National Defense Brotherhood. Besides becoming prime minister, Kishi&#x27;s main aim in politics was to revise the American-imposed constitution, especially Article 9. Kishi wrote that in order for Japan to regain its status as a &quot;respectable member (of) the community of nations it would first have to revise its constitution and rearm: If Japan is alone in renouncing war ... she will not be able to prevent others from invading her land. If, on the other hand, Japan could defend herself, there would be no further need of keeping United States garrison forces in Japan ... Japan should be strong enough to defend herself.&quot;

Kishi&#x27;s Japan Reconstruction Federation fared disastrously in the 1952 elections, and Kishi failed in his bid to be elected to the Diet. After that defeat, Kishi disbanded his party, and tried to join the Socialists; after being rebuffed, he reluctantly joined the Liberal Party instead. After being elected to the Diet as a Liberal in 1953, Kishi&#x27;s main activities revolved around undermining the leader of the Liberal Party, Shigeru Yoshida, so he could become the Liberal leader in his place. Kishi&#x27;s main avenues of attack were that Yoshida was far too deferential to the Americans and the need to do away with Article 9. In April 1954 Yoshida expelled Kishi from the party in retaliation for his attempts to depose him as Liberal leader.

Kishi had foreseen this eventuality, and by this time, had already identified over 200 members of the Diet who would be willing to join him in forming a new political party to challenge Yoshida. Kishi wooed these politicians by flashing &quot;show money&quot; (&quot;misegane&quot;) that he had been supplied by his powerful big business backers. In November 1954, Kishi co-founded the new Democratic Party along with Ichirō Hatoyama. Hatoyama was the party leader, but Kishi was the party secretary, and crucially, controlled the party&#x27;s finances, which thus made him the dominant force within the Democrats. Elections in Japan were very expensive, so few candidates to the Diet could afford the costs of an election campaign out of their own pockets or could fund-raise enough money for a successful bid for the Diet. As a result, candidates to the Diet needed a steady infusion of money from the party-secretariat to run a winning campaign, which made Kishi a powerful force within the Democratic Party as he determined which candidates received money from the party-secretariat and how much. As a result, Democratic candidates for the Diet either seeking election for the first time or reelection were constantly seeing Kishi to seek his favor. Reflecting Kishi&#x27;s power as party secretary, Hatoyama was described as an &quot;omikoshi&quot;, a type of portable Shinto shrine carried around to be worshipped. Everyone bows downs and worships an &quot;omikoshi&quot;, but to move an &quot;omikoshi&quot;, it must be picked up and carried by somebody.
In February 1955, the Democrats won the general elections. On the day after Hatoyama was sworn in as prime minister, Kishi began talks with the Liberals about merging the two parties now that his arch-enemy Yoshida had stepped down as Liberal leader. In November 1955, the Democratic Party and Liberal Party merged to elect Ichirō Hatoyama as the head of the new Liberal Democratic Party. Within the new party, Kishi once again became the party secretary with control of the party finances. Kishi had reassured the American ambassador John Allison that &quot;for the next twenty five years it would be in Japan&#x27;s best interests to cooperate closely with the United States.&quot;

When Hatoyama stepped down in December 1956, Kishi was considered the leading candidate to succeed him. Kishi came first in the first round in the party presidential election, but was narrowly defeated by Tanzan Ishibashi in the second due to the Ishibashi camp cooperating with the third candidate Mitsujirō Ishii. The Americans wanted Kishi to become prime minister and were disappointed when Ishibashi, the least pro-American among the major LDP figures, won the party&#x27;s leadership, leading an American diplomat to write the U.S. had bet its &quot;money on Kishi, but the wrong horse won&quot;. 

Ishibashi appointed Kishi as foreign minister in his cabinet to ensure party unity, but Ishibashi soon fell ill and designated Kishi as acting prime minister at the end of January 1957. Ishibashi resigned as prime minister at the end of February 1957 and as party president in March. Kishi succeeded him in both posts.

== Prime Minister of Japan ==

===Policy goals===
In February 1957, Kishi became prime minister following the resignation of the ailing Tanzan Ishibashi. His main concerns were with foreign policy, especially with revising the 1952 U.S-Japan Security Treaty, which he felt had turned Japan into a virtual American protectorate. Revising the security treaty was understood to be the first step towards his ultimate goal of abolishing Article 9. Besides his desire for a more independent foreign policy, Kishi wanted to establish close economic relations with the various states of South-East Asia. Finally, Kishi wanted the Allies to commute the remaining sentences of the Class B and Class C war criminals still in serving their prison sentences, arguing that for Japan to play its role in the Cold War as a Western ally required forgetting about Japan&#x27;s war crimes in the past.

===Pursuit of an Asian Development Fund===

In the first year of Kishi&#x27;s term, Japan joined the United Nations Security Council, paid war reparations to Indonesia, signed a new commercial treaty with Australia, and signed peace treaties with Czechoslovakia and Poland. In 1957, Kishi presented a plan for a Japanese-dominated Asian Development Fund (ADF), which was to operate under the slogan &quot;Economic Development for Asia by Asia&quot;, calling for Japan to invest millions of yen in Southeast Asia. With access to markets in China and North Korea cut off due to Cold War polarization, Japanese and American leaders alike looked to Southeast Asia as a market for Japanese goods and source of raw materials. Moreover, the Americans wanted more aid to Asia to spur economic growth that would stem the appeal of Communism, but were disinclined to spend the money themselves. The prospect of Japan spending some $500 million US in low interest loans and aid projects in Southeast Asia had the benefit from Kishi&#x27;s viewpoint of improving his standing in Washington, and giving him more leverage in his talks to revise the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty.

In pursuit of the ADF, Kishi visited India, Pakistan, Burma, Thailand, Ceylon, and Taiwan in May 1957, asking the leaders of those states to join the ADF, but with the exception of Taiwan, which agreed to join, the other nations gave equivocal answers. In November, Kishi once again toured Southeast Asia to promote the idea of an ADF, this time visiting South Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand. These countries, all of which Japan had attacked and/or occupied during World War II, also expressed ambivalence or disdain toward joining the proposed framework, with the sole exception of Laos, which was in desperate need of foreign aid at that time. Even in countries that were not occupied by Japan like India, Ceylon, and Pakistan, Kishi encountered obstacles. Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru told Kishi during his visit to New Delhi that he wanted his nation to be neutral in the Cold War, and given that Japan was allied to the United States, joining the ADF would be in effect aligning India with the Americans. During his visit to Karachi, the Pakistani Prime Minister Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy told Kishi that he thought of himself as a &quot;human being rather than an Asian first&quot;, and preferred bilateral over multilateral aid because a multilateral aid framework would put participating countries into competition with each other over aid distribution. In sum, bad memories of Japan&#x27;s wartime depredations in the region, a suspicion of Japanese motives, an unwillingness to enter into neo-colonial relationship with Japan as suppliers of raw materials, Cold War neutralism, and a fear that America was secretly pulling the strings all contributed to the failure of Kishi&#x27;s ambitious plans to create an Asian economic block reminiscent of &quot;Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere&quot; that Japan had claimed to be pursuing in World War II. Ultimately, even the United States was lukewarm about Kishi&#x27;s project, so it was shelved for the time being, although it was later partially revived in the form of the Asian Development Bank.

===Pursuit of treaty revision===

Kishi&#x27;s next foreign policy initiative was potentially even more difficult: reworking Japan&#x27;s security relationship with the United States. Kishi always saw the system created by the Americans as temporary and intended that one day Japan would resume its role as a great power; in the interim, he was prepared to work within the American-created system both domestically and internationally to safeguard what he regarded as Japan&#x27;s interests. In June 1957, Kishi visited the United States, where he was received with honor, being allowed to address a joint session of Congress, throwing the opening pitch for the New York Yankees in a baseball game in New York and being allowed to play golf at an otherwise all-white golf club in Virginia, which the American historian Michael Schaller called &quot;remarkable&quot; honors for a man who as a Cabinet minister had signed the declaration of war against the United States in 1941 and who had presided over the conscription of thousands of Koreans and Chinese as slave labor during World War II. Vice President of the United States Richard Nixon introduced Kishi to Congress as an &quot;honored guest&quot; who was &quot;not only a great leader of the free world, but also a loyal and great friend of the people of the United States.&quot;

In November 1957, Kishi laid down his proposals for a revamped extension of the US–Japan Mutual Security Treaty, and the Eisenhower administration finally agreed to negotiations on a revised version. The American ambassador Douglas MacArthur II (the nephew of the famous general) had reported to Washington that Kishi was the only Japanese politician who could stem the tide towards anti-Americanism in the country, and if the U.S. refused to revise the security treaty in Japan&#x27;s favor, Japan could turn toward neutralism or accommodation with the communist bloc. The U.S. Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, wrote in a memo to President Eisenhower that the United States was &quot;at the point of having to make a Big Bet&quot; in Japan and Kishi was the &quot;only bet we had left in Japan&quot;. Meanwhile, Kishi was able to take advantage of a growing anti-US military base movement in Japan, as exemplified by the ongoing Sunagawa Struggle over proposed expansion of the US air base at Tachikawa and the explosion of anger in Japan over the Girard Incident, to insinuate to U.S. leaders that if the treaty were not revised the continued existence of U.S. bases in Japan might become untenable.

Anticipating public opposition to his plans for revising the security treaty, Kishi brought before the Diet a harsh &quot;Police Duties Bill&quot;, which would give the police vastly expanded powers to crush demonstrations and to conduct searches of homes without warrants. In response to the police bill, a nationwide coalition of left-leaning civic organizations led by the Japan Socialist Party and the Sōhyō labor federation launched a variety of protest activities in the fall of 1958 with the aim of killing the bill. These protests succeeded in arousing public anger at the bill and Kishi was forced to withdraw it.

===The 1960 Anpo Protests===

In late 1959, it became clear that Kishi intended to break with longstanding precedent that prime ministers serve no more than two consecutive terms. Kishi hoped that by successfully revising the Security Treaty, he would have attained the political capital necessary to pull off this feat. In response to Kishi&#x27;s break with tradition, Kishi&#x27;s opponents within his own Liberal Democratic Party, who felt they had waited long enough for their chance at power, vowed to do whatever was necessary to bring about the end of his premiership. Meanwhile, final negotiations on the new treaty wrapped up in 1959, and in January 1960, Kishi traveled to Washington, D.C., where he signed the new treaty with President Eisenhower on January 19. During his visit to the United States, Kishi appeared on the January 25, 1960 cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, which declared that the Prime Minister&#x27;s &quot;134 pound body packed pride, power and passion—a perfect embodiment of his country&#x27;s amazing resurgence&quot; while &quot;Newsweek&quot; called him the &quot;Friendly, Savvy Salesman from Japan&quot; who had created the &quot;economic powerhouse of Asia&quot;.

However, even though the revised treaty addressed almost all of Japan&#x27;s complaints with the original treaty, and put the U.S.-Japan alliance on a much more equal footing, the notion of having any sort of security treaty at all with the United States was unpopular with broad sections of the Japanese public, who saw the treaty as allowing for Japan to once again become involved in a war. In 1959, the nationwide coalition that had successfully defeated Kishi&#x27;s Police Duties Bill in 1958 had rebranded itself as the &quot;People&#x27;s Council for Preventing Revision of the Security Treaty&quot; (&quot;Anpo Jōyaku Kaitei Soshi Kokumin Kaigi&quot;) and began recruiting additional member organizations and organizing protest activities against the revised Security Treaty. In a sign of things to come, radical student activists from the Zengakuren student federation and leftist labor unionists invaded the compound of the National Diet in November 1959 to express their anger at the Treaty, and in January, Zengakuren activists organized a sit-in in Tokyo&#x27;s Haneda Airport to attempt to prevent Kishi from flying to Washington to sign the treaty, but were cleared away by police.

Because the new treaty was better than the old one, Kishi expected it to be ratified in relatively short order. Accordingly, he invited Eisenhower to visit Japan beginning on June 19, 1960, in part to celebrate the newly ratified treaty. If Eisenhower&#x27;s visit had proceeded as planned, he would have become the first sitting US president to visit Japan. However, when debate on the treaty began in the Diet, the opposition Japan Socialist Party, abetted by Kishi&#x27;s rivals in his own party, employed a variety of parliamentary tactics to drag out debate as long as possible, in hopes of preventing ratification before Eisenhower&#x27;s planned arrival on June 19, and giving the extra-parliamentary protests more time to grow.

As the date of Eisenhower&#x27;s planned visit drew near, Kishi grew increasingly desperate to ratify the treaty in time for his arrival. On May 19, 1960, Kishi suddenly called for a snap vote on the Treaty. When Socialist Diet members attempted a sit-in to block the vote, Kishi introduced 500 policemen into the Diet and had his political opponents physically dragged out by the police. Kishi then passed the revised Treaty with only members of his own party present. Kishi&#x27;s anti-democratic actions during this &quot;May 19 Incident&quot; outraged much of the nation, with even conservative newspapers calling for Kishi&#x27;s resignation. Thereafter, the anti-Treaty protest movement dramatically increased in size, with the Sōhyō labor federation carrying out a series of nationwide strikes and large crowds gathering around the National Diet on nearly a daily basis.

On June 10, White House Press Secretary James Hagerty arrived at Tokyo&#x27;s Haneda Airport to make advance preparations for Eisenhower&#x27;s impending arrival. Hagerty was picked up in a black car by US Ambassador to Japan Douglas MacArthur II, who deliberately provoked an international incident by ordering that the car be driven into a large crowd of protesters. MacArthur felt that if the demonstrators were going to resort to violence it would be better for both the US and Japanese governments to know rather than waiting to test their resolve at the arrival of the President. In the so-called &quot;Hagerty Incident&quot;, the protesters surrounded the car, rocking it back and forth for more than an hour while standing on its roof, chanting anti-American slogans, and singing protest songs. Ultimately, MacArthur and Hagerty had to be rescued by a US Marines military helicopter.

On 15 June 1960, the radical student activists from Zengakuren attempted to storm the Diet compound once again, precipitating a fierce battle with police in which a female Tokyo University student named Michiko Kanba was killed. Kanba&#x27;s death led to the largest demonstrations ever in Japanese history, against both police brutality and the treaty. By this point, Kishi had become so unpopular that all the LDP factions united to demand that he resign. In April 1960, across the Korea straits, South Korean president Syngman Rhee had been overthrown in the April Revolution, led by protesting university students, and at the time, there were serious fears in Japan that protests led by university students against the Kishi government might likewise lead to a revolution, making it imperative to ditch the very unpopular Kishi.

Desperate to stay in office long enough to host Eisenhower&#x27;s visit, Kishi hoped to secure the streets in time for Eisenhower&#x27;s arrival by calling out the Japan Self Defense Forces and tens of thousands of right-wing thugs that would be provided by his friend, the yakuza-affiliated right-wing &quot;fixer&quot; Yoshio Kodama. However, he was talked out of these extreme measures by his cabinet, and thereafter had no choice but to cancel Eisenhower&#x27;s visit and take responsibility for the chaos by announcing on June 16 that he would resign within one month&#x27;s time.

Despite Kishi&#x27;s announcement, the anti-Treaty protests grew larger than ever, with the largest protest of the entire movement taking place on June 18. However, on June 19, the revised Security Treaty automatically took effect in accordance with Japanese law, 30 days after having passed the lower house of the Diet. On July 15, 1960, Kishi officially resigned and Hayato Ikeda became prime minister. Ikeda soon made clear that there would be no further attempts by the LDP to revise Article 9 of the Constitution for the foreseeable future, which from Kishi&#x27;s perspective, meant that all of his efforts had been for naught.

==Stabbing incident==

On July 14, 1960, Kishi was attacked by a knife-wielding assailant as he was leaving the prime minister&#x27;s residence to host a garden party celebrating Hayato Ikeda&#x27;s impending ascension to the premiership. The assailant was Taisuke Aramaki, an unemployed 65-year-old man affiliated with various right wing groups. Aramaki stabbed Kishi six times in the thigh, causing Kishi to bleed profusely, although Kishi survived because the blade had missed major arteries. Kishi was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he received a total of 30 stitches to close his wounds. Reporters raced after him and climbed on stepladders to peer into his hospital room, with nurses angrily closing the curtains on them.

Aramaki was arrested at the scene, tried, found guilty, and sentenced to three years in prison in May 1962. Despite being unemployed, he had somehow been able to post a substantial bail during the intervening two years.

Aramaki never clearly stated the motivations for his attack. Despite the violent nature of the attack, Aramaki denied that he had intended to kill Kishi, later telling a reporter in an interview, &quot;Yeah, I stabbed him six times, but if I wanted him dead, I would have just killed him.&quot; Aramaki told the same reporter that he had visited with the family of Michiko Kanba prior to his attack, perhaps suggesting that he sympathized with Kanba and blamed Kishi for her death. According to court records, Aramaki told police that he was angry at Kishi&#x27;s mishandling of the Security Treaty crisis and wanted to &quot;encourage Kishi to feel remorse&quot;.

However, some figures close to Kishi considered Aramaki&#x27;s supposed anger in relation to the Anpo protests to be a cover story. In her 1992 memoir, Kishi&#x27;s daughter Yōko wrote that Aramaki was &quot;a paid assassin, who knew how to use a knife, who was hired by someone who hated my father and wanted to hurt him&quot;. In the prewar period, Aramaki had been secretary general of the right-wing ultranationalist Taikakai (&quot;Great Reform Society&quot;), and in the post-war period, he became a member of LDP factional leader Banboku Ōno&#x27;s private extraparliamentary pressure group (&quot;ingaidan&quot;). Many LDP politicians felt that the stabbing had been carried out at Ōno&#x27;s behest, as Ōno had openly hoped to succeed Kishi as prime minister and was known to be angry that Kishi had thrown his support behind Ikeda.

Curiously, Kishi was largely silent on the attack in his memoirs, devoting only two lines to it and saying only that he did not know the reason, and Kishi&#x27;s brother Eisaku Satō did not even mention the attack in his diary entry for that day.

==Later years==

After taking power in a coup d&#x27;état in May 1961, the South Korean dictator General Park Chung Hee visited Japan in November 1961 to discuss establishing diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea, which were finally achieved in 1965. Park had been a Japanese military officer serving in the Manchukuo Army and had fought with the Kwantung Army against guerrillas in Manchuria. During his visit to Japan, Park met with Kishi, and speaking in his fluent, albeit heavily Korean-accented Japanese, praised Japan for the &quot;efficiency of the Japanese spirit&quot;, and said that he wanted to learn &quot;good plans&quot; from Japan for South Korea. Besides fond reminiscences about the Japanese officers in Manchukuo who taught him about how to give a &quot;good thrashing&quot; to one&#x27;s opponents, Park was very interested in Kishi&#x27;s economic policies in Manchuria as a model for South Korea. Kishi told the Japanese press after his meeting with Park that he was a &quot;little embarrassed&quot; by Park&#x27;s rhetoric, which was virtually unchanged from the sort of talk used by Japanese officers in World War II, with none of the concessions to the world of 1961 that Kishi himself employed. During his time as president of South Korea, Park launched the Five-Year Plans for the economic development of South Korea featuring statist economic policies that very closely resembled Five-Year Plan Kishi had administered in Manchukuo.

For the rest of his life, Kishi remained devoted to the cause of revising the Japanese Constitution to get rid of Article 9 and remilitarizing Japan. In 1965, Kishi gave a speech where he called for Japanese rearmament as &quot;a means of eradicating completely the consequences of Japan&#x27;s defeat and the American occupation. It is necessary to enable Japan finally to move out of the post-war era and for the Japanese people to regain their self-confidence and pride as Japanese.&quot; In his final years, Kishi grew increasingly bitter that constitutional revision had not yet come to pass. In his memoirs, he somewhat angrily recalled, &quot;the idea of constitutional revision had always remained at the forefront of [my] mind... The two main culprits in destroying the momentum toward constitutional revision were Hayato Ikeda and my brother, Eisaku Satō, who, while they held power, made sure the constitution would remain unchanged. That is why the call for constitutional revision died with my administration.&quot;

Kishi remained in the Diet until retiring from politics in 1979. Even after he retired, he remained a strong influence behind the scenes in LDP politics. After several months of illness, Kishi died on August 7, 1987, at the age of 90.

== Controversies ==

===Accusations of corruption===
Political scientist Richard Samuels has found extensive corruption during Kishi&#x27;s time as prime minister. In February 1958, when the Indonesian president Sukarno visited Japan, the Tokyo police refused to provide security under the grounds that this was a private visit, not a state one. At that point, Kishi asked one of his close friends, the yakuza gangster Yoshio Kodama, to provide thugs from the underworld for Sukarno&#x27;s protection. During Sukarno&#x27;s visit, Kishi negotiated a reparations agreement with Indonesia, where Japan agreed to provide compensation for war-time suffering. Kishi&#x27;s reasons for paying reparations to Indonesia had less to do with guilt over the Japanese occupation and more to do with the chances to engage in questionable contracts to reward his friends as Kishi insisted that Japan would only pay reparations in the form of goods, not money. In April 1958, Kishi told the Indonesian Foreign Minister Soebandrio that he wanted Indonesia to ask to receive reparations in the form of ships built exclusively by the Kinoshita Trading Company-which happened to be run by Kinoshita Shigeru, a metal merchant and an old friend of Kishi&#x27;s from their Manchurian days in the 1930s-even though the Kinoshita company had never built ships before, and there were many other well-established Japanese shipbuilders who could have provided ships at a lower price. All of the reparations contracts to the various states of South-East Asia during Kishi&#x27;s time as prime minister went to firms run by businessmen who were closely associated with him during his time in Manchuria in the 1930s. Additionally, there were frequent claims that when it came time to award reparations contracts, high-ranking Indonesian politicians had to receive kickbacks, and that ordinary Indonesians never received any benefits from the reparations.

During the same period, there were questions about the M-fund, a secret American fund intended to stabilize Japan economically. The American Assistant Attorney General Norbert Schlei alleged, &quot;Beginning with Prime Minister Kishi, the Fund has been treated as a private preserve of the individuals into whose control it has fallen. Those individuals have felt able to appropriate huge sums from the Fund for their own personal and political purposes... The litany of abuses begins with Kishi who, after obtaining control of the fund from (then Vice President Richard) Nixon, helped himself to a fortune of one trillion yen.&quot;

===Release of war criminals===
Like many of his fellow conservatives in Japan, Kishi believed that Japan&#x27;s war in Asia and the Pacific had been a war not of aggression but of self-defense, and thus that the treatment of himself and his colleagues as &quot;war criminals&quot; was unjustified and merely an example of victor&#x27;s justice. As prime minister, he pressured the Eisenhower administration into expediting the release of convicted Class B and Class C war criminals. He also sought to commemorate executed Class A war criminals. In 1960, Kishi was involved in dedicating, on Mount Sangane in Aichi prefecture, a headstone to General Tojo and six other military leaders executed after the Tokyo war crimes trial, marking their grave as that of &quot;the seven patriots who died for their country&quot;.

===Connections to Unification Church===

Beginning in the mid-1960s, Kishi developed connections to the Unification Church (UC, sometimes known as the &quot;Moonies&quot;) in Japan. The sect shared Kishi&#x27;s commitment to anti-communism and enjoyed protection from prosecution by the LDP. Kishi was publicly known as a friend of the sect&#x27;s leader Sun Myung Moon (1920–2012). Their headquarters in Japan was built “on land in Tokyo once owned by Kishi.&quot; When Moon was convicted and jailed for tax evasion in the United States, Kishi wrote a letter asking President Ronald Reagan to correct the &quot;injustice&quot; and release Moon. At this point, the UC&#x27;s forcible recruitment of young people in Japan had already garnered attention as a societal problem, but Kishi evaluated the leader of the cult as &quot;sincere and valuable.&quot; The relationship between the Kishi and Abe families and the UC was maintained even after that. The LDP/UC cooperation has carried on until the present day.

Tetsuya Yamagami, the suspect in the assassination of Kishi&#x27;s grandson Shinzo Abe, blamed the UC for his family&#x27;s financial problems and his older brother&#x27;s death from neglected leukemia, holding a grudge against the group. Researching the church&#x27;s connections to Abe in the months before the attack, he blamed Abe and Kishi for spreading the church&#x27;s influence in Japan.

== Personal life and descendants ==
In 1919, Kishi married his cousin Yoshiko Kishi, and was adopted by her father, shizoku Nobumasa Kishi. Their son Nobukazu was born in 1921, and their daughter Yōko was born in 1928.

Kishi&#x27;s daughter Yōko Kishi married politician and future foreign minister Shintarō Abe. Their second son, Shinzō Abe, served as prime minister of Japan from 2006 to 2007 and again from 2012 to 2020. Their third son, Nobuo Kishi, was adopted by Kishi&#x27;s son Nobukazu shortly after birth, lived with Kishi during the later years of his life, won Kishi&#x27;s historical Diet seat in 2012, and became Minister of Defense in 2020.

<text>Johann Gottlob Theaenus Schneider (18 January 1750 – 12 January 1822) was a German classicist and naturalist.

==Biography==
Schneider was born at Collm in Saxony. In 1774, on the recommendation of Christian Gottlob Heine, he became secretary to the famous Strasbourg scholar Richard François Brunck, and in 1811, became professor of ancient languages and eloquence at Breslau (chief librarian, 1816) where he died in 1822.

==Works==
Of his numerous works the most important was his &quot;Kritisches griechisch-deutsches Handwörterbuch&quot; (1797–1798), the first independent work of the kind since Stephanus&#x27;s &quot;Thesaurus&quot;, and the basis of F. Passow&#x27;s and all succeeding Greek lexicons (including, therefore, the contemporary standard &quot;A Greek-English Lexicon&quot;). A special improvement was the introduction of words and expressions connected with natural history and science.

In 1801, he corrected and expanded re-published Marcus Elieser Bloch&#x27;s &quot;Systema Ichthyologiae iconibus cx illustratum&quot;, a famous catalog of fishes with beautiful illustrations that is cited (as Bloch and Schneider, 1801) as the taxonomy authority for many species of fish.

The scientific writings of ancient authors especially attracted him. He published editions of Aelian, &quot;De natura animalium&quot;; Nicander, &quot;Alexipharmaca&quot; and &quot;Theriaca&quot;; the &quot;Scriptores rei rusticae&quot;; Aristotle, &quot;Historia animalium&quot; and &quot;Politica&quot;; Epicurus, &quot;Physica&quot; and &quot;Meteorologica&quot;; Theophrastus&#x27;s &quot;Historia plantarum&quot;, &quot;Eclogae physicae&quot;; Oppian, &quot;Halieutica&quot; and &quot;Cynegetica&quot;; the complete works of Xenophon and Vitruvius; the &quot;Argonautica&quot; of the so-called &quot;Orpheus&quot; (for which Ruhnken nicknamed him &quot;Orpheomastix&quot;); an essay on the life and writings of Pindar and a collection of his fragments. His &quot;Eclogae physicae&quot; is a selection of extracts of various length from Greek and Latin writers on scientific subjects, containing the original text and commentary, with essays on natural history and science in ancient times.

==Legacy==

Schneider is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of lizard, &quot;Eumeces schneiderii&quot;.

<text>Cassander (; ; 355 BC – 297 BC) was king of the Ancient Greek kingdom of Macedonia from 305 BC until 297 BC, and &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of southern Greece from 317 BC until his death.

A son of Antipater and a contemporary of Alexander the Great, Cassander was one of the Diadochi who warred over Alexander&#x27;s empire following the latter&#x27;s death in 323 BC. Cassander later seized power by having Alexander&#x27;s son and heir Alexander IV murdered. While governing Macedonia from 317 BC until 297 BC, Cassander focused on strengthening the northern borders and economic development, while founding or restoring several cities (including Thessalonica, Cassandreia, and Thebes); however, his ruthlessness in dealing with political enemies complicates assessments of his rule.

==Early history==
In his youth, Cassander was taught by the philosopher Aristotle at the Lyceum in Macedonia. He was educated alongside Alexander the Great in a group that included Hephaestion, Ptolemy and Lysimachus. His family were distant collateral relatives to the Argead dynasty.

Cassander is first recorded as arriving at Alexander the Great&#x27;s court in Babylon in 323 BC, where he had been sent by his father, Antipater, most likely to help uphold Antipater&#x27;s regency in Macedon, although a later contemporary who was hostile to the Antipatrids suggested that Cassander had journeyed to the court to poison the King. Cassander left Alexander&#x27;s court either shortly before or after the king&#x27;s death in June of 323 BC, playing no part in the immediate power struggles over the empire. Cassander returned to Macedonia and assisted his father&#x27;s governance, he was later assigned by Antipater to Antigonus as his chiliarch from 321 to 320, probably to monitor the latter&#x27;s activities.

==Rule of Macedon==

As Antipater grew close to death in 319 BC, he transferred the regency of Macedon not to Cassander, but to Polyperchon, possibly so as not to alarm the other Diadochi through an apparent move towards dynastic ambition, but perhaps also because of Cassander&#x27;s own ambitions. Cassander rejected his father&#x27;s decision, and immediately went to seek the support of Antigonus, Ptolemy and Lysimachus as his allies. Waging war on Polyperchon, Cassander destroyed his fleet, put Athens under the control of Demetrius of Phaleron, and declared himself Regent in 317 BC. After Olympias’ successful move against Philip III later in the year, Cassander besieged her in Pydna. When the city fell in the spring of 316, Olympias was killed, and Cassander had Alexander IV and Roxana confined at Amphipolis.

That year, Cassander associated himself with the Argead dynasty by marrying Alexander&#x27;s half-sister, Thessalonike, and overseeing the burial of Phillip III and Eurydice in the royal cemetery at Aegae; he further cemented his authority by founding Thessalonica, Cassandreia, and rebuilding Thebes. From 314 to 310, Cassander campaigned to the west and north, for a time extending Macedonian power as far as Apollonia and Epidamus, but was driven out by local rulers like Glaucius; his rule in Macedonia remained firm as he resettled defeated enemies in the tradition of Phillip II and fostered trade in the regions around his new cities. Cassander had Alexander IV and Roxana secretly poisoned in either 310 BC or the following year.

By 309 BC, Polyperchon had begun to claim that Heracles of Macedon was the true heir to the Macedonian inheritance, at which point Cassander bribed Polyperchon to kill the boy, promising him an alliance and the return of his Macedonian estates. After this, Cassander&#x27;s position in Greece and Macedonia was reasonably secure, and he proclaimed himself king in 305 BC. Diodorus Siculus relates that Cassander, Ptolemy, and Lysimachus declared their kingships in response to the assumption of royal title by Antigonus, following his victory over Ptolemy at Salamis in 306.

In 307–304 BC he fought the so-called Four–Years&#x27; War against Athens. In 304 BC, his rival Antigonus Monophthalmus sent his son Demetrius Poliorcetes to aid Athens against Cassander. Demetrius succeeded in driving Cassander from central Greece and created a Hellenic League, &quot;the League of Corinth&quot;, against him. In the winter of 303–302 BC, Cassander opened negotiations with Antigonus with a view to establish peace, but Antigonus refused. At this Cassander turned to Lysimachus, Ptolemy, and Seleucus and convinced them to reform the coalition of 314–311 against Antigonus. In early 302 BC, Cassander sent one of his generals, Prepelaus, with an army from Macedon to join Lysimachus in an invasion of Antigonus&#x27;s territory in Asia-Minor. Cassander himself marched with the main Macedonian field army into Thessaly to stop Demetrius from advancing into Macedon. Demetrius invaded Thessaly with a numerically superior force, Cassander stopped his advance by refusing to give battle and fortifying his positions. Lysimachus and Prepalaus had been very successful in Asia-Minor and Seleucus was marching with an army to join them. In the spring of 302 BC, Antigonus marched with an army from Syria into Asia-Minor to confront his enemies; he confronted Lysimachus and drove him from Phrygia. Antigonus realizing that the war would probably have to be decided in a major battle in Asia-Minor recalled Demetrius from Thessaly. With Demetrius gone Cassander sent part of his army with his brother, Pleistarchus, to join Prepalaus, Lysimachus and Seleucus in Asia-Minor. In 301 BC, the combined armies of Lysimachus, Seleucus, Prepalaus and Pleistarchus faced the combined armies of Antigonus and Demetrius at Ipsus. After the Battle of Ipsus in which Antigonus was killed, Cassander was undisputed in his control of Macedon; however, he had little time to savour the fact, dying of dropsy in 297 BC.

Cassander&#x27;s dynasty did not live much beyond his death, with his son Philip dying of natural causes, and his other sons Alexander and Antipater becoming involved in a destructive dynastic struggle along with their mother. When Alexander was ousted as joint king by his brother, Demetrius I took up Alexander&#x27;s appeal for aid and ousted Antipater, killed Alexander V and established the Antigonid dynasty. The remaining Antipatrids, such as Antipater II Etesias, were unable to re-establish the Antipatrids on the throne.

== Legacy ==

Cassander stood out amongst the Diadochi in his hostility to Alexander&#x27;s memory. Arrian later reported that he could not pass a statue of Alexander without feeling faint. Cassander has been perceived to be ambitious and unscrupulous, and even members of his own family were estranged from him. However, historians like John D. Grainger argue this characterization owes much to stories spread by his rivals.

Cassander was responsible for the deaths of more Argeads than other Diadochi, (Alexander IV, Roxana, and Alexander&#x27;s supposed illegitimate son Heracles, as well as allowing Olympias to be killed by a Macedonian assembly), he was not the only one willing to kill Alexander&#x27;s relatives: Polyperchon and Antigonus were just as willing to do the same when it benefitted them. From numismatic evidence, Evan Pitt argues that Cassander&#x27;s actions until 311 BC were motivated more by self-preservation and maintenance of his own power rather than royal ambition and rivalry to Alexander the Great. Cassander&#x27;s decision to restore Thebes, which had been destroyed by Alexander, was perceived at the time to be a snub to the deceased king, though it also had the realpolitik effect of providing a power base for Cassander in Boeotia.

Like the other Diodochoi, Cassander participated in the appropriation of regal iconography which linked him to Alexander the Great. Other Diadochi depicted themselves and Alexander on their coins in profile with varying attributes, such as elephant-hide headdresses or horns; Cassander followed Alexander&#x27;s own precedent and had himself or the dead king wearing a lion-skin cloak stamped on one side of his coins. These royal iconographies established by Alexander and continued by his immediate successors set patterns for royal coinage which were influential and enduring across the Mediterranean and West Asia. Also of lasting significance was Cassander&#x27;s refoundation of Therma into Thessalonica, naming the city after his wife. Cassander also founded Cassandreia upon the ruins of Potidaea, as well as the city of Antipatreia in the Aspros Valley.

<text>Mods and rockers were two conflicting British youth subcultures of the late 1950s to mid 1960s. Media coverage of the two groups fighting in 1964 sparked a moral panic about British youth, and they became widely perceived as violent, unruly troublemakers.

The rocker subculture was centred on motorcycling. Rockers generally wore protective clothing such as black leather jackets and motorcycle boots or brothel creepers. The style was influenced by Marlon Brando in the 1953 film &quot;The Wild One&quot;. The common rocker hairstyle was a pompadour, while their music genre of choice was 1950s rock and roll and R&amp;B, played by artists including Eddie Cochran, Gene Vincent, and Bo Diddley, as well as British rock and roll musicians such as Billy Fury and Johnny Kidd.

The mod subculture was centred on fashion and music, and many mods wore parkas and rode scooters. Mods wore suits and other cleancut outfits, and listened to music genres such as modern jazz, soul, Motown, ska and British blues-rooted bands like the Yardbirds, the Small Faces, and later the Who and the Jam. The Who wrote a portrait of the cultures with their 1973 album and movie score &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;.

== Physical conflicts ==
BBC News stories from May 1964 stated that mods and rockers were jailed after riots in seaside resort towns in Southern England, such as Margate in Kent, Brighton in Sussex, and Clacton in Essex.

Conflicts took place at Clacton and Hastings during the Easter weekend of 1964. A second round took place on the south coast of England over the Whitsun weekend (18 and 19 May 1964), especially at Brighton, where fights occurred over two days and moved along the coast to Hastings and back; hence the &quot;Second Battle of Hastings&quot; tag. A small number of rockers were isolated on Brighton beach where they – despite being protected by police – were overwhelmed and assaulted by mods. Eventually calm was restored and a judge levied heavy fines, describing those arrested as &quot;sawdust Caesars.&quot;

Newspapers described the mod and rocker clashes as being of &quot;disastrous proportions&quot;, and labelled mods and rockers as &quot;vermin&quot; and &quot;louts&quot;. Newspaper editorials fanned the flames of hysteria, such as a &quot;Birmingham Post&quot; editorial in May 1964, which warned that mods and rockers were &quot;internal enemies&quot; in the UK who would &quot;bring about disintegration of a nation&#x27;s character&quot;. The magazine &quot;Police Review&quot; argued that the mods and rockers&#x27; purported lack of respect for law and order could cause violence to &quot;surge and flame like a forest fire&quot;.

As a result of this media coverage, two British members of parliament travelled to the seaside areas to survey the damage, and MP Harold Gurden called for a resolution for intensified measures to control hooliganism. One of the prosecutors in the trial of some of the Clacton brawlers argued that mods and rockers were youths with no serious views, who lacked respect for law and order.

There were occasional incidents thereafter. In 1980, during the mod revival, the punk rock band The Exploited recorded the song &quot;Fuck the Mods&quot; on their EP &quot;Army Life&quot;, whose back cover stated &quot;To all the Edinburgh punks and skins – keep on mod-bashing!!&quot; The band performed in Finsbury Park, London in 1981 on the same night that The Jam were playing nearby, and there was fighting after the gigs between the mods who had watched The Jam and the rockers who had watched The Exploited.

== Academic debunking ==
The sociologist Stanley Cohen was led by his retrospective study of the mods and rockers conflict to develop the term &quot;moral panic&quot;. In his 1972 study &quot;Folk Devils and Moral Panics&quot;, he examined media coverage of the mod and rocker riots in the 1960s. He concedes that mods and rockers had some fights in the mid-1960s, but argues that they were no different from the evening brawls that occurred between youths throughout the 1950s and early 1960s at seaside resorts and after football games. He argues that the UK media turned the mod subculture into a symbol of delinquent and deviant status.

Cohen argues that as media hysteria about knife-wielding mods increased, the image of a fur-collared anorak and scooter would &quot;stimulate hostile and punitive reactions&quot;. He says the media used possibly faked interviews with supposed rockers such as &quot;Mick the Wild One&quot;. The media also tried to exploit accidents that were unrelated to mod-rocker violence, such as an accidental drowning of a youth, which resulted in the headline &quot;Mod Dead in Sea&quot;.

Eventually, when the media ran out of real fights to report, they would publish deceptive headlines, such as using a subheading &quot;Violence&quot;, even when the article reported that there was no violence at all. Newspaper writers also began to associate mods and rockers with various social issues, such as teen pregnancy, contraceptives, amphetamines, and violence.

== Media ==
The 2010 remake of the 1948 film &quot;Brighton Rock&quot; is set in the era of mods and rockers, with Bank Holiday tribal clashes on Brighton promenades and beaches.

The 1979 film &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; starring Phil Daniels as Jimmy, Leslie Ash as Steph and Sting the lead singer of the English band Police as Ace Face, is set against the background of the 1964 Brighton clash with the incident featuring prominently.

In the Beatles&#x27; 1964 film &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, Ringo Starr was asked by a reporter, &quot;Are you a mod or a rocker?&quot; Starr answered, &quot;I&#x27;m a mocker.&quot;

<doc id="164283" wikidata="Q295530" url="?curid=164283" title="Philip III of Macedon">
<text>Philip III Arrhidaeus (; BC – 317 BC) was king of the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedonia from 323 until his execution in 317 BC. He was a son of King Philip II of Macedon by Philinna of Larissa, and thus an elder half-brother of Alexander the Great. Named Arrhidaeus at birth, he assumed the name Philip when he ascended to the throne.

As Arrhidaeus grew older it became apparent that he had mild learning difficulties. Plutarch was of the view that he became disabled by means of an attempt on his life by Philip II&#x27;s wife, Queen Olympias, who wanted to eliminate a possible rival to her son, Alexander, through the employment of &quot;pharmaka&quot; (drugs/spells); however, most modern authorities doubt the truth of this claim.

Alexander was fond of Arrhidaeus and took him on his campaigns, both to protect his life and to prevent his use as a pawn in any prospective challenge for the throne. After Alexander&#x27;s death in Babylon in 323 BC, the Macedonian army in Asia proclaimed Arrhidaeus as king; however, he served merely as a figurehead and as the pawn of a series of powerful generals.

==Biography==
Even though Arrhidaeus and Alexander were about the same age, Arrhidaeus appears never to have been a danger as an alternative choice for Alexander&#x27;s succession to Philip II. Nevertheless, when the Persian satrap of Caria, Pixodarus, proposed his daughter in marriage to Alexander, the king declined, offering his son Arrhidaeus as husband instead, and Alexander thought it prudent to block the dynastic union (which might have produced a possible future heir to Philip&#x27;s domain before Alexander himself did), resulting in considerable irritation on the part of his father (337 BC).

Arrhidaeus&#x27;s whereabouts during the reign of his brother Alexander are unclear from the extant sources; what is certain is that no civil or military command was given to him in those thirteen years (336–323 BC).

===Succession===
Arrhidaeus was in Babylon at the time of Alexander&#x27;s death on 10 June 323 BC. A succession crisis ensued. Arrhidaeus was the most obvious candidate, but he was mentally disabled and thus unfit to rule. A conflict then arose between Perdiccas, leader of the cavalry, and Meleager, who commanded the phalanx: the first wanted to wait to see if Roxana, Alexander&#x27;s pregnant wife, would deliver a son while Meleager objected that Arrhidaeus should be chosen king. A compromise was engineered in which Arrhidaeus would become king with the name of Philip III, and would be joined by Roxana&#x27;s yet-unborn child as co-sovereign should that child prove to be a male. This eventuality did indeed arise and resulted in Roxana&#x27;s son, Alexander, becoming with his uncle Phillip co-sovereign on the throne of Macedon. It was immediately decided that Philip Arrhidaeus would reign, but not rule: this was to be the prerogative of the new regent, Perdiccas.

When news arrived in Macedonia that Arrhidaeus had been chosen as king, Cynane, a daughter of Philip II, developed a plan to travel to Asia and offer the new king her daughter Eurydice for his wife. This move was an obvious affront to the regent, whom Cynane had completely bypassed, and to prevent the marriage, Perdiccas sent his brother, Alcetas, to kill Cynane. The reaction among the troops generated by this murder was such that the regent had to give up his opposition to the proposed match and accept the marriage. From that moment on, Philip Arrhidaeus was to be under the sway of his bride, a proud and determined woman bent on substantiating her husband&#x27;s power.

===Regents===

Eurydice&#x27;s chance to increase her husband&#x27;s power came when the first war of the Diadochi sealed the fate of Perdiccas, making a new settlement necessary. An agreement was made at Triparadisus in Syria in 321 BC. Eurydice moved deftly enough to achieve the removal of the first two designated regents, Peithon and Arrhidaeus (a namesake of her husband), but was powerless to block the aspirations of Antipater, whose position proved too powerful, and the latter was made the new regent; Philip Arrhidaeus and Eurydice were forced to follow Antipater back to Macedonia.

The regent died of natural causes the following year, nominating as his successor not his son Cassander, but his friend and lieutenant, Polyperchon. Cassander&#x27;s refusal to accept his father&#x27;s decision sparked the Second War of the Diadochi, in which Eurydice saw once again a chance to free Philip from the control of the regent.

An opportunity presented itself in 317 BC when Cassander expelled Polyperchon from Macedonia. Eurydice immediately allied herself with Cassander and persuaded her husband to nominate him as the new regent. Cassander reciprocated by leaving her in full control of the country when he left to campaign in Greece.

===Death===
That same year (317 BC), Polyperchon and Olympias allied with her cousin, Aeacides, king of Epirus, and invaded Macedonia. The Macedonian troops refused to fight Olympias, the mother of Alexander. Philip and Eurydice had no choice but to escape, only to be captured at Amphipolis and thrown into prison.

It soon became clear that Philip was too dangerous to be left alive, as Olympias&#x27;s many enemies saw him as a useful tool against her. She had him executed, while his wife was forced to commit suicide.

==Tomb==
In 1977, excavations near Vergina in northern Greece led to the unearthing of three Macedonian tombs. Tomb II is a two-chambered royal tomb richly decorated with grave goods such as silver vessels, bronze weaponry and bath equipment, and a gold-and-ivory shield. The outer chamber of the tomb contained a golden box with the bones of a woman in her twenties, and the inner chamber contained a gold box with a golden crown and the bones of a man in his forties.

Professor Manolis Andronikos, the chief archaeologist at the site, along with a number of other archaeologists, decided that Tomb II contained the remains of Philip II and his final wife Cleopatra Eurydice due to the rich decoration of the tomb, the age of the skeletal remains, the damage on the male skeleton&#x27;s right eye socket, and his thigh bone that had suffered trauma. Philip lost his right eye in battle and had been wounded in one leg. However, as the right eye socket was almost entirely missing, the damage could not be specified, and the wound was to the wrong leg. Athenian pottery found in the tomb dates between the last quarter of the fourth century to the early third century BC, while Philip II died in 336 BC. Architectural evidence regarding the vaulted roof and its similarity to Lycian tombs points to a later date, after Alexander the Great&#x27;s invasion of Asia.

Due to forensic studies in 2015, it is now believed that Philip II was buried in Tomb I. As such, others have proposed Tomb II to contain the remains of Philip Arrhidaeus and his wife Eurydice, due to the time of their death in 317 BC and that Arrhidaeus was known to have received honors at burial.

In Tomb II, greaves that many archaeologists had argued belong to Philip II could also belong to Eurydice or Alexander the Great, according to Antonios Bartsiokas. Bartsiokas, one of the lead authors in the 2015 study identifying Philip as the occupant of Tomb I, explained that Eurydice was a warrior who fought in many battles and could have required greaves. It is also possible that some of Alexander the Great&#x27;s armor could have been buried at the tomb, as Arrhideaus wore Alexander&#x27;s garments when he ascended to the throne in 323 BC, although he did not fight in battles himself. A hand-hammered iron helmet found in Tomb II matches Plutarch&#x27;s description of Alexander&#x27;s helmet.

==Arrhidaeus in fiction==
He appears as one of the main characters in the novel &quot;Funeral Games&quot; by Mary Renault. In Renault&#x27;s version, the villainous Cassander slows down his advance on Macedonia to give Olympias enough time to kill Arrhidaeus and Eurydice.

Arrhidaeus is also a main character in Annabel Lyon&#x27;s novel &quot;The Golden Mean&quot;. In it, the young Arrhidaeus is tutored by Aristotle while he also mentors his younger half-brother, the future Alexander the Great. Alexander, who is initially disgusted with his brother&#x27;s inferior intellect, learns to love him before he sets out to conquer the world.

In the Japanese fiction manga &quot;Historie&quot;, he was shown as an intellectually disabled child, who became happy when Eumenes made him a toy chariot and became sad when Alexander the Great destroyed his toy. Eumenes later replaced it with a new one, telling him to bury the chariot.

Arrhideaus is also portrayed in the Indian historical drama series &quot;Porus&quot;.

Phillip is a prominent character in the Eric Flint novel &quot;The Alexander Inheritance&quot; and its sequel &quot;The Macedonian Hazard.&quot; Phillip is portrayed as having an affectionate relationship with Eurydice that is marred by his inability to stand being touched. The appearance of a cruise ship of time travelers a few months after Alexander&#x27;s death changes history, and prevents Phillip and Eurydice&#x27;s deaths, although they spend a time as prisoners of Antigonus I Monophthalamus. He is portrayed as having a spectrum disorder, but a photographic memory and a talent for mental arithmetic. His condition improves after sessions from a therapist among the time travelers, along with medical marijuana and other drugs, and fathers a child with Eurydice in the second book.

<text>The Battle of Zama was fought in 202 BC in what is now Tunisia between a Roman army commanded by Scipio Africanus and a Carthaginian army commanded by Hannibal. The battle was part of the Second Punic War and resulted in such a severe defeat for the Carthaginians that they capitulated, while Hannibal was forced into exile. The Roman army of approximately 30,000 men was outnumbered by the Carthaginians who fielded either 40,000 or 50,000; the Romans were stronger in cavalry, but the Carthaginians had 80 war elephants.

At the outset of the Second Punic War, in 218 BC, a Carthaginian army led by Hannibal invaded mainland Italy, where it campaigned for the next 16 years. In 210 BC Scipio took command of the faltering Roman war effort in Iberia (modern Spain and Portugal) and cleared the peninsula of Carthaginians in five years. He returned to Rome and was appointed consul in 205 BC. The following year his army landed near the Carthaginian port of Utica. The Carthaginians and their Numidian allies were repeatedly beaten in battle and the Roman ally Masinissa became the leading Numidian ruler. Scipio and Carthage entered into peace negotiations, while Carthage recalled armies from Italy commanded by Hannibal and Mago Barca. The Roman Senate ratified a draft treaty, but when Hannibal arrived from Italy, Carthage repudiated it. Hannibal marched inland to confront the Romans and a battle quickly ensued. 

The fighting opened with a charge by the Carthaginian elephants. These were repulsed, some retreating through the Carthaginian cavalry on each wing and disorganising them. The Roman cavalry units on each wing took advantage to charge their counterparts, rout them and pursue them off the battlefield. The two armies&#x27; close-order infantry were each deployed in three lines. The first two lines engaged each other and after a hard-fought combat the Carthaginians were routed. The second Carthaginian line then fanatically assaulted the Roman first line, inflicting heavy losses and pushing it back. After the Romans committed their second line the Carthaginians were forced to withdraw. There was a pause, during which the Romans formed a single extended line, to match that of the Carthaginians. These two lines charged each other, according to the near-contemporary historian Polybius &quot;with the greatest fire and fury&quot;. The fight continued for some time, neither side gaining the advantage. The Roman cavalry then returned to the battlefield and charged the Carthaginian line in the rear, routing and destroying it. Carthage was left with no army with which to continue the war. The peace treaty dictated by Rome stripped Carthage of its overseas territories and some of its African ones. Thereafter, it was clear that Carthage was politically subordinate to Rome.
==Primary sources==
The main source for almost every aspect of the Punic Wars is the historian Polybius ( – ), a Greek sent to Rome in 167BC as a hostage. His works include a now largely lost manual on military tactics, but he is best known for &quot;The Histories&quot;, written sometime after 146BC. Polybius&#x27;s work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view. Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible interviewed participants, from both sides, in the events he wrote about.

The accuracy of Polybius&#x27;s account has been much debated over the past 150 years. Modern historians consider Polybius to have treated the relatives of Scipio Aemilianus, his patron and friend, unduly favourably but the consensus is to accept his account largely at face value and the details of the wars in modern sources are largely based on interpretations of Polybius&#x27;s account. The modern historian Andrew Curry sees Polybius as being &quot;fairly reliable&quot;; Craige Champion describes him as &quot;a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian&quot;. Much of Polybius&#x27;s account of the Second Punic War is missing, or only exists in fragmentary form.

The account of the Roman historian Livy, who relied heavily on Polybius, is used by modern historians where Polybius&#x27;s account is not extant. The classicist Adrian Goldsworthy says Livy&#x27;s &quot;reliability is often suspect&quot;, and the historian Philip Sabin refers to Livy&#x27;s &quot;military ignorance&quot;. Dexter Hoyos describes Livy&#x27;s account of Zama as &quot;bizarrely at odds with Polybius’ which he seems not to understand fully&quot;.

Other, later, ancient histories of the war exist, although often in fragmentary or summary form. Modern historians usually take into account the writings of Appian and Cassius Dio, two Greek authors writing during the Roman era; they are described by John Lazenby as &quot;clearly far inferior&quot; to Livy. Hoyos accuses Appian of bizarre invention in his account of Zama; Michael Taylor states that it is &quot;idiosyncratic&quot;. But some fragments of Polybius can be recovered from their texts. The Greek moralist Plutarch wrote several biographies of Roman commanders in his &quot;Parallel Lives&quot;. Other sources include coins, inscriptions, archaeological evidence and empirical evidence from reconstructions such as the trireme &quot;Olympias&quot;.

==Background==
The First Punic War was fought between the two main powers of the western Mediterranean in the 3rd century BC: Carthage and Rome. The war lasted for 23 years, from 264 to 241 BC, before the Carthaginians were defeated. It took place primarily on the Mediterranean island of Sicily, its surrounding waters and in North Africa.

Carthage expanded its territory in Iberia (modern Spain and Portugal) from 236 BC, in 226 BC agreeing the Ebro Treaty with Rome which established the Ebro River as the northern boundary of the Carthaginian sphere of influence. A little later Rome made a separate treaty of association with the city of Saguntum, well south of the Ebro. Hannibal, the de facto ruler of Carthaginian Iberia, led an army to Saguntum in 219 BC and besieged, captured and sacked it. Early the following year Rome declared war on Carthage, starting the Second Punic War.

Hannibal led a large Carthaginian army from Iberia, through Gaul, over the Alps and invaded mainland Italy in 218 BC. During the next three years Hannibal inflicted heavy defeats on the Romans at the battles of the Trebia, Lake Trasimene and Cannae. At the last of these alone, at least 67,500 Romans were killed or captured. The historian Toni Ñaco del Hoyo describes these as &quot;great military calamities&quot;, and Brian Carey writes that they brought Rome to the brink of collapse. Hannibal&#x27;s army campaigned in Italy for 14 years.

There was also extensive fighting in Iberia from 218 BC. In 210 BC Publius Cornelius Scipio arrived to take command of Roman forces in Iberia. During the following four years Scipio repeatedly defeated the Carthaginians, driving them out of Iberia in 206 BC. One of Carthage&#x27;s allies in Iberia was the Numidian prince Masinissa, who led a force of light cavalry in several battles.

==Roman preparations==

In 206 BC Scipio left Iberia and returned to Italy. There he was elected to the senior position of consul in early 205 BC, despite being aged 31 when the minimum age for the office was 42. Scipio was already anticipating an invasion of North Africa and while still in Iberia had been negotiating with the Numidian leaders Masinissa and Syphax. He failed to win over the latter, but made an ally of the former.

Opinion was divided in Roman political circles as to whether an invasion of North Africa was an excessive risk. Hannibal was still on Italian soil; there was the possibility of further Carthaginian invasions, shortly to be realised when Hannibal&#x27;s youngest brother Mago Barca landed in Liguria with an army from Iberia; the practical difficulties of an amphibious invasion and its logistical follow up were considerable; and when the Romans had invaded North Africa in 256 BC during the First Punic War they had been driven out with heavy losses, which had re-energised the Carthaginians. Eventually a compromise was agreed: Scipio was given Sicily as his consular province, which was the best location for the Romans to launch an invasion of the Carthaginian homeland from and then logistically support it, and permission to cross to Africa on his own judgement. However, Roman commitment was less than wholehearted; Scipio could not conscript troops for his consular army, as was usual, but only call for volunteers. 

In 216 BC the survivors of the Roman defeat at Cannae had been formed into two legions and sent to Sicily. They formed the core of the Roman expeditionary force. Modern historians estimate a combat strength of 25,000–30,000, of whom more than 90 per cent were infantry. With up to half of the complement of his legions being fresh volunteers, and with no fighting having taken place on Sicily for the past five years, Scipio instigated a rigorous training regime. This extended from drills by individual centuriesthe basic Roman army manoeuvre unit of 80 mento exercises by the full army. This lasted for approximately a year. At the same time Scipio assembled a vast quantity of food and materiel, merchant ships to transport it and his troops, and warships to escort the transports.

Also during 205 BC, 30 Roman ships under Scipio&#x27;s second-in-command, the legate Gaius Laelius, raided North Africa around Hippo Regius, gathering large quantities of loot and many captives. The Carthaginians initially believed this was the anticipated invasion by Scipio and his full invasion force; they hastily strengthened fortifications and raised troops. Reinforcements were sent to Mago in an attempt to distract the Romans in Italy. Meanwhile a succession war had broken out in Numidia between the Roman-supporting Masinissa and the Carthaginian-inclined Syphax. Laelius re-established contact with Masinissa during his raid. Masinissa expressed dismay regarding how long it was taking the Romans to complete their preparations and land in Africa.

==Opposing forces==
===Roman===

Most male Roman citizens were liable for military service and would serve as infantry; a better-off minority provided a cavalry component. Historically, when at war the Romans would raise two legions, each of 4,200 infantrythis could be increased to 5,000 in some circumstances, or, rarely, even more (6,200 being the largest number recorded)and 300 cavalry. Approximately 1,200 of the infantrypoorer or younger men unable to afford the armour and equipment of a standard legionaryserved as javelin-armed skirmishers known as ; they each carried several javelins, which would be thrown from a distance, a short sword and a shield. The balance were equipped as heavy infantry, with body armour, large shields and short thrusting swords. They were divided into three ranks, of which the in the front rank also carried two javelins each; the and , in the second and third ranks, respectively, had thrusting spears instead. A standard-size legion at full strength would have 1,200 &quot;velites&quot;, 1,200 , 1,200 , 600 and 300 &quot;equites&quot;.

Both legionary sub-units and individual legionaries fought in relatively open order. It was the long-standing Roman procedure to elect two men each year as senior magistrates, known as consuls, who in time of war would each lead an army. An army was usually formed by combining a Roman legion with a similarly sized and equipped legion provided by their Latin allies; allied legions usually had a larger attached complement of cavalry than Roman ones. By this stage of the war, Roman armies were generally larger, typically consisting of four legions, two Roman and two provided by its allies, for a total of approximately 20,000 men. The Roman army which invaded Africa consisted of four legions, each of the Roman pair reinforced to an unprecedented 6,200 infantry and with a more usual 300 cavalry each. Modern historians estimate the invading army to have totalled 25,000–30,000 men, including perhaps 2,500 cavalry. Goldsworthy describes the army as being &quot;superbly trained&quot; when it left Sicily.

===Carthaginian===

Carthaginian citizens served in their army only if there was a direct threat to the city of Carthage. When they did they fought as well-armoured heavy infantry armed with long thrusting spears, although they were notoriously ill-trained and ill-disciplined. In most circumstances Carthage recruited foreigners to make up its army. Many were from North Africa and these were frequently referred to as &quot;Libyans&quot;. The region provided several types of fighters, including: close-order infantry equipped with large shields, helmets, short swords and long thrusting spears; javelin-armed light infantry skirmishers; close-order shock cavalry (also known as &quot;heavy cavalry&quot;) carrying spears; and light cavalry skirmishers who threw javelins from a distance and avoided close combatthe latter were usually Numidians.)

The close-order African infantry and the citizen-militia both fought in a tightly packed formation known as a phalanx. On occasion some of the infantry would wear captured Roman armour, especially those who served with Hannibal. Both Iberia and Gaul provided experienced but unarmoured infantry who would charge ferociously, but had a reputation for breaking off if combat was protracted. Slingers were frequently recruited from the Balearic Islands. The Carthaginians also employed war elephants; North Africa had indigenous African forest elephants at the time. The sources are not clear as to whether they carried towers containing fighting men.

==Invasion==

In 204 BC, probably in June or July, the Roman army left Sicily and disembarked three days later at Cape Farina north of the large Carthaginian port of Utica. Carthaginian scouting parties were repulsed and the area was pillaged. Masinissa joined the Romans with either 200 or 2,000 men, the sources differ. Masinissa had been recently defeated by his Numidian rival Syphax, who had decided to act in support of Carthage. Wanting a more permanent base and a port more resilient to the bad weather to be expected when winter came, Scipio besieged Utica. Although the Romans were well supplied with siege engines the siege dragged on. A Carthaginian army under the experienced commander Hasdrubal Gisco and a Numidian one under Syphax set up separate fortified camps nearby. The size of both of these armies is uncertain, but it is accepted that the Romans were considerably outnumbered, especially in terms of cavalry. The Romans pulled back from Utica. Both sides were reluctant to commit to a pitched battle.

===Fighting in 203 BC===

Scipio sent emissaries to Syphax to attempt to persuade him to defect. Syphax in turn offered to broker peace terms. A series of exchanges of negotiating parties followed, during which Scipio obtained information on the layout and construction of the Numidian camp, as well as the size and composition of the Numidian army and the most frequented routes in and out of the camp. As the weather improved Scipio made conspicuous preparations to assault Utica. Instead, he marched his army out late one evening and divided it in two. One part launched a night attack on the Numidian camp, setting fire to their reed barracks. In the ensuing panic and confusion the Numidians were dispersed with heavy casualties. Not realising what was happening, the Carthaginians were also taken by surprise when Scipio attacked them with the remaining Romans. Again the Romans inflicted heavy casualties in the dark. Hasdrubal fled to Carthage with 2,500 survivors, pursued by Scipio. Syphax escaped with a few cavalry and regrouped away.

When word of the defeat reached Carthage there was panic, and some wanted to renew the peace negotiations. The Carthaginian Senate also heard demands for Hannibal&#x27;s army to be recalled. A decision was reached to fight on with locally available resources. A force of 4,000 Iberian warriors arrived in Carthage, and Hasdrubal raised further local troops with whom to reinforce the survivors of Utica; Syphax remained loyal and joined Hasdrubal with what was left of his army. The combined force is estimated at 30,000 and they established a strong camp in an area by the Bagradas River known as the Great Plains within 30–50 days of the defeat at Utica.

Scipio immediately marched most of his army to the scene. The size of his army is not known, but it was outnumbered by the Carthaginians. After several days of skirmishing both armies committed to a pitched battle. Upon being charged by the Romans and Masinissa&#x27;s Numidians, those Carthaginians who had been involved in the debacle at Utica turned and fled; morale had not recovered. Only the Iberians stood and fought. They were enveloped by the well-drilled Roman legions and wiped out. Hasdrubal fled to Carthage, where he was demoted and exiled.

Syphax withdrew as far as his capital, Cirta, where he recruited more troops to supplement those survivors who had stayed with him. Masinissa&#x27;s Numidians pursued their fleeing countrymen accompanied by part of the Roman force, under Laelius. The armies met in the battle of Cirta, where Syphax&#x27;s army initially gained the upper hand. Laelius fed groups of Roman infantry into the battle line and Syphax&#x27;s troops broke and fled. Syphax was captured and paraded beneath the city walls in chains, which caused Cirta to surrender to Masinissa, who then took over much of Syphax&#x27;s kingdom and joined it to his own.

==Hannibal&#x27;s return==

Scipio and Carthage entered into peace negotiations. Carthage built up its naval strength and prepared the city of Carthage for a siege. The Carthaginian Senate recalled both Hannibal and Mago from Italy. After Scipio overran all of Carthaginian Iberia in 205 BC, Mago had left with those forces still loyal and sailed to Liguria in northern Italy where he recruited Gallic and Ligurian reinforcements. In 203 BC Mago marched into Cisalpine Gaul in an attempt to draw Roman attention away from North Africa, but was defeated at the battle of Insubria. His army retreated and sailed for Carthage from Genua. Mago died of wounds on the voyage and some of his ships were intercepted by the Romans, but 12,000 of his troops reached Carthage.

By 207 BC, after 12 years of campaigning in Italy, Hannibal&#x27;s forces had been compelled to withdraw to Bruttium, the &quot;toe&quot; of Italy, where they remained undefeated but were ineffective. When recalled the limited number of ships available meant that few horses could be taken and that many newer recruits were left in Italy. Hannibal&#x27;s army sailed from Croton and landed at Leptis Minor, some south of Carthage, with 15,000–20,000 experienced veterans. Hannibal was appointed to command the new army and consolidated his forces at Hadrumetum.

===Prelude to battle===

The Roman Senate ratified a draft treaty, but because of mistrust and a surge in confidence when Hannibal arrived from Italy, Carthage repudiated it. The Romans retaliated by methodically capturing Carthaginian-controlled towns in Carthage&#x27;s hinterland and selling their inhabitants into slavery, regardless of whether they had surrendered before being attacked or not. Scipio probably anticipated that these attacks would create pressure on the Carthaginians to dispatch an army to face him as soon as possible, rather than wait until it had recruited to maximum strength and was fully trained. Scipio was himself under time pressure, as he was concerned that his political opponents in the Roman Senate might appoint a new consul to replace him. The Carthaginian Senate repeatedly ordered Hannibal to advance from his base at Hadrumetum and deal with Scipio&#x27;s army, but Hannibal delayed until he had been reinforced by 2,000 Numidian cavalry led by a relative of Syphaxthey were reputed to be elite troops.

Hannibal believed, correctly, that the Roman army had not yet been joined by its Numidian auxiliaries under Masinissa and so had the Carthaginian army march inland for five days and camp not far from the town of Zama, just from the Roman army. This proximity all but guaranteed that a battle would result. While the Carthaginians were en route Masinissa arrived at the Roman camp with 10,000 Numidians. The site of the battle is generally, but not universally, believed to be a flat area to the south of Sicca (modern El Kef), the Draa el Metnan.

==Battle==
===Numbers involved===
Little is known of the number of men Scipio commanded at Zama. An estimated 25,000–30,000 men had landed in Africa the year before and there is no record of any reinforcements arriving from Italy. However, the strength of the force left to guard their camp and continue the siege of Utica is not known, nor is the level of attrition suffered in the three major battles and several skirmishes the legions had so far been involved in. The ancient sources agree that the Romans were supported by 6,000 Numidian infantry and 4,000 cavalry under Masinissa. The ancient historian Appian, writing 350 years after the event, states that the Numidians brought the total to 34,500 troops, but modern historians do not accept this. They usually give a total of 29,000 or 30,000, although Nigel Bagnall gives 40,000. Of these, slightly more than 6,000 were cavalry.

Appian states that the Carthaginian army at the battle of Zama consisted of 50,000 men; this is discounted by many modern historians, although some accept it with provisos. Most give 40,000, based on Polybius. Of these, all but 4,000 were infantry. Hannibal&#x27;s army had abandoned its horses in Italy because of a lack of shipping space and Masinissa&#x27;s defeat of Syphax had dried up the supply of Numidian cavalry; thus, even with the recent addition of 2,000 Numidians the Carthaginians fielded only 4,000 cavalry. Hannibal also deployed 80 war elephants, the first time these are recorded as being used since Scipio invaded. Hannibal delayed seeking battle to give his army time to train up a force of elephants. Such forces had been fielded earlier in the war in both Italy and Iberia. Hannibal had famously taken elephants over the Alps in 218 BC. It is unclear why Carthage was not able to field a force of fully trained war elephants at Zama, or at any time since Scipio invaded.

===Initial dispositions===
The Roman army formed up with the heavy infantry of its two Roman legions in the centre and with allied legions on each side of them. As usual, the formed the front rank with the and then the behind them. Instead of organising each legion&#x27;s maniplesthe basic Roman infantry manoeuvre unit of 120 men eachin the usual &quot;checkerboard&quot; or formation, Scipio arranged a maniple directly behind each maniple of . This left broad avenues through the Roman lines, which were occupied by the Roman light infantry, the . Masinissa&#x27;s 4,000 Numidian cavalry were on the right of the infantry. Laelius led 1,500 Roman and allied cavalry positioned on the left. There were a further 600 Numidian cavalry under Dacamas, but it is not known whether they were attached to Masinissa&#x27;s or Laelius&#x27;s force. It is not stated in the ancient sources what role or roles the 6,000 Numidian infantry took up. Modern suggestions include operating in close support of their cavalry, guarding the Roman camp, supplementing the as skirmishers or forming up as close-order infantry to one side of the legions.

The Carthaginian deployment reflected the fact that Hannibal&#x27;s command was made up of the survivors of three different armies. Hannibal had not had time to integrate the forces he had been allocated into a unified command and so felt it wisest to deploy them separately. The Carthaginian infantry, like the Romans&#x27;, went in the centre. Its first line was made up largely of veterans of Mago&#x27;s failed expedition to northern Italy. The close-order troops were Iberians, Gauls and Ligurians. In front of these heavy infantry were light-infantry skirmishers consisting of Balearic slingers, Moor archers and Moor and Ligurian javelin-men. The total strength of this component was 12,000 men. In front of these infantry were the 80 war elephants, evenly spaced along the line, approximately apart. The modern historian José Lago states that the Carthaginian light infantry were sent out in front of the whole Carthaginian army, as was usual, including in front of the elephants, for the several hours it took the army to form up.

Carthaginians and other Africans made up the second line. They were either survivors of the earlier campaigns whose morale was poor or freshly raised recruits who had received little training. They probably fought as close-order infantry; Polybius describes them as adopting phalanx formations, but there is modern debate as to just what this describes. The strength of the second line is not known, but it is sometimes assumed by modern historians to have consisted of a further 12,000 men. About behind the Carthaginian second line were the infantry Hannibal had brought back from Italy. Most of them were Bruttians, but they included some Africans and Iberians who had left Iberia with Hannibal more than 17 years before, and Gauls recruited in northern Italy in 218 and 217 BC. All were battle-hardened veterans. This third line is variously estimated at 12,000, 15,000–20,000 or 20,000 men by modern historians. The Carthaginians are believed to have fielded approximately 4,000 cavalry. Hannibal placed the Numidians among them on his left flank, facing Masinissa&#x27;s Numidians; and the other African cavalry on the right. How many of the total of 4,000 cavalry were in each of these contingents is not known, although Lazenby suggests that the Numidians on the left would have been the stronger.

===Initial charges===
The armies advanced towards each other, the first clashes occurring on the Carthaginian left flank, the Roman right, between the 2,000 or more Carthaginian-supporting Numidian cavalry and the 4,000or possibly 4,600siding with the Romans. Each force sent detachments to hurl javelins at the other and then withdraw. Lazenby describes these skirmishes as &quot;desultory&quot;. Hannibal then ordered a charge against the Roman infantry by his 80 elephants, with the whole of his first two lines moving forward in support. The modern historian Jacob Edwards, in a study of Hannibal&#x27;s use of elephants during the war, describes their deployment at Zama as &quot;an ill-advised practice which departed from the successful tactics used previously&quot;. He suggests that they would have been better employed against the superior Roman cavalry on the flanks, rather than directly charging the Roman infantry. It is possible that Hannibal believed the elephants would have brought an element of surprise, as their previous use in the war had been limited. Most modern accounts have the elephants in front of the Carthaginian infantry, but Lago has the Carthaginian light infantry in front of the whole Carthaginian army, skirmishing with their opposite numbers, as was usual before armies were formed up and ready to commence the battle proper. Lago states that they stayed in front of and between the elephants, protecting them from the javelins of the Roman until the elephants charged.

As the elephants advanced, the moved forward into the gap between the armies, hurled javelins at the elephants, and fell back. The Roman heavy infantry then sounded their bugles, and possibly rhythmically banged their weapons against their shields – swashbuckling. This startled some of the elephants and several of those on the left turned and fled, past the end of the line of infantry behind them. Edwards expresses amazement that war elephants should be so easily panicked and again suggests that at least some of the animals were &quot;young and inexperienced at battle&quot; making them &quot;a liability rather than an asset&quot;. These out-of-control elephants trampled their way through the Carthaginian-backing Numidian cavalry, thoroughly disordering them. Masinissa took advantage of the situation by ordering a charge. This routed the disordered cavalry and they fled, pursued by Masinissa&#x27;s force.

Most of the rest of the elephants charged into the Roman infantry, amid showers of javelins. Terrified by the swashbuckling infantry and their bugles the majority stampeded into the broad gaps the Romans had left between their maniples. Many of the were killed as they ran back in front of the elephants and into the gaps between the ranks of the heavy infantry. From there they hurled javelins into the elephants&#x27; flanks. Those elephants, which emerged into the rear of the Roman army, were all wounded and now cut off. They were subsequently hunted down and killed. Some elephants did charge into the as planned, where they caused heavy casualties before being driven off. This causes Mir Bahmanyar to suggest that the elephants accomplished what Hannibal expected of them. Some elephants balked at charging the on the Roman left and attacked the cavalry alongside them, who also showered the elephants with javelins. Most of these elephants were badly wounded and had lost their crews by this point; those that could flee avoided the line of Carthaginian infantry, but not the Carthaginian cavalry on the right flank. This cavalry force became disorganised by the out-of-control elephants and like Masinissa, Laelius ordered his cavalry to take advantage of this and charge. The Carthaginian cavalry were swept from the field and the Roman cavalry closely pursued them.

===Infantry engagement===

With the battlefield cleared of both elephants and cavalry all three ranks of the Roman heavy infantry and the first two of Carthaginian advanced towards each other. The Carthaginian third rank, Hannibal&#x27;s Italian veterans, remained in place. The two front ranks charged enthusiastically and violently into each other and commenced a hard-fought, close-quarter, hand-to-hand combat. The Romans&#x27; superior weaponry and organisation eventually told and despite the taking further heavy losses, the Carthaginian front rank broke and fled. They attempted to make their way through the Carthaginian second rank, but these men refused to let them pass; according to Polybius to the point of fighting them off. The survivors of the front rank were forced to make their escape around the flanks of the second rank. Many of these then rallied and rejoined the fight by extending the flanks of the Carthaginian second rank.

The , despite having taken casualties from the elephants and the Carthaginian first rank, now attacked the Carthaginian second rank. Polybius reports that the Carthaginian and other African spearmen who made up this force fought &quot;fanatically and in an extraordinary manner&quot;. The Romans were pushed back in disorder. Bahmanyar opines that the Roman front rank came close to being broken at this stage. The Romans were forced to commit their second line, the , to the fight. Liddell Hart writes that even the struggled to hold the line, but eventually this reinforcement was sufficient to break the Carthaginian second line; they fled, pursued impetuously by the .

Both Bahmanyar and Goldsworthy suggest this was an opportunity for the Carthaginian third line to counter-attack the disorganised , but that Hannibal decided against it because his third line was some distance back, the fleeing Carthaginians from the first two lines were inadvertently blocking a clean charge and because the ground over which the third line would have attacked was strewn with corpses. According to Polybius the gap between the fighting lines &quot;was now covered with blood, slaughter, and dead bodies ... slippery corpses which were still soaked in blood and had fallen in heaps&quot;. Bagnall suggests the withdrawal of the Carthaginian second line was more deliberate and orderly than the ancient sources portray. Taylor believes that Hannibal had hoped that the Romans would rush forward in pursuit at this stage and that he had prepared an infantry envelopment in anticipation of this. In the event, Scipio saw the potential trap and his troops were disciplined enough to break off their pursuit when recalled.

===Decision===
The Romans recalled the pursuing by sounding bugles and reformed their line. The Carthaginian third lineHannibal&#x27;s veterans supplemented by some of the survivors of the first and second lineswas longer than the Roman formation and outflanked it on both sides. The formed up in the centre and the and moved to each side to make a single, longer line. There was a prolonged pause while this was taking place. The Carthaginians took advantage of the hiatus to rally some of their first and second line troops, using them to extend the length of their own fighting line. This enabled Roman close-order infantry to match the length of the Carthaginian&#x27;s third line, but correspondingly thinned their line, preventing them from using their habitual tactic of feeding new, less-fatigued men into the fighting line as a combat wore on. The surviving heavy infantry of each side were roughly equal in numbers. Most of the original Carthaginian were equipped in the same manner as the Romans they faced. They were veterans of many years&#x27; experience and they were fresh, having not yet fought. Many of the Romans were veterans, some having fought at Cannae and almost all having taken part in the two, or for some three, major victories the previous year. Many of the Romans were tired from the two immediately preceding fierce combats, but their victories in both would have boosted their morale.

Having satisfactorily reorganised, the two lines charged each other, according to Polybius &quot;with the greatest fire and fury&quot;. The fight continued for some time, neither side gaining the advantage. Lazenby describes this fighting as &quot;a grim business&quot;. The cavalry commanded by Masinissa and Laelius then returned to the battlefield, apparently at more or less the same time. Philip Sabin states that they arrived &quot;in the nick of time&quot;. Being fiercely engaged to their front, the Carthaginian infantry were helpless to prevent the Roman cavalry from charging into their rear. Their line collapsed and there was a great massacre. Hannibal was one of the few Carthaginians to escape.

===Casualties===

Polybius states that 20,000 Carthaginians were killed and as many again taken prisoner, which accounts for the entire Carthaginian army. He gives Roman losses as 1,500 killed. This is five per cent or more of their total force; Goldsworthy considers this fatality rate &quot;a substantial loss for a victorious army, testimony to the hard fighting&quot; and that the battle as a whole was &quot;a slogging match&quot;. The number of wounded is not known, although the ancient sources refer to many wounded Roman soldiers being carried to the rear during the pause before the final engagement. At least 11 Carthaginian elephants survived the battle to be captured by the Romans. 

Hannibal and his companions reached the main Carthaginian base at Hadrumetum, where they mustered 6,000 infantry and 500 cavalry. Hannibal considered this too few with which to continue the war and advised the Carthaginian Senate to make peace on whatever terms they could.

==Aftermath==
The Romans looted the Carthaginian camp and Scipio marched his legions back to Tunis. The Carthaginians again sued for peace. Given the difficulty of ending the war by storming or starving the city of Carthage, and his continuing fear that he might be superseded in command, Scipio entered into negotiations. During these Scipio received word that a Numidian army under Syphax&#x27;s son Vermina was marching to Carthage&#x27;s assistance. This was intercepted and surrounded by a Roman force largely made up of cavalry and defeated. The number of Numidians involved is not known, but Livy records that more than 16,000 were killed or captured. This was the last battle of the Second Punic War.

The peace treaty the Romans subsequently imposed on the Carthaginians stripped them of their overseas territories and some of their African ones. An indemnity of 10,000 silver talents was to be paid over 50 years, hostages were taken, Carthage was forbidden to possess war elephants and its fleet was restricted to 10 warships. It was prohibited from waging war outside Africa and in Africa only with Rome&#x27;s express permission. Many senior Carthaginians wanted to reject it, but Hannibal spoke strongly in its favour and it was accepted in spring 201BC. Henceforth it was clear Carthage was politically subordinate to Rome. Scipio was awarded a triumph and received the &quot;Africanus&quot;.

===Third Punic War===
Masinissa exploited the prohibition on Carthage waging war to repeatedly raid and seize Carthaginian territory with impunity. Carthage appealed to Rome, which always backed its Numidian ally. In 149 BC, fifty years after the end of the Second Punic War, Carthage sent an army, under Hasdrubal the Boetharch, against Masinissa, the treaty notwithstanding. The campaign ended in disaster at the Battle of Oroscopa and anti-Carthaginian factions in Rome used the illicit military action as a pretext to prepare a punitive expedition. The Third Punic War began later in 149 BC when a large Roman army landed in North Africa and besieged Carthage. In the spring of 146 BC the Romans launched their final assault, systematically destroying the city and killing its inhabitants; 50,000 survivors were sold into slavery. The formerly Carthaginian territories were annexed by Rome and reconstituted to become the Roman province of Africa, with Utica as its capital.

<text>Callisthenes of Olynthus (; Greek: Καλλισθένης; 360 – 327 BCE) was a Greek historian in Macedon with connections to both Aristotle and Alexander the Great. He accompanied Alexander the Great during his Asiatic expedition and served as his historian and publicist. He later opposed Alexander’s adoption of Persian culture and was arrested after being implicated in a plot on the king&#x27;s life; he died in prison. During his life, he authored several works on Greek history and a biography of Alexander the Great.

==Early life==

Callisthenes was born in Olynthus sometime during 360 BCE. Little is known of his early childhood except that his mother Hero was the niece of Aristotle, and daughter of Proxenus of Atarneus and Arimneste; which made Callisthenes the great-nephew of Aristotle by his sister Arimneste, Callisthenes&#x27;s grandmother. It is also known that Callisthenes was in the care of Aristotle by 347 BCE and studied under him as his student. Callisthenes spent much of his early life writing and traveling with Aristotle. His first literary work was an encomium to Hermias of Atarneus, but by 334 BC, he had written a few works including a series on Greek history and antiquarian writings, such as a registry of competitors for the Pythian Games for which Aristotle and Callisthenes are thanked. Based on the fact that a reference by Diodorus Siculus mentions Callisthenes’ historical accounts of Greek history, it can be assumed that Callisthenes was a historian of some repute before he began working with Alexander the Great. Callisthenes first met Alexander the Great, when Alexander began being tutored by Aristotle around the age of thirteen. Aristotle had been tasked by Philip II of Macedon to tutor the young Alexander in Mytilene. While both studying under Aristotle, Callisthenes and Alexander would have come to know each other as fellow students and pupils of Aristotle.

== Campaign with Alexander the Great ==
Around 334 BCE, Callisthenes was invited to accompany Alexander the Great in his Asiatic expedition. There were many factors as to why Callisthenes chose to accompany Alexander. First, being that he had already established a relationship with Alexander during their time as students of Aristotle and as a historian and antiquarian might have appreciated a chance at traveling. Another potential reason is that Callisthenes’ birthplace of Olynthus was destroyed by Phillip II of Macedon, and such might have been looking to better himself in the eyes of Alexander and thus Phillip II’s court, in order to aid in its reconstruction.

During this expedition, Callisthenes was tasked with being the official historian for the campaign. While he occupied this role, he compiled his narrative on the events that transpired during the campaign. Much of the work is dedicated to praising Alexander and upholding his authority as the king and his army penetrated further into Asia. While much of his time during the campaign was spent working on his account of the expedition. But, Callisthenes was also sent on scientific expeditions, to places such as Kush or Babylon. Callisthenes had an affinity for the natural sciences and is known to have written several scientific works, including astronomical diaries and his own theories for the source of the Nile River. Although these theories later received pushback from Alexander the Great.

== Opposition to Alexander the Great ==
The dramatic conflict between Alexander the Great and Callisthenes was a result of years of tensions between many of Alexander’s court members, including Callisthenes that came to a head. Throughout Alexander’s campaign, he acquired an interest in taking on Persian customs and aristocrats. By 328 BCE, Alexander had allowed a handful of Persian aristocrats to join his entourage, a choice that deeply upset the Macedonians who were close to Alexander. That same year a confrontation occurred between Alexander and Cleitus the Black an officer in Alexander’s army. During a banquet Cleitus expressed his displeasure at the current state of Alexander’s contingent. An argument broke out between the two, ending in a physical confrontation and Cleitus’ demise at Alexander’s hand. After this conflict Alexander was distraught and brought on his trusted friends, one of which being Callisthenes to provide counsel to the king after he killed Cleitus.

By the next year Alexander’s fascination with Persian culture had only grown and in 327 BCE, he attempted to introduce the Persian servile ceremony of proskynesis. Callisthenes was sharply critical of Alexander’s new Persian practices. During a banquet held shortly before Alexander’s expedition left for India, Callisthenes gave a speech arguing against the adoption of proskynesis. Callisthenes argued that Alexander was not entitled to receive divine honors, such as the proskynesis from his followers. Alexander witnessed this speech and knowing Callisthenes was correct chose not to continue with the practice.

Another account by Plutarch claims that during this banquet Alexander offers a cup to a colleague who performs the proskynesis ceremony, kisses Alexander, and then drinks from the cup. While all of the other members of the court performed the ceremony Callisthenes blatantly refused to act out the proskynesis. This direct opposition to Alexander won Callisthenes favor by the Macedonians but severely destroyed the relationship between Callisthenes and Alexander. Callisthenes eventually left the king’s court as he had lost favor with Alexander. After Callisthenes fall from grace, he became increasingly politically isolated from the remaining members of Alexander’s court. Alexander continued to introduce more Persian recruits, further displeasing the remaining Macedonians in his court.

==Death==
During an incident during a royal boar hunt in which Hermolaus of Macedon, one of Alexander’s royal pages and Callisthenes former pupil, broke royal protocol and assisted Alexander in killing the boar. For this Hermolaus was publicly humiliated by flogging as well as the removing of his horse. This led Hermolaus and several other royal pages to create a conspiracy to assassinate Alexander. Yet, the conspiracy was discovered, and the young nobles faced arrest, torture and interrogation.

While under torture, Hermolaus implicated Callisthenes as a part of the plot against Alexander. Because of Callisthenes’ previous opposition to Alexander, as well as his previous role as Hermolaus’s instructor, Alexander found Callisthenes guilty of treason and ordered his subsequent arrest. Callisthenes was subsequently thrown into prison where he died seven months later. There are several different accounts of how he died or was executed. Crucifixion is the method suggested by Ptolemy, but Chares of Mytilene and Aristobulus of Cassandreia both claim that Callisthenes died of natural causes while in prison.

Callisthenes&#x27;s death was commemorated in a special treatise (&quot;Callisthenes or a Treatise on Grief&quot;) by his friend Theophrastus, whose acquaintance he made during a visit to Athens. In this eulogy Theophrastus condemns Alexander for the torture and execution of Callisthenes. He also references the acts of mourning and grief enacted by those who were close to Callisthenes and advises the bereaved on how to cope with the loss. Theophrastus also upholds Callisthenes as a figure of traditional piety and civic freedom.

==Writings==
Callisthenes&#x27; most well-known work was an account of Alexander&#x27;s expedition up to the time of Callisthenes’ own execution. &quot;Deeds of Alexander&quot; or &quot;Praxeis Alexandrou&quot; (330 BCE) was biographical-style series of works detailing the campaign of Alexander the Great. Although copies of the work do not survive today, some knowledge of it can be inferred from references by other authors. The book was intended as propaganda and glorified Alexander the Great’s military achievements and claims to divinity as the son of Zeus. According to Polybius, much of Callisthenes&#x27; military accounts were over-glorified to the point of impossibility. Polybius claims that Callisthenes’ descriptions of Alexander’s military are impossible and would not fit in the locations, such as the country outside of Cilicia, that Callisthenes describes. It contained many references to Homer’s &quot;Iliad&quot; and also described locations in the &quot;Iliad&quot; that Alexander had visited. It applauded Alexander as a standard for Greek masculinity; and condemned the Persians as weak and effeminate. It is said to have been used as justification for the Panhellenic crusade and as a means of recruiting potential supporters for Alexander’s crusade.

In addition to his work on Alexander the Great, he also authored another major work, a 10 book long historical anthology of Greece. &quot;Hellenica&quot; covered the periods from the Peace of Antalcidas (387 BCE) to the start of the Phocian war (357 BCE). His other works include; the list of winners from the Pythian games that he co-authored with Aristotle, writings on astronomy including a description of the Great Comet of 371 BC, a work covering the first Sacred war of 600 BCE titled &quot;On the Sacred War&quot;, a tribute &quot;Hermias&quot; to Atarneaus and Assos who were killed by Persians, a book on witty sayings, a &quot;Diakosmos Battle Order&quot; which covers ships in Homers &quot;Iliad,&quot; and a Periplus covering the Black Sea.

=== Pseudo-Callisthenes ===
Additionally, many works have been ascribed to Callisthenes mistakenly, resulting in their authorship commonly known as Pseudo-Callisthenes. One of the more well-known examples is the Alexander Romance, the basis of all the Alexander legends of the Middle Ages. It originated during the time of the Ptolemies, but in its present form belongs to the 3rd century CE. The Latin translation for the text is usually attributed to Julius Valerius Alexander Polemius (early 4th century). The work has also been said to be authored by several other people beyond Callisthenes, including; Aesopus, Aristotle, Antisthenes, Onesicritus, and Arrian. There are also Syrian, Armenian, and Slavonic versions, in addition to four Greek versions (two in prose and two in verse) in the Middle Ages (see Krumbacher, &quot;Geschichte der byzantinischen Literatur&quot;, 1897, p. 849). Valerius&#x27;s translation was completely superseded by that of Leo, archpriest of Naples in the 10th century, the so-called &quot;Historia de Preliis&quot;.

In addition to the &quot;Alexander Romance&quot;, Pseudo-Callisthenes is also credited with several other works. Including; a work titled &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, a work on Macedonian history, a &quot;History of Thrace&quot;, and treatise on the subject of hunting. There has also been a collection of letters, written in Greek originally attributed to Callisthenes, yet later disputed as the dates of the letters range far beyond the time period that Callisthenes was alive. Many of these were originally attributed to Callisthenes due to their assumed time period aligning with Callisthenes’s active years as an author, as well as their subject matter being on topics Callisthenes was known to have written about. As of now, there are no intact copies of Callisthenes’s works known to have survived.

<text>Flare is a science fiction novel by American writers Roger Zelazny and Thomas Thurston Thomas, published in 1992.

&quot;Flare&quot; describes the world as it may be in 2081, and the effects a future inter-planetary civilization would suffer if a solar flare occurred after almost 100 years without any solar activity.

The book takes a scientific approach to the idea, including almost no tangible story line. It is broken into short segments which describe different people in various places suffering from the effects of the solar flare.

<text>John Earle (c. 160117 November 1665) was an English cleric, author and translator, who was chaplain to Charles II. Towards the end of his life he was Bishop of Worcester and then Salisbury.

==Life==

He was born at York, but the exact date is unknown. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, but moved to Merton, where he obtained a fellowship. In 1631 he was proctor and also chaplain to Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke, then chancellor of the university, which led in 1639 to incumbency of the rectory of Bishopston in Wiltshire.

His fame spread, and in 1641 he was appointed chaplain and tutor to the future Charles II of England. In 1643 he was elected one of the Westminster Assembly, but his sympathies with Charles I of England and with the Anglican Communion were so strong that he declined to sit. Early in 1643 he was chosen chancellor of Salisbury Cathedral, but he was soon deprived of this position as a &quot;malignant.&quot; After the final Royalist defeat at the Battle of Worcester, Earle went abroad, and was made Clerk of the Closet (1651–1664) and chaplain to his former student Charles II.

He spent a year at Antwerp in the house of Izaak Walton&#x27;s friend, George Morley. He then joined the Duke of York (the future James II) in Paris, returning to England at the Restoration. He was appointed dean of Westminster, and in 1661 was one of the commissioners for revising the liturgy. He was on friendly terms with Richard Baxter. In November 1662 he was consecrated Bishop of Worcester, and was translated, ten months later, to the see of Salisbury, where he conciliated the nonconformists. He was strongly opposed to the Conventicle Act and Five Mile Act. During the Great Plague of London in 16651666, Earle attended to Charles II and his Queen consort Catherine of Braganza at Oxford, and there he died.

Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, in his &quot;Life&quot;, wrote &quot;Dr Earle was a man of great piety and devotion, a most eloquent and powerful preacher, and of a conversation so pleasant and delightful, so very innocent, and so very facetious, that no man’s company was more desired and loved. No man was more negligent in his dress and habit and mien, no man more wary and cultivated in his behaviour and discourse. He was very dear to the Lord Falkland, with whom he spent as much time as he could make his own.&quot;

==Works==

Earle&#x27;s chief title to remembrance is his witty and humorous work, &quot;Microcosmographie&quot;, or a &quot;Peece of the World discovered, in Essayes and Characters&quot;, which throws light on the manners of the time. First published anonymously in 1628, it became very popular, and ran through ten editions in the lifetime of the author. The style is quaint and epigrammatic: &quot;A university dunner is a gentlemen follower cheaply purchased, for his own money has hyr&#x27;d him.&quot; Several reprints of the book have been issued since the author&#x27;s death; and in 1671 a French translation by James Dymocke appeared with the title of &quot;Le Vice ridicule&quot;.

Earle was employed by Charles II to make the Latin translation of the &quot;Eikon Basilike&quot;, published in 1649. A similar translation of Richard Hooker&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical Polity&quot; was accidentally destroyed.

<doc id="164304" wikidata="Q4426799" url="?curid=164304" title="Creatures of Light and Darkness">
<text>Creatures of Light and Darkness is a 1969 science fiction novel by American writer Roger Zelazny. Long out of print, it was reissued in April 2010. The novel is set in the far future, with humans on many worlds. Some have god-like powers, or perhaps are gods—the names and aspects of various Egyptian gods are used. Elements of horror and technology are mixed, and it has points in common with cyberpunk.

&quot;Creatures of Light and Darkness&quot; was originally conceived and written as nothing more than a writing exercise in perspective by Roger Zelazny. He wrote it in present tense, constructed an entire chapter in poetry, and made the concluding chapter into the script of a play. He never intended it to be published, but when Samuel R. Delany heard about it from Zelazny, Delany convinced a Doubleday editor to demand that Zelazny give him the manuscript. Consequently, Zelazny dedicated the novel to Delany.

Unlike other books by Zelazny, such as &quot;Lord of Light &quot;or the series &quot;The Chronicles of Amber&quot;, this novel is more poetic in style, and contains less straightforward action. However, like other novels, Zelazny incorporates ancient myth, in this case from Egyptian and some Greek myth, and weaves ultra-futuristic technology with fantasy elements.

==Plot summary==

=== Background ===

The Universe was once ruled by the god Thoth, who administered the different forces in the Universe to keep things in balance. In time, he delegated this administration to his &quot;Angels&quot; (other god-like beings), who were each in charge of different &quot;stations&quot;, or forces in the Universe. Such stations include the House of the Dead, the House of Life, and the House of Fire.

At some point, Thoth had awakened a dormant, malevolent force on a distant planet. This dark force, called &quot;The Thing That Cries In The Night&quot;, is so powerful and malevolent that it nearly obliterated Thoth&#x27;s wife and threatens to consume the galaxy. Thoth works to contain and destroy the creature, and in so doing, neglects his duties in maintaining the Universe. The Angels become rebellious and use the power vacuum to fight amongst themselves for dominance.

Thoth&#x27;s son Set, who through an anomaly in Time is also his father, fights the creature across a devastated planet. Just as Set is about to destroy the creature, he is attacked by the Angel Osiris, who unleashes the Hammer That Smashes Suns, a powerful weapon that nearly kills Set and the creature. Thoth&#x27;s brother, Typhon, who was helping Set in the battle, vanishes without a trace and is presumed dead. (Typhon appears as a black horse-shadow, without a horse to cast it. He contains within himself something called &quot;Skagganauk Abyss&quot;, which resembles a black hole, not a term in common use at the time.)

The Thing That Cries In The Night survived the blast, and so Thoth, who has meanwhile been utterly overthrown by his Angels, has no choice but to contain the dark force until he can find a way to destroy it. He also revives the personality of his wife and keeps her safe on a special world known only to him, where the seas are above the atmosphere, not below them. He also scatters Set&#x27;s weapons and armor across the Universe for safe-keeping in the event that Set can ever be found. Having been overthrown, he is now dubbed The Prince Who Was A Thousand by all in the Universe.

Some of the surviving Angels hide among the peoples of the Universe as mysterious &quot;immortals&quot;, but others—Osiris and Anubis—take over the House of Life and the House of Death, respectively. Other stations are abandoned, and Osiris and Anubis are the only two powers in the Universe now. Osiris cultivates life where he can, while Anubis works to destroy it. Plenty and famine, proliferation and plague, overpopulation and annihilation, alternate in the Worlds of Life between the two Stations, much to the detriment of those who inhabit them.

===Places===
The geography of this universe contains several curious places:
* The House of Life, ruled by Osiris, contains a room in which Osiris has reduced various people in his past into furnishings. These furnishings can speak (or scream) via wall-mounted speakers.
** A skull (with brain) for a paperweight.
** An enemy whose nervous system is woven into a rug. Osiris enjoys jumping on the rug.
*In the House of the Dead, numerous dead people of the Six Intelligent Races lie on invisible catafalques until Anubis requires them to go through the motions of pleasure—eating, drinking, dancing, making love—without any real enjoyment. Anubis likes to watch. He also stages fights between champions from the Six Races: sometimes the victor gets a job—and a name.
* The planet Blis is filled to bursting with people who are inexhaustibly fertile and do not know death: the whole planet is covered with 14 interlocking cities. Indeed, one man agrees to commit suicide in front of an audience, for money to be given to his family, because most people on Blis have never seen a death. He does so by self-immolation, after receiving the Possibly Proper Death Litany (also called the Agnostic&#x27;s Prayer). 
* On fog-shrouded D&#x27;donori, warlords raid each other solely to capture prisoners, who will be vivisected by the town scryer, or augur. By examining their entrails, he predicts the future and answers questions.
* On an unnamed planet, the sea is above the atmosphere. Here, the Prince Who Was a Thousand keeps Nephytha, his wife, who was disembodied and cannot survive on a normal planet.
* In a cave, a dog worries a glove that has seen better centuries. The three-headed canine is apparently Cerberus.
* On another planet, drug-maddened spearmen protect and castrated priests worship a pair of old shoes.

== The Agnostic&#x27;s Prayer ==

&quot;Insofar as I may be heard by anything, which may or may not care what I say, I ask, if it matters, that you be forgiven for anything you may have done or failed to do which requires forgiveness.&quot; 

&quot;Conversely, if not forgiveness but something else may be required to ensure any possible benefit for which you may be eligible after the destruction of your body, I ask that this, whatever it may be, be granted or withheld, as the case may be, in such a manner as to insure your receiving said benefit. I ask this in my capacity as your elected intermediary between yourself and that which may not be yourself, but which may have an interest in the matter of your receiving as much as it is possible for you to receive of this thing, and which may in some way be influenced by this ceremony.&quot; 

&quot;Amen.&quot;

This prayer, also called the Possibly Proper Death Litany, is uttered by one of the main characters, Madrak, to shrive a man about to commit suicide for money (given to his family).

The Agnostic&#x27;s Prayer is cited by Larry Niven in his short story &quot;What Can You Say About Chocolate-Covered Manhole Covers&quot;, where it is used as the sacrament in a formal divorce ceremony.

==Reception==
Algis Budrys gave &quot;Creatures of Light and Darkness&quot; an uneasily positive review, praising its &quot;rich, satisfactory detail and really moving human interplay,&quot; but warning that its unusual narrative technique &quot;will probably baffle and infuriate&quot; many readers. James Blish, however, found the novel &quot;a flat failure,&quot; even though &quot;Some parts are evocative in the authentic and unique Zelazny manner.&quot; He particularly faulted Zelazny&#x27;s decision to end &quot;Creatures&quot; as a scene from a play, but &quot;a scene which absolutely demands straightforward, standard narrative and for which the playscript is the worst possible choice.&quot;

==Publisher&#x27;s error==
At the time the novel was published, Doubleday did not remainder its unsold science fiction when its sales cycle was complete; instead, it simply destroyed the unsold copies. After &quot;Creatures of Life and Darkness&quot; was issued in paperback, Doubleday mishandled its inventory, causing most of the print run of Zelazny&#x27;s next novel, the just-published &quot;Nine Princes in Amber&quot;, to be destroyed in error.

<text>Stephanus or Stephen of Byzantium (; , &quot;Stéphanos Byzántios&quot;; centuryAD) was a Byzantine grammarian and the author of an important geographical dictionary entitled &quot;Ethnica&quot; (). Only meagre fragments of the dictionary survive, but the epitome is extant, compiled by one Hermolaus, not otherwise identified.

==Life==

Nothing is known about the life of Stephanus, except that he was a Greek grammarian who was active in Constantinople, and lived after the time of Arcadius and Honorius, and before that of Justinian II. Later writers provide no information about him, but they do note that the work was later reduced to an epitome by a certain Hermolaus, who dedicated his epitome to Justinian; whether the first or second emperor of that name is meant is disputed, but it seems probable that Stephanus flourished in Byzantium in the earlier part of the sixth century AD, under Justinian I.

==The &quot;Ethnica&quot;==
Stephanos&#x27; work, originally written in Greek, takes the form of an alphabetical dictionary or encyclopedia of geographical toponymns, ethnonymns etc. It is a vast work, with sometimes hundreds of list entries under each letter of the greek alphabet: Α–Ω. 

Even as an epitome, the &quot;Ethnica&quot; is of enormous value for geographical, mythological, and religious information about ancient Greece. Nearly every article in the epitome contains a reference to some ancient writer, as an authority for the name of the place. From the surviving fragments, we see that the original contained considerable quotations from ancient authors, besides many interesting particulars, topographical, historical, mythological, and others. Stephanus cites Artemidorus, Polybius, Aelius Herodianus, Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, Strabo and other writers. He is the only writer to cite a lost work attributed to Sophaenetus.

The chief fragments remaining of the original work are preserved by Constantine Porphyrogennetos in &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot;, ch. 23 (the article &quot;&quot;) and &quot;De thematibus&quot;, ii. 10 (an account of Sicily); the latter includes a passage from the comic poet Alexis on the &quot;Seven Largest Islands&quot;. Another respectable fragment, from the article &quot;Δύμη&quot; to the end of &quot;Δ&quot;, exists in a manuscript of the Fonds Coislin, the library formed by Pierre Séguier.

The first modern printed edition of the work was published by the Aldine Press in Venice in 1502. The complete standard edition is still that of August Meineke (1849, reprinted at Graz, 1958), and by convention, references to the text use Meineke&#x27;s page numbers. A new completely revised edition in German, edited by B. Wyss, C. Zubler, M. Billerbeck, J.F. Gaertner, was published between 2006 and 2017, with a total of 5 volumes.

<text>Squirtle (), known as in Japan, is a Pokémon species in Nintendo and Game Freak&#x27;s &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise. It was designed by Atsuko Nishida. Its name was changed from Zenigame to Squirtle during the English localization of the series in order to give it a &quot;clever and descriptive name.&quot; In animated appearances, Squirtle is voiced in Japanese by Rikako Aikawa and in English localizations by Eric Stuart, and later Michele Knotz.

In the main series games, Squirtle can evolve into Wartortle, and can then further evolve into Blastoise. It is one of the three first partner Pokémon obtainable in &quot;Pokémon Red, Blue, and Green&quot;, the first games in the series. Squirtle has received a mostly positive reception since its debut. A group of specific Squirtle, known as the Squirtle Squad, additionally developed a strong popularity as a result of their appearance in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime. Squirtle has gone on to make playable appearances in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; and &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;.

==Design and characteristics==
Squirtle is a species of fictional creatures called Pokémon created for the &quot;Pokémon&quot; media franchise. Developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo, the Japanese franchise began in 1996 with the video games &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; for the Game Boy, which were later released in North America as &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; in 1998. In these games and their sequels, the player assumes the role of a Trainer whose goal is to capture and use the creatures&#x27; special abilities to combat other Pokémon. Some Pokémon can transform into stronger species through a process called evolution via various means, such as exposure to specific items. Each Pokémon have one or two elemental types, which define its advantages and disadvantages when battling other Pokémon. A major goal in each game is to complete the Pokédex, a comprehensive Pokémon encyclopedia, by capturing, evolving, and trading with other Trainers to obtain individuals from all Pokémon species.

Squirtle was designed as one of the starter Pokémon of &quot;Pocket Monsters Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; by Atsuko Nishida, who based its design on its final form, a turtle-esque Pokémon called Blastoise. Squirtle, in the games, can evolve into Wartortle and then into Blastoise. Originally called &quot;Zenigame&quot; in Japanese, Nintendo decided to give the various Pokémon species &quot;cleverly descriptive names&quot; related to their appearance or features when translating the game for western audiences as a means to make the characters more relatable to American children. Squirtle&#x27;s English name is a portmanteau of the words &quot;squirt&quot; and &quot;turtle.&quot; The idea to feature Squirtle and the other &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; starters in a significant role in &quot;Pokémon X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; came about a year and a half into the development of the games. The Mega Evolutions for the three Pokémon&#x27;s final forms were created, and the designers decided that they should give players an opportunity to receive one of these Pokémon in order to see their Mega Evolved form. Eric Stuart and Michelle Knotz have voiced the character in English, while Rikako Aikawa, and Tomoe Hanba have voiced the character in Japanese.

==Appearances==
The first video game appearance of Squirtle was in &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;, alongside the other two starters Charmander and Bulbasaur. It since went on to appear in various games following this, such as &quot;Pokémon X and Y&quot;, &quot;Pokémon: Let&#x27;s Go, Pikachu! and Let&#x27;s Go, Eevee!&quot;, &quot;Pokémon Sword and Shield,&quot; and &quot;Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&quot;. Outside of the main series, Squirtle appears in a wide variety of spin-offs, such as &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot;, the &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot; series, the &quot;Pokémon Mystery Dungeon&quot; series, the &quot;Pokémon Rumble&quot; series, &quot;Pokémon Café Mix&quot;, &quot;Pokémon Masters EX&quot;, &quot;Pokémon Go&quot;, &quot;Pokkén Tournament&quot;, &quot;New Pokémon Snap&quot;, and &quot;Pokémon UNITE,&quot; among others. In &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot;, Squirtle is a playable character under the command of the Pokémon Trainer, alongside Ivysaur and Charizard which must be switched between in order to avoid fatiguing the Pokémon. Squirtle returns as a playable character in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; for the Nintendo Switch, once again playable with Ivysaur and Charizard.

In the animated series, Ash Ketchum, Brock, and Misty encounter a gang of five Squirtle known as the Squirtle Squad in his debut episode &quot;Here Comes the Squirtle Squad!&quot;. They first appear as delinquents, but their interactions with Ash and Co. result in them becoming honorary firefighters of their town. The squad&#x27;s leader eventually decides to join Ash and his friends journey throughout the Kanto region. Ash&#x27;s second female companion, May, also owned a Squirtle. Green, the original female protagonist in &quot;Pokémon Adventures&quot;, stole a Squirtle from Professor Oak&#x27;s laboratory. It was not seen until Chapter fifteen, &quot;Wartortle Wars&quot;, by which point it had evolved into a Wartortle, nicknamed Turtley, which she used as a major member of her team. Squirtle later appeared as background elements in the live action movie &quot;Detective Pikachu&quot;.

==Promotion and reception==
Squirtle has been featured in several forms of merchandise, including figurines, plush toys, and the &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot;. Squirtle was part of a special airplane livery. Squirtle was featured among other Pokémon as part of Burger King kids&#x27; meal cards. Analysts predicted that Squirtle, along with Pikachu, Bulbasaur, and Charmander, would lead the merchandising of the Pokémon series.
Squirtle was among eleven Pokémon chosen as Japan&#x27;s mascots in the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

Since it appeared in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; series, Squirtle has received generally positive reception. According to &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Squirtle was considered one of the &quot;more popular&quot; in the original series, while &quot;IGN&quot; ranked it the 46th best Pokémon ever, noting that it was &quot;instantly recognisable.&quot;&quot; GamesRadar&quot; editor Brett Elston noted that while Charizard and Bulbasaur get &quot;big props&quot; from &quot;Pokémon&quot; players, Squirtle appears to be &quot;more popular&quot; from people who are not fans of the series, suggesting that its appearance may be a part of it. &quot;ITmedia&quot; also ranked Squirtle as the fourth best first partner Pokémon, primarily due to its familiarity even with those not too closely associated with the franchise.

Ryan Gilliam of &quot;Polygon&quot; claimed that Squirtle was the best starter Pokémon, stating that &quot;Squirtle isn’t adorable or fierce like the Charmander line, it doesn’t breed eternal sympathy like Bulbasaur. Instead, Squirtle, Blastoise and even Wartortle are just cool dudes. They’re cool turtles that are just cool together.&quot; He highlighted its design in comparison to Bulbasaur and Charmander, praising its simplicity and personality. &quot;San Antonio Express-News&quot; editor Susan Yerkes called Squirtle &quot;disgustingly cute&quot;. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; editor Carolyn Gudmundson commented that Squirtle was the &quot;coolest&quot; of the three starting Pokémon in the anime, highlighting its association with the Squirtle Squad in the anime. 
&quot;Pocket Gamer&quot; listed and criticized Squirtle as the worst Pokémon ever, stating that Squirtle is &quot;just a turtle&quot;. It has been cited as more &quot;boring&quot; than other Pokémon due to its similarities to other Pokémon of the same type as it.

The Squirtle Squad characters have been described as fan favorites, and have acted as the subject of several &quot;Pokémon GO&quot; collaboration events. &quot;Vice&quot; writer Diana Tourjée described the initial episode featuring them as something that scared her as a child, citing that the Squirtle Squad initially appeared terrifying to her. Despite this, she highlighted in a retrospective that the Squirtle Squad&#x27;s story was a powerful one that resonated with many groups of people. She stated that the attempts of the local police to paint them as a gang showed an unfair prejudice against a group that did not deserve it, and how it built the family dynamic between the Squirtle Squad members. &quot;TheGamer&quot;&#x27;s Khee Hoon Chan cited similar sentiments, stating that despite their initially menacing appearance, the Squad had a powerful backstory and a strong popularity among fans.

Gabriel Boric Font received a Squirtle plush just prior to his Inauguration as President of Chile as a gift from Japan after he stated he was a fan of the series. During a collaboration event in &quot;Pokémon GO&quot; with singer Ed Sheeran, Squirtle was a major focus event, which was stated to be due to Squirtle being Sheeran&#x27;s favorite.

<doc id="164309" wikidata="Q125177944" url="?curid=164309" title="Snake (video game genre)">
<text>Snake is a genre of action video games where the player maneuvers the end of a growing line, often themed as a snake. The player must keep the snake from colliding with both other obstacles and itself, which gets harder as the snake lengthens.

The genre originated in the 1976 competitive arcade video game &quot;Blockade&quot; from Gremlin Industries where the goal is to survive longer than the other player. &quot;Blockade&quot; and the initial wave of clones that followed were purely abstract and did not use &quot;snake&quot; terminology. The concept evolved into a single-player variant where a line with a head and tail gets longer with each piece of food eaten—often apples or eggs—increasing the likelihood of self-collision. The simplicity and low technical requirements of snake games have resulted in hundreds of versions, some of which have the word &quot;snake&quot; or &quot;worm&quot; in the title. The 1982 &quot;Tron&quot; arcade video game, based on the film, includes snake gameplay for the single-player Light Cycles segment, and some later snake games borrow the theme.

After a version simply called &quot;Snake&quot; was preloaded on Nokia mobile phones in 1998, there was a resurgence of interest in snake games.

==Gameplay==
The original &quot;Blockade&quot; from 1976 and its many clones are two-player games. Viewed from a top-down perspective, each player controls a &quot;snake&quot; with a fixed starting position. The &quot;head&quot; of the snake continually moves forward, unable to stop, growing ever longer. It must be steered left, right, up, and down to avoid hitting walls and the body of either snake. The player who survives the longest wins. Single-player versions are less prevalent and have one or more snakes controlled by the computer, as in the light cycles segment of the 1982 &quot;Tron&quot; arcade game.

In the most common single-player game, the player&#x27;s snake is of a certain length, so when the head moves the tail does too. Each item eaten by the snake causes the snake to get longer. &quot;Snake Byte&quot; has the snake eating apples. &quot;Nibbler&quot; has the snake eating abstract objects in a maze.

==History==

The Snake genre began with the 1976 arcade video game &quot;Blockade&quot; developed and published by Gremlin Industries. It was cloned as &quot;Bigfoot Bonkers&quot; the same year. In 1977, Atari, Inc. released two &quot;Blockade&quot;-inspired titles: the arcade game &quot;Dominos&quot; and Atari VCS game &quot;Surround&quot;. &quot;Surround&quot; was one of the nine Atari VCS launch titles in the US and was sold by Sears under the name &quot;Chase&quot;. That same year, a similar game was launched for the Bally Astrocade as &quot;Checkmate&quot;. Mattel released &quot;Snafu&quot; for the Intellivision console in 1982.

The first known home computer version, &quot;Worm&quot;, was programmed by Peter Trefonas for the TRS-80 and published by &quot;CLOAD&quot; magazine in 1978. Versions followed from the same author for the PET and Apple II. An authorized version of the &quot;Hustle&quot; arcade game, itself a clone of &quot;Blockcade&quot;, was published by Milton Bradley for the TI-99/4A in 1980.

The single-player &quot;Snake Byte&quot; was published in 1982 for Atari 8-bit computers, Apple II, and VIC-20; a snake eats apples to complete a level, growing longer in the process. In &quot;Snake&quot; for the BBC Micro (1982), by Dave Bresnen, the snake is controlled using the left and right arrow keys relative to the direction it is heading in. The snake increases in speed as it gets longer, and there is only one life.

&quot;Nibbler&quot; (1982) is a single-player arcade game where the snake fits tightly into a maze, and the gameplay is faster than most snake designs. Another single-player version is part of the 1982 &quot;Tron&quot; arcade game, themed with light cycles. It reinvigorated the snake concept, and many subsequent games borrowed the light cycle theme.

Starting in 1991, &quot;Nibbles&quot; was included with MS-DOS for a period of time as a QBasic sample program. In 1992, &quot;Rattler Race&quot; was released as part of the second &quot;Microsoft Entertainment Pack&quot;. It adds enemy snakes to the familiar apple-eating gameplay.

==Legacy==
In 1996, &quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked it number 41 on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;, citing the need for both quick reactions and forethought. In lieu of a title for a specific version, they listed it as &quot;Snake game&quot; in quotes.

On November 29, 2012, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City announced that the Nokia port of Snake was one of 40 games that the curators wished to add to the museum&#x27;s collection in the future.

<doc id="164311" wikidata="Q188788" url="?curid=164311" title="Falafel">
<text>Falafel (; , ) is a deep-fried ball or patty-shaped fritter of Egyptian origin, featuring in Middle Eastern cuisine, particularly Levantine cuisines, and is made from broad beans, ground chickpeas, or both.

Falafel is often served in a flatbread such as pita, samoon, laffa, or taboon; &quot;falafel&quot; also frequently refers to a wrapped sandwich that is prepared in this way. The falafel balls may be topped with salads, pickled vegetables, and hot sauce, and drizzled with tahini-based sauces. Falafel balls may also be eaten alone as a snack or served as part of a meze tray (assortment of appetizers).

Falafel is eaten throughout the Middle East and is a common street food. Falafel is usually made with fava beans in Egypt, with chickpeas in Israel and Palestine, or either just chickpeas or a combination of both in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. The adoption of the Palestinian chickpea version of the falafel into Israeli cuisine and its identification as Israeli is contentious, and has led to accusations of cultural appropriation and gastronationalism.

==Etymology==

The word () is Arabic and is the plural of &#x27; () &#x27;pepper&#x27;, borrowed from Persian (), cognate with the Sanskrit word &#x27; () &#x27;long pepper&#x27;; or an earlier , from Aramaic &#x27;small round thing, peppercorn&#x27;, derived from &quot;palpēl&quot; &#x27;to be round, roll&#x27;.

The name is used world-wide. In English (where it has been written &quot;falafel&quot;, &quot;felafel&quot;, &quot;filafel&quot; and &quot;filafil&quot;), it is first attested in 1936.

Falafel is known as ( &#x27;, ) in Egypt and Sudan. The word is derived from a diminutive form of the Arabic word &#x27; (, &quot;food&quot;); the particular form indicates &quot;a unit&quot; of the given root in this case &quot;&quot; (, having to do with taste and food), thus meaning &quot;a little piece of food&quot; or &quot;small tasty thing&quot;.

The word &quot;falafel&quot; can refer to the fritters themselves or to sandwiches filled with them.

==History and distribution==

The origin of falafel is uncertain. The dish most likely originated in Egypt. It has been speculated that its history may go back to Pharaonic Egypt. However, the earliest written references to falafel from Egyptian sources date to the 19th century, and oil was probably too expensive to use for deep frying in ancient Egypt.

As Alexandria is a port city, it was possible to export the dish and its name to other areas in the Middle East. The dish later migrated northwards to the Levant, where chickpeas replaced the fava beans, and from there spread to other parts of the Middle East.

=== Middle East ===

Falafel is a common form of street food or fast food in Egypt, across the Levant, and in the wider Middle East. The croquettes are regularly eaten as part of meze. During Ramadan, falafel balls are sometimes eaten as part of the &quot;iftar&quot;, the meal that breaks the daily fast after sunset. Falafel became so popular that McDonald&#x27;s for a time served a &quot;McFalafel&quot; in its breakfast menu in Egypt.

Falafel is still popular in the Coptic diet, and as such large volumes are cooked during religious holidays. Falafel is consumed as part of the Lenten diet by Arab Christians.

The Palestinian chickpea version of the falafel has been adopted into Israeli cuisine, where it features prominently and has been called a national dish of Israel, which Palestinians and other Arabs have criticized and characterized as cultural appropriation. 

=== Europe ===
Waves of migration of Arabs and Turks took falafel through Europe to Germany in particular, where a large Turkish population had put down roots. At first it was a dish consumed principally by migrants. During the early 1970s, the appearance of Turkish food stalls and restaurants made falafel available to the Germans, resulting in a transformation of the recipe.

===North America===
In North America, prior to the 1970s, falafel was found only in Middle Eastern, Mediterranean and Jewish neighborhoods and restaurants. Today, the dish is a common and popular street food in many cities throughout North America.

===Vegetarianism===

Falafel is popular with vegetarians worldwide.

Falafel became popular among vegetarians and vegans as an alternative to meat-based street foods. While traditionally thought of as being used to make veggie burgers, its use has expanded as more have adopted it as a source of protein. Falafel is used as a meat substitute in some vegetarian recipes for meatloaf, sloppy joes and spaghetti and meatballs.

==Preparation and variations==

Falafel is made from fava beans or chickpeas, or a combination of both. Falafel is usually made with fava beans in Egyptian cuisine, where it most likely originated, with chickpeas in Palestinian cuisine, or just chickpeas or a combination of both in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria and the wider Middle East. This version is the most popular in the West.

When chickpeas are used, they are not cooked prior to use (cooking the chickpeas will cause the falafel to fall apart, requiring adding some flour to use as a binder). Instead they are soaked (sometimes with baking soda) overnight, then ground together with various ingredients such as parsley, scallions, and garlic. Spices such as cumin and coriander are often added to the beans for added flavor. The dried fava beans are soaked in water and then stone ground with leek, parsley, green coriander, cumin and dry coriander. The mixture is shaped into balls or patties. This can be done by hand or with a tool called an &quot;aleb falafel&quot; (falafel mould). The mixture is usually deep-fried, or it can be oven-baked.

Falafel is typically ball-shaped, but is sometimes made in other shapes. The inside of falafel may be green (from green herbs such as parsley or green onion), or tan. Sometimes sesame seeds are added on top of the falafel before frying it.
The pita falafel sandwich was popularized after Israel&#x27;s independence and in the 1950s by Jewish Yemeni immigrants. A 19 October 1939 &quot;The Palestine Post&quot; article is the first mention of the concept of falafels served in a pita bread as a street food. When served as a sandwich, falafel is often wrapped with flatbread or stuffed in a hollow pita bread, or it can be served with flat or unleavened bread. Tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers, and other garnishes can be added. Falafel is commonly accompanied by tahini sauce.
==Nutrition==
Homemade falafel is 35% water, 32% carbohydrates, 13% protein, and 18% fat (table). In a reference amount of , homemade falafel supplies 333 calories and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of folate (20% DV), several dietary minerals, and dietary fiber (table). Falafel can be baked to avoid the high fat content associated with frying in oil.

== Politico-cultural implications ==

Arguments over the relative importance of the dish in various cuisines is an example of gastronationalism. In particular, discussion centers around the adoption of the dish into Israeli cuisine as an example of cultural appropriation. The chickpea version of the falafel has been adopted into Israeli cuisine, where it now features prominently and has been called a national dish of Israel – an attribution that Palestinians and other Arabs have criticized.

While, according to author Claudia Roden, falafel was &quot;never specifically a Jewish dish&quot; in Syria and Egypt, it was consumed by Syrian and Egyptian Jews, and was adopted in the diet of early Jewish immigrants to the Jewish communities of Ottoman Syria. As it is plant-based, Jewish dietary laws classify it as pareve and thus allow it to be eaten with both meat and dairy meals.

Palestinian author Reem Kassis wrote that the term &quot;Israeli food&quot; (including falafel) has become a proxy for political conflict. Joseph Massad, a Jordanian-American professor at Columbia University, has characterized falafel and other Arab dishes description in American and European restaurants as Israeli to be part of a broader trend of &quot;colonial conquest&quot;.

Journalist Dorothy Kahn Bar-Adon wrote in 1941 that &quot;since the outbreak of war domestic science institutions have been advocating the use of local products&quot; but that there was a &quot;wall of resistance&quot;, and that many Eastern Europeans were reluctant to use local foods. Dafna Hirsch of the Open University of Israel, wrote that despite this initial reluctance, &quot;several ingredients from the Palestinian repertoire did penetrate many Jewish kitchens by the early 1940s, mostly vegetables like olives, tomatoes, eggplants, and squashes. Prepared dishes, however, were rarely adopted, except for falafel, which became a popular street food in Tel Aviv by the late 1930s. Excluding consumption by immigrants from Arab countries, both falafel and, later, hummus seem to have been adopted mainly by the first generation of Jews born in the country.&quot; Some authors have disagreed on the politics of food and its relative merit as a topic in the conflict.

The Association of Lebanese Industrialists in 2008 threatened a lawsuit against Israel seeking damages for lost revenues, claiming copyright infringement regarding the branding of Israeli falafel, hummus, tabbouleh, and other foods.

<text>In fluid dynamics, gravity waves are waves in a fluid medium or at the interface between two media when the force of gravity or buoyancy tries to restore equilibrium. An example of such an interface is that between the atmosphere and the ocean, which gives rise to wind waves.

A gravity wave results when fluid is displaced from a position of equilibrium. The restoration of the fluid to equilibrium will produce a movement of the fluid back and forth, called a wave orbit. Gravity waves on an air–sea interface of the ocean are called surface gravity waves (a type of surface wave), while gravity waves that are the body of the water (such as between parts of different densities) are called &quot;internal waves&quot;. Wind-generated waves on the water surface are examples of gravity waves, as are tsunamis, ocean tides, and the wakes of surface vessels.

The period of wind-generated gravity waves on the free surface of the Earth&#x27;s ponds, lakes, seas and oceans are predominantly between 0.3 and 30 seconds (corresponding to frequencies between 3 Hz and .03 Hz). Shorter waves are also affected by surface tension and are called &quot;gravity–capillary waves&quot; and (if hardly influenced by gravity) &quot;capillary waves&quot;. Alternatively, so-called &quot;infragravity waves&quot;, which are due to subharmonic nonlinear wave interaction with the wind waves, have periods longer than the accompanying wind-generated waves.

==Atmosphere dynamics on Earth==
In the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, gravity waves are a mechanism that produce the transfer of momentum from the troposphere to the stratosphere and mesosphere. Gravity waves are generated in the troposphere by frontal systems or by airflow over mountains. At first, waves propagate through the atmosphere without appreciable change in mean velocity. But as the waves reach more rarefied (thin) air at higher altitudes, their amplitude increases, and nonlinear effects cause the waves to break, transferring their momentum to the mean flow. This transfer of momentum is responsible for the forcing of the many large-scale dynamical features of the atmosphere. For example, this momentum transfer is partly responsible for the driving of the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation, and in the mesosphere, it is thought to be the major driving force of the Semi-Annual Oscillation. Thus, this process plays a key role in the dynamics of the middle atmosphere.

The effect of gravity waves in clouds can look like altostratus undulatus clouds, and are sometimes confused with them, but the formation mechanism is different. Atmospheric gravity waves reaching ionosphere are responsible for the generation of traveling ionospheric disturbances and could be observed by radars. 

==Quantitative description==
===Deep water===
The phase velocity formula_1 of a linear gravity wave with wavenumber formula_2 is given by the formula

formula_3

where &quot;g&quot; is the acceleration due to gravity. When surface tension is important, this is modified to

formula_4

where &quot;σ&quot; is the surface tension coefficient and &quot;ρ&quot; is the density.

The gravity wave represents a perturbation around a stationary state, in which there is no velocity. Thus, the perturbation introduced to the system is described by a velocity field of infinitesimally small amplitude, formula_5 Because the fluid is assumed incompressible, this velocity field has the streamfunction representation

:formula_6

where the subscripts indicate partial derivatives. In this derivation it suffices to work in two dimensions formula_7, where gravity points in the negative &quot;z&quot;-direction. Next, in an initially stationary incompressible fluid, there is no vorticity, and the fluid stays irrotational, hence formula_8 In the streamfunction representation, formula_9 Next, because of the translational invariance of the system in the &quot;x&quot;-direction, it is possible to make the ansatz

:formula_10

where &quot;k&quot; is a spatial wavenumber. Thus, the problem reduces to solving the equation

:formula_11

We work in a sea of infinite depth, so the boundary condition is at formula_12 The undisturbed surface is at formula_13, and the disturbed or wavy surface is at formula_14 where formula_15 is small in magnitude. If no fluid is to leak out of the bottom, we must have the condition

:formula_16

Hence, formula_17 on formula_18, where &quot;A&quot; and the wave speed &quot;c&quot; are constants to be determined from conditions at the interface.

&quot;The free-surface condition:&quot; At the free surface formula_19, the kinematic condition holds:

:formula_20

Linearizing, this is simply

:formula_21

where the velocity formula_22 is linearized on to the surface formula_23 Using the normal-mode and streamfunction representations, this condition is formula_24, the second interfacial condition.

&quot;Pressure relation across the interface&quot;: For the case with surface tension, the pressure difference over the interface at formula_25 is given by the Young–Laplace equation:

:formula_26

where &quot;σ&quot; is the surface tension and &quot;κ&quot; is the curvature of the interface, which in a linear approximation is

:formula_27

Thus,

:formula_28

However, this condition refers to the total pressure (base+perturbed), thus

:formula_29

(As usual, The perturbed quantities can be linearized onto the surface &quot;z=0&quot;.) Using hydrostatic balance, in the form formula_30

this becomes

:formula_31

The perturbed pressures are evaluated in terms of streamfunctions, using the horizontal momentum equation of the linearised Euler equations for the perturbations,

:formula_32

to yield formula_33

Putting this last equation and the jump condition together,

:formula_34

Substituting the second interfacial condition formula_35 and using the normal-mode representation, this relation becomes formula_36

Using the solution formula_37, this gives

formula_38

Since formula_39 is the phase speed in terms of the angular frequency formula_40 and the wavenumber, the gravity wave angular frequency can be expressed as

formula_41

The group velocity of a wave (that is, the speed at which a wave packet travels) is given by

formula_42

and thus for a gravity wave,

formula_43

The group velocity is one half the phase velocity. A wave in which the group and phase velocities differ is called dispersive.

===Shallow water===
Gravity waves traveling in shallow water (where the depth is much less than the wavelength), are nondispersive: the phase and group velocities are identical and independent of wavelength and frequency. When the water depth is &quot;h&quot;,

:formula_44

==Generation of ocean waves by wind==

Wind waves, as their name suggests, are generated by wind transferring energy from the atmosphere to the ocean&#x27;s surface, and capillary-gravity waves play an essential role in this effect. There are two distinct mechanisms involved, called after their proponents, Phillips and Miles.

In the work of Phillips, the ocean surface is imagined to be initially flat (&quot;glassy&quot;), and a turbulent wind blows over the surface. When a flow is turbulent, one observes a randomly fluctuating velocity field superimposed on a mean flow (contrast with a laminar flow, in which the fluid motion is ordered and smooth). The fluctuating velocity field gives rise to fluctuating stresses (both tangential and normal) that act on the air-water interface. The normal stress, or fluctuating pressure acts as a forcing term (much like pushing a swing introduces a forcing term). If the frequency and wavenumber formula_45 of this forcing term match a mode of vibration of the capillary-gravity wave (as derived above), then there is a resonance, and the wave grows in amplitude. As with other resonance effects, the amplitude of this wave grows linearly with time.

The air-water interface is now endowed with a surface roughness due to the capillary-gravity waves, and a second phase of wave growth takes place. A wave established on the surface either spontaneously as described above, or in laboratory conditions, interacts with the turbulent mean flow in a manner described by Miles. This is the so-called critical-layer mechanism. A critical layer forms at a height where the wave speed &quot;c&quot; equals the mean turbulent flow &quot;U&quot;. As the flow is turbulent, its mean profile is logarithmic, and its second derivative is thus negative. This is precisely the condition for the mean flow to impart its energy to the interface through the critical layer. This supply of energy to the interface is destabilizing and causes the amplitude of the wave on the interface to grow in time. As in other examples of linear instability, the growth rate of the disturbance in this phase is exponential in time.

This Miles–Phillips Mechanism process can continue until an equilibrium is reached, or until the wind stops transferring energy to the waves (i.e., blowing them along) or when they run out of ocean distance, also known as fetch length.

==Analog gravity models and surface gravity waves==

Surface gravity waves have been recognized as a powerful tool for studying analog gravity models, providing experimental platforms for phenomena typically found in black hole physics. In an experiment, surface gravity waves were utilized to simulate phase space horizons, akin to event horizons of black holes. This experiment observed logarithmic phase singularities, which are central to phenomena like Hawking radiation, and the emergence of Fermi-Dirac distributions, which parallel quantum mechanical systems.

By propagating surface gravity water waves, researchers were able to recreate the energy wave functions of an inverted harmonic oscillator, a system that serves as an analog for black hole physics. The experiment demonstrated how the free evolution of these classical waves in a controlled laboratory environment can reveal the formation of horizons and singularities, shedding light on fundamental aspects of gravitational theories and quantum mechanics.

<text>The quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) is a quasiperiodic oscillation of the equatorial zonal wind between easterlies and westerlies in the tropical stratosphere with a mean period of 28 to 29 months. The alternating wind regimes develop at the top of the lower stratosphere and propagate downwards at about per month until they are dissipated at the tropopause. Downward motion of the easterlies is usually more irregular than that of the westerlies. The amplitude of the easterly phase is about twice as strong as that of the westerly phase. At the top of the vertical QBO domain, easterlies dominate, while at the bottom, westerlies are more likely to be found. At the level, with regards to monthly mean zonal winds, the strongest recorded easterly was 29.55 m/s in November 2005, while the strongest recorded westerly was only 15.62 m/s in June 1995.

== Theory ==
In 1883, the eruption of Krakatoa led to visual tracking of subsequent volcanic ash in the stratosphere. This visual tracking led to the discovery of easterly winds between 25 and 30 km above the surface. The winds were then called the Krakatau easterlies. In 1908, data balloons launched above Lake Victoria in Africa recorded westerly winds in the stratospheric levels of the atmosphere. These findings, at the time, were thought to contradict the 1883 findings. However, the winds that would become known as the QBO were discovered to oscillate between westerly and easterly in the 1950s by researchers at the UK Meteorological Office. The cause of these QBO winds remained unclear for some time. Radiosonde soundings showed that its phase was not related to the annual cycle, as is the case for many other stratospheric circulation patterns. In the 1970s it was recognized by Richard Lindzen and James Holton that the periodic wind reversal was driven by atmospheric waves emanating from the tropical troposphere that travel upwards and are dissipated in the stratosphere by radiative cooling. The precise nature of the waves responsible for this effect was heavily debated; in recent years, however, gravity waves have come to be seen as a major contributor and the QBO is now simulated in a growing number of climate models.

== Effects ==
Effects of the QBO include mixing of stratospheric ozone by the secondary circulation caused by the QBO, modification of monsoon precipitation, and an influence on stratospheric circulation in northern hemisphere winter (mediated partly by a change in the frequency of sudden stratospheric warmings). Easterly phases of the QBO often coincide with more sudden stratospheric warmings, a weaker Atlantic jet stream, and cold winters in Northern Europe and the Eastern U.S. In contrast, westerly phases of the QBO often coincide with mild winters in the Eastern U.S. and a strong Atlantic jet stream with mild, wet winters in Northern Europe. In addition, the QBO has been shown to affect hurricane frequency during hurricane seasons in the Atlantic. Research has also been conducted investigating a possible relationship between ENSO (El Niño–Southern Oscillation) and the QBO.

== Observation of the QBO with weather balloons ==

The Free University of Berlin supplies a QBO data set that comprises radiosonde observations from Canton Island, Gan, and Singapore. The plot below shows the QBO during the 1980s.

== Recent observations ==
The first significant observed deviation from the normal QBO since its discovery in early 1950s was noted beginning in February 2016, when the transition to easterly winds was disrupted by a new band of westerly winds that formed unexpectedly. The lack of a reliable QBO cycle deprives forecasters of a valuable tool. Since the QBO has a strong influence on the North Atlantic Oscillation and thereby north European weather, scientists speculated that the coming winter could be warmer and stormier in that region.
NASA scientists have been researching to test if the extremely strong 2014–2016 El Niño, climate change, or some other factor might be involved. They are trying to determine whether this is more of a once-in-a-generation event or a sign of the changing climate.

<text>In fluid dynamics, a secondary circulation or [[secondary flow]] is a weak circulation that plays a key maintenance role in sustaining a stronger primary circulation that contains most of the kinetic energy and momentum of a flow. For example, a tropical cyclone&#x27;s primary winds are tangential (horizontally swirling), but its evolution and maintenance against friction involves an in-up-out secondary circulation flow that is also important to its clouds and rain. On a planetary scale, Earth&#x27;s winds are mostly east–west or zonal, but that flow is maintained against friction by the Coriolis force acting on a small north–south or meridional secondary circulation.

<text>&quot;&quot; (; ) is the national anthem of Nauru. The lyrics were written by Margaret Hendrie, with music composed by Laurence Henry Hicks. It was adopted in 1968, upon attaining independence from the mostly Australian-administered UN Trusteeship.

== History ==
The anthem was composed by Anglo-Australian composer and military bandmaster Laurence Henry Hicks, who was leader of the Black Watch Band. It was adopted upon independence from the UN Trust Territory of Nauru, which was mostly administered by Australia, in January 1968. The anthem did not have official lyrics at the time, but lyrics by Nauruan composer Margaret Griffith Hendrie (1935–1990) were later adopted.

<doc id="164328" wikidata="Q167447" url="?curid=164328" title="Barbie">
<text>Barbie is a fashion doll created by American businesswoman Ruth Handler, manufactured by American toy and entertainment company Mattel and introduced on March 9, 1959. The toy was based on the German Bild Lilli doll which Handler had purchased while in Europe. The figurehead of an eponymous brand that includes a range of fashion dolls and accessories, Barbie has been an important part of the toy fashion doll market for over six decades. Mattel has sold over a billion Barbie dolls, making it the company&#x27;s largest and most profitable line. The brand has expanded into a multimedia franchise since 1984, including video games, animated films, television/web series, and a live-action film.

Barbie and her male counterpart, Ken, have been described as the two most popular dolls in the world. Mattel generates a large portion of Barbie&#x27;s revenue through related merchandise —accessories, clothes, friends, and relatives of Barbie. Writing for &quot;Journal of Popular Culture&quot; in 1977, Don Richard Cox noted that Barbie has a significant impact on social values by conveying characteristics of female independence, and with her multitude of accessories, an idealized upscale lifestyle that can be shared with affluent friends.

==History==

===Development===
Ruth Handler watched her daughter Barbara play with paper dolls, and noticed that she often enjoyed giving them adult roles. At the time, most children&#x27;s toy dolls were representations of infants. Realizing that there could be a gap in the market, Handler suggested the idea of an adult-bodied doll to her husband Elliot, a co-founder of the Mattel toy company. He was unenthusiastic about the idea, as were Mattel&#x27;s directors.

During a trip to Switzerland in 1956 with her children Barbara and Kenneth, Ruth Handler came across a German toy doll called Bild Lilli. The adult-figured doll was exactly what Handler had in mind, so she purchased three of them. She gave one to her daughter and took the others back to Mattel. The Lilli doll was based on a popular character appearing in a satirical comic strip drawn by Reinhard Beuthin for the newspaper &quot;Bild&quot;. The Lilli doll was first sold in West Germany in 1955, and although it was initially sold to adults, it became popular with children who enjoyed dressing her up in outfits that were available separately.

Upon her return to the United States, Handler redesigned the doll (with help from local inventor-designer Jack Ryan) and the doll was given a new name, &quot;Barbie&quot;, after Handler&#x27;s daughter Barbara. The doll made its debut at the American International Toy Fair in New York City on March 9, 1959. This date is also used as Barbie&#x27;s official birthday.

===Launch===
The first Barbie doll wore a black-and-white zebra striped swimsuit and signature topknot ponytail, and was available as either a blonde or brunette. The doll was marketed as a &quot;Teen-age Fashion Model&quot;, with her clothes created by Mattel fashion designer Charlotte Johnson.

Analysts expected the doll to perform poorly due to her adult appearance and widespread assumptions about consumer preferences at the time. Ruth Handler believed it was important for Barbie to have an adult appearance, but early market research showed that some parents were unhappy about the doll&#x27;s chest, which had distinct breasts.

Barbie sold about 350,000 units in her first year, beating market expectations and generating upside risk for investors. Sales of Barbie exceeded Mattel&#x27;s ability to produce her for the first three years of her run. The market stabilized for the next decade while volume and margin increased by exporting refurbished dolls to Japan. Barbie was manufactured in Japan during this time, with her clothes hand-stitched by Japanese homeworkers.

Louis Marx and Company sued Mattel in March 1961. After licensing Lilli, they claimed that Mattel had &quot;infringed on Greiner &amp; Hausser&#x27;s patent for Bild-Lilli&#x27;s hip joint&quot;, and also claimed that Barbie was &quot;a direct take-off and copy&quot; of Bild-Lilli. The company additionally claimed that Mattel &quot;falsely and misleadingly represented itself as having originated the design&quot;. Mattel counter-claimed and the case was settled out of court in 1963. In 1964, Mattel bought Greiner &amp; Hausser&#x27;s copyright and patent rights for the Bild-Lilli doll for $21,600, .
Barbie&#x27;s appearance has been changed many times, most notably in 1971 when the doll&#x27;s eyes were adjusted to look forwards rather than having the demure sideways glance of the original model. This would be the last adjustment Ruth would make to her own creation as, three years later, she and her husband Elliot were removed from their posts at Mattel after an investigation found them guilty of issuing false and misleading financial reports.

Barbie was one of the first toys to have a marketing strategy based extensively on television advertising, which has been copied widely by other toys. In 2006, it was estimated that over a billion Barbie dolls had been sold worldwide in over 150 countries, with Mattel claiming that three Barbie dolls are sold every second.

Sales of Barbie dolls declined sharply from 2014 to 2016. According to MarketWatch, the release of the 2023 film &quot;Barbie&quot; is expected to create &quot;significant growth&quot; for the brand until at least 2030. As well as reinvigorated sales, the release of the film triggered a fashion trend known as &quot;Barbiecore&quot; and a film-related cultural phenomena named Barbenheimer.

==Appearances in media==
Since 1984, in response to a rise of digital and interactive media and a gradual decline in toys and doll sales at that time, Barbie has been featured in an eponymous media franchise beginning with the release of two eponymous video games, one that year and another in 1991 and two syndicated television specials released in 1987; &quot;Barbie and the Rockers: Out of This World&quot; and its sequel. She then began to appear as a virtual actress in a series of direct-to-video animated feature films with &quot;Barbie in the Nutcracker&quot; in 2001, which were also broadcast on Nickelodeon in the United States as promotional specials until 2017. Since 2017, the film series were revamped as streaming television films, branded as animated &quot;specials&quot; and released through streaming media services, primarily on Netflix.

At the time of the release of &quot;Barbie in the Pink Shoes&quot; on February 26, 2013, the film series have sold over 110 million units globally. Since 2012, she has appeared in several television and web series; including &quot;&quot;, &quot;Barbie: Dreamtopia&quot;, &quot;Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Aside in lead roles, she has appeared as a supporting character in the &quot;Toy Story&quot; films between its second and third sequels with a cameo at the fourth and the &quot;My Scene&quot; media franchise. In 2015, Barbie began appearing as a vlogger on YouTube called &quot;Barbie Vlogger&quot; where she talks about her fictional life, fashion, friends and family, and even charged topics such as mental health and racism. She was portrayed by Australian actress Margot Robbie in a live-action film adaptation released on July 21, 2023, by Warner Bros. Pictures in the United States.

==Fictional biography==
Barbie&#x27;s full name is Barbara Millicent Roberts and her parents&#x27; names are given as George and Margaret Roberts from the fictional town of Willows, Wisconsin, in a series of novels published by Random House in the 1960s. In those novels, Barbie attended Willows High School; while in the &quot;Generation Girl&quot; books, published by Golden Books in 1999, she attended the fictional Manhattan International High School in New York City (based on the real-life Stuyvesant High School).

She has an on-off romantic relationship with her then-boyfriend Ken (full name &quot;Kenneth Sean Carson&quot;), who first appeared in 1961. A news release from Mattel in February 2004 announced that Barbie and Ken had decided to split up, but in February 2006, they were hoping to rekindle their relationship after Ken had a makeover. In 2011, Mattel launched a campaign for Ken to win Barbie&#x27;s affections back. The pair officially reunited in Valentine&#x27;s Day 2011. Beginning with &quot;Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures&quot; in 2018, the pair are seen as just friends or next-door neighbors until a brief return to pre-2018 aesthetics in the 2023 television show, &quot;Barbie: A Touch of Magic&quot;.

Mattel has created a range of companions and relatives for Barbie. She has three younger sisters: Skipper, Stacie, and Chelsea (named Kelly until 2011). Her sisters have co-starred in many entries of the &quot;Barbie&quot; film series, starting with &quot;Barbie &amp; Her Sisters in A Pony Tale&quot; from 2013. &#x27;Retired&#x27; members of Barbie&#x27;s family included Todd (twin brother to Stacie), Krissy (a baby sister), and Francie (cousin). Barbie&#x27;s friends include Hispanic Teresa, Midge, African American Christie, and Steven (Christie&#x27;s boyfriend). Barbie was also friendly with Blaine, an Australian surfer, during her split with Ken in 2004.

Barbie has had over 40 pets including cats and dogs, horses, a panda, a lion cub, and a zebra. She has owned a wide range of vehicles, including pink Beetle and Corvette convertibles, trailers, and Jeeps. She also holds a pilot&#x27;s license, and operates commercial airliners in addition to serving as a flight attendant. Barbie&#x27;s careers are designed to show that women can take on a variety of roles in life, and the doll has been sold with a wide range of titles including &quot;Miss Astronaut Barbie&quot; (1965), &quot;Doctor Barbie&quot; (1988), and &quot;Nascar Barbie&quot; (1998).

==Legacy and influence==

Barbie has become a cultural icon and has been given honors that are rare in the toy world. In 1974, a section of Times Square in New York City was renamed Barbie Boulevard for a week. The Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris at the Louvre held a Barbie exhibit in 2016. The exhibit featured 700 Barbie dolls over two floors as well as works by contemporary artists and documents (newspapers, photos, video) that contextualize Barbie.

In 1986, the artist Andy Warhol created a painting of Barbie. The painting sold at auction at Christie&#x27;s, London for $1.1million. In 2015, The Andy Warhol Foundation then teamed up with Mattel to create an Andy Warhol Barbie.

Outsider artist Al Carbee took thousands of photographs of Barbie and created countless collages and dioramas featuring Barbie in various settings. Carbee was the subject of the 2013 feature-length documentary &quot;Magical Universe&quot;. Carbee&#x27;s collage art was presented in the 2016 Barbie exhibit at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris in the section about visuals artists who have been inspired by Barbie.

In 2013, in Taiwan, the first Barbie-themed restaurant called &quot;Barbie Café&quot; opened under the Sinlaku group.

The &quot;Economist&quot; has emphasized the importance of Barbie to children&#x27;s imagination:

On September 7, 2021, following the debut of the streaming television film &quot;&quot; on Netflix, Barbie joined forces with Grammy Award-nominated music producer, songwriter, singer and actress Ester Dean and Girls Make Beats – an organization dedicated to expanding the female presence of music producers, DJs and audio engineers – to inspire more girls to explore a future in music production.

=== Mattel Adventure Park ===

In 2023, Mattel broke ground on a theme park near Phoenix, Arizona. The park is to open in 2024 and highlights Mattel&#x27;s toys, including a Barbie Beach House, a Thomas &amp; Friends themed ride, and a Hot Wheels go-kart race track. The theme park will take place at the VAI Resort complex, located west of Phoenix, Arizona.

===50th anniversary===
In 2009, to celebrate the franchise&#x27;s 50th anniversary, a runway show was held in New York for the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week. The event showcased fashions contributed by fifty well-known haute couturiers including Diane von Fürstenberg, Vera Wang, Calvin Klein, Bob Mackie, and Christian Louboutin.

===Barbie Dream Gap Project===
In 2019, Mattel launched the &quot;Barbie Dream Gap Project&quot; to raise awareness of the phenomenon known as the &quot;Dream Gap&quot;: beginning at the age of five, girls begin to doubt their own intelligence, where boys do not. This leads to boys pursuing careers requiring a higher intelligence, and girls being underrepresented in those careers. As an example, in the U.S., 33% of sitting judges are female. This statistic inspired the release of Judge Barbie in four different skin tones and hairstyles with judge robes and a gavel accessory.

===Thank You Heroes===
In May 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Mattel announced a new line of career dolls modeled after the first responders and essential workers of 2020. For every doll purchased, Mattel donated a doll to the First Responders Children&#x27;s Foundation.

===Habitat for Humanity===
In February 2022, Mattel celebrated its 60-year anniversary of the Barbie Dreamhouse by partnering with Habitat for Humanity International. Mattel committed to taking on 60 projects, including new construction, home preservation, and neighborhood revitalization.

===Bad influence concerns===
In July 1992, Mattel released &quot;Teen Talk Barbie&quot;, which spoke a number of phrases including &quot;Will we ever have enough clothes?&quot;, &quot;I love shopping!&quot;, and &quot;Wanna have a pizza party?&quot; Each doll was programmed to say four out of 270 possible phrases, so that no two given dolls were likely to be the same (the number of possible combinations is 270!/(266!4!) = 216,546,345). One of these 270 phrases was &quot;Math class is tough!&quot;, which led to criticism from the American Association of University Women; about 1.5% of all the dolls sold said the phrase. The doll was often erroneously misattributed in the media as having said &quot;Math is hard!&quot; In October 1992, Mattel announced that &quot;Teen Talk Barbie&quot; would no longer say &quot;Math class is tough!&quot;, and offered a swap to anyone who owned a doll that did.

In 2002, Mattel introduced a line of pregnant Midge (and baby) dolls, but this &quot;Happy Family&quot; line was quickly pulled from the market due to complaints that she promoted teen pregnancy, though Midge was supposed to be a married adult.

In September 2003, the Middle Eastern country of Saudi Arabia outlawed the sale of Barbie dolls and franchises, stating that they did not conform to the ideals of Islam. The Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice warned, &quot;Jewish Barbie dolls, with their revealing clothes and shameful postures, accessories and tools are a symbol of decadence to the perverted West. Let us beware of her dangers and be careful.&quot; The 2003 Saudi ban was temporary. In Muslim-majority nations, there is an alternative doll called Fulla, which was introduced in November 2003 and is equivalent to Barbie, but is designed specifically to represent traditional Islamic values. Fulla is not manufactured by Mattel (although Mattel still licenses Fulla dolls and franchises for sale in certain markets), and (as of January 2021) the &quot;Jewish&quot; Barbie brand is still available in other Muslim-majority countries including Egypt and Indonesia. In Iran, the Sara and Dara dolls, which were introduced in March 2002, are available as an alternative to Barbie, even though they have not been as successful.

In November 2014, Mattel received criticism over the book &quot;I Can Be a Computer Engineer&quot;, which depicted Barbie as personally inept at computers, requiring her two male friends complete all of the necessary tasks to restore two laptops after she accidentally infects her and her sister&#x27;s laptop with a malware-laced USB flash drive, before ultimately getting credit for recovering her sister&#x27;s school project. Critics felt that the characterization of Barbie as a software designer lacking low-level technical skills was sexist, as other books in the &quot;I Can Be...&quot; series depicted Barbie as someone who was totally competent in those jobs and did not require outside assistance from others. Mattel later removed the book from sale on Amazon in response to the criticism, and the company released a &quot;Computer Engineer Barbie&quot; doll who was a game programmer rather than game designer.

==Diversity==
&quot;Colored Francie&quot; made her debut in 1967, and she is sometimes described as the first African-American Barbie doll. However, she was produced using the existing head molds for the white Francie doll and lacked distinct African characteristics other than dark skin. The first African-American doll in the Barbie range is usually regarded as Christie, who made her debut in 1968. Black Barbie was launched in 1980 but still had Caucasian features. In 1990, Mattel created a focus group with African-American children and parents, early childhood specialists, and clinical psychologist, Darlene Powell Hudson. Instead of using the same molds for the Caucasian Barbies, new ones were created. In addition, facial features, skin tones, hair texture, and names were all altered. The body shapes looked different, but the proportions were the same to ensure clothing and accessories were interchangeable. In September 2009, Mattel introduced the So In Style range, which was intended to create a more realistic depiction of African-American people than previous dolls.

Starting in 1980, it produced Hispanic dolls, and later came models from across the globe. For example, in 2007, it introduced &quot;Cinco de Mayo Barbie&quot; wearing a ruffled red, white, and green dress (echoing the Mexican flag). &quot;Hispanic&quot; magazine reports that: Professor Emilie Rose Aguilo-Perez argued that over time, Mattel shifted from ambiguous Hispanic presentations in their dolls to one that is more assertive in its &quot;Latinx&quot; marketing and product labeling.

Mattel has responded to criticisms pointing to a lack of diversity in the line. In 2016, Mattel expanded the So In Style line to include seven skin tones, twenty-two eye colors, and twenty-four hairstyles. Part of the reason for this change was due to declining sales. The brand now offers over 22 skin tones, 94 hair colors, 13 eye colors and five body types.

Mattel teamed up with Nabisco to launch a cross-promotion Barbie doll with Oreo cookies in 1997 and 2001. While the 1997 release of the doll was only released in a white version, for the 2001 release Mattel manufactured both a white and a black version. The 2001 release &quot;Barbie Oreo School Time Fun&quot; was marketed as someone with whom young girls could play after class and share &quot;America&#x27;s favorite cookie&quot;. Critics argued that in the African American community, &quot;Oreo&quot; is a derogatory term meaning that the person is &quot;black on the outside and white on the inside&quot;, like the chocolate sandwich cookie itself.

In May 1997, Mattel introduced &quot;Share a Smile Becky&quot;, a doll in a pink wheelchair. Kjersti Johnson, a 17-year-old high school student in Tacoma, Washington with cerebral palsy, pointed out that the doll would not fit into the elevator of Barbie&#x27;s $100 Dream House. Mattel announced that it would redesign the house in the future to accommodate the doll.

In July 2024, Mattel released the first blind Barbie in collaboration with the American Foundation for the Blind. Alongside this, the company also launched a black Barbie with Down syndrome.

==Role model Barbies==
In March 2018, in time for International Women&#x27;s Day, Mattel unveiled the &quot;Barbie Celebrates Role Models&quot; campaign with a line of 17 dolls, informally known as &quot;sheroes&quot;, from diverse backgrounds &quot;to showcase examples of extraordinary women&quot;. Mattel developed this collection in response to mothers concerned about their daughters having positive female role models. Dolls in this collection include Frida Kahlo, Patti Jenkins, Chloe Kim, Nicola Adams, Ibtihaj Muhammad, Bindi Irwin, Amelia Earhart, Misty Copeland, Helene Darroze, Katherine Johnson, Sara Gama, Martyna Wojciechowska, Gabby Douglas, Guan Xiaotong, Ava Duvernay, Yuan Yuan Tan, Iris Apfel, Ashley Graham and Leyla Piedayesh. In 2020, the company announced a new release of &quot;shero&quot; dolls, including Paralympic champion Madison de Rozario, and world four-time sabre champion Olga Kharlan. In July 2021, Mattel released a Naomi Osaka Barbie doll as a part of the &#x27;Barbie Role Model&#x27; series. Osaka originally partnered with Barbie two years earlier. A month earlier, a Julie Bishop doll was released to acknowledge the former Australian politician, as was one for general practitioner Kirby White for her work during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. In August 2021 a Barbie modelled after European Space Agency astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti was released.

==Collecting==

The standard range of Barbie dolls and related accessories are manufactured to approximately 1/6 scale, which is also known as &quot;playscale&quot;. The standard dolls are approximately tall.

Mattel estimates that there are well over 100,000 avid Barbie collectors. Ninety percent are women, at an average age of 40, purchasing more than twenty Barbie dolls each year. Forty-five percent of them spend upwards of $1000 a year.
Vintage Barbie dolls from the early years are the most valuable at auction, and while the original Barbie was sold for $3.00 in 1959, a mint boxed Barbie from 1959 sold for $3552.50 on eBay in October 2004. On September 26, 2006, a Barbie doll set a world record at auction of £9,000 sterling (US$17,000) at Christie&#x27;s in London. The doll was a Barbie in Midnight Red from 1965 and was part of a private collection of 4,000 Barbie dolls being sold by two Dutch women, Ietje Raebel and her daughter Marina.

In recent years, Mattel has sold a wide range of Barbie dolls aimed specifically at collectors, including porcelain versions, vintage reproductions, and depictions of Barbie as a range of characters from film and television series such as &quot;The Munsters&quot; and &quot;Star Trek&quot;. There are also collector&#x27;s edition dolls depicting Barbie dolls with a range of different ethnic identities. In 2004, Mattel introduced the Color Tier system for its collector&#x27;s edition Barbie dolls including pink, silver, gold, and platinum, depending on how many of the dolls are produced. In 2020, Mattel introduced the Dia De Los Muertos collectible Barbie doll, the second collectible released as part of the company&#x27;s La Catrina line which was launched in 2019.

==Parodies and lawsuits==
Barbie has frequently been the target of parody: 
* Mattel sued artist Tom Forsythe over a 1999 series of photographs called &quot;Food Chain Barbie&quot; in which Barbie winds up in a blender. Mattel lost the lawsuit and was forced to pay Forsythe&#x27;s legal costs.
* On the 25th episode of &quot;In Living Color&quot;, in December 1990, a Homey D. Clown sketch found HDC filling in for Santa Claus at a shopping mall. A little girl (Kelly Coffield) asks for a Malibu Barbie &amp; Condominium playset; instead, &quot;Homey Claus&quot; gives her &quot;Compton Carlotta&quot; (a crude doll made of sticks and bottlecaps) with a slum-apartment (a milk carton). When the girl complains, Homey raises his signature blackjack and wishes her a Merry Christmas; taking the hint, she thanks him and hastily retires. 
* In Latin America, notable controversies include a 2018 legal dispute involving the Panama-based Frida Kahlo Corporation&#x27;s allegations that Frida Kahlo&#x27;s great-niece in Mexico had wrongly licensed the Frida Kahlo trademark for the &quot;Frida Kahlo Barbie&quot; doll.
* Mattel filed a lawsuit in 2004 in the U.S. against Barbara Anderson-Walley, a Canadian business owner whose nickname is &quot;Barbie&quot;, over her website, which sells fetish clothing. The lawsuit was dismissed.
* In 2011, Greenpeace parodied Barbie, calling on Mattel to adopt a policy for its paper purchases that would protect the rainforest. Four months later, Mattel adopted a paper sustainability policy.
* &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; aired a parody of the Barbie commercials featuring &quot;Gangsta Bitch Barbie&quot; and &quot;Tupac Ken&quot;. In 2002, the show also aired a skit, which starred Britney Spears as Barbie&#x27;s sister Skipper.
* In November 2002, a New York judge refused an injunction against the British-based artist Susanne Pitt, who had produced a &quot;Dungeon Barbie&quot; doll in bondage clothing.
* Aqua&#x27;s 1997 song &quot;Barbie Girl&quot;, which topped the charts worldwide, was the subject of the 2002 lawsuit &quot;Mattel v. MCA Records&quot;. Mattel lost, with Judge Alex Kozinski saying that the song was a &quot;parody and a social commentary&quot;.
* Two commercials by automobile company Nissan featuring dolls similar to Barbie and Ken was the subject of another lawsuit in 1997. In the first commercial, a female doll is lured into a car by a doll resembling G.I. Joe to the dismay of a Ken-like doll, accompanied by Van Halen&#x27;s &quot;You Really Got Me&quot;. In the second commercial, the &quot;Barbie&quot; doll is saved by the &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; doll after she is accidentally knocked into a swimming pool by the &quot;Ken&quot; doll to Kiss&#x27;s &quot;Calling Dr. Love&quot;. The makers of the commercial said that the dolls&#x27; names were Roxanne, Nick and Tad. Mattel claimed that the commercial did &quot;irreparable damage&quot; to its products, but settled.
* In 1999, Canadian nude model Barbie Doll Benson was involved in a trademark infringement case over her domain name, BarbieBenson.com.
* In 1993, a group calling itself the Barbie Liberation Organization secretly modified a group of Barbie dolls by implanting voice boxes from G.I. Joe dolls, then returning the Barbies to the toy stores from where they were purchased.
* Malibu Stacy from &quot;The Simpsons&quot; 1994 episode &quot;Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy&quot;.
* &quot;Savior Barbie&quot; refers to a satirical Instagram account. Savior Barbie is depicted as being in Africa where she runs an NGO that provides drinking water to locals and makes sure to provide footage that depicts her glorious acts of goodness. The account is likely to have inspired others such as &quot;Hipster Barbie&quot; and &quot;Socality Barbie&quot;.

==Competition from Bratz dolls==
In May 2001, MGA Entertainment launched the &quot;Bratz&quot; series of dolls, a move that gave Barbie her first serious competition in the fashion doll market. In 2004, sales figures showed that Bratz dolls were outselling Barbie dolls in the United Kingdom, although Mattel maintained that in terms of the number of dolls, clothes, and accessories sold, Barbie remained the leading brand. In 2005, figures showed that sales of Barbie dolls had fallen by 30% in the United States, and by 18% worldwide, with much of the drop being attributed to the popularity of Bratz dolls.

In December 2006, Mattel sued MGA Entertainment for $1 billion, alleging that Bratz creator Carter Bryant was working for Mattel when he developed the idea for &quot;Bratz&quot;. On July 17, 2008, a federal jury agreed that the Bratz line was created by Carter Bryant while he was working for Mattel and that MGA and its chief executive officer Isaac Larian were liable for converting Mattel property for their own use and intentionally interfering with the contractual duties owed by Bryant to Mattel. On August 26, the jury found that Mattel would have to be paid $100 million in damages. On December 3, 2008, U.S. District Judge Stephen Larson banned MGA from selling Bratz. He allowed the company to continue selling the dolls until the winter holiday season ended. On appeal, a stay was granted by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit; the Court also overturned the District Court&#x27;s original ruling for Mattel, where MGA Entertainment was ordered to forfeit the entire &quot;Bratz&quot; brand.

Mattel Inc. and MGA Entertainment Inc. returned to court on January 18, 2011, to renew their battle over who owns &quot;Bratz&quot;, which this time included accusations from both companies that the other side stole trade secrets. On April 21, 2011, a federal jury returned a verdict supporting MGA. On August 5, 2011, Mattel was also ordered to pay MGA $310 million for attorney fees, stealing trade secrets, and false claims rather than the $88.5 million issued in April.

In August 2009, MGA introduced a range of dolls called Moxie Girlz, intended as a replacement for Bratz dolls.

==Effects on body image==
From the start, some have complained that &quot;the blonde, plastic doll conveyed an unrealistic body image to girls.&quot;

Criticisms of Barbie are often centered around concerns that children consider Barbie a role model and will attempt to emulate her. One of the most common criticisms of Barbie is that she promotes an unrealistic idea of body image for a young woman, leading to a risk that girls who attempt to emulate her will become anorexic. Unrealistic body proportions in Barbie dolls have been connected to some eating disorders in children.

A standard Barbie doll is tall, giving a height of at 1/6 scale. Barbie&#x27;s vital statistics have been estimated at (chest), (waist) and (hips). According to research by the University Central Hospital in Helsinki, Finland, she would lack the 17 to 22 percent body fat required for a woman to menstruate. In 1963, the outfit &quot;Barbie Baby-Sits&quot; came with a book titled &quot;How to Lose Weight&quot; which advised: &quot;Don&#x27;t eat!&quot; The same book was included in another ensemble called &quot;Slumber Party&quot; in 1965 along with a pink bathroom scale permanently set at , which would be underweight for a woman tall. Mattel said that the waist of the Barbie doll was made small because the waistbands of her clothes, along with their seams, snaps, and zippers, added bulk to her figure. In 1997, Barbie&#x27;s body mold was redesigned and given a wider waist, with Mattel saying that this would make the doll better suited to contemporary fashion designs.

In 2016, Mattel introduced a range of new body types: &#x27;tall&#x27;, &#x27;petite&#x27;, and &#x27;curvy&#x27;, releasing them exclusively as part of the Barbie Fashionistas line. &#x27;Curvy Barbie&#x27; received a great deal of media attention and even made the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine with the headline &quot;Now Can We Stop Talking About My Body?&quot;. Despite the curvy doll&#x27;s body shape being equivalent to a US size 4 in clothing, some children reportedly regarded her as &quot;fat&quot;.

Although Barbie had been criticized for its unrealistic-looking &quot;tall and petite&quot; dolls, the company has been offering more dolls set to more realistic standards in order to help promote a positive body image.

===&quot;Barbie syndrome&quot;===
&quot;Barbie syndrome&quot; is a term that has been used to depict the desire to have a physical appearance and lifestyle representative of the Barbie doll. It is most often associated with pre-teenage and adolescent girls but is applicable to any age group or gender. A person with Barbie syndrome attempts to emulate the doll&#x27;s physical appearance, even though the doll has unattainable body proportions. This syndrome is seen as a form of body dysmorphic disorder and results in various eating disorders as well as an obsession with cosmetic surgery.

Ukrainian model Valeria Lukyanova has received attention from the press, due in part to her appearance having been modified based on the physique of Barbie. She stated that she has only had breast implants and relies heavily on make up and contacts to alter her appearance. Similarly, Lacey Wildd, an American reality television personality frequently referred to as &quot;Million Dollar Barbie&quot;, has also undergone 12 breast augmentation surgeries to become &quot;the extreme Barbie&quot;.

Jessica Alves, prior to coming out as transgender, underwent over £373,000 worth of cosmetic procedures to match the appearance of Barbie&#x27;s male counterpart, garnering her the nickname the &quot;Human Ken Doll&quot;. These procedures have included multiple nose jobs, six pack ab implants, a buttock lift, and hair and chest implants. Sporting the same nickname, Justin Jedlica, the American businessman, has also received multiple cosmetic surgeries to enhance his Ken-like appearance.

In 2006, researchers Helga Dittmar, Emma Halliwell, and Suzanne Ive conducted an experiment testing how dolls, including Barbie, affect self-image in young girls. Dittmar, Halliwell, and Ive gave picture books to girls age 5–8, one with photos of Barbie and the other with photos of Emme, a doll with more realistic physical features. The girls were then asked about their ideal body size. Their research found that the girls who were exposed to the images of Barbie had significantly lower self-esteem than the girls who had photos of Emme. However, Benjamin Radford noted that the answer may not be this simple since this research also showed that the age of the girl was a significant factor in the influence the doll had on her self esteem.

<text>The Avro Lancaster, commonly known as the Lancaster Bomber, is a British Second World War heavy bomber. It was designed and manufactured by Avro as a contemporary of the Handley Page Halifax, both bombers having been developed to the same specification, as well as the Short Stirling, all three aircraft being four-engined heavy bombers adopted by the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the same era.

The Lancaster has its origins in the twin-engine Avro Manchester which had been developed during the late 1930s in response to the Air Ministry Specification P.13/36 for a medium bomber for &quot;world-wide use&quot; which could carry a torpedo internally, and make shallow dive-bombing attacks. Originally developed as an evolution of the Manchester (which had proved troublesome in service and was retired in 1942), the Lancaster was designed by Roy Chadwick and powered by four Rolls-Royce Merlins and in one of the versions, Bristol Hercules engines. It first saw service with RAF Bomber Command in 1942 and as the strategic bombing offensive over Europe gathered momentum, it was the main aircraft for the night-time bombing campaigns that followed. As increasing numbers of the type were produced, it became the principal heavy bomber used by the RAF, the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and squadrons from other Commonwealth and European countries serving within the RAF, overshadowing the Halifax and Stirling, two other commonly used bombers.

A long, unobstructed bomb bay meant that the Lancaster could take the largest bombs used by the RAF, including the , and &quot;blockbusters&quot;, loads often supplemented with smaller bombs or incendiaries. The &quot;Lanc&quot;, as it was known colloquially, became one of the most heavily used of the Second World War night bombers, delivering of bombs in 156,000 sorties. The versatility of the Lancaster was such that it was chosen to equip 617 Squadron and was modified to carry the Upkeep &quot;bouncing bomb&quot; designed by Barnes Wallis for Operation Chastise, the attack on German Ruhr valley dams. Although the Lancaster was primarily a night bomber, it excelled in many other roles, including daylight precision bombing, for which some Lancasters were adapted to carry the Tallboy and then the Grand Slam earthquake bombs (also designed by Wallis). This was the largest payload of any bomber in the war.

In 1943, a Lancaster was converted to become an engine test bed for the Metropolitan-Vickers F.2 turbojet. Lancasters were later used to test other engines, including the Armstrong Siddeley Mamba and Rolls-Royce Dart turboprops and the Avro Canada Orenda and STAL Dovern turbojets. Postwar, the Lancaster was supplanted as the main strategic bomber of the RAF by the Avro Lincoln, a larger version of the Lancaster. The Lancaster took on the role of long range anti-submarine patrol aircraft (later supplanted by the Avro Shackleton) and air-sea rescue. It was also used for photo-reconnaissance and aerial mapping, as a flying tanker for aerial refuelling and as the Avro Lancastrian, a long-range, high-speed, transatlantic passenger and postal delivery airliner. In March 1946, a Lancastrian of BSAA flew the first scheduled flight from the new London Heathrow Airport.
==Development==
===Origins===
In the 1930s, the Royal Air Force (RAF) was primarily interested in twin-engine bombers. These designs put limited demands on engine production and maintenance, both of which were already stretched with the introduction of so many new types into service. Power limitations were so serious that the British invested heavily in the development of huge engines in the class in order to improve performance. During the late 1930s, none of these were ready for production. Both the United States and the Soviet Union were pursuing the development of bombers powered by arrangements of four smaller engines; the results of these projects proved to possess favourable characteristics such as excellent range and fair lifting capacity. Accordingly, in 1936, the RAF also decided to investigate the feasibility of the four-engined bomber.

The origins of the Lancaster stem from a twin-engined bomber that had been submitted to British Air Ministry Specification P.13/36 of 1936 for a twin-engined medium bomber for &quot;worldwide use&quot; which could carry a torpedo internally, and make shallow dive-bombing attacks. Further requirements of the specification included the use of a mid-mounted cantilever monoplane wing, and all-metal construction while the use of the Rolls-Royce Vulture, which was in development was encouraged. Twin-engine designs were submitted by Fairey, Boulton Paul, Handley Page and Shorts, using Rolls-Royce Vulture, Napier Sabre, Fairey P.24 or Bristol Hercules engines. Most of these engines were still under development and while four-engined bomber designs were considered for specification B.12/36 for a heavy bomber, the extra engines required the wing and overall aircraft structure to be stronger, increasing the structural weight.

Avro submitted the Avro 679 to fulfil Specification P.13/36 and, in February 1937, Avro&#x27;s submission was selected, along with Handley Page&#x27;s bid as a backup. In April 1937, a pair of prototypes for each design was ordered. Avro&#x27;s aircraft, named the Manchester, entered RAF service in November 1940. Although a capable aircraft, the Manchester was underpowered and its Vulture engines proved to be unreliable. As a result, only 200 were constructed and the type was withdrawn from service in 1942.

===Flight testing===
By mid-1940, Avro&#x27;s chief design engineer, Roy Chadwick, was working on an improved Manchester powered by four of the more reliable but less powerful Rolls-Royce Merlin engines, specifically adopting the &quot;Power-egg&quot; installation developed for the Beaufighter II, and installed on a wing of increased span. Initially, the improved aircraft was designated as the &quot;Type 683 Manchester III&quot; but was subsequently renamed the Lancaster. The prototype, serial number &quot;BT308&quot;, was assembled by the Avro experimental flight department at Ringway Airport, Manchester, being modified from a production Manchester airframe, combined with the new wing to accommodate the additional engines. The first flight was made by test pilot H. A. &quot;Sam&quot; Brown on 9 January 1941 at RAF Ringway, Cheshire.
Flight testing of the new aircraft quickly proved it to be a substantial improvement over its predecessor. The first prototype was initially outfitted with the Manchester I&#x27;s three-finned tail but this was revised on the second prototype, &quot;DG595&quot;, and subsequent production Lancasters used the larger elliptical twin-finned tail unit that was also adopted for the last Manchesters built. This not only increased stability but also improved the dorsal gun turret&#x27;s field of fire. The second prototype was also fitted with more powerful Merlin XX engines.

Manchesters still on the production line were converted into Lancaster B.Is. Based upon its performance, a decision was taken early on to reequip twin-engine bomber squadrons with the Lancaster as quickly as possible. &quot;L7527&quot;, The first production Lancaster made its first flight in October 1941, powered by Merlin XX engines.

===Production===

Avro received an initial contract for 1,070 Lancasters. The majority of Lancasters manufactured during the war years were constructed by Avro at its factory at Chadderton near Oldham, Lancashire and were test-flown from Woodford Aerodrome in Cheshire. As it was quickly recognised that Avro&#x27;s capacity was exceeded by the wartime demand for the type, it was decided to form the &quot;Lancaster Aircraft Group&quot;, which comprised a number of companies that undertook the type&#x27;s manufacture, either performing primary assembly themselves or producing various subsections and components for the other participating manufacturers. Wythenshawe Bus Garage, built of reinforced concrete during 1939–42 and designed by the Manchester City Architect, G. Noel Hill, was immediately taken over by the Ministry of Aircraft Production and Avro used it in its Lancaster aircraft production.

In addition to Avro, further Lancasters were constructed by Metropolitan-Vickers (1,080, also tested at Woodford) and Armstrong Whitworth. They were also produced at the Austin Motor Company works in Longbridge, Birmingham, later in the Second World War and post-war by Vickers-Armstrongs at Chester as well as at the Vickers Armstrong factory, Castle Bromwich, Birmingham. Belfast-based aircraft firm Short Brothers had also received an order for 200 Lancaster B.Is, but this was cancelled before any aircraft had been completed.

The Lancaster was also produced overseas. During early 1942, it was decided that the bomber should be produced in Canada, where it was manufactured by Victory Aircraft in Malton, Ontario. Of later variants, only the Canadian-built &quot;Lancaster B X&quot; was produced in significant numbers. A total of 430 of this type were built, earlier examples differing little from their British-built predecessors, except for using Packard-built Merlin engines and American-style instruments and electrics. In August 1942, a British-built Lancaster B.I was dispatched to Canada as a pattern aircraft, becoming the first of the type to conduct a transatlantic crossing. The first Lancaster produced in Canada was named the &quot;Ruhr Express&quot;. The first batch of Canadian Lancasters delivered to England suffered from faulty ailerons; this error was subsequently traced to the use of unskilled labour. By the end of the conflict, over 10,000 Canadians were employed on the production line, which was producing one Lancaster each day.

===Further development===

The Lancaster B.I was never fully superseded in production by a successor model, remaining in production until February 1946. According to aviation authors Brian Goulding and M. Garbett, the Lancaster B.I altered little during its production life, partially as a result of the sound basic structure and design; of the visible changes, the fuselage side windows were deleted, the Perspex chin of the bomb-aimer was enlarged, and a larger astrodome was provided. Various additional bumps and blisters were also added, which typically housed radar equipment and radio navigational aids. Some Lancaster B.I bombers were outfitted with bulged bomb bay doors in order to accommodate increased armament payloads.

Early production Lancaster B.Is were outfitted with a ventral gun turret position. In response to feedback on the lack of application for the ventral turret, the ventral turret was often eliminated during the course of each aircraft&#x27;s career. While some groups chose to discard the position entirely, various trials and experiments were performed at RAF Duxford, Cambridgeshire and by individual squadrons. A total of 50 Austin-built Lancaster B.Is was constructed to a non-standard configuration, having a Frazer Nash turret installed directly above the bomb bay; however, this modification was largely unpopular due to its obstruction of the internal walkway, hindering crew movements. Various other turret configurations were adopted by individual squadrons, which included the removal of various combinations of turrets.

The &quot;Lancaster B.III&quot; was powered by Packard Merlin engines, which had been built overseas in the United States, but was otherwise identical to contemporary B.Is. In total, 3,030 B.IIIs were constructed, almost all of them at Avro&#x27;s Newton Heath factory. The Lancaster B.I and B.III were manufactured concurrently and minor modifications were made to both marks as further batches were ordered. The B.I and B.III designations were effectively interchangeable simply by changing the engines used, which was occasionally done in practice. Examples of modifications made include the relocation of the pitot head from the nose to the side of the cockpit and the change from de Havilland &quot;needle blade&quot; propellers to Hamilton Standard or Nash Kelvinator made &quot;paddle blade&quot; propellers.

==Design==

===Overview===

The Avro Lancaster was a British four-engined strategic bomber that was used as the RAF&#x27;s principal heavy bomber during the latter half of the Second World War. The typical aircraft was powered by an arrangement of four wing-mounted Rolls-Royce Merlin piston engines, each of which drove a diameter de Havilland Hydromatic three-bladed propeller. While not optimal, the Lancaster was capable of flying the return journey home on only two operational engines, along with very limited distances on a single running engine. Aviation authors Brian Goulding and M. Garbett have claimed that experienced Lancaster pilots were often able to out-manoeuver Luftwaffe fighters. It possessed largely favourable flying characteristics, having been described by Goulding and Garbett as being: &quot;a near-perfect flying machine, fast for its size and very smooth...such a delightfully easy aeroplane to fly...there are instances of Lancasters having been looped and barrel-rolled, both intentionally and otherwise&quot;.

The Lancaster benefited from a structure that possessed considerable strength and durability, which had been intentionally designed to maximise structural strength-per-weight; this resulted in the Lancaster being capable of withstanding some levels of damage resulting from attacks by hostile interceptor aircraft and ground-based anti-aircraft batteries. However, during the first year of the type&#x27;s career, some instances of structural failures were encountered on Lancaster B.Is and a number of aircraft were lost in accidents as a result of the design limitations having been greatly exceeded. Compared with other contemporary aircraft, the Lancaster was not an easy aircraft to escape from as its escape hatch was only in size; in a Halifax or Stirling (which both had an escape hatch wider), 25 per cent of downed aircrew bailed out successfully, and in American bombers (albeit in daylight raids) it was as high as a 50 per cent success rate while only 15 per cent of the Lancaster crew were able to bail out.

The Lancaster uses a mid-wing cantilever monoplane configuration. The wing is constructed from five separate main sections while the fuselage is likewise composed of five sections. Aside from a few elements, such as the fabric-covered ailerons, the Lancaster&#x27;s oval-shaped fuselage had an all-metal covering. All of the wing and fuselage sections were manufactured separately, during which they were outfitted with all of the required equipment in advance of final assembly being performed, as a measure intended to accelerate the rate of production. The Lancaster was equipped with a retractable main undercarriage and fixed tailwheel; the hydraulically-actuated main landing gear raised rearwards into recesses within the inner engine nacelles. The distinctive tail unit of the aircraft was outfitted with a large twin elliptical fins and rudder arrangement.

Like any aeroplane, the Lancaster was not viceless in its handling. In a dive, it had a tendency to go more deeply into the dive as speed increased. Not all aeroplanes did this, for example, the Halifax tended to get increasingly tail-heavy as speed increased, and thus fly itself out of the dive. Furthermore, the Lancaster suffered longitudinal instability at speeds above .

===Crew accommodation===
The standard crew for a Lancaster consisted of seven men, stationed in various positions in the fuselage. Starting at the nose, the bomb aimer had two positions to man. His primary location was lying prone on the floor of the nose of the aircraft, with access to the bombsight controls facing forward, with the Mark XIV bomb sight on his left and bomb release selectors on the right. He also used his view through the large transparent perspex nose cupola to assist the navigator with map reading. To man the Frazer Nash FN5 nose turret, he stood up placing himself in position behind the triggers of the twin .303 in (7.7 mm) guns. Ammunition for the turret was 1,000 rounds per gun (rpg). The bomb aimer&#x27;s position contained the nose emergency hatch in the floor; at (two inches narrower than the Halifax escape hatch) it was difficult to exit through while wearing a parachute. Operational research experts, including British scientist Freeman Dyson, amongst others, attempted unsuccessfully to have the escape hatch enlarged.
On the roof of the bomb bay the pilot and flight engineer sat side by side under the expansive canopy, with the pilot sitting on the left on a raised portion of the floor (almost all British bombers, and most German bombers, had only a single pilot seat as opposed to the American practice of carrying two pilots, or at least having controls for two pilots installed). The flight engineer sat on a collapsible seat (known as a &quot;second dicky seat&quot;) to the pilot&#x27;s right, with the fuel selectors and gauges on a panel behind him and to his right. The pilot and other crew members could use the panel above the cockpit as an auxiliary emergency exit while the mid-upper gunner was expected to use the rear entrance door to leave the aircraft. The tail gunner escaped by rotating his turret to the rear, opening the door in the back of the turret, passing into the fuselage, and clipping on a parachute that was hung on the side wall. He could then exit through the rear entrance door.

Behind the pilot and flight engineer, and behind a curtain fitted to allow him to use light to work, sat the navigator. His position faced to port with a chart table in front of him. An instrument panel showing the airspeed, altitude, and other information required for navigation was mounted on the side of the fuselage above the chart table. The wireless operator&#x27;s radios were mounted on the left-hand end of the chart table, facing the rear of the aircraft. Behind these and facing forwards the wireless operator sat on a seat at the front of the main spar. On his left was a window, and above him was the astrodome, used for visual signalling and by the navigator for celestial navigation.

Behind the wireless operator were the two spars of the wing, which created a major obstacle for crew members moving down the fuselage even on the ground. At the end of the bomb bay was the mid-upper gunner&#x27;s turret, at which the floor dropped down to the fuselage&#x27;s bottom. His position allowed a 360° view over the top of the aircraft, with two Browning .303 Mark IIs to protect the aircraft from above and to the side. The mid-upper gunner sat on a rectangle of canvas that was slung beneath the turret and would stay in position throughout the flight. The turret had 1,000 rounds of ammunition per gun.

To the rear of the turret was the side crew door, on the starboard side of the fuselage. This was the main entrance to the aircraft, and also could be used as an emergency exit. The Elsan chemical toilet, a type of aircraft lavatory, was located near the spars for the tailplane. At the extreme tail-end of the fuselage, the rear gunner sat in his exposed position in the tail turret, which was entered through a small hatch in the rear of the fuselage. Depending on the size of the rear gunner, the area was so cramped that the gunner would often hang his parachute on a hook inside the fuselage, near the turret doors. Neither the mid-upper nor the rear gunner&#x27;s position was heated, and the gunners had to wear electrically heated suits to prevent hypothermia and frostbite.

===Armament===

====Defensive armament====

The Avro Lancaster was initially equipped with four Nash &amp; Thompson Frazer Nash hydraulically operated turrets mounted in the nose, tail, mid-upper and underside. The original tail turret was equipped with four Browning .303 Mark II machine guns and all other turrets with two such machine guns.

Late on in the war, Freeman Dyson (as a 19-year-old who had yet to win a degree) put forward a case for the removal of the majority of the Lancaster&#x27;s defensive armament. He argued that this would reduce the loss rate by increasing the Lancaster&#x27;s cruising speed by up to (assuming the bomb load was not increased), making the bomber harder to intercept. He also claimed reducing defensive air gunners would reduce human losses incurred with each aircraft lost. However this neglects the fact that the two main Luftwaffe night fighters of the time, the Messerschmitt Bf 110 and the Junkers Ju 88 night fighters were capable of over , thus a increase over the Lancaster&#x27;s normal cruising speed of around , giving a speed of , still left the Lancaster vulnerable to interception. The introduction of the Heinkel He 219 and Messerschmitt Me 262 night fighters erased any speed advantage and would have left the aircraft undefended. Consequently, Dyson&#x27;s proposal was not adopted.

=====Nose turret=====

Only the FN-5A nose turret which was similar to the FN-5 used on the preceding Avro Manchester, the Vickers Wellington and the Short Stirling remained unchanged during the life of the design, except where it was removed.

=====Ventral turret=====
The ventral (underside) FN-64 turret quickly proved to be dead weight, being both difficult to sight because it relied on a periscope which limited the gunner&#x27;s view to a 20-degree arc, and too slow to keep a target within its sights. Aside from early B.Is and the prototype B.IIs, the FN-64 was almost never used. When the Luftwaffe began using &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; to make attacks from below in the winter of 1943/1944, modifications were made, including downward observation blisters mounted behind the bomb aimer&#x27;s blister and official and unofficial mounts for machine guns or even cannon, firing through the ventral holes of the removed FN-64. The fitting of these guns was hampered as the same ventral position was used for mounting the H2S blister, which limited installations to those aircraft fitted with bulged bomb bays which interfered with the H2S.

=====Mid-upper turret=====

The mid-upper (dorsal or top) turret was an FN-50 on early examples and the very similar FN-150 with improved sights and controls on later examples. On all but the earliest examples, this turret was surrounded by a coaming which provided a track for a cam-operated interrupter device which prevented the gunner from shooting the tail of his own aircraft. The Mk.VII and late Mk.X Lancasters used the heavier, electrically controlled Martin 250 CE 23A turret equipped with two machine guns which was mounted further forward to preserve the aircraft&#x27;s longitudinal balance, and because it had an internal mechanism to prevent firing on the aircraft itself, it did not require a coaming. Other experimental turrets were tried out, including the FN-79 and the Boulton-Paul Type H barbette system.

=====Tail turret=====
The tail turret was the most important defensive position and carried the heaviest armament. Despite this, the turrets used, starting with the FN-20, were never entirely satisfactory and numerous designs were tried. The FN-20 was replaced by the very similar FN-120 which used an improved gyroscopic gun sight (GGS). Many rear gunners insisted on having the centre section of perspex removed from the turret to improve visibility. The transparencies were difficult to see through at night, particularly when trying to keep watch for enemy night fighters that appeared without notice astern and below the aircraft when getting into position to open fire. This removal of perspex from the turret was called the &quot;Gransden Lodge&quot; modification. Ammunition for the tail turret was 2,500 rounds per gun. Due to the weight, the ammunition was stored in tanks situated near the mid-upper turret&#x27;s position and fed rearward in runways down the back of the fuselage to the turret.
Gunners using both the FN-20 and 120 removed perspex and armour from the turret to improve visibility, but trials by the RAF showed that a de Havilland Mosquito night fighter was still able to get within a very short distance of the tail gunner without being spotted, confirming what the Luftwaffe had already realised. The Rose turret attempted to improve on the FN turrets by being completely open to the rear (improving visibility and allowing easier emergency egress) and by being fitted with two machine guns. It was installed in a small number of Lancasters but never became common.

Ultimately radar, rather than improved visibility, made the turret more effective. The FN-121 was the Automatic Gun Laying Turret (AGLT), an FN-120 fitted with &#x27;Village Inn&#x27; gun-laying radar. Aircraft fitted with Village Inn were used as bait, flying behind the main formations to confront the night fighters that followed the formations and shot down stragglers. This significantly reduced operational losses; and gun-laying radar was added to the last versions of the turret. Before the end of the war, Lancasters built in the UK standardised on the FN-82 fitted with two machine guns and a gun-laying radar as production allowed, which was also used on early models of the Avro Lincoln. The disadvantage of all radar and radio transmitting systems is that attacking forces can locate aircraft by picking up transmissions.

====Bombs====

An important feature of the Lancaster was its unobstructed long bomb bay. At first, the heaviest bomb carried was the high capacity HC &quot;Cookie&quot;. Bulged doors were added to 30 per cent of B.Is to allow the aircraft to carry and later &quot;Cookies&quot;. The Lancaster also carried a variety of smaller weapons, including the Small Bomb Container (SBC) which held 236 or 24 incendiary and explosive incendiary bomblets; and General Purpose High Explosive (GP/HE) bombs (these came in a variety of designs); parachute deployed magnetic or acoustic mines, or armour-piercing (AP) bombs; Semi-Armour-Piercing (SAP) bombs, used up to 1942 against submarines; post-1942: or anti-submarine depth charges.

In 1943, 617 Squadron was created to carry out Operation Chastise, the raid against the Ruhr dams. This unit was equipped with B.III (Specials), officially designated the &quot;Type 464 (Provisioning)&quot;, modified to carry the &quot;Upkeep&quot; bouncing bomb. The bomb bay doors were removed and the ends of the bomb bay were covered with fairings. &quot;Upkeep&quot; was suspended on laterally pivoted, vee-shaped struts which sprang apart beamwise when the bomb-release button was pressed. A drive belt and pulley to rotate the bomb at 500 rpm was mounted on the starboard strut and driven by a hydraulic motor housed in the forward fairing. The mid-upper turret was removed and a more bulbous bomb aimer&#x27;s blister was fitted; this, as &quot;Mod. 780&quot;, later became standard on all Lancasters, while the bombsight was replaced by a simple aiming device that consisted of a simple triangle of wood with a peephole at one corner and a nail in each of the other corners such that at the correct distance the nails coincided with the towers on the dams. Because each dam was a different width between the towers, each plane carried two or three different sights. Two Aldis lights were fitted in the rear bomb bay fairing, aimed forward so the bomb aimer could see the converging lights below his blister in the nose; the optimum height for dropping &quot;Upkeep&quot; was and, when shone on the relatively smooth waters of the dam&#x27;s reservoirs, the light beams converged into a figure 8 when the Lancaster was flying at the correct height.
The Type 464 Lancaster was also fitted with VHF radios (normally reserved for fighters) so that Gibson, the squadron leader, could control the operation while over the target, an early example of what became the master bomber role.

After the &#x27;Dam Busters&#x27; raid 617 Squadron was converted to a high-altitude precision bombing squadron in preparation for the arrival of Barnes Wallis&#x27;s forthcoming Earthquake bombs for attacking special and hardened targets, and while they were training for this the bouncing bomb variants of B.I Specials had the spars and equipment removed and were then modified to carry the long &quot;Tallboy&quot; bomb, a scaled-down version of the upcoming long &quot;Grand Slam&quot; &quot;earthquake&quot; bombs which were still being built. Aircraft intended to carry the &quot;Grand Slam&quot; required extensive modifications. These included the removal of the dorsal turret and of two guns from the rear turret, the removal of the cockpit armour plating (the pilot&#x27;s seatback), and the installation of Rolls-Royce Merlin Mk 24 engines for better take-off performance. The bomb bay doors were removed and the rear end of the bomb bay cut away to clear the tail of the bomb. Later the nose turret was also removed to further improve performance. A strengthened undercarriage and stronger mainwheels, later used by the Avro Lincoln, were fitted.

Specific bomb loads were standardised and given code names by Bomber Command:



=====Bombsights=====
Bombsights used on Lancasters included:
;Mark IX Course Setting Bomb Sight (CSBS).
:This was an early preset vector bombsight that involved squinting through wires that had to be manually set based on aircraft speed, altitude and bombload. This sight lacked tactical flexibility as it had to be manually adjusted if any of the parameters changed and was soon changed in favour of more advanced designs.
;Mark XIV bombsight
:A vector bombsight where the bomb aimer input details of the bombload, target altitude and wind direction and the analogue computer then continuously calculated the trajectory of the bombs and projected an inverted sword shape onto a sighting glass on the sighting head. Assuming the sight was set correctly when the target was in the crosshairs of the sword shape, the bomb aimer would be able to accurately release the bombs.
;T1 bombsight
:A Mark XIV bombsight modified for mass production and produced in the USA. Some of the pneumatic gyro drives on the Mk XIV sight were replaced with electronic gyros and other minor modifications were made.
;Stabilizing Automatic Bomb Sight
:Also known as &quot;SABS&quot;, this was an advanced bombsight mainly used by 617 Squadron for precision raids. Like the American Norden bombsight it was a tachometric sight.

===Radio, radar and countermeasures equipment===
The Lancaster had a very advanced communications system for its time. Most British-built Lancasters were fitted with the R1155 receiver and T1154 transmitter, whereas the Canadian-built aircraft and those built for service in the Far East had American radios. These provided radio direction-finding, as well as voice and Morse capabilities.

; H2S
: 3 GHz frequency, ground-looking navigation radar system – eventually, it could be homed in on by the German night fighters&#x27; FuG 350 &quot;Naxos&quot; receiver and had to be used with discretion – a problem which the higher resolution, 10 GHz frequency American H2X radar never had to deal with. This is the large blister under the rear fuselage on later Lancasters.
; Fishpond
: An add-on to H2S that provided additional (aerial) coverage of the underside of the aircraft to display attacking fighters on an auxiliary screen in the radio operator&#x27;s position.
; Monica
: A rearward-looking radar to warn of night fighter approaches. However, it could not distinguish between attacking enemy fighters and nearby friendly bombers and served as a homing beacon for suitably equipped German night fighters. Once this was realised after mid-July 1944, it was removed altogether.
; GEE
: A receiver for a navigation system of synchronised pulses transmitted from the UK – aircraft calculated their position from the time delay between pulses. The range of GEE was . GEE used a whip aerial mounted on the top of the fuselage ahead of the mid-upper turret.
; Boozer (radar detector)
: A system of lights mounted on the aircraft&#x27;s instrument panel that lit up when the aircraft was being tracked by the low-UHF band &quot;Würzburg-Riese&quot; ground radar and early model Lichtenstein B/C and C-1 airborne radar. In practice, it was found to be more disconcerting than useful, as the lights were often triggered by false alerts in the radar-signal-infested skies over Germany.
; Oboe
: A very accurate navigation system consisting of a receiver/transponder for two radar stations transmitting from widely separated locations in Southern England which, when used together, determined the aircraft&#x27;s position. The system could handle only one aircraft at a time, and was fitted to a Pathfinder aircraft, usually a fast and manoeuvrable Mosquito which marked the target for the main force rather than a Lancaster.
; GEE-H
: Similar to Oboe but with the transponder on the ground allowing more aircraft to use the system simultaneously. GEE-H aircraft were usually marked with two horizontal yellow stripes on the fins.
; &quot;Village Inn&quot; Automatic Gun-Laying Turret
: A radar-aimed and ranged gun turret fitted to some Lancaster rear turrets in 1944. Identifiable by a radome mounted below the turret.
; Airborne Cigar (ABC)
: This was fitted only to the Lancasters of 101 Squadron. It had three aerials, two on the top of the fuselage and one under the bomb aimer&#x27;s position. These aircraft carried a German-speaking crew member and were used to jam ground-to-air communications to German night fighters. The extra equipment and extra crewman added around to the bomber&#x27;s weight so the bomb load was reduced by . Due to the nature of the equipment, the enemy was able to track the aircraft and 101 Squadron suffered the highest casualty rate of any squadron. Fitted from about mid-1943, they remained until the end of the war.
; Tinsel
: A microphone installed in the nacelle of one of the engines that allowed the wireless operator to transmit engine noise on the German night fighter control voice frequencies.

==Operational history==
===Second World War===

During early 1942, No. 44 Squadron, based at RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire, became the first RAF squadron to convert to the Lancaster; it was quickly followed by No. 97 Squadron, which was also based at Waddington. On 2 March 1942, the first operational mission of the Lancaster, deploying naval mines in the vicinity of Heligoland Bight, was performed by aircraft of No. 44 Sqn; a planned mission against the had been rescheduled due to poor weather conditions. On 10 March 1942, the type&#x27;s first bombing mission was conducted over the German city of Essen, North Rhine-Westphalia.

All Lancasters were temporarily grounded after a crash on 20 March in Boston, Lincolnshire; this was lifted after each aircraft had been inspected for signs of buckling on the upper wing surface. The first recorded casualties amongst Lancaster crews were recorded on 24 March 1942 with the loss of &quot;R5493&quot; to anti-aircraft fire over Lorient. Due to the high loss rates typically involved in such operations, daytime bombing missions were performed sparingly until the Allies had achieved a level of aerial supremacy over the Axis powers.

On 17 April 1942, 12 Lancasters of No. 44 and No. 99 Squadrons undertook a bombing raid on the Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-Nürnberg A.G., Augsburg engine manufacturing plant in Southern Germany; despite flying at low altitude, three bombers were shot down by Luftwaffe Bf 109s over France, and at least two more were lost to anti-aircraft fire at the factory itself. Nonetheless, the factory was successfully bombed, a feat that was personally hailed by Prime Minister Winston Churchill in the aftermath. The attack revealed the existence of the Lancaster to both Germany and the British public alike. On 27 April, an unsuccessful small-scale attack on the &quot;Tirpitz&quot; was performed by Lancasters of both No. 44 and No. 99 Squadrons.

On the night of 30/31 May 1942, the Lancaster participated in Operation Millenium, the first 1,000 bomber raid against the German city of Cologne. By this point, the number of Lancasters in operational service had surpassed those of the preceding Manchester. On 12 June, the first use of the type by RAF Coastal Command, having loaned aircraft from RAF Bomber Command, commenced; it was used to conduct long range anti-U-boat operations, reportedly attacking two on 15 June.

Additional large-scale raids were performed against Emden between 19 and 23 June, and against Bremen between 25 and 29 June, the latter reportedly dealing considerable damage to the Focke-Wulf aircraft works. 40 Lancasters also flew an ineffective long-range raid upon Danzig, arriving after dusk and thus unable to effectively bomb its port to disrupt U-boat construction. On 31 July, 20% of Bomber Command&#x27;s strength was directed against Dusseldorf, focused on Schiess A.G.&#x27;s machine tool manufacturing plant. The tempo of Lancaster operations rose to a new height in August 1942, major raids were flown against targets in the Ruhr, Duisburg, and in the Baltic Sea. An emphasis was placed upon aiding the Battle of the Atlantic by hindering the German Navy. Often, when the weather was deemed to be unsuitable for bombing missions, night-time mine-laying operations were flown instead.

A major improvement to night-time bombing came with the implementation of the Pathfinder Force (PFF) in August 1942, multiple squadrons were transferred from Bomber Command groups to constitute the new unit. These pathfinders were tasked with flying ahead of bomber formations to locate and mark targets using Target Indicator flares to improve the accuracy of strikes by the following aircraft. Early PFF operations produced mixed results, but did prove decisive on 27/28 August against Kassel and the three factories of the Henschel aircraft company in the city. That same night, 12 Lancasters of No. 106 Squadron flew to Gdynia, armed with newly developed anti-capital ship bombs, intending to hit the battleships &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau,&quot; as well as the aircraft carrier &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;, but did not manage to hit any ships due to a persistent haze.

While the Lancaster had been designed to conduct night-time operations, daylight raids were occasionally performed by the type as well. Occasionally, lone Lancasters would be dispatched to perform decoy raids on key manufacturing sites, such as munitions factories, with the intention of being spotted to cause workers to go to air raid shelters, thus disrupting production. On 17 October 1942, an audacious daytime raid was performed by 90 Lancasters of No. 5 Group, the bombing of the Schneider Works at Le Creusot, France; only a single aircraft, &quot;W4774&quot;, was lost during the course of the mission. Losses were avoided by measures such as flying beneath German radar cover, aerial reconnaissance along the intended route, and the strict observation of secrecy.

In late October 1942, the first Lancaster bombing missions over Italy were performed; on 22 and 23, the cities of Genoa and Turin were struck at night-time. On 24 October, the Italian city of Milan was raided by roughly 60 Lancasters during the daytime; railway infrastructure was a priority target for these attacks. These bombers had been escorted across the Channel by Spitfires before breaking formation to individually fly at low altitude to reach and fly over the Alps; a total of three were reportedly shot down by enemy fighters. During November, targets in Italy and Germany were alternatively attacked by Lancasters, striking the city of Osnabrück multiple times, conducting a heavy raid against Turin, and destroying supplies for the Afrika Korps in Genoa. Only eight bombing missions were conducted during all of December, the most prominent of which being against Duisburg, due to poor prevailing weather conditions.

Throughout 1942, the Lancaster remained in relatively short supply; consequently, both training and crew conversion courses typically had to be performed by the squadrons themselves; there were no aircraft furnished with dual controls at this time, and pilots would therefore have to perform their first flight without their instructors being capable of directly acting on the controls themselves. Furthermore, each Lancaster had its own ground crew early on; centralised servicing was introduced later. By the end of the year, a total of 16 operational squadrons had been stood up while around 200 Lancasters were under Bomber Command.

On 16 January 1943, the German capital city of Berlin was raided for the first time in over a year; conducted by an all-Lancaster force, the Berlin raid was fairly inconsequential beyond its psychological impact, not causing meaningful damage to either side. The first radial engined Lancasters were also introduced to service during January, alongside some new bombing aids. On 4 February, 198 Lancasters raided the city of Turin; days later, 466 Lancasters attacked Lorient, and an all-Lancaster force of 142 aircraft attacked Milan on 14 February. On 28 February, 86 Lancasters attacked the occupied French city of Saint-Nazaire; the next day, 79 Lancasters bombed Berlin. On 5 March, the Battle of the Ruhr strategic bombing campaign was launched by Bomber Command. The initial attack on Essen comprised 412 bombers, 140 of which were Lancasters. In order to cope with the higher attrition rate from these operations, a three-fold increase in production was enacted.

On 15 April, Stuttgart was raided by a large force of Lancasters; on the following day, Plzeň was similarly struck, although much of the intended attack upon the Škoda Works was unintentionally directed towards a large asylum instead; other targets that month included Stettin, Duisburg, and the Ruhr. The majority of strategic bombing missions flown during May were also directed towards the Ruhr region.

Perhaps the most famous single mission performed by the Lancaster was flown on 16–17 May 1943, codenamed Operation Chastise, to destroy the dams of the Ruhr Valley. The operation was carried out by No. 617 Squadron, which had been formed less than two months prior. They flew modified Lancaster Mk IIIs that were armed with special drum-shaped bouncing bombs; these had been specially designed by the British engineer Barnes Wallis; the Lancaster was the only bomber at the time capable of bearing the weapon. A total of 19 aircraft were dispatched on the operation, setting off in the evening and flying at very low altitudes most of the way to avoid detection. Initial attacks targeted the Mohne Dam until it was breached, then moved on to the Eder Dam, and then the Sorpe Dam and Ennepe Dam. The story of the operation was later made into a book, and subsequently a film, &quot;The Dam Busters&quot;.

The Ruhr continued to be intensely raided by Bomber Command for months following Operation Chastise with the aim of suppressing the region&#x27;s industrial output. In June, Lancasters begun operating in North Africa using the tactic of shuttle bombing from airfields in Blida and Maison Blanche. This was a key element of Operation Bellicose, the bombing of a German radar factory in the former Zeppelin Works at Friedrichshafen and the Italian naval base at La Spezia. On 12 July, an all-Lancaster force performed the biggest-yet bombing raid on Turin in support of the recently launched Italian Campaign. Further missions across the country were flown throughout this month, often focusing on electrical and railway infrastructure.
During late July and early August 1943, large numbers of Lancasters participated in the devastating round-the-clock raids on the city of Hamburg during Air Chief Marshal Harris&#x27;s Operation Gomorrah. On the night of 27 July, 787 RAF aircraft, comprising 74 Vickers Wellingtons, 116 Short Stirlings, 244 Handley Page Halifaxes and 353 Avro Lancasters, bombed the city. An estimated 18,474 people died on this night alone, despite many of victims being within air raid shelters and cellars, as the widespread fires across the city led to carbon monoxide poisoning. Altogether, 8,621 tons of bombs were dropped on Hamburg by the end of the operation.

On the night of 17/18 August, Operation Hydra was conducted against the Peenemünde Army Research Center, the site of the V-2 rocket and other German guided missiles and munitions; 17 Lancasters were lost in the costly but successful attack, mainly to German night fighters. Five days later, Lancasters struck numerous chemical works across Germany, including those in Leverkusen and Düsseldorf. On 23 August, a major raid on Berlin was conducted, dropping roughly 1,700 tons of bombs on the city; German night fighters responded, causing a 5.4% loss rate amongst Lancasters, while the Halifax and Stirling bombers suffered 8.8% and 12.9% loss rates respectively. Numerous strikes on the German capital occurred over the following weeks, sometimes by an all-Lancaster force.

In September, Hanover was subjected to the most concentrated bombing raid of the war so far. In October, the widespread bombing of numerous German cities took place, targeting Munich, Kassel, Frankfurt, Offenbach, Ludwigshafen, Stuttgart, Friedrichshafen, and Leipzig, along with other targets. By this point, the Royal Canadian Air Force had stood up its own operational squadrons equipped with Lancasters, and proceeded with offensive action over Germany in this same month.

In late 1943, Air Chief Marshal Harris advocated to Churchill for the persistent bombing of Berlin in preference to earlier targets such as the Ruhr. Between 15 November 1943 and 24 November 1944, sixteen major bombing operations were conducted against the German capital in the Battle of Berlin; of the 9,111 sorties flown, 7,256 had been performed by Lancasters. These raids, while often incurring in costly losses, were typically deemed to have been &#x27;most satisfactory&#x27; by senior officials. In March 1944, the Berlin raids were somewhat lessened as a compromise, Bomber Command having been directed to destroy enemy communications and other targets around France and the Low Countries ahead of the Normandy landings on D-Day.

During April 1944, key targets in France included railway hubs in Villeneuve, Rouen, and Juvisy. Special operations were flown against specific ammunition depots, munitions factories, and coastal batteries in advance of the Allied invasion. Around this time, Lancasters would also provide direct support to the local operations of field forces. By May, Bomber Command had a daily average operating strength of roughly 1,100 aircraft, 616 of which were Lancasters, 354 were Halifaxes, 72 Mosquitos, and 58 Stirlings; between 300 and 400 bombers were being deployed every night, dependent on weather conditions. In May and June, extensive operations were flown against the fortifications of the Atlantic Wall. The first combat use of Barnes Wallis&#x27; &#x27;Tallboy&#x27; bombs occurred around this time.

On 14 June, the first large-scale daylight bombing raid since 1942 was conducted using Lancasters against enemy shipping at the harbours of Le Havre and Boulogne. These daylight raids quickly became frequent as, due to a shortage of oil, the Luftwaffe were increasingly incapable of mounting opposition; to further this difficulty for their opponent, Lancasters were directed against numerous oil installations. In conjunction, low-level nighttime bombing raids continued, but the emphasis shifted away from the strategic bombing of German industry in favour of directly attacking military concentrations, such as U-boat pens and V-1 flying bomb launch sites.

During July, in the days following the Normandy landings, Lancasters heavily bombed the city of Caen repeatedly. On 24 August, eight Tallboys were dropped in a daylight attack on the U-boat pens at IJmuiden, two direct hits were recorded. Multiple raids on V-1 launch sites and enemy shipping were also performed during August; the partially constructed battleship &quot;Clemenceau&quot; was one of the targets that were struck around this time. September saw a heavy focus on airfields in Holland, as well as repeated raids on German-held Le Havre and oil targets in the Ruhr. On 17 September, precision strikes were performed on Boulogne only 200 yards from the Allied lines.

In October, Lancasters repeatedly struck the sea wall at Westkapelle, seeing to prevent the Germans from intentionally flooding neighbouring lands to delay Allied ground forces. Extensive daylight raids were performed during the month; cities such as Cologne, Walcheren, and Bergen were targeted by hundreds of Lancasters. Bomber operations proceeded in both day and nighttime against industrial towns, airfields, communications, and troop concentrations into December; one such operation was flown against the E-boat pens at Rotterdam on 29 December.

Throughout the latter half of 1944, a series of high-profile bombing missions were performed by the Lancaster against the . Executed by Nos. 617 and 9 Sqns, a combination of Lancaster B.I and B.III bombers were armed with Tallboy bombs and were adapted with enlarged bomb bay doors in order to accommodate their special payloads and additional fuel tanks to provide the necessary endurance. A total of three attacks, individually codenamed Operation Paravane, Operation Obviate and Operation Catechism, were conducted against &quot;Tirpitz&quot;, which was anchored in a fjord in Occupied Norway. The first of these attacks disabled the vessel while the third mission was responsible for sinking the ship. Due to actions such as Operation Chastise and the sinking of &quot;Tirpitz&quot;, No. 617 Sqn was perhaps the most famous of all Lancaster squadrons.

On 1 January 1945, the Dortmund–Ems Canal was attacked by Lancasters, hitting it at a vulnerable section near Ladbergen. An attack on Pforzheim on 23 February was described by aviation author Bruce Robertson as amongst the most concentrated and successful flown in the conflict. In the final months of the war, Lancasters were encountering the newly developed Messerschmitt Me 262, the first German jet-powered fighter aircraft, sometimes flying in formations of up to 40 aircraft. On 4 November 1944, a Lancaster of 428 squadron was attacked by a Me 262, which was shot down by the rear gunner Ben Rakus. The pilot F.W. Walker noted that this was the first instance of a heavy bomber shooting down a jet. 

During early 1945, a total of 33 Lancaster B.Is were modified so that they could deploy the Grand Slam bomb, the heaviest conventional bomb to be used during the conflict. On 13 March 1945, the first operational use of the Grand Slam was performed by a Lancaster of No. 617 Sqn against the Bielefeld viaduct in North Rhine-Westphalia; this target had not yet been rendered inoperable despite being damaged by prior conventional bombing. The Tallboy strike successfully destroyed roughly 100 yards of the viaduct&#x27;s length; additional viaducts, such as at Arnsberg, were promptly targeted by the squadron thereafter.

By April 1945, there were in excess of 1,000 Lancasters in frontline service, dwarfing the numbers of Halifaxes and Mosquitos (a light bomber) operated by Bomber Command at that time. Key industrial sites, such as the Auguste Viktoria benzol factory, were struck, while oil installations continued to be a prominent target of bombing raids in the hope of exacerbating the German fuel shortage. Amongst the final wartime operations performed by the Lancaster was the Bombing of Obersalzberg, aimed at the destruction of &quot;Eagle&#x27;s Nest&quot;, the extensive holiday home complex used by German leader Adolf Hitler. Unusually, the BBC were permitted to announce the raid before it was completed.

RAF Lancasters dropped food into the Holland region of the occupied Netherlands, with the acquiescence of the occupying German forces, to feed people who were in danger of starvation. The mission was named &#x27;Operation Manna&#x27; after the food manna which is said to have miraculously appeared for the Israelites in the Book of Exodus. The aircraft involved were from 1, 3, and 8 Groups, and consisted of 145 Mosquitos and 3,156 Lancasters, flying between them a total of 3,298 sorties. The first of the two RAF Lancasters chosen for the test flight was nicknamed &quot;Bad Penny&quot; from the old expression: &quot;a bad penny always turns up.&quot; This bomber, with a crew of seven men (five Canadians including pilot Robert Upcott of Windsor, Ontario), took off in bad weather on the morning of 29 April 1945 without a ceasefire agreement from the German forces, and successfully dropped its cargo.

====Assessment====
The Lancaster conducted a total of 156,000 sorties and dropped of bombs between 1942 and 1945. Only 35 Lancasters completed more than 100 successful operations each, and 3,249 were lost in action. The most successful survivor completed 139 operations and was ultimately retired from service and scrapped in 1947. From 1942 onwards, the Lancaster became the mainstay of the British heavy bomber fleet; by the end of the war in Europe, there were roughly 50 squadrons equipped with the Lancaster, the majority of these being the Lancaster B.I model. From its entry into service, the original model of the Lancaster was operated in almost every major bombing raid of the European conflict.

Adolf Galland (commander of the Luftwaffe fighters) considered the Lancaster to be &quot;the best night bomber of the war&quot;, as did his adversary, Arthur &quot;Bomber&quot; Harris, who referred to it as Bomber Command&#x27;s &quot;shining sword&quot;. Goulding and Garbett wrote that: &quot;The achievements of the Lancaster and the men who flew it have been widely acclaimed, and the aircraft has been described as the greatest single factor in winning WWII, an exaggeration but a pardonable one&quot;.

Lancasters from Bomber Command were to have formed the main strength of Tiger Force, the Commonwealth bomber contingent scheduled to take part in Operation Downfall, the codename for the planned invasion of Japan in late 1945. Aircraft allocated to the Tiger Force were painted in white with black undersides and outfitted with additional radio units and navigational aids to facilitate their use in the Pacific theatre. The addition of large saddle-type external fuel tanks was considered and trialled in Australia and India, but this was discontinued due to their perceived vulnerability to attack. Together with the new Avro Lincoln and Liberators, the bombers would have operated from bases on Okinawa; the envisioned invasion did not happen when such action was made unnecessary by the surrender of Japan.

While the Lancaster was briefly considered for carrying the atomic bomb as being one of the two Allied bombers capable of carrying the atomic bomb internally, after the Boeing B-29 Superfortress began to be modified in November 1943 for carrying the new bombs, the suggestion for using the Lancaster never came up again. Using the Lancaster would have required less modification to the aircraft itself, but would have necessitated additional crew training for the USAAF crews. In addition, the Lancaster had a lower ceiling and flew slower so was at risk of the bomb blast. It also had a shorter range. &quot;The B-29 was, therefore, deemed the better bet if it could be modified in time.&quot;. Major General Leslie Groves, the director of the Manhattan Project, and General Henry H. Arnold, the Chief of United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), wished to use an American plane if this was at all possible. &quot;Because the use of a British plane would have caused us many difficulties and delays&quot;

As a byproduct of its sound design and operational success, various developments and derivatives of the Lancaster were produced for both military and civilian purposes. One of these was the Avro Lincoln bomber, initially designated Lancaster IV and Lancaster V which became the Lincoln B.1 and B.2 respectively. A civilian airliner was converted from the Lancaster with the addition of nose and tail fairings and seats, as the Lancastrian and a similar aircraft was derived from the Lincoln as the Lincolnian. Other developments included the York, a transport with a much larger square section fuselage, and via the Lincoln, the Shackleton maritime patrol aircraft which continued in RAF service in that role until replaced by the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod in the early 1970s, but saw further service as an airborne early warning (AEW) system until finally retired in 1991. The Tudor airliner also used the Lincoln wings, but with a new tubular fuselage.

===After the war===
====Royal Air Force====
The Lancaster remained in use for several years after the end of the war, during which a number of high-profile operations were conducted.

During the summer of 1946, No. 35 Squadron Lancasters toured the United States and were autographed by various American movie stars, and retained these until their retirements. A pair of Lancasters, &quot;PD328&quot; and &quot;PB873&quot;, performed several long-distance flights, including round-the-world and trans-polar trips.

The Lancaster remained at the forefront of RAF Bomber Command while the Lancaster B.I was gradually replaced by the improved Lancaster B.I (F/E) and B.VII (F/E) models. During 1947–1948, No. 82 Squadron received new PR.1 dedicated photo-reconnaissance model derived from the Lancaster B.1 which was painted silver and lacked defensive turrets. These carried out aerial surveys of Central and East Africa and at least one was operated by the Ministry of Aviation. RAF Coastal Command received a small number of grey-painted Lancaster MR.1s, which were normally based at RAF Kinloss, Moray Firth.

The Lancaster continued to be operated in significant numbers until the introduction of the Avro Lincoln, a development of the Lancaster. The Lincoln was not available in quantity for several years following the end of the conflict, and it took until December 1953 for the final Bomber Command Lancaster to be retired. The last Lancaster in active service with the RAF, a reconnaissance aircraft, is believed to have been retired in late 1954.

====French Aéronavale====
Avro overhauled 59 Lancaster B.Is and B.VIIs at Woodford and Langar which were delivered to the French &quot;Aéronavale&quot; during 1952/53, which were flown until the mid-1960s by four squadrons stationed in France and New Caledonia in the maritime reconnaissance and search-and-rescue roles.

====Argentine Air Force====
Between 1948 and 1949, 15 former RAF Lancasters were overhauled at Langar for use by the Argentine Air Force. During its Argentine service, Lancasters were used offensively in suppressing and supporting military coups.

====Royal Canadian Air Force====

Beginning in 1946, Lancaster Mk Xs were modified for service with the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). Fourteen were modified to perform aerial and photo-reconnaissance missions; these would go on to perform much of the mapping of northern Canada until as late as 1962. Throughout the 1950s, the RCAF operated seventy modified Lancasters, designated &quot;Lancaster 10MR/MPs&quot;, as Maritime Reconnaissance and Patrol aircraft in an anti-submarine role. Modifications involved the installation of radar and sonobuoy operators&#x27; positions, removal of the rear and mid-upper gun turrets, installation of a 400-gallon fuel tank in the bomb bay to increase the patrol range, upgraded electronics, radar, and instrumentation, and a cooking stove in the centre section. They served throughout the 1950s, when they were supplemented by the Lockheed Neptune and finally replaced by the Canadair Argus.

====Transport====
Immediately following the end of hostilities, the Lancaster was used without any major modifications as a transport aircraft, being used to ferry thousands of prisoners of war (POWs) back to the British Isles from across the continent. Repatriation flights returning POWs and ordinary troops continued until November 1945.

Civil conversions of the type continued during the initial postwar years. In 1946, four Lancasters were converted by Avro at Bracebridge Heath, Lincolnshire as freighters for use by British South American Airways, but proved to be uneconomical, and were withdrawn after a year in service. In addition, four Lancaster IIIs were converted by Flight Refuelling Limited as two pairs of tanker and receiver aircraft for the development of in-flight refuelling. In 1947, one aircraft was flown non-stop from London to Bermuda. Later on, these two tanker aircraft were joined by another converted Lancaster; these saw use during the Berlin Airlift, achieving 757 tanker sorties.

From 1943 to 1947, the Canadian Government Trans-Atlantic Air Service (CGTAS) provided a trans-Atlantic military passenger and postal delivery service using a modified long-distance transport version of the Lancaster Mark X. Nine of these aircraft were produced, referred to as Lancaster XPPs (for Lancaster Mk.X Passenger Planes), and each was equipped with rudimentary passenger facilities. The inaugural flight from Dorval (Montreal) to Prestwick, Scotland on 22 July 1943, was completed non-stop in a record 12:26 hours; the average crossing time was about 13:25 hours. By the end of the war, these aircraft had completed hundreds of trips across the Atlantic. CGTAS ushered in the era of commercial air travel across the North Atlantic, and in 1947 the service became part of Trans-Canada Air Lines, which carried paying civilian passengers in the Lancaster XPPs until they were replaced by Douglas DC-4s in 1947.

==Variants==
: The original Lancasters were produced with Rolls-Royce Merlin XX engines and SU carburettors. Minor details were changed throughout the production series – for example, the pitot head design was changed from being on a long mast at the front of the nose to a short fairing mounted on the side of the fuselage under the cockpit. Later production Lancasters had Merlin 22 and 24 engines. No designation change was made to denote these alterations.

; B.I Special

: 32 Aircraft were adapted to take first the super-heavy &quot;Tallboy&quot; and then &quot;Grand Slam&quot; bombs. Up-rated engines with paddle-bladed propellers gave more power, and the removal of gun turrets reduced weight and gave smoother lines. For the Tallboy, the bomb bay doors were bulged; for the Grand Slam, they were removed completely and the area faired over. For some Tallboy raids, the mid-upper turret was removed. This modification was retained for the Grand Slam aircraft, and in addition, the nose turret was later removed. Two airframes (&quot;HK541&quot; and &quot;SW244&quot;) were modified to carry a dorsal &quot;saddle tank&quot; with mounted aft of a modified canopy for increasing range. No. 1577 SD Flight tested the aircraft in India and Australia in 1945 for possible use in the Pacific, but the tank adversely affected handling characteristics when full and an early type of in-flight refuelling designed in the late 1930s for commercial flying boats was later used instead.
; PR.1
: B 1 modified for photographic reconnaissance, operated by RAF No. 82 and No. 541 Squadrons, wartime. All armament and turrets were removed with a reconfigured nose and a camera carried in the bomb bay. The type was also operated by 683(PR) Squadron when it was re-formed in November 1950 to undertake photographic reconnaissance and mapping activities, initially based at RAF Fayid, Egypt, before moving to RAF Kabrit in February 1951, and subsequently Habbaniya in Iraq until the squadron was disbanded on 30 November 1953.

;B.I (FE)
:In anticipation of the needs of the Tiger Force operations against the Japanese in the Far East (FE), a tropicalised variant was based on late production aircraft. The B.I (FE) had modified radio, radar, nav-aids, and a tank installed in the bomb bay. Most were painted with white upper surfaces to reduce internal temperatures in the tropical sun, and black undersides with a low demarcation between the colours, completely omitting any red colours on the national insignia in all cases to avoid confusion with the &quot;hinomaru&quot; insignia of the Japanese.

; B.II

: Bristol Hercules (Hercules VI or XVI engines) powered variant, of which 300 were produced by Armstrong Whitworth. One difference between the two engine versions was that the VI had manual mixture control, requiring an extra lever on the throttle pedestal. Very early examples were fitted with an FN.64 ventral turret; however, these were quickly removed due to problems with aiming the turret through its periscope (which prevented the gunner from seeing a target he was not already aiming at), and inadequate traverse speed.

:Due to the Luftwaffe &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; attacks, a variety of unofficial field modifications were made, including the fitting of cannon or a machine gun in the open hole where the FN.64 had been installed, before an official modification (Mod 925) fitted with a machine gun was authorised for the same location, though not used in all aircraft. These were rarely installed on other variants as the H2S radar was usually installed, however the B.II&#x27;s bulged bomb bay interfered with its installation, leaving the opening free. Three types of bulged bomb bay were used on the B.II, the prototype having a narrow bulge running from just aft of the cockpit to the turret location, while early production examples had a full-width bulge that ran the same length and on late production examples, the bomb bay doors prominently bulged throughout their length.
:This variant, which was built concurrently with the B.I and was indistinguishable externally from that variant, was fitted with Packard-built Merlin engines. The Packard Merlins used Bendix – Stromberg pressure-injection carburettors, requiring the addition of slow-running cut-off switches in the cockpit.

;B.III (Special)

:Known at the time of modification as the &quot;Type 464 Provisioning&quot; Lancaster, 23 aircraft of this type were built to carry the &quot;Upkeep&quot; bouncing bomb for the dam busting raids. The bomb bay doors were removed and Vickers-built struts to carry the bomb were fitted in their place at Woodford Aerodrome near Stockport where the workers worked day and night. A hydraulic motor, driven by the pump previously used for the mid-upper turret was fitted to spin the bomb. Lamps were fitted in the bomb bay and nose for the simple height measurement system which enabled the accurate control of low-flying altitude at night. The mid-upper turret was removed to save weight and the gunner moved to the front turret to relieve the bomb aimer from having to man the front guns so that he could assist with map reading.

;ASR.III/ASR.3
:B.III modified for air-sea rescue, with three dipole ventral antennas fitted aft of the radome and carrying an airborne lifeboat in an adapted bomb bay. The armament was often removed and the mid-upper turret faired-over, especially in postwar use. Observation windows were added to both sides of the rear fuselage, a port window just forward of the tailplane and a starboard window into the rear access door. A number of ASR 3 conversions were fitted with Lincoln-style rudders.
;GR.3/MR.3
:B.III modified for maritime reconnaissance.

;B.IV
:The B.IV featured an increased wingspan and lengthened fuselage and new Boulton Paul F turret (two X 0.5in Browning machine guns) with framed &quot;bay window&quot; nose glazing. The prototypes (&quot;PW925&quot;, &quot;PW929&quot; and &quot;PW932&quot;) were powered by two-stage Merlin 85s inboard and later, Merlin 68s on the outboard mounts. Because of the major redesign, the aircraft was quickly renamed Lincoln B 1.

;B.V
:Increased wingspan and lengthened fuselage, two-stage Merlin 85s. Renamed Lincoln B 2.

;B.VI
:Nine aircraft converted from B.IIIs. Fitted with Merlin 85/87 which had two-stage superchargers, giving much improved high-altitude performance. The B VI could achieve a maximum speed of at at a takeoff weight and a service ceiling of at the same weight. Climb to at takeoff weight was accomplished in 44.8 minutes with a maximum climb rate of 1,080 ft/min (5.5 m/s) at . A Lancaster B VI was dived to a maximum indicated speed of , or Mach 0.72 at in June 1944. The Merlin 85/87 series engines were fitted with annular cowlings similar to the Avro Lincoln and three-bladed paddle-type propellers were fitted. These aircraft were used by only Pathfinder units; by No. 7 Squadron RAF, No. 83 Squadron RAF, No. 405 Squadron RCAF and by No. 635 Squadron RAF. Often used as a &quot;Master Bomber&quot; the B VIs were allocated to RAF Bomber Command apart from two that were retained by Rolls-Royce for installation and flight testing. Their dorsal and nose turrets were removed and faired over. The more powerful engines proved troublesome in service and were disliked by ground maintenance staff for their rough running and propensity to &#x27;surge and hunt&#x27;, making synchronisation impossible. This was caused by variations in the fuel/air mixture and over time would damage the engine. The B VI was withdrawn from operational service in November 1944 and surviving aircraft were used by Rolls-Royce, the Royal Aircraft Establishment and the Bomb Ballistics Unit (BBU) for various testing and experimental duties.

;B.VII
:The B.VII was the final production version of the Lancaster. The Martin 250CE mid-upper turret was moved slightly further forward than on previous Marks and the Nash &amp; Thomson FN-82 tail turret with twin Browning machine guns replaced the FN.20 turret with four Browning .303 Mark IIs. The Martin turret carried two 0.5-inch Browning Mark II machine guns which packed much more punch than the .303s of the older turret. However, these Martin turrets arrived too late for inclusion in the first 50 aircraft built by Austin and these were therefore referred to as Mark VII (Interim). Another 180 true Mark VIIs were built at Longbridge. Two sub-variants of the VII existed, the &quot;Far East&quot; (B VII FE) for use in tropical climates and the B VII &quot;Western Union&quot;, which went to France.

;B.X

:The B.X was a Canadian-built B.III with Canadian- and US-made instruments and electrics. In later batches, the heavier Martin 250CE was substituted for the Nash &amp; Thomson FN-50 mid-upper turret, mounted further forward to maintain centre of gravity balance. Canada was a long-term operator of the Lancaster, using modified aircraft after the war for maritime patrol, search and rescue and photo-reconnaissance until 1964. The last flight by the RCAF was by F/L Lynn Garrison in KB-976, on 4 July 1964 at the Calgary International Air Show.
:During the Second World War, Canada&#x27;s Victory Aircraft (what later became Avro Canada) was responsible for the development of the Lancastrian, which was duly designated the XPP for &quot;Mark 10 Passenger Plane&quot;. Six were built for Trans Canada Airlines.
:Postwar the RCAF modified the B X (as the Lancaster Mk 10) to fill a variety of roles, with specific designations for each role. These included:
:* 10AR: &quot;Area Reconnaissance&quot; – three aircraft modified for surveillance operations over the Arctic. Fitted with the lengthened nose ( longer) and carrying cameras and ELINT equipment. Remained in service until 1964.
:* 10BR: &quot;Bomber Reconnaissance&quot;. Minimally modified variant with additional windows for observers in the rear fuselage. 13 converted.
:* 10DC: &quot;Drone controller&quot; with Ryan Firebee drones – two modified in 1957 and operational until 1961.
:* 10MR (later 10MP): &quot;Maritime Reconnaissance&quot; or &quot;Maritime Patrol&quot; anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft, based on BR with the mid-upper turret removed. 70–75 converted. In service from 1950 to 1955.
:* 10N: &quot;Navigational trainer&quot;. Five converted.
:* 10O: &quot;Orenda jet engine testbed&quot; for the engine used in the Avro CF-100.
:* 10P: &quot;Photo reconnaissance&quot; mapping duties. 11 converted 1948–1950. Retired 1964.
:* 10S&amp;R: Interim search-and-rescue aircraft, minimally modified 10S. Replaced by disarmed 10BR and 10MRs.
:* 10S : &quot;Standard&quot; – designation applied to baseline standard, with Merlin 224 engines, Martin mid-upper turret and H2S radar, for aircraft retained postwar for future use. Sometimes referred to by unofficial designation 10U.
;B.XV

:As per Lancaster B.IV/Lincoln B.1 but built in Canada and renamed Avro Lincoln XV. One example was built before the order was cancelled when the war ended.

==Surviving aircraft==

Of the 17 surviving and largely intact Lancasters known to exist, two are airworthy: PA474 is a Lancaster B.I operated by the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, based at RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire, UK; FM213, named the &quot;Mynarski Memorial Lancaster&quot; and painted with VR-A (nicknamed VeRA) to honour Andrew Mynarski, is a Lancaster B.X operated by the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.

Two other Lancasters exist with working engines, though not airworthy; like the airworthy pair, these are also found one each in Britain and Canada. The B MkVII &quot;Just Jane&quot;, NX611, is based in the East Kirkby Lincolnshire Aviation Heritage Centre, just east-northeast of PA474 at RAF Coningsby; it is able to taxi but is not airworthy, though there have been plans to eventually return it to flight. The Bomber Command Museum of Canada, in Nanton, Alberta, is home to FM159, nicknamed Bazalgette, which has been restored from a vandalised state and is able to taxi under its own power.

In 2014, the two airworthy Lancasters (Canadian FM213 and British PA474) toured the UK in a series of joint aerial and ground displays.

In 2017, after more than 50 years on display in Edmundston, New Brunswick, Lancaster KB 882 moved to the National Air Force Museum of Canada in Trenton, Ontario, where it is to be restored and placed alongside the museum&#x27;s restored RAF Handley Page Halifax heavy bomber, NA 337.

For the 2018 flying season, to commemorate the 75th anniversary of Operation Chastise, the Canadian FM213 Lancaster was painted in the markings used by Guy Gibson&#x27;s 617 Squadron aircraft (Code AJ-G, ED932) when he commanded the &quot;Dambusters&quot; raids.

<doc id="164331" wikidata="Q7537" url="?curid=164331" title="Cauliflower">
<text>Cauliflower is one of several vegetables cultivated from the species &quot;Brassica oleracea&quot; in the genus &quot;Brassica&quot;, which is in the Brassicaceae (or mustard) family.

An annual plant that reproduces by seed, the cauliflower head is composed of a (generally) white inflorescence meristem. Cauliflower heads resemble those in broccoli, which differs in having flower buds as the edible portion.

Only the head is typically eaten; the edible white flesh is sometimes called &quot;curd&quot;. The global cauliflower and broccoli production in 2020 was over 25.5 million tons, worth 14.1 billion US dollars.

== Description ==
There are four major groups of cauliflower.

# Italian: This specimen is diverse in appearance, biennial, and annual in type. This group includes white, Romanesco, and various brown, green, purple, and yellow cultivars. This type is the ancestral form from which the others were derived.
# Northern European annuals: These are used in Europe and North America for summer and fall harvests. They were developed in Germany in the 18th century and include the old cultivars Erfurt and Snowball.
# Northwest biennial: Used in Europe for winter and early spring harvest, developed in France in the 19th century and includes the old cultivars Angers and Roscoff.
# Asian: A tropical cauliflower used in China and India, it was developed in India during the 19th century from the now-abandoned Cornish type and includes old varieties Early Benaras and Early Patna.

=== Domestication ===
Cauliflowers are an &#x27;arrested inflorescence&#x27;  subspecies of &quot;B. oleracea&quot; that arose around 2,500 years ago. Genomic analysis finds initially evolved from broccoli with three MADS-box genes, playing roles in its curd formation. Nine loci and candidate genes are linked with morphological and biological characters.

=== Varieties ===
There are hundreds of historic and current commercial varieties used around the world. A comprehensive list of about 80 North American varieties is maintained at North Carolina State University.

=== Colors ===
; White: White cauliflower is the most common color of cauliflower, having a contrasting white head (also called &quot;curd&quot;, having a similar appearance to cheese curd), surrounded by green leaves.
; Orange: Orange cauliflower contains beta-carotene as the orange pigment, a provitamin A compound. This orange trait originated from a natural mutant found in a cauliflower field in Canada. Cultivars include &#x27;Cheddar&#x27; and &#x27;Orange Bouquet.&#x27;
; Green: Green cauliflower in the&quot; B. oleracea&quot; Botrytis Group is sometimes called broccoflower. It is available in the normal curd (head) shape and with a fractal spiral curd called Romanesco broccoli. Both have been commercially available in the U.S. and Europe since the early 1990s. Green-headed varieties include &#x27;Alverda, &#x27;Green Goddess,&#x27; and &#x27;Vorda.&#x27; Romanesco varieties include &#x27;Minaret&#x27; and &#x27;Veronica.&#x27;
; Purple: The purple color in this cauliflower is caused by the presence of anthocyanins, water-soluble pigments that are found in many other plants and plant-based products, such as red cabbage and red wine. Varieties include &#x27;Graffiti&#x27; and &#x27;Purple Cape.&#x27;
:In Great Britain and southern Italy, a broccoli with tiny flower buds is sold as a vegetable under the name &quot;purple cauliflower&quot;; it is not the same as standard cauliflower with a purple head.

=== Phytochemicals ===
Cauliflower contains several non-nutrient phytochemicals common in the cabbage family that are under preliminary research for their potential properties, including isothiocyanates and glucosinolates. Boiling reduces the levels of cauliflower glucosinolates, while other cooking methods, such as steaming, microwaving, and stir frying, have no significant effect on glucosinolate levels.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;cauliflower&quot; derives from the Italian &quot;cavolfiore&quot;, meaning &quot;cabbage flower&quot;. The ultimate origin of the name is from the Latin words &quot;caulis&quot; (cabbage) and &quot;flōs&quot; (flower).

== Cultivation ==
=== History ===
Cauliflower is the result of selective breeding and likely arose in the Mediterranean region, possibly from broccoli.

Pliny the Elder included &quot;cyma&quot; among cultivated plants he described in &quot;Natural History&quot;: &quot;Ex omnibus brassicae generibus suavissima est cyma&quot; (&quot;Of all the varieties of cabbage the most pleasant-tasted is &quot;cyma&quot;&quot;). Pliny&#x27;s description likely refers to the flowering heads of an earlier cultivated variety of &quot;Brassica oleracea&quot;.

In the Middle Ages, early forms of cauliflower were associated with the island of Cyprus, with the 12th- and 13th-century Arab botanists Ibn al-&#x27;Awwam and Ibn al-Baitar claiming its origin to be Cyprus. This association continued into Western Europe, where cauliflowers were sometimes known as Cyprus , and there was extensive trade in Western Europe in cauliflower seeds from Cyprus, under the French Lusignan rulers of the island, until well into the 16th century.

It is thought to have been introduced into Italy from Cyprus or the east coast of the Mediterranean around 1490 and then spread to other European countries in the following centuries.

François Pierre La Varenne employed &quot;chouxfleurs&quot; in &quot;Le cuisinier françois&quot;. They were introduced to France from Genoa in the 16th century and are featured in Olivier de Serres&#x27; &quot;Théâtre de l&#x27;agriculture&quot; (1600), as &quot;cauli-fiori&quot; &quot;as the Italians call it, which are still rather rare in France; they hold an honorable place in the garden because of their delicacy&quot;, but they did not commonly appear on grand tables until the time of Louis XIV. It was introduced to India in 1822 by the British.
==== Production ====
In 2020, global production of cauliflowers (combined for production reports with broccoli) was 25.5 million tonnes, led by China and India which, combined, had 72% of the world total. Secondary producers, having 0.4–1.3 million tonnes annually, were the United States, Spain, Mexico, and Italy.

=== Horticulture ===

Cauliflower is relatively difficult to grow compared to cabbage, with common problems such as an underdeveloped head and poor curd quality.

==== Climate ====
Because the weather is a limiting factor for producing cauliflower, the plant grows best in moderate daytime temperatures , with plentiful sun and moist soil conditions high in organic matter and sandy soils. The earliest maturity possible for cauliflower is 7 to 12 weeks from transplanting. In the northern hemisphere, fall season plantings in July may enable harvesting before autumn frost.

Long periods of sun exposure in hot summer weather may cause cauliflower heads to discolor with a red-purple hue.

==== Seeding and transplanting ====
Transplantable cauliflowers can be produced in containers such as flats, hotbeds, or fields. In soil that is loose, well-drained, and fertile, field seedlings are shallow-planted and thinned by ample space – about 12 plants per . Ideal growing temperatures are about when seedlings are 25 to 35 days old. Applications of fertilizer to developing seedlings begin when leaves appear, usually with a starter solution weekly.

Transplanting to the field normally begins in late spring and may continue until mid-summer. Row spacing is about .
Rapid vegetative growth after transplanting may benefit from such procedures as avoiding spring frosts, using starter solutions high in phosphorus, irrigating weekly, and applying fertilizer.

==== Disorders, pests, and diseases ====
The most important disorders affecting cauliflower quality are a hollow stem, stunted head growth or buttoning, ricing, browning, and leaf-tip burn. Among major pests affecting cauliflower are aphids, root maggots, cutworms, moths, and flea beetles. The plant is susceptible to black rot, black leg, club root, black leaf spot, and downy mildew.

==== Harvesting ====
When cauliflower is mature, heads appear clear white, compact, and in diameter, and should be cooled shortly after harvest. Forced air cooling to remove heat from the field during hot weather may be needed for optimal preservation. Short-term storage is possible using cool, high-humidity storage conditions.

==== Pollination ====
Many species of blowflies, including &quot;Calliphora vomitoria&quot;, are known pollinators of cauliflower.

== Uses ==

===Culinary===

Cauliflower heads can be roasted, grilled, boiled, fried, steamed, pickled, or eaten raw. When cooking, the outer leaves and thick stalks are typically removed, leaving only the florets (the edible &quot;curd&quot; or &quot;head&quot;). The leaves are also edible but are often discarded.

Cauliflower can be used as a low-calorie, gluten-free alternative to rice and flour. Between 2012 and 2016, cauliflower production in the United States increased by 63%, and cauliflower-based product sales increased by 71% between 2017 and 2018. Cauliflower rice is made by pulsing cauliflower florets and cooking the result in oil. Cauliflower pizza crust is made from cauliflower flour and is popular in pizza restaurants. Mashed cauliflower is a low-carbohydrate alternative to mashed potatoes.
=== Nutrition ===
Raw cauliflower is 92% water, 5% carbohydrates, 2% protein, and contains negligible fat (see table). A reference amount of raw cauliflower provides of food energy, and has a high content (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin C (58% DV) and moderate levels of several B vitamins and vitamin K (13–15% DV; table). Contents of dietary minerals are low (7% DV or less).

== In culture ==

Cauliflower has been noticed by mathematicians for its distinct fractal dimension, calculated to be roughly 2.8. One of the fractal properties of cauliflower is that every branch, or &quot;module&quot;, is similar to the entire cauliflower. Another quality, also present in other plant species, is that the angle between &quot;modules&quot;, as they become more distant from the center, is 360 degrees divided by the golden ratio.

The fancied resemblance of the shape of a boxer&#x27;s ear to a cauliflower gave rise to the term &quot;cauliflower ear&quot;.

<text>In art, chiaroscuro ( , ; ) is the use of strong contrasts between light and dark, usually bold contrasts affecting a whole composition. It is also a technical term used by artists and art historians for the use of contrasts of light to achieve a sense of volume in modelling three-dimensional objects and figures. Similar effects in cinema, and black and white and low-key photography, are also called chiaroscuro. Taken to its extreme, the use of shadow and contrast to focus strongly on the subject of a painting is called tenebrism.

Further specialized uses of the term include chiaroscuro woodcut for colour woodcuts printed with different blocks, each using a different coloured ink; and chiaroscuro for drawings on coloured paper in a dark medium with white highlighting.

Chiaroscuro originated in the Renaissance period but is most notably associated with Baroque art. Chiaroscuro is one of the canonical painting modes of the Renaissance (alongside cangiante, sfumato and unione) (see also Renaissance art). Artists known for using the technique include Leonardo da Vinci, Caravaggio, Rembrandt, Vermeer, Goya, and Georges de La Tour.

==History==
===Origin in the chiaroscuro drawing===

The term &quot;chiaroscuro&quot; originated during the Renaissance as drawing on coloured paper, where the artist worked from the paper&#x27;s base tone toward light using white gouache, and toward dark using ink, bodycolour or watercolour. These in turn drew on traditions in illuminated manuscripts going back to late Roman Imperial manuscripts on purple-dyed vellum. Such works are called &quot;chiaroscuro drawings&quot;, but may only be described in modern museum terminology by such formulae as &quot;pen on prepared paper, heightened with white bodycolour&quot;. Chiaroscuro woodcuts began as imitations of this technique. When discussing Italian art, the term sometimes is used to mean painted images in monochrome or two colours, more generally known in English by the French equivalent, grisaille. The term broadened in meaning early on to cover all strong contrasts in illumination between light and dark areas in art, which is now the primary meaning.

===Chiaroscuro modelling===

The more technical use of the term chiaroscuro is the effect of light modelling in painting, drawing, or printmaking, where three-dimensional volume is suggested by the value gradation of colour and the analytical division of light and shadow shapes—often called &quot;shading&quot;. The invention of these effects in the West, &quot;skiagraphia&quot; or &quot;shadow-painting&quot; to the Ancient Greeks, traditionally was ascribed to the famous Athenian painter of the fifth century BC, Apollodoros. Although few Ancient Greek paintings survive, their understanding of the effect of light modelling still may be seen in the late-fourth-century BC mosaics of Pella, Macedonia, in particular the &quot;Stag Hunt Mosaic&quot;, in the House of the Abduction of Helen, inscribed &quot;gnosis epoesen&quot;, or &#x27;knowledge did it&#x27;.

The technique also survived in rather crude standardized form in Byzantine art and was refined again in the Middle Ages to become standard by the early fifteenth-century in painting and manuscript illumination in Italy and Flanders, and then spread to all Western art.

According to the theory of the art historian Marcia B. Hall, which has gained considerable acceptance, chiaroscuro is one of four modes of painting colours available to Italian High Renaissance painters, along with &quot;cangiante&quot;, sfumato and &quot;unione&quot;.

The Raphael painting illustrated, with light coming from the left, demonstrates both delicate modelling chiaroscuro to give volume to the body of the model, and strong chiaroscuro in the more common sense, in the contrast between the well-lit model and the very dark background of foliage. To further complicate matters, however, the compositional chiaroscuro of the contrast between model and background probably would not be described using this term, as the two elements are almost completely separated. The term is mostly used to describe compositions where at least some principal elements of the main composition show the transition between light and dark, as in the Baglioni and Geertgen tot Sint Jans paintings illustrated above and below.

Chiaroscuro modelling is now taken for granted, but it has had some opponents; namely: the English portrait miniaturist Nicholas Hilliard cautioned in his treatise on painting against all but the minimal use we see in his works, reflecting the views of his patron Queen Elizabeth I of England: &quot;seeing that best to show oneself needeth no shadow of place but rather the open light... Her Majesty... chose her place to sit for that purpose in the open alley of a goodly garden, where no tree was near, nor any shadow at all...&quot;

In drawings and prints, modelling chiaroscuro often is achieved by the use of hatching, or shading by parallel lines. Washes, stipple or dotting effects, and &quot;surface tone&quot; in printmaking are other techniques.

===Chiaroscuro woodcuts===
Chiaroscuro woodcuts are old master prints in woodcut using two or more blocks printed in different colours; they do not necessarily feature strong contrasts of light and dark. They were first produced to achieve similar effects to chiaroscuro drawings. After some early experiments in book-printing, the true chiaroscuro woodcut conceived for two blocks was probably first invented by Lucas Cranach the Elder in Germany in 1508 or 1509, though he backdated some of his first prints and added tone blocks to some prints first produced for monochrome printing, swiftly followed by Hans Burgkmair the Elder. The formschneider or block-cutter who worked in the press of Johannes Schott in Strasbourg is claimed to be the first one to achieve chiaroscuro woodcuts with three blocks. Despite Vasari&#x27;s claim for Italian precedence in Ugo da Carpi, it is clear that his, the first Italian examples, date to around 1516 But other sources suggest, the first chiaroscuro woodcut to be the &quot;Triumph of Julius Caesar&quot;, which was created by Andrea Mantegna, an Italian painter, between 1470 and 1500. Another view states that: &quot;Lucas Cranach backdated two of his works in an attempt to grab the glory&quot; and that the technique was invented &quot;in all probability&quot; by Burgkmair &quot;who was commissioned by the emperor Maximilian to find a cheap and effective way of getting the imperial image widely disseminated as he needed to drum up money and support for a crusade&quot;.

Other printmakers who have used this technique include Hans Wechtlin, Hans Baldung Grien, and Parmigianino. In Germany, the technique achieved its greatest popularity around 1520, but it was used in Italy throughout the sixteenth century. Later artists such as Goltzius sometimes made use of it. In most German two-block prints, the keyblock (or &quot;line block&quot;) was printed in black and the tone block or blocks had flat areas of colour. In Italy, chiaroscuro woodcuts were produced without keyblocks to achieve a very different effect.

===Compositional chiaroscuro to Caravaggio===

Manuscript illumination was, as in many areas, especially experimental in attempting ambitious lighting effects since the results were not for public display. The development of compositional chiaroscuro received a considerable impetus in northern Europe from the vision of the Nativity of Jesus of Saint Bridget of Sweden, a very popular mystic. She described the infant Jesus as emitting light; depictions increasingly reduced other light sources in the scene to emphasize this effect, and the Nativity remained very commonly treated with chiaroscuro through to the Baroque. Hugo van der Goes and his followers painted many scenes lit only by candle or the divine light from the infant Christ. As with some later painters, in their hands the effect was of stillness and calm rather than the drama with which it would be used during the Baroque.

Strong chiaroscuro became a popular effect during the sixteenth century in Mannerism and Baroque art. Divine light continued to illuminate, often rather inadequately, the compositions of Tintoretto, Veronese, and their many followers. The use of dark subjects dramatically lit by a shaft of light from a single constricted and often unseen source, was a compositional device developed by Ugo da Carpi (c. 1455 – c. 1523), Giovanni Baglione (1566–1643), and Caravaggio (1571–1610), the last of whom was crucial in developing the style of tenebrism, where dramatic chiaroscuro becomes a dominant stylistic device.

===17th and 18th centuries===

Tenebrism was especially practiced in Spain and the Spanish-ruled Kingdom of Naples, by Jusepe de Ribera and his followers. Adam Elsheimer (1578–1610), a German artist living in Rome, produced several night scenes lit mainly by fire, and sometimes moonlight. Unlike Caravaggio&#x27;s, his dark areas contain very subtle detail and interest. The influences of Caravaggio and Elsheimer were strong on Peter Paul Rubens, who exploited their respective approaches to tenebrosity for dramatic effect in paintings such as &quot;The Raising of the Cross&quot; (1610–1611). Artemisia Gentileschi (1593–1656), a Baroque artist who was a follower of Caravaggio, was also an outstanding exponent of tenebrism and chiaroscuro.

A particular genre that developed was the nocturnal scene lit by candlelight, which looked back to earlier northern artists such as Geertgen tot Sint Jans and more immediately, to the innovations of Caravaggio and Elsheimer. This theme played out with many artists from the Low Countries in the first few decades of the seventeenth century, where it became associated with the Utrecht Caravaggisti such as Gerrit van Honthorst and Dirck van Baburen, and with Flemish Baroque painters such as Jacob Jordaens. Rembrandt van Rijn&#x27;s (1606–1669) early works from the 1620s also adopted the single-candle light source. The nocturnal candle-lit scene re-emerged in the Dutch Republic in the mid-seventeenth century on a smaller scale in the works of fijnschilders such as Gerrit Dou and Gottfried Schalken.
Rembrandt&#x27;s own interest in effects of darkness shifted in his mature works. He relied less on the sharp contrasts of light and dark that marked the Italian influences of the earlier generation, a factor found in his mid-seventeenth-century etchings. In that medium he shared many similarities with his contemporary in Italy, Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione, whose work in printmaking led him to invent the monotype.

Outside the Low Countries, artists such as Georges de La Tour and Trophime Bigot in France and Joseph Wright of Derby in England, carried on with such strong, but graduated, candlelight chiaroscuro. Watteau used a gentle chiaroscuro in the leafy backgrounds of his fêtes galantes, and this was continued in paintings by many French artists, notably Fragonard. At the end of the century Fuseli and others used a heavier chiaroscuro for romantic effect, as did Delacroix and others in the nineteenth century.

==Use of the term==

The French use of the term, , was introduced by the seventeenth-century art-critic Roger de Piles in the course of a famous argument (&quot;Débat sur le coloris&quot;), on the relative merits of drawing and colour in painting (his &quot;Dialogues sur le coloris&quot;, 1673, was a key contribution to the &quot;Débat&quot;).

In English, the Italian term has been usedoriginally as and since at least the late seventeenth century. The term is less frequently used of art after the late nineteenth century, although the Expressionist and other modern movements make great use of the effect.

Especially since the strong twentieth-century rise in the reputation of Caravaggio, in non-specialist use the term is mainly used for strong chiaroscuro effects such as his, or Rembrandt&#x27;s. As the Tate puts it: &quot;Chiaroscuro is generally only remarked upon when it is a particularly prominent feature of the work, usually when the artist is using extreme contrasts of light and shade&quot;.

==Cinema and photography==

&quot;Chiaroscuro&quot; is used in cinematography for extreme low key and high-contrast lighting to create distinct areas of light and darkness in films, especially in black and white films. Classic examples are &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot; (1920), &quot;Nosferatu&quot; (1922), &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1927) &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; (1939), &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot; (1941), and the black and white scenes in Andrei Tarkovsky&#x27;s &quot;Stalker&quot; (1979).

For example, in &quot;Metropolis&quot;, chiaroscuro lighting creates contrast between light and dark mise-en-scene and figures. The effect highlights the differences between the capitalist elite and the workers.

In photography, chiaroscuro can be achieved by using &quot;Rembrandt lighting&quot;. In more highly developed photographic processes, the technique may be termed &quot;ambient/natural lighting&quot;, although when done so for the effect, the look is artificial and not generally documentary in nature. In particular, Bill Henson along with others, such as W. Eugene Smith, Josef Koudelka, Lothar Wolleh, Annie Leibovitz, Floria Sigismondi, and Ralph Gibson may be considered some of the modern masters of chiaroscuro in documentary photography.

Perhaps the most direct use of chiaroscuro in filmmaking is Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1975 film &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;. When informed that no lens then had a sufficiently wide aperture to shoot a costume drama set in grand palaces using only candlelight, Kubrick bought and retrofitted a special lens for the purpose: a modified Mitchell BNC camera and a Zeiss lens manufactured for the rigors of space photography, with a maximum aperture of f/0.7. The natural, unaugmented lighting of the sets in the film exemplified low-key, natural lighting in filmwork at its most extreme, outside of the Eastern European/Soviet filmmaking tradition (itself exemplified by the harsh low-key lighting style employed by Soviet filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein).

Sven Nykvist, the longtime collaborator of Ingmar Bergman, also informed much of his photography with chiaroscuro realism, as did Gregg Toland, who influenced such cinematographers as László Kovács, Vilmos Zsigmond, and Vittorio Storaro with his use of deep and selective focus augmented with strong horizon-level key lighting penetrating through windows and doorways. Much of the celebrated film noir tradition relies on techniques related to chiaroscuro that Toland perfected in the early 1930s (though high-key lighting, stage lighting, frontal lighting, and other film noir effects are interspersed in ways that diminish the chiaroscuro claim).
