<text>The Cagayan River, also known as the Río Grande de Cagayán, is the longest river and the largest river by discharge volume of water in the Philippines. It has a total length of approximately and a drainage basin covering . It is located in the Cagayan Valley region in northeastern part of Luzon Island and traverses the provinces of Nueva Vizcaya, Quirino, Isabela and Cagayan.

==Topography==
The river&#x27;s headwaters are at the Caraballo Mountains of the Central Luzon at an elevation of approximately . The river flows north for some to its mouth at the Babuyan Channel near the town of Aparri, Cagayan. The river drops rapidly to above sea level some from the river mouth. Its principal tributaries are the Pinacanauan, Chico, Siffu, Mallig, Magat and Ilagan Rivers.

Magat River, is the largest tributary with an estimated annual discharge of 9,808 million cubic meters. It lies in the southwestern portion of the basin, stretching approximately from Nueva Vizcaya down to its confluence with Cagayan River about from the river mouth.

Both Magat and Chico Rivers have extensive drainage areas which comprise about 1/3 of the whole basin.

The Ilagan River originates from the western slopes of the Sierra Madre and drains the eastern central portion of the Cagayan River basin with an estimated yearly discharge of 9,455 million cubic meters. It flows westward and joins the Cagayan River at Ilagan, Isabela, from the mouth.

The Siffu-Mallig system lies on the slope of the Central Cordillera ranges flowing almost parallel to the Magat River. Marshes and swamps are found in some parts of its lower reaches.

Cagayan River and its tributaries have deposited sediments of Tertiary and Quaternary origin, mostly limestone sands and clays, throughout the relatively flat Cagayan Valley which is surrounded by the Cordillera Mountains in the west, Sierra Madre in the east and the Caraballo Mountains in the south.

The river has a drainage area of about . in the provinces of Apayao, Aurora, Cagayan, Ifugao, Isabela, Kalinga, Mountain Province, Nueva Vizcaya, and Quirino.

The estimated annual discharge is 53,943 million cubic meters with a groundwater reserve of 47,895 million cubic meters.

==Flooding==
The Cagayan River and its tributaries are subject to extensive flooding during the monsoon season in Southeast Asia from May to October.

The average annual rainfall in in the northern part and in the southern mountains where the river&#x27;s headwaters lie. Water from the mountains flow down very slowly because of surface retention over the extensive flood plain, the gorges in the gently-sloping mountains and the meandering course of the river.

Inundations of the Cagayan River and its tributaries have caused great loss of life and property and substantial losses to the local and national economies. The Philippine government has established several flood warning stations along the river. Experts are specifically monitoring the lower reaches from Tuguegarao to Aparri and the alluvial plain from Ilagan to Tumauini, Isabela.

In November 2020, after the onslaught of Typhoon Vamco (Ulysses), the river reached its peak level and caused floods along its vicinity due to the rainfall accumulated from the typhoon. This flooding was one of the worst floods in the river&#x27;s history. The Magat Dam also contributed to the floods along the river when its floodgates opened due to a potential overflow.

==Flora and fauna==
The Cagayan River passes through one of the few remaining primary forests in the Philippines.

It supports the lives of numerous endemic and endangered species, like the Luzon bleeding-heart pigeon (&quot;Gallicolumba luzonica&quot;), Philippine eagle (&quot;Pithecophaga jefferyi&quot;) and a rare riverine fish, locally called &quot;ludong&quot; (&quot;Cestreaus plicatilis&quot;).

The &quot;ludong&quot; spawns in Cagayan River&#x27;s upper reaches in Jones, Isabela. In late October until mid-November, the fish travel down the river to release their eggs at the river mouth near Aparri.

In February, ludong fry by the millions are again caught in fine nets as these travel upstream.

Due to the dwindling number of ludong caught yearly, local governments have imposed a ban on catching the fish and its fry, but the ban has failed.

==People==
The river traverses four provinces: Nueva Vizcaya, Quirino, Isabela and Cagayan. These provinces have an approximate population of two million people, mostly farmers and indigenous tribesmen.

The Ibanag people derive their tribe&#x27;s name from Cagayan River&#x27;s ancient name, &quot;Bannag&quot;. The Gaddang tribe lived in the upper reaches of the Cagayan River and its tributaries.

==Economic importance==
The river drains a fertile valley that produces a variety of crops, including rice, corn, bananas, coconut, mangoes, citrus and tobacco.

Fish were a plentiful source of nutrition for centuries, but in recent decades issues such as fertilizer runoff, destructive fishing methods and a burgeoning human population have led to a great decline in the river&#x27;s fish stocks. With worsening weather patterns and regular severe storms, even traditional agricultural means are insufficient to feed families although they were bountiful in the past century, leading to the more aggressive use of destructive techniques. This has been part of a vicious cycle of environmental degradation.

Families still go to the banks of the river and its tributaries to wash clothes or have picnics.

Until recently, boatmen would provide ferry service. For example, the towns of Lasam and Gattaran are directly across the river from each other. A crossing by boat was the most convenient, but emergencies could be dangerous, such as having to fetch the doctor in Gattaran during a storm at night. Now the best way is by vehicle over the Magapit bridge.

There are dams in two of the river&#x27;s tributaries, the Magat and Chico Rivers, and there are also several mining concessions in the mineral-rich Cordillera Mountains near the headwaters of the two tributary rivers.

The provincial governments along the river have also developed tourism programs that offer activities on the river, particularly whitewater rafting.

<doc id="160269" wikidata="Q448246" url="?curid=160269" title="Anne Fine">
<text>Anne Fine (born 7 December 1947) is an English writer. Although best known for children&#x27;s books, she also writes for adults. She is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and she was appointed an OBE in 2003.

Fine has written more than seventy children&#x27;s books, including two winners of the annual Carnegie Medal and three highly commended runners-up. For some of those five books she also won the Guardian Prize, one Smarties Prize, two Whitbread Awards, and she was twice the Children&#x27;s Author of the Year.

For her contribution as a children&#x27;s writer, Fine was a runner-up for the Hans Christian Andersen Medal in 1998. From 2001 to 2003, she was the second Children&#x27;s Laureate in the UK.

==Early life==
Fine was born and raised in Leicester and educated in neighbouring midland counties of England. She attended Northampton High School and earned a degree in politics from the University of Warwick. She was married to the philosopher Kit Fine until they were divorced; she has now been with her partner Dick Warren for more than twenty years. She currently lives in Barnard Castle, County Durham, England. She and Kit Fine have two daughters named Cordelia Fine and Ione Fine.

She has four sisters; her father was an electrical engineer and she grew up in Fareham, Hampshire. The eldest of the sisters is Elizabeth Arnold who also writes books for children; the three younger sisters were triplets. She studied History and Politics at university, got married, and then her daughter Ione was born. At age 24, she wrote her first book.

==Career==
Describing the start of her writing career, Fine has written: &quot;In 1971 my first daughter was born. Unable to get to the library in a snowstorm to change my library books, in desperation I sat down and started to write a novel. Clearly this was the right job for me, for I have never stopped writing for more than a few weeks since&quot;. In September 2010, Fine told &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;&#x27;s Jessica Salter that this first book lay under her bed after being rejected by two publishers, adding &quot;Five years later I unearthed it and entered it in a competition where I was runner-up, and it was finally published in 1978&quot;.

Her books for older children include &quot;Madame Doubtfire&quot; (1987), a satirical novel
that Twentieth Century Fox filmed as &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot;, starring Robin Williams. &quot;Goggle-Eyes&quot; (Hamish Hamilton, 1989) was adapted for television by Deborah Hall for the BBC.

Her books for middle children include &quot;Bill&#x27;s New Frock&quot; (Methuen, 1989) and &quot;How to Write Really Badly&quot; (1996).

Her work has been translated into 45 languages.

In March 2014, Fine lent her support to the campaign Let Books Be Books, which aims to persuade publishers of children&#x27;s books to stop labelling and promoting books as &quot;for boys&quot; or &quot;for girls&quot;. She told UK newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;You&#x27;d think this battle would have been won decades ago. But even some seemingly bright and observant adults are buying into it again […] There are girls of all sorts, with all interests, and boys of all sorts with all interests. Just meeting a few children should make that obvious enough. But no, these idiotic notions are spouted so often they become a self-fulfilling societal straitjacket from which all our children suffer&quot;.

==Awards and nominations==

The biennial Hans Christian Andersen Award conferred by the International Board on Books for Young People is the highest recognition available to a writer or illustrator of children&#x27;s books. In 1998, Fine was one of five finalists for the writing award.

She won the 1989 Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising &quot;Goggle-Eyes&quot; as that year&#x27;s best children&#x27;s book, and she was one of two highly commended runners-up for the same Medal with &quot;Bill&#x27;s New Frock&quot;. She also won the once-in-a-lifetime Guardian Prize for &quot;Goggle-Eyes&quot; and the Smarties Prize in ages category 6–8 years for &quot;Bill&#x27;s New Frock&quot;.

Three years later, she won the Carnegie Medal again for &quot;Flour Babies&quot; (Hamilton, 1992), which was also named the Whitbread Children&#x27;s Book of the Year.
&quot;The Tulip Touch&quot; (Hamilton, 1996) was her second Whitbread winner and her second highly commended for the Carnegie.

&quot;Up on Cloud Nine&quot; (Doubleday, 2002) was the last highly commended Carnegie runner-up, a distinction then used 29 times in 24 years. Fine is one of seven authors to win two Carnegie Medals (1936–2012) and the only author of three Highly Commended books.

Fine was the second Children&#x27;s Laureate (2001–03) and received the OBE for services to literature in the 2003 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List.

<text>Aparri (Ibanag: &quot;Ili nat Aparri&quot;; ; ), officially the Municipality of Aparri, is a municipality in the province of , Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 68,839 people.

Aparri is a bustling municipality and the primary growth center of Northern Cagayan. It serves as the center of education, commerce and culture in the northern part of the Region which includes towns of the first and second districts of Cagayan as well as the towns of Apayao and some towns of Ilocos Norte. It serves as the show window of commerce and finance,economic transformation, information technology, livelihood development, fashion and culture, leisure and entertainment, agricultural modernization, and course good local governance.

Aparri has an approximate income of ₱250 million. The valley has been one of the largest tobacco-producing sections in the Philippines, and the town has a considerable coastwise trade.

It has a meteorological station located in Barangay Punta where the Cagayan River meets the Babuyan Channel.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name Aparri has been disputed. One version says that the town was named by Spanish conquistador Juan Pablo Carreron, who upon landing there in 1581, named the town after the colloquial word for supper in his hometown. Another version claims that the name comes from the Spanish word &quot;aparte&quot;, or &quot;separate&quot;, referring to the town&#x27;s separation from Camalaniugan and Buguey in 1680. Yet another version says that the town&#x27;s name comes from the Ibanag word &quot;apparian&quot;, a place where there are many priests.

==History==
Aparri was formerly Japanese trading post because of its location at the northern tip of Luzon at the mouth of the Cagayan River. It was the main area for trade for Japan on the island of Luzon. Much of the area was once home to the native Ibanag people, who were at the time in alliance with Japan as an early form of an informal protectorate city-state. It was formally established under Spanish rule in 1605 after the Spanish Crown seized the Philippines and made it part of the Spanish East Indies. The river where Aparri is in was the site of the famed 1582 Cagayan battles, the only major skirmish between Spanish Tercios and Japanese ronin (masterless samurai). Since it was on the route of Spanish Galleons during the great tobacco monopoly in the 16th to the 17th centuries, Aparri was therefore made one of the major Spanish ports of the Galleon Trade on May 11, 1680. The original inhabitants of this town were the Ybanags. Later, as the Spaniards settled and because of its strategic location, Ilocanos and Chinese people settled in the area. In 1771 it was raided by Moro vessels from Jolo. Towards the end of the Spanish occupation and in 1901, at the start of the American occupation, attempts were made to make Aparri the provincial capital of Cagayan, all of which were unsuccessful.

During the Philippine Revolution, Aparri was the site of the landing of soldiers of the Philippine Revolutionary Army led by Daniel Tirona, which marked the beginning of the end of Spanish rule in Cagayan Valley, on 25 August 1898.

In 11 May 1926 Joaquín Loriga and Eduardo Gallarza landed on his first-ever long way in autogyro from Spain to Manila. Before the outbreak of World War II, it became a transshipment point for smuggled goods from China, Taiwan, and other neighboring Southeast Asian nations. Aparri was one of the first places occupied by the Japanese in their invasion of the Philippines during the war, landing there on December 10, 1941. Donald Blackburn&#x27;s guerrilla forces and the local troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary supported the Sixth United States Army Force B, in the capture of Aparri on 20 June 1945.

On February 19, 2023, Vice Mayor Rommel Alameda was shot and killed along with five others in an ambush in Bagabag, Nueva Vizcaya.

===Tourism===

Aparri is known for its foods such as the &quot;bulung-unas&quot;, or Ribbon Fish (aka Belt Fish), which are in abundance during January and early February. &quot;Kilawin naguilas-asan&quot; is a fillet of smaller &quot;bulung-unas&quot; which are leftover baits, soaked in Ilocos vinegar, seasoned with salt and pepper, finely cut onions and ginger. Ludong, a variety of Pacific salmon, is the Philippines&#x27; most expensive fish, ranging from 4,000 pesos to 5,000 per kilo. Because of its price and its distinct taste and smell, it is also nicknamed &quot;President Fish&quot;. Caught only in the Aparri delta when, after a heavy rainfall, these fish are washed down by the fast raging water from the south, down to the mouth of the Cagayan River where it meets the Babuyan Sea. Freshwater fish by nature, the salt water contributes to their super delicious taste. Ludong is available only in the rainy months of October and early November.

Aparri&#x27;s attractions also include its sandy beaches and town fiesta. May 1 to 12 of every year, the town&#x27;s fiesta celebrates the patron saint San Pedro Gonzales of Thelmo with nightly festivities at the auditorium, crowning of Miss Aparri beauty pageant and the &quot;Comparza.&quot;

<doc id="160275" wikidata="Q318500" url="?curid=160275" title="Miguel López de Legazpi">
<text>Miguel López de Legazpi (12 June 1502 – 20 August 1572), also known as &quot;El Adelantado&quot; and &quot;El Viejo&quot; (The Elder), was a Spanish conquistador who financed and led an expedition to conquer the Philippine islands in the mid-16th century. He was joined by Guido de Lavezares, relative Martin de Goiti, friar Andrés de Urdaneta, and his grandsons Juan and Felipe de Salcedo, in the expedition. Legazpi established the first Spanish settlement in the East Indies after his expedition crossed the Pacific Ocean, arriving in Cebu in 1565. He became the first governor-general of the Spanish East Indies, which was administered from New Spain for the Spanish crown. It also encompassed other Pacific islands, namely Guam, the Mariana Islands, Palau, and the Carolinas. After obtaining peace with various indigenous tribes and kingdoms, he made Cebu City the capital of the Spanish East Indies in 1565 and later transferred to Manila in 1571. The capital city of the province of Albay bears his name.

Coincidentally, his birthday of 12 June was later the day of the Philippine Declaration of Independence from Spain in 1898 during the term of Diego de los Rios, the last Spanish governor-general of the Philippines.

==Early years==
Miguel López de Legazpi was born on 12 June 1502 in the town of Zumarraga in the Basque province of Guipúzcoa, Spain. His family was wealthy and held important positions in the military and in municipal administration. His father, Juan de Legazpi, was a soldier who fought under Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba in the Italian Wars. Later, he led troops against a French army in the Spanish province of Guipúzcoa. His mother, Elvira de Gurruchátegui, also belonged to a distinguished provincial family.

The details of his education are unknown, but based on his later work and administrative positions it seems likely that he received training in law. While his father was still alive, López de Legazpi worked as a councilor in the municipal government of his town. After his father&#x27;s death in 1527, his older brother inherited the family wealth and leadership positions.

==New Spain==
Around 1528 Legazpi settled in New Spain, the Spanish colony recently created from the conquests of Hernán Cortés in Mexico. He likely left home to seek new opportunities but the exact circumstances of his move are unclear. He may have been part of the retinue of Juan de Zumárraga, a fellow Basque who was appointed by Charles V to become the first bishop and inquisitor in New Spain.

After his arrival, Legazpi served in a number of positions both civil and ecclesiastical. For a while he was clerk of the mint. He was then secretary of the municipal council and became &quot;alcalde mayor&quot; of Mexico City in 1559. He also served in the Court of Inquisition and was involved in several inquisitorial processes between 1536 and 1543. In recognition of his service, he was awarded several land grants and privately acquired additional property in the capital and in the territory of Michoacán.

In 1532 he married Isabel Garcés, the sister of Julián Garcés, first bishop of Tlaxcala. The couple had nine children, four boys and five girls. At some time before 1559 his wife died. His oldest daughter, Teresa, had two children,Felipe and Juan, who participated with their grandfather in the conquest of the Philippines.

==Expedition to the Philippines==
In 1564, López de Legazpi was commissioned by the viceroy, Luís de Velasco, to lead an expedition in the Pacific Ocean, to find the Spice Islands where the earlier explorers Ferdinand Magellan and Ruy López de Villalobos had landed in 1521 and 1543, respectively. The expedition was ordered by King Philip II of Spain. The viceroy died in July 1564, but the Audiencia and López de Legazpi completed the preparations for the expedition.

On 19 or 20 November 1564, five ships, carrying 500 soldiers, over half of whom were Mexicans (Criollos, Mestizos and Indios) and the remaining, Spaniards, sailed from the port of Barra de Navidad, New Spain, in what is now Jalisco state, Mexico (other sources give the date as 1 November 1564, and mention &#x27;four ships and 379 men&#x27;) the flagship nao &quot;San Pabló&quot;, the almiranta &quot;San Pedro&quot;, and the pinnaces &quot;San Juan&quot; and &quot;San Lucas&quot;. Members of the expedition included six Augustinian missionaries, in addition to Fr. Andrés de Urdaneta, who served as navigator and spiritual adviser, Melchor de Legazpi (Miguel López de Legazpi&#x27;s son), Felipe de Salcedo (one of Miguel López de Legazpi&#x27;s grandsons), and Guido de Lavezarez (a survivor of Ferdinand Magellan&#x27;s expedition).

López de Legazpi and his men sailed the Pacific Ocean for 93 days. In 1565, they landed in the Mariana Islands, where they briefly anchored and replenished their supplies. There they fought with Chamorro tribes and burned several huts.

===Arrival in the Philippines===
A chief of Bohol island named Sikatuna gave information to Miguel López about Cebu and accompanied López as a guide. López de Legazpi&#x27;s expedition anchored off the Indianized Rajahnate of Cebu on 13 February 1565, but did not put ashore due to opposition from natives.

On 22 February 1565, the expedition reached the island of Samar and made a blood compact with its chief, Datu Urrao. The Spaniards then proceeded to Limasawa and were received by Datu Bankaw, then to Bohol, where they befriended Datu Sikatuna (or Catunao) and Rajah Sigala. On 16 March 1565, López de Legazpi made a blood compact with Datu Sikatuna.

On 27 April 1565, the expedition returned to Cebu and landed there. Rajah Tupas challenged the Spaniards, but was overpowered. The Spaniards established a colony, naming the settlements &quot;Villa del Santisimo Nombre de Jesús&quot; (Town of the Most Holy Name of Jesus) after an image of Sto. Niño in one of the native houses.

In 1568, the Portuguese attempted a blockade of Cebu to expel the Spaniards. The Spanish colony proved to be resistant to the blockade and the Portuguese fleet withdrew as it suffered from an outbreak of typhoid fever.

=== Panay and Mindoro ===
In 1569, due to a scarcity of food provisions in Cebu, López de Legazpi transferred to Panay town on the island of Panay. Subsequently, they founded a second settlement, then named &quot;Capiz&quot; and now the city of Roxas in Capiz province, located on the bank of the Panay River. In 1570, López de Legazpi sent Juan de Salcedo, his grandson who had arrived from Mexico in 1567, to Mindoro to fight the Muslim Moro. Salcedo also destroyed forts on the islands of Ilin and Lubang, respectively South and Northwest of Mindoro

=== Luzon and the capture of Manila ===

In 1570, having heard of the rich resources in Luzon, López de Legazpi dispatched Martín de Goiti to explore the northern region. Landing in Batangas with a force of 120 Spaniards, de Goiti explored the Pansipit River, which drains Taal Lake. On 8 May, they arrived in modern Manila Bay. There, they were welcomed by the natives. Goiti&#x27;s soldiers camped there for a few weeks while forming an alliance with the Muslim leader, Rajah Ache (better known as Rajah Matanda), who was a vassal under the Sultan of Brunei. López de Legazpi wanted to use Maynila&#x27;s harbor as a base for trade with China. However, the Rajah&#x27;s ally in northern shores of the bay, historically known as the young Bambalito of Macabebe, asked Rajah Soliman (Old Ache) to revoke his alliance with the Spaniards. Rajah Matanda refused because of the &quot;word of honor&quot; of the Spaniards. Rajah Soliman had his conditions for Bambalito that if they were able to kill as least 50 Spaniards, he would revoke his alliance with López de Legazpi, and the Old Ache would help to expel the conquerors. Bambalito rode back to Macabebe and formed a fleet of two thousand five hundred moros consisting of soldiers from the villages along Maynila Bay particularly from Macabebe and Hagonoy. On 30 May 1570, Bambalito sailed to Tondo with Caracoas and encountered the Spaniards at Bangkusay Channel, headed by Martin de Goiti on 3 June 1571. Bambalito and his fleet lost the battle and the Spaniards occupied the Islamized states of Tondo and Maynila. Maynila was prepared by Goiti for López de Legazpi who left Panay.

In the same year, more reinforcements arrived in the Philippines, prompting López de Legazpi to leave Cebu for Panay and then for Luzon. He recruited 250 Spanish soldiers and 600 native warriors to explore the regions of Leyte and Panay. The following year, he followed Goiti and Salcedo in Maynila, after learning that the villages had been conquered.

During the early phase of the exploration of the northern part of the Philippines, López de Legazpi remained in Cebu and did not accompany his men during their conquest of Maynila because of health problems and advanced age.

In Maynila, López de Legazpi formed a peace pact with the native councils as well as the local rulers, Rajah Sulayman and Lakan Dula). Both groups agreed to organize a city council, consisting of two mayors, twelve councilors and a secretary. López de Legazpi established a settlement there on 24 June 1571, and he also ordered the construction of the walled city of Intramuros. He proclaimed the town Manila to be the island&#x27;s capital.

Upon the defeat of Bambalito, López de Legazpi ordered the exploration of the villages north of Manila. In September 1571, Goiti pacified Lubao and Betis, using riverine tributaries of Rio Chico, then he reached the settlements in Calumpit and Malolos on 14 November 1571 and other old villages mostly along Manila Bay. López de Legazpi had established a government on the islands and became the first Spanish governor-general of the Philippines.
===Last years===
López de Legazpi governed the Philippines for a year before dying suddenly of a stroke in Manila on 20 August 1572 after scolding an aide. He died bankrupt, leaving a few pesos behind, due to having spent most of his personal fortune during the conquest. He was laid to rest in San Agustin Church, Intramuros.

By the time of López de Legazpi&#x27;s death, the parts of the Visayas had passed to Spanish rule. The Spanish met strong resistance from Muslim sultanates on the island of Mindanao, the Zambal tribes of Zambales, and the Igorot of the Cordilleran mountains, as well as some Wokou pirates from China and Japan.

====Letters to the King of Spain====
During his final years, López de Legazpi wrote several letters to Philip II of Spain about his journey to the East Indies, and the conquest he had achieved. These were collectively known as the (Letters to the King Lord Philip II: on the expedition, conquests, and progress of the Philippine Islands). The letters are preserved at the General Archive of the Indies in Seville, Spain.

===Role of religion on the expedition===
At the time of López de Legazpi&#x27;s arrival, the natives of the archipelago practiced Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and animism. Part of the motivation of the Spaniards was to evangelize the population and convert people to Roman Catholicism.

With the Augustinian, Franciscan and other friars, who had helped him establish a government on the islands, López de Legazpi worked to convert the natives to the Christian religion. In 1609, Antonio de Morga, Alcalde of Criminal Causes, in the Royal Audiencia of New Spain wrote:

After the islands had been conquered by the sovereign light of the holy gospel which entered therein, the heathen were baptized, the darkness of their paganism was banished and they changed their own for Christian names. The islands also, losing their former name, took — with the change of religion and the baptism of their inhabitants — that of Filipinas Islands, in recognition of the great favors received at the hands of his Majesty Filipe the Second, our sovereign, in whose fortunate time and reign they were conquered, protected and encouraged, as a work and achievement of his royal hands.

The López de Legazpi and Urdaneta expedition to the Philippines effectively created the trans-Pacific Manila galleon trade, in which silver mined from Mexico and Potosí was exchanged for Chinese silk, porcelain, Indonesian spices, Indian gems and other goods precious to Europe at the time. The trade route formed an important commercial link between Latin America and the Asia-Pacific with the trade products even carried over to Europe via the Havana Galleons, while heavily financing the Spanish Empire. The introduction of Western ingredients, goods, and imperialism brought about the &#x27;Hispanization&#x27; of the islands.

For the next 333 years, from 1565 when Spain first established a presence in the country and ruled it from Mexico City and Madrid, until the Treaty of Paris on 10 December 1898, the Philippines was a Spanish possession (including the years 1762–1764 when the British controlled Manila and the port city of Cavite but not the whole country).

<text>Carbon fibers or carbon fibres (alternatively CF, graphite fiber or graphite fibre) are fibers about in diameter and composed mostly of carbon atoms. Carbon fibers have several advantages: high stiffness, high tensile strength, high strength to weight ratio, high chemical resistance, high-temperature tolerance, and low thermal expansion. These properties have made carbon fiber very popular in aerospace, civil engineering, military, motorsports, and other competition sports. However, they are relatively expensive compared to similar fibers, such as glass fiber, basalt fibers, or plastic fibers.

To produce a carbon fiber, the carbon atoms are bonded together in crystals that are more or less aligned parallel to the fiber&#x27;s long axis as the crystal alignment gives the fiber a high strength-to-volume ratio (in other words, it is strong for its size). Several thousand carbon fibers are bundled together to form a tow, which may be used by itself or woven into a fabric. 

Carbon fibers are usually combined with other materials to form a composite. For example, when permeated with a plastic resin and baked, it forms carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (often referred to as carbon fiber), which has a very high strength-to-weight ratio and is extremely rigid although somewhat brittle. Carbon fibers are also composited with other materials, such as graphite, to form reinforced carbon-carbon composites, which have a very high heat tolerance.

Carbon fiber-reinforced materials are used to make aircraft and spacecraft parts, racing car bodies, golf club shafts, bicycle frames, fishing rods, automobile springs, sailboat masts, and many other components where light weight and high strength are needed.

==History==
In 1860, Joseph Swan produced carbon fibers for the first time, for use in light bulbs. In 1879, Thomas Edison baked cotton threads or bamboo slivers at high temperatures carbonizing them into an all-carbon fiber filament used in one of the first incandescent light bulbs to be heated by electricity. In 1880, Lewis Latimer developed a reliable carbon wire filament for the incandescent light bulb, heated by electricity.

In 1958, Roger Bacon created high-performance carbon fibers at the Union Carbide Parma Technical Center located outside of Cleveland, Ohio. Those fibers were manufactured by heating strands of rayon until they carbonized. This process proved to be inefficient, as the resulting fibers contained only about 20% carbon. In the early 1960s, a process was developed by Dr. Akio Shindo at Agency of Industrial Science and Technology of Japan, using polyacrylonitrile (PAN) as a raw material. This had produced a carbon fiber that contained about 55% carbon. In 1960 Richard Millington of H.I. Thompson Fiberglas Co. developed a process (US Patent No. 3,294,489) for producing a high carbon content (99%) fiber using rayon as a precursor. These carbon fibers had sufficient strength (modulus of elasticity and tensile strength) to be used as a reinforcement for composites having high strength to weight properties and for high temperature resistant applications.

The high potential strength of carbon fiber was realized in 1963 in a process developed by W. Watt, L. N. Phillips, and W. Johnson at the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough, Hampshire. The process was patented by the UK Ministry of Defence, then licensed by the British National Research Development Corporation to three companies: Rolls-Royce, who were already making carbon fiber; Morganite; and Courtaulds. Within a few years, after successful use in 1968 of a &quot;Hyfil&quot; carbon-fiber fan assembly in the Rolls-Royce Conway jet engines of the Vickers VC10, Rolls-Royce took advantage of the new material&#x27;s properties to break into the American market with its RB-211 aero-engine with carbon-fiber compressor blades. Unfortunately, the blades proved vulnerable to damage from bird impact. This problem and others caused Rolls-Royce such setbacks that the company was nationalized in 1971. The carbon-fiber production plant was sold off to form &quot;Bristol Composite Materials Engineering Ltd&quot; (often referred to as Bristol Composites).

In the late 1960s, the Japanese took the lead in manufacturing PAN-based carbon fibers. A 1970 joint technology agreement allowed Union Carbide to manufacture Japan&#x27;s Toray Industries product. Morganite decided that carbon-fiber production was peripheral to its core business, leaving Courtaulds as the only big UK manufacturer. Courtaulds&#x27;s water-based inorganic process made the product susceptible to impurities that did not affect the organic process used by other carbon-fiber manufacturers, leading Courtaulds ceasing carbon-fiber production in 1991.

During the 1960s, experimental work to find alternative raw materials led to the introduction of carbon fibers made from a petroleum pitch derived from oil processing. These fibers contained about 85% carbon and had excellent flexural strength. Also, during this period, the Japanese Government heavily supported carbon fiber development at home and several Japanese companies such as Toray, Nippon Carbon, Toho Rayon and Mitsubishi started their own development and production. Since the late 1970s, further types of carbon fiber yarn entered the global market, offering higher tensile strength and higher elastic modulus. For example, T400 from Toray with a tensile strength of 4,000 MPa and M40, a modulus of 400 GPa. Intermediate carbon fibers, such as IM 600 from Toho Rayon with up to 6,000 MPa were developed. Carbon fibers from Toray, Celanese and Akzo found their way to aerospace application from secondary to primary parts first in military and later in civil aircraft as in McDonnell Douglas, Boeing, Airbus, and United Aircraft Corporation planes. In 1988, Dr. Jacob Lahijani invented balanced ultra-high Young&#x27;s modulus (greater than 100 Mpsi) and high tensile strength pitch carbon fiber (greater than 500 kpsi) used extensively in automotive and aerospace applications. In March 2006, the patent was assigned to the University of Tennessee Research Foundation.

==Structure and properties==
Carbon fiber is frequently supplied in the form of a continuous tow wound onto a reel. The tow is a bundle of thousands of continuous individual carbon filaments held together and protected by an organic coating, or size, such as polyethylene oxide (PEO) or polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The tow can be conveniently unwound from the reel for use. Each carbon filament in the tow is a continuous cylinder with a diameter of 5–10 micrometers and consists almost exclusively of carbon. The earliest generation (e.g. T300, HTA and AS4) had diameters of 16–22 micrometers. Later fibers (e.g. IM6 or IM600) have diameters that are approximately 5 micrometers.

The atomic structure of carbon fiber is similar to that of graphite, consisting of sheets of carbon atoms arranged in a regular hexagonal pattern (graphene sheets), the difference being in the way these sheets interlock. Graphite is a crystalline material in which the sheets are stacked parallel to one another in regular fashion. The intermolecular forces between the sheets are relatively weak Van der Waals forces, giving graphite its soft and brittle characteristics.

Depending upon the precursor to make the fiber, carbon fiber may be turbostratic or graphitic, or have a hybrid structure with both graphitic and turbostratic parts present. In turbostratic carbon fiber the sheets of carbon atoms are haphazardly folded, or crumpled, together. Carbon fibers derived from polyacrylonitrile (PAN) are turbostratic, whereas carbon fibers derived from mesophase pitch are graphitic after heat treatment at temperatures exceeding 2200 °C. Turbostratic carbon fibers tend to have high ultimate tensile strength, whereas heat-treated mesophase-pitch-derived carbon fibers have high Young&#x27;s modulus (i.e., high stiffness or resistance to extension under load) and high thermal conductivity.

==Applications==
Carbon fiber can have higher cost than other materials which has been one of the limiting factors of adoption. In a comparison between steel and carbon fiber materials for automotive materials, carbon fiber may be 10-12x more expensive. However, this cost premium has come down over the past decade from estimates of 35x more expensive than steel in the early 2000s.

===Composite materials===
Carbon fiber is most notably used to reinforce composite materials, particularly the class of materials known as carbon fiber or graphite reinforced polymers. Non-polymer materials can also be used as the matrix for carbon fibers. Due to the formation of metal carbides and corrosion considerations, carbon has seen limited success in metal matrix composite applications. Reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) consists of carbon fiber-reinforced graphite, and is used structurally in high-temperature applications. The fiber also finds use in filtration of high-temperature gases, as an electrode with high surface area and impeccable corrosion resistance, and as an anti-static component. Molding a thin layer of carbon fibers significantly improves fire resistance of polymers or thermoset composites because a dense, compact layer of carbon fibers efficiently reflects heat.

The increasing use of carbon fiber composites is displacing aluminum from aerospace applications in favor of other metals because of galvanic corrosion issues. Note, however, that carbon fiber does not eliminate the risk of galvanic corrosion. In contact with metal, it forms &quot;a perfect galvanic corrosion cell ..., and the metal will be subjected to galvanic corrosion attack&quot; unless a sealant is applied between the metal and the carbon fiber.

Carbon fiber can be used as an additive to asphalt to make electrically conductive asphalt concrete. Using this composite material in the transportation infrastructure, especially for airport pavement, decreases some winter maintenance problems that lead to flight cancellation or delay due to the presence of ice and snow. Passing current through the composite material 3D network of carbon fibers dissipates thermal energy that increases the surface temperature of the asphalt, which is able to melt ice and snow above it.

===Textiles===

Precursors for carbon fibers are polyacrylonitrile (PAN), rayon and pitch. Carbon fiber filament yarns are used in several processing techniques: the direct uses are for prepregging, filament winding, pultrusion, weaving, braiding, etc. Carbon fiber yarn is rated by the linear density (weight per unit length; i.e., 1 g/1000 m = 1 tex) or by number of filaments per yarn count, in thousands. For example, 200 tex for 3,000 filaments of carbon fiber is three times as strong as 1,000 carbon filament yarn, but is also three times as heavy. This thread can then be used to weave a carbon fiber filament fabric or cloth. The appearance of this fabric generally depends on the linear density of the yarn and the weave chosen. Some commonly used types of weave are twill, satin and plain. Carbon filament yarns can also be knitted or braided.

===Microelectrodes===

Carbon fibers are used for fabrication of carbon-fiber microelectrodes. In this application typically a single carbon fiber with diameter of 5–7 μm is sealed in a glass capillary. At the tip the capillary is either sealed with epoxy and polished to make a carbon-fiber disk microelectrode, or the fiber is cut to a length of 75–150 μm to make a carbon-fiber cylinder electrode. Carbon-fiber microelectrodes are used either in amperometry or fast-scan cyclic voltammetry for detection of biochemical signaling.

===Flexible heating===
Despite being known for their electrical conductivity, carbon fibers can carry only very low currents on their own. When woven into larger fabrics, they can be used to reliably provide (infrared) heating in applications requiring flexible electrical heating elements and can easily sustain temperatures past 100 °C. Many examples of this type of application can be seen in DIY heated articles of clothing and blankets. Due to its chemical inertness, it can be used relatively safely amongst most fabrics and materials; however, shorts caused by the material folding back on itself will lead to increased heat production and can lead to a fire.

==Synthesis==

Each carbon filament is produced from a polymer such as polyacrylonitrile (PAN), rayon, or petroleum pitch. All these polymers are known as a precursor. For synthetic polymers such as PAN or rayon, the precursor is first spun into filament yarns, using chemical and mechanical processes to initially align the polymer molecules in a way to enhance the final physical properties of the completed carbon fiber. Precursor compositions and mechanical processes used during spinning filament yarns may vary among manufacturers. After drawing or spinning, the polymer filament yarns are then heated to drive off non-carbon atoms (carbonization), producing the final carbon fiber. The carbon fibers filament yarns may be further treated to improve handling qualities, then wound on to bobbins.


A common method of manufacture involves heating the spun PAN filaments to approximately 300 °C in air, which breaks many of the hydrogen bonds and oxidizes the material. During this process, fibers tend to shrink. The resulting chemical composition and mechanical properties of the fiber are dependent on the time and temperature of the process, as well as on the tension applied to the fiber during oxidation. The oxidized PAN is then placed into a furnace having an inert atmosphere of a gas such as argon, and heated to approximately 2000 °C, which induces graphitization of the material, changing the molecular bond structure. When heated in the correct conditions, these chains bond side-to-side (ladder polymers), forming narrow graphene sheets which eventually merge to form a single, columnar filament. The result is usually 93–95% carbon. Lower-quality fiber can be manufactured using pitch or rayon as the precursor instead of PAN. The carbon can become further enhanced, as high modulus, or high strength carbon, by heat treatment processes. Carbon heated in the range of 1500–2000 °C (carbonization) exhibits the highest tensile strength (5,650MPa, or 820,000psi), while carbon fiber heated from 2500 to 3000 °C (graphitizing) exhibits a higher modulus of elasticity (531GPa, or 77,000,000psi).

<doc id="160278" wikidata="Q13786" url="?curid=160278" title="Cebu">
<text>Cebu ( ; ) officially the Province of Cebu (; ), is a province of the Philippines located in the Central Visayas region, and consists of a main island and 167 surrounding islands and islets. The coastal zone of Cebu is identified as a site of highest marine biodiversity importance in the Coral Triangle.

Its capital and largest city is Cebu City, nicknamed &quot;the Queen (Catholic) City of the South&quot; having the Second Cardinal, the oldest city and first capital of the Philippines, which is politically independent from the provincial government along with Mandaue and Lapu-Lapu City. The Cebu Metropolitan Area or Metro Cebu is the third largest metropolitan area in the Philippines (after Metro Manila and Metro Davao) with Cebu City as the main center of commerce, trade, education and industry in the Visayas as well as the regional center of Central Visayas. Being one of the most developed provinces in the Philippines, in a decade it has transformed into a global hub for business processing services, tourism, shipping, furniture-making, and heavy industry. Mactan–Cebu International Airport, located on Mactan Island, is the second busiest airport in the Philippines.

Cebu has the most combined cities and municipalities of any province in the Philippines, with 53 in total. With 9 cities in total, it has the second most number of cities after its neighboring province of Negros Occidental.

== Etymology ==
It is unclear whether the island was named &quot;sugbó&quot; or the settlement where Ferdinand Magellan&#x27;s crew arrived in 1521. The capital city of the province is also named Cebu City.

The name is possibly derived from a hypothetical Proto-Philippine word &quot;*sug(e)bu&quot; meaning &quot;to bathe&quot; or &quot;to wade into the water&quot;. The word has evolved in the Cebuano language as &quot;sugbú,&quot; meaning &quot;to dive into water&quot; and also exists in other Philippine languages such as Tagalog and Hiligaynon. In fact, there is also another municipality in Batangas, Philippines called Nasugbu, which may also share the same etymological root with the said province.

The modern name is most likely how the first Europeans heard of the name of the place in the 16th-17th centuries, as it was first recorded as Zubu or Çubu, and then eventually it became Cebu. The reason of the spelling change is because Visayans were mostly illiterate in the 16th and 17th centuries.

==History==
=== Early history ===

Cebu was a native kingdom that existed prior to the arrival of the Spaniards. It was founded by Sri Lumay otherwise known as &quot;Rajamuda Lumaya&quot;, a half-Malay, half-Tamil from Sumatra The capital of the nation was Singhapala (சிங்கப்பூர்) which is Tamil-Sanskrit for &quot;Lion City&quot;, the same root words as with the modern city-state of Singapore. The later Spanish chronicler Antonio Pigafetta mispronounced Singhapala as Cingopola instead.

=== Spanish Colonial Period ===

==== Report from the Magellan Expedition ====
The arrival of Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan in 1521 began a period of Spanish exploration and colonization.Losing the favor of King Manuel I of Portugal for his plan of reaching the Spice Islands by sailing west from Europe, Magellan offered his services to King Charles I of Spain (Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor). On September 20, 1519, Magellan led five ships with a total complement of 250 people from the Spanish fort of Sanlúcar de Barrameda en route to southeast Asia via the Americas and the Pacific Ocean. They reached the Philippines on March 16, 1521. Rajah Kolambu, the rajah of Mazaua told them to sail for Cebu, where they could trade and obtain provisions.

Arriving in Cebu City, Magellan, with Enrique of Malacca as a translator, befriended Rajah Humabon a chief of a village in Cebu, and persuaded the natives to ally themselves with the Spanish. On April 14, Magellan erected a large wooden cross on the shores of Cebu. Afterwards, Rajah Humabon was baptized along with about 400 Sugbuanons.

Magellan soon heard of Datu Lapu-Lapu, a native chief in nearby Mactan Island, a rival of a chief in Cebu. It was thought that Humabon and Lapu–Lapu had been fighting for control of the flourishing trade in the area. On April 27 the Battle of Mactan occurred, where the Spaniards were defeated and Magellan was killed by the natives of Mactan in Mactan Island. According to Italian historian and chronicler Antonio Pigafetta, Magellan&#x27;s body was never recovered despite efforts to trade for it with spice and jewels. Magellan&#x27;s second-in-command, Juan Sebastián Elcano, took his place as captain of the expedition and sailed the fleet back to Spain, circumnavigating the world.

Survivors of the Magellan expedition returned to Spain with tales of a savage island in the East Indies. Consequently, several Spanish expeditions were sent to the islands but all ended in failure.

==== Report from the Legazpi Expedition ====
On April 27, 1565 Miguel López de Legazpi arrived on the island, though he also intended to make peace, he was also prepared for a war since these were the same people that killed Magellan 44 years prior. According to the report, a messenger went to the Spanish ship and informed them that Tupas and &quot;along with 10 other chiefs&quot; would be out to either make negotiations or as a warning to prepare for an upcoming battle. Despite trying to assure the natives that the Spanish were there with good intentions, the natives already armed themselves, both parties were reported to have taunted each other offshore. Legazpi aimed the artillery on the &quot;proas&quot; which briefly confused the opposing natives causing them to run into the woods thus making the shore clear for the Spanish to land. Salvaging any valuable item that could be found, Juan de Camuz came across an image of the Child Jesus, which was probably the one Magellan presented to the consort of the chief in 1521. From then on, a church was built on the site which would later become the Minor Basilica of the Holy Child. Twelve days later, on May 8, a fort was established and while the construction was ongoing, the natives frequently launched attacks but were always repulsed until eventually they give in as soon as they realized the superior armament of the Europeans. Legazpi dealt only with Tupas, after a brief &quot;trial&quot; on grounds of apostasy and Magellan&#x27;s murder, the Europeans pardoned the natives&#x27; chief and included the natives. After the exchange, the two parties then discussed the terms and conditions including confirmation of titles, who receives tax exemptions, land grants, authority and recognition of officials. The crew then left Cebu on June 1, 1565. In the 1700s, Cebu housed 625 Spanish Filipino families and 28,112 native families

=== American colonial period ===
In 1898, the island was ceded to the United States after the Spanish–American War and Philippine–American War. In 1901, Cebu was governed by the United States for a brief period, however, it became a chartered city on February 24, 1937, and was governed independently by Filipino politicians.

=== Japanese occupation ===

Cebu, being one of the most densely populated islands in the Philippines, served as a Japanese base during their occupation in World War II which began with the landing of Japanese soldiers in April 1942. A Japanese businessman established Cebu&#x27;s first &quot;comfort station&quot; during the war, where Japanese soldiers routinely gang-raped, humiliated, and murdered kidnapped girls and teenagers who they forced into sexual slavery under the brutal &quot;comfort women&quot; system. The 3rd, 8th, 82nd and 85th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army was re-established from January 3, 1942, to June 30, 1946, and the 8th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary was reestablished again from October 28, 1944, to June 30, 1946, at the military general headquarters and the military camps and garrisoned in Cebu city and Cebu province. They started the Anti-Japanese military operations in Cebu from April 1942 to September 1945 and helped Cebuano guerrillas and fought against the Japanese Imperial forces. Almost three years later in March 1945, combined Filipino and American forces landed and reoccupied the island during the liberation of the Philippines. Cebuano guerrilla groups led by an American, James M. Cushing, is credited for the establishment of the &quot;Koga Papers&quot;, which is said to have changed the American plans to retake the Philippines from Japanese occupation in 1944, by helping the combined United States and the Philippine Commonwealth Army forces enter Cebu in 1945. The following year the island achieved independence from colonial rule in 1946.

=== Philippine independence ===
==== During the Marcos dictatorship ====
Cebu became a key center of resistance against the Marcos dictatorship, first becoming apparent when the hastily put-together lineup of Pusyon Bisaya defeated the entire slate of Marcos&#x27; Kilusang Bagong Lipunan (KBL) in Region VII.

Among the Cebuanos immediately arrested by the Marcos dictatorship when martial law was announced on September 23, 1972 were columnist and future National Artist Resil Mojares and human rights lawyer and Carcar Vice Mayor Democrito Barcenas, who were both detained at Camp Sergio Osmeña.

One of the Marcos Martial Law Desaparecidos from Cebu was Redemptorist Priest Fr. Rudy Romano, a prominent Marcos critic and Executive Secretary of Cebu&#x27;s Coalition against People&#x27;s Persecution, who was accosted by armed men in Tisa, Labangon, Cebu City on June 11, 1985, and never seen again. Levi Ybañez, Romano&#x27;s colleague in the Coalition against People&#x27;s Persecution, was abducted on the same day as Fr. Romano, and was also never heard from again. Ribomapil Holganza, a prominent leader of Cebu&#x27;s opposition was also arrested together with his son on Christmas Day, December 25, 1983, on political charges. He was subsequently released and cleared of all charges.

==== Role in the People Power Revolution ====
Later, Cebu would play a key role in the days leading up to the 1986 People Power revolution and the ouster of Marcos. It was from Fuente Osmeña circle in Cebu City that the opposition forces relaunched the Civil Disobedience Campaign against the Marcos regime and its cronies on February 22, 1986. After that, the Carmelite Monastery in Barangay Mabolo, Cebu City, served as a refuge for opposition candidates Corazon Aquino and Salvador Laurel during the first day of the People Power revolution, because it was not yet safe to go back to Manila.

=== Contemporary ===
In 2007, the municipalities of Bogo, Carcar, and Naga became component cities. Their respective cityhood laws were ratified in the same year. However, their cityhood status were lost twice in the years 2008 and 2010 after the LCP questioned the validity of the cityhood laws. Their cityhood status were reaffirmed after the court finalized its ruling on February 15, 2011, declared their respective cityhood laws constitutional.

In February 2012 Cebu island experienced the effects of magnitude 6.7 earthquake on the neighboring island of Negros and was the largest quake in the area for 90 years. The tremor shook buildings but there were no reports of major building damage or loss of life on Cebu Island itself. This tremor was caused by a previously unrecorded fault.

In October 2013, Cebu and Bohol were hit by record-setting 7.2 magnitude earthquake which left 222 dead and collapsed some buildings, including 5 historical churches. There were over 700 aftershocks. The northern part of the province was devastated by Typhoon Haiyan a month later.

In December 2021, Typhoon Rai wreaked havoc across the province, leading to a declaration of &quot;calamity&quot; by the government.

==Geography==
Cebu is located to the east of Negros, to the west of Leyte and Bohol islands. The province consists of Cebu Island, as well as 167 smaller islands, which include Mactan, Bantayan, Malapascua, Olango and the Camotes Islands. But the highly urbanized cities of Cebu, Lapu-Lapu and Mandaue are independent cities not under provincial supervision, yet are often grouped with the province for geographical and statistical purposes.

The province&#x27;s land area is , or when the three independent cities (Cebu City, Lapu-Lapu and Mandaue) are included for geographical purposes, the total area is .

Cebu&#x27;s central location, proximity to an unusually exotic tourist destination, ready access to a diversity of plant, animal and geological wonders within the island, and remoteness from earthquake and typhoon activity are some of the special attributes of Cebu.

===Cebu Island===
Cebu Island is the 126th largest island in the world. Cebu Island itself is long and narrow, stretching from north to south and across at its widest point. It has narrow coastlines, limestone plateaus, and coastal plains. It also has rolling hills and rugged mountain ranges traversing the northern and southern lengths of the island.

Cebu&#x27;s highest mountains are over high. Flat tracts of land can be found in the city of Bogo and in the towns of San Remigio, Medellin and Daanbantayan at the northern region of the province.

The island&#x27;s area is , making it the 9th largest island in the Philippines. It supports over 5.2 million people, of which an estimated 2.9 million live in Metro Cebu.

Beaches, coral atolls, islands, and rich fishing grounds surround Cebu.

Coal was first discovered in Cebu about 1837. There were 15 localities over the whole island, on both coasts; some desultory mining had been carried out Naga near Mount Uling, but most serious operations were at Licos and Camansi west of Compostela and Danao. Active work ceased about 1895 with insurrections, and no production worked for more than ten years. A topographic and geologic survey of Compostela, Danao, and Carmen took place in 1906. The Compostela-Danao coalfield contained about six million workable tons. The tramroads, one from Danao to Camansi, one from Compostela to Mount Licos, were undertaken in 1895, together with a wagon road built in 1877, from Cotcot to Dapdap.

===Climate===

The climate of Cebu is tropical. There are 2 seasons in Cebu − the dry and wet season. It is dry and sunny most of the year with some occasional rains during the months of June to December. The province of Cebu normally gets typhoons once a year or none.

Northern Cebu gets more rainfall and typhoons than southern Cebu because it has a different climate. Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) hit Northern Cebu in 2013 killing 73 people and injuring 348 others. Though most typhoons hit only the northern part of Cebu, the urban areas in central Cebu are sometimes hit, such as when Typhoon Mike (Ruping), one of the worst to hit Cebu lashed the central Cebu area in 1990. 31 years later, Typhoon Rai struck the central and southern portions of the province.

Cebu&#x27;s temperatures can reach a high of from March to May, and as low as in the mountains during the wet season. The average temperature is around , and does not fluctuate much except during the month of May, which is the hottest month. Cebu averages 70–80% humidity.

===Fauna===
Endemic species in Cebu include the Cebu Flowerpecker (&quot;Dicaeum quadricolor&quot;), Cebu Slender Skink (&quot;Brachymeles cebuensis&quot;), Uling Goby (&quot;Sicyopus cebuensis&quot;), and Black Shama (&quot;Copsychus cebuensis&quot;).

There is also a subspecies of Idea leuconoe that is only endemic to Cebu. &quot;I. l. jumaloni&quot; is endemic to the area of Kawasan Falls in Badian, hence its common name, the &quot;Kawasan Paper Kite Butterfly&quot;. The subspecies is also named after Julian Jumalon, a Cebuano Lepidopterist and butterfly artist. The butterfly can also be observed in the Nug-as rainforest.

===Flora===
Cebu has little remaining forest cover. The remaining forest patches in Cebu are composed primarily of the following tree species.

*Mount Lantoy: &quot;Carallia brachiata&quot; and introduced species &quot;Tectona grandis&quot;, &quot;Swietenia macrophylla&quot;, &quot;Gmelina arborea&quot;, and &quot;Casuarina equisetifolia&quot;
*Palinipinon Mountains: &quot;Carallia brachiata&quot; and introduced species &quot;Swietenia macrophylla&quot;
*Nug-as forest: &quot;Ficus&quot; spp., &quot;Artocarpus blancoi&quot;, &quot;Macaranga grandifolia&quot;, and &quot;Cinnamomum cebuense&quot;
*Mount Lanaya: &quot;Carallia brachiata&quot;
*Mount Tabunan: &quot;Trevesia burckii&quot;, &quot;Voacanga globosa&quot;, &quot;Heptapleurum actinophyllum&quot;, &quot;Pouteria villamilii&quot;, and &quot;Palaquium luzoniense&quot;

===Administrative divisions===

The province of Cebu has 3 highly urbanized cities (the capital city of Cebu, Lapu-Lapu, and Mandaue) which are geographically grouped but governed independent from the province, 6 component cities (Bogo, Carcar, Danao, Naga, Talisay, and Toledo), and 44 municipalities for a total of 53 units as listed below:



















==Demographics==

The population of Cebu province, according to the 2020 Philippine census, was 3,325,385 with a density of . When the independent cities – Cebu City (964,169), Lapu-Lapu (497,604), and Mandaue (364,116) – are included for geographical purposes, the total population is 5,151,274 people, with a population density of 964 inhabitants per square kilometre (2,498/sq mi).

The population of the Central Visayas is predominantly young with about 37 percent of its population below 10 years old. This is very evident in the very broad base of the population pyramid in the region which has prevailed since 1970 but at a declining rate. A decline of 2.29 percentage points in the proportion of household population below 15 years old was noted from 1980 to 1995. Conversely, an increase of 3.06 percentage points was observed in the 15–64 age group during the same period. The population of the region is evenly distributed between males and females. However, the male population in the region has been increasing at a faster rate compared to the female population.

In 2010, the median age of the population of the province was 23.0 years, which means that half of the population was younger than 23.0 This is higher than the median age of 20.8 years that was recorded in 2000.

===Languages===
The Cebuano language is spoken in Cebu, which is also spoken in the rest of Central Visayas and most parts of Eastern Visayas, as well as most provinces of Mindanao.

In the Camotes Islands, especially in Poro, people there speak their own Visayan language called Porohanon, which has Masbateño and Waray-Waray influences. Some of the residents in Bantayan islands also speak Bantayanon, a Visayan language related to Waray-Waray.

Chinese Filipinos also speak Philippine Hokkien privately amongst fellow speakers in Cebu, while Mandarin (Standard Chinese) is also taught in Chinese class of Chinese Filipino schools.

===Religion===
====Catholicism====
The majority of its population are Roman Catholic followed by roughly 95% of Cebuanos. There are also followers of Iglesia Filipina Independiente, Islam, Buddhism and Hinduism. The increasing members of the Iglesia ni Cristo in the province has 3 subdivided district (Bogo City, Carcar City and Cebu City) chapels, dominating each cities and towns, while barrio chapels have 2-3% presence in the entire province.

Cebu is the capital of the Catholic faith by virtue of being the first Christian city, the first capital of the Spanish East Indies, and the birthplace of Christianity and the Philippine Church. Pope John Paul II, in his Homily for Families in Cebu (February 19, 1981), called the island as the birthplace of Christianity in the Philippines. At over 3,000,000 adherents, the province of Cebu has the highest number of Roman Catholics out of any province in the Philippines.

The image of &quot;Santo Niño de Cebú&quot; (Holy Child of Cebu), the oldest Christian image in the Philippines, is enshrined and venerated at the Basilica Minore del Santo Niño. According to Philippine historical documents, the statue of the Santo Niño (Holy Child) was given to Queen Humamay (also referred to as Hara Amihan and Queen Juana), the wife of Rajah Humabon (also referred to as Rajah Carlos), the Rajah of Cebu by the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan. The Cebuanos&#x27; acceptance of Christianity is depicted in Cebu&#x27;s cultural event, the Sinulog where street parades and loud drum beats preceded by a Christian Mass is celebrated every third Sunday of January. Cebu has a Roman Catholic Archdiocese and has several major churches, including the Basilica Minor del Santo Niño de Cebu, Cebu Metropolitan Cathedral, Santo Rosario Parish Church, San José–Recoletos Church, Sacred Heart Church, Archdiocesan Shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes, National Shrine of Our Lady of the Rule, National Shrine of Saint Joseph of Mandaue, Archdiocesan Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe of Cebu, San Nicolas de Tolentino Church, Archdiocesan Shrine of Patrocinio de Maria Santissima of Boljoon, and other Christian churches, as well as several other non-Catholic churches, mosques and temples.

==Economy==

&quot;Ceboom&quot;, a combination of &quot;Cebu&quot; and &quot;boom&quot;, has been used to describe the province&#x27;s economic development. With many beautiful islands, white sand beaches, luxury hotels and resorts, diving locations and heritage sites, high domestic and foreign tourist arrivals have fueled the tourism industry of Cebu. Cebu consistently gets a big share of tourist arrivals in the Philippines and has become the tourist gateway to Central and Southern Philippines due to its central geographic location, accessibility, and natural resources. The province also hosts various national and international conferences every year.

About 80% of domestic and international shipping operators and shipbuilders in the Philippines are located in Cebu. Shipbuilding companies in Cebu have manufactured bulk carriers of up to , and double-hulled fastcraft as well. Cebu&#x27;s industry helps make the Philippines the 5th largest shipbuilding country in the world.

Cebu&#x27;s extensive port facilities and its proximity to intra-Asian shipping and air routes are major factors which led multinational companies to establish offices or factories on the main island, as well as in the island of Mactan, where they are clustered in special economic zones known as the Mactan Economic Processing Zone 1 (MEPZ-1) and the Mactan Economic Processing Zone 2 (MEPZ-2). Due to its burgeoning furniture-making industry, Cebu has been named as the furniture capital of the Philippines. Cebu&#x27;s other exports include: fashion accessories, guitars, coconut, coconut oil, dried mangoes, carrageenan, gifts, toys, watches, cameras, electronic components, and housewares.

With a revenue growth rate of 18.8 percent in 2012, the real estate industry is the fastest-growing sector in Cebu. With the strong economic indicators and high investors&#x27; confidence level, more condominium projects and hypermarkets are being developed in the locality. An additional 100 commercial and residential buildings would be completed by 2015 and another 170 to 200 buildings are expected to be finished by 2017. 64 new hypermarkets will be developed in Cebu.

In 2013, Cebu ranked 8th worldwide in the &quot;Top 100 BPO Destinations Report&quot; by global advisory firm, Tholons. The Cebu Chamber of Commerce and Industry, an organization of Cebu&#x27;s businesses, is promoting the city&#x27;s growth and economy on information and communications technology, with the aim of making Cebu the premier ICT, software and e-services investment destination in southeast Asia. Data gathered by the National Economic Development Authority (Neda) 7 showed that of the 98 BPO and IT companies operating in Cebu, 32 offer voice operations while 66 companies offer non-voice operations. Of the 95,000 employed by the industry, more than half or 50,000 are in the non-voice sector. In 2012, the growth in IT-BPO revenues in Cebu grew 26.9 percent at $484 million, while nationally, the industry grew 18.2 percent at $13 billion.

Cebu&#x27;s economy is also driven by the mining and quarrying areas in Toledo, Naga, Alcoy, and Danao.

Cebu even boasts being a subsidiary of one of the leading ice rink manufacturers in the world. These rinks are engineered and fabricated in Cebu by Ice Rink Supply and shipped worldwide and Freeze Point Rink Services.

Tourism is an important industry for the province. In 2019, Cebu welcomed 1.4 million foreign tourists, and is one of the most visited in the country by both domestic and foreign visitors. Cebu Island has also entered the list of Condé Nast Traveler&#x27;s World&#x27;s Best Islands rankings thrice: 2016, 2017 and 2019. Cebu City and Cebu Province, despite being administratively separated from each other, are often marketed as a single tourist destination, combining natural countryside scenery with urban attractions including cultural-historical sites and developing infrastructure.

==Infrastructure==
Mactan–Cebu International Airport (MCIA) on the island of Mactan serves as the main gateway to domestic and international routes to or from Cebu City and other islands in the Visayas region. In the last 15 years, MCIA&#x27;s passenger traffic has grown at an annual average of 21% for international passenger traffic. The airport is the second busiest airport in the Philippines in passenger and cargo traffic. The plan for a new terminal expansion of the airport is underway and estimated to cost $240 million under a public-private partnership program of the Philippine government. The new terminal will host international flights while the old terminal will host domestic flights.

In addition, MCIA Authority (MCIAA) General Manager Nigel Paul Villarete also proposed to establish a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) line to transport airport passengers to and from MCIAA and different parts of Cebu. This will be integrated into the proposed Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) System being planned in Metro Cebu.

The Port of Cebu is the largest shipping hub in the Visayas region.

Cebu Pacific Air is an airline owned by Cebu-based Gokongwei family. On May 28, 2008, Cebu Pacific was named as the world&#x27;s number one airline in terms of growth. The airline carried a total of almost 5.5 million passengers in 2007, up 57.4% from 2006. On January 6, 2011, Cebu Pacific flew its 50 millionth passenger (from Manila to Beijing). The airline reached the 100 million passengers in 2015. Cebu Pacific commenced international long-haul flights to Middle East and Australia, flight to Guam starting Q1 2016.

Notable business districts are the Cebu Business Park and the Cebu IT Park. This area hosts industries related to the information technology industry such as software development, telecommunications, engineering research and development centers, and business process outsourcing. In 2013, Ayala Corporation&#x27;s affiliate, Ayala Land Inc., announced that it is looking at introducing another business park development within the Cebu City area to optimize the high performance of real estate investments in Cebu.

The city&#x27;s reclamation forms South Road Properties – a mixed-use development south of the city which features entertainment, leisure, residential and business-processing industries. Is the site of SM Seaside City Cebu, the eighth largest mall in the world (and 3rd largest shopping mall in the Philippines), Filinvest&#x27;s Citta di Mare and Il Corso,
and the University of the Philippines – Cebu campus.

In Mactan Island, Megaworld Corporation&#x27;s Mactan Newtown is a 25-hectare business park near Shangri-La&#x27;s Mactan Resort and Spa. The project will be home to high-tech offices, a retail center, residential towers and villages, leisure facilities with a beach resort frontage.

Mactan Island is linked to mainland Cebu via Mactan-Mandaue Bridge and Marcelo Fernan Bridge.

==Media==

Cebu is home to a local television station, Cebu Catholic Television Network (CCTN).

Despite having their own local stations, Cebuanos prefer to watch the Philippines&#x27;s several dominant television networks, namely: ABS-CBN, People&#x27;s Television Network, IBC, TV5, CNN Philippines and GMA Network.

While national newspapers have a presence on the island, Cebu has English-language local newspapers – &quot;The Freeman&quot; (under the Star Group), &quot;SunStar Cebu&quot; and &quot;Cebu Daily News&quot; (under the Inquirer Group): and Cebuano-language newspapers – &quot;SunStar SuperBalita&quot; owned by SunStar, and &quot;Banat News&quot; owned by &quot;The Freeman&quot;. Each of the local newspapers sell cheaper than their national counterparts.

==Education==
The Philippine elementary school begins from Grades 1 to 6. The high school program takes six years, from Grades 7 through to 12, taken after graduating from elementary school. Cebu is considered as the main education hub in the Visayas. It has eleven large universities each with a number of college branches mostly throughout the capital, Cebu City, and more than a dozen other schools and universities specializing in various courses such as Medicine, Engineering, Nautical courses, Nursing, Law, Commerce, Education, Computer and IT and other professions.

The most prominent of these universities are (in alphabetical order):

Cebu is considered to be a hub of medical education, with many international students coming to study medicine in Cebu&#x27;s medical schools. Some of Cebu&#x27;s well-known medical schools are in Cebu Doctors University and Cebu Institute of Medicine.

==Tourism==
===Attractions===
Cebu City is a significant cultural centre in the Philippines. The imprint of Spanish and Roman Catholic culture is evident. There are also many historically important sights all over the province.

===Cuisine===

Cebu also has a great number of delicacies from every town. Much of the delicacies are either Precolonial or influenced by Spanish or Chinese cuisines.

===Significant dates===

;Cebu Provincial Charter Day

The province celebrates its charterhood August 6 each year. It is considered a special non-working holiday throughout the entire province, including the three independent city states.

During the monthly celebration of Cebu&#x27;s provincial charterhood, the province hosts a variety of events in line with the aim for unity among all Cebuanos. As part of the Founding Anniversary Celebration of the province, the capitol hosts the &quot;Tabo sa Kapitolyo&quot;, a provincial trade fair that features all the products, delicacies, and other specialties from each City and Municipality in the province. The province also hosts the &quot;Pasigarbo sa Sugbo&quot; Festival of Festivals, a celebration that showcases all festivals from every town of Cebu and is meant to highlight the culture, history, traditions, and way of life of all Cebuanos.

;Semana Santa sa Bantayan

The Semana Santa of Bantayan is the local Holy Week celebration in the town of Bantayan. It is largely considered the grandest celebration of Holy Week in the Visayas. The celebration features lifelike Passus depicting the Passion and Death of Jesus on top of intricate caroes that are paraded throughout the entire town.

One thing that makes the Holy Week and Lenten Celebration of Bantayan unique from other Holy Week observations of other parts of Cebu and the Philippines (and, quite possibly, the world) is that traditional Lenten Fast is not strictly observed during Holy Week. This is because the town of Bantayan has received an exemption from the traditional Lenten fast directly from the Vatican. The exemption or special permission dated July 27, 1824, which is formally known as &quot;Bantayan Indult&quot;, was signed by Pope Leo XII himself. The Bantayan Indult was given through Padre Doroteo Andrada Del Rosario and allows the consumption of meat on days of fasting and obligation. The original document is being kept at the Bantayan Museum in Bantayan Island.

There are several speculations as to why the town made the request for an indult. The most probable reason for having this indult is because people in the town would usually avoid fishing during Holy Week. This is likely because, at the time, all forms of work was prohibited, including fishing and aquaculture. Without anyone supplying fish, the only allowed meat for fasting, to the town, the Bantayanons were left with no choice but to eat the meat that is normally prohibited in Lent. There is also another reason for this based on folk beliefs. Because of the local belief that evil powers and malignant entities are stronger during Good Friday, the day of the death of Jesus, the fishermen of the town would deem it too unsafe to fish, in fear that an evil presence will come upon them at sea.

In truth, the indult has long expired and is no longer valid, however, Bantayanons today still practice eating the usually forbidden meat during Holy Week as it has already become part of their Lenten traditions.

;Gabii sa Kabilin

Translating to &quot;Heritage Night&quot;, it is a program initiated by the Ramon Aboitiz Foundation Incorporated in 2007. Gabii sa Kabilin is an event that aims to help preserve Cebu&#x27;s rich history, culture and heritage, by encouraging the public to visit the different museums and heritage structures of Cebu. For one night, all the museums and heritage structures of Cebu all open their doors for all people in order for them to learn about the history of Cebu, as well as its heritage and cultural legacy. Although most of the heritage locations that participate in the heritage night are from Cebu City, there are also other locations that are from the other parts of the province. Museo Sugbo, the provincial museum, and the National Museum of the Philippines of Cebu are among the participating museums of Gabii sa Kabilin.

===Festivals===

;Sinulog

The Sinulog Festival is the largest fiesta (festival) in the Philippines. Held every third Sunday of January, it commemorates the Child Jesus (&quot;Santo Niño&quot;), the Lord and Protector of Cebu. The Sinulog is a dance ritual of pre-Hispanic indigenous origin. The dancer moves two steps forward and one step backward to the rhythmic sound of drums. This movement resembles the current (&quot;sulog&quot;) of what was then known as Cebu&#x27;s Pahina River. Thus the name Sinulog.

The Sinulog Festival celebration lasts for nine days, culminating on the final day with the Sinulog Grand Parade. The day before the parade, the Fluvial Procession is held at dawn with a statue of the Santo Niño carried on a pump boat from Mandaue City to Cebu City, decked with hundreds of flowers and candles. The procession ends at the Basilica where a re-enactment of the Christianization of the Philippines on the island of Cebu is performed. In the afternoon, a more solemn procession takes place along the major streets of the city, which last for hours due to large crowds participating in the event.

When the Spaniards arrived in Cebu, the Italian chronicler, Antonio Pigafetta, sailing under convoy with the Magellan expedition, offered the wooden figure of the Santo Niño as a baptismal gift to Hara Amihan, wife of Rajah Humabon who was named Juana after her baptism together with the Rajah, who was also renamed, Carlos. Juana, together with the natives, according to tradition, danced and worshipped the Santo Niño de Cebu in their indigenous Sinulog dance ritual. According to legend, the Rajah&#x27;s adviser, Baladhay, had fallen ill and was bedridden. The Rajah ordered his men to place Baladhay before the image of Santo Niño hoping that the Holy Child would heal him. The next day, the whole Kingdom of Sugbo was awoken to an angry Baladhay who was threatening the Child with a grass knife, appearing to have also fully recovered from his illness. When the Rajah asked him why he was threatening the Child, he told the Rajah that the Child Jesus had mischievously woken him up with a coconut midrib. Irritated by the Child, he grabbed his knife and threatened the Child by swaying the grass knife at the Child, but the Child simply evaded the knife by dancing. Because the Child was so swift at evading the knife, he had no choice but to dance with the Child as well to keep up his pace. He also explained that the Child&#x27;s dance resembled the river current. Baladhay is believed to be the first person to dance the Sinulog. The Sinulog ritual was preserved after the Spaniards colonized the Philippines, with the focus still on the worship to the Santo Niño. Once the Santo Niño church was built in the 16th century, the Catholic Malay people started performing the Sinulog ritual in front of the church, the devotees offering candles and indigenous dancers shouting &quot;Viva Pit Señor!&quot;, which means to &quot;Trust in the Lord&quot;.

In the province, the festival is shared by both Cebu City and Carmen. The festival is said to have originated in Carmen and was once a localized version of the Ati-atihan Festival introduced by Jose Motos, the then rector of the Parish of St. Augustine, the town parish of Carmen, but was then changed to &quot;Sinulog sa Carmen&quot; after Sinulog became an established Cebuano festival. The Sinulog dance was first introduced to Cebu City by a woman named Estelita Diola, who would otherwise be referred to as &quot;Titang Diola&quot;. Her family was skilled with the original form of the dance of Sinulog and the tradition was eventually passed on to her by her father. Because of her great contribution and propagation of the Sinulog dance of Cebu, she was referred to as the &quot;Heritage Keeper&quot;. The original Sinulog dance and her legacy of devotion to the Child Jesus through dancing continues today even after her death and is still continued through her former students who now teach the youth of Cebu the original dance moves of Sinulog. Sinulog had since very much diversified from the original dance of Titang Diola. Today we can see the Sinulog danced every day at the Basilica Minore del Santo Niño performed by the candle vendors. The version they perform is called &quot;Sinug&quot; and is only for worship and prayer to bless the candles for prayers to the Holy Child. The Sinulog Festival dance performed by contingents in the City Sports Center is still religious and devotional since dancers often include personal supplications, petitions, thanksgivings, intercessions, or any other prayers in their dance for the Child Jesus and their dance performances in street dance and ritual showdown are still centered on the Holy Child. There are mainly two types of Sinulog dances performed in the festival, namely the &quot;Sinulog-Based Category&quot; and the &quot;Free Interpretation Category&quot;. The Sinulog-Based Category refers to the Sinulog dance based on the Church Sinulog performed by candle vendors while the Free Interpretation Category refers to the Sinulog dance interpreted in any way, outside Church Sinulog, for as long as it is acceptable in the festival. In recent years, the festival gained commercialization which made the festival and Cebu popular, but unfortunately lessened the religious nature of the festival. Despite the extreme commercialization of the festival, Sinulog still remains to be a religious festival for the faithful. Sinulog still remains to be a dance of prayer. The festival is officially governed by the Sinulog Foundation Incorporated (SFI). The foundation maintains that, although Sinulog has largely become mainstream, it remains a religious festival because at the heart of the Sinulog is the Santo Niño. The foundation has made this point clear in many instances, such as the correction of the wrongful term &quot;Sinulog Grand Mardi Gras&quot; to &quot;Sinulog Grand Parade&quot; as the focus was not on the fanfare but the worship to the Child Jesus.

In the 1980s and 2000s, the city authorities of Cebu added the religious feast of Santo Niño de Cebu during the Sinulog Festival to its cultural event. Despite being a religious festival and a Christian festival, Sinulog has come to be a celebration for all Cebuanos and Filipinos regardless of their faith and practices. Aside from its religious nature, Sinulog has also become renowned for its street parties. In 2012, Cebu introduced Life Dance, the biggest outdoor dance party in the Philippines. The Sinulog street parties are considered a major attraction for youth individuals but, in most cases for most people, particularly the faithful, a growing problem that threatens the religiosity and solemnity of the festival. In 2016, the festival had the worst recorded case of a stampede wherein large groups of people, both worshippers and drunken party-goers, were congested in the uptown area, with no passable exit routes and virtually no crowd control up until midnight and with one recorded case of a teenage woman losing consciousness because of cramped spaces. Due to this incident, the then Cebu City Mayor Tomas Osmeña enforced a strict liquor ban in the following festivals during his term to ensure the safety of the worshippers and spectators and to maintain the solemnity of the celebration.

The festival was halted for two years (2021 - 2022). In 2021, the main reason for halting the festival was because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Vice Mayor of Cebu at the time, Michael Rama, who was the-then chairperson of the SFI, insisted on having a Sinulog Festival that year, despite health concerns from health experts and the police from Cebu City. This came shortly after Cebu City&#x27;s then Mayor, the late Edgardo Labella, dissolving the Sinulog Governing Body (SGB), which Rama protested against through his resignation from the foundation, and reinstating him as chairperson of the SFI. Rama cited that the venue of that year&#x27;s supposed festival was at the parking lot of SM Seaside City Cebu and would be in a &quot;bubble environment&quot; without a live audience. He even went as far as to limit the number of dancers and the propsmen. He continued to insist on holding the festival, largely against the behest of the Cebuanos. Various health workers and police officials stated that even though the dancers were isolated, the fact that there were multiple individuals gathering in a closed environment, and in close contact with each other, was already a &quot;direct violation of the health protocols&quot;. This also included the gathering of dancers during their practices. As a result, several dancers from various contingents in Cebu City tested positive for COVID-19 and most of the infected individuals showed the common symptoms. This led to Rama officially retracting his movement for Sinulog 2021. However, the other minor related competitions of the Sinulog, such as the &quot;Search for the Sinulog Festival Queen&quot; were still pushed through. The festival was slated for a comeback in 2022, but was again cancelled due to the aftermath of Super Typhoon Odette, which ravaged Cebu and nearby islands. Sinulog eventually was celebrated again in 2023, but was met with controversy. Rama, who is currently the mayor of Cebu City, decided to move the festival from its usual venue at the Cebu City Sports Complex to Citi di Mare at the South Road Properties. This was met with flak by the Cebuanos as, not only was the Sports Complex the established venue of the festival, but also because the festival was to be moved to a major road that is an important passageway for travellers going from the North to the South and back. Initially, the provincial governor, Gwendolyn Garcia, was not against the move to change the venue of the Sinulog, but immediately changed her mind after she had seen pictures from a newspaper photographer of provincial Sinulog contingents having blockings for their dances in the new venue for the Sinulog which was deeply covered in mud and was completely unfinished. Feeling pity for the dancers, she made the decision to remove the provincial contingents from the grand parade, unless Rama would return the festival to the old venue. Unfortunately, Rama continued insisting on having the Sinulog in SRP and the festival was indeed pushed through in the new venue without the provincial contingents. Not only was the quality of the festival much more lack-luster than it usually was, but there was also heavy traffic during and immediately after the festival as the North and Southbound travelers had to go through the much tighter roads of the city. The provincial contingents, however, did perform in the Sinulog Festival in Carmen that year, which was also the 50th anniversary of the festival in their town. The festival, for the first time, had two major parades in 2024. The &quot;Sinulog sa Lalawigan&quot;, which was originally the preliminary competition &quot;Sinulog sa Kabataan sa Lalawigan&quot;, was transformed into a Sinulog parade for provincial contingents since they could not, once again, dance in SRP. The Sinulog sa Lalawigan was held in the CCSC, the old venue of Sinulog. The other contingents from Cebu City and out-of-town danced in the Sinulog parade on the 3rd Sunday of January in SRP. On the 21st of August, this year, Cebu City Acting Mayor, Raymond Alvin Garcia declared that Sinulog Festival 2025 will return to CCSC.

;Kadaugan sa Mactan

Literally translates to the &quot;Victory in Mactan&quot;, this is a historical festival reenactment of the Battle of Mactan. Celebrated canonically on April 27, it depicts the events before, during, and immediately after the defeat of Portuguese Navigator Ferdinand Magellan at the hands of Lapu-lapu and his men. Much of the historical activities take place in Mactan Shrine, the site of the Battle of Mactan. Usually, in the Kadaugan sa Mactan, Filipino celebrities, especially celebrities of Cebuano origin, are chosen to portray the key characters of the events of the Battle of Mactan (specifically Lapu-lapu, his wife &quot;Reyna Bulakna&quot;, and Magellan). This is typically a week-long celebration and culminates with the &quot;Rampada Festival&quot;, a stylized contemporary reenactment of the victory celebration after the battle in Mactan, incorporating Latin and ballroom dances and steps. Despite the Sinulog Festival being more popular by comparison, the Kadaugan had already been established as a festival of Cebu and its culture and history long before Sinulog was an established festival.

;Pasigarbo sa Sugbo

Literally translates to the &quot;Celebration in Cebu&quot;, this Festival is a relatively new festival in Cebu, conceptualized in 2008. This festival was the &quot;Brainchild&quot; of Cebu&#x27;s first female governor, Gwendolyn Garcia. This festival was a program and a major tourism endeavor initiated by the governor in order to promote Cebu as an entire province and to celebrate Cebu in its culture, faith, history, and continuous advancement. In this festival, each individual town in Cebu is encouraged to showcase a theme, a product, a festival, or something unique from their place. Despite, in itself, not being a religious festival, praise, thanksgiving, and worship to God, as well as devotion to the patron saints of each town of Cebu is also given emphasis in the festival (as hinted in the category for portable processional platforms for patron saints or &quot;Best in Andas&quot; category). Unlike the Sinulog Festival, which is limited to two major categories (Sinulog-based and Free Interpretation), Participants of Pasigarbo are given more freedom in the interpretation of the culture, faith, history, and products of their hometowns. Ever since its conception, the festival had been celebrated yearly at the Cebu International Convention Center (CICC) in Mandaue, around the date of the Provincial Charter Day of Cebu, which is celebrated every August 6, however, was ceased after 2012. This was largely due to the 2013 Bohol earthquake, which also heavily affected Cebu, as well as the lack of support from the provincial government for both the repair of the CICC and the festival itself. This was mainly because Garcia was no longer in position as governor at the time. Fortunately, the festival was recently relaunched in 2019, less than a month after Garcia&#x27;s return to the provincial seat. Unlike previous celebrations, the 2019 Pasigarbo, due to the abandoned state of the CICC, was celebrated, much like the Sinulog Festival, in the Cebu City Sports Complex. As per its return, it has established itself once more as a provincial festival and a new addition to Cebu&#x27;s prime festivals and significant dates, together with the Sinulog Festival and the Kadaugan sa Mactan. The festival was also halted in 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic but returned the following year in 2022. In 2022, the festival had a grand comeback and was even participated by the festivals of all three independent city states (Sinulog Festival of Cebu City, Panagtagbo Festival of Mandaue City, and the Garbo Festival of Lapu-lapu City), with cities Cebu and Lapu-lapu being guest performers. The festival was again moved to the Carcar City Sports Complex that year. This was due to the ongoing renovation of the Cebu City Sports Complex, its usual venue. The move to Carcar City, was initially a very openly accepted one, however, the festival was marred by various technical difficulties on the day of the Pasigarbo sa Sugbo. Among the major problems during the festival proper was the sound glitches in certain festival jingles and in the Mayor&#x27;s introductory videos, which was a new feature in this particular festival celebration. The sound glitches consisted mostly of sudden stops of the music of each festival performance, either as just a random audio cut or a complete loss of music. Governor Garcia publicly accused the sounds and lights provider for allegedly &quot;sabotaging&quot; the festival in most of the occurrences of a sound glitch. This accusation of a sabotage from the sounds and lights company head was largely due to the alleged nondisclosure that his daughter was a contestant for festival queen, who was also originally hailed as the Pasigarbo sa Sugbo Festival queen that year, with her contingent being the original champion. Though his daughter was chosen to be festival queen by the Carcar City Government for being the reigning Kabkaban Festival Queen at that time, the governor still insisted that this was a sabotage on his part under the reason that he had not fully disclosed his daughter&#x27;s participation in the festival. This resulted in the postponement of the awarding ceremonies for that year&#x27;s festival and a re-tabulation of the scoresheets of each festival. This further resulted in the candidate from Carcar losing her crown and the Kabkaban Festival contingent from Carcar losing their championship and being demoted to 6th place. The new festival queen was the candidate from Cordova and the new champion was the Sugat Kabanhawan Festival contingent from Minglanilla. The awarding ceremonies were held two months after the actual festival in the Cebu Technological University-Dumanjug Campus. The festival was moved back to CCSC this year. This year, the festival was considered the &quot;grandest&quot;, to date. Among the new additions and changes to the festival was the change of the processional Andas to the much larger processional &quot;Caro&quot; or processional carriage. This year, Naga&#x27;s Dagitab Festival was the new champion in the ritual showdown category and the Kabkaban festival was the champion of the street dancing category, with their queen becoming this year&#x27;s festival queen. A special award was given to the town of Dumanjug for coming up with an impromptu float using the props of the town&#x27;s Bisnok Festival after their original float had suddenly caught fire and was completely destroyed and for giving an all out performance in the festival, in spite of the unforeseen events that transpired in this year&#x27;s festival.

It replaced the Mantawi Festival as the festival of Mandaue.

The festival&#x27;s name is taken from the term &quot;Sugat&quot; (Cebuano) or &quot;Salubong&quot; (Filipino) which is a traditional practice during Easter Vigils wherein an image of Christ is shown before an image of the Virgin Mary that is covered in a black veil to show her mourning and sadness, which is then lifted by angels, exposing the Virgin Mary with unspeakable joy at the Resurrection of Jesus. The second part of the name is the Cebuano word for &quot;resurrection&quot;, which is timely for the religious celebration. The festival is centered on the life of Jesus, as well as Christian Morals and Values, with both themes being heavily incorporated in the performances of the dancers in the festival. This festival has gained Minglanilla the title as the &quot;Easter Capital of Cebu&quot;. The festival was the champion of Pasigarbo sa Sugbo 2023.

;Kabkaban

The Kabkaban Festival is the local religious festival of the City of Carcar in honor of St. Catherine of Alexandria. The festival&#x27;s name was the old name of Carcar, which was taken from &quot;Kabkab&quot; (&quot;Kabkaban&quot; for plural), the local term for the Oakleaf Fern (Aglaomorpha quercifolia). The festival celebrates Carcar, as well as the Carcaranon way of life and the town&#x27;s culture, faith, and musical history. Much of the dance steps used in the Kabkaban dance were taken and inspired directly from the dance moves used in the Sinulog Festival and other Sinulog dance offerings by the Sandiego Family with their company, the &quot;Sandiego Dance Company&quot;, headed by Val Sandiego, a native of Carcar who is also considered as the &quot;Father of Kabkaban&quot;. The inspiration from the dance company is also evident in the costumes used by the dancers of the Kabkaban Festival, as well as dancers representing Carcar in the Sinulog Festival or other festivals like the Pasigarbo sa Sugbo Festival of Festivals. The Kabkaban festival is also one of the consistent champions of Pasigarbo sa Sugbo, with 3 titles attributed to them (2011, 2019, 2022) and the most number of festival queens and awards under their belt.

Because Argao is one of Cebu&#x27;s Spanish Towns (the other being Liloan), dancers in the La Torta Festival wear Spanish inspired costumes that usually have a red motif to them and dance Spanish dance steps or Spanish-inspired dance steps.

;Dagitab

The Dagitab Festival is Naga&#x27;s Christmas Festival. It is in honor of St. Francis of Assisi.

During December, Naga&#x27;s streets, parks, and buildings are lit with all sorts of bright lights of different colors to mark the Holiday Season. But these bright lights come at a cost, power outages. To resolve this problem, Gov. Gwen Garcia, together with the province of Cebu, set up another electric company to supply electricity in the town. The onset of electric advancements and greater connection initiated the start of the industrialization of Naga. The industrial movement is also one of the focuses of the festival. Dancers in the Dagitab Festival wear and incorporate LED lights/lamps in their lively performances to bring the Holiday Spirit to everyone and to celebrate the advancement of the city. This festival has gained Naga the titles of being the &quot;Christmas Capital of Cebu&quot; and the &quot;Industrial Hub of the South&quot;.

<doc id="160283" wikidata="Q1164129" url="?curid=160283" title="Malayalam script">
<text>Malayalam script (; / ) is a Brahmic script used commonly to write Malayalam, which is the principal language of Kerala, India, spoken by 45 million people in the world. It is a Dravidian language spoken in the Indian state of Kerala and the union territories of Lakshadweep and Puducherry (Mahé district) by the Malayali people. It is one of the official scripts of the Indian Republic. Malayalam script is also widely used for writing Sanskrit texts in Kerala.

The Malayalam script bears high similarity with Tulu Script and Tigalari script, which was used for writing the Tulu language, spoken in coastal Karnataka (Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts) and the northernmost Kasargod district of Kerala. Like many other Indic scripts, it is an alphasyllabary (abugida), a writing system that is partially &quot;alphabetic&quot; and partially syllable-based. The modern Malayalam alphabet has 15 vowel letters, 42 consonant letters, and a few other symbols. The Malayalam script is a Vatteluttu alphabet extended with symbols from the Grantha alphabet to represent Indo-Aryan loanwords.
The script is also used to write several minority languages such as Paniya, Betta Kurumba, and Ravula. The Malayalam language itself was historically written in several different scripts.

==History==
Malayalam was first written in the Vattezhuthu script, an ancient script of Tamil and Malayalam languages. However, the modern Malayalam script evolved from the Grantha alphabet, and Vattezhuthu, both of which evolved from the Tamil-Brahmi, but independently.

Vatteluttu () is a script that had evolved from Tamil-Brahmi and was once used extensively in the southern part of present-day Tamil Nadu and in Kerala. The Vazhappally inscription issued by Rajashekhara Varman is the earliest example, dating from about 830 CE. During the medieval period, the Tigalari script that was used for writing Tulu in South Canara, and Sanskrit in the adjacent Malabar region, was very similar to the modern Malayalam script. In the Tamil state, the modern Tamil script had supplanted Vattezhuthu by the 15th century, but in the Malabar region, Vattezhuthu remained in general use up to the 17th century, or the 18th century. A variant form of this script, Kolezhuthu, was used until about the 19th century mainly in the Malabar-Cochin area. Another variant form, Malayanma, was used in the south of Thiruvananthapuram.

According to Arthur Coke Burnell, one form of the Grantha alphabet, originally used in the Chola dynasty, was imported into the southwest coast of India in the 8th or 9th century, which was then modified in course of time in this secluded area, where communication with the east coast was very limited. It later evolved into Tigalari-Malayalam script was used by the Malayali, Havyaka Brahmins and Tulu Brahmin people, but was originally only applied to write Sanskrit. This script split into two scripts: Tigalari and Malayalam. While Malayalam script was extended and modified to write vernacular language Malayalam, the Tigalari was written for Sanskrit only. In Malabar, this writing system was termed Arya-eluttu (, &quot;Ārya eḻuttŭ&quot;), meaning &quot;Arya writing&quot; (Sanskrit is Indo-Aryan language while Malayalam is a Dravidian language).

Vatteluttu was in general use, but was not suitable for literature where many Sanskrit words were used. Like Tamil-Brahmi, it was originally used to write Tamil, and as such, did not have letters for voiced or aspirated consonants used in Sanskrit but not used in Tamil. For this reason, Vatteluttu and the Grantha alphabet were sometimes mixed, as in the Manipravalam. One of the oldest examples of the Manipravalam literature, &quot;Vaishikatantram&quot; (, &quot;Vaiśikatantram&quot;), dates back to the 12th century, where the earliest form of the Malayalam script was used, which seems to have been systematised to some extent by the first half of the 13th century.

It is Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan who is also credited with the development of Malayalam script into the current form through the intermixing and modification of the erstwhile scripts of &quot;Vatteluttu&quot;, &quot;Kolezhuthu&quot;, and Grantha script, which were used to write the inscriptions and literary works of Old and Middle Malayalam. He further eliminated excess and unnecessary letters from the modified script. Hence, Ezhuthachan is also known as &quot;The Father of modern Malayalam&quot;. The development of modern Malayalam script was also heavily influenced by the Tigalari script, which was used to write the Tulu language, due to the influence of Tuluva Brahmins in Kerala.

Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan, a poet from around the 16th century, used Arya-eluttu to write his Malayalam poems based on Classical Sanskrit literature. For a few letters missing in Arya-eluttu (&quot;ḷa&quot;, &quot;ḻa&quot;, &quot;ṟa&quot;), he used Vatteluttu. His works became unprecedentedly popular to the point that the Malayali people eventually started to call him the father of the Malayalam language, which also popularised Arya-eluttu as a script to write Malayalam. However, Grantha did not have distinctions between &quot;e&quot; and &quot;ē&quot;, and between &quot;o&quot; and &quot;ō&quot;, as it was as an alphabet to write a Sanskrit language. The Malayalam script as it is today was modified in the middle of the 19th century when Hermann Gundert invented the new vowel signs to distinguish them.

By the 19th century, old scripts like Kolezhuthu had been supplanted by Arya-eluttu – that is the current Malayalam script. Nowadays, it is widely used in the press of the Malayali population in Kerala.

==Orthography reform==
In 1971, the Government of Kerala reformed the orthography of Malayalam by a government order to the education department. The objective was to simplify the script for print and typewriting technology of that time, by reducing the number of glyphs required. In 1967, the government appointed a committee headed by Sooranad Kunjan Pillai, who was the editor of the Malayalam Lexicon project. It reduced number of glyphs required for Malayalam printing from around 1000 to around 250. Above committee&#x27;s recommendations were further modified by another committee in 1969.

This proposal was later accepted by major newspapers in January 1971. The reformed script came into effect on 15 April 1971 (the Kerala New Year), by a government order released on 23 March 1971.

=== Recommendations by the committees ===

==== Use non-ligating vowel signs for &quot;u&quot;, &quot;ū&quot;, and &quot;r̥&quot; ====
In the traditional orthography that had been taught in the primary education system before the reforms, any consonant or consonant ligature followed by the vowel sign &quot;u&quot;, &quot;ū&quot;, or &quot;r̥&quot; were represented by a cursive consonant-vowel ligature. The glyph of each consonant had its own way of ligating with these vowel signs. This irregularity was simplified in the reformed script. Thus, a vowel sign or consonant sign would always have a disconnected symbol that did not fuse with the base consonant.

Examples:
* &quot;ku:&quot; → 
* &quot;kū:&quot; → 
* &quot;kr̥:&quot; → 
* &quot;nu:&quot; → 
* &quot;śu:&quot; → 

==== Split uncommon conjuncts with &quot;Chandrakkala&quot; ====
Also, most of traditional consonant-consonant ligatures, especially the less common ones only used to write words of Sanskrit origin, were split into non-ligated forms with explicit &quot;chandrakkala&quot;. For example:
* &quot;g&quot; + &quot;da&quot; = &quot;gda:&quot; -&gt; 
* &quot;l&quot; + &quot;ta&quot; = &quot;lta:&quot; -&gt; 
* &quot;ś&quot; + &quot;na&quot; = &quot;śna:&quot; -&gt; 
* &quot;ś&quot; + &quot;ma&quot; = &quot;śma:&quot; -&gt; 

# The ligature (&#x27;) &quot;śma&quot; is required as an additional letter. For examples, &#x27;, &quot;śmaśanam&quot;, is the word for cemetery.

==== Use non-ligating sign for conjoining &quot;ra&quot; ====
Any consonant or consonant ligature followed by the conjoining &quot;ra&quot; is represented by a cursive tail attached to the consonant or the consonant-ligature. In the reformed script, this consonant sign would be disconnected from the base and represented as a left-bracket like symbol placed on the left side of the cluster.
* &quot;kra:&quot; → 
* &quot;kru:&quot; → 

=== Current status ===
Today the reformed orthography, is commonly called &quot;put̪iya lipi&quot; () and traditional system, &quot;pazhaya lipi&quot; (). Current print media almost entirely uses reformed orthography. The state run primary education introduces the Malayalam writing to the pupils in reformed script only and the books are printed accordingly. However, the digital media uses both traditional and reformed in almost equal proportions as the fonts for both the orthographies are commonly available.

==Description==

===Characteristics===
The basic characters can be classified as follows:
* Vowels (, &quot;svaram&quot;)
*# Independent vowel letters
*# Dependent vowel signs (,&quot;svarachinnam&quot;)
* Consonant letters (, &quot;vyañjanam&quot;)

An independent vowel letter is used as the first letter of a word that begins with a vowel. A consonant letter, despite its name, does not represent a pure consonant, but represents a consonant + a short vowel /a/ by default. For example, is the first consonant letter of the Malayalam alphabet, which represents /ka/, not a simple /k/. A vowel sign is a diacritic attached to a consonant letter to indicate that the consonant is followed by a vowel other than /a/. If the following vowel is /a/, no vowel sign is needed. The phoneme /a/ that follows a consonant by default is called an inherent vowel. In Malayalam, its phonetic value is unrounded , or as an allophone. To denote a pure consonant sound not followed by a vowel, a special diacritic &quot;virama&quot; is used to cancel the inherent vowel. The following are examples where a consonant letter is used with or without a diacritic.
* /k/ = /k/ which is a consonant sound
* &quot;ka&quot; = /k/ + vowel sign a
* &quot;ki&quot; = /&quot;k/&quot; + vowel sign &quot;i&quot;
* &quot;ku&quot; = /&quot;k/&quot; + vowel sign &quot;u&quot;
* &quot;kai&quot; = /&quot;k/&quot; + vowel sign &quot;ai&quot;

Malayalam alphabet is unicase, or does not have a case distinction. It is written from left to right, but certain vowel signs are attached to the left (the opposite direction) of a consonant letter that it logically follows. In the word (&quot;Kēraḷam&quot;), the vowel sign (&quot;ē&quot;) visually appears in the leftmost position, though the vowel &quot;ē&quot; logically follows the consonant &quot;k&quot;.

===Malayalam letters===
====Vowels====
=====Vowel letters and vowel signs=====
The following tables show the independent vowel letters and the corresponding dependent vowel signs (diacritics) of the Malayalam script, with romanizations in ISO 15919, transcriptions in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).
&quot;r̥&quot;, &quot;r̥̄&quot;, &quot;l̥&quot;, &quot;l̥̄&quot;, used to write Sanskrit words, are treated as vowels. They are called semi-vowels and are phonetically closer to vowels in Malayalam and in Classical Sanskrit where Panini, the Sanskrit grammarian, groups them with vowel sounds in his sutras. (see &quot;Proto-Indo-European language&quot; and &quot;Vedic Sanskrit&quot;). The letters and signs for &quot;r̥̄&quot;, &quot;l̥&quot;, &quot;l̥̄&quot; are very rare, and are not considered as part of the modern orthography.

The vowel signs &quot;ā&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;ī&quot; are placed to the right of a consonant letter to which it is attached. The vowel signs &quot;e&quot;, &quot;ē&quot;, &quot;ai&quot; are placed to the left of a consonant letter. The vowel signs &quot;o&quot; and &quot;ō&quot; consist of two parts: the first part goes to the left of a consonant letter and the second part goes to the right of it. In the reformed orthography, the vowel signs &quot;u&quot;, &quot;ū&quot;, &quot;r̥&quot; are simply placed to the right of the consonant letter, while they often make consonant-vowel ligatures in the traditional orthography.

It is important to note the vowel duration as it can be used to differentiate words that would otherwise be the same. For example, means &quot;earthenware pot&quot; while means &quot;time&quot; or &quot;season&quot;.

====Anusvaram====

An &quot;anusvaram&quot; ( &quot;anusvāram&quot;), or an &quot;anusvara,&quot; originally denoted the nasalization where the preceding vowel was changed into a nasalised vowel, and hence is traditionally treated as a kind of vowel sign. In Malayalam, however, it simply represents a consonant after a vowel, though this may be assimilated to another nasal consonant. It is a special consonant letter, different from a &quot;normal&quot; consonant letter, in that it is never followed by an inherent vowel or another vowel. In general, an &quot;anusvara&quot; at the end of a word in an Indian language is transliterated as &quot;ṁ&quot; in ISO 15919, but a Malayalam &quot;anusvara&quot; at the end of a word is transliterated as &quot;m&quot; without a dot.

=====Visargam=====

A &quot;visargam&quot; (, &quot;visargam&quot;), or &quot;visarga&quot;, represents a consonant after a vowel, and is transliterated as &quot;ḥ&quot;. Like the &quot;anusvara&quot;, it is a special symbol, and is never followed by an inherent vowel or another vowel.

====Consonants====

=====Basic consonant letters=====
The following tables show the basic consonant letters of the Malayalam script, with romanizations in ISO 15919, transcriptions in IPA, and Unicode . The character names used in the report of the Government of Kerala committee (2001) are shown in &quot;lowercase italics&quot; when different from Unicode character names. Those alternative names are based on the traditional romanization used by the Malayali people. For example, &quot;tha&quot; in &quot;Thiruvanan&quot;tha&quot;puram&quot; is neither ISO tha nor Unicode , but &quot;tha&quot; in this sense (). The ISCII (IS 13194:1991) character names are given in parentheses when different from the above.


====Chillus====

A &quot;chillu&quot;, or a &quot;chillaksharam&quot; (, &quot;cillakṣaram&quot;), is a special consonant letter that represents a pure consonant independently, without help of a virama. Unlike a consonant represented by an ordinary consonant letter, this consonant is never followed by an inherent vowel. Anusvara and visarga fit this definition but are not usually included. ISCII and Unicode 5.0 treat a &quot;chillu&quot; as a glyph variant of a normal (&quot;base&quot;) consonant letter. In Unicode 5.1 and later, however, &quot;chillu&quot; letters are treated as independent characters, encoded atomically.

Six independent chillu letters (0D7A..0D7F) had been encoded in Unicode 5.1., three additional chillu letters (0D54..0D56) were encoded with the publication of Unicode 9.0.

====Chandrakkala====
The virama in Malayalam is called candrakkala (chandrakkala), it has two functions:
*As virama: used to suppress the inherent vowel
*As samvruthokaram: represent the &quot;half-u&quot; sound /ə̆/

=====As virama=====
&quot;Chandrakkala&quot; (, &quot;candrakkala&quot;) is a diacritic attached to a consonant letter to show that the consonant is not followed by an inherent vowel or any other vowel (for example, &quot;ka&quot; → &quot;k&quot;). This kind of diacritic is common in Indic scripts, generically called &quot;virama&quot; in Sanskrit, or &quot;halant&quot; in Hindi.

=====Half-u=====
At the end of a word, the same symbol sometimes represents a very short vowel, known as &quot;half-u&quot;, or &quot;samvruthokaram&quot; (, &#x27;), or &#x27; (). The exact pronunciation of this vowel varies from dialect to dialect, but it is approximately or , and transliterated as ŭ (for example, &quot;na&quot; → &quot;nŭ&quot;). Optionally, a vowel sign &quot;u&quot; is inserted, as in (= + + ). According to one author, this alternative form is historically more correct, though the simplified form without a vowel sign &quot;u&quot; is common nowadays. This means that the same spelling may represent either &quot;n&quot; or &quot;nŭ&quot; depending on the context. Generally, it is &quot;nŭ&quot; at the end of a word, and &quot;n&quot; elsewhere; always represents &quot;nŭ&quot;.

The virama of Tigalari script behave similarly to Malayalam. Virama has three functions: to suppress the inherent vowel (as the halant of Devanagari); to form conjunct consonants; to represent the half-u. Devanagari supports half-u for Kashmiri; for example is written as .
====Ligatures====

=====Consonant ligatures=====
Like in other Indic scripts, a virama is used in the Malayalam script to cancel—or &quot;kill&quot;—the inherent vowel of a consonant letter and represent a consonant without a vowel, so-called a &quot;dead&quot; consonant. For example,
# is a consonant letter &quot;na&quot;,
# is a virama; therefore,
# (&quot;na&quot; + virama) represents a dead consonant &quot;n&quot;.
If this &quot;n&quot; is further followed by another consonant letter, for example, &quot;ma&quot; , the result may look like , which represents &quot;nma&quot; as &quot;na&quot; + virama + &quot;ma&quot;. In this case, two elements &quot;n&quot; and &quot;ma&quot; are simply placed one by one, side by side. Alternatively, &quot;nma&quot; can be also written as a ligature .

Generally, when a dead consonant letter C1 and another consonant letter C2 are conjoined, the result may be either:
# A fully conjoined ligature of C1+C2;
# Half-conjoined—
#* C1-conjoining: a modified form (half form) of C1 attached to the original form (full form) of C2
#* C2-conjoining: a modified form of C2 attached to the full form of C1; or
# Non-ligated: full forms of C1 and C2 with a visible virama.

If the result is fully or half-conjoined, the (conceptual) virama which made C1 dead becomes invisible, only logically existing in a character encoding scheme such as Unicode. If the result is non-ligated, a virama is visible, attached to C1. The glyphs for &quot;nma&quot; has a visible virama if not ligated (), but if ligated, the virama disappears (). Usually the difference between those forms is superficial and both are semantically identical, just like the meaning of the English word &quot;palaeography&quot; does not change even if it is spelled &quot;palæography&quot;, with the ligature æ.

======Common consonant ligatures======
Several consonant-consonant ligatures are used commonly even in the new orthography.

The ligature &quot;mpa&quot; was historically derived from &quot;npa&quot; . The ligatures &quot;cca&quot;, &quot;bba&quot;, &quot;yya&quot;, and &quot;vva&quot; are special in that a doubled consonant is denoted by a triangle sign below a consonant letter.
======Consonant + &quot;ya&quot;, &quot;va&quot;, &quot;la&quot;, &quot;ra&quot;======
# The consonant letter &quot;ya&quot; is generally C2-conjoining after a consonant in both orthographies. For example,
* &quot;k&quot; + &quot;ya&quot; = &quot;kya&quot; 
* &quot;p&quot; + &quot;ya&quot; = &quot;pya&quot; 

In &quot;kya&quot; , a variant form of &quot;ya&quot; () is placed after the full form of &quot;ka&quot; , just like &quot;ki&quot; is written &quot;ka&quot; followed by the vowel sign &quot;i&quot; . In other words, the variant form of &quot;ya&quot; () used after a consonant letter can be considered as a diacritic. Since it is placed after the base character, it is sometimes referred to as a &quot;post-base&quot; form. An exception is &quot;yya&quot; (see above).

# Similarly, &quot;va&quot; () after a consonant takes a post-base form:
* &quot;k&quot; + &quot;va&quot; = &quot;kva&quot; 
* &quot;p&quot; + &quot;va&quot; = &quot;pva&quot; 
An exception is &quot;vva&quot; (see above).

# The consonant letter &quot;la&quot; () after a consonant traditionally takes a below-base form. These forms are used also in the new orthography, though some fonts do not support them.
* &quot;k&quot; + &quot;la&quot; = &quot;kla&quot; 
* &quot;p&quot; + &quot;la&quot; = &quot;pla&quot; 
* &quot;l&quot; + &quot;la&quot; = &quot;lla&quot; 

# A consonant letter &quot;ra&quot; (്ര) after a consonant usually takes a pre-base form in the reformed orthography, while this combination makes a fully conjoined ligature in the traditional orthography.
* &quot;k&quot; + &quot;ra&quot; = &quot;kra&quot; 
* &quot;p&quot; + &quot;ra&quot; = &quot;pra&quot; 

======&quot;nṯa&quot; and &quot;ṯṯa&quot;======
The ligature &quot;nṯa&quot; is written as &quot;n&quot; + &quot;ṟa&quot; and pronounced . The ligature &quot;ṯṯa&quot; is written as &quot;ṟ&quot; + &quot;ṟa&quot; .

In those two ligatures, a small &quot;ṟa&quot; is written below the first letter (&quot;chillu-n&quot; if it is a dead &quot;n&quot;). Alternatively, the letter &quot;ṟa&quot; is sometimes written to the right of the first letter, making a digraph (just like used instead of in Greek). The spelling is therefore read either &quot;nṟa&quot; (two separate letters) or &quot;nṯa&quot; (digraph) depending on the word like in (en̠r̠ōḷ) &#x27;enroll&#x27; or (hen̠r̠i) &#x27;Henry&#x27; but is always read &quot;nṯa&quot;. Similarly, is read either &quot;ṟaṟa&quot; or &quot;ṯṯa&quot;.

=====Dot reph=====
In the traditional orthography, a dead consonant &quot;r&quot; before a consonant sometimes takes an above-base form, known as a &quot;dot reph&quot;, which looks like a short vertical line or a dot. Generally, a &quot;chillu-r&quot; is used instead of a dot reph in the reformed orthography.

*r + ga = rga (Reformed: )
*r + ja = rja (Reformed: )

=====Consonant-vowel ligatures=====
In the pre-1971 orthography, consonant + the vowels u, ū, r̥ were written as ligatures, post-1971 they are written with symbols after the letter. They can be still seen in old signs and used by people who learned to write before 1971.

r̥̄ l̥ l̥̄ (which are not part of modern orthography) were also written as ligatures but there were not any words with l̥̄ even in Sanskrit; r̥̄ was only used grammatically instead of r̥ in Sanskrit so it was not used either; there is only one root with l̥ in Sanskrit which was loaned into Malayalam as .

=====Consonant-consonant ligatures=====
Although there are consonant-consonant ligatures used even now like and almost all clusters were written as ligatures before 1971, most of the time the second consonant was written to the bottom right of the first consonant, in consonant + r clusters the was attached to the main consonant, now its detached and placed to the left.

====Archaic signs====
 was made by A. R. Raja Raja Varma and it was not used as a single letter, in his orthography (ṯṯ) was written as and (ṉḏ) as .

=====Archaic viramas=====
Before chandrakkala was made, there were two other viramas used simultaneously, the vertical bar virama and circular virama . The vertical bar virama was used exclusively for loanwords and circular virama just for native words. Before the vertical bar virama used to cut through the main consonant and it led to the creation of the chillu letters. It was sometimes confused with the dot reph since they look similar but both of them are used for different purposes (see above for dot reph).

=====Chandrabindu=====
 was like the chandrabindu from other scripts and was used to nasalise the vowel; it was only used for writing Sanskrit and Prakrits. It is archaic.

=====Other Anusvaras=====
 was used like the Devanagari and contrasts with the normal anusvara. was not really used in Malayalam but was used in the Grantha script, in it the normal anusvara represents gemination of the next consonant and this anusvara represents an actual linguistic anusvara. Both are archaic.

=== Numeral system ===

Malayalam numeral system is archaic and no longer commonly used. Instead, the common Hindu-Arabic numeral system is followed.

Number &quot;11&quot; is written as &quot; and not &quot;. &quot;32&quot; is written as &quot;&quot; similar to the Tamil numeral system.
Suppose the number is &quot;2013&quot;. It is read in Malayalam as &quot; (raṇḍāyiratti padimūnnu). It is split into :

* (raṇḍŭ) : 2 - 
* (āyiram) : 1000 - 
* (pattŭ) : 10 - 
* (mūnnŭ) : 3 - 

Combine them together to get the Malayalam number &quot;.

==Unicode==
Malayalam script was added to the Unicode Standard in October, 1991 with the release of version 1.0.

===Block===

The Unicode block for Malayalam is U+0D00–U+0D7F:

===Chillus in Unicode===
For example, &quot;avan&quot; (&quot;he&quot;) is written as &quot;a&quot; + &quot;va&quot; + &quot;chillu-n&quot; , where &quot;chillu-n&quot; represents the &quot;n&quot; sound without a vowel. In other Indic scripts, the same word would be possibly written as &quot;a&quot; + &quot;va&quot; + &quot;na&quot; + virama. However, in Malayalam script, that sequence represents a different word, &quot;avanŭ&quot; (&quot;to him&quot;), and is not interchangeable with &quot;avan&quot;. This is because in modern Malayalam script, the sign for a virama also works as the sign for a vowel &quot;ŭ&quot; at the end of a word, and is not able to cleanly &quot;kill&quot; the inherent vowel in this case.

To differentiate a pure consonant (&quot;chillu&quot;) and a consonant with &quot;ŭ&quot;, zero-width joiner (ZWJ) and zero-width non-joiner (ZWNJ) were used before Unicode 5.1. However, this system was problematic. Among other things, glyph variants specified by ZWJ or ZWNJ are supposed to be non-semantic, whereas a &quot;chillu&quot; (expressed as letter + virama + ZWJ) and the same consonant followed by a &quot;ŭ&quot; (expressed as letter + virama + ZWNJ) are often semantically different. After a long debate, Nine &quot;chillu letters&quot; now have their own code points since Unicode 9.0 (though only 5 of them are used in modern Malayalam), though applications should also be prepared to handle data in the representation specified in Unicode 5.0. This means, fonts should display chillus in both sequences; while an input method should output standard chillus.

The ligature &quot;nṯa&quot; is very common and supported by most Malayalam fonts in one way or another, but exactly how it should be encoded was not clear in Unicode 5.0 and earlier, and two incompatible implementations are currently in use. In Unicode 5.1 (2008), the sequence to represent it was explicitly redefined as &quot;chillu-n&quot; + virama + &quot;ṟa&quot; (). ligature is often considered to be the correct form to represent n̠d̠ as can also represent n̠r̠ but in many computers it is only shown with + + even though a chandrakkala cannot be after a chillu letter, other computers show it with + + . Some computers display ( + + ) and ( + + ) differently.

<doc id="160290" wikidata="Q754054" url="?curid=160290" title="They shall not pass">
<text>&quot;They shall not pass&quot; ( and ; ; ) is a slogan, notably used by France in World War I, to express a determination to defend a position against an enemy. Its Spanish-language form was also used as an anti-fascist slogan during the Spanish Civil War by the Republican faction.

==Origin==
The widespread use of the slogan originates from the 1916 Battle of Verdun in the First World War when French Army General Robert Nivelle urged his troops not to let the enemy pass. The simplified slogan of &quot;they shall not pass&quot; appeared on French war propaganda posters, most notably by French artist Maurice Neumont in the last year of the war after the Allied victory at the Second Battle of the Marne.

Later during the First World War, the slogan was also used by Romanian Army soldiers during the Battle of Mărășești, with the Romanian translation of the phrase being &quot;&quot;, translating as &quot;One does not pass through here.&quot;

==Later use==
French socialist politician Léon Blum (SFIO), in 1934, used this sentence &quot;&quot; against the Ligue&#x27;s demonstration of 6 February. (&quot;they&quot;) designated the nationalist protesters.

It was also used during the Spanish Civil War, this time at the siege of Madrid by Dolores Ibárruri Gómez (&quot;Pasionaria&quot;), a member of the Communist Party of Spain, in her famous &quot;&quot; speech. The leader of the Nationalist forces, Generalísimo Francisco Franco, upon gaining Madrid, responded to this slogan by declaring &quot;&quot; (&quot;We have passed&quot;).

&quot;&quot; was used by British anti-fascists during the October 1936 Battle of Cable Street, and is still used in this context in some political circles. It was often accompanied by the words (we will pass) to indicate that communists rather than fascists will be the ones to seize state power.

The slogan was adopted on uniform badges by French units manning the Maginot Line.

The phrase was brought to the public consciousness again following action in December 1943 by French-Canadian officer Paul Triquet of the Royal 22e Regiment; his action included his use of Nivelle&#x27;s phrase &quot;to win a key objective at Ortona, Italy, in the face of overwhelming German opposition.&quot;

In the 1980s, the phrase was a theme in the Central American crisis, particularly in the Nicaraguan Revolution. is also the title of a 1984 documentary by David Bradbury about the events in Nicaragua that led to the overthrow of Somoza&#x27;s dictatorship.

In 2024, it has been adopted as motto by the 155th Mechanized Brigade (Ukraine) as it has been trained and equipped by France.

<text>Air Mauritius is the flag carrier airline of Mauritius. The airline is headquartered in Port Louis, Mauritius, with its hub at Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport.

==History==
===Foundation===

The company was established on 14 June 1967 by Air France, BOAC and the Government of Mauritius, with a 27.5% stake each; the balance was held by Rogers and Co, the general sales agent for Air France and BOAC in Mauritius.

In the beginning, the carrier operated international services in conjunction with Air France, Air India and British Airways, which jointly had a 25% holding in Air Mauritius at that time. Until 1972, the company restricted its activities to ground services only; it started flight operations in its own right in August 1972 with a six-seater Piper PA-31 Navajo aircraft leased from Air Madagascar, connecting Mauritius with Rodrigues. The aircraft wore an Air Mauritius decor, but kept a Malagasy registration.

In 1973, a wet-leased Vickers VC10 from British Airways enabled the company to launch a long-haul route to London via Nairobi, whereas services to Bombay were operated by Air India. The Navajo was replaced with a 16-seater Twin Otter that was acquired in 1975. When an agreement with Air France and British Airways came to an end, a Boeing 707-400 wet-leased from British Airtours helped the airline to start long-haul services in its own right. Long-range operations started on 1 November 1977. A second Twin Otter arrived in 1979.

===Services expansion===
By April 1980, the company had 414 employees and a fleet of one Boeing 707-420, one Boeing 737-200 and two Twin Otters to serve a route network of passenger and cargo services to Bombay, London, Nairobi, Réunion, Rodrigues, Rome and Tananarive. Ownership of the company had changed to have the Government of Mauritius as the major shareholder (42.5%), followed by Rogers &amp; Co. (17.5%), Air France and British Airways (15% each) and Air India (10%). Air Mauritius acquired a second-hand Boeing 707-320B in 1981. It had previously belonged to South African Airways (SAA) and permitted the airline to return the Boeing 707-400 to British Airtours.

In November 1981, a joint service between Air Mauritius and Air Madagascar began in the Tananarive–Mauritius–Comoros–Nairobi and Réunion–Mauritius runs, following the lease of an Air Madagascar Boeing 737. During the early 1980s, routes to Durban and Johannesburg were inaugurated using Boeing 707-320B aircraft flown with Air India and British Airways crews. The incorporation of a second aircraft of the type, bought from Luxavia, allowed the carrier to expand the European route network to Rome and Zürich in 1983, whereas Paris was added in the mid-1980s. Leased from SAA, a Boeing 747SP named &quot;Chateau de Réduit&quot; entered the fleet in November 1984 and was deployed on services to London.

By March 1985, the fleet comprised two Boeing 707-320Bs, a Boeing 737-200, a Boeing 747SP and a Twin Otter. That month, the first of two Bell 206 JetRangers was incorporated. In April, a 46-seater ATR 42 was ordered, and Singapore was added to the route network with a weekly service using Boeing 707 equipment. In June that year, Air Mauritius joined the African Airlines Association. The carrier made a profit of GBP3.5 million for the fiscal year 1985–86.

In 1986, a second Boeing 747SP that was also leased from SAA entered the fleet; it was named &quot;Chateau Mon Plaisir&quot;. The incorporation of this aircraft allowed the carrier to phase out a Boeing 707. In 1987, South African Airways&#x27; landing rights on Australian soil were suspended by the Australian government and Qantas ceased its operations in South Africa. There had been an increase in demand from businessmen since that time, as most passengers travelling from South Africa to Australia had to stop at Hong Kong, Taipei or Singapore. Given that landing rights in Australia for Air Mauritius had not been approved yet, a Boeing 747SP non-stop service to Hong Kong commenced on 29 October 1989, in cooperation with Cathay Pacific. Flights to Kuala Lumpur had started in May 1988.

===Fleet modernisation===
Valued at  million and financed by a group of banks that included Barclays, BNP, Crédit Lyonnais and the Spectrum Bank, the company took delivery of two Boeing 767-200ERs in April 1988. These aircraft were named &quot;City of Port Louis&quot; and &quot;City of Curepipe&quot;. One of them set a record-breaking distance for commercial twinjets on 18 April 1988, when it flew non-stop from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Mauritius, covering a distance of almost in less than 17 hours. A contract worth  million including spare parts for these two Boeing 767s had been signed a year earlier. Also in 1988, a Boeing 707 was leased from Air Swazi Cargo to operate freighter services, and the first ATR-42 started revenue flights in December, replacing the Twin Otters on inter-island services. A second ATR-42 was ordered in September 1989.

By March 1990, the route network included Antananarivo, Bombay, Durban, Geneva, Harare, Hong Kong, Johannesburg, Kuala Lumpur, London, Moroni, Munich, Nairobi, Paris, Reunion, Rodrigues, Rome, Singapore and Zürich. A new route to Perth was inaugurated in December 1991. Named &quot;Paille en Queue&quot; and leased from International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC), the first Airbus A340-300 entered the fleet in May 1994; following delivery, a Boeing 747SP that was on lease from SAA was returned. The airline became the first in the Southern Hemisphere to fly the A340-300. A second A340-300, named &quot;Pink Pigeon&quot; and purchased directly from Airbus, was handed over by the aircraft manufacturer in October. Services to Brussels and Cape Town were launched in July and November of that year. Also leased from ILFC and named &quot;Kestrel&quot;, Air Mauritius&#x27; third A340-300 joined the fleet in April 1995. The airline started trading on the Stock Exchange of Mauritius during the year. In 1996, the last Boeing 747SP was sold to Qatar Airways and direct flights to Manchester were launched.

===2000 onwards===

At April 2000, Air Mauritius had 2,000 employees. At this time, the airline had a fleet of five Airbus A340-300s, one ATR42-300, two ATR42-500s and two Boeing 767-200ERs that served a route network including Antananarivo, Brussels, Cape Town, Delhi, Durban, Frankfurt, Geneva, Harare, Hong Kong, Johannesburg, Kuala Lumpur, London, Mahe Island, Manchester, Maputo, Mauritius, Melbourne, Milan, Mumbai, Munich, Paris, Perth, Rodrigues Island, Rome, Singapore, Saint-Denis, Saint-Pierre, Vienna and Zürich.

African medium-haul routes started utilising the Airbus A319 following its delivery in 2001. The A340-300 was ordered by the carrier in mid-2005. The A340-300 Enhanced was put on service on the London Heathrow route in December 2006, soon after delivery. In late 2007, the fleet saw the incorporation of the Airbus A330-200; a second aircraft of the same type was delivered in October 2009.

In March 2016, Air Mauritius launched the &#x27;Air Corridor&#x27; with its first direct flights to Singapore, which was previously served via Kuala Lumpur. The new route aimed at improving air connectivity between Mauritius and Singapore to stimulate the growth of passenger and cargo traffic between Asia and Africa through these two hubs.

On 22 April 2020, the board of directors decided to place the company under voluntary administration after COVID-19 related disruptions made it impossible for the airline to meet its financial obligations for the foreseeable future. The pandemic had a major impact on the revenue of the company while it was seeking to change its business model to address existing financial problems. The company will continue its operation, this decision was taken to safeguard the interest of the company and its stakeholders. It exited administration mid-2021.

<text>The national flag of Poland ( ) consists of two horizontal stripes of equal width, the upper one white and the lower one red. The two colours are defined in the Polish constitution as the national colours. A variant of the flag with the national coat of arms in the middle of the white fess is legally reserved for official use abroad and at sea. A similar flag with the addition of a white eagle is used as the naval ensign of Poland.

White and red were officially adopted as national colours in 1831, although these were associated with Poland since the Middle Ages and were emphasized on royal banners. They are of heraldic origin and derive from the tinctures (colours) of the coats of arms of the two constituent nations of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (i.e., the White Eagle of Poland, and the Pursuer of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, a white knight riding a white horse), both on a red shield.

Until 1831, Polish soldiers wore cockades of various colour combinations. The national flag was officially adopted in 1919. Since 2004, Polish Flag Day has been celebrated on 2 May.

The flag is flown continuously on the buildings of the highest national authorities, such as the parliament and the presidential palace. Other institutions and many Polish people fly the national flag on national holidays and other special occasions of national significance. Current Polish law does not restrict the use of the national flag without the coat of arms, as long as the flag is not disrespected.

Horizontal bicolours of white and red being a relatively widespread design, several flags are similar but unrelated to the Polish one. Two national flags (Indonesia and Monaco) have the red stripe above the white one. In Poland, many flags based on the national design also feature the national colours.

It is one of five flags that use the 5:8 ratio. The other four flags include those of Argentina, Guatemala, Palau, and Sweden.

== Design ==
=== Legal sources ===
The colours and flags of the Republic of Poland are described in two legal documents: the Constitution of the Republic of Poland of 1997 and the Coat of Arms, Colours and Anthem of the Republic of Poland and State Seals Act () of 1980 with subsequent amendments (henceforth referred to as &quot;the Coat of Arms Act&quot;).

Legislation concerning the national symbols is far from perfect. The Coat of Arms Act has been amended several times and refers extensively to executive ordinances, some of which have never been issued. Moreover, the Act contains errors, omissions and inconsistencies which make the law confusing, open to various interpretations and often not followed in practice.

=== National colours ===
According to Chapter I, Article 28, paragraph 2 of the Constitution, the national colours of Poland are white and red. The Coat of Arms Act, Article 4, further specifies that the colours are white and red in two horizontal, parallel stripes of equal width, of which the top one is white and the bottom one is red. If the colours are displayed vertically, the white stripe is placed on the left from the onlooker&#x27;s viewpoint. Attachment no. 2 to the Act shows the national colours in both horizontal and vertical alignment, as well as the official shades of both colours expressed as coordinates in the CIE xyY (CIE 1931) colour space with the tolerated colour differences (ΔE) specified in the CIE 1976 (&quot;L&quot;*, &quot;u&quot;*, &quot;v&quot;*) colour space (CIELUV).

=== Variants of the national flag ===
The Constitution contains no mention of a national flag. Instead, the flag is defined by the Coat of Arms Act which specifies two variants of the national flag: the national flag of the Republic of Poland () and the national flag with coat of arms of the Republic of Poland (&quot;&quot;). Both flags are defined in Article 6 of the act as follows:

The hoist to fly ratio for both flags is 5:8. For the latter flag, the proportion between the inescutcheon of the coat of arms and the hoist is 2:5. Images of both variations of the flag can be found in attachment no. 3 to the Coat of Arms Act.

== Usage ==

=== Right and obligation to fly the flag ===
Per Polish law, treating the national symbols, including the flag, &quot;with reverence and respect&quot; is the &quot;right and obligation&quot; of every Polish citizen and all state organs, institutions and organisations. Public disrespect, destruction or intentional removal of the flag is considered a crime punishable by a fine, penal servitude or up to one year of imprisonment. Official statistics show that crimes against national symbols are rare: 43 such crimes in 2003 and 96 in 2004 were less than 0.001% of all crimes registered in Poland in those years. Other, unspecified violation of regulations on the Polish flag is an infraction, punishable by a fine or up to one month imprisonment.

According to the Coat of Arms Act, everyone can use the Polish flag, especially during national and cultural events, as long as it is done in a respectful manner. This liberty in the use of national colours is a relative novelty. Until 2004, Polish citizens were only allowed to fly the Polish flag on national holidays. The use of both variants was restricted, but only flying the flag with coat of arms was, from 1955 to 1985, punishable by a fine or arrest for up to one year. After 1985, unauthorised use of any national symbol was an infraction. A possible explanation to such harsh measures was the fact that the officially promoted holiday of 1 May was separated by only one day from the pre-war (and current) national holiday of Poland, the anniversary of signing of the Constitution of 3 May 1791. While hoisting a flag on 1 May was acceptable, no later than the following day it had to be taken down.
That restriction and kind of state monopoly on the use of national symbols during the Communist regime made flying the Polish flag a symbol of resistance against the government. It became customary, as it still is, for workers to hoist Polish flags on plant buildings when going on strike. That is why the Polish flag, as a symbol of patriotism and resistance against the Communist rule, is part of the Solidarity trade union logo.

==== Flag without coat of arms ====

The following institutions are required by law to fly the national flag without coat of arms either on top or in front of their official buildings:
* the Sejm (lower house of parliament);
* the Senat (upper house of parliament);
* the President of the Republic;
* the Council of Ministers (cabinet) and the President of the Council of Ministers (Prime Minister);
* Voivodeship sejmiks (provincial legislatures);
* other state and local government organs.
Additionally, the national flag without coat of arms is used as an ensign for inland navigation.

==== Flag with coat of arms ====

While the ban on using the flag without coat of arms has been lifted, the use of the national flag with coat of arms is still legally restricted and should be flown only:
* on or in front of Polish embassies, consulates and other representative offices and missions abroad, as well as by Polish ambassadors and consuls on their residences and vehicles;
* at civilian airports and heliports (civil air ensign);
* on civilian airplanes – only during international flights;
* on buildings of seaport authorities;
* as a merchant (civil) ensign.
In practice, however, the restriction is often ignored and the two flags, with and without the coat of arms, are treated as interchangeable. The variant with the coat of arms, even though its incorrect usage, is often used by the Polonia, or Polish diaspora outside Poland, especially in the United States.

=== Flag flying days ===

State and local government organs are legally required, and other institutions and organisations as well as all citizens are encouraged to fly the Polish flag on the following days:
* 1 May – State Holiday (May Day, formerly Labor Day);
* 2 May – Polish National Flag Day;
* 3 May – Constitution Day (along with Polish National Flag Day);
* 11 November – Independence Day.

=== Common flag practice ===
The flag is often popularly flown during important sporting events, such as the FIFA World Cup, if Polish athletes are participating; and during an official visit of a particularly important person, especially a pope, in Poland. During a pope&#x27;s visit, the national flag is usually flown together with yellow and white Church flags, and white and blue Marian flags. It is uncommon to fly the national flag on personal occasions, such as birthdays or weddings.

According to polls, about one out of three Poles say they own a Polish flag, and about one out of four fly it on national holidays. Such public display of patriotism is much more common in western Poland, especially in Greater Poland, than in other parts of the country.

== Flag protocol ==
Flags in Poland are used according to a customary, rather than legal, flag protocol. Apart from the obligation to treat the flag with due respect, Polish law does not offer a detailed code of correct usage of the Polish flag. Some organisations and public institutions, such as the Heraldic and Vexillological Institute and the Supreme Chamber of Control have proposed written flag protocols for the Polish flag, based on custom, flag protocols of other countries such as India and the United States, and common sense. These guidelines, however, are not legally binding.

Traditionally, the national flag is reserved to serve either informative or festive purposes. A single specimen of the flag on or in front of a public office building indicates its official role. Multiple flags, on the other hand, are normally used to decorate both public and private buildings to mark special occasions, such as national holidays.

In Polish heraldry, the tincture of the charge has priority in relation to the tincture of the field. In the case of Polish national colours, white, the colour of the White Eagle, should always be placed in a more honorable position than red, the colour of the field of the Polish coat of arms. In the most usual, horizontal alignment, this means that the white stripe is placed above the red one. If the alignment is vertical, the white stripe should be on the left from the onlooker&#x27;s point of view. If the flag is hung vertically above a street, the white stripe should be placed on the left when looking in the direction of increasing house numbers. If it drapes a coffin, the white stripe should be placed over the heart.

The flag should be raised before 8 a.m. and lowered at sunset, and if flown at night, it should be illuminated. During a ceremonial raising of the flag, the national anthem is played so that the timing of the raising matches the duration of the anthem. Civilians pay respect by standing in a dignified manner; additionally, men uncover their heads. Members of uniformed services stand at attention; if their uniform includes headgear and they are not standing in an organised group, they also perform the two-finger salute. Colour guards dip their banners to the flag. (See video)
According to generally accepted standards of respect, the national flag should never be dipped to any person or thing. Care should be taken to prevent the flag from touching the ground, floor or water beneath it. It should be also secured from being torn off or falling to the ground and it should not be flown outdoors during a heavy rain, blizzard or very strong wind. The flag should never be flown dirty, torn or faded. When no longer in a fit condition to be used, it should be disposed of in a dignified manner, preferably by cutting it in half so as to separate the colours and then, burning.

When displayed with other flags, the Polish flag should be raised first and lowered last. Each flag must be flown from a separate pole of the same height, but the flag of Poland should be always placed in the most honorable position. It means that if the total number of flags is even, the Polish flag should be placed to its right of the other flags. If the total number of flags is odd, it should be placed in the middle. Alternatively, two Polish flags may be placed, one at each end of the row of flags. The order of precedence for flags is as follows:
* flag of Poland,
* national flags of other countries (in alphabetical order),
* voivodeship flags,
* county flags,
* commune flags,
* European flag,
* flags of domestic organisations,
* flags of international organisations,
* public services flags,
* corporate flags,
* other flags.

The President of the Republic may announce a period of national mourning. During that time Polish flags are flown at half-staff. If a flag is flown from a wooden pole rather than a staff or mast, a black ribbon is attached to the pole as a sign of mourning or a black flag is flown to its left from the national flag.

== History ==

=== Royal banner ===
The earliest vexilloids (flag-like objects) used in Poland were known as &quot;stanice&quot; and probably resembled the Roman &quot;vexillum&quot;, that is a cloth draped vertically from a horizontal crosspiece attached to a wooden pole or spear. They served as both religious and military symbols as early as 10th century. With Poland&#x27;s conversion to Christianity in 966, the &quot;stanice&quot; were probably Christianized by replacing pagan symbols with Christian ones. The royal banner of arms dates back to the reign of King Boleslaus the Generous (r. 1076–1079), but it was during the reign of King Ladislaus the Short (r. 1320–1333) that a red cloth emblazoned with the White Eagle of the arms of Poland was finally established as the Banner of the Kingdom of Poland, a symbol of royal authority used at coronations and in battles.

In the times of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1795), a banner of the Commonwealth was also used, combining the heraldic symbols of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Commonwealth banner was initially plain white emblazoned with the arms of the Commonwealth which consisted of the heraldic charges of Poland (White Eagle) and Lithuania (Pursuer). Since both Polish and Lithuanian coats of arms consisted of white (&quot;Argent&quot;) charges in a red (&quot;Gules&quot;) field, these two colours started to be used for the entire banner. During the 17th century, the banner was usually divided into two, three or four horizontal, often swallow-tailed, stripes of red and white.

=== National cockade ===

In the 18th and 19th centuries, European nations used cockades, or knots of coloured ribbons pinned to the hat, to denote the nationality of their military. In Poland, until 1831, there was no consensus as to what the colours of the national cockade should be. Polish soldiers wore white, white-and-red, blue-and-red or blue-white-red cockades.

The custom came to Poland from Saxony during the reign of Augustus II (r. 1697–1733), King of Poland and Elector of Saxony. During that time, the cockade worn by the Polish military had, like in Saxony, the form of a white silk ribbon with a knot in the middle. It was later replaced with a circular white cockade wrinkled toward the center, patterned after the cockade of the Kingdom of France. During the reign of King Stanislaus Augustus (r. 1764–1795), a white-and-red cockade came into use alongside the plain white one. In 1791, the Military Commission introduced a metal cross pattée as a more durable alternative to the cockade. However, many soldiers continued to either pin the cross to the cockade or wear the cockade without the cross. Polish military leaders and national heroes of the time, such as General Tadeusz Kościuszko and Prince Józef Poniatowski pinned plain white &quot;national&quot; cockades to their hats.

The patriotic and staunchly Catholic members of the Bar Confederation of 1768–1772 adopted crimson – the symbol of Polish &quot;szlachta&quot;, or nobility – and blue – symbolizing Virgin Mary – as their colours. These, as well as white-and-red, were considered national colours during the Great Sejm of 1788–1792. White and red were first publicly used as national colours by civilians on 3 May 1792 in Warsaw, during a celebration of the first anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution of 1791. Meanwhile, the political left wore the blue-white-red cockades of the French Revolution. Polish Legions created in 1797 in French-controlled republics in Italy, used either national cockades of the particular Italian republics in which they served or the French tricolour cockade. In the latter case, the red and blue colours were replaced with crimson and navy blue respectively, hues considered to be traditionally Polish. The General Confederation of the Kingdom of Poland, which sought to revive the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth during the French invasion of Russia in 1812, adopted red-and-blue cockades, symbolizing the unity of Poland (red) and Lithuania (blue). The military of the French-controlled Duchy of Warsaw (1807–1815) and the Russian-controlled Congress Kingdom of Poland (1815–1831) used the white cockade, which was also worn by the cadets who started the November Uprising against Russian rule on 29 November 1830.

During the uprising, the Sejm realized the need for unified national insignia that could be used by the Polish military. On 7 February 1831 it adopted white and red, the tinctures (colours) of the Polish and Lithuanian coats of arms, as the national cockade of Poland. The white-and-red cockade was henceforth worn by Polish soldiers in the November Uprising, as well as by participants of the Kraków Uprising of 1846, Polish freedom fighters in the Grand Duchy of Posen and the Austrian Empire during the Spring of Nations of 1848, and Polish insurgents during the January Uprising of 1863–1864. White and red colours were also used by civilians to show their protest against the Russian rule, as well as by people in France, Britain, Germany, Belgium and other countries as a sign of their sympathy with the Polish cause. The Sejm&#x27;s decision was not, however, immediately accepted by all. Left-wing politicians of the time, such as Joachim Lelewel, continued to regard the revolutionary blue, white and red as true national colours. Tricolour standards were used by some Polish guerrilla units during the January Uprising.

=== Twentieth century ===

White-and-red flags were first waved during a patriotic demonstration on 3 May 1916 in Warsaw. The organizing committee advised participants about the correct alignment of the colours, that is with the white stripe above the red one. Still, many demonstrators brought flags with the red stripe on top. On 1 August 1919, almost a year after Poland regained independence in November 1918, the Sejm officially introduced a white-and-red bicolour as the Polish national flag. In order to avoid confusion with the white-and-red maritime signal flag used internationally by harbor pilots and tugboats, the same act of Sejm introduced a variant of the flag with the coat of arms in the white stripe for use as a civil ensign and by Polish diplomats and consuls abroad.
Apart from changes in the legal specifications of the shades of the national colours (see the section below), the basic design of the Polish flag, including the 5:8 ratio, has remained unchanged to this day. The flag with coat of arms was only modified to adjust to the changes in the coat of arms itself. Major modifications included a change in the stylisation of the eagle from Classicist to Baroque in 1927 and the removal of the crown from the eagle&#x27;s head during the Communist rule from 1944 to 1990. In that period, Poland was one of the few socialist states in the Eastern Bloc (apart from the flag of Cuba and Laos) not to adorn communist symbolism on its flag.


20th-century Polish insurgents wore white-and-red brassards (armbands) which played a role similar to the cockade of previous centuries. Such armbands were worn by Polish freedom fighters during the Greater Poland Uprising (1918–1919) and Silesian Uprisings (1919–1921), as well as during the Second World War (1939–1945) by the soldiers of the Home Army (AK) and Peasants&#x27; Battalions (BCh) – usually emblazoned with the acronyms of their formations. During the Second World War, Polish soldiers raised the Polish flag on several sites of their victories. On 18 May 1944, after an Allied victory over the German forces in the Battle of Monte Cassino, a patrol of the 12th Podolian Uhlan Regiment (part of the Polish 3rd Carpathian Rifle Division) raised a Polish flag on ruins of the Monte Cassino abbey in Italy. On 1 August 1944, the first day of the Warsaw Uprising, a white-and-red flag was hoisted on the Prudential building, Warsaw&#x27;s tallest skyscraper of the time. During the liberation of Warsaw by Soviet forces and Polish People&#x27;s Army on 17 January 1945, Polish flags were raised on the Belvedere palace and ruins of the Main Railway Station. On 2 May 1945, after the capture of Berlin, soldiers of the 7th Battery, 3rd Division, 1st Light Artillery Regiment planted Polish flags on the Berlin Victory Column.

Polish flags were also used by anti-government demonstrators under the Communist rule. During the bloody riots of 1956 in Poznań and 1970 in Gdynia, protesters carried flags that were blood-stained on the white stripe.

=== Shades of red ===


Until 1927, the exact shades of the national colours were not legally specified. In practice, the actual hue, particularly of red, depended on what kind of red dye was available. In pre-partition Poland, crimson, due to its high price, was a colour associated with the rich and the privileged. It could be obtained from the domestically harvested Polish cochineal, although imported alternatives were also available: kermes from the Mediterranean Basin (hence &quot;karmazyn&quot;, the Polish name of the colour) and Mexican cochineal after the discovery of the New World. Crimson was reserved for the nobility and considered a symbol of the aristocracy, so that &quot;karmazyn&quot; became synonymous with a magnate. A royal ban on wearing this colour could be a form of punishment; in the 14th century, the Nałęcz clan of Greater Poland were forbidden to dress in crimson for their ancestors&#x27; complicity in the assassination of King Premislaus in 1296. In the first half of the 19th century, due to the influence of French fashion, crimson was largely replaced with the cheaper amaranth.

The National Cockade Act of 1831 did not specify the shade of red, for which it was criticised by Joachim Lelewel, nor did the Coat of Arms and National Colours Act of 1919. In 1921, the Ministry of Military Affairs issued a pamphlet with illustrations of the Polish flag and other national symbols which used the crimson shade of red.
The pamphlet was not, however, an official source of law and was published for informative purpose only. The shade of red was first legally specified by a presidential decree of 13 December 1927 which stipulated that the official shade was vermilion. This specification was upheld by a decree of 7 December 1955. The Coat of Arms Act of 31 January 1980 replaced the verbal prescription with trichromatic coordinates in the CIE colour space as proposed by Nikodem Sobczak, an expert in colorimetry,
bringing the resulting hue closer to crimson again.

== Related and similar flags ==


The flag of the Grand Duchy of Posen, a Polish-populated autonomous province of the Kingdom of Prussia created in 1815, was a red-and-white horizontal bicolour. Its colours were taken from the duchy&#x27;s coat of arms which consisted of the Prussian Black Eagle with an inescutcheon of the Polish White Eagle. With Germany&#x27;s increasingly anti-Polish policy and a rising identification of white and red as Polish national colours, the red-and-white flag of Posen was replaced in 1886 with a white-black-white horizontal triband.

Today, many flags used in Poland are based on the design of the national flag. This applies especially to flags defined by Polish law and used by the Polish military and other uniformed services, such as the naval ensign – a swallow-tailed horizontal bicolour of white and red defaced with the arms of Poland in the white stripe. Flags of some administrative subdivisions also resemble the national flag. Examples include the former flag of the Lower Silesian Voivodeship – a horizontal bicolour of white and red defaced with the arms of the voivodeship – or the flag of the Lesser Poland Voivodeship – a horizontal tricolour of white, yellow and red with the yellow stripe half as wide as any of the other two.

<text>Roberto Sánchez Vilella (19 February 1913 – 24 March 1997) was the governor of Puerto Rico from 1965 to 1969. Sánchez Vilella successfully ran for governor in the 1964 elections for the &quot;Partido Popular Democrático&quot;. He is also the founder of the People&#x27;s Party (Puerto Rico), &quot;Partido del Pueblo&quot;, also known as el Partido del Sol.

==Early years and education==
Sánchez Vilella was born in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico, to Luis Sánchez Frasqueri and Angela Vilella Vélez and his family moved to Ponce, Puerto Rico when he was five years old. In Ponce he attended elementary and secondary schools, including the Ponce High School. After graduation, he attended Ohio State University where he graduated with a bachelor degree in civil engineering in 1934. As an engineer, in 1941 he was president of the Ponce chapter of the &quot;Colegio de Ingenieros y Agrimensores de Puerto Rico&quot;, the professional organization covering all engineers and land surveyors in Puerto Rico. He then was a professor for a short time at the University of Puerto Rico.

==Governor==

After a long and distinguished career as city manager of the city of San Juan, Secretary of Public Works and as the first Secretary of State, Sánchez Vilella was handpicked by Governor Luis Muñoz Marín to run as the PPD&#x27;s candidate for governor in 1964. Sánchez won the election by a comfortable margin, becoming the second democratically elected governor of the island.

During his tenure, Sánchez Vilella tried to change his party&#x27;s membership, urging a younger generation to rise in the friends party&#x27;s organization. It could be argued that Sánchez Vilella was influenced by the youth movement that the island was experiencing countrywide during the 1960s, a period where many social areas in Puerto Rico, including television, music and sports, were being introduced to fresh, younger personalities.

Sánchez Vilella had public marital problems during his term. In March 1967, his affair with his 35-year-old, twice-divorced former legislative aide, Jeannette Ramos Buonono, became public. Sánchez Vilella and his wife of 31 years, then First Lady Conchita Dapena, separated shortly afterwards when Governor Sánchez Vilella announced his intention to seek a divorce in order to marry Ramos. In October 1967, Governor Sánchez Vilella and Jeannette Ramos married in a civil ceremony held in Humacao, Puerto Rico, just two days after his divorce from Dapena was finalized. This was the governor&#x27;s second marriage and Ramos&#x27; third marriage. His marital problems were brought to center stage during the 1968 gubernatorial campaign, given the still-conservative Puerto Rican moral values of the time, including the stigmatization of divorce. The affair effectively ended Sánchez Vilella&#x27;s political career and he announced at the time that he would not seek re-election.

His goals of revitalization and change led to a public break with former governor, Luis Muñoz Marín, who was still party leader. Because of this, the PPD nominated Luis Negrón López for governor in the elections of 1968. Sánchez Vilella left the PPD and founded his own party, the &quot;Partido del Pueblo&quot; (&quot;The People&#x27;s Party&quot;). While his new party lost in the 1968 elections, it caused a considerable percentage of PPD voters to vote for him, indirectly helping Luis A. Ferré and his New Progressive Party to win that year. It did not matter that Ferré had made a similar split with his &quot;Partido Estadista Republicano&quot; (Statehood Republican Party) due to that party&#x27;s decision not to support the statehood status option in the 1967 Puerto Rican status plebiscite (Ferré created the New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico as a consequence). There is even speculation that United States Navy officials, scorned by Sánchez Vilella as long-time meddlers in Puerto Rican affairs (in a by-now famous episode, Sánchez Vilella had thrashed a hotline telephone that linked the governor&#x27;s office and the local Navy command) used Navy intelligence resources to prepare a smear campaign against Sánchez Vilella and helped Ferré with logistics and money for his own gubernatorial campaign. Nevertheless, Sánchez Vilella was finally blamed for the first loss in the history of the PPD. His relationship with former governor Muñoz Marín was severely strained, but the two friends mended their differences in the late 1970s.

In 1972, Sánchez Vilella made his third and last run for elective office when he obtained 59,000 votes in his bid to become a representative-at-large, but lost when the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico certified the election of Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP) candidate Luis Ángel Torres, who polled fewer than 150 votes, based on its interpretation of the Puerto Rico Constitution&#x27;s rules regarding the election of at-large legislative candidates.

==Retirement and legacy==
After leaving La Fortaleza and his unsuccessful House bid in 1972, Sánchez Vilella lived a relatively quiet life, serving as a professor at the University of Puerto Rico&#x27;s School of Public Administration and its law school, and as a radio commentator. The Puerto Rican sculptor Tomás Batista created a bust in his honor, and it is located in the city of Ponce, at the Parque del Tricentenario.

He died on 24 March 1997 and was buried at the Panteón Nacional Román Baldorioty de Castro in Ponce, Puerto Rico which he had claimed as his adoptive city.

The legacy of Sánchez Vilella, who was initially judged rather harshly by historians, has been perceived in a better light recently. His term was overshadowed by the legacy of Muñoz, his predecessor, and the PDP&#x27;s loss in the 1968 elections is still blamed on him. However, he is perceived by many political commentators to have led the most efficient public administration of all Puerto Rican-born governors, and many long for Sánchez Vilella&#x27;s frankness and political integrity in light of the deteriorating political climate that has developed after he left office. As the perception of his legacy improves, he is now being honored more frequently. The Government&#x27;s largest building complex at Minillas, in Santurce, was named after him, and a bust of Sánchez Vilella was placed in the Governor&#x27;s Hall of the Puerto Rico capitol building in 2007.

Sánchez Vilella had two daughters, Evelyn and Vilma, from his marriage to First Lady Concepción &quot;Conchita&quot; Dapena. He also had two children, Olga Elizabeth and Roberto José, from his marriage to Jeannette Ramos.

==Honors==

In 1997, Governor Pedro Rosselló signed into law a bill introduced by then senator Kenneth McClintock converting a major highway built by Sánchez Vilella between Ponce and Mayagüez into the &quot;Roberto Sánchez Vilella Expressway&quot;, honoring not only his service as Governor but as Secretary of Public Works.

A new Puerto Rican highway, PR-66, named in honor of Roberto Sánchez Vilella was inaugurated on 31 March 2006.

The University of Puerto Rico&#x27;s School of Public Administration, where he served as a professor, bears his name.

<text>In historical contexts, New Imperialism characterizes a period of colonial expansion by European powers, the United States, and Japan during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The period featured an unprecedented pursuit of overseas territorial acquisitions. At the time, states focused on building their empires with new technological advances and developments, expanding their territory through conquest, and exploiting the resources of the subjugated countries. During the era of New Imperialism, the European powers (and Japan) individually conquered almost all of Africa and parts of Asia. The new wave of imperialism reflected ongoing rivalries among the great powers, the economic desire for new resources and markets, and a &quot;civilizing mission&quot; ethos. Many of the colonies established during this era gained independence during the era of decolonization that followed World War II.

The qualifier &quot;new&quot; is used to differentiate modern imperialism from earlier imperial activity, such as the formation of ancient empires and the first wave of European colonization.

==Rise==
The American Revolutionary War (1775–1783) and the collapse of the Spanish Empire in Latin America in the 1820s ended the first era of European imperialism. Especially in Great Britain these revolutions helped show the deficiencies of mercantilism, the doctrine of economic competition for finite wealth which had supported earlier imperial expansion. In 1846, the Corn Laws were repealed and manufacturers grew, as the regulations enforced by the Corn Laws had slowed their businesses. With the repeal in place, the manufacturers were able to trade more freely. Thus, Britain began to adopt the concept of free trade.
During this period, between the 1815 Congress of Vienna after the defeat of Napoleonic France and Imperial Germany&#x27;s victory in the Franco-Prussian War in 1871, Great Britain reaped the benefits of being Europe&#x27;s dominant military and economic power. As the &quot;workshop of the world&quot;, Britain could produce finished goods so efficiently that they could usually undersell comparable, locally manufactured goods in foreign markets, supplying a large share of the manufactured goods consumed by such nations as the German states, France, Belgium, and the United States. 

The erosion of British hegemony after the Franco-Prussian War, in which a coalition of German states led by Prussia soundly defeated the Second French Empire, was occasioned by changes in the European and world economies and in the continental balance of power following the breakdown of the Concert of Europe, established by the Congress of Vienna. The establishment of nation-states in Germany and Italy resolved territorial issues that had kept potential rivals embroiled in internal affairs at the heart of Europe to Britain&#x27;s advantage. The years from 1871 to 1914 would be marked by an extremely unstable peace. France&#x27;s determination to recover Alsace-Lorraine, annexed by Germany as a result of the Franco-Prussian War, and Germany&#x27;s mounting imperialist ambitions would keep the two nations constantly poised for conflict.

This competition was sharpened by the Long Depression of 1873–1896, a prolonged period of price deflation punctuated by severe business downturns, which put pressure on governments to promote home industry, leading to the widespread abandonment of free trade among Europe&#x27;s powers (in Germany from 1879 and in France from 1881).

===Berlin Conference===
The Berlin Conference of 1884–1885 sought to destroy the competition between the powers by defining &quot;effective occupation&quot; as the criterion for international recognition of a territory claim, specifically in Africa. The imposition of direct rule in terms of &quot;effective occupation&quot; necessitated routine recourse to armed force against indigenous states and peoples. Uprisings against imperial rule were put down ruthlessly, most brutally in the Herero Wars in German South-West Africa from 1904 to 1907 and the Maji Maji Rebellion in German East Africa from 1905 to 1907. One of the goals of the conference was to reach agreements over trade, navigation, and boundaries of Central Africa. However, of all of the 15 nations in attendance of the Berlin Conference, none of the countries represented were African.

The main dominating powers of the conference were France, Germany, Britain, and Portugal. They remapped Africa without considering the cultural and linguistic borders that were already established. At the end of the conference, Africa was divided into 50 different colonies. The attendants established who was in control of each of these newly divided colonies. They also planned, noncommittally, to end the slave trade in Africa.

===Britain during the era===

In Britain, the age of new imperialism marked a time for significant economic changes. Because the country was the first to industrialize, Britain was technologically ahead of many other countries throughout the majority of the nineteenth century. By the end of the nineteenth century, however, other countries, chiefly Germany and the United States, began to challenge Britain&#x27;s technological and economic power. After several decades of monopoly, the country was battling to maintain a dominant economic position while other powers became more involved in international markets. In 1870, Britain contained 31.8% of the world&#x27;s manufacturing capacity while the United States contained 23.3% and Germany contained 13.2%. By 1910, Britain&#x27;s manufacturing capacity had dropped to 14.7%, while that of the United States had risen to 35.3% and that of Germany to 15.9%. As countries like Germany and America became more economically successful, they began to become more involved with imperialism, resulting in the British struggling to maintain the volume of British trade and investment overseas.

Britain further faced strained international relations with three expansionist powers (Japan, Germany, and Italy) during the early twentieth century. Before 1939, these three powers never directly threatened Britain itself, but the dangers to the Empire were clear. By the 1930s, Britain was worried that Japan would threaten its holdings in the Far East as well as territories in India, Australia and New Zealand. Italy held an interest in North Africa, which threatened British Egypt, and German dominance of the European continent held some danger for Britain&#x27;s security. Britain worried that the expansionist powers would cause the breakdown of international stability; as such, British foreign policy attempted to protect the stability in a rapidly changing world. With its stability and holdings threatened, Britain decided to adopt a policy of concession rather than resistance, a policy that became known as appeasement.

In Britain, the era of new imperialism affected public attitudes toward the idea of imperialism itself. Most of the public believed that if imperialism was going to exist, it was best if Britain was the driving force behind it. The same people further thought that British imperialism was a force for good in the world. In 1940, the Fabian Colonial Research Bureau argued that Africa could be developed both economically and socially, but until this development could happen, Africa was best off remaining with the British Empire. Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s 1891 poem, &quot;The English Flag,&quot; contains the stanza:
&lt;poem&gt;
 Winds of the World, give answer! They are whimpering to and fro--
 And what should they know of England who only England know?--
 The poor little street-bred people that vapour and fume and brag,
 They are lifting their heads in the stillness to yelp at the English Flag!&lt;/poem&gt;

These lines show Kipling&#x27;s belief that the British who actively took part in imperialism knew more about British national identity than the ones whose entire lives were spent solely in the imperial metropolis. While there were pockets of anti-imperialist opposition in Britain in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, resistance to imperialism was nearly nonexistent in the country as a whole. In many ways, this new form of imperialism formed a part of the British identity until the end of the era of new imperialism with the Second World War.

==Socioeconomic implications==
While Social Darwinism became popular throughout Western Europe and the United States, the paternalistic French and Portuguese &quot;civilizing mission&quot; (in French: &#x27;; in Portuguese: &#x27;) appealed to many European statesmen both in and outside France. Despite apparent benevolence existing in the notion of the &quot;White Man&#x27;s Burden&quot;, the unintended consequences of imperialism might have greatly outweighed the potential benefits. Governments became increasingly paternalistic at home and neglected the individual liberties of their citizens. Military spending expanded, usually leading to an &quot;imperial overreach&quot;, and imperialism created clients of ruling elites abroad that were brutal and corrupt, consolidating power through imperial rents and impeding social change and economic development that ran against their ambitions. Furthermore, &quot;nation building&quot; oftentimes created cultural sentiments of racism and xenophobia.

Many of Europe&#x27;s major elites also found advantages in formal, overseas expansion: large financial and industrial monopolies wanted imperial support to protect their overseas investments against competition and domestic political tensions abroad, bureaucrats sought government offices, military officers desired promotion, and the traditional but waning landed gentries sought increased profits for their investments, formal titles, and high office. Such special interests have perpetuated empire-building throughout history.

The enforcement of mercantilist policies played a role in sustaining New Imperialism. This restricted colonies to trade only with respective metropoles, which strengthened home-country economies. At first through growing chartered companies and later through imperial states themselves, New Imperialism shifted towards the use of free trade, the reduction of market restrictions and tariffs, and the coercion of foreign markets to open up, often through gunboat diplomacy or concerted interventionism, such as police actions.

Observing the rise of trade unionism, socialism, and other protest movements during an era of mass society both in Europe and later in North America, elites sought to use imperial jingoism to co-opt the support of part of the industrial working class. The new mass media promoted jingoism in the Spanish–American War (1898), the Second Boer War (1899–1902), and the Boxer Rebellion (1900). The left-wing German historian Hans-Ulrich Wehler has defined social imperialism as &quot;the diversions outwards of internal tensions and forces of change in order to preserve the social and political status quo&quot;, and as a &quot;defensive ideology&quot; to counter the &quot;disruptive effects of industrialization on the social and economic structure of Germany&quot;. In Wehler&#x27;s opinion, social imperialism was a device that allowed the German government to distract public attention from domestic problems and preserve the existing social and political order. The dominant elites used social imperialism as the glue to hold together a fractured society and to maintain popular support for the social &quot;status quo&quot;. According to Wehler, German colonial policy in the 1880s was the first example of social imperialism in action, and was followed up by the 1897 Tirpitz Plan for expanding the German Navy. In this point of view, groups such as the Colonial Society and the Navy League are seen as instruments for the government to mobilize public support. The demands for annexing most of Europe and Africa in World War I are seen by Wehler as the pinnacle of social imperialism.

===India===
In the 17th century, the British businessmen arrived in India and, after taking a small portion of land, formed the East India Company. The British East India Company annexed most of the subcontinent of India, starting with Bengal in 1757 and ending with Punjab in 1849. Many princely states remained independent. This was aided by a power vacuum formed by the collapse of the Mughal Empire in India and the death of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb and increased British forces in India because of colonial conflicts with France. The invention of clipper ships in the early 1800s cut the trip to India from Europe in half from 6 months to 3 months; the British also laid cables on the floor of the ocean allowing telegrams to be sent from India and China. In 1818, the British controlled most of the Indian subcontinent and began imposing their ideas and ways on its residents, including different succession laws that allowed the British to take over a state with no successor and gain its land and armies, new taxes, and monopolistic control of industry. The British also collaborated with Indian officials to increase their influence in the region.

Some Hindu and Muslim sepoys rebelled in 1857, resulting in the Indian Rebellion. After this revolt was suppressed by the British, India came under the direct control of the British crown. After the British had gained more control over India, they began changing around the financial state of India. Previously, Europe had to pay for Indian textiles and spices in bullion; with political control, Britain directed farmers to grow cash crops for the company for exports to Europe while India became a market for textiles from Britain. In addition, the British collected huge revenues from land rent and taxes on its acquired monopoly on salt production. Indian weavers were replaced by new spinning and weaving machines and Indian food crops were replaced by cash crops like cotton and tea.

The British also began connecting Indian cities by railroad and telegraph to make travel and communication easier as well as building an irrigation system for increasing agricultural production. When Western education was introduced in India, Indians were quite influenced by it, but the inequalities between the British ideals of governance and their treatment of Indians became clear. In response to this discriminatory treatment, a group of educated Indians established the Indian National Congress, demanding equal treatment and self-governance.

John Robert Seeley, a Cambridge Professor of History, said, &quot;Our acquisition of India was made blindly. Nothing great that has ever been done by Englishmen was done so unintentionally or accidentally as the conquest of India&quot;. According to him, the political control of India was not a conquest in the usual sense because it was not an act of a state.

The new administrative arrangement, crowned with Queen Victoria&#x27;s proclamation as Empress of India in 1876, effectively replaced the rule of a monopolistic enterprise with that of a trained civil service headed by graduates of Britain&#x27;s top universities. The administration retained and increased the monopolies held by the company. The India Salt Act of 1882 included regulations enforcing a government monopoly on the collection and manufacture of salt; in 1923 a bill was passed doubling the salt tax.

==Southeast Asia==
After taking control of much of India, the British expanded further into Burma, Malaya, Singapore and Borneo, with these colonies becoming further sources of trade and raw materials for British goods. France annexed all of Vietnam and Cambodia in the 1880s; in the following decade, France completed its Indochinese empire with the annexation of Laos, leaving the kingdom of Siam (now Thailand) with an uneasy independence as a neutral buffer between British and French-ruled lands. The United States laid claim to the Philippines, and after the Spanish–American War, took control of the archipelago as one of its overseas possessions.

===Indonesia===

Formal colonization of the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) commenced at the dawn of the 19th century when the Dutch state took possession of all Dutch East India Company (VOC) assets. Before that time the VOC merchants were in principle just another trading power among many, establishing trading posts and settlements (colonies) in strategic places around the archipelago. The Dutch gradually extended their sovereignty over most of the islands in the East Indies. Dutch expansion paused for several years during an interregnum of British rule between 1806 and 1816, when the Dutch Republic was occupied by the French forces of Napoleon. The Dutch government-in-exile in England ceded rule of all its colonies to Great Britain. However, Jan Willem Janssens, the governor of the Dutch East Indies at the time, fought the British before surrendering the colony; he was eventually replaced by Stamford Raffles.

The Dutch East Indies became the prize possession of the Dutch Empire. It was not the typical settler colony founded through massive emigration from the mother countries (such as the USA or Australia) and hardly involved displacement of the indigenous islanders, with a notable and dramatic exception in the island of Banda during the VOC era. Neither was it a plantation colony built on the import of slaves (such as Haiti or Jamaica) or a pure trade post colony (such as Singapore or Macau). It was more of an expansion of the existing chain of VOC trading posts. Instead of mass emigration from the homeland, the sizeable indigenous populations were controlled through effective political manipulation supported by military force. The servitude of the indigenous masses was enabled through a structure of indirect governance, keeping existing indigenous rulers in place. This strategy was already established by the VOC, which independently acted as a semi-sovereign state within the Dutch state, using the Indo Eurasian population as an intermediary buffer.

In 1869, British anthropologist Alfred Russel Wallace described the colonial governing structure in his book &quot;The Malay Archipelago&quot;:

&quot;The mode of government now adopted in Java is to retain the whole series of native rulers, from the village chief up to princes, who, under the name of Regents, are the heads of districts about the size of a small English county. With each Regent is placed a Dutch Resident, or Assistant Resident, who is considered to be his &quot;elder brother,&quot; and whose &quot;orders&quot; take the form of &quot;recommendations,&quot; which are, however, implicitly obeyed. Along with each Assistant, Resident is a Controller, a kind of inspector of all the lower native rulers, who periodically visits every village in the district, examines the proceedings of the native courts, hears complaints against the head-men or other native chiefs, and superintends the Government plantations.&quot;

==East Asia==

===China===


In 1839, China found itself fighting the First Opium War with Great Britain after the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei, Lin Zexu, seized the illegally traded opium. China was defeated, and in 1842 agreed to the provisions of the Treaty of Nanking. Hong Kong Island was ceded to Britain, and certain ports, including Shanghai and Guangzhou, were opened to British trade and residence. In 1856, the Second Opium War broke out; the Chinese were again defeated and forced to the terms of the 1858 Treaty of Tientsin and the 1860 Convention of Peking. The treaty opened new ports to trade and allowed foreigners to travel in the interior. Missionaries gained the right to propagate Christianity, another means of Western penetration. The United States and Russia obtained the same prerogatives in separate treaties.

Towards the end of the 19th century, China appeared on the way to territorial dismemberment and economic vassalage, the fate of India&#x27;s rulers that had played out much earlier. Several provisions of these treaties caused long-standing bitterness and humiliation among the Chinese: extraterritoriality (meaning that in a dispute with a Chinese person, a Westerner had the right to be tried in a court under the laws of his own country), customs regulation, and the right to station foreign warships in Chinese waters.

In 1904, the British invaded Tibet, a pre-emptive strike against Russian intrigues and secret meetings between the 13th Dalai Lama&#x27;s envoy and Tsar Nicholas II. The Dalai Lama fled into exile to China and Mongolia. The British were greatly concerned at the prospect of a Russian invasion of the Crown colony of India, though Russia – badly defeated by Japan in the Russo-Japanese War and weakened by internal revolution – could not realistically afford a military conflict against Britain. China under the Qing dynasty, however, was another matter.

Natural disasters, famine and internal rebellions had enfeebled China in the late Qing. In the late 19th century, Japan and the Great Powers easily carved out trade and territorial concessions. These were humiliating submissions for the once-powerful China. Still, the central lesson of the war with Japan was not lost on the Russian General Staff: an Asian country using Western technology and industrial production methods could defeat a great European power. Jane E. Elliott criticized the allegation that China refused to modernize or was unable to defeat Western armies as simplistic, noting that China embarked on a massive military modernization in the late 1800s after several defeats, buying weapons from Western countries and manufacturing their own at arsenals, such as the Hanyang Arsenal during the Boxer Rebellion. In addition, Elliott questioned the claim that Chinese society was traumatized by the Western victories, as many Chinese peasants (90% of the population at that time) living outside the concessions continued about their daily lives, uninterrupted and without any feeling of &quot;humiliation&quot;.

The British observer Demetrius Charles de Kavanagh Boulger suggested a British-Chinese alliance to check Russian expansion in Central Asia.

During the Ili crisis when Qing China threatened to go to war against Russia over the Russian occupation of Ili, the British officer Charles George Gordon was sent to China by Britain to advise China on military options against Russia should a potential war break out between China and Russia.

The Russians observed the Chinese building up their arsenal of modern weapons during the Ili crisis, the Chinese bought thousands of rifles from Germany. In 1880 massive amounts of military equipment and rifles were shipped via boats to China from Antwerp as China purchased torpedoes, artillery, and 260,260 modern rifles from Europe.

The Russian military observer D. V. Putiatia visited China in 1888 and found that in Northeastern China (Manchuria) along the Chinese-Russian border, the Chinese soldiers were potentially able to become adept at &quot;European tactics&quot; under certain circumstances, and the Chinese soldiers were armed with modern weapons like Krupp artillery, Winchester carbines, and Mauser rifles.

Compared to Russian controlled areas, more benefits were given to the Muslim Kirghiz on the Chinese controlled areas. Russian settlers fought against the Muslim nomadic Kirghiz, which led the Russians to believe that the Kirghiz would be a liability in any conflict against China. The Muslim Kirghiz were sure that in an upcoming war, that China would defeat Russia.

The Qing dynasty forced Russia to hand over disputed territory in Ili in the Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1881), in what was widely seen by the west as a diplomatic victory for the Qing. Russia acknowledged that Qing China potentially posed a serious military threat. Mass media in the west during this era portrayed China as a rising military power due to its modernization programs and as major threat to the western world, invoking fears that China would successfully conquer western colonies like Australia.

Russian sinologists, the Russian media, threat of internal rebellion, the pariah status inflicted by the Congress of Berlin, and the negative state of the Russian economy all led Russia to concede and negotiate with China in St Petersburg, and return most of Ili to China.

Historians have judged the Qing dynasty&#x27;s vulnerability and weakness to foreign imperialism in the 19th century to be based mainly on its maritime naval weakness while it achieved military success against westerners on land, the historian Edward L. Dreyer said that &quot;China’s nineteenth-century humiliations were strongly related to her weakness and failure at sea. At the start of the Opium War, China had no unified navy and no sense of how vulnerable she was to attack from the sea; British forces sailed and steamed wherever they wanted to go. ... In the Arrow War (1856–60), the Chinese had no way to prevent the Anglo-French expedition of 1860 from sailing into the Gulf of Zhili and landing as near as possible to Beijing. Meanwhile, new but not exactly modern Chinese armies suppressed the midcentury rebellions, bluffed Russia into a peaceful settlement of disputed frontiers in Central Asia, and defeated the French forces on land in the Sino-French War (1884–1885). But the defeat of the fleet, and the resulting threat to steamship traffic to Taiwan, forced China to conclude peace on unfavorable terms.&quot;

The British and Russian consuls schemed and plotted against each other at Kashgar.

In 1906, Tsar Nicholas II sent a secret agent to China to collect intelligence on the reform and modernization of the Qing dynasty. The task was given to Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, at the time a colonel in the Russian army, who travelled to China with French Sinologist Paul Pelliot. Mannerheim was disguised as an ethnographic collector, using a Finnish passport. Finland was, at the time, a Grand Duchy. For two years, Mannerheim proceeded through Xinjiang, Gansu, Shaanxi, Henan, Shanxi and Inner Mongolia to Beijing. At the sacred Buddhist mountain of Wutai Shan he even met the 13th Dalai Lama. However, while Mannerheim was in China in 1907, Russia and Britain brokered the Anglo-Russian Agreement, ending the classical period of the Great Game.

The correspondent Douglas Story observed Chinese troops in 1907 and praised their abilities and military skill.

The rise of Japan as an imperial power after the Meiji Restoration led to further subjugation of China. In a dispute over regional suzerainty, war broke out between China and Japan, resulting in another humiliating defeat for the Chinese. By the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, China was forced to recognize Korea&#x27;s exit from the Imperial Chinese tributary system, leading to the proclamation of the Korean Empire, and the island of Taiwan was ceded to Japan.

In 1897, taking advantage of the murder of two missionaries, Germany demanded and was given a set of mining and railroad rights around Jiaozhou Bay in Shandong province. In 1898, Russia obtained access to Dairen and Port Arthur and the right to build a railroad across Manchuria, thereby achieving complete domination over a large portion of northeast China. The United Kingdom, France, and Japan also received a number of concessions later that year.

The erosion of Chinese sovereignty contributed to a spectacular anti-foreign outbreak in June 1900, when the &quot;Boxers&quot; (properly the society of the &quot;righteous and harmonious fists&quot;) attacked foreign legations in Beijing. This Boxer Rebellion provoked a rare display of unity among the colonial powers, who formed the Eight-Nation Alliance. Troops landed at Tianjin and marched on the capital, which they took on 14 August; the foreign soldiers then looted and occupied Beijing for several months. German forces were particularly severe in exacting revenge for the killing of their ambassador, while Russia tightened its hold on Manchuria in the northeast until its crushing defeat by Japan in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905.

Extraterritorial jurisdiction was abandoned by the United Kingdom and the United States in 1943.

Mainland Chinese historians refer to this period as the century of humiliation.

==Central Asia==


The &quot;Great Game&quot; (Also called the &quot;Tournament of Shadows&quot; (, &quot;Turniry Teney&quot;) in Russia) was the strategic, economic and political rivalry, emanating to conflict between the British Empire and the Russian Empire for supremacy in Central Asia at the expense of Afghanistan, Persia and the Central Asian Khanates/Emirates. The classic Great Game period is generally regarded as running approximately from the Russo-Persian Treaty of 1813 to the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907, in which nations like Emirate of Bukhara fell. A less intensive phase followed the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, causing some trouble with Persia and Afghanistan until the mid-1920s.

In the post-Second World War post-colonial period, the term has informally continued in its usage to describe the geopolitical machinations of the great powers and regional powers as they vie for geopolitical power as well as influence in the area, especially in Afghanistan and Iran/Persia.

==Africa==

===Prelude===
Between 1850 and 1914, Britain brought nearly 30% of Africa&#x27;s population under its control, to 15% for France, 9% for Germany, 7% for Belgium and 1% for Italy: Nigeria alone contributed 15 million subjects to Britain, more than in the whole of French West Africa, or the entire German colonial empire. The only nations that were not under European control by 1914 were Liberia and Ethiopia.

===British colonies===
Britain&#x27;s formal occupation of Egypt in 1882, triggered by concern over the Suez Canal, contributed to a preoccupation over securing control of the Nile River, leading to the conquest of neighboring Sudan in 1896–1898, which in turn led to confrontation with a French military expedition at Fashoda in September 1898. In 1899, Britain set out to complete its takeover of the future South Africa, which it had begun in 1814 with the annexation of the Cape Colony, by invading the gold-rich Afrikaner republics of Transvaal and the neighboring Orange Free State. The chartered British South Africa Company had already seized the land to the north, renamed Rhodesia after its head, the Cape tycoon Cecil Rhodes.

British gains in southern and East Africa prompted Rhodes and Alfred Milner, Britain&#x27;s High Commissioner in South Africa, to urge a &quot;Cape to Cairo&quot; empire: linked by rail, the strategically important Canal would be firmly connected to the mineral-rich South, though Belgian control of the Congo Free State and German control of German East Africa prevented such an outcome until the end of World War I, when Great Britain acquired the latter territory.

Britain&#x27;s quest for southern Africa and its diamonds led to social complications and fallouts that lasted for years. To work for their prosperous company, British businessmen hired both white and black South Africans. But when it came to jobs, the white South Africans received the higher paid and less dangerous ones, leaving the black South Africans to risk their lives in the mines for limited pay. This process of separating the two groups of South Africans, whites and blacks, was the beginning of segregation between the two that lasted until 1990.

Paradoxically, the United Kingdom, a staunch advocate of free trade, emerged in 1913 with not only the largest overseas empire, thanks to its long-standing presence in India, but also the greatest gains in the conquest of Africa, reflecting its advantageous position at its inception.

===Congo Free State===
Until 1876, Belgium had no colonial presence in Africa. It was then that its king, Leopold II created the International African Society. Operating under the pretense of an international scientific and philanthropic association, it was actually a private holding company owned by Leopold. Henry Morton Stanley was employed to explore and colonize the Congo River basin area of equatorial Africa in order to capitalize on the plentiful resources such as ivory, rubber, diamonds, and metals. Up until this point, Africa was known as &quot;the Dark Continent&quot; because of the difficulties Europeans had with exploration. Over the next few years, Stanley overpowered and made treaties with over 450 native tribes, acquiring him over of land, nearly 67 times the size of Belgium.

Neither the Belgian government nor the Belgian people had any interest in imperialism at the time, and the land came to be personally owned by King Leopold II. At the Berlin Conference in 1884, he was allowed to have land named the Congo Free State. The other European countries at the conference allowed this to happen on the conditions that he suppress the East African slave trade, promote humanitarian policies, guarantee free trade, and encourage missions to Christianize the people of the Congo. However, Leopold II&#x27;s primary focus was to make a large profit on the natural resources, particularly ivory and rubber. In order to make this profit, he passed several cruel decrees that can be considered to be genocide. He forced the natives to supply him with rubber and ivory without any sort of payment in return. Their wives and children were held hostage until the workers returned with enough rubber or ivory to fill their quota, and if they could not, their family would be killed. When villages refused, they were burned down; the children of the village were murdered and the men had their hands cut off. These policies led to uprisings, but they were feeble compared to European military and technological might, and were consequently crushed. The forced labor was opposed in other ways: fleeing into the forests to seek refuge or setting the rubber forests on fire, preventing the Europeans from harvesting the rubber.

No population figures exist from before or after the period, but it is estimated that as many as 10 million people died from violence, famine and disease. However, some sources point to a total population of 16 million people.

King Leopold II profited from the enterprise with a 700% profit ratio for the rubber he took from Congo and exported. He used propaganda to keep the other European nations at bay, for he broke almost all of the parts of the agreement he made at the Berlin Conference. For example, he had some Congolese pygmies sing and dance at the 1897 World Fair in Belgium, showing how he was supposedly civilizing and educating the natives of the Congo. Under significant international pressure, the Belgian government annexed the territory in 1908 and renamed it the Belgian Congo, removing it from the personal power of the king. Of all the colonies that were conquered during the wave of New Imperialism, the human rights abuses of the Congo Free State were considered the worst.

==Oceania==

France gained a leading position as an imperial power in the Pacific after making Tahiti and New Caledonia protectorates in 1842 and 1853 respectively. Tahiti was later annexed entirely into the French colonial empire in 1880, along with the rest of the Society Islands.

The United States made several territorial gains during this period, particularly with the overthrow and annexation of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi and acquisition of most of Spain&#x27;s colonial outposts following the 1898 Spanish–American War, as well as the partition of the Samoan Islands into American Samoa and German Samoa.

By 1900, nearly all islands in the Pacific Ocean were under the control of Britain, France, the United States, Germany, Japan, Mexico, Ecuador, and Chile.

===Chilean expansion===
Chile&#x27;s interest in expanding into the islands of the Pacific Ocean dates to the presidency of José Joaquín Prieto (1831–1841) and the ideology of Diego Portales, who considered that Chile&#x27;s expansion into Polynesia was a natural consequence of its maritime destiny. Nonetheless, the first stage of the country&#x27;s expansionism into the Pacific began only a decade later, in 1851, when—in response to an American incursion into the Juan Fernández Islands—Chile&#x27;s government formally organized the islands into a subdelegation of Valparaíso. That same year, Chile&#x27;s economic interest in the Pacific were renewed after its merchant fleet briefly succeeded in creating an agricultural goods exchange market that connected the Californian port of San Francisco with Australia. By 1861, Chile had established a lucrative enterprise across the Pacific, its national currency abundantly circulating throughout Polynesia and its merchants trading in the markets of Tahiti, New Zealand, Tasmania, and Shanghai; negotiations were also made with the Spanish Philippines, and altercations reportedly occurred between Chilean and American whalers in the Sea of Japan. This period ended as a result of the Chilean merchant fleet&#x27;s destruction by Spanish forces in 1866, during the Chincha Islands War.

Chile&#x27;s Polynesian aspirations would again be awakened in the aftermath of the country&#x27;s decisive victory against Peru in the War of the Pacific, which left the Chilean fleet as the dominant maritime force in the Pacific coast of the Americas. Valparaíso had also become the most important port in the Pacific coast of South America, providing Chilean merchants with the capacity to find markets in the Pacific for its new mineral wealth acquired from the Atacama. During this period, the Chilean intellectual and politician Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna (who served as senator in the National Congress from 1876 to 1885) was an influential voice in favor of Chilean expansionism into the Pacific—he considered that Spain&#x27;s discoveries in the Pacific had been stolen by the British, and envisioned that Chile&#x27;s duty was to create an empire in the Pacific that would reach Asia. In the context of this imperialist fervor is that, in 1886, Captain Policarpo Toro of the Chilean Navy proposed to his superiors the annexation of Easter Island; a proposal which was supported by President José Manuel Balmaceda because of the island&#x27;s apparent strategic location and economic value. After Toro transferred the rights to the island&#x27;s sheep ranching operations from Tahiti-based businesses to the Chilean-based Williamson-Balfour Company in 1887, Easter Island&#x27;s annexation process was culminated with the signing of the &quot;Agreement of Wills&quot; between Rapa Nui chieftains and Toro, in name of the Chilean government, in 1888. By occupying Easter Island, Chile joined the imperial nations.

==Imperial rivalries==
The extension of European control over Africa and Asia added a further dimension to the rivalry and mutual suspicion which characterized international diplomacy in the decades preceding World War I. France&#x27;s seizure of Tunisia in 1881 initiated fifteen years of tension with Italy, which had hoped to take the country, retaliating by allying with Germany and waging a decade-long tariff war with France. Britain&#x27;s takeover of Egypt a year later caused a marked cooling of its relations with France.

The most striking conflicts of the era were the Spanish–American War of 1898 and the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05, each signaling the advent of a new imperial great power; the United States and Japan, respectively. The Fashoda incident of 1898 represented the worst Anglo-French crisis in decades, but France&#x27;s buckling in the face of British demands foreshadowed improved relations as the two countries set about resolving their overseas claims.

British policy in South Africa and German actions in the Far East contributed to dramatic policy shifts, which in the 1900s, aligned hitherto isolationist Britain first with Japan as an ally, and then with France and Russia in the looser Triple Entente. German efforts to break the Entente by challenging French hegemony in Morocco resulted in the Tangier Crisis of 1905 and the Agadir Crisis of 1911, adding to tension and anti-German sentiment in the years preceding World War I. In the Pacific, conflicts between Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom contributed to the First and Second Samoan Civil War.

Another crisis occurred in 1902–03, when there was a stand-off between Venezuela backed by Argentina, the United States (see Drago Doctrine and Monroe Doctrine) and a coalition of European countries.

==Motivation==

===Humanitarianism===
One of the biggest motivations behind New Imperialism was the idea of humanitarianism and &quot;civilizing&quot; the &quot;lower&quot; class people in Africa and in other undeveloped places. This was a religious motive for many Christian missionaries, in an attempt to save the souls of the &quot;uncivilized&quot; people, and based on the idea that European Christians were morally superior. Most of the missionaries that supported imperialism did so because they felt the only &quot;true&quot; religion was their own. Similarly, French, Spanish and Italian Catholic missionaries opposed the Protestant British, German, and American missionaries. At times, however, imperialism did help the people of the colonies because the missionaries ended up stopping slavery in some areas. Therefore, Europeans claimed that they were only there because they wanted to protect the weaker tribal groups they conquered. The missionaries and other leaders suggested that they should stop such &quot;savage&quot; practices as cannibalism, idolatry and child marriage. This humanitarian ideal was described in poems such as the &quot;White Man&#x27;s Burden&quot; and other literature.

In many instances, the humanitarianism was sincere, but often with misguided choices. Although some imperialists were trying to be sincere with the notion of humanitarianism, at times their choices might not have been best for the areas they were conquering and the natives living there. As a result, some modern historical revisionists have suggested that new imperialism was driven more by the idea of racial and cultural supremacism, and that claims of &quot;humanitarianism&quot; were either insincere or used as pretexts for territorial expansion.

===Dutch Ethical Policy===

The Dutch Ethical Policy was the dominant reformist and liberal political character of colonial policy in the Dutch East Indies during the 20th century. In 1901, the Dutch Queen Wilhelmina announced that the Netherlands accepted an ethical responsibility for the welfare of their colonial subjects despite clearly being discriminatory towards the oppressed colonised peoples. This announcement was a sharp contrast with the former official doctrine that Indonesia was mainly a &quot;wingewest&quot; (region for making profit). It marked the start of modern development policy, implemented and practised by Alexander Willem Frederik Idenburg, whereas other colonial powers usually talked of a civilizing mission, which mainly involved spreading their culture to colonized peoples and expanding their culture.

The Dutch Ethical Policy (Dutch: &quot;&quot;) emphasised improvement in material living conditions. The policy suffered, however, from serious underfunding, inflated expectations and lack of acceptance in the Dutch colonial establishment, and it had largely ceased to exist by the onset of the Great Depression in 1929. It did however create an educated indigenous elite able to articulate and eventually establish independence from the Netherlands.

==Theories==
The &quot;accumulation theory&quot; adopted by Karl Kautsky, John A. Hobson and popularized by Vladimir Lenin centered on the accumulation of surplus capital during and after the Industrial Revolution: restricted opportunities at home, the argument goes, drove financial interests to seek more profitable investments in less-developed lands with lower labor costs, unexploited raw materials and little competition. Hobson&#x27;s analysis fails to explain colonial expansion on the part of less industrialized nations with little surplus capital, such as Italy, or the great powers of the next century—the United States and Russia—which were in fact net borrowers of foreign capital. Also, military and bureaucratic costs of occupation frequently exceeded financial returns. In Africa (exclusive of what would become the Union of South Africa in 1909) the amount of capital investment by Europeans was relatively small before and after the 1880s, and the companies involved in tropical African commerce exerted limited political influence.

The &quot;World-Systems theory&quot; approach of Immanuel Wallerstein sees imperialism as part of a general, gradual extension of capital investment from the &quot;core&quot; of the industrial countries to a less developed &quot;periphery.&quot; Protectionism and formal empire were the major tools of &quot;semi-peripheral,&quot; newly industrialized states, such as Germany, seeking to usurp Britain&#x27;s position at the &quot;core&quot; of the global capitalist system.

Echoing Wallerstein&#x27;s global perspective to an extent, imperial historian Bernard Porter views Britain&#x27;s adoption of formal imperialism as a symptom and an effect of her relative decline in the world, and not of strength: &quot;Stuck with outmoded physical plants and outmoded forms of business organization, [Britain] now felt the less favorable effects of being the first to modernize.&quot;

<text>Primatology is the scientific study of non-human primates. It is a diverse discipline at the boundary between mammalogy and anthropology, and researchers can be found in academic departments of anatomy, anthropology, biology, medicine, psychology, veterinary sciences and zoology, as well as in animal sanctuaries, biomedical research facilities, museums and zoos. Primatologists study both living and extinct primates in their natural habitats and in laboratories by conducting field studies and experiments in order to understand aspects of their evolution and behavior.

==Sub-disciplines==
As a science, primatology has many different sub-disciplines which vary in terms of theoretical and methodological approaches to the subject used in researching extant primates and their extinct ancestors.

There are two main centers of primatology, Western primatology and Japanese primatology. These two divergent disciplines stem from the unique cultural backgrounds and philosophies that went into their founding. Although, fundamentally, both Western and Japanese primatology share many of the same principles, the areas of their focus in primate research and their methods of obtaining data differ widely.

==Western primatology==

===Origins===
Western primatology stems primarily from research by North American and European scientists. Early primate study focused primarily on medical research, but some scientists also conducted &quot;civilizing&quot; experiments on chimpanzees in order to gauge both primate intelligence and the limits of their brainpower.

===Theory===
The study of primatology looks at the biological and psychological aspects of non-human primates. The focus is on studying the common links between humans and primates. Practitioners believe that by understanding our closest animal relatives, we might better understand the nature shared with our ancestors.

===Methods===
Primatology is a science. The general belief is that the scientific observation of nature must be either extremely limited, or completely controlled. Either way, the observers must be neutral to their subjects. This allows for data to be unbiased and for the subjects to be uninfluenced by human interference.

There are three methodological approaches in primatology: field study, the more realistic approach; laboratory study, the more controlled approach; and semi-free ranging, where primate habitat and wild social structure is replicated in a captive setting.

Field study is done in natural environments, in which scientific observers watch primates in their natural habitat.

Laboratory study is done in controlled lab settings. In lab settings, scientists are able to perform controlled experimentation on the learning capabilities and behavioral patterns of the animals.

In semi-free ranging studies, scientists are able to watch how primates might act in the wild but have easier access to them, and the ability to control their environments. Such facilities include the Living Links Center at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center in Georgia, US and the Elgin Center at Lion Country Safari in Florida, US.

All types of primate study in the Western methodology are meant to be neutral. Although there are certain Western primatologists who do more subjective research, the emphasis in this discipline is on the objective.

Early field primatology tended to focus on individual researchers. Researchers such as Jane Goodall, Dian Fossey and Birute Galdikas are examples of this. In 1960, Jane Goodall traveled to the forest at Gombe Stream in Tanzania where her determination and skill allowed for her to observe behaviors of the chimpanzees that no researcher had seen prior. Chimpanzees used tools made from twigs to extract termites from their nests. Additionally, Dian Fossey&#x27;s work conducted at the Karisoke Research station in Rwanda proved the possibility of habituation among the mountain gorillas. Fossey learned that female gorillas are often transferred between groups and gorillas eat their own dung to recycle nutrients. The third &quot;trimate&quot;, Birute Galdikas, spent over 12 years becoming habituated to the orangutans in Borneo, Indonesia. Galdikas utilized statistics and modern data collection to conclude her 1978 doctoral thesis regarding orangutan behavior and interactions.

==Japanese primatology==
===Origins===

The discipline of Japanese primatology was developed out of animal ecology. It is mainly credited to Kinji Imanishi and Junichiro Itani. Imanishi was an animal ecologist who began studying wild horses before focusing more on primate ecology. He helped found the Primate Research Group in 1950. Junichiro was a renowned anthropologist and a professor at Kyoto University. He is a co-founder of the Primate Research Institute and the Centre for African Area Studies.

===Theory===

The Japanese discipline of primatology tends to be more interested in the social aspects of primates. Social evolution and anthropology are of primary interest to them. The Japanese theory believes that studying primates will give us insight into the duality of human nature: individual self vs. social self.

One particular Japanese primatologist, Kawai Masao, introduced the concept of &quot;kyokan&quot;. This was the theory that the only way to attain reliable scientific knowledge was to attain a mutual relation, personal attachment and shared life with the animal subjects. Though Kawai is the only Japanese primatologist associated with the use of this term, the underlying principle is part of the foundation of Japanese primate research.

===Methods===
Japanese primatology is a carefully disciplined subjective science. It is believed that the best data comes through identification with your subject. Neutrality is eschewed in favour of a more casual atmosphere, where researcher and subject can mingle more freely. Domestication of nature is not only desirable, but necessary for study.

Japanese primatologists are renowned for their ability to recognise animals by sight, and indeed most primates in a research group are usually named and numbered. Comprehensive data on every single subject in a group is a uniquely Japanese trait of primate research. Each member of the primate community has a part to play, and the Japanese researchers are interested in this complex interaction.

For Japanese researchers in primatology, the findings of the team are emphasised over the individual. The study of primates is a group effort, and the group will get the credit for it. A team of researchers may observe a group of primates for several years in order to gather very detailed demographic and social histories.

==Primatology in sociobiology==

Where sociobiology attempts to understand the actions of all animal species within the context of advantageous and disadvantageous behaviors, primatology takes an exclusive look at the order Primates, which includes &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. The interface between primatology and sociobiology examines in detail the evolution of primate behavioral processes, and what studying our closest living primate relatives can tell about our own minds. As the American anthropologist Earnest Albert Hooton used to say, &quot;.&quot; (&quot;I am a primate; nothing about primates is outside of my bailiwick&quot;.) The meeting point of these two disciplines has become a nexus of discussion on key issues concerning the evolution of sociality, the development and purpose of language and deceit, and the development and propagation of culture.

Additionally, this interface is of particular interest to the science watchers in science and technology studies, who examine the social conditions which incite, mould, and eventually react to scientific discoveries and knowledge. The STS approach to primatology and sociobiology stretches beyond studying the apes, into the realm of observing the people studying the apes.

===Taxonomic basis===

Before Darwin and molecular biology, the father of modern taxonomy, Carl Linnaeus, organized natural objects into kinds, that we now know reflect their evolutionary relatedness. He sorted these kinds by morphology, the shape of the object. Animals such as gorillas, chimpanzees and orangutans resemble humans closely, so Linnaeus placed &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; together with other similar-looking organisms into the taxonomic order &quot;Primates&quot;. Modern molecular biology reinforced humanity&#x27;s place within the Primate order. Humans and simians share the vast majority of their DNA, with chimpanzees sharing between 97-99% genetic identity with humans.

===From grooming to speaking===

Although social grooming is observed in many animal species, the grooming activities undertaken by primates are not strictly for the elimination of parasites. In primates, grooming is a social activity that strengthens relationships. The amount of grooming taking place between members of a troop is a strong indicator of alliance formation or troop solidarity. Robin Dunbar suggests a link between primate grooming and the development of human language. The size of the neocortex in a primate&#x27;s brain correlates directly to the number of individuals it can keep track of socially, be it a troop of chimps or a tribe of humans.

This number is referred to as the monkeysphere. If a population exceeds the size outlined by its cognitive limitations, the group undergoes a schism. Set into an evolutionary context, the Dunbar number shows a drive for the development of a method of bonding that is less labor-intensive than grooming: language. As the monkeysphere grows, the amount of time that would need to be spent grooming troopmates soon becomes unmanageable. Furthermore, it is only possible to bond with one troopmate at a time while grooming. The evolution of vocal communication solves both the time constraint and the one-on-one problem, but at a price.

Language allows for bonding with multiple people at the same time at a distance, but the bonding produced by language is less intense. This view of language evolution covers the general biological trends needed for language development, but it takes another hypothesis to uncover the evolution of the cognitive processes necessary for language.

===Modularity of the primate mind===

Noam Chomsky&#x27;s concept of innate language addresses the existence of universal grammar, which suggests a special kind of &quot;device&quot; all humans are born with whose sole purpose is language. Fodor&#x27;s modular mind hypothesis expands on this concept, suggesting the existence of preprogrammed modules for dealing with many, or all aspects of cognition. Although these modules do not need to be physically distinct, they must be functionally distinct. There was an experiment to teach language to orangutans at the Smithsonian National Zoo using a computer system developed by primatologist Francine Neago in conjunction with IBM.

The massive modularity theory thesis posits that there is a huge number of tremendously interlinked but specialized modules running programs called Darwinian algorithms, or DA. DA can be selected for just as a gene can, eventually improving cognition. The contrary theory, of generalist mind, suggests that the brain is just a big computer that runs one program, the mind. If the mind is a general computer, for instance, the ability to use reasoning should be identical regardless of the context. This is not what is observed. When faced with abstract numbers and letters with no &quot;real world&quot; significance, respondents of the Wason card test generally do very poorly. However, when exposed to a test with an identical rule set but socially relevant content, respondents score markedly higher. The difference is especially pronounced when the content is about reward and payment. This test strongly suggests that human logic is based on a module originally developed in a social environment to root out cheaters, and that either the module is at a huge disadvantage where abstract thinking is involved, or that other less effective modules are used when faced with abstract logic.

Further evidence supporting the modular mind has steadily emerged with some startling revelations concerning primates. A very recent study indicated that human babies and grown monkeys approach and process numbers in a similar fashion, suggesting an evolved set of DA for mathematics (Jordan). The conceptualization of both human infants and primate adults is cross-sensory, meaning that they can add 15 red dots to 20 beeps and approximate the answer to be 35 grey squares. As more evidence of basic cognitive modules are uncovered, they will undoubtedly form a more solid foundation upon which the more complex behaviors can be understood.

In contradiction to this, neuroscientist Jaak Panksepp has argued that the mind is not a computer nor is it massively modular. He states that no evidence of massive modularity or the brain as a digital computer has been gained through actual neuroscience, as opposed to psychological studies. He criticises psychologists who use the massive modularity thesis for not integrating neuroscience into their understanding.

===The primate theory of mind===

Primate behavior, like human behavior, is highly social and ripe with the intrigue of kingmaking, powerplays, deception, cuckoldry, and apology. In order to understand the staggeringly complex nature of primate interactions, we look to theory of mind. Theory of mind asks whether or not an individual recognizes and can keep track of information asymmetry amongst individuals in the group, and whether or not they can attribute folk psychological states to their peers. If some primates can tell what others know and want and act accordingly, they can gain advantage and status.

Recently, chimpanzee theory of mind has been advanced by Felix Warneken of the Max Planck Institute. His studies have shown that chimpanzees can recognize whether a researcher desires a dropped object, and act accordingly by picking it up. Even more compelling is the observation that chimps will only act if the object is dropped in an accidental-looking manner: if the researcher drops the object in a way that appears intentional, the chimp will ignore the object.

In a related experiment, groups of chimps were given rope-pulling problems they could not solve individually. Warneken&#x27;s subjects rapidly figured out which individual in the group was the best rope puller and assigned it the bulk of the task. This research is highly indicative of the ability of chimps to detect the folk psychological state of &quot;desire&quot;, as well as the ability to recognize that other individuals are better at certain tasks than they are.

However primates do not always fare so well in situations requiring theory of mind. In one experiment pairs of chimpanzees who had been close grooming partners were offered two levers. Pressing one lever would bring them food and another would bring their grooming partner food. Pressing the lever to clearly give their grooming partner much-wanted food would not take away from how much food they themselves got. For some reason, the chimps were unwilling to depress the lever that would give their long-time chums food. It is plausible but unlikely that the chimps figured there was finite food and it would eventually decrease their own food reward. The experiments are open to such interpretations making it hard to establish anything for certain.

One phenomenon which would indicate a possible fragility of theory of mind in primates occurs when a baboon gets lost. Under such circumstances, the lost baboon generally makes &quot;call barks&quot; to announce that it is lost. Previous to the 1990s it was thought that these call barks would then be returned by the other baboons, similar to the case is in vervet monkeys. However, when researchers studied this formally in the past few years they found something surprising: Only the baboons who were lost would ever give call barks. Even if an infant was wailing in agony just a few hundred meters away, its mother who would clearly recognise its voice and would be frantic about his safety (or alternatively run towards her infant depending on her own perceived safety), would often simply stare in his direction visibly agitated. If the anguishing baboon mother made any type of call at all, the infant would instantly recognise her and run to her position. This type of logic appears to be lost on the baboon, suggesting a serious gap in theory of mind of this otherwise seemingly very intelligent primate species. However, it is also possible that baboons do not return call barks for ecological reasons, for example because returning the call bark might call attention to the lost baboon, putting it at greater risk from predators.

===Criticisms===

Scientific studies concerning primate and human behavior have been subject to the same set of political and social complications, or biases, as every other scientific discipline. The borderline and multidisciplinary nature of primatology and sociobiology make them ripe fields of study because they are amalgams of objective and subjective sciences. Current scientific practice, especially in the hard sciences, requires a total dissociation of personal experience from the finished scientific product (Bauchspies 8). This is a strategy that is incompatible with observational field studies, and weakens them in the eyes of hard science. As mentioned above, the Western school of primatology tries to minimize subjectivity, while the Japanese school of primatology tends to embrace the closeness inherent in studying nature.

Social critics of science, some operating from within the field, are critical of primatology and sociobiology. Claims are made that researchers bring pre-existing opinions on issues concerning human sociality to their studies, and then seek evidence that agrees with their worldview or otherwise furthers a sociopolitical agenda. In particular, the use of primatological studies to assert gender roles, and to both promote and subvert feminism has been a point of contention.

Several research papers on primate cognition were retracted in 2010. Their lead author, primatologist Marc Hauser, was dismissed from Harvard University after an internal investigation found evidence of scientific misconduct in his laboratory. Data supporting the authors&#x27; conclusion that cottontop tamarin monkeys displayed pattern-learning behavior similar to human infants reportedly could not be located after a three-year investigation.

==Women in primatology==
Women receive the majority of PhDs in primatology. Londa Schiebinger, writing in 2001, estimated that women made up 80 percent of graduate students pursuing PhDs in primatology, up from 50 percent in the 1970s. Because of the high number of women, Schiebinger has even asserted that &quot;Primatology is widely celebrated as a feminist science&quot;.

===The evolution of primatology===
In 1970 Jeanne Altmann drew attention to representative sampling methods in which all individuals, not just the dominant and the powerful, were observed for equal periods of time. Prior to 1970, primatologists used &quot;opportunistic sampling&quot;, which only recorded what caught their attention.

Sarah Hrdy, a self-identified feminist, was among the first to apply what became known as sociobiological theory to primates. In her studies, she focuses on the need for females to win from males parental care for their offspring.

Linda Fedigan views herself as a reporter or translator, working at the intersection between gender studies of science and the mainstream study of primatology.

While some influential women challenged fundamental paradigms, Schiebinger suggests that science is constituted by numerous factors, varying from gender roles and domestic issues that surround race and class to economic relations between researchers from developed world countries and the developing world countries in which most nonhuman primates reside.

===Changing stereotypes===
Darwin noted that sexual selection acts differently on females and males. Early research emphasized male-male competition for females. It was widely believed that males tend to woo females, and that females are passive. For years this was the dominant interpretation, emphasizing competition among dominant males who control territorial boundaries and maintain order among lesser males. Females, on the other hand, were described as &quot;dedicated mothers to small infants and sexually available to males in order of the males&#x27; dominance rank&quot;. Female-female competition was ignored. Schiebinger proposed that the failure to acknowledge female-female competitions could &quot;skew notions of sexual selection&quot; to &quot;ignore interactions between males and females that go beyond the strict interpretation of sex as for reproduction only&quot;. In the 1960s primatologists started looking at what females did, slowly changing the stereotype of the passive female. We now know that females are active participants, and even leaders, within their groups. For instance, Rowell found that female baboons determine the route for daily foraging. Similarly, Shirley Strum found that male investment in special relationships with females had greater productive payoff in comparison to a male&#x27;s rank in a dominance hierarchy. This emerging &quot;female point of view&quot; resulted in a reanalysis of how aggression, reproductive access, and dominance affect primate societies.

Schiebinger has also accused sociobiologists of producing the &quot;corporate primate&quot;, described as &quot;female baboons with briefcases, strategically competitive and aggressive&quot;. This contrasts with the notion that only men are competitive and aggressive. Observations have repeatedly demonstrated that female apes and monkeys also form stable dominance hierarchies and alliances with their male counterparts. Females display aggression, exercise sexual choice, and compete for resources, mates and territory, like their male counterparts.

===Six features of feminist perspective that characterize contemporary primatology (Fedigan)===

# Reflexivity: sensitivity to context and cultural bias in scientific work.
# &quot;The female point of view&quot;
# Respect for nature and an ethic of cooperation with nature
# Move away from reductionism
# Promote humanitarian values rather than national interests
# Diverse community, accessible and egalitarian

Schiebinger suggests that only two out of the six features are characteristic of feminism. One of them is the discussion of the politics of participation and the attention placed on females as subjects of research.

<text>Taharqa, also spelled Taharka or Taharqo, Akkadian: &quot;Tar-qu-ú&quot;, , Manetho&#x27;s &quot;Tarakos&quot;, Strabo&#x27;s &quot;Tearco&quot;), was a pharaoh of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt and qore (king) of the Kingdom of Kush (present day Sudan) from 690 to 664 BC. He was one of the &quot;Black Pharaohs&quot; who ruled over Egypt for nearly a century, or one of the Nubian (or Kushite) Pharaohs of Egypt, since the traditional representation of the 25th dynasty as &quot;Black Pharaohs&quot; has drawn criticism from scholars, specifically because the term suggests that other dynasties did not share similar southern origins. (see Ancient Egyptian race controversy). They also argue that the term ignores the genetic continuum that linked ancient Nubians and Egyptians.

== Early life ==

Taharqa may have been the son of Piye, the Nubian king of Napata who had first conquered Egypt, though the relationships in this family are not completely clear (see Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt family tree). Taharqa was also the cousin and successor of Shebitku. The successful campaigns of Piye and Shabaka paved the way for a prosperous reign by Taharqa.

== Ruling period ==
Taharqa&#x27;s reign can be dated from 690 BC to 664 BC. Evidence for the dates of his reign is derived from the Serapeum stele, catalog number 192. This stela records that an Apis bull born and installed (fourth month of Season of the Emergence, day 9) in year 26 of Taharqa died in Year 20 of Psamtik I (4th month of Shomu, day 20), having lived 21 years. This would give Taharqa a reign of 26 years and a fraction, in 690–664 BC.
== Irregular accession to power ==
Taharqa explicitly states in Kawa Stela V, line 15, that he succeeded his predecessor (previously assumed to be Shebitku but now established to be Shabaka instead) after the latter&#x27;s death with this statement: &quot;I received the Crown in Memphis after the Falcon flew to heaven.&quot; The reference to Shebitku was an attempt by Taharqa to legitimise his accession to power. However, Taharqa never mentions the identity of the royal falcon and completely omits any mention of Shabaka&#x27;s intervening reign between Shebitku and Taharqa possibly because he ousted Shabaka from power.

In Kawa IV, line 7–13, Taharqa states:

In Kawa V: line 15, Taharqa states
Therefore, Taharqa says that King Shebitku, who was very fond of him, brought him with him to Egypt and during that trip he had the opportunity to see the deplorable state of the temple of Amun at Kawa, an event he remembered after becoming king. But on Kawa V Taharqa says that sometime after his arrival in Egypt under a different king whom this time he chose not to name, there occurred the death of this monarch (Shabaka here) and then his own accession to the throne occurred. Taharqa&#x27;s evasiveness on the identity of his predecessor suggests that he assumed power in an irregular fashion and chose to legitimise his kingship by conveniently stating the possible fact or propaganda that Shebitku favoured him &quot;more than all his brothers and all his children.&quot;

Moreover, in lines 13 – 14 of Kawa stela V, His Majesty (who can be none other but Shebitku), is mentioned twice, and at first sight the falcon or hawk that flew to heaven, mentioned in the very next line 15, seems to be identical with His Majesty referred to directly before (i.e. Shebitku). However, in the critical line 15 which recorded Taharqa&#x27;s accession to power, a new stage of the narrative begins, separated from the previous one by a period of many years, and the king or hawk/falcon that flew to heaven is conspicuously left unnamed in order to distinguish him from His Majesty, Shebitku. Moreover, the purpose of Kawa V, was to describe several separate events that occurred at distinct stages of Taharqa&#x27;s life, instead of telling a continuous story about it. Therefore, the Kawa V text began with the 6th year of Taharqa and referred to the High Nile flood of that year before abruptly jumping back to Taharqa&#x27;s youth at the end of line 13. In the beginning of line 15, Taharqa&#x27;s coronation is mentioned (with the identity of the hawk/falcon—now known to be Shabaka—left unnamed but if it was Shebitku, Taharqa&#x27;s favourite king, Taharqa would clearly have identified him) and there is a description given of the extent of the lands and foreign countries under Egypt&#x27;s control but then (in the middle of line 16) the narrative switches abruptly back again to Taharqa&#x27;s youth: &quot;My mother was in Ta-Sety …. Now I was far from her as a twenty year old recruit, as I went with His Majesty to the North Land&quot;. However, immediately afterwards (around the middle of line 17) the text jumps forward again to the time of Taharqa&#x27;s accession: &quot;Then she came sailing downstream to see me after a long period of years. She found me after I had appeared on the throne of Horus...&quot;. Hence, the Kawa V narrative switches from one event to another, and has little to no chronological coherence or value.

== Reign ==

Although Taharqa&#x27;s reign was filled with conflict with the Assyrians, it was also a prosperous renaissance period in Egypt and Kush. The empire flourished under Taharqa, due in part to a particularly large Nile river flood, abundant crops, and the &quot;intellectual and material resources set free by an efficient central government.&quot; Taharqa&#x27;s inscriptions indicate that he gave large amounts of gold to the temple of Amun at Kawa. The Nile valley empire was as large as it had been since the New Kingdom. Taharqa and the 25th dynasty revived Egyptian culture. Religion, arts, and architecture were restored to their glorious Old, Middle, and New Kingdom forms. During Taharqa&#x27;s reign, the &quot;central features of Theban theology were merged with Egyptian Middle and New Kingdom imperial ideology.&quot;. Under Taharqa, the cultural integration of Egypt and Kush reached such a point that it could not be reversed, even after the Assyrian conquest.

Taharqa restored existing temples and built new ones. Particularly impressive were his additions to the Temple at Karnak, new temple at Kawa, and temples at Jebel Barkal. Taharqa continued the 25th dynasty&#x27;s ambitious program to develop Jebel Barkal into a &quot;monumental complex of sancturies...centered around the great temple of...Amun.&quot; The similarity of Jebel Barkal to Karnak &quot;seems to be central to the builders at Jebel Barkal.&quot;. The rest of Taharqa&#x27;s constructions served to create &quot;Temple Towns&quot;, which were &quot;local centers of government, production, and redistribution.&quot;

It was during the 25th dynasty that the Nile valley saw the first widespread construction of pyramids (many in modern Sudan) since the Middle Kingdom. Taharqa built the largest pyramid (~52 meters square at base) in the Nubian region at Nuri (near El-Kurru) with the most elaborate Kushite rock-cut tomb. Taharqa was buried with &quot;over 1070 shabtis of varying sizes and made of granite, green ankerite, and alabaster.&quot;

== War between Taharqa and Assyria ==
Taharqa began cultivating alliances with elements in Phoenicia and Philistia who were prepared to take a more independent position against Assyria. Taharqa&#x27;s army undertook successful military campaigns, as attested by the &quot;list of conquered Asiatic principalities&quot; from the Mut temple at Karnak and &quot;conquered peoples and countries (Libyans, Shasu nomads, Phoenicians?, Khor in Palestine)&quot; from Sanam temple inscriptions. Torok mentions the military success was due to Taharqa&#x27;s efforts to strengthen the army through daily training in long-distance running, as well as Assyria&#x27;s preoccupation with Babylon and Elam. Taharqa also built military settlements at the Semna and Buhen forts and the fortified site of Qasr Ibrim.

Imperial ambitions of the Mesopotamian-based Assyrian Empire made war with the 25th dynasty inevitable. In 701 BC, the Kushites aided Judah and King Hezekiah in withstanding the siege of Jerusalem by King Sennacherib of the Assyrians (2 Kings 19:9; Isaiah 37:9). There are various theories (Taharqa&#x27;s army, disease, divine intervention, Hezekiah&#x27;s surrender, Herodotus&#x27; mice theory) as to why the Assyrians failed to take Jerusalem and withdrew to Assyria. historians claim that Sennacherib was the overlord of Khor following the siege in 701 BC. Sennacherib&#x27;s annals record Judah was forced into tribute after the siege. However, this is contradicted by Khor&#x27;s frequent utilization of an Egyptian system of weights for trade, the 20 year cessation in Assyria&#x27;s pattern (before 701 and after Sennacherib&#x27;s death) of repeatedly invading Khor, Khor paying tribute to Amun of Karnak in the first half of Taharqa&#x27;s reign, and Taharqa flouting Assyria&#x27;s ban on Lebanese cedar exports to Egypt, while Taharqa was building his temple to Amun at Kawa.
In 679 BC, Sennacherib&#x27;s successor, King Esarhaddon, campaigned into Khor and took a town loyal to Egypt. After destroying Sidon and forcing Tyre into tribute in 677-676 BC, Esarhaddon invaded Egypt proper in 674 BC. Taharqa and his army defeated the Assyrians outright in 674 BC, according to Babylonian records. This invasion, which only a few Assyrian sources discuss, ended in what some scholars have assumed was possibly one of Assyria&#x27;s worst defeats. In 672 BC, Taharqa brought reserve troops from Kush, as mentioned in rock inscriptions. Taharqa&#x27;s Egypt still held sway in Khor during this period as evidenced by Esarhaddon&#x27;s 671 BC annal mentioning that Tyre&#x27;s King Ba&#x27;lu had &quot;put his trust upon his friend Taharqa&quot;, Ashkelon&#x27;s alliance with Egypt, and Esarhaddon&#x27;s inscription asking &quot;if the Kushite-Egyptian forces &#x27;plan and strive to wage war in any way&#x27; and if the Egyptian forces will defeat Esarhaddon at Ashkelon.&quot; However, Taharqa was defeated in Egypt in 671 BC when Esarhaddon conquered Northern Egypt, captured Memphis, imposed tribute, and then withdrew. Although the Pharaoh Taharqa had escaped to the south, Esarhaddon captured the Pharaoh&#x27;s family, including &quot;Prince Nes-Anhuret, royal wives,&quot; and most of the royal court, which were sent to Assyria as hostages. Cuneiform tablets mention numerous horses and gold headdresses were taken back to Assyria. In 669 BC, Taharqa reoccupied Memphis, as well as the Delta, and recommenced intrigues with the king of Tyre. Taharqa intrigued in the affairs of Lower Egypt, and fanned numerous revolts. Esarhaddon again led his army to Egypt and on his death in 668 BC, the command passed to Ashurbanipal. Ashurbanipal and the Assyrians again defeated Taharqa and advanced as far south as Thebes, but direct Assyrian control was not established.&quot; The rebellion was stopped and Ashurbanipal appointed as his vassal ruler in Egypt Necho I, who had been king of the city Sais. Necho&#x27;s son, Psamtik I was educated at the Assyrian capital of Nineveh during Esarhaddon&#x27;s reign. As late as 665 BC, the vassal rulers of Sais, Mendes, and Pelusium were still making overtures to Taharqa in Kush. The vassal&#x27;s plot was uncovered by Ashurbanipal and all rebels but Necho of Sais were executed.

The remains of three colossal statues of Taharqa were found at the entrance of the palace at Nineveh. These statues were probably brought back as war trophies by Esarhaddon, who also brought back royal hostages and numerous luxury objects from Egypt.

== Death ==
Taharqa died in the city of Thebes in 664 BC. He was followed by his appointed successor Tantamani, a son of Shabaka, who invaded Lower Egypt in hopes of restoring his family&#x27;s control. This led to a renewed conflict with Ashurbanipal and the Sack of Thebes by the Assyrians in 663 BCE. He was himself succeeded by a son of Taharqa, Atlanersa.

=== Nuri pyramid ===
Taharqa chose the site of Nuri in North Sudan to build his pyramid, away from the traditional burial site of El-Kurru. It was the first and the largest pyramid of Nuri, and he was followed by close to twenty later kings at the site.
== Biblical references ==
Mainstream scholars agree that Taharqa is the Biblical &quot;Tirhakah&quot; (Heb: תִּרְהָקָה), king of Nubia (Kush), who waged war against Sennacherib during the reign of King Hezekiah of Judah (2 Kings 19:9; Isaiah 37:9).

The events in the biblical account are believed to have taken place in 701 BC, whereas Taharqa came to the throne some ten years later. If the title of king in the biblical text refers to his future royal title, he still may have been too young to be a military commander, although this is disputed. According to the egyptologist Jeremy Pope, Taharqa was probably between 25 and 33 years old in 701 BC and, following Kushite custom to delegate actual leadership in combat to a subordinate, was sent by his predecessor Shabako as a military commander to fight against the Assyrians.

Aubin mentions that the biblical account in Genesis 10:6-7 (Table of Nations) lists Taharqa&#x27;s predecessors, Shebitku and
Shabako (סַבְתְּכָ֑א and סַבְתָּ֥ה). Concerning Taharqa&#x27;s successor, the sack of Thebes was a momentous event that reverberated throughout the Ancient Near East. It is mentioned in the Book of Nahum chapter 3:8-10:


== Depictions ==
Taharqa, under the name &quot;Tearco the Aethiopian&quot;, was described by the Ancient Greek historian Strabo. Strabo mentioned Taharqa in a list of other notable conquerors (Cyrus the Great, Xerxes, Sesotris) and mentioned that these princes had undertaken &quot;expeditions to lands far remote.&quot; Strabo mentions Taharqa as having &quot;Advanced as far as Europe&quot;, and (citing Megasthenes), even as far as the Pillars of Hercules in Spain: Similarly, in 1534 the Muslim scholar Ibn-l-Khattib al-Makkary wrote an account of Taharqa&#x27;s &quot;establishment of a garrison in the south of Spain in approximately 702 BC.&quot;

The two snakes in the crown of pharaoh Taharqa show that he was the king of both the lands of Egypt and Nubia.

== Monuments of Taharqa ==

Taharqa has left monuments throughout Egypt and Nubia. In Memphis, Thebes, and Napata he rebuilt or restored the Temple of Amon.

=== Taharqa in Karnak ===
Taharqa is known for various monuments in Karnak.

=== Shrine of Taharqa in Kawa ===

A small temple of Taharqa was once located at Kawa in Nubia (modern Sudan). It is located today in the Ashmolean Museum.

=== Taharqa in Jebel Barkal ===
Taharqa is depicted in various reliefs in Jebel Barkal, particularly in the Temple of Mut.

<text>The first HMS &quot;Wivern&quot; was an ironclad turret ship built at Birkenhead, England. She was one of two sister ships secretly ordered from the John Laird Sons &amp; Company shipyard in 1862 by the Confederate States of America.

Her true ownership was concealed by the fiction that she was being built as the Egyptian warship &quot;El Monassir&quot;. She was to have been named CSS &quot;Mississippi&quot; upon delivery to the Confederacy. Her sister was built under the false name &quot;El Tousson&quot; and was to have been renamed CSS &quot;North Carolina&quot;. In October 1863, a few months after their launch and before they could be completed, the UK Government seized the two ironclads.

In 1864, the Admiralty bought them and commissioned them into the Royal Navy: &quot;El Monassir&quot; as HMS &quot;Wivern&quot; and &quot;El Tousson&quot; as . &quot;Wivern&quot; had a long Royal Navy career, until she was scrapped in Hong Kong in 1922.

==Design and description==
&quot;Mississippi&quot; and her sister were intended, together with other warships, to break the Federal blockade of Confederate coastal cities and to hold some Northern cities for ransom. The ships had a length between perpendiculars of , a beam of , and a draught of at deep load. They displaced . The hull was divided by 12 watertight bulkheads and the ships had a double bottom beneath the engine and boiler rooms. Their crew consisted of 152 officers and ratings.

The &quot;Scorpion&quot;-class ships had two horizontal direct-acting steam engines, built by Lairds, each driving a single propeller shaft, using steam provided by four tubular boilers. The engines produced a total of which gave the ships a maximum speed of . &quot;Wivern&quot; reached a maximum speed just over during her sea trials on 4 October 1865. The ships carried of coal, enough to steam at . They were barque-rigged with three masts. &quot;Wivern&quot; was the first ship to have tripod masts to reduce interference with the firing arcs of the gun turrets. The funnel was made semi-retractable to reduce wind resistance while under sail.

No ordnance had been ordered by the Confederates before the ships were seized in 1863, but in British service they mounted a pair of 9-inch rifled muzzle-loading guns in each turret. The guns could fire both solid shot and explosive shells. According to Parkes, going from full depression to full elevation supposedly took one hour in smooth water and with an even keel!

The &quot;Scorpion&quot;-class ships had a complete waterline belt of wrought iron that was thick amidships and thinned to at the bow and at the stern. It completely covered the hull from the upper deck to below the waterline. The armour protection of the turrets was quite elaborate. The inside of the turret was lined with of iron boiler plate to which T-shaped beams were bolted. The space between the beams was filled with of teak. This was covered by an iron lattice thick that was covered in turn by of teak. The iron plates were bolted to the outside using bolts that ran through to the interior iron &quot;skin&quot;. The area around the gun ports was reinforced by 4.5-inch plates to give a total thickness of 10 inches. The turret roof consisted of T-shaped beams covered by iron plates.

==Construction and career==
The British government seized the pair of ironclads in October 1863, before they could be completed. In early 1864, the Admiralty purchased both for the Royal Navy. Completed in October 1865, &quot;Wivern&quot; was assigned to the Channel Fleet until 1868. After a refit that reduced her sailing rig from a barque to a schooner, the ship served briefly as a guard ship at Hull and then went into reserve. In 1880 she was dispatched to Hong Kong to serve as the station guard ship there.

The naval architect Edward James Reed wrote: &quot;the turret-ship &#x27;Wivern&#x27;, belonging to the Royal Navy, has a low free-board (about 4 feet), and is very lightly armoured, while her armament is also very light. Yet on one occasion her behaviour at sea was so bad that she had to be brought head to wind in order to prevent her shipping large, and, of course, dangerous, quantities of water, the extreme angle of roll rising to 27 degrees each way.&quot;

One of her commanding officers was Captain Hugh Talbot Burgoyne, VC who was later appointed the commanding officer of . &quot;Wivern&quot; remained in Hong Kong until sold for scrap in 1922, having been reduced to harbor duties from 1904.

<text>John Smith&#x27;s Brewery in Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England, produces beers including John Smith&#x27;s, the highest selling bitter in the United Kingdom since the mid-1990s.

The majority of John Smith&#x27;s sales are of the nitrogenated Extra Smooth product, although a cask conditioned variant is available nationally. A stronger variant called Magnet is also available in the North East of England. John Smith&#x27;s Cask and Magnet are produced under licence by Cameron&#x27;s in Hartlepool.

John Smith acquired the Backhouse &amp; Hartley brewery in 1852. Following a series of acquisitions in the post-World War II period, the company became one of the largest regional brewers in the country, operating over 1,800 licensed premises. The company was taken over by Courage in 1970 who extended distribution of the brewery&#x27;s products into the South of England. Courage was acquired by Scottish &amp; Newcastle in 1995, and the operations were purchased by Heineken in 2008.

John Smith&#x27;s Extra Smooth and Original are produced at the Tadcaster brewery, as well as a range of Heineken products including Amstel and Kronenbourg 1664. With a 38 million litre capacity, the brewery is one of the largest in the country.

John Smith&#x27;s became well known for a series of highly successful &quot;No Nonsense&quot;-themed television advertising campaigns, featuring the dour Yorkshireman character &quot;Arkwright&quot; during the 1970s and 1980s (shown only in the South of England), followed by the comedians Jack Dee during the 1990s and Peter Kay since 2002. The brand also has an association with horse racing: it was the principal sponsor of the Grand National between 2005 and 2013, the Northumberland Plate from 2003 until 2016, and has sponsored the John Smith&#x27;s Cup since 1960.

==History==

===Early years===

Stephen Hartley began brewing in Tadcaster in 1758. Jane Hartley mortgaged the brewery to David Backhouse and John Hartley in 1845. Samuel Smith of Leeds arranged for his son John to enter the business in 1847. Jane Hartley died in 1852, and John Smith acquired the business, enlisting his brother William to assist. The timing was to prove fortuitous; pale ales were displacing porter as the beer of choice, and Tadcaster&#x27;s hard water proved to be well-suited for brewing the new style. The prosperity of the 1850s and 1860s, together with the arrival of the railways, realised greater opportunities for brewers, and John Smith employed eight men in his brewing and malting enterprise by 1861.

The operations became sizeable during the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Smith died in 1879, leaving an estate valued at under £45,000 (around £4.1 million in 2016 adjusted for inflation), and his assets were jointly inherited by his two brothers, William and Samuel Smith, a tanner. William purchased Samuel&#x27;s share of his brother&#x27;s personal estate, and built a modern brewery in 1883–4 at the cost of £130,000 (£9.7 million in 2013). By this time the business employed over 100 people. William Smith died in 1886, and the firm was inherited in partnership by his two nephews, Henry Herbert Riley (1863 - 1911) and Frank Riley, henceforth known as Riley-Smith under the terms of his will.

The firm expanded throughout the 1880s by creating an agency network, establishing sixteen offices in nearby settlements, and offering free trade discounts on their beer of 20 per cent or higher. The brewery had an annual output of 150,000 barrels by 1889. In 1889, the company&#x27;s first scientifically-trained head brewer was appointed, Percy Clinch, son of Charles Clinch of the Eagle Brewery in Witney. In 1892, the partnership became a limited company called John Smith&#x27;s Tadcaster Brewery Company Limited, with Henry Herbert Riley-Smith as chairman. In 1899 the company acquired Simpson &amp; Co of Market Weighton, with 51 public houses, and converted the brewery into a maltings.

By the turn of the century the brewery was considered to be one of the best-run in Britain, &quot;a byword for first-class management&quot;. In 1907, John Marples of Sheffield, the wines and spirits distributor, was acquired. The company began to bottle its own beer in Tadcaster from 1907. In 1912, the company owned over 250 horses, 41 of which saw service during the First World War. Artificially carbonated beer was first bottled in 1923. Paired horse drays were phased out by 1929. During and for some time after the World Wars, the Government raised the duty on beer, and forced brewers to lower their beer strength. During this period, substitutes for malted barley had to be used for brewing, including flaked barley, oats and rye.

The last of the company&#x27;s dray horses was retired in 1947. Horses had delivered beer to all the areas surrounding the brewery, as far afield as Pateley Bridge. From 1948 the company exported beer to Belgium where it was bottled and distributed by Tilkens brewery. In 1950 there was a general strike in Belgium, and John Smith&#x27;s hired two Handley Page Halifax heavy bomber aircraft to carry 7 ton loads twice-daily of their beers into the country in order to ensure supply. In 1953 the firm became a public company, with fixed assets of around £5 million, 1,000 licensed premises and around 1,100 employees. In 1958, Whitworth, Son &amp; Nephew of Wath-upon-Dearne was acquired with 165 licensed houses, and the brewery was immediately closed down. In 1959 the company began to bottle imported Alken lager at Tadcaster, in response to growing customer demand. In 1961 the company also began to bottle Carlsberg lager. By 1960 the company had an estate of 909 public houses.

In 1961, John Smith&#x27;s acquired the Barnsley Brewery Company, adding 250 licensed properties to their growing estate. The company acquired Warwicks &amp; Richardsons of Newark-on-Trent, with 474 pubs, in 1962. Whilst some product rationalisation took place, popular lines such as Warwicks&#x27; Milk Maid Stout were retained. John Smith&#x27;s closed down all the breweries it acquired, apart from Barnsley, where it invested in the brewery, and added production of John Smith beers to the site, as well as increasing the distribution of Barnsley Bitter. As a result of acquisitions, by 1967 John Smith&#x27;s was the third largest regional brewer in the country after Courage and Scottish &amp; Newcastle, with fixed assets of £30 million. Acquisitions diluted the Riley-Smith family stake in the company to around 10 per cent.

===1970–present: Courage takeover and the growth of John Smith&#x27;s Bitter===

In October 1970, Courage purchased John Smith&#x27;s in a friendly takeover which valued the company at £40 million (equivalent to £ million in ). By this time John Smith&#x27;s owned around 1,800 licensed premises throughout the north of England, and as far south as Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire and parts of Cambridgeshire and Shropshire. The merged company held assets worth £137 million. By combining Courage&#x27;s strength in the South of England, and John Smith&#x27;s in the North, a national brewing company was created. John Smith&#x27;s bottled Magnet Pale Ale was selected for nationwide distribution across the group, and the takeover facilitated the wider distribution of Courage brands such as Tavern Keg.

The Tadcaster brewery was substantially redeveloped and expanded throughout 1974. Courage closed down the Barnsley brewery in 1976 with the loss of 200 jobs. Barnsley Bitter was replaced by John Smith&#x27;s bitter. Courage argued that modernisation of the Barnsley site would have required &quot;massive&quot; investment. It was reported in &quot;The Times&quot; that landlords were generally indifferent to the change, as the taste profiles of John Smith&#x27;s bitter and Barnsley bitter were similar.

After successful test marketing from 1974, John Smith&#x27;s Bitter was distributed in the South of England from 1979 onwards, accompanied by an extensive marketing budget. As research by Courage indicated that Southern drinkers considered Yorkshire bitter to be superior, the beer was sold there under the name John Smith&#x27;s Yorkshire Bitter. Sales of the beer doubled in 1981 owing to the increase in free trade outlets in the South stocking the beer. By 1982 it was the highest selling Courage brand and the highest selling canned bitter in the United Kingdom.

In 1982, the John Smith&#x27;s brands included Yorkshire Bitter, Magnet Pale Ale, Export Pale, Sweet Stout, Double Brown and Magnet Old. In December 1983, John Smith&#x27;s Cask (3.8% ABV) was re-introduced, seven years after it had been phased out. By June 1985, John Smith&#x27;s produced of beer annually. In November that year, a new brewhouse was opened, at the cost of £5 million. Production of Foster&#x27;s lager began in 1987.

In 1993, John Smith&#x27;s Extra Smooth was launched in cans. It was introduced in kegs in February 1995, and distributed to 10,000 pubs and venues. It is a nitrogenated version of the pasteurised beer, which was renamed to John Smith&#x27;s Original in order to differentiate the two products.

In 2005, Scottish &amp; Newcastle claimed that John Smith&#x27;s was available in 40,000 outlets across the United Kingdom. In 2007, Scottish &amp; Newcastle moved production of John Smith&#x27;s Cask from Tadcaster to Burtonwood near Warrington, and production of John Smith&#x27;s Magnet to Camerons Brewery of Hartlepool. In 2008 three limited edition beers were released to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the brewery. In 2010 Heineken discontinued production of cask conditioned John Smith&#x27;s Magnet, although it remains available in kegs. By 2011, production of John Smith&#x27;s Cask had moved to Cameron&#x27;s. As of 2012, John Smith&#x27;s is the sixth highest selling beer brand in the United Kingdom and the highest selling bitter in the world. From February 2013, John Smith&#x27;s Extra Smooth and Original were reduced from 3.8 to 3.6% ABV. According to Heineken, the decision was taken in order to bring the product in line with the strength of its major competitors such as Tetley, Boddingtons and Worthington.

== Beers ==
* John Smith&#x27;s Extra Smooth (3.6% ABV). The highest selling variant, available in kegs and cans. It is nitrogenated and pasteurised.
* John Smith&#x27;s Original (3.6% ABV). The same as Extra Smooth, but carbonated, rather than nitrogenated.
* John Smith&#x27;s Cask (3.8% ABV). Available nationwide, but most often found around the brewery&#x27;s Yorkshire heartland.
* John Smith&#x27;s Magnet (4% ABV). A keg product, most frequently found around the North East and Yorkshire.
* John Smiths Golden Ale (4% ABV). Available in a can only, a lightly hopped pale ale.

== Brewery ==

The brewery brews 3.8 million hectolitres annually (1.3 million of which is John Smith&#x27;s beer), and employed around 300 people in 2008. It has two keg lines, two bottle lines and one canning line. It currently brews and packages the ale brands John Smith&#x27;s Original, John Smith&#x27;s Extra Smooth and Newcastle Brown Ale, and the lager brands Foster&#x27;s, Kronenbourg 1664 (Kronenbourg is a Carlsberg-owned brand brewed under license by Heineken in the UK), Amstel and Tiger.

Slate Yorkshire Square brewing vessels were used at the brewery from 1913 until 1975. Stainless steel Yorkshire Squares were in use by at least 1953, but were removed in the 1980s, and the brewery now uses conical tanks. By 1953, the brewery site occupied 20 acres.

Wooden casks were still in use in the 1960s. The cask beer line was removed in 1976, but restored in 1984. A new canning line and a new brewhouse were installed around 1982.

In 1984 the original brewhouse was converted into a brewery museum. In November 1985 a new £5 million brewhouse opened. Production of Foster&#x27;s Lager began in 1987. By 1989 the brewery had a production capacity of 1.2 million barrels per annum. Scottish &amp; Newcastle used the John Smith&#x27;s Brewery to brew many of its ale brands. In 2004, a new £24 million bottling facility was opened in 2004, described as the most modern bottling facility in Europe.

== Advertising ==

The Magnet trademark was first registered in September 1908 in Brussels, and symbolised strength.

The company&#x27;s association with television advertising began in 1971 with the &quot;Yorkshiremen love it&quot; campaign.

An early campaign used a series of parodies of Jona Lewie&#x27;s &quot;Stop the Cavalry&quot; generally extolling &quot;yer mate called Smith.&quot;

This was followed by the &quot;Big John&quot; campaign, which ran in the North of England from 1981, and centred around a re-writing of the Big Bad John country music staple. Courage was able to demonstrate to an independent panel that the £300,000 campaign had resulted in a £5 million sales increase in the North.

From 1979 to 1986 Gordon Rollings played the dour Yorkshireman Arkwright in a campaign that was only used in the South. The campaign won a large number of advertising industry awards, and was featured on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. After Rollings died in 1986 the campaign was continued with Arkwright&#x27;s successor, Barraclough, until 1991. Despite its success, the campaign was not without detractors, with Deyan Sudjic describing it in &quot;The Times&quot; as a &quot;spurious ... tripe-and-whippets campaign&quot;.

=== No Nonsense campaigns ===
From 1992 until 1997, comedian Jack Dee starred in the &quot;No Nonsense&quot; campaign, created by DDB. The Dee campaign was widely credited with helping John Smith&#x27;s rise from sixteenth to fourth highest selling beer in the UK as sales increased by 65 per cent, and the brand overtook Tetley&#x27;s as the highest selling ale brand in the world by 1995. The Dee campaign won fifty advertising awards, and helped to turn the rising comedian into a household name.

Dee resigned in 1997, and he was replaced in 1998 with a cardboard cut-out known as the &quot;No Nonsense Man&quot;, from the GGT advertising agency. Despite appearing in over 20,000 pubs, clubs and shops, No Nonsense Man was found to have less of an impact than the Dee advertisements.

Peter Kay represented the brand from 2002 to 2005 and again in 2010–11. The Kay campaign was described as an &quot;advertising phenomenon&quot;, and introduced the phrase &quot;Ave it!&quot; into the public consciousness. Between 2002 and 2004 the Kay advertisements won over fifty advertising and marketing awards, making it the sixth most awarded advertising campaign in the world. Despite the success of the Kay campaign, the perceived &quot;laddishness&quot; of the advertisements were criticised by rival brewer Interbrew as hindering sales of beer among women.

=== Sponsorship ===

John Smith&#x27;s is a major sponsor of horse racing in the United Kingdom. It has sponsored the Northumberland Plate since 2003, and more than 90 &quot;No Nonsense&quot; race days are held throughout the year at 28 jump and flat racecourses across the UK. The brand has sponsored the John Smith&#x27;s Cup (originally the Magnet Cup until 1998) at York since 1960, which is the longest running sponsorship in flat racing in the world. John Smith&#x27;s previously sponsored the Grand National between 2005 and 2013.

In August 2012 John Smith&#x27;s announced a five-year sponsorship of the Kirklees Stadium in Huddersfield, home to football team Huddersfield Town and rugby league team Huddersfield Giants, which was renamed &quot;John Smith&#x27;s Stadium&quot;. In December 2016, this deal was extended for a further five years.

<text>In astronomy and celestial navigation, an ephemeris (; ; , ) is a book with tables that gives the trajectory of naturally occurring astronomical objects and artificial satellites in the sky, i.e., the position (and possibly velocity) over time. Historically, positions were given as printed tables of values, given at regular intervals of date and time. The calculation of these tables was one of the first applications of mechanical computers. Modern ephemerides are often provided in electronic form. However, printed ephemerides are still produced, as they are useful when computational devices are not available.

The astronomical position calculated from an ephemeris is often given in the spherical polar coordinate system of right ascension and declination, together with the distance from the origin if applicable. Some of the astronomical phenomena of interest to astronomers are eclipses, apparent retrograde motion/planetary stations, planetary es, sidereal time, positions for the mean and true nodes of the moon, the phases of the Moon, and the positions of minor celestial bodies such as Chiron.

Ephemerides are used in celestial navigation and astronomy. They are also used by astrologers. GPS signals include ephemeris data used to calculate the position of satellites in orbit.

== History ==


*1st millennium BC – Ephemerides in Babylonian astronomy.
*2nd century AD – the &quot;Almagest&quot; and the &quot;Handy Tables&quot; of Ptolemy
*8th century AD – the &quot; of Ibrāhīm al-Fazārī
*9th century AD – the &quot; of Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī
*11th century AD – the &quot;&quot; of Ibn Yunus
*12th century AD – the &quot;Tables of Toledo&quot; – based largely on Arabic &quot;&quot; sources of Islamic astronomy – were edited by Gerard of Cremona to form the standard European ephemeris until the &quot;Alfonsine Tables&quot;.
*13th century AD – the &quot;Zīj-i Īlkhānī&quot; (&quot;Ilkhanic Tables&quot;) were compiled at the Maragheh observatory in Persia.
*13th century AD – the &quot;Alfonsine Tables&quot; were compiled in Spain to correct anomalies in the &quot;Tables of Toledo&quot;, remaining the standard European ephemeris until the &quot;Prutenic Tables&quot; almost 300 years later.
*13th century AD - the &quot;Dresden Codex&quot;, an extant Mayan ephemeris
*1408 – Chinese ephemeris table (copy in Pepysian Library, Cambridge, UK (refer book &#x27;1434&#x27;); Chinese tables believed known to Regiomontanus).
*1474 – Regiomontanus publishes his day-to-day Ephemerides in Nürnberg, Germany. 
*1496 – the &quot;Almanach Perpetuum&quot; of Abraão ben Samuel Zacuto (one of the first books published with a movable type and printing press in Portugal)
*1504 – While shipwrecked on the island of Jamaica, Christopher Columbus successfully predicted a lunar eclipse for the natives, using the ephemeris of the German astronomer Regiomontanus.
*1531 – Work of Johannes Stöffler is published posthumously at Tübingen, extending the ephemeris of Regiomontanus through 1551.
*1551 – the &quot;Prutenic Tables&quot; of Erasmus Reinhold were published, based on Copernicus&#x27;s theories.
*1554 – Johannes Stadius published &quot;Ephemerides novae et auctae&quot;, the first major ephemeris computed according to Copernicus&#x27; heliocentric model, using parameters derived from the &quot;Prutenic Tables&quot;. Although the Copernican model provided an elegant solution to the problem of computing apparent planetary positions (it avoided the need for the equant and better explained the apparent retrograde motion of planets), it still relied on the use of epicycles, leading to some inaccuracies – for example, periodic errors in the position of Mercury of up to ten degrees. One of the users of Stadius&#x27;s tables is Tycho Brahe.
*1627 – the &quot;Rudolphine Tables&quot; of Johannes Kepler based on elliptical planetary motion became the new standard.
*1679 – &quot;La Connaissance des Temps ou calendrier et éphémérides du lever &amp; coucher du Soleil, de la Lune &amp; des autres planètes&quot;, first published yearly by Jean Picard and still extant.
*1975 – Owen Gingerich, using modern planetary theory and digital computers, calculates the actual positions of the planets in the 16th century and graphs the errors in the planetary positions predicted by the ephemerides of Stöffler, Stadius and others. According to Gingerich, the error patterns &quot;are as distinctive as fingerprints and reflect the characteristics of the underlying tables. That is, the error patterns for Stöffler are different from those of Stadius, but the error patterns of Stadius closely resemble those of Maestlin, Magini, Origanus, and others who followed the Copernican parameters.&quot;

== Modern ephemeris ==
For scientific uses, a modern planetary ephemeris comprises software that generates positions of planets and often of their satellites, asteroids, or comets, at virtually any time desired by the user.

After introduction of electronic computers in the 1950s it became feasible to use numerical integration to compute ephemerides. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory Development Ephemeris is a prime example. Conventional so-called analytical ephemerides that utilize series expansions for the coordinates have also been developed, but of much increased size and accuracy as compared to the past, by making use of computers to manage the tens of thousands of terms. Ephemeride Lunaire Parisienne and VSOP are examples.

Typically, such ephemerides cover several centuries, past and future; the future ones can be covered because the field of celestial mechanics has developed several accurate theories. Nevertheless, there are secular phenomena which cannot adequately be considered by ephemerides. The greatest uncertainties in the positions of planets are caused by the perturbations of numerous asteroids, most of whose masses and orbits are poorly known, rendering their effect uncertain. Reflecting the continuing influx of new data and observations, NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) has revised its published ephemerides nearly every year since 1981.

Solar System ephemerides are essential for the navigation of spacecraft and for all kinds of space observations of the planets, their natural satellites, stars, and galaxies.

Scientific ephemerides for sky observers mostly contain the positions of celestial bodies in right ascension and declination, because these coordinates are the most frequently used on star maps and telescopes. The equinox of the coordinate system must be given. It is, in nearly all cases, either the actual equinox (the equinox valid for that moment, often referred to as &quot;of date&quot; or &quot;current&quot;), or that of one of the &quot;standard&quot; equinoxes, typically J2000.0, B1950.0, or J1900. Star maps almost always use one of the standard equinoxes.

Scientific ephemerides often contain further useful data about the moon, planet, asteroid, or comet beyond the pure coordinates in the sky, such as elongation to the Sun, brightness, distance, velocity, apparent diameter in the sky, phase angle, times of rise, transit, and set, etc.
Ephemerides of the planet Saturn also sometimes contain the apparent inclination of its ring.

Celestial navigation serves as a backup to satellite navigation. Software is widely available to assist with this form of navigation; some of this software has a self-contained ephemeris. When software is used that does not contain an ephemeris, or if no software is used, position data for celestial objects may be obtained from the modern &quot;Nautical Almanac&quot; or &quot;Air Almanac&quot;.

An ephemeris is usually only correct for a particular location on the Earth. In many cases, the differences are too small to matter. However, for nearby asteroids or the Moon, they can be quite important.

Other modern ephemerides recently created are the EPM (Ephemerides of Planets and the Moon), from the Russian Institute for Applied Astronomy of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the INPOP (&quot;&quot;) by the French IMCCE.

<doc id="160333" wikidata="Q375249" url="?curid=160333" title="My Generation (album)">
<text>My Generation is the debut studio album by English rock band the Who, released on 3 December 1965 by Brunswick Records in the United Kingdom, and Festival Records in Australia. In the United States, it was released on 25 April 1966 by Decca Records as The Who Sings My Generation, with a different cover and a slightly altered track listing. Besides the members of the Who, being Roger Daltrey (vocals), Pete Townshend (guitar), John Entwistle (bass) and Keith Moon (drums), the album features contributions by session musician Nicky Hopkins (piano).

The album was made immediately after the Who got their first singles on the charts and, according to the booklet in the Deluxe Edition, it was later dismissed by the band as something of a rush job that did not accurately represent their stage performance of the time. While it didn&#x27;t sell as well as later albums, peaking at No. 5 on the UK charts and failing to chart in the US, critics have since retrospectively rated it as one of the best rock albums of all time, especially noting its hard sound unusual for the time, and presaging various hard rock styles such as punk and heavy metal.

==Recording and songs==
By 1965, the Who were all set after recruiting drummer Keith Moon, and saw their former band name change from the Detours to the Who, after briefly being called the High Numbers. In the spring of 1965, the album was started during the Who&#x27;s early &quot;Maximum R&amp;B&quot; period and features cover versions of the popular R&amp;B songs &quot;I Don&#x27;t Mind&quot; and &quot;Please, Please, Please&quot;, both originally by James Brown, in addition to the R&amp;B leanings of the tracks written by the band&#x27;s guitarist Pete Townshend. Nine tracks were recorded, but several of them were rejected for Townshend originals made at new sessions that began in October.

According to the booklet in the Deluxe Edition, &quot;I&#x27;m a Man&quot; was eliminated from the US release due to its sexual content. The US album also used the edited UK single version of &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot;, which cut a brief instrumental section laden with manic drum rolls and guitar feedback before the final verse.

Many of the songs on the album saw release as singles. Aside from &quot;My Generation&quot;, which preceded the album&#x27;s release and reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart, &quot;A Legal Matter&quot;, &quot;La-La-La Lies&quot;, and &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot; were also released as domestic singles by Brunswick after the band had started releasing new material on the Reaction label in 1966. As they were not promoted by the band, they were not as commercially successful as &quot;My Generation&quot; or the Reaction singles. &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot; was however a top 10 single in Sweden, peaking at No. 8.

&quot;My Generation&quot; and &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot; in particular remain two of the group&#x27;s most-covered songs; while &quot;My Generation&quot; is a raw, aggressive number that presaged the heavy metal and punk rock movements, &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot; is a more sophisticated pop number, with chiming guitars, three-part harmonies, and a lilting vocal melody, though still retaining the driving rhythm of other Who songs of the period. The album is considered an important forerunner of the &quot;power pop&quot; movement. &quot;Circles&quot; was notably covered by contemporaries of the group, British freakbeat outfit Les Fleur de Lys. The cover version has found some notice after its inclusion on &quot;Nuggets II: Original Artyfacts from the British Empire and Beyond, 1964–1969&quot;.

==Release history==
The UK release featured a cover image of the band standing beside some oil drums and looking upward to the camera, with splashes of colour added by the red and blue stencilled letters of the title and a jacket patterned after the Union Flag thrown over John Entwistle&#x27;s shoulders. Pete Townshend was wearing his school scarf. For the US release, this was replaced with a portrait of the band standing beneath Big Ben.

In 1974, &quot;The Who Sings My Generation&quot; was re-issued by MCA Records in the US and Canada as part of a budget-priced double album set which also included the 1968 compilation album &quot;Magic Bus: The Who on Tour&quot;. The reissue peaked at No. 185 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

The UK mono album was briefly reissued in Britain in 1979 by Virgin Records, during the height of the country&#x27;s Mod revival. The bands of that scene owed a direct debt to the Who for inspiration, and the younger generations of their fans were keen to explore those original influences. This pressing of the album went out of print in 1980, meaning there was no official UK edition of &quot;My Generation&quot; again available until the Deluxe Edition of 2002.

In 2002, the album was remixed into stereo and remastered for a Deluxe Edition by Shel Talmy. This was the first time any of these songs had seen a stereo release. While sounding clearer in stereo, this edition omits many overdubs that are prominent in the original mono mixes, notably the lead guitar parts in &quot;A Legal Matter&quot; and &quot;My Generation&quot; (though both songs in their mono mixes close disc 2) and the double-tracked vocals in &quot;The Good&#x27;s Gone&quot;, &quot;Much Too Much&quot;, &quot;La-La-La Lies&quot; and &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot;.

In 2008, the album&#x27;s original UK mono mix was remastered for the Japanese market, appearing in limited numbers as a double-CD box set and a regular single CD album. Both variations included bonus tracks recorded in 1965. The stereo mixes were taken from the 2002 Deluxe Edition release.

In 2012, the album was released using a flat transfer from the original master tapes (for the mono disc) and released in Japan in 2012 as part of a two-disc mono and stereo set with bonus tracks. In the same year, &quot;My Generation&quot; was released in mono in the UK as a single disc without bonus tracks, using newer generation tapes several times removed from the original master tape.

In 2014, &quot;My Generation&quot; was released on iTunes and HDtracks in mono and stereo versions with bonus tracks. The mono version was mastered from the same source as the 2012 Japanese release. The stereo version has mixes different from those on the 2002 Deluxe Edition release.

On 18 November 2016, Brunswick/Polydor Europe released a 5-CD deluxe edition that includes most previous versions of this complicated product in one collection (Brunswick – 5372740, Polydor – 5372740, UMC – 5372740). The set consists of Disc 1: The Original Mono Mixes; Disc 2: The Stereo Mixes; Disc 3: The Original Mono Mixes – Bonus Tracks; Disc 4: The Original Stereo Mixes – Bonus Tracks; Disc 5: Primal Scoop – The 1964–1965 Demo Mixes.

== Reception and legacy ==

In his 1967 column for &quot;Esquire&quot;, music critic Robert Christgau called &quot;My Generation&quot; &quot;the hardest rock in history&quot;. In 1981, he included its American version in his &quot;basic record library&quot;. Richie Unterberger hailed the album as &quot;the hardest mod pop&quot; ever recorded in a retrospective review for AllMusic: &quot;At the time of its release, it also had the most ferociously powerful guitars and drums yet captured on a rock record.&quot; Mark Kemp wrote of the record in &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004):

The American edition of the album was included in &quot;A Basic Record Library&quot; of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981). In 2000, musician Elvis Costello named the album one of his &quot;500 [favorite] albums that can only improve your life&quot; and &quot;better than everything that I&#x27;ve made&quot;. In 2003, &quot;My Generation&quot; was ranked number 236 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, then was re-ranked number 237 on the 2012 revised list, and named the second greatest guitar album of all time by &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine. In 2004, it was No. 18 in &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 50 Best British Albums Ever. In 2006, it was ranked No. 49 in &quot;NME&quot;&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest British Albums. In 2004, the title track was No. 11 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest songs of all time. In 2006, &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot; was No. 34 in Pitchfork&#x27;s list of the 200 greatest songs of the 1960s. In June 2009, the edited 1966 US version of the album &quot;The Who Sings My Generation&quot; was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being &quot;Culturally, historically and aesthetically significant&quot;. Writing for the BBC, Chris Jones described the album as &quot;one of the most vital and important reasons to love rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;.

<text>Most horoscopic traditions of astrology systems divide the horoscope into a number (usually twelve) of houses whose positions depend on time and location rather than on date. The houses of the horoscope represent different fields of experience wherein the energies of the signs and planets operate—described in terms of physical surroundings as well as personal life experiences.

==Background==


In astrology, houses are a fundamental component of the birth chart that represent different areas of life. There are 12 houses, each associated with a specific zodiac sign and planetary ruler. The 12 houses in Western astrology represent distinct areas of life experience, shaping how planetary energies manifest in an individual’s natal chart. Each house reflects a unique aspect of existence, from personal identity to relationships, career, and spirituality. The interpretation of the houses can vary based on different astrological traditions, psychological frameworks, and philosophical approaches.

The houses are divisions of the ecliptic plane (a great circle containing the Sun&#x27;s orbit, as seen from the earth), at the time and place of the horoscope in question. They are numbered counter-clockwise from the cusp of the first house. Commonly, houses one through six are below the horizon and houses seven through twelve are above the horizon, but some systems may not respect entirely that division (in particular when the Ascendant does not coincide with the first house&#x27;s cusp).

Every house system is dependent on the rotational movement of Earth on its axis, but there is a wide range of approaches to calculating house divisions and different opinions among astrologers over which house system is most accurate. To calculate the houses, it is necessary to know the exact time, date, and location. The several methods of calculating house divisions stem from disagreement over what they mean mathematically (regarding space and time). All house systems in Western astrology use twelve houses projected on the ecliptic. The differences arise from which fundamental plane is the object of the initial division and whether the divisions represent units of time, or degrees of distance.

If space is the basis for house division, the chosen plane is divided into equal arcs of 30° each. A difference will be made as to whether these divisions are made directly on the ecliptic, or on the celestial equator or some other great circle, before being projected on the ecliptic.

If time is the basis for house division, a difference must be made for whether the houses are based on invariant equal hours (each house represents 2 hours of the sun&#x27;s apparent movement each day) or temporal hours (daytime and night-time divided into six equal parts, but here the temporal hours will vary according to season and latitude.)

Regardless of these different methods, all house divisions in Western astrology share certain things in common: the twelve house cusps are always projected on the ecliptic; they will all place the cusp of the first house near the eastern horizon and every house cusp is 180° of longitude apart from the sixth following house (1st opposes 7th; 2nd opposes 8th and so on).

==Qualities==

The table to the right represents the basic outline of the houses as they are still understood today and includes the traditional Latin names. The houses are numbered from the east downward under the horizon, each representing a specific area of life. Many modern astrologers assume that the houses relate to their corresponding signs, i.e. that the first house has a natural affinity with the first sign, Aries, and so on.

===First House (House of Self)===
The First House governs self-identity, physical appearance, and the persona—the outward expression of one’s inner world. Liz Greene views this house as representing the mask we wear to navigate external life while concealing deeper psychological realities. Deborah Houlding emphasizes its traditional role as the foundation of vitality and character, where the ascendant sign influences temperament and health. Dane Rudhyar describes it as the emergence of consciousness, symbolizing the individual’s first interaction with the external world. Stephen Arroyo sees it as the lens through which we approach life’s challenges, reflecting our initial reactions and self-image.

===Second House (House of Value)===
The Second House relates to personal resources, material possessions, and self-worth. Greene highlights how this house reflects the internalized value system that shapes not just finances but emotional security. Houlding explains its traditional association with wealth and livelihood, focusing on how possessions contribute to stability. Rudhyar interprets the Second House as the process of building personal foundations, emphasizing the individual&#x27;s relationship with the material world. Arroyo simplifies it as the house of self-sufficiency, showing how one&#x27;s attitude toward money and possessions reflects broader psychological patterns.

===Third House (House of Communication)===
The Third House governs communication, learning, and relationships with immediate surroundings. Greene emphasizes the development of cognitive skills and how early interactions shape mental patterns. Houlding focuses on its traditional role in local travel, siblings, and the sharing of ideas within communities. Rudhyar views this house as the emergence of the thinking mind, reflecting curiosity and the desire to connect through knowledge. Arroyo describes it as the house of everyday learning and practical communication, governing both casual conversations and intellectual exploration.

===Fourth House (House of Home and Family)===
The Fourth House represents home, family, and the emotional roots that provide stability. Greene sees this house as the foundation of the inner self, where unconscious family patterns and childhood experiences shape adult life. Houlding highlights its traditional role as the house of ancestry and heritage, reflecting physical property and familial lineage. Rudhyar interprets it as the inner sanctuary where personal identity is nurtured away from the public eye. Arroyo focuses on the emotional security found in home life and how family relationships influence psychological well-being.

===Fifth House (House of Pleasure)===
The Fifth House governs creativity, romance, and self-expression. Greene views this house as the arena for authentic expression, where individuals explore their unique identity through love, art, and play. Houlding emphasizes its traditional association with children, entertainment, and gambling, focusing on risk and pleasure. Rudhyar describes it as the creative impulse that drives individuals to leave a personal mark on the world. Arroyo interprets it as the house of personal fulfillment, where joy, passion, and artistic pursuits thrive.

===Sixth House (House of Health and Service)===
The Sixth House relates to health, daily routines, and service to others. Greene highlights this house as the space where individuals balance personal needs with responsibility, integrating work and health into a cohesive routine. Houlding notes its traditional role in governing illness, servitude, and labor, focusing on the obligations that structure daily life. Rudhyar interprets it as the process of self-improvement through discipline and attention to detail. Arroyo views it as the house of practicality, emphasizing wellness, work habits, and self-care.

===Seventh House (House of Partnerships)===
The Seventh House governs relationships, including marriage, business partnerships, and legal contracts. Greene describes it as the mirror of the self, reflecting the qualities we seek—and often project—onto others in close relationships. Houlding emphasizes its traditional role in governing alliances and open enemies, highlighting the balance between cooperation and conflict. Rudhyar sees it as the point where personal identity meets the &quot;Other,&quot; symbolizing the evolution of self through meaningful connections. Arroyo interprets it as the house of committed partnerships, emphasizing harmony, negotiation, and balance.

===Eighth House (House of Transformation)===
The Eighth House is associated with transformation, shared resources, and intimacy. Greene delves into its role in deep psychological transformation, where themes of power, control, and emotional vulnerability surface. Houlding connects it to traditional topics like inheritance, death, and joint finances, emphasizing the merging of resources and identities. Rudhyar interprets it as the house of regeneration, where crisis and rebirth lead to profound growth. Arroyo sees it as a space for emotional depth and intimacy, focusing on the transformative power of close bonds.

===Ninth House (House of Philosophy and Travel)===
The Ninth House represents higher education, philosophy, and long-distance travel. Greene highlights the house as the realm of the search for meaning, where individuals explore spirituality, culture, and belief systems. Houlding focuses on its traditional role in religion, law, and foreign affairs, emphasizing the expansion of one’s worldview. Rudhyar views it as the stage of intellectual and spiritual exploration, where personal experience broadens into universal understanding. Arroyo interprets it as the house of personal growth through exploration, whether intellectual or physical.

===Tenth House (House of Career and Public Life)===
The Tenth House governs career, public reputation, and social status. Greene interprets it as the house of external achievement, where societal roles and ambitions are pursued to fulfill personal destiny. Houlding highlights its traditional role in representing authority figures and social standing, often linked to one’s professional path. Rudhyar sees it as the culmination of personal development expressed in the public sphere, representing the manifestation of one’s life purpose. Arroyo focuses on career aspirations and the drive for success and recognition in the wider world.

===Eleventh House (House of Friendships and Community)===
The Eleventh House governs friendships, social networks, and community involvement. Greene describes it as the sphere where individuals pursue collective ideals and engage in group dynamics to realize shared visions. Houlding connects it to traditional associations with hopes, wishes, and alliances, highlighting the importance of social connection. Rudhyar interprets it as the house of future-oriented aspirations and participation in collective movements. Arroyo views it as the space where collaboration and innovation flourish, emphasizing the role of community in personal development.

===Twelfth House (House of the Subconscious)===
The Twelfth House represents the subconscious, spirituality, and hidden aspects of life. Greene emphasizes its role in psychological integration, where unconscious fears and desires are confronted through solitude and introspection. Houlding highlights its traditional association with isolation, secrecy, and institutions like hospitals and monasteries. Rudhyar sees it as the space of transcendence and dissolution, where the ego dissolves into the greater whole. Arroyo interprets it as the house of spiritual growth and introspection, focusing on inner healing and connection to the collective unconscious.

==House modalities and triplicities==
Similarly to how signs are classified according to astrological modality (Cardinal, Fixed and Mutable), houses are classified as Angular, Succedent and Cadent.
Angular houses are points of initiation and represent action; they relate to cardinal signs (Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricorn). Succedent houses are points of purpose and represent stabilization; they relate to fixed signs (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio and Aquarius). Cadent houses are points of transition and represent change and adaptation; they relate to mutable signs (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius and Pisces).

Following the classification of signs by the four classical elements (Fire, Earth, Air and Water), houses can also be grouped together in triplicities, related to a level of experience.

In old astrological writings (e.g. William Lilly), &quot;house&quot; could also be used as a synonym for domicile or rulership, as in the sentence &quot;The Moon has its house in Cancer&quot; meaning that Cancer is ruled by the Moon. It may be helpful to think of a ruling planet, in this case the Moon, as the &quot;owner of the 4th House&quot;, and the sign, &quot;e.g.&quot; Cancer, as the CEO or landlord who runs the house. In an individual horoscope, whatever planet occupies any given house can be thought of as the house&#x27;s tenant. (See Rulership section below.)

==Systems of house division==
There are many systems of house division. In most, the ecliptic is divided into houses and the ascendant (eastern horizon) marks the cusp, or beginning, of the first house, and the descendant (western horizon) marks the cusp of the seventh house. Many systems, called quadrant house systems, also use the midheaven (&quot;medium coeli&quot;) as the cusp of the tenth house.

Goals for a house system include ease of computation; agreement with the &quot;quadrant&quot; concept (ascendant on the first house cusp and midheaven on the tenth); defined and meaningful behaviour in the polar regions; acceptable handling of heavenly bodies of high latitude (a distinct problem from high-latitude locations on the Earth&#x27;s surface); and symbolic value. It is impossible for any system to satisfy all the criteria completely, so each one represents a different compromise. The extremely popular Placidus and Koch systems, in particular, can generate undefined results in the polar circles. Research and debate on the merits of different house systems is ongoing.

===Early forms of house division===
The Babylonians may have been the first to set out the concept of house division. Specifically, they timed the birth according to three systems of time division: (a) a three-part division of the night into watches, (b) a four-part division of the nychthemeron with respect to sunrise and sunset, and (c) a twelve-part division of the day-time into hours. Babylonian astronomers studied the rising times of the signs and calculated tables of ascensions for their latitude, but it would take better time measurements by the Egyptians and the introduction of the concept of ascendant, around the 2nd century BC, to give astrological houses their first recognisable structure and meaning, from the perspective of Classical Western astrology.

====Whole sign====

In the whole sign house system, sometimes referred to as the &#x27;Sign-House system&#x27;, the houses are 30° each. The ascendant designates the rising sign, and the first house begins at zero degrees of the zodiac sign in which the ascendant falls, regardless of how early or late in that sign the ascendant is. The next sign after the ascending sign then becomes the 2nd house, the sign after that the 3rd house, and so on. In other words, each house is wholly filled by one sign. This was the main system used in the Hellenistic tradition of astrology, and is also used in Indian astrology, as well as in some early traditions of Medieval astrology. It is thought to be the oldest system of house division.

The Whole Sign system may have been developed in the Hellenistic tradition of astrology sometime around the 1st or 2nd century BCE, and from there it may have passed to the Indian and early Medieval traditions of astrology; though the line of thought which states that it was transmitted to India from Western locales is hotly contested. At some point in the Medieval period, probably around the 10th century, whole sign houses fell into disuse in the western tradition, and by the 20th century the system was completely unknown in the western astrological community, although was continually used in India all the way into the present time. Beginning in the 1980s and 1990s the system was rediscovered and reintroduced into western astrology.

The distinction between equal houses and whole sign houses lies in the fact that in whole sign houses the cusp of the 1st house is the beginning of the sign that contains the ascendant, while in equal houses the degree of the ascendant is itself the cusp of the 1st house.

====Equal house====
In the equal house system the ecliptic is also divided into twelve divisions of 30 degrees, although the houses are measured out in 30 degree increments starting from the degree of the ascendant. It begins with the ascendant, which acts as the &#x27;cusp&#x27; or starting point of the 1st house, then the second house begins exactly 30 degrees later in zodiacal order, then the third house begins exactly 30 degrees later in zodiacal order from the 2nd house, and so on. Proponents of the equal house system claim that it is more accurate and less distorting in higher latitudes (especially above 60 degrees) than the Placidean and other quadrant house systems.

===Space-based house systems===
In this type of system, the definition of houses involves the division of the sphere into twelve equal lunes perpendicular to a fundamental plane (the Morinus and Regiomontanus systems being two notable exceptions).

====M-House (Equal Mc)====
This system is constructed in a similar manner as the Equal house, but houses are measured out in 30 degree increments starting from the longitude of the midheaven (Mc), which acts as the &#x27;cusp&#x27; or starting point of the 10th house. The ascendant does not coincide with the cusp for the 1st house.

====Porphyry====
Each quadrant of the ecliptic is divided into three equal parts between the four angles. This is the oldest system of &quot;quadrant&quot; style house division. Although it is attributed to Porphyry of Tyros, this system was first described by the 2nd-century astrologer Vettius Valens, in the 3rd book of his astrological compendium known as &quot;The Anthology&quot;. Martin Gansten argues that in Valens, houses were often provisionally approximated by sign position alone, but calculation of places by degree was consistently upheld in principle as more accurate and useful.

====Carter&#x27;s Poly Equatorial====
This house system was described by the English astrologer Charles E. O. Carter (1887–1968) in his &quot;Essays on the Foundations of Astrology&quot;. The house division starts at the right ascension of the ascendant and to it is added 30º of right ascension for each successive cusp. Those cusps are then restated in terms of celestial longitude by projecting them along great circles containing the North and South celestial poles. The 1st house cusp coincides with the ascendant&#x27;s longitude, but the 10th house cusp is not identical with the Midheaven.

====Meridian====
Also known as the Axial system, or Equatorial system, it divides the celestial equator in twelve 30° sectors (starting at the local meridian) and projects them on to the ecliptic along the great circles containing the North and South celestial poles. The intersections of the ecliptic with those great circles provide the house cusps. The 10th house cusp thus equals the Midheaven, but the East Point (also known as Equatorial Ascendant) is now the first house&#x27;s cusp. Each house is exactly 2 sidereal hours long. This system was proposed by the Australian astrologer David Cope in the beginning of the 20th century and has become the most popular system with the Uranian school of astrology. The Ascendant (intersection between the ecliptic and the horizon) preserves its importance in chart interpretation through sign and aspects, but not as a house determinant, which is why this house system can be used in any latitude.
a
====Regiomontanus====
The celestial equator is divided into twelve, and these divisions are projected on to the ecliptic along great circles that take in the north and south points on the horizon. Named after the German astronomer and astrologer Johann Müller of Königsberg, the Regiomontanus system was later largely replaced by the Placidus system.

====Campanus====
The prime vertical (the great circle taking in the zenith and east point on the horizon) is divided into twelve, and these divisions are projected on to the ecliptic along great circles that take in the north and south points on the horizon. It is attributed to Campanus of Novara but the method is known to have been used before his time.

====Sinusoidal====
Sinusoidal systems of house division are similar to Porphyry houses except that instead of each quadrant being divided into three equal sized houses, the middle house in each quadrant is compressed or expanded based on whether the quadrant covers less than or greater than 90 degrees. In other words, houses are smooth around the zodiac with the difference or ratio in quadrant sizes being spread in a continuous sinusoidal manner from expanded to compressed houses. Sinusoidal houses were invented and first published by Walter Pullen in his astrology program Astrolog in 1994.

===Time-based house systems===

====Alchabitius====
The predecessor system to the Placidus, which largely replaced the Porphyry. The difference with Placidus is that the time that it takes the ascendant to reach the meridian is divided equally into three parts. The Alchabitius house system was very popular in Europe before the introduction of the Regiomontanus system.

====Placidus====
This is the most commonly used house system in modern Western astrology. The paths drawn for each degree of the ecliptic to move from the Imum coeli to the horizon, and from the horizon to the midheaven, are trisected to determine the cusps of houses 2, 3, 11, and 12. The cusps of houses 8, 9, 5 and 6 are opposite these. The Placidus system is sometimes not defined beyond polar circles (latitudes greater than 66°N or 66°S), because certain degrees are &quot;circumpolar&quot; (never touch the horizon), and planets falling in them cannot be assigned to houses without extending the system. This result is a weakness of the Placidean system according to its critics, who often cite the exceptional house proportions in the higher latitudes.

Named for 17th-century astrologer Placidus de Titis, it is thought the Placidus system was first mentioned about 13th century in Arab literature, but the first confirmed publication was in 1602 by Giovanni Antonio Magini (1555–1617) in his book &quot;Tabulae Primi Mobilis, quas Directionem Vulgo Dicunt&quot;. The first documented usage is from Czech, 1627.

====Koch====
A rather more complicated version of the Placidus system, built on equal increments of Right Ascension for each quadrant. The Koch system was developed by the German astrologer Walter Koch (1895–1970) and is defined only for latitudes between 66°N and 66°S. This system is popular among research astrologers in the U.S. and among German speakers, but in Central Europe lost some popularity to the Krusiński house system.

====Topocentric====
This is a recent system, invented in Argentina, that its creators claim has been determined empirically, i.e. by observing events in people&#x27;s lives and assessing the geometry of a house system that would fit. The house cusps are always within a degree of those given in the Placidus system. The topocentric system can also be described as an approximation algorithm for the Placidus system. Topocentric houses are also called Polich-Page, after the names of the house system creators, Wendel Polich and A. Page Nelson.

===Chart gallery===
The following charts display different house systems for the same time and location. To better compare systems subject to distortion, a high latitude city was chosen (Stockholm, Sweden) and the time corresponds to a long ascension sign (Cancer). For clarity purposes, all the usual aspect lines, degrees and glyphs were removed.

===The MC in non-quadrant house systems===
In the whole sign and equal house systems the Medium Coeli (Midheaven), the highest point in the chart, does not act as the cusp or starting point of the 10th house. Instead the MC moves around the top half of the chart, and can land anywhere in the 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, depending on the latitude. The MC retains its commonly agreed significations, but it does not act as the starting point of the 10th house, whereas the Equal house system adds extra definition and meaning to the MC including any cusps involved, any interpretations applied to the MC itself concur with other house systems.

This is also the more common criticism of the whole sign and equal house method as it concerns the location of the Medium Coeli (Midheaven), the highest point in the chart. In the equal house system, the ascendant/descendant and midheaven/IC axes can vary from being perpendicular to each other (from approx. +-5 deg at most at equator to approx. +-15 degrees at Alexandria to +-90 degrees at polar circle). As a result, equal houses counted from the ascendant cannot in general place the midheaven on the tenth house cusp, where many feel it would be symbolically desirable. Since this point is associated with ambition, career, and public image, the argument is that the Midheaven, therefore, must be the cusp of the similar tenth house. It has also been linked by extension with Capricorn (the tenth sign of the zodiac). The equal house system always takes the MC to be first and foremost THE most important indicator of career; whereas the 10th house cusp, while taken into account, is interpreted simply as a weaker 2nd MC cusp. The Midheaven is not associated with house locations defined by the Whole Sign and Equal House system, rather, the Midheaven placement relies on the specific location of the Ascendant, so the Midheaven can be found anywhere between the 8th and 11th houses.

== Rulership ==
In Hellenistic, Vedic, Medieval and Renaissance astrology each house is ruled by the planet that rules the sign on its cusp. For example, if a person has the sign Aries on the cusp of their 7th house, the planet Mars is said to &quot;rule&quot; the 7th house. This means that when a planet is allotted a house, the planet&#x27;s attributes will have some bearing on the topics related to that house within the life of the individual whose chart is being analyzed. This planet is considered very important for events specifically pertaining to that house&#x27;s topics; in fact, its placement in the chart will have at least as much influence on the chart as the planets placed within the house. In traditional Western and Hindu astrology, each sign is ruled by one of the 7 visible planets (note that in astrology, the Sun and Moon are considered planets, which literally means &quot;wanderers&quot;, i.e. wandering stars, as opposed to the fixed stars of the constellations).

In addition, some modern astrologers who follow the X=Y=Z or Planet=Sign=House doctrine, which was first taught by Alan Leo in the early part of the 20th century, believe that certain houses are also ruled by—or have an affinity with—the planet which rules the corresponding zodiacal sign. For instance, Mars is ruler of the 1st house because it rules Aries, the first sign; Mercury rules (or has an affinity with) the 3rd house because it rules Gemini, the 3rd sign; etc. This concept is sometimes referred to as &quot;natural rulership&quot;, as opposed to the former which is known as &quot;accidental rulership&quot;.

<text>Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton is the major West Coast base of the United States Marine Corps and is one of the largest Marine Corps bases in the United States. It is on the Southern California coast in San Diego County and is bordered by Oceanside to the south, San Clemente in Orange County to the north, Riverside County to the northeast, and Fallbrook to the east.

The base was established in 1942 to train U.S. Marines for service in World War II. By October 1944, Camp Pendleton was declared a &quot;permanent installation,&quot; and by 1946 it became the home of the 1st Marine Division. It was named after Major General Joseph Henry Pendleton (1860–1942), who had long advocated setting up a training base for the Marine Corps on the West Coast. Today it is home to myriad Operating Force units, including the I Marine Expeditionary Force and various training commands.

==History==
===Prior to World War II===
In 1769, a Spanish expedition led by Captain Gaspar de Portolá explored northward from Loreto, Baja California Sur, seeking to reach Monterey Bay, something never before done overland by Europeans. On July 20 of that year, the expedition arrived in the area now known as Camp Pendleton, and as it was the feast day of St. Margaret, they christened the land in the name of Santa Margarita. The expedition went on to establish military outposts and Franciscan missions at San Diego and Monterey.

During the next 30 years, 21 missions were established, the most productive one being Mission San Luis Rey, just south of the present-day Camp Pendleton. At that time, San Luis Rey Mission had control over the Santa Margarita area.

After 1821, following the Mexican War of Independence from Spain, some of the former members of the Portolà expedition who had stayed on (mostly garrison soldiers) were awarded large land grants (&quot;ranchos&quot;) by Mexican governors. The retired soldiers were joined as &quot;rancheros&quot; by prominent businessmen, officials, and military leaders. They and their children, the Californios, became the landed gentry of Alta California.

In 1841, two brothers, Pio Pico and Andrés Pico, became the first private owners of Rancho Santa Margarita. More land was later added to the grant, giving it the name of Rancho Santa Margarita y Las Flores, which stayed with the ranch until the Marine Corps acquired it in 1942. The design of the ranch&#x27;s cattle brand is seen in the base&#x27;s logo today.

In 1863, an Englishman named John (Don Juan) Forster (Pio Pico&#x27;s brother-in-law) paid off Pico&#x27;s gambling debts in return for the deed to the ranch. During his tenure as owner, he expanded the ranch house, built in 1827, and developed the rancho into a thriving cattle industry.

Forster&#x27;s heirs were forced to sell the ranch in 1882 because of a series of droughts and a fence law that forced Forster to construct fencing around the extensive rancho lands. It was purchased by wealthy cattleman James Clair Flood and managed by Irishman Richard O&#x27;Neill, who was eventually rewarded for his faithful service with half ownership. Under the guidance of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s son, Jerome, the ranch made a profit of nearly half a million dollars annually, and the house was modernized and refurbished.

===World War II===

In the early 1940s, both the Army and the Marine Corps were looking for land for a large training base. The Army lost interest in the project, but in February 1942 it was announced that the of Rancho Santa Margarita y Las Flores would be transformed into the largest Marine Corps base in the country. It was named for Major General Joseph Henry Pendleton who had long advocated the establishment of a West Coast training base. Construction began in April as a temporary facility built to minimum standards of wood frame construction. After five months of furious building activity, the 9th Marine Regiment, under then Colonel Lemuel C. Shepherd Jr., marched from Camp Elliott in San Diego to Camp Pendleton to be the first troops to occupy the new base. On September 25, 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt officially dedicated the base. Wartime training facilities at the base included landing craft school, amphibious tractor school, beach battalion school, amphibious communications school, Naval Construction Battalion Training Center and a medical field service school at the naval hospital at Santa Margarita Ranch, now Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton. The facility was used as a discharge base for soldiers returning from Europe and Asia after World War II ended in 1945.

===Post-World War II===
During the Korean War, $20 million helped expand and upgrade existing facilities, including the construction of Camp Horno. When Camp Pendleton trained the country&#x27;s fighting force for the Korean and Vietnam Wars, approximately 200,000 Marines passed through the base on their way to the Far East.

Beginning in 1954, Camp Pendleton has hosted a variation of Basic Training familiarization for teenagers age 14 to 17. This training, called &quot;Devil Pups&quot;, promotes physical fitness, instills discipline and promotes love of country and the Marine Corps.

The camp&#x27;s stables display a plaque and statue commemorating a horse, Sergeant Reckless, which served with the Marine Corps in Korea.

In 1975 Camp Pendleton was the first U.S. military base to provide accommodations for Vietnamese evacuees in Operation New Arrivals. Over 50,000 refugees came to the base in the largest humanitarian airlift in history.Camp Pendleton has continued to grow through renovations, replacing its original tent camps with 2,626 buildings and over of roads.

Preservation of Camp Pendleton heritage and Marine Corps history is ongoing. The original ranch house as well as the Las Flores Adobe have been declared a National Historic Site.

===21st century===
The base&#x27;s diverse geography, spanning over , plays host to year-round training for Marines in addition to all other branches of the U.S. military. Amphibious and sea-to-shore training takes place at several key points along the base&#x27;s of coastline. The main base is in the Mainside Complex, at the southeastern end of the base, and the remote northern interior is an impact area. Daytime population is around 100,000. Recruits from nearby Marine Corps Recruit Depot, San Diego spend four weeks at Pendleton&#x27;s Edson Range receiving field training; after graduating from recruit training, newly minted infantry Marines return to the base&#x27;s School of Infantry for further training.

Camp Pendleton remains the last major undeveloped portion of the California coastline south of Santa Barbara, save for a few relatively small state parks. In 2015 the site was proposed for a large civilian airport.

Since August 2004, Camp Pendleton has been one of five locations in the Department of Defense to operate the Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS) air radar. The STARS radar allows the facility to simulate air traffic for training purposes.

Camp Pendleton&#x27;s five-man color guard has participated in many sporting events in San Diego and at the 1996 Republican National Convention, accompanying national anthem performers. Among the more famous performers who were accompanied by the Camp Pendleton color guard have been Frankie Laine, Herb Alpert, Wilson Phillips, Jewel, Trisha Yearwood and the Dixie Chicks, all of whom had performed the National Anthem at either a World Series game, Super Bowl, or, in Wilson Phillips&#x27; case, a Major League Baseball All-Star Game that was played at what is now SDCCU Stadium.

In a 2002 letter to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Marine Corps Commandant J.L. Jones stated to the Transportation Corridor Agencies (TCA), who operates the toll roads in Orange County, “Frankly, my preference is that the proposed toll road not be constructed on or near Camp Pendleton. This construction is one more encroachment venture that will hinder [our] ability to prepare for war. It will also result in additional losses of natural areas that support endangered species, thus placing an even greater burden on Camp Pendleton to protect the region’s biodiversity.” In 2008, after the rejection of the proposed toll road extension of SR 241 through San Onofre State Beach Park for environmental reasons, the TCA filed for permission to build on the northwestern portion of the base. A spokesman for Camp Pendleton denied the request in 2010, stating that they could only allow the toll road to run through the San Onofre State Beach Park because their training missions could not be completed without the proposed land. In fact, the California gnatcatcher, an endangered species, resides on the northwestern portion of the base. The TCA funded a study in 2013 to remove the California gnatcatcher from the endangered species list, which would have made it easier to negotiate the construction and planning of the 241&#x27;s extension through the San Onofre State Beach Park.

==Ecology==

Camp Pendleton was built on a wide swath of coastal land that once supported an estuary at the mouth of the Santa Margarita River and extensive salt marsh habitat. Outlying land within the base is made up of floodplain, oak woodlands, coastal dunes and bluffs, coastal sage scrub, chaparral, and several types of wetlands, including ephemeral wetlands such as vernal pools. Wildfire is not uncommon. Research in ecology takes place on undeveloped areas of the base, which contain examples of rare and endangered California habitat types. The Department of Defense has issued management plans for various ecosystems on this territory.

Land within the base still includes breeding habitat for birds such as the western snowy plover and California gnatcatcher. The coastal bluffs have many of the few existing specimens of the Pendleton button-celery, which was named for the base. Rare mammals on the base include the Pacific pocket mouse and Stephens&#x27;s kangaroo rat.

===Bison===

Fourteen American bison were introduced from the San Diego Zoo between 1973 and 1979. They roam the Delta and Charlie training areas, Zulu Impact Area and Case Springs on the base. In early 2021, there were around 90 adults, and 14 calves were expected in April.

==Education==
Dependents on base are zoned to schools operated by local school districts. The Camp Pendleton property does not have any Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) schools. The Oceanside Unified School District covers portions of the base and operates the following on-post schools: Santa Margarita School (K-8 school), North Terrace Elementary School, Stuart Mesa Elementary School, and Stuart Mesa Middle School. The Fallbrook Union Elementary School District operates the following on-post schools: Mary Fay Elementary School, San Onofre Elementary School, Mary Fay Middle School, and San Onofre Middle School. Some portions of the base are assigned to the Capistrano Unified School District.

Oceanside USD-zoned areas on Camp Pendleton property are assigned to Oceanside High School. The San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) stated that the school &quot;has been noted as an important resource for the Camp Pendleton community as it serves as the high school for many students of military families since there is no high school on base.&quot; Fallbrook Union ESD feeds into Fallbrook Union High School District, which operates Fallbrook High School. The Capistrano district operates San Clemente High School. The base has no on-post high schools.

<doc id="160349" wikidata="Q676154" url="?curid=160349" title="Manila Bay">
<text>Manila Bay (; ) is a natural harbor that serves the Port of Manila (on Luzon), in the Philippines. Strategically located around the capital city of the Philippines, Manila Bay facilitated commerce and trade between the Philippines and its neighboring countries, becoming the gateway for socio-economic development even prior to Spanish occupation. With an area of , and a coastline of , Manila Bay is situated in the western part of Luzon and is bounded by Cavite and Metro Manila on the east, Bulacan and Pampanga on the north, and Bataan on the west and northwest. Manila Bay drains approximately of watershed area, with the Pampanga River contributing about 49% of the freshwater influx. With an average depth of , it is estimated to have a total volume of 28.9 billion cubic meters (28.9 cubic km). Entrance to the bay is wide and expands to a width of . However, width of the bay varies from at its mouth and expanding to at its widest point.

The islands of Corregidor and Caballo divides the entrance into two channels, about towards the North and wide on the South side. Mariveles, in the province of Bataan, is an anchorage just inside the northern entrance and Sangley Point is the former location of Cavite Naval Base. On either side of the bay are volcanic peaks topped with tropical foliage: 40 km to the north is the Bataan Peninsula and to the south is the province of Cavite.

Across the entrance to Manila Bay are several islands, the largest of which is Corregidor, located 3 kilometers from Bataan and, along with the island of Caballo, separates the mouth of the bay into the North and South Channels. In the south channel is El Fraile Island and outside the entrance, and to the south, is Carabao Island. El Fraile, a rocky island some in area, supports the massive concrete and steel ruins of Fort Drum, an island fortress constructed by the United States Army to defend the southern entrance of the bay. To the immediate north and south are additional harbors, upon which both local and international ports are situated. Large number of ships at the North and South harbors facilitate maritime activities in the bay. Being smaller of the two harbors, the North Harbor is used for inter-island shipping while the South Harbor is used for large ocean-going vessels.

==History==
Manila Bay was connected to Laguna de Bay (pronounced &quot;bai&quot;) approximately 3,000 years ago. Recurring episodic
uplifts along the West Marikina Valley Fault caused the two to break up. Interaction between Manila Bay and Laguna de Bay today occurs only through the Pasig River. The bay was the setting for the Battle of Manila Bay in 1898, in which American troops led by Commodore George Dewey seized the area. This battle showcased the United States&#x27; naval strength. All major Spanish ships were destroyed and captured. With its proud historic past and abundant marine life, Manila Bay became the ocean portal and Filipino epicenter for government, economy and industry. During the Russo-Japanese War at the close of the Battle of Tsushima in 1905, three surviving Russian protected cruisers (the &quot;Aurora&quot;, &quot;Zhemchug&quot;, and &quot;Oleg)&quot; managed to make port in then-United States-controlled Manila for repairs. However, because the US was neutral in this conflict, the trio of warships and their crews remained interned by the U.S. until the war officially came to an end in September 1905. During the World War II, Corregidor Island was captured by the Japanese forces based in Manila Bay. Much earlier, various other battles were fought from this naval base, including the Battles of La Naval de Manila in 1646, which finally ended Dutch attempts to seize the Philippines.

The bay remains important for commerce and industry, including fishing, although rapid urban growth and industrialization are contributing to a decline in water quality and deteriorating marine habitats. It also serves a focus for recreation for Metro Manila and is a popular destination for walks and for viewing the sunset. Much of the land fronting the bay along Metro Manila is reclaimed land which now includes important sites such as the Philippine Senate and the Mall of Asia.

On September 27, 2011, the sea walls of Manila Bay were destroyed by the storm surge caused by Typhoon Pedring. Even the United States Embassy, Museo Pambata and Sofitel Philippine Plaza were submerged by the flooding. It was estimated that the damage would cost P30 million to repair. In April 2012, the sea walls were once again opened to the public, having been redesigned to withstand a strong storm surge.

== Ecosystem ==
Coastal and marine habitats in the area include upland forests, mangrove, mudflats, sandy beaches, sea grass and coral reefs.

=== Biodiversity ===

A total of 19,139 birds belonging to 330 families and 99 species were observed at various monitoring sites along the bay area. The endangered Chinese Egret (Egretta eulophotes) and Black-winged cuckoo-shrike were sighted in the area. A large number of migratory birds, catfish and mackerels were once abundant in these waters. Their decline ushered in the appearance of squid, shrimp, and small pelagic species such as herrings and anchovies.

=== Mangroves ===

The mangrove ecosystem around Manila Bay has both ecological and socioeconomic uses with its association of unique plant and animal species.
Of the original 54,000 hectares of mangroves existing at the turn of the 20th century, only 794 hectares are remaining as recorded in 1995. A few of the mangrove swamps remaining in Pampanga Bay are of considerable value for research and conservation education. As natural habitats, mangroves considerably help in acting as a protective buffer against cyclones and storms.

Predominant in the bay area are Avicennia marina (gray or white mangrove) together with 15 species of mangroves belonging to 9 families that grow there. In the Bataan area, species of mangrove swamps that are found thriving include:
*&quot;Rhizophora apiculata&quot; (&quot;bakhaw lalaki&quot; in Filipino)
*&quot;Rhizophora mucronata&quot; (Asiatic mangrove)
*&quot;Avicennia marina&quot; (gray or white mangrove)
*&quot;Nypa fruticans&quot; (nipa palm)
*&quot;Sonneratia alba&quot; (no common name)
*&quot;Scyphiphora hydrophyllacea&quot; (&quot;nilad&quot; in Filipino)
*&quot;Sonneratia acida&quot; (&quot;pagatpat&quot; in Filipino)
*&quot;Acanthus ilicifolius&quot; (holly-leaved acanthus)
*&quot;Excoecaria agallocha&quot; (milky mangrove)

Plantations of &quot;Cocos nucifera&quot; (coconut palm) co-exists with the mangroves found in these areas.

=== Wetlands ===
Covering about 4,600 hectares, wetlands around Manila Bay are useful in:
*providing food and habitat for fish, shorebirds and wildlife;
*maintaining and improving water quality of rivers, lakes and estuaries,
*acting as reservoir for watersheds, and
*protecting adjacent and downstream properties of the area from potential flood damage

Mudflats, sand flats, swamps, beaches and rocky shores form part of the wetlands in Manila Bay. Found mostly along the coast of Bataan and Pampanga, mudflats are suitable habitats for shellfish.

=== Coral reefs ===
Contributing to the balanced functioning of the ecosystem around Manila Bay, coral reefs in the area provide sanctuary for fishes. Consequently, its decline through the years has directly affected the fish yield.

=== Seagrass beds ===
As a diverse ecosystem, seagrass beds provide shelter for fishes and other marine life forms. Like the coral reefs, most of the seagrass beds in Manila Bay are found near its mouth, most notably in the areas of Malolos, Orion, Mariveles, and Corregidor Island.

===Upland forests===
Within the watershed of Manila Bay upland forests abound which are sources of food, timber, fuel wood and other products, as well as habitats for wildlife. These forests provide protection from soil erosion and help maintain the water levels and water quality in rivers and streams. Mount Makiling, Angat Dam watershed, La Mesa Dam watershed, Mounts Palay-Palay / Mataas na Gulod, Mount Arayat and other portions of national parks located in Bataan, Bulacan, Rizal and Tarlac form part of these upland forest ecosystem.

==Key developments==


===Land reclamation===
Largely intended for use in human settlement and industrial development, land reclamation projects contributed to the reduction of mangroves around the area, as well as significant reduction in Metro Manila&#x27;s shoreline. From 1944 to 1991, approximately 600 m of shoreline have been reclaimed in the northern part. In 2009, the Pambansang Lakas ng Kilusang Mamamalakaya ng Pilipinas (Pamalakaya) said that there are 7,000 hectares of foreshore areas in Cavite and 5,000 hectares of shallow coastal waters to expand Sangley Point naval base as part of reclamation projects, which are mostly funded by foreign investors.

===Land conversion===
Conversion of mangrove and mudflat areas into fishponds have impacted the physical features of the bay whereby what used to be irregular shoreline in 1944 has become more linear by 1977. Shoreline retreat continued as man-made structures such as fish pens occupied the coastal areas, with progradation dominant from 1977 to 1991. Most area of the bay, except those near the ports, are largely used as a major fishing ground, with fisheries and aquaculture as the dominant source of livelihood for the inhabitants in the coastal areas.

From 1990, approximately 1,200 hectares of mangroves were cleared, with the land converted for aquaculture or used as salt beds. In 1993 much of the fisheries resources steadily declined due to overfishing and overharvesting.

===Waterfront development===
With then Mayor Lito Atienza&#x27;s program &quot;Buhayin ang Maynila&quot; (Revitalize Manila) in 2002, the local government made the initiative of enhancing the seaside promenade of Manila through urban renewal, upkeep and improvements. What later became known as Baywalk, the facelift of the 2 km strip of central public space aimed at creating a venue for social interaction and recreation.

With reference to its colonial history, Manila&#x27;s waterfront expresses power through the dominant classes which uses the Baywalk for exercise, fishing or socialization. The mix of land utilization and social activity provides public access to the edge of the sea, and counters vagrancy and mendicancy. Reviving Manila&#x27;s waterfront through the Baywalk injected vibrance and historic appreciation into the public space with the statues of Arsenio Lacson, Ninoy Aquino and Evelio Javier placed in key areas.

At the onset, lack of funds hampered the revival of the Baywalk. Eventually, planning for the Baywalk means understanding and regulating diversity of functions with appropriate policy.

===Legislation===
Manila Bay and its corresponding resources are considered critical recipients of environmental protection. As indicated in the 1987 Constitution (Article II, Section 16) there exists legal basis for environmental protection with the provision that: &quot;“the State shall protect and advance the right of the people to a balanced and healthful ecology in accord with the rhythm and harmony of nature.”&quot;

Manila Bay Declaration 2001 recognized Manila Bay as a source of food, employment and income for the people as well as the gateway for tourism and recreation.

The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants was adopted in 2001 and enforced in 2004.

=== Rehabilitation ===

Despite the issues generally associated with developing countries, such as poverty, over-population and food security, there is surprisingly a growing concern for the environmental vitality of Manila Bay. Rehabilitation, which in this case refers to an attempt to improve an aquatic system and prevent further damage to the natural ecosystems, is a responsibility assumed both by government and non-government organizations. The Supreme Court of the Philippines for example had issued the Metro Manila Development Authority an order to &quot;demolish illegal structures and dwellings along riverbanks and waterways connected to Manila Bay by 2015&quot; in March 2011 as an attempt to decrease mass occurrences of water pollution. Projects involving the wider communities include organization of the &quot;Manila Bay Clean Up Run,&quot; which essentially supports the Philippine Environment Agencies with their objectives to raise funding and awareness towards the rehabilitation of Manila Bay&#x27;s natural environments.

On January 27, 2019, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources started a rehabilitation program that is being administered by different government agencies. Because of the rehabilitation, the 10th Philippine International Pyromusical Competition that was scheduled on February 16, 2019, at the SM Mall of Asia bayside area was postponed before being moved to SM City Clark on February 23, 2019.

====Beach nourishment====
In the early September 2020, work began on Manila Bay Beach, which was constructed through the process of beach nourishment, which a common practice in the creation of beaches around the world. It is part of an overall integrated coastal zone management aimed at coastal defense of the Manila Bay rehabilitation. When the Manila Bay Beach project came to wider public attention, the project has received criticism from environment and heritage conservationist groups. Among these include the timing of the project which was implemented amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and concerns of adverse environmental effects caused by dumping dolomite on the polluted Manila Bay.

According to the Mines and Geosciences Bureau, the project will benefit tourism, commerce and the environment. It will also protect coastal properties from erosion and storm surges, and beach nourishment is preferred over hard beach stabilizing structures (such as seawalls and groynes). The Department of Health released a statement that the use of dolomite is not a known health hazard.

As with other beach nourishment projects, the area can serve as additional habitat for a number of species such as sea turtles, as well as sea birds and beach flora. When the beach was first opened to the public, a flock of egrets were seen at the beach area.

Water quality significantly improved, especially around the beach area. The DENR reported significant drop of fecal coliform level in the waters around the beach, from 2.2 million mpn/100ml last January 4, 2021 to 523,000 mpn/100 ml in February 2021, based on the average count from three monitoring stations.

=== Bridges ===

Plans of constructing a bridge or bridge-tunnel that crosses Manila Bay have been around since 1987. In January 2020, the National Economic and Development Authority approved the plan to construct the Bataan–Cavite Interlink Bridge, also known as Manila Bay Bridge, which is expected to cross Manila Bay and connect the provinces of Bataan and Cavite. The detailed engineering design and marine geophysical surveys for the bridge are currently being completed before the start of the construction.

==Water quality==
Successive changes in and around Manila Bay are largely due to the intertwining impacts of continued industrialization, unrelenting increase in population, and incessant human activities catering to livelihood and habitation. These factors are directly degrading the overall environment of Manila Bay and these impacts are manifested in the continued deterioration of the water quality within the bay. Several industries operate along the bay in the highly urbanized Metro Manila area, while there are shipyard facilities in Cavite and in Bataan, several more heavy industries, refineries and a power plant are present. At the shipping ports and ferry terminals, an average of 30,000 ships arrive and depart annually to transport passengers, manufactured goods and raw materials. Industrial waste discharges and discharges of untreated domestic wastes from drainage and sewer outlets have contributed to the severe decline in the quality of water and sediments in the bay as well as impacted on the existing marine habitats.

=== Salinity ===
According to a 2011 study by Jacinto et al., Manila Bay has an average surface salinity of 32.6 psu (practical salinity unit). Due to the river influx, the areas near the coasts have low salinity especially in the vicinity of the mouth of the Pasig River in the eastern part of the bay. The bay&#x27;s salinity is also affected by strong seasonal variations.

=== Effects of soil erosion ===
As indicated by the exposed roots of the coconut trees, continuing soil erosion has been a major factor in the changing shoreline of Manila Bay. Apart from soil erosion, other environmental processes such as siltation and sea level rise have also contributed to changing the bay&#x27;s coastline. In some parts of the bay, however, erosion are prevented by seawalls and breakers particularly in areas where land has been reclaimed.

=== Pollution ===
With the presence of ports, sea-based sources of pollution around the bay are from ships and motorized boats. Twelve oil spills were recorded in 1995, but it was in 1999 where the highest total volume of oil spill occurred in the Manila South Harbor and Limay, Bataan. Increased presence of oil and grease in the waters are attributed to maritime activities at the harbors, together with the presence of oil terminals and the discharges from industries. These factors directly impacted the health of Manila Bay&#x27;s waters.

Aside from oil spills, trace metals such as copper, cadmium and zinc at the surface of the water were found at the bay coming from sea-based and land-based (e.g., domestic sewage, industrial effluents, runoff, combustion emissions, and mining operations) sources.

In 1996, concentrations of 16 commonly used pesticides in surface sediment was found including dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) found in Manila Bay sediments have been influenced by human activities. PAH come principally from petrogenic sources (e.g., oil discharges from ships, refineries and industries) and pyrolytic sources (from combustion sources).

Pesticide residues from rice paddy water draining into irrigation canals, which later on empty into river systems and eventually flowing into the surrounding lakes reaches the waters of Manila Bay. Compounds from these pesticide residues find themselves in food items with metamidophos, endosulfan, chlorpyrifos and diazinon among the common contaminants. While chronic toxic effects on inhabitants of the bay are not found, impairment of marine biota were more evident.

In 1997, polychlorinated biphenyl congeners, compounds common in transformers, hydraulic fluids, paint additives and pesticides were determined in sediments and oysters sampled from Manila Bay. The increase in the nutrient concentration and presence of nitrate, ammonia and phosphate in the bay, from the 1980s, through to the 1990s and beyond are not only attributed to agricultural runoff and river discharges but also on fertilizers from fishponds.

On 25 July 2024, the oil tanker MT &quot;Terra Nova&quot;, carrying around 1.5 million liters of industrial fuel, capsized in Manila Bay during Typhoon Gaemi, causing an oil spill with a length of four kilometers.

== Future ==

===Sea level rise===
Global warming poses a great threat in the conservation of Manila Bay and its bordering cities. With recent studies predicting that the sea level could rise between .75 and 1.9 metres by 2100 and considering the vast landscape of development, growing industries and overly dense population, the exponential assets exposed to flood-prone zones is a dire issue. The Philippine Country Study to Address Climate Change has depicted a proactive approach to this environmental issue through governance of a detailed impact assessment covering the following elements:
&quot;Physical Environment&quot;
* Tidal regimes including low and high levels of water circulation
* Outlining of seasons to depict periods of high and low rainfall

&quot;Habitat and Species&quot;
* Identification of coral species, mangrove forests, ecosystems within the coastlines, as well as nearby agricultural land

&quot;Vulnerability Analysis&quot;
* Vulnerability maps were drawn to outline townscape in accelerated sea level timelines. Using such resources pinpoints the populated areas and natural habitats most likely to be inundated as a result of global warming

In 2010, at the occasion of the first Inter-LGU Forum on Tidal Flooding in Manila, the Dutch ambassador Robert Brinks recommended to close Manila Bay and build dykes in order to protect Manila and the surrounding provinces from the sea level rise that is expected as a result of climate change. However, he also noted that closing Manila Bay by means of a dyke would also require a new harbor location to replace the Port of Manila.

===Challenges===
Due to the low profile of environmentalism and its objectives within the nation of the Philippines, official awareness of global warming and the investment to applicable research is in itself triumphant. Further steps to meet the challenge of rehabilitation and sea-level rise within Manila Bay may include additional research to gain insight to the complex nature of existent ecosystems; investment to coastal protection means such as the implementation of concrete walls; laws and policies dedicated to the protection of habitats and restriction or zoning of developments; as well as public educational programs to increase the intensity of conservation support. Long-term goals for Manila Bay would ideally include the decrease or termination of nearby highly polluting enterprises, implementation effective standards for waste-water discharge and an overall improved water quality.

==Notable events==

* Battles of La Naval de Manila – a series of five naval battles fought in Manila Bay, Spanish East Indies in 1646, in which the forces of the Spanish Empire repelled various attempts by forces of the Dutch Republic to invade Manila, during the Eighty Years&#x27; War.
* Battle of Manila Bay – one of the most decisive naval battles in history and marked the end of the Spanish colonial period in Philippine history, it took place on 1 May 1898, during the Spanish–American War.
* The Ruby Rose Barrameda murder case – Ruby Rose Barrameda-Jimenez was the sister of a Filipino actress (Rochelle Barrameda) who went missing in Navotas, Metro Manila on 14 March 2007 while making a family visit. Barrameda-Jimenez&#x27;s body was found on 10 June 2009, over two years after she disappeared.

<text>The concept of the First World was originally one of the &quot;Three Worlds&quot; formed by the global political landscape of the Cold War, as it grouped together those countries that were aligned with the Western Bloc of the United States. This grouping was directly opposed to the Second World, which similarly grouped together those countries that were aligned with the Eastern Bloc of the Soviet Union. However, after the Cold War ended with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the definition largely shifted to instead refer to any country with a well-functioning democratic system with little prospects of political risk, in addition to a strong rule of law, a capitalist economy with economic stability, and a relatively high mean standard of living. Various ways in which these metrics are assessed are through the examination of a country&#x27;s GDP, GNP, literacy rate, life expectancy, and Human Development Index. In colloquial usage, &quot;First World&quot; typically refers to &quot;the highly developed industrialized nations often considered the Westernized countries of the world&quot;.

== History==
After World War II, the world split into two large geopolitical blocs, separating into spheres of communism and capitalism. This led to the Cold War, during which the term &quot;First World&quot; was often used because of its political, social, and economic relevance. The term itself was first introduced in the late 1940s by the United Nations. Today, the terms are slightly outdated and have no official definition. However, the &quot;First World&quot; is generally thought of as the capitalist, industrial, wealthy, and developed countries. This definition includes the countries of North America and Western Europe, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand. In contemporary society, the First World is viewed as countries that have the most advanced economies, the greatest influence, the highest standards of living, and the greatest technology. After the Cold War, these countries of the First World included member states of NATO, U.S.-aligned states, neutral countries that were developed and industrialized, and the former British Colonies that were considered developed.

According to Nations Online, the member countries of NATO during the Cold War included:

* Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

The US Aligned States included:

* Israel, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan

Former British Colonies included:

* Australia and New Zealand.

Neutral and more or less industrialized capitalist countries included:

* Austria, Ireland, Sweden, and Switzerland.

===Shifting in definitions===
Since the end of the Cold War, the original definition of the term &quot;First World&quot; is no longer necessarily applicable. There are varying definitions of the First World; however, they follow the same idea. John D. Daniels, past president of the Academy of International Business, defines the First World to be consisting of &quot;high-income industrial countries&quot;. Scholar and Professor George J. Bryjak defines the First World to be the &quot;modern, industrial, capitalist countries of North America and Europe&quot;. L. Robert Kohls, former director of training for the U.S. Information Agency and the Meridian International Center in Washington, D.C., uses First World and &quot;fully developed&quot; as synonyms.

===Other indicators===
Varying definitions of the term First World and the uncertainty of the term in today&#x27;s world leads to different indicators of First World status. In 1945, the United Nations used the terms first, second, third, and fourth worlds to define the relative wealth of nations (although popular use of the term fourth world did not come about until later). There are some references towards culture in the definition. They were defined in terms of Gross National Product (GNP), measured in U.S. dollars, along with other socio-political factors. The first world included the large industrialized, democratic (free elections, etc.) nations. The second world included modern, wealthy, industrialized nations, but they were all under communist control. Most of the rest of the world was deemed part of the third world, while the fourth world was considered to be those nations whose people were living on less than US$100 annually. If we use the term to mean high-income industrialized economies, then the World Bank classifies countries according to their GNI or gross national income per capita. The World Bank separates countries into four categories: high-income, upper-middle-income, lower-middle-income, and low-income economies. The First World is considered to be countries with high-income economies. The high-income economies are equated to mean developed and industrialized countries.

==Three-world model==
The terms &quot;First World&quot;, &quot;Second World&quot;, and &quot;Third World&quot; were originally used to divide the world&#x27;s nations into three categories. The model did not emerge to its endstate all at once. The complete overthrow of the pre–World War II status quo, known as the Cold War, left two superpowers (the United States and the Soviet Union) vying for ultimate global supremacy. They created two camps, known as blocs. These blocs formed the basis of the concepts of the First and Second Worlds.

Early in the Cold War era, NATO and the Warsaw Pact were created by the United States and the Soviet Union, respectively. They were also referred to as the Western Bloc and the Eastern Bloc. The circumstances of these two blocs were so different that they were essentially two worlds, however, they were not numbered first and second. The onset of the Cold War is marked by Winston Churchill&#x27;s famous &quot;Iron Curtain&quot; speech. In this speech, Churchill describes the division of the West and East to be so solid that it could be called an iron curtain.

In 1952, the French demographer Alfred Sauvy coined the term Third World in reference to the three estates in pre-revolutionary France. The first two estates being the nobility and clergy and everybody else comprising the third estate. He compared the capitalist world (i.e., First World) to the nobility and the communist world (i.e., Second World) to the clergy. Just as the third estate comprised everybody else, Sauvy called the Third World all the countries that were not in this Cold War division, i.e., the unaligned and uninvolved states in the &quot;East-West Conflict&quot;. With the coining of the term Third World directly, the first two groups came to be known as the &quot;First World&quot; and &quot;Second World&quot; respectively. Here the three-world system emerged.

===Post–Cold War===
With the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Eastern Bloc ceased to exist and with it, the perfect applicability of the term Second World. The definitions of the First World, Second World, and Third World changed slightly, yet generally describe the same concepts.

==Relationships with the other worlds==
===Historic===
During the Cold War era, the relationships between the First World, Second World and the Third World were very rigid. The First World and Second World were at constant odds with one another via the tensions between their two cores, the United States and the Soviet Union, respectively. The Cold War, as its name suggests, was a primarily ideological struggle between the First and Second Worlds, or more specifically, the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Multiple doctrines and plans dominated Cold War dynamics including the Truman Doctrine and Marshall Plan (from the U.S.) and the Molotov Plan (from the Soviet Union). The extent of the tension between the two worlds was evident in Berlin -- which was then split into East and West. To stop citizens in East Berlin from having too much exposure to the capitalist West, the Soviet Union erected the Berlin Wall within the city.

The relationship between the First World and the Third World is characterized by the very definition of the Third World. Because countries of the Third World were noncommittal and non-aligned with both the First World and the Second World, they were targets for recruitment. In the quest for expanding their sphere of influence, the United States (core of the First World) tried to establish pro-U.S. regimes in the Third World. In addition, because the Soviet Union (core of the Second World) also wanted to expand, the Third World often became a site for conflict. Some examples include Vietnam and Korea. Success lay with the First World if at the end of the war, the country became capitalistic and democratic, and with the Second World, if the country became communist. While Vietnam as a whole was eventually communized, only the northern half of Korea remained communist. The Domino Theory largely governed United States policy regarding the Third World and their rivalry with the Second World. In light of the Domino Theory, the U.S. saw winning the proxy wars in the Third World as a measure of the &quot;credibility of U.S. commitments all over the world&quot;.

===Present===
The movement of people and information largely characterizes the inter-world relationships in the present day. A majority of breakthroughs and innovation originate in Western Europe and the U.S. and later their effects permeate globally. As judged by the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, most of the Top 30 Innovations of the Last 30 Years were from former First World countries (e.g., the U.S. and countries in Western Europe).

The disparity between knowledge in the First World as compared to the Third World is evident in healthcare and medical advancements. Deaths from water-related illnesses have largely been eliminated in &quot;wealthier nations&quot;, while they are still a &quot;major concern in the developing world&quot;. Widely treatable diseases in the developed countries of the First World, malaria and tuberculosis needlessly claim many lives in the developing countries of the Third World. Each year 900,000 people die from malaria and combating the disease accounts for 40% of health spending in many African countries.

The International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) announced that the first Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) would be available in the summer of 2010. These include non-Latin domains such as Chinese, Arabic, and Russian. This is one way that the flow of information between the First and Third Worlds may become more even.

The movement of information and technology from the First World to various Third World countries has created a general &quot;aspir(ation) to First World living standards&quot;. The Third World has lower living standards as compared to the First World. Information about the comparatively higher living standards of the First World comes through television, commercial advertisements and foreign visitors to their countries. This exposure causes two changes: a) living standards in some Third World countries rise and b) this exposure creates hopes and many from Third World countries emigrate—both legally and illegally—to these First World countries in hopes of attaining that living standard and prosperity. In fact, this emigration is the &quot;main contributor to the increasing populations of U.S. and Europe&quot;. While these emigrations have greatly contributed to globalization, they have also precipitated trends like brain drain and problems with repatriation. They have also created immigration and governmental burden problems for the countries (i.e., First World) that people emigrate to.

===Environmental footprint===
Some have argued that the most important human population problem for the world is not the high rate of population increase in certain Third World countries per se, but rather the &quot;increase in total human impact&quot;. The per-capita footprint—the resources consumed and the waste created by each person—varies globally. The highest per-person impact occurs in the First World and the lowest in the Third World: each inhabitant of the United States, Western Europe and Japan consumes 32 times as many resources and puts out 32 times as much waste as each person in the Third World. However, China leads the world in total emissions, but its large population skews its per-capita statistic lower than those of more developed nations.

As large consumers of fossil fuels, First World countries drew attention to environmental pollution. The Kyoto Protocol is a treaty that is based on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was finalized in 1992 at the Earth Summit in Rio. It proposed to place the burden of protecting the climate on the United States and other First World countries. Countries that were considered to be developing, such as China and India, were not required to approve the treaty because they were more concerned that restricting emissions would further restrain their development.

===International relations===
Until the recent past, little attention was paid to the interests of Third World countries. This is because most international relations scholars have come from the industrialized, First World nations. As more countries have continued to become more developed, the interests of the world have slowly started to shift. However, First World nations still have many more universities, professors, journals, and conferences, which has made it very difficult for Third World countries to gain legitimacy and respect with their new ideas and methods of looking at the world.

===Development theory===
During the Cold War, the modernization theory and development theory developed in Europe as a result of their economic, political, social, and cultural response to the management of former colonial territories. European scholars and practitioners of international politics hoped to theorize ideas and then create policies based on those ideas that would cause newly independent colonies to change into politically developed sovereign nation-states. However, most of the theorists were from the United States, and they were not interested in Third World countries achieving development by any model. They wanted those countries to develop through liberal processes of politics, economics, and socialization; that is to say, they wanted them to follow the liberal capitalist example of a so-called &quot;First World state&quot;. Therefore, the modernization and development tradition consciously originated as a (mostly U.S.) alternative to the Marxist and neo-Marxist strategies promoted by the &quot;Second World states&quot; like the Soviet Union. It was used to explain how developing Third World states would naturally &quot;evolve&quot; into developed First World States, and it was partially grounded in liberal economic theory and a form of Talcott Parsons&#x27; sociological theory.

==Globalization==
The United Nations&#x27;s ESCWA has written that globalization &quot;is a widely-used term that can be defined in a number of different ways&quot;. Joyce Osland from San Jose State University wrote: &quot;Globalization has become an increasingly controversial topic, and the growing number of protests around the world has focused more attention on the basic assumptions of globalization and its effects.&quot; &quot;Globalization is not new, though. For thousands of years, people—and, later, corporations—have been buying from and selling to each other in lands at great distances, such as through the famed Silk Road across Central Asia that connected China and Europe during the Middle Ages. Likewise, for centuries, people and corporations have invested in enterprises in other countries. In fact, many of the features of the current wave of globalization are similar to those prevailing before the outbreak of the First World War in 1914.&quot;

===European Union===
The most prominent example of globalization in the first world is the European Union (EU). The European Union is an agreement in which countries voluntarily decide to build common governmental institutions to which they delegate some individual national sovereignty so that decisions can be made democratically on a higher level of common interest for Europe as a whole. The result is a union of 27 Member States covering with roughly 450 million people. In total, the European Union produces almost a third of the world&#x27;s gross national product and the member states speak more than 23 languages. All of the European Union countries are joined together by a hope to promote and extend peace, democracy, cooperativeness, stability, prosperity, and the rule of law. In a 2007 speech, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, the European Commissioner for External Relations, said, &quot;The future of the EU is linked to globalization...the EU has a crucial role to play in making globalization work properly...&quot;. In a 2014 speech at the European Parliament, the Italian PM Matteo Renzi stated, &quot;We are the ones who can bring civilization to globalization&quot;.

Just as the concept of the First World came about as a result of World War II, so did the European Union. In 1951 the beginnings of the EU were founded with the creation of European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). From the beginning of its inception, countries in the EU were judged by many standards, including economic ones. This is where the relation between globalization, the EU, and First World countries arises. Especially during the 1990s when the EU focused on economic policies such as the creation and circulation of the Euro, the creation of the European Monetary Institute, and the opening of the European Central Bank.

In 1993, at the Copenhagen European Council, the European Union took a decisive step towards expanding the EU, what they called the Fifth Enlargement, agreeing that &quot;the associated countries in Central and Eastern Europe that so desire shall become members of the European Union&quot;. Thus, enlargement was no longer a question of if, but when and how. The European Council stated that accession could occur when the prospective country is able to assume the obligations of membership, that is that all the economic and political conditions required are attained. Furthermore, it defined the membership criteria, which are regarded as the Copenhagen criteria, as follows:

* stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities
* the existence of a functioning market economy as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union
* the ability to take on the obligations of membership including adherence to the aims of political, economic and monetary union

It is clear that all these criteria are characteristics of developed countries. Therefore, there is a direct link between globalization, developed nations, and the European Union.

===Multinational corporations===
A majority of multinational corporations find their origins in First World countries. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, multinational corporations proliferated as more countries focused on global trade. The series of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and later the World Trade Organization (WTO) essentially ended the protectionist measures that were dissuading global trade. The eradication of these protectionist measures, while creating avenues for economic interconnection, mostly benefited developed countries, who by using their power at GATT summits, forced developing and underdeveloped countries to open their economies to Western goods.

As the world starts to globalize, it is accompanied by criticism of the current forms of globalization, which are feared to be overly corporate-led. As corporations become larger and multinational, their influence and interests go further accordingly. Being able to influence and own most media companies, it is hard to be able to publicly debate the notions and ideals that corporations pursue. Some choices that corporations take to make profits can affect people all over the world. Sometimes fatally.

The third industrial revolution is spreading from the developed world to some, but not all, parts of the developing world. To participate in this new global economy, developing countries must be seen as attractive offshore production bases for multinational corporations. To be such bases, developing countries must provide relatively well-educated workforces, good infrastructure (electricity, telecommunications, transportation), political stability, and a willingness to play by market rules.

If these conditions are in place, multinational corporations will transfer via their offshore subsidiaries or to their offshore suppliers, the specific production technologies and market linkages necessary to participate in the global economy. By themselves, developing countries, even if well-educated, cannot produce at the quality levels demanded in high-value-added industries and cannot market what they produce even in low-value-added industries such as textiles or shoes. Put bluntly, multinational companies possess a variety of factors that developing countries must have if they are to participate in the global economy.

===Outsourcing===
Outsourcing, according to Grossman and Helpman, refers to the process of &quot;subcontracting an ever expanding set of activities, ranging from product design to assembly, from research and development to marketing, distribution and after-sales service&quot;. Many companies have moved to outsourcing services in which they no longer specifically need or have the capability of handling themselves. This is due to considerations of what the companies can have more control over. Whatever companies tend to not have much control over or need to have control over will outsource activities to firms that they consider &quot;less competing&quot;. According to SourcingMag.com, the process of outsourcing can take the following four phases.

# strategic thinking
# evaluation and selection
# contract development
# outsourcing management

Outsourcing is among some of the many reasons for increased competition within developing countries. Aside from being a reason for competition, many First World countries see outsourcing, in particular offshore outsourcing, as an opportunity for increased income. As a consequence, the skill level of production in foreign countries handling the outsourced services increases within the economy; and the skill level within the domestic developing countries can decrease. It is because of competition (including outsourcing) that Robert Feenstra and Gordon Hanson predict that there will be a rise of 15–33 percent in inequality amongst these countries.

<text>A Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU, pronounced as one syllable &quot;&quot; IPA: ) is the smallest air-ground task force (MAGTF) in the United States Fleet Marine Force. Each MEU is an expeditionary rapid reaction force ready to answer any crisis, whether it be disaster aid or a combat mission. Marine Amphibious Unit (MAU) was the name used until the late 1980s.

A MEU normally is composed of
* a reinforced USMC infantry battalion (designated as a Battalion Landing Team) as the ground combat element
* a composite medium tiltrotor squadron forming the aviation combat element
* a combat logistics battalion providing the logistics combat element
* a company-size command element serving as the MEU headquarters group.

Troop strength of a MEU is about 2,200 (normal and peacetime) to 4,400 (mobilization and wartime). A MEU is usually commanded by a colonel, and is deployed from amphibious assault ships. Currently, a MEU embarks personnel and equipment on the amphibious warfare ships of an expeditionary strike group (ESG), which also includes escort warships and submarines to protect them from air, surface, and submarine threats. For further protection and strong air support, an ESG is often deployed along with one or more carrier strike groups.

==Attributes==

The MEU is unique in that its air and ground combat elements are combined with a logistics combat element under one commander; other services do not unite the command of air and ground forces until much higher command levels.

The MEU&#x27;s ground combat element also combines artillery, light armor, and tanks at a much lower level than was common in the Army until the development of the brigade combat team early in the War on Terror, with a similar concept, the combat command, being utilized in World War II.

This air-ground task force concept is designed to thoroughly exploit the combat power inherent in air and ground assets by closely integrating them into a single force. The MEU brings all the supplies and logistical support it needs to sustain itself for quick mission accomplishment or to prepare the way for follow-up forces. This self-sustainment allows more flexibility in disposition and operations of forces, and allows the MEU to initiate operations sooner and let support catch up later, without having to wait for external logistical support to begin a mission. Deployments on U.S. Navy amphibious assault ships allows MEUs to seabase around the globe, ready for deployment at short notice.

A typical MEU has approximately 2,200 members, including navy sailors. It is equipped with:

Many types of equipment are, or will soon, undergo a transitory phase as they are replaced. Some examples include the Amphibious Combat Vehicle replacing the AAV-7, the F-35 Lightning II replacing the AV-8B Harrier, and the CH-53K King Stallion replacing the CH-53E.

==Elements==

===Ground combat element===

The ground combat element (GCE) is based on the &quot;battalion landing team&quot; (&quot;BLT&quot;), an infantry battalion reinforced with an artillery battery, amphibious assault vehicle platoon, combat engineer platoon, light armored reconnaissance company, reconnaissance platoon, and other units as the mission and circumstances require. The total strength is approximately 1,100 members, including Navy sailors.

The Maritime Special Purpose Force is a subgroup of the MEU, formed for low-profile missions. The MSPF force consists of four elements: an assault platoon (a direct action platoon augmented from Force Recon), a security platoon (a selected infantry platoon from the battalion landing team), reconnaissance and surveillance assets, and a headquarters section. The total strength is approximately 350 members, including Navy sailors.

===Aviation combat element===
The aviation combat element (ACE) is a USMC composite squadron (reinforced) composed of a medium tiltrotor squadron augmented with detachments of heavy, light, and attack helicopters, one detachment of amphibious flight-deck-capable jets, and a Marine air control group detachment with tactical air command, air traffic control, direct air support, and anti-aircraft assets, as well as wing headquarters, wing communications, and wing support squadron personnel. Total strength is approximately 600 troops.

===Logistics combat element===
The logistics combat element (LCE) (formerly &quot;combat service support element&quot; or &quot;CSSE&quot;) is based on the MEU combat logistics battalion (CLB) (formerly &quot;MEU service support group&quot; or &quot;MSSG&quot;). It contains all the logistics specialists and equipment necessary for the MEU to support and sustain itself for up to 15 days in an austere expeditionary environment. It includes service support (postal and disbursing), medical, dental, intermediate maintenance, intermediate supply (consumables and secondary reparable), transportation (distribution and landing support), explosive ordnance disposal, utilities production and distribution, bulk fuels, internal communications, and various other technical experts. It consists of approximately 300 members, including Navy sailors.

===Command element===
The command element (CE), which includes the MEU commander and his supporting staff, provides command and control over the other three elements. It includes specialized detachments for air naval gunfire liaison, reconnaissance, surveillance, specialized communications, radio reconnaissance (SIGINT), electronic warfare, Marine Corps Intelligence and counterintelligence, law enforcement, and public affairs missions. The overall strength is about 200 members, including Navy sailors.

==Expeditionary strike group==
Recently, MEUs have been deployed within an expeditionary strike group (ESG) in the Mediterranean, the Western Pacific, and periodically, the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. An ESG is typically composed of three amphibious ships that embark the necessary troops and equipment and are escorted by a guided missile cruiser (CG) and guided missile destroyers (DDG) and submarine (SSN) support.

Before the ESG, MEUs were typically deployed as part of an amphibious ready group (ARG).

==The MEU Cycle==

MEUs maintain their subordinate elements in fifteen month cycles: nine months stateside (with six set aside for training), and a six-month deployment aboard ship. These cycles ensure that at least two of the seven MEUs are deployed forward at any given time.

Interim or buildup period: Upon completion of a deployment, the MEU remains &quot;special operations capable&quot; for approximately one month, prepared to respond to events around the world. They are not, however, considered a special operations unit by the Department of Defense. The MEU then releases its major subordinate elements (MSEs), retaining only its command element. This period provides the command element a chance to rotate select personnel and begin planning for the addition of newly assigned MSEs and “work-up” training. When the MSEs are received, the MEU begins six months of intense pre-deployment training.

Work-up period: Training during the six-month work-up period is often referred to as &quot;crawl, walk, run&quot;. Marines and sailors progress through curriculum and exercises that teach individual, small unit, and unit tactics while integrating the separate MEU elements into a cohesive, flexible, and powerful force. The work-up period includes training in many combat and noncombat skills, to include:
* urban sniper
* mechanized and motorized raids
* non-combatant evacuation operations
* humanitarian assistance
* mass casualty
* scout swimmer
* jungle and/or mountain warfare
* riot control

Exercises conducted during the work-up period can include:
* Amphibious squadron—MEU integration training (PMINT)
* Realistic urban training exercise (RUT), formerly training in an urban environment exercise (TRUEX)
* Expeditionary strike group exercise (ESGEX)
* Special operations capable certification exercise (CERTEX or SOCCEX); prior to deployment, the MEU receives certification as special operations capable and then referred to as a &quot;MEU(SOC)&quot;.

Deployment: Following the work-up period, the MEU deploys for six months in support of geographic combatant commanders. During this time, the MEU is a forward-deployed, self-sustaining force that combatant commanders can direct to accomplish a variety of special operations and conventional missions.

The missions may include:
* Conventional operations (amphibious assaults and raids)
* Tactical recovery of aircraft and personnel (TRAP)
* Humanitarian assistance operations (HAO)
* Noncombatant evacuation operations (NEO)
* Security operations.

==List of MEUs==

===West Coast MEUs===
West Coast MEUs fall under I Marine Expeditionary Force, and their main area of operations includes the western Pacific and Indian oceans (to include the Persian Gulf).
===East Coast MEUs===
East Coast MEUs fall under II Marine Expeditionary Force and maintain presence in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea.
===Japan MEU===
The 31st MEU is the only permanently forward-deployed MEU, maintaining a presence in the Pacific Ocean at all times as part of III Marine Expeditionary Force.

<text>The concept of late capitalism (in German: &quot;Spätkapitalismus&quot;) was first used by the German social scientist Werner Sombart (1863-1941) in 1928, to describe the new capitalist order emerging at that time - with the claim, that it was the beginning of a new stage in the history of capitalism. As a young man, Sombart was a socialist who associated with Marxist intellectuals and the German social-democratic party. As a mature academic who became well-known for his own sociological writings, Sombart had a sympathetically critical attitude to the ideas of Karl Marx. Sombart&#x27;s clearly-written texts and lectures helped to make &quot;capitalism&quot; a household word in Europe, as the name of a socio-economic system with a specific structure and dynamic, a history, a mentality, a dominant morality and a culture.

The use of the term &quot;late capitalism&quot; to describe the nature of the modern epoch existed for four decades in continental Europe, before it began to be used by academics and journalists in the English-speaking world - via English translations of German-language Critical Theory texts, and especially via Ernest Mandel&#x27;s 1972 book &quot;Late Capitalism&quot; published in English in 1975. For many Western Marxist scholars since that time, the historical epoch of late capitalism starts with the outbreak (or the end) of World War II (1939–1945), and includes the post–World War II economic expansion, the era of neoliberalism and globalization, the 2007–2008 financial crisis and their aftermath in a multipolar world society. Particularly in the 1970s and 1980s, many economic and political analyses of late capitalism were published. From the 1990s onward, the analyses focused more on the culture, sociology and psychology of late capitalism.

==Different labels and interpretations==

The idea of &quot;late capitalism&quot; was never accepted by the majority of social scientists and historians, in the first instance because it was considered that the expression was tinged with political biases about capitalism, and because it is unknowable or uncertain whether capitalism is &quot;on its last legs&quot;, or &quot;if and when it will end&quot;. In addition, the theory of &quot;late capitalism&quot; failed to explain the global resurgence of competitive market capitalism since 1980 (the era of neoliberalism and globalization) and the collapse of state socialism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in 1989-1990. There was no evidence of long-term economic stagnation, prolonged lack of economic growth or negative growth, pervasive social decay and persistent cultural degeneration, or widespread and persistent popular rejection of capitalism and business culture.

The Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin famously declared in 1920, that there are no &quot;absolutely hopeless situations&quot; for capitalism; short of an anti-capitalist political revolution overthrowing the rule of the bourgeoisie, the system could always recover sooner or later. Lenin considered that the fate of capitalism was essentially a political issue, as it depended on the outcome of class struggles. The leaders of the Communist International (founded in 1919) believed that with the first World War, a new world epoch of wars and revolutions had begun, and the Comintern programme defined imperialism as the highest and final stage of capitalism. The term &quot;late capitalism&quot; was generally not used by Marxist-Leninists. They used the concept of state monopoly capitalism (originally formulated by Lenin) to denote the highest developmental stage of capitalism.

Many non-Marxist historians and sociologists however have preferred more neutral terms, such as the &quot;late modern era&quot; or &quot;post-modern era&quot;. Some Continental and Anglo-Saxon historians refer to &quot;late bourgeois society&quot;, in contrast to &quot;early bourgeois society&quot; in the 17th and 18th century and &quot;classical bourgeois society&quot; in the 19th and early 20th century.

According to Google Books Ngram Viewer, the frequency of mentions per year of the term &quot;late capitalism&quot; in publications has increased steadily since the 1960s. In 2017, an article in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; highlighted that the term &quot;late capitalism&quot; was again in vogue in America, as an ironic term for modern business culture. In contemporary academic or journalistic usage, late capitalism often refers to a new mix of (1) high-tech advances, (2) the concentration of (speculative) financial capital, (3) post-Fordism (transition of mass production in huge factories, as pioneered by Henry Ford, towards specialized markets based on networks of small flexible manufacturing units), and (4) growing income inequality.

==Intellectual history of the concept==
===Sombart&#x27;s legacy===
The term &quot;late capitalism&quot; was first used by the German social scientist Werner Sombart in a 1928 publication after he had completed his three-volume magnum opus &quot;Der Moderne Kapitalismus&quot; [&quot;Modern Capitalism&quot;], which was published from 1902 through 1927 (only the first volume of Sombart&#x27;s &quot;Modern capitalism&quot; has been translated into English so far. Sombart divided capitalism into different historical stages of development:
* Pre-capitalist or proto-capitalist society (&quot;vorkapitalistische Wirtschaft&quot;) from the early middle ages up to 1500 AD, the subject of the first volume of &quot;Modern capitalism&quot;.
* Early capitalism (&quot;Frühkapitalismus&quot;) in 1500–1800, dealt with in the second volume.
* The heyday of capitalism, or advanced capitalism (&quot;Hochkapitalismus&quot;) from 1800 to World War I, the subject of the third volume.
* Late capitalism (&quot;Spätkapitalismus&quot;) since then, discussed or referred to in a few lectures and articles.

Concluding his 1928 Zürich lecture on the transformations of capitalism, Sombart stated:

Beyond a few articles and lectures, however, Sombart never completed any comprehensive treatise on late capitalism. His studies were disrupted by the new Nazi government when he was 70 years old (he died in 1941, when he was 78). Like many other German intellectuals, he hoped that Hitler&#x27;s leadership would revive Germany from more than a decade of economic woes, social decay and misery; he regarded national socialism as a type of socialism, and he supported the Nazi party (while retaining much of his intellectual independence). Because of this fact and because of his sociological portrayals of Jews and Judaism in some of his writings, he was often regarded as a &quot;Nazi intellectual&quot; and as anti-semitic. It meant that after World War II his writings and ideas largely vanished from university curriculae. Only since the late 1980s and 1990s did significant scholarly interest in Sombart&#x27;s intellectual legacy begin to revive, with new appraisals and studies of particular aspects of his oeuvre. 

===The interwar years and World War II===

Ever since the famous theoretical controversy between orthodox Marxists and revisionists in the 1890s, socialists have been discussing the decline, breakdown and collapse of bourgeois society. There were many attempts at theoretical and mathematical proofs of the downfall of capitalism, but also attempts to create a perspective on the nature of the epoch and the future of society, to guide political action. 

In the post-World War I reconstruction era, many of the wartime regulations in Europe continued, and the state played the leading role in repairing, rebuilding and reorganizing society. According to historian Edward H. Carr, &quot;In Europe after 1919, the planned economy... became the practice, if not the theory, of almost every state.&quot;

Addressing the Kiel congress of the German Social-Democratic Party in 1927, Rudolf Hilferding claimed that:

The term &quot;late capitalism&quot; began to be used by socialists in continental Europe in the 1930s and 1940s, in the context of the Great Depression. At the time, this was not an especially radical turn of phrase, because many people of different political persuasions really believed that the existing social order was doomed, or was at least ripe for renewal and transformation. The European economy became highly regulated, and that reached a peak during the years of war economy in 1939-1945.

During World War II, even leading American economists believed that the economic problems might eventually become insurmountable. In their book &quot;Capitalism since World War II&quot;, Philip Armstrong, Andrew Glyn and John Harrison commented that:

In his book &quot;Capitalism, socialism and democracy&quot; (1943), Schumpeter also stated:

===The post-World War II era===

In Russia, the Marxist-Leninist doctrine of the &quot;general crisis of capitalism&quot; in the imperialist epoch and the theory of state monopoly capitalism defined the official government perspective for the post-war era. The historian Paolo Spriano describes how this caused the dismissal of one of Russia&#x27;s top economists, after he dared to suggest that there would not be a deep capitalist crisis after the end of World War II:

In the West, there had been similar expectations (across the whole political spectrum) that a severe systemic crisis would very likely occur after the war. When that did not happen, it was a surprise and a relief. However, what exactly could explain this turn of events is open to debate. Different theories about the success of the post-war reconstruction effort have been proposed.

The concept of &quot;late capitalism&quot; was used in the 1960s in Germany and Austria, by Western Marxists writing in the tradition of the Frankfurt School and Austromarxism. In 1965, Fritz Vilmar published &quot;Rüstung und Abrüstung im Spätkapitalismus&quot; [&quot;Armament and Disarmament in Late Capitalism&quot;]. Leo Michielsen and Andre Gorz popularized the term &quot;neo-capitalism&quot; in France and Belgium, with new analyses of post-war capitalism. Jacques Derrida preferred &quot;neo-capitalism&quot; to &quot;post-&quot; or &quot;late-capitalism&quot;. In 1968, Rudi Dutschke, a leading spokesman of the German student revolt, published a pamphlet entitled &quot;The contradictions of late capitalism, the anti-authoritarian students and their relationship to the third world.&quot; Theodor Adorno preferred &quot;late capitalism&quot; over &quot;industrial society,&quot; which was the theme of the 16th Congress of German Sociologists in 1968. In 1971, Leo Kofler published a book called &quot;Technologische Rationalität im Spätkapitalismus&quot; (&quot;Technological Rationality in Late Capitalism&quot;). Claus Offe published his essay &quot;Spätkapitalismus – Versuch einer Begriffsbestimmung&quot; (&quot;Late Capitalism—an Attempt at a Conceptual Definition&quot;) in 1972. In 1972, Alfred Sohn-Rethel published &quot;Die ökonomische Doppelnatur des Spätkapitalismus&quot;. In 1973, Jürgen Habermas published his &quot;Legitimationsprobleme im Spätkapitalismus&quot; (Legitimacy problems in late capitalism). In 1975, Ernest Mandel published his 1972 PhD thesis &quot;Late Capitalism&quot; in English at New Left Books. Herbert Marcuse also accepted the term. In 1979, Volker Ronge published &quot;Bankpolitik im Spätkapitalismus: politische Selbstverwaltung des Kapitals?&quot;, a study of banking in late capitalism. In 1981, Winfried Wolf and Michel Capron extended Mandel&#x27;s analysis of the long recession in &quot;Spätkapitalismus in den achtziger Jahren&quot;.

==Ernest Mandel&#x27;s analysis==
Mandel aimed to explain the unexpected revival of capitalism after World War II, and the long economic boom during 1947-1973 which showed the fastest economic growth ever seen in human history. His analyses stimulated new interest in the theory of long waves in economic development.

According Ernest Mandel, late capitalism involves the commodification and industrialisation of more and more parts of the economy and society, where human services are turned into commercial products. Mandel believed that &quot;[f]ar from representing a &#x27;post-industrial society&#x27;, late capitalism [...] constitutes &quot;generalized universal industrialization&quot; for the first time in history&quot;. At the same time, the role of the state in the economy and society kept growing. During and after World War II, the size of enterprises, ownership concentration and the scale of mass production increased, the activities of multinational corporations expanded, and there were more and more attempts at coordinated economic planning (or &quot;economic programming&quot;).

Until the late 1960s, Mandel preferred to use the term &quot;neo-capitalism&quot;, which was most often used by intellectuals in Belgium and France at that time. This idea drew attention to the fact that new characteristics of capitalism had emerged in its post-war recovery. At the time, however ultra-leftist Marxists objected to the term &quot;neo-capitalism&quot;, because, according to them, it might suggest that capitalism was no longer capitalism, and this would lead to reformist deviations rather than to the total overthrow of capitalism. The proof of this seemed to be that Mandel argued - at the zenith of the capitalist post-war boom - for &quot;anti-capitalist structural reforms&quot;.

Mandel distinguished three stages in the development of the capitalist mode of production:

* &quot;Freely competitive capitalist production&quot;, roughly from 1700 to 1870, through the growth of industrial capital in domestic markets.
* The phase of &quot;monopoly capitalism&quot;, roughly from 1870 to 1940, is characterized by the imperialist competition for international markets, and the exploitation of colonial territories.
* The epoch of &quot;late capitalism&quot; emerging out of the Second World War, which has as its dominant features the multinational corporation, globalization, consumerism, and increasingly internationalized financial markets.

The French edition of Mandel&#x27;s &quot;Late Capitalism&quot; was titled &quot;The third age of capitalism&quot;.

In part, Mandel&#x27;s analysis was a critique of Henryk Grossmann&#x27;s breakdown theory, according to which capitalism would collapse after a series of business cycles, because of insufficient surplus value production. But Mandel also criticized the methodological approach of Rudolf Hilferding, Rosa Luxemburg, Nikolai Bukharin, Otto Bauer, Michal Kalecki, and Charles Bettelheim. Mandel argued that important qualitative changes occurred in the functioning of the capitalist system during and after World War II. Intermediate between the periodization of business cycles and the postulated ultimate collapse of capitalism, Mandel argued, there were epochs of faster and slower economic growth. 

In the history of capitalist mode of production since the 1820s, &quot;long waves&quot; of economic growth could be observed in time series data on economic activity. These waves typically lasted about 20 to 25 years, from peak to trough or from trough to the next peak. However, Mandel did not accept the hypothesis of Nikolai Kondratiev that there existed endogenously predetermined &quot;long cycles&quot; in the history of capitalism. In particular, there existed no enduring economic mechanism which automatically created an economic recovery after a severe economic depression; much depended on state policy decisions and on the outcome of political battles between warring social classes.

In a series of publications, Mandel analyzed the dynamics and results of the unexpected post-war boom, the long world recession of 1974 to 1982, the third world debt crisis, the 1987 stock crash and the long-term systemic crisis of late capitalism, as basis for his projections about the long-term prospects of world capitalism in the future. 

In the tradition of the orthodox Marxists, Mandel tried to characterize the nature of the modern epoch as a whole, with reference to the main long-run laws of motion of capitalism specified by Marx. These laws of motion were:
1. The capitalist compulsion to accumulate and invest for profit, under the pressure of business competition.
2. The tendency towards constant technological revolutions, which increase productivity.
3. The constant attempt to increase absolute and relative surplus value.
4. The tendency toward increasing concentration and centralization of capital.
5. The tendency for the organic composition of capital to increase.
6. The tendency of the average profit rate on capital invested in industries to decrease, in the long term.
7. The inevitability of class struggle (or class conflicts) under capitalism. 
8. The tendency of the working class to grow in size and social polarization to increase.
9. The tendency towards growing objective socialization of labour.
10. The inevitability of recurrent economic crises in capitalist society.

Mandel thought that six basic variables were most important for the long-term global growth pattern of the capitalist mode of production and its average profitability: (i) the evolution of the general and sectoral organic compositions of capital; (ii) the division of constant capital between circulating and fixed capital; (iii) the evolution of the rate of surplus value; (iv) the development of the rate of accumulation, and more specifically the reinvestment of surplus value in production; (v) the development of the turnover of capital; and (vi) the interactions between the producer goods sector and the consumer goods sector. These variables could to an extent fluctuate semi-independently of each other. 

== Fredric Jameson&#x27;s analysis==
Fredric Jameson borrowed Mandel&#x27;s vision as a basis for his widely cited &quot;Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism.&quot; Jameson&#x27;s postmodernity involves a new mode of cultural production (developments in literature, film, fine art, video, social theory, etc.) which differs markedly from the preceding era of Modernism, particularly in its treatment of subject position, temporality and narrative.

In the modernist era, the dominant ideology was that society could be re-engineered on the basis of scientific and technical knowledge, and on the basis of a popular consensus about the meaning of progress. From the second half of the 20th century, however, modernism was gradually eclipsed by postmodernism, which is skeptical about social engineering and features a lack of consensus about the meaning of progress. In the wake of rapid technological and social change, all the old certainties have broken down. This begins to destabilize every part of life, making almost everything malleable, changeable, transient and impermanent.

Jameson argues that &quot;every position on postmodernism today—whether apologia or stigmatization—is also...&quot;necessarily&quot; an implicitly or explicitly political stance on the nature of multinational capitalism today&quot;. A section of Jameson&#x27;s analysis has been reproduced on the Marxists Internet Archive. Jameson regards the late capitalist stage as a new and previously unparalleled development with a global reach—whether defined as a multinational or informational capitalism. At the same time, late capitalism diverges from Marx&#x27;s prognosis for the final stage of capitalism.

==Other analyses of the epoch==
Immanuel Wallerstein believed that capitalism was in the process of being replaced by another world system. The American literary critic and cultural theorist Frederic Jameson thought Rudolf Hilferding&#x27;s term &quot;the latest stage of capitalism&quot; (&quot;jüngster Kapitalismus&quot;) perhaps more prudent and less prophetic-sounding but Jameson often used &quot;late capitalism&quot; in his writings.
Hegel&#x27;s theme of &quot;the end of history&quot; was rekindled by Kojève in his &quot;Introduction to the Reading of Hegel&quot;.

<text>The Second World was one of the &quot;Three Worlds&quot; formed by the global political landscape of the Cold War, as it grouped together those countries that were aligned with the Eastern Bloc of the Soviet Union. This grouping was directly opposed to the First World, which similarly grouped together those countries that were aligned with the Western Bloc of the United States. It included communist states that were originally under the Soviet sphere of influence, though some eventually broke away from the Soviet ideology (e.g., Yugoslavia&#x27;s split and China&#x27;s split) to develop their own path as socialist states while retaining their communist governments. Most communist states remained under Soviet influence until the Revolutions of 1989. In 1991, upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union, only five communist states remained: China, Cuba, Laos, North Korea, and Vietnam. Though the terms &quot;First World&quot; and &quot;Third World&quot; continue to see present-day relevance in colloquial speech, albeit with a repurposed definition, the term &quot;Second World&quot; is obsolete outside of a Cold War context.

==Concept==
The concept of &quot;Second World&quot; was a construct of the Cold War and the term is still largely used to describe former communist countries that are between poverty and prosperity, many of which are now capitalist states, such as Eastern Europe. Subsequently, the actual meaning of the terms &quot;First World&quot;, &quot;Second World,&quot; and &quot;Third World&quot; changed from being based on political ideology to an economic definition. The three-world theory has been criticized as crude and relatively outdated for its nominal ordering, and some sociologists have instead used the words &quot;developed&quot;, &quot;developing&quot;, and &quot;underdeveloped&quot; as replacement terms for global stratification (which have been criticized as displaying a colonialist mindset); nevertheless, the three-world theory is still popular in contemporary literature and media. This might also cause semantic variation of the term between describing a region&#x27;s political entities and its people.

==Human development==
The Three Worlds Model was used to rank the development of countries and their economies during the Cold War. First World countries were capitalist and industrial; they shared similar political and economic institutions, and retained influence over parts of the former colonial world. Second World countries advocated socialism and shared certain characteristics such as centrally planned economic systems, single-party states, and mainly medium income levels. The First World and the Second World were competing for political and economic influence over developing nations known as the Third World.

The Human Development Index is an index used to rank countries and is quantified by looking at a country&#x27;s human development such as life expectancy, education, and per capita income indicators. The scale is 0–1 and they are put into one of four categories; 0-.55 is low, .55-.70 is medium, .70-.80 is high and very high tops out at .80–1.0. The Second World countries from the Cold War era currently range from medium human development to very high human development in terms of HDI.

==Examples and decline in usage of term==
Some examples of Cold-War definition Second World countries were Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Mongolia, North Korea, Poland, Romania, the Soviet Union, and the German Democratic Republic. 

The powerful economies of the West are still sometimes described as &quot;First World&quot;, but the term &quot;Second World&quot; became largely obsolete following the collapse of the Soviet Union.

<text>In statistics, quality assurance, and survey methodology, sampling is the selection of a subset or a statistical sample (termed sample for short) of individuals from within a statistical population to estimate characteristics of the whole population. The subset is meant to reflect the whole population, and statisticians attempt to collect samples that are representative of the population. Sampling has lower costs and faster data collection compared to recording data from the entire population (in many cases, collecting the whole population is impossible, like getting sizes of all stars in the universe), and thus, it can provide insights in cases where it is infeasible to measure an entire population.

Each observation measures one or more properties (such as weight, location, colour or mass) of independent objects or individuals. In survey sampling, weights can be applied to the data to adjust for the sample design, particularly in stratified sampling. Results from probability theory and statistical theory are employed to guide the practice. In business and medical research, sampling is widely used for gathering information about a population. Acceptance sampling is used to determine if a production lot of material meets the governing specifications.

==History==
Random sampling by using lots is an old idea, mentioned several times in the Bible. In 1786, Pierre Simon Laplace estimated the population of France by using a sample, along with ratio estimator. He also computed probabilistic estimates of the error. These were not expressed as modern confidence intervals but as the sample size that would be needed to achieve a particular upper bound on the sampling error with probability 1000/1001. His estimates used Bayes&#x27; theorem with a uniform prior probability and assumed that his sample was random. Alexander Ivanovich Chuprov introduced sample surveys to Imperial Russia in the 1870s.

In the US, the 1936 &quot;Literary Digest&quot; prediction of a Republican win in the presidential election went badly awry, due to severe bias . More than two million people responded to the study with their names obtained through magazine subscription lists and telephone directories. It was not appreciated that these lists were heavily biased towards Republicans and the resulting sample, though very large, was deeply flawed.

Elections in Singapore have adopted this practice since the 2015 election, also known as the sample counts, whereas according to the Elections Department (ELD), their country&#x27;s election commission, sample counts help reduce speculation and misinformation, while helping election officials to check against the election result for that electoral division. The reported sample counts yield a fairly accurate indicative result with a 95% confidence interval at a margin of error within 4-5%; ELD reminded the public that sample counts are separate from official results, and only the returning officer will declare the official results once vote counting is complete.

==Population definition==
Successful statistical practice is based on focused problem definition. In sampling, this includes defining the &quot;population&quot; from which our sample is drawn. A population can be defined as including all people or items with the characteristics one wishes to understand. Because there is very rarely enough time or money to gather information from everyone or everything in a population, the goal becomes finding a representative sample (or subset) of that population.

Sometimes what defines a population is obvious. For example, a manufacturer needs to decide whether a batch of material from production is of high enough quality to be released to the customer or should be scrapped or reworked due to poor quality. In this case, the batch is the population.

Although the population of interest often consists of physical objects, sometimes it is necessary to sample over time, space, or some combination of these dimensions. For instance, an investigation of supermarket staffing could examine checkout line length at various times, or a study on endangered penguins might aim to understand their usage of various hunting grounds over time. For the time dimension, the focus may be on periods or discrete occasions.

In other cases, the examined &#x27;population&#x27; may be even less tangible. For example, Joseph Jagger studied the behaviour of roulette wheels at a casino in Monte Carlo, and used this to identify a biased wheel. In this case, the &#x27;population&#x27; Jagger wanted to investigate was the overall behaviour of the wheel (i.e. the probability distribution of its results over infinitely many trials), while his &#x27;sample&#x27; was formed from observed results from that wheel. Similar considerations arise when taking repeated measurements of properties of materials such as the electrical conductivity of copper.

This situation often arises when seeking knowledge about the cause system of which the &quot;observed&quot; population is an outcome. In such cases, sampling theory may treat the observed population as a sample from a larger &#x27;superpopulation&#x27;. For example, a researcher might study the success rate of a new &#x27;quit smoking&#x27; program on a test group of 100 patients, in order to predict the effects of the program if it were made available nationwide. Here the superpopulation is &quot;everybody in the country, given access to this treatment&quot; – a group that does not yet exist since the program is not yet available to all.

The population from which the sample is drawn may not be the same as the population from which information is desired. Often there is a large but not complete overlap between these two groups due to frame issues etc. (see below). Sometimes they may be entirely separate – for instance, one might study rats in order to get a better understanding of human health, or one might study records from people born in 2008 in order to make predictions about people born in 2009.

Time spent in making the sampled population and population of concern precise is often well spent because it raises many issues, ambiguities, and questions that would otherwise have been overlooked at this stage.

==Sampling frame==

In the most straightforward case, such as the sampling of a batch of material from production (acceptance sampling by lots), it would be most desirable to identify and measure every single item in the population and to include any one of them in our sample. However, in the more general case this is not usually possible or practical. There is no way to identify all rats in the set of all rats. Where voting is not compulsory, there is no way to identify which people will vote at a forthcoming election (in advance of the election). These imprecise populations are not amenable to sampling in any of the ways below and to which we could apply statistical theory.

As a remedy, we seek a sampling frame which has the property that we can identify every single element and include any in our sample. The most straightforward type of frame is a list of elements of the population (preferably the entire population) with appropriate contact information. For example, in an opinion poll, possible sampling frames include an electoral register and a telephone directory.

A probability sample is a sample in which every unit in the population has a chance (greater than zero) of being selected in the sample, and this probability can be accurately determined. The combination of these traits makes it possible to produce unbiased estimates of population totals, by weighting sampled units according to their probability of selection.
&quot;Example: We want to estimate the total income of adults living in a given street. We visit each household in that street, identify all adults living there, and randomly select one adult from each household. (For example, we can allocate each person a random number, generated from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1, and select the person with the highest number in each household). We then interview the selected person and find their income.&quot;

&quot;People living on their own are certain to be selected, so we simply add their income to our estimate of the total. But a person living in a household of two adults has only a one-in-two chance of selection. To reflect this, when we come to such a household, we would count the selected person&#x27;s income twice towards the total. (The person who &quot;is&quot; selected from that household can be loosely viewed as also representing the person who &quot;isn&#x27;t&quot; selected.)&quot;
In the above example, not everybody has the same probability of selection; what makes it a probability sample is the fact that each person&#x27;s probability is known. When every element in the population &quot;does&quot; have the same probability of selection, this is known as an &#x27;equal probability of selection&#x27; (EPS) design. Such designs are also referred to as &#x27;self-weighting&#x27; because all sampled units are given the same weight.

Probability sampling includes: simple random sampling, systematic sampling, stratified sampling, probability-proportional-to-size sampling, and cluster or multistage sampling. These various ways of probability sampling have two things in common:
# Every element has a known nonzero probability of being sampled and
# involves random selection at some point.

===Nonprobability sampling===

Nonprobability sampling is any sampling method where some elements of the population have &quot;no&quot; chance of selection (these are sometimes referred to as &#x27;out of coverage&#x27;/&#x27;undercovered&#x27;), or where the probability of selection cannot be accurately determined. It involves the selection of elements based on assumptions regarding the population of interest, which forms the criteria for selection. Hence, because the selection of elements is nonrandom, nonprobability sampling does not allow the estimation of sampling errors. These conditions give rise to exclusion bias, placing limits on how much information a sample can provide about the population. Information about the relationship between sample and population is limited, making it difficult to extrapolate from the sample to the population.
&quot;Example: We visit every household in a given street, and interview the first person to answer the door. In any household with more than one occupant, this is a nonprobability sample, because some people are more likely to answer the door (e.g. an unemployed person who spends most of their time at home is more likely to answer than an employed housemate who might be at work when the interviewer calls) and it&#x27;s not practical to calculate these probabilities.&quot;
Nonprobability sampling methods include convenience sampling, quota sampling, and purposive sampling. In addition, nonresponse effects may turn &quot;any&quot; probability design into a nonprobability design if the characteristics of nonresponse are not well understood, since nonresponse effectively modifies each element&#x27;s probability of being sampled.

==Sampling methods==
Within any of the types of frames identified above, a variety of sampling methods can be employed individually or in combination. Factors commonly influencing the choice between these designs include:
* Nature and quality of the frame
* Availability of auxiliary information about units on the frame
* Accuracy requirements, and the need to measure accuracy
* Whether detailed analysis of the sample is expected
* Cost/operational concerns

=== Simple random sampling ===
In a simple random sample (SRS) of a given size, all subsets of a sampling frame have an equal probability of being selected. Each element of the frame thus has an equal probability of selection: the frame is not subdivided or partitioned. Furthermore, any given &quot;pair&quot; of elements has the same chance of selection as any other such pair (and similarly for triples, and so on). This minimizes bias and simplifies analysis of results. In particular, the variance between individual results within the sample is a good indicator of variance in the overall population, which makes it relatively easy to estimate the accuracy of results.

Simple random sampling can be vulnerable to sampling error because the randomness of the selection may result in a sample that does not reflect the makeup of the population. For instance, a simple random sample of ten people from a given country will &quot;on average&quot; produce five men and five women, but any given trial is likely to over represent one sex and underrepresent the other. Systematic and stratified techniques attempt to overcome this problem by &quot;using information about the population&quot; to choose a more &quot;representative&quot; sample.

Also, simple random sampling can be cumbersome and tedious when sampling from a large target population. In some cases, investigators are interested in research questions specific to subgroups of the population. For example, researchers might be interested in examining whether cognitive ability as a predictor of job performance is equally applicable across racial groups. Simple random sampling cannot accommodate the needs of researchers in this situation, because it does not provide subsamples of the population, and other sampling strategies, such as stratified sampling, can be used instead.

===Systematic sampling===
Systematic sampling (also known as interval sampling) relies on arranging the study population according to some ordering scheme, and then selecting elements at regular intervals through that ordered list. Systematic sampling involves a random start and then proceeds with the selection of every &quot;k&quot;th element from then onwards. In this case, &quot;k&quot;=(population size/sample size). It is important that the starting point is not automatically the first in the list, but is instead randomly chosen from within the first to the &quot;k&quot;th element in the list. A simple example would be to select every 10th name from the telephone directory (an &#x27;every 10th&#x27; sample, also referred to as &#x27;sampling with a skip of 10&#x27;).

As long as the starting point is randomized, systematic sampling is a type of probability sampling. It is easy to implement and the stratification induced can make it efficient, &quot;if&quot; the variable by which the list is ordered is correlated with the variable of interest. &#x27;Every 10th&#x27; sampling is especially useful for efficient sampling from databases.

For example, suppose we wish to sample people from a long street that starts in a poor area (house No. 1) and ends in an expensive district (house No. 1000). A simple random selection of addresses from this street could easily end up with too many from the high end and too few from the low end (or vice versa), leading to an unrepresentative sample. Selecting (e.g.) every 10th street number along the street ensures that the sample is spread evenly along the length of the street, representing all of these districts. (If we always start at house #1 and end at #991, the sample is slightly biased towards the low end; by randomly selecting the start between #1 and #10, this bias is eliminated.)

However, systematic sampling is especially vulnerable to periodicities in the list. If periodicity is present and the period is a multiple or factor of the interval used, the sample is especially likely to be &quot;un&quot;representative of the overall population, making the scheme less accurate than simple random sampling.

For example, consider a street where the odd-numbered houses are all on the north (expensive) side of the road, and the even-numbered houses are all on the south (cheap) side. Under the sampling scheme given above, it is impossible to get a representative sample; either the houses sampled will &quot;all&quot; be from the odd-numbered, expensive side, or they will &quot;all&quot; be from the even-numbered, cheap side, unless the researcher has previous knowledge of this bias and avoids it by a using a skip which ensures jumping between the two sides (any odd-numbered skip).

Another drawback of systematic sampling is that even in scenarios where it is more accurate than SRS, its theoretical properties make it difficult to &quot;quantify&quot; that accuracy. (In the two examples of systematic sampling that are given above, much of the potential sampling error is due to variation between neighbouring houses – but because this method never selects two neighbouring houses, the sample will not give us any information on that variation.)

As described above, systematic sampling is an EPS method, because all elements have the same probability of selection (in the example given, one in ten). It is &quot;not&quot; &#x27;simple random sampling&#x27; because different subsets of the same size have different selection probabilities – e.g. the set {4,14,24...,994} has a one-in-ten probability of selection, but the set {4,13,24,34...} has zero probability of selection.

Systematic sampling can also be adapted to a non-EPS approach; for an example, see discussion of PPS samples below.

===Stratified sampling===

When the population embraces a number of distinct categories, the frame can be organized by these categories into separate &quot;strata.&quot; Each stratum is then sampled as an independent sub-population, out of which individual elements can be randomly selected. The ratio of the size of this random selection (or sample) to the size of the population is called a sampling fraction. There are several potential benefits to stratified sampling.

First, dividing the population into distinct, independent strata can enable researchers to draw inferences about specific subgroups that may be lost in a more generalized random sample.

Second, utilizing a stratified sampling method can lead to more efficient statistical estimates (provided that strata are selected based upon relevance to the criterion in question, instead of availability of the samples). Even if a stratified sampling approach does not lead to increased statistical efficiency, such a tactic will not result in less efficiency than would simple random sampling, provided that each stratum is proportional to the group&#x27;s size in the population.

Third, it is sometimes the case that data are more readily available for individual, pre-existing strata within a population than for the overall population; in such cases, using a stratified sampling approach may be more convenient than aggregating data across groups (though this may potentially be at odds with the previously noted importance of utilizing criterion-relevant strata).

Finally, since each stratum is treated as an independent population, different sampling approaches can be applied to different strata, potentially enabling researchers to use the approach best suited (or most cost-effective) for each identified subgroup within the population.

There are, however, some potential drawbacks to using stratified sampling. First, identifying strata and implementing such an approach can increase the cost and complexity of sample selection, as well as leading to increased complexity of population estimates. Second, when examining multiple criteria, stratifying variables may be related to some, but not to others, further complicating the design, and potentially reducing the utility of the strata. Finally, in some cases (such as designs with a large number of strata, or those with a specified minimum sample size per group), stratified sampling can potentially require a larger sample than would other methods (although in most cases, the required sample size would be no larger than would be required for simple random sampling).

; A stratified sampling approach is most effective when three conditions are met:
# Variability within strata are minimized
# Variability between strata are maximized
# The variables upon which the population is stratified are strongly correlated with the desired dependent variable.

; Advantages over other sampling methods
# Focuses on important subpopulations and ignores irrelevant ones.
# Allows use of different sampling techniques for different subpopulations.
# Improves the accuracy/efficiency of estimation.
# Permits greater balancing of statistical power of tests of differences between strata by sampling equal numbers from strata varying widely in size.

; Disadvantages
# Requires selection of relevant stratification variables which can be difficult.
# Is not useful when there are no homogeneous subgroups.
# Can be expensive to implement.

; Poststratification
Stratification is sometimes introduced after the sampling phase in a process called &quot;poststratification&quot;. This approach is typically implemented due to a lack of prior knowledge of an appropriate stratifying variable or when the experimenter lacks the necessary information to create a stratifying variable during the sampling phase. Although the method is susceptible to the pitfalls of post hoc approaches, it can provide several benefits in the right situation. Implementation usually follows a simple random sample. In addition to allowing for stratification on an ancillary variable, poststratification can be used to implement weighting, which can improve the precision of a sample&#x27;s estimates.

; Oversampling
Choice-based sampling or oversampling is one of the stratified sampling strategies. In choice-based sampling, the data are stratified on the target and a sample is taken from each stratum so that rarer target classes will be more represented in the sample. The model is then built on this biased sample. The effects of the input variables on the target are often estimated with more precision with the choice-based sample even when a smaller overall sample size is taken, compared to a random sample. The results usually must be adjusted to correct for the oversampling.

===Probability-proportional-to-size sampling===

In some cases the sample designer has access to an &quot;auxiliary variable&quot; or &quot;size measure&quot;, believed to be correlated to the variable of interest, for each element in the population. These data can be used to improve accuracy in sample design. One option is to use the auxiliary variable as a basis for stratification, as discussed above.

Another option is probability proportional to size (&#x27;PPS&#x27;) sampling, in which the selection probability for each element is set to be proportional to its size measure, up to a maximum of 1. In a simple PPS design, these selection probabilities can then be used as the basis for Poisson sampling. However, this has the drawback of variable sample size, and different portions of the population may still be over- or under-represented due to chance variation in selections.

Systematic sampling theory can be used to create a probability proportionate to size sample. This is done by treating each count within the size variable as a single sampling unit. Samples are then identified by selecting at even intervals among these counts within the size variable. This method is sometimes called PPS-sequential or monetary unit sampling in the case of audits or forensic sampling.
&quot;Example: Suppose we have six schools with populations of 150, 180, 200, 220, 260, and 490 students respectively (total 1500 students), and we want to use student population as the basis for a PPS sample of size three. To do this, we could allocate the first school numbers 1 to 150, the second school 151 to 330 (= 150 + 180), the third school 331 to 530, and so on to the last school (1011 to 1500). We then generate a random start between 1 and 500 (equal to 1500/3) and count through the school populations by multiples of 500. If our random start was 137, we would select the schools which have been allocated numbers 137, 637, and 1137, i.e. the first, fourth, and sixth schools.&quot;
The PPS approach can improve accuracy for a given sample size by concentrating sample on large elements that have the greatest impact on population estimates. PPS sampling is commonly used for surveys of businesses, where element size varies greatly and auxiliary information is often available – for instance, a survey attempting to measure the number of guest-nights spent in hotels might use each hotel&#x27;s number of rooms as an auxiliary variable. In some cases, an older measurement of the variable of interest can be used as an auxiliary variable when attempting to produce more current estimates.

===Cluster sampling===

Sometimes it is more cost-effective to select respondents in groups (&#x27;clusters&#x27;). Sampling is often clustered by geography, or by time periods. (Nearly all samples are in some sense &#x27;clustered&#x27; in time – although this is rarely taken into account in the analysis.) For instance, if surveying households within a city, we might choose to select 100 city blocks and then interview every household within the selected blocks.

Clustering can reduce travel and administrative costs. In the example above, an interviewer can make a single trip to visit several households in one block, rather than having to drive to a different block for each household.

It also means that one does not need a sampling frame listing all elements in the target population. Instead, clusters can be chosen from a cluster-level frame, with an element-level frame created only for the selected clusters. In the example above, the sample only requires a block-level city map for initial selections, and then a household-level map of the 100 selected blocks, rather than a household-level map of the whole city.

Cluster sampling (also known as clustered sampling) generally increases the variability of sample estimates above that of simple random sampling, depending on how the clusters differ between one another as compared to the within-cluster variation. For this reason, cluster sampling requires a larger sample than SRS to achieve the same level of accuracy – but cost savings from clustering might still make this a cheaper option.

Cluster sampling is commonly implemented as multistage sampling. This is a complex form of cluster sampling in which two or more levels of units are embedded one in the other. The first stage consists of constructing the clusters that will be used to sample from. In the second stage, a sample of primary units is randomly selected from each cluster (rather than using all units contained in all selected clusters). In following stages, in each of those selected clusters, additional samples of units are selected, and so on. All ultimate units (individuals, for instance) selected at the last step of this procedure are then surveyed. This technique, thus, is essentially the process of taking random subsamples of preceding random samples.

Multistage sampling can substantially reduce sampling costs, where the complete population list would need to be constructed (before other sampling methods could be applied). By eliminating the work involved in describing clusters that are not selected, multistage sampling can reduce the large costs associated with traditional cluster sampling. However, each sample may not be a full representative of the whole population.

===Quota sampling===

In quota sampling, the population is first segmented into mutually exclusive sub-groups, just as in stratified sampling. Then judgement is used to select the subjects or units from each segment based on a specified proportion. For example, an interviewer may be told to sample 200 females and 300 males between the age of 45 and 60.

It is this second step which makes the technique one of non-probability sampling. In quota sampling the selection of the sample is non-random. For example, interviewers might be tempted to interview those who look most helpful. The problem is that these samples may be biased because not everyone gets a chance of selection. This random element is its greatest weakness and quota versus probability has been a matter of controversy for several years.

===Minimax sampling===

In imbalanced datasets, where the sampling ratio does not follow the population statistics, one can resample the dataset in a conservative manner called minimax sampling. The minimax sampling has its origin in Anderson minimax ratio whose value is proved to be 0.5: in a binary classification, the class-sample sizes should be chosen equally. This ratio can be proved to be minimax ratio only under the assumption of LDA classifier with Gaussian distributions. The notion of minimax sampling is recently developed for a general class of classification rules, called class-wise smart classifiers. In this case, the sampling ratio of classes is selected so that the worst case classifier error over all the possible population statistics for class prior probabilities, would be the best.

===Accidental sampling===
Accidental sampling (sometimes known as grab, convenience or opportunity sampling) is a type of nonprobability sampling which involves the sample being drawn from that part of the population which is close to hand. That is, a population is selected because it is readily available and convenient. It may be through meeting the person or including a person in the sample when one meets them or chosen by finding them through technological means such as the internet or through phone. The researcher using such a sample cannot scientifically make generalizations about the total population from this sample because it would not be representative enough. For example, if the interviewer were to conduct such a survey at a shopping center early in the morning on a given day, the people that they could interview would be limited to those given there at that given time, which would not represent the views of other members of society in such an area, if the survey were to be conducted at different times of day and several times per week. This type of sampling is most useful for pilot testing. Several important considerations for researchers using convenience samples include:

# Are there controls within the research design or experiment which can serve to lessen the impact of a non-random convenience sample, thereby ensuring the results will be more representative of the population?
# Is there good reason to believe that a particular convenience sample would or should respond or behave differently than a random sample from the same population?
# Is the question being asked by the research one that can adequately be answered using a convenience sample?

In social science research, snowball sampling is a similar technique, where existing study subjects are used to recruit more subjects into the sample. Some variants of snowball sampling, such as respondent driven sampling, allow calculation of selection probabilities and are probability sampling methods under certain conditions.

===Voluntary sampling===
The voluntary sampling method is a type of non-probability sampling. Volunteers choose to complete a survey.

Volunteers may be invited through advertisements in social media. The target population for advertisements can be selected by characteristics like location, age, sex, income, occupation, education, or interests using tools provided by the social medium. The advertisement may include a message about the research and link to a survey. After following the link and completing the survey, the volunteer submits the data to be included in the sample population. This method can reach a global population but is limited by the campaign budget. Volunteers outside the invited population may also be included in the sample.

It is difficult to make generalizations from this sample because it may not represent the total population. Often, volunteers have a strong interest in the main topic of the survey.

===Line-intercept sampling===
Line-intercept sampling is a method of sampling elements in a region whereby an element is sampled if a chosen line segment, called a &quot;transect&quot;, intersects the element.

===Panel sampling===
Panel sampling is the method of first selecting a group of participants through a random sampling method and then asking that group for (potentially the same) information several times over a period of time. Therefore, each participant is interviewed at two or more time points; each period of data collection is called a &quot;wave&quot;. The method was developed by sociologist Paul Lazarsfeld in 1938 as a means of studying political campaigns. This longitudinal sampling-method allows estimates of changes in the population, for example with regard to chronic illness to job stress to weekly food expenditures. Panel sampling can also be used to inform researchers about within-person health changes due to age or to help explain changes in continuous dependent variables such as spousal interaction. There have been several proposed methods of analyzing panel data, including MANOVA, growth curves, and structural equation modeling with lagged effects.

===Snowball sampling===
Snowball sampling involves finding a small group of initial respondents and using them to recruit more respondents. It is particularly useful in cases where the population is hidden or difficult to enumerate.

=== Theoretical sampling ===

Theoretical sampling occurs when samples are selected on the basis of the results of the data collected so far with a goal of developing a deeper understanding of the area or develop theories. An initial, general sample is first collected with the goal of investigating general trends, where further sampling may consist of extreme or very specific cases might be selected in order to maximize the likelihood a phenomenon will actually be observable.

=== Active sampling ===
In active sampling, the samples which are used for training a machine learning algorithm are actively selected, also compare active learning (machine learning).

=== Judgmental selection ===
Judgement sampling is a type non-random sampling where samples are selected based on the opinion of an expert, who can select participants based on how valuable the information they provide is.

=== Haphazard sampling ===

Haphazard sampling refers to the idea of using human judgement to simulate randomness. Despite samples being hand-picked, the goal is to ensure that no conscious bias exists within the choice of samples, but often fails due to selection bias. Haphazard sampling is generally opted for due to its convenience, when the tools or capacity to perform other sampling methods may not exist.

==Replacement of selected units==
Sampling schemes may be &quot;without replacement&quot; (&#x27;WOR&#x27; – no element can be selected more than once in the same sample) or &quot;with replacement&quot; (&#x27;WR&#x27; – an element may appear multiple times in the one sample). For example, if we catch fish, measure them, and immediately return them to the water before continuing with the sample, this is a WR design, because we might end up catching and measuring the same fish more than once. However, if we do not return the fish to the water or tag and release each fish after catching it, this becomes a WOR design.

==Sample size determination==
Formulas, tables, and power function charts are well known approaches to determine sample size.

Steps for using sample size tables:
# Postulate the effect size of interest, α, and β.
# Check sample size table
## Select the table corresponding to the selected α
## Locate the row corresponding to the desired power
## Locate the column corresponding to the estimated effect size.
## The intersection of the column and row is the minimum sample size required.

==Sampling and data collection==
Good data collection involves:
* Following the defined sampling process
* Keeping the data in time order
* Noting comments and other contextual events
* Recording non-responses

==Applications of sampling==
Sampling enables the selection of right data points from within the larger data set to estimate the characteristics of the whole population. For example, there are about 600 million tweets produced every day. It is not necessary to look at all of them to determine the topics that are discussed during the day, nor is it necessary to look at all the tweets to determine the sentiment on each of the topics. A theoretical formulation for sampling Twitter data has been developed.

In manufacturing different types of sensory data such as acoustics, vibration, pressure, current, voltage, and controller data are available at short time intervals. To predict down-time it may not be necessary to look at all the data but a sample may be sufficient.

==Errors in sample surveys==

Survey results are typically subject to some error. Total errors can be classified into sampling errors and non-sampling errors. The term &quot;error&quot; here includes systematic biases as well as random errors.

===Sampling errors and biases===
Sampling errors and biases are induced by the sample design. They include:
# Selection bias: When the true selection probabilities differ from those assumed in calculating the results.
# Random sampling error: Random variation in the results due to the elements in the sample being selected at random.

===Non-sampling error===

Non-sampling errors are other errors which can impact final survey estimates, caused by problems in data collection, processing, or sample design. Such errors may include:
# Over-coverage: inclusion of data from outside of the population
# Under-coverage: sampling frame does not include elements in the population.
# Measurement error: e.g. when respondents misunderstand a question, or find it difficult to answer
# Processing error: mistakes in data coding
# Non-response or Participation bias: failure to obtain complete data from all selected individuals
After sampling, a review is held of the exact process followed in sampling, rather than that intended, in order to study any effects that any divergences might have on subsequent analysis.

A particular problem involves &quot;non-response&quot;. Two major types of non-response exist:
* unit nonresponse (lack of completion of any part of the survey)
* item non-response (submission or participation in survey but failing to complete one or more components/questions of the survey)

In survey sampling, many of the individuals identified as part of the sample may be unwilling to participate, not have the time to participate (opportunity cost), or survey administrators may not have been able to contact them. In this case, there is a risk of differences between respondents and nonrespondents, leading to biased estimates of population parameters. This is often addressed by improving survey design, offering incentives, and conducting follow-up studies which make a repeated attempt to contact the unresponsive and to characterize their similarities and differences with the rest of the frame. The effects can also be mitigated by weighting the data (when population benchmarks are available) or by imputing data based on answers to other questions. Nonresponse is particularly a problem in internet sampling. Reasons for this problem may include improperly designed surveys, over-surveying (or survey fatigue),
and the fact that potential participants may have multiple e-mail addresses, which they do not use anymore or do not check regularly.

==Survey weights==
In many situations, the sample fraction may be varied by stratum and data will have to be weighted to correctly represent the population. Thus for example, a simple random sample of individuals in the United Kingdom might not include some in remote Scottish islands who would be inordinately expensive to sample. A cheaper method would be to use a stratified sample with urban and rural strata. The rural sample could be under-represented in the sample, but weighted up appropriately in the analysis to compensate.

More generally, data should usually be weighted if the sample design does not give each individual an equal chance of being selected. For instance, when households have equal selection probabilities but one person is interviewed from within each household, this gives people from large households a smaller chance of being interviewed. This can be accounted for using survey weights. Similarly, households with more than one telephone line have a greater chance of being selected in a random digit dialing sample, and weights can adjust for this.

Weights can also serve other purposes, such as helping to correct for non-response.

<text>The Zambales Mountains is a mountain range in western Luzon. The mountains spread along a north-south axis, separating Luzon&#x27;s central plain from the South China Sea. The range extends into five provinces: Zambales, Pangasinan, Tarlac, Pampanga, and Bataan. One of its most prominent sections is known as the Cabusilan Mountain Range composed of Mount Pinatubo, Mount Negron and Mount Cuadrado, which are believed to be remnants of the ancestral Pinatubo peak. The highest elevation in the Zambales Mountains is Mount Tapulao, also known as High Peak, in Zambales province which rises to .

==Extent==
The Zambales Mountains has an area of extending North to South from the mountains of western Pangasinan province, the whole length of Zambales, to tip of the Bataan Peninsula in the south enclosing Manila Bay. The mountain range also encompasses the mountains in the municipalities of Bamban, Capas, San Jose, San Clemente, Mayantoc, Santa Ignacia, Camiling in the province of Tarlac. In Pampanga, it includes the mountains in Floridablanca, Porac, Angeles City and Mabalacat.

==Geology==
The Zambales Mountains include Jurassic to Miocene ophiolite massifs, overlain by more recent sedimentary formation, including the Cagaluan Formation and the Santa Cruz Formation.

==Volcanoes==
Although the mountains are volcanic in origin, Mount Pinatubo is the only active volcano in the mountain range. Its eruption on June 15, 1991 was the second most powerful volcanic eruption of the 20th century after the 1912 eruption of Novarupta in Alaska. The volcanic eruption, which was complicated by the arrival of Typhoon Yunya, covered the region with thick volcanic ash and lahar including the U.S. military base at Clark Field near Angeles City.

Other volcanoes in Zambales Mountains are Mount Mariveles, Mount Natib and Mount Samat.

==Protected areas==

* Manleluag Spring Protected Landscape
* Roosevelt Protected Landscape

==River system==

List of rivers in Zambales Mountains by length.
* Tarlac River 
* Camiling River 
* Pasig–Potrero River 
* Bucao River 
* Santo Tomas River 
==Deforestation==
The Zambales mountains have undergone immense deforestation due to excessive logging and swidden farming. The 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo also devastated large areas of the range, mostly ancestral lands of the indigenous Aetas in Zambales. Reforestation efforts have had success in some barren parts of the range, notably in San Felipe, Zambales at the initiative of the Aeta people supported by MAD Travel and some government agencies.

==Biodiversity==

===Mammals===

The Zamabales forest mouse (Apomys zambalensis) is a species of small rodent endemic to Zambales Mountains in the Philippines.

The Tapulao forest mouse (Apomys brownorum) is a species of small rodent endemic to Mount Tapulao in the Philippines.

The Pinatubo forest mouse (Apomys sacobianus) is a species of small rodent endemic to Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines.

The Tapulao tweezer-beaked rat (Rhynchomys tapulao) is a species of small rodent endemic to Mount Tapulao in the Philippines.

<text>Caballo Island (which means &quot;Horse Island&quot; in Spanish) is a bluff, rocky island located at the entrance to Manila Bay in the Philippines. It is about long with the highest elevation at 381 feet high. Caballo, along with the larger Corregidor (2 km to the north), divides the entrance to the bay into two broad and deep channels, known as the North and South Channel.

The whole island was formerly occupied by Fort Hughes, a U.S. defense fortification before World War II. It was heavily bombed during the war.

==Geological history==
Caballo and Corregidor Islands are believed to be the rims of the Corregidor Caldera. The gap between the two islands is only about 1/4 mile with a depth of and is never used for large vessel navigation.

In November 2014, Filipino peacekeepers from Liberia who were quarantined on the island for 21 days due to concerns about Ebola were cleared to return to the mainland. At that time West Africa was having an outbreak of the disease.

==Current tenants==
The island was as of 2010 occupied by the Philippine Navy and off limits to civilians. Remains of the old fortifications, batteries and structures have been left rusting in the open after it was abandoned after World War II.

<text>Corregidor (, , ) is an island located at the entrance of Manila Bay in the southwestern part of Luzon in the Philippines, and is considered part of Cavite City and thus the province of Cavite. It is located west of Manila, the nation&#x27;s capital city and one of its most important seaports for centuries since the Spanish colonial period. Due to its strategic location, Corregidor has historically been fortified with coastal artillery batteries to defend the entrance of Manila Bay and Manila itself from attacks by enemy warships.

Corregidor (Fort Mills) is the largest of the islands that formed the harbor defenses of Manila Bay, together with El Fraile Island (Fort Drum), Caballo Island (Fort Hughes), and Carabao Island (Fort Frank), which were all fortified during the American colonial period. The island was also the site of a small military airfield, as part of the defense.

During World War II, Corregidor played an important role during the invasion and liberation of the Philippines from the Imperial Japanese Army. The island was heavily bombarded during the later part of the war, and the ruins serve as a military memorial to American, Filipino, and Japanese soldiers who served and lost their lives on the battlefield. Corregidor is both a major historical site and one of the busiest tourist attractions in the Philippines.

==Geography==

Despite being located nearer to the southern coast of Bataan, Corregidor and the other fortified islands of Manila Bay fall under the jurisdiction of the City of Cavite. Corregidor, also known as &quot;The Rock&quot; for its rocky landscape and the heavy fortifications, along with Caballo Island, about south, divide the entrance of Manila Bay into the North and South Channel.

The tadpole-shaped island, with its tail running eastward, is about long, about wide at its widest with a total land area of about . The highest elevation is at on the Topside. The island is divided into four sections:

===Topside===
The island&#x27;s biggest area, which points towards the west Philippine Sea, rises prominently to a large flat area that is called &quot;Topside&quot;. Beneath this was the fortified communications center of the island, as well as the location for the Army headquarters, barracks for enlisted men, a branch of the Philippine Trust Co. bank, the Cine Corregidor movie theater, officers&#x27; quarters, underground ordnance shops, the parade ground, an Officers&#x27; Club with a 9-hole Golf Course, tennis courts, and swimming pool, and the bulk of the artillery batteries that constituted the strength of Corregidor.

===Middleside===
Middleside is a small plateau that interrupts the upward slope from Bottomside to Topside, and was the location of 2-story officers&#x27; quarters, barracks for the enlisted men, a hospital, quarters for non-commissioned officers, a service club, PX, and two schoolhouses—one for the children of Filipino soldiers and the other for American children.

===Bottomside===

Bottomside is the lower part of the island and is the neck that connects the tail and head of the island. South of Bottomside was &quot;Barangay or Barrio&quot; San José (near what was Navy Beach); on the north is what was Army Dock, with its three large piers, and, east of Bottomside, is the Malinta Tunnel. The Malinta Hill separates Bottomside from the Tail End.

===Tailside===
The Tailside or Tail End is the remaining portion of the island where different memorials, shrines and the island&#x27;s airstrip are located. Kindley Field was constructed in the early 1920s and named in honor of an early hero of the U.S. Army Air Corps. The airfield was operated then by the army, and the navy had a seaplane base. The short runway, cramped and hilly terrain had limited its use.

In 1968 during the first term of Ferdinand Marcos, Tailside became the site of the Jabidah massacre, an event which angered the Philippines Muslim minority enough to trigger the Moro conflict, eventually leading to the creation of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).

==Geology==
Corregidor and Caballo islands are remnants of a volcanic crater, the Corregidor Caldera, which was last active about one million years ago. However, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) still classifies Corregidor as a potentially active volcano.

==History==

===Spanish colonial era===
The island came under Spanish sovereignty on May 19, 1570, when Miguel Lopez de Legazpi and his forces arrived in Manila Bay. Legazpi was authorized by the Spanish Crown to establish the capital of the Philippines in Manila, and to convert the Muslims in Luzon and Mindanao to Christianity. Corregidor was used as a support site for the nine Spanish galleons used during the campaign.

Under Spanish rule, Corregidor served not only as a fortress of defense, a penal institution, and a station for customs inspection, but also as a signal outpost to warn Manila of the approach of hostile ships.

The name &quot;Corregidor&quot; comes from the Spanish word &quot;corregir&quot;, meaning &quot;to correct&quot;. &quot;Isla del Corregidor&quot;, the old name of the place, literally means &quot;the Corregidor&#x27;s island&quot;.

Several explanations for how the island was named have been suggested. One story states that the island was called &quot;Isla del Corregidor&quot; (literally, Island of the Corrector) due to the Spanish customs system, wherein all ships entering Manila Bay were required to stop and have their documents checked and &quot;corrected&quot;. Another version claims that the island was used as a penitentiary or correctional institution by the Spanish government, and thus came to be called &quot;El Corregidor&quot;. &quot;Corregidor&quot; is also a specific position of authority within the former Spanish administrative structure, the title for the man who was the head of a territorial unit known as &quot;un corregimiento&quot;. The institution of administrative districts called &quot;corregimientos&quot; (with each district chief known as &quot;El Corregidor&quot;) was in use throughout Spanish America and the Philippines. For example, the Philippines had &quot;corregidores&quot; in charge of Bataan and Zambales, among others.

On November 23, 1574, the Chinese pirate Limahong and his 65-vessel fleet with 3,000 men anchored between Corregidor and Mariveles. From that site, he launched two successive attacks against Manila, commanded either by Limahong himself or by the Japanese pirate Sioco. Both attacks failed due to a fierce battle defense led by the governor, Juan de Salcedo.

In November and December 1600, during the Eighty Years&#x27; War between the Netherlands and Spain, the Dutch privateer and Admiral Olivier van Noort used the surroundings of Corregidor Island as an anchorage for his last two ships, &quot;Mauritius&quot; and &quot;Eendracht&quot;. From there he engaged in activities that the Spanish considered to be piracy, targeting ships on the sailing route to and from Manila. This situation ended after the naval combat of Fortune Island on December 14, 1600. The Spanish lost their flagship, the hastily converted Manila galleon &quot;San Diego&quot;, as the unbalanced weight of her extra cannon caused a permanent list and put her gun ports below the waterline. But they captured the Dutch ship &quot;Eendracht&quot;, and Admiral van Noort retreated from the Philippines. Continuing the three-year voyage in his one remaining ship and arriving home with 45 men still alive, van Noort became the first Dutch sea captain to circumnavigate the world. The Dutch East India Company was formed a few months later.

In response to these events, and also to prevent sudden attack by Muslims from Mindanao, a watch vessel was posted at Corregidor to control the entrance to the bay. According to data from 1637, this vessel had a crew of twenty men, who were paid 540 pesos a year for this task.

Corregidor Island was taken over by the Dutch in June 1647, and from there they launched an offensive against Cavite which was repelled by the Spanish garrison under the command of Andre Lopez de Azalduigui. The Dutch would remain on the island for seven more months, however, as it served them well as an operations base from which to intercept Chinese merchant traffic in the vicinity of Luzon and Cebu. Finally they withdrew with few of their expectations fulfilled.

In October 1762, during the British invasion of Manila and Cavite led by Samuel Cornish and William Draper, Corregidor was used as an anchorage for warships, particularly HMS &quot;Panther&quot; and HMS &quot;Argo&quot;. It was also used as an anchorage for the fully loaded Spanish treasure galleon &quot;Santisima Trinidad&quot; they had captured, during November 1762. The British sailed the captured galleon to Portsmouth, England, where it was sold for a fortune.

The arrival of the Spanish fleet led by General Ignacio Mario de Alava, with the mission to place the Philippine Islands on alert, did not affect the fortunes of Corregidor Island. He limited his activity to the setting up of a naval station at Cavite.

On January 18, 1853, the Corregidor Island Lighthouse was first lit on the highest part of the island, to mark the entrance of Manila Bay for vessels coming in from the South China Sea. The Spanish government built this Second-Order light, which is situated above sea level and visible for .

===Spanish–American War===
Corregidor Island was included in the Philippines&#x27; defense plan prepared in 1885 by General Cerero, but no action was taken to implement it. When the U.S. Navy&#x27;s attack was thought to be imminent, a 12 cm gun of the &quot;Hontoria System&quot;, which came from the Spanish Navy&#x27;s cruiser &quot;Antonio de Ulloa&quot;, and two shorter 12 cm guns of the same caliber from the Spanish gunboat &quot;General Lezo&quot;, were installed on the rocky island of El Fraile. On Caballo Island, south of Corregidor, the Spanish army installed three 15 cm naval guns from the Spanish navy cruiser &quot;Velasco&quot;, which was undergoing repairs.

At midnight on the night of April 30 to May 1, 1898, U.S. Navy Commodore George Dewey led his naval squadron, with his flag hoisted on board the protected cruiser , eastward along the southern coast of Corregidor Island, beyond the reach of Spanish batteries and with no navigational lights on, preparing to fight the Battle of Manila Bay.

At a distance about one mile off El Fraile, Dewey&#x27;s fleet changed course to the northeast, steaming towards Manila. When they were discovered, the Spaniards fired from El Fraile&#x27;s artillery. An American response followed immediately, first by and then by , and . Since the flotilla&#x27;s speed was ten knots, they were soon far away from the Spanish batteries. Dewey sailed for Cavite where he destroyed the naval forces of Admiral Montojo.

Once the Cavite shipyard was subdued by means of a stipulated pact, two American ships went ashore at Corregidor Island on May 3 forcing the Spaniards on the island to surrender. Colonel Garces, chief of the coast batteries at the entrance of Manila Bay, and the island&#x27;s governor, First Class Naval Lieutenant Augusto Miranda, were urged to come to terms with the Americans, and so they did. Therefore, Miranda remained on the island with only 100 soldiers under the Spanish flag; Garces and officers under his command, as well as 292 men with their weapons and ammunition, were transferred to Mariveles port. From there they moved through the provinces of Bataan and Pampanga until they reached Manila on May 5. There they joined the Spanish navy battalion which was already quartered in Sampaloc.

On May 4, the American ships opened fire against the 100 men who, according to the pact, had been left on Corregidor and demanded the garrison forces be reduced to 25 men. The Spanish governor consulted Manila authorities, and they ordered the evacuation of the island. The troops were sent to Naic, Cavite on boats while the island&#x27;s governor was transferred to the American cruiser USS &quot;Baltimore&quot; and became a prisoner with his family. The Americans offered to free him but the governor rejected this. Shortly afterwards, he was disembarked in Balanga, Bataan. In this way the Spanish presence on Corregidor Island, which had lasted 328 years, came to an end.

A cannon that had guarded the residence of the Spanish colonial governor on Corregidor, the Dewey Cannon, was taken as a prize of war to the United States. It was later awarded to the rural town of Three Oaks, Michigan, where it was remounted as a historical display.

===American colonial period===

In 1902, the island was organized as an American military reservation. In 1903, a convalescent hospital was established by the U.S. Army.

The Board of Fortifications chaired by William H. Taft recommended that key harbors of territories acquired after the Spanish–American War be fortified. Consequently, Corregidor was fortified and incorporated into the harbor defenses Manila and Subic Bays. In 1908, a Regular Army post was established on the island, designated as Fort Mills, in honor of Brigadier General Samuel Meyers Mills, Jr., Chief of Artillery of the U.S. Army from 1905 to 1906. By early 1909, H Company of the 2nd Battalion of the Corps of Engineers was assigned to Corregidor and started on the construction of concrete emplacements, bomb-proof shelters, and trails at various parts of the island. This pioneer engineer company left Fort Mills on March 15, 1912. All or part of 35 different numbered Coast Artillery Corps companies served tours at Fort Mills between 1909 and 1923.

The defense of Corregidor was the immediate responsibility of the Philippine Coast Artillery Command, commanded by Major General George F. Moore at the start of World War II. Stationed on the island after the return to the regimental system in 1924 were the following regular units:
* 59th Coast Artillery (U.S. Regular Army)
* 60th Coast Artillery AA (U.S. Regular Army)
* 91st Coast Artillery (Philippine Scouts)
* 92nd Coast Artillery (Tractor Drawn) (Philippine Scouts)
* Headquarters, Harbor Defenses of Manila and Subic Bays and the Seaward Defense Command.

In addition to Fort Mills; the army post on Caballo Island was named Fort Hughes; on El Fraile, Fort Drum; and on Carabao Island, Fort Frank. According to the war plan, these forts could withstand a six-month-long siege, after which the United States would provide aid. The fortifications on Corregidor were designed solely to withstand seaborne attack. Though American military planners realized that airplanes would render Fort Mills obsolete, the United States was restricted from improving the fortifications by the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. In 1932–1934, the U.S. Army constructed the Malinta Tunnel, with its series of related laterals, to protect its military stores and vital installations in the event of war.

Fort Mills&#x27;s defense installations had cost the U.S. government more than $150 million, which did not include the expense of fortifying the neighboring islands of Caballo, Carabao, and El Fraile.

====Infrastructure====
There were of paved roads and trails on the island and of electric railroad track. The latter were used largely to haul heavy equipment and ammunition from Bottomside to the different Batteries. The Corregidor High School was where children of both Filipino and American servicemen assigned on the island studied. The island also had an electric trolley system as public transport, a movie house (Cine Corregidor), a baseball field and a swimming pool. The business and social center of this community was found on Topside.

====Water supply====
Before the war and during the siege, Corregidor depended on Bataan for most of its potable water. For this purpose, barges were used to haul water either from Mariveles or Cabcaben, Bataan.

===World War II===
During World War II, Corregidor was the site of two costly sieges and pitched battles—the first during the first months of 1942, and the second in February 1945—between the Imperial Japanese Army and the U.S. Army, along with its smaller subsidiary force, the Philippine Army.

During the Battle of the Philippines (1941–42), the Imperial Japanese Army invaded Luzon from the north (at Lingayen Gulf) in early 1942 and attacked Manila from its landward side. American and Filipino troops under the command of General Douglas MacArthur, retreated to the Bataan Peninsula, west of Manila Bay. The fall of Bataan on April 9, 1942, ended all organized opposition by the U.S. Armed Forces in the Far East (USAFFE) and gave way to the invading Japanese forces in Luzon in the northern Philippines. They were forced to surrender due to the lack of food and ammunition, leaving Corregidor and its adjacent islets at Manila Bay as the only areas in the region under U.S. control.

Between December 24, 1941, and February 19, 1942, Corregidor was the temporary location for the Government of the Philippines. On December 30, 1941, outside the Malinta Tunnel, Manuel L. Quezon and Sergio Osmeña were inaugurated respectively as president and vice-president of the Philippines Commonwealth for a second term. General Douglas MacArthur also used Corregidor as Allied headquarters until March 11, 1942. The Voice of Freedom, the radio station of USAFFE broadcast from Corregidor, aired the infamous announcement of the fall of Bataan. In April 1942, one battalion of the Fourth Marines was sent to reinforce the island&#x27;s beach defenses.

The Battle of Corregidor was the culmination of the Japanese campaign for the conquest of the Philippines. The fortifications across the entrance to Manila Bay were the remaining obstacle for the 14th Area Army of the Imperial Japanese Army led by Lieutenant General Masaharu Homma. American and Filipino soldiers on Corregidor and the neighboring islets held out against the Japanese to deny the use of Manila Bay, but the Imperial Japanese Army brought heavy artillery to the southern end of Bataan, and proceeded north to blockade Corregidor. Japanese troops forced the surrender of the remaining American and Filipino forces on May 6, 1942, under the command of Lieutenant General Jonathan Wainwright.

The battle for the recapture of Corregidor occurred from February 16 to 26, 1945, in which American and Filipino forces successfully recaptured the island fortress from the Japanese occupying forces.

===Jabidah massacre===

In 1968, an area near Kindley Airfield at Tailside was the site of the Jabidah massacre, a key event in the history of the Bangsamoro and the Moro people.

In connection with the North Borneo dispute, the President of the Philippines at the time, Ferdinand Marcos, had secretly authorized the execution of Operation Merdeka, in which a secret Moro commando unit code-named &quot;Jabidah&quot; would be trained in Corregidor to destabilize and take over Sabah.

Varying accounts say 18 to 69 recruits, mostly Tausug from Sulu, eventually refused to take orders from their officers - variously explained as due to the non-payment of their salaries or the discovery of the specifics of their final mission, which they found morally unacceptable. The officers then allegedly shot all of the men to death, with only one witness, Jibin Arula, managing to escape by pretending to be dead.

Jibin Arula was rescued by fishermen near Caraballo Island when he attempted to swim to escape, and his account eventually became the subject of numerous trials and hearings. Despite this, the officers implicated in the massacre were never convicted which served as a clear indication to the Muslim community that Marcos&#x27; government had little regard for them. This created a furor within the Muslim community in the Philippines, and eventually triggered calls for Moro independence; the rise of separatist movements such as the Muslim Independence Movement, the Moro National Liberation Front, and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front; and the Moro conflict in general. The government of the now-autonomous Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) acknowledges the Jabidah Massacre as a key moment in Bangsamoro history.

In 2015, during a ceremony marking the 47th anniversary of the massacre, a symbolic peace marker: &#x27;Mindanao Garden of Peace: Corregidor Island&#x27; was turned over to the families of the survivors of the massacre.

==Fortifications==
There were 23 batteries installed on Corregidor, consisting of 56 coastal defense guns and mortars. In addition, Corregidor had 13 anti-aircraft artillery batteries with 76 guns (28 3-inch and 48 .50-caliber) and 10 60-inch Sperry searchlights.

The longest-range coastal pieces were the two guns of Batteries Hearn and Smith, with a horizontal range of . Although capable of an all around traverse, these guns, due to their flat trajectories, were not effective for use on defensive perimeter targets on Bataan and Cavite, as their maximum elevation was 35 degrees.

During the siege, the island had ample armor-piercing ammunition but very little of the anti-personnel type, which then was of greatest demand for use against land targets on Bataan. In fact, most of the anti-personnel shells were only for the 12-inch mortars of Batteries Way and Geary.

===Battery Monja===
Battery Monja is located on Wheeler Point. It was operated by Battery G of the 92nd Coast Artillery Regiment, Philippine Scouts. The battery had two French 155mm GPF cannon, both of which were hidden in the sides of the island&#x27;s bluffs. One gun was commanded by 2LT Robert L. Obourn, who claimed that, towards the end of the battle, &quot;You could see the shells wobble towards the [enemy] ships. Our guns were reduced to nothing more than muskets.&quot; Obourn&#x27;s gun was struck and destroyed on April 28, 1942, killing 2 of his gunners. The remaining crew of Battery Monja continued to fight against the Japanese as guerrillas until July 18, 1942. Only 6 men, including Lt. Obourn, survived their capture. The 5 enlisted men that were serving as gunners for the battery attempted to escape from their temporary prison camp two days after capture; they all were killed during their attempted escape.

===Battery Way===

Battery Way, named for Lt. Henry N Way, which along with Battery Geary, was the mainstay of the Corregidor Garrison during the Japanese invasion. Its four mortars, capable of a 360-degree traverse, could fire on land targets at Bataan. They brought the most destruction on Japanese positions during the attempted landings on the southwest coast of Bataan late in January to the middle of February 1942. These mortars were silenced by enemy shelling in May 1942.

===Battery Geary===
Battery Geary was a battery of eight 13-ton, mortars. Defiladed in a hollow on Corregidor&#x27;s Southern coast it was fairly well protected from Japanese shelling. On January 6, 1942, while under the command of Capt. Ben Ewing King, a Japanese bomb landed in a makeshift temporary bunker killing 31 of Battery Geary&#x27;s NCOs and canoneers.

Early in the morning of January 26 Battery Geary opened fire on a unit of Japanese soldiers near Longaskawayan Point on the west side of the Bataan Peninsula during the Battle of the Points. This was the first time fixed coastal artillery had fired at an enemy since the close of the Civil War. Although the fire was considered accurate and effective, Col. Bunker decided to replace Capt. King and he was sent to perform the duties of fort XO and to command HQ Battery on Ft. Drum. He was replaced at Battery Geary by Capt. Thomas W. Davis. Later, this battery was pinpointed by the Japanese artillery and was subjected to heavy shelling. One direct hit by a 240-mm shell, which detonated the magazines of this battery on May 2, 1942, proved to be the most crippling shot during the entire siege of Corregidor. This explosion tossed the fifty ton barrel of the mortar around, one to a distance of , another was blown through three feet of reinforced concrete wall into the adjoining powder magazine of Battery Crockett. Large chunks of steel were blown as far as the Malinta Tunnel, killing 27 of the battery crew instantly. Also, one mortar still had a live round in its breech, and it was in the process of firing the shell when the magazine was hit. That live anti-personnel round still lies within the breach of the mortar.

==Corregidor today==
After the war, many people, most of them veterans, visited the island because of its history. Today, Corregidor is a historic monument as well as a tourist destination. Many travel companies offer day tours on the island featuring military installations used during World War II. Most of the war-ravaged buildings have not been restored, and left as they were after the war in reverence to the Filipino and American soldiers who died there.

===Pacific War Memorial===
Standing on the highest part of Corregidor&#x27;s Topside is the Pacific War Memorial, which was built by the United States Government to honor the Filipino and American soldiers who participated in World War II. It was completed in 1968 at the cost of three million dollars. The major memorial structure is a rotunda with a circular altar directly under the dome&#x27;s oculus through which light falls on the altar during daylight hours. Light lands directly on the altar on May 5 at exactly 12 noon, in commemoration of the surrender of the troops stationed there and the courage they exhibited over 72 days of bombing. Located behind the Memorial is the &quot;Eternal Flame of Freedom&quot;, a Corten steel structure commissioned to Aristides Demetrios symbolizing freedom.

===Malinta Tunnel===
The Malinta Tunnel, which is the last stronghold of the joint Philippine and American military prior to the Japanese takeover during the World War II, is now home to an audio-visual presentation by National Artist Lamberto V. Avellana of the events that took place on the island, including the reluctant departure of General Douglas MacArthur and the evacuation of the Philippine president Manuel L. Quezon and his family to unoccupied areas of the Philippines and eventually in exile in the United States.

===Filipino Heroes Memorial===
One of the most recent additions to Corregidor is the Filipino Heroes Memorial located in the Tail End. This complex has 14 murals depicting heroic battles fought by Filipinos from the 15th century up to the present day. It was designed by Francisco Mañosa, while the murals and a statue of a Filipino guerrilla were sculpted by Manuel Casas. The complex was inaugurated by President Fidel V. Ramos on August 28, 1992.

===Japanese Garden of Peace===
This garden was built as a memorial to the Japanese soldiers who served and died on the island during World War II. The park includes a praying area, shrines, markers and a small pavilion that houses photographs and memorabilia.

===Corregidor lighthouse===

The lighthouse on Topside is one of the oldest landmarks in Corregidor, first lit in 1853. In 1897, the defective lighting apparatus was changed, extending the range to . The grounds and keeper&#x27;s dwellings were further improved during the American occupation. During World War II, the lighthouse was damaged during the siege of Corregidor. The lighthouse was totally reconstructed in the 1950s with a different design and stands on the same spot where the first lighthouse once stood. The whole lantern of the lighthouse was recently replaced by the Philippine Coast Guard to run on solar power.

===Texas A&amp;M University monument===
: &quot;See also: Muster (Texas A&amp;M University)&quot;
In 2015, a monument designed by students at the School of Architecture at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station, Texas was dedicated. During World War II, there were more officers from Texas A&amp;M – the largest of the United States&#x27; six senior military colleges and known during World War II as the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas – than from any other school and more than the combined total of the United States Military Academy and the United States Naval Academy.

In 1942, Brigadier General George F. Moore, a 1908 graduate of Texas A&amp;M, was the American artillery commander on Corregidor. With the help of Major Tom Dooley, of A&amp;M&#x27;s class of 1935, Moore gathered the names of 25 other Aggies – as the students, alumni and athletic teams of the university are known – under his command. Despite the fierce fighting as the Japanese laid siege to the island, on April 21, 1942, Moore held a muster, or military roll call, calling the names of each of the Aggies under his command. In 1889, Texas A&amp;M administrators had declared that April 21 – San Jacinto Day in Texas, the anniversary of the Battle of San Jacinto whereby Texas gained its independence from Mexico – would be a school holiday. It had evolved, including with the support of former school president William Bizzell in 1919, into a day for current students and alumni to gather wherever they were.

Only 12 of the 25 survived the battle and the prisoner of war camps to which the survivors were sent. Dooley told a United Press correspondent about the gathering, and the reporter sent an article back to the United States about the 25 Aggies who had &quot;Mustered&quot;. Although the Aggies on Corregidor did not physically gather for Muster, stories were widely published celebrating their heroic assembly in the Malinta Tunnel including yelling and singing of songs about Texan independence.

In 1943, one year after the Aggies&#x27; original Corregidor Muster, E. E. McQuillen, Executive Secretary of the school&#x27;s alumni association, The Association of Former Students, renamed the school&#x27;s April 21 event Aggie Muster. This is also when it began to evolve into how it is known today, when students and alumni also honor fellow Aggies who have died. Dr. John Ashton of A&amp;M&#x27;s class of 1906 also wrote a poem in 1943 at McQuillen&#x27;s request. Entitled &quot;The Heroes&#x27; Roll Call&quot;, also known as the &quot;Roll Call for the Absent&quot; (which is also the name of a current Aggie Muster traditional segment), it also commemorates the 1942 Muster and is designed so that the number of years since 1942 can be inserted.

In April 1945, eight weeks after Corregidor was recaptured, three Aggies &quot;Mustered on the Rock&quot; and wrote letters to McQuillen detailing the events. On April 21, 1946 – the first such day after the war – 128 Aggies gathered on the island for Muster and to remember their fallen comrades. They posed for a photograph at the mouth of the Malinta Tunnel with an improvised A&amp;M flag made from a bed sheet, and the photograph became famous. MacArthur also wrote a message to Texas A&amp;M that day praising the bravery of Aggies who had given their lives on Corregidor and elswehere.

Efforts by the university to memorialize student and alumni participation during World War II in the Philippines began in 2011 when The Association of Former Students asked Elton Abbott, assistant dean for International Programs and Initiatives for the College of Architecture, to enlist the college&#x27;s resources to design a Corregidor monument. The Association of Former Students then secured funds from Texas A&amp;M Clubs and private donors to build the monument.

Affixed to the largest of the monument&#x27;s four ceramic-tiled panels in maroon, the school&#x27;s color, is a large bronze Aggie Muster symbol with a crossed rifle and sword over a lit torch and partially obscured “A&amp;M” letters. A bronze plaque below describes the famous 1942 and 1946 Aggie Musters. The monument descends to the left in three tall “steps,” each with plaques mounted on top. The center plaque names the 88 Aggies who defended Corregidor and Bataan, the right plaque names the 1942 Muster participants, and the left plaque names the 1946 Muster participants. The American and Philippine flags fly over the monument along with the Texas A&amp;M flag.

<doc id="160379" wikidata="Q1192065" url="?curid=160379" title="Point estimation">
<text>In statistics, point estimation involves the use of sample data to calculate a single value (known as a point estimate since it identifies a point in some parameter space) which is to serve as a &quot;best guess&quot; or &quot;best estimate&quot; of an unknown population parameter (for example, the population mean). More formally, it is the application of a point estimator to the data to obtain a point estimate.

Point estimation can be contrasted with interval estimation: such interval estimates are typically either confidence intervals, in the case of frequentist inference, or credible intervals, in the case of Bayesian inference. More generally, a point estimator can be contrasted with a set estimator. Examples are given by confidence sets or credible sets. A point estimator can also be contrasted with a distribution estimator. Examples are given by confidence distributions, randomized estimators, and Bayesian posteriors.

== Properties of point estimates ==

=== Biasedness ===
“Bias” is defined as the difference between the expected value of the estimator and the true value of the population parameter being estimated. It can also be described that the closer the expected value of a parameter is to the measured parameter, the lesser the bias. When the estimated number and the true value is equal, the estimator is considered unbiased. This is called an &quot;unbiased estimator.&quot; The estimator will become a &quot;best unbiased estimator&quot; if it has minimum variance. However, a biased estimator with a small variance may be more useful than an unbiased estimator with a large variance. Most importantly, we prefer point estimators that have the smallest mean square errors.

If we let T = h(X1,X2, . . . , Xn) be an estimator based on a random sample X1,X2, . . . , Xn, the estimator T is called an unbiased estimator for the parameter θ if E[T] = θ, irrespective of the value of θ. For example, from the same random sample we have E(x̄) = μ (mean) and E(s2) = σ2 (variance), then x̄ and s2 would be unbiased estimators for μ and σ2. The difference E[T ] − θ is called the bias of T ; if this difference is nonzero, then T is called biased.

=== Consistency ===
Consistency is about whether the point estimate stays close to the value when the parameter increases its size. The larger the sample size, the more accurate the estimate is. If a point estimator is consistent, its expected value and variance should be close to the true value of the parameter. An unbiased estimator is consistent if the limit of the variance of estimator T equals zero.

=== Efficiency ===
Let &quot;T&quot;1 and &quot;T&quot;2 be two unbiased estimators for the same parameter &quot;θ&quot;. The estimator &quot;T&quot;2 would be called &quot;more efficient&quot; than estimator &quot;T&quot;1 if Var(&quot;T&quot;2) &quot;&lt;&quot; Var(&quot;T&quot;1), irrespective of the value of &quot;θ&quot;. We can also say that the most efficient estimators are the ones with the least variability of outcomes. Therefore, if the estimator has smallest variance among sample to sample, it is both most efficient and unbiased. We extend the notion of efficiency by saying that estimator T2 is more efficient than estimator T1 (for the same parameter of interest), if the MSE(mean square error) of T2 is smaller than the MSE of T1.

Generally, we must consider the distribution of the population when determining the efficiency of estimators. For example, in a normal distribution, the mean is considered more efficient than the median, but the same does not apply in asymmetrical, or skewed, distributions.

=== Sufficiency ===
In statistics, the job of a statistician is to interpret the data that they have collected and to draw statistically valid conclusion about the population under investigation. But in many cases the raw data, which are too numerous and too costly to store, are not suitable for this purpose. Therefore, the statistician would like to condense the data by computing some statistics and to base their analysis on these statistics so that there is no loss of relevant information in doing so, that is the statistician would like to choose those statistics which exhaust all information about the parameter, which is contained in the sample. We define sufficient statistics as follows: Let X =( X1, X2, ... ,Xn) be a random sample. A statistic T(X) is said to be sufficient for θ (or for the family of distribution) if the conditional distribution of X given T is free from θ.

== Types of point estimation ==

=== Bayesian point estimation ===
Bayesian inference is typically based on the posterior distribution. Many Bayesian point estimators are the posterior distribution&#x27;s statistics of central tendency, e.g., its mean, median, or mode:
* Posterior mean, which minimizes the (posterior) &quot;risk&quot; (expected loss) for a squared-error loss function; in Bayesian estimation, the risk is defined in terms of the posterior distribution, as observed by Gauss.
* Posterior median, which minimizes the posterior risk for the absolute-value loss function, as observed by Laplace.
* maximum a posteriori (&quot;MAP&quot;), which finds a maximum of the posterior distribution; for a uniform prior probability, the MAP estimator coincides with the maximum-likelihood estimator;
The MAP estimator has good asymptotic properties, even for many difficult problems, on which the maximum-likelihood estimator has difficulties.
For regular problems, where the maximum-likelihood estimator is consistent, the maximum-likelihood estimator ultimately agrees with the MAP estimator.
Bayesian estimators are admissible, by Wald&#x27;s theorem.

The Minimum Message Length (MML) point estimator is based in Bayesian information theory and is not so directly related to the posterior distribution.

Special cases of Bayesian filters are important:
*Kalman filter
*Wiener filter

Several methods of computational statistics have close connections with Bayesian analysis:
*particle filter
*Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)

== Methods of finding point estimates ==
Below are some commonly used methods of estimating unknown parameters which are expected to provide estimators having some of these important properties. In general, depending on the situation and the purpose of our study we apply any one of the methods that may be suitable among the methods of point estimation.

=== Method of maximum likelihood (MLE) ===
The method of maximum likelihood, due to R.A. Fisher, is the most important general method of estimation. This estimator method attempts to acquire unknown parameters that maximize the likelihood function. It uses a known model (ex. the normal distribution) and uses the values of parameters in the model that maximize a likelihood function to find the most suitable match for the data.

Let X = (X1, X2, ... ,Xn) denote a random sample with joint p.d.f or p.m.f. f(x, θ) (θ may be a vector). The function f(x, θ), considered as a function of θ, is called the likelihood function. In this case, it is denoted by L(θ). The principle of maximum likelihood consists of choosing an estimate within the admissible range of θ, that maximizes the likelihood. This estimator is called the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of θ. In order to obtain the MLE of θ, we use the equation

&quot;dlog&quot;L(θ)/&quot;d&quot;θi=0, i = 1, 2, …, k. If θ is a vector, then partial derivatives are considered to get the likelihood equations.

=== Method of moments (MOM) ===
The method of moments was introduced by K. Pearson and P. Chebyshev in 1887, and it is one of the oldest methods of estimation. This method is based on law of large numbers, which uses all the known facts about a population and apply those facts to a sample of the population by deriving equations that relate the population moments to the unknown parameters. We can then solve with the sample mean of the population moments. However, due to the simplicity, this method is not always accurate and can be biased easily.

Let (X1, X2,…Xn) be a random sample from a population having p.d.f. (or p.m.f) f(x,θ), θ = (θ1, θ2, …, θk). The objective is to estimate the parameters θ1, θ2, ..., θk. Further, let the first k population moments about zero exist as explicit function of θ, i.e. μr = μr(θ1, θ2,…, θk), r = 1, 2, …, k. In the method of moments, we equate k sample moments with the corresponding population moments. Generally, the first k moments are taken because the errors due to sampling increase with the order of the moment. Thus, we get k equations μr(θ1, θ2,…, θk) = mr, r = 1, 2, …, k. Solving these equations we get the method of moment estimators (or estimates) as

mr = 1/n ΣXir. See also generalized method of moments.

=== Method of least square ===
In the method of least square, we consider the estimation of parameters using some specified form of the expectation and second moment of the observations. For

fitting a curve of the form y = f( x, β0, β1, ,, βp) to the data (xi, yi), i = 1, 2,…n, we may use the method of least squares. This method consists of minimizing the

sum of squares.

When f(x, β0, β1, ,, βp) is a linear function of the parameters and the x-values are known, least square estimators will be best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE). Again, if we assume that the least square estimates are independently and identically normally distributed, then a linear estimator will be minimum-variance unbiased estimator (MVUE) for the entire class of unbiased estimators. See also minimum mean squared error (MMSE).

=== Minimum-variance mean-unbiased estimator (MVUE) ===
The method of minimum-variance unbiased estimator minimizes the risk (expected loss) of the squared-error loss-function.

=== Median unbiased estimator ===
Median-unbiased estimator minimizes the risk of the absolute-error loss function.

=== Best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) ===
Best linear unbiased estimator, also known as the Gauss–Markov theorem states that the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator has the lowest sampling variance within the class of linear unbiased estimators, if the errors in the linear regression model are uncorrelated, have equal variances and expectation value of zero.

== Point estimate v.s. confidence interval estimate ==

There are two major types of estimates: point estimate and confidence interval estimate. In the point estimate we try to choose a unique point in the parameter space which can reasonably be considered as the true value of the parameter. On the other hand, instead of unique estimate of the parameter, we are interested in constructing a family of sets that contain the true (unknown) parameter value with a specified probability. In many problems of statistical inference we are not interested only in estimating the parameter or testing some hypothesis concerning the parameter, we also want to get a lower or an upper bound or both, for the real-valued parameter. To do this, we need to construct a confidence interval.

Confidence interval describes how reliable an estimate is. We can calculate the upper and lower confidence limits of the intervals from the observed data. Suppose a dataset x1, . . . , xn is given, modeled as realization of random variables X1, . . . , Xn. Let θ be the parameter of interest, and γ a number between 0 and 1. If there exist sample statistics Ln = g(X1, . . . , Xn) and Un = h(X1, . . . , Xn) such that P(Ln &lt; θ &lt; Un) = γ for every value of θ, then (ln, un), where ln = g(x1, . . . , xn) and un = h(x1, . . . , xn), is called a 100γ% confidence interval for θ. The number γ is called the confidence level. In general, with a normally-distributed sample mean, Ẋ, and with a known value for the standard deviation, σ, a 100(1-α)% confidence interval for the true μ is formed by taking Ẋ ± e, with e = z1-α/2(σ/n1/2), where z1-α/2 is the 100(1-α/2)% cumulative value of the standard normal curve, and n is the number of data values in that column. For example, z1-α/2 equals 1.96 for 95% confidence.

Here two limits are computed from the set of observations, say ln and un and it is claimed with a certain degree of confidence (measured in probabilistic terms) that the true value of γ lies between ln and un. Thus we get an interval (ln and un) which we expect would include the true value of γ(θ). So this type of estimation is called confidence interval estimation. This estimation provides a range of values which the parameter is expected to lie. It generally gives more information than point estimates and are preferred when making inferences. In some way, we can say that point estimation is the opposite of interval estimation.

<text>Operation Sharp Edge was a non-combatant evacuation operation carried out by the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit (22nd MEU) and 26th MEU of the United States Marine Corps in Liberia in 1990 and 1991. The MEUs were supported by Amphibious Squadron Four (Task Force 61) composed of , , , , , , and Fleet Surgical Team TWO.

==Background==
The First Liberian Civil War broke out in December 1989. Increasing violence between political and ethnic factions, including in the capital of Monrovia, had made it impossible for American diplomats and civilians to make safe passage to the U.S. Embassy to exit the country.

==Operation==
The 22nd MEU was composed of Battalion Landing Team (BLT) 2nd Battalion 4th Marines (ground combat element), HMM-261 (REIN) (aviation combat element) and MSSG-22 (logistics combat element).

Company &quot;E&quot; of the 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines executed a pre-dawn vertical envelopment of the besieged U.S. Embassy, with 237 Marines inserted via medium and heavy lift Marine Sikorsky CH-53D Sea Stallion and CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters. The landing zones were under sporadic fire from light, medium and heavy weapons from belligerents. &quot;Hotel&quot; Company secured an extended perimeter around the U.S. Embassy and began evacuation of other allied embassies. Ground elements were supported by U.S. Marine AH-1T SuperCobra helicopters and Marine AV-8B Harrier II attack aircraft. Simultaneously, elements of BLT 2/4 secured landing zones in the surrounding areas, extracting U.S. and foreign nationals. Non-combatants were flown off to and for processing and ultimately Freetown, Sierra Leone. Although BLT 2/4 conducted the initial entry into the embassy, the Marines of BLT 3/8 with 26th MEU arrived on station and continued with the evacuation operations as the 22nd MEU began its retrograde and departure.

Following the initial 20 August 1990 evacuation by the 22nd MEU and her support elements, the MEU was relieved by the Company &quot;K&quot; and a detachment of Headquarters and Support (H&amp;S) personnel of the 3rd Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment (designated as Battalion Landing Team 3/8), a part of the 26th MEU 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit embarked on . Also present were Assault Craft Unit 4 Detachment B, embarked service support group elements from the MEU command element, as well as , which was used to ferry evacuees out of Monrovia. Remaining on station for the next 121 days, the Marines and sailors of &quot;Whidbey Island&quot; evacuated over 1,000 civilian personnel from Monrovia, most of whom were subsequently transported to Freetown, Sierra Leone aboard the accompanying USS &quot;Barnstable County&quot;. The 26th MEU was relieved by FAST Company 5th Platoon of the Marine Corps circa December, 1990, when &quot;Whidbey Island&quot; and her embarked troops steamed to the Mediterranean in anticipated support of the growing Operation Desert Shield. 26 MEU and 22 MEU evacuated a total of 2,439 people between the summer of 1990 and 9 January 1991.

<text>In statistics, interval estimation is the use of sample data to estimate an &quot;interval&quot; of possible values of a parameter of interest. This is in contrast to point estimation, which gives a single value.

The most prevalent forms of interval estimation are &quot;confidence intervals&quot; (a frequentist method) and &quot;credible intervals&quot; (a Bayesian method). Less common forms include &quot;likelihood intervals,&quot; &quot;fiducial intervals,&quot; &quot;tolerance intervals,&quot; and &quot;prediction intervals&quot;. For a non-statistical method, interval estimates can be deduced from fuzzy logic.

== Types ==

=== Confidence intervals ===
Confidence intervals are used to estimate the parameter of interest from a sampled data set, commonly the mean or standard deviation. A confidence interval states there is a 100γ% confidence that the parameter of interest is within a lower and upper bound. A common misconception of confidence intervals is 100γ% of the data set fits within or above/below the bounds, this is referred to as a tolerance interval, which is discussed below.

There are multiple methods used to build a confidence interval, the correct choice depends on the data being analyzed. For a normal distribution with a known variance, one uses the z-table to create an interval where a confidence level of 100γ% can be obtained centered around the sample mean from a data set of n measurements, . For a Binomial distribution, confidence intervals can be approximated using the Wald Approximate Method, Jeffreys interval, and Clopper-Pearson interval. The Jeffrey method can also be used to approximate intervals for a Poisson distribution. If the underlying distribution is unknown, one can utilize bootstrapping to create bounds about the median of the data set.

=== Credible intervals ===

As opposed to a confidence interval, a credible interval requires a prior assumption, modifying the assumption utilizing a Bayes factor, and determining a posterior distribution. Utilizing the posterior distribution, one can determine a 100γ% &quot;probability&quot; the parameter of interest is included, as opposed to the confidence interval where one can be 100γ% &quot;confident&quot; that an estimate is included within an interval.

:formula_1

While a prior assumption is helpful towards providing more data towards building an interval, it removes the objectivity of a confidence interval. A prior will be used to inform a posterior, if unchallenged this prior can lead to incorrect predictions.

The credible interval&#x27;s bounds are variable, unlike the confidence interval. There are multiple methods to determine where the correct upper and lower limits should be located. Common techniques to adjust the bounds of the interval include highest posterior density interval (HPDI), equal-tailed interval, or choosing the center the interval around the mean.

=== Less common forms ===

==== Likelihood-based ====

Utilizes the principles of a likelihood function to estimate the parameter of interest. Utilizing the likelihood-based method, confidence intervals can be found for exponential, Weibull, and lognormal means. Additionally, likelihood-based approaches can give confidence intervals for the standard deviation. It is also possible to create a prediction interval by combining the likelihood function and the future random variable.

==== Fiducial ====
Fiducial inference utilizes a data set, carefully removes the noise and recovers a distribution estimator, Generalized Fiducial Distribution (GFD). Without the use of Bayes&#x27; Theorem, there is no assumption of a prior, much like confidence intervals.
Fiducial inference is a less common form of statistical inference. The founder, R.A. Fisher, who had been developing inverse probability methods, had his own questions about the validity of the process. While fiducial inference was developed in the early twentieth century, the late twentieth century believed that the method was inferior to the frequentist and Bayesian approaches but held an important place in historical context for statistical inference. However, modern-day approaches have generalized the fiducial interval into Generalized Fiducial Inference (GFI), which can be used to estimate discrete and continuous data sets.

==== Tolerance ====

Tolerance intervals use collected data set population to obtain an interval, within tolerance limits, containing 100γ% values. Examples typically used to describe tolerance intervals include manufacturing. In this context, a percentage of an existing product set is evaluated to ensure that a percentage of the population is included within tolerance limits. When creating tolerance intervals, the bounds can be written in terms of an upper and lower tolerance limit, utilizing the sample mean, formula_2, and the sample standard deviation, s.

for two-sided intervals

And in the case of one-sided intervals where the tolerance is required only above or below a critical value,

:formula_4

:formula_5

formula_6 varies by distribution and the number of sides, i, in the interval estimate. In a normal distribution, formula_7 can be expressed as 

:formula_8

Where,

:formula_9 is the critical value of the chi-square distribution utilizing formula_10 degrees of freedom that is exceeded with probability formula_11.

formula_12 is the critical values obtained from the normal distribution.

==== Prediction ====
A prediction interval estimates the interval containing future samples with some confidence, γ. Prediction intervals can be used for both Bayesian and frequentist contexts. These intervals are typically used in regression data sets, but prediction intervals are not used for extrapolation beyond the previous data&#x27;s experimentally controlled parameters.

==== Fuzzy logic ====

Fuzzy logic is used to handle decision-making in a non-binary fashion for artificial intelligence, medical decisions, and other fields. In general, it takes inputs, maps them through fuzzy inference systems, and produces an output decision. This process involves fuzzification, fuzzy logic rule evaluation, and defuzzification. When looking at fuzzy logic rule evaluation, membership functions convert our non-binary input information into tangible variables. These membership functions are essential to predict the uncertainty of the system.

== One-sided vs. two-sided ==

Two-sided intervals estimate a parameter of interest, Θ, with a level of confidence, γ, using a lower (formula_13) and upper bound (formula_14). Examples may include estimating the average height of males in a geographic region or lengths of a particular desk made by a manufacturer. These cases tend to estimate the central value of a parameter. Typically, this is presented in a form similar to the equation below.

:formula_15

Differentiating from the two-sided interval, the one-sided interval utilizes a level of confidence, γ, to construct a minimum or maximum bound which predicts the parameter of interest to γ*100% probability. Typically, a one-sided interval is required when the estimate&#x27;s minimum or maximum bound is not of interest. When concerned about the minimum predicted value of Θ, one is no longer required to find an upper bounds of the estimate, leading to a form reduced form of the two-sided.

:formula_16

As a result of removing the upper bound and maintaining the confidence, the lower-bound (formula_13) will increase. Likewise, when concerned with finding only an upper bound of a parameter&#x27;s estimate, the upper bound will decrease. A one-sided interval is a commonly found in material production&#x27;s quality assurance, where an expected value of a material&#x27;s strength, Θ, must be above a certain minimum value (formula_13) with some confidence (100γ%). In this case, the manufacturer is not concerned with producing a product that is too strong, there is no upper-bound (formula_14).

==Discussion==
When determining the statistical significance of a parameter, it is best to understand the data and its collection methods. Before collecting data, an experiment should be planned such that the sampling error is statistical variability (a random error), as opposed to a statistical bias (a systematic error). After experimenting, a typical first step in creating interval estimates is exploratory analysis plotting using various graphical methods. From this, one can determine the distribution of samples from the data set. Producing interval boundaries with incorrect assumptions based on distribution makes a prediction faulty.

When interval estimates are reported, they should have a commonly held interpretation within and beyond the scientific community. Interval estimates derived from fuzzy logic have much more application-specific meanings.

In commonly occurring situations there should be sets of standard procedures that can be used, subject to the checking and validity of any required assumptions. This applies for both confidence intervals and credible intervals. However, in more novel situations there should be guidance on how interval estimates can be formulated. In this regard confidence intervals and credible intervals have a similar standing but there two differences. First, credible intervals can readily deal with prior information, while confidence intervals cannot. Secondly, confidence intervals are more flexible and can be used practically in more situations than credible intervals: one area where credible intervals suffer in comparison is in dealing with non-parametric models.

There should be ways of testing the performance of interval estimation procedures. This arises because many such procedures involve approximations of various kinds and there is a need to check that the actual performance of a procedure is close to what is claimed. The use of stochastic simulations makes this is straightforward in the case of confidence intervals, but it is somewhat more problematic for credible intervals where prior information needs to be taken properly into account. Checking of credible intervals can be done for situations representing no-prior-information but the check involves checking the long-run frequency properties of the procedures.

Severini (1993) discusses conditions under which credible intervals and confidence intervals will produce similar results, and also discusses both the coverage probabilities of credible intervals and the posterior probabilities associated with confidence intervals.

In decision theory, which is a common approach to and justification for Bayesian statistics, interval estimation is not of direct interest. The outcome is a decision, not an interval estimate, and thus Bayesian decision theorists use a Bayes action: they minimize expected loss of a loss function with respect to the entire posterior distribution, not a specific interval.

== Applications ==
Applications of confidence intervals are used to solve a variety of problems dealing with uncertainty. Katz (1975) proposes various challenges and benefits for utilizing interval estimates in legal proceedings. For use in medical research, Altmen (1990) discusses the use of confidence intervals and guidelines towards using them. In manufacturing, it is also common to find interval estimates estimating a product life, or to evaluate the tolerances of a product. Meeker and Escobar (1998) present methods to analyze reliability data under parametric and nonparametric estimation, including the prediction of future, random variables (prediction intervals).

<text>Herbert Butros Khaury (April 12, 1932 November 30, 1996), also known as Herbert Buckingham Khaury, and known professionally as Tiny Tim, was an American musician and musical archivist. He is especially known for his 1968 hit recording of &quot;Tiptoe Through the Tulips&quot;, a cover of the popular song &quot;Tiptoe Through the Tulips with Me&quot; from the 1929 musical &quot;Gold Diggers of Broadway&quot;. Tiny Tim was renowned for his wide vocal range, in particular his far-reaching falsetto.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Tiny Tim was born Herbert Khaury in Manhattan, New York City, on April 12, 1932. His mother Tillie (), a Polish-Jewish garment worker, was the daughter of a rabbi. She had immigrated from Brest-Litovsk, present-day Belarus, as a teen in 1914. His father, Butros Khaury, was a textile worker from Beirut, present-day Lebanon, and the son of a Maronite Catholic priest. Tiny Tim himself was a devout Catholic.

Khaury displayed an interest in music at a very young age. At the age of five, his father gave him a vintage wind-up gramophone and a 78-RPM record of &quot;Beautiful Ohio&quot; by Henry Burr. Khaury has passionately praised Burr, telling Johnny Carson that &quot;the wonderful Henry Burr&#x27;s&quot; circa-1915 records inspired his own singing style. He would sit for hours listening to the record. At the age of six, he began teaching himself guitar. By his pre-teen years, he developed a passion for records, specifically those from the 1900s through the 1930s. He began spending most of his free time at the New York Public Library, reading about the history of the phonograph industry and its first recording artists. He researched sheet music, often making photographic copies to take home to learn, a hobby he continued for his entire life. He grew up in the Washington Heights neighborhood in Manhattan, where he attended George Washington High School.

In 1945, while recovering from appendix removal, he read the Bible and listened to music on the radio. After his recovery, he rarely left his room except to go to school, where he was described as a mediocre student. He dropped out of high school after continuously repeating his sophomore year, taking a series of menial jobs. Around this time, he discovered he could sing in a high register while listening to Rudy Vallée and taught himself to play ukulele using an Arthur Godfrey method book. He would later describe this period of his life as a &quot;religious experience&quot;.

===The Singing Canary===
By the early 1950s, Tiny Tim had landed a job as a messenger at the New York office of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, where he became ever more fascinated with the entertainment industry. He then entered a local talent show and sang &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot; in his newly discovered falsetto. He started performing at dance club amateur nights under different names, such as &quot;Texarkana Tex&quot;, &quot;Judas K. Foxglove&quot;, &quot;Vernon Castle&quot;, and &quot;Emmett Swink.&quot; To stand out as a performer, he wore wild clothing, grew his hair long and wore pasty white face makeup, partly inspired by Rudolph Valentino.&lt;ref name=&quot;gettyimages/1371377379&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; His mother did not understand Herbert&#x27;s change in appearance and was intending to take her now-twentysomething son to see a psychiatrist at Bellevue Hospital until his father stepped in. 

In 1959, he performed as &quot;Larry Love, the Singing Canary&quot; at Hubert&#x27;s Museum and Live Flea Circus in New York City&#x27;s Times Square. While there, he signed with a manager who sent him on unpaid auditions throughout Greenwich Village. At this stage he began performing the song that would later become his signature, &quot;Tiptoe Through the Tulips&quot;. In 1963, he landed his first paid gig at Page 3, a lesbian-run club on the corner of Charles Street and Seventh Avenue,&lt;ref name=&quot;hughryan/lesbian-for-mafia&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; playing six hours a night and six nights a week for $96 per month. For the next two years, he performed as &quot;Dary Dover&quot; and later &quot;Sir Timothy Timms&quot;. After a show in which he was booked to follow a &quot;midget&quot; act, his manager George King decided to bill him as &quot;Tiny Tim&quot; - a name which stuck.

Throughout the 1960s, Tiny Tim made numerous appearances in film and television. He had a cameo in Jack Smith&#x27;s &quot;Normal Love&quot; from 1963. He also featured in 1968&#x27;s &quot;You Are What You Eat&quot;, singing the Ronettes&#x27; &quot;Be My Baby&quot; and Sonny and Cher&#x27;s &quot;I Got You Babe&quot; as a duet with Eleanor Barooshian, in which Tiny took the Cher part. This led to a booking on the comedy variety show &quot;Rowan and Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;. Co-host Dan Rowan announced that &quot;Laugh-In&quot; &quot;(believed) in showcasing new talent&quot; before introducing Tiny Tim, who arrived on stage with a ukulele in a shopping bag and sang &quot;A-Tisket, A-Tasket&quot; and &quot;On the Good Ship Lollipop&quot; while an apparently genuinely dumbfounded Dick Martin watched. He sang &quot;Tiptoe Through the Tulips&quot; on both his second and third appearances on the show.

===&quot;God Bless Tiny Tim&quot; and peak of popularity===

His debut &quot;God Bless Tiny Tim&quot; was released by Reprise Records in 1968. &quot;Tiptoe Through the Tulips&quot; was released as a single and reached No. 17 on the Billboard chart. &quot;Tiny Tim&#x27;s 2nd Album&quot; followed in 1968, featuring a portrait of Tiny Tim and his parents on the cover. This was followed by 1969&#x27;s &quot;For All My Little Friends&quot;, a collection of children&#x27;s songs that received a 1970 Grammy Award nomination. Charting singles from this era included &quot;Bring Back Those Rockabye Baby Days&quot; at No. 95 and &quot;Great Balls of Fire&quot; at No. 85 in 1968 and 1969.

During this era of Tiny&#x27;s mass popularity, many pundits and journalists debated whether the &quot;character&quot; that Tiny Tim presented was just an orchestrated act or the real thing.

On December 17, 1969, Tiny Tim married Miss Vicki on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; with 40 million people watching. At the time, this was one of the most watched television events ever.

After his career highlights in the late 1960s, Tiny Tim&#x27;s television appearances dwindled, and his popularity began to wane. He continued to play concerts, making several lucrative appearances in Las Vegas. In August 1970, he performed &quot;There&#x27;ll Always Be an England&quot; to an estimated 600,000 people at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970. The UK press announced that he had stolen the show &quot;without a single electric instrument&quot;.

When his recording contract ended with Reprise, he founded his own record label and named it Vic Tim Records, as a pun on the combination of his wife&#x27;s name with that of his own. &quot;Tiny Tim&quot;, a biography by Harry Stein, was published in 1976 by Playboy Press.

===Martin Sharp collaborations===

In January 1979, Australian artist Martin Sharp brought Tiny Tim to Luna Park in Sydney, Australia to set the world record for the longest non-stop professional singing marathon. This was the culmination of a longstanding collaboration between Tiny Tim and Sharp, who had been openly obsessed with him for years, bringing him to Australia several times, producing his recordings and painting his portrait over and over in different styles. The marathon performance was filmed by Sharp&#x27;s camera crew and ran for over two hours and seventeen minutes, successfully setting a world record.

When the 1979 Ghost Train fire occurred at Luna Park five months later, Sharp became convinced that the fire was in some way theologically linked to Tiny Tim&#x27;s performance and also set out to prove it was deliberately lit as an arson attempt. All of this became the basis for the film &quot;Street of Dreams&quot;, which serves as both a biography of Tiny Tim and an exploration of Luna Park and the fire. Sharp never finished editing &quot;Street of Dreams&quot; in his lifetime and the film remains incomplete, though a rough cut was released for film festival screenings in 1988 and that version continues to circulate online.

Sharp went on to produce many of Tiny Tim&#x27;s later records including &quot;Rock&quot;, &quot;Chameleon&quot; and &quot;Keeping My Troubles to Myself&quot;, and also brought Tiny Tim to perform in Australia several more times throughout the 1980s and 1990s. His all-consuming fixation on Tiny Tim, Luna Park and the fire continued until his death in 2013.

In 2014, standalone footage of the complete marathon performance was released on streaming services as &quot;The Non-Stop Luna Park Marathon&quot; by Planet Blue Pictures. As of 2023, it can be viewed for free on Vimeo.

A large mural of Tiny Tim with tulip themes painted by Sharp hangs in the Macquarie University Student Council.

==Personal life==
Tiny Tim was married three times. He had one daughter from his first marriage to then-17-year-old Victoria Budingerwhom he called &quot;Miss Vicki&quot;at age 37. Tiny Tim and Victoria Budinger divorced eight years later. Budinger subsequently had several marriages. He married Jan Alweiss (&quot;Miss Jan&quot;) in 1984, and Susan Marie Gardner (&quot;Miss Sue&quot;) in 1995. Gardner was a 39-year-old Harvard graduate and a fan of Tim&#x27;s since she was 12.

==Death==

On September 28, 1996, Khaury recorded a video interview at the Montague Bookmill. He later suffered a heart attack at a ukulele festival at the nearby Montague Grange Hall in Montague, Massachusetts. He was hospitalized at the nearby Franklin County Medical Center in Greenfield for approximately three weeks before being discharged with strong admonitions not to perform again because of his health, weight, and dietary needs for his diabetic and heart conditions. He ignored the advice.

On November 30, 1996, Khaury was playing at a gala benefit hosted by the Women&#x27;s Club of Minneapolis. He had let his third wife (&quot;Miss Sue&quot;) know before the show that he was not feeling well, but did not want to disappoint his fans. Before the start of his performance, most of the audience had left. In the middle of performing his last number of the evening — a rendition of his hit, &quot;Tiptoe Through the Tulips&quot; — he suffered another heart attack on stage. His wife asked him if he was feeling all right, and he said he was not; she was helping him back to their table where he collapsed, and never regained consciousness. EMTs performed on-site CPR and transported him to Hennepin County Medical Center, where after repeated revival attempts, he was pronounced dead at 11:20 pm. His remains are entombed in a mausoleum in Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis.

==Posthumous releases==
In 2000, the Rhino Handmade label released the posthumous &quot;Tiny Tim Live at the Royal Albert Hall&quot;. This recording had been made in 1968 at the height of Tiny Tim&#x27;s fame, but Reprise Records never released it. The limited-number CD sold out and was reissued on Rhino&#x27;s regular label. In 2009, the Collector&#x27;s Choice label released &quot;I&#x27;ve Never Seen a Straight Banana: Rare Moments Vol. 1&quot;, produced and recorded by Richard Barone in 1976. The album was a collection of rare recordings of some of Tiny Tim&#x27;s favorite songs from 1878 through the 1930s, along with some of his own compositions.

In 2009, it was reported that Justin Martell was preparing a biography of Tiny Tim, released in 2016 under the title &quot;Eternal Troubadour: The Improbable Life of Tiny Tim&quot;. Martell is called one of America&#x27;s &quot;foremost experts&quot; on Tiny Tim; he contributed liner notes to &quot;I&#x27;ve Never Seen a Straight Banana&quot; and the 2011 Tiny Tim compilation LP &quot;Tiny Tim: Lost &amp; Found 1963–1974 (Rare &amp; Unreleased)&quot;, released on Secret Seven Records.

In 2013, a biography of Tiny Tim was released in two editions. &quot;Tiny Tim: Tiptoe Through A Lifetime&quot; was released July 16, 2013, and is by Lowell Tarling (author) and Martin Sharp (illustrator). Ship To Shore PhonoCo followed up &quot;Lost &amp; Found Vol 1&quot; with a &quot;Vol 2&quot; featuring Tiny Tim&#x27;s 1974 live recording of &quot;(Nobody Else Can Love Me Like) My Old Tomato Can&quot; on a limited edition wax cylinder.

In 2016, Ship To Shore PhonoCo released &quot;Tiny Tim&#x27;s America&quot;, a collection of demos recorded by Tiny Tim in 1974 and finished in 2015 with overdubs overseen by producer Richard Barone and Tiny Tim&#x27;s cousin Eddie Rabin. The album was subtitled &quot;Rare Moments Vol. 2&quot; and was presented as a spiritual sequel to 2009&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ve Never Seen A Straight Banana: Rare Moments Vol 1.&quot;

In 2020, Swedish journalist and documentary film-maker Johan von Sydow released the documentary film &quot;Tiny Tim: King for a Day&quot;.

==Honors and awards==
Tiny Tim was honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, recognizing performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Journalist Steve Marsh remarked that receiving a star &quot;might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis.&quot;

<text>Charles Ingerham Peddle (November 25, 1937 – December 15, 2019) was an American electrical engineer best known as the main designer of the MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor, the single-board computer, and its successor, the Commodore PET personal computer, both based on the 6502.

==Biography==
Peddle was born in Bangor, Maine, United States on November 25, 1937. He worked in a radio station while in high school.

In 1955, Peddle joined the United States Marine Corps. He attended the University of Maine where he earned a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree in engineering physics. Afterward, he went to work for General Electric working with time-sharing systems.

In 1973, Peddle worked at Motorola on developing the 6800 processor.

Peddle recognized a market for a very low price microprocessor and began to champion such a design to complement the $300 Motorola 6800. His efforts were frustrated by Motorola management and he was told to drop the project. He then left for MOS Technology, where he headed the design of the 650x family of processors; these were made as a $25 answer to the Motorola 6800. The most famous member of the 650x series was the 6502, developed in 1975, which was priced at 15% of the cost of an Intel 8080, and was subsequently used in many commercial products, including the Apple II, PET, VIC-20, Atari 8-bit computers, arcade video games, Oric computers, and the BBC Micro. The Atari 2600 uses the closely related 6507 CPU, the Commodore 64 uses the also closely related derivative 6510, and the Nintendo Entertainment System uses a custom ASIC which includes an altered 6502 core (with the decimal mode deleted).

In 1980, Peddle left MOS Technology, together with Commodore Business Machines (CBM) financer Chris Fish, to found Sirius Systems Technology. There, Peddle designed the Victor 9000 personal computer.

==Legacy==
Peddle, along with the 6502&#x27;s co-designer Bill Mensch, are regarded as personal computer pioneers, in that both the 6502 technology and business model were instrumental in helping launch the personal computer revolution. After Peddle&#x27;s death, Mensch wrote in memoriam.
