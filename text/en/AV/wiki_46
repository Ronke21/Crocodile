<text>The Philippine Army Air Corps () was created in 1935 as the air component of the Philippine Army. It was the predecessor of the Philippine Air Force, created in 1947.

== History ==
The Air Corps was created by the Philippine National Assembly&#x27;s National Defense Act of 1935 in its first legislative act.

General Douglas MacArthur, convinced by his friend Philippine President-elect Manuel L. Quezon and with President Roosevelt&#x27;s agreement to leave his position as Chief of Staff, become Military Adviser to the Commonwealth Government in 1935. MacArthur was given wide authority to deal directly with the United States Secretary of War, his successor as the Army Chief of Staff and the United States Army Philippine Department and its commander Major General Lucius R. Holbrook who had been directed that his most important peacetime mission was assisting MacArthur in forming a Philippine force capable of defending the islands. MacArthur selected Majors Dwight D. Eisenhower and James B. Ord as his assistants who, with a special committee at the Army War College, prepared plans to form the national defense of the Philippine Commonwealth with a completion target of independence in 1946. That plan called for a small regular army with divisions of about 7,500 men, conscription with all men between twenty-one and fifty years of age eligible, with a ten-year training program to build a reserve army, a small air force and a fleet of torpedo boats capable of repelling an enemy.

The air corps was targeted to have by independence in 1946 approximately 100 bombers and additional tactical support aircraft to be used with the Off Shore Patrol of torpedo boats in coastal defense. When war came the corps had around 40 aircraft and 100 pilots, 500 personnel, and six squadrons. On 15 August 1941, the PAAC was inducted into the United States Army and incorporated into the Far East Air Force, with 141 pilots, 17 ground officers, 1,200 enlisted men, and 64 aircraft, with Maj. Basilio Fernando as its Commanding Officer. No less than Gen. MacArthur himself was the inducting officer at the Nichols Airfield in Pasay outside Manila.

The first Philippine Army airfield (Zablan Airfield) was built outside of Manila, Luzon in 1935. At this time only three pilot trainers were available in the Philippines. Courses in flying and technical training were given in the mainland United States to selected students. After the war the airfield was closed and became Camp Emilio Aguinaldo.

On 31 July 1941 the corps consisted of 2,132 enlisted troops, under the command of 275 officers:
*Headquarters (109)
*U.S. 4th Composite Group (1,393)
*U.S. 20th Air Base Group (842)
*Tow Target Detachment (42)
*Weather Detachment (21)

===World War 2===
On 8 December 1941, despite receiving the news on the attack on Pearl Harbor early in the morning, the United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE) and its air component, Far East Air Force (FAEF), were caught by surprise by bombers and fighters of the Imperial Japanese Army from Takao Airfield and Navy&#x27;s Tainan Air Group from Tainan, Formosa, hitting targets in Baguio, Iba Airfield, and Clark Airfield. By the end of the day, the FAEF&#x27;s aircraft inventory was reduced by half, with only a few squadrons surviving the initial raid, including the PAAC 6th Pursuit Squadron.

On 9 December, units of the PAAC attached to the Southern Luzon Force were ordered to do reconnaissance flight towards the South China Sea for any possible amphibious landing by the Japanese on the Batangas coastline.

The PAAC had its baptism of fire on 10 December. While the officers and men of the 6th Pursuit Squadron was having lunch, general quarters was sounded. Capt. Jesus Villamor, along with Lieutenants Godofredo Juliano, Geronimo Aclan, Alberto Aranzaso, and Jose Gozar met another wave of Mitsubishi G3M &quot;Nell&quot; bombers and Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters over the skies of Zablan Airfield and Pasig with their Boeing P-26 Peashooters. The 6th Pursuit Squadron claimed 4 kills, one Mitsubishi Nell and 3 Zeros. Two of these were to the credit of Capt. Villamor. Another notable pilot was Lt. Jose Gozar. When his guns jammed, he instead attempted an aerial ramming of a Mitsubishi Nell. Lt. Albert Aranzaso followed suit.

The following day, 11 December, the 6th Pursuit Squadron moved to Batangas Airfield north of Batangas City. On 12 December, a force of 27 bombers and 17 fighters targeted Batangas Airfield, and on this day in Philippine military history a Filipino military aviator died in the line of duty. Lt. Cesar Basa was on patrol has been flying for two hours and only had 15 minutes of fuel left when the Japanese arrived. Despite being outnumbered 7–1, Lt. Basa engaged the enemy and was still able to land his damaged aircraft in Nichols Airfield. However he was fatally wounded due to ground strafing by a Mitsubishi A6M Zero. Lt. Victor Osias tried to help his wingman, but Lt. Basa died in his arms.

The 6th Pursuit Squadron returned to Nichols Airfield on 13 December with 4 remaining P-26s, and on the following day another Japanese raid came, and Lt. Gozar was the only pilot who was able to meet the Japanese bombers and fighters. Lt. Gozar was able to survive the encounter against three Japanese Zeros with one unconfirmed kill, and land his battered aircraft.

While greatly outclassed and outnumbered, the accomplishment of the 6th Pursuit Squadron has become of a legend and a source of encouragement among the ground forces and the civilians who witnessed their defense over the skies of Luzon. On 15 December Capt. Villamor, Lt. Gozar, and Capt. Colin Kelly of the 14th Bombardment Squadron posthumously, were awarded by Gen. MacArthur the Distinguished Service Cross for their defense of the airspace above Manila. Lt. Godofredo Juliano on the other hand received a Gold Cross, and Lt. Aranzaso was awarded with the Silver Star.

Upon activation of War Plan Orange, the 6th Pursuit Squadron and the rest of the PAAC were ordered to destroy their aircraft inventory. Capt. Villamor and his unit joined the rest of the USAFF on a strategic retreat to Bataan and transformed their mission to air defense. The PAAC from hereon would take up infantry and air defense roles. Villamor would join Gen. MacArthur and Pres. Manuel L. Quezon on the ferry to Fort Mills on Corregidor Island on 24 December 1941. Capt. Villamor and his unit were still hoping to receive new aircraft from Australia. However, the shipment of the Pensacola Convoy never came through.

On 9 February 1942, Capt. Villamor conducted a reconnaissance mission over occupied Cavite in a PT-13 escorted by four American P-40 Warhawks. No sooner, 6 Japanese Zeros appeared and tangled with the FAEF aircraft. Capt. Villamor&#x27;s aircraft was damaged but he was still able to land it safely. One P-40 was lost at the cost of 4 Zeros. Capt. Villamor&#x27;s mission proved to be a success as the films were delivered to G-2 Intelligence. The information was collated with the ground observers&#x27; reports, and counterbattery fire was put into effect.

The four months siege of Bataan culminated on 9 April 1942, and about 80,000 emaciated and sick Filipinos and American POWs, including the surviving men of the PAAC, were committed to the infamous Bataan Death March. The 60 mile march ended at the POW Camp in Camp O&#x27;Donnell, Tarlac. Some of the members of the PAAC who were assigned to Corregidor Island were attached to the 4th Marine Regiment, and met the Japanese at the beaches during the Battle of Corregidor.

The Filipino POWs in Capas, Tarlac were released by August 1942, and the former members of the PAAC either transitioned back to civilian life, collaborated with the Japanese-sponsored Philippine government, or joined the underground guerilla movement. Famous of this was Capt. Villamor&#x27;s escape to Australia and finding himself assigned to the Allied Intelligence Bureau as one of its operatives.

<text>André Gerardus Hazes (30 June 1951 – 23 September 2004) was a Dutch singer and actor. As an accomplished levenslied singer, Hazes recorded 36 studio and live albums, and 55 singles prior to his death in 2004. His music is still well-known in the Netherlands and Flanders, known for sentimental and simple lyrics.

His biggest hits include &quot;Eenzame Kerst&quot; (1976), &quot;Een Beetje Verliefd&quot; (1981), &quot;Ik Meen &#x27;t&quot; (1985), &quot;Wij Houden van Oranje&quot; (1988), &quot;Bloed, Zweet en Tranen&quot; (2002), &quot;Zij Gelooft in Mij&quot; (Originally from 1981, re-recorded and released in 1999, re-released after his death in 2004) and &quot;Blijf Bij Mij&quot; (a virtual duet with Gerard Joling, 2007).

==Biography==

===Early years===

Hazes was born in 1951 in Amsterdam&#x27;s De Pijp area as the son of Joop Hazes and Miep Hazes (né Botschuiver). Hazes had four brothers and a sister. At the age of eight, he was discovered at the Albert Cuyp Market by comedian Johnny Kraaykamp and made his television debut on &quot;Weekendshow&quot; in 1959, where he sang a song in fake Italian, &quot;Piove&quot;. Two singles, &quot;Droomschip&quot; and &quot;Juanita&quot;, were released but did not lead to a career in music. Several requests for performances were received, but these were rejected by Kraaijkamp so that Hazes could focus on school. Hazes&#x27; father had received a fine for his son&#x27;s three absences from school for the television program. Because of his performance, Hazes received a visit from the famous singer Caterina Valente at home in November.

===1970s===
Hazes pursued several odd jobs (ordinary seaman, flower delivery boy, chimney sweep, butcher&#x27;s apprentice, bicycle repairman, trench digger, construction worker, demolition man, market salesman, and disc jockey) before building up a reputation as a singing barman in his hometown, in café De Krommert on the Witte de Withstraat. In 1976 he wrote and demoed &quot;Eenzame Kerst&quot;, a song about a prisoner&#x27;s lonely Christmas, for singer Willy Alberti hoping that he would record it; Alberti suggested that Hazes record it himself. The single sold 70,000 copies in three weeks and made him an instant star.

An album, &quot;Zo is het leven&quot; (&quot;Such is life&quot;) was released in 1977 and reached the Dutch top 20; extracted singles &quot;Mama&quot; and &quot;De Vlieger&quot; didn&#x27;t chart although the latter became a Dutch standard (and a top 40 hit second time round) in years to come. Still, he returned to bartending.

===1980s===
In 1980 he signed a contract with EMI, and soon after that his career started to take off. &quot;Een Vriend&quot; (&quot;A Friend&quot;) and &quot;Een Beetje Verliefd&quot; (&quot;A Little in Love)&quot; were both top ten hits in 1981, produced by his best friend Tim Griek.

In 1981 Hazes was awarded the Zilveren Harp (Silver Harp) for his album &quot;Gewoon André&quot; (&quot;Just André&quot;) which sold 500,000 copies and was certified five times platinum in its first year of release and two more times two years later. Three of the album&#x27;s songs, including &quot;Een Beetje Verliefd&quot;, were written for Hazes by Aart Mol and his colleagues from the 1970s band Catapult, who had formed the production company Cat Music, which would write a total of 39 songs for Hazes. 1982 was the year of his great concert in the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam.

During his heyday Hazes also had a sideline as an actor; in 1982 he played a restaurant owner in the Inspector General-inspired movie &quot;De Boezemvriend&quot; (starring his comedian namesake Andre van Duin), in 1983 he appeared in the comedy series &quot;Zoals U Wenst Mevrouw&quot; (&quot;As you wish Madam&quot;) as a down-and-out taking a gardening job under false pretenses and singing new lyrics to recent hits. He also appeared in commercials for toasts (as an Italian singer) and custard (as a football-playing son of singer/actress Joke Bruijs). Meanwhile Hazes&#x27; backing musicians at the time recorded a parody medley for their notorious comedy music project Rubberen Robbie.

In 1986 Hazes released two albums; the first featured Italian covers (including &quot;Volare&quot;, &quot;Bueno Sera&quot; and a new version of &quot;Piove&quot; which he first sang in his childhood days) and was dedicated to the memory of Willy Alberti. The second featured translated versions of Peter Maffay&#x27;s &quot;Du&quot; and Gloria Gaynor&#x27;s &quot;I Will Survive&quot;.

In February 1988 record producer and best friend, Tim Griek, died in a car accident. Hazes dedicated the album &quot;Liefde, leven, geven&quot; to Griek&#x27;s memory.

In 1988 he sang the song &quot;Wij houden van Oranje&quot; (&quot;We love Orange&quot;—Orange being the national colour of the Netherlands and also a nickname for the Netherlands national football team and in general all sports teams) for the football championships. The song became very popular as the Netherlands won the European Championships in the same year.

In 1989 his career was stalled after several years without record releases and to revive it record company EMI approached Hazes for a new album, asking him what he wanted to do next. EMI offered him a free hand and full control if he decided to revitalize his career. He responded by recording the bilingual album &quot;Dit is wat ik wil&quot; (&quot;This is what I want&quot;), a blues and rock &#x27;n roll album featuring many contemporary rock artists like Herman Brood and Jan Akkerman. Extracted singles are &quot;De Gokker&quot; (&quot;The Gambler&quot;) and &quot;Jammer&quot; (&quot;Crying Time&quot;, converted into an earth pollution-song); the latter was backed by &quot;Working in a Coal Mine&quot;.

Joe Bourne, an American singer living in the Netherlands at the time, released an English-language version of &quot;Een Beetje Verliefd&quot; for his tribute album &quot;Bourne in Holland&quot;.

===1990s===
1999 saw the release of a hit documentary on Hazes, named &quot;Zij Gelooft in Mij&quot; (&quot;She Has Faith in Me&quot;) after his translation of the Kenny Rogers song &quot;She Has Faith in Me&quot;. The film portrayed the singer as a tragic man of simple ways, a well-meaning but clueless father and lousy husband tormented by stage fright and a propensity towards drinking. Hazes had mixed feelings about the film, but most viewers saw a man who had remained true to his humble background and whose raw emotional songs were genuinely felt. It earned him something of a cult status outside of his loyal fan base, with the cultural establishment taking him in a somewhat uncomfortable embrace.

Hazes was known to live unhealthily, beer being his main vice. He himself once said: &quot;If it wasn&#x27;t for the fame, I&#x27;d be a full-blown alcoholic.&quot; In fact, he already was; he just managed to integrate this well into his life.

===2000s===
In May 2002 Hazes briefly entered local politics by getting elected to the municipal council of De Ronde Venen for the local political party Ronde Venen Belang. He quickly became the focus of criticism because after a month he hadn&#x27;t shown up yet for any meetings. After being criticized and ridiculed in national newspapers, Hazes did show for a council meeting in June 2002, but shortly before it started Hazes suffered a mental breakdown and was unable to attend. Four days later he announced his resignation and offered his seat to the party.

On 23 September 2004 Hazes died of cardiac arrest.

In an interview with &quot;de Volkskrant&quot;, he made the remark that he knew as a child that when he died, he would make the television news. Not only did that happen, four days after he died, a startling crowd of about 48,000 attended a memorial ceremony in his honour at the Amsterdam Arena stadium. Over 8 million viewers followed the event which was broadcast live on Dutch and Belgian television. Hazes was cremated the day after.

On 29 September 2004 the single &quot;Zij Gelooft in Mij&quot; was re-released and was his first No. 1 hit in the Dutch Top 40.
In 2007, one of his songs, the hit &quot;Blijf Bij Mij&quot; (&quot;Stay With Me&quot;), reached the number one position in the Dutch Top 40 again. This song was sung with Gerard Joling. &quot;Blijf Bij Mij&quot; is a cover from the song &quot;Forse&quot; by the Italian singer Pupo.

Exactly one year after his death, in accordance with his wishes, Hazes&#x27; remaining ashes were distributed over a couple of skyrockets, which were then launched into the sky by his surviving relatives. On the same day, his statue was unveiled in De Pijp, Amsterdam, near the singer&#x27;s birthplace.

==Personal life==
Hazes married Annie Dijkstra in 1974. She had given birth to a daughter, Nathalie, in 1973. The couple divorced in 1979. After their divorce, Dijkstra and Hazes had a legal battle involving the rights to sell a biography of Hazes; Dijkstra lost the case. After the divorce from André, Dijkstra married his older brother Joop, who went viral in 2023 with the song &quot;Mijn broertje&quot;.

In 1981, Hazes married Ellen Wolf. She gave birth to a son, Melvin, in 1982. The couple divorced in 1990; Wolf later died of breast cancer in 2005, at age 47.

In 1991, Hazes married his third wife, longtime girlfriend Rachel van Galen. Hazes was Van Galen&#x27;s senior by nineteen years; she gave birth to his third and fourth child, daughter Roxeanne (1993) and son André Jr. (1994). Hazes remained married to his third wife until his death in 2004.
After his death, a conflict arose between Hazes&#x27; first two children. They accused his third wife Rachel of commercially exploiting Hazes&#x27; death for her personal gain. 
Hazes&#x27; youngest two children, Roxeanne and André Jr., released a cover album (&quot;Voor Jou, Van Jou&quot; [&quot;For You, From You&quot;]) in 2010, containing the most famous of Hazes&#x27; songs. They have gone on to become successful artists in their own right.

In 2016, Hazes&#x27; first grandson was born. He is the son of Nathalie. In 2016, Hazes&#x27; second grandson André III was born. He is the son of André Jr.

<text>Gaius Sallustius Crispus, usually anglicised as Sallust (, ; –35 BC), was a historian and politician of the Roman Republic from a plebeian family. Probably born at Amiternum in the country of the Sabines, Sallust became a partisan of Julius Caesar (100 to 44 BC), circa 50s BC. He is the earliest known Latin-language Roman historian with surviving works to his name, of which &quot;Conspiracy of Catiline&quot; on the eponymous conspiracy, &quot;The Jugurthine War&quot; on the eponymous war, and the &quot;Histories&quot; (of which only fragments survive) remain extant. As a writer, Sallust was primarily influenced by the works of the 5th-century BC Greek historian Thucydides. During his political career he amassed great and ill-gotten wealth from his governorship of Africa.

== Life and career ==

Sallust was probably born in Amiternum in Central Italy, though Eduard Schwartz takes the view that Sallust&#x27;s birthplace was Rome. His birth date is calculated from the report of Jerome&#x27;s &quot;Chronicon&quot;. But Ronald Syme suggests that Jerome&#x27;s date has to be adjusted because of his carelessness, and suggests 87 BC as a more correct date. However, Sallust&#x27;s birth is widely dated at 86 BC, and the &quot;Kleine Pauly Encyclopedia&quot; takes 1 October 86 BC as the birthdate. Michael Grant cautiously offers 80s BC.

There is no information about Sallust&#x27;s parents or family, except for Tacitus&#x27; mention of his sister. The &quot;Sallustii&quot; were a provincial noble family of Sabine origin. They belonged to the equestrian order and had full Roman citizenship. During the Social War Sallust&#x27;s parents hid in Rome, because Amiternum was under threat of siege by rebelling Italic tribes. Because of this Sallust could have been raised in Rome. He received a very good education.

=== Early career ===

After an ill-spent youth, Sallust entered public life and may have won election as quaestor in 55 BC. However, the evidence is unclear; some scholars suggest he never held the post. The &quot;earliest certain information&quot; on his career is his term as plebeian tribune in 52 BC, the year in which the followers of Milo killed Clodius. During his year, Sallust supported the prosecution of Milo. He also organised &quot;ferocious street demonstrations&quot; to exert public pressure on Cicero, intimidating him into &quot;giving a substandard performance&quot; when defending Milo at his trial, seeing Milo leave the city into exile. In this year, he, with the other ten tribunes, all supported a law to permit Caesar to stand for a second consulship in absentia.

Syme suggests that Sallust, because of his position in Milo&#x27;s trial, did not originally support Caesar. According to one inscription, some Sallustius (with unclear praenomen) was a proquaestor in Syria in 50 BC under Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus. Mommsen identified this Sallustius with Sallust the historian, but Broughton argued that Sallust the historian would not have been an assistant to Caesar&#x27;s adversary or, as an ex-plebeian tribune, have taken the lowly title &quot;legatus pro quaestore&quot;.

Sallust&#x27;s political affiliation is unclear in this early period, but after he was expelled from the senate in 50 BC by Appius Claudius Pulcher (then serving as censor), he joined Caesar. He was removed on grounds of immorality, but this was likely a pretext for his opposition to Milo during his tribunate.

=== Caesar&#x27;s civil war ===
During the civil war from 49 to 45 BC, Sallust was a Caesarian partisan, but his role was not significant; his name is not mentioned in the dictator&#x27;s &quot;Commentarii de Bello Civili&quot;. Plutarch reported that Sallust dined with Caesar, Hirtius, Oppius, Balbus and Sulpicius Rufus on the night after Caesar&#x27;s crossing the Rubicon into Italy in early January. In 49 BC, Sallust was moved to Illyricum and probably commanded at least one legion there after the failure of Publius Cornelius Dolabella and Gaius Antonius. This campaign was unsuccessful. In 48 BC, he was probably made quaestor by Caesar, automatically restoring his seat in the senate. In late summer 47 BC, a group of soldiers rebelled near Rome, demanding their discharge and payment for service. Sallust, as &quot;praetor designatus&quot; and serving as one of Caesar&#x27;s legates, with several other senators, was sent to persuade the soldiers to abstain, but the rebels killed two senators, and Sallust narrowly escaped death.

In 46 BC, he served as a praetor and accompanied Caesar in his African campaign, which ended in another defeat of the remaining Pompeians at Thapsus. Sallust did not participate in military operations directly, but he commanded several ships and organized supply through the Kerkennah Islands. As a reward for his services, Sallust was appointed proconsular governor of Africa Nova, either from 46–45 or for early 44 BC. It is not clear why: Sallust was not a skilled general; the province was militarily significant. Moreover, his successors as governor were experienced military men. However, Sallust successfully managed the organization of supply and transportation, and these qualities could have determined Caesar&#x27;s choice. As governor he was so corrupt and avaricious that – on his return in late 45 or early 44 BC – only Caesar&#x27;s dictatorial influence enabled him to escape conviction on charges of corruption and extortion. On his return to Rome he purchased and began laying out in great splendour the famous gardens on the Quirinal known as the Gardens of Sallust (), which were later inherited by the emperors.

=== Retirement ===

Due to those charges and without prospects for advancement, he devoted himself to writing history, presenting his historical writings as an extension of public life to record achievements for future generations. His political life influenced his histories, which produced in him a &quot;deep bitterness toward the elite&quot;, with &quot;few heroes in his surviving writings&quot;. He also further developed his gardens, upon which he spent much of his accumulated wealth. According to Jerome, Sallust later became the second husband of Cicero&#x27;s ex-wife Terentia. However, prominent scholars of Roman prosopography such as Ronald Syme believe this is a legend. According to Procopius, when Alaric&#x27;s invading army entered Rome they burned Sallust&#x27;s house.

== Works ==
Sallust&#x27;s monographs of the Catiline conspiracy (&quot;De coniuratione Catilinae&quot; or &quot;Bellum Catilinae&quot;) and the Jugurthine War (&quot;Bellum Jugurthinum&quot;) have come down to us complete, together with fragments of his larger and most important work (&quot;Historiae&quot;), a history of Rome from 78 to 67 BC.

His brief monographs – his work on Catiline, for example, is shorter than the shortest of Livy&#x27;s volumes – were the first books of their form attested at Rome.

=== &quot;Catiline&#x27;s War&quot; ===
The monograph was probably written . Some historians, however, give it an earlier date of composition, perhaps as early at 50 BC as an unpublished pamphlet which was reworked and published after the civil wars. It shows no traces of personal recollections on the conspiracy, perhaps indicating the Sallust was out of the city on military service at the time. It may have been written as &quot;a plea for common sense&quot; during the proscriptions of the Second Triumvirate, with its depiction of Caesar opposing the death penalty contrasting with the then-current slaughter.

It is Sallust&#x27;s first published work, detailing the attempt by Lucius Sergius Catilina to overthrow the Roman Republic in 63 BC. Sallust presents Catiline as a deliberate foe of law, order and morality, and does not give a comprehensive explanation of his views and intentions (Catiline had supported the party of Sulla, whom Sallust had opposed). Theodor Mommsen suggested that Sallust particularly wished to clear his patron (Caesar) of all complicity in the conspiracy.

In writing about the conspiracy of Catiline, Sallust&#x27;s tone, style, and descriptions of aristocratic behaviour illustrate &quot;the political and moral decline of Rome, begun after the fall of Carthage, quickening after Sulla&#x27;s dictatorship, and spreading from the dissolute nobility to infect all Roman politics&quot;. While he inveighs against Catiline&#x27;s depraved character and vicious actions, he does not fail to state that the man had many noble traits. In particular, Sallust shows Catiline as deeply courageous in his final battle. He presents a narrative condemning the conspirators without doubt, likely relying on Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De consulatu suo&quot; () for details of the conspiracy; his narrative focused, however, on Caesar and Cato the Younger, who are held up as &quot;two examples of &quot;virtus&quot; (&#x27;excellence&#x27;)&quot; with long speeches describing a debate on the punishment of the conspirators in the last section.

=== &quot;The Jugurthine War&quot; ===
Sallust&#x27;s &quot;Jugurthine War&quot; () is a monograph on the war against Jugurtha in Numidia from 112 to 106 BC. It was written and again emphasised moral decline. Sallust likely relied on a general annalistic history of the time, as well as the autobiographies of Marcus Aemilius Scaurus, Publius Rutilius Rufus, and Sulla.

Its true value lies in the introduction of Marius and Sulla to the Roman political scene and the beginning of their rivalry. Sallust&#x27;s time as governor of Africa Nova ought to have let the author develop a solid geographical and ethnographical background to the war; however, this is not evident in the monograph, despite a diversion on the subject, because Sallust&#x27;s priority in the &quot;Jugurthine War&quot;, as with &quot;War of Catiline&quot;, is to use history as a vehicle for his judgement on the slow destruction of Roman morality and politics.

=== Other works ===
His last work, &quot;Historiae&quot;, covered events from 78 BC; none of it survives except a fragment of book 5, concerning the year 67 BC. From the extant fragments, he seemed to again emphasize moral decline after Sulla; he &quot;was not generous to Pompey&quot;. Historians regret the loss of the work, as it must have thrown much light on a very eventful period, embracing the war against Sertorius (died 72 BC), the campaigns of Lucullus against Mithradates VI of Pontus (75–66 BC), and the victories of Pompey in the East (66–62 BC).

Two letters (&quot;Duae epistolae de republica ordinanda&quot;), letters of political counsel and advice addressed to Caesar, and an attack upon Cicero (&quot;Invectiva&quot; or &quot;Declamatio in Ciceronem&quot;), frequently attributed to Sallust, are thought by modern scholars to have come from the pen of a rhetorician of the first century AD, along with a counter-invective attributed to Cicero. At one time Marcus Porcius Latro was considered a candidate for the authorship of the pseudo-Sallustian corpus, but this view is no longer commonly held.

== Style and themes ==

The core theme of his work was decline, though his treatment of Roman politics was &quot;often crude&quot;, with a historical philosophy influenced by Thucydides. In this, he felt a &quot;pervasive pessimism&quot; with decline that was &quot;both dreadful and inevitable&quot;, a consequence of political and moral corruption itself caused by Rome&#x27;s immense power: he traced the civil war to the influx of wealth from conquest and the absence of serious foreign threats to hone and exercise Roman virtue at arms. For Sallust, the defining moments of the late republic were the destruction of Rome&#x27;s old foe, Carthage, in 146 BC and the influx of wealth from the east after Sulla&#x27;s First Mithridatic War. At the same time, however, he conveyed a &quot;starry-eyed and romantic picture&quot; of the republic before 146 BC, with this period described in terms of &quot;implausibly untrammelled virtue&quot; that romanticised the distant past.

The style of works written by Sallust was well known in Rome. It differs from the writings of his contemporaries — Caesar and especially Cicero. It is characterized by brevity and by the use of rare words and turns of phrase. As a result, his works are very far from the conversational Latin of his time.

He employed archaic words: according to Suetonius, Lucius Ateius Praetextatus (Philologus) helped Sallust to collect them. Ronald Syme suggests that Sallust&#x27;s choice of style and even particular words was influenced by his antipathy to Cicero, his rival, but also one of the trendsetters in Latin literature in the first century BC. More recent scholars agree, describing Sallust&#x27;s style as &quot;anti-Ciceronian&quot;, eschewing the harmonious structure of Cicero&#x27;s sentences for short and abrupt descriptions. &quot;The Conspiracy of Catiline&quot; reflects many features of style that were developed in his later works.

Sallust avoids common words from public speeches of contemporary Roman political orators, such as &quot;honestas&quot;, &quot;humanitas&quot;, &quot;consensus&quot;. In several cases he uses rare forms of well-known words: for example, &quot;lubido&quot; instead of &quot;libido&quot;, &quot;maxumum&quot; instead of &quot;maximum&quot;, the conjunction &quot;quo&quot; in place of more common &quot;ut&quot;. He also uses the less common endings &quot;-ere&quot; instead of common &quot;-erunt&quot; in the third person plural in the perfect indicative, and &quot;-is&quot; instead of &quot;-es&quot; in the accusative plural for third declension (masculine or feminine) adjectives and nouns. Some words used by Sallust (for example, &quot;antecapere&quot;, &quot;portatio&quot;, &quot;incruentus&quot;, &quot;incelebratus&quot;, &quot;incuriosus&quot;), are not known in other writings before him. They are believed to be either neologisms or intentional revivals of archaic words. Sallust also often uses antithesis, alliterations and chiasmus.

This style itself called for &quot;a &#x27;return to values&#x27;&quot; which was &quot;made to recall the austere life of the idealised ancient Roman&quot;, with archaisms and abrupt writing contrasted against Cicero&#x27;s &quot;adornment&quot; as present decadence was contrasted with ancient virtues.

== Reception ==
=== As a historian ===

On the whole, antiquity looked favourably on Sallust as a historian. Tacitus speaks highly of him. Quintilian called him the &quot;Roman Thucydides&quot;. Martial joins the praise: &quot;Sallust, according to the judgment of the learned, will rank as the prince of Roman historiographers&quot;.

In late antiquity, he was highly praised by Jerome as &quot;very reliable&quot;; his monographs also entered the corpus of standard education in Latin, with Virgil, Cicero, and Terence (covering history, the epic, oratory, and comedy, respectively).

In the thirteenth century Sallust&#x27;s passage on the expansion of the Roman Republic (Cat. 7) was cited and interpreted by theologian Thomas Aquinas and scholar Brunetto Latini. During the Late Middle Ages and Renaissance, Sallust&#x27;s works began to influence political thought in Italy. Among many scholars and historians interested in Sallust, the most notable are Leonardo Bruni, Coluccio Salutati and Niccolò Machiavelli. Among his admirers in England in the early modern period were Thomas More, Alexander Barclay and Thomas Elyot. Justus Lipsius marked Sallust as the second most notable Roman historian after Tacitus.

Historians since the 19th century also have negatively noted Sallust&#x27;s bias and partisanship in his histories, not to mention some errors in geography and dating. Also importantly, much of Sallust&#x27;s anti-corruption moralising is &quot;blunted by his sanctimonious tone and by ancient accusations of corruption, which have made him out to be a remarkable hypocrite&quot;.

Modern views on the period which Sallust documented reject moral failure as a cause of the republic&#x27;s collapse and believe that &quot;social conflicts are insufficient to account for the political implosion&quot;. The core narrative of moral decline prevalent in Sallust&#x27;s works, is now criticised as crowding out his own examination of the structural and socio-economic factors that brought about the crisis of the republic while also manipulating historical facts to make them fit his moralistic thesis; he, however, is credited as &quot;a clear-sighted and impartial interpreter of his own age&quot;.

His focus on moralising also misrepresents and over-simplifies the state of Roman politics. For example, : 

=== Stylistically ===

Quotations and commentaries &quot;attest to the high status of Sallust&#x27;s work in the first and second centuries CE&quot;. Among those who borrowed information from his works were Silius Italicus, Lucan, Plutarch, and Ammianus Marcellinus. Fronto used ancient words collected by Sallust to provide &quot;archaic coloring&quot; for his works. In the second century AD, Zenobius translated his works into Ancient Greek.

Other opinions were also present. For example, Gaius Asinius Pollio criticized Sallust&#x27;s addiction to archaic words and his unusual grammatical features. Aulus Gellius saved Pollio&#x27;s unfavorable statement about Sallust&#x27;s style via quote. According to him, Sallust once used the word &quot;transgressus&quot; meaning generally &quot;passage [by foot]&quot; for a platoon which crossed the sea (the usual word for this type of crossing was &quot;transfretatio&quot;). Though Quintilian has a generally favorable opinion of Sallust, he disparages several features of his style:

His works were also extensively quoted in Augustine of Hippo&#x27;s &quot;City of God&quot;; the works themselves also show up in manuscripts all over the post-Roman period and circulated in Carolingian libraries. In the Middle Ages, Sallust&#x27;s works were often used in schools to teach Latin. His brief style influenced, among others, Widukind of Corvey and Wipo of Burgundy.

Petrarch also praised Sallust highly, though he primarily appreciated his style and moralization. During the French Wars of Religion, &quot;De coniuratione Catilinae&quot; became widely known as a tutorial on disclosing conspiracies.

Friedrich Nietzsche credits Sallust in &quot;Twilight of the Idols&quot; (1889) for his epigrammatic style: &quot;My sense of style, for the epigram as a style, was awakened almost instantly when I came into contact with Sallust&quot; and praises him for being &quot;condensed, severe, with as much substance as possible in the background, and with cold but roguish hostility towards all &#x27;beautiful words&#x27; and &#x27;beautiful feelings&#x27;&quot;. 

Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s first play &quot;Catiline&quot; () was based on Sallust&#x27;s story.

== Manuscripts ==

Several manuscripts of his works survived due to his popularity in antiquity and the Middle Ages.

Manuscripts of his writings are usually divided into two groups: &quot;mutili&quot; (mutilated) and &quot;integri&quot; (whole; undamaged). The classification is based on the existence of the lacuna (gap) between 103.2 and 112.3 of the &quot;Jugurthine War&quot;. The lacuna exists in the &quot;mutili&quot; scrolls, while &quot;integri&quot; manuscripts have the text there. The most ancient scrolls which survive are the &quot;Codex Parisinus 16024&quot; and &quot;Codex Parisinus 16025&quot;, known as &quot;P&quot; and &quot;A&quot; respectively. They were created in the ninth century, and both belong to the &quot;mutili&quot; group. Both these scrolls include only &quot;Catiline&quot; and &quot;Jugurtha&quot;, while some other &quot;mutili&quot; manuscripts also include &quot;Invective&quot; and Cicero&#x27;s response. The oldest &quot;integri&quot; scrolls were created in the eleventh century AD. The probability that all these scrolls came from one or more ancient manuscripts is debated.

There is also a unique scroll &quot;Codex Vaticanus 3864&quot;, known as &quot;V&quot;. It includes only speeches and letters from &quot;Catiline&quot;, &quot;Jugurtha&quot; and &quot;Histories&quot;. The creator of this manuscript changed the original word order and replaced archaisms with more familiar words. The &quot;V&quot; scroll also includes two anonymous letters to Caesar probably from Sallust, but their authenticity is debated.

Several fragments of Sallust&#x27;s works survived in papyri of the second to fourth centuries AD. Many ancient authors cited Sallust, and sometimes their citations of &quot;Histories&quot; are the only source for reconstruction of this work. But the significance of these citations for the reconstruction is uncertain; because occasionally the authors cited Sallust from memory, some distortions were possible.

<doc id="161421" wikidata="Q2554746" url="?curid=161421" title="Persian Bayán">
<text>The Persian Bayán ( - &quot;expression&quot;) is one of the principal scriptural writings of the Báb, the founder of Bábism, written in Persian. The Báb also wrote a shorter book in Arabic, known as the &quot;Arabic Bayán&quot;.

==Content==
The Persian Bayán was written near the end of 1847 or the beginning of 1848, while the Báb was imprisoned in Maku. The book contains elements of Bábí law, discussion of religious concepts, and the glorification of &quot;He whom God shall make manifest&quot;. It was one of the Báb&#x27;s first works in which he clearly states that he is the messianic figure of the Twelfth Imam and the Mahdi which the Shiʻas were expecting. With the claim, he also claimed the abrogation of the Islamic dispensation, and uses the new Bábí law to abrogate Islamic law. The whole book also revolves around the praise of &quot;He whom God shall make manifest&quot;, promising the coming of a major prophet termed a Manifestation of God; this would be of major importance with Baháʼu&#x27;lláh&#x27;s claim two decades later. Shoghi Effendi considered it a &quot;eulogy of the Promised One&quot;, who had abrogated the laws of Islam, and prophesied about the coming of the Baháʼí Faith.

== Unities and chapters ==
The book was intended to be composed of nineteen &#x27;unities&#x27; each of nineteen chapters, consisting of a total of 361 sections, which had numerical significance, but this was left incomplete and stops in the ninth &#x27;unity&#x27;. It was intended to be finished by &quot;He whom God shall make manifest&quot;, a messianic figure in the Báb&#x27;s writings. Baháʼís consider Baháʼu&#x27;lláh&#x27;s &quot;Kitáb-i-Íqán&quot; as its completion.

==Laws==

Among the main themes of the Bayán are the mystic character of action, the prohibition of causing grief to others, refinement, perfection and the spiritualization of life and language. Baháʼí scholar, Nader Saiedi states that the severe laws of the Bayán were never meant to be put in practice, because their implementation depended on the appearance of He whom God shall make manifest, while at the same time all of the laws would be abrogated unless the Promised One would reaffirm them. Saiedi concludes that these can then only have a strategic and symbolic meaning, and were meant to break through traditions and to focus the Báb&#x27;s followers on obedience to He whom God shall make manifest. The Báb stresses the importance of the recognition of the symbolic nature and spiritual meaning of each of his laws. In the Baháʼí view, Baháʼu&#x27;lláh is regarded as this Promised One. In his &quot;Kitab-i-Aqdas&quot;, Baháʼu&#x27;lláh cancelled specific laws of the Bayan, while confirming others.

==Right of completion==
Certain early researchers of the religion believed that the right of completing the Bayán was conferred to Subh-i Azal. However, more modern scholarship shows that that interpretation is flawed because Subh-i-Azal is only given the right to complete the Bayán with the permission of &quot;He whom God shall make manifest&quot;, and that Subh-i-Azal was instituted as a nominal head and asked to preserve the religion until &quot;He whom God shall make manifest&quot; would arrive.

The Báb eliminated any form of successorship or vicegerency from his religion and stated that no one else&#x27;s writings would be authoritative after his death to the time of &quot;He Whom God shall make Manifest&quot;. Some of the followers of Subh-i-Azal state that the Báb actually made Subh-i-Azal his vicegerent because the Báb in a tablet written to Azal stated that he should manifest the remaining paths of the Bayán if &quot;He Whom God shall make Manifest&quot; is made manifest during Azal&#x27;s days. The Azalis interpret this to mean the Báb gave Sub-i-Azal the right to complete the unfinished text of the Bayán. However, the Báb affirms to Subh-i-Azal himself that &quot;He Whom God shall make Manifest&quot; may appear in Subh-i-Azal&#x27;s own lifetime, and thus eliminates any viceregency for Subh-i-Azal.

One of the texts that the Azalis use to state that Subh-i-Azal was appointed as a viceregent is the controversial book Nuqtutu&#x27;l-Kaq, but the book&#x27;s statements are very contradictory and problematic. In one section of the book the author states that the Bayán may become abrogated within a few years of the Báb&#x27;s death, and that &quot;He Whom God shall make Manifest&quot; may appear during Azal&#x27;s time, then later he states that the abrogation of the Bayán and the appearance of the Promised One could not occur before two thousand years. Even later the author makes the proposition that the Promised One is Subh-i-Azal himself, showing that the author truly did not believe that the appearance of the Promised One would have to take two thousand years. The proposition that &quot;He Whom God shall make Manifest&quot; would take two thousand years is absurd since the Báb discusses the advent of &quot;He Whom God shall make Manifest&quot; during Subh-i-Azal&#x27;s lifetime as a conditional point for Subh-i-Azal to take certain action.

An alternative interpretation of the passage in question is that Subh-i-Azal is asked to instead to making public or distribute the eight copies of the Bayan to eight people mentioned in the passage.

== Browne and the Bayán ==
Edward G. Browne planned at one time to publish an edited text of the Persian Bayán, and did considerable work on the compilation of six manuscripts, but the work was never completed. This incomplete compilation, still exists in the Cambridge University Library (classmark Or. 1331–7 [11]), awaiting the attention of some future scholar.

<doc id="161423" wikidata="Q355778" url="?curid=161423" title="Titus Annius Milo">
<text>Titus Annius Milo (died 48 BC) was a Roman political agitator. The son of Gaius Papius Celsus, he was adopted by his maternal grandfather, Titus Annius Luscus. In 52 BC, he was prosecuted for the murder of Publius Clodius Pulcher and exiled from Rome. He was unsuccessfully defended by his friend, Marcus Tullius Cicero, in the speech &quot;Pro Milone&quot;.

==Career==
Milo was an ally of Pompey and of the Optimates. He organized bands of armed slaves, hired thugs and gladiators in opposition to Clodius, who supported Pompey&#x27;s rival, Julius Caesar, and the Populares. The two opposing factions clashed in the streets of Rome between 57 BC and 52 BC. 

===Cursus honorum===
Milo was tribune of the plebs in 57 BC. He took a prominent role in recalling Cicero from exile after Clodius had arranged for his exile the previous year.

In 56 BC, Milo was charged with illegal violence by Clodius. He was defended by Cicero and Pompey (among others). The trial led to riots between Milo&#x27;s and Clodius&#x27;s supporters in the Forum. Pompey&#x27;s opponents supported Clodius; they wanted to weaken Pompey. Eventually, Milo was acquitted.

On 23 January 57 BC, Clodius tried to use a force of gladiators to block a move to recall Cicero from exile, but Milo arrested Clodius&#x27; gladiators. Milo was subsequently attacked by Clodius&#x27; gangs. Milo attempted to prosecute Clodius for carrying out this violence but was unsuccessful. Later that year he tried to prosecute Clodius again, but Clodius escaped by being elected aedile in 56 BC and so was immune from prosecution.

Milo became praetor in 54 BC, and in that year, he married Fausta Cornelia, daughter of the dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla, and the ex-wife of Gaius Memmius.

In 53 BC, Milo made a bid for one of the consulships of the following year (he ran against Quintus Caecilius Metellus Scipio and Publius Plautius Hypsaeus, nominees of Pompey, who were running together) while Clodius was standing for the praetorship. Milo was a strong candidate for he had won popular support through largesse and the promotion of extravagant games, and he enjoyed the support of the Optimates. Pompey, however, gave his support to Milo&#x27;s opponents. Plautius was an old quaestor of his and Scipio was his father-in-law. Meanwhile, Clodius feared he would achieve little as praetor if Milo were to become consul. Milo&#x27;s and Clodius&#x27;s supporters clashed in the streets of Rome leading to a breakdown of order. The elections were declared void because of the excessive use of the tribunes&#x27; vetoes which meant that 52 BC began with an interregnum.

===Death of Clodius===
On 18 January 52 BC, Milo and Clodius, each with an armed retinue, met on the Appian Way near Bovillae. Milo was on his way to Lanuvium to appoint a priest. Conflicting stories claim that Clodius was either peacefully heading to Rome after receiving news a friend had died or lying in wait for Milo. Whatever the reason, a scuffle led to a fight between the two parties, with Clodius being wounded by one of Milo&#x27;s men (an ex-gladiator called Birria). Clodius fled to an inn, from which he was extracted on Milo&#x27;s orders and murdered.

===Trial===
The followers of Clodius carried his body to the Senate House, the Curia Hostilia, and set fire to it. Milo returned to Rome and, with the aid of the tribune Marcus Caelius Rufus, he tried to swing popular opinion round to his side again. On 22 January Milo tried to obtain an interview with Pompey at his house on the Pincian, apparently with a positive suggestion to improve the situation by withdrawing his candidature. Pompey refused to even see him. The Senate took action and passed the &quot;consultum ultimum&quot; (the ultimate decree), urging the interrex, the tribunes and Pompey to take steps to protect the Republic. In the ensuing unrest, the Senate called on Pompey to become sole consul. He levied troops and set about restoring order, partly by force but also by the legal means now at his disposal. He passed a law regarding both electoral bribery and violence and charged Milo under the new law. Pompey&#x27;s actions may have been designed to placate Clodius&#x27;s supporters, who would not be soothed even after they had set fire to the Curia. Pompey hand-picked Milo&#x27;s jury, and the presiding magistrate, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, was Pompey&#x27;s client.

Milo was defended by Marcus Tullius Cicero, Marcus Caelius Rufus and Marcus Marcellus. Under Pompey&#x27;s new procedural rules, the trial should have lasted five days, with the summing up for the defence and the verdict on the fifth day. However, on the first day, Gaius Causinius Schola appeared as a witness against Milo and described the deed in such a way as to portray Milo as a cold-blooded murderer. That worked up the Clodian crowd, who, in turn, terrified the advocate on Milo&#x27;s side, Marcus Marcellus. As he began his questioning of the witnesses, the Clodian crowd drowned out his voice and surrounded him. On subsequent days, Pompey brought in armed men to keep order.

On the final day of the trial, Cicero was to give a closing speech to try to prevent Milo from being condemned. Instead, he broke down after he was intimidated by the Clodian mob and either did not finish or did not present the speech well and in the style for which he was renowned. Milo was convicted by 38 votes to 13.

==Exile==
Milo left Rome and went into exile at Massilia (today Marseille). His property was sold by auction. During his absence, Milo was prosecuted and convicted for bribery, unlawful association and violence.

Cassius Dio states that when Cicero had finished writing up his speech, he sent a copy to Milo in exile. Milo wrote back that it was lucky for him that the same speech had not been made in court because otherwise, he would &quot;not now be enjoying the delicious red mullet of Massilia&quot;.

==Death==
In 48 BC, Milo joined Marcus Caelius Rufus in the rebellion against Caesar, but he died at that year&#x27;s siege of Compsa, near Thurii, in Lucania. He was killed by a stone thrown from the city walls.

==In popular culture==
Titus Annius Milo appears as a recurring character in John Maddox Roberts&#x27; &quot;SPQR series&quot; of novels. These historical mysteries are presented as memoirs of the fictional Decius Caecilius Metellus the Younger; Milo is a trusted friend of Metellus.

Milo also appears as a character in &quot;A Murder on the Appian Way&quot;, &quot;Last Seen in Massilia&quot; and &quot;A Mist of Prophecies&quot;, in the &quot;Roma Sub Rosa&quot; series of historical mystery novels by Steven Saylor. Saylor’s fictional hero dislikes Milo.

Milo appears in Conn Iggulden&#x27;s book &quot;The Field of Swords&quot;, the third in the series &quot;Emperor&quot;, as a street gangster who wages a private war with Publius Clodius.

Milo is a character in Colleen McCollough&#x27;s novel &quot;Caesar.&quot;

He also appears in the book &quot;Street Fighter: Son of Spartacus&quot; in a plot to assassinate Julius Caesar.

Milo features prominently in the 2015 novel &quot;Dictator&quot; by British novelist Robert Harris.

<text>Antimachus of [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]] (), or of Claros, was a Greek poet and grammarian, who flourished about 400 BC.

== Life ==
Scarcely anything is known of his life. The Suda claims that he was a pupil of the poets Panyassis and Stesimbrotus.

== Work ==
His poetical efforts were not generally appreciated, although he received encouragement from his younger contemporary Plato (Plutarch, &quot;Lysander&quot;, 18). The emperor Hadrian, however, would later consider him superior to Homer.

His chief works were: an epic &quot;Thebaid&quot;, an account of the expedition of the Seven against Thebes and the war of the Epigoni; and an elegiac poem &quot;Lyde&quot;, so called from the poet&#x27;s mistress, for whose death he endeavoured to find consolation telling stories from mythology of heroic disasters (Plutarch, &quot;Consul, ad Apoll.&quot; 9; Athenaeus xiii. 597).

Antimachus was the founder of &quot;learned&quot; epic poetry, and the forerunner of the Alexandrian school, whose critics allotted him the next place to Homer. He also prepared a critical recension of the Homeric poems.

He is to be distinguished from Antimachus of Teos, a much earlier poet to whom the lost Cyclic epic &quot;Epigoni&quot; was apparently ascribed (though the attribution may result from confusion).

<text>Theodor Bergk (22 May 181220 July 1881) was a German philologist, an authority on classical Greek poetry.

==Biography==
He was born in Leipzig as the son of Johann Adam Bergk. After studying at the University of Leipzig, where he profited by the instruction of Gottfried Hermann, he was appointed in 1835 to the lectureship in Latin at the orphan school at Halle. After holding posts at Neustrelitz, Berlin and Cassel, he succeeded (1842) Karl Friedrich Hermann as professor of classical literature at Marburg. In 1852 he went to Freiburg, and in 1857 returned to Halle.

In 1868 he resigned his professorship, and settled down to study and literary work in Bonn. He died on 20 July 1881, at Ragatz in Switzerland, where he had gone for the benefit of his health.

Bergk&#x27;s literary activity was very great, but his reputation mainly rests upon his work in connection with Greek literature and the Greek lyric poets. His &quot;Poetae Lyrici Graeci&quot; (1843), and &quot;Griechische Litteraturgeschichte&quot; (1872–1887) (completed by G. Hinrichs and R. Peppmüller with the aid of Bergk&#x27;s posthumous papers) became standard works.

He also edited Anacreon (1834), the fragments of Aristophanes (1840), Aristophanes (3rd ed., 1872), Sophocles (2nd ed., 1868), a lyric anthology (4th ed., 1890). Among his other works may be mentioned: &quot;Augusti Rerum a se gestarum Index&quot; (1873); &quot;Inschriften römischer Schleudergeschosse&quot; (1876); &quot;Zur Geschichte und Topographie der Rheinlande in römischer Zeit&quot; (1882); &quot;Beiträge zur römischen Chronologie&quot; (1884).
His &quot;Kleine philologische Schriften&quot; were edited by Peppmüller (1884–1886), and contain, in addition to a complete list of his writings, a sketch of his life.

<text>Daniel Peter O&#x27;Herlihy (1 May 1919 – 17 February 2005) was an Irish actor of film, television and radio. O&#x27;Herlihy&#x27;s best-known roles included his Oscar-nominated portrayal of the lead character in Luis Buñuel&#x27;s &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; (1954), Brigadier General Warren A. Black in &quot;Fail Safe&quot; (1964), Marshal Ney in &quot;Waterloo&quot; (1970), Conal Cochran in &quot;Halloween III: Season of the Witch&quot; (1982), Grig in &quot;The Last Starfighter&quot; (1984), &quot;The Old Man&quot; in &quot;RoboCop&quot; (1987) and its 1990 sequel, and Andrew Packard in the television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (1990–91).

==Early life and education==
O&#x27;Herlihy was born in Wexford, County Wexford in 1919, but moved with his family to Dublin when he was young. He was educated at Christian Brothers College in Dún Laoghaire and later studied at University College Dublin, graduating in 1944 with a degree in architecture, following in his father&#x27;s footsteps.

He developed a keen interest in acting during his university studies. He joined several amateur theatre groups and joined the Abbey Theatre as a bit player. After graduating from the university, he decided to pursue acting full-time, working at the Abbey and Gate Theatre, first as a set designer, then later as an actor.

==Career==
O&#x27;Herlihy&#x27;s first notable acting role came in 1944, when he played the lead in the Gate&#x27;s production of &quot;Red Roses For Me&quot;, written and directed by Seán O&#x27;Casey. He appeared in some fifty plays at the Gate. He made his film debut in 1947 in Carol Reed&#x27;s &quot;Odd Man Out&quot;, which was shot on location in Belfast, and also worked extensively in radio. His first American film role was as Macduff in Orson Welles&#x27; version of &quot;Macbeth&quot; (1948), followed by supporting roles in films such as the Red Scare fantasy &quot;Invasion, U.S.A.&quot;, the Kiplingesque &quot;Soldiers Three&quot; and a series of swashbucklers, such as &quot;The Black Shield of Falworth&quot; (1954).

His career took an upward turn in 1954 when he played the title role in Luis Buñuel&#x27;s &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, which earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. O&#x27;Herlihy recalled that the producers of the film wanted Buñuel to use Orson Welles for the role, with Buñuel refusing, saying he was too big and too fat. They arranged a screening of Welles&#x27; &quot;Macbeth&quot; to show how a bearded Welles would look, but O&#x27;Herlihy&#x27;s performance as Macduff convinced Buñuel to cast O&#x27;Herlihy instead.

O&#x27;Herlihy was later featured in 1959 in &quot;The Young Land&quot; as Judge Millard Isham and as Dave Edwards in Douglas Sirk&#x27;s remake of &quot;Imitation of Life&quot;. The following year he played Sir Harry Ivers, an upper-class English drifter who joins Alan Ladd in a plot to ruin an Arizona cattle town by robbing its bank, in the western &quot;One Foot in Hell&quot;. O&#x27;Herlihy was also cast as Dr. Caligari in &quot;The Cabinet of Caligari&quot;, Robert Bloch&#x27;s reimagining of the German silent classic, in 1962.

In 1964, he starred in &quot;Fail Safe&quot; in the role of General Black, or &quot;Blackie&quot;, who nukes New York on presidential orders. In 1969, he was cast in &quot;The Big Cube&quot; and &quot;100 Rifles&quot;. In 1970, he starred in the epic &quot;Waterloo&quot;, playing the part of Michel Ney, the marshal of France. In 1982, he starred in &quot;Halloween III: Season of the Witch&quot; as Conal Cochran and in 1984, he appeared in &quot;The Last Starfighter&quot; as Grig, Alex Rogan&#x27;s reptilian co-pilot, navigator and sidekick. In 1986&#x27;s &quot;The Whoopee Boys&quot; he played a judge and in 1987, he appeared in &quot;RoboCop&quot; as &quot;The Old Man&quot;. That same year, he was cast in John Huston&#x27;s &quot;The Dead&quot;. In 1990, he appeared in &quot;RoboCop 2&quot;, the sequel to the 1987 film.

O&#x27;Herlihy had a fairly extensive career in television, having appeared on &quot;Rawhide&quot;, &quot;The DuPont Show with June Allyson&quot;, &quot;Adventures in Paradise&quot; and &quot;&quot;. He portrayed Larry &quot;Ace&quot; Banner in the first season of &quot;The Untouchables&quot; in the episode titled &quot;The Big Squeeze&quot;. He was cast as Stephen Jordan in the last season of &quot;Checkmate&quot; episode &quot; &quot;Referendum on Murder&quot;. He also appeared on &quot;The Americans&quot; and &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; in the episodes &quot;The Fiddlesticks Affair&quot; and &quot;The Yo-Ho-Ho and a Bottle of Rum Affair&quot; and on &quot;Route 66&quot; in the episode &quot;To Walk with the Serpent&quot;. In 1962, he was cast as Glenn Kassin in &quot;The Earth Mover&quot; episode of &quot;Empire&quot;. He appeared on &quot;Bonanza&quot; (episode: &quot;The Artist&quot; as Matthew Raine).

In 1963–1964, he was in &quot;The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters&quot;. On &quot;The Long, Hot Summer&quot;, O&#x27;Herlihy became the lead star, having replaced Edmond O&#x27;Brien in the part of Will Varner midway through the program&#x27;s single-season run. In 1966, he appeared in the episode &quot;Have You Seen the Aurora Borealis?&quot; of &quot;The Road West&quot;, starring Barry Sullivan. In 1974, he appeared in &quot;QB VII&quot; and played the Senior American Officer, Col. Max Dodd in the second series of BBC&#x27;s POW drama &quot;Colditz&quot;. In the same year he took a role in the film, &quot;The Tamarind Seed&quot;, which starred Omar Sharif and Julie Andrews.

In 1976, he guest-starred in an episode of &quot;Gibbsville&quot;. In 1978, he guest-starred in the second part of the &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; episode &quot;Gun on Ice Planet Zero&quot; as Dr. Ravishol. O&#x27;Herlihy also portrayed the ill-fated lumber tycoon Andrew Packard in the cult television program &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (1991) and in the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Deep Freeze&quot;, voicing the villainous theme park mogul Grant Walker. In 1998, O&#x27;Herlihy acted in his last film, &quot;The Rat Pack&quot;, playing Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.

==Personal life==
Dan O&#x27;Herlihy married Elsie Bennett in 1945. He was the brother of director Michael O&#x27;Herlihy, and the father of actor Gavan O&#x27;Herlihy, architect Lorcan O&#x27;Herlihy, and visual artist-turned-theatrical producer Olwen O&#x27;Herlihy. One grandchild, Micaela O&#x27;Herlihy, is a filmmaker whose work has been shown at the Sundance Film Festival. Another, Alana O&#x27;Herlihy, is a photographer and director who has collaborated with Miley Cyrus.

O&#x27;Herlihy became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1983.

==Death==
O&#x27;Herlihy died of natural causes in Malibu, California in 2005, aged 85. His personal papers are held in the University College Dublin Archives.

Borgnine starred as the title character in the sitcom &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot; (1962–1966) and co-starred as Dominic Santini in the action series &quot;Airwolf&quot; (1984–1986).

Borgnine earned his third Primetime Emmy Award nomination at age 92 for his work on the 2009 series finale of &quot;ER&quot;. He was also known as the original voice of Mermaid Man on &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; from 1999 until his death in 2012.

== Early life and education ==
Borgnine was born Ermes Effron Borgnino () on January 24, 1917, in Hamden, Connecticut, the son of Italian immigrants. His mother, Anna () hailed from Carpi, near Modena, while his father Camillo Borgnino was a native of Ottiglio near Alessandria. Borgnine&#x27;s parents separated when he was two years old, and he then lived with his mother in Italy for about four and a half years. By 1923, his parents had reconciled, the family name was changed from Borgnino to Borgnine, and his father changed his first name to Charles. Borgnine had a younger sister, Evelyn Borgnine Velardi (1925–2013). The family settled in New Haven, Connecticut, where Borgnine graduated from James Hillhouse High School. He took to sports while growing up, but showed no interest in acting.

== Military service ==

Borgnine joined the United States Navy in October 1935, after graduation from high school. He served aboard the destroyer/minesweeper and was honorably discharged from the Navy in October 1941. In January 1942, he reenlisted in the Navy after the attack on Pearl Harbor. During World War II, he patrolled the Atlantic Coast on an antisubmarine warfare ship, the patrol yacht . In September 1945, he was once again honorably discharged from the Navy. He served a total of almost 10 years in the Navy and obtained the grade of gunner&#x27;s mate first class. His military awards include the Navy Good Conduct Medal, American Defense Service Medal with &quot;A&quot; Device, American Campaign Medal with &quot; bronze star, and the World War II Victory Medal.

===Later honors===
In 1997, Borgnine received the United States Navy Memorial, Lone Sailor Award. On December 7, 2000, Borgnine was named the Veterans Foundation&#x27;s Veteran of the Year.

In October 2004, Borgnine received the honorary title of chief petty officer from Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy Terry D. Scott. The ceremony for Borgnine&#x27;s naval advancement was held at the U.S. Navy Memorial in Washington, DC. He received the special honor for his naval service and support of naval personnel and their families worldwide.

==Acting career==
===1946–1952: Theatre and television roles ===
Borgnine returned to his parents&#x27; house in Connecticut after his Navy discharge without a job to go back to and no direction. In a British Film Institute interview about his life and career, he said:

He took a local factory job, but was unwilling to settle down to that kind of work. His mother encouraged him to pursue a more glamorous profession, and suggested to him that his personality would be well suited for the stage. He surprised his mother by taking the suggestion to heart, although his father was far from enthusiastic. In 2011, Borgnine remembered,

He studied acting at the Randall School of Drama in Hartford, then moved to Virginia, where he became a member of the Barter Theatre in Abingdon, Virginia. It had been named for the director&#x27;s allowing audiences to barter produce for admission during the cash-lean years of the Great Depression. In 1947, Borgnine landed his first stage role in &quot;State of the Union&quot;. Although it was a short role, he won over the audience. His next role was as the Gentleman Caller in Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot;.

In 1949, Borgnine went to New York, where he had his Broadway debut in the role of a nurse in the play &quot;Harvey&quot;. Borgnine made his TV debut as a character actor in &quot;Captain Video and His Video Rangers&quot;, beginning in 1951. These two episodes led to countless other television roles that Borgnine would gain in &quot;Goodyear Television Playhouse&quot;, &quot;The Ford Television Theatre&quot;, &quot;Fireside Theatre&quot;, &quot;Frontier Justice&quot;, &quot;Laramie&quot;, &quot;Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre&quot;, and &quot;Run for Your Life&quot;. An appearance as the villain on TV&#x27;s &quot;Captain Video&quot; led to Borgnine&#x27;s casting in the motion picture &quot;The Whistle at Eaton Falls&quot; (1951) for Columbia Pictures. Later on, in 1957, he would appear in the first episode of the TV series &quot;Wagon Train&quot;.

===1953–1961: Film stardom ===
Borgnine moved to Los Angeles, California, where he eventually received his big break in Columbia film directed by Fred Zinnemann, the romantic war drama &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; (1953), playing the sadistic Sergeant &quot;Fatso&quot; Judson, who beats a stockade prisoner in his charge, Angelo Maggio (played by Frank Sinatra). The film received critical acclaim including the Academy Award for Best Picture. The following year he acted in four films, three of them Western dramas, &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot; starring Joan Crawford, &quot;The Bounty Hunter&quot; with Randolph Scott, &quot;Vera Cruz&quot; starring Burt Lancaster and Gary Cooper, he also starred in the Biblical drama &quot;Demetrius and the Gladiators&quot;. Borgnine built a reputation as a dependable character actor, and played villains in early films, including movies such as &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot; and &quot;Vera Cruz&quot;.

In 1955 he starred as a villain in the John Sturges neo-Western &quot;Bad Day at Black Rock&quot; starring Spencer Tracy, Lee Marvin, and Walter Brennan. He also starred as warmhearted butcher in &quot;Marty&quot;, the 1955 film version of the television play of the same title. The film debuted at the Cannes Film Festival where it received acclaim and the Palme D&#x27;Or. Borgnine won numerous accolades including the Academy Award for Best Actor beating Frank Sinatra, James Dean (who had died by the time of the ceremony), and former Best Actor winners Spencer Tracy and James Cagney. He also received the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama, the National Board of Review Award for Best Actor, and the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor.

Borgnine travelled to Australia to play the lead in a role originally intended for Burt Lancaster, the cane cutter Roo, in &quot;Summer of the Seventeenth Doll&quot;.

=== 1962–1966: &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot; ===
In 1962, Borgnine signed a contract with Universal Studios for the lead role as the gruff but lovable skipper, Quinton McHale, in what began as a serious one-hour 1962 episode called &quot;Seven Against the Sea&quot; for &quot;Alcoa Premiere&quot;, and later reworked to a comedy called &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot;, a World War II sitcom, which also co-starred unfamiliar comedians Joe Flynn as Capt. Wally Binghamton and Tim Conway as Ens. Charles Parker. The insubordinate crew of PT-73 helped the show become an overnight success during its first season, landing in the top 30 in 1963.

He thrived on the adulation from fans for their favorite navy man, and in 1963 received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. At the end of the fourth season, in 1966, low ratings and repetitive storylines brought &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot; to an end. At the time &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot; began production, Borgnine was married to actress Katy Jurado. Her death in 2002 drew Borgnine and Conway much closer; about his acting mentor&#x27;s long career, Conway said: &quot;There were no limits to Ernie. When you look at his career—Fatso Judson to Marty, that&#x27;s about as varied as you get in characters and he handled both of them with equal delicacy and got the most out of those characters.&quot;

=== 1967–1982: Continued success ===

Borgnine&#x27;s film career flourished for the next three decades, including roles in &quot;The Flight of the Phoenix&quot; (1965), &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; (1967) with Lee Marvin, &quot;Ice Station Zebra&quot; (1968), &quot;Willard&quot; (1971) &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; (1972), &quot;Emperor of the North&quot; (1973), &quot;Convoy&quot; (1978), &quot;The Black Hole&quot; (1979), &quot;Super Fuzz&quot; (1980) and &quot;Escape from New York&quot; (1981). One of his most famous roles was that of Dutch in the Western classic &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; (1969) from director Sam Peckinpah. Of his role in &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;, Borgnine later said, &quot;I did [think it was a moral film]. Because to me, every picture should have some kind of a moral to it. I feel that when we used to watch old pictures, as we still do I&#x27;m sure, the bad guys always got it in the end and the good guys always won out. Today, it&#x27;s a little different. Today, it seems that the bad guys are getting the good end of it. There was always a moral in our story&quot;.

During this time he also appeared on numerous television shows such as &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; (a two-part episode entitled &quot;The Lord is My Shepherd&quot;), &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, &quot;Highway to Heaven&quot;, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot;, &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;, the final episodes of &quot;ER&quot;, and many others.

=== 1983–2011: Final appearances ===

Borgnine returned to Universal Studios in 1983, for a co-starring role opposite Jan-Michael Vincent, on &quot;Airwolf&quot;. After he was approached by producer Donald P. Bellisario, who had been impressed by Borgnine&#x27;s guest role as a wrestler in a 1982 episode of &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, he immediately agreed to join the series. He played Dominic Santini, a helicopter pilot, which became an immediate hit. Borgnine&#x27;s strong performances belied his exhaustion due to the grueling production schedule, and the challenges of working with his younger, series lead. The show was canceled by CBS in 1986.

In 1989, Borgnine went to Namibia to shoot the film &quot;Laser Mission&quot;, starring Brandon Lee. It was released in 1990. 

in 1995 he appeared with Jonathan Silverman in &quot;The Single Guy&quot; as doorman Manny Cordoba, which lasted two seasons. According to Silverman, Borgnine came to work with more energy and passion than all other stars combined. He was the first person to arrive on the set every day and the last to leave. 

In 1996, Borgnine starred in the televised fantasy/thriller film &quot;Merlin&#x27;s Shop of Mystical Wonders&quot; (partially adapted from the 1984 horror film &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Gift&quot;). As narrator and storyteller, Borgnine recounts a string of related supernatural tales, his modern-day fables notably centering on an enchanted and malicious cymbal-banging monkey toy stolen from the wizard Merlin. The film was later featured in the parodical television series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, and has since gained a prominent cult following. Also in 1996, Borgnine toured the United States on a bus to meet his fans and see the country. The trip was the subject of a 1997 documentary, &quot;Ernest Borgnine on the Bus&quot;. He also served one year as the chairman of the National Salute to Hospitalized Veterans, visiting patients in many Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers.
In 1997, Borgnine appeared in the big-screen adaptation comedy film &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot;, where he played Rear Admiral Quinton McHale, who was also the father of Tom Arnold&#x27;s character, Quinton McHale Jr. In 1998, Borgnine appeared in the Trey Parker and Matt Stone comedy &quot;BASEketball&quot; as entrepreneur Ted Denslow. Starting in 1999, Borgnine provided his voice talent to the animated sitcom SpongeBob SquarePants as the elderly superhero Mermaid Man (where he was paired up with &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot; co-star Tim Conway as the voice of Mermaid Man&#x27;s sidekick Barnacle Boy). He expressed affection for this role, in no small part for its popularity among children. After his death, Nickelodeon reaired all of the episodes in which Mermaid Man appeared, in memoriam. Borgnine also appeared as himself in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Boy-Scoutz &#x27;n the Hood&quot;, in addition to a number of television commercials. In 2000, he was the executive producer of &quot;Hoover&quot;, in which he was the only credited actor.

In 2007, Borgnine starred in the Hallmark original film &quot;A Grandpa for Christmas&quot;. He played a man who, after his estranged daughter ends up in the hospital because of a car accident, discovers that he has a granddaughter he never knew about. She is taken into his care, and they soon become great friends. Borgnine received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Miniseries or Motion Picture made for Television for his performance. At 90, he was the oldest Golden Globe nominee ever. In 2010 he costarred in &quot;The Wishing Well&quot;. Borgnine&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Ernie&quot; was published by Citadel Press in July 2008. &quot;Ernie&quot; is a loose, conversational recollection of highlights from his acting career and notable events from his personal life. On April 2, 2009, he appeared in several episodes of the final season of the long-running medical series &quot;ER&quot;. His role was that of a husband dealing with the decline of his wife, who would die in the final episode of the series. In his final scene, his character is in a hospital bed lying beside his just-deceased wife. His performance garnered an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series, his third nomination and his first in 29 years (since being nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or a Special in 1980 for &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;).

In 2009, at age 92, he starred as Frank, the main character of &quot;Another Harvest Moon&quot;, directed by Greg Swartz and also starring Piper Laurie and Anne Meara. On October 2, 2010, Borgnine appeared as himself in a sketch with Morgan Freeman on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. On October 15, 2010, he appeared in &quot;Red&quot;, which was filmed earlier that year. In late 2011, Borgnine completed what was his last film, playing Rex Page in &quot;The Man Who Shook the Hand of Vicente Fernandez&quot;.

==Personal life and death ==

Borgnine married five times. His first marriage, from 1949 to 1958, was to Rhoda Kemins, whom he met while serving in the Navy. They had one daughter, Nancee (born May 28, 1952). He was then married to actress Katy Jurado from 1959 to 1963. Borgnine&#x27;s rancorous marriage to actress and singer Ethel Merman in 1964 lasted only 42 days. Merman&#x27;s description of the marriage in her autobiography was a solitary blank page. Borgnine&#x27;s friend Tim Conway later said: &quot;Ernie is volatile. I mean, there&#x27;s no question about that, and Ethel was a very strong lady. So you put two bombs in a room, something is going to explode, and I guess it probably did.&quot;

From 1965 to 1972, Borgnine was married to Donna Rancourt, with whom he had a son, Cristopher (born August 9, 1969), and two daughters, Sharon (born August 5, 1965) and Diana (born December 29, 1970). His fifth and final marriage was to Tova Traesnaes; they remained married from February 24, 1973 until his death.

In 2000, Borgnine received his 50-year pin as a Freemason at Abingdon Lodge No. 48 in Abingdon, Virginia. He joined the Scottish Rite Valley of Los Angeles in 1964, received the Knights Commander of the Court of Honor (KCCH) in 1979, was crowned a 33° Inspector General Honorary in 1983 and received the Grand Cross of the Court of Honour in 1991.

Borgnine was a heavy smoker until 1962.

At the age of 95, Borgnine died of renal failure on July 8, 2012 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. He had undergone surgery a month prior to his death and had been to the hospital days before it for a medical checkup. He was cremated and given a military funeral.

He volunteered to be Stories of Service National spokesman, urging his fellow World War II vets to come forward and share their stories.

In 2007, Borgnine was presented with California&#x27;s highest civilian honor, the Commendation Medal.

<text>Love Me or Leave Me is a 1955 American romantic musical drama film starring Doris Day, with James Cagney and Cameron Mitchell in supporting roles. Also a biopic, the MGM production recounts the life of Ruth Etting, a singer who rose from dancer to movie star. Nominated for six Academy Awards, the picture was directed by Charles Vidor, and written by Daniel Fuchs and Isobel Lennart.

==Plot==
Nineteen-twenties Chicago nightclub singer and dime-a-dance girl Ruth Etting is in jeopardy of losing her job for kicking a customer for his unwelcome attention. Martin Snyder, known as &quot;The Gimp&quot; because of his game leg, intervenes on her behalf. A man of considerable clout, he owns a laundry business as a front and runs a thriving protection racket.

Etting is desperate to get into show business. Snyder gets her a job dancing in a floor show, then pays for a singing coach, Johnny Alderman, who is also attracted to her.

Etting and Alderman are grateful, but Snyder makes it clear he expects Etting to travel to Miami with him, not for business but for pleasure. Etting declines, but Snyder&#x27;s interest in her continues. Through an agent, Bernie Loomis, he arranges a radio program to feature Etting, followed by a job with the Ziegfeld Follies. His crude behavior and violent temper cause Etting multiple problems.

Johnny continues to woo Etting, but under heavy pressure from Snyder she marries him instead. His heavy-handed management continues as her career blossoms. Goaded to enter the entertainment business, Snyder decides to open a nightclub of his own, sinking his wealth heavily into it. Upset at sensing a relationship resuming between Etting and Johnny during their filming of a Hollywood movie, Snyder strikes her; she runs off and seeks a divorce. Snyder then catches them together, shoots Johnny and is arrested.

Horrified but conflicted because of all Snyder has done for her career, Etting arranges for Loomis to bail him out of jail. At his nightclub which he expects to find deserted, Snyder arrives to find Etting performing there herself. At first enraged by what he perceives as an act of charity, Snyder finally realizes this is Etting&#x27;s way of showing her appreciation, even if she can&#x27;t be part of his life any longer.

==Production==
The role of Snyder was originally intended for Spencer Tracy, but he turned it down. After the Etting role was turned down by Ava Gardner, Cagney suggested Doris Day to producer Joe Pasternak. Gardner was subsequently placed on a temporary salary suspension by MGM as a punishment.

==Reception==
&quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;a rich canvas of the Roaring &#x27;20s, with gutsy and excellent performances.&quot;

==Awards and nominations==
==Box-office==
According to MGM records the film earned $4,035,000 in the US and Canada and $1,597,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $595,000. &quot;Love Me or Leave Me&quot; was the eighth ranked movie in 1955.

==Soundtrack==

All but two of the songs in the movie were hits that Etting had recorded originally back in the 1920s and early 1930s. These new songs, written specifically for the film, are &quot;Never Look Back&quot; by Chilton Price and &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Stop Loving You&quot; by Nicholas Brodzsky and Sammy Cahn.

<text>Pierre Carey le Pelley was Seigneur of Sark from 1849 to 1852. In 1844, desperate for funds to continue the operation of the silver mine on the island, le Pelley&#x27;s father Ernest le Pelley had obtained crown permission to mortgage the Fief of Sark for £4,000 to John Allaire, a local privateer. In 1845, the ceiling of the mine&#x27;s deepest gallery collapsed. The company was uninsured for this, and was finally closed in 1847. Pierre was unable to keep up his mortgage payments and was forced to sell the seigneurie of Sark to Marie Collings, John Allaire&#x27;s daughter and heiress, for £6,000.

<doc id="161441" wikidata="Q7303122" url="?curid=161441" title="Recruitment to the British Army during World War I">
<text>At the beginning of 1914 the British Army had a reported strength of 710,000 men including reserves, of which around 80,000 were professional soldiers ready for war. By the end of the First World War almost 25 percent of the total male population of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland had joined up, over five million men. Of these, 2.67 million joined as volunteers and 2.77 million as conscripts (although some volunteered after conscription was introduced and would most likely have been conscripted anyway). Monthly recruiting rates for the army varied dramatically.

==August 1914==
At the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, the British regular army numbered 247,432 serving officers and other ranks. This did not include reservists liable to be recalled to the colours upon general mobilization or the part-time volunteers of the Territorial Force. About one-third of the peace-time regulars were stationed in India and were not immediately available for service in Europe.

For a century British governmental policy and public opinion were against conscription for foreign wars. At the start of World War I the British Army consisted of six infantry divisions, one cavalry division in the United Kingdom formed shortly after the outbreak of the war, and four divisions located overseas. Fourteen Territorial Force divisions also existed, and 300,000 soldiers were in the Reserve Army. Lord Kitchener, the Secretary of State for War, considered the Territorial Force untrained and useless. He believed that the regular army must not be wasted in immediate battle, but instead used to help train a new army with 70 divisions—the size of the French and German armies—that he foresaw would be needed to fight a war lasting many years.

==British Army medical categories==
All recruits underwent a physical exam by Army medical officers to ascertain whether they would be suitable for military service which used a number and lettering system to categorise the health of each recruit. The following list are the categories used by the British Army in 1914.

* A   Able to march, see to shoot, hear well and stand active service conditions.
:*A1 Fit for dispatching overseas, as regards physical and mental health, and training
:*A2 As A1, except for training
:*A3 Returned Expeditionary Force men, ready except for physical condition
:*A4 Men under 19 who would be A1 or A2 when aged 19

* B   Free from serious organic diseases, able to stand service on lines of communication in France, or in garrisons in the tropics.
:*B1 Able to march 5 miles, see to shoot with glasses, and hear well
:*B2 Able to walk 5 miles, see and hear sufficiently for ordinary purposes
:*B3 Only suitable for sedentary work

* C   Free from serious organic diseases, able to stand service in garrisons at home.
:*C1 Able to march 5 miles, see to shoot with glasses, and hear well
:*C2 Able to walk 5 miles, see and hear sufficiently for ordinary purposes
:*C3 Only suitable for sedentary work

* D   Unfit but could be fit within 6 months.
:*D1 Regular Royal Artillery (RA), Royal Engineers (RE), infantry in Command Depots
:*D2 Regular RA, RE, infantry in Regimental Depots
:*D3 Men in any depot or unit awaiting treatment

===Examinations===
Medical examinations were conducted in a very specific way according to War Office Instructions issued within the &quot;Regulations for the Medical Services of the Army, the Regulations for Recruiting, and the regulations for the Territorial Force&quot; on 1 August 1914. Basic requirements for a recruit was that their height, weight, chest measurement and age all correlated with a standard table. Medical examiners were given the discretion to decide a recruit&#x27;s &quot;apparent age,&quot; based on their appearance and physical stature, when they did not bring satisfactory documentation for proof of age.

Detailed body examinations would include looking for signs of sexually transmitted diseases, vaccination marks, lesions and rashes; the scrotum and anus would also be checked; there would be a stethoscopic examination of the heart, lung and abdomen; the hands and feet, elbows and knees would be studied for lameness, weakness and deformities; teeth (for loss and decay as being unable to chew because of poor oral hygiene was a common cause for failing the medical examination); eyesight and hearing.
Aside from the physical tests, examiners would also the note the intelligence, voice, and character of the recruit in response to questions they would ask him. This would be used to create a psychological profile that would help determine the fitness of the candidate.

===Medical rejections and deferments===
There were numerous medical reasons why recruits might be deemed unfit for service.

* Any signs or symptoms of tuberculosis
* Syphilis
* Any respiratory tract infections
* Palpitations or heart disease
* Generally impaired constitution
* Poor eyesight
* Hearing loss
* Stammering
* Tooth decay that inhibited eating
* Deformity of chest or joints
* Abnormal curvature of spine
* Intelligence
* Hernia
* Haemorrhoids
* Varicose veins or varicocele
* Chronic skin conditions
* Chronic ulcers
* Fistula
* Any other disease or physical defect that would prevent military service
==Volunteer Army, 1914–15==
In 1914, the British had about 5.5 million men of military age, with another 500,000 reaching the age of 18 each year. The first call was for 100,000 volunteers, made on 11 August, followed by another 100,000 on 28 August. By 12 September, almost half a million men had enlisted. At the end of October, 898,005 men had enlisted, of whom approximately 640,000 were non-TF enlistments. Around 250,000 underage boys also volunteered, either by lying about their age or giving false names. These were always rejected if the lie was discovered.

The standard Regular terms of service in the British Army were 7 years service with the colours, and 5 years in the reserve. To facilitate recruitment, supplementary Regular terms of service were announced by Army Order 296 dated 6 August 1914. Recruits to the New Army could serve for “three years or the duration of the war, whichever the longer”. These &quot;General Service&quot; terms were changed by Army Order 470 dated 7 November, simplified to &quot;the duration of the war.&quot; The recruit had the right to choose the regiment they joined. 

To address the short-term need for trained men to replenish the originally deployed BEF units, supplementary Special Reserve terms of service were announced by Army Order 295 dated 6 August 1914, rescinded 7 November 1914. Ex-military men could reenlist for “one year or the duration of the war, whichever the longer”.

It was believed that former NCOs may be reticent to reenlist, having to serve as Privates. Given the need not only for former privates to enlist, but also experienced NCOs to play a part in the expansion of the army, Army Order 315 dated 17 August 1914 clarified matters. It states that &#x27;an ex-non-commissioned officer of the regular army who enlists [under the supplemental terms of service announced on 6 August 1914].. [will be] promoted forthwith to the rank held on discharge.&#x27;

One early peculiarity was the formation of &#x27;pals battalions&#x27;: groups of men from the same factory, football team, bank or similar, joining and fighting together. The idea was first suggested at a public meeting by Lord Derby. Within three days, he had enough volunteers for three battalions. Lord Kitchener gave official approval for the measure almost instantly and the response was impressive. Manchester raised nine specific pals battalions (plus three reserve battalions); one of the smallest was Accrington, in Lancashire, which raised one. One consequence of pals battalions was that a whole town could suffer a severe impact on its military-aged menfolk in a single day of fierce battle.
The women&#x27;s suffrage movement was sharply divided, the slight majority becoming very enthusiastic patriots and asking their members to give white feathers (the sign of the coward) in the streets to men who appeared to be of military age to shame them into service. After assaults became prevalent the Silver War Badge was issued to men who were not eligible or had been medically discharged.

The available pool was diminished by roughly 1.5 million men who were &quot;starred&quot;: kept in essential occupations. Almost 40 percent of the men who volunteered were rejected for medical reasons. Malnutrition was widespread in U.K. society; working class 15‑year‑olds had an average height of only while the upper class was .

From the start Kitchener insisted that the British must build a massive army for a long war, arguing that the British were obliged to mobilise to the same extent as the French and Germans. His goal was 70 divisions, and the Adjutant General asked for 92,000 recruits per month, well above the number volunteering (see the graph). The obvious remedy was conscription, which was a hotly debated political issue. Many Liberals, including Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, were ideologically opposed to compulsion, but by 1915 they were wavering.&lt;br&gt;
15 July 1915 the National Registration Act was passed by the British Government, exactly one month later there was a census of every citizen aged 15 to 65, approximately 29 million forms completed. A pink coloured registration card was issued to each registree, listing pertinent data. These records were ordered to be destroyed in 1921, yet some did survive, including the lately discovered forms of 2,409 women living in Cirencester, since transcribed and made publicly available.
The Cabinet were given a strong warning in September 1915 in a paper presented by their only Labour member, Minister of Education Arthur Henderson. He argued many working men would strongly resist serving a nation in which they did not have a legitimate share in governing. They resented the idea of being dragooned to face possible death by a Parliament they had no part in electing—forty percent of men over 21 were denied the vote by the franchise and registration laws (until the Representation of the People Act of 1918). To them conscription was yet another theft of working men&#x27;s rights by rich capitalists. The only counter-argument the Government could offer was it was of absolute necessity. Workers must be convinced that there were too few volunteers to meet the need, meaning the loss of the war and the end of Britain! Army leaders should convince Union leaders by stating military facts. Henderson&#x27;s own son was killed in the war a year later.

==The Derby Scheme==
The Derby Scheme was launched in Autumn 1915 by the Earl of Derby, Kitchener&#x27;s new Director General of Recruiting, to determine how many new recruits could be signed up, using appointed canvassers visiting eligible men at home to persuade them to &#x27;volunteer&#x27; for war service.

The scheme announcement caused an initial rise in recruitment, as some preferred to go to the recruiting office rather than wait for the inevitable. The process began with each eligible man&#x27;s registry card, from the August 1915 National Registry, being copied onto another card which was sent to his local constituency&#x27;s Parliamentary recruiting committee. This Committee appointed &#x27;canvassers&#x27; who they considered &quot;tactful and influential men&quot;, and not themselves liable for service, to visit the men in their homes. Many canvassers were experienced in politics, though discharged veterans and the fathers of serving soldiers proved the most effective, while some just used threats to persuade. Although women were not allowed to canvas, they did contribute by tracking men who had moved address.

Every man would be given a copy of a letter from the Earl of Derby, explaining the programme and stating that they were in &quot;a country fighting, as ours is, for its very existence&quot;. and had to state whether or not he was willing to attest to enlist.

Those who did agree to attest had to promise to present themselves at their recruiting office within 48 hours, while some were accompanied there immediately. If they passed a medical examination, they were sworn in and paid a &#x27;signing bonus&#x27; of 2s 9d. The next day they were transferred to Army Reserve B. A khaki armband bearing the Royal Crown was provided to all who had enlisted, or officially rejected, as well as to starred and discharged men. (This ceased once conscription was introduced, Jan.1916). &lt;br&gt;
The enlistee&#x27;s data was copied onto another card and used to assign him to one of 46 married or unmarried age groups, and promised that only entire groups would be called for active service, after 14 days prior notice. Single men&#x27;s groups would be called before married, any who wed after the day the scheme began were still classified as single. Married men were assured their group would not be called if too few single men attested – unless conscription was introduced.

The scheme was undertaken during November–December 1915 and obtained 318,553 medically fit single men. However, 38% of single men and 54% of married men had resisted the orchestrated pressure to enlist in the war, so the British Government, determined to ensure a supply of replacements for mounting casualties overseas, instead passed The Military Service Act of compulsory conscription, 27 January 1916.

==Conscription 1916–1918==
As there were too few volunteers to fill the ranks, the Military Service Bill was introduced in January 1916, with compulsory conscription for the first time in Britain&#x27;s history. Every unmarried man and childless widower between 18 and 41 was offered three choices:
# Enlist at once.
# Attest at once under Derby&#x27;s system.
# Or on 2 March 1916 be automatically deemed to have enlisted.

In May 1916 the bill was extended to married men and in April 1918 the upper age was raised to 50 (or 56 if need arose). Ireland was excluded due to the 1916 Easter Uprising, yet many Irish men still volunteered to enlist.

One of the immediate effects of conscription was the biggest protest demonstration Britain had seen since the 1914 anti-war protests. Thousands marched from London&#x27;s East End to Trafalgar Square, where they listened to speeches from Sylvia Pankhurst and a Glasgow councillor who reported that engineers had come out on strike along the Clyde. The event ended in violence when a group of soldiers and sailors charged the crowd, ripped their banners and threw dye in their faces. Some of the assailants were arrested, but Bow Street magistrates let them off with nominal fines and a warning to &quot;leave these idiots alone in future&quot;.

As Arthur Henderson had warned, compulsion was unpopular, by July 1916, 93,000 (30%) of those called up for military service had failed to appear (In reality they had little chance of escape, although a lucky few were hidden by sympathisers) and 748,587 had claimed an exemption – the men, or their employers, could appeal to a civilian Military Service Tribunal in their district on the grounds of work of national importance, business or domestic hardship, medical unfitness or conscientious objection. Dealing with these cases filled the judicial courts, although the standards of appeal tribunals were dubious: in York a case was determined in an average of eleven minutes, while two minutes was typical at Paddington, London. In addition to those objecting to enlisting, there were 1,433,827 already starred as being in a war occupation, ill or already discharged from service due to illness; the enforced conscription act ultimately failed to satisfy Government demand for lives.
Although it has been the focus of the tribunals&#x27; image since the war, only two percent of those appealing were conscientious objectors. Around 7,000 of them were granted non-combatant duties, while a further 3,000 ended up in special work camps. 6,000 were imprisoned. Forty-two were sent to France to potentially face a firing squad. Thirty five were formally sentenced to death, but immediately reprieved, with ten years penal servitude substituted.

Many of those appealing were given some kind of exemption, usually temporary (between a few weeks and six months) or conditional on their situation at work or home remaining serious enough to warrant their staying at home. In October 1916 1.12 million men held tribunal exemption or had cases pending, by May 1917 this had fallen to 780,000 exempt and 110,000 pending. At this point 1.8 million men were exempted, more men than were serving overseas with the British Army. Some men were exempted on the condition that they joined the Volunteer Training Corps for part-time training and home defence duties; by February 1918, 101,000 men had been directed to the Corps by the tribunals.

A newspaper report on 17 February 1916 listed five sample appeals for exemption from conscription, and their results.

In 1917 the Commons passed a bill to give the vote to all males over 21 (and to many women as well), but it did not become law until 6 February 1918. In the same month occupational exemptions were withdrawn for men 18 to 23, in October 1918 there were 2,574,860 men in reserved occupations. Men aged 18½ were sent to the fronts starting in March 1918, violating a pledge to keep them safe until 19. There were also problems with men&#x27;s suitability for active service. The healthy manpower was simply not there – recruits were sorted into three classes, A, B, and C, in order of fitness for front-line service. In 1918, 75 percent were classed as A, some B men also had to be sent into the trenches.

The upper limit on the number of men conscripted is usually calculated by assuming that all recruits after 1 March 1916 were conscripts: 1,542,807 men, 43.7% of those who served in the Army during the war. However, Derby had enlisted 318,553 single men in Special Reserve B, who were called up in spring 1916, which reduces the conscripted to 37%. The married men who had attested in the Derby plan are harder to categorize because they were not called up from the Reserve but swept up with the rest. It seems that somewhat less than 35% of the men in the army were compelled to serve.

==Ireland==

In 1918, legislation intended to extend conscription to Ireland was opposed by a broad movement of Irish nationalists and the Catholic Church in Ireland. The central role of Sinn Féin in this movement boosted its popularity in the buildup to the November general election.

==Advertising for recruitment==
Official advertising for recruits was in the control of the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee (PRC), but private efforts such as that by the &quot;London Opinion&quot; with the now iconic image of Kitchener were also produced. Posters were prepared in different sizes according to where they would be used; two sizes were common. The PRC was formed of the Prime Minister and heads of political parties later joined by other representatives such as for the Trades Union Congress; its sub-committees handled the preparation and publishing of recruiting materials.

Over the course of the war the PRC was responsible for 164 poster designs and 65 pamphlets. Between those and other advertising materials a total of over 54 million pieces were produced at a cost of £40,000. 
According to numbers of posters produced, the most popular official PRC posters were:
*&quot;Lord Kitchener&quot;, 1915. Posters No. 113 and 117, 145,000 copies
*&quot;Remember Belgium&quot;, 1914–1915. PRC16 and PRC 19, a British soldier on guard while a woman flees her burning home. 140,000 copies
*&quot;Take Up The Sword of Justice&quot;, September 1915 PRC 105, 106, 11. By Bernard Partridge featuring the sinking of the Lusitania in the background with a figure offering a sword, 105,000 copies
*&quot;Serve The Guns&quot; May 1915. PRC 85a, 85b, 85c. Soldier and munitions worker shaking hands. 101,000 copies
*&quot;He did his duty. Will You do Yours&quot;. December 1914. PRC 20. Portrait of Lord Roberts (who had recently died of pneumonia after visiting Indian troops on the Western Front) with his Victoria Cross. 95,000 copies.
The &quot;King&#x27;s Message&quot; reprinted in poster form ran to 290,000 copies.

==Recruiting staff==
Notable men who served as army recruiters during the war included:
*Sergeant John Doogan, Victoria Cross recipient
*Captain Samuel Hoare, later intelligence officer and Conservative politician
*Major Lionel Nathan de Rothschild, banker and Conservative MP (awarded OBE for his services)

<text>Ernest le Pelley, 16th Seigneur of Sark (1801–1849) was the Seigneur of Sark from 1839 to 1849. In 1844, desperate for funds to continue the operation of the silver mine on the island, he obtained crown permission to mortgage the Fief of Sark for £4,000 to John Allaire, a local privateer. In 1845, the ceiling of the mine&#x27;s deepest gallery collapsed. The company was uninsured for this event, and it was finally closed in 1847. Le Pelley&#x27;s heir, Pierre Carey le Pelley was unable to keep up his mortgage payments and was forced to sell the seigneurie of Sark to Marie Collings, John Allaire&#x27;s daughter and heiress, for £6,000.

<text>East of Eden is a novel by American author and Nobel Prize winner John Steinbeck, published in September 1952. Many regard the work as Steinbeck&#x27;s most ambitious novel, and Steinbeck himself considered it his &quot;magnum opus&quot;. Steinbeck said of &quot;East of Eden&quot;, &quot;It has everything in it I have been able to learn about my craft or profession in all these years,&quot; and later said, &quot;I think everything else I have written has been, in a sense, practice for this.&quot; Steinbeck originally addressed the novel to his young sons, Thom and John (then 6 and 4 years old, respectively). Steinbeck wanted to describe the Salinas Valley for them in detail: the sights, sounds, smells, and colors.

&quot;East of Eden&quot; brings to life the intricate details of two families, the Trasks and the Hamiltons, and their interwoven stories. The Hamilton family in the novel is said to be based on the real-life family of Samuel Hamilton, Steinbeck&#x27;s maternal grandfather. A young John Steinbeck also appears briefly in the novel as a minor character.

==Plot==

The story is primarily set in the Salinas Valley, California, between the beginning of the twentieth century and the end of World War I. The first fourteen chapters, set in Connecticut and Massachusetts, go as far back as the American Civil War and serve as backstory for Adam Trask, his brother Charles, their father Cyrus, and Cathy Ames.

In the beginning of &quot;East of Eden&quot;, before introducing his characters, Steinbeck carefully establishes the setting with a description of the Salinas Valley in Central California.

===Synopsis===
Adam Trask – newly wed with newly inherited wealth from his late father – arrives in California and settles with his pregnant wife Cathy Ames in the Salinas Valley. Without Adam&#x27;s knowledge, Cathy had tried to abort the pregnancy with a knitting needle. In their new home, she warns Adam that she had not wanted to move to California and plans to leave as soon as she can. Adam dismisses her, saying &quot;Nonsense!&quot;

Cathy gives birth to twin boys, shoots Adam in the shoulder after convincing him to unlock the bedroom door, and flees. Adam survives and falls into a deep depression. His Chinese-American servant, Lee, and his neighbor, the inventive Irish immigrant Samuel Hamilton, rouse Adam out of it enough for him to name his sons Aaron and Caleb, after biblical characters.

Lee becomes a good friend and adopted family member and has long philosophical talks with Adam and Samuel, particularly about the story of Cain and Abel. Maintaining that it has been imperfectly translated in English-language bibles, Lee tells how his relatives in San Francisco, a group of Chinese scholars, spent two years studying Hebrew so that they might discover the moral of the Cain and Abel story. Their discovery that the Hebrew word &quot;timshel&quot; means &quot;thou mayest&quot;, which becomes an important symbol in the novel of a person&#x27;s power to choose their paths, meaning that human beings are neither compelled to pursue sainthood nor doomed to sin.

Meanwhile, Cathy becomes a prostitute at the most respectable brothel in the city of Salinas. She renames herself &quot;Kate Albey&quot;, ingratiates herself with the madam, murders her, and inherits the business. She makes her new brothel infamous as a den of sexual sadism and a source of blackmail on the rich and powerful of Salinas Valley.

Adam&#x27;s sons, Caleb (&quot;Cal&quot;) and Aaron (&quot;Aron&quot;) – echoing Cain and Abel – grow up oblivious of their mother&#x27;s situation. They are opposites: Aron is virtuous and dutiful, Cal wild and rebellious. At an early age, Aron meets a girl, Abra Bacon, from a well-to-do family, and the two fall in love. Although there are rumors around town that Cal and Aron&#x27;s mother is not dead but is actually still in Salinas, the boys do not yet know that she is Kate.

Inspired by Samuel&#x27;s inventiveness, Adam starts an ill-fated business venture and loses almost all of the family fortune. The boys, particularly Aron, are horrified that their father is now the town&#x27;s laughingstock and are mocked by their peers for his failure.

As the boys reach the end of their school days, Cal decides to pursue a career in farming, and Aron goes to college to become an Episcopal priest. Cal, restless and tortured by guilt about his very human failings, shuns everyone around him and takes to wandering around town late at night. During one of these ramblings, he discovers that his mother is alive and the madam of a brothel. He goes to see her, and she spitefully tells him they are just alike. Cal replies that she is simply afraid and leaves.

Cal goes into business with Samuel&#x27;s son Will, who is now a successful automobile dealer. Cal&#x27;s plan is to earn his father&#x27;s approval and his money back by capitalizing on World War I and selling beans grown in the Salinas Valley to nations in Europe for a considerable profit. He succeeds beyond his wildest expectations and wraps up a gift of $15,000 in cash which he plans to give to Adam at Thanksgiving.

Aron returns from Stanford University for the holiday. There is tension in the air because Aron has not yet told their father that he intends to drop out of college. Rather than let Aron steal the moment, Cal gives Adam the money at dinner, expecting his father to be proud of him. Adam refuses to accept it, however, and tells Cal to give it back to the poor farmers he exploited.

In a fit of rage and jealousy, Cal takes Aron to see their mother, knowing it will be a shock to him. Sure enough, Aron immediately sees Kate for who she is and recoils from her in disgust. Wracked with self-hatred, Kate signs her estate over to Aron and commits suicide.

Aron, his idealistic worldview shattered, enlists in the Army to fight in World War I. He is killed in action in the last year of the war, and Adam suffers a stroke upon hearing the news from Lee. Cal, who began a relationship with Aron&#x27;s girlfriend Abra after Aron went to war, tries to convince her to run away with him. She instead persuades him to return home.

Lee pleads with the bedridden and dying Adam to forgive his only remaining son. Adam responds by non-verbally indicating that he forgives Cal and then says &quot;timshel,&quot; giving Cal the choice to break the cycle and conquer sin.

== Characters ==
* The Trask family: Cyrus Trask, Mrs. Trask, Alice, Adam, Charles, Cathy Ames, Aron, Caleb
* The Hamilton family: Samuel Hamilton, Liza, George, Will, Tom, Joe, Lizzie, Una, Dessie, Olive, Mollie
* Other characters: Lee, Abra Bacon, Mr. Edwards, Faye, Ethel, Joe Valery

==Major themes==
The book explores themes of depravity, beneficence, love, the struggle for acceptance and greatness, the capacity for self-destruction, and of guilt and freedom. It ties these themes together with references to and many parallels with the biblical Book of Genesis (especially Genesis Chapter 4, the story of Cain and Abel).

Steinbeck&#x27;s inspiration for the novel comes from the fourth chapter of Genesis, verses one through sixteen, which recounts the story of Cain and Abel. Steinbeck took the title, &quot;East of Eden,&quot; from Genesis, Chapter 4, verse 16: &quot;And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the Land of Nod, on the east of Eden&quot; (King James Version).

Other biblical parallels in the novel include:


In the novel, Adam, Samuel, and Lee have a significant conversation in which they realize that since Abel died before he had children, they themselves are the descendants of Cain. This is because Noah was descended from Seth. It is unclear, however, whether Noah&#x27;s wife (or his sons&#x27; wives) were descended from Seth, Cain, or other of Adam and Eve&#x27;s children.

=== &quot;Timshel&quot; ===
&quot;Timshel&quot; is a major theme in the novel. However, there is no word &quot;timshel&quot; in Hebrew; Genesis 4:7 reads &quot;timshol&quot; () , the second person singular masculine future indicative form of the verb &quot;moshel&quot; &#x27;to rule&#x27;, thus &#x27;you shall/will rule&#x27;. In the novel itself, the character Lee explains the meaning of &quot;timshel&quot; as &quot;Thou mayest.&quot;

Daniel Levin explores the nuances of Steinbeck&#x27;s use of the Hebrew word, investigating potential reasons for and implications of Steinbeck&#x27;s error in translation.

== Development history ==
As he wrote the novel, Steinbeck went through a number of possible titles for the book, including &quot;The Salinas Valley&quot;, the working title from the beginning; &quot;My Valley&quot;, after a Texas businessman suggested he make it more universal; &quot;Down to the Valley&quot;; and then, after he decided to incorporate the Biblical allusion directly into the title, &quot;Cain Sign&quot;. It was only upon transcribing the 16 verses of Cain and Abel in the text itself that he enthusiastically took the last three words of the final verse, &quot;East of Eden&quot;:

&quot;And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord and dwelt in the land of Nod on the east of Eden.&quot; (Genesis 4:16)

Steinbeck wrote to a friend after completing his manuscript, &quot;I finished my book a week ago. [...] Much the longest and surely the most difficult work I have ever done... I have put all the things I have wanted to write all my life. This is &#x27;the book.&#x27; If it is not good I have fooled myself all the time. I don&#x27;t mean I will stop but this is a definite milestone and I feel released. Having done this I can do anything I want. Always I had this book waiting to be written.&quot;

==Publication history==
&quot;East of Eden&quot; was first published by Viking Press in September 1952. The first edition had two print runs: 1,500 copies were signed by Steinbeck; the second run was of unsigned copies. In both print runs, there is a spelling mistake on page 281, line 38: &quot;I remember holding the bite of a line while Tom drove pegs and braided a splice.&quot; The word &quot;bite&quot; was mistakenly changed from the original word, &quot;bight,&quot; during proofreading.

== Reception ==
Upon the release of &quot;East of Eden&quot; in September 1952, the general reading public took it to heart and quickly propelled it to the number one spot on the fiction best-seller list. In a letter to a friend, Steinbeck wrote &quot;I am getting flocks of letters ... People write as though it were their book.&quot;

However, literary critics were not as gracious, calling the novel heavy-handed and unconvincing, especially in its use of Biblical allusion. Many critics found the novel repulsive yet captivating due to its portrayal of violence and sexual sadism. In particular, critics found the character Cathy (and her brutality) to be wildly unbelievable and off-putting. Others found Steinbeck&#x27;s philosophy to be too strong in the novel and claimed that he was a moralist. According to critics, Steinbeck&#x27;s portrayal of good and evil was both hyperbolic and oversimplified, especially in the character of Cathy.

Besides criticizing the major themes of the novel, others attacked his construction and narrative. For example, critics were perplexed at a lack of unity in the novel as Steinbeck attempted to incorporate the stories of two families. Many found the first-person narration distracting, as it appears inconsistently throughout the novel. Critics also disparaged the symbolism as obvious, the narrative as disorganized, and the characters as unrealistic.

These aspects are what the reading public loved. &quot;East of Eden&quot; became an instant bestseller in November 1952, a month after it was released, and is now considered one of Steinbeck&#x27;s finest achievements. About 50,000 copies of the novel are sold each year. Its popularity skyrocketed once again in 2003 after being named Oprah&#x27;s Book Club pick; it gained the top spot in the New York Times&#x27; Paperback Best Sellers list and remains exceedingly popular with the general reading public.

==Adaptations==
*The book was adapted for cinema in the 1955 film &quot;East of Eden&quot; by director Elia Kazan, starring James Dean, Julie Harris, Richard Davalos, Raymond Massey, Jo Van Fleet, and Burl Ives. The movie deals only with the fourth and final part of the book; Dean acts the part of Adam&#x27;s son Cal, while Davalos plays Aron, Cal&#x27;s twin brother.
*In 1981, ABC produced a miniseries adaptation of the novel. It aired in three installments and starred Karen Allen, Anne Baxter, Hart Bochner, Timothy Bottoms, Sam Bottoms, Bruce Boxleitner, Lloyd Bridges, Howard Duff, Warren Oates, Soon-Tek Oh, and Jane Seymour.
*In 1995, Takarazuka Revue&#x27;s Flower Troupe staged a musical production of the fourth and final part of the book. The production was written and directed by Tani Masazumi, and starred Maya Miki as Cal and Junna Risa as Abra.
* In 1998, Australian theatre producer Rob Croser of Independent Theatre collaborated with Elaine Steinbeck in a stage production in Adelaide. 
*From 2009 onwards, Universal Pictures has made various attempts to schedule production on another film adaptation based on the novel. Previously, one version separate from Universal&#x27;s version was attempted, with Ron Howard and Paul Attanasio attached. The first attempt under Universal would have been with Tom Hooper directing from a screenplay written by Christopher Hampton, around 2009. In 2013, Gary Ross became attached to the project as writer and director, with Jennifer Lawrence being cast in the role of Cathy Ames shortly thereafter. In April 2014, Ross said that the film will be split into two.
*In 2015, the Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago adapted the novel for the stage.
*, Netflix is adapting the novel into a limited series, with Zoe Kazan writing and executive producing and Florence Pugh attached to star and co-produce.

<text>Ernest Arthur Gardner (16 March 186227 November 1939) was an English archaeologist. He was the director of the British School at Athens between 1887 and 1895.

==Early life==
Gardner was born in Clapton, London, England on 16 March 1862 to Thomas Gardner and Ann Pearse. He was educated at the City of London School, a boys&#x27; private day school located in the City of London. He entered Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge in 1880. He read for a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Classics and graduated with a double first in 1884.

==Career==

===Early academic career===
Gardner became a fellow of Gonville and Caius College in 1885. In 1885 and 1886, as part of the Egypt Exploration Society, he was involved in the excavations at Naucratis, Egypt. He became a student of the British School at Athens under Francis Penrose in 1886. From 1887 to 1895 he was director of the school. During his first term as director, he led excavations at Old Paphos and Salamis in Cyprus. When his directorship was extended in 1891, he led an excavation in Megalopolis, Greece.

After resigning from the British School at Athens in 1895, he took up the position of Yates Professor of Classical Art and Archaeology at the University of London in 1896, and held that position until 1929. He became editor of The Journal of Hellenic Studies in 1897. He was dean of the Faculty of Arts of the University of London from 1905 to 1909 and again from 1913 to 1915. He was elected as the first Public Orator of London University in 1910.

===Military service===
At the outbreak of World War I, Gardner was commissioned into the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve as a lieutenant commander. He served as a naval intelligence officer at Salonika, Greece from 1915 to 1917. While based there, he organised the removal of the area&#x27;s archaeological remains to the protection of the White Tower of Thessaloniki. For this action, he was awarded the Gold Cross of the Order of the Redeemer in 1918 by the Greeks. In late 1917 he returned to England and joined the Admiralty. He continued his service in naval intelligence until early 1919.

===Later career and life===
Gardner resigned from his positions as Public Orator of London University in 1929 and as editor of The Journal of Hellenic Studies in 1932. He was Vice-Chancellor of the University of London between 1924 and 1926. From 1929 to 1932, he was president of the Hellenic Society. He continued lecturing at the University of London until 1933.

Gardner died on 27 November 1939 in Maidenhead, Berkshire, United Kingdom.

==Personal life==
Gardner married Mary Wilson (died 1936) in 1887. Together they had one son and two daughters. His daughter Phyllis Gardner was a writer and artist, whose relationship with poet Rupert Brooke has come to light with two 2015 publications.

His sister Alice Gardner was a historian and his brother, Percy Gardner, was also an archaeologist.

==Select works==
His publications include: &quot;Introduction to Greek Epigraphy&quot; (1887); &quot;Ancient Athens&quot; (1902); &quot;Handbook of Greek Sculpture&quot; (1905); &quot;Six Greek Sculptors&quot; (1910); &quot;Poet and Artist in Greece: With Illustrations&quot; (1933; Japanese translation by Keiji Kokubu available, Sogensha Press, 1944).

<text>The Man with the Golden Arm is a 1955 American independent drama film noir directed by Otto Preminger, based on the novel of the same name by Nelson Algren. Starring Frank Sinatra, Eleanor Parker, Kim Novak, Arnold Stang and Darren McGavin, it recounts the story of a drug addict who gets clean while in prison, but struggles to stay that way in the outside world. Although the addictive drug is never identified in the film, according to the American Film Institute &quot;most contemporary and modern sources assume that it is heroin&quot;, although in Algren&#x27;s book it is morphine. The film&#x27;s initial release was controversial for its treatment of the then-taboo subject of drug addiction.

It was nominated for three Academy Awards: Sinatra for Best Actor in a Leading Role, Joseph C. Wright and Darrell Silvera for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Black-and-White and Elmer Bernstein for Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture. Sinatra was also nominated for best actor awards by the BAFTAs and The New York Film Critics. The film is in the public domain, and in 2020 was added into the National Film Registry.

==Plot==
Frankie Machine is released from the federal Narcotic Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, and returns to his run-down neighborhood on the North Side of Chicago. A drug addict (the drug is never named, but heroin is strongly implied), Frankie became clean in prison. On the outside, he greets friends and acquaintances. Sparrow, who runs a con selling homeless dogs, clings to him like a younger brother, but Schwiefka, whom Frankie used to deal for in his illegal card game, has more sinister reasons for welcoming him back, as does Louie, Machine&#x27;s former drug dealer.

Frankie returns home to his wife Zosh, who supposedly needs to use a wheelchair after a car crash years earlier that was caused by Frankie driving drunk. Zosh is secretly recovered but pretends to be unable to walk to guilt Frankie into staying with her. He thinks he has what it takes to play drums for a big band. While calling to make an appointment, he bumps into an old flame, Molly, who works in a strip joint as a hostess and lives in the apartment below Frankie&#x27;s. Unlike Zosh, Molly encourages his dream of becoming a drummer.

Frankie soon gets an audition and asks Sparrow to get him a new suit, but the suit is stolen and he ends up in a cell at a local Chicago police precinct. Schwiefka offers to pay the bail. Frankie refuses at first because he thinks that Schwiefka told the police that the suit is stolen. But soon Frankie changes his mind, hoping to get out and have an audition.

To repay the debt for his bail, he deals cards for Schwiefka again. Soon Frankie succumbs and is back on drugs and dealing marathon all-night card games for Schwiefka. He gets a tryout as a drummer but spends 24 hours straight dealing a poker game, during which he is discovered cheating and beaten up. At the audition, with withdrawal coming on, Frankie cannot keep the beat and ruins his chance of landing the job. When Louie goes to see Zosh to try to find Frankie, he discovers that she has been faking her paralysis. Zosh, scared of being found out, pushes Louie over the railing of the stairwell to his death, but Frankie is sought for the murder.

Frankie goes to Molly hoping to get money for a fix. After learning that Captain Bednar and the police are looking for him, Molly convinces him that he must go cold turkey if he is to stand a chance with the police. Frankie agrees and is locked in Molly&#x27;s apartment where he goes through a grueling withdrawal to clear the drugs from his body. Finally clean again, he tells Zosh he is going to leave her, start anew, and stand trial. In her desperation to keep Frankie from leaving her, Zosh gives herself away, standing up in front of Frankie and the police. She runs but gets no farther than the outside balcony. Trapped, she throws herself off the balcony to her death. A police ambulance arrives to remove Zosh&#x27;s lifeless body and drives away, while Frankie watches in dismay. He walks away, with Molly following as Sparrow walks away in the opposite direction.

==Differences from the novel==

After replacing novel author and original screenwriter Nelson Algren with Walter Newman, Preminger proceeded to change the plot and characters extensively from the original novel, which led to feelings of bitterness from Algren. When photographer and friend Art Shay asked Algren to pose below the film&#x27;s marquee, he is reported to have said, &quot;What does that movie have to do with me?&quot;

Even though the first draft of the novel did not even deal with drug addiction (it was only added later), this became the singular focus of the film. In the novel, Frankie served in World War II and became addicted to morphine following treatment for a war injury. There is little mention of Frankie&#x27;s film counterpart serving in the war, and he tells Molly that he started drugs &quot;for kicks.&quot;

In Algren&#x27;s novel, Frankie is a blond-haired man in his late 20s, and as a poor veteran he often wears a torn Army jacket and brogans. Played by Sinatra (who was nearly 40 years old at the time), the film&#x27;s protagonist has dark hair and normally wears slacks and a dress shirt. In the film he is given a drum set and almost lands a job as a big band drummer, but in the novel he only has a practice pad, and his dream of being a drummer is only a fleeting aspiration.

The novel implies that Zosh&#x27;s paralysis is a symptom of her mental illness, but in the film she is deliberately deceiving Frankie and is fully able to walk.

The novel&#x27;s version of Violet (&quot;Vi&quot;) is an attractive young woman and Sparrow&#x27;s love interest. In the film, she is played by Doro Merande, who was in her 60s at the time. The movie combines the character of her spouse, &quot;Old Husband&quot; Koskozka, with that of the landlord, &quot;Jailer&quot; Schwabatski.

Frankie&#x27;s employer, Schwiefka, is a relatively neutral character in the novel, but in the film he is a villain and Nifty Louie&#x27;s partner.

In the novel, Frankie inadvertently kills Nifty Louie during a fight, while in the film, a walking Zosh pushes Louie to his death.

Algren&#x27;s novel ends with a cornered and hopeless Frankie committing suicide, but in the film Zosh is the one who dies, while Sinatra&#x27;s Frankie and Novak&#x27;s Molly survive the end of the film together.

In April 1956, Preminger and others were sued by Algren, who was seeking an injunction to keep him from claiming ownership of the property as &quot;An Otto Preminger Film&quot;. Algren&#x27;s suit said the original agreement in 1949 for the film rights had promised him a percentage of the gross for the screen rights. However, he had to drop the suit because he could not afford the legal fees.

==Production==

Screen rights to Algren&#x27;s novel were first acquired in 1949 on behalf of John Garfield, who planned to star in the film version. However, production was delayed because the Production Code Authority (PCA) refused to approve the script, with Joseph Breen stating that the basic story was &quot;unacceptable&quot; because of the Code&#x27;s prohibition on showing illegal drug trafficking and drug addiction. The ability to obtain PCA approval was critical because at that time, many movie theaters would not show films that had not received approval. The PCA further predicted that the subject would also be unacceptable to the National Legion of Decency (a Catholic film censor board), Federal authorities, and state and local censor boards in the United States and abroad. Garfield died in 1952 and the film rights were acquired by Otto Preminger from his estate.

Preminger had previously released &quot;The Moon Is Blue&quot; (1953), which succeeded at the box office despite being denied the Production Code seal of approval due to its sexual subject matter. He told Peter Bogdanovich why he was attracted to Algren&#x27;s novel: &quot;I think there&#x27;s a great tragedy in any human being who gets hooked on something, whether it&#x27;s heroin or love or a woman or whatever.&quot; Although United Artists (UA) had a distribution contract with Preminger, a clause in the contract allowed them to withdraw if a film failed to get Code approval. Preminger stated that in that event, he would set up his own company to handle distribution of &quot;The Man with the Golden Arm&quot;. Preminger continued to have problems with the PCA during the making of the film.

Although the novel&#x27;s author, Nelson Algren, was initially brought to Hollywood to work on the screenplay, he and Preminger were incompatible from the start and the situation did not improve. Algren was quickly replaced by Walter Newman. Preminger and Newman made significant changes to Algren&#x27;s original story,

Frank Sinatra jumped at a chance to star in the film before reading the entire script. The script was given to Marlon Brando around the same time as Sinatra, who still harbored some anger at Brando for beating out Sinatra for the lead role in &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;. To prepare for his role, Sinatra spent time at drug rehabilitation clinics observing addicts going cold turkey. He also learned to play drums from drummer Shelly Manne. The picture was shot in six weeks at RKO Studios in Hollywood from September 26 through November 4, 1955.

Saul Bass designed the crooked arm symbol used in the film&#x27;s advertising campaign, which Preminger liked so much that he threatened to pull the picture if an exhibitor changed the advertisements. Bass also created the animated title sequence for the film, the first of many such sequences that he created for films by Preminger, Alfred Hitchcock, and others.

==Musical score and soundtrack==
The film score was composed, arranged and conducted by Elmer Bernstein, and the soundtrack album was released on the Decca label in February 1956. Allmusic&#x27;s Bradley Torreano called it &quot;one of the finest jazz soundtracks to come out of the &#x27;50s&quot; and said that &quot;on its own it still shines as an excellent example of how good film music can get. Bernstein&#x27;s control over the smallest details of the music is what gives it the energy it contains; his blustery horns and deep percussion are only the front while some gorgeous orchestration happens almost unnoticed behind the music.&quot;

The title theme was recorded by many other musicians including Billy May &amp; His Orchestra who had a #9 hit in the UK in May 1956; Jet Harris, who released it as a single in 1962, Glam rockers Sweet covered the theme on their album &quot;Desolation Boulevard&quot; (Europe LP only), and Barry Adamson, who released a version on his album &quot;Moss Side Story&quot; (1988). A vocal version of the theme called &quot;Delilah Jones&quot;, with lyrics by Sylvia Fine unrelated to the subject matter of the film, was released by the McGuire Sisters on Coral Records in 1956.

A vocal version of Bernstein&#x27;s composition &quot;Molly&quot; with lyrics by Fine, entitled &quot;Molly-O&quot;, was also recorded by a number of artists, including The Gaylords, Dick Jacobs and his orchestra, and others.

An alternate theme song, &quot;The Man With the Golden Arm&quot;, was composed by Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen, and recorded by Sinatra backed by Nelson Riddle&#x27;s orchestra. However, the song was ultimately not used in the film and did not appear on the soundtrack album. Although Sinatra&#x27;s recording appeared on some bootleg albums, it remained officially unreleased until 2002, when it was included in the box set &quot;Frank Sinatra in Hollywood 1940–1964&quot;. Sammy Davis Jr. also recorded a version of the Cahn/ Van Heusen theme, which was released on Decca in 1955.

==Release==
===Controversy over release===
Preminger decided to release the finished film prior to submitting it for a Code seal of approval. He contended that his film would not entice any viewers to take drugs, since drug use was depicted as having severely negative consequences. United Artists, which had invested $1 million in the film&#x27;s production, opted to distribute the film, even though doing so could result in the company being fined $25,000 by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). The president of United Artists, Arthur Krim, expressed the company&#x27;s hope that the PCA would make an exception to its usual rules and grant the film approval because of the film&#x27;s &quot;immense potential for public service.&quot; The film received several advance bookings in November and early December 1955, before the PCA had made a decision on whether to grant a Code seal.

However, in early December 1955, the PCA denied the film a Code seal, and the decision was upheld upon appeal to the MPAA. As a result, United Artists resigned from the MPAA that same month (although the company re-joined a few years later). The National Legion of Decency also showed disagreement with the PCA ruling by rating the film as a &quot;B&quot; meaning &quot;morally objectionable in part for all&quot;, instead of a &quot;C&quot; meaning &quot;condemned&quot;, which was the rating normally given to films that were denied a Code seal. Large theater circuits including Loews also refused to ban the film and instead showed it despite the lack of a Code seal. As a result of the controversy, the MPAA investigated and revised production codes, allowing later movies more freedom to deeply explore hitherto taboo subjects such as drug abuse, kidnapping, miscegenation, abortion, and prostitution.

In the end, &quot;The Man with the Golden Arm&quot; finally received the Production Code seal number 20011 in June 1961, which permitted the film to be reissued and sold for television broadcast.

===Reception===
&quot;The Man with the Golden Arm&quot; earned $4,100,000 at the North American box office and the critical reception was just as strong; &quot;Variety&quot; magazine stated: &quot;Otto Preminger&#x27;s &quot;The Man with the Golden Arm&quot; is a feature that focuses on addiction to narcotics. Clinical in its probing of the agonies, this is a gripping, fascinating film, expertly produced and directed and performed with marked conviction by Frank Sinatra as the drug slave.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 81% from 58 reviews.

===Preservation===
The Academy Film Archive preserved &quot;The Man with the Golden Arm&quot; in 2005. In 2020, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

<text>Bad Day at Black Rock is a 1955 American film noir neo-Western film directed by John Sturges with screenplay by Millard Kaufman. It stars Spencer Tracy and Robert Ryan with support from Anne Francis, Dean Jagger, Walter Brennan, John Ericson, Ernest Borgnine and Lee Marvin. The film is a crime drama set in 1945 that contains elements of the revisionist Western genre. In the plot, a one-armed stranger (Tracy) comes to a small desert town and uncovers an evil secret that has corrupted the entire community.

The film is based on a short story called &quot;Bad Time at Honda&quot; by Howard Breslin, published by &quot;The American Magazine&quot; in January 1947. Filming began in July 1954, and the movie went on national release in January 1955. It was a box-office success and was nominated for three Academy Awards in 1956. In 2018, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==

In late 1945, one-armed John J. Macreedy gets off a train at the isolated Californian desert hamlet of Black Rock. The residents are suspicious, as this is the first time in four years that the streamliner express train has stopped at the tiny flag stop station. After Macreedy states that he is looking for a man named Komoko, several of the local men become hostile. Hastings, the telegraph agent, tells him that there are no taxis, the hotel desk clerk, Pete Wirth, claims that he has no vacant rooms, and Hector David threatens him. Later, Reno Smith informs Macreedy that Komoko, a Japanese-American, was interned during World War II.

Macreedy visits Sheriff Tim Horn, but the alcoholic lawman is of no help. The veterinarian and undertaker, Doc Velie, advises Macreedy to leave town immediately, but lets it slip that Komoko is dead. Pete&#x27;s sister, Liz, rents a Jeep for Macreedy. He drives to nearby Adobe Flat, where he finds a homestead burned to the ground and wildflowers growing nearby. As Macreedy drives back, Coley Trimble tries to run him off the road. Macreedy tries to leave town, but Liz, having been previously confronted by Smith, refuses to rent him the Jeep again. When Smith asks about his missing left arm, Macreedy says that he lost it fighting in Italy. Macreedy says that the wildflowers at the Komoko place make him suspect that a body is buried there. Smith reveals that he is virulently anti-Japanese; he tried to enlist the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor but failed the physical.

Macreedy tries to telephone the state police, but Pete refuses to put the call through. Doc Velie admits that something terrible happened four years ago, but Smith has everyone too terrified to speak up. Velie offers his hearse to Macreedy to leave town, but Hector disables it by yanking out the cables. Macreedy writes a telegram to the California police summoning help and gives it to Hastings.

Macreedy goes to the diner, where Trimble provokes a fight, but Macreedy, despite having only one arm, easily throws him to the ground using martial arts. Macreedy confronts Smith and accuses him of killing Komoko with the help of others. Hastings arrives and tries to give Smith a piece of paper, but Macreedy snatches it. It is his unsent draft of a telegram. Macreedy and Velie tell Hastings that he has broken the law and demand that Horn take action. Horn stands up to arrest Hastings, but Smith pulls the sheriff&#x27;s badge off Horn&#x27;s shirt and pins it on Hector, who casually tears up the telegram.

After Smith and Hector leave, Macreedy reveals that the loss of his arm had left him wallowing in self-pity, but Trimble&#x27;s attempt to kill him has reinvigorated him. Macreedy finally reveals that Komoko&#x27;s son died in combat (with the 442nd Infantry Regiment) while saving his life. Macreedy came to give the man&#x27;s medal to Komoko. Macreedy learns that the elder Komoko had leased some farmland from Smith, who was sure that there was no water. Komoko dug a well and found water. After Smith was rejected for military service, he and the other men began drinking, and decided to scare Komoko. The old man barricaded himself inside his home, but the men set it on fire. When Komoko emerged ablaze, Smith shot and killed him.

Doc and Pete enlist Liz to help Macreedy to escape under cover of darkness. Hector is standing guard outside the hotel; Pete lures him into the office, where Doc Velie knocks him unconscious. Liz drives Macreedy out of town but stops at Adobe Flat. Macreedy realizes that he has been set up. When Smith starts shooting at him, Macreedy shelters behind the Jeep. Liz rushes to Smith despite Macreedy&#x27;s warning. Smith tells her that she has to die with the rest of his accomplices, and shoots her in the back as she flees.

Macreedy finds a bottle and fills it with gasoline from the Jeep. When Smith climbs down for a better shot, Macreedy throws the Molotov cocktail, setting Smith on fire. Macreedy drives back to town with Smith and Liz&#x27;s body. The state police are called, and several arrests are made. As Macreedy is leaving, Velie requests Komoko&#x27;s medal to help Black Rock heal. Macreedy gives it to him before boarding the train.

==Cast==
The small cast includes three past and two future Academy Award winners; one past Academy Award nominee; and one future Golden Globe winner. Brennan (1936, 1938, 1940), Jagger (1950) and Tracy (1938, 1939) had all won Academy Awards. Ryan (1948) had been nominated for one. In subsequent years, Borgnine (1956) and Marvin (1965) both won Academy Awards; and Francis (1965) won a Golden Globe.

==Production==

&quot;Bad Day at Black Rock&quot; originated as a short story by Howard Breslin with full-color illustrations by Robert Fawcett. Titled &quot;Bad Time at Honda&quot;, it was published by &quot;The American Magazine&quot; in January 1947. It was adapted into a script by Don McGuire and pitched to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer production head Dore Schary, who was known for championing films that addressed social problems. Schary had previously produced &quot;Go for Broke!&quot; (1951), based on the exploits of the segregated Japanese-American 442nd Regimental Combat Team. Breslin novelized the script, using the pseudonym Michael Niall. His book was published in 1954 by Fawcett Publications.

Schary acquired the film rights for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, but he hired Millard Kaufman to rewrite McGuire&#x27;s script. The producers were worried about the title because &quot;Bad Time at Honda&quot; was similar to &quot;Hondo&quot;, recently made with John Wayne. Kaufman suggested changing the name of the town to Black Rock, after a real town in Arizona. Kaufman finished the script in fall 1953.

Although Spencer Tracy was 54 and much older than the platoon leader in the original story, Schary wanted Tracy to play the lead role. John Sturges was hired as director in June 1954, and shooting began the following month near Lone Pine, California, where the small town set had been quickly constructed. Just before shooting began, an indecisive Tracy tried to back out of the picture. Schary made clear that he was willing to sue the actor if he quit the film. &quot;Bad Day at Black Rock&quot; was Tracy&#x27;s final film for MGM, with the exception of &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; (1963), for which he supplied the narration.

Budget for the film was $1.3 million and it was shot in color using Cinemascope because Schary thought that widescreen would emphasize the menace of the isolated town. Temperatures on location were over . On August 9, the cast and crew relocated to the MGM studio lot in Culver City. André Previn was hired to write the score.

Although the film is essentially a crime drama set in 1945, it is recognized as a neo-Western, with strong links to the revisionist Western genre. The premiere was at Loew&#x27;s 72nd Street Theatre in New York City on December 8, 1954. The film was released nationally in January 1955. According to MGM records, it earned US$1,966,000 in the US and Canada, and $1,822,000 elsewhere, making the studio a profit of $947,000.

The plot of the movie—a small western desert town hiding a guilty secret, or protecting a local person from outside law enforcement officers—was borrowed many times by US television crime shows. Detective and crime series as diverse as &quot;Cannon&quot;, &quot;Kojak&quot;, &quot;The A-Team&quot; and &quot;Remington Steele&quot;, among others, each had an episode similar to the plot of &quot;Bad Day at Black Rock&quot;. In the case of &quot;Kojak&quot; and &quot;Remington Steele&quot;, the film is actually mentioned in the dialogue of the episodes.

==Themes==
Film historian Stuart M. Kaminsky, in &quot;American Film Genres&quot; (1985), contrasts the ideology that guides Spencer Tracy&#x27;s McCreedy, with the key motivating factor in samurai tradition:

Although essentially a crime drama with revisionist Western overtones, the film is one of the first to recognize discrimination against Japanese Americans in World War II. No Japanese American characters are portrayed, although Komoko and his son, both dead, are central to the plot. In her 1991 documentary film &quot;History and Memory: For Akiko and Takashige&quot;, Rea Tajiri uses footage from &quot;Bad Day at Black Rock&quot; to illustrate prevailing attitudes toward the Japanese. Tajiri&#x27;s family were among those interned after the attack on Pearl Harbor.

John Streamas describes the film as an indictment of both racism and McCarthyism. He comments on the unusual means of denunciation that it employs, because with no Japanese-American characters in the story, there is no liberation of an oppressed victim. Instead, the plot delivers justice for the victim of a murder that occurred four years earlier.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
When &quot;Bad Day at Black Rock&quot; was released, the reviews were almost universally positive, with, for example, John O&#x27;Hara in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; hailing it as &quot;one of the finest motion pictures ever made&quot;. Many reviewers noted the film&#x27;s Western-like elements, comparing it favorably with &quot;High Noon&quot;, and cinematographer William C. Mellor was widely praised for his use of widescreen.

Film critic Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Slowly, through a process of guarded discourse, which director John Sturges has built up by patient, methodical pacing, an eerie light begins to glimmer.&quot; At the end of 1955, &quot;The New York Times&quot; included the film in its best ten of the year.

Despite a storyline that she called &quot;crudely melodramatic&quot;, Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; heaped praise on the film for its direction and cinematography, calling it &quot;a very superior example of motion picture craftsmanship&quot;. In 2017, critic Bilge Ebiri considered it to be &quot;one of the greatest films ever made.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; magazine&#x27;s reviewer wrote, &quot;Considerable excitement is whipped up in this suspense drama, and fans who go for tight action will find it entirely satisfactory. Besides telling a yarn of tense suspense, the picture is concerned with a social message on civic complacency.&quot;

<text>James Philip Milner (born 4 January 1986) is an English professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for club Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. A versatile player, Milner has played in multiple positions, including on the wing, in midfield and at full back.

Milner&#x27;s talent in football, cricket, and long-distance running was recognised early. He represented Horsforth School in these sports and played football for amateur teams from Rawdon and Horsforth. He supported Leeds United from childhood, joining the Leeds Youth Academy in 1996. He made his debut for the first team in 2002 aged 16 and gained prominence as the youngest player to score in the Premier League, and later spent time on loan at Swindon Town to gain further first-team experience. After Leeds United were relegated at the end of the 2003–04 season, Milner was sold to Newcastle United.

Milner went on to make over 100 appearances for Newcastle United, winning the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2006, and spent a year on loan at Aston Villa, before signing for Aston Villa permanently in 2008. After winning the PFA Young Player of the Year award in 2010, Milner was signed by Manchester City, and went on to win two Premier Leagues, one FA Cup, one League Cup and one FA Community Shield. Milner signed for Liverpool in 2015 on a free transfer, and was appointed vice-captain. He went on to win the UEFA Champions League in 2019, as well as his third Premier League title, the UEFA Super Cup, the FIFA Club World Cup, and another FA Cup and EFL Cup title.

Milner made a record 46 appearances for the England national under-21 football team, playing at the 2007 and 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Championships, finishing as runner-up in the latter. He won 61 caps for the full national team, scoring once against Moldova. He was selected for the 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cup squads, as well as the 2012 and 2016 UEFA European Championships.

==Early life==
James Philip Milner was born on 4 January 1986 in Wortley, Leeds. Milner played most of his childhood football for Westbrook Lane Primary School in Horsforth, where one of his PE teachers and coaches was future Premier League referee Jon Moss, who would give him a red card two decades later.

Milner was later educated at Horsforth School. Graeme Coulson, a coach from Rawdon, recognised Milner&#x27;s talent and persuaded him to play for Rawdon in several tournaments, including a tournament at Rawdon Meadows, where Milner scored four goals in their victory in the final.

Milner was described as a &quot;first class&quot; student at his school; he left with 11 GCSEs and an award for his performance in physical education. He played for the Yorkshire Schools cricket team, was the cross-country champion at his school for three consecutive years and was the district champion over 100 metres for two consecutive seasons. He then completed his studies at Boston Spa School, a sports college which was a partner to the football club.

Milner supported his hometown club Leeds United from a young age. His earliest memory of the team was watching them win the FA Youth Cup in 1993. He and his parents, Peter and Lesley, were season ticket holders and Milner later became a ball boy for the club.

When Milner was 10 years old, he joined the Leeds United Academy after being spotted by a scout while playing for Westbrook Juniors in Horsforth. At the academy, Milner played against contemporaries from other clubs in Northern England, including future Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney. His role model was Leeds-born Alan Smith, who was then a Leeds United striker. Milner believed playing with Smith put him through a learning curve, as Smith had done what Milner aspired to do in coming through the academy and playing for the first team. Having made good progress at the Academy, Milner was taken on as a trainee after leaving school. However, his father insisted that he attend college once a week to continue his education.

Milner continued to excel in the youth team, and played for England at under-15 and under-17 levels. He helped the England under-17 team win the 2002 Nationwide summer tournament against Italy, Czech Republic and Brazil, scoring a goal against Brazil.

==Club career==
===Leeds United===
Milner&#x27;s first-team debut for Leeds came on 10 November 2002, in a match against West Ham United, when he came on as a substitute for Jason Wilcox for the last six minutes. The appearance made him the second-youngest player ever to play in the Premier League, at the age of 16 years and 309 days. On 26 December 2002, at 16 years and 356 days, he became the youngest player to score in the Premier League, with a goal in a 2–1 win against Sunderland. His record was broken by James Vaughan of Everton in 2005. In a match against Chelsea two days later, Milner scored again, with a deft first touch of the ball and manoeuvre, to avoid a tackle from Chelsea defender Marcel Desailly. The manoeuvre created a yard of space for him to deliver a curling shot from . Reporters were impressed by his overall performance in the match, especially by his desire, confidence, and ability with both feet. Chelsea manager Claudio Ranieri remarked after the match that Milner had performed like a much more experienced player. The performance prompted comparisons to England internationals Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney, who had also come to footballing prominence as teenagers.

After more appearances for Leeds, Milner signed a five-year contract with them on 10 February 2003. At the start of the 2003–04 season, Milner was sent on a one-month loan to Second Division club Swindon Town to gain experience as a first-team player. Before the stint, he saw it as a valuable experience as a player. He spent a month with Swindon, playing in six matches and scoring two goals against Peterborough United and Luton Town.

However, Leeds&#x27; fortunes were on the decline; the team became the subject of numerous negative stories in the media, and several first-team players were sold. Milner said he believed that this experience made him emotionally stronger and taught him how to deal with team problems. Leeds&#x27; eventual relegation to the Championship led to speculation over Milner&#x27;s future at the club. Tottenham Hotspur, Aston Villa and Everton all expressed an interest in signing him. Ultimately, Villa and Everton did not make offers and Milner rejected an offer from Tottenham as they were based too far from his family home, where he still lived. Leeds insisted that he would not be sold, with chairman Gerald Krasner referring to him as &quot;the future of Leeds&quot;. Nonetheless, financial problems eventually forced Leeds to sell Milner to Newcastle United for £5 million. Although Milner was not happy to be leaving the club he had supported as a child, he wished to do what was &quot;in the club&#x27;s best interest&quot; and in July 2004, he agreed a five-year contract with Newcastle.

===Newcastle United===
====Early career====
Milner made his first appearance for Newcastle United during their pre-season tour of Asia, scoring his first goal for the club in a 1–1 draw against Kitchee, in Hong Kong. During this tour, he took the opportunity to observe how Newcastle striker Alan Shearer dealt with attention from fans and the media and said that his association with people like Shearer gave him a better idea of how to deal with the media.

Milner&#x27;s first Premier League match for Newcastle came against Middlesbrough on 18 August 2004, in which he played on the right of the field as a winger, despite having featured regularly on the left for Leeds. When asked about this after the match, Milner said he had no preference where on the pitch he played. A month later he made his debut in European competition, when Newcastle played in the UEFA Cup against Bnei Sakhnin from Israel, after coming on as a substitute for Shola Ameobi. In the same month, he scored his first competitive goal for the club, also as a substitute, in a 3–1 win against West Bromwich Albion.

The situation changed for Milner after Newcastle manager Bobby Robson, whom Milner considered his mentor, was sacked and replaced by Graeme Souness. Under Souness, he started 13 league matches, but did not play his first full Premier League match for Newcastle until April 2005. Milner said that he was frustrated at not being used as a starter for most of the season.

At the start of the 2005–06 season, Milner scored in Newcastle&#x27;s 3–1 away win against FK ZTS Dubnica in the UEFA Intertoto Cup, and also set up Alan Shearer for the team&#x27;s third goal.

====Loan to Aston Villa====
A clause in Newcastle&#x27;s purchase of Nolberto Solano from Aston Villa resulted in Milner being loaned to Villa for the rest of the season. Villa manager David O&#x27;Leary, who had managed Milner at Leeds, was happy to acquire Milner in this deal, saying that he believed Villa got the better of the deal and that he hoped to improve Milner as a player. He made his Villa debut on 12 September 2005 in a Premier League match against West Ham United. Five days later, he scored his first goal for the club in a 1–1 draw against Tottenham Hotspur. In a League Cup match less than a week later, he helped his team recover from being 3–1 down at half-time to win 8–3 against Wycombe Wanderers, scoring two goals in the second-half comeback. Throughout the season, Milner was positive about his team. He remained confident that Villa would recover from a poor start to the season and praised the quality of the squad.

Milner was generally seen as a positive signing in a season that was disappointing for Villa. Milner himself also received the loan move positively, saying that he would like to join Villa permanently because of the probability of becoming a regular starter, but said that the possibility of this happening was beyond his control. Manager David O&#x27;Leary confirmed during the season that he would like Milner to join the club permanently, but doubted he would be given the opportunity to sign him. He even pulled out of signing Robert Huth so that he would have the funds to sign Milner permanently if the opportunity arose.

The newly appointed Newcastle manager Glenn Roeder appeared to appreciate Milner&#x27;s ability more than Souness and expressed a desire that he remain a Newcastle player. This, as well as the departure of O&#x27;Leary and the shortage of transfer funds at Villa, meant that a deal to sign Milner permanently seemed unlikely. In June, it became even less likely when Villa rejected an offer of Milner as part of a trade for Gareth Barry. However, the deal was resurrected when Villa were taken over by American billionaire Randy Lerner, and Martin O&#x27;Neill was appointed as new manager. A move to Villa appeared to have been agreed, but at the last moment Newcastle recalled Milner and the talks broke down.

====Return to Newcastle United====
Newcastle&#x27;s players and manager Glenn Roeder reacted positively to Milner&#x27;s return at the start of the 2006–07 season. Milner was a starter in the Newcastle team for the entire season.

Newcastle made a poor start in the 2006–07 Premier League, but in European competition, Milner played a key role in helping Newcastle reach the round of 16 of the UEFA Cup, playing all but one of the Magpies 12 games.&lt;ref name=&quot;2006/07&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Rumours began to spread that he would be sold during the transfer window in January, although both Milner and Roeder dismissed these rumours.

On 1 January 2007, Milner scored his first goal of the season in a 2–2 draw with Manchester United. The goal came from a &quot;stunning&quot; shot from away. He scored two more goals during the next three weeks, against Birmingham City and then against West Ham United. During the season, Milner displayed his ability to play comfortably in a range of different positions by scoring and setting up goals with both feet from both sides. As a result, Milner signed a new contract at Newcastle in January, which secured his future at the club until 2011. He signed another four-year contract in May 2007, when Sam Allardyce took over as manager of Newcastle. Milner said later in the year that he was happy about his future at the club and its new manager, saying that the training sessions were &quot;the best since I have been here&quot;. Allardyce said during the season that Milner was so keen to play, he was concerned Milner would &quot;burn out mentally [and] physically&quot;. As a result, Milner played mainly as a substitute in the early part of the season.

In late October, he scored Newcastle&#x27;s 500th home Premier League goal in a 3–1 win over Tottenham Hotspur. A second Premier League goal of the season came fortuitously in the Tyne–Wear derby from a shot intended as a cross. Allardyce praised Milner during the season, saying he was &quot;a hugely experienced Premier League player&quot;.

After missing the final nine matches of the season due to a foot injury, it was rumoured in May 2008 that Milner would be part of a transfer between Newcastle and Liverpool. Despite starting the season for Newcastle and scoring in a League Cup win over Coventry City, it was revealed after the match that Milner had handed in a written transfer request the week before.

===Return to Aston Villa===
Milner signed for Aston Villa on 29 August 2008 for a fee of £12 million, and signed a four-year contract with the club. Milner made his debut for Villa on 31 August 2008 as a second-half substitute against Liverpool. His first goals in his second spell at Villa came in a third round FA Cup tie against Gillingham at Priestfield Stadium on 4 January 2009 on his 23rd birthday, where he scored both goals in a 2–1 win for Villa.

Milner&#x27;s first Premier League goal in his second spell at Villa came on 17 January 2009 in a 2–1 win against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light. On 7 February 2009, Milner was named to the England senior team squad for the first time, after a run at club level that had impressed England manager Fabio Capello. Milner continued to impress and, on 7 February, scored his second league goal of the season against Blackburn Rovers. This was followed by a 25-yard free kick at home against Everton as Villa came back from a 3–1 deficit to draw 3–3 on 12 April. He stated that his time at Villa was the &quot;most settled&quot; period of his career so far, having played for thirteen managers and caretakers despite being only 23.

At the start of the 2009–10 season, Milner moved into the centre of midfield after the sale of captain Gareth Barry to Manchester City. His goal in a win against Sunderland in December 2009 was later voted as Aston Villa&#x27;s Goal of the Season. On 28 February 2010, he scored the opening goal in the 2010 League Cup final with a penalty. Villa were eventually beaten 2–1 by Manchester United. Milner ended the season with 12 goals and was named Aston Villa&#x27;s Supporters&#x27; Player of the Year and PFA Young Player of the Year.

On 19 May 2010, Manchester City made a £20 million offer for Milner which was rejected. On 22 July 2010, Villa manager Martin O&#x27;Neill said that Milner had shown a desire to leave Villa for City, but would only be sold at Villa&#x27;s valuation. On 14 August, despite being on the verge of a move to Manchester City, Milner played in Villa&#x27;s first match of the season against West Ham United, scoring Villa&#x27;s third goal. Milner was given a standing ovation when he was substituted near the end of the match.

===Manchester City===
On 17 August 2010, it was reported that Aston Villa had agreed a deal with Manchester City to sell Milner subject to a medical. The deal was reported to be worth around £26 million, including a player exchange of Stephen Ireland. Milner made his debut for City on 23 August 2010 in a 3–0 home win against Liverpool, where he set up the first goal for former Villa teammate Gareth Barry. Milner scored his first competitive goal for Manchester City in an FA Cup third-round match at Leicester City which ended in a 2–2 draw. The Leicester match was the start of a cup run that saw Manchester City reach the 2011 FA Cup final. Milner was an unused substitute as Manchester City beat Stoke City 1–0 to win the FA Cup.

Milner scored his first Premier League goal for Manchester City against Everton on 24 September 2011. Two matches later, he scored his second, against former club Aston Villa in a 4–1 win. The following week, Milner had a hand in two goals as Manchester City won the Manchester derby at Old Trafford 6–1, inflicting Manchester United&#x27;s heaviest home league defeat since 1930. Over the course of the 2011–12 season, Milner made 26 Premier League appearances as Manchester City won the league title for the first time in 44 years.

Milner won his first Community Shield in August 2012, as City beat Chelsea at Villa Park. On 6 October 2012, Milner scored his first goal of the 2012–13 season from a free kick to seal a 3–0 win against Sunderland. On 20 October, he received his first Premier League red card in a 2–1 win at West Bromwich Albion. On 13 January 2013, he scored City&#x27;s opening goal in a 2–0 away win at Arsenal, which was the first time a City player had scored away at Arsenal in the League since 2007, and City&#x27;s first win in the league at Arsenal since 1975. On 8 April, he scored in the Manchester derby as City beat Manchester United 2–1 at Old Trafford.

On 10 December 2013, Milner scored the winning goal in a 3–2 win against the reigning European champions Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena in the UEFA Champions League, becoming the first English player to score for Manchester City in the competition that season. That season would see Milner win a first League Cup winner&#x27;s medal and a second Premier League title.

===Liverpool===
====2015–2019: First seasons and Champions League title====
On 4 June 2015, Milner agreed to join Liverpool on a free transfer from Manchester City. On 7 August 2015, Milner was announced as the vice-captain. Milner played his first competitive match for the club in 1–0 win over Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium. Milner captained Liverpool for the first time on his third appearance for the club, a 0–0 draw at Arsenal. On 26 September 2015, he scored his debut goal for Liverpool in a 3–2 win against his former club Aston Villa at Anfield. He appeared in the 2016 UEFA Europa League final at the end of his first season with the club. Milner ended his first season with Liverpool scoring seven goals and recording 15 assists in all competitions.

On 19 March 2017, Milner scored in Liverpool&#x27;s 1–1 draw against former club Manchester City. In doing so, he broke a Premier League record by a player for the most matches scored in without losing (47 matches). In 2017–18 season, Milner assisted 9 goals in a single Champions League campaign, setting a new record previously held by Wayne Rooney in 2013-2014 and Neymar in 2016-2017.

In November 2018, Milner scored his 50th Premier League goal during a 1–1 draw at Arsenal. The following month, Milner became just the 13th player (and the 2nd youngest after former Aston Villa, Man City and England teammate Gareth Barry) in Premier League history to reach 500 appearances, during a 4–0 win at Bournemouth. On 1 June 2019, Milner won his first Champions League title, coming on as a substitute in the final against Tottenham, as Liverpool won 2–0 in the final.

====2019–2023: Premier League title and domestic success====
On 14 August 2019, Milner won his first UEFA Super Cup, starting the 2019 match against Chelsea, as Liverpool won after a penalty shoot-out in Istanbul. In December 2019, Milner signed a new contract reportedly keeping him at the club until 2022, although Liverpool did not specify the contract length. Later that month, Milner came on as a substitute as Liverpool won the FIFA Club World Cup for the first time in the club&#x27;s history, beating Flamengo 1–0 in the final. On 26 December 2019, Milner scored a penalty in a 4–0 Premier League victory over Leicester City at The King Power Stadium; it would be the last goal Milner ever scored for Liverpool. On 25 June 2020, Milner won his third Premier League title and his first for Liverpool.

Milner was not a regular starter during the 2020–21 season, amassing just 11 starts and making 26 appearances in all competitions. As a result, he registered the first goalless season of his career. He still remained an important player as Liverpool overcame multiple difficulties to finish third, qualifying for the following season&#x27;s Champions League on the final day of the season.

On 16 February 2022, Milner came on as a substitute in a 2–0 Champions League win against Inter Milan to make his 800th senior appearance at club level. On 27 February 2022, Milner scored Liverpool&#x27;s first penalty of the shoot-out in the 2022 EFL Cup final victory over Chelsea. On 14 May 2022, Milner once again scored Liverpool&#x27;s first penalty of the shoot-out in the 2022 FA Cup final victory over Chelsea. On 6 June 2022, Milner signed a one-year extension with the club.

On 5 October 2022, Milner made his 300th appearance for Liverpool in a 2–0 victory against Rangers in the 2022–23 Champions League. On 12 November, Milner came on as a substitute against Southampton to make his 600th Premier League appearance. On 4 April 2023, in a 0–0 draw against Chelsea, Milner marked his 610th Premier League appearance, which moved him up to third place in all-time Premier League&#x27;s appearance charts. In May 2023, Liverpool announced that Milner would leave the club at the end of the 2022–23 season upon the expiry of his contract.

===Brighton &amp; Hove Albion===
On 14 June 2023, Premier League club Brighton &amp; Hove Albion announced that Milner would join the club upon the expiry of his Liverpool contract at the end of the month. He agreed a one-year contract with the option to extend for another year. He made his Brighton debut on 12 August, in the club&#x27;s opening game of the 2023–24 season, starting and playing 79 minutes of the match in the 4–1 home win over Premier League newcomers Luton Town. On 16 September, he played in a 3–1 away win over Manchester United, to become the first player to win at Old Trafford with four different clubs, in addition to achieving a record of 11 victories in total including 6 away wins against the same opponent. On 22 January 2024, Milner played his 633rd Premier League match in a home goalless draw against Wolverhampton, moving ahead of Ryan Giggs to be second in all-time appearances, only behind Gareth Barry with 653.

On 15 May 2024, Milner signed a new one-year deal with Brighton. He featured in the 2024–25 season opening match on 17 August, which ended in an 3–0 away win against Everton, becoming the first player to play 23 Premier League seasons. Later that month, on 31 August, he suffered a hamstring injury in a 1–1 away draw against Arsenal, which sidelined him for the rest of 2024.

==International career==
===Youth===
After representing England at the under-15 and under-17 levels, Milner was promoted to the under-20 level and called up for the 2003 World Youth Championship, but was recalled by Leeds United four days before the opening game. Soon after this, under-21 manager Peter Taylor called him up to the England under-21 team and Milner made his debut against Sweden on 30 March 2004.

Milner scored for the England under-21 team during the 2004–05 season in a qualification match for the 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, against Wales. During the match, in which he played in the centre of midfield, he set up a scoring chance for Darren Bent as the Young Lions won 2–0. Despite domestic club troubles, he continued to make progress at international level, scoring the winning goal for the England under-21 team in a 3–2 win over Switzerland. The win secured England a place in the playoff stage of the 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualifiers.

In June, Milner competed for England at the 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Championship. He played in all four of England&#x27;s matches and was booked in the semi-final against the Netherlands, which meant he would have missed the final. The match was decided by a penalty shoot-out, in which Milner scored twice and England lost 13–12. Milner was included in the under-21 squad for a friendly against Romania, which ended in a 1–1 draw. A month later, Milner set an England under-21 record by making his 30th appearance for the team in a 3–0 win against Montenegro. Historically, players with several England Under-21 appearances have not progressed to become regulars in the senior team, which has led some to doubt whether Milner would be able to successfully make the transition. In October, he scored his third goal for the under-21 team in a 3–0 win over Republic of Ireland. He scored again in the return match four months later that England also won 3–0.

Milner continued to be a regular and was the only player, along with Joe Hart and captain Steven Taylor, to have played in all the qualifiers for the 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Championship. In the summer of 2009, he was in the squad for the 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Championship in Sweden. He helped set up the winning goal for Micah Richards against Finland, and manager Stuart Pearce said after the match, &quot;The modern-day full-back can get up and down the pitch and I knew [Milner] would be comfortable&quot;. In England&#x27;s second match against Spain, Milner had a penalty saved by Sergio Asenjo, and scored England&#x27;s second goal in a 2–0 win. England faced the hosts Sweden in the semi-finals. After the match ended in a 3–3 draw, it went to a penalty shoot-out. Milner was the only England player to miss in the shoot-out after he slipped just before kicking the ball, causing it to go over the crossbar. England won the shoot-out 5–4 to advance to the final for the first time in 25 years. England lost the final to Germany 4–0 and Milner said after the match that the team was &quot;hurting&quot; and that the way in which the team lost was &quot;not good enough&quot;. The final was his last match for the under-21 team. His 46 appearances at under-21 level are a national record.

===Senior===
In August 2009, Milner made his debut for the England senior team, when he came on as a substitute in a friendly match against the Netherlands for the final 23 minutes. The match ended in a 2–2 draw. He played again for England the following month against Slovenia in another friendly and made his competitive debut four days later in a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Croatia, where he played the final nine minutes. England won the latter match 5–1 to secure qualification for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. He was named in the squad for the World Cup finals in South Africa and was selected in the starting lineup for England&#x27;s first match of the tournament against the United States, although he was substituted after 30 minutes. In England&#x27;s third match against Slovenia, he set up the only goal of the match with a cross for Jermain Defoe. He captained England for the first time for the final 10 minutes of the match in a 2–1 loss against France on 17 November 2010, when both Rio Ferdinand and Steven Gerrard had been substituted.

Milner played in six matches during qualifying for UEFA Euro 2012, and was named in Roy Hodgson&#x27;s 23-man squad for the tournament. Milner started Hodgson&#x27;s first match in charge, a 1–0 friendly win against Norway.
He started all of England&#x27;s group stage games as the Three Lions finished top of group D and qualified for the quarter-finals. He started but was taken off after an hour as England were eliminated by Italy in a penalty shoot-out.

On 7 September 2012, Milner scored his first and only international goal in a 5–0 win away to Moldova during 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying. Milner was included in Hodgson&#x27;s squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. However, Milner failed to secure a regular starting place, coming on as a substitute in the final group game against Costa Rica after England had already been eliminated, with the game ending in a 0–0 draw. Milner was part of the England squad for Euro 2016, but once again was unable to secure regular playing time. Milner played just five minutes in the group stage, coming on as a late substitute against Russia, and did not play in England&#x27;s loss to Iceland in the round of 16.

On 5 August 2016, Milner announced his retirement from international duty following discussions with new England manager Sam Allardyce. The England manager Gareth Southgate enquired Milner&#x27;s availability at the 2018 World Cup, but Milner declined to return to international action.

==Style of play==
Milner is renowned for his versatility; across his career, Milner has played as a winger, central midfielder, defensive midfielder, attacking midfielder, and full back, with Milner&#x27;s preferred position being as a central midfielder. During his time at Leeds United and Newcastle United, Milner predominantly played as a winger. He has been described as &quot;comfortable on either wing&quot;. He moved into central midfield during his time at Aston Villa. Under Jürgen Klopp, Milner spent all of the 2016–17 season playing at left back for Liverpool. Milner stated he did not enjoy playing as a left back but also said: &quot;It&#x27;s about whatever&#x27;s best for the team and ultimately I just want to be out there playing games, contributing and helping this football club.&quot; He also played in a holding role and in a box-to-box role on occasion for Liverpool in later seasons, drawing praise in the media for his dynamism, energy, work-rate, and consistent performances.

Milner is regarded as being a tenacious footballer. Manuel Pellegrini, who managed Milner at Manchester City, described him as the most complete English player in the modern game, praising his all round ability, commitment, performance level and versatility. Milner is often considered to be one of the most underrated players of his generation, with &quot;The Telegraph&quot; including him at number seven in their list of &quot;The top 20 most under-rated footballers of all time&quot; in 2015, describing him as &quot;hard working, reliable and intelligent.&quot;

Milner has the ability to pass accurately and shoot from a great distance from goal. As a result, he usually goes forward for set pieces and is often a candidate to take corners and free kicks. While Milner does not score many goals, he does have a good record at providing assists - as of August 2024 he is 9th on the all-time Premier League assist chart. Critical opinion is divided as to Milner&#x27;s crossing ability. While some commentators have been critical of his ability in this area, other journalists have said that Milner can produce accurate crosses.

Milner, in his time at the club, was described on the Newcastle United official website as &quot;a good reader of the game&quot;. This awareness allows him to pass the ball from a range of positions to teammates making forward runs, as well as giving him the confidence to take on defenders.

==Personal life==
Milner is married to Amy Fletcher. The couple have two children: a daughter and a son. Milner learnt to speak Spanish to better communicate with his teammates, and speaks to his children only in Spanish to ensure they too learn the language.

Milner set up the James Milner Foundation, which holds a themed annual ball to raise money for various charitable causes. He is teetotal.

Milner was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2022 Birthday Honours for services to association football and charity.

<text>Lust for Life is a 1956 American biographical film about the life of the Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh, based on the 1934 novel of the same title by Irving Stone which was adapted for the screen by Norman Corwin.

It was directed by Vincente Minnelli and produced by John Houseman. The film stars Kirk Douglas as Van Gogh, James Donald as his brother Theo, with Pamela Brown, Everett Sloane, and Anthony Quinn. Douglas won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama and the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor for his performance, while Quinn won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

== Plot ==
Vincent has trained to be a minister, like his father, but the church authorities find him unsuitable. He pleads with them to be allowed some position and they place him in a very poor mining community. Here he becomes deeply absorbed in the miners&#x27; plight and begins sketching their daily life.

The religious leaders do not like his approach, and they frown on his social activism and care for the poor. He returns home to his father&#x27;s house. Here a woman he obsessively loves (his cousin) rejects Van Gogh because of his inability to support himself financially. The infatuated Vincent follows her to her family home, where he holds his hand over a candle flame to prove his devotion, only to learn that she has said she is disgusted by him and doesn&#x27;t want to see him again.

He takes to drawing. His cousin Anton Mauve gives him paint and art materials and encourages him to paint. His brother, Theo van Gogh, provides financial and moral support. Vincent takes up with a prostitute who eventually also leaves because he is too poor. His passion then turns fully to painting, which he pursues while agonizing that he is unable to paint precisely what he sees.

After his father&#x27;s death, he goes to Paris with Theo, where he discovers the impressionists. Theo cannot bear living with him and Vincent leaves for sunny Arles, France. Paul Gauguin (whom he met in Paris) joins him there, and for a while life is good. However, Vincent is too obsessive even for Gauguin&#x27;s tastes and they argue, prompting the latter&#x27;s departure, after which Vincent cuts off his own ear. Vincent begins experiencing seizures and voluntarily commits himself to a mental institution, where he is allowed to paint. He signs himself out, and with Theo&#x27;s help returns to a rural area to resume painting. While painting cornfields, he is frustrated by the crows and, despairing at never being able to put what he sees on canvas, pulls out a revolver and shoots himself. He dies in bed a few days later.

== Production ==
The film was based on the 1934 novel by Irving Stone and adapted by Norman Corwin. Vincente Minnelli directed the film, while John Houseman produced it. They worked with Douglas on the 1952 melodrama &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot;, for which he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor. In 1954, Douglas secured the filming rights to Van Gogh&#x27;s biography and intended to star and produce it through his own film production company, Bryna Productions, with Jean Negulesco directing and financial distribution backing from United Artists.

Principal photography started in August and ended in December 1955 and it was shot on location in France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Two hundred enlarged colour photos were used representing Vincent’s completed canvases; these were in addition to copies that were executed by an American art teacher, Robert Parker. To prepare for his role as the troubled painter, Douglas practiced painting crows so that he could reasonably imitate van Gogh at work. According to his wife Anne, Douglas would return home from work still in character. When asked if he would do such a thing again, Douglas responded that he would not.

== Reception ==
=== Critical reaction ===
&quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Bosley Crowther praised the film&#x27;s conception, acting and color scheme, noting the design team &quot;consciously made the flow of color and the interplay of compositions and hues the most forceful devices for conveying a motion picture comprehension of van Gogh.&quot; Whitney Williams of &quot;Variety&quot; said, &quot;This is a slow-moving picture whose only action is in the dialog itself. Basically a faithful portrait of Van Gogh, &quot;Lust for Life&quot; is nonetheless unexciting. It misses out in conveying the color and entertainment of the original Irving Stone novel.&quot;

&quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; wrote that the film had been given &quot;an excellent production&quot; and that &quot;Kirk Douglas does outstanding work as Van Gogh, and Anthony Quinn is very good as Paul Gauguin, his friend.&quot; John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote, &quot;Even if the movie doesn&#x27;t delve as deeply as it might into the mental processes that made van Gogh behave the way he did, it nevertheless, in the person of Kirk Douglas, confronts us with a character well worth our absorbed attention. Mr. Douglas, who, wearing red whiskers, bears a striking resemblance to van Gogh&#x27;s self-portraits, succeeds most skillfully in arousing a conviction that he is, in truth, a painter beside himself to capture light and hold it forever on canvas.&quot;

Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the film &quot;a remarkable achievement, combining a rich adventure in the art of color with a perceptive study of a creative personality. In this biography of Vincent Van Gogh, Kirk Douglas adds to his advantage of striking resemblance a performance of powerful sensitivity.&quot; Edwin Schallert of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the film a &quot;remarkable and poignant study,&quot; and forecast that the artist&#x27;s &#x27;stellar portrayal&#x27; by Kirk Douglas &quot;will be recognized for Academy honors.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; printed a somewhat negative review, writing: &quot;Although one feels that those responsible were determined to &#x27;do right&#x27; by Van Gogh, this biographical tribute never rises above the level of the popular novel on which it is based ... Despite a remarkable physical resemblance, Kirk Douglas&#x27; performance remains essentially an American study in neuroticism; also, the presentation of the aesthetic controversy between Van Gogh (humane and intuitive) and Gauguin (intellectual and brusquely cynical) is both oversimplified and somewhat misleading.&quot;

=== Box office ===
The world premiere was held at the Caley Picture House as part of the Edinburgh Film Festival on 19 August 1956. It subsequently opened on 17 September 17 at the Plaza Theatre on East 58th Street in New York City as a benefit for the Metropolitan Museum of Art&#x27;s student program. It played there for a record 37 weeks, grossing $450,000.

Despite its accolades, the movie was a financial failure. According to MGM records, the film earned rentals of $1,595,000 in the US and Canada and $1,100,000 elsewhere, resulting in a loss of $2,072,000.

=== Accolades ===
== Companion short film ==
MGM produced a short film, &quot;Van Gogh: Darkness Into Light&quot;, narrated by Dore Schary and showing the European locations used for the filming, to promote &quot;Lust for Life&quot;. In the film, a 75-year-old woman from Auvers-sur-Oise (not Jeanne Calment, who lived in Arles several hundred kilometers to the south), who claims to have known Van Gogh when she was a young girl, meets star Kirk Douglas, and comments on how much he looks like the painter. This short promotional film is shown on Turner Classic Movies occasionally. At the start and ending of the film, the creators thank a number of galleries, collectors and historians who allowed the works of Van Gogh to be photographed for the film.

<text>Phocylides (), Greek gnomic poet of Miletus, contemporary of Theognis of Megara, was born about 560 BC.

A few fragments of his &quot;maxims&quot; have survived (chiefly in the &quot;Florilegium&quot; of Stobaeus), in which he expresses his contempt for the pomps and vanities of rank and wealth, and sets forth in simple language his ideas of honour, justice and wisdom. An example is an epigram quoted by Dio Chrysostom:

Aristotle also found cause to quote him:

==Works==
Phocylides of Miletus was once credited with writing Pseudo-Phocylides, a complete didactic poem (230 hexameters). However, that text is now considered to be the work of an Alexandrian Christian of Jewish origin who lived between 170 BC and AD 50. The Jewish element is shown in verbal agreement with passages of the Old Testament (especially the Wisdom of Sirach); the Christian by the doctrine of the immortality of the soul and the resurrection of the body. Some Jewish authorities, however, maintain that there are in reality no traces of Christian doctrine to be found in the poem, and that the author was a Jew. The poem was first printed at Venice in 1495, and was a favourite school textbook during the Reformation period.

<text>Rock Hudson (born Roy Harold Scherer Jr.; November 17, 1925 – October 2, 1985) was an American actor. One of the most popular movie stars of his time, he had a screen career spanning more than three decades. He was a prominent figure in the Golden Age of Hollywood.

He achieved stardom with his role in &quot;Magnificent Obsession&quot; (1954), followed by &quot;All That Heaven Allows&quot; (1955), and &quot;Giant&quot; (1956), for which he received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. Hudson also found continued success with a string of romantic comedies co-starring Doris Day: &quot;Pillow Talk&quot; (1959), &quot;Lover Come Back&quot; (1961), and &quot;Send Me No Flowers&quot; (1964). During the late 1960s, his films included &quot;Seconds&quot; (1966), &quot;Tobruk&quot; (1967), and &quot;Ice Station Zebra&quot; (1968). Unhappy with the film scripts he was offered, Hudson formed his own film production companies, first 7 Pictures Corporation, then later Gibraltar Pictures, to have more control over his roles; later he turned to television, starring in the mystery series &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot; (1971–1977). His last role was as a guest star on the fifth season (1984–1985) of the primetime ABC soap opera &quot;Dynasty,&quot; until an AIDS-related illness made it impossible for him to continue.

Although he was discreet regarding his sexual orientation, it was known among Hudson&#x27;s colleagues in the film industry that he was gay. In 1984, Hudson was diagnosed with AIDS. The following year, he became one of the first celebrities to disclose his AIDS diagnosis. Hudson was the first major American celebrity to die from an AIDS-related illness, on October 2, 1985, at age 59.

==Early life==
Hudson was born Roy Harold Scherer Jr. on November 17, 1925, in Winnetka, Illinois, the only child of Katherine (née Wood), a homemaker and later telephone operator, and Roy Harold Scherer Sr., an auto mechanic. His father was of German and Swiss descent, while his mother had English and Irish ancestry. He was raised as a Roman Catholic. During the Great Depression, Hudson&#x27;s father lost his job and abandoned the family. Hudson&#x27;s parents divorced when he was four years old; a few years later, in 1932, his mother married Wallace Fitzgerald, a former Marine Corps officer whom young Roy despised. Roy was adopted by Fitzgerald without his consent, and his legal name then became Roy Harold Fitzgerald. The marriage eventually ended in a bitter divorce and produced no children.

Hudson attended New Trier High School in Winnetka, the same high school as fellow movie stars Charlton Heston and Ann-Margret. At some point during his teenage years, he worked as an usher in a movie theater and developed an interest in acting. He tried out for a number of school plays, but failed to win any roles because he could not remember his lines, a problem that continued to occur through his early acting career.

== Career ==

=== 1943–1948: Military service to acting debut ===
He graduated from high school in 1943, and the following year enlisted in the United States Navy during World War II. After training at the Great Lakes Naval Training Station, he departed San Francisco aboard the troop transport SS &quot;Lew Wallace&quot; with orders to report to Aviation Repair and Overhaul Unit 2, then located on Samar, Philippines, as an aircraft mechanic. In 1946, he returned to San Francisco aboard an aircraft carrier, and was discharged the same year.

Hudson then moved to Los Angeles to live with his biological father (who had remarried) and to pursue an acting career. Initially he worked at odd jobs, including as a truck driver. He applied to the University of Southern California&#x27;s dramatics program, but was rejected because of poor grades. After he sent talent scout Henry Willson a picture of himself in 1947, Willson took him on as a client and changed the young actor&#x27;s name to Rock Hudson; later in life, Hudson admitted that he hated the name. The name was coined by combining the Rock of Gibraltar and the Hudson River. Hudson later named his independent film production company Gibraltar Productions.

In 1948, Hudson made his acting debut with a small part in the Warner Bros. film &quot;Fighter Squadron&quot; directed by Raoul Walsh; according to a 21st-century source, it took 38 takes for Hudson to successfully deliver his only line in the film.

===Universal-International===
Hudson was signed to a long-term contract by Universal-International. There he received coaching in acting, singing, dancing, fencing and horseback riding, and began to be featured in film magazines where, being photogenic, he was promoted.

In 1949, Hudson received his first film credit, as Roc Hudson, in William Castle&#x27;s &quot;Undertow&quot;, made by Universal.

In 1950, he acted in &quot;One Way Street&quot;, &quot;Shakedown&quot;, &quot;I Was a Shoplifter&quot;, &quot;Peggy&quot;, &quot;Winchester &#x27;73&quot;, and &quot;The Desert Hawk.&quot;

In 1951, Hudson was billed third in William Castle&#x27;s &quot;The Fat Man.&quot; He played an important role as a boxer in Joseph Pevney&#x27;s &quot;Iron Man&quot;. Other acting credit in that period include &quot;Bright Victory,&quot; &quot;Tomahawk&quot;, and &quot;Air Cadet&quot;.

===Leading man===
Hudson was promoted to leading man for &quot;Scarlet Angel&quot; (1952), opposite Yvonne De Carlo. He co-starred with Piper Laurie in &quot;Has Anybody Seen My Gal?&quot; (1952), the first of his films directed by Douglas Sirk. He also appeared as a gambler in &quot;Bend of the River&quot; (1952). He supported the Nelson family in &quot;Here Come the Nelsons&quot; (1952).

In &quot;Horizons West&quot; (1952) Hudson supported Robert Ryan, but he was star again for &quot;The Lawless Breed&quot; (1953) and &quot;Seminole&quot; (1953). In 1953, he appeared in a Camel commercial that showed him on the set of &quot;Seminole&quot;.

He and De Carlo were borrowed by RKO for &quot;Sea Devils&quot; (1953), an adventure set during the Napoleonic Wars. Back at Universal he played Harun al-Rashid in &quot;The Golden Blade&quot; (1953). There was &quot;Gun Fury&quot; (1953) and &quot;Back to God&#x27;s Country&quot; (1953). Hudson had the title role in &quot;Taza, Son of Cochise&quot; (1954), directed by Sirk and produced by Ross Hunter.

===&quot;Magnificent Obsession&quot; and stardom===
Hudson was by now firmly established as a leading man in adventure films. What turned him into a star was the romantic drama &quot;Magnificent Obsession&quot; (1954), co-starring Jane Wyman, produced by Hunter and directed by Sirk. The film received positive reviews, with &quot;Modern Screen Magazine&quot; citing Hudson as the most popular actor of the year. It made over $5 million at the box office.

Hudson returned to adventure films with &quot;Bengal Brigade&quot; (1954), set during the Indian Mutiny, and &quot;Captain Lightfoot&quot; (1955), produced by Hunter and directed by Sirk. In 1954, exhibitors voted Hudson the 17th most popular star in the country.

Hunter used him in the melodramas &quot;One Desire&quot; (1955) and &quot;All That Heaven Allows&quot; (1955), which reunited him with Sirk and Wyman. He next acted in &quot;Never Say Goodbye&quot; (1956).

===&quot;Giant&quot; (1956)===
Hudson&#x27;s popularity soared with George Stevens&#x27; film &quot;Giant&quot; (1956). Hudson and his co-star James Dean were nominated for Oscars in the Best Actor category. In March 1956, Hudson formed his first film production company, 7 Pictures Corporation, with partners producer Henry Ginsberg, his agent Henry Willson and his lawyer Greg Bautzer. Though Hudson&#x27;s exclusive contract with Universal-International Pictures allowed him to produce films outside his obligation to the studio, he was not allowed to appear in them unless he was granted permission for each film.

Another hit was &quot;Written on the Wind&quot; (1957), directed by Sirk and produced by Albert Zugsmith. Sirk also directed Hudson in &quot;Battle Hymn&quot; (1957), produced by Hudson, playing Dean Hess. These films propelled Hudson to be voted the most popular actor in American cinemas in 1957. He stayed in the &quot;top ten&quot; until 1964.

Hudson was borrowed by MGM to appear in Richard Brooks&#x27; &quot;Something of Value&quot; (1957), a box-office disappointment. So too was his next film, a remake of &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; (1957). To make &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;, he reportedly turned down Marlon Brando&#x27;s role in &quot;Sayonara&quot;, William Holden&#x27;s role in &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;, and Charlton Heston&#x27;s role in &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;. &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; received negative reviews, failed at the box office and became the last production by David O. Selznick. Hudson was reunited with the producer, director and two stars of &quot;Written on the Wind&quot; in &quot;The Tarnished Angels&quot; (1958), at Universal. He then made &quot;Twilight for the Gods&quot; (1958) and &quot;This Earth Is Mine&quot; (1959).

===Romantic comedy star===

Ross Hunter teamed Hudson with Doris Day in the romantic comedy &quot;Pillow Talk&quot; (1959), which was a massive hit. Hudson was voted the most popular star in the country for 1959 and was the second most popular for the next three years. 

Hudson told the press that he wanted to co-star in &quot;Let&#x27;s Make Love&quot; with Marilyn Monroe but Universal-International Pictures denied him permission; the role went to Yves Montand. In late 1959, Hudson a new film production company, Gibraltar Productions. Now that his contract with Universal-International Pictures was about to end, he used his company to lease his acting services to Universal-International Pictures (and others), retain a percentage of his film&#x27;s profits, and have the freedom to pick his own roles. The 7 Pictures Corporation was only briefly used because its assets were co-owned with Hudson&#x27;s ex-wife Phillis Gates; after the divorce, Hudson only produced through Gibraltar Productions, but Gates sued for a share in that company, too. Hudson later sold his assets of 7 Pictures Corporation to MCA, in exchange for stock in MCA/Universal-International Pictures. 

After &quot;The Last Sunset&quot; (1961), co-starring Kirk Douglas and produced for Douglas&#x27; company Bryna Productions, Hudson made two comedies: &quot;Come September&quot; (1961) with Gina Lollobrigida, Sandra Dee and Bobby Darin, directed by Robert Mulligan; and &quot;Lover Come Back&quot; (1961) with Day; both films were produced through his 7 Pictures Corporation.

He made two dramas: &quot;The Spiral Road&quot; (1962), directed by Mulligan, and &quot;A Gathering of Eagles&quot; (1963), directed by Delbert Mann. Hudson was still voted the third most popular star in 1963. Hudson went back to comedy for &quot;Man&#x27;s Favorite Sport?&quot; (1964), directed by Howard Hawks and co-produced through Gibraltar Productions, and &quot;Send Me No Flowers&quot; (1964), his third and final film with Day. Along with Cary Grant, Hudson was regarded as one of the best-dressed male stars in Hollywood and received Top 10 Stars of the Year a record-setting eight times from 1957 to 1964.

===Decline as a star===

&quot;Strange Bedfellows&quot; (1965), with Gina Lollobrigida, was a box-office disappointment. So too was &quot;A Very Special Favor&quot; (1965), despite having the same writer and director as &quot;Pillow Talk&quot;.

Hudson next appeared in &quot;Blindfold&quot; (1966). Then, working outside his usual range, he starred in the science-fiction thriller &quot;Seconds&quot; (1966), directed by John Frankenheimer and co-produced through his own film production company Gibraltar Productions.

He also tried his hand in the action genre with &quot;Tobruk&quot; (1967), directed by Arthur Hiller. After the comedy &quot;A Fine Pair&quot; (1968) with Claudia Cardinale, he starred in the action thriller &quot;Ice Station Zebra&quot; (1968) at MGM, a role which remained his personal favorite. The film was a hit but struggled to recoup its large cost.

In November 1969, Andrew V. McLaglen&#x27;s &quot;The Undefeated&quot;, a western with Hudson starring opposite John Wayne, was released.

He co-starred as a World War I flier opposite Julie Andrews in the Blake Edwards musical &quot;Darling Lili&quot; (1970), a film notorious for its bloated budget.

===Television===
During the 1970s and 1980s, he starred in a number of TV movies and series. His most successful television series was &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot; opposite Susan Saint James, which ran from 1971 to 1977. Hudson played police commissioner Stewart &quot;Mac&quot; McMillan, with Saint James as his wife Sally, and their on-screen chemistry helped make the show a hit.

During the series, Rock Hudson appeared in &quot;Showdown&quot; (1973), a western with Dean Martin, and &quot;Embryo&quot; (1976), a science-fiction film. Hudson took a risk and surprised many by making a successful foray into live theater late in his career, and the best received of his efforts was &quot;I Do! I Do!&quot; in 1974.

After &quot;McMillan&quot; ended, Hudson made the disaster movie &quot;Avalanche&quot; (1978) and the miniseries &quot;Wheels&quot; (1978) and &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; (1980). He was one of several stars in &quot;The Mirror Crack&#x27;d&quot; (reuniting him with &quot;Giant&quot; co-star Elizabeth Taylor) (1980) and co-starred in &quot;The Beatrice Arthur Special&quot; (1980).

===Later years===

In the early 1980s, following years of heavy drinking and smoking, Hudson began having health problems which resulted in a heart attack in November 1981. Emergency quintuple heart bypass surgery sidelined Hudson and his new TV show &quot;The Devlin Connection&quot; for a year, and the show was canceled in December 1982 soon after it aired. His health problems forced him to turn down the role of Col. Sam Trautman in &quot;First Blood&quot;. Hudson was the first to narrate for Disney&#x27;s Candlelight Processional at Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World for its opening year in 1971. His final appearance as narrator was in 1984.

Hudson recovered from the heart surgery but did not quit smoking. He continued to work, appearing in several TV movies such as &quot;World War III&quot; (1982). He was in ill health while filming the action-drama &quot;The Ambassador&quot; in Israel during the winter months from late 1983 to early 1984. He reportedly did not get along with his co-star Robert Mitchum, who had a serious drinking problem and often clashed off-camera with Hudson and other cast and crew members.

From December 1984 to April 1985, Hudson appeared in a recurring role on the prime time soap opera &quot;Dynasty&quot; as Daniel Reece, a wealthy horse breeder and a potential love interest for Krystle Carrington (played by Linda Evans), and biological father of the character Sammy Jo Carrington (Heather Locklear). While Hudson had long been known to have difficulty memorizing lines, resulting in his use of cue cards, his speech began to visibly deteriorate on &quot;Dynasty.&quot; He was slated to appear for the duration of the second half of its fifth season; however because of his progressing ill health, his character was abruptly written out of the show and died off-screen.

==Personal life==
While his career developed, Hudson and his agent, Henry Willson, kept the actor&#x27;s personal life hidden from the public. In 1955, &quot;Confidential&quot; magazine threatened to publish an exposé about Hudson&#x27;s secret homosexuality. Willson stalled this by disclosing information about two of his other clients. Willson provided information about Rory Calhoun&#x27;s years in prison and the arrest of Tab Hunter at a party in 1950. According to some colleagues, Hudson&#x27;s homosexual activity was well known in Hollywood throughout his career, and former co-stars Julie Andrews, Mia Farrow, Elizabeth Taylor and Susan Saint James claimed that they knew of his homosexuality and kept Hudson&#x27;s secret for him, as did friends Audrey Hepburn and Carol Burnett.

Soon after the threat from &quot;Confidential&quot;, Hudson married Willson&#x27;s secretary Phyllis Gates. Gates later wrote that she dated Hudson for several months, lived with him for two months before his surprise marriage proposal, and married Hudson out of love and not (as it was reported later) to prevent an exposé of Hudson&#x27;s sexual past. Press coverage of the wedding quoted Hudson as saying: &quot;When I count my blessings, my marriage tops the list.&quot; Gates filed for divorce after three years in April 1958, citing mental cruelty (a standard practice at the time to bypass the mandatory wait for divorces to be approved). Hudson did not contest the divorce and Gates received alimony of $250 per week for 10 years. She also owned assets in Hudson&#x27;s independent film production company, 7 Pictures Corporation, which was formed during their marriage, and later sued the actor to obtain shares in his new film production company, Gibraltar Productions, which he had formed after their divorce. She never remarried.

According to the biography &quot;Rock Hudson: His Story&quot; (1986) by Gates and Sara Davidson, Hudson was good friends with novelist Armistead Maupin, who states that the two had a brief fling. The book also names some of Hudson&#x27;s lovers, including Jack Coates, Tom Clark (who published the memoir &quot;Rock Hudson: Friend of Mine&quot;), actor and stockbroker Lee Garlington, and Marc Christian (born Marc Christian MacGinnis), who later won a suit against the Hudson estate.

In 2005, Bob Hofler published a biography of Hudson&#x27;s agent Henry Willson, titled &quot;The Man Who Invented Rock Hudson&quot;. He told &quot;The Village Voice&quot; that Phyllis Gates attempted to blackmail Hudson about his homosexual activities. The LGBTQ news magazine &quot;The Advocate&quot; published an article by Hofler, who claimed that Gates was actually a lesbian who believed from the beginning of their relationship that Hudson was gay.

An urban legend has it that Hudson &quot;married&quot; Jim Nabors in the early 1970s. Not only was same-sex marriage not legalized by any American state at the time, but, at least publicly, Hudson and Nabors were nothing more than friends.

The joke was in the mainstream by this time. In the October 1972 edition of &quot;MAD&quot; magazine (issue no. 154), an article titled &quot;When Watching Television, You Can be Sure of Seeing...,&quot; gossip columnist &#x27;Rona Boring&#x27; states: &quot;And there isn&#x27;t a grain of truth to the vicious rumor that movie and TV star Rock Heman and singer Jim Nelly were secretly married! Rock and Jim are just good buddies! I repeat, they are not married! They are not even going steady!&quot; Over the years, the rumor persisted and continued to spread. As a result, Hudson and Nabors never spoke to each other again.

Although he was raised Roman Catholic, Hudson later identified as an atheist. A week before Hudson died, his publicist Tom Clark asked a priest to visit. Hudson made a deathbed confession, received communion, and was administered the last rites. Hudson also was visited by Shirley and Pat Boone.

Politically, Hudson was a conservative Republican; he campaigned and voted for Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election.

==Illness and death==
Unknown to the public, Hudson was diagnosed with AIDS on June 5, 1984, three years after the emergence of the first cluster of symptomatic patients in the United States, and one year after the initial conclusion by scientists that HIV causes AIDS. Over the next several months, Hudson kept his illness a secret and continued to work while at the same time traveling to France and other countries seeking a cure, or at least treatment to slow the progression of the disease.

On July 16, 1985, Hudson joined his old friend Doris Day for a Hollywood press conference, announcing the launch of her new cable TV show &quot;Doris Day&#x27;s Best Friends&quot;, in which Hudson was videotaped visiting Day&#x27;s ranch in Carmel, California, a few days earlier. He appeared gaunt and pale and spoke very little during the segment, most of which consisted of Day and Hudson walking around while Day&#x27;s recording of &quot;My Buddy&quot; played in the background, Hudson saying he tired quickly. His emaciated appearance was such a shock that the reunion was broadcast repeatedly over national news shows that night and for days to come, with media outlets speculating on Hudson&#x27;s health. Day later acknowledged: &quot;He was very sick. But I just brushed that off and I came out and put my arms around him and said &#x27;Am I glad to see you.

Two days later, Hudson traveled to Paris, France, for another round of treatment. After Hudson collapsed in his room at the Ritz Hotel in Paris on July 21, his publicist Dale Olson released a statement claiming that Hudson had inoperable liver cancer. Olson denied reports that Hudson had AIDS and said only that he was undergoing tests for &quot;everything&quot; at the American Hospital of Paris. Four days later, on July 25, 1985, Hudson&#x27;s French publicist Yanou Collart confirmed that Hudson did, in fact, have AIDS. He was among the earliest mainstream celebrities to have been diagnosed with the disease.

Hudson flew back to Los Angeles on July 30. He was so weak that he was moved by stretcher from the Air France Boeing 747 he had chartered; he and his medical attendants were the only passengers. He was flown by helicopter to UCLA Medical Center, where he spent nearly a month undergoing further treatment. He was released from the hospital in late August 1985 and returned to his home in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles for private hospice care.

At around 9 a.m. on October 2, 1985, Hudson died in his sleep from AIDS-related complications at his home in Beverly Hills at the age of 59. Hudson requested that no funeral be held. His body was cremated hours after his death and a cenotaph later was established at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Cathedral City, California. His ashes were scattered in the channel between Wilmington, Los Angeles and Santa Catalina Island.

The disclosure of Hudson&#x27;s AIDS diagnosis provoked widespread public discussion of his homosexuality. In &quot;Logical Family: A Memoir&quot; (2017), gay author Armistead Maupin, who was a friend of Hudson, writes that he was the first person to confirm to the press that Hudson was gay in 1985. Maupin explains that he confirmed it to Randy Shilts of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; and that he was annoyed that producer Ross Hunter, also gay, denied it. In its August 15, 1985, issue, &quot;People&quot; magazine published a story that discussed his disease in the context of his sexuality. The largely sympathetic article featured comments from show business colleagues, such as Angie Dickinson, Robert Stack, and Mamie Van Doren, who claimed they knew about Hudson&#x27;s homosexuality and expressed their support for him. At that time, &quot;People&quot; had a circulation of more than 2.8 million; as a result of this and other stories, Hudson&#x27;s homosexuality became public. Hudson&#x27;s revelation had an immediate impact on the visibility of AIDS and on the funding of medical research related to the disease.

Shortly after Hudson&#x27;s press release disclosing his infection, William M. Hoffman, the author of &quot;As Is&quot;, a play about AIDS that appeared on Broadway in 1985, stated: &quot;If Rock Hudson can have it, nice people can have it. It&#x27;s just a disease, not a moral affliction.&quot; At the same time, Joan Rivers was quoted as saying: &quot;Two years ago, when I hosted a benefit for AIDS, I couldn&#x27;t get one major star to turn out. Rock&#x27;s admission is a horrendous way to bring AIDS to the attention of the American public, but by doing so, Rock, in his life, has helped millions in the process. What Rock has done takes true courage.&quot; Morgan Fairchild said that &quot;Rock Hudson&#x27;s death gave AIDS a face.&quot; In a telegram that Hudson sent to a September 1985 Hollywood AIDS benefit, Commitment to Life, which he was too ill to attend, Hudson said: &quot;I am not happy that I am sick. I am not happy that I have AIDS. But if that is helping others, I can at least know that my own misfortune has had some positive worth.&quot;

Shortly after his death, &quot;People&quot; reported: &quot;Since Hudson made his announcement, more than $1.8 million in private contributions (more than double the amount collected in 1984) has been raised to support AIDS research and to care for AIDS victims (5,523 reported in 1985 alone). A few days after Hudson died, Congress set aside $221 million to develop a cure for AIDS.&quot; Organizers of the Hollywood AIDS benefit Commitment to Life reported that it was necessary to move the event to a larger venue to accommodate the increased attendance following Hudson&#x27;s announcement that he was suffering from the disease. Shortly before his death, Hudson made the first direct contribution, $250,000, to amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research, helping launch the non-profit organization dedicated to AIDS/HIV research and prevention; it was formed by the merger of a Los Angeles organization founded by: Michael S. Gottlieb, Hudson&#x27;s physician, and Elizabeth Taylor, his friend and onetime co-star, and a New York-based group.

However, Hudson&#x27;s revelation did not immediately dispel the stigma of AIDS. Although then-President Ronald Reagan and his wife Nancy were friends of Hudson, Reagan made no public statement concerning Hudson&#x27;s condition. Reagan to that point had not publicly acknowledged AIDS, and would not until two months later in September 1985. However, Reagan did phone Hudson privately in his Paris hospital room where he was being treated in July 1985 and released a condolence statement after his death.

After Hudson revealed his diagnosis, a controversy arose concerning his participation in a scene in the television drama &quot;Dynasty&quot;, in which he shared a long and repeated kiss with actress Linda Evans in one episode (first aired in February 1985). When filming the scene, Hudson was aware that he had AIDS but did not inform Evans. Some felt that he should have disclosed his condition to her beforehand. At the time, it was incorrectly thought that the virus was present in low quantities in saliva and tears, but there had been no reported cases of transmission by kissing. Nevertheless, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had warned against exchanging saliva with members of groups perceived to be at high risk for AIDS.

According to comments given in August 1985 by Ed Asner, then-president of the Screen Actors Guild, Hudson&#x27;s revelation caused incipient &quot;panic&quot; within the film and television industry. Asner said that he was aware of scripts being rewritten to eliminate kissing scenes. Later in the same year, the guild issued rules requiring that actors be notified in advance of any &quot;open-mouth&quot; kissing scenes with a provision that they could refuse to participate in such scenes without penalty. Linda Evans appears not to have been angry at Hudson, and asked to introduce the segment of the 1985 Commitment to Life benefit that was dedicated to Hudson.

==Legacy==

For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Hudson was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (located at 6116 Hollywood Blvd). Following his death, Elizabeth Taylor, his co-star in the film &quot;Giant&quot;, purchased a bronze plaque for Hudson on the West Hollywood Memorial Walk. In 2002, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars was dedicated to him.

==Lawsuits==
Following Hudson&#x27;s death, Marc Christian, Hudson&#x27;s former lover, sued his estate on grounds of &quot;intentional infliction of emotional distress&quot;. Christian claimed that Hudson continued having sex with him until February 1985, more than eight months after Hudson knew that he had HIV. Although he repeatedly tested negative for HIV, Christian claimed that he suffered from &quot;severe emotional distress&quot; after learning from a July 25, 1985, newscast that Hudson had been diagnosed with AIDS. Christian also sued Hudson&#x27;s personal secretary Mark Miller for $10 million because Miller allegedly lied to him about Hudson&#x27;s illness. In 1989, a jury awarded Christian $21.75 million in damages, later reduced to $5.5 million. Later, Christian defended Hudson&#x27;s reputation in not telling him he was infected: &quot;You can&#x27;t dismiss a man&#x27;s whole life with a single act. This thing about AIDS was totally out of character for him&quot;, he stated in an interview.

In 1990, Hudson&#x27;s live-in publicist, Tom Clark, and publicist Dick Kleiner published &quot;Rock Hudson, Friend of Mine&quot;. In the book, Clark said he believed Hudson acquired HIV from blood transfusions during quintuple bypass open-heart surgery in 1981, never acknowledging that their relationship went beyond being roommates, and characterized Christian as disreputable. Christian filed a $22 million libel suit against the authors and publisher, charging that he had been labelled &quot;a criminal, a thief, an unclean person, a blackmailer, a psychotic, an extortionist, a forger, a perjurer, a liar, a whore, an arsonist and a squatter&quot;.

In 2010, Robert Park Mills, the attorney who represented the Hudson estate against Christian in court, released a book titled &quot;Between Rock and a Hard Place: In Defense of Rock Hudson&quot;. In the book, Mills discusses details of the trial and also questions Christian&#x27;s allegations against Hudson.

<doc id="161467" wikidata="Q336115" url="?curid=161467" title="Theognis of Megara">
<text>Theognis of Megara (, &quot;Théognis ho Megareús&quot;) was a Greek lyric poet active in approximately the sixth century BC. The work attributed to him consists of gnomic poetry quite typical of the time, featuring ethical maxims and practical advice about life. He was the first Greek poet known to express concern over the eventual fate and survival of his own work and, along with Homer, Hesiod and the authors of the Homeric Hymns, he is among the earliest poets whose work has been preserved in a continuous manuscript tradition (the work of other archaic poets is preserved as scattered fragments). In fact more than half of the extant elegiac poetry of Greece before the Alexandrian period is included in the approximately 1,400 lines of verse attributed to him, though several poems traditionally attributed to him were composed by others, e.g. Solon and Euenus. Some of these verses inspired ancient commentators to value him as a moralist yet the entire corpus is valued today for its &quot;warts and all&quot; portrayal of aristocratic life in archaic Greece.

The verses preserved under Theognis&#x27; name are written from the viewpoint of an aristocrat confronted by social and political revolution typical of Greek cities in the archaic period. Part of his work is addressed to Cyrnus, who is presented as his &quot;erōmenos&quot;. The author of the poems celebrated him in his verse and educated him in the aristocratic values of the time, yet Cyrnus came to symbolize much about his imperfect world that the poet bitterly resented:
In spite of such self-disclosures, almost nothing is known about Theognis the man: little is recorded by ancient sources and modern scholars question the authorship of most of the poems preserved under his name.

==Life==
Ancient commentators, the poems themselves and even modern scholars offer mixed signals about the poet&#x27;s life. Some of the poems respond in a personal and immediate way to events widely dispersed in time.

Ancient sources record dates in the mid-sixth centuryEusebius dates Theognis in the 58th Olympiad (548–45 BC), Suda the 59th Olympiad (544–41 BC) and Chronicon Paschale the 57th Olympiad (552–49 BC)yet it is not clear whether Suda in this case means a date of birth or some other significant event in the poet&#x27;s life. Some scholars have argued that the sources could have derived their dates from lines 773–82 under the assumption that these refer to Harpagus&#x27;s attack on Ionia in the reign of Cyrus The Great.

Chronological evidence from the poems themselves is hampered by their uncertain authenticity. Lines 29–52, if composed by Theognis, seem to portray the political situation in Megara before the rise of the tyrant Theagenes, about the latter half of the &quot;seventh century&quot;, but lines 891–95 describe a war in Euboea in the second quarter of the &quot;sixth century&quot;, and lines 773–82 seem to refer to the Persian invasion of mainland Greece in the reign of Xerxes, at the end of the first quarter of the &quot;fifth century&quot;.

Even some modern scholars have interpreted those lines in that time-frame, deducing a birth date on or just before 600 BC, while others place his birth around 550 BC to fit in with the Persian invasion under either Darius or Xerxes.

There is confusion also about his &quot;place&quot; of birth, &quot;Megara&quot;, which Plato for example understood to be Megara Hyblaea in Sicily, while a scholiast on Plato cites Didymus for the rival theory that the poet was born in a Megara in Attica, and ventures the opinion that Theognis might have later migrated to the Sicilian Megara (a similar theory had assigned an Attic birthplace to the Spartan poet Tyrtaeus).

Modern scholars in general opt for a birthplace in mainland Greek Megara though a suitable context for the poems could be found just about anywhere in archaic Greece and there are options for mix-and-match, such as a birth in mainland Megara and then migration to Sicilian Megara (lines 1197–1201 mention dispossession/exile and lines 783–88 journeys to Sicily, Euboea and Sparta).

The elegiac verses attributed to Theognis present him as a complex character and an exponent of traditional Greek morality. Thus for example Isocrates includes him among &quot;the best advisers for human life&quot;, although all consider words of advice both in poetry and in prose to be most useful, they certainly do not derive the greatest pleasure from listening to them, but their attitude towards them is the same as their attitude towards those who admonish: for although they praise the latter, they prefer to associate with those who share in their follies and not with those who seek to dissuade them. As proof one could cite the poetry of Hesiod, Theognis and Phocylides; for people say that they have been the best advisers for human life, but while saying this they prefer to occupy themselves with one another&#x27;s follies than with the precepts of those poets.&quot;Isocrates, &quot;To Nicocles&quot; 42–4, cited and translated by Douglas E. Gerber, &quot;Greek Elegiac Poetry&quot;, Loeb Classical Library (1999), page 171–3, yet in the Meno, Plato&#x27;s Socrates cites some Theognidean verses to dismiss the poet as a confused and self-contradictory sophist whose teachings are not to be trusted, while a modern scholar excuses self-contradictions as typical of a lifelong poet writing over many years and at the whim of inspiration. The &quot;Theognidea&quot; might in fact be a collection of elegiac poems by different authors (see Modern scholarship below) and the &quot;life&quot; that emerges from them depends on which poems editors consider authentic.

Two modern authorities have drawn these portraits of Theognis, based on their own selections of his work:

==Work==

===Transmission===
It was probably his reputation as a moralist, significant enough to deserve comment by Aristotle and Plato, that guaranteed the survival of his work through the Byzantine period. However, it is clear that we do not possess his total output. The Byzantine Suda, for example, mentions 2800 lines of elegiacs, twice the number preserved in medieval manuscripts. Different scholars have different theories about the transmission of the text to account for the discrepancy. The surviving manuscripts of Theognis preserve an anthology of ancient elegy, including selections from other elegists such as Tyrtaeus; scholars disagree over which parts were written by Theognis. The collection is preserved in more than forty manuscripts, comprising a continuous series of elegiac couplets that modern editors now separate into some 300 to 400 &quot;poems&quot;, according to personal preferences.

The best of these manuscripts, dated to the early 10th century, includes an end section titled &quot;Book 2&quot; (sometimes referred to as &quot;Musa Paedica&quot;), which features some hundred additional couplets and which &quot;harps on the same theme throughout—boy love.&quot; The quality of the verse in the end section is radically diverse, ranging from &quot;exquisite and simple beauty&quot; to &quot;the worst specimens of the bungler&#x27;s art&quot;, and many scholars have rejected it as a spurious addition, including the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche (see Nietzsche and Theognis below). However, many modern scholars consider the verses of Book 2 an integral part of the collection. The rest of the work also raises issues about authenticity, since some couplets look like lines attributed by ancient sources to other poets (Solon, Euenus, Mimnermus and Tyrtaeus). and other couplets are repeated with few or no changes elsewhere in the text. Ironically, Theognis mentions to his friend Cyrnus precautions that he has taken to ensure the fidelity of his legacy:

The nature of this seal and its effectiveness in preserving his work is much disputed by scholars (see Modern scholarship below).

===Subject matter===
All the poetry attributed to Theognis deals with subjects typically discussed at aristocratic symposiadrinking parties that had symbolic and practical significance for the participants:

Sympotic topics covered by Theognis include wine, politics, friendship, war, life&#x27;s brevity, human nature, wealth and love. Distinctions are frequently made between &quot;good&quot; () and &quot;bad&quot; (), a dichotomy based on a class distinction between aristocrats and &quot;others&quot;, typical of the period but usually implicit in the works of earlier poets such as Homer—&quot;In Theognis it amounts to an obsession&quot;. The verses are addressed to Cyrnus and other individuals of unknown identity, such as Scythes, Simonides, Clearistus, Onomacritus, Democles, Academus, Timagoras, Demonax and Argyris and &quot;Boy&quot;. Poems are also addressed to his own heart or spirit, and deities such as Zeus, Apollo, Artemis, Castor and Pollux, Eros, Ploutos, the Muses and Graces.

Theognis also details the heightened political tensions within Megara during the seventh century. His works depict the arrival of &quot;other men&quot; that have challenged and displaced former members of the elite. His works, particularly lines 53-58, demonstrate that increasing urbanization among the rural populace surrounding Megara has resulted in heightened social pressures within the city. His writings are thought by modern scholars to largely represent the aristocratic viewpoint of the Megarian elite. However, it is difficult for modern scholars to ascertain both Theognis&#x27; position in Megarian society and his role in writing these lines due to possible later additions to his works and the confusion surrounding his origins.

===Poetic style===
Theognis wrote in the archaic elegiac style. An &quot;elegy&quot; in English is associated with lamentation. In ancient Greece it was a much more flexible medium, suitable for performance at drinking parties and public festivals, urging courage in war and surrender in love. It gave the hexameter line of epic verse a lyrical impulse by the addition of a shorter &quot;pentameter&quot; line, in a series of couplets accompanied by the music of the aulos or pipe. Theognis was conservative and unadventurous in his use of language, frequently imitating the epic phrasing of Homer, even using his Ionian dialect rather than the Dorian spoken in Megara, and possibly borrowing inspiration and entire lines from other elegiac poets, such as Tyrtaeus, Mimnermus and Solon. His verses are not always melodious or carefully constructed but he often places key words for good effect and he employs linguistic devices such as asyndeton, familiar in common speech. He was capable of arresting imagery and memorable statements in the form of terse epigrams. Some of these qualities are evident in the following lines [425-8], considered to be &quot;the classic formulation of Greek pessimism&quot;:
The lines were much quoted in antiquity, as for example by Stobaeus and Sextus Empiricus, and it was imitated by later poets, such as Sophocles and Bacchylides. Theognis himself might be imitating others: each of the longer hexameter lines is loosely paraphrased in the shorter pentameter lines, as if he borrowed the longer lines from some unknown source(s) and added the shorter lines to create an elegiac version. Moreover, the last line could be imitating an image from Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; (5.482), where Odysseus covers himself with leaves though some scholars think the key word might be corrupted. The smothering accumulation of eta () sounds in the last line of the Greek is imitated here in the English by &quot;mound round&quot;.

==Scholarship==

=== Classical ===
According to Diogenes Laërtius, the second volume of the collected works of Antisthenes includes a book entitled &quot;Concerning Theognis&quot;. The work does not survive.

=== Modern ===
The collection of verses attributed to Theognis has no overall structure, being a continuous series of elegiac couplets featuring frequent, sudden changes in subject and theme, in which different people are addressed and even the speaker seems to change persona, voicing contradictory statements and, on a couple of occasions, even changing sex. It looks like a miscellaneous collection by different authors (some verses are in fact attributed elsewhere to other poets) but it is not known when or how the collection was finalized. Friedrich Gottlieb Welcker, sometime known as &quot;the father of Theognidean criticism&quot;, was the first modern scholar to edit the collection with a view to separating authentic verses from spurious additions (1826), Ernest Harrison (&quot;Studies in Theognis&quot; 1902) subsequently defended the authenticity of the collection, and thus the scholarly world divided into two camps, which one recent scholar half-jokingly referred to as &quot;separatists&quot; and &quot;unitarians&quot; There have also been divisions within the camps. Separatists have agreed with Theodor Bergk (1843) that the collection was originally assembled as the work of Theognis, into which a large admixture of foreign matter has somehow found its way, or they have believed it was compiled originally as a textbook for use in schools or else as a set of aristocratic drinking songs, in which some verses of Theognis happen to be strongly represented. Quite recently Martin Litchfield West identified 306 lines as a core sequence of verses that can be reliably attributed to Theognis since they contain mention of Cyrnus and are attested by 4th century authorities such as Plato and Aristotle, though the rest of the corpus could still contain some authentic verses. West however acknowledges that the whole collection is valuable since it represents a cross-section of elegiac poetry composed in the sixth and early fifth centuries. According to another view, the quest for authentically Theognidean elegies is rather beside the point—the collection owes its survival to the political motivations of Athenian intellectuals in the 5th and 4th century, disappointed with democracy and sympathetic to old aristocratic values: &quot;The persona of the poet is traditionally based, ideologically conditioned and generically expressed.&quot; According to this view, the verses were drinking songs in so far as the symposium was understood to be a microcosm of society, where multiple views were an aspect of adaptive behaviour by the embattled aristocracy, and where even eroticism had political symbolism: &quot;As the polis envisaged by Theognis is degenerate, erotic relationships are filled with pain...&quot;

In lines 19–22, the poet announces his intention of placing a &quot;seal&quot; on the verses to protect them from theft and corruption. The lines are among the most controversial in Theognidean scholarship and there is a large body of literature dedicated to their explanation. The &#x27;seal&#x27; has been theorized to be the name of Theognis or of Cyrnus or, more generally, the distinct poetic style or else the political or ethical content of the &#x27;poems&#x27;, or even a literal seal on a copy entrusted to some temple, just as Heraclitus of Ephesus was said once to have sealed and stored a copy of his work at the Artemisium.

==== Friedrich Nietzsche ====
Friedrich Nietzsche, the German philosopher, already studied the work of Theognis during his school days at Schulpforta, the subject of his thesis entitled De Theognide Megarensi, an activity which he continued during his studies at Leipzig University. His first published article (in an influential classical journal, &quot;Rheinisches Museum&quot;) concerned the historical transmission of the collected verses. Nietzsche was an ardent exponent of &quot;catchword theory&quot;, which explains the arrangement of the Theognidean verses as pairs of poems, each pair linked by a shared word or catchword that could be placed anywhere in either poem, as for example in these pairs:
:lines 1–10 (&quot;child of God&quot;) and lines 11–14 (&quot;daughter of God&quot;);
:lines 11–14 (&quot;daughter of God) and lines 15–18 (&quot;daughters of God&quot;);
:lines 15–18 (&quot;word&quot;) and lines 19–26 (&quot;words&quot;) etc.
However a later scholar has observed that the catchword principle can be made to work for just about any anthology as a matter of coincidence due to thematic association.

Nietzsche valued Theognis as an archetype of the embattled aristocrat, describing him as &quot;...a finely formed nobleman who has fallen on bad times&quot;, and &quot;a distorted Janus-head&quot; at the crossroads of social change. Not all the verses in the collection however fitted Nietzsche&#x27;s notion of Theognis, the man, and he rejected &quot;Musa Paedica&quot; or &quot;Book 2&quot; as the interpolation of a malicious editor out to discredit him. In one of his seminal works, &quot;On the Genealogy of Morality&quot;, he describes the poet as a &#x27;mouthpiece&#x27; of the Greek nobility: Theognis represents superior virtues as traits of the aristocracy and thus distinguishes (in Nietzsche&#x27;s own words) the &quot;truthful&quot; aristocrat from the &quot;lying common man&quot;.

Charles Darwin represented a widespread preference for a biological interpretation of such statements when he commented on the above lines thus:

<text>Institut Le Rosey (), commonly referred to as Le Rosey or simply Rosey, is a private boarding school in Rolle, Switzerland. Founded in 1880 by Paul-Émile Carnal on the site of the 14th-century Château du Rosey in the town of Rolle in the canton of Vaud, it is among the oldest boarding schools in Switzerland.

The school also owns a campus in the ski resort village of Gstaad in the canton of Bern, to where the student body, faculty and staff move during the months of January through March. In 2015, Christophe Gudin, son of the fourth director of Le Rosey, Philippe Gudin, became the fifth director. Kim Kovacevic is the headmaster.

Le Rosey is included in The Schools Index of the world&#x27;s 150 best private schools and among top 10 international schools in Switzerland.

==Overview==
Le Rosey&#x27;s philosophy is inspired by what Harvard educationalist Howard Gardner has called &quot;multiple intelligences&quot;: &quot;its aim is to develop all Roseans’ talents through academic, sporting and artistic programmes.&quot; The school offers a bilingual and bicultural education with the language of instruction being French or English depending on the student&#x27;s academic program; however, students may take many language classes while at Le Rosey. Students may sit either the International Baccalaureate, the most widely recognised pre-university educational programme, or the Francophone-oriented French Baccalaureate. To sustain an international atmosphere at Le Rosey, there exists a quota where no more than 10% of the students may come from a single country. The student body, ages 8 through 18, is composed of pupils from approximately 58 countries, with 60% of the students being European. The school&#x27;s current enrolment, over 400 pupils, is equally divided between male and female. The majority of students are between the ages of 14 and 18. The student-teacher ratio is 3,5:1 with the average class size being fewer than 20 students, and the average teacher&#x27;s length of stay at Le Rosey is over ten years. Students at Le Rosey are nicknamed &quot;Roséens&quot; (in French) or &quot;Roseans&quot; (in English), and former students are labeled &quot;Les Anciens Roséens&quot;. The school&#x27;s campus has of landscaped grounds. The school&#x27;s sailing centre, the &quot;Fleur d&#x27;Eau&quot;, is situated along 100 metres of shoreline on Lake Geneva. Le Rosey is reportedly the only boarding school in the world to change campuses seasonally. In spring and autumn, classes are held at the Château du Rosey campus in the village of Rolle in the canton of Vaud, located between Geneva and Lausanne in southwestern Switzerland. For the winter months of January through March, the entire student body moves to a group of chalets in the ski resort town of Gstaad in the canton of Bern.

Le Rosey offers a wide range of sports, including: football, basketball, volleyball, cross country running, sailing, rowing, swimming, and water skiing during the spring and autumn terms. During the winter term, sports options are skiing, snowboarding, ice hockey, curling, and snowshoeing.

== History ==


Château du Rosey, a feudal chateau located on Le Rosey&#x27;s main campus at Rolle, dates to the Middle Ages and houses the school&#x27;s central reception area. In 1880, the site of Le Rosey&#x27;s campus was chosen by the school&#x27;s founder, Paul-Emile Carnal, &quot;a lover of nature, history and the countryside&quot;. The school&#x27;s campus at Rolle is situated adjacent to the famous Lake Geneva. In 1911, the founder passed the ownership of Le Rosey to his son, Henri-Paul Carnal. In 1917, the school began to go to Gstaad in the German-speaking canton of Bern for the winter months to escape the dense fog that settles in on Lake Geneva.

In 1931, Lucien Brunel, a former member of the International Red Cross and former director of the school of the Grand-Lancy Castle, took on, by demand of Henri Carnal, the direction of Rosey until 1949. In 1947, the third generation of directors, Louis Johannot and Helen Schaub, assumed ownership of Le Rosey. Under the same ownership, Le Rosey admitted girls for the first time in 1967 and opened a separate girls&#x27; campus. In 1980, the current owners, Philippe and Anne Gudin de la Sablonnière, became the fourth generation of Directors at Le Rosey. Louis Johannot, in an interview with &quot;Life Magazine&quot; in 1965, made a comment that received considerable attention: &quot;The only reason I always try to meet and know the parents better is because it helps me to forgive their children.&quot;

Prior to the introduction of the 10% quota, wherein no more than 10% of the student body may come from one country, different nationalities made up the majority of students at Le Rosey. In the 1950s and 1960s, the majority of students were American, Italian, or Greek; in the 1970s the majority was Arab or Iranian; in the 1980s the majority was Japanese or Korean; and in the 1990s the majority was Russian. During the 1990s, the children of Russian oligarchs, who made up a third of the student body, gained notoriety for &quot;terrorizing&quot; other students, something that is disputed, resulting in the withdrawal of at least one non-Russian student.

In 2014, Le Rosey inaugurated the Paul &amp; Henri Carnal Hall, an arts and learning centre for Le Rosey and the La Côte region.

==Accreditation==
===Swiss===
Le Rosey&#x27;s (upper) secondary education (&quot;Middle and High School&quot;) is not approved as a Gymnasium by the bureau for gymnasial and vocational education MBA (&quot;Mittelschul- und Berufsbildungsamt MBA&quot;), administration for education (&quot;Erziehungsdirektion&quot;), canton of Bern, nor by the Swiss Federal State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI).

===International===
Institut Le Rosey is fully accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges, the International Baccalaureate, the Ministry of National Education of France and the Council of International Schools. Le Rosey is also a member of the European Council of International Schools.

== Academic curriculum ==
Institut Le Rosey&#x27;s academic curriculum is designed to &quot;provide education of breadth, depth and quality for an international student body.&quot; Le Rosey offers a rigorous bilingual and bicultural education with the principal language of instruction being French or English depending on the student&#x27;s academic programme. Beginning in Class 9 (US 3rd grade) and ending in Class 7 (US 5th grade), Junior students at Le Rosey follow the Primary Bilingual Programme. The Programme follows the French national curriculum for classes taught in French and the British national curriculum for classes taught in English, which are both complemented by the International Primary Curriculum to create an international education.

Le Rosey students in Classes 6–2 (US 6th–10th grade) choose their principal language and continue their studies in French or English. If possible, students may study their mother tongue and a third or even a fourth language in addition to their principal language of instruction. Over 20 different languages have been taught at Le Rosey in the past five years. During the Secondary Bilingual Programme, English and French classes are obligatory, and upon entering Class 3 (US 9th grade), students begin the two-year &quot;Pre-Bac&quot; Programme to prepare the students for either the internationally recognised International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Programme or the Francophone-oriented French Baccalaureate. At Le Rosey, the IB Diploma Programme and the French Baccalaureate cover the last two years of schooling (Class 1 and Class t).

== Facilities ==

=== Rolle campus ===
Le Rosey&#x27;s main campus, near Rolle, is on adjacent to Lake Geneva. It is divided into two campuses, one for boys situated on the main campus and one for girls called La Combe. The boarding houses contain a total of 179 bedrooms with en suite bathrooms, and all together the academic buildings contain: 53 classrooms, eight science laboratories, 14 specially-equipped rooms, 48 apartments for Le Rosey teachers, two infirmaries, a library/media centre with about 20,000 to 30,000 literary and reference works, a theatre, three dining rooms and two canteens, an auditorium, two gyms, and an ecumenical chapel. Sports and arts facilities at Le Rosey include: ten clay tennis courts, a indoor pool and wellness centre, a 25-metre outdoor pool, three football pitches, a synthetic rugby pitch, a wood chip running track, a shooting and archery range, an open-air theatre, and a computer-regulated greenhouse. Off-campus Le Rosey owns a private equestrian centre housing 30 horses, an indoor riding school, a dressage area, and a clubhouse. Also off-campus is the Le Rosey sailing centre equipped with ten dinghies, three motorboats, three yawls and a yacht.

=== Gstaad campus ===

The school&#x27;s winter campus, at the ski resort of Gstaad in the Bernese Oberland, is composed of several traditional chalets within the town. The girls&#x27; campus, at Schönried, is situated a 10-minute train ride away from Gstaad and is composed of five chalets used solely for boarding and dining. The students utilise local facilities, including: swimming pool, fitness centre, tennis courts, ice hockey rink, a bowling alley, curling, of alpine ski slopes and of cross-country ski tracks, of snowshoeing trails, climbing walls, and via ferratas.

== Tuition fees ==
, the annual boarding and academic fees are CHF 125,000 (approximately US$133,000), without extra fees such as those for sports, etc. The Rosey Foundation, which oversees the financing of Le Rosey&#x27;s Carnal Hall, makes scholarships possible to &quot;particularly deserving&quot; students, and the four-member Rosey Scholarship Committee allots them to the approved students. However, Institut Le Rosey does not directly offer scholarships to any person; scholarships are only made available through the Rosey Foundation.

== Associations ==
L&#x27;Association Internationale des Anciens Roséens (AIAR), the International Association of Former Roseans, is Le Rosey&#x27;s alumni association, the members of which have been major contributors to 20th-century world history. The AIAR, a prestigious network of former students, has alumni representatives in most countries and in many major cities across the world. Le Rosey&#x27;s first alumni association, the &quot;Old Rosey Association&quot;, was created on 21 July 1922 by a small group of alumni in the presence of the son of the school&#x27;s founder, Henri Carnal. In 1926, the &quot;Belgian Old Rosey Association&quot; was founded; however, like the Old Rosey Association, it was declining due to slow international communication between alumni. The current alumni association, the AIAR, was established in 1964. The school&#x27;s list of alumni is not published and access to AIAR events and meetings is exclusive to former students.

Institut Le Rosey is fully accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges, the International Baccalaureate, the Ministry of National Education of France and the Council of International Schools. Le Rosey is also a member of the European Council of International Schools.

== Notable alumni ==
Institut Le Rosey has over 5,000 former students. It has educated generations of dynastic families, including members of the Hohenzollern, Cavendish, Rothschild, Koskull, Metternich, Borghese, Hohenlohe, Rockefeller, Niarchos, Safra, Du Pont and Radziwiłł families. The school has educated royalty and high society from around the world, such as Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, the Muhammad Ali Dynasty of Egypt, the House of Glücksburg of Greece and the House of Savoy of Italy.

Le Rosey has educated several monarchs, including the Aga Khan IV, King Albert II of Belgium, King Baudouin I of Belgium, King Fuad II of Egypt, King Ntare V of Burundi, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Persia and Prince Rainier III of Monaco.

Other notable alumni include Princess &quot;Ashi&quot; Euphelma Choden Wangchuck and Prince &quot;Dasho&quot; Ugyen Jigme Wangchuck of Bhutan, Guillaume, Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg, Princess Fawzia-Latifa of Egypt, Marie-Chantal, Crown Princess of Greece, her sisters Pia Getty and Alexandra von Fürstenberg, John Lennon&#x27;s son Sean Lennon, the Swiss entrepreneur Eugenio Losa, rewilding advocate Randal Plunkett, 21st Baron of Dunsany, heiress Tatiana Santo Domingo, The Strokes&#x27; Julian Casablancas, Albert Hammond Jr. and actress Tracee Ellis Ross.

== In fiction and popular culture ==
In fiction, the school is most commonly mentioned in novels relating to the rich and famous, and usually takes the role of being the choice of education for different characters. Le Rosey has been mentioned in Judith Krantz&#x27;s novels &quot;Princess Daisy&quot; (1980) and &quot;Till We Meet Again&quot; (1988), as well as in several romance novels by Karen Robards. The school is also mentioned in &quot;Master of the Game&quot; (1982) by Sidney Sheldon, &quot;Answered Prayers&quot; (1986) by Truman Capote, &quot;Any Woman&#x27;s Blues&quot; (1990) by Erica Jong, &quot;For Love Alone&quot; (1992) by Ivana Trump, and &quot;What Became of Her&quot; (2002) by Marijane Meaker. Similarly, Le Rosey is mentioned in Bret Easton Ellis&#x27; novel &quot;American Psycho&quot; (1991), as the alma mater of Evelyn Williams, who is the protagonist&#x27;s fiancée. In the movie &quot;Monte Carlo&quot;, the character Cordelia Winthrop-Scott, played by Selena Gomez, attended Le Rosey. In a 2002 episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;, affluent character Martha Strick, played by Veanne Cox, says she attended Le Rosey. Two prominent characters in Emily in Paris, Mindy and Nicolas, knew each from their time at Le Rosey.

In non-fiction, alumni Michael Korda and James Laughlin have written about their experiences and memories at Le Rosey. Columnist Taki Theodoracopulos has written extensively on the school and its alumni, and was in the middle of a mild controversy when in 1998 he jokingly wrote in &quot;The Spectator&quot; that Osama bin Laden had attended Le Rosey. The story resulted in an outcry from American readers, inquiries from several magazines, and the school publicly and &quot;vehemently&quot; denying that bin Laden had attended Le Rosey. In 1999, American journalist Paul Klebnikov wrote an exposé on Le Rosey in &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine detailing the problems the school was experiencing with its majority Russian student body. Richard René Silvin released his book &quot;I survived Swiss Boarding Schools&quot; in 2006 and a second edition in 2018, chronicling his time at Le Rosey in the 50s and 60s.

== Plans to leave Gstaad ==
In January 2008, Swiss economics magazine &quot;Bilanz&quot;, a subsidiary of Edipresse, published an interview with Le Rosey Director-General Philippe Gudin that revealed the school is seeking to sell its Gstaad winter campus and build a new campus in another location. Gudin is in negotiations with the local authorities in Schönried, a suburb of Gstaad located a few minutes away, to construct a new main campus on an undeveloped piece of land, but has run into difficulties due to zoning restrictions. Reasons for moving to a new campus, according to the Director-General, include the fact that the school&#x27;s personnel, who typically live on campus, are at maximum capacity, and that the student body can no longer increase in size due to the lack of space. Gudin stated that for the moment the new winter campus location will be in Switzerland, but he has not ruled out the French Alps. The of prime real estate that the school occupies on Ried Hill in the centre of Gstaad is estimated to be worth several hundreds of millions of USD, considering the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; reports that the price per square meter in Gstaad starts at 20,000 CHF (19,000 US$) and can rise to 45,000 CHF (43,000 US$). Gudin asserts that the high value of the Gstaad winter campus has nothing to do with its planned sale.

<text>Mimnermus ( &quot;Mímnermos&quot;) was a Greek elegiac poet from either Colophon or Smyrna in Ionia, who flourished about 632–629 BC (i.e. in the 37th Olympiad, according to Suda). He was strongly influenced by Homer, yet he wrote short poems suitable for performance at drinking parties and was remembered by ancient authorities chiefly as a love poet. Mimnermus in turn exerted a strong influence on Hellenistic poets such as Callimachus and thus also on Roman poets such as Propertius, who even preferred him to Homer for his eloquence on love themes (see Comments by other poets below).

His work was collected by Alexandrian scholars in just two &quot;books&quot; (relatively few compared for example with the twenty-six books for Stesichorus) and today only small fragments survive. The fragments confirm the ancient estimate of him as a &quot;consummate poet&quot; but also indicate that he was a &quot;sturdier character&quot; than the indulgent love poet he was assumed to be by various ancient commentators. Almost no reliable biographical details have been recorded. One ancient account linked him romantically with a flute girl who subsequently gave her name, Nanno, to one of his two books.

==Life and work ==
The Byzantine encyclopaedia &quot;Suda&quot; provides a good example of the biographical uncertainties.

The gap indicates a corruption in the text and the original wording probably testified to two books, though the only source we have for this number was the grammarian Pomponius Porphyrion. The &quot;Suda&quot;″s mention of Astypalaea, an island in the southern Aegean, as a possible candidate for the poet&#x27;s home town is mere fantasy. Smyrna seems to be the most likely candidate. The nickname &quot;Ligyaistades&quot; was probably taken by the &quot;Suda&quot; from an elegy addressed to Mimnermus by one of the seven sages—the Athenian lawgiver and elegiac poet, Solon (see Comments by other poets). Solon clearly admired the skills of the older poet, whom he addressed as &quot;Ligyaistades&quot;, yet he objected to his hedonism and singled out this couplet for criticism:

Solon thought he should be willing to live to eighty. Plutarch was another ancient author critical of the poet&#x27;s self-indulgence, dismissing one poem (see Fragment 1 in Poetic style below) as &quot;the utterances of intemperate people.&quot; Mimnermus however was not timid in his hedonism, as indicated by a couplet attributed to him in the Palatine Anthology, an exhortation to others to live intemperately: &quot;Enjoy yourself. Some of the harsh citizens will speak ill of you, some better.&quot;. However, the same lines have also been attributed to Theognis. A robust side to his personality is shown by his versatility as a poet. Archaic elegy was often used for patriotic purposes, to screw courage to the sticking place in times of war and to celebrate national achievements, and there is ample evidence that Mimnermus assumed this role as a poet. A quote recorded by the geographer Strabo represents the earliest surviving account of the Ionian migration, celebrating the settlement of Colophon and Smyrna from Pylos,
 while another quotation, recorded by Stobaeus, describes the heroic exploits of a Greek warrior against the cavalry of the Lydian king, Gyges, early in the 7th century—Mimnermus evidently hoped thereby to strengthen his countrymen&#x27;s resolve against further Lydian encroachments. The name &quot;Mimnermus&quot; might have been chosen by his parents to commemorate a famous Smyrnean victory against Gyges near the Hermus river (and yet names ending in -&quot;ermus&quot; were quite common in Ionia). He was alive when Smyrna was besieged for the final time by the Lydians under Alyattes of Lydia and possibly he died with the town. The disappearance of Smyrna for the next three hundred years might be the reason why Colophon was able to claim the poet as one of its own, yet Smyrna&#x27;s own claim persisted and this suggests that its claim had the advantage of being true.

Smyrna lay near Mount Sipylos, one of whose rocky outcrops was traditionally imagined to be the tragic figure Niobe. Like other archaic poets, Mimnermus adapted myths to his own artistic needs and Aelian recorded that he attributed twenty children to Niobe, unlike Homer, for example, who attributed twelve to her. According to Sallustius, Mimnermus was just as creative in his poetical account of Ismene, representing her as being killed by Tydeus at the command of the goddess, Athena, in the very act of making love to Theoclymenus—an original account that was soon accepted by an international audience, being represented on an early Corinthian amphora (pictured below). Imaginative accounts of the sun, voyaging at night from west to east in a golden bed, and of Jason the Argonaut voyaging to &quot;Aeetes&#x27; city, where the rays of the swift Sun lie in a golden storeroom at the edge of Oceanus&quot;, survive in brief quotes by ancient authors. According to Strabo, Smyrna was named after an Amazon and, according to a manuscript on proverbs, Mimnermus once composed on the theme of the proverb &quot;A lame man makes the best lover&quot;, illustrating the Amazonian practice of maiming their men.

==Nanno==

Unlike epic and lyric verse, which were accompanied by stringed instruments (the cithara and barbiton respectively), elegy was accompanied by a wind instrument (the aulos) and its performance therefore required at least two people—one to sing and one to play. Ancient accounts associate Mimnermus with a female aulos player, Nanno (Ναννώ), and one makes him her lover (see quote from Hermesianax in Comments by other poets below). Another ancient source indicates that Mimnermus was a pederast, which is consistent with conventional sexual themes in Greek elegy. However, as noted by Martin Litchfield West, Mimnermus could have been a pederast and yet still have composed elegies about his love for Nanno: &quot;Greek pederasty ... was for the most part a substitute for heterosexual love, free contacts between the sexes being restricted by society.&quot; Mimnermus apparently was also capable of playing all by himself—Strabo described him as &quot;both a pipe-player and an elegiac poet&quot;. According to the poet Hipponax, Mimnermus when piping used the melancholy &quot;fig-branch strain,&quot; apparently a traditional melody played while scapegoats were ritually driven from town, whipped with fig branches. 
Ancient commentators sometimes refer to a work called &quot;Nanno&quot; and there is one clear reference to a work called &quot;Smyrneis&quot;. Modern scholars have concluded that these could be the two books mentioned by Porphyrion. The &quot;Nanno&quot; appears to have been a collection of short poems on a variety of themes (not just love), whereas the &quot;Smyrneis&quot; appears to have been a quasi-epic about Smyrna&#x27;s confrontation with the Lydians. A cryptic comment by the Hellenistic poet Callimachus (see Comments by other poets below) also seems to refer to those two books, commending one for &quot;sweetness&quot; and distinguishing it from &quot;the great lady&quot;. The latter seems to be a reference to &quot;Smyrneis&quot;, whereas the sweet verses—apparently the slender, economical kind of verses on which Callimachus modelled his own poetry—appear to refer to &quot;Nanno&quot;. However, the comment is preserved as an incomplete fragment and modern scholars are not unanimous in their interpretation of it. Another Callimachus fragment has been interpreted as proof that Mimnermus composed some iambic verse but this conjecture has also been disputed.

==Poetic style==

Elegy has been described as &quot;a variation upon the heroic hexameter, in the direction of lyric poetry,&quot; and, in Mimnermus, this takes the form of a variation on Homer, as appears for example in Fragment 1, quoted below, about which one modern scholar had this to say&quot;

Typically, the elegiac couplet enabled a poet to develop his ideas in brief, striking phrases, often made more memorable by internal rhyme in the shorter, pentameter line. Mimnermus employs the internal rhyme in the pentameter lines 2 () and 4 (). Here is the same poem paraphrased in English to imitate the rhythms of an elegy, with half-rhymes employed in the same lines 2 (far...for) and 4 (youth...bloom):
::What is life, what is sweet, if it is missing golden Aphrodite?
:::Death would be better by far than to live with no time for
::Amorous assignations and the gift of tenderness and bedrooms,
:::All of those things that give youth all of its covetted bloom,
::Both for men and for women. But when there arrives the vexatiousness
:::Of old age, even good looks alter to unsightliness
::And the heart wears away under the endlessness of its anxieties:
:::There is no joy anymore then in the light of the sun;
::In children there is found hate and in women there is found no respect.
:::So difficult has old age been made for us all by God!
Commenting on the poem, Maurice Bowra observed that &quot;...after the challenging, flaunting opening we are led through a swift account of youth, and then as we approach the horrors of old age, the verse becomes slower, the sentences shorter, the stops more emphatic, until the poet closes with a short, damning line of summary.&quot;

Of all the other early elegists, only Archilochus might be compared with Mimnermus for effective use of language, both being lifelong poets of outstanding skill.

<text>The Short Stirling was a British four-engined heavy bomber of the Second World War. It has the distinction of being the first four-engined bomber to be introduced into service with the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the war (the earlier Handley Page V/1500 being a WWI design that served during the 1920s).

The Stirling was designed during the late 1930s by Short Brothers to conform with the requirements laid out in Air Ministry Specification B.12/36. Prior to this, the RAF had been primarily interested in developing increasingly capable twin-engined bombers, but had been persuaded to investigate a prospective four-engined bomber as a result of promising foreign developments in the field. Out of the submissions made to the specification, Supermarine proposed the Type 317, which was viewed as the favourite, whereas Short&#x27;s submission, named the S.29, was selected as an alternative. When the preferred Type 317 had to be abandoned, the S.29, which later received the name Stirling, proceeded to production.

In early 1941, the Stirling entered squadron service. During its use as a bomber, pilots praised the type for its ability to out-turn enemy night fighters and its favourable handling characteristics, whereas the altitude ceiling was often a subject of criticism. The Stirling had a relatively brief operational career as a bomber before being relegated to second-line duties from late 1943, due to the increasing availability of the more capable Handley Page Halifax and Avro Lancaster, which took over the strategic bombing of Germany. Decisions by the Air Ministry on certain performance requirements (most significantly to restrict the wingspan of the aircraft to ) had played a role in limiting the Stirling&#x27;s performance; the 100 ft limit also affected earlier models of the Halifax (MkI and MkII) though the Lancaster never adhered to it.

During its later service, the Stirling was used for mining German ports; new and converted aircraft also flew as glider tugs and supply aircraft during the Allied invasion of Europe in 1944–1945. In the aftermath of the Second World War, the type was rapidly withdrawn from RAF service, having been replaced in the transport role by the Avro York, a derivative of the Lancaster that had previously displaced it from the bomber role. Several ex-military Stirlings were rebuilt for the civilian market.
==Development==
===Origins===
In the 1930s, the Royal Air Force (RAF) was interested primarily in twin-engined bombers. These designs put limited demands on engine production and maintenance, both of which were already stretched with the introduction of so many new types into service. Power limitations were so serious that the British invested in the development of huge engines in the 2,000-horsepower (1,500 kW) class to improve performance. During the late 1930s, none of these were ready for production. The United States and the Soviet Union were pursuing the development of bombers powered by arrangements of four smaller engines; the results of these projects proved to possess favourable characteristics such as excellent range and fair lifting capacity, and in 1936, the RAF also decided to investigate the feasibility of the four-engined bomber.

The Air Ministry published Specification B.12/36, for a high-speed, long-range, four-engined strategic bomber aircraft that would be capable of being designed and constructed at speed. The bomb load was to be a maximum of carried to a range of or a lesser payload of to (very demanding for the era). It was to have a crew of six and was to have a normal all-up weight of 48,000 lb, while a maximum overload weight of 65,000 lb was also envisioned. The aircraft would have to be capable of cruising at speeds of 230 mph or greater while flying at , carrying three gun turrets (located in the nose, amidships, and rear positions) for defence.

The aircraft should also be able to be used as a troop transport for 24 soldiers and be able to use catapult assistance for takeoff when heavily laden. The concept was that the aircraft would fly troops to far corners of the British Empire and then support them with bombing. To help with this task, as well as ease production, it needed to be able to be broken down into parts, for transport by train. Since it could be operating from limited &quot;back country&quot; airfields, it needed to lift off from a runway and be able to clear trees at the end, a specification with which most small aircraft would have a problem today. Aviation author Geoffrey Norris observed that the stringent requirements given in the specification for the prospective aircraft to be able to make use of existing infrastructure, specifically the specified maximum wingspan of 100 feet, adversely affected the Stirling&#x27;s performance, such as its relatively low ceiling and its inability to carry anything larger than 500 lb bombs.

In mid-1936, Specification B.12/36 was sent out to Supermarine, Boulton Paul, Handley Page, and Armstrong Whitworth. In August, the specification was issued to the rest of British industry. Left out of those asked to tender designs, Shorts were later included because the company already had similar designs in hand while possessing ample design staff and production facilities to fulfil production commitments. Shorts were producing several four-engined flying boat designs of the required size and created their S.29 proposal by removing the lower deck and boat hull of the S.25 Sunderland. The new S.29 design was similar to the Sunderland; the wings and controls were the same, construction was identical, and it even retained the slight upward bend at the rear of the fuselage, which had originally been intended to keep the Sunderland&#x27;s tail clear of sea spray. As originally designed, the S.29 was considered to be capable of favourable high-altitude performance.

Following a Tender Design Conference in October 1936, the S.29 was low down on the short list of designs considered. Vickers Type 293 submission was first followed by the Boulton Paul P.90, Armstrong Whitworth&#x27;s AW.42, the Supermarine Type 316, and then the Short S.29. The Supermarine was ordered in prototype (two aircraft) form as the revised Supermarine Type 317 in January 1937. An alternative design to the Supermarine was needed for insurance, and Shorts should build it, as they had experience with four-engined aircraft. The original design had been criticised when considered, and in February 1937, the Air Ministry suggested modifications to the design, including considering the use of the Bristol Hercules radial engine as an alternative to the Napier Dagger inline, increasing service ceiling to 28,000 ft (carrying a 2000 lb of bombs) and reducing the wingspan. Shorts accepted this large amount of redesign work. The project had added importance due to the death of Supermarine&#x27;s designer, Reginald Mitchell, which had generated doubt within the Air Ministry about the ability of Supermarine to deliver. Two prototypes were ordered from Shorts.

The S.29 used the Sunderland&#x27;s wing and it had to be reduced to less than To get the needed lift from a shorter span and excess weight, the redesigned wing was thickened and reshaped. The wingspan was often said to be limited to 100 ft so the aircraft would fit into existing hangars, but the maximum hangar opening was and the specification required outdoor servicing. The wingspan limit was a method of stopping aircraft from being too large. In June 1937, the S.29 was accepted as the second string for the Supermarine Type 317 and formally ordered in October; Shorts and Supermarine were issued with instructions to proceed.

===Prototypes===
The Air Ministry issued Shorts with contract number 672299/37, under which a pair of prototype S.29s was ordered. However, prior to this, Shorts had decided to undertake a successful practice, which had been performed with the earlier Empire flying boat, in producing a half-scale version of the aircraft, known as the S.31 (also known internally as the M4 – as per the title on the tailfin), to prove the aerodynamic characteristics of the design. The S.31, which was largely composed of wood, was powered by an arrangement of four Pobjoy Niagara engines and featured a retractable undercarriage, operable bomb-bay doors, and other measures to realistically represent the larger production aircraft. It was constructed at Short&#x27;s Rochester facility.
On 19 September 1938, the S.31 conducted its maiden flight, piloted by Shorts&#x27; Chief Test Pilot J. Lankester Parker. Impressed with its performance, on 21 October 1938, Parker flew the S.31 to RAF Martlesham Heath, Suffolk, where it was evaluated by the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment and received mostly favourable reviews. There was one notable criticism amongst the feedback from pilots, being that the length of the takeoff run was considered to be excessive and that improvements would be desirable. Fixing this required that the angle of the wing to be increased for takeoff; however, if the wing itself were modified, the aircraft would fly with a nose-down attitude while cruising (as in the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley); making this change was also complicated by the fact that work on the production line had already reached an advanced stage. Thus, Shorts lengthened the undercarriage struts to tilt the nose up on take-off, leading to its spindly gear, which, in turn, contributed to many takeoff and landing accidents.

The S.31 also received the lengthened undercarriage to test this; subsequent trials found no need for further modification in this respect. Other modifications made included the adoption of a larger tailplane with conventional elevators to improve aft controllability. The sole S.31 was scrapped after a takeoff accident at RAF Stradishall, Suffolk, in February 1944. Meanwhile, before either of the prototypes had flown, the Air Ministry had decided to order the S.29 into production &quot;off the drawing board&quot; in response to reports of further increases in strength on the part of the German Luftwaffe.

On 14 May 1939, the first S.29, which had by this point received the service name &quot;Stirling&quot; after the Scottish city, performed its first flight, but on landing, one of the brakes locked, causing the aircraft to slew off the runway and the landing gear to collapse. The resulting damage caused the first prototype to be written off. A resulting redesign of the undercarriage led to substantially stronger and heavier struts being installed upon the second prototype. On 3 December 1939, the second prototype made its maiden flight.

===Production===
Prior to the Munich Agreement of 1938, Shorts had received a pair of orders for the Stirling, each for the production of 100 aircraft; however, as a result of Munich, the Ministry of Aircraft Production (MAP) enacted &#x27;Plan L&#x27;, under which Stirling orders were rapidly increased to 1,500 aircraft. In addition to contracts extending the projected work at Rochester and Belfast; some of the additional contracts were placed with Austin Motors to be produced at their Longbridge facility and with Rootes, which were to manufacture the type at their new shadow factory in Stoke-on-Trent. At its height, manufacturing activity on the Stirling was being performed at a total of 20 factories. According to Norris, while the aircraft&#x27;s design had incorporated an inherent ability for production of the Stirling to be broken down, in practice, strict supervision of the work remained necessary. To coordinate the dispersed production approach adopted for the Stirling, Shorts and MAP operated a travelling team of 600 production engineers and draughtsmen who routinely travelled throughout the United Kingdom to the manufacturing facilities involved.
On 7 May 1940, the first production Stirling conducted its first flight. According to Norris, initial rates of production were disappointing, and were in part due to delays in the delivery of machine tools and forgings. It has also been alleged that production of the Stirling was negatively impacted by a decision by Lord Beaverbrook, the MAP, which had ordered a change in priority from four-engined bombers towards fighters and twin-engined aircraft to replace those lost during the Battle of Britain. In August 1940, series production of the Stirling commenced at the Rochester factory.

Production of the Stirling was delayed by the ongoing bombing campaign of the Luftwaffe. The area, which included a number of major aviation firms, was heavily bombed in the opening days of the Battle of Britain, including one famous low-level raid by a group of Dornier Do 17s. A number of completed Stirlings were destroyed on the ground and the factories were heavily damaged, setting back production by almost a year. Some production was moved to Austin&#x27;s Longbridge factory at Cofton Hackett just south of Birmingham, the Longbridge production line eventually produced nearly 150 Stirlings.

From this point on, the Belfast factory became increasingly important, as it was thought to be well beyond the range of German bombers. However, Belfast and the aircraft factory were subjected to bombing by German aircraft during the Easter week of 1941. To meet the increased requirement for its aircraft during the war, satellite factories near Belfast were operated at Aldergrove and Maghaberry, producing 232 Stirlings between them. In 1940, bombing damaged Supermarine&#x27;s factory at Woolston and the incomplete Type 316 prototypes. In November 1940, development of the 316 was formally cancelled, leaving the Stirling as the only B.12/36 design.

The first few Stirling Mk.Is were furnished with Bristol Hercules II engines, but most were built with more powerful Hercules XI engines, instead.

===Proposed developments===
Even before the Stirling went into production, Short had improved on the initial design with the S.34 in an effort to meet specification B.1/39. It would have been powered by four Bristol Hercules 17 SM engines, optimised for high-altitude flight. The new design featured longer-span wings and a revised fuselage able to carry dorsal and ventral power-operated turrets each fitted with four 20 mm Hispano cannons; despite the obvious gains in performance and capability, the Air Ministry was not interested.

In 1941, it was decided that the Stirling would be manufactured in Canada and an initial contract for 140 aircraft was placed. Designated as the Stirling Mk.II, the Hercules engines were to be replaced by Wright GR-2600-A5B Twin Cyclone engines; a pair of prototypes was converted from Mk.I aircraft. However, it was decided to cancel the contract in favour of manufacturing other aircraft; thus, no production Mk.IIs was ever completed.

Shorts also pursued the development of the Stirling for potential use on the civilian market. Designated S.37, it was a full-furnished transport aircraft that was capable of seating 30 passengers and was constructed to conform with civilian standards. A single prototype, known as the &quot;Silver Stirling&quot;, was converted from a Mk.V aircraft; however, partially due to greater levels of interest being expressed for a more promising civilian version of the Handley-Page Halifax, the proposal met with little official interest.

In 1941, Short proposed the development of a new variant of the Stirling, the S.36, which was nicknamed the &quot;Super Stirling&quot; in a company publication. This aircraft would have featured a wing span of , four Bristol Centaurus radials and a maximum takeoff weight of . The projected performance estimates included a speed of and a range, along with a weapons load of over , or over . The defensive armament of the S.36 was to be an assortment of 10 .50 BMG machine guns that were set into three turrets.

The S.36 was initially accepted for testing under Specification B.8/41, which had been specifically written to cover the type, and an order for a pair of prototypes was placed. However, Arthur Harris, as commander of Bomber Command, felt that achieving bulk production of the type would take too much time and that the effort would be better expended on outfitting the existing design with improved Hercules engines with the aim of providing a higher operational altitude ceiling. While the Air Staff initially found the proposal to have some attraction, it was eventually decided to favour increased production rates of the rival Avro Lancaster, instead. In May 1942, Shorts were informed that the Air Ministry would not be continuing the project; in August 1942, Shorts decided to terminate all work.

==Design==
===Overview===

The Short Stirling was a four-engined monoplane heavy bomber designed to provide a previously unmatched level of strategic bombing capability to the Royal Air Force (RAF). It was powered by four Bristol Hercules radial engines which were spaced across its mid-mounted wing. The Stirling has the distinction of being the only British bomber of the period to see service that had been designed from the start with four engines - the Avro Lancaster was a re-engined, stretched-wingspan Avro Manchester while the Halifax was planned to be powered by twin Rolls-Royce Vulture engines but was similarly re-designed to use an arrangement of four Merlin engines in 1937.

Although smaller than both of the pre-war American &quot;XBLR&quot;-designation designs (the 149-foot wingspan, 35-ton Boeing XB-15 and the 212-foot wingspan, 79-ton Douglas XB-19) and nearly as large as contemporary Soviet experimental heavy bomber designs, the Stirling had considerably more power and far better payload/range than anything then flying from any British-based aviation firm. The massive 14,000 lb (6.25 long tons, 6,340 kg) bomb load put it in a class of its own, double that of any other bomber. It was longer and taller than its replacements the Handley Page Halifax and the Avro Lancaster but they were both originally designed to have twin engines.

===Crew accommodation===

Under typical operations, most variants of the Stirling were flown with a crew of seven, performing several different roles. It was flown by a pair of pilots, who were supported by a navigator/bomb aimer, a front gunner/wireless operator, two further gunners, and a flight engineer. The flight engineer and wireless operator were housed in a cabin just forward of the leading edge of the wing, and directly forward of them was the navigator&#x27;s station. The two pilots were contained within a fully glazed flight deck positioned level with the forward end of the bomb cells; the provision of a separate flight engineer&#x27;s station led to the cockpit having a relatively simple appearance in comparison with the majority of the RAF&#x27;s bombers.

The cockpit containing the flying officers was provided with numerous controls and features; to the left of the first pilot were the controls for the auto-pilot and a P.4 compass; the pilot was also provided with a beam approach indicator (to aid nighttime landings) and DF visual loop indicator in addition to the standard flight controls. Switches for the flaps and position indicators were located on a central panel set between the two pilots, while the master fuel cocks were set above these on the roof; throttle and mixture controls were also normally positioned between the pilots. Only limited engine instrumentation was provisioned for, such as engine speed indicators and boost gauges.

The navigator/bomb-aimer would perform the latter of these roles in a prone position within the aircraft&#x27;s nose. For bomb-aiming, a drift sight, camera, and steering control over the auto-pilot were provided; directly above this position was the front turret position of the bomber. Just aft of the wireless operator&#x27;s position, the centre section of the wing cut across the fuselage; the space above this was used for storing oxygen tanks while the space below was used as a rest bunk. Behind the rest area, the uninterrupted deck ran across the full length of the bomb cells to the location in which the retractable ventral turret was installed upon early production aircraft; the internal area aft of this position was used to store flame floats and reconnaissance flares, as well as an escape hatch, lavatory, rear turret position, and the crew entry door on the port side.

The Stirling was armed with nose and tail turrets (the latter was notable for the wide angles of fire) along with a single retractable ventral (&quot;dustbin&quot;) turret located just behind the bomb-bay. This proved almost useless due to cramped conditions, with the added distraction that the turret tended to drop and hit the ground when taxiing over bumps. The retractable turret was removed almost from the start and temporarily replaced by beam hatches mounting pairs of machine guns, until a twin-gun dorsal turret could be provided. This turret designated the FN.7A also had problems; it had a metal back fitted with an escape hatch which turned out to be almost impossible to use.

The Stirling Mk.III, introduced in 1943, was similar to the Mk.I with the exception of the improved Hercules VI or XVI engines, which improved maximum speed from . The Mk.III used a fully glazed dorsal turret (the same FN.50 as in Lancaster) that had more room and an improved view. Early Mk.III Stirlings were fitted with a 12.7 mm Browning machine gun in the rear escape hatch (behind a perspex shield) to ward off German night fighters using the Schräge Musik system. Later Stirlings were fitted with an improved, low-drag remotely-controlled FN.64 ventral turret or a H2S radar. Mk.III Stirlings also were fitted with electronic countermeasure systems such as ventral antennas for the Mandrel jamming system as well as a ventral &quot;window&quot; chaff chute to jam Freya and Würzburg radars. Mk.III Stirlings were also fitted with a ventral antenna for the Blind Approach Beacon System which was a blind-landing aid and a Monica rear warning radar in the tail turret.

=== Structure ===

The construction of the Stirling shares considerable similarity to the earlier Short Empire flying boats. The cantilever mid-mounted wing, which employed a two-spar structure covered by aluminium alloy sheeting that was flush-rivetted to the internal spars and ribs, was one instance of design similarity. The wing housed three large self-sealing fuel tanks within the spar truss, along with a fourth non-self-sealing fuel tank within the leading edge of the wing root, which provided for a combined tankage of 2,254 gallons. Up to six ferry tanks could also be installed within the wing bomb cells to add another 220 gallons. Significant attention was paid to reducing drag – all rivets were flush headed and panels joggled to avoid edges – but camouflage paint probably negated the benefit. The wing was fitted with Gouge flaps similar to those of the flying boats.

The fuselage of the Stirling was distinct from Short&#x27;s flying boat lineage, being constructed in four sections and employing continuous stringers throughout each section, as opposed to interruptions of the stringers at every frame as per established practice at Shorts. The four sections were joined using tension bolts through the webs of the end frames. The lower sides of the centre-section spar booms aligned with the main deck of the aircraft, which was supported upon the three longitudinal girders which formed the three parallel bomb cells. The bomb cells were sub-divided into 19-foot compartments sufficient to accommodate conventional 500 lb bombs or 2,000 lb armour-piercing bombs but nothing bigger.

Hydraulic power was used for various purposes throughout the Stirling. The nose and dorsal turrets were powered by a duplex pump driven by the inner port engine, while the dorsal turret was powered by a single pump driven by the inner starboard engine. Pulsations in the hydraulic lines were smoothed out by a series of recuperators; German fighter pilots soon learned that by shooting at the area around roundels painted on the fuselage, two of the three turrets could be disabled and the recuperators were moved in later models of the Stirling to reduce their vulnerability.

The first production model of the Stirling was powered by the Bristol Hercules II radial engine, which were housed in fully monocoque nacelles. Upon the availability of the improved Hercules XI engine, new welded steel-tube framework engine mountings were incorporated, further changes were implemented to the installation of the power units were subsequently made by Bristol. Hydraulic control of the throttle was a source of slow responsiveness and irritation and often proved dangerous during take-offs.

===Flying characteristics===
Pilot accounts generally report that, once airborne, the Short Stirling was a delight to fly, surprisingly manoeuvrable for such a large aircraft and without any vices. According to Norris, the Stirling was &quot;more manoeuvreable and responsive than any other aircraft in its class&quot;. The shortcomings of the aircraft in terms of lower ceiling and limited range are largely forgiven in pilot autobiographies. The Stirling did, however, exhibit some vicious flying characteristics during takeoff and landings.

As a class, the large and heavy four-engined tail-wheeled bombers such as the Stirling, Handley Page Halifax, Avro Lancaster and Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress could be a handful on takeoff and landing, more so for relatively young and inexperienced new pilots who formed the vast majority of the expanding Commonwealth and American air forces. Later heavy bomber designs such as the Consolidated B-24 Liberator and Boeing B-29 Superfortress used a nose-wheel (tricycle) configuration as did most successful four engined commercial aircraft in the post-war years. Tricycle geared aircraft are typically easier to control on takeoff, landing and during taxiing, and also make for easier cargo loading and servicing as the cabin, engines and other systems are closer to the ground. The long undercarriage of the Stirling was a result of a request by the RAF who sought to increase the wing incidence.

The Short Stirling had particularly challenging flying characteristics on takeoff and landing, even in comparison with other tail-wheeled contemporaries. After a series of serious accidents and total aircraft losses involving uncontrolled ground loops on takeoff, the Royal Air Force implemented a special training and certification programme for all prospective Stirling pilots. Proper takeoff technique involved feeding in right engine throttle during the initial 20 seconds of the takeoff run until the rudder became effective for control. If all four throttles were advanced simultaneously, the aircraft would swing to the right, become uncontrollable and often collapse the landing gear which could be disastrous if the aircraft was loaded with bombs and fuel.

On flare-out for landing, the Short Stirling exhibited a tendency to suddenly stall and &quot;drop like a stone&quot; to the runway. With such a heavy aircraft, a &quot;dropped&quot; landing could cause serious structural damage. During its service life, it was not unknown for &quot;dropped&quot; landings to render Stirlings or other large four-engined bombers write-offs and suitable only for parts.

==Operational history==
In July 1940, the first production Stirling departed Rochester; in August 1940, it was delivered to No. 7 Squadron at RAF Leeming, North Yorkshire. Following a four-month working-up period in which crews adapted to operating the type, the Stirling attained operational status in January 1941. On the night of 10/11 February 1941, the first operational combat mission was performed, flown by the first three Stirlings, against fuel storage tanks at Vlaardingen near Rotterdam, in the Netherlands, all but two bombers were deployed during the mission, which was considered to have run smoothly. By the end of 1941, more than 150 Stirlings had been completed and three RAF squadrons had been equipped with it. Stirlings flew on day and night bombing operations and had been found to be most capable of standing up to enemy interceptor aircraft by using a sweeping combination of fighters and bombers, in what was known as &quot;Circus&quot; operations.
From late 1941, the Stirling played a pioneering role in the formation of the RAF&#x27;s Pathfinder squadrons, specialist navigation and target-finding squadrons to assist Main Force squadrons. From the spring of 1942, the number of Stirlings in service began to increase. From May 1943, raids on Germany were often conducted using over a hundred Stirling bombers at a time. Stirlings were amongst the RAF bombers used during the first 1,000 bomber raid against Cologne. Norris observed that, by 1942, the type had &quot;given plenty of punishment to the Germans and was also proving that it could itself take punishment to an incredible extent&quot;. There were several incidents in which damaged aircraft, such as one Stirling which suffered a head-on collision with a Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter over Hamburg, were able to return to base.

Despite the &quot;disappointing performance&quot; at maximum altitude, Stirling pilots were delighted to discover that, due to the thick wing, they could out-turn the Junkers Ju 88 and Messerschmitt Bf 110 nightfighters they faced. Its handling was much better than that of the Halifax and some preferred it to the Lancaster. Based on its flight characteristics, Flt Lt Murray Peden (RCAF) of No. 214 Squadron RAF described the Stirling as &quot;one of the finest aircraft ever built&quot;. A consequence of the thick wing was a low ceiling; many missions were flown as low as . This was a disadvantage if crews were attacking Italy and had to fly &quot;through&quot; (rather than &quot;over&quot;) the Alps. When Stirlings were on operations with other RAF bombers which could fly higher, the Luftwaffe concentrated on the Stirlings. Within five months of being introduced, 67 out of 84 aircraft had been lost to enemy action or written off after crashes.

The Stirling&#x27;s maximum bomb load could be carried for only around . On typical missions deep into Germany or Italy, a smaller load was carried, consisting of seven GP bombs; this payload was in the range of that which was already being carried by the RAF&#x27;s medium bombers, such as the Vickers Wellington and by 1944, the de Havilland Mosquito. Perhaps the biggest weakness present in the design was that, although the bomb bay was large at , it had a pair of structural dividers that ran down the middle, limiting the bay to nothing larger than the bomb. As the RAF started using the &quot;cookies&quot; and even larger &quot;specials&quot;, the Stirling became less useful. The Handley-Page Halifax and especially the Avro Lancaster offered better performance and when these aircraft became available in greater numbers from 1943, the Stirlings were relegated to secondary tasks.

During the type&#x27;s service with Bomber Command, Stirlings flew a total of 14,500 sorties, during which 27,000 tons of bombs were dropped; 582 aircraft were lost in action while a further 119 were written off. By December 1943, Stirlings were being withdrawn from frontline service as bombers. The aircraft remained in service for minelaying operations in the vicinity of German ports (&quot;Gardening&quot;), electronic countermeasures, dropping spies deep behind enemy lines at night and towing gliders.

During 1943, it had been recognised that there would be a requirement for a force of powerful aircraft capable of towing heavy transport gliders, such as the General Aircraft Hamilcar and Airspeed Horsa, it was found that the Stirling would fit this role admirably. During late 1943, 143 Mk.III bombers were converted as the &quot;Stirling Mk.IV&quot;, with no nose or dorsal turrets, which was used for towing gliders and dropping paratroops, in addition to 461 Mk.IVs that were manufactured. These aircraft were used for the deployment of Allied ground forces during the Battle of Normandy and Operation Market Garden. On 6 June 1944, several Stirlings were also used in Operation Glimmer for the precision-laying of patterns of &quot;Window&quot; to produce radar images of a decoy invasion fleet.

In May 1944, No. 138 (Special Duties) Squadron acquired 22 Stirlings to support resistance groups organised by the Special Operations Executive in Europe. Standard &quot;C&quot; Type containers for weapons and other stores could be loaded into the bomb bay and dropped like a payload of bombs. The Stirling could carry 18 of these; a particularly large load. Smaller panniers or packages could be carried in the Stirling&#x27;s roomy rear fuselage and manually dropped through a hole in the floor by a despatcher. Experiments with a roller-based conveyor to drop these packages faster than a dispatcher were delayed until the end of the war by concerns that this would involve too rapid a change in the aircraft&#x27;s centre of gravity.

From late 1944, 160 of the special transport variant &quot;Stirling Mk V&quot; were built, which had the tail turret removed and a new nose opening added; most of these were completed after the war. By 1946, the Stirlings of Transport Command were being phased out and replaced by the Avro York, which was a transport derivative of the Lancaster that had previously replaced the Stirling in the bomber role. While many aircraft were scrapped, 12 Stirlings were modified to conform with S.37 standards and sold to Belgian charter operator Trans-Air in May 1947.

===Victoria Cross recipients===
In recognition of their deeds of valour, two Stirling pilots were posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). Both pilots held the rank of Flight Sergeant (Flt Sgt) and both were involved in bombing raids against Turin. Flt Sgt Rawdon Hume Middleton (RAAF) received his VC while serving as the captain of a Stirling from No. 149 Squadron RAF, during a raid in November 1942. Middleton was severely wounded and knocked unconscious by a direct hit from an AA shell. Upon regaining consciousness, Middleton insisted that Flt Sgt Leslie Hyder, the co-pilot, should dress his own wounds, while Middleton flew the badly damaged bomber. After it became clear that a crash was inevitable, Middleton ordered the rest of the crew to abandon the Stirling, while he maintained control. He was killed, along with the last two crew members to bail out. Acting Flt Sgt Arthur Louis Aaron, was awarded his VC as the captain of a No. 218 Squadron Stirling in a raid on Turin in August 1943. Aaron was badly wounded while piloting the aircraft and refused to rest, directing the flight engineer, who was acting as co-pilot, to fly to Rabah Bitat Airport (Bone Airfield), Algeria; he died following the aircraft&#x27;s safe landing.

===Service with other nations===
The Stirling is listed in the appendix to the novel &quot;KG 200&quot; as one flown by the German secret operations unit (KG 200), which tested, evaluated, and sometimes clandestinely operated captured enemy aircraft. Six Stirlings were purchased by the Egyptian Air Force for use in the 1948 Arab Israeli War, forming the 8th Bomber Squadron. These flew a number of air raids on Israeli targets in the 1948 war, one of their number being lost either as a result of an accident or sabotage. The remaining five appear to have been scrapped or retired by 1951.

== Surviving aircraft ==
Stirling &quot;BK716&quot; was recovered using a grapple between 31 August and 9 October 2020 from Markermeer, Netherlands, and parts of it are to be put on display.

Two sections of Stirlings have been displayed in museums. At the &quot;Musée du terrain d&#x27;aviation militaire&quot; in Vraux, France there are sections of the rear fuselage of Stirling &quot;LK142&quot;, a No. 196 Squadron RAF aircraft that crashed near Spincourt on 24 September 1944. 
The second section is at the Museum Vliegbasis in Deelen, Netherlands, and comes from No. 299 Squadron RAF Stirling &quot;LK545&quot; which crashed near Nijmegen on 23 September 1944. A piece of the fuselage was cut off and used as a pig sty on a farm in Beuningen until transferred to a museum in 2003.

In September 2019, 75 years after the liberation of the southern Netherlands, excavation started on Stirling &quot;W7630&quot; in Lilbosch Abbey near Pey, Echt, Netherlands, which crashed on 10 September 1942. The crew did not survive the crash and the excavation team expects remains to be found and anticipate the wreckage being buried into the ground. The excavation was delayed for many years as the aircraft was severely damaged on impact and it is unknown if unexploded bombs are present.

In 1986, the RAF Sub-Aqua Association investigated raising No. 196 Squadron RAF Stirling &quot;EF311&quot; which ditched offshore from Selsey Bill on 26 August 1943. After assessing the wreck, which lay at a depth of , the group decided against proceeding.

In 1994 the same group looked at the possibility of raising No.196 Squadron Stirling &quot;LJ925&quot;, which crashed on 25 February 1945 in Hølen Lake, near Arendal, Norway and which had been discovered at a depth of buried in mud and tree bark shavings. This plan was also abandoned, although the group recovered a propeller blade.

During preparations for the laying of the North Sea Link electrical cable in 2017, remains suspected to be of a Stirling were found in the North Sea between England and Norway.

In September 1977, wreckage of Stirling &quot;LK488&quot;, which crashed on Mickle Fell in the Pennines on 19 October 1944, was recovered by the RAF. In 2023, the tail section from &quot;LK488&quot; went on display at the Royal Air Force Museum London, while a fuselage section was placed on display at the Museum&#x27;s Cosford site.

In the absence of any complete surviving aircraft the &quot;Stirling Aircraft Project&quot; was setup in the late 1990s to make a recreation of the forward fuselage section of a Stirling, largely from new fabrication.

<text>Sir Philip Carteret, 2nd Baronet (c. 1650 – 1693), also known as Philippe de Carteret IV, was the 5th Seigneur of Sark from 1663 to 1693.

==Origins==
He was born in about 1650, the eldest son of Sir Philip Carteret, 1st Baronet (1620–1675) (Philippe de Carteret III), the 4th Seigneur of Sark, by his wife Anne des Augres (1566–1644), daughter of Abraham Dumaresq Seig des Augres. His father died before he came of age (aged 21) in 1671.

==Career==
As the Sark court refused to allow an Anglican to preside, in 1675 Philippe requested the British crown to dissolve the court, which having been achieved by an Order in Council in 1675, he instituted in its place a jurisdiction composed of a Seneschal, Greffier and Prevot.

==Marriage and issue==

Carteret married Elizabeth Carteret (1663–1717), a daughter of Sir Edward De Carteret, Seigneur De Trinity, Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod during the reign of King Charles II and First Gentleman Usher Daily Waiter in Ordinary to the King, by his wife Elizabeth Johnson.

By his wife he had one son:
*Sir Charles Carteret, 3rd Baronet (1679–1715), eldest son and heir, who died aged 34 and was the last in the male line of the senior line of the Carteret family. He was baptised at St Margaret&#x27;s Church, Westminster on 4 June 1679, when King Charles II was one of his godfathers. He was Gentleman of the Privy Chamber to Queen Anne and High Bailiff of Jersey. He married Mary Carteret, a daughter of Amias Carteret, by whom he had a son:
**James Carteret, who predeceased his father and died without surviving issue.

==Death==
Upon his death in 1693 Charles de Carteret, his eldest son, inherited his titles and lands.

==Monument to wife==
A monument to his wife Elizabeth Carteret (1663–1717) was in Westminster Abbey until 1847 when having become dilapidated it was removed (all but the inscription) by Lord John Thynne, Sub-Dean of the Abbey and representative of the Carteret family, who re-erected it at his country house of Haynes Park in Bedfordshire. The inscription (which still survives in Westminster Abbey) is as follows:
:&quot;Near this place lyeth buried Dame Elizabeth Carteret daughter of Sr. Edward Carteret, Knt., Gent. Usher of ye Black Rod in the reign of K. Charles the Second Relict of Sr. Philip Carteret Bart. and by him mother of Sr. Charles Carteret Bart., her only son, interred likewise near this place by whose decease June ye 6th A.D. 1715 in ye 34th year of his age, was extinguished the eldest branch of the antient family of the name of Carteret Seigneurs of St.Ouen in ye Island of Jersey. She died March ye 26th A.D.1717 aged 52 years&quot;.

<text>Marion Hugh &quot;Suge&quot; Knight Jr. ( ; born April 19, 1965) is an American record executive, former NFL player, and convicted felon, who is the co-founder and former CEO of Death Row Records. Knight was a central figure in gangsta rap&#x27;s commercial success in the 1990s. This feat is attributed to the record label&#x27;s first two album releases: Dr. Dre&#x27;s &quot;The Chronic&quot; in 1992 and Snoop Dogg&#x27;s &quot;Doggystyle&quot; in 1993. Knight is currently serving a 28-year sentence in prison for a fatal hit-and-run in 2015.

Before founding Death Row Records, Knight played college football at UNLV as a defensive end. He briefly played in the NFL for the Los Angeles Rams as a replacement player during the 1987 NFL players strike. In 1995, Tupac Shakur began serving a prison sentence of up to years for a sexual abuse conviction. Knight struck a deal with Shakur that October, posting his $1.4 million bail and freeing him from prison pending an appeal of his conviction, while signing him to Death Row Records. In 1996, the label released Shakur&#x27;s greatest commercial success, &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot;. That September, after departing a Mike Tyson boxing match in Las Vegas, a group that included Knight and Shakur assaulted Orlando Anderson, a Southside Compton Crips gang member. Three hours later, someone shot into the car Knight was driving, injuring Knight and fatally wounding Shakur.

Dr. Dre left Death Row Records shortly before Shakur&#x27;s death, followed by Snoop Dogg two years later. The label rapidly declined. Meanwhile, allegations mounted that Knight, beyond employing gang members, often used intimidation and violence in his business dealings. From the late 1990s to the early 2000s, Knight spent a few years incarcerated for assault convictions and associated violations of probation and parole.

In September 2018, Knight pled no contest to voluntary manslaughter in a fatal 2015 hit-and-run. Knight&#x27;s conviction, along with his previous felonies, triggered California&#x27;s three-strikes law. He was sentenced to 28 years in prison, and is eligible for parole in October 2034, when he will be 69 years old.

==Early life==
Knight was born in Compton, California, the son of Maxine (née Dikemen) and Marion Knight Sr. His name Suge (pronounced &quot;/ʃʊɡ/&quot;) derives from &quot;Sugar Bear&quot;, a childhood nickname. He attended Lynwood High School in nearby Lynwood, where he was a football and track star. He graduated in 1983.

Knight is affiliated with the Mob Piru Bloods, a set of the Bloods gang.

==Football career==
From 1983 to 1985, he attended and played football at El Camino College. In 1985, he transferred to the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and played football there for two years.

Knight went undrafted in the 1987 NFL draft, but was invited to the Los Angeles Rams training camp. He was cut by the Rams during camp, but became a replacement player during the 1987 NFL Players Strike, and played two games for the Rams.

==Career ==
After his brief NFL career, Knight found work as a concert promoter and a bodyguard for celebrities including Bobby Brown. In 1989, Knight formed his own music publishing company. His first big profit in the business came when Vanilla Ice agreed to sign over royalties from his smash hit &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot;, because the song included material allegedly written by Knight&#x27;s client Mario Johnson. Knight and his bodyguards confronted Vanilla Ice several times. There was a rumor that Knight entered Vanilla Ice&#x27;s hotel room and allegedly dangled him by his ankles off the balcony. However, Vanilla Ice has said that never happened, only that Knight threatened to throw him off the balcony; the claim was resolved in court.

Knight next formed an artist management company and signed West Coast hip hop artists DJ Quik and The D.O.C. Through the latter, he met several members of the seminal gangsta rap group N.W.A.

===Death Row Records===
Dr. Dre and The D.O.C. wanted to leave both N.W.A and their label, Ruthless Records, run by Eazy-E, another member of N.W.A. According to N.W.A&#x27;s manager Jerry Heller, Knight and his henchmen threatened Heller and Eazy-E with lead pipes and baseball bats to make them release Dre, The D.O.C., and Michel&#x27;le from their contracts in April 1991. Ultimately, Dre and D.O.C. co-founded Death Row Records in 1991 with Knight, who vowed to make it &quot;the Motown of the &#x27;90s&quot;.

Initially, Knight fulfilled his ambitions: he secured a distribution deal with Interscope, and Dre&#x27;s 1992 solo debut album, &quot;The Chronic&quot;, earned triple platinum status in the United States by the end of 1993. It also made a career for Dre&#x27;s protégé, Snoop Dogg, whose own debut album &quot;Doggystyle&quot; obtained a quadruple platinum certification in the United States in 1994.

Meanwhile, Death Row had begun a public feud with 2 Live Crew&#x27;s Luther Campbell. The following year, he opened a private, by-appointment-only nightclub in Las Vegas called Club 662, so named because the numbers spelled out &quot;MOB&quot; on telephone keypads, &quot;MOB&quot; standing for Member of Bloods. In 1995, he ran afoul of civil rights activist C. Delores Tucker&#x27;s campaign against gangsta rap, whose criticism of Death Row&#x27;s glamorization of the &quot;gangsta&quot; lifestyle may have helped scuttle a lucrative deal with Time Warner.

===Tupac Shakur, MC Hammer, Dr. Dre, and the Death Row Label===
Knight&#x27;s feud with East Coast entrepreneur Sean Combs (&quot;Puff Daddy&quot;) progressed when Knight insulted the Bad Boy label founder on air at the Source Awards in August 1995. Openly critical of Combs&#x27;s tendency of ad-libbing on his artists&#x27; songs and dancing in their videos, Knight announced to the audience, &quot;Anyone out there who wanna be a recording artist and wanna stay a star, and don&#x27;t have to worry about the executive producer trying to be all in the videos, all on the records, dancing, come to Death Row.&quot;

Conrad Tillard, then the Nation of Islam minister known as Conrad Muhammad, the Hip Hop Minister, counseled Combs during his ensuing feud with Knight, and also asked Knight to stop terrorizing Combs. Tillard also protected Combs, sending elite guards from his Mosque No. 7 to guard Combs, who was receiving death threats from gangsters connected to Knight.

The same year, Knight offered to post bail () for Tupac Shakur if the rapper agreed to sign with Death Row. Shakur agreed, setting the stage for his 1996 double album &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot; and &quot;The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory&quot;.

M.C. Hammer&#x27;s relationship with Suge Knight dates back to 1988. With the success of Hammer&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;The Funky Headhunter&quot; (featuring Tha Dogg Pound), Hammer signed with Death Row Records by 1995, along with Snoop Dogg and his close friend, Tupac. The label did not release the album of Hammer&#x27;s music (entitled &quot;Too Tight&quot;) while he had a career with them, although he did release versions of some tracks on his next album. However, Hammer did record tracks with Shakur and others, most notably the song &quot;Too Late Playa&quot; (along with Big Daddy Kane and Danny Boy). After the death of Shakur in 1996, Hammer left the record company. He later explained his concern about this circumstance in an interview on Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) since he was in Las Vegas with Tupac the night of his death. Hammer released 2Pac&#x27;s &quot;Unconditional Love&quot;, on his &quot;Family Affair&quot; album, in 1998. The friendships between Hammer (played by Romany Malco), Tupac (played by Lamont Bentley) and Suge (played by Anthony Norris) were depicted in the television film, &quot;Too Legit: The MC Hammer Story&quot; (airing on VH1 in 2001).

Dr. Dre, frustrated with the company&#x27;s increasingly thuggish reputation and Knight&#x27;s violent inclinations, left and formed his own label, Aftermath Entertainment, in March 1996.

===Murders of Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls: theories accusing Knight===

Though never charged by any prosecutor for any involvement, Suge Knight has been the subject of theories in popular culture about the murder of two well-known rap artists. Tupac Shakur was shot four times in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada on September 7, 1996, and died six days later on September 13. When Shakur&#x27;s East Coast rival, The Notorious B.I.G. (aka Biggie Smalls or Biggie), was murdered in a similar drive-by shooting in Los Angeles, California on March 9, 1997, speculation arose that Knight was involved and that Biggie&#x27;s death was a revenge killing. Former Death Row artists, including Snoop Dogg, also later accused Knight of being involved in Tupac&#x27;s murder.

Ex-detective Russell Poole conjectured that Knight had Tupac killed before he could part ways with Knight&#x27;s label and then conspired to kill Biggie to divert attention from himself in the Tupac case. The Biggie murder theory implicated Knight, a rogue cop, and a mortgage broker named Amir Muhammad (who was never a police suspect) along with the chief of police and the LAPD in a conspiracy to murder and cover up the murder of Biggie. The Biggie theory formed the basis of a lawsuit by his family, the Wallaces, against the city of Los Angeles. A key source for Poole&#x27;s theory was Kevin Hackie. Hackie had implicated Knight and David Mack. Hackie, a former Death Row associate, said that he had knowledge of involvement between Knight and Mack and other LAPD officers. His information was used by the Wallace family in their suit against the city of L.A. for Biggie&#x27;s death. But Hackie later told &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reporter Chuck Philips that the Wallace attorneys had altered his declarations. The suit brought by the Wallace family against the city of L.A. based on the Russell Poole theory was dismissed in 2010.

In 2005, Chuck Philips of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that another source for the theory of Biggie&#x27;s murder implicating Muhammad, Mack, Knight and the LAPD was a schizophrenic man known as &quot;Psycho Mike&quot; who later confessed to hearsay and memory lapses and falsely identifying Muhammad. John Cook of Brill&#x27;s Content noted that Philips&#x27;s article &quot;demolished&quot; the Poole-Sullvan theory of Biggie&#x27;s murder.

Around the same time, Philips wrote an &quot;L.A. Times&quot; two-part series entitled &quot;Who Killed Tupac Shakur?&quot; about the murder of Shakur and events surrounding it based on police affidavits, court documents and interviews.

The &quot;L.A. Times&quot; story indicated that &quot;the shooting was carried out by a Compton gang called the Southside Crips to avenge the beating of one of its members by Shakur a few hours earlier. Orlando Anderson, the Crip whom Shakur had attacked, fired the fatal shots. Las Vegas police discounted Anderson as a suspect after questioning him once briefly. He was later killed in what police said was an unrelated gang shooting.&quot; The article implicated East Coast music figures, including Biggie, Shakur&#x27;s nemesis at the time, alleging that he paid for the gun. Before their own deaths, Biggie, his family and Anderson denied any role in Shakur&#x27;s murder. Biggie&#x27;s family produced documents purporting to show that the rapper was in New York and New Jersey at the time. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the documents inconclusive stating:

The pages purport to be three computer printouts from Daddy&#x27;s House, indicating that Wallace was in the studio recording a song called &quot;Nasty Boy&quot; on the afternoon Shakur was shot. They indicate that Wallace &quot;wrote half the session,&quot; was &quot;In and out/sat around&quot; and &quot;laid down a ref,&quot; shorthand for a reference vocal, the equivalent of a first take. But nothing indicates when the documents were created. And Louis Alfred, the recording engineer listed on the sheets, said in an interview that he remembered recording the song with Wallace in a late-night session, not during the day. He could not recall the date of the session but said it was likely not the night Shakur was shot. &quot;We would have heard about it,&quot; Mr. Alfred said.

Mark Duvoisin, an editor at the &quot;L.A. Times&quot;, wrote in an opinion piece in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that Philips&#x27;s account had withstood attacks to its credibility.

However, the &quot;L.A. Times&quot; printed a full retraction of the two-part series and released Philips shortly thereafter during a wave of layoffs.

In &quot;Tupac Shakur: Before I Wake,&quot; a documentary by Tupac Shakur&#x27;s bodyguard, he and Cathy Scott, author of &quot;The Killing of Tupac Shakur&quot; and &quot;The Murder of Biggie Smalls&quot;, said that Knight would not have placed himself in the path of bullets he knew were coming. On her website &quot;Archived Letters&quot; Scott responds to a reader of her book stating that she felt there was never evidence to link Knight to Tupac&#x27;s murder. Scott also told &quot;CNN&quot;, &quot;That theory doesn&#x27;t even add up. &#x27;Open fire on my car, but try not to hit me?&#x27;&quot;

A 2006 law-enforcement task force probe into Biggie&#x27;s murder, which included then-LAPD Detective Greg Kading, included the murder of Shakur. In his 2011 self-published book, &quot;Murder Rap&quot;, Kading wrote that Duane &quot;Keefe D&quot; Davis, a member of the &quot;Crips&quot; street gang, gave a confession years later saying he rode in the car used in the Las Vegas shooting of Shakur. The Crips said they had been offered a million dollars by associates of Bad Boy records to kill Shakur. Kading, who named Sean Combs as having been involved in the conspiracy, also wrote that a bounty was offered for Suge Knight&#x27;s murder.

While in Las Vegas, Kading&#x27;s book stated, Davis and fellow Crips members crossed paths with a BMW carrying Knight and Shakur. The fatal shots were fired by Orlando &quot;Baby Lane&quot; Anderson, who sat on the side of the car closest to the BMW.

Kading alleged that Knight hired Wardell &quot;Poochie&quot; Fouse to kill Biggie, Sean Combs&#x27; most valuable star, whose murder was done following a party at the Peterson Automotive Museum. Poochie later survived a murder attempt in 2000, but was killed in 2003. Charges were never brought against Fouse or Knight and the task force disbanded for reasons of &quot;internal affairs&quot;.

After Shakur&#x27;s death and the release of &quot;Tha Doggfather&quot;, Snoop Dogg openly criticized Knight for the murder of Shakur and left the label in 1998. He signed with Master P&#x27;s No Limit Records and then forming his own record label, Doggystyle Records. In 2002, Snoop released the song &quot;Pimp Slapp&#x27;d&quot;, in which he repudiated Knight and Death Row. In 2006, Snoop again attacked Knight verbally. Knight responded, stating that Snoop was a &quot;police informer&quot; who &quot;never goes to jail&quot;.

=== Gang violence associated with Death Row Records ===

Knight, who was affiliated with the Mob Piru Bloods, hired members from this gang to work for Death Row Records. Knight also hired members of two other Blood sets, Fruit Town Piru and Lueders Park Piru. By the early 2000s, a rivalry developed between the Mob Piru and the Fruit Town Piru, which resulted in the deaths of several people from Knight&#x27;s inner circle.

===End of Death Row Records===
On April 4, 2006, Knight filed bankruptcy due to civil litigation against him in which Lydia Harris was said to have been cheated out of a 50% stake in Death Row Records. Under questioning by creditors, he denied having money tucked away in foreign countries or in an African company that deals in diamonds and gold. Bankruptcy documents filed showed Knight had no income from employment or operation of a business. According to financial records, his bank account contained just $11, and he owned clothing worth $1,000, furniture and appliances valued at $2,000, and jewelry worth $25,000. He also testified that the last time he had checked the label&#x27;s financial records was at least 10 years prior. Knight&#x27;s lawyer said that his client was still &quot;at the helm&quot; of Death Row and had been working on securing distribution deals for the label&#x27;s catalog. Harris told reporters she had received a $1 million payment but had not agreed to settle the matter. &quot;I&#x27;m telling you, I didn&#x27;t do a settlement for $1 million. That&#x27;s ridiculous. Let&#x27;s keep it real,&quot; she said.

On July 7, 2006, the federal judge, Ellen Carroll, ordered a bankruptcy trustee takeover of Suge Knight&#x27;s Death Row Records, saying the record label had undergone a gross amount of mismanagement.

He filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which allows a company to continue business operations while restructuring. Death Row was being operated by Neilson during the bankruptcy proceedings, while Knight oversaw his bankruptcy estate as a debtor in possession.

In June 2007, he placed his 7 bedroom, bathroom home in Malibu, California, on the market for $6.2 million as part of his &quot;financial makeover&quot;. The mansion was finally sold in December 2008 in bankruptcy court for $4.56 million.

In June 2008, Death Row Records was put up for auction in Bankruptcy Court. The winning bid went to New York-based company Global Music Group. Global Music Group failed to secure funding and the Death Row Records catalog eventually went to Wideawake Entertainment.

On January 25, 2009, an auction was held for everything found in the Death Row Records office after the company filed for bankruptcy, including some of Knight&#x27;s personal items. Of note was the Death Row Records electric chair which sold for $2,500. Some of Knight&#x27;s personal items appeared in an auction during the debut episode of A&amp;E&#x27;s &quot;Storage Wars&quot;, and a vault full of items (including a coat) was purchased by featured buyer Barry Weiss.

==Personal life==
On November 3, 1989, Knight married Sharitha Lee Golden in Las Vegas.

In October 2023, Suge Knight co-founded a podcast with Breakbeat Media.

==Personal and legal troubles==
===1995 convictions===
In a 1995 federal case, Knight pleaded no contest and was sentenced to five years&#x27; probation for assaulting two rappers in the summer of 1992 at a Hollywood recording studio.

===1996 probation violation leading to incarceration===
On October 22, 1996, Knight was sent to jail pending a hearing on the probation violation that happened on September 7, 1996, when Suge Knight and his Death Row entourage including Tupac Shakur attacked Orlando Anderson, a Crips gang member. Knight was then sentenced to nine years in prison on February 28, 1997, for the probation violation but was granted early release and was let out of FCI Sheridan on August 6, 2001.

===2003 conviction and incarceration===
In 2003, Knight was sent to prison again (for ten months) for violating parole when he struck a parking lot attendant. Death Row&#x27;s income rapidly declined during Knight&#x27;s recurrent incarceration.

===2006 dispute with Snoop===
In 2006, Knight was engaged in another dispute with former friend and ex-associate Snoop Dogg after Snoop insulted him in an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine.

===2008 altercation and gang accusations ===
In January 2008, it was stated by police that Knight was one of the members of the Mob Piru street gang in a crackdown by authorities in the city of Compton. On May 10, 2008, Knight was involved in an altercation involving a monetary dispute outside of a nightclub (&quot;Shag&quot;) in Hollywood. He was unconscious for three minutes. At the hospital, he did not cooperate with the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD).

===2008 bankruptcy===
As part of an October 30, 2008 bankruptcy claim, Knight also filed a lawsuit against Kanye West and his associates. The lawsuit concerns an August 2005 shooting at West&#x27;s pre-Video Music Awards party, where Knight was wounded by a gunshot to the upper leg.

===2009 altercation===
In February 2009, Knight was taken to Scottsdale Healthcare Osborn to be treated for facial injuries he received during an altercation at a private party in the W Scottsdale Hotel, where Knight was punched.

===2012 arrest===
On February 8, 2012, Knight was arrested in Las Vegas, after police found cannabis in his car and several warrants for prior traffic violations.

===2014 shooting===
On August 24, 2014, Knight was shot at a pre-Video Music Awards party hosted by Chris Brown at a West Hollywood Sunset Strip nightclub (&quot;1OAK&quot;). Although shot six times, he was able to walk from the venue to an ambulance. His injuries required surgery. Evidence from closed circuit television (CCTV) footage showed that Knight was the intended target of the shooting. Knight was released from the hospital on August 27. Friend Keith Middlebrook told the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; that Knight returned home with the intention to &quot;heal up in a few days and be stronger than ever&quot;.

Knight refused to cooperate with law enforcement on the matter. Party attendee Jeezy later said on &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; that he would have been shot had he not been pushed out of the way just prior to the shooting.

===Prosecution on charges of robbery (2014–2016)===
On October 29, 2014, Knight and comedian Katt Williams were both arrested and charged with second-degree robbery in connection with an alleged theft of a camera from a paparazzi photographer the previous month in Beverly Hills, California. While in jail, doctors found a blood clot in Knight&#x27;s lung. Both Knight and Williams pleaded not guilty to robbery. In 2016, the robbery trial was delayed until the resolution of the unrelated murder trial.

===Prosecution on charges of voluntary manslaughter (2015–2017)===

On January 29, 2015, Knight crashed his car into two men, killing Terry Carter (his friend and co-founder of Heavyweight Records), and fled the scene in Compton, California. The second victim, filmmaker Cle Sloan, suffered multiple fractures in his ankles and head injuries. Witnesses said Knight followed the men to a burger stand parking lot after an argument on the &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; film set, and that the collision looked intentional. Security footage video showed Knight running over both men. Knight said he acted in self-defense.

In March 2015, Knight was hospitalized after he told a judge that he was suffering from blindness and other complications. Knight fired attorneys handling his murder case and said he was receiving inadequate medical treatment while in custody. The same month, a court set bail for his release for . Knight collapsed in court shortly after the bail setting was announced. On April 16, 2015, Knight&#x27;s bail was reduced to . In July 2015, Knight&#x27;s lawyer said that Knight might have a brain tumor on the same day that Knight&#x27;s request for lower bail was refused. In January 2016, Knight changed counsel in his murder trial for a fourth time. In May 2016, three attorneys replaced the two hired earlier in the year. In July 2016, the judge denied Knight&#x27;s motion to reveal the identities of several key prosecution witnesses, citing Knight&#x27;s long history of violence. Knight became emotional after the ruling, stating that because of his health problems, he will die in jail. In March 2017, Knight was hospitalized after suffering from blood clots, a condition that had been affecting him for two and a half years by that time. Knight&#x27;s hospitalization delayed the trial to September 2018.

When September arrived, Knight pleaded no contest to voluntary manslaughter. The judge sentenced Knight to 28 years in prison: 22 years for running over the victim and 6 years because it was Knight&#x27;s third strike under California&#x27;s three-strikes law. As of March 2023, Knight is incarcerated at RJ Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego, and will not be eligible for parole until October 2034.

===Prosecution on charges of threatening death (2017)===
In February 2017, a grand jury indicted Knight on charges of &quot;threatening death or bodily injury&quot; for sending threatening text messages to F. Gary Gray, the director of &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;, c. August 8, 2014. Knight pleaded not guilty to the charge, and the charge was dropped as part of Knight&#x27;s plea agreement in the death of Terry Carter.

<text>is a 2001 action-adventure game developed and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 2. It was designed and directed by Fumito Ueda, who wanted to create a minimalist game based on a &quot;boy meets girl&quot; concept. Originally planned for the PlayStation, &quot;Ico&quot; took approximately four years to develop. The team employed a &quot;subtracting design&quot; approach to reduce elements of gameplay that interfered with the game&#x27;s setting and story in order to create a high level of immersion.

The player controls Ico, a boy born with horns, which his village considers a bad omen. After warriors lock him in an abandoned castle, he frees Yorda, the daughter of the castle&#x27;s Queen, who plans to use Yorda to extend her life. Ico must work with Yorda to escape the castle, protecting her from enemies, assisting her across puzzles and solving puzzles.

&quot;Ico&quot; introduced several design and technical elements that have influenced subsequent games, including a story told with minimal dialogue, bloom lighting, and key frame animation. Although not a commercial success, it was acclaimed for its art, original gameplay and story elements and received several awards, including &quot;Game of the Year&quot; nominations and three Game Developers Choice Awards. Considered a cult classic, it has been called one of the greatest video games ever made, and is often brought up in discussions about video games as an art form. It was rereleased in Europe in 2006 in conjunction with &quot;Shadow of the Colossus&quot;, the spiritual successor to &quot;Ico&quot;. A high-definition remaster of the game was released alongside &quot;Shadow of the Colossus&quot; for the PlayStation 3 in &quot;The Ico &amp; Shadow of the Colossus Collection&quot; in 2011.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Ico&quot; is primarily a three-dimensional platform game. The player controls Ico from a third-person perspective as he explores the castle and attempts to escape it with Yorda. The camera is fixed in each room or area but swivels to follow Ico or Yorda as they move; the player can also pan the view a small degree in other directions to observe more of the surroundings. The game includes many elements of platform games; for example, the player must have Ico jump, climb, push and pull objects, and perform other tasks such as solving puzzles in order to progress within the castle.

These actions are complicated by the fact that only Ico can carry out these actions; Yorda can jump only short distances and cannot climb over tall barriers. The player must use Ico so that he helps Yorda cross obstacles, such as by lifting her to a higher ledge, or by arranging the environment to allow Yorda to cross a larger gap herself. The player can tell Yorda to follow Ico, or to wait at a particular spot. The player can have Ico take Yorda&#x27;s hand and pull her along at a faster pace across the environment. Players are unable to progress in the game until they move Yorda to certain doors that only she can open.

Escaping the castle is made difficult by shadow creatures sent by the Queen. These creatures attempt to drag Yorda into black vortexes if Ico leaves her for any length of time, or if she is in certain areas of the castle. Ico can dispel these shadows using a stick or sword and pull Yorda free if she is drawn into a vortex. While the shadow creatures cannot harm Ico, the game is over if Yorda becomes fully engulfed in a vortex; the player restarts from a save point. The player will also restart from a save point if Ico falls from a large height. Save points in the game are represented by stone benches that Ico and Yorda rest on as the player saves the game. In European and Japanese releases, upon completion of the game, the player has the opportunity to restart the game in a local co-operative two-player mode, where the second player plays as Yorda, still under the same limitations as the computer-controlled version of the character.
==Plot==
, a horned boy, is taken by a group of warriors to an abandoned castle and locked inside a stone coffin to be sacrificed. A tremor topples the coffin and Ico escapes. As he searches the castle, he comes across , a captive girl who speaks a different language. Ico helps Yorda escape and defends her from shadow-like creatures. The pair makes their way through the castle and arrive at the bridge leading to land. As they cross, the Queen, ruler of the castle, appears and tells Yorda that as her daughter she cannot leave the castle. Later, as they try to escape on the bridge, it splits up and they get separated. Yorda tries to save Ico but the Queen prevents it. He ends up falling off the bridge and losing consciousness.

Ico awakens below the castle and makes his way back to the upper levels, finding a magic sword that dispels the shadow creatures. After discovering that Yorda has been turned to stone by the Queen, he confronts the Queen in her throne room, who reveals that she plans to restart her life anew by taking possession of Yorda&#x27;s body. Ico slays the Queen with the magic sword, but his horns are broken in the fight and at the end of it he is knocked unconscious. With the Queen&#x27;s death the castle begins to collapse around Ico, but the Queen&#x27;s spell on Yorda is broken, and a shadowy Yorda carries Ico safely out of the castle to a boat, sending him to drift to the shore alone. Her final phrase &quot;Nonomori&quot; (the only dialogue not translated in the game) is spoken by her to Ico as he drifts away from the castle.

Ico awakens on a beach shore to find the distant castle in ruins, and Yorda, in her human form, washed up nearby. She wakes up and smiles at Ico.

== Development ==
Lead designer Fumito Ueda came up with the concept for &quot;Ico&quot; in 1997, envisioning a &quot;boy meets girl&quot; story where the two main characters would hold hands during their adventure, forming a bond between them without communication. Ueda&#x27;s original inspiration for &quot;Ico&quot; was a TV commercial he saw, of a woman holding the hand of a child while walking through the woods, and the manga series &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot;, where a woman is a guardian for the young hero as they adventure through the galaxy, which he thought about adapting into a new idea for video games. He also cited his work as an animator on Kenji Eno&#x27;s Sega Saturn game &quot;Enemy Zero&quot;, which influenced the animation work, cinematic cutscenes, lighting effects, sound design, and mature appeal. Ueda was also inspired by the video game &quot;Another World&quot; (&quot;Outer World&quot; in Japan), which used cinematic cutscenes, lacked any head-up display elements as to play like a movie, and also featured an emotional connection between two characters despite the use of minimal dialog. He also cited Sega Mega Drive games, &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;, &quot;Lemmings&quot;, &quot;Flashback&quot; and the original &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; games as influences, specifically regarding animation and gameplay style. With the help of an assistant, Ueda created an animation in Lightwave to get a feel for the final game and to better convey his vision. In the three-minute demonstration reel, Yorda had the horns instead of Ico, and flying robotic creatures were seen firing weapons to destroy the castle. Ueda stated that having this movie that represented his vision helped to keep the team on track for the long development process, and he reused this technique for the development of &quot;Shadow of the Colossus&quot;, the team&#x27;s next effort.

Ueda, at the time an employee at Sony Computer Entertainment Japan, began working with producer Kenji Kaido in 1998 to develop the idea and bring the game to the PlayStation. He was granted his own unit as the studio primarily assisted on games from other Japanese developers, with notable exceptions including the &quot;Ape Escape&quot; series. &quot;Ico&quot; design aesthetics were guided by three key notions: to make a game that would be different from others in the genre, feature an aesthetic style that would be consistently artistic, and play out in an imaginary yet realistic setting. This was achieved through the use of &quot;subtracting design&quot;; they removed elements from the game which interfered with the game&#x27;s reality. This included removing any form of interface elements, keeping the gameplay focused only on the escape from the castle, and reducing the number of types of enemies in the game to a single foe. An interim design of the game shows Ico and Yorda facing horned warriors similar to those who take Ico to the castle. The game originally focused on Ico&#x27;s attempt to return Yorda to her room in the castle after she was kidnapped by these warriors. Ueda believed this version had too much detail for the graphics engine they had developed, and as part of the &quot;subtracting design&quot;, replaced the warriors with the shadow creatures. Ueda also brought in a number of people outside the video game industry to help with development. These consisted of two programmers, four artists, and one designer in addition to Ueda and Kaido. On reflection, Ueda noted that the subtracting design may have taken too much out of the game, and did not go to as great an extreme with &quot;Shadow of the Colossus&quot;.

After two years of development, the team ran into limitations on PlayStation hardware and faced a critical choice: either terminate the project altogether, alter their vision to fit the constraints of the hardware, or continue to explore more options. The team decided to remain true to Ueda&#x27;s vision, and began to use the Emotion Engine of the PlayStation 2, taking advantage of the improved abilities of the platform. Character animation was accomplished through key frame animation instead of the more common motion capture technique. The game took about four years to develop. Ueda purposely left the ending vague, not stating whether Yorda was alive, whether she would travel with Ico, or if it was simply the protagonist&#x27;s dream.

&quot;Ico&quot; uses minimal dialogue in a fictional language to provide the story throughout the game. Voice actors included Kazuhiro Shindō as Ico, Rieko Takahashi as Yorda, and Misa Watanabe as the Queen. Ico and the Queen&#x27;s words are presented in either English or Japanese subtitles depending on the release region, but Yorda&#x27;s speech is presented in a symbolic language. Ueda opted not to provide the translation for Yorda&#x27;s words as it would have overcome the language barrier between Ico and Yorda, and detracted from the &quot;holding hands&quot; concept of the game. In the non-North American releases, playing through the game again after completing the game replaces the symbolic text with appropriate language subtitles.

== Release ==
The game was released in Japan on December 6, 2001 alongside &quot;Yoake no Mariko&quot;, developed by another unit of Sony as a collaboration with Spümcø. The North American version was released two months earlier; due to time constraints caused by Sony&#x27;s planned release date, it lacks the cover art intended by Ueda as well as additional features such as the two-player mode. Ueda drew a cover inspired by the Italian artist Giorgio de Chirico and his work &quot;The Nostalgia of the Infinite&quot;; it was used for the releases in Japan and PAL regions as Ueda was able to complete it for those regions&#x27; release dates. Ueda believed that &quot;the surrealistic world of de Chirico matched the allegoric world of &quot;Ico&quot;&quot;. Since release, the North American cover has been considered one of the worst pieces of cover art for video games in contrast to the game&#x27;s quality. On reflection, Yasuhide Kobayashi, vice-president of Sony&#x27;s Japan division, believed the North American box art and lack of an identifiable English title led to the game&#x27;s poor sales in the United States, and stated plans to correct that for the release of &quot;The Last Guardian&quot;. For its original release, a limited edition of the game was available in PAL regions that included a cardboard wrapping displaying artwork from the game and four art cards inside the box. The game was re-released as a standard edition in 2006 across all PAL regions except France after the 2005 release of &quot;Shadow of the Colossus&quot;, &quot;Ico&quot; spiritual sequel, to allow players to &quot;fill the gap in their collection&quot;.

==Other media==
=== Soundtrack ===

&quot;Ico&quot; audio featured a limited amount of music and sound effects. The soundtrack, , was composed by Michiru Oshima and sound unit &quot;pentagon&quot; (Koichi Yamazaki &amp; Mitsukuni Murayama) and released in Japan by Sony Music Entertainment on February 20, 2002. The album was distributed by Sony Music Entertainment Visual Works. The last song of the CD, &quot;ICO -You Were There-&quot;, includes vocals sung by former Libera member Steven Geraghty.

===Novelization===
A novelization of the game titled was released in Japan in 2004. Author Miyuki Miyabe wrote the novel because of her appreciation of the game. A Korean translation of the novel, entitled 이코 – 안개의 성 (&quot;I-ko: An-gae-eui Seong&quot;) came out the following year, by Hwangmae Publishers, while an English translation was published by Viz Media on August 16, 2011.

===Cross title content===
On June 11th, 2009, costumes (including Ico and Yorda), stickers, and sound effects from &quot;Ico&quot; were released as part of a paid downloadable add-on pack for the game &quot;LittleBigPlanet&quot;, titled &quot;Team Ico&quot;, which was available for download as DLC on the PlayStation Network store alongside similar materials from &quot;Shadow of the Colossus&quot;, after being teased by the game&#x27;s developers Media Molecule about two weeks prior. Ico makes a cameo appearance in &quot;Astro&#x27;s Playroom&quot;

===Film===
In 2010, Misher Films said that a film adaption of &quot;Ico&quot; may come about based on the success of their then-planned adaptation of &quot;Shadow of the Colossus&quot;. 

== Reception ==
&quot;Ico&quot; received critical acclaim, becoming a cult hit among players. The game has an aggregated review score of 90 out of 100 at Metacritic. In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine gave the PlayStation2 version a score of 30 out of 40. The game is considered by some to be one of the greatest games of all time; &quot;Edge&quot; ranked &quot;Ico&quot; as the 13th top game in a 2007 listing, while &quot;IGN&quot; ranked the game at number 18 in 2005, and at number 57 in 2007. &quot;Ico&quot; has been used as an example of a game that is a work of art. Ueda commented that he purposely tried to distance &quot;Ico&quot; from conventional video games due to the negative image video games were receiving at that time, in order to draw more people to the title.

Some reviewers have likened &quot;Ico&quot; to older, simpler adventure games such as &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; or &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;, that seek to evoke an emotional experience from the player; &quot;IGN&quot; David Smith commented that while simple, as an experience the game was &quot;near indescribable.&quot; The game&#x27;s graphics and sound contributed strongly to the positive reactions from critics; Smith continues that &quot;The visuals, sound, and original puzzle design come together to make something that is almost, if not quite, completely unlike anything else on the market, and feels wonderful because of it.&quot; Many reviewers were impressed with the expansiveness and the details given to the environments, the animation used for the main characters despite their low polygon count, and the use of lighting effects. &quot;Ico&quot; ambiance, created by the simple music and the small attention to detail in the voice work of the main characters, were also called out as strong points for the game. Charles Herold of &quot;The New York Times&quot; summed up his review stating that &quot;Ico is not a perfect game, but it is a game of perfect moments.&quot; Herold later commented that &quot;Ico&quot; breaks the mold of games that usually involve companions. In most games these companions are invulnerable and players will generally not concern with the non-playable characters&#x27; fate, but &quot;Ico&quot; creates the sense of &quot;trust and childish fragility&quot; around Yorda, which leads to the character being &quot;the game&#x27;s entire focus&quot;.

The game is noted for its simple combat system that would &quot;disappoint those craving sheer mechanical depth&quot;, as stated by &quot;GameSpot&quot; Miguel Lopez. The game&#x27;s puzzle design has been praised for creating a rewarding experience for players who work through challenges on their own; Kristen Reed of &quot;Eurogamer&quot;, for example, said that &quot;you quietly, logically, willingly proceed, and the illusion is perfect: the game never tells you what to do, even though the game is always telling you what to do&quot;. &quot;Ico&quot; is also considered a short game, taking between seven and ten hours for a single play through, which &quot;GameRevolution&quot; calls &quot;painfully short&quot; with &quot;no replay outside of self-imposed challenges&quot;. G4TV&#x27;s Matthew Keil, however, felt that &quot;the game is so strong, many will finish &#x27;Ico&#x27; in one or two sittings&quot;. The lack of features in the North American release, which would become unlocked on subsequent playthroughs after completing the game, was said to reduce the replay value of the title. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; notes that &quot;Yorda would probably be the worst companion -she&#x27;s scatterbrained and helpless; if not for the fact that the player develops a bond with her, making the game&#x27;s ending all the more heartrending.&quot;

Francesca Reyes reviewed the game for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that &quot;Intensely involving and wonderfully simple, &quot;Ico&quot;, though flawed, deserves to find its niche as a quiet classic.&quot;

Despite the positive praise, the original title did not sell well. By 2009, only 700,000 copies were sold worldwide, with 270,000 in the United States, and the bulk in PAL regions. Ueda considered his design by subtraction approach may have hurt the marketing of the game, as at the time of the game&#x27;s release, promotion of video games were primarily done through screenshots, and as &quot;Ico&quot; lacked any heads-up display, it appeared uninteresting to potential buyers.

=== Awards ===
&quot;Ico&quot; received several acclamations from the video game press, and was considered to be one of the Games of the Year by many publications, despite competing with releases such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot;, and &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;. The game received three Game Developers Choice Awards in 2002, including &quot;Excellence in Level Design&quot;, &quot;Excellence in Visual Arts&quot;, and &quot;Game Innovation Spotlight&quot;. The game won two Interactive Achievement Awards from the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences in 2002 for outstanding achievement in &quot;Art Direction&quot; and &quot;Character or Story Development&quot;; it also received nominations for &quot;Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Console Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Console Action/Adventure Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Innovation in Console Gaming&quot;, and outstanding achievement in &quot;Game Design&quot; and &quot;Sound Design&quot;. It won &quot;GameSpot&quot; annual &quot;Best Graphics, Artistic&quot; prize among console games. It was one of three titles to win the Special Award at the sixth CESA Game Awards.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Ico&quot; influenced numerous other video games, which borrowed from its simple and visual design ideals. Several game designers, such as Eiji Aonuma, Hideo Kojima, and Jordan Mechner, have cited &quot;Ico&quot; as having influenced the visual appearance of their games, including &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess&quot;, &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater&quot;, and &quot;Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time&quot;, respectively. Marc Laidlaw, scriptwriter for the &quot;Half-Life&quot; series, commented that, among several other more memorable moments in the game, the point where Yorda attempts to save Ico from falling off the damaged bridge was &quot;a significant event not only for that game, but for the art of game design&quot;. The Naughty Dog team used &quot;Ico&quot; as part of the inspiration for developing &quot;Uncharted 3&quot;. Vander Caballero credits &quot;Ico&quot; for inspiring the gameplay of &quot;Papo &amp; Yo&quot;. Phil Fish used the design by subtraction approach in developing the title &quot;Fez&quot;. The developers of both &quot;&quot; and &quot;Rime&quot; have &quot;Ico&quot; as a core influence on their design. Hidetaka Miyazaki, creator and director of the &quot;Dark Souls&quot; series, cited &quot;Ico&quot; as a key influence to him becoming involved in developing video games, stating that &quot;Ico&quot; &quot;awoke me to the possibilities of the medium&quot;. Goichi Suda aka Suda51, said that &quot;Ico&quot; save game method, where the player has Ico and Yorda sit on a bench to save the game, inspired the save game method in &quot;No More Heroes&quot; where the player-character sits on a toilet to save the game.

&quot;Ico&quot; was one of the first video games to use a bloom lighting effect, which later became a popular effect in video games. Patrice Désilets, creator of Ubisoft games such as &quot;Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time&quot; and &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot;, cited &quot;Ico&quot; as an influence on the game design of &quot;The Sands of Time&quot;. Jenova Chen, creator of art games such as &quot;Flower&quot; and &quot;Journey&quot;, cited &quot;Ico&quot; as one of his biggest influences. &quot;Ico&quot; was also cited as an influence by &quot;Halo 4&quot; creative director Josh Holmes. Naughty Dog said &quot;The Last of Us&quot; was influenced by &quot;Ico&quot;, particularly in terms of character building and interaction, and Neil Druckmann credited the gameplay of &quot;Ico&quot; as a key inspiration when he began developing the story of &quot;The Last of Us&quot;.

Film director Guillermo del Toro cited both &quot;Ico&quot; and &quot;Shadow of the Colossus&quot; as &quot;masterpieces&quot; and part of his directorial influence. Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead considers it one of his top ten video games of all time, saying it &quot;might be the best one&quot;.

=== Other Team Ico games ===
&quot;Shadow of the Colossus&quot; was developed by the same team and released for the PlayStation 2 in 2005. The game features similar graphics, gameplay, and storytelling elements as &quot;Ico&quot;. The game was referred by its working title &quot;Nico&quot; (&quot;Ni&quot; being Japanese for the number 2&quot;) until the final title was revealed. Ueda, when asked about the connection between the two games, stated that &quot;Shadow of the Colossus&quot; is a prequel to &quot;Ico&quot;.

The team&#x27;s third game, &quot;The Last Guardian&quot;, was announced for the PlayStation 3 at E3 2009. The game centers on the connection between a young boy and a large griffin-like creature that he befriends, requiring the player to cooperate with the creature to solve the game&#x27;s puzzles. The game fell into development hell due to hardware limitations and the departure of Ueda from Sony around 2012, along with other Team Ico members, though Ueda and the other members continued to work on the game via consulting contracts. Development subsequently switched to the PlayStation 4 in 2012, and the game was reannounced in 2015 and released in December 2016. Ueda has said that &quot;the essence of the game is rather close to &quot;Ico&quot;&quot;.

===HD remaster===

&quot;Ico&quot;, along with &quot;Shadow of the Colossus&quot;, received a high-definition remaster for the PlayStation3 that was released worldwide in September 2011. In addition to improved graphics, the games were updated to include support for stereoscopic 3D and PlayStation Trophies. The &quot;Ico&quot; port was also based on the European version, and includes features such as Yorda&#x27;s translation and the two-player mode. In North America and Europe/PAL regions, the two games were released as a single retail collection, while in Japan, they were released as separate titles. Both games have since been released separately as downloadable titles on the PlayStation Network store. Patch 1.01 for the digital high-definition &quot;Ico&quot; version added the Remote Play feature, allowing the game to be played on the PlayStation Vita.

<text>Helier de Carteret (fl. 1563 – 1578) was the first Seigneur of Sark, reigning from 1563 to 1578. He was the son of Édouard de Carteret, Seigneur of Saint Ouen (d. 1533), and grandson of Philip de Carteret, 8th Seigneur of St Ouen.

It was Helier&#x27;s idea and initiative to re-cultivate the deserted island in 1563, and in 1565 he was rewarded by Queen Elizabeth I with Letters Patent granting him the fief. He was also Seigneur of Saint Ouen in Jersey.

He married his cousin, Margaret de Carteret. She was the widow of Clement Dumaresq and daughter of the bailiff Helier de Carteret, the uncle and namesake to the Seigneur of Sark. Hellier and Margaret&#x27;s son was Philippe de Carteret I.

<text>Anthony George Franciosa (né Papaleo; October 25, 1928 – January 19, 2006) was an American actor most often billed as Tony Franciosa at the height of his career. He began his career on stage and made a breakthrough portraying the brother of the drug addict in the play &quot;A Hatful of Rain&quot;, which earned him a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play. He reprised his role in its subsequent film adaptation, for which he won the 1957 Venice Film Festival Award for Best Actor, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. 

After relocating to Hollywood he made numerous feature films, including &quot;A Face in the Crowd&quot; (1957), &quot;The Long, Hot Summer&quot; (1958), and &quot;Career&quot; (1959), for which he won the Golden Globe for Best Actor. In television, he played lead roles in five television series: the sitcom &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot; (1964–65), drama &quot;The Name of the Game&quot; (1968–71), &quot;Search&quot; (1972–73), &quot;Matt Helm&quot; (1975), and &quot;Finder of Lost Loves&quot; (1984). Later in his career, he acted primarily in Europe, starring in the erotic drama &quot;The Cricket&quot; (1980) and Dario Argento&#x27;s giallo &quot;Tenebrae&quot; (1982).

==Early life==
He was born in the Little Italy district of New York to an Italian-American family. His grandparents emigrated from Melfi, Basilicata, in the center of the boot of Southern Italy, in 1890. His parents separated when he was one and he was raised by his mother and aunt, adopting his mother&#x27;s maiden name Franciosa.

After high school he worked as a welder, ship steward and cook. At the age of 18 he was doing free dancing lessons at the YMCA, where he was offered a role in a production of &quot;The Seagull&quot;, and the experience made him want to be an actor.

==Career==
===Theatre===
Franciosa studied privately for two years with Joseph Geigler. He got a four-year scholarship at the Dramatic Workshop which led to the New York Repertory Theatre.

In 1948, Franciosa joined the Cherry Lane Theatre Group off Broadway (at the same time as actress Bea Arthur). Within two years, he had been accepted as a member of the Actors Studio, which would prove an invaluable resource throughout his career but it would be a few years more before Franciosa could make a living from acting. In the meantime, he accepted a variety of jobs which included being a waiter, dishwasher, day laborer, and messenger boy at CBD. He worked in Theatre of the Sky on Lake Tahoe. In 1950 he was in a San Francisco production of &quot;Detective Story&quot;.

In 1953, Franciosa made his Broadway debut in &quot;End as a Man&quot; alongside Ben Gazzara, and the following year in &quot;Wedding Breakfast&quot; (1954).

Franciosa began guest starring on TV shows such as &quot;Studio One in Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Kraft Theatre&quot;, &quot;Ford Star Jubilee&quot; (an adaptation of &quot;This Happy Breed&quot; with Noël Coward), and &quot;Goodyear Playhouse&quot;.

===&quot;A Hatful of Rain&quot;===
Franciosa&#x27;s breakthrough role came when cast in the Actors Studio production of &quot;A Hatful of Rain&quot; (1955–56) under the direction of Elia Kazan. He played Polo, the brother of the drug addicted Johnny (Ben Gazzara). Shelley Winters played Johnny&#x27;s wife and she would marry Franciosa the following year. Franciosa was nominated for a Tony Award for his performance.

Franciosa made his film debut in Elia Kazan&#x27;s &quot;A Face in the Crowd&quot; (1957) alongside Andy Griffith, Patricia Neal, and Lee Remick. He followed it in MGM&#x27;s &quot;This Could Be the Night&quot; (1957) as the romantic interest for Jean Simmons, under the direction of Robert Wise.

Franciosa reprised his role in &quot;A Hatful of Rain&quot; in the film version, directed by Fred Zinnemann at 20th Century Fox, with Don Murray and Eva Marie Saint playing the roles originated by Gazzara and Winters. Hedda Hopper pointed out that these three films were made before the first one had been released.
Franciosa&#x27;s performance in &quot;Hatful of Rain&quot; earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor.

===Film star===
Franciosa supported Anna Magnani and Anthony Quinn in &quot;Wild Is the Wind&quot; (1957) directed by George Cukor, produced by Hal B. Wallis who put Franciosa under a multi-film contract.

He then appeared with Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward in &quot;The Long Hot Summer&quot; (1958), playing Jody Varner. one of the two children of Will Varner (Orson Welles), directed by Martin Ritt at Fox.

In December 1957, he spent 10 days in jail for hitting a press photographer in April of that year. However he was much in demand: In an interview in December, he said he owed Fox and MGM three films each over five years, Kazan two more films, and Wallis one film a year over seven years.

He played Francisco Goya in MGM&#x27;s &quot;The Naked Maja&quot; (1958) with Ava Gardner, which earned Franciosa $250,000 in acting fees due to production delays. He made a second film for Wallis, &quot;Career&quot; (1959) with Dean Martin and Shirley MacLaine, then &quot;The Story on Page One&quot; (1959) with Rita Hayworth for Clifford Odets at Fox.

He was meant to star in &quot;Orpheus Descending&quot; (which became &quot;The Fugitive Kind&quot;) with Anna Magnani, but the producers decided to cast Marlon Brando, and Franciosa was paid out $75,000. He was mentioned as a possibility for one of the roles in &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; and for the title role in a proposed Simon Bolivar biopic that Dino De Laurentiis was going to make.

In 1959, he served 30 days at an open-prison farm for possession of marijuana. The same year, he was in a car accident.

Franciosa returned to TV to appear in &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; an adaptation of &quot;Here Comes Mr Jordan&quot; (1960), then in &quot;Cradle Song&quot; (1960).

He supported Gina Lollobrigida in MGM&#x27;s &quot;Go Naked in the World&quot; (1961), which lost money. He was top-billed in the Italian &quot;Careless&quot; (1962) with Claudia Cardinale and MGM&#x27;s &quot;Period of Adjustment&quot; (1962) with Jane Fonda, Franciosa&#x27;s first film for that studio which made a profit. In August 1963, he addressed a civil rights rally in Alabama alongside Marlon Brando and Paul Newman.

===Television===

Franciosa guest starred on &quot;The DuPont Show of the Week&quot;, &quot;Arrest and Trial&quot;, &quot;Breaking Point&quot;, &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot;, and &quot;Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre&quot;. He had supporting parts in two films for Fox: &quot;Rio Conchos&quot; (1964) with Stuart Whitman and Richard Boone, and &quot;The Pleasure Seekers&quot; (1964) with Ann-Margret and Carol Lynley.

He starred in a TV series &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot; (1964–65). When that ended he had support parts in &quot;A Man Could Get Killed&quot; (1966) with James Garner and &quot;Assault on a Queen&quot; (1966) with Frank Sinatra. He was leading man to Ann-Margret in &quot;The Swinger&quot; (1966) at Paramount and Raquel Welch in &quot;Fathom&quot; (1967) at Fox.

In a 1966 interview he confessed that Hollywood stardom had come a little too early: &quot;It was an incredible amount of attention, and I wasn&#x27;t quite mature enough psychologically or emotionally for it.&quot;

He starred in a phenomenally highly rated TV movie, billed on countless lead-up commercials as the first movie made for television, Universal&#x27;s &quot;Fame Is the Name of the Game&quot; (1966), then a spaghetti Western at Universal, &quot;A Man Called Gannon&quot; (1968), a drama with Jacqueline Bisset at Fox, &quot;The Sweet Ride&quot; (1968), and a war film at Universal, &quot;In Enemy Country&quot; (1968).

Producer David Dortort was on the verge of casting him as Cameron Mitchell&#x27;s best friend and brother-in-law, Manolito Montoya, on the western, &quot;The High Chaparral&quot;, if Henry Darrow did not make it to the set in time. Darrow did.

Tony Franciosa returned to regular series with &quot;The Name of the Game&quot; (1968–71) (based on &quot;Fame Is the Name of the Game&quot;), as lead role of charismatic but doggedly determined star reporter Jeff Dillon, alternating the regular lead spot with Gene Barry and Robert Stack. The three leading actors were never onscreen at the same time at any point in the series. He was fired from the show in 1970 because of his temper.

He was in &quot;Web of the Spider&quot; (1971), an Italian horror film, then a series of TV movies: &quot;The Deadly Hunt&quot; (1971), &quot;Earth II&quot; (1971), and &quot;The Catcher&quot; (1972). He had a support part in the action film &quot;Across 110th Street&quot; (1972).

Franciosa had a further alternating lead role in a TV series, this time rotating with Hugh O&#x27;Brian and Doug McClure, as agent Nick Bianco in &quot;Search&quot; (1972). When that ended he supported Peter Sellers in &quot;Ghost in the Noonday Sun&quot; (1973), then had support roles in &quot;This Is the West That Was&quot; (1974) for TV and &quot;The Drowning Pool&quot; (1975) with Paul Newman.

He had his own series with &quot;Matt Helm&quot; (1975), a television version of the spy-spoof theatrical films that starred Dean Martin, but it only lasted 14 episodes.

He was in &quot;Curse of the Black Widow&quot; (1977), a television miniseries &quot;Aspen&quot; (1977) with Sam Elliott, &quot;Wheels&quot; (1978), &quot;Firepower&quot; (1979), &quot;The World Is Full of Married Men&quot; (1979), &quot;The Cricket&quot; (1980), &quot;Help Me to Dream&quot; (1981), an episode of &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot;, &quot;Side Show&quot; (1981), &quot;Death Wish II&quot; (1982), &quot;Kiss My Grits&quot; (1982), &quot;Tenebrae&quot; (1982) from Dario Argento, &quot;Julie Darling&quot; (1983), and an episode of &quot;Masquerade&quot;. In his memoir, &quot;From I Love Lucy to Shōgun and Beyond: Tales from the Other Side of the Camera&quot;, Jerry London stated that Franciosa could not remember his lines during the shooting of the television movie &quot;Wheels&quot;, so co-star Rock Hudson had to hold up cue cards for him during one scene in a car.

===Later career===
Franciosa starred in the Aaron Spelling-produced series &quot;Finder of Lost Loves&quot; (1984–85). He could be seen in &quot;Stagecoach&quot; (1986) and episodes of &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, and &quot;Jake and the Fatman&quot;.

In the 1985 revival of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, he appeared in the third-season episode &quot;Crazy as a Soup Sandwich,&quot; playing a gangster who is revealed to be the ultimate demon.

Later performances included &quot;Blood Vows: The Story of a Mafia Wife&quot; (1987), &quot;Death House&quot; (1988), Fashion Crime (1989), &quot;Ghost Writer&quot; (1989), &quot;Backstreet Dreams&quot; (1990), and Double Threat (1992). In 1990–91, he portrayed Colonel Doctor Otternschlag in the U.S. national tour of the musical &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., and other national tour locations.

Franciosa&#x27;s final film was &quot;City Hall&quot;, a 1996 drama starring Al Pacino and John Cusack, in which he portrayed a crime boss.

In his autobiography &quot;The Garner Files&quot;, actor James Garner stated that Franciosa, on the set of &quot;A Man Could Get Killed&quot;, constantly abused the stunt crew by not pulling punches in fight scenes, resulting in a physical confrontation with Garner.

==Personal life==
Franciosa was married four times, and had three children. His first marriage to Beatrice Bakalyar in 1952 ended in divorce in 1957. On May 4, 1957, he married actress Shelley Winters; the couple divorced in 1960.

He next wed the former Judith Balaban, daughter of Barney Balaban, and author of the book &quot;The Bridesmaids&quot; about her friend Princess Grace of Monaco, in whose wedding she served as a bridesmaid. This union produced Franciosa&#x27;s only daughter, Nina.

His fourth and final marriage was to Rita Thiel on November 27, 1970 -- coincidentally, the day his final episode of &quot;The Name Of The Game&quot; aired. The marriage lasted until his death in 2006. The pair had two sons, organic farmer Marco and actor Christopher.

When asked about Franciosa&#x27;s hair-trigger temper, Thiel said &quot;He was never taught how to control his temper ... I changed him a lot ... We still have good fights once in a while, but I can scream back at him.&quot;

Franciosa, reflecting about Thiel&#x27;s influence on him, said
: &quot;It took years of therapy and simply living through things to finally accept and enjoy myself. My wife Rita&#x27;s influence has been profound in that process. Her family was a product of The Great Disaster — World War II. She emerged from the flames with a remarkable buoyancy. Each day she rises with an optimism, a serenity toward life that is certainly contagious. Does that sound romantic? If so, so be it.&quot;

During his later years, Franciosa lived in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles. He died on January 19, 2006, five days after the death of his second wife Shelley Winters, at age 77 at nearby UCLA Medical Center after suffering a massive stroke.

<text>Warren Griffin III (born November 10, 1970) is an American rapper, songwriter, record producer, and DJ who helped popularize West Coast hip hop during the 1990s. A pioneer of G-funk, he attained mainstream success with his 1994 single &quot;Regulate&quot; (featuring Nate Dogg). He is credited with discovering Snoop Dogg, having introduced the then-unknown rapper to record producer Dr. Dre.

His debut studio album, &quot;Regulate... G Funk Era&quot; (1994), debuted at number two on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 176,000 in its first week. The album has since received triple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), signifying sales of three million copies. &quot;Regulate&quot; spent 18 weeks within the top 40 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, with three weeks at number two, while its follow-up, &quot;This D.J.&quot;, peaked at number nine. At the 37th Annual Grammy Awards, both songs received nominations for Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Solo Performance, respectively.

Three songs from his second album, &quot;Take a Look Over Your Shoulder&quot; (1997), peaked within the top 40, as did his 1998 duet with Nate Dogg, &quot;Nobody Does It Better&quot;. Both the album and its follow-up, &quot;I Want It All&quot; (1999), received gold certifications by the RIAA. His fourth album, &quot;The Return of the Regulator&quot; (2001), failed to yield his earlier commercial heights. Along with longtime collaborators Snoop Dogg and Nate Dogg, he formed the hip-hop trio 213, named for Long Beach&#x27;s area code; they released the album &quot;The Hard Way&quot; (2004) to mild success. 

His next two albums, 2005&#x27;s &quot;In the Mid-Nite Hour&quot; and then 2009&#x27;s &quot;The G Files&quot;, were released independently and self-produced. In 2015, he released &quot;Regulate... G Funk Era, Part II&quot;, an extended play featuring archived recordings of Nate Dogg, who died in 2011. In 2017, &quot;Regulate&quot;, certified platinum in 1994, went multi-platinum, propelled by digital downloads.

==Early life==
Warren Griffin III was born on November 10, 1970, and grew up in Long Beach, California. He had three sisters and was the only son of Warren Griffin Jr., an airplane mechanic, and Ola, a dietician. They divorced when Warren was 4 and he lived with his mother and three sisters in East Long Beach until he was just about to start middle school.

In 1982, Warren went to live with his father in North Long Beach. His new wife, Verna, had three children from a prior marriage, one of whom was Andre Young, the soon-to-become Dr. Dre who in 1984 joined a leading DJ crew, the World Class Wreckin&#x27; Cru, which by 1985 doubled as an electro rap group, which in 1987 put out the Los Angeles area&#x27;s first rap recording under a major label. By then, a Jordan High School student, Warren was playing football and running with friends.

In 1988, age 17, Warren was jailed for gun possession. While incarcerated, he took the nickname Warren G. By this time, Dr. Dre was already beginning to experience success as the writer and record producer for Ruthless Records, as well as being a member of N.W.A with Ruthless Records founder Eazy-E and Ice Cube. N.W.A’s landmark album, &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;, was driving the Los Angeles area&#x27;s rap scene to swiftly drop electro for gangsta. Once out of jail, Warren worked at the Long Beach shipyards and began focusing on music after Dr. Dre taught him how to use a drum machine. 

By 1990, Warren G had formed the trio 213 with two longtime running mates, Nathaniel &quot;Nate Dogg&quot; Hale and Calvin &quot;Snoop Dogg&quot; Broadus. 213 was a contributor to the G-funk sound soon to emerge in rap. The trio dissolved after Warren G connected them to Dr. Dre. At that point, two solo careers were launched: Dr. Dre&#x27;s and Snoop Dogg&#x27;s, upon G-funk. Nate, too, signed to Dr. Dre&#x27;s Death Row Records. Warren G initially helped there; not desiring a career in his mentor and stepbrother&#x27;s shadow, however, he signed to Def Jam Recordings in New York City.

==Career==
===Start with 213 (circa 1990)===
By 1990, in his hometown Long Beach, as record producer and rapper, Warren formed a music trio with two of his longtime running mates, Nathaniel &quot;Nate Dogg&quot; Hale, a rapperlike singer, and Calvin &quot;Snoop Dogg” Broadus, a singerlike rapper. The Long Beach trio, fond of Oakland rap group 415, named for the Bay area&#x27;s area code, took the name 213, the Los Angeles area&#x27;s. Practicing and recording in the modest studio in Long Beach record store V.I.P., they cut a demo tape. Dr. Dre, already a celebrity, rebuffed his younger stepbrother Warren&#x27;s requests for him to listen.

Before long, homemade copies of 213&#x27;s songs spread in Los Angeles county, particularly the cities Compton and Pomona, and Los Angeles city&#x27;s sections Watts and South Central, but no label picked them up. One day, Warren phoned Dre to catch up, and found him at a bachelor party—thrown for Dre&#x27;s friend Andre &quot;LA Dre&quot; Bolton, another record producer—whereupon Warren found himself invited to join it. There, once the songs began to repeat, Warren offered LA Dre the 213 tape. Liking it, he summoned Dr. Dre, who, hearing the Snoop rap &quot;Super Duper Snooper&quot;, immediately welcomed the trio. Days later, 213 moved into Dre&#x27;s lavish troubadour-style house in Calabasas, home to both his wife and his recording studio.

In April 1992, Dr. Dre&#x27;s debut solo single &quot;Deep Cover&quot; introduced America to Snoop Doggy Dogg, the track&#x27;s guest but instantly star rapper. Warren helped Dre find sounds for Dre&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;The Chronic&quot;, further debuting Snoop, whereby superstardom chased Snoop into 1993 and, via Snoop&#x27;s own debut solo album, &quot;Doggystyle&quot;, captured him by 1994. By then, also solo, Nate, too, had joined Dre&#x27;s label, Death Row Records. Warren, returning to Long Beach, aimed to find his own way. In 2004, a 213 album finally arrived: &quot;The Hard Way&quot;.

===Solo stardom (1993–1996)===
During 1993, at Dr. Dre&#x27;s studio, Warren met John Singleton, director of &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot;, the seminal film named for Eazy-E&#x27;s debut single, produced by Dre. Singleton asked Warren to produce a song for the soundtrack of his forthcoming film &quot;Poetic Justice&quot;. Warren thus produced Mista Grimm&#x27;s song &quot;Indo Smoke&quot;, featuring Warren G and Nate Dogg. The single&#x27;s success led to Warren&#x27;s invitation to Russell Simmons&#x27;s label Def Jam Recordings, where Warren G signed a record deal. Also that year, Warren and Nate, along with Kurupt—whom the 213 trio had brought to Dre to help on his album &quot;The Chronic&quot;—feature on &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Fun (If the Homies Can&#x27;t Have None)&quot;, a huge underground hit, too risque to be a single, on Snoop&#x27;s &quot;Doggystyle&quot; album, released in November.

On the &quot;Above The Rim&quot; soundtrack, from Death Row Records in April 1994, the single &quot;Regulate&quot; was a duet cowritten and performed by Warren G and Nate Dogg. Spending 20 weeks on the popular songs chart, the Billboard Hot 100, with 18 of them in the Top 40, including three weeks at No. 2 in May, it was the summer&#x27;s top rap hit. Certified gold, half a million copies sold, since June, it attained platinum, a million copies, in August. In January 2017, via digital downloading, it was certified 2x multi-platinum. Back in the American summer of 1994, it stood at No. 1 on the MTV charts. Performing in Japan, he would discover fans who apparently understood no English, but knew all the lyrics. Into the 21st century, it remained Def Jam&#x27;s biggest hit single. Russell Simmons, a Def Jam founder, explains, &quot;Warren&#x27;s music was worldwide because the melody plays no matter what the language.&quot;

Yet further, unlike other G-funk (short for &quot;gangsta&quot; funk) artists, Warren G, even called &quot;a romantic&quot; at heart, voiced simpler concerns. And his modest rap styling maximized, by heeding, his modest lyricism. &quot;Regulate&quot; doubled as the lead single Warren G&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Regulate... G Funk Era&quot;, arriving in June 1994. Selling a million copies in three days, it debuted at No. 2 on the popular albums chart, the Billboard 200. In August, it was certified 2x multi-platinum, two million copies sold. Its second single, &quot;This D.J.&quot;, went gold, half a million copies, in September, while peaking in July at No. 9. At the 1995 Grammy Awards, in March, both singles were nominated. And in January, the album&#x27;s other single, &quot;Do You See&quot;, had peaked at No. 42. In August, the album was certified 3x multi-platinum. That month also brought some Warren G collaborations on two albums from his Long Beach associates, Twinz only album &quot;Conversation (album)&quot; and The Dove Shack trio&#x27;s &quot;This Is the Shack&quot;. And 1996 saw Warren G on the &quot;Groupie&quot; track of Snoop&#x27;s second album, &quot;Tha Doggfather&quot;.

===Follow-up albums (1997–2001)===
Warren G&#x27;s second album, &quot;Take a Look Over Your Shoulder&quot;, released in March 1997. It was certified gold, with half a million copies sold, in May. Sharing with the &quot;Supercop&quot; soundtrack the single &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got To Do with It&quot;, featuring singer Adina Howard, a spin on the 1984 single by Tina Turner, reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart, and peaked in the U.S. at No. 32 on the Billboard Hot 100. &quot;Smokin&#x27; Me Out&quot;, featuring Ron Isley of the classic soul group, reaching No. 35, was big on the Los Angeles area&#x27;s radio play. &quot;I Shot the Sheriff&quot;, a lyrical spin on the 1973 single by Bob Marley &amp; the Wailers, yet an instrumental borrow from rap group EPMD&#x27;s 1988 single &quot;Strictly Business&quot;, which itself samples that Wailers classic, reached No. 20. Yet a letdown overall, the album missed his debut&#x27;s superstar potential.

In July 1998, Warren G&#x27;s sixth appearance in the Billboard Hot 100&#x27;s upper tier Top 40 became Nate Dogg&#x27;s single &quot;Nobody Does it Better&quot;—on Nate&#x27;s repeatedly delayed debut album—featuring Warren G, in another duet, which peaked at No. 18 on the Billboard Hot 100. Here, incidentally, Warren raps a bar indicating his transition to family life. Warren&#x27;s third album, &quot;I Want It All&quot;, released in October 1999, has Warren mainly producing—where, perhaps, his greater comparative strength among musical peers abides—while vocals go largely to guest artists, including Nate Dogg, Snoop Dogg, RBX, Kurupt, Eve, Slick Rick, and Jermaine Dupri. Certified gold in November 1999, it bears the single &quot;I Want It All&quot;, featuring Mack 10, which, becoming Warren&#x27;s most recent Top 40 appearance, peaked on the Hot 100 at No. 23.

Over 20 years later, his 1997 and 1999 albums remain at gold certification, which none of his subsequent albums have achieved. Released in December 2001, Warren&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;The Return of the Regulator&quot;, with a litany of collaborators, including the P-Funk father and G-funk godfather George Clinton and, elsewhere, Dr. Dre producing a track, is allegedly overdone, a comeback undone by Warren&#x27;s reaching beyond his strengths and being outdone by his guests. He &quot;wastes a hot, Dre-produced beat&quot;, in the single &quot;Lookin&#x27; at You&quot;, alleges a &quot;Vibe&quot; writer, who finds G-funk on its deathbed and Warren G &quot;administering the fatal shot&quot;. The album peaked at number 83 the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and became his final album under a major record label, here Universal Music Group, before returned on an independent label.

===Indie career (2005–present)===
&quot;In the Mid-Nite Hour&quot;, released in October 2005, Warren G&#x27;s fifth album, his first without a major label involved, was on Hawino Records. Heavily featuring his native, 213 groupmates Nate and Snoop, it is devotedly Warren&#x27;s own project, homemade on a low budget. Music critics assess it to better carry Warren G&#x27;s own virtues as G-funk&#x27;s everyman. Yet by that very virtue, as expected, it saw scarce exposure beyond Warren G&#x27;s fans.

His sixth album, in September 2009, &quot;The G Files&quot;, &quot;still the same basic G-funk sound&quot;, adds to &quot;that classic soul vibe&quot;, Warren explains, &quot;a taste of that modern electro sound&quot;. Disliking what he put as the rap standard of &quot;some drums and one synth sound&quot;, he titled &quot;The West is Back&quot; for return to &quot;that great soulful sound&quot;. &quot;100 Miles and Running&quot; features Nate Dogg—recorded before Nate&#x27;s strokes in 2007 and 2008—and the Wu-Tang Clan&#x27;s Raekwon.

From June to September 2013, Warren toured in the West Coast Fest, &quot;an OG affair&quot; with DJ Quik, Mack 10, the Dogg Pound, Bone Thugs N Harmony, and others. Meanwhile, in a guest role, Warren played OG Hemingway in the sitcom &quot;Newsreaders&quot; on the Cartoon Network&#x27;s Adult Swim programming. And in August 2014, on the Mnet channel&#x27;s reality series &quot;American Hustle Life&quot;, he directed an alternate music video for &quot;Boy In Luv&quot;, by South Korean boy band BTS.

Nostalgic fans would ask Warren for more of classic G-funk, and even ask for more from Nate Dogg, who had died in 2011. The single &quot;My House&quot;, leading Warren G&#x27;s first EP, arrived on July 13, 2015. With four songs, the EP, premised as a sequel to the 1994 original, is titled &quot;Regulate... G Funk Era, Part II&quot;. Released on August 6, it features E-40, Too Short, Jeezy, Bun B, and, in all four songs, Nate Dogg. With his unique knack for intuiting Warren&#x27;s production cues, Nate leaves behind some of his 213 partner&#x27;s favorite recordings.

==Personal life==
Warren has six children with his wife, Tennile Griffin. Getting older, increasingly identifying with his father, fond of cooking and storytelling, Warren G embraces &quot;his morals and good family fun&quot;. 

His oldest son, Olaijah, played college football for the USC Trojans at the cornerback position from 2018 to 2020; he was also recognized with all-conference honors in 2019 and 2020. In April 2021, Olaijah was signed by the NFL&#x27;s Buffalo Bills as an undrafted free agent. 

In 2019, Warren G launched a line of barbecue sauces and rubs, Sniffin Griffin&#x27;s BBQ, for retail and restaurant supply. This was inspired by his father, a cook in the U.S. Navy and avid barbecue chef.

<doc id="161496" wikidata="Q1523586" url="?curid=161496" title="A Hatful of Rain">
<text>A Hatful of Rain is a 1957 American drama film directed by Fred Zinnemann and starring Eva Marie Saint, Don Murray, Anthony Franciosa, Lloyd Nolan and Henry Silva. The story is based on a 1955 Broadway play of the same name about the effects of morphine addiction.

The screenplay was adapted by Michael V. Gazzo, Alfred Hayes and Carl Foreman from the play, also written by Gazzo. Foreman was blacklisted at the time of the film&#x27;s release. The Writers Guild of America added his name to the film&#x27;s credits in 1998, 14 years after his death. It features music by Bernard Herrmann, who was asked by 20th Century Fox to rescore his prelude for the film as the original was considered to be terrifying.

Franciosa was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role.

==Plot==
In a housing project apartment in New York City, Johnny Pope lives with his pregnant wife Celia and his brother Polo. Johnny is a veteran who recently returned from the Korean War, in which he sustained an injury while surviving for days trapped in a cave. His survival made him a hero in the newspapers, but his ensuing recuperation in a military hospital left him secretly addicted to the painkiller morphine, with Polo his only family member aware of his condition.

Johnny and Polo&#x27;s father John Sr. arrives in New York from his home in Florida to visit his sons and collect $2,500 that Polo had saved and promised to him whenever he wanted it. John Sr. has just fulfilled his dream of quitting his job and buying his own bar and needs the money to pay for repairs and remodeling. Polo tells his father that he spent the money but refuses to say what he purchased. John Sr. becomes angry and refuses to speak to Polo, continuing his usual pattern of praising Johnny and belittling Polo.

John Sr. expresses his pride in Johnny&#x27;s war service and that he has married a fine wife, is starting a family and lives in a nice apartment, while Polo is renting a room from his brother, is unmarried and works in a bar that his father considers low-class. John Sr. and Celia do not know that Polo gave the money to Johnny, who spent it all on his $40-a-day drug habit. John Sr. is also unaware that Johnny has lost four jobs in a row because of his habit and that Johnny and Celia are on the verge of divorce because Johnny ignores her and often leaves for hours, sometimes for a full night. Celia thinks that he is seeing another woman, but he is actually seeking drugs, which are becoming harder to find as the police are arresting many dealers.

While John Sr. is visiting, Johnny&#x27;s dealer &quot;Mother&quot; comes to the Popes&#x27; apartment with his henchmen Apples and Chuch, ready to beat Johnny badly because he owes Mother $500 and has no money to pay. Johnny begs for enough dope to last him until his father returns to Florida the next day, and Mother gives him one dose but warns him that he needs to pay at least $300 by the next day or they will put him in the hospital. Mother gives Johnny a gun and suggests that he commit robbery to acquire the money. After arguing with Celia, Johnny leaves and spends the night walking the streets. He tries to rob several people at gunpoint but is unable to commit the crime. At the apartment, a drunk Polo confesses his love for Celia, who in her loneliness and desperation is almost ready to return his love. Despite their mutual feelings, they fall asleep in separate rooms.

When Johnny returns in the morning, he is feeling withdrawal symptoms and needs to meet a dealer for a fix, but his father expects to spend the day with him. Johnny tries to convince his father to spend the day with Polo instead. but John Sr. does not want to talk to Polo, causing an emotional confrontation. John Sr. finally agrees to attend the football game with Polo. Johnny coerces Polo into driving him to meet the dealer by threatening to throw himself out of the car in traffic, but when Johnny arrives at the meeting place, the dealer is being arrested. Johnny goes into severe withdrawal and begins to hallucinate just as Mother and his gang arrive to collect Johnny&#x27;s payment. Upon learning that Johnny does not have the money, they give him one dose in exchange for the $12 that Polo has in his wallet and tell Polo to sell his car to cover Johnny&#x27;s $500 debt. Polo pleads with Johnny to tell Celia that he is a junkie.

The fix temporarily cures Johnny&#x27;s withdrawal, and he tries to reconcile with Celia by preparing a romantic dinner. However, she tells Johnny that she no longer loves him and wants a divorce. When he confesses that he is a junkie and that his habit has caused his absence and inattention, she reacts supportively. John Sr. and Polo arrive for dinner and Johnny informs his father that he is a junkie and that Polo&#x27;s $2,500 was spent on drugs for him. His father becomes angry, causing Johnny, who is going into withdrawal again, to flee the apartment. Celia then becomes ill and is rushed to the hospital to avoid losing the baby. When Johnny returns, he is menaced by Mother but is saved by Polo, who pays Mother $500 that he obtained by selling his car. Johnny announces his intention to overcome his habit, even throwing a package of dope back to Mother. John Sr. and Celia return, and Celia takes charge, reassures Johnny and calls the police to bring Johnny to the hospital.

==Reception==
In a contemporary review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Bosley Crowther called &quot;A Hatful of Rain&quot; &quot;a striking, sobering film&quot; and wrote: &quot;The sum of it is a harrowing picture of what it means for a man to be a slave of the dope habit—what it costs in money, in anguish and in hurt to those he loves. ... [T]hey have contrived a tremendously taut and true description of human agony and shame, of solicitude and frustration and the piteousness of tangled love. And it is so directed by Mr. Zinnemann and acted by an excellent cast that every concept and nuance of the story is revealed.&quot;

Critic Philip K. Scheuer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote: &quot;&#x27;A Hatful of Rain&#x27; takes a grip on the spectator that gradually grows viselike and never lets go till the fadeout—if then. ... Half reality, half nightmare, it is the best film I have seen about the insidious consequences of drug addiction. But now, Hollywood and heaven willing, I have had it.&quot;

<text>Wild is the Wind is a 1957 American drama film directed by George Cukor and starring Anna Magnani, Anthony Quinn, and Anthony Franciosa. It tells the story of an American rancher who, after his wife dies, goes to Italy to marry her sister, but finds that she falls in love with his young ranch hand.

The screenplay was adapted by Arnold Schulman from the 1947 Italian film &quot;Fury&quot;, which was in turn loosely based on Giovanni Verga&#x27;s novella &quot;La Lupa&quot;. The title song, &quot;Wild Is the Wind&quot;, was performed by Johnny Mathis.
The Italian title was &#x27;Selvaggio è il vento&#x27;, literal translation of the original English.

==Plot==
Gino (Anthony Quinn) is a sheepherder in Nevada who travels to Italy to marry Gioia (Anna Magnani), the sister of his wife, who died a number of years previously.

He brings her back to his ranch, but struggles with the memory of his dead wife, even calling Gioia by his last wife&#x27;s name. With Gino feeling disappointed with her, Gioia feels neglected and resentful that she is constantly being compared with her late sister and found wanting.

She turns outside of her marriage to fulfill her needs and has an affair with Bene (Anthony Franciosa), a ranch hand whom Gino raised from boyhood and considers as almost a son.

Only then does Gino realize how much he needs Gioia; he pleads with her to stay at the ranch instead of returning to Italy.

<text>The Old Man and the Sea is a 1952 novella by the American author Ernest Hemingway. Written between December 1950 and February 1951, it was the last major fictional work Hemingway published during his lifetime. It tells the story of Santiago, an aging fisherman, and his long struggle to catch a giant marlin. The novella was highly anticipated and was released to record sales; the initial critical reception was equally positive, but attitudes have varied significantly since then.

Hemingway began writing &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; in Cuba during a tumultuous period in his life. His previous novel &quot;Across the River and Into the Trees&quot; had met with negative reviews and, amid a breakdown in relations with his wife Mary, he had fallen in love with his muse Adriana Ivancich. Having completed one book of a planned &quot;sea trilogy&quot;, Hemingway began to write as an addendum a story about an old man and a marlin that had originally been told to him fifteen years earlier. He wrote up to a thousand words a day, completing the 26,531-word manuscript in six weeks.

Over the following year, Hemingway became increasingly convinced that the manuscript would stand on its own as a novella. &quot;Life&quot; magazine published the full novella in its September 1, 1952 issue. Hemingway&#x27;s publisher, Scribner&#x27;s, released their first edition a week later on the 8th. Thanks to favorable early reviews and word-of-mouth, popular anticipation was so high that both releases were heavily bootlegged. The magazine sold a record 5.3 million copies in two days, while Scribner&#x27;s sold tens of thousands of copies. Translated into nine languages by the end of 1952, &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; remained on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list for six months. In 1953, it received the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, and it was the only work explicitly mentioned when Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954.

Early reviews were positive, with many hailing what they saw as a return to form for Hemingway after &quot;Across the River&quot;″s negative reception. The acclaim lessened over time, as literary critics began to think the initial reception overblown and over-enthusiastic. Whether &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; is inferior or equal to Hemingway&#x27;s other works has since been the subject of scholarly debate. Thematic analysis has focused on Christian imagery and symbolism, on the similarity of the novella&#x27;s themes to its predecessors in the Hemingway canon, and on the character of the fisherman Santiago.

==Plot==
Santiago is an elderly fisherman who has not caught a fish in eighty-four days and is considered &quot;&quot; (very unlucky). Manolin, who had been trained by Santiago, has been forced by his parents to work on a different, luckier boat; Manolin still helps Santiago prepare his gear every morning and evening and brings him food. They talk about baseball and Joe DiMaggio, before the boy leaves and Santiago sleeps. He dreams of the sights and experiences of his youth.

On the eighty-fifth day of his streak, Santiago takes his skiff out early, intending to row far into the Gulf Stream. He catches nothing except a small albacore in the morning before hooking a huge marlin. The fish is too heavy to haul in and begins to tow the skiff farther out to sea. Santiago holds on through the night, eating the albacore after sunrise. He sees the marlin for the first time—it is longer than the boat. Santiago increasingly appreciates the fish, showing respect and compassion towards his adversary. Sunset arrives for a second time and the fisherman manages some sleep; he is awoken by the fish panicking but manages to recover his equilibrium. On the third morning the marlin begins to circle. Almost delirious, Santiago draws the marlin in and harpoons it. He lashes the fish to his boat.

A mako shark smells blood in the water and takes a forty-pound bite of the marlin. Killing the shark but losing his harpoon, Santiago lashes his knife to an oar as a makeshift spear and kills three more sharks before the knife blade snaps. Cursing himself for going out too far, he apologises to the mutilated carcass of the marlin. He clubs two more sharks at sunset, but the marlin is now half-eaten. In the third night, the sharks come as a pack and leave only bones behind them. Santiago reaches shore and sleeps in his shack, leaving the skeleton tied to his skiff.

In the morning, Manolin cries when he sees Santiago&#x27;s state. He brings coffee and sits with Santiago until he wakes. He insists on accompanying Santiago in the future. A fisherman measures the marlin at eighteen feet long, and a pair of tourists mistake its skeleton for that of a shark. Santiago goes back to sleep and dreams of lions on an African beach.

==Background and publication==

&quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; was Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s sixth major novel, following &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; (1926), &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; (1929), &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; (1937), &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; (1940), and &quot;Across the River and Into the Trees&quot; (1950). Although the latter, published on September 7, sold 75,000 copies in its first month and remained on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list for twenty-one weeks, critical reception was largely negative. Amid a breakdown in marital relations with his wife Mary, Hemingway fell deeper into love with his muse, the young Italian Adriana Ivancich, who spent the winter of 1950–51 in the Hemingways&#x27; company in Cuba. Suddenly finding himself able to write in early December, he completed one book (published in 1970 as &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot;) of a planned &quot;sea trilogy&quot;, and, as his passion for Ivancich cooled, set about writing another story.

In the mid-1930s, the Cuban guide Carlos Gutiérrez had related a story involving an old man and a giant marlin to Hemingway, who retold it in &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine in an essay titled &quot;On the Blue Water: A Gulf Stream Letter&quot;. According to Mary Cruz, this tale was likely first told by the Cuban author Ramón Meza y Suárez Inclán in 1891 and was consistently retold by fishermen over the next forty years. Significant influence came from Hemingway&#x27;s own experience with the Gulf Stream, where he sailed for thousands of hours in the decades before writing &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;. He greatly enjoyed the sport of big-game fishing, participating in and winning several tournaments, and he also became an avid amateur naturalist, inviting luminaries such as Henry Weed Fowler and Charles Cadwalader to record and describe catches on his boat, the &quot;Pilar&quot;. During a single month on board, aided by Hemingway&#x27;s skill in fishing and sailing, the ichthyologist Fowler learnt enough to &quot;revise the classification of marlin for the whole North Atlantic.&quot;
Having put off a novelisation for sixteen years, but aided by his love and knowledge of fishing and the sea, Hemingway suddenly found himself writing a thousand words a day—twice as fast as usual. Although Ivancich&#x27;s departure on February 7, 1951, caused Hemingway some disquiet, the novella was essentially finished by February 17; Mary, who read each day&#x27;s production in the evenings, commented that she was &quot;prepared to pardon [Hemingway] for all the disagreeable things [he] had done.&quot; Hemingway was himself struck by the quality of this seemingly simple story, which he had written in little more than six weeks. Over the next few months, he sent copies to trusted friends and associates including his publisher Charles Scribner and his friend A. E. Hotchner, who all responded very positively.

The 26,531-word manuscript was held in temporary abeyance for over a year, during which time Hemingway became increasingly certain he wished to publish it on its own merits, rather than as an addendum to the &quot;sea trilogy&quot;. Conversations with Leland Hayward and Wallace Meyer encouraged him in this direction—Hemingway was delighted when Hayward secured the publication of the entire novella in one issue of &quot;Life&quot; magazine in May 1952. As he wrote to Meyer, Hemingway wished to rebuff the idea he should only write &quot;War and Peace&quot; or &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;-like novels. He rejected the initial cover designs from his publisher Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons, and asked Ivancich to draw a set of sketches which he found much more suitable. He had intended to dedicate the book to Mary and to his boat, the Pilar, but changed his mind on Memorial Day when thinking about friends he had lost; Mary generously accepted the new dedication, to Scribner and Max Perkins. Events moved slowly yet positively during the summer. Hemingway&#x27;s old adversary William Faulkner released a highly positive review, and word-of-mouth reached such proportions that both the &quot;Life&quot; and Scribner&#x27;s editions were heavily bootlegged.

&quot;Life&quot; released their Labor Day printing, containing the first publication of &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;, on September 1, 1952; they sold a record 5.3 million copies in two days. Advanced sales of Scribner&#x27;s edition in America and Jonathan Cape&#x27;s edition in Britain reached a total of 70,000, and afterwards combined weekly sales in the two countries averaged 5,000. It remained on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list for twenty-six weeks and had been translated into nine languages by the start of 1953.

==Reception and legacy==
&quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; met with popular acclaim. In the three weeks after publication, Hemingway received more than eighty letters a day from well-wishers, and &quot;Life&quot; received many more. Religious figures began to cite the book&#x27;s themes in their sermons. Critical reception was initially equally positive, placing the novella as superior in quality to &quot;Across the River&quot; and equal to Hemingway&#x27;s earliest works. With &quot;Time&quot; magazine labelling it a &quot;masterpiece&quot;, Cyril Connolly praised &quot;the best story Hemingway has ever written&quot; and Mark Schorer noted that Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;incomparable&quot; work set him apart as &quot;the greatest craftsman in the American novel in this century&quot;. Many reviewers, seeing it as &quot;the apex of the Hemingway canon&quot;, termed it a &quot;classic&quot;. Hemingway&#x27;s favourite review was from the art historian Bernard Berenson, who wrote that &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; was superior to Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; and equal in many ways to the Homeric epics.

After the early adulation faded, less positive reviews began to appear. Delmore Schwartz believed that the initial reviewers had prejudiced public opinion in their relief that the novella was not as bad as &quot;Across the River&quot;. Seymour Krim wrote that &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; was &quot;only more of the same&quot;, while John W. Aldridge felt himself &quot;unable to share in the prevailing wild enthusiasm&quot; for the novella. Years later, Jeffrey Meyers called it Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;most overrated work&quot;, a &quot;mock-serious fable&quot; with &quot;radical weaknesses&quot;. Despite the cooling critical outlook, &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction on May 4, 1953—this was the first time Hemingway had received the award, having been overlooked previously for &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; and &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;. He also accepted a Medal of Honor from Fulgencio Batista&#x27;s newly-established Cuban dictatorship, despite personally disapproving of the new regime. &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;″s highest recognition came on October 28, 1954, as the only work of Hemingway&#x27;s mentioned by the Swedish Academy when awarding him the Nobel Prize in Literature; they praised its &quot;powerful, style-making mastery of the art of modern narration&quot;.

&quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; has been the subject of a significant amount of critical commentary that has changed over the generations. Wirt Williams noted that early scholarship focused upon &quot;the naturalistic tragedy, the Christian tragedy, the parable of art and the artist, and even the autobiographical mode&quot;. Analysis of these themes continued into the 1960s, during which John Killinger connected the novella with Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Friedrich Nietzsche, and Richard Hovey linked its themes to the Oedipus complex. However, Philip Young&#x27;s republication of &quot;Ernest Hemingway: A Reconsideration&quot; in 1966 was much less positive than the original edition in 1952, setting the disinterested scholarly tone that would dominate the next decades. Analysis only restarted in earnest with the publication of Gerry Brenner&#x27;s hyper-critical &quot; The Old Man and the Sea: The Story of a Common Man&quot; in 1991, and has continued unabated since.

Writing in 1985, Meyers noted that &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; was used in English lessons in schools worldwide and continued to earn $100,000 per year in royalties. According to the CIA, it was a favourite book of Saddam Hussein, who saw himself, like Santiago, as &quot;struggl[ing] against overwhelming odds with courage, perseverance, and dignity&quot;. The Big Read, a 2003 survey of the United Kingdom&#x27;s 200 &quot;best-loved novels&quot; conducted by the BBC, listed &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; at number 173. Hemingway was directly involved in making a 1958 film adaptation starring Spencer Tracy. Production was marred by numerous difficulties and although the film soundtrack, composed by Dimitri Tiomkin, won the Academy Award for Best Original Score, Hemingway heartily disliked the final film. Two more adaptations have been produced: a 1990 television film starring Anthony Quinn, and a 1999 production by Aleksandr Petrov which won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film.

==Critical analysis==
===Quality and accuracy===
Some literary critics find &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; inferior to Hemingway&#x27;s earlier works. Dwight Macdonald criticises the pseudo-archaic prose which pretends it is high culture, but in reality is anything but. He compares the novella unfavourably with Hemingway&#x27;s earlier works; he deplored &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; as garrulous and repetitive when compared to the &quot;disciplined, businesslike understatement&quot; of &quot;The Undefeated&quot;, a short story Hemingway wrote in 1927. Similarly, Brenner characterises the novella as riddled with amateurish mistakes in style and prose. Meyers criticises &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;″s melodrama, symbolism, and irony, concluding, like Macdonald, that &quot;Hemingway either deceived himself about the profundity of his art&quot; or expertly satisfied the desires of a pretentious audience.

Robert Weeks notes that the novella abounds in factual impossibilities—he cites Santiago&#x27;s near-clairvoyance in identifying fishes and judging weather patterns. Weeks maintains that Hemingway—previously criticized for his distaste for narrative invention—had instilled insincerity at the heart of his novel. He concluded that &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; is &quot;an inferior Hemingway novel.&quot; Bickford Sylvester comments that most of the errors Weeks outlined were based upon faults in then-current science, and some others were intended to nudge readers towards the work&#x27;s subtext and deepest details. Sylvester argues that seemingly-implausible narrative details in &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; are actually hints. He cites the baseball conversation between Santiago and Manolin, which subtly indicates not only the precise dates of the novella&#x27;s events (September 12–16, 1950) but also parallels the fisherman with his hero DiMaggio, also the son of a fisherman, who similarly resurged in performance during that week.

===Themes===
====Classical====

The novella contains significant Christian symbolism. The name &quot;Santiago&quot; is Spanish for St. James, the Apostle who had previously, according to the New Testament, been a fisherman, and who posthumously became the patron saint of Spain with his shrine at Santiago de Compostela. In a letter to a Father Brown in 1954, Hemingway wrote &quot;You know about Santiago and you know that the name is no accident&quot;; the academic H. R. Stoneback argues that this means &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; has deep connections to the pilgrimage to Santiago, which is also heavily drawn upon in &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;. Stoneback draws an explicit link between the events of the novella and the miraculous catch of fish in the Gospel of Luke—both involve fishermen experiencing bad luck, going out into the deep sea, and taking a great catch; he also connects repeated allusions to stars in Hemingway&#x27;s text to the traditional Latin etymology of &quot;Compostela&quot;—&quot;campus stellae&quot; (). Stoneback argues that Hemingway emphasises &quot;the humility and gentleness, the poverty, resolution and endurance of St. James the pilgrim&quot; while de-emphasising the warrior James Matamoros; this choice &quot;reconstruct[s] the paradigm of sainthood&quot;.

One of Santiago&#x27;s credos is that &quot;a man can be destroyed but not defeated&quot;, a theme which is present in most of Hemingway&#x27;s protagonists and stories, from Jake Barnes in &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; to Robert Jordan in &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;, and Richard Cantwell in &quot;Across the River&quot;; it is also a primary theme in &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot;. Backman views Santiago as the climactic &quot;matador&quot; of Hemingway&#x27;s works, who manages to seek a type of natural violence quite unlike the &quot;violent ritualized&quot; bullfighting or &quot;uneasily insistent&quot; killing found in previous novels. Joseph Waldmeir similarly finds &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; to contain a better synthesis of Hemingway&#x27;s views on mortality than works such as &quot;Death in the Afternoon&quot; (1932).

Many critics have drawn parallels not only between Santiago and St. James, but between Santiago and Jesus himself, especially with regard to Christ&#x27;s Passion and crucifixion. Melvin Backman outlines several, beginning with the Santiago&#x27;s wish to &quot;rest gently ... against the wood and think of nothing&quot;; Sylvester, Grimes, and Hays also cite the preceding scene, in which Santiago is cut and bleeds from near the eye, as a stigmatic evocation of the wounds inflicted by the crown of thorns. An often-cited passage occurs when Santiago spots two sharks:

This passage was characterised by Sylvester, Grimes, and Hays as &quot;a clear reference to a crucifixion&quot;; taking place, like Christ&#x27;s death, at three o&#x27;clock on a Friday afternoon, it acts as the climax of the religious parallels. Brenner finds the Christian allusions deeply problematic, commenting that the &quot;facile linking of Santiago&#x27;s name with Christ&#x27;s&quot; was unnecessary and disrespectful towards the New Testament. Dismissing both Brenner&#x27;s conclusion and any approach which defines Santiago as a Christ-figure as overly simplistic, Stoneback argues that the figure of Santiago ultimately embodied Hemingway&#x27;s ideals, and was intended to be esteemed as such.

====Modern====
Brenner&#x27;s 1991 critique characterises Santiago as a supremely flawed individual: unintelligent, arrogant, paternalist, and anti-environmentalist. He criticises the fisherman&#x27;s inability to ignore economic considerations as he loots the sea of its treasures. He further commented that Santiago, portrayed as blatantly sexist and hostile towards all things female, was in fact feminized by his secret desire for Manolin, who was himself alternately traumatised and manipulated by Santiago&#x27;s aggression and duplicity. Brenner&#x27;s analysis has been strongly criticised: Stoneback terms it a &quot;jejune litany of ... shock-schlock critical fast-food [and] tired old questions&quot;, while Sylvester, Grimes, and Hays notes that &quot;much of the book reeks of rabid exaggeration and misreading&quot;. In answer to Glen Love&#x27;s similar ecologist critiques, they write that both Brenner and Love dismiss economic realities and ask the uneducated Santiago to consider problems that few outside biology cared about in 1950.

Susan Beegel, analysing &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; from an ecofeminist perspective, rejects Brenner&#x27;s view of Santiago&#x27;s sexism; instead, she writes that Santiago is in effect wedded to and at the service of the female sea. Beegel nevertheless characterises Santiago as viewing the feminine sea as tumultuous, cruel, and chaotic, and thus in need of being overcome by male power. Sylvester, Grimes, and Hays disagree, viewing Santiago&#x27;s approach as wholly respectful. Jeffrey Herlihy comments that Santiago&#x27;s Spanish heritage must be considered to be a major, and yet invisible, aspect of the novel. Even though Santiago is firmly embedded in Cuban culture, he dreams about Spain every night, and Herlily believes that this migrant background acts &quot;as a concealed foundation to the novella.&quot;

<doc id="161503" wikidata="Q374045" url="?curid=161503" title="Laurence Harvey">
<text>Laurence Harvey (born Zvi Mosheh Skikne; 1 October 192825 November 1973) was a Lithuanian-born actor. He was born to Lithuanian Jewish parents and emigrated to South Africa at an early age, before later settling in the United Kingdom after World War II. In a career that spanned a quarter of a century, Harvey appeared in stage, film and television productions primarily in the United Kingdom and the United States.

Harvey was known for his clipped, refined accent and cool, debonair screen persona. His performance in &quot;Room at the Top&quot; (1959) resulted in an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. That success was followed by the roles of William Barret Travis in &quot;The Alamo&quot; and Weston Liggett in &quot;Butterfield 8&quot;, both films released in the autumn of 1960. He also appeared as the brainwashed Sergeant Raymond Shaw in &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; (1962). He made his directorial debut with &quot;The Ceremony&quot; (1963), and continued acting into the 1970s until his early death in 1973 of cancer.

==Early life and career==
===South Africa===
Harvey was born in Joniškis, Lithuania, the youngest of three sons of Ella (née Zotnickaita) and Ber Skikne, Lithuanian Jewish parents. His civil birth name was Larushka Mischa Skikne. His Hebrew name was Zvi Mosheh. When he was five years old, his family travelled with the family of Riva Segal and her two sons, Louis and Charles Segal on the to South Africa, where he was known as Harry Skikne. Harvey grew up in Johannesburg. He was only fifteen when he auditioned to join the Entertainment Unit of the South African Army during the Second World War. Sid James managed the Unit and approved his audition. They became lifelong friends. As the mystery guest on the American TV show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, screened 1 May 1960, Harvey stated that he arrived in South Africa in 1934 and moved to the UK in 1946.

===Move to Britain===

After moving to London, he enrolled in the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, but left RADA after three months.

Billed as Larry Skikne, he appeared in the play &quot;Uprooted&quot; at the Comedy Theatre in 1947. He also appeared on stage at the Library Theatre in Manchester. His performances in Manchester led to him being cast in his first film.

===Film debut and new name===
Harvey made his cinema debut in the British film &quot;House of Darkness&quot; (1948), but its distributor British Lion thought someone named Larry Skikne was not commercially viable. Accounts vary as to how the actor acquired his stage name of Laurence Harvey. One version has it that it was the idea of talent agent Gordon Harbord who decided Laurence would be an appropriate first name. In choosing a British-sounding last name, Harbord thought of two British retail institutions, Harvey Nichols and Harrods. Another is that Skikne was travelling on a London bus with Sid James who exclaimed during their journey: &quot;It&#x27;s either Laurence Nichols or Laurence Harvey.&quot; Harvey&#x27;s own account differed over time.

===Associated British Picture Corporation and leading man===
Associated British Picture Corporation quickly offered him a two-year contract, which Harvey accepted. He appeared in supporting roles in several of their lower-budget films such as &quot;Man on the Run&quot; (1949), &quot;Landfall&quot; (1949) (directed by Ken Annakin) and &quot;The Dancing Years&quot; (1950). For International Motion Pictures he was in &quot;The Man from Yesterday&quot; (1949).

Mayflower Productions, which released through Associated British, gave Harvey his first lead, appearing alongside Eric Portman in the Egypt-set police film &quot;Cairo Road&quot; (1950). It was a minor success.

He had a small role in the Hollywood-financed &quot;The Black Rose&quot; (1950), starring Tyrone Power and Orson Welles, directed by Henry Hathaway. It was Harvey&#x27;s first experience in a Hollywood film. He played Cassio in a version of &quot;Othello&quot; for BBC TV starring Andre Morell.

Harvey starred in leading roles for two B-pictures for director Lewis Gilbert at Nettleford Films: &quot;Scarlet Thread&quot; (1951) and &quot;There Is Another Sun&quot; (1951). For Ealing, he made &quot;I Believe in You&quot; (1952), directed by Basil Dearden. According to &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; this performance gave &quot;an indication of Harvey&#x27;s true metier. While Basil Dearden&#x27;s direction focused on honest Harry Fowler, it was Harvey&#x27;s Jordie who supplied an authentic glimpse of pin-table thuggery, his clothes and hairstyle on the cusp between cosh-boy and ted and his manner redolent of a languorous sexuality no amount of National Service could quell.&quot;

He starred in the low-budget thriller &quot;A Killer Walks&quot; (1952). In 1951 he appeared on stage in &quot;Hassan&quot; at the Cambridge Theatre.

==Romulus films==
Harvey&#x27;s career gained a boost when he appeared in &quot;Women of Twilight&quot; (1952); this was made by Romulus Films run by brothers John and James Woolf, who signed Harvey to a long-term contract. James Woolf in particular was a big admirer of Harvey and played an important role in turning the actor into a star.

In 1953 he played Orlando on a BBC TV version of &quot;As You Like It&quot;, opposite Margaret Leighton, whom he would later marry.

Romulus put him in two ensemble films: a comedy, &quot;Innocents in Paris&quot; (1953) and a crime thriller, &quot;The Good Die Young&quot; (1954). He had an especially strong role in the latter, which was directed by Lewis Gilbert, and featured Hollywood actors such as John Ireland, Richard Basehart and Gloria Grahame, along with Leighton. This has been called his &quot;first performance of note.&quot;

Harvey received an offer to play the juvenile male lead in the Hollywood spectacular &quot;King Richard and the Crusaders&quot; (1954), a medieval swashbuckler for Warner Bros starring Rex Harrison, Virginia Mayo and George Sanders. It was a box-office disappointment, although Harvey&#x27;s performance was well received.

Harvey played Romeo in Renato Castellani&#x27;s adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1954), narrated by John Gielgud. His performance was generally not well received. According to a contemporary interview, he turned down an offer to appear in &quot;Helen of Troy&quot; (1955) to act at Stratford-upon-Avon, where he again performed in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, this time on stage.

Romulus gave Harvey another excellent chance when he was cast as the writer Christopher Isherwood in &quot;I Am A Camera&quot; (1955), with Julie Harris as Sally Bowles. He and Leighton starred in an adaptation of &quot;A Month in the Country&quot; for &quot;ITV Play of the Week&quot; (1955). He made his Broadway debut in 1955 in the play &quot;Island of Goats&quot;, a flop that closed after one week, though his performance won him a 1956 Theatre World Award. While in the US he appeared on TV in an episode of &quot;The Alcoa Hour&quot; called &quot;The Small Servant &quot;, co-starring Diane Cilento.

Zoltan Korda used him as one of the soldiers in &quot;Storm Over the Nile&quot; (1955), a remake of &quot;The Four Feathers&quot; (1939), playing the part taken by Ralph Richardson in the 1939 version. It was popular in Britain as was the comedy &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot; (1956), made for Romulus under the direction of Ken Annakin.

Harvey appeared in &quot;The Bet&quot; for &quot;ITV Television Playhouse&quot; (1956) then did another for Romulus, &quot;After the Ball&quot; (1957), a biopic of Vesta Tilley, in which Harvey played Walter de Frece. He followed it with &quot;The Truth About Women&quot; (1958), a comedy directed by Muriel Box for Beaconsfield Productions.

Harvey returned to Broadway in 1957 to appear alongside Julie Harris, Pamela Brown and Colleen Dewhurst in William Wycherley&#x27;s &quot;The Country Wife&quot; (a production he had originally starred in at London&#x27;s Royal Court Theatre).

For Romulus, Harvey starred in &quot;The Silent Enemy&quot; (1958), with his old friend Sid James, a biopic of war hero Lionel Crabb.

==International stardom==
===&quot;Room at the Top&quot;===
Harvey&#x27;s breakthrough to international stardom came after he was cast by director Jack Clayton as the social climber Joe Lampton in &quot;Room at the Top&quot; (1959), produced by Romulus. For his performance, Harvey received a BAFTA Award nomination and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. Simone Signoret and Heather Sears co-starred as Lampton&#x27;s married lover and eventual wife respectively. It was the third most popular movie at the British box office in 1959 and a hit in the U.S.

Harvey went to Broadway in 1958, as Shakespeare&#x27;s Henry V, as part of the Old Vic company, which featured a young Judi Dench as Katherine, the daughter of the king of France.

Harvey followed it with the musical &quot;Expresso Bongo&quot; (1959), a film best remembered for introducing Cliff Richard. He did &quot;The Violent Years&quot; for the &quot;ITV Play of the Week&quot; (1959).

While in the US he appeared in &quot;Arthur&quot;, an episode of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; directed by Hitchcock himself.

===Hollywood===
The success of &quot;Room at the Top&quot; led to Hollywood offers and Harvey decided to spend the next three years focusing on films. He was in John Wayne&#x27;s epic &quot;The Alamo&quot; (1960), being John Wayne&#x27;s personal choice to play Alamo commandant William Barret Travis. Wayne had been impressed by Harvey&#x27;s talent and ability to project the aristocratic demeanor Wayne believed Travis possessed. Harvey and Wayne later expressed their mutual admiration and satisfaction at having worked together. &quot;The Alamo&quot; was a hit (although the enormous cost meant the film lost money).

Even more successful was Harvey&#x27;s next Hollywood film, MGM&#x27;s &quot;BUtterfield 8&quot; (1960), which won Elizabeth Taylor her first Oscar. He was named for &quot;The Eddie Chapman Story&quot; but it was not made until years later, as &quot;Triple Cross&quot; with Christopher Plummer.

Back in Britain, Harvey was cast in the film version of &quot;The Long and the Short and the Tall&quot; (1961) in a role originally performed by Peter O&#x27;Toole during the play&#x27;s West End run. He clashed with Richard Todd and Richard Harris during filming but the movie was a hit in Britain. He was announced for some films that were not made (&quot;The Disenchanted&quot; from the novel by Budd Schulberg, &quot;No Bail for the Judge&quot; from Alfred Hitchcock, &quot;The Lion&quot;, and &quot;The Long Walk&quot;).

In the U.S., he supported Shirley MacLaine in MGM&#x27;s &quot;Two Loves&quot; (1961) and co-starred with Geraldine Page in the film adaptation of Tennessee Williams&#x27;s &quot;Summer and Smoke&quot; (1961), directed by Peter Glenville. He signed to appear in the film of &quot;Five Finger Exercise&quot; but was not in the eventual film. His fee around this time was $300,000 a film.

Harvey played the male lead in &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot; (1962), produced by Charles Feldman, cast alongside Barbara Stanwyck, Jane Fonda and Capucine. Fonda was not positive about the experience of working with him: &quot;There are actors and actors – and then there are the Laurence Harveys. With them, it&#x27;s like acting by yourself.&quot; The same year, he recorded an album of spoken excerpts from the book &quot;This Is My Beloved&quot; by Walter Benton, accompanied by original music by Herbie Mann. It was released on the Atlantic label. He narrated a TV musical, &quot;The Flood&quot; (1962).

MGM cast Harvey as Wilhelm Grimm in the MGM film &quot;The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm&quot; (1962), produced by George Pal. Harvey&#x27;s performance earned him a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama. The fantasy movie filmed in 3-strip Cinerama was a box office disappointment.

Harvey appeared as the brainwashed US Army Staff Sergeant Raymond Shaw in the Cold War thriller &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; (1962), directed by John Frankenheimer and starring Frank Sinatra and Angela Lansbury. Film critic David Shipman wrote: &quot;Harvey&#x27;s role required him to act like a zombie and several critics cited it as his first convincing performance&quot;. The movie was a hit and has since become critically highly regarded, and is one of Harvey&#x27;s better-remembered films.

Harvey went to Japan to make &quot;A Girl Named Tamiko&quot; (1962) with France Nuyen for director John Sturges and producer Hal Wallis. &quot;I have suddenly found the gates of Hollywood opened to me,&quot; he said at the time.

He followed this with &quot;The Running Man&quot; (1963), directed by Carol Reed, with Lee Remick and Alan Bates.

===Director===
Harvey made his directorial debut with the crime drama &quot;The Ceremony&quot; (1963), in which he also starred. It was shot in Spain for United Artists.

Harvey played King Arthur in the 1964 London production of the Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe musical &quot;Camelot&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.

He was the male lead in an adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham&#x27;s &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; (1964), co starring Kim Novak. Harvey had been connected to the project for several years. It was a troubled shoot, with Harvey and Novak clashing, and original director Henry Hathaway leaving during the shoot and being replaced by Ken Hughes. During filming, kidnap threats were made against both Harvey and Novak by student organisations.

&quot;The Outrage&quot; (1964) was director Martin Ritt&#x27;s remake of Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s Japanese film &quot;Rashomon&quot; (1950). Besides Harvey, the film starred Paul Newman and Claire Bloom, but was unsuccessful critically and commercially.

Harvey reprised his role as Joe Lampton in &quot;Life at the Top&quot; (1965), directed by Ted Kotcheff. This is considered one of his best later performances.

He had his first commercially successful film in a number of years with &quot;Darling&quot; (1965), starring Julie Christie and Dirk Bogarde. While Harvey&#x27;s role in the film is short, his involvement enabled director John Schlesinger to raise financial backing for the project. Harvey starred in a version of &quot;The Doctor and the Devils&quot; directed by Nicholas Ray from a script by Dylan Thomas but the film was not completed.

Harvey co-starred with Israeli actress Daliah Lavi in the comedy &quot;The Spy with a Cold Nose&quot; (1966), a parody of the James Bond films. Harvey did &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1967) and then &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; (1967) for American TV.

===&quot;Charge of the Light Brigade&quot;===
Harvey owned the rights to the book on which John Osborne&#x27;s early script for the film &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; (1968) was partially based, Cecil Woodham-Smith&#x27;s book &quot;The Reason Why&quot; (1953). He intended to make his own version. A lawsuit was filed against director Tony Richardson&#x27;s company Woodfall Film Productions on behalf of the book&#x27;s author. There was a monetary settlement, and Harvey insisted on being cast in a cameo role (being cast as Prince Radziwill) as part of the agreement for which he was paid £60,000. Charles Wood was brought in to re-write the script. Harvey&#x27;s scenes were cut from the movie at Richardson&#x27;s insistence except for a brief glimpse as an anonymous member of a theatre audience which, technically, still met the requirements of the legal settlement. John Osborne asserted in his autobiography that Richardson shot the scenes with Harvey &quot;French&quot;, which is film jargon for a director &quot;going-through-the-motions&quot; because of some obligation, but with no film in the camera.

Harvey completed direction of the spy thriller &quot;A Dandy in Aspic&quot; (1968) after director Anthony Mann died during production. The film co-stars Mia Farrow. This has been called &quot;his last effective cinema role... The critics greeted it with disdain but the plot was tailor-made for Harvey, who plays a Russian spy who has adopted an English identity so he can go undercover within British Intelligence.&quot;

Harvey provided the narration for the Soviet film &quot;Tchaikovsky&quot; (1969), directed by Igor Talankin.

==Later career==
Harvey co-starred with Ann-Margret in &quot;Rebus&quot; (1969) then appeared in &quot;Kampf um Rom&quot; (1970), a film set in Ancient Rome. The latter starred Orson Welles, who directed Harvey in &quot;The Deep&quot;, a thriller that was abandoned.

Harvey starred in &quot;She and He&quot; (1969), which he helped produce.

He had a cameo role as himself in &quot;The Magic Christian&quot; (1969), a film based on the Terry Southern novel of the same name. He gives a rendition of Hamlet&#x27;s soliloquy that develops unexpectedly into a campy striptease routine.

He had a small role in &quot;WUSA&quot; (1970) and was guest murderer on &quot;Columbo: The Most Dangerous Match&quot; in 1973, portraying a chess champion who kills his opponent. For British TV he appeared in a version of &quot;Arms and the Man&quot; for &quot;ITV Sunday Night Theatre&quot; (1971). Joanna Pettet appeared with Harvey in an episode of Rod Serling&#x27;s &quot;Night Gallery&quot; (&quot;The Caterpillar&quot;, 1972), in which Harvey&#x27;s character attempts to assassinate a romantic rival by having a burrowing insect dropped in the man&#x27;s ear.

Harvey starred in &quot;Escape to the Sun&quot; (1972), directed by Menahem Golan and was reunited with Elizabeth Taylor in &quot;Night Watch&quot; (1973), financed by Brut Productions. The same company financed &quot;Welcome to Arrow Beach&quot; (1974), which Harvey directed and starred in; the cast also included his friend Pettet, John Ireland and Stuart Whitman. The film deals with a type of war-related post-traumatic stress disorder that turns a military veteran to cannibalism.

===Final plans===
In August 1973, it was reported Harvey had been ill, but he assured people he was busier than ever. Just before he died, he was planning to star in and direct two films: one on Kitty Genovese, the other a Wolf Mankowitz comedy titled &quot;Cockatrice&quot;. His death put an end to any hope that Orson Welles&#x27;s &quot;The Deep&quot; would be completed. With Harvey and Jeanne Moreau in the leading roles, Welles worked on the film between his other projects, although the production was hampered by financial problems.

==Personal life==
He met Hermione Baddeley, an established actress, when they were cast in the film &quot;There Is Another Sun&quot; in 1950. She became his live-in partner and a lucky charm for his career. She introduced him to Basil Dean and his first part on the London stage in &quot;Hassan&quot;, followed by a season at Stratford in 1952 with Glen Byam Shaw. Most significantly, she introduced him to James Woolf, of Romulus Films. Harvey left Baddeley in 1952 for actress Margaret Leighton, who was then married to publisher Max Reinhardt. Leighton and Reinhardt divorced in 1955, and she married Harvey in 1957 off the Rock of Gibraltar. The couple divorced in 1961.

In 1968 he married Joan Perry, the widow of film mogul Harry Cohn. Her marriage to Harvey lasted until 1972.

His third marriage was to British fashion model Paulene Stone. She gave birth to their daughter Domino in 1969 while he was still married to Perry. Harvey and Stone married in 1972 and soon after, he adopted her child from her previous marriage, Sophie Norris (now Sophie Harvey). The wedding took place at the home of Harold Robbins.

In his account of being Frank Sinatra&#x27;s valet, &quot;Mr. S: My Life with Frank Sinatra&quot; (2003), George Jacobs writes that Harvey often made passes at him while visiting Sinatra. According to Jacobs, Sinatra was aware of Harvey&#x27;s sexuality. In his autobiography &quot;Close Up&quot; (2004), British actor John Fraser claimed Harvey was gay and that his long-term lover was Harvey&#x27;s manager James Woolf, who had cast Harvey in several of the films he produced in the 1950s.

After working in two films with her, Harvey remained friends with Elizabeth Taylor for the rest of his life. She visited him three weeks before he died. Upon his death, Taylor issued the statement: &quot;He was one of the people I really loved in this world. He was part of the sun. For everyone who loved him, the sun is a bit dimmer.&quot; She and Peter Lawford held a memorial service for Harvey in California.

Harvey once responded to an assertion about himself: &quot;Someone once asked me, &#x27;Why is it so many people hate you?&#x27; and I said, &#x27;Do they? How super! I&#x27;m really quite pleased about it.&#x27; &quot;

==Death==
A heavy smoker and drinker, Harvey died at the age of 45 from stomach cancer in Hampstead, North London, on November 25, 1973.

His daughter Domino, who later became a bounty hunter, was only four years old at the time. She died at the age of 35, in 2005, after overdosing on the painkiller drug fentanyl. They are buried together in Santa Barbara Cemetery in Santa Barbara, California.

==Appraisal==
According to his obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot;:
With his clipped speech, cool smile and a cigarette dangling impudently from his lips, Laurence Harvey established himself as the screen&#x27;s perfect pin-striped cad. He could project such utter boredom that willowy debutantes would shrivel in his presence. He could also exude such charm that the same young ladies would gladly lend him their hearts, which were usually returned utterly broken ... The image Mr Harvey carefully fostered for himself off screen was not far removed from some of the roles he played. &quot;I&#x27;m a flamboyant character, an extrovert who doesn&#x27;t want to reveal his feelings&quot;, he once said. &quot;To bare your soul to the world, I find unutterably boring. I think part of our profession is to have a quixotic personality.&quot;
According to &quot;Sight and Sound&quot;, &quot;Any young actor who delighted in pink bathroom suites and liked to compare himself favourably to Olivier, Gielgud and Richardson – preferably in the same sentence – was clearly going to find it hard to fit the mould of New Elizabethan chappism promoted by Rank and ABPC ... Harvey flaunted a cigarette holder almost as a parody of Terry Thomas&#x27; and boasted that his drainpipe trousers pre-dated the teddy boys&#x27;. His hairstyle always tended towards the baroque and quickly became a trademark.&quot;

<text>Maurice Ashley (born March 6, 1966) is a Jamaican and American chess player, author, and commentator. In 1999, he earned the FIDE title of Grandmaster (GM).

Ashley is well known as a commentator for high-profile chess events. He also spent many years teaching chess. On April 13, 2016, Ashley was inducted into the US Chess Hall of Fame.

== Early life ==
Ashley was born in St. Andrew, Jamaica. He attended Wolmer&#x27;s Boys School in Jamaica, and then moved to the United States when he was 12.

He went to Brooklyn Technical High School. Ashley graduated from City College of New York (CCNY) with a B.A. in Creative Writing. While at City College, he represented the school in intercollegiate team competition.

Ashley said he discovered chess in Jamaica, where his brother played chess with his friends. He got more serious about chess during high school, where he grew up in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and played in parks and clubs throughout New York City.

Ashley coached the Raging Rooks of Harlem, and the Dark Knights (also from Harlem), both of which won national championships under his guidance.

== Career ==

In 1992, Ashley shared the United States Game/10 chess championship with Maxim Dlugy.

On March 14, 1999, Ashley beat Adrian Negulescu to complete the requirements for the Grandmaster title. This made him the first Black chess Grandmaster.

In September 1999, Ashley founded the Harlem Chess Center, which has attracted such celebrities as Larry Johnson and Wynton Marsalis.

Along with GM Susan Polgar, Ashley was named 2003 Grandmaster of the Year by the U.S. Chess Federation.

In 2003, Ashley wrote an essay &quot;The End of the Draw Offer?&quot;, which raised discussion about ways to avoid quick agreed draws in chess tournaments.

In 2005, he wrote the book &quot;Chess for Success,&quot; relating his experiences and the positive aspects of chess. He was the main organizer for the 2005 HB Global Chess Challenge, with the biggest cash prize in history for an open chess tournament.

In 2007, Ashley returned to his birth country of Jamaica and became the first GM to ever participate in a tournament there, the Frederick Cameron Open. After sweeping a field consisting of several of Jamaica&#x27;s top players, Ashley was upset in the final round by Jamaican National Master Jomo Pitterson.

In 2008, Ashley was featured in an interview for the CNN documentary Black in America. He was shown during one scene in the film &quot;Brooklyn Castle&quot; mentoring a young chess player. He was mentioned in the chess movie &quot;Life of a King&quot; starring Cuba Gooding, Jr.

Starting in the Fall of 2012, Ashley was a Director&#x27;s Fellow at the MIT Media Lab and, between 2013 and 2015, Maurice was also a Fellow at Harvard University&#x27;s Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society in a joint fellowship at both Harvard&#x27;s Berkman Center and the Media Lab at MIT. Currently, Maurice is a Research affiliate at the Media Lab at MIT.

In 2013, Ashley announced he was planning the highest-stakes open chess tournament in history, Millionaire Chess Open. Its first edition took place October 9–13, 2014 in Las Vegas.

In 2015, Maurice announced a partnership with the Chess Club and Scholastic Center of Saint Louis and Ascension, Your Move Chess. This program supports after school chess in the Florissant-Ferguson School District alongside other schools in the Saint Louis area. Longer term, the goal is to expand the program on a national level.

In February 2016, a video of Ashley defeating a &quot;trash-talking&quot; amateur chess player in Washington Square Park went viral. The incident was referenced in an episode of Billions where Ashley portrayed the chess hustler.

On April 13, 2016, Ashley was inducted into the US Chess Hall of Fame along with Chess Grandmaster Gata Kamsky.

=== Commentator ===

Ashley has worked, and currently is working, as a chess commentator covering many events, including those of the Grand Chess Tour. He was one of the commentators of the two matches between world champion Garry Kasparov and IBM&#x27;s Deep Blue that took place in 1996 and 1997. He provided commentary for the Kasparov vs. Anand World Championship match in 1995. In 2003, Ashley hosted ESPN&#x27;s broadcast of Kasparov&#x27;s match against X3D Fritz. He has also served as a commentator for the 2013–19 Sinquefield Cups, several US Chess Championships, and many other chess events.

== Personal life ==
In 1993, Ashley married Michele Ashley-Johnson. Their daughter Nia was born the following year, and their son Jayden in 2002. The couple divorced in 2014.

Maurice&#x27;s sister is former world boxing champion Alicia Ashley, and his brother is former world kickboxing champion Devon Ashley.
He once stated
&quot;African[-]continent GMs do exist; but, according to the system of racial classification, I am the first Black GM in history... it matters, and doesn&#x27;t matter, all at the same time.&quot;

<doc id="161507" wikidata="Q123478185" url="?curid=161507" title="Marlin">
<text>Marlins are fish from the family Istiophoridae, which includes 11 species.

== Name ==
The family&#x27;s common name is thought to derive from their resemblance to a sailor&#x27;s marlinspike.

== Taxonomy ==
The family name Istiophoridae comes from the genus &quot;Istiophorus&quot; which first placed the species &quot;Istiophorus platypterus&quot; by George Kearsley Shaw in 1792 from the Greek word &quot;istion&quot; meaning &quot;sail&quot; that describes the shape of the species&#x27;s dorsal fins.

== Family description ==
Marlins have elongated bodies, a spear-like snout or bill, and a long, rigid dorsal fin which extends forward to form a crest.

Marlins are among the fastest marine swimmers. However, greatly exaggerated speeds are often claimed in popular literature, based on unreliable or outdated reports.

The larger species include the Atlantic blue marlin, &quot;Makaira nigricans&quot;, which can reach in length and in weight and the black marlin, &quot;Istiompax indica&quot;, which can reach in excess of in length and in weight. They are popular sporting fish in tropical areas. The Atlantic blue marlin and the white marlin are endangered due to overfishing.

Marlins can change colour, lighting up their stripes just before attacking prey.

==Classification==
The marlins are Istiophoriform fish, most closely related to the swordfish (which itself is the sole member of the family Xiphiidae). The carangiformes are believed to be the second-closest clade to marlins. Although previously thought to be closely related to Scombridae, genetic analysis only shows a slight relationship.

=== Extant genera ===

===Fossil genera===
Marlins have a continuous fossil record from the Miocene onwards, with the oldest uncontroversial fossil dated to 22 million years ago. It is thought that they probably evolved in the Paratethys Sea.

The following fossil genera are known:

* †&quot;Morgula&quot; 
* †&quot;Pizzikoskerma&quot; 
* †&quot;Prototetrapturus&quot; 
* †&quot;Sicophasma&quot; 
* †&quot;Spathochoira&quot; 

==Popular culture==

In the Nobel Prize-winning author Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s 1952 novel &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;, the central character of the work is an aged Cuban fisherman who, after 84 days without success on the water, heads out to sea to break his run of bad luck. On the 85th day, Santiago, the old fisherman, hooks a resolute marlin; what follows is a great struggle between man, sea creature, and the elements.

Frederick Forsyth&#x27;s story &quot;The Emperor&quot;, in the collection &quot;No Comebacks&quot;, tells of a bank manager named Murgatroyd, who catches a marlin and is acknowledged by the islanders of Mauritius as a master fisherman.

A marlin features prominently in the last chapter and climactic scenes of Christina Stead&#x27;s &quot;The Man Who Loved Children&quot;. Sam&#x27;s friend Saul gives Sam a marlin, and Sam makes his children help him render the fish&#x27;s fat.

The Miami Marlins, a professional baseball team based in Miami, Florida, is named after the fish.

<doc id="161508" wikidata="Q319208" url="?curid=161508" title="Yasser Seirawan">
<text>Yasser Seirawan (; born March 24, 1960) is a Syrian-born American chess grandmaster and four-time United States champion. He won the World Junior Chess Championship in 1979. Seirawan is also a published chess author and commentator.

==Early life==
Seirawan was born in Damascus, Syria. His father was Syrian and his mother an English nurse from Nottingham, where he spent some time in his early childhood. When he was seven, his family immigrated to Seattle, Washington, where he attended Queen Anne Elementary School, Meany Middle School, and Garfield High School. He honed his game at a now-defunct coffeehouse, the Last Exit on Brooklyn, playing against the likes of Latvian-born master Viktors Pupols and six-time Washington State Champion James Harley McCormick.

== Career ==
Seirawan began playing chess at 12; at 13, he became Washington junior champion. At 19, he won the World Junior Chess Championship. He also won a game against Viktor Korchnoi, who had two years earlier narrowly lost a match for the world championship. Impressed, Viktor then invited Seirawan to Switzerland, where Korchnoi was training for his 1981 world title match against Anatoly Karpov.

Seirawan qualified for the 1985 and 1988-1990 Candidates Tournaments. In the 1985 tournament in Montpellier he scored 7/15 placing joint 10th, and in the 1988–1990 tournament in St John, a knockout tournament, he was knocked out by Jon Speelman in the preliminary round.

In 1990, he won a match against Jan Timman sponsored by KRO by the score of +3-1=2.

For 12 years, he was the chief editor of the &quot;Inside Chess&quot; magazine. The magazine was sold to the ChessCafe.com website, on which old articles were featured.

In 1999, Seirawan played a ten-game match against Michael Adams in Bermuda. The match was drawn +2–2=6.

In 2001, Seirawan released a plan called &quot;Fresh Start&quot; to reunite the chess world, which at that time had two world champions: Ruslan Ponomariov had gained the title under the auspices of FIDE, while Vladimir Kramnik had beaten Garry Kasparov to take the Classical title. It called for one match between Ponomariov and Kasparov (the world number one), and another between Kramnik and the winner of the 2002 Einstein tournament in Dortmund, who turned out to be Péter Lékó. The winners of these matches would then play each other to become undisputed World Champion. This plan was signed by all parties on May 6, 2002, in the so-called &quot;Prague Agreement&quot;. The Kramnik-Leko match took place (the match was drawn, with Kramnik retaining his title); the Kasparov-Ponomariov match was canceled in 2003, and this particular plan became moot when Kasparov retired in 2005. In the end, the FIDE World Chess Championship 2006 between Kramnik and Veselin Topalov reunited the world championship title.

Following a series of events, such as Seirawan participating in the Beijing Chess Challenge in September 2003, there were reports that he would be retiring as a professional player. In the July 2007 FIDE list, Seirawan had an Elo rating of 2634, placing him in the top 100 chess players in the world, and America&#x27;s number four, behind Hikaru Nakamura, Gata Kamsky, and Alexander Onischuk. He played six games in the July 2007 FIDE update.

In 2007, Seirawan unveiled a chess variant created in collaboration with Bruce Harper, called Seirawan chess or SHARPER chess. SHARPER chess introduces two additional pieces, a &quot;hawk&quot; and an &quot;elephant&quot;—a rook/knight and a bishop/knight combination that in other variants are called the Empress and Princess, respectively. The initial position is that of standard chess. Whenever the player moves a piece from its starting position, one of the extra pieces in hand may be placed immediately on the square just vacated. Likewise, pawns may promote to a hawk or an elephant in addition to the standard pieces. The first ever event was a 12-board simultaneous exhibition held on March 31, 2007, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

In May 2011, Seirawan returned from hiatus to competitive chess, playing for the U.S. team in the world team championship in China, where he won silver in first alternate. He had wins versus top GMs Judit Polgar and Shakhriyar Mamedyarov. He only lost one game.

Seirawan won the 2011 and 2012 Dutch Open Blitz championship.

Seirawan is widely known for his expert commentary in live broadcasts on the Internet during important events. He has been named by the chess historian Edward Winter as one of the top five Internet broadcasters. In 2019, he joined the Chessbrahs and provided coverage for the 2019 World Cup.

== Books ==
Seirawan has written several books.

The &quot;Winning Chess&quot; series (with co-author IM Jeremy Silman):

*&quot;Play Winning Chess&quot; - Introduction to chess and some basic strategies
*&quot;Winning Chess Tactics&quot; - Introduction to tactics with puzzles

== Personal life ==
Seirawan is married to Woman FIDE Master Yvette Nagel, daughter of Dutch politician Jan Nagel.

== Legacy ==

The chess opening Seirawan attack (1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Bg5) is named after him. He is also known for the Seirawan line in the King&#x27;s Indian Defence (1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Bd3), where White has the plan of playing Bd3, Nge2, and O-O.

<text>Trevor Wallace Howard-Smith (29 September 1913 – 7 January 1988) was an English stage and screen actor. After varied work in the theatre, he achieved leading man star status in the film &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; (1945), followed by &quot;The Third Man&quot; (1949), portraying what BFI Screenonline called “a new kind of male lead in British films: steady, middle-class, reassuring…. but also capable of suggesting neurosis under the tweedy demeanour.”

He was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor four times, winning for &quot;The Key&quot; (1958), and an Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in &quot;Sons and Lovers&quot; (1960). His other notable film performances include &quot;Golden Salamander&quot; (1950), &quot;The Clouded Yellow&quot; (1951), &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; (1962), &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; (1968), &quot;Battle of Britain&quot; (1969), &quot;Lola&quot; (1969), &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1970), &quot;Superman&quot; (1978), &quot;Gandhi&quot; (1982), and &quot;White Mischief&quot; (1987). He was also an Emmy Award recipient, and a three-time Golden Globe nominee.

==Early life==
Howard was born in Cliftonville, Kent, England the son of Mabel Grey (Wallace) and Arthur John Howard-Smith, an insurance agent. His parents married in 1909
. Although Howard later claimed to have been born in 1916 (the year quoted by most reference sources) he was actually born in 1913 (which is supported by school and other records).

His father was an insurance underwriter for Lloyd&#x27;s of London, serving as representative in Colombo, Ceylon and elsewhere; Trevor spent the first eight years of his life travelling around the world. He was educated at Clifton College(to which he left in his will a substantial legacy for a drama scholarship) and at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). In 1933, at the end of his first year, he was chosen as best actor in his class for his performance as Benedict in a school production of &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;. While Howard was still studying, he made his professional debut at the Gate Theatre in &quot;Revolt in a Reformatory&quot; (1934).
Howard&#x27;s sister, born 1 January 1917 in India, was Merle Florence Howard-Smith, later an actress.

When he left school he worked regularly on stage, including in Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;The Rivals&quot;, several performances at Stratford-upon-Avon, and in a two-year run in the original production of &quot;French Without Tears&quot;.

==Military service==
Around 1945, journalists began to circulate stories stating that Howard had a courageous wartime service in the British Army&#x27;s Royal Corps of Signals, which earned him much respect among fellow actors and fans. The police visited Howard, warning him that it was a crime to claim a medal under the Army Act, but Howard assured them he was not the source of the stories. In fact, he &quot;did his best to dodge the call-up&quot;, and journalist Terrence Pettigrew, in his 2001 biography of Howard, recounted that files held in the Public Record Office revealed he was actually discharged from the British Army in 1943 for mental instability and having a &quot;psychopathic personality&quot;, on account of having &quot;lied about his background, from his schooldays onward ... determinedly&quot;. Initially Howard&#x27;s widow, actress Helen Cherry, denied this, but after being confronted with the official records, she said that Howard&#x27;s mother had claimed he was a holder of the Military Cross, adding that her late husband had an honourable military record with &quot;nothing to be ashamed of&quot;.

Per &quot;The London Gazette&quot;, Trevor Wallace Howard-Smith (247202) was commissioned into the South Staffordshire Regiment as a Second lieutenant effective 3 October 1942, relinquishing his commission on 2 October 1943 &quot;on account of &quot;ill-health&quot;, still a Second Lieutenant. This contradicted the post-war stories that he had won the Military Cross and high promotion.

==Career==
After a theatrical role in &quot;The Recruiting Officer&quot; (1943), Howard began working in films with an uncredited part &quot;The Way Ahead&quot; (1944), directed by Carol Reed. He was in a big stage hit, &quot;A Soldier for Christmas&quot; (1944), and a production of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Anna Christie&quot; (1944). Howard received his first film credit for &quot;The Way to the Stars&quot; (1945), playing a pilot.

Howard&#x27;s performance in &quot;The Way Ahead&quot; came to the attention of David Lean, who was looking for someone to play the role of Alec in &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; (1945). Lean recommended him to Noël Coward, who agreed with the suggestion, and the success of the film launched Howard&#x27;s film career.

He followed it with &quot;I See a Dark Stranger&quot; (1946) with Deborah Kerr, and &quot;Green for Danger&quot; (1947), starring Alastair Sim. Both films were successful as was &quot;They Made Me a Fugitive&quot; (1947). That year British exhibitors voted Howard the 10th most popular British star at the box office. &quot;So Well Remembered&quot; (1948) was made with American talent and money and was a hit in Britain but lost money overall. Howard was reunited with Lean for &quot;The Passionate Friends&quot; (1949), but the film was not a success.

However, &quot;The Third Man&quot; (1949), which Howard starred in alongside Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten for Carol Reed from a story by Graham Greene, was a huge international success, and became the film of which Howard was most proud. 

During filming of &quot;The Third Man&quot; in Vienna, Howard was keen to get to his favourite bar each night, for a drink, as soon as filming had finished for the evening. On one occasion, Howard was in too much of a hurry to even bother changing out of his costume, which was the uniform of a British Army major. After a few drinks, he got into an argument that attracted the attention of the Royal Military Police, who detained him for impersonating a British officer. The MPs, being non-commissioned officers, had to summon an officer to actually perform the arrest. On the lieutenant&#x27;s arrival the matter was settled with apologies all around.

Howard was the lead in &quot;Golden Salamander&quot; (1950) and played Peter Churchill in &quot;Odette&quot; (1950) with Anna Neagle, a big hit in Britain. It was directed by Herbert Wilcox who put Howard under contract. He loaned Howard to Betty Box and Ralph Thomas to make &quot;The Clouded Yellow&quot; (1950), a popular thriller with Jean Simmons. These films helped Howard be voted the 2nd biggest British star at the box office in 1950 and the 5th biggest (and eleventh bigger over-all) in 1951.

Howard was reunited with Carol Reed for &quot;Outcast of the Islands&quot; (1952) and he made a war film, &quot;Gift Horse&quot; (1952). That year he made his final appearance on the list of Britain&#x27;s ten most popular actors, coming in at number nine. He was in another adaptation of a Graham Greene story, &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot; (1953). Greene also wrote and produced Howard&#x27;s next film, the British-Italian &quot;The Stranger&#x27;s Hand&quot; (1954).
Howard was in a French movie, &quot;The Lovers of Lisbon&quot; (1955), then supported Jose Ferrer in a war film from Warwick Pictures, &quot;The Cockleshell Heroes&quot; (1955), which was popular in Britain.

Howard&#x27;s first Hollywood film was &quot;Run for the Sun&quot; (1956), where he played a villain to Richard Widmark&#x27;s hero. He made a cameo in &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; (1956) and again played a villain to an American star, Victor Mature, in Warwick&#x27;s &quot;Interpol&quot; (1957).

Howard starred in &quot;Manuela&quot; (1957) then supported William Holden in Carol Reed&#x27;s &quot;The Key&quot; (1958), for which he received the Best Actor award from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. When William Holden dropped out of the lead of &quot;The Roots of Heaven&quot; (1958), Howard stepped in as his first opportunity at a starring role in a Hollywood film (although top billing still went to Errol Flynn).

After a thriller &quot;Moment of Danger&quot; (1960) he was in &quot;Sons and Lovers&quot; (1960), for which he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor. He was nominated for a BAFTA on four other occasions. and received two other Emmy nominations, one as a lead and the other as a supporting actor. He also received three Golden Globe Award nominations.

Howard was reunited with Holden for &quot;The Lion&quot; (1962). He was Captain Bligh to Marlon Brando&#x27;s Fletcher Christian in MGM&#x27;s remake of &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; (1962). He was in a TV movie production of &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; (1962) and played the title prime minister in &quot;The Invincible Mr Disraeli&quot; (1963), an episode of the &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; for which he won an Emmy Award for his role then supported Robert Mitchum in &quot;Man in the Middle&quot; (1964) and Cary Grant in &quot;Father Goose&quot; (1964). After a cameo in &quot;Operation Crossbow&quot; (1965), Howard supported Frank Sinatra in &quot;Von Ryan&#x27;s Express&quot; (1965), Brando and Yul Brynner in &quot;Morituri&quot; (1965), and Rod Taylor in &quot;The Liquidator&quot; (1965). After a leading role in &quot;The Poppy Is Also a Flower&quot; (1966) he made two movies with Brynner, &quot;Triple Cross&quot; (1966) and &quot;The Long Duel&quot; (1967).

Howard had a change of pace supporting Hayley Mills in &quot;Pretty Polly&quot; (1968). He went back to military roles: &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; (1968), as Lord Cardigan, and &quot;Battle of Britain&quot; (1969), as Air Vice Marshal Keith Park. He had support parts in &quot;Lola&quot; (1969) and &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1970), the latter for David Lean.

He made a Swedish film &quot;The Night Visitor&quot; (1971) then settled into a career as a character actor: &quot;To Catch a Spy&quot; (1971), supporting Kirk Douglas; &quot;Mary, Queen of Scots&quot; (1971), as Sir William Cecil; &quot;Kidnapped&quot; (1971); &quot;Pope Joan&quot; (1972); &quot;Ludwig&quot; (1972); &quot;The Offence&quot; (1972), with Sean Connery; &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; (1973), for Joseph Losey; &quot;Who?&quot; (1974), supporting Elliott Gould; and &quot;Catholics&quot; (1974) for British TV.

He appeared in some horror films – &quot;Craze&quot; (1974), &quot;Persecution&quot; (1974) – and the more prestigious &quot;11 Harrowhouse&quot; (1974), in which his wife Helen Cherry starred with him. In &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo (1975)&quot;, he mentored Richard Chamberlain. He played military men in &quot;Hennessy&quot; (1975) and &quot;Conduct Unbecoming&quot; (1975). Around this time he complained that he had to work so hard because of the high rate of tax in Britain.

Howard could be found in &quot;Albino&quot; (1976), shot in Rhodesia; &quot;The Bawdy Adventures of Tom Jones&quot; (1976); &quot;Aces High&quot; (1976); &quot;Eliza Fraser&quot; (1976), shot in Australia; &quot;The Last Remake of Beau Geste&quot; (1977); and &quot;Stevie&quot; (1978). He was one of many names in &quot;Superman&quot; (1978), &quot;Hurricane&quot; (1979), &quot;Meteor&quot; (1979) and &quot;The Sea Wolves&quot; (1980). He appeared in a TV series &quot;Shillingbury Tales&quot; (1980–81). One of his strangest films, and one he took great delight in, was Vivian Stanshall&#x27;s &quot;Sir Henry at Rawlinson End&quot; (1980), in which he played the title role. He and Celia Johnson from &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; were reunited in &quot;Staying On&quot; (1980) for British TV.

Howard was also top-billed in &quot;Windwalker&quot; (1981).

==Final years==
Howard appeared in some prestigious movies towards the end of his career: &quot;The Deadly Game&quot; (1982), &quot;The Missionary&quot; (1982), &quot;Gandhi&quot; (1982), &quot;George Washington&quot; (1984), &quot;Shaka Zulu&quot; (1986), &quot;Dust&quot; (1985), and &quot;Peter the Great&quot; (1986).

At the time of filming &quot;White Mischief&quot; (1988) on location in Kenya during 1987, Howard was seriously ill and suffering from alcoholism. The company wanted to sack him, but co-star Sarah Miles was determined that Howard&#x27;s distinguished film career would not end that way. In an interview with Terence Pettigrew for his biography of Howard, Miles describes how she gave an ultimatum to the executives, threatening to quit the production if they got rid of him. His final film role was in &quot;The Dawning&quot; in 1988.

Throughout his film career Howard insisted that all his contracts include a clause excusing him from work whenever a cricket Test match was being played.

Howard recorded two Shakespeare performances, the first, recorded in the 1960s, was as Petruchio opposite Margaret Leighton&#x27;s Kate in Caedmon Records&#x27; complete recording of &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;; the second was in the title role of &quot;King Lear&quot; for the BBC World Service in 1986.

==Personal life==
He married stage and screen actress Helen Cherry. 

A British government document leaked to the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; in 2003 showed that Howard was among almost 300 people to decline an official honour of the United Kingdom. He declined to be made a CBE in 1982.

==Death==
Howard died, aged 74, at his home in Arkley, Barnet on 7 January 1988. The cause of death was hepatic failure and cirrhosis of the liver.

<text>The Beijing Spring () refers to a brief period of political liberalization during the &quot;Boluan Fanzheng&quot; period in the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC). It began as the Democracy Wall movement in Beijing, which occurred in 1978 and 1979, right after the end of the Chinese Cultural Revolution. The name is derived from &quot;Prague Spring&quot;, an analogous event which occurred in Czechoslovakia in 1968.

==History==
During the Beijing Spring, the general public was allowed greater freedom to criticize the government than the Chinese people had previously been allowed under the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Most of this criticism was directed towards the Cultural Revolution and the government&#x27;s behavior during that time. It was made public with the Democracy Wall Movement, a Chinese democracy movement.

===1990s===
The phrase &quot;Beijing Spring&quot; was also used during a more recent period of political thaw in the PRC from September 1997 to mid November 1998. During this &#x27;new Beijing Spring&#x27; the Chinese authorities relaxed some control over political expression and organisation. The relatively trouble-free handover of Hong Kong to China from the United Kingdom and the death of Deng Xiaoping in early 1997 were precursors to this brief period of liberalisation.

It was during this second &quot;Beijing Spring&quot; that the China Democracy Party was founded and legally registered by some local authorities. The Democracy Wall Movement dissident Wei Jingsheng was released and exiled, China signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and China was visited by US President Bill Clinton and UN Human Rights Commissioner Mary Robinson at this time. By the end of 1998 the government had again cracked down on leading dissidents and those involved in the fledgling opposition Chinese Democracy Party.

<doc id="161515" wikidata="Q382890" url="?curid=161515" title="Oasis (band)">
<text>Oasis are an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1991. The group initially consisted of Liam Gallagher (lead vocals), Paul &quot;Bonehead&quot; Arthurs (guitar), Paul &quot;Guigsy&quot; McGuigan (bass guitar) and Tony McCarroll (drums). Liam asked his older brother Noel Gallagher (lead guitar, vocals) to join as a fifth member a few months later to finalise their formation. Noel became the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the group and took over the songwriting duties for the band&#x27;s first four albums. They are regarded as one of the defining and most globally successful groups of the Britpop genre. 

Oasis signed to independent record label Creation Records in 1993 and released their record-setting debut album &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot; (1994), which topped the UK Albums Chart and quickly became the fastest-selling debut album in British history at the time. The following year, they released &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot; (1995) with new drummer Alan White in the midst of a highly publicised chart rivalry with peers Blur, dubbed by the British media as the &quot;Battle of Britpop&quot;. Spending ten weeks at number one on the British charts, &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot; was also an international chart success and became one of the best-selling albums of all time, the fifth-best-selling album in the UK and the best-selling album in the UK of the 1990s. The Gallagher brothers featured regularly in tabloid newspapers throughout the 1990s for their public disputes and wild lifestyles. In 1996, Oasis performed two nights at Knebworth for an audience of 125,000 each time, the largest outdoor concerts in UK history at the time. In 1997, Oasis released their highly anticipated third studio album, &quot;Be Here Now&quot;, which became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history but retrospectively was seen as a critical disappointment.

Founding members Arthurs and McGuigan left in 1999 during the recording of the band&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Standing on the Shoulder of Giants&quot; (2000). They were replaced by former Heavy Stereo guitarist Gem Archer on guitar and former Ride guitarist Andy Bell on bass guitar. White departed in 2004, replaced by guest drummer Zak Starkey, and later by Chris Sharrock. Oasis released three more studio albums in the 2000s: &quot;Heathen Chemistry&quot; (2002), &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe the Truth&quot; (2005) and &quot;Dig Out Your Soul&quot; (2008). The group abruptly disbanded in 2009 after the sudden departure of Noel Gallagher. The remaining members of the band continued under the name Beady Eye until their disbandment in 2014. Both Gallagher brothers have since had successful solo careers. In 2024, Oasis announced that they would reform in 2025 for worldwide performances as part of the Oasis Live &#x27;25 Tour.

As of 2022, Oasis had sold over 70 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. They are among the most successful acts in the history of the UK singles chart and the UK Albums Chart, with eight UK number-one singles and eight UK number-one albums. The band also achieved three Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)-certified Platinum albums in the US. They won 17 &quot;NME&quot; Awards, nine Q Awards, four MTV Europe Music Awards and six Brit Awards, including one in 2007 for Outstanding Contribution to Music and one for the &quot;Best Album of the Last 30 Years&quot; for &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot;. They were also nominated for two Grammy Awards.

==History==
===1991–1993: Formation and early years ===
In 1991, bassist Paul McGuigan, guitarist Paul Arthurs, drummer Tony McCarroll, and singer Chris Hutton formed a band called the Rain. Unsatisfied with Hutton, Arthurs invited and auditioned acquaintance Liam Gallagher as a potential replacement. Liam suggested that the band name be changed to Oasis, inspired by an Inspiral Carpets tour poster in the childhood bedroom he shared with his brother Noel, which listed the Oasis Leisure Centre in Swindon as a venue. Oasis played their first gig on 14 August 1991 at the Boardwalk club in Manchester, bottom of the bill below the Catchmen and Sweet Jesus. Noel, who was working as a roadie for Inspiral Carpets, went with them to watch Liam&#x27;s band play, and he was impressed with what he heard.

Noel approached the group about joining on the provision that he would become the band&#x27;s sole songwriter and leader, and that they would commit to an earnest pursuit of commercial success. Arthurs recalled, &quot;He had loads of stuff written. When he walked in, we were a band making a racket with four tunes. All of a sudden, there were loads of ideas.&quot; Under Noel, the band crafted a musical approach that relied on simplicity, with Arthurs and McGuigan restricted to playing barre chords and root bass notes, McCarroll playing basic rhythms, and the band&#x27;s amplifiers turned up to create distortion. Oasis thus created a sound described as being &quot;so devoid of finesse and complexity that it came out sounding pretty much unstoppable&quot;.

=== 1993–1994: Breakthrough with &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot; ===
After over a year of live shows, rehearsals and a recording of a demo, the &quot;Live Demonstration&quot; tape, in May 1993, Oasis were spotted by the Creation Records co-owner Alan McGee. Oasis were invited to play a gig at King Tut&#x27;s Wah Wah Hut club in Glasgow by Sister Lovers, who shared their rehearsal rooms. Oasis, along with a group of friends, hired a van and made the journey to Glasgow. When they arrived, they were refused entry as they were not on that night&#x27;s set list. They and McGee have given contradicting statements about how they entered the club. They were given the opening slot and impressed McGee, who was there to see 18 Wheeler, and Sister Lovers, whose member Debbie Turner was a close friend of McGee&#x27;s from his days frequenting the Haçienda in Manchester. McGee offered them a recording contract; however, they did not sign until several months later. Due to problems securing an American contract, Oasis signed a worldwide contract with Sony, which in turn licensed Oasis to Creation in the UK.

Following a limited white label release of the demo of their song &quot;Columbia&quot;, Oasis went on a UK tour to promote the release of their first single, &quot;Supersonic&quot;, playing venues such as the Tunbridge Wells Forum, a converted public toilet. &quot;Supersonic&quot; was released in April 1994, reaching number 31 in the charts. The release was followed by &quot;Shakermaker&quot;, which became the subject of a plagiarism suit, with Oasis paying $500,000 in damages. Their third single, &quot;Live Forever&quot;, was their first to enter the top ten of the UK Singles Chart. After troubled recording and mixing sessions, Oasis&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot;, was released on 29 August 1994. It entered the UK Albums Chart at number one within a week of its release, and at the time becoming the fastest selling debut album in the UK.

Nearly a year of constant live performances and recordings, along with a hedonistic lifestyle, damaged the band. This behaviour culminated during a gig in Los Angeles in September 1994, leading to an inept performance by Liam during which he made offensive remarks about American audiences and hit Noel with a tambourine. Upset, Noel temporarily quit the band and flew to San Francisco (it was from this incident the song &quot;Talk Tonight&quot; was written). He was tracked down by Creation&#x27;s Tim Abbot and they made a trip to Las Vegas. Once there, he was persuaded to continue with the band. He reconciled with Liam and the tour resumed in Minneapolis. The group followed up with the fourth single from &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot;, &quot;Cigarettes &amp; Alcohol&quot;, and the Christmas single &quot;Whatever&quot;, issued in December 1994, which entered the British charts at number three.

===1995–1996: &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot;, international success, and peak popularity===
In April 1995, &quot;Some Might Say&quot; became their first number-one UK single. At the same time, McCarroll was ousted from the band. He said he was &quot;unlawfully expelled from the partnership&quot; for what he called a &quot;personality clash&quot; with the brothers. The Gallaghers were critical of McCarroll&#x27;s musical ability, with Noel saying: &quot;I like Tony as a geezer but he wouldn&#x27;t have been able to drum the new songs.&quot; He was replaced by Alan White, formerly of Starclub and the brother of the percussionist Steve White, who was recommended to Noel by Paul Weller. White made his debut with Oasis on a &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; performance of &quot;Some Might Say&quot;. 

Oasis began recording material for their second album that May in Rockfield Studios near Monmouth. During this period, the British press seized upon a supposed rivalry between Oasis and another Britpop band, Blur. Previously, Oasis had not associated with the Britpop movement and were not invited to perform on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Britpop Now&quot; programme introduced by Blur&#x27;s singer, Damon Albarn. On 14 August 1995, Blur and Oasis released singles on the same day, setting up the &quot;Battle of Britpop&quot; that dominated the national news. Blur&#x27;s &quot;Country House&quot; outsold Oasis&#x27;s &quot;Roll with It&quot; 274,000 copies to 216,000 during the week. Oasis&#x27;s management argued that &quot;Country House&quot; had sold more because it was less expensive (£1.99 vs £3.99) and because there were two versions of the &quot;Country House&quot; single, with different B-sides, forcing fans to buy two copies. Creation said there were problems with the barcode on the &quot;Roll with It&quot; single case, which did not record all sales. Noel Gallagher told &quot;The Observer&quot; in September that he hoped members of Blur would &quot;catch AIDS and die&quot;, which caused a media furore. He apologised in a formal letter to various publications.
McGuigan briefly left Oasis in September 1995, citing nervous exhaustion. He was replaced by Scott McLeod, formerly of the Ya Ya&#x27;s, who was featured on some of the tour dates as well as in the &quot;Wonderwall&quot; video before leaving abruptly while on tour in the US. McLeod contacted Noel, saying he felt he had made the wrong decision. Noel replied: &quot;I think you have, too. Good luck signing on.&quot;

Although a softer sound initially led to mixed reviews, Oasis&#x27;s second album, &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot;, was a worldwide commercial success, selling over four million copies and becoming the fifth-best-selling album in UK chart history. By 2008, it had sold up to 22 million copies globally, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. The album produced two more singles, &quot;Wonderwall&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back in Anger&quot;, which reached numbers two and one. It also contained &quot;Champagne Supernova&quot;, which featured guitar and backing vocals by Paul Weller and received critical acclaim. The song reached number one on the US Modern Rock Tracks chart. In November 1995, Oasis played on back-to-back nights at Earls Court in London, the biggest ever indoor gigs in Europe at the time. Noel played a customised Sheraton guitar emblazoned with a Union Jack, commercially released by Epiphone as the &quot;Supernova&quot;.

On 27 and 28 April 1996, Oasis played their first headline outdoor concerts, at Maine Road football stadium, home of Manchester City F.C., of whom the Gallagher brothers had been fans since childhood. Highlights from the second night featured on the video &quot;...There and Then&quot;, released later the same year (along with footage from their Earls Court gigs). As their career reached its zenith, Oasis performed to 80,000 people over two nights at Balloch Country Park at Loch Lomond in Scotland on 3 and 4 August, before back-to-back concerts at Knebworth House on 10 and 11 August. The band sold out both shows within minutes. The audience of 125,000 people each night (2.5 million people applied for tickets, and 250,000 were actually sold, meaning the possibility of 20 sold out nights) was a record-breaking number for an outdoor concert held in the UK and remains the largest demand for a show in British history.

Oasis were due to record an episode of &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; at the Royal Festival Hall but Liam pulled out, citing a sore throat. He watched the performance from a balcony with beer and cigarettes, heckling Noel&#x27;s singing between songs. Four days later the group left for a tour of American arenas but Liam refused to go; the band decided to continue the tour with Noel on vocals. Liam rejoined the tour on 30 August and on 4 September 1996, Oasis performed &quot;Champagne Supernova&quot; at the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. Liam made gestures at Noel during his guitar solo, then spat beer all over the stage before storming off. A few weeks later Noel flew home without the band, who followed on another flight. This event prompted media speculation that the group were splitting up. The brothers soon reconciled and decided to complete the tour.

===1996–1999: &quot;Be Here Now&quot; and &quot;The Masterplan&quot;===

Oasis spent the end of 1996 and the first quarter of 1997 at Abbey Road Studios in London and Ridge Farm Studios in Surrey recording their third album. Quarrels between the Gallagher brothers plagued the recording sessions. &quot;Be Here Now&quot; was released in August 1997. Preceded by the UK number one single &quot;D&#x27;You Know What I Mean?&quot;, the album was their most anticipated effort, and as such became the subject of considerable media attention. Footage of excited fans clutching copies made &quot;ITV News at Ten&quot;, leading anchorman Trevor McDonald to intone the band&#x27;s phrase &quot;mad for it&quot;. By the end of the first day of release, &quot;Be Here Now&quot; had sold 424,000 units and first week sales reached 696,000, making it the fastest-selling album in British history until Adele released &quot;25&quot; in 2015. The album debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the US, but its first week sales of 152,000—below expected sales of 400,000 copies—were considered a disappointment. Predominantly written by Noel Gallagher during a holiday with Kate Moss, Johnny Depp and Mick Jagger, Gallagher has since expressed regret over the writing process of &quot;Be Here Now&quot;, adding it doesn&#x27;t match up to the standard of the band&#x27;s first two albums;

Noel had been ambivalent about the album in pre-release interviews, telling &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;This record ain&#x27;t going to surprise many people.&quot; However, there was nobody around him to echo his reservations. &quot;Everyone&#x27;s going: &#x27;It&#x27;s brilliant!&#x27;&quot; he later said. &quot;And right towards the end, we&#x27;re doing the mixing and I&#x27;m thinking to myself: &#x27;Hmmm, I don&#x27;t know about this now.&#x27;&quot; When the album was released Oasis were woven into Britain&#x27;s cultural fabric like no other band since the Beatles, and according to their former press officer Johnny Hopkins: &quot;There were more hangers-on, constantly telling them they were the greatest thing. That tended to block out the critical voices.&quot; Dorian Lynskey writes, &quot;If it couldn&#x27;t be Britpop&#x27;s zenith, then it must be the nadir. It can&#x27;t be just a collection of songs – some good, some bad, most too long, all insanely overproduced – but an emblem of the hubris before the fall, like a dictator&#x27;s statue pulled to the ground by a vengeful mob.&quot; 

After the conclusion of the Be Here Now Tour in early 1998, amidst much media criticism, the group kept a low profile. Later in the year, Oasis released a compilation album of fourteen B-sides, &quot;The Masterplan&quot;. &quot;The really interesting stuff from around that period is the B-sides. There&#x27;s a lot more inspired music on the B-sides than there is on &quot;Be Here Now&quot; itself, I think,&quot; said Noel in an interview in 2008.

===1999–2001: Line-up change and &quot;Standing on the Shoulder of Giants&quot;===
In early 1999, the band began work on their fourth studio album. First details were announced in February, with Mark Stent revealed to be taking a co-producing role. Things were not going well and the shock departure of founding member Paul &quot;Bonehead&quot; Arthurs was announced in August. This departure was reported at the time as amicable, with Noel stating Arthurs wanted to spend more time with his family. Arthurs&#x27; statement clarified his leaving as &quot;to concentrate on other things&quot;. However, Noel has since offered a contradicting version: that a series of violations of Noel&#x27;s &quot;no drink or drugs&quot; policy (imposed by Noel so that Liam could sing properly) for the album&#x27;s sessions resulted in a confrontation between the two. Two weeks later the departure of bassist Paul McGuigan was announced. The Gallagher brothers held a press conference shortly thereafter, in which they assured reporters that &quot;the future of Oasis is secure. The story and the glory will go on.&quot;
After the completion of the recording sessions, the band began searching for replacement members. The first new member to be announced was new lead/rhythm guitarist Colin &quot;Gem&quot; Archer, formerly of Heavy Stereo, who later claimed to have been approached by Noel Gallagher only a couple of days after Arthurs&#x27; departure was publicly announced. Finding a replacement bassist took more time and effort: the band were rehearsing with David Potts, but he quickly resigned, and they brought in Andy Bell, former guitarist/songwriter of Ride and Hurricane #1 as their new bassist. Bell had never played bass before and had to learn to play it (with Noel since saying, &quot;I was amazed that Andy was up for actually playing the bass y&#x27;know, cos he&#x27;s such a good guitarist&quot;), along with a handful of songs from Oasis&#x27;s back catalogue, in preparation for a scheduled US tour in December 1999.

With the folding of Creation Records, Oasis formed their own label, Big Brother, which released all of Oasis&#x27;s subsequent records in the UK and Ireland. Oasis&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Standing on the Shoulder of Giants&quot;, was released in February 2000 to good first-week sales. It reached number one on the British charts and peaked at number 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. Four singles were released from the album: &quot;Go Let It Out&quot;, &quot;Who Feels Love?&quot;, &quot;Sunday Morning Call&quot; and &quot;Where Did It All Go Wrong?&quot;, of which the first three were top five UK singles. The &quot;Go Let It Out&quot; music video was shot before Bell joined the group and therefore featured the unusual line-up of Liam on rhythm guitar, Archer on lead guitar and Noel on bass. With the departure of the founding members, the band made several small changes to their image and sound. The cover featured a new &quot;Oasis&quot; logo, designed by Gem Archer, and the album was also the first Oasis release to include a song written by Liam Gallagher, entitled &quot;Little James&quot;. The songs also had more experimental, psychedelic influences. &quot;Standing on the Shoulder of Giants&quot; received lukewarm reviews and sales slumped in its second week of release in the US. 

To support the record the band staged an eventful world tour. While touring in Barcelona in 2000, Oasis were forced to cancel a gig when an attack of tendinitis caused Alan White&#x27;s arm to seize up, and the band spent the night drinking instead. After a row between the two brothers, Noel declared he was quitting touring overseas altogether, and Oasis were supposed to finish the tour without him. Noel eventually returned for the Irish and British legs of the tour, which included two major shows at Wembley Stadium. A live album of the first show, called &quot;Familiar to Millions&quot;, was released in late 2000 to mixed reviews.

===2001–2003: &quot;Heathen Chemistry&quot;===

Throughout 2001, Oasis split time between sessions for their fifth studio album and live shows around the world. Gigs included the month-long Tour of Brotherly Love with the Black Crowes and Spacehog and a show in Paris supporting Neil Young. The album, &quot;Heathen Chemistry&quot;, Oasis&#x27;s first album with new members Andy Bell and Gem Archer, was released in July 2002. The album reached number 1 in the UK and number 23 in the US, although critics gave it mixed reviews. There were four singles released from the album: &quot;The Hindu Times&quot;, &quot;Stop Crying Your Heart Out&quot;, &quot;Little by Little/She Is Love&quot; which were written by Noel, and &quot;Songbird&quot;, written by Liam and the first single not to be written by Noel. The record blended the band&#x27;s sonic experiments from their last albums, but also went for a more basic rock sound. The recording of &quot;Heathen Chemistry&quot; was much more balanced for the band, with all of the members, apart from White, writing songs. Johnny Marr provided additional guitar as well as backup vocals on a couple of songs.

After the album&#x27;s release, the band embarked on a successful world tour that was once again filled with incidents. In August 2002, while the band were on tour in the US, Noel, Bell and touring keyboardist Jay Darlington were involved in a car accident in Indianapolis. While none of the band members sustained any major injuries, some shows were cancelled as a result. In December 2002, the latter half of the German leg of the band&#x27;s European tour had to be postponed after Liam Gallagher, Alan White and three other members of the band&#x27;s entourage were arrested after a violent brawl at a Munich nightclub. The band had been drinking heavily and tests showed that Liam had used cocaine. Liam lost two front teeth and kicked a police officer in the ribs, while Alan suffered minor head injuries after getting hit with an ashtray. Two years later Liam was fined around £40,000. The band finished their tour in March 2003 after returning to those postponed dates.

===2003–2007: Alan White&#x27;s departure and &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe the Truth&quot;===
Oasis began recording a sixth album in late December 2003 with producers Death in Vegas at Sawmills Studios in Cornwall. The album was originally planned for a September 2004 release, to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the release of &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot;, However, long-time drummer Alan White, who at this time had played on nearly all of the band&#x27;s material, had been asked to leave the band. At the time, his brother Steve White stated on his own website that &quot;the spirit of being in a band was kicked out of him&quot; and he wanted to be with his girlfriend. White was replaced by Zak Starkey, the Who&#x27;s drummer and the son of the Beatles&#x27; drummer, Ringo Starr. Though Starkey performed on studio recordings and toured with the band, he was not officially a member and the band were a four-piece for the first time in their career. Starkey played publicly for the first time at Poole Lighthouse.

A few days later, Oasis, with Starkey, headlined the Glastonbury Festival for the second time in their career and performed a largely greatest hits set, which included two new songs — Gem Archer&#x27;s &quot;A Bell Will Ring&quot; and Liam Gallagher&#x27;s &quot;The Meaning of Soul&quot;. The performance received negative reviews, with &quot;NME&quot; calling it a &quot;disaster&quot;. The BBC&#x27;s Tom Bishop called Oasis&#x27;s set &quot;lacklustre and uneventful ... prompting a mixed reception from fans&quot;, mainly because of Liam&#x27;s uninspired singing and Starkey&#x27;s lack of experience with the band&#x27;s material.

After much turbulence, the band&#x27;s sixth album was finally recorded in Los Angeles-based Capitol Studios from October to December the same year. Producer Dave Sardy took over the lead producing role from Noel, who decided to step back from these duties after a decade of producing leadership over the band. In May 2005, after three years and as many scrapped recording sessions, the band released their sixth studio album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe the Truth&quot;, fulfilling their contract with Sony BMG. It followed the path of &quot;Heathen Chemistry&quot; as being a collaborative project again, rather than a Noel-written album. The album was the first in a decade not to feature drumming by Alan White, marking the recording debut of Starkey. The record was generally hailed as the band&#x27;s best effort since &quot;Morning Glory&quot; by fans and critics alike, spawning two UK number one singles: &quot;Lyla&quot; and &quot;The Importance of Being Idle&quot;, whilst &quot;Let There Be Love&quot; entered at number 2. Oasis picked up two awards at the Q Awards: one People&#x27;s Choice Award and the second for &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe the Truth&quot; as Best Album. Following in the footsteps of Oasis&#x27;s previous five albums, &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe the Truth&quot; also entered the UK album charts at number one. By 2013 the album had sold more than six million copies worldwide.
In May 2005, the band&#x27;s new line-up embarked on a large scale world tour. Beginning on 10 May 2005 at the London Astoria, and finishing on 31 March 2006 in front of a sold-out gig in Mexico City, Oasis played more live shows than at any time since the Definitely Maybe Tour, visiting 26 countries and headlining 113 shows for over 3.2 million people. The tour passed without any major incidents and was the band&#x27;s most successful in more than a decade. The tour included sold-out shows at New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden and LA&#x27;s Hollywood Bowl. A rockumentary film made during the tour, entitled &quot;Lord Don&#x27;t Slow Me Down&quot; directed by Baillie Walsh was released in October 2007.

Oasis released a compilation double album entitled &quot;Stop the Clocks&quot; in 2006, featuring what the band considers to be their &quot;definitive&quot; songs. The band received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music in February 2007, playing several of their most famous songs afterwards. Oasis released their first ever digital-only release, &quot;Lord Don&#x27;t Slow Me Down&quot;, in October 2007. The song debuted at number ten in the UK singles chart.

===2007–2009: &quot;Dig Out Your Soul&quot;===
The band&#x27;s resurgence in popularity since the success of &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe the Truth&quot; was highlighted in February 2008 when, in a poll to find the fifty greatest British albums of the last fifty years conducted by &quot;Q&quot; magazine and HMV, two Oasis albums were voted first and second (&quot;Definitely Maybe&quot; and &quot;(What&#x27;s The Story) Morning Glory?&quot; respectively). Two other albums by the band appeared in the list – &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe The Truth&quot; came in at number fourteen, and the album that has previously been heavily criticised by some of the media, &quot;Be Here Now&quot;, made the list at no. 22.
Oasis recorded for a couple of months in 2007 – between July and September – completing work on two new songs and demoing the rest. They then took a two-month break because of the birth of Noel&#x27;s son. The band re-entered the studio on 5 November 2007 and finished recording around March 2008 with producer Dave Sardy.

In May 2008, Zak Starkey left the band after recording &quot;Dig Out Your Soul&quot;, the band&#x27;s seventh studio album. He was replaced by former Icicle Works and the La&#x27;s drummer Chris Sharrock on their tour but Chris was not an official member of the band and Oasis remained as a four-piece. The first single from the record was &quot;The Shock of the Lightning&quot; written by Noel Gallagher, and was pre-released on 29 September 2008. &quot;Dig Out Your Soul&quot;, the band&#x27;s seventh studio album, was released on 6 October and went to number one in the UK and number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The band started touring for a projected 18-month-long tour expected to last till September 2009, with support from Kasabian, the Enemy and Twisted Wheel. On 7 September 2008, while performing at Virgin Festival in Toronto, a member of the audience ran on stage and physically assaulted Noel. Noel suffered three broken and dislodged ribs as a result from the attack, and the group had to cancel several shows while he recovered. In June 2008, the band re-signed with Sony BMG for a three-album deal.

On 25 February 2009, Oasis received the NME Award for Best British Band of 2009, as well as Best Blog for Noel&#x27;s &#x27;Tales from the Middle of Nowhere&#x27;. On 4 June 2009, Oasis played the first of three concerts at Manchester&#x27;s Heaton Park and after having to leave the stage twice due to a generator failure, came on the third time to declare the gig was now a free concert; it delighted the 70,000 ticket holders, 20,000 of whom claimed the refund. The band&#x27;s two following gigs at the venue, on 6 and 7 June, proved a great success, with fans turning out in the thousands despite the changeable weather and first night&#x27;s sound issues.

===2009–2024: Split and aftermath===
After Liam contracted laryngitis, Oasis cancelled a gig at V Festival in Chelmsford on 23 August 2009. Noel stated in 2011 that the gig was cancelled due to Liam having &quot;a hangover&quot;. Liam subsequently sued Noel, and demanded an apology, stating: &quot;The truth is I had laryngitis, which Noel was made fully aware of that morning, diagnosed by a doctor.&quot; Noel issued an apology and the lawsuit was dropped. The band were due to perform on 28 August 2009 at the Rock en Seine festival near Paris, however mid-way through Bloc Party&#x27;s set at the festival their frontman Kele Okereke (alongside Bloc Party tour manager Peter Hill) announced that Oasis would not be performing. Two hours later, a statement from Noel appeared on the band&#x27;s website:

Liam and the remaining members of Oasis decided to continue under the name Beady Eye, releasing two studio albums until their break-up in 2014. Liam started a solo career and has released three studio albums, with Arthurs joining him occasionally on tour. Noel formed a solo project, Noel Gallagher&#x27;s High Flying Birds and has released four studio albums, with Sharrock and Archer later joining as members. Bell reunited with former band Ride.

On 16 February 2010, Oasis won Best British Album of the Last 30 Years – for &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot; – at the 2010 Brit Awards. Liam collected the award alone before presenting his speech, which thanked Bonehead, McGuigan and Alan White but not Noel, and throwing his microphone and the band&#x27;s award into the crowd; he later defended his actions. &quot;Time Flies... 1994–2009&quot;, a compilation of singles, was released on 14 June 2010. It became the band&#x27;s final album to reach number one on the UK Albums Chart. A remastered 3-disc version of &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot; was released on 19 May 2014.
A documentary titled &quot;&quot; was released on 26 October 2016, which tells the story of Oasis from their beginnings to the height of their fame during the summer of 1996. Another concert documentary film was released in September 2021, in celebration of the 25th anniversary of Oasis&#x27;s two record breaking concerts at Knebworth Park in August 1996. A new demo recording, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop...&quot;, previously only known from a recording during a soundcheck in Hong Kong, was rediscovered during the COVID-19 pandemic, and was released on 3 May 2020; it passed 1 million views on YouTube that morning and reached number 80 on the UK Singles Chart based on streaming alone.

===2024–present: Reunion and Oasis Live &#x27;25 Tour===

By early 2023, both Gallagher brothers expressed interest in reuniting the band if it was done on the right terms. On 27 August 2024, almost 15 years to the date of their 2009 split, Oasis announced that they would reform for performances in the UK and Ireland in July and August 2025, stating &quot;The guns have fallen silent. The stars have aligned. The great wait is over. Come see. It will not be televised.&quot; After the announcement of the reunion, it was rumoured that former members Paul &quot;Bonehead&quot; Arthurs, Gem Archer, Andy Bell, Zak Starkey and some members of Noel Gallagher&#x27;s High Flying Birds will perform alongside the two brothers. Former drummer Alan White also teased his involvement in the reunion, while original drummer Tony McCarroll said he does not think that he will be back. Liam Gallagher also teased on X that new members could join the band on tour.

On 30 August 2024, following the news of the reunion, Oasis released the 30th anniversary edition of their debut album &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot;. A week later the album charted at number 1 in the UK Official Albums Chart Top 100, 30 years after its release along with &quot;Time Flies&quot; and &quot;Morning Glory&quot; which rose to number 3 and 4 in the charts. Three more Oasis albums also entered the top 100 in the charts, &quot;The Masterplan&quot; at number 41, &quot;Be Here Now&quot; at number 42 and &quot;Heathen Chemistry&quot; at number 97. Oasis&#x27;s single &quot;Live Forever&quot; charted at number 8 in the UK Official Singles Chart Top 40, two places higher than it originally finished in 1994, along with &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back In Anger&quot; which reached number 9 and &quot;Wonderwall&quot; which reached number 11.

Although no new album from the band has been confirmed, Liam Gallagher has teased new music on X. On 7 September 2024, he said a new Oasis album is &quot;already finished&quot; and that he has been blown away by the music his brother had written. Subsequently, Gallagher claimed to have been joking about a new Oasis album.

The band also added American, Australian and Asian dates to their touring schedule in 2025.

==Musical style and influences==

In general, Oasis have been regarded as a rock band. More specifically, the band has been categorized as Britpop, indie rock, alternative rock, pop rock, neo-psychedelia, psychedelic rock, and power pop. Oasis were most heavily influenced by the Beatles, an influence that was frequently labelled as an &quot;obsession&quot; by British media. The band were also strongly influenced by the other 1960s British Invasion acts, including the Kinks, the Rolling Stones, and the Who. Another major influence, especially during the band&#x27;s early career, was 1970s British punk rock, in particular the Sex Pistols and their album &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&#x27;s the Sex Pistols&quot; (1977), as well as the Damned, and the Jam/Paul Weller. In addition, members of Oasis have cited as an influence or inspiration AC/DC, Acetone, Burt Bacharach, Beck, the Bee Gees, David Bowie, the Doors, Peter Green–era Fleetwood Mac, Grant Lee Buffalo, the La&#x27;s, MC5, Nirvana, Pink Floyd, Slade, the Smiths, the Soundtrack of Our Lives, the Specials, the Stone Roses, the Stooges, T. Rex, the Verve, the Velvet Underground/Lou Reed, and Neil Young. 

Noel Gallagher&#x27;s songwriting is characterized as &quot;reverent-yet-confident,&quot; and is said to be augmented by Liam Gallagher&#x27;s &quot;deadpan cool and sneering presence.&quot; Oasis albums consistently featured loud tracks characterized by nasal vocals. These dynamic Britpop compositions stood in stark contrast to the more polished pop tunes of Blur, their chart rivals. Especially in their early years, Oasis&#x27;s musical style and lyrics were grounded in the working-class backgrounds of Liam and Noel. The brothers became known for their rebellious demeanor, self-assured personalities, and sibling rivalry; these characteristics garnered media interest from the band&#x27;s beginnings and endured throughout their entire career.

==Legal battles over songwriter credits==
Legal action has been taken against Noel Gallagher and Oasis for plagiarism on three occasions. The first was the case of Neil Innes (formerly of the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band and the Rutles) suing to prove the Oasis song &quot;Whatever&quot; borrowed from his song &quot;How Sweet to Be an Idiot&quot;. Innes was eventually awarded royalties and a co-writer credit. Noel Gallagher said in 2010 that the plagiarism was unintentional and he was unaware of the similarities until informed of Innes&#x27;s legal case. In the second incident, Oasis were sued by Coca-Cola and forced to pay $500,000 in damages to the New Seekers after it was alleged that the Oasis song &quot;Shakermaker&quot; had lifted words and melody from &quot;I&#x27;d Like to Teach the World to Sing&quot;. When asked about the incident, Noel Gallagher joked &quot;Now we all drink Pepsi.&quot; On the third and final occasion, when promotional copies of &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot; were originally distributed, they contained a previously unreleased bonus song called &quot;Step Out&quot;. This promotional CD was quickly withdrawn and replaced with a version that omitted the controversial song, which was allegedly similar to the Stevie Wonder song &quot;Uptight (Everything&#x27;s Alright)&quot;. Official releases of &quot;Step Out&quot;, as the B-side to &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back in Anger&quot; and on &quot;Familiar to Millions&quot;, listed &quot;Wonder, et al.&quot; as co-writers.

The 2003 song &quot;Life Got Cold&quot; by UK band Girls Aloud received attention due to similarities between the guitar riff and melody of the song and that of the Oasis song &quot;Wonderwall&quot;. A BBC review stated &quot;part of the chorus sounds like it is going to turn into &#x27;Wonderwall&#x27; by Oasis.&quot; Warner/Chappell Music has since credited Noel Gallagher as co-songwriter.

==Legacy and influence==
Despite originally parting ways in 2009, Oasis remain influential in British music and culture and are recognised as one of the biggest and most acclaimed bands of the 1990s. Yardbarker wrote, &quot;Oasis was known as much for the antics and often volatile relationship between brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher as [it was for its] stellar alternative/pop rock sound. When the two were on, in sync, relatively sober, and not totally at each other&#x27;s throats, Oasis was tough to beat. And when the tension was high, the band still delivered some of the best music of the 1990s.&quot; 

Additionally, the band are recognised as one of the spearheads of Britpop, which has claimed a prominent place in British music. With their record breaking sales, concerts, sibling disputes, and their high-profile chart battle with Britpop rivals Blur, Oasis were a major part of 1990s UK pop culture, an era dubbed Cool Britannia. Many bands and artists have cited Oasis as an influence or inspiration, including Arctic Monkeys, Catfish and the Bottlemen, Deafheaven, the Killers, Alvvays, Maroon 5, Coldplay, and Drake.

The band&#x27;s success also helped local businesses. Pete Caban, owner of Bandwagon Music Supplies in Perth, Scotland, which closed in 2020 after 37 years in business, said: &quot;The highlight years were the mid-90s to the early 2000s. That was the peak period. The Oasis period, as I call it, where everyone wanted to buy a guitar. That was the game changer for music and for me here in Perth. I was shovelling guitars out the door at the point. So hurrah for Noel Gallagher.&quot;

In 2007, Oasis were one of the four featured artists in the seventh episode of the BBC/VH1 series &quot;Seven Ages of Rock&quot; – an episode about British indie rock – along with Britpop peers Blur in addition to the Smiths and the Stone Roses.

In 2023, an unofficial music project by the name of AISIS was the first full-length album to use AI vocals. The project attracted more than half a million views within six weeks of publication, including newspaper articles written about it, and brought Breezer, the band that created the project, out of obscurity and landed them live dates. Bobby Geraghty and his Breezer bandmates wrote original Oasis-style songs and then used AI to create audio deepfakes based on Liam Gallagher&#x27;s voice alongside their original instrumentation. Liam himself approved of the album, saying that he &quot;sounded mega&quot;.

Oasis received a nomination for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on their sixth year of eligibility in February 2024. Initially, the members included in the nomination were the Gallagher brothers, McGuigan, White, Arthurs, McCarroll, Archer, and Bell. Liam Gallagher feels that the organisation is not authentic when it comes to rock music.
