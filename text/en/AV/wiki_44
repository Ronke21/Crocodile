<text>Boyz II Men (/&#x27;bɔɪz tu mɛn/ boyz-too-men) is an American vocal harmony group from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, best known for emotional ballads and a cappella harmonies. Formed in 1985, they have been a trio composed of baritone Nathan Morris, tenor Wanyá Morris, and Shawn Stockman since 2003. During the 1990s, Boyz II Men was a quartet with bass singer Michael McCary, who left the group in 2003 due to health issues after being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.

The group first saw commercial success in 1991 with the release of their singles &quot;Motownphilly&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday,&quot; both of which peaked within the top five of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Their 1992 single, &quot;End of the Road&quot; peaked atop the chart and set a then-record for spending 13 weeks at the position. Boyz II Men later broke this record twice more with the singles &quot;I&#x27;ll Make Love to You&quot; and &quot;One Sweet Day&quot; (with Mariah Carey) which, at 14 and 16 weeks respectively, set records for most weeks at number one. When &quot;On Bended Knee&quot; took the number one spot away from &quot;I&#x27;ll Make Love to You,&quot; Boyz II Men became the third musical act, after the Beatles and Elvis Presley, to replace themselves atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. These achievements gave Boyz II Men recognition as &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s biggest boy band from 1987 to 2012.

Boyz II Men continued to perform as a trio despite McCary&#x27;s departure. Their latest studio album, &quot;Under the Streetlight&quot;, was released in 2017. Boyz II Men have received four Grammy Awards. They also became the first group contestants to win &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; where they competed as &quot;Buffalos&quot; in season twelve.

== History ==
=== 1985–1990: Group formation and beginnings ===

The group, originally named Unique Attraction, was formed in 1985 by Nathan Morris and Marc Nelson at the Philadelphia High School for the Creative and Performing Arts (CAPA) along with fellow schoolmates George Baldi, Jon Shoats, and Marguerite Walker. In 1987, Wanyá Morris, who sang in the school&#x27;s choir along with the members of Unique Attraction, joined the group and became a permanent member as a freshman. In 1988 Baldi, Shoats and Walker left the group due to graduation. They then recruited Shawn Stockman after seeing him perform a solo in the school&#x27;s choir. After an encounter in a school bathroom, Michael McCary started singing along with the group and eventually became the group&#x27;s new bass singer. With their permanent lineup of members, the group rehearsed in the high school&#x27;s bathrooms, in the corners of their schools, and other local areas. At CAPA, they were mentored by LaDeva Davis.

Finding inspiration in New Edition&#x27;s harmonies and routines, they eventually renamed the group &quot;Boyz II Men,&quot; after New Edition&#x27;s &quot;Boys to Men,&quot; from the 1988 album &quot;Heart Break&quot;. After performing at a Valentine&#x27;s Day party at school in 1989, they snuck into a concert put on by local radio station Power 99 at the Philadelphia Civic Center. They planned to find Will Smith backstage and perform for him. However, while looking for Smith, they happened to cross paths with New Edition member Michael Bivins, who, along with bandmates Ricky Bell and Ronnie DeVoe, had just announced they were forming a New Edition spin-off trio, Bell Biv DeVoe. After they sang New Edition&#x27;s &quot;Can You Stand the Rain&quot; for him, Bivins and everyone in attendance, including other celebrities, were impressed. He then gave the group his number and told them to call him. Nate eventually called him, and he agreed to manage and help produce the group.

The delay before recording their own material and reported personality conflicts led founding member Marc Nelson to leave the group, making Boyz II Men into the quartet that found international fame: Michael McCary, Nathan Morris, Wanyá Morris, and Shawn Stockman.

=== 1991–1993: &quot;Cooleyhighharmony&quot; and &quot;End of the Road&quot; ===
Boyz II Men&#x27;s first album, &quot;Cooleyhighharmony&quot;, was released on Motown in 1991 and was produced by Dallas Austin and the Characters. &quot;Cooleyhighharmony&quot;″s drum-heavy new jack swing sound and multi-layered sampled backdrops were similar to that of Bell Biv DeVoe&#x27;s own work, but featured classic-soul styled vocals in place of BBD&#x27;s rapping and brassier singing. This style was dubbed &quot;hip hop doo-wop&quot; by the group and Bivins, who presented Boyz II Men and adolescent R&amp;B group Another Bad Creation to the public as BBD&#x27;s protégés.

From the beginning, Boyz II Men featured all four members as leads, avoiding the usual R&amp;B group arrangement of one or two lead singers and a team of background singers. The multiple-lead arrangement became a Boyz II Men trademark, and it became typical to hear Wanyá Morris&#x27; vibrato-heavy tenor, Shawn Stockman&#x27;s tenor voice, Nathan Morris&#x27; baritone, and Michael McCary&#x27;s bass (often used in spoken-word sections of many Boyz II Men hits) trading bars in each song.

The album&#x27;s liner notes identified unique nicknames for each group member. These nicknames were devised in collaboration with Bivins in an attempt at marketing. Wanyá was &quot;Squirt,&quot; Shawn was &quot;Slim,&quot; Michael was simply &quot;Bass,&quot; and Nathan assumed the name &quot;Alex Vanderpool,&quot; after a soap opera character who brandished a nerdy style.

Boyz II Men&#x27;s first single, the Dallas Austin-produced &quot;Motownphilly,&quot; featured a rap cameo by Michael Bivins that tells of how he met Boyz II Men. The single&#x27;s release was accompanied by a music video that presented the group in hip-hop style. (The video also included cameos from fellow Philadelphia High School for Creative and Performing Arts alumni Black Thought and Questlove of The Roots.) &quot;Cooleyhighharmony&quot;″s second single was an a cappella cover of a classic Motown tune, G.C. Cameron&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday&quot; from the 1975 film &quot;Cooley High&quot;, while &quot;Uhh Ahh&quot; served as the third single.

&quot;Cooleyhighharmony&quot; achieved major success, selling over nine million copies and winning the Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at the 1992 Grammy Awards. Boyz II Men were also nominated for Best New Artist, along with British singer-songwriter Seal, fellow R&amp;B group Color Me Badd, and dance group C+C Music Factory, but the Grammy was awarded to singer-songwriter Marc Cohn. &quot;Motownphilly&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday&quot; were number 1 R&amp;B hits and top five U.S. pop hits.

In 1992, Boyz II Men joined MC Hammer&#x27;s high-profile 2 Legit 2 Quit Tour as an opening act. While traveling the country, their tour manager Roderick &#x27;Khalil&#x27; Rountree was murdered in Chicago, and the group&#x27;s future performances of &quot;It&#x27;s So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday&quot; were dedicated to him. As a result of this unfortunate experience, the song helped advance their success.

While touring during 1992, Boyz II Men returned briefly to the studio to record the single &quot;End of the Road,&quot; co-written and produced by Kenneth &quot;Babyface&quot; Edmonds, for the soundtrack to Eddie Murphy&#x27;s film &quot;Boomerang&quot;. This song, released as a single on June 30, 1992, became Boyz II Men&#x27;s biggest hit. It reached the number one position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on August 15, remaining for a record-setting 13 weeks, until November 14, 1992. The success of &quot;End of the Road&quot; instantly transformed Boyz II Men from up-and-coming R&amp;B stars into mainstream music celebrities.

A revamped &quot;Cooleyhighharmony&quot; was reissued during 1993, with &quot;End of the Road&quot; added as a special bonus track, but &quot;End of the Road&quot; initially appeared only on the &quot;Boomerang&quot; soundtrack. Later, the track was included in a collection of singles produced by Michael Bivins called &quot;East Coast Family, Vol. 1&quot;. Shortly after the release of this compilation, Boyz II Men and Michael Bivins parted ways professionally. Boyz II Men continued to work with Babyface and other high-profile record producers over the next several years.

=== 1994–1996: &quot;II&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Make Love to You&quot; ===
After releasing a Christmas compilation, &quot;Christmas Interpretations&quot; in 1993, Boyz II Men returned to the studio for their highly anticipated sophomore effort. In 1994, &quot;II&quot; was released. &quot;II&quot; sold more than copies in the United States alone, becoming one of the best-selling albums ever released by an R&amp;B group act, and one of the biggest albums of the decade. &quot;II&quot; later won two awards at the 1995 Grammy Awards, including Best R&amp;B Album.

Most of the tracks on &quot;II&quot; were written and produced by Tim &amp; Bob—Tim Kelley and Bob Robinson (5), Babyface (2) and the successful team of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis (2). Several of &quot;II&quot;″s tracks became major singles, among them Jam &amp; Lewis&#x27;s &quot;On Bended Knee&quot;, and Babyface&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Make Love to You&quot; and &quot;Water Runs Dry&quot;.

&quot;I&#x27;ll Make Love to You&quot; broke &quot;End of the Road&#x27;s&quot; 13-week record at number 1, by spending 14 weeks at the top of the chart (a feat equaled earlier that year by Whitney Houston&#x27;s cover of &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;). &quot;On Bended Knee&quot; replaced &quot;I&#x27;ll Make Love to You&quot; at number 1, making Boyz II Men only the third act ever to replace itself at number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, after Elvis Presley and the Beatles.

In 1995, the group appeared as backing vocalists on &quot;HIStory&quot; from Michael Jackson&#x27;s Grammy-nominated ninth .

In 1995, Motown issued &quot;The Remix Collection&quot;, a compilation of remixes of various Boyz II Men songs from &quot;Cooleyhighharmony&quot; and &quot;II&quot;. The group itself had opposed the release of the collection because they felt the compilation did not represent Boyz II Men&#x27;s best work. After the label released the album without their permission, there was a dispute between the company and the group. Boyz II Men initiated their own recording company Stonecreek (which released material by artists such as Uncle Sam), and they arranged for Stonecreek&#x27;s distribution by Epic Records, not Motown.

=== 1997–1998: &quot;Evolution&quot; and label conflicts ===
Boyz II Men&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Evolution&quot;, was released during 1997 to mixed reviews and sold three million copies, far below the stratospheric success of &quot;II&quot;″s ( copies) and &quot;Cooleyhighharmony&quot; (). Only one of &quot;Evolution&quot;″s singles, the Jam/Lewis-penned &quot;Four Seasons of Loneliness&quot;, reached number 1 on the Hot 100 chart. The second single, the Babyface-helmed &quot;A Song for Mama&quot; (the theme song to the Babyface-produced film &quot;Soul Food,&quot;) was a Top 10 success, but the follow-up &quot;Can&#x27;t Let Her Go&quot; underperformed.

The global tour began in 1997 to promote &quot;Evolution&quot; was successful in terms of ticket sales, but behind the scenes, Boyz II Men was wracked by conflicts, with their record label and internal conflicts among the members of the group. Making matters worse, health problems began to take their toll on the group. While on tour to support the &quot;Evolution&quot; album, Wanyá Morris developed a polyp on his vocal cords, and the group was forced to postpone part of the tour until he recovered. McCary&#x27;s multiple sclerosis meant that he was unable to participate in most of the group&#x27;s dance routines.

Boyz II Men were nominated for 2 Grammys in 1998: Best R&amp;B Album for &quot;Evolution&quot; and Best R&amp;B Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group for &quot;A Song for Mama&quot;.

=== 1999–2001: &quot;Nathan Michael Shawn Wanya&quot; ===
In 1999, Motown&#x27;s parent company, PolyGram, was bought by Universal Music Group. Amidst the major corporate restructure, Motown was merged with UMG&#x27;s Universal Records, where Boyz II Men found themselves reassigned.

Their only studio LP album for Universal, 2000&#x27;s &quot;Nathan Michael Shawn Wanya&quot;, was chiefly written and produced by the group itself, in an attempt to update their sound and ward off critics who questioned the group&#x27;s reliance on Babyface&#x27;s hit-making songcraft. While the critics were more receptive to &quot;Nathan Michael Shawn Wanya&quot; than they had been to its predecessor, the LP sold only 500,000 copies in the US, copies worldwide, and although its two singles, &quot;Pass You By&quot; and &quot;Thank You in Advance,&quot; received media attention, neither became hits.

Boyz II Men departed from Universal in 2001, ending their relationship with the company that brought them to international stardom in 1991. The label released a greatest hits compilation, &quot;&quot;, to close out their contract.

=== 2002–2003: &quot;Full Circle&quot; and &quot;The Color of Love&quot; ===
Signing a new deal with Arista Records in 2002, Boyz II Men began recording the &quot;Full Circle&quot; album, and recruited Babyface for a new single, &quot;The Color of Love&quot;. In an attempt to recapture the massive success the group had enjoyed a decade earlier, the album received a significant promotional budget. Arista commissioned a high-budget music video, shot in four different locales by four different directors: supervising director Little X filmed scenes featuring Michael McCary in India, Hype Williams filmed Shawn Stockman in Tokyo, Benny Boom filmed Nathan Morris in Ghana, and Chris Robinson filmed Wanyá Morris in Puerto Rico and finally all were filmed in New York. The resulting music video had a debut on BET, but failed to have a great effect, and &quot;Full Circle&quot;, like &quot;Nathan Michael Shawn Wanya&quot; before it, sold slightly more than 500,000 copies in the US and copies worldwide.

&quot;Full Circle&quot; became Boyz II Men&#x27;s final album as a quartet, and their last effort to receive extensive promotion from a major record company. On , 2003, Michael McCary left Boyz II Men due to chronic back problems resulting from multiple sclerosis (MS) and personal problems. Arista terminated Boyz II Men&#x27;s contract on , and the remaining three members took a temporary hiatus from the music industry.

=== 2004–2006: &quot;Throwback, Vol. 1&quot; and &quot;The Remedy&quot; ===
After a year out of the spotlight, Boyz II Men created the independent label MSM Music Group (distributed through Koch Records), and released the &quot;Throwback, Vol. 1&quot; LP in 2004. The album is a collection of covers of classic R&amp;B and soul songs such as The Dazz Band&#x27;s &quot;Let It Whip&quot;, Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Human Nature&quot;, and, as the single, Bobby Caldwell&#x27;s &quot;What You Won&#x27;t Do for Love&quot;. For this record, Nathan took on the bass lines as well as the baritone vocals that he sang when Boyz II Men was a quartet. &quot;Throwback, Vol. 1&quot; reached number 59 on the Billboard 200. The group launched an independent tour of North America and Asia in support of the &quot;Throwback&quot; series. The album sold over 200,000 copies with little to no promotion aside from the group&#x27;s independent tour.

In 2005 Boyz II Men recorded a CD with Anderson Cameau called &quot;Apocalypse&quot;, a project meant to benefit Haiti.

In 2006, Boyz II Men&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;The Remedy&quot;, was released exclusively in Japan, where they found a thriving fan base. In other regions, &quot;The Remedy&quot; was made available online through the group&#x27;s website on , 2007.

=== 2007–2009: &quot;Hitsville USA&quot; &amp; &quot;Love&quot; ===
In mid-2007, the group re-signed with Universal Records and released the LP &quot;&quot; through the Decca Records label. The LP is a cover album featuring songs from the Motown Records catalog, co-produced by Randy Jackson of &quot;American Idol&quot; fame. The &quot;Motown&quot; album includes covers of songs by The Temptations (&quot;Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)&quot;), Marvin Gaye (&quot;Ain&#x27;t Nothing Like the Real Thing&quot;, &quot;Mercy Mercy Me&quot;), Smokey Robinson &amp; the Miracles (&quot;The Tracks of My Tears&quot;), and even Boyz II Men themselves (an a cappella version of &quot;End of the Road&quot;).

Commercially, &quot;Motown&quot; found some success. It peaked at number 6 on the US R&amp;B chart and was certified Gold in the UK. The album was also a critical success. For the 51st Annual Grammy Awards in 2009, Boyz II Men received two nominations for the album &quot;Motown: A Journey Through Hitsville USA&quot; (Best R&amp;B Album and Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for &quot;Ribbon in the Sky&quot;).

In 2008, Boyz II Men&#x27;s three members appeared on Celebrity &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget the Lyrics&quot; and created a sensation with their performance. They earned $500,000 for their two nominated charities; the appearance also generated interest in their next release.

In 2009, Boyz II Men announced plans for a new cover album that covers &quot;artists I don&#x27;t think people would expect us to cover!&quot; according to Shawn Stockman. Entitled &quot;Love&quot;, the album was released on , 2009. The album contains remakes of love songs from outside the R&amp;B genre.

=== 2010–2012: Love Cruise and &quot;Twenty&quot; ===
Boyz II Men headlined a &quot;Love Cruise&quot; in honor of their 20th anniversary and in observance of Valentine&#x27;s Day. The cruise took place –14, 2011, and traveled from Miami, Florida, to Nassau, Bahamas. Cruise passengers received a Boyz II Men welcome cocktail party, a concert performance by Boyz II Men, an additional fan appreciation concert by Boyz II Men, a photo session with Boyz II Men (in small groups), a formal prom night, a poker tournament, a deck party with Boyz II Men and a guest DJ, a singles mixer, a gift bag, and onboard drawings for other Boyz II Men events. Couples were able to renew their wedding vows in a special ceremony with Boyz II Men.

&quot;Twenty&quot;, named in recognition of Boyz II Men&#x27;s twenty years in the music business, is a double CD album with thirteen original songs and eight rerecorded Boyz II Men classics. It was released on October 25, 2011. &quot;Twenty&quot; is the group&#x27;s fourth release through MSM Music Group. It was released in Japan 13 days before its official US release date with the help of Avex Group, the biggest Japanese independent record label.

Originally, Boyz II Men announced a reunion with original member Michael McCary for the &quot;Twenty&quot; album. On September 6, 2009, at a concert in Virginia Beach, Virginia, Stockman announced that their upcoming 20th anniversary album would &quot;include all 4 members&quot;, sparking a tremendous applause.
But soon after that announcement, McCary declined and did not join the project.

As a trio, Boyz II Men performed as special guests on VH1&#x27;s highly rated &quot;VH1 Divas Celebrate Soul&quot; concert.

Boyz II Men contributed a cover of Japanese rock band L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel&#x27;s song &quot;Snow Drop&quot; to their 2012 tribute album.

=== 2013–present: The Package Tour, &quot;Collide&quot; and &quot;Under the Streelight&quot; ===

In 2017, the group began starring in television commercials for GEICO Auto Insurance.

On June 24, 2017, a section of Broad Street in Philadelphia, from Christian to Carpenter Streets, was renamed “Boyz II Men Boulevard” by the city council.

== Style and influence ==
Boyz II Men is among the biggest names in a cappella and R&amp;B. With what was called &quot;crossover appeal&quot;, Boyz II Men found themselves at the vanguard of the 1990s movement to take R&amp;B back into the mainstream, where it had been back in the 1970s. Their use of hip-hop beats in combination with R&amp;B was not unique, but it was Boyz II Men&#x27;s enormous success with mainstream audiences in &quot;putting harmony over the hip-hop tracks&quot; that helped usher in the near-total dominance of the R&amp;B genre on the pop charts in the 2000s and 2010s. On January 5, 2012, Boyz II Men were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. They were featured on the first episode of the 2021 Netflix series &quot;This Is Pop&quot;, called &quot;The Boyz II Men Effect&quot;, about their impact on the boy band scene in the 1990s.

<text>Liturgical colours are specific colours used for vestments and hangings within the context of Christian liturgy. The symbolism of violet, blue, white, green, red, gold, black, rose, and other colours may serve to underline moods appropriate to a season of the liturgical year or may highlight a special occasion.

There is a distinction between the colour of the vestments worn by the clergy and their choir dress, which with a few exceptions does not change with the seasons of the liturgical year.

==Roman Catholic Church==

===Current rubrics===
In the Roman Rite, as reformed by Pope Paul VI, the following colours are used, in accordance with the rubrics of the General Instruction of the Roman Missal, Section 346.

On more solemn days, i.e. festive, more precious, sacred vestments may be used, even if not of the colour of the day. Such vestments may, for instance, be made from cloth of gold or cloth of silver. Moreover, the Conference of Bishops may determine and propose to the Apostolic See adaptations suited to the needs and culture of peoples.

Ritual Masses are celebrated in their proper colour or in white or in a festive colour. Masses for Various Needs, on the other hand, are celebrated in the colour proper to the day or the season or in violet if they bear a penitential character. Votive Masses are celebrated in the colour suited to the Mass itself or even in the colour proper to the day or the season.

==== Regional and situational exceptions ====
Some particular variations:

* Blue, a colour associated with the Virgin Mary. While blue vestments are common in some Eastern churches, in the Latin rite, blue as a vestment colour may only be used pursuant to a special privilege granted. The permission, sometimes called &quot;cerulean privilege&quot;, is of two kinds: one pertains to particular Marian shrines and specifies when blue vestments may be worn. The other type of permission is that accorded to various countries. In Spain, an apostolic indult was granted for the feast of the Immaculate Conception and its octave as well as for votive Masses and Saturdays, when the Office for the Immaculate Conception is prayed and on Marian feasts where there is a related custom. The privilege has been granted to Spain, to certain of its colonies, and former colonies in Latin America by a decree of the Sacred Congregation of Rites on 12 February 1864. It also extends to the Philippines, Guam, and the Mariana Islands, which were still under Spanish rule at that time. The use of blue is also observed in Portugal during certain Marian feasts, although no special indult has been granted. There have also been uses of blue in place of violet for the season of Advent despite the fact that this practice is not authorized under liturgical rubrics.
* Gold or silver may be worn on more solemn occasions in the dioceses of the United States.

The rules on liturgical colours in the 1960 Code of Rubrics, whose observance is still permitted in the circumstances indicated in the 2007 document &quot;Summorum Pontificum&quot; on use of the 1962 Roman Missal, which incorporates them, differ from the current rubrics in the following respects:

Pope Pius X raised the rank of the Sundays after Epiphany and Pentecost, so that on those that fell within common octaves, green was used instead of the colour of the octave, as had previously been the rule; on Sundays after Pentecost that fell within privileged octaves (i.e., the octaves of Corpus Christi and of the Sacred Heart), the liturgical color of the feast was retained.

The rules on liturgical colours before the time of Pope Pius X were essentially those indicated in the edition of the Roman Missal that Pope Pius V promulgated in 1570, except for the addition of feasts not included in his Missal. The scheme of colours in his Missal reflected usage that had become fixed in Rome by the twelfth century.

==Byzantine Rite==
The Byzantine Rite, which is used by all the member churches of the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Byzantine Lutheran Churches and the Eastern Catholic Churches of Byzantine Rite, does not have a universal system of colours, with the service-books of the Byzantine tradition only specifying &quot;light&quot; or &quot;dark&quot; vestments. In the Greek tradition, maroon or burgundy are common for solemn feast days, and a wide variety of colours are used at other times, the most common of which are gold and white.

Slavic-use churches and others influenced by Western traditions have adopted a cycle of liturgical colours. The particulars may change from place to place, but generally:

The colours would be changed before Vespers on the eve of the day being commemorated. During Great Feasts, the colour is changed before the vespers service that begins the first day of a forefeast, and remains until the apodosis (final day of the afterfeast).

Under Western influence, black is often used in the Slavic churches for funerals, weekdays of Great Lent, and Holy Week as a sign of penance and mourning, but in the second half of the 20th century, the ancient white became more common, as a sign of the hope of the Resurrection.

===Russian liturgical colours===
In the tradition of the Russian Orthodox Church, up to nine different liturgical colours may be used throughout the year.
Exact use of these colours varies, but the following are the most common uses:

==Coptic Rite==
The Coptic tradition, followed by the Coptic Orthodox Church and the Coptic Catholic Church, only uses white vestments, with gold and silver being considered variations of white. The only exception is during Passion Week when black is used. Nonetheless, trimmings of red, gold or blue may be found on some vestments.

==Ethiopian Rite==
The liturgical tradition of Ethiopia, followed by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and the Ethiopian Catholic Church, embraces a wide variety of liturgical colours. In Eritrea, similar traditions are followed.

==Lutheran Churches==
The United Lutheran Church in America (ULCA), a predecessor of The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), prescribed the following colour scheme for its paraments in the Common Service Book (CSB) of 1917: 

White from and with Vespers of the Eve of the Nativity through the Epiphany season (except the Day of St. Stephen, Martyr), from Easter Day to the Vespers of the Saturday before Whitsunday, on the Festival of the Transfiguration, on the Presentation of our Lord, on the Festival of the Holy Trinity and its Octave, on the Days of the Annunciation and the Visitation, and on the Day of St. Michael and All Angels. 

Red from and with Vespers on the Saturday before Whitsunday to the Vespers of the Saturday before the Festival of the Holy Trinity, on the Festival of the Reformation and the Sunday after, on the Apostles&#x27; Days and on all Evangelists&#x27; Days (excepting St. John, Apostle, Evangelist), on Martyrs&#x27; Days, on All Saints&#x27; Day, for the Dedication of a Church, for all Church Anniversaries, for the Harvest Festival, and on Thanksgiving Day. 

Green from and with Vespers of the Saturday before Septuagesima to Vespers of the day before Ash Wednesday, beginning with the second Sunday after the Festival of the Holy Trinity and throughout the Trinity Season to Vespers of the Saturday before Advent Sunday (except on such Festivals and Days for which there is a special appointment). 

Violet from and with Vespers of the Saturday before Advent to Vespers of the Eve of the Nativity, from and with Vespers of the day before Ash Wednesday and throughout Lent (excepting Good Friday) to Vespers of the Eve of Easter. 

Black for Good Friday and any Day of Humiliation called for by ecclesiastical authority. 

This differs from the Roman and Anglican Uses in that it has white prescribed for the Epiphany Season, green for the period from Septuagesima until Lent, violet for Maundy Thursday, red for All Saints&#x27; Day, red for the Dedication of a Church and its annual anniversary, and red also for the Harvest Festival and Thanksgiving Day. One can presume that this is similar to the colour scheme historically used in the Protestant Church in Germany due to the heavy German influence in the ULCA.

The ELCA presently uses a similar colour scheme as that of their Scandinavian Lutheran counterparts, with the use of gold only for the Easter Vigil and Easter Sunday services and Holy Week using scarlet rather than crimson. Blue is used for Advent. White is used for Christmas, Epiphany, Sundays of Easter, Holy Trinity, and Christ the King. For Lent, purple is used. During the time after Pentecost and the Epiphany, green is used. 

Both the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS) and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) use a similar system, but with purple being the primary colour for both Advent and Lent (with blue being the alternate colour for Advent only), and the use of gold in place of white for both Christmas and Easter (in similar practice to the Catholic Church). In the WELS, the use of red is also done during the &quot;Period of End Times&quot;, a period of the Church regarding the teachings of the Book of Revelation, culminating in the creation of the New Jerusalem (corresponding to Christ the King in the ELCA). In all three churches, including the ELCA, red is also worn on the last Sunday of October, in celebration of the Reformation on October 31, when Martin Luther nailed the 95 Theses onto the door of Wittenberg Castle Church.

==Anglicanism==
Most Anglican churches use the colours appointed in the Lutheran Churches and those of the Roman Rite, usually in its post-1969 form, with the exception of Sarum Blue replacing violet for Advent, but some use the earlier form, with, for instance, black in place of red on Good Friday. Some churches use black at Masses for the dead, but more commonly white or purple is used. For historical reasons much of the worldwide Anglican Communion takes a noticeable lead from the practice of the Church of England. Since the 1980 Alternative Service Book, liturgical colours have been recommended for seasons, with more detailed advice offered as part of the Common Worship series of liturgies, including colours for all Sundays and festivals printed in the &#x27;core volume&#x27; next to collects.

The Church&#x27;s published Lectionary now makes detailed suggestions for liturgical colour throughout the year, which corresponds almost exactly with the above table of Roman Rite (post-1969 usage) usage with five minor exceptions, and one more significant one:

:* there is no reference in Anglican usage to Masses of deceased popes and cardinals;
:* no liturgical colour at all is suggested for Holy Saturday (the words &quot;hangings removed&quot; are printed);
:* the recommendation of red for confirmation rites is extended also to ordination rites;
:* Lenten Array (unbleached linen) continues to be listed as an alternative option to purple during Lent;
:* the option exists for using red instead of green during the &quot;Kingdom Season&quot;, the four last Sundays of the liturgical year, culminating in Christ the King, as is common is some Lutheran traditions (see above);
:* finally, and more significantly, the Church of England provision suggests white throughout the Sundays after Epiphany as a distinct &quot;Epiphany season&quot;, with ordinary time commencing the day after Candlemas.

The colour scheme suggested by the Church of England also indicates where gold vestments should be used in those churches that possess gold and white as distinct colours. The use of rose-pink vestments, as in the Roman Rite table above, was mentioned as an option in early editions of Common Worship, and is a listed option in the annual published lectionary; however, later Common Worship publications have begun to refer to this practice as &quot;traditional&quot; reflecting its resurgence.

===Sarum Rite===
The Sarum Rite was a medieval liturgical rite used in England before the Reformation which had a distinct set of liturgical colours. After the Anglo-Catholic Revival of the 19th century, certain Church of England churches began adopting Sarum liturgical colours as an attempt to produce something that was an English expression of Catholicism rather than a Roman expression. One of the chief advocates behind this was Percy Dearmer. The exact colours used by the mediaeval Sarum rite are a matter of dispute, but colours adopted by contemporary churches claiming to use the Sarum scheme include in particular deep blue for Advent, which may be popularly referred to as &quot;Sarum blue&quot;, and unbleached linen for Lent.

==Methodist churches==
Methodists use a colour scheme similar to those used by Lutherans and Roman Catholics. The United Methodist Church, prior to the early 1990s, used red solely for Pentecost, even including the Sundays after Pentecost Sunday, with the use of green being reserved for the season of Kingdomtide, which usually lasted from late August/early September until Christ the King (the last Sunday in Kingdomtide). Since the publication of the 1992 Book of Worship, the UMC has followed the ELCA practice of wearing red only for Pentecost, Holy Week and Reformation Sunday and green for the rest of the Pentecost season.

==Reformed churches==
The Presbyterian Church (USA), or its predecessor denominations, has sanctioned the use of liturgical colours and promoted their use in The Worshipbook of 1970, the 1993 Book of Common Worship and the 2018 Book of Common Worship. Advent and Lent are periods of preparation and repentance and are represented by the colour purple. Blue can be used for Advent instead of purple. The feasts of Christmas Day and Christmastide, Epiphany Sunday, Baptism of the Lord Sunday, Transfiguration Sunday, Easter Season, Trinity Sunday, and Christ the King Sunday are represented by white. Green is the colour for periods of Ordinary Time. Red is for Pentecost Sunday, but may also be used for ordinations, church anniversaries, and memorial services for ordained clergy. Red or purple are appropriate for Palm Sunday. During Holy Week, purple is used until the church is stripped bare on Maundy Thursday; the church remains stripped bare on Good Friday and Holy Saturday, though in some places black might be used on those days.

Similarly, the United Church of Christ includes indications of which liturgical colour to use for each Sunday in its annual calendar. The general Western pattern is followed, with either purple or blue recommended for Advent.

<doc id="161236" wikidata="Q636187" url="?curid=161236" title="Four Modernizations">
<text>The Four Modernizations (simplified Chinese: 四个现代化; traditional Chinese: 四個現代化) were goals formally announced by China&#x27;s first Premier Zhou Enlai to strengthen the fields of agriculture, industry, defense, and science and technology in China. The Four Modernizations were adopted as a means of rejuvenating China&#x27;s economy in 1977, following the death of Mao Zedong, and later were among the defining features of Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s tenure as the paramount leader of China. At the beginning of &quot;Reform and Opening-up&quot;, Deng further proposed the idea of &quot;xiaokang&quot; or &quot;Moderately prosperous society&quot; in 1979.

==Summary==
They were introduced as early as January 1963 at the Conference on Scientific and Technological Work held in Shanghai, Zhou Enlai called for professionals in the sciences to realize &quot;the Four Modernizations.&quot; In February 1963, at the National Conference on Agricultural Science and Technology Work, Nie Rongzhen specifically referred to the Four Modernizations as comprising agriculture, industry, national defense, and science and technology. The Cultural Revolution prevented and delayed implementation of the Four Modernizations for years. In 1975, in one of his last public acts, Zhou Enlai made another pitch for the Four Modernizations at the 4th National People&#x27;s Congress.

After Zhou&#x27;s death and Mao&#x27;s soon thereafter, Hua Guofeng assumed control of the party in 1976. Hua had the leadership of the Cultural Revolution arrested. Known as the Gang of Four, their arrest marked the end of the Cultural Revolution. This event enabled the enactment of the Four Modernizations. By 1977 all entities in every sector and at every level of society were focused on implementing the Four Modernizations. One core tenet was the rejection of the previously long-held concept known as the &quot;iron rice bowl&quot;.

The new idea was that all workers should not be paid the same, but rather, paid according to their productivity. The thinking was that in order to be a consumer society, China would need to be a producing society. In December 1978 at the 3rd plenary session of the 11th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Deng Xiaoping announced the official launch of the Four Modernizations, formally marking the beginning of the reform.

The science and technology modernization, although understood by Chinese leaders as being key to the transformation of industry and the economy, proved to be more of a theoretical goal than an achievable objective. This was primarily due to decades-long isolation of Chinese scientists from the international community, outmoded and outdated universities, and an overall lack of access to advanced scientific equipment, information technology, and management know-how.

Deng described a &quot;xiaokang&quot; society as a goal of the Four Modernizations. In a 1979 discussion with Japanese Prime Minister Masayoshi Ōhira, Deng used the concept to distinguish China&#x27;s path of development from other approaches, stating, &quot;The Four Modernizations we hope to realize are a Chinese Four Modernizations. Our conceptualization of the Four Modernizations is not like your conception of modernization, but it is a &quot;xiaokang&quot; family.&quot;

Recognizing the need for technical assistance to spur this most important modernization, the Chinese Government elicited the support of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in the fall of 1978 to scope out and provide financial resources for the implementation of an initial complement of targeted projects. The initial projects from 1979 to 1984 included the establishment of overseas on-the-job training and academic programs, set-up of information processing centers at key government units, and the development of methods to make informed decisions within the Chinese context based on market principles. The key advisor to the Chinese government on behalf of the UNDP was Jack Fensterstock of the United States. This first technical assistance effort (CPR/79-001) by the UNDP led to the entry of large-scale multilateral funding agencies including the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.

As part of the effort to pursue the Four Modernizations, the Chinese government revived plans for the Three Gorges Dam, emphasizing the need to develop hydroelectric power.

==Controversy==
On December 5, 1978, former Red Guard Wei Jingsheng posted &quot;democracy&quot; as the Fifth Modernization on the Democracy Wall in Beijing. He was arrested a few months later and jailed for 15 years until 1993.

<text>The Stakhanovite movement was a mass cultural movement for workers established by the Communist Party in the 1930s Soviet Union. Its promoters encouraged the rationalization of workplace processes—i.e., increased production goals—while promoting socialist emulation. 

The Stakhanovites modeled themselves after the mythic productivity of the Russian coal miner Alexei Stakhanov. As frontline workers they took pride in their aspirations to work harder and more efficiently than was required by ad hoc norms; thereby they saw themselves as contributing to the common good and strengthening the socialist state. The Party started the &#x27;movement&#x27; in the coal industry and then applied it to other industries across the Soviet Union. Initially popular, it eventually encountered resistance as the pressures for greater productivity placed increased and unrealistic demands on workers.

== History ==
The Stakhanovite movement was established and developed by the Soviet Communist Party; it was started in 1935 during the second Soviet five-year plan—as a new stage of sponsored socialist competition/socialist emulation, and as the continuation of the Party&#x27;s rapid industrialization initiative and its forced collectivization of farming begun seven years prior (1928). The movement took its name from Aleksei Grigorievich Stakhanov, who reportedly, on August 31, 1935, mined 102 tons of coal in less than 6 hours—some 14 times his shift quota. However, &quot;competitive&quot; Stakhanovite followers soon would &quot;break&quot; his record. On February 1, 1936, it was reported that Nikita Izotov had mined 640 tons of coal in a single shift.

Stakhanovite programs were quickly applied by the Party to other industries of the Soviet Union. Pioneers of the movement included (automobile industry), (shoe industry), and (textile industry), (machine tool industry), (timber industry), (railroad), Pasha Angelina (agriculture), and (agriculture), and many others.

On November 14–17, 1935, the first All-Union Stakhanovite Conference convened in Moscow at the Kremlin. The conference emphasized the &quot;outstanding&quot; role of the Stakhanovite movement in the socialist reconstruction of the national economy. In December 1935 the plenum of the Communist Party&#x27;s Central Committee specifically discussed aspects of developing industry and transport systems in light of the Stakhanovite movement.

Pursuing the objectives of the recent Party plenum, the Soviets organized a wide network of industrial training, specificly creating courses for foremen of socialist labor to initiate and support the movement in the various industry. They introduced Stakhanovite contests in many industries to find the best workers and encourage competition among them. In 1936 a number of industrial and technical conferences revised the projected production capacities of different industries and increased their outputs. 
Female Stakhanovites emerged less frequently than male, but a quarter of all trade-union women were designated as &quot;norm-breaking&quot;. Women working as milkmaids, calf tenders, and fieldworkers represented the preponderance of rural Stakhanovites.

Soviet authorities claimed that the Stakhanovite movement caused significant increases in labor productivity. It was reported that during the first five-year plan (1928–32) industrial labor productivity increased by 41%. During the second five-year plan (1933–1937) it reportedly increased by 82%. Discussions of the draft constitution in the 1930s were used to encourage a &quot;second wind&quot; for the movement.

During World War II, the Stakhanovites deployed different methods to increase productivity, such as working several machine-tools at a time and by combining professions. The Stakhanovites organized the (, or ; 200% or more of quota in a single shift).

== Opposition and termination ==
Not all workers were pleased with the pressures created by the Stakhanovites and the bureaucratic demands for increased productivity. Some groups held Stakhanov responsible for making their lives harder and threatened him for it. Opponents of the movement risked invoking the label of &quot;wrecker&quot; being charged against them by Soviet authorities.

In 1988, the Soviet newspaper &quot;Komsomolskaya Pravda&quot; stated that the widely propagandized personal achievements of Stakhanov actually were puffery. The paper insisted that Stakhanov had used a number of helpers on support work, while the output was tallied for him alone. According to the Soviet state media, the Stakhanov movement had eventually led to increased productivity by means of a better organization of workflow processes, including more specialization and better task sequencing.

== In fiction ==
* Yuri Krymov&#x27;s 1938 novel &quot;Tanker &quot;Derbent&quot;&quot;, and the 1941 feature film based on it, are about Stakhanovitism in oil transport across the Caspian Sea.
* Andrzej Wajda&#x27;s film &quot;Man of Marble&quot; explores the myth-making process behind a fictional Polish Stakhanovite, telling the story of his rise and eventual fall from grace.
* George Orwell&#x27;s novel &quot;Animal Farm&quot; has a representation of the Stakhanovites in the character of Boxer the Horse, whose motto is &quot;I will work harder!&quot;. 
* Harry Turtledove&#x27;s novel &quot;Fallout&quot;, from the Hot War trilogy, includes a character in eastern Russia who gets into trouble with local townspeople because he works hard like a Stakhanovite.
* Grigori Aleksandrov&#x27;s film &quot;Tanya&quot; centered on a female character who becomes a member of the Stakhanovite movement.

<doc id="161240" wikidata="Q160333" url="?curid=161240" title="Prosper Mérimée">
<text>Prosper Mérimée (; 28 September 1803 – 23 September 1870) was a French writer in the movement of Romanticism, one of the pioneers of the novella, a short novel or long short story. He was also a noted archaeologist and historian, an important figure in the history of architectural preservation. He is best known for his novella &quot;Carmen&quot;, which became the basis of Bizet&#x27;s opera &quot;Carmen&quot;. He learned Russian, a language for which he had great affection, before translating the work of several notable Russian writers, including Pushkin and Gogol, into French. From 1830 until 1860 he was the inspector of French historical monuments, responsible for the protection of many historic sites, including the medieval citadel of Carcassonne and the restoration of the façade of the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris. Along with the writer George Sand, he discovered the series of tapestries called &quot;The Lady and the Unicorn&quot;, arranging for their preservation. He was instrumental in the creation of Musée national du Moyen Âge in Paris, where the tapestries now are displayed. The official database of French monuments, the Base Mérimée, bears his name.

==Education and literary debut==
Prosper Mérimée was born in Paris, the First French Republic, on 28 September 1803, early in the Napoleonic era. His father Léonor was a painter who became professor of design at the École polytechnique, and studied the chemistry of oil paints. In 1807 his father was named Permanent Secretary of the Academy of Painting and Sculpture. His mother Anne was twenty-nine when he was born and was also a painter. His father&#x27;s sister, Augustine, was the mother of the physicist Augustin-Jean Fresnel and the orientalist Fulgence Fresnel. He was the great-grandson of French novelist Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont on his mother&#x27;s side.

Both of Mérimée&#x27;s parents spoke English well, traveled frequently to England and entertained many British guests. By the age of fifteen he was fluent in English. He had a talent for foreign languages, and besides English mastered classical Greek and Latin. Later in life he became fluent in Spanish, and could passably speak Serbian and Russian.

At the age of seven, Prosper was enrolled in the Lycée Napoléon, which after the fall of Napoleon in 1815 became the Lycée Henri-IV. His classmates and friends were the children of the elite of Restoration France, including Adrien Jussieu, son of famous botanist Antoine Laurent de Jussieu, and Jean-Jacques Ampère, son of André-Marie Ampère, famous for his research in physics and electrodynamics. In school he had a strong interest in history, and was fascinated by magic and the supernatural, which later became important elements in many of his stories.

He finished the Lycée with high marks in classical languages and in 1820 he began to study law, planning for a position in the royal administration. In 1822 he passed the legal examinations and received his license to practice law. However, his real passion was for French and foreign literature: In 1820 he translated the works of Ossian, the presumed ancient Gaelic poet, into French. At the beginning of the 1820s he frequented the salon of Juliette Récamier, a venerable figure in the literary and political life of Paris, where he met Chateaubriand and other prominent writers. In 1822, at the salons, he met Henri Beyle, twenty years older, who became one of his closest friends, and later became famous as a novelist under the pen name of Stendhal. He then began to attend the salon of Étienne Delécluze, a painter and art critic, whose members were interested in the new school of Romanticism in art and literature.

Between the spring of 1823 and the summer of 1824, he wrote his first literary works: a political and historical play called &quot;Cromwell&quot;; a satirical piece called &quot;Les Espagnols en Dannark&quot; (&quot;The Spanish in Denmark&quot;); and a set of six short theater pieces called the &quot;Théâtre de Clara Gazul&quot;, a witty commentary about the theater, politics and life which purported to be written by a Spanish actress, but which actually targeted current French politics and society. In March 1825 he read his new works at the salon of Delécluze. The first two works were quickly forgotten, but the scenes of Clara Gazul had considerable success with his literary friends. They were printed in the press under the name of their imaginary author, and were his first published work. Balzac described &quot;Clara Gazul&quot; as &quot;a decisive step in the modern literary revolution&quot;, and its fame soon reached beyond France; the German Romanticist Goethe wrote an article praising it. Mérimée was not so gracious toward Goethe; he called Goethe&#x27;s own work &quot;a combination of genius and German naïveté&quot;.

King Louis XVIII died in 1824, and the regime of the new King, Charles X, was much more authoritarian and reactionary. Mérimée and his friends became part of the liberal opposition to the regime. On 30 November 1825, he took part in a student demonstration led by the young but already famous Victor Hugo. He was invited to Hugo&#x27;s home, where he charmed the poet by making macaroni for him. Mérimée was drawn into the new romantic movement, led by the painter Eugène Delacroix and the writers Hugo, Alfred de Musset and Eugène Sue. In 1830 he attended the riotous premiere of Hugo&#x27;s play &quot;Hernani&quot;, bringing with him a group of friends, including Stendhal and the Russian writer Turgenev, to support Hugo. Hugo made an anagram from his name, transforming &quot;Prosper Mérimée&quot; into &quot;Premiere Prose&quot;.

In July 1827 he published in a literary journal a new work, &quot;La Guzla&quot;. Ostensibly it was a collection of poems from the ancient Adriatic province of Illyria (modern Croatia), and it was published under another assumed name, Hyacinthe Maglanovich. The poems were highly romantic, filled with phantoms and werewolves, and were intended as satirical commentary on the exaggerated and bombastic style of the era that people would get swept up in. This was especially true for works that included a foreign setting and placed an emphasis on local traditions. Mérimée drew upon many historic sources for his picturesque and gothic portrait of the Balkans, including a tale about vampires taken from the writings of the 18th-century French monk Dom Calmet. These poems, published in literary journals, were widely praised both in France and abroad. The Russian poet Alexander Pushkin had translated some of the poems in the book into Russian before he was notified by Mérimée, through his Russian friend Sobolevsky, that the poems, except for one Mérimée translated from a real Serbian poet, were not authentic. The book was not a commercial success, selling only a dozen copies, but the journals and press made Mérimée an important literary figure. From then on Mérimée&#x27;s stories and articles were regularly published by the two leading literary magazines of Paris, the &quot;Revue des deux Mondes&quot; and the &quot;Revue de Paris&quot;.

After &quot;La Guzla,&quot; he wrote three traditional novels: &quot;La Jacquerie&quot; (June 1828) was an historical novel about a peasant revolt in the Middle Ages, filled with flamboyant costumes, picturesque details and colorful settings. The critic Henri Patin reported that novel was &quot;lacking in drama, but many of the scenes were excellent&quot;. The second, &quot;La Famille Carvajal&quot; (1828), was a parody of the work of Lord Byron, set in 17th-century New Granada, filled with murders and crimes of passion. Many of the critics entirely missed that the novel was a parody: the &quot;Revue de Paris&quot; denounced the story for its &quot;brutal and shameful passions&quot;. The third was &quot;A Chronicle of the Reign of Charles IX&quot; (1829), another historical novel, set during the reign of Charles IX of France in the 16th century. It was written three years before Victor Hugo published his historical novel &quot;Notre-Dame de Paris&quot;. Mérimée&#x27;s story featured a combination of irony and extreme realism, including a detailed and bloody recreation of the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre. It was published in March 1829, without any great success, and its author was by then tired of the genre. &quot;I wrote a wicked novel that bores me&quot;, he wrote to his friend Albert Stapfer.

==Novellas, travels in Spain and government posts (1829–1834)==
In 1829, Mérimée found a new literary genre that perfectly suited his talents; the &quot;nouvelle&quot; or novella, essentially a long short story or short novel. Between 1829 and 1834, he wrote thirteen stories, following three basic principles; a brief story told in prose; a sparse and economical style of writing, with no unneeded lyricism; and a unity of action, all leading to the ending, which was often abrupt and brutal. In a short period Mérimée wrote two of his most famous novellas, &quot;Mateo Falcone&quot;, about a tragic vendetta in Corsica, and &quot;Tamango&quot;, a drama on a slave-trading ship, which were published in the &quot;Revue de Paris&quot;, and had considerable success.

He also began a series of long trips which provided material for much of his future writing. In June 1830 he traveled to Spain, which he explored at a leisurely pace, spending many hours in the Prado Museum in Madrid, attending bullfights, and studying Moorish architecture in Córdoba and Seville. He was in Spain in July 1830, when the government of Charles X of France was overthrown and replaced by the rule of Louis Philippe I. Fascinated by Spain, he decided not to return to France immediately, but to continue his journey. In October 1830 he met Cipriano Portocarrero, a liberal Spanish aristocrat and the future Count of Montijo, who shared many of his literary and historical interests and political views. He visited the Count and met his wife, the Countess of Montijo, and their young daughter, Eugénie, then four years old, who in 1853 was to become the Empress Eugénie, the wife of Emperor Napoleon III.

He returned to Paris in January 1831, and began publishing vivid accounts of his trip to Spain in the &quot;Revue de Paris&quot; under the title &quot;Lettres d&#x27;Espagne&quot;. These included the first mention of &quot;Carmen&quot;, a story told to him by the Countess of Montijo. He also sought a position in the new administration of King Louis Philippe. Many of his friends had already found jobs in the new government; Stendhal was named French consul to Trieste, and the writers Chateaubriand and Lamartine both received honorary government posts. Mérimée, twenty-seven years old, briefly served as the chief of the secretariat of the Ministry of the Navy, and then, as the new government was organized, was moved from post to post; for a short time he was director of fine arts, then was moved to the Interior Ministry, where, he wrote ironically, &quot;I conducted, with great glory, the telegraph lines, the administration of the corps of firemen, the municipal guards, etc.&quot; He turned out to be an efficient administrator, and was put in charge of organizing the response to the epidemic of cholera which struck Paris between 29 March and 1 October 1832, killing eighteen thousand Parisians. At the peak of the epidemic, he spent much of his time at the Hotel-Dieu, the main hospital of Paris. In November 1832 he was moved again to the State Council, where he became Chief of Accounts. He was not there for long; in December 1832 Prime Minister Adolphe Thiers sent him to London on an extended diplomatic mission to report on the British elections. He became a member of the most prominent London club, the Athenaeum, and consulted with the venerable French ambassador to England, Prince Talleyrand.

==Inspector-General of Historical Monuments (1833–1852)==
On 27 May 1833, Prime Minister Thiers named Mérimée inspector-general of historical monuments, with a salary of eight thousand francs a year, and all travel expenses paid. Mérimée wrote that the job perfectly suited &quot;his taste, his laziness, and his ideas of travel&quot;.

A large part of the architectural heritage of France, particularly the churches and monasteries, had been damaged or destroyed during the Revolution. Of the 300 churches in Paris in the 16th century, only 97 still were standing in 1800. The Basilica of St Denis had been stripped of its stained glass and monumental tombs, while the statues on the façade of the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris and the spire had been taken down. Throughout the country, churches and monasteries had been demolished or turned into barns, cafes, schools, or prisons. The first effort to catalog the remaining monuments was made in 1816 by Alexandre de Laborde, who wrote the first list of &quot;Monuments of France&quot;. In 1832 Victor Hugo wrote an article for the &quot;Revue des deux Mondes&quot; which declared war against the &quot;massacre of ancient stones&quot; and the &quot;demolishers&quot; of France&#x27;s past. King Louis Philippe declared that restoration of churches and other monuments would be a priority of his regime. In October 1830, the position of Inspector of Historical Monuments had been created by the Interior Minister, François Guizot, a professor of history at the Sorbonne. Mérimée became its second Inspector, and by far the most energetic and long-lasting. He held the position for twenty-seven years.

Mérimée had honed his bureaucratic skills in the Interior Ministry, and he understood the political and the financial challenges of the task. He approached his new duties methodically. He first organized a group of architects specialized and trained in restoration, and had the money that previously had been given to the Catholic Church for restoration transferred to his budget. On 31 July 1834, he set off on his first inspection tour of historic monuments, traveling for five months, describing and cataloging the monuments he saw. Between 1834 and 1852 he made nineteen inspection tours to different regions of France. The longest, to the Southeast and to Corsica, lasted five months, but most trips were shorter than a month. When he returned after each trip, he made a detailed report to the Ministry on what needed to be done. In addition, he wrote scholarly studies for journals of archaeology and history. His scholarly works included a survey of the religious architecture in France during the Middle Ages (1837) and of military monuments of the Gauls, Greeks and Romans (1839). Finally, he wrote a series of books for a popular audience about the monuments of each region, describing vividly a France that he declared was &quot;more unknown than Greece or Egypt&quot;.

In 1840 he published the first official List of Historic Monuments in France, with 934 entries. By 1848 the number had grown to 2,800. He organized a systematic review to prioritize restoration projects, and established a network of correspondents in each region who kept an eye on the projects, made new discoveries, and signaled any vandalism. Though he was a confirmed atheist, many of the buildings he protected and restored were churches, which he treated as works of art and shrines of national history. He often disputed with local church authorities, insisting that more recent architectural modifications be removed, and the buildings restored to their original appearance. He also confronted local governments who wanted to demolish or convert old structures. With the authority of the royal government behind him, he was able prevent the city of Dijon from turning the medieval Palace of Estates into an office building, and he stopped the city of Avignon from demolishing the medieval ramparts along the Rhône River to make way for railroad tracks.

He was assisted in several of his projects by the architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc. Viollet-le-Duc was twenty-six, and had studied mathematics and chemistry but not architecture; he learned his profession from practical experience and travel. In 1840 he worked the first time for Mérimeé; in one month he designed a solution which prevented the collapse of the medieval Vézelay Abbey. In 1842–43, Mérimée gave him a much more ambitious project, restoring the facades of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris. He returned the statues which had been removed during the French Revolution, and later restored the spire.

Mérimée warned his conservators to avoid the &quot;false-ancient&quot;: he ordered them to carry out &quot;the reproduction of that which manifestly existed. Reproduce with prudence the parts destroyed, where there exist certain traces. Don&#x27;t give yourself to inventions... When the traces of the ancient state are lost, the wisest is to copy the analog motifs in a building of the same type in the same province&quot;. However, some of his restorers, notably Viollet-le-Duc, were later criticized for sometimes being guided by the spirit of the gothic or romanesque architectural style, if the original appearance was not known.

He participated personally in the restoration of many of the monuments. His tastes and talents were well suited to archaeology, combining an unusual linguistic talent, accurate scholarship, remarkable historical appreciation, and a sincere love for the arts of design and construction. He had some practical skills in design. A few pieces of his own art are held by the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland. some of which, with other similar pieces, have been republished in his works.

In 1840–41, Mérimée made an extended tour of Italy, Greece and Asia Minor, visiting and writing about archaeological sites and ancient civilizations. His archaeology earned him a seat in the Académie française des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, and his stories and novellas won him a seat in the in 1844.
In 1842, he arranged for the French state to purchase a medieval building, the Hôtel d&#x27;Cluny, as well as the adjoining ruins of the Roman baths. He had them joined and supervised both the construction and the collection of medieval art to be displayed. The museum, now called the Musée national du Moyen Âge, opened on 16 March 1844.

In 1841, during one of his inspection tours, he stayed at the Château of Boussac, Creuse in the Limousin district of central France, in the company of George Sand, who lived nearby. Together they explored the castle, which had recently been taken over by the Sub-Prefecture. In an upstairs room they found the six tapestries of the series &quot;The Lady and the Unicorn&quot;. They had suffered from long neglect, and had been damaged by damp and mice, but Mérimée and Sand immediately recognized their value. Mérimée had the tapestries inscribed in the list of monuments and arranged for their conservation. In 1844 Sand wrote a novel about them and correctly dated them to the 15th century, using the ladies&#x27; costumes for reference. In 1861 they were purchased by the French state and brought to Paris, where they were restored and put on display in the Musée national du Moyen Âge, which Mérimée had helped create, where they can be seen today.

==&quot;La Vénus d&#x27;Ille&quot;, &quot;Colomba&quot; and &quot;Carmen&quot; (1837–1845)==
While he was researching historical monuments, Mérimée wrote three of his most famous novellas; &quot;La Vénus d&#x27;Ille&quot; (1837), &quot;Colomba&quot; (1840) and &quot;Carmen&quot; (1845). &quot;The Venus d&#x27;Ille&quot; was a by-product of his 1834 monument inspection tour to Roussillon, to the village of Casefabre and the Priory of Serrabina, near Ille-sur-Têt. The novella tells the story of a statue of Venus that comes to life and kills the son of its owner, whom it believes to be its husband. The story was inspired by a story of the Middle Ages recounted by the historian Freher. Using this story as an example, Mérimée described the art of writing fantasy literature; &quot;Don&#x27;t forget that when you recount something supernatural, one should describe as many details of concrete reality as possible. That is the great art of Hoffmann and his fantastic stories&quot;.

&quot;Colomba&quot; is a tragic story about a Corsican vendetta. The central character, Colomba, convinces her brother that he must kill a man to avenge an old wrong done to their family. This story was the result of his long trip to that island researching historic monuments, and is filled with details about Corsican culture and history. When it was published in the &quot;Revue des deux Mondes&quot; it had an immense popular success. It is still widely studied in French schools as an example of Romanticism.

&quot;Carmen&quot;, according to Mérimée, was based upon a story which the Countess of Montijo had told him during his visit to Spain in 1830. It tells of a beautiful &quot;Bohémienne&quot; (Romani) who robs a soldier, who then falls in love with her. Jealous over her, he kills another man and becomes an outlaw, then he discovers she is already married, and in jealousy he kills her husband. When he learns she has fallen in love with a picador, he kills her, and then is arrested and sentenced to death. In the original story told to Mérimée by the Countess, Carmen was not a &quot;Bohémienne&quot;, but since he was studying the Romani language and Romani culture in Spain and in the Balkans, he decided to give her that background. &quot;Carmen&quot; did not have the same popular success as &quot;Colomba&quot;. It did not become really famous until 1875, after Mérimée&#x27;s death, when it was made into opera by Georges Bizet. The opera &quot;Carmen&quot; made major changes to Mérimée&#x27;s story, including eliminating the role of Carmen&#x27;s husband.

Mérimée was anxious to solidify his literary reputation. He first campaigned methodically for election to the French Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres, the highest academic body, which he finally attained in November 1843. He next campaigned for a seat in the most famous literary body, the . He patiently lobbied the members each time a member died and a seat was vacant. He was finally elected on 14 March 1844, on the seventeenth round of voting.

==The Second Republic and translation of Russian literature (1848–1852)==
At the end of 1847 Mérimée completed a major work on Spanish history, the biography of Don Pedro I, King of Castile. It was six hundred pages long and published in five parts in the &quot;Journal des Deux Mondes&quot; between December 1847 and February 1848.

In 1847 he read &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; by Alexander Pushkin in French, and wanted to read all of Pushkin in the original language. He took as his Russian teacher Madame de Langrené, a Russian émigré who had once been the dame of honor of the Grand Duchess Marie, daughter of Tsar Nicholas I of Russia. By 1848 he was able to translate Pushkin&#x27;s &quot;The Queen of Spades&quot; into French; it was published on 15 July 1849 in the &quot;Revue des deux Mondes&quot;. He began to attend the literary salon of the Russian writers in Paris, the &quot;Cercle des Arts&quot; on rue Choiseul, to perfect his Russian. He translated two more Pushkin stories, &quot;The Bohemians&quot; and &quot;The Hussar&quot;, as well as &quot;Dead Souls&quot; and &quot;The Inspector General&quot; by Nikolai Gogol. He also wrote several essays on Russian history and literature. In 1852, he published a scholarly article, &quot;An Episode of the History of Russia; the False Dimitri&quot;, in the &quot;Revue des Deux Mondes&quot;.

In February 1848, as a member of the National Guard, he was a spectator at the French Revolution of 1848 that toppled King Louis Philippe and founded the French Second Republic. On 8 March, he wrote to his friend Madame de Montijo: &quot;Here we are in a republic, without enthusiasm, but determined to hold onto it because it is the sole chance of safety that we still have&quot;. The new government abolished the Bureau of Historic Monuments and merged its function into the Department of Fine Arts; however, Mérimée retained the position of Inspector of Historic Monuments, and his membership on the Commission of Historic Monuments. In December 1848, Louis Napoleon Bonaparte was elected the first president of Second Republic in December 1848, and Mérimée resumed his activity. In 1849 he helped organize a successful campaign to preserve the medieval Citadel of Carcassonne. In 1850 he arranged for the crypt of Saint-Laurent in Grenoble to be classified as an historical monument.

The year 1852 was difficult for Mérimée. On 30 April 1852, his mother, who lived with him and was very close to him, died. He also became entangled in a legal affair involving one of his friends, Count Libri Carrucci Della Sommaja, a professor of mathematics from Pisa Count who settled in France in 1824 and became a professor at the Sorbonne, a member of College of France, a holder of the Legion of Honor, and the Inspector General of Libraries of France. It was discovered that under his academic cover he was stealing valuable manuscripts from state libraries, including texts by Dante and Leonardo da Vinci, and reselling them. When he was exposed, he fled to England, taking 30,000 works in sixteen trunks, and claimed that he was victim of a plot. Though all the evidence was against Count Libri, Mérimée took his side, and in April 1852 wrote a scathing attack on Libri&#x27;s accusers in the &quot;Revue des deux Mondes&quot;. He attacked the incompetence of the prosecutors and blamed the Catholic Church for inventing the case. On the same day that his mother died, he was summoned before the state prosecutors, and was sentenced to fifteen days in prison and fined one thousand francs. The &quot;Revue des deux Mondes&quot; was also fined two hundred francs. Mérimée offered his resignation from the government, which was refused. He served his sentence inside one of his listed historic monuments, the Palais de la Cité prison, passing the time studying Russian irregular verbs.

==Advisor to the Empress and Senator of the Empire (1852–1860)==

In December 1851, President Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte was prevented by the French Constitution from running for re-election. Instead, he organized a coup and became Emperor Napoleon III. Mérimée accepted the coup philosophically, because he feared anarchy more than a monarchy, and because he saw no other practical option. While Mérimée accepted the coup, others, including Victor Hugo, did not. Hugo described his last meeting with Mérimée in Paris on 4 December 1851, just before Hugo went into exile: &quot;&#x27;Ah&#x27;, said M. Mérimée, &#x27;I am looking for you&#x27;. I answered, &#x27;I hope that you will not find me&#x27;. He extended his hand, and I turned my back. I have not seen him since. I consider that he is dead... M. Mérimée by nature is vile&quot;. The services of Mérimée were welcomed by the new Emperor; on 21 January 1852, soon after coup, he was promoted to officer of the Legion of Honor. The new Emperor gave a priority to the preservation of historic monuments, particularly the restoration of the cathedral of Notre-Dame, and Mérimée kept his position and for a time continued his tours of inspection.

Mérimée, without seeking it, soon had another close connection with the Emperor. Eugénie Montijo, the daughter of his close friends the Count and Countess of Montijo, had been invited to an event at the Palace of Saint Cloud, where she met the new Emperor. In November 1852 she was invited to the Palace of Fontainebleau, where the Emperor proposed marriage to her. They were married fifteen days later at the Tuileries Palace, and she became the Empress Eugénie. Honors followed immediately for Mérimée; he was made a Senator of the Empire, with a salary of 30,000 francs a year, and became the confidant and closest friend of the young Empress.

The mother of the Empress, the Countess of Montijo, returned to Spain, and Mérimée kept her informed of everything that the Empress did. He became involved in the court life, moving with the court from imperial residence to residence, to Biarritz, the Château de Compiègne, the Château de Saint-Cloud and Palais de Fontainebleau. It soon became clear the Empress was not the Emperor&#x27;s only romantic interest; Napoleon III continued his affairs with old mistresses, leaving the Empress often alone. Mérimée became her chief friend and protector at Court. He was obliged to attend all the court events, including masked balls, though he hated balls and dancing. He told stories, acted in plays, took part in charades, and &quot;made a fool of himself&quot;, as he wrote to his friend Jenny Dacquin in 1858. &quot;Every day we eat too much, and I am half dead. Destiny did not make me to be a courtesan...&quot; The only events he really enjoyed were the stays at the Château de Compiègne, where he organized lectures and discussions for the Emperor with leading French cultural figures, including Louis Pasteur and Charles Gounod. He met prominent visitors, including Otto von Bismarck, whom he described as &quot;very much a gentleman&quot; and &quot;more spiritual than the usual German&quot;.

He gave very little attention to his role as Senator; in seventeen years, he spoke in the chamber only three times. Mérimée had intended to devote a large part of his time to writing a major scholarly biography of Julius Caesar. However, when he informed the Emperor of this project, the Emperor expressed his own admiration for Caesar, and took over the project. Mérimée was obliged to give the Emperor all of his research, and to assist him in writing his book. &quot;The History of Julius Caesar&quot; was published on 10 March 1865, under the name of Napoleon III, and sold one hundred forty thousand copies on the first day.

==Last works, the fall of the Empire and death (1861–1870)==
He made his last long tour of monuments in 1853, though he remained the chief inspector of monuments until 1860. He continued to attend meetings of the Académie française and the Academy of Inscriptions. He wrote his last works, three novellas, in the genre of the fantastic: &quot;Djoûmane&quot; is a story about a soldier in North Africa who sees a sorcerer give a young woman to a snake, then realizes it was just a dream. It was not published until 1873, after his death; &quot;La Chambre bleu&quot;, written as an amusement for the Empress, is the story of two lovers in a hotel room, who are terrified to find a stream of blood coming under the door of their room, then realize it is only port wine. &quot;Lokis&quot; is a horror story borrowed from a Danish folk tale, about a creature which is half-man and half bear. This story was also written to amuse the Empress, and he read it aloud to the court in July 1869, but the subject matter shocked the court, and the children were sent from the room. It was published in September 1869 in the &quot;Revue des deux Mondes&quot;.

He continued to work for the preservation of monuments, attending meetings of the Commission and advising Boeswillwald, who had replaced him as Inspector of Monuments in 1860. On his urging the Commission acted to protect the medieval village of Cordes-sur-Ciel, the Château de Villebon, and the romanesque churches of Saint-Émilion. He also continued to develop his passion for Russian literature, with the help of his friend Turgenev and other Russian émigrés in Paris. He began writing a series of twelve articles on the life of Peter the Great, based on a work in Russian by Nikolai Ustrialov, which appeared in the &quot;Journal des Savants&quot; between June 1864 and February 1868. He wrote to a friend that &quot;Peter the Great was an abominable man surrounded by abominable villains. That is amusing enough for me&quot;. In 1869 he wrote to his friend Albert Stapfer that &quot;Russian is the most beautiful language in Europe, not excepting Greek. It is richer than German, and has a marvelous clarity... It has a great poet and another almost as grand, both killed in duels when they were young, and a great novelist, my friend Turgenev&quot;.

In the 1860s he still traveled regularly. He went to England every year between 1860 and 1869, sometimes on official business, organizing the French participation in the 1862 Universal Exposition of Fine Arts in London, and in 1868 to transfer two antique Roman busts from the British Museum to the Louvre, and to see his friend Anthony Panizzi, the director of the British Museum. In 1859 he visited Germany, Italy, Switzerland and Spain, where he attended his last bullfight.

By 1867, he was exhausted by the endless ceremonies and travels of the court, and thereafter he rarely participated in the imperial tours. He developed serious respiratory problems, and began to spend more and more time in the south of France, in Cannes. He became more and more conservative, opposing the more liberal reforms proposed by the Emperor in the 1860s. In May 1869 he declined an invitation to attend the opening of the Suez Canal by the Empress.

The political crisis between Prussia and France that began in May 1870 required his return from Cannes to Paris, where he participated in the emergency meetings of the Senate. His health worsened, and he only rarely could leave his house. The Empress sent him fruit from the imperial gardens, and on 24 June he was visited by his old lover, Valentine Delessert, and by Viollet-le-Duc. His health continued to decline; he told a friend: &quot;It&#x27;s well over. I see myself arriving at death, and am preparing myself&quot;.

The war with Prussia began with patriotic enthusiasm, but quickly turned into a debacle. The French Army and the Emperor were surrounded at Sedan. One of the leaders of the group of deputies advocating the creation of a republic, Adolphe Thiers, visited Mérimée to ask him to use his influence with the Empress for a transition of power, but the meeting was brief; Mérimée would not consider asking the Empress and Emperor to abdicate. He told his friends that he dreaded the arrival of a republic, which he called &quot;organized disorder&quot;.

On 2 September, news arrived in Paris that the army had capitulated and that Napoleon III had been taken prisoner. On 4 September, Mérimée got out of bed to attend the last meeting of the French Senate at the Luxembourg Palace. In the chamber he wrote a brief note to Panizzi: &quot;All that the most gloomy and most dark imagination could invent has been surpassed by events. There is a general collapse, a French Army which surrenders, and an Emperor who allows himself to be taken prisoner. All falls at once. At this moment the legislature is being invaded and we cannot deliberate any longer. The National Guard which we just armed pretends to govern. &quot;Adieu&quot;, my dear Panizzi, you know what I suffer&quot;. The Third Republic was proclaimed on the same day. Despite his illness, he hurried to the Tuileries Palace hoping to see the Empress, but the Palace was surrounded by armed soldiers and a crowd. The Empress fled for exile to London, and Mérimée did not see her again.

Mérimée returned to Cannes on 10 September. He died there on 23 September 1870, five days before his 67th birthday. Though he had been an outspoken atheist most of his life, at his request he was buried at the Cimetière du Grand Jas, the small cemetery of the Protestant church in Cannes. A few months later, in May 1871, during the Paris Commune, a mob burned his Paris home, along with his library, manuscripts, archaeological notes and collections because of his close association with the deposed Napoleon III.

==Personal life==
He lived with his mother and father in Paris until the death of his father in September 1837. From 1838 he shared an apartment with his mother on the Left Bank at 10 rue des Beaux-Arts, in the same building as the offices of the &quot;Revue des deux Mondes&quot;. They moved to a house at 18 rue Jacob in 1847 until his mother died in 1852.

Mérimée never married, but he needed female company. He had a series of romantic affairs, sometimes carried out by correspondence. In January 1828, during his youth, he was wounded in duel with the husband of his mistress at the time, Émilie Lacoste. In 1831 he began a relationship by correspondence with Jenny Dacquin. Their relationship continued for ten years, but they only met six or seven times, and then rarely alone. In 1873, after his death, she published all of his letters under the title &quot;Lettres à une inconnue&quot;, or &quot;Letters to an Unknown&quot;, in several volumes.

In his youth he had a mistress in Paris, Céline Cayot, an actress whom he supported financially and paid for an apartment. He then had a longer and more serious relationship with Valentine Delessert. Born in 1806, she was the daughter of Count Alexandre de Laborde, &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to King Louis Philippe, and she was married to Gabriel Delessert, a prominent banker and real estate developer, who was twenty years older. Mérimée met Delessert in 1830, and she became his mistress in 1836, when he was visiting Chartres, where her husband had been named Prefect. he wrote to Stendhal that &quot;She is my grand passion; I am deeply and seriously in love&quot;. Her husband, who had become prefect of police in Paris, apparently ignored the relationship. However, by 1846, the relationship had cooled, and while he was on one of his long tours, she became the mistress of another writer, Charles de Rémusat. His correspondence shows he was desolate when Delessert abandoned him for younger writers Rémusat and then, in 1854, for Maxime Du Camp. One consolation for Mérimée in his last years was a reconciliation with Delessert in 1866.

In 1833 he had a brief romantic liaison with the writer George Sand, which ended unhappily. After they spent a night together, they separated without warmth. She told a friend, the actress Marie Darval, &quot;I had Mérimèe last night, and it wasn&#x27;t much&quot;. Darval promptly told her friend Alexandre Dumas, who then told all of his friends. Mérimée promptly counter-attacked, calling her &quot;a woman debauched and cold, by curiosity more than by temperament&quot;. They continued to collaborate on common goals. They both played a part in 1834 in the discovery and preservation of &quot;The Lady and the Unicorn&quot; tapestries; he declared the tapestries were of historic value, and she publicized them in one of her novels. In 1849 he assisted her when she asked that the paintings in the church of Nohant, where she lived, be classified, which he did. He also provided a subsidy of 600 francs to the church. However, she deeply offended him by openly ridiculing the Empress Eugénie. At their last meeting in 1866, he found her hostile. She came to visit him a few days before his death, but he refused to see her.

When he traveled on his inspection trips around France, he often sought the company of prostitutes. He was often cynical about his relationships, writing, &quot;There are two kinds of women; those who are worth the sacrifice of your life, and those who are worth between five and forty francs.” Many years later he wrote to Jenny Dacquin, &quot;It is a fact that at one time of my life I frequented bad society, but I was attracted to it through curiosity only, and I was there as a stranger in a strange country. As for good society, I found it often enough deadly tiresome.&quot;

He had a very close friendship with Stendhal, who was twenty years older, when they were both aspiring writers, but the friendship later became strained as Mérimée&#x27;s literary success exceeded that of Stendhal. They traveled together to Rome and Naples in November 1837, but in his correspondence Stendhal complained of the vanity of Mérimée and called him &quot;his Pedantry, Mister Academus&quot;. The early death of Stendhal in Paris on 23 March 1842, shocked Mérimée. He offered his correspondence from Stendhal to the &quot;Revue des deux Mondes&quot;, but the editor refused them as not worthy of attention. In 1850, eight years after the death of Stendhal, Mérimée wrote a brief brochure of sixteen pages describing the romantic adventures that he and Stendhal had had together in Paris, leaving most of the names blank. Only twenty-five copies were made, and distributed to friends of Stendhal. The brochure caused a scandal; Mérimée was denounced as an &quot;atheist&quot; and &quot;blasphemer&quot; by friends of Stendhal for suggesting that Stendhal had ever behaved improperly. He responded that he simply wanted to show that Stendhal was a genius but not a saint.

The poet and critic Charles Baudelaire compared the personality of Mérimée with that of the painter Eugène Delacroix, both men suddenly thrust into celebrity in the artistic and literary world of Paris. He wrote that they both shared &quot;the same apparent coldness, lightly affected, the same mantle of ice covering a shy sensibility, an ardent passion for the good and the beautiful, the same hypocrisy of egoism, the same devotion to secret friends and to the ideas of perfection&quot;.

Politically, Mérimée was a liberal in the style of the Doctrinaires, welcomed the July Monarchy, and maintained an affection for Adolphe Thiers and Victor Cousin, with whom he maintained a lifelong correspondence. After the uprisings of 1848, he opted for the stability offered by Emperor Napoleon III, which earned him the ire of the republican opposition such as Victor Hugo. Despite his close relations with the Emperor, Mérimée remained a committed Voltairean and opposed to both &quot;papists&quot; and legitimists (ultra-royalists). He likewise became more critical of both the domestic and foreign policies of the Empire after 1859, and opposed the military adventures in Mexico.

==Literary criticism==
In his later years, Mérimée had very little good to say about other French and European writers, with a few exceptions, such as his friends Stendhal and Turgenev. Most of his criticism was contained in his correspondence with his friends. He described the later works of Victor Hugo as &quot;words without ideas&quot;. Describing &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, Mérimée wrote: &quot;What a shame that this man who has such beautiful images at his disposal lacks even a shadow of good sense or modesty, and is unable to refrain from saying these platitudes not worthy of an honest man&quot;. He wrote his friend Madame Montijo that the book was &quot;perfectly mediocre; not a moment that is natural&quot;. Speaking of Flaubert and &quot;Madame Bovary&quot;, he was a little kinder. He wrote: &quot;There is a talent there which he wastes under the pretext of realism&quot;. Describing the &quot;Fleurs du mal&quot; by Baudelaire, he wrote: &quot;Simply mediocre, nothing dangerous. There are a few sparks of poetry... the work of a poor young man who doesn&#x27;t know life... I don&#x27;t know the author, but I&#x27;ll wager that he is naïve and honest. That&#x27;s why I hope they don&#x27;t burn him.&quot;

In an essay of October 1851, he attacked the entire genre of Realism and Naturalism in literature: &quot;There is a tendency in almost all of our modern school to arrive at a faithful imitation of nature, but is that the objective of art? I don&#x27;t believe so&quot;.

He was equally scathing in his descriptions of the foreign writers of his time, with the exception of the Russians, particularly Turgenev, Pushkin and Gogol, whom he admired. Of Charles Dickens he wrote: &quot;[He] is the greatest one among the pygmies. He has the misfortune of being paid by the line, and he loves money&quot;. He was even harsher toward the Germans: Goethe was &quot;a great humbug&quot;, Kant was a &quot;chaos of obscurity&quot;, and of Wagner he wrote: &quot;There is nothing like the Germans for audacity in stupidity&quot;.

In return, Mérimée was attacked by Victor Hugo, who had admired Mérimée at the beginning of his career, but never forgave him for becoming a senator under Napoleon III. In one of his later poems, he described a scene as being &quot;flat as Mérimée&quot;.

==Legacy and place in French literature==
Mérimée&#x27;s best-known literary work is the novella &quot;Carmen&quot;, though it is known principally because of the fame of the opera made from the story by Georges Bizet after his death. He is also known as one of the pioneers of the short story and novella, and also as an innovator in fantasy fiction. His novellas, particularly &quot;Colomba&quot;, &quot;Mateo Falcone&quot;, &quot;Tamango&quot; and &quot;La Vénus d&#x27;Ille&quot;, are widely taught in French schools as examples of vivid style and concision.

Mérimée was an important figure in the Romantic movement of French literature in the 19th century. Like the other Romantics, he used picturesque and exotic settings (particularly Spain and Corsica) to create an atmosphere, and looked more often at the Middle Ages than to classical Greece or Rome for his inspiration. He also frequently used themes of fantasy and the supernatural in his stories, or, like Victor Hugo, used the Middle Ages as his setting. He used a careful selection of details, often noted during his travels, to create the setting. He often wrote about the rapport of force between his characters; man and woman, slave and master, father and son, and his stories often featured extreme passions, violence, cruelty and horror, and usually ended abruptly in a death or tragedy. He told his stories with a certain distance and ironic tone that was particularly his own.

His development and mastery of the &quot;nouvelle&quot;, a long short story or short novel, was another notable contribution to French literature. When he began his writing career in the 1830s, the most prominent genres were the drama (Victor Hugo and Musset), poetry (Hugo, Lamartine and Vigny), and the autobiography (Chateaubriand). Mérimée perfected the short story, with an economy of words and action. The contemporary literary critic Sainte-Beuve wrote: &quot;...He goes right to the fact, and goes immediately into action... his story is clear, lean, alert, vivid. In the dialogues of his characters there is not a useless word, and in his actions he lays out in this advance exactly how and why it will have to happen&quot;. In this genre, he was the contemporary of Edgar Allan Poe and the predecessor of Guy de Maupassant.

Mérimée&#x27;s other important cultural legacy is the system of classification of historic monuments that he established, and the major sites that he saved, included the walled citadel of Carcasonne, and his part in the foundation of the National Museum of Medieval History in Paris. The French national list of heritage monuments is called the Base Mérimée in his honor. Another part of his legacy is the discovery and preservation of &quot;The Lady and the Unicorn&quot; tapestries now on display in the National Museum of Medieval History.

Mérimée&#x27;s works have received multiple adaptations in various media. In addition to the multiple adaptations of &quot;Carmen&quot;, several of his other novellas, notably &quot;Lokis&quot; and &quot;La Vénus d&#x27;Ille&quot;, have been adapted for film and television.

<doc id="161241" wikidata="Q339495" url="?curid=161241" title="Altitude (triangle)">
<text>In geometry, an altitude of a triangle is a line segment through a given vertex (called &quot;apex&quot;) and perpendicular to a line containing the side or edge opposite the apex. This (finite) edge and (infinite) line extension are called, respectively, the &quot;base&quot; and &quot;extended base&quot; of the altitude. The point at the intersection of the extended base and the altitude is called the foot of the altitude. The length of the altitude, often simply called &quot;the altitude&quot; or &quot;height&quot;, symbol , is the distance between the foot and the apex. The process of drawing the altitude from a vertex to the foot is known as &quot;dropping the altitude&quot; at that vertex. It is a special case of orthogonal projection.

Altitudes can be used in the computation of the area of a triangle: one-half of the product of an altitude&#x27;s length and its base&#x27;s length (symbol ) equals the triangle&#x27;s area: /2. Thus, the longest altitude is perpendicular to the shortest side of the triangle. The altitudes are also related to the sides of the triangle through the trigonometric functions.

In an isosceles triangle (a triangle with two congruent sides), the altitude having the incongruent side as its base will have the midpoint of that side as its foot. Also the altitude having the incongruent side as its base will be the angle bisector of the vertex angle.

In a right triangle, the altitude drawn to the hypotenuse divides the hypotenuse into two segments of lengths and . If we denote the length of the altitude by , we then have the relation
:formula_1  (Geometric mean theorem; see Special Cases, inverse Pythagorean theorem)
For acute triangles, the feet of the altitudes all fall on the triangle&#x27;s sides (not extended). In an obtuse triangle (one with an obtuse angle), the foot of the altitude to the obtuse-angled vertex falls in the interior of the opposite side, but the feet of the altitudes to the acute-angled vertices fall on the opposite extended side, exterior to the triangle. This is illustrated in the adjacent diagram: in this obtuse triangle, an altitude dropped perpendicularly from the top vertex, which has an acute angle, intersects the extended horizontal side outside the triangle.

==Theorems==

===Orthocenter===
===Altitude in terms of the sides===

For any triangle with sides and semiperimeter formula_2 the altitude from side (the base) is given by

:formula_3

This follows from combining Heron&#x27;s formula for the area of a triangle in terms of the sides with the area formula formula_4 where the base is taken as side and the height is the altitude from the vertex (opposite side ).

By exchanging with or , this equation can also used to find the altitudes and , respectively.

===Inradius theorems===

Consider an arbitrary triangle with sides and with corresponding
altitudes . The altitudes and the incircle radius are related by

:formula_5

===Circumradius theorem===

Denoting the altitude from one side of a triangle as , the other two sides as and , and the triangle&#x27;s circumradius (radius of the triangle&#x27;s circumscribed circle) as , the altitude is given by

:formula_6

===Interior point===

If are the perpendicular distances from any point to the sides, and are the altitudes to the respective sides, then

:formula_7

===Area theorem===

Denoting the altitudes of any triangle from sides respectively as , and denoting the semi-sum of the reciprocals of the altitudes as formula_8 we have

:formula_9

===General point on an altitude===

If is any point on an altitude of any triangle , then
:formula_10

===Triangle inequality===

Since the area of the triangle is formula_11, the triangle inequality formula_12 implies 
:formula_13.

===Special cases===

====Equilateral triangle====

From any point within an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendiculars to the three sides is equal to the altitude of the triangle. This is Viviani&#x27;s theorem.

====Right triangle====
In a right triangle with legs and and hypotenuse , each of the legs is also an altitude: and . The third altitude can be found by the relation

:formula_14

This is also known as the inverse Pythagorean theorem.

Note in particular:
:formula_15

<doc id="161242" wikidata="Q193417" url="?curid=161242" title="Madame Bovary">
<text>Madame Bovary (; ), originally published as Madame Bovary: Provincial Manners ( ), is a novel by French writer Gustave Flaubert, published in 1857. The eponymous character lives beyond her means in order to escape the banalities and emptiness of provincial life.

When the novel was first serialized in &quot;Revue de Paris&quot; between 1 October and 15 December 1856, public prosecutors attacked the novel for obscenity. The resulting trial in January 1857 made the story notorious. After Flaubert&#x27;s acquittal on 7 February 1857, &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; became a bestseller in April 1857 when it was published in two volumes. A seminal work of literary realism, the novel is now considered Flaubert&#x27;s masterpiece, and one of the most influential literary works in history.

==Plot synopsis==
Charles Bovary is a shy, oddly dressed teenager who becomes an &quot;Officier de santé&quot; in the Public Health Service. He marries the woman his mother has chosen for him, the unpleasant but supposedly rich widow Héloïse Dubuc. He sets out to build a practice in the village of Tostes.

One day, Charles visits a local farm to set the owner&#x27;s broken leg and meets his patient&#x27;s daughter, Emma Rouault. Emma is a beautiful, poetically dressed young woman who has a yearning for luxury and romance inspired by reading popular novels. Charles is immediately attracted to her, and when Héloïse dies, Charles waits a decent interval before courting Emma in earnest. Her father gives his consent, and Emma and Charles marry.

Emma finds her married life dull and becomes listless. Charles decides his wife needs a change of scenery and moves his practice to the larger market town of Yonville. There, Emma gives birth to a daughter, Berthe, but motherhood proves a disappointment to Emma. She becomes infatuated with Léon Dupuis, a law student who shares Emma&#x27;s appreciation for literature and music. Emma does not acknowledge her passion for Léon, who departs for Paris to continue his studies.

Next, Emma begins an affair with a rich and rakish landowner, Rodolphe Boulanger. After four years, she insists they run away together. Rodolphe does not share her enthusiasm for this plan and on the eve of their planned departure, he ends the relationship with a letter placed at the bottom of a basket of apricots delivered to Emma. The shock is so great that Emma falls deathly ill and returns to religion.

When Emma recovers, she and Charles attend the opera, at Charles&#x27; insistence, in nearby Rouen. The opera reawakens Emma&#x27;s passions, and she re-encounters Léon who, now educated and working in Rouen, is also attending the opera. They begin an affair. Emma indulges her fancy for luxury goods and clothes with purchases made on credit from the merchant Lheureux, who arranges for her to obtain power of attorney over Charles&#x27; estate.

When Lheureux calls in Bovary&#x27;s debt, Emma pleads for money from several people, only to be turned down. In despair, she swallows arsenic and dies an agonizing death. Charles, heartbroken, abandons himself to grief, stops working, and lives by selling off his possessions. When he dies, his young daughter Berthe is placed with her grandmother, who soon dies. Berthe lives with an impoverished aunt, who sends her to work in a cotton mill. The book concludes with the local pharmacist Homais, who had competed with Charles&#x27; medical practice, gaining prominence among Yonville people and being rewarded for his medical achievements.

==Characters==
Emma Bovary is the novel&#x27;s eponymous protagonist. She has a highly romanticized view of the world and craves beauty, wealth, passion, as well as high society.

Charles Bovary, Emma&#x27;s husband, is a very simple and common man. He is an &quot;officier de santé&quot;, or &quot;health officer&quot;.

Rodolphe Boulanger is a wealthy local man who seduces Emma as one in a long string of mistresses.

Léon Dupuis is a clerk who introduces Emma to poetry and who falls in love with her.

Monsieur Lheureux is a sly merchant who lends money to Charles and leads the Bovarys into debt and financial ruin.

Monsieur Homais is the town pharmacist.

Justin is Monsieur Homais&#x27; apprentice and second cousin who harbors a crush on Emma.

==Style==
The book was in some ways inspired by the life of a schoolfriend of the author who became a doctor. Flaubert&#x27;s friend and mentor, Louis Bouilhet, had suggested to him that this might be a suitably &quot;down-to-earth&quot; subject for a novel and that Flaubert should attempt to write in a &quot;natural way,&quot; without digressions. The writing style was of supreme importance to Flaubert. While writing the novel, he wrote that it would be &quot;a book about nothing, a book dependent on nothing external, which would be held together by the internal strength of its style&quot;, an aim which, for the critic Jean Rousset, made Flaubert &quot;the first in date of the non-figurative novelists&quot;, such as James Joyce and Virginia Woolf. Though Flaubert avowed no liking for the style of Balzac, the novel he produced became arguably a prime example and an enhancement of literary realism in the vein of Balzac. The &quot;realism&quot; in the novel was to prove an important element in the trial for obscenity: the lead prosecutor argued that not only was the novel immoral, but that realism in literature was an offence against art and decency.

The realist movement was, in part, a reaction against romanticism. Emma may be said to be the embodiment of a romantic: in her mental and emotional process, she has no relation to the realities of her world. Although in some ways he may seem to identify with Emma, Flaubert frequently mocks her romantic daydreaming and taste in literature. The accuracy of Flaubert&#x27;s supposed assertion that &quot;Madame Bovary, c&#x27;est moi&quot; (&quot;Madame Bovary is me&quot;) has been questioned. In his letters, he distanced himself from the sentiments in the novel. To Edma Roger des Genettes, he wrote, &quot;Tout ce que j&#x27;aime n&#x27;y est pas&quot; (&quot;all that I love is not there&quot;) and to Marie-Sophie Leroyer de Chantepie, &quot;je n&#x27;y ai rien mis ni de mes sentiments ni de mon existence&quot; (&quot;I have used nothing of my feelings or of my life&quot;). For Mario Vargas Llosa, &quot;If Emma Bovary had not read all those novels, it is possible that her fate might have been different.&quot;

&quot;Madame Bovary&quot; has been seen as a commentary on the bourgeoisie, the folly of aspirations that can never be realized or a belief in the validity of a self-satisfied, deluded personal culture, associated with Flaubert&#x27;s period, especially during the reign of Louis Philippe, when the middle class grew to become more identifiable in contrast to the working class and the nobility. Flaubert despised the bourgeoisie. In his Dictionary of Received Ideas, the bourgeoisie is characterized by intellectual and spiritual superficiality, raw ambition, shallow culture, a love of material things, greed, and above all a mindless parroting of sentiments and beliefs.

For Vargas Llosa, &quot;Emma&#x27;s drama is the gap between illusion and reality, the distance between desire and its fulfillment&quot; and shows &quot;the first signs of alienation that a century later will take hold of men and women in industrial societies.&quot;

==Literary significance and reception==
Long established as one of the greatest novels, the book has been described as a &quot;perfect&quot; work of fiction. Henry James wrote: &quot;&quot;Madame Bovary&quot; has a perfection that not only stamps it, but that makes it stand almost alone: it holds itself with such a supreme unapproachable assurance as both excites and defies judgment.&quot; Marcel Proust praised the &quot;grammatical purity&quot; of Flaubert&#x27;s style, while Vladimir Nabokov said that &quot;stylistically it is prose doing what poetry is supposed to do&quot;. Similarly, in his preface to his novel &quot;The Joke&quot;, Milan Kundera wrote, &quot;not until the work of Flaubert did prose lose the stigma of aesthetic inferiority. Ever since &quot;Madame Bovary&quot;, the art of the novel has been considered equal to the art of poetry.&quot; Giorgio de Chirico said that in his opinion &quot;from the narrative point of view, the most perfect book is &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; by Flaubert&quot;. Julian Barnes called it the best novel that has ever been written.

The novel exemplifies the tendency of realism, over the course of the nineteenth century, to become increasingly psychological, concerned with the accurate representation of thoughts and emotions rather than of external things. Thus it prefigures the work of modernist novelists Marcel Proust, Virginia Woolf and James Joyce.

The book was controversial upon its release: its scandalous subject matter led to an obscenity trial in 1857. Flaubert was acquitted. &quot;Le Figaro&quot; was negative of the work. They stated, &quot;Monsieur Flaubert is not a writer.&quot;

==English translations==
# The first to attempt a translation was Juliet Herbert, who worked closely with the author. For lack of a publishing contract, Flaubert dropped the project.
# Then in 1878, George Saintsbury published an essay containing translations of excerpts from the novel.

The script had begun life as a straight adaptation of &quot;Madame Bovary&quot;, but Lean convinced writer Robert Bolt to re-work it into another setting.

===Other adaptations===
* Emmanuel Bondeville&#x27;s opera &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; was produced in 1951.
* Posy Simmonds&#x27; 1999 graphic novel &quot;Gemma Bovery&quot; (and Anne Fontaine&#x27;s film adaptation) reworked the story into a satirical tale of English expatriates in France.
* &quot;Abraham&#x27;s Valley&quot; in 1993, directed by Manoel de Oliveira, is a close adaptation set in Portugal, in which the novel is mentioned and discussed several times.
* The novel was loosely adapted in the Christian video series &quot;VeggieTales&quot; under the name &quot;Madame Blueberry&quot; and established the titular character herself as part of the series’s main cast.

<doc id="161243" wikidata="Q214533" url="?curid=161243" title="Nine-point circle">
<text>In geometry, the nine-point circle is a circle that can be constructed for any given triangle. It is so named because it passes through nine significant concyclic points defined from the triangle. These nine points are:

* The midpoint of each side of the triangle
* The foot of each altitude
* The midpoint of the line segment from each vertex of the triangle to the orthocenter (where the three altitudes meet; these line segments lie on their respective altitudes).

The nine-point circle is also known as Feuerbach&#x27;s circle (after Karl Wilhelm Feuerbach), Euler&#x27;s circle (after Leonhard Euler), Terquem&#x27;s circle (after Olry Terquem), the six-points circle, the twelve-points circle, the -point circle, the medioscribed circle, the mid circle or the circum-midcircle. Its center is the nine-point center of the triangle.

==Nine Significant Points of Nine Point Circle==

The diagram above shows the nine significant points of the nine-point circle. Points are the midpoints of the three sides of the triangle. Points are the feet of the altitudes of the triangle. Points are the midpoints of the line segments between each altitude&#x27;s vertex intersection (points ) and the triangle&#x27;s orthocenter (point ).

For an acute triangle, six of the points (the midpoints and altitude feet) lie on the triangle itself; for an obtuse triangle two of the altitudes have feet outside the triangle, but these feet still belong to the nine-point circle.

==Discovery==

Although he is credited for its discovery, Karl Wilhelm Feuerbach did not entirely discover the nine-point circle, but rather the six-point circle, recognizing the significance of the midpoints of the three sides of the triangle and the feet of the altitudes of that triangle. (&quot;See Fig. 1, points&quot; .) (At a slightly earlier date, Charles Brianchon and Jean-Victor Poncelet had stated and proven the same theorem.) But soon after Feuerbach, mathematician Olry Terquem himself proved the existence of the circle. He was the first to recognize the added significance of the three midpoints between the triangle&#x27;s vertices and the orthocenter. (&quot;See Fig. 1, points&quot; .) Thus, Terquem was the first to use the name nine-point circle.

==Tangent circles==

In 1822 Karl Feuerbach discovered that any triangle&#x27;s nine-point circle is externally tangent to that triangle&#x27;s three excircles and internally tangent to its incircle; this result is known as Feuerbach&#x27;s theorem. He proved that:... the circle which passes through the feet of the altitudes of a triangle is tangent to all four circles which in turn are tangent to the three sides of the triangle... 

The triangle center at which the incircle and the nine-point circle touch is called the Feuerbach point.

==Other properties of the nine-point circle==

* The radius of a triangle&#x27;s circumcircle is twice the radius of that triangle&#x27;s nine-point circle.

&quot;Figure 3&quot;

* A nine-point circle bisects a line segment going from the corresponding triangle&#x27;s orthocenter to any point on its circumcircle.

&quot;Figure 4&quot;

* The center of the nine-point circle bisects a segment from the orthocenter to the circumcenter (making the orthocenter a center of dilation to both circles):

::formula_1

* The nine-point center is one-fourth of the way along the Euler line from the centroid to the orthocenter :

::formula_2

* Let be the nine-point circle of the diagonal triangle of a cyclic quadrilateral. The point of intersection of the bimedians of the cyclic quadrilateral belongs to the nine-point circle.
* The nine-point circle of a reference triangle is the circumcircle of both the reference triangle&#x27;s medial triangle (with vertices at the midpoints of the sides of the reference triangle) and its orthic triangle (with vertices at the feet of the reference triangle&#x27;s altitudes).
* The center of all rectangular hyperbolas that pass through the vertices of a triangle lies on its nine-point circle. Examples include the well-known rectangular hyperbolas of Keipert, Jeřábek and Feuerbach. This fact is known as the Feuerbach conic theorem.

* If an orthocentric system of four points is given, then the four triangles formed by any combination of three distinct points of that system all share the same nine-point circle. This is a consequence of symmetry: the &quot;sides&quot; of one triangle adjacent to a vertex that is an orthocenter to another triangle are &quot;segments&quot; from that second triangle. A third midpoint lies on their common side. (The same &#x27;midpoints&#x27; defining separate nine-point circles, those circles must be concurrent.)
* Consequently, these four triangles have circumcircles with identical radii. Let represent the common nine-point center and be an arbitrary point in the plane of the orthocentric system. Then

:where is the common circumradius; and if

::formula_4

:where is kept constant, then the locus of is a circle centered at with a radius formula_5 As approaches the locus of for the corresponding constant , collapses onto the nine-point center. Furthermore the nine-point circle is the locus of such that

* The centers of the incircle and excircles of a triangle form an orthocentric system. The nine-point circle created for that orthocentric system is the circumcircle of the original triangle. The feet of the altitudes in the orthocentric system are the vertices of the original triangle.
* If four arbitrary points are given that do not form an orthocentric system, then the nine-point circles of concur at a point, the Poncelet point of . The remaining six intersection points of these nine-point circles each concur with the midpoints of the four triangles. Remarkably, there exists a unique nine-point conic, centered at the centroid of these four arbitrary points, that passes through all seven points of intersection of these nine-point circles. Furthermore, because of the Feuerbach conic theorem mentioned above, there exists a unique rectangular circumconic, centered at the common intersection point of the four nine-point circles, that passes through the four original arbitrary points as well as the orthocenters of the four triangles.
* If four points are given that form a cyclic quadrilateral, then the nine-point circles of concur at the anticenter of the cyclic quadrilateral. The nine-point circles are all congruent with a radius of half that of the cyclic quadrilateral&#x27;s circumcircle. The nine-point circles form a set of four Johnson circles. Consequently, the four nine-point centers are cyclic and lie on a circle congruent to the four nine-point circles that is centered at the anticenter of the cyclic quadrilateral. Furthermore, the cyclic quadrilateral formed from the four nine-pont centers is homothetic to the reference cyclic quadrilateral by a factor of – and its homothetic center lies on the line connecting the circumcenter to the anticenter where

==Generalization==

The circle is an instance of a conic section and the nine-point circle is an instance of the general nine-point conic that has been constructed with relation to a triangle and a fourth point , where the particular nine-point circle instance arises when is the orthocenter of . The vertices of the triangle and determine a complete quadrilateral and three &quot;diagonal points&quot; where opposite sides of the quadrilateral intersect. There are six &quot;sidelines&quot; in the quadrilateral; the nine-point conic intersects the midpoints of these and also includes the diagonal points. The conic is an ellipse when is interior to or in a region sharing vertical angles with the triangle, but a nine-point hyperbola occurs when is in one of the three adjacent regions, and the hyperbola is rectangular when P lies on the circumcircle of .

<doc id="161244" wikidata="Q10621500" url="?curid=161244" title="Orthocenter">
<text>The orthocenter of a triangle, usually denoted by , is the point where the three (possibly extended) altitudes intersect. The orthocenter lies inside the triangle if and only if the triangle is acute. For a right triangle, the orthocenter coincides with the vertex at the right angle.

==Formulation==
Let denote the vertices and also the angles of the triangle, and let formula_1 be the side lengths. The orthocenter has trilinear coordinates

formula_2

and barycentric coordinates

formula_3

Since barycentric coordinates are all positive for a point in a triangle&#x27;s interior but at least one is negative for a point in the exterior, and two of the barycentric coordinates are zero for a vertex point, the barycentric coordinates given for the orthocenter show that the orthocenter is in an acute triangle&#x27;s interior, on the right-angled vertex of a right triangle, and exterior to an obtuse triangle.

In the complex plane, let the points represent the numbers and assume that the circumcenter of triangle is located at the origin of the plane. Then, the complex number

:formula_4

is represented by the point , namely the altitude of triangle . From this, the following characterizations of the orthocenter by means of free vectors can be established straightforwardly:

:formula_5

The first of the previous vector identities is also known as the &quot;problem of Sylvester&quot;, proposed by James Joseph Sylvester.

==Properties==

Let denote the feet of the altitudes from respectively. Then:

*The product of the lengths of the segments that the orthocenter divides an altitude into is the same for all three altitudes:
:formula_6
:The circle centered at having radius the square root of this constant is the triangle&#x27;s polar circle.

*The sum of the ratios on the three altitudes of the distance of the orthocenter from the base to the length of the altitude is 1: (This property and the next one are applications of a more general property of any interior point and the three cevians through it.)
:formula_7

*The sum of the ratios on the three altitudes of the distance of the orthocenter from the vertex to the length of the altitude is 2:
:formula_8

*The isogonal conjugate of the orthocenter is the circumcenter of the triangle.
*The isotomic conjugate of the orthocenter is the symmedian point of the anticomplementary triangle.
*Four points in the plane, such that one of them is the orthocenter of the triangle formed by the other three, is called an orthocentric system or orthocentric quadrangle.

==Orthocentric system==
==Relation with circles and conics==

Denote the circumradius of the triangle by . Then

:formula_9

In addition, denoting as the radius of the triangle&#x27;s incircle, as the radii of its excircles, and again as the radius of its circumcircle, the following relations hold regarding the distances of the orthocenter from the vertices:

:formula_10

If any altitude, for example, , is extended to intersect the circumcircle at , so that is a chord of the circumcircle, then the foot bisects segment :
:formula_11

The directrices of all parabolas that are externally tangent to one side of a triangle and tangent to the extensions of the other sides pass through the orthocenter.

A circumconic passing through the orthocenter of a triangle is a rectangular hyperbola.

==Relation to other centers, the nine-point circle==

The orthocenter , the centroid , the circumcenter , and the center of the nine-point circle all lie on a single line, known as the Euler line. The center of the nine-point circle lies at the midpoint of the Euler line, between the orthocenter and the circumcenter, and the distance between the centroid and the circumcenter is half of that between the centroid and the orthocenter:

:formula_12

The orthocenter is closer to the incenter than it is to the centroid, and the orthocenter is farther than the incenter is from the centroid:

:formula_13

In terms of the sides , , , inradius and circumradius ,

:formula_14

==Orthic triangle==

If the triangle is oblique (does not contain a right-angle), the pedal triangle of the orthocenter of the original triangle is called the orthic triangle or altitude triangle. That is, the feet of the altitudes of an oblique triangle form the orthic triangle, . Also, the incenter (the center of the inscribed circle) of the orthic triangle is the orthocenter of the original triangle .

Trilinear coordinates for the vertices of the orthic triangle are given by
formula_15

The extended sides of the orthic triangle meet the opposite extended sides of its reference triangle at three collinear points.

In any acute triangle, the inscribed triangle with the smallest perimeter is the orthic triangle. This is the solution to Fagnano&#x27;s problem, posed in 1775. The sides of the orthic triangle are parallel to the tangents to the circumcircle at the original triangle&#x27;s vertices.

The orthic triangle of an acute triangle gives a triangular light route.

The tangent lines of the nine-point circle at the midpoints of the sides of are parallel to the sides of the orthic triangle, forming a triangle similar to the orthic triangle.

The orthic triangle is closely related to the tangential triangle, constructed as follows: let be the line tangent to the circumcircle of triangle at vertex , and define analogously. Let formula_16 formula_17 formula_18 The tangential triangle is , whose sides are the tangents to triangle &#x27;s circumcircle at its vertices; it is homothetic to the orthic triangle. The circumcenter of the tangential triangle, and the center of similitude of the orthic and tangential triangles, are on the Euler line.

Trilinear coordinates for the vertices of the tangential triangle are given by
formula_19
The reference triangle and its orthic triangle are orthologic triangles.

For more information on the orthic triangle, see here.

==History==
The theorem that the three altitudes of a triangle concur (at the orthocenter) is not directly stated in surviving Greek mathematical texts, but is used in the &quot;Book of Lemmas&quot; (proposition 5), attributed to Archimedes (3rd century BC), citing the &quot;commentary to the treatise about right-angled triangles&quot;, a work which does not survive. It was also mentioned by Pappus (&quot;Mathematical Collection&quot;, VII, 62; 340). The theorem was stated and proved explicitly by al-Nasawi in his (11th century) commentary on the &quot;Book of Lemmas&quot;, and attributed to al-Quhi ().

This proof in Arabic was translated as part of the (early 17th century) Latin editions of the &quot;Book of Lemmas&quot;, but was not widely known in Europe, and the theorem was therefore proven several more times in the 17th–19th century. Samuel Marolois proved it in his &quot;Geometrie&quot; (1619), and Isaac Newton proved it in an unfinished treatise &quot;Geometry of Curved Lines&quot; Later William Chapple proved it in 1749.

A particularly elegant proof is due to François-Joseph Servois (1804) and independently Carl Friedrich Gauss (1810): Draw a line parallel to each side of the triangle through the opposite point, and form a new triangle from the intersections of these three lines. Then the original triangle is the medial triangle of the new triangle, and the altitudes of the original triangle are the perpendicular bisectors of the new triangle, and therefore concur (at the circumcenter of the new triangle).

<text>Karl Wilhelm Feuerbach (30 May 1800 – 12 March 1834) was a German geometer and the son of legal scholar Paul Johann Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach, and the brother of philosopher Ludwig Feuerbach. After receiving his doctorate at age 22, he became a professor of mathematics at the Gymnasium at Erlangen. In 1822 he wrote a small book on mathematics noted mainly for a theorem on the nine-point circle, which is now known as Feuerbach&#x27;s theorem. In 1827 he introduced homogeneous coordinates, independently of Möbius.

<doc id="161247" wikidata="Q124047417" url="?curid=161247" title="Peranakan Chinese">
<text>The Peranakan Chinese () are an ethnic group defined by their genealogical descent from the first waves of Southern Chinese settlers to maritime Southeast Asia, known as Nanyang (), namely the British, Portuguese, and Dutch colonial ports in the Malay Peninsula and the Indonesian Archipelago, as well as Singapore. The Peranakan Chinese are often simply referred to as the Peranakans. Peranakan culture, especially in the dominant Peranakan centres of Malacca, Singapore, Penang, Phuket, and Tangerang, is characterized by its unique hybridization of ancient Chinese culture with the local cultures of the Nusantara region, the result of a centuries-long history of transculturation and interracial marriage.

Immigrants from the southern provinces of China arrived in significant numbers in the region between the 14th and 17th centuries, taking abode in the Malay Peninsula (where their descendants in Malacca, Singapore and Penang are referred to as Baba–Nyonya); the Indonesian Archipelago (where their descendants are referred to as Kiau–Seng); the Southern Thailand (where their descendants are referred to as Baba-Yaya), primarily in Phuket, Trang, Phang Nga, Takua Pa, and Ranong; Terengganu (where their descendants are referred to as Cheng Mua Lang) and North Borneo from the 18th century (where their descendants in Sabah are also referred to as [[Sino-Native]]s). Intermarriage between these Chinese settlers and their Malay, Thai, Javanese, or other predecessors in the region contributed to the emergence of a distinctive hybrid culture and ostensible phenotypic differences. Through colonisation of the region, the impact and presence of the Peranakan Chinese spread beyond Nusantara. In Sri Lanka, the Peranakan Chinese went on to contribute to the development of the Sri Lankan Malay identity that emerged in the nation during Dutch rule.

The Peranakans are considered a multiracial community, with the caveat that individual family histories vary widely and likewise self-identification with multiracialism as opposed to Chineseness varies widely. The Malay/Indonesian phrase &quot;orang Cina bukan Cina&quot; (&quot;a not-Chinese Chinese person&quot;) encapsulates the complex relationship between Peranakan identity and Chinese identity. The particularities of genealogy and the unique syncretic culture are the main features that distinguish the Peranakan from descendants of later waves of Chinese immigrants to the region.

==Terminology==
===Etymology===
The word &quot;Peranakan&quot; is a grammatical inflection of the Malay and Indonesian word &quot;anak&quot;, meaning &quot;child&quot; or &quot;offspring&quot;. With the addition of the prefix &quot;per-&quot; and the suffix &quot;-an&quot; to the root &quot;anak&quot;, the modified word &quot;peranakan&quot; has a variety of meanings. Among other things, it can mean &quot;womb&quot;, or it can be used as a designator of genealogical descent, connoting ancestry or lineage, including great-grandparents or more-distant ancestors. On its own, when used in common parlance, the word &quot;peranakan&quot; does not denote a specific ethnicity of descent unless followed by a subsequent qualifying noun. For example &quot;Peranakan Tionghoa/Cina&quot; may simply mean &quot;Chinese descendants&quot;; likewise &quot;Jawi Peranakan&quot; can mean &quot;Arab descendants&quot;, or &quot;Peranakan Belanda&quot; &quot;Dutch descendants&quot;.

However, in a semantic shift, the word &quot;peranakan&quot; has come to be used as a &quot;metaphorical&quot; adjective that has the meaning of &quot;locally born but non-indigenous&quot;. In Indonesian, it can denote &quot;hybrid&quot; or &quot;crossbred&quot;. Thus the term &quot;Peranakan Cina&quot; or &quot;Peranakan Tionghoa&quot; can have the literal or archaic meaning of &quot;Chinese womb&quot; or &quot;Chinese descendants&quot; or &quot;Chinese ancestry&quot; or &quot;descended from the Chinese&quot;—but more latterly has come to mean &quot;locally born but non-indigenous Chinese&quot; or even &quot;half-caste Chinese&quot;. The semantic shift is presumed to have arisen from the thorough hybridization or assimilation of the earliest Chinese or other non-indigenous settlers in the Malay Archipelago such that their ethnic heritage needed to be specified whenever referring to them, either to avoid confusion or to emphasise difference. The designator &quot;peranakan&quot;—in its original sense simply connoting &quot;descendant of X ethnicity&quot;, or &quot;the wombs of X&quot;—emerged as the name for entire ethnic groups that were &quot;locally born but non-indigenous&quot; or perceived to be &quot;hybrid&quot; and &quot;crossbred&quot;, and, in time, the latter meaning has come to predominate. It should also be noted that the broadness of the semantic range of &quot;peranakan&quot; means that it can have significantly different connotations in different parts of the Nusantara region and across different dialects or variants of the Malay and Indonesian languages.

The word &quot;Peranakan,&quot; which can have very broad and labile meanings in Malay and Indonesian and, when used in common parlance, is simply an indicator of heritage or descent, may also be used to refer to other ethnic groups in the same region. Owing to the broad meaning of the term &#x27;peranakan&#x27;, the term is also encountered when referring to other communities in the region with similar histories of immigration and assimilation. For example, the Chitty may accurately refer to themselves as &#x27;Indian Hindu Peranakans&#x27;, meaning &quot;of Indian Hindu descent&quot; or &quot;locally born but non-indigenous Indian Hindu&quot;. Likewise the Kristang may accurately refer to themselves as &#x27;Eurasian Peranakans&#x27;. The name of the Jawi Pekan people is derived from &#x27;Peranakan&#x27;, Jawi being the Javanised Arabic script, and &quot;Pekan&quot; being a colloquial contraction of &quot;Peranakan&quot;.

===Chinese Peranakan===

The prominence of Peranakan Chinese culture, however, has led to the common elision whereby &#x27;Peranakan&#x27; may simply be taken to refer to the Peranakan Chinese, i.e. the culturally unique descendants of the earliest Chinese settlers in the Malay Archipelago, as opposed to the other smaller groups that also justifiably call themselves &#x27;peranakan&#x27;. For some Peranakans of Chinese descent, calling oneself &quot;Peranakan&quot; without the qualifier &quot;Chinese&quot; can be a way of asserting an ethnic identity distinct from and independent of Chineseness (though such a use of &quot;Peranakan&quot; as a single-word ethnonym may clash with the desire of other groups of non-Chinese descent to equally call themselves &quot;Peranakan&quot;).

Later waves of immigrants to South East Asia are generally referred to using larger umbrella terms such as Malaysian Chinese, Chinese Singaporean, Chinese Indonesian or Tionghoa, or Thai Chinese.

===Straits Chinese===
One of the sub-groups of Chinese-Peranakan, Straits Chinese or Straits-born Chinese were defined as those born or living in the Straits Settlements: a British colony consisting of Malacca, Penang, and Singapore which was established in 1826. Straits Chinese were not considered Baba Nyonya unless they displayed certain Sino-Malay syncretic attributes, in terms of attire worn, food, spoken language, choice of education, preferred career choices, choice of religion and loyalties.

However, given that &#x27;Straits Chinese&#x27; is a geographical designator specific to the former British colonies in the region, whereas &#x27;Peranakan Chinese&#x27; is a broader genealogical designator covering all parts of the Nusantara region where Chinese people settled (including areas colonized by the Dutch, who would not have used the word &#x27;Straits&#x27;), the two terms cannot be said to fully overlap or be interchangeable. Someone who is said to be &#x27;Straits Chinese&#x27; in British colonial documents might, for example, be non-Peranakan, i.e. a person who arrived in the Nusantara region during much later periods of Chinese migration.

Conversely, the other Dutch, Malay and Siamese-speaking Peranakan Chinese in Dutch East Indies, Siam and Malaya would be unlikely to refer to themselves using the English term &#x27;Straits Chinese&#x27;.

===Baba-Nyonya===
The Peranakan Chinese commonly refer to themselves as Baba-Nyonya. The term &quot;Baba&quot; is an honorific for Straits Chinese men. It originated as a Hindi (originally Persian) loan-word borrowed by Malay speakers as a term of affection for one&#x27;s grandparents, and became part of the common vernacular. In Penang Hokkien, it is pronounced &quot;bā-bā&quot; (in Pe̍h-ōe-jī), and sometimes written with the phonetic loan characters 峇峇. Female Straits-Chinese descendants were either called or styled themselves &quot;Nyonyas&quot;. &quot;Nyonya&quot; (also spelled &quot;nyonyah&quot; or &quot;nonya&quot;) is a Malay and Indonesian honorific used to refer to a foreign married lady. It is a loan word, borrowed from the old Portuguese word for lady &quot;donha&quot; (compare, for instance, Macanese creole &quot;nhonha&quot; spoken on Macau, which was a Portuguese colony for 464 years). Because Malays at that time had a tendency to address all foreign women (and perhaps those who appeared foreign) as &quot;nyonya&quot;, they used that term for Straits-Chinese women as well. It gradually became more exclusively associated with them. In Penang Hokkien, it is pronounced &quot;nō͘-niâ&quot; (in Pe̍h-ōe-jī), and sometimes written with the phonetic loan characters 娘惹.

==Ancestry==
A 2021 genetic study Singapore&#x27;s Peranakan Chinese have Malay ancestry, with an average of 5–10%.

Many Peranakans identify as Holoh (Hokkien) despite being of numerous origins, such as the descendants of adopted local Malaysian aborigines. A sizeable number are of Teochew or Hakka descent, including a small minority of Cantonese.

Baba Nyonya are a subgroup within Chinese communities. Peranakan families occasionally arranged brides from China for their sons or arranged marriages for their daughters with newly arrived Chinese immigrants.

There are parallels between the Peranakan Chinese and the Cambodian Hokkien, who are descendants of Hoklo Chinese. Likewise the &quot;Pashu&quot; of Myanmar, a Burmese word for the Peranakan or Straits Chinese who have settled in Myanmar.

They maintained their culture partially despite their native language gradually disappearing a few generations after settlement. 

Popular myths by the Malays of the Peranakan Chinese in Malacca, Singapore, and Penang sometimes state exclusive descent from the royal retinue of an allegedly princess named Hang Li Po—alleged by the Malay Annals as having made a marriage of alliance with the Sultan of Malacca in the fifteenth centuryhowever modern historians disproved the princess marriage as a false myth by the Malay Annals.

==Language==

The language of the Peranakans, Baba Malay (&quot;Bahasa Melayu Baba&quot;) or Peranakan Malay, is a creole language related to the Malay language (&quot;Bahasa Melayu&quot;), which contains many Hokkien words. It is a dying language, and its contemporary use is mainly limited to members of the older generation. It is common for the Peranakan of the older generation (particularly among women) to &quot;latah&quot; in Peranakan Malay when experiencing unanticipated shock.

The Peranakan Malay spoken by the Malaccan Peranakans community is strongly based on the Malay language as most of them can only speak little to none of the language of their Chinese forebears. Whereas in the east coast of Peninsula Malaysia, the Peranakans are known to not only speak a Hokkien version of their own but also Thai and Kelantanese Malay in Kelantan and Terengganu Malay in Terengganu. Unlike the rest of the Peranakans in Malaysia, Penang Peranakans are much heavily influenced by a dialect of Hokkien known locally as Penang Hokkien.

In Indonesia, the Peranakan language is mainly based on Indonesian and Javanese, which is mixed with elements of different Chinese varieties, mostly Hokkien. Speakers of the Peranakan language can be found scattered along the northern coastline area throughout West Java, Central Java and East Java, and also in Special Region of Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Young Peranakans can still speak this creole language, although its use is limited to informal occasions.

==History==

The first Chinese immigrants to settle in the Malay Archipelago arrived from Guangdong and Fujian provinces in the 10th century C.E. They were joined by much larger numbers of the Chinese in the 15th through 17th centuries, following on the heels of the Ming emperor&#x27;s reopening of Chinese-Malay trade relations in the 15th century.

In the 15th century, some small city-states of the Malay Peninsula often paid tribute to various kingdoms such as those of China and Siam. Close relations with China were established in the early 15th century during the reign of Parameswara when Admiral Zheng He (&quot;Cheng Ho&quot;), a Muslim Chinese, visited Malacca and Java during his expedition (1405–1433). According to a legend in 1459 CE, the Emperor of China sent a princess, Hang Li Po, to the Sultan of Malacca as a token of appreciation for his tribute. The nobles (500 sons of ministers) and servants who accompanied the princess initially settled in Bukit Cina and eventually grew into a class of Straits-born Chinese known as the Peranakans.

Chinese men in Melaka fathered children with Javanese, Batak and Balinese slave women. Their descendants moved to Penang and Singapore during the period of British rule. Chinese men in colonial southeast Asia also obtained slave wives from Nias. Chinese men in Singapore and Penang were supplied with slave wives of Bugis, Batak, and Balinese origin. The British colonial government tolerated the importation of slave wives since they improved the standard of living for the slaves and provided contentment to the male population. The usage of slave women or house maids as wives by the Chinese was widespread.

It cannot be denied, however, that the existence of slavery in this quarter, in former years, was of immense advantage in procuring a female population for Pinang. From Assaban alone, there used to be sometimes 300 slaves, principally females, exported to Malacca and Pinang in a year. The women get comfortably settled as the wives of opulent Chinese merchants, and live in the greatest comfort. Their families attach these men to the soil; and many never think of returning to their native country. The female population of Pinang is still far from being upon a par with the male; and the abolition therefore of slavery, has been a vast sacrifice to philanthropy and humanity. As the condition of the slaves who were brought to the British settlements, was materially improved, and as they contributed so much to the happiness of the male population, and the general prosperity of the settlement, I am disposed to think (although I detest the principles of slavery as much as any man), that the continuance of the system here could not, under the benevolent regulations which were in force to prevent abuse, have been productive of much evil. The sort of slavery indeed which existed in the British settlements in this quarter, had nothing but the name against it; for the condition of the slaves who were brought from the adjoining countries, was always ameliorated by the change; they were well fed and clothed; the women became wives of respectable Chinese; and the men who were in the least industrious, easily emancipated themselves, and many became wealthy. Severity by masters was punished; and, in short, I do not know any race of people who were, and had every reason to be, so happy and contented as the slaves formerly, and debtors as they are now called, who came from the east coast of Sumatra and other places.
John Anderson – Agent to the Government of Prince of Wales Island

People of Chinese ancestry in Phuket, Thailand make up a significant population, many of whom having descended from tin miners who migrated to the island during the 19th century. The Peranakans there are known as &quot;Phuket Babas&quot; in the local tongue, constitute a fair share of members Chinese community, particularly among those who have family ties with the Peranakans of Penang and Malacca.

Chinese who married local Javanese women and converted to Islam created a distinct Chinese Muslim Peranakan community in Java. Chinese rarely had to convert to Islam to marry Javanese abangan women but a significant number of their offspring did, and Batavian Muslims absorbed the Chinese Muslim community which was descended from converts. Adoption of Islam back then was a marker of peranakan status which it no longer means. The Semaran Adipati and the Jayaningrat families were of Chinese origin.

Peranakans were held in high regard by Malays. Some Malays in the past may have taken the word &quot;Baba&quot;, referring to Chinese males, and put it into their name, when this used to be the case. This is not followed by the younger generation, and the current Chinese Malaysians do not have the same status or respect as Peranakans used to have.

In Penang, Thai women replaced Nias slave women and Batak slave women as wives of Chinese men after the 1830s when slavery was abolished.

Many Peranakan in Java, Indonesia are descendants of non-Muslim Chinese men who married abangan Javanese Muslim women. Most of the Chinese men did not convert to Islam since their Javanese wives did not ask them to, but a minority of Javanese women asked them to convert so a Chinese Muslim community made out of converts appeared among the Javanese. In the late half of the 19th century, Javanese Muslims became more adherent to Islamic rules due to going on hajj and more Arabs arriving in Java, ordering circumcision for converts. The Batavian Muslims in the 19th century completely absorbed the converted Chinese Muslims who originally had their own separate kapitan and community in the late 18th century. The remaining commoner non-Muslim Chinese Peranakans descended from Chinese men and Javanese Muslim women generally stopped marrying Javanese and the elite Peranakans stopped marrying Javanese completely and instead started only marrying fellow Chinese Peranakans in the 19th century, as they realized they might get absorbed by the Muslims. DNA tests done on Chinese Peranakan in Singapore showed that those Peranakan who are mixed with Malays are mostly of paternal Han Chinese descent and of maternal Malay descent. Peranakans in Malaysia and Singapore formed when non-Muslim Chinese men were able to marry Malay Muslim women a long time ago without converting to Islam. This is no longer the case in modern times where anyone who marries Malay women is required to convert to Islam.

Peranakan, Straits Chinese, Baba Nyonya are all names for the descendants of Han Chinese men and their Javanese, Sumatran and Malay wives. Han Chinese men did not allow their women to leave China, so they married local Muslim Javanese and other Southeast Asian women. Dayak women were married by Han Chinese men who settled in Borneo as noted in the 18th century. One Dayak man named Budi mentioned a Chinese man married Budi&#x27;s sister and that he liked Chinese but he hated Madurese as he was talking about the massacres of Madurese settlers. Malay and Dayak ethnically cleansed Madurese settlers from their and in West Kalimantan starting in Sambas from December 1996 to February 2001 after the Sampit fights in December 2000.

The Chinese are perhaps the most important people in Borneo. They have been traders and settlers on the coast from beyond historic times, and, as has just been stated, have for an equally long period mixed with the natives; so that some Dyaks—the Dusuns especially might almost be classed with them. They are not only traders who amass wealth merely to return with it to their own empire, but miners, agriculturists, and producers, without whom it would be difficult to develop the country. The Philippines, Singapore, and Borneo receive, perhaps, a larger number of these immigrants than any other countries. In Borneo they are scattered over the whole seaboard, carrying on a good deal of the river trade, and supplanting in many ways the less energetic Malay. But they are chiefly to be found in West Borneo, especially in the mining districts, as in Sambas and Montrado (Menteradu) in Dutch territory. Numbers are settled around Bau and Bidi, in Sarawak, and in the capital, Kuching. In North Borneo an irruption of some thousands occurred on the opening up of the country, and great numbers are employed on the tobacco plantations lately established. In Labuan, and in Pengaron in South Borneo, the coal mines were worked by Chinese, and they still act as sago-washers in the former island. Bound together by societies with stringent laws, their system of co-operation enables them to prosper where others would fail. In West Borneo they thus became so powerful as to defy the Dutch Government, who had great difficulty in subduing them. In 1912, Chinese engaged in mass violent riots against Dutch colonial rule in Surayaba and Batavia in the Dutch East Indies.

Among the Straits Chinese (Peranakan) descendants in Sulu, the Philippines is Abdusakur Tan II, the governor.

Many Straits Chinese (Peranakans) migrated from Singapore to Jolo, Sulu and Mindanao to live and trade among the Moro Muslims like the Tausug people and Maguindanaons and sell weapons, rifles, cannon and opium to them in exchange for gutta-percha. Tausug and Chinese married each other and Chinese also converted to Islam. Moros carried out suicide juramentado attacks against the Japanese. Moro juramentados used opium in their attacks against US soldiers. American military officers Charles Wilkes saw Sulu Moro Sultan Mohammed Damaliel Kisand (spelling error of Jamalul Kiram) and his sons smoke opium and he had bloodshot eyes because of it. Datu Uto received Spencer and Enfield rifles from Straits Chinese (Peranakan) merchants. Lantaka swivel bronze cannon were sold by Chinese to the Moros who were fighting the Americans. A novel was written about this.

Balinese women, Bugis women and other native women in Indonesia who married Han Chinese men were buried according to Chinese custom with Chinese characters on their gravestones instead of being cremated.

Straits Chinese, Baba Nyonya or Peranakan are descended from Malay women and Chinese men.

==Culture==
===Clothing===
The Peranakan retained most of their ethnic and religious origins (such as ancestor worship), but assimilated the language and culture of the Malays.
The Nyonya&#x27;s clothing, Baju Panjang (Long Dress) was adapted from the native Malay&#x27;s Baju Kurung. It is worn with a batik sarong (batik wrap-around skirt) and three kerosang (brooches). Peranakan beaded slippers called &quot;Kasot Manek&quot; were hand-made with much skill and patience: strung, beaded and sewn onto canvas with tiny faceted glass cut beads (known as &quot;Manek Potong&quot;) similar to ones from Bohemia (present-day Czech Republic).

Traditional &quot;kasot manek&quot; design often have European floral subjects, with colours influenced by Peranakan porcelain and batik sarongs. They were made into flats or bedroom slippers. But from the 1930s, modern shapes became popular and heels were gradually added.

In Indonesia, the Peranakans develop their own kebaya, most notably &quot;kebaya encim&quot;, derived from the name &quot;encim&quot; or &quot;enci&quot; to refer to a married Chinese woman. &quot;Kebaya encim&quot; was commonly worn by Chinese ladies in Javan coastal cities with significant Chinese settlements, such as Semarang, Lasem, Tuban, Surabaya, Pekalongan and Cirebon. It marked differently from Javanese kebaya with its smaller and finer embroidery, lighter fabrics and more vibrant colours. They also developed their own batik patterns, which incorporate symbols from China. The &quot;kebaya encim&quot; fit well with vibrant-coloured kain batik pesisiran (Javan coastal batik), which incorporated symbols and motives from China; such as dragon, phoenix, peony and lotus. For the Baba they will wear baju lokchuan (which is the Chinese men&#x27;s full costume) but the younger generation they will wear just the top of it which is the long-sleeved silk jacket with Chinese collar or the batik shirt.

===Religion===
Most Peranakans generally subscribed to Chinese beliefs systems such as Taoism, Confucianism and Han Buddhism, and even Roman Christianity nowadays. Just like the Chinese, the Peranakans also celebrate Chinese New Year, Lantern Festival and other Chinese festivals, while adopting the customs of the land they settled in, as well as those of their colonial rulers. There are traces of Portuguese, Dutch, British, Malay and Indonesian influences in Peranakan culture.

Just like in any other cultures, the Peranakans still believe in &quot;pantang larang&quot; (meaning taboos) especially among the older generations. In some cases, quite a number the Peranakan&#x27;s &quot;pantang larang&quot; are deemed too strict and complex. But today, most Peranakans no longer practice complex &quot;pantang larang&quot; to keep up with the modern times.

====Christianity====

A significant number of the modern Peranakan community have embraced Christianity, most notably in Indonesia.

In 2019, a new branch of Singapore-specific Peranakan intermarriages were found to exist within the early Roman Catholic Church starting from 1834. This early church was set up by French missionaries (Mission Enstrangeres de Paris Order) in 1832 on Bras Basah Road, on the grounds of the present day Singapore Art Museum. Approximately 26 intermarriages between mainly China-born Teochew men and Melaka Serani, Malay, Peranakan Chinese and Indian women, took place under the auspices of this church, between 1834 and the early 1870s. Most, if not all descendants, identify as Teochew Peranakans today.

In Singapore, the Kampong Kapor Methodist Church, founded in 1894 by an Australian missionary, Sophia Blackmore, is considered one of the first Peranakan churches. During its establishment, Sunday service were conducted in Baba Malay language, and it is still one of the languages being used in their services.

Despite living in Muslim majority countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia, converting to Christianity allows Peranakans to continue eating pork which is a key part of the Peranakan diet. Moreover, Peranakans were traditionally English educated at missionary schools, notably in Penang.

====Islam====
In Indonesia, Peranakan referred to all Indonesian Chinese who had converted to Islam up until the 19th century. This indicated the importance of Islamic identity as a &quot;criterion of indigenization.&quot; Later, Peranakan referred to all Indonesian Chinese born in the country, including those of descendants of mixed race unions. Large numbers of Peranakans, many from Fujian having prior experience with foreign Muslims who had a dominant position in that provinces most important seaport, adopted Islam in Java, strongly Muslim areas of Indonesia, and Malaysia. As in the case of the Peranakans in Cirebon, this conversion process occurred over several centuries and was even recorded before the Dutch seized Jakarta. Many of these Peranakans in Indonesia who converted to Islam would marry into aristocratic dynasties. One organisation of Indonesian Peranakan Muslims is the &quot;Persatuan Islam Tionghoa Indonesia&quot; (Association of Indonesian Chinese Muslims), which was formed in 1936 in Medan. Some prominent Peranakan Muslims include the Indonesians Junus Jahja, Abdul Karim Oei Tjeng Hien and Tjio Wie Tay and from Pattani, the Peranakan convert to Islam, Datu Seri Nara, who according to Wybrand of Warwijck was the most important commercial and military figure in Pattani in 1602.

===Food===

Due to the culture of Nyonya and Babas is merged between Malay and Chinese and influence by Indonesia. Malacca was once the world&#x27;s merchant gathering point enabling the birth of Baba and Nyonya ethnic group. Therefore, the Nyonya food can be summarized as &quot;Malay Archipelago Delicacies of Nanyang Cuisine&quot;.

From the Malay influence, a unique &quot;Nyonya&quot; cuisine has developed using typical Malay spices. Examples are &quot;chicken kapitan&quot;, a dry chicken curry and &quot;inchi kabin&quot;, a Nyonya version of fried chicken. &quot;Pindang bandeng&quot; is a common fish soup served in Indonesia during the Chinese New Year and so is a white round mooncake from Tangerang which is normally used during the Autumn Festival. &quot;Swikee purwodadi&quot; is a Peranakan dish from Purwodadi, a frog soup dish.

&quot;Nyonya laksa&quot; is a very popular dish in Malacca, Malaysia while another variant called &quot;asam laksa&quot; is famous in Penang, Malaysia. &quot;Pongteh&quot; is also another popular and savoury dish of the Malaccan Peranakan community. The main ingredient is onion, black mushroom (optional), chicken (at times pork is used instead of chicken, hence it&#x27;s called &quot;babi pongteh&quot;) and fermented bean sauce. The Malaccan Nyonyas are well known for this dish.

Other dishes from the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia Peranakans in Kelantan include &quot;telur kesum&quot;, &quot;ayam kerabu&quot; and &quot;khau jam&quot; are influenced by Chinese, Malay and Thai cuisine. While in Terengganu, popular Peranakan foods are such as the local version of crab cake, &quot;ayam pachok&quot; which resembles satay with a stronger flavour, fish in spicy tamarind sauce and slow-cooked chicken with palm sugar.

Besides that, Peranakans of Malacca are also well known for a wide variety of traditional cakes (&quot;kueh&quot; or &quot;kue&quot;) such as &quot;lepak kacang&quot;, &quot;ang ku kue&quot; (a black variant is called &quot;kueh ku hitam&quot;), &quot;kueh tae&quot; or &quot;nastar&quot;, &quot;Nyonya bak chang&quot;, &quot;apom balik&quot; (Peranakan&#x27;s version closely resembles Indonesian&#x27;s &quot;serabi&quot;), &quot;kueh bakol&quot;, &quot;tapae&quot;, &quot;kueh kochi&quot;, &quot;kueh bongkong&quot;, &quot;rempah udang&quot;, &quot;pulot enti&quot;, &quot;kueh gulong&quot; (another variant is &quot;kueh kapit&quot;), &quot;kueh bolu&quot;, &quot;galeng galoh&quot; (also known as &quot;seri muka&quot;), &quot;kueh bangket&quot; and many more. Traditional kueh (or kue) are sometimes made in conjunction with festivals that the Peranakans celebrate. For example, &quot;kueh genggang&quot; (also commonly known as &quot;kueh lapis&quot;), is a type of multi layered cake, most often eaten during Chinese New Year to symbolise a ladder of continued prosperity.

A small number of restaurants serving Nyonya food can be found in Penang and Malacca in Malaysia; and Jakarta, Semarang and Surabaya in Indonesia.

===Marriage===
It was not uncommon for early Chinese traders to take Malay women from Peninsular Malaya or Sumatra as wives or concubines. Consequently, the Baba Nyonya display a mix of Sino-Malay cultural traits.

Written records from the 19th and early 20th centuries show that &quot;Peranakan&quot; men usually took brides from within the local &quot;Peranakan&quot; community. Peranakan families occasionally imported brides from China and sent their daughters to China to find husbands.

Marriages within the community and of similar stature were the norm during that time. Wealthy men prefigured to marry a &quot;chin choay&quot;: or matrilocal marriage where husband moved in with the wife&#x27;s family.

Proposals of marriage were made by a gift of a &quot;pinangan&quot;, in a 2-tiered lacquered basket known as &quot;Bakul Siah&quot; in Malaysia or &quot;Tenong Keranjang&quot; in Indonesia, to the intended bride&#x27;s parents brought by a go-between who speaks on behalf of the suitor. There are rare cases where wealthy Peranakans in the past used highly decorative glided pagoda trays (&quot;Botekan Candi&quot; in Indonesian) instead of the &quot;Bakul Siah&quot; or &quot;Tenong Keranjang&quot;. Most Peranakans have retained the traditions of ancestor worship of the Chinese, though some have converted to Christianity and Islam.

The wedding ceremony of the Peranakan is largely based on Chinese tradition, and is one of the most colourful wedding ceremonies in Malaysia. At Malacca weddings, the &quot;Dondang Sayang&quot;, a form of extempore rhyming song in Malay sung and danced by guests at the wedding party, was a highlight. Someone would begin a romantic theme which was carried on by others, each taking the floor in turn, dancing in slow gyrations as they sang. It required quick wit and repartee and often gave rise to laughter and applause when a particularly clever phrase was sung. The melodic accents of the Baba-Nonya and their particular turns of phrase lead to the charm of this performance.

The important wedding rites had to be commenced on auspicious days at specific times, according to the &quot;pek ji&quot;, the eight Chinese characters annotating one&#x27;s birth date and time. At these rites, &quot;pantangs&quot; (taboos) were carefully observed – the wedding rituals had to be legitimised and witnessed by elders, deities and ancestors. Marriages were typically match-made. Parents and elders made the final decision, but the potential bride and bridegroom were also consulted in the process. Wedding items commonly utilised the prosperous colours of red, pink, orange, yellow and gold and were embellished with special motifs to ensure a good marriage. Similar to the Chinese, Peranakans believed that good things always come in pairs, therefore many wedding items came in pairs.

===Museums===
Historical and cultural items from the Peranakan culture are displayed in Baba Nyonya Heritage Museum, Straits Chinese Jewellery Museum and other cultural establishments on Heeren Street, Jonker Street and other streets in the same neighbourhood in Malacca; the Pinang Peranakan Mansion in Penang, Malaysia; and at the Peranakan Museum, Baba House and the Intan Museum in Singapore. Furniture, food, and even traditional clothes of the Baba and Nyonya are exhibited. Free weekly street shows featuring Baba performances, and traditional and pop Chinese cultural performances are found in Jonker Street in Malacca. The shows are part of the night market scene, and are usually crowded with shoppers, both local and foreign.

On 11 November 2011, Benteng Heritage Museum in Tangerang, near Jakarta is opened to display mainly about Benteng Chinese uses an old genuine traditional Chinese Peranakan house. And in August 2013, the &quot;Museum Peranakan Indonesia&quot; was officially opened by the &quot;Yayasan Budaya Tionghoa Indonesia&quot;. The museum is located at the Cheng Ho Museum, next to the Hakka Museum, at the pavilion of Taman Budaya Tionghoa Indonesia, Taman Mini Indonesia Indah in Jakarta.

Other Peranakan cultural collections such as batik and bead works can also be found in museums outside of South East Asia. Honolulu Museum of Art and Australian Museum are known to exhibit such collections. 

Apart from that, exhibition of Peranakan Chitty history, antiques and culture can be seen at the Chitty Museum in Kampung Chitty, Malacca, Malaysia. In 2013, there were controversies of development at the expense of demolishing part of Kampung Chitty, a historical and cultural village. A proposal to construct a condominium, a hotel and a road cutting through the village are seen as a threat affecting the residents and a temple built in 1827.

In Kelantan, the or the Kelantan Chinese Peranakan Association (abbreviated as PPCK) have opened a gallery which provides visitors with various insights into the Kelantanese Chinese Peranakan culture.

===Political affinity===
Many Peranakan were active in trade and considered supportive of continued European rule in Malaysia and Indonesia. Peranakans often played the role of middleman of the British and the Chinese, or the Chinese and Malays, because they were mostly English educated and spoke Malay more fluently than newer Chinese immigrants. 

By the middle of the twentieth century, most Peranakan were English or Dutch-educated at Western-style institutions. Peranakans readily embraced Western culture and education as a means to advance economically thus administrative and civil service posts were often filled by prominent Straits Chinese. Many in the community chose to convert to Christianity due to its perceived prestige and proximity to the preferred company of British and Dutch officials.

The Peranakan community thereby became very influential in Malacca and Singapore and were known also as the King&#x27;s Chinese due to their loyalty to the British Crown. Because of their interaction with different cultures and languages, most Peranakans were (and still are) trilingual, being able to converse in Chinese, Malay, and English. Common vocations were as merchants, traders, and general intermediaries between China, Malaya and the West; the latter were especially valued by the British and Dutch. 

Things started to change in the first half of the 20th century, with some Peranakans starting to support Malaysian and Indonesian independence.
In Indonesia three Chinese communities started to merge and become active in the political scene. 

They were also among the pioneers of Indonesian newspapers. In their fledgling publishing companies, they published their own political ideas along with contributions from other Indonesian writers. In November 1928, the Chinese weekly Sin Po () was the first paper to openly publish the text of the national anthem &quot;Indonesia Raya&quot;. On occasion, those involved in such activities ran a concrete risk of imprisonment or even of their lives, as the Dutch colonial authorities banned nationalistic publications and activities. 

Chinese were active in supporting the independence movement during the 1940s Japanese occupation, when the all but the so-called &quot;Overseas Chinese Association&quot;, or residents of Chinese ancestry () were banned by the Japanese military authorities. Some notable pro-independence activists were Siauw Giok Tjhan, Liem Koen Hian, and Yap Tjwan Bing, a member of &quot;Panitia Persiapan Kemerdekaan Indonesia&quot;, who in the 1960s became a citizen of the United States.

=== Chinese cultural Influence on Southeast Asian Muslims ===
Muslim Southeast Asians adopted Chinese symbols like the colour yellow for royals, including Malays, Javanese and Moros.

One Dutch mentioned &quot;yellow Chinese belts which only the Javanese will buy.&quot;

Malays and Dayaks in Borneo did not use milk or dairy probably due to Chinese influence.

Malays adopted the Chinese zodiac. The Dragon (&quot;Loong&quot;) is normally equated with the nāga but it is sometimes called Big Snake (&quot;ular besar&quot;) while the Snake sign is called Second Snake (&quot;ular sani&quot;). This is also recorded in a 19th-century manuscript compiled by John Leyden.

==Current status==

Peranakan culture has started to disappear in Malaysia and Singapore. Without support from the colonial government for their perceived ethnic independence, government policies in both countries following independence from colonial rule have resulted in the assimilation of Peranakans back into mainstream Chinese culture. Singapore classifies the Peranakans as ethnically Chinese, so they receive formal instruction in Mandarin Chinese as a second language (in accordance with the &quot;Mother Tongue Policy&quot;) instead of Malay. In Malaysia, the standardisation of Malay as Bahasa Melayu—required for all ethnic groups—has led to a disappearance of the unique characteristics of Baba Malay.

In Indonesia, the Peranakan culture appears to be losing popularity to modern Western culture, but to some degree the Peranakans are still trying to retain their language, cuisines and customs. Young Peranakans still speak their creole language, although many young women do not wear the &quot;kebaya&quot;. Marriages normally follow the western culture because the traditional Peranakan customs are losing popularity. Only three communities of Peranakan still uphold the traditional Peranakan wedding customs, Tangerang (by the Cina Benteng people), Makassar and Padang. Of the three communities the Cina Benteng people are the most adherent to the Peranakan culture, but their numbers are dwindling.

Cina Benteng people are normally poor people and many seek, or have sought, opportunities in other areas. Some organisations do try to ease their burden of living. As of May 2012, 108 Cina Benteng families are facing eviction from their traditional homes, the reason given by the Tangerang government being that the area they occupy is actually meant as a green space for the city. Most of these families are low income and have nowhere to move to, as the government is not providing enough money for them to relocate. Several traumatic eviction attempts at 2010 and 2011 ended in violence.

The migration of some Peranakan families, particularly the well-to-do, has led to a small Peranakan diaspora to neighbouring countries, mainly from Vietnam to Australia. The 1998 anti-Chinese riots in Indonesia during the fall of Suharto terrorised many Chinese Indonesians and Peranakans alike, causing Chinese Indonesian communities affected by the riots to leave the country. However, these communities are very small, and with the increasing use of the various languages in their respective countries, the use of Peranakan Malay or Baba Malay has been diluted, especially among the younger generation.

==Current associations==

Associations of Chinese Peranakans include The Peranakan Association Singapore (TPAS), Aspertina (&quot;Asosiasi Peranakan Tionghoa Indonesia&quot;) and the Gunong Sayang Association (GSA), a performing arts group in Singapore. The Peranakan Association Singapore has over 2,000 members, and the Gunong Sayang Association has about 200 members. The Peranakan Association Singapore consists of a mix of young and old members, while the Gunung Sayang Association has primarily elderly or retired members. In Malacca, there is an Indian Peranakan Association known as the Chitty Melaka. This is a tightly knit community of Saivite Hindus. Chitty Peranakans display considerable similarity to Chinese Peranakans in terms of dressing, songs, folk dances and pantun.

In Malaysia, there are Peranakan associations in Malacca, KL, Penang, Kelantan, and Terengganu. The Peranakan association that is based in Kelantan is named the (lit. the &quot;Kelantan Chinese Peranakan Association&quot;, abbreviated as PPCK) while the one that is located in Terengganu is the (lit. the &quot;Terengganu Chinese Peranakan Association&quot;).

The Thai Peranakans live largely in Phuket and have an Association as well.

There are also Peranakan associations in Australia: Melbourne, Perth and New South Wales.

==In popular culture==

Interest in the Peranakan culture had begun as early as the 1950s with films from Hong Kong such as the &quot;Niangre / Nyonyah&quot; (Yue Feng, 1952), &quot;Fengyu Niuche Shui / Rainstorm in Chinatown&quot; (Yan Jun 1956), &quot;Niangre Yu Baba / Nonya And Baba&quot; (Yan Jun 1956), and &quot;Niangre Zhi Lian / Love With A Malaysian Girl&quot; (Lui Kei, 1969).

In Malaysia, a comedy drama series, &quot;Baba Nyonya&quot; was popular in the 1990s. The series is recognised by the Malaysian Book Of Records as the longest-running TV series in the country ever, lasting from the late 1980s until 2000, with 509 episodes in total.

Along the passing of the Reform Era in Indonesia and the removal of the ban on Chinese culture, in 1999, Indonesian writer Remy Sylado released a novel called &quot;Ca-Bau-Kan: Hanya Sebuah Dosa&quot; raised the Peranakan culture and history in Indonesia. The novel was adapted into a film called &quot;Ca-Bau-Kan&quot; by Nia Dinata in 2002. Riri Riza directed a biographical film on an Indonesian student activist named Soe Hok Gie (played by Nicholas Saputra), entitled &quot;Gie&quot; in 2005. The film is based on a diary &quot;Catatan Seorang Demonstran&quot; written by Soe Hok Gie, features a glimpse into the everyday life of an Indonesian Peranakan family in the 1960s. A novel that elevates the history and culture of the Benteng Chinese (&quot;Cina Benteng&quot; is another term in Indonesian referring to Peranakan) titled &quot;Bonsai: Hikayat Satu Keluarga Cina Benteng&quot; written by Pralampita Lembahmata and published by Gramedia in 2011.

In 2008, a Singaporean drama series &quot;The Little Nyonya&quot; was aired in Singapore, and later gained popularity in Asia especially within South East Asia region. The filming of the drama took place in Malacca, Penang and Ipoh, Malaysia.

In Yasmin Ahmad films &quot;Sepet&quot; and &quot;Gubra&quot; has featured Peranakan character as the lead actor&#x27;s mother played by Peranakan actress Tan Mei Ling. Lead actors from the 1990s &quot;Baba Nyonya&quot; series were also featured in Namewee&#x27;s multi-language and multi-cultural film, &quot;Nasi Lemak 2.0&quot; in 2011, showcasing Peranakan culture.

<text>Michele Margaret Timms (born 28 June 1965) is an Australian basketball coach and former player. She played five seasons for the Phoenix Mercury of the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA). She was inducted into the Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame in 2008 and into the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2016.

In the Women&#x27;s National Basketball League (WNBL), Timms made 285 appearances and won five championships.

==Professional career==
===WNBL===
Timms debuted in the WNBL in 1984 with the Bulleen Boomers. She joined the Nunawading Spectres in 1985 and played six seasons for the club. Between 1991 and 1994, she played for the Perth Breakers. In 1995 and 1996, she played for the Sydney Flames. For the 1998–99 WNBL season, she returned to the Bulleen Boomers. She won four WNBL championships with Nunawading and one with Perth. In the 1992 season, Timms was captain of the Breakers team that won the championship.

===WNBA===
At the onset of the WNBA in 1997, Timms was assigned to the Phoenix Mercury in the initial player allocation. Her debut game was played on June 22, 1997 in a 76 - 59 win over the Charlotte Sting where she recorded 8 points, 6 rebounds, 6 assists and 2 steals. Timms had a very dominant rookie season with averages of 12.1 points, 3.7 rebounds, 5.0 assists and 2.6 steals per game. The Mercury finished with a 16 - 12 record and made the playoffs but were eliminated in the semi-finals by the New York Liberty.

For the 1998 season, Timms had a drop in all of her season averages except for assists. Recording a lower average in minutes played, points, rebounds and steals than her previous season. The Mercury was still able to complete the season with a 19 - 11 record and reach the finals but lost to the Houston Comets. Timms came within inches of giving the Mercury their first title; with the Mercury up 1-0 and needing only one more win for the championship, and Game Two tied at 66 with three seconds to go, Timms took a three-point shot that bounced off the rim&#x27;s back. Ultimately, the Comets won that game 74–69 in overtime, and then the championship in Game Three.

The Mercury reached the playoffs with a 20 - 12 record in the 1998 season, but Timms only played 8 games that season and sat out of the playoffs as the Mercury lost in the semi-finals to the Los Angeles Sparks.

Timms bounced back and played more games in the 2001 season, playing in 21 games and averaging more points and assists than the previous season. But 2001 saw the Mercury have their worst record so far of 13 - 19. Timms&#x27; final WNBA game was played on August 14, 2001 in a 56 - 38 win over the Houston Comets where she recorded 10 points, 4 assists and 2 rebounds. That very same day (as it was the final game of the season and the Mercury were officially not making the playoffs), Timms announced her retirement and almost immediately joined the Mercury&#x27;s television broadcasting crew, a job which she held only for that season.

On August 7, 2002, her number 7 jersey became the first to be retired by the Phoenix Mercury, and only the second jersey ever retired by the WNBA (the first being Kim Perrot). Upon her retirement, she was the Mercury&#x27;s career leader in assists.

===Europe===
Timms played five seasons in Europe. Her first came in 1989–90 with German team Lotus Munich. She returned to Lotus Munich in 1992–93, played for Firenze Basket in Italy in 1993–94, and then played two seasons for BTV Wuppertal between 1995 and 1997. She won the FIBA Women&#x27;s European Champions Cup with Wuppertal in 1996.

===National team===
Timms made 264 appearances for the Australian national team. She participated in four World Championships (1986, 1990, 1994, 1998) and three Olympic Games (1988, 1996, 2000). She won Olympic bronze and silver medals (1996, 2000) and a World Championship bronze medal (1998). She was captain of the Olympic team in 2000.

==Coaching career==
Timms made her coaching debut in 2005 as an assistant coach with the Phoenix Mercury. In 2006, she joined the South Dragons of the National Basketball League (NBL) as a basketball development officer. She became an assistant coach for the Dragons in the 2007–08 NBL season. She quit as an assistant and development coach in January 2008 to go abroad for interviews for assistant coaching positions with two women&#x27;s teams. She went to serve as an assistant coach of the China women&#x27;s national basketball team (2008, 2013–2016); assistant coach of the Bulleen Boomers (2009–2011); and assistant coach of the Australia women&#x27;s national basketball team (2009–2012).

==Honours==
Timms was named the &quot;Women&#x27;s International Player of The Year&quot; in 1994 and 1996. She received an Australian Sports Medal in 2000 and was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 2003. In 2008, Timms was inducted into the Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame.

On 17 August 2016, Timms was inducted into the FIBA Hall of Fame.

Timms was made a Member of the Order of Australia in the 2018 Australia Day Honours.

On 6 April 2024, Timms was named to the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame.

<doc id="161253" wikidata="Q1193821" url="?curid=161253" title="Quantum fluctuation">
<text>In quantum physics, a quantum fluctuation (also known as a vacuum state fluctuation or vacuum fluctuation) is the temporary random change in the amount of energy in a point in space, as prescribed by Werner Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle. They are minute random fluctuations in the values of the fields which represent elementary particles, such as electric and magnetic fields which represent the electromagnetic force carried by photons, W and Z fields which carry the weak force, and gluon fields which carry the strong force.

The uncertainty principle states the uncertainty in energy and time can be related by formula_1, where  ≈ . This means that pairs of virtual particles with energy formula_2 and lifetime shorter than formula_3 are continually created and annihilated in &quot;empty&quot; space. Although the particles are not directly detectable, the cumulative effects of these particles are measurable. For example, without quantum fluctuations, the &quot;bare&quot; mass and charge of elementary particles would be infinite; from renormalization theory the shielding effect of the cloud of virtual particles is responsible for the finite mass and charge of elementary particles. 

Another consequence is the Casimir effect. One of the first observations which was evidence for vacuum fluctuations was the Lamb shift in hydrogen. In July 2020, scientists reported that quantum vacuum fluctuations can influence the motion of macroscopic, human-scale objects by measuring correlations below the standard quantum limit between the position/momentum uncertainty of the mirrors of LIGO and the photon number/phase uncertainty of light that they reflect.

== Field fluctuations ==
In quantum field theory, fields undergo quantum fluctuations. A reasonably clear distinction can be made between quantum fluctuations and thermal fluctuations of a quantum field (at least for a free field; for interacting fields, renormalization substantially complicates matters). An illustration of this distinction can be seen by considering quantum and classical Klein–Gordon fields: For the quantized Klein–Gordon field in the vacuum state, we can calculate the probability density that we would observe a configuration formula_4 at a time in terms of its Fourier transform formula_5 to be
: formula_6

In contrast, for the classical Klein–Gordon field at non-zero temperature, the Gibbs probability density that we would observe a configuration formula_4 at a time formula_8 is
: formula_9

These probability distributions illustrate that every possible configuration of the field is possible, with the amplitude of quantum fluctuations controlled by the Planck constant formula_10, just as the amplitude of thermal fluctuations is controlled by formula_11, where is the Boltzmann constant. Note that the following three points are closely related:
# the Planck constant has units of action (joule-seconds) instead of units of energy (joules),
# the quantum kernel is formula_12 instead of formula_13 (the quantum kernel is nonlocal from a classical heat kernel viewpoint, but it is local in the sense that it does not allow signals to be transmitted),
# the quantum vacuum state is Lorentz-invariant (although not manifestly in the above), whereas the classical thermal state is not (the classical dynamics is Lorentz-invariant, but the Gibbs probability density is not a Lorentz-invariant initial condition).

A classical continuous random field can be constructed that has the same probability density as the quantum vacuum state, so that the principal difference from quantum field theory is the measurement theory (measurement in quantum theory is different from measurement for a classical continuous random field, in that classical measurements are always mutually compatible – in quantum-mechanical terms they always commute).

<text>Finance capitalism or financial capitalism is the subordination of processes of production to the accumulation of money profits in a financial system.

Financial capitalism is thus a form of capitalism where the intermediation of saving to investment becomes a dominant function in the economy, with wider implications for the political process and social evolution. The process of developing this kind of economy is called financialization.

==Characteristics==

Finance capitalism is characterized by a predominance of the pursuit of profit from the purchase and sale of, or investment in, currencies and financial products such as bonds, stocks, futures and other derivatives. It also includes the lending of money at interest; and is seen by Marxist analysts (from whom the term finance capitalism originally derived) as being exploitative by supplying income to non-laborers. Academic defenders of the economic concept of capitalism, such as Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, see such profits as part of the roundabout process by which it grows and hedges against inevitable risks.

In financial capitalism, financial intermediaries become large concerns, ranging from banks to investment firms. Where deposit banks attract savings and lend out money, while investment banks obtain funds on the interbank market to re-lend for investment purposes, investment firms, by comparison, act on behalf of other concerns, by selling their equities or securities to investors, for investment purposes.

===Social implications===
The meaning of the term financial capitalism goes beyond the importance of financial intermediation in the modern capitalist economy. It also encompasses the significant influence of the wealth holders on the political process and the aims of economic policy.

Thomas Palley has argued that the 21st century predominance of finance capital has led to a preference for speculation—Casino Capitalism—over investment for entrepreneurial growth in the global economy.

==Historical developments==
Rudolf Hilferding is credited with first bringing the term finance capitalism into prominence, with his (1910) study of the links between German trusts, banks, and monopolies before World War I. Hilferding&#x27;s &quot;Finance Capital&quot; (&quot;Das Finanzkapital&quot;, Vienna: 1910) was &quot;the seminal Marxist analysis of the transformation of competitive and pluralistic &#x27;liberal capitalism&#x27; into monopolistic &#x27;finance capital&#x27;&quot;, and anticipated Lenin&#x27;s and Bukharin&#x27;s &quot;largely derivative&quot; writings on the subject. Writing in the context of the highly cartelized economy of late Austria-Hungary, Hilferding contrasted monopolistic &quot;finance capitalism&quot; to the earlier, &quot;competitive&quot; and &quot;buccaneering&quot; capitalism of the earlier liberal era. The unification of industrial, mercantile and banking interests had defused the earlier liberal capitalist demands for the reduction of the economic role of a mercantilist state; instead, finance capital sought a &quot;centralized and privilege-dispensing state&quot;. Hilferding saw this as part of the inevitable concentration of capital called for by Marxian economics, rather than a deviation from the free market.

Whereas, until the 1860s, the demands of capital and of the bourgeoisie had been, in Hilferding&#x27;s view, constitutional demands that had &quot;affected all citizens alike&quot;, finance capital increasingly sought state intervention on behalf of the wealth-owning classes; capitalists, rather than the nobility, now dominated the state.

In this, Hilferding saw an opportunity for a path to socialism that was distinct from the one foreseen by Marx: &quot;The socializing function of finance capital facilitates enormously the task of overcoming capitalism. Once finance capital has brought the most importance (&quot;sic&quot;) branches of production under its control, it is enough for society, through its conscious executive organ – the state conquered by the working class – to seize finance capital in order to gain immediate control of these branches of production.&quot; This would make it unnecessary to expropriate &quot;peasant farms and small businesses&quot; because they would be indirectly socialized, through the socialization of institutions upon which finance capital had already made them dependent. Thus, because a narrow class dominated the economy, socialist revolution could gain wider support by directly expropriating only from that narrow class. In particular, according to Hilferding, societies that had not reached the level of economic maturity anticipated by Marx as making them &quot;ripe&quot; for socialism could be opened to socialist possibilities. Furthermore, &quot;the policy of finance capital is bound to lead towards war, and hence to the unleashing of revolutionary storms.&quot;

Hilferding&#x27;s study was subsumed by Lenin into his wartime analysis of the imperialist relations of the great world powers. Lenin concluded of the banks at that time that they were “the chief nerve centres of the whole capitalist system of national economy”: for the Comintern, the phrase &quot;dictatorship of finance capitalism&quot; became a regular one.

In such a traditional Marxist perspective, finance capitalism is seen as a dialectical outgrowth of industrial capitalism, and part of the process by which the whole capitalist phase of history comes to an end. In a fashion similar to the views of Thorstein Veblen, finance capitalism is contrasted with industrial capitalism, where profit is made from the manufacture of goods.

Fernand Braudel would later point to two earlier periods when finance capitalism had emerged in human history—with the Genoese in the 16th century and the Dutch in the 17th and 18th centuries—although at those points it was from commercial capitalism that it developed. Giovanni Arrighi extended Braudel&#x27;s analysis to suggest that a predominance of finance capitalism is a recurring, long-term phenomenon, whenever a previous phase of commercial/industrial capitalist expansion reaches a plateau.

Whereas by mid-century the industrial corporation had displaced the banking system as the prime economic symbol of success, the late twentieth-century growth of derivatives and of a novel banking model ushered in a new (and historically fourth) period of finance capitalism.

Fredric Jameson has seen the globalised abstractions of this current phase of financial capitalism as underpinning the cultural manifestations of postmodernism.

<text>Cynthia Ellen Nixon (born April 9, 1966) is an American actress, activist, and theater director. For her portrayal of Miranda Hobbes in the HBO series &quot;Sex and the City&quot; (1998–2004), she won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series and reprised the role in the films &quot;Sex and the City&quot; (2008) and &quot;Sex and the City 2&quot; (2010), as well as the television show &quot;And Just Like That...&quot; (2021–present).

Nixon made her Broadway debut in the 1980 revival of &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot;. She went on to receive two Tony Awards, the first for Best Actress in a Play for &quot;Rabbit Hole&quot; (2006) and the second for Best Featured Actress in a Play for &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; (2017). Her other Broadway credits include &quot;The Real Thing&quot; (1983), &quot;Hurlyburly&quot; (1983), &quot;Indiscretions&quot; (1995), &quot;The Women&quot; (2001), and &quot;Wit&quot; (2012).

She won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series for &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; in 2008 and a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot; in 2009. She acted in the films &quot;Amadeus&quot; (1984), &quot;James White&quot; (2015), and &quot;A Quiet Passion&quot; (2016). She portrayed Eleanor Roosevelt in &quot;Warm Springs&quot; (2005), Michele Davis in &quot;Too Big to Fail&quot; (2011), and Nancy Reagan in &quot;Killing Reagan&quot; (2016). Her other television credits include &quot;The Big C&quot; (2010–2011), &quot;Ratched&quot; (2020), and &quot;The Gilded Age&quot; (2022–present).

In 2018, Nixon ran for Governor of New York as part of the Working Families Party challenging Democratic incumbent Andrew Cuomo. She lost the Democratic primary to Cuomo on September 13, 2018, with 34% of the vote to his 66%. Nixon has been an advocate for LGBT rights in the United States, particularly the right of same-sex marriage. She met her wife at a 2002 gay rights rally, and announced her engagement at a rally for New York same-sex marriage in 2009. She received the Visibility Award from the Human Rights Campaign in 2018.

==Early life and education==
Nixon was born in Manhattan, the only child of Walter Elmer Nixon Jr., a radio journalist from Harlingen, Texas, and Anne Elizabeth (née Knoll), an actress originally from Chicago. She credits her mother with &quot;indoctrinating&quot; her into theatre. She is of English and German descent. Her grandparents were Adolph Knoll, Etta Elizabeth Williams, Walter E. Nixon, and Grace Truman McCormack. Nixon&#x27;s parents divorced when she was six years old. According to Nixon, her father was often unemployed and her mother was the household&#x27;s main breadwinner: Nixon&#x27;s mother worked on the game show &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, coaching the &quot;impostors&quot; who claimed to be the person described by the host.

Nixon was an actress all through her years at Hunter College Elementary School and Hunter College High School (class of 1984), often taking time away from school to perform in film and on stage. Nixon also acted in order to pay her way through Barnard College, where she received a B.A. in English Literature. Nixon was also a student in the Semester at Sea Program in the Spring of 1986.

==Career==
===1979–1997: Early roles and theatre work ===
Nixon&#x27;s first onscreen appearance (at 8 years old) was as an imposter on &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, where her mother worked, pretending to be a junior horse riding champion. She began acting at 12 as the object of a wealthy schoolmate&#x27;s crush in &quot;The Seven Wishes of a Rich Kid&quot;, a 1979 ABC Afterschool Special. She made her feature debut co-starring with Kristy McNichol and Tatum O&#x27;Neal in &quot;Little Darlings&quot; (1980). She made her Broadway debut as Dinah Lord in a 1980 revival of &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot;. Alternating between film, TV, and stage, she did projects like the 1982 ABC movie &quot;My Body, My Child&quot;, the features &quot;Prince of the City&quot; (1981) and &quot;I Am the Cheese&quot; (1983), and the 1982 Off-Broadway productions of John Guare&#x27;s &quot;Lydie Breeze&quot;.

In 1984, while a freshman at Barnard College, Nixon made theatrical history by simultaneously appearing in two hit Broadway plays directed by Mike Nichols. They were &quot;The Real Thing&quot;, where she played the daughter of Jeremy Irons and Christine Baranski; and &quot;Hurlyburly&quot;, where she played a young woman who encounters sleazy Hollywood executives. The two theaters were just two blocks apart and Nixon&#x27;s roles were both short, so she could run from one to the other. Onscreen, she played the role of Salieri&#x27;s maid/spy, Lorl, in &quot;Amadeus&quot; (1984). In 1985, she appeared alongside Jeff Daniels in Lanford Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Lemon Sky&quot; at Second Stage Theatre.

She landed her first major supporting role in a movie as an intelligent teenager who aids her boyfriend (Christopher Collet) in building a nuclear bomb in Marshall Brickman&#x27;s &quot;The Manhattan Project&quot; (1986). Nixon was part of the cast of the NBC miniseries &quot;The Murder of Mary Phagan&quot; (NBC, 1988) starring Jack Lemmon and Kevin Spacey, and portrayed the daughter of a presidential candidate (Michael Murphy) in &quot;Tanner &#x27;88&quot; (1988), Robert Altman&#x27;s political satire for HBO. She reprised the role for the 2004 sequel, &quot;Tanner on Tanner&quot;.

On stage, Nixon portrayed Juliet in a 1988 New York Shakespeare Festival production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, and acted in the workshop production of Wendy Wasserstein&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning &quot;The Heidi Chronicles&quot;, playing several characters after it came to Broadway in 1989. She was the guest star in the second episode of the long running NBC television series &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;. She played the role of an agoraphobic woman in a February 1993 episode of &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, titled &quot;Threshold of Fear&quot;.

Nixon succeeded Marcia Gay Harden as Harper Pitt in Tony Kushner&#x27;s &quot;Angels in America&quot; (1994), received a Tony nomination for her performance in &quot;Indiscretions&quot; (&quot;Les Parents Terribles&quot;) (1996), her sixth Broadway show, and, although she originally lost the part to another actress, eventually took over the role of Lala Levy in the Tony-winning &quot;The Last Night of Ballyhoo&quot; (1997).

Nixon was a founding member of the Off-Broadway theatrical troupe Drama Dept., which included Sarah Jessica Parker, Dylan Baker, John Cameron Mitchell and Billy Crudup among its actors, appearing in the group&#x27;s productions of &quot;Kingdom on Earth&quot; (1996), &quot;June Moon&quot; and &quot;As Bees in Honey Drown&quot; (both 1997), &quot;Hope is the Thing with Feathers&quot; (1998), and &quot;The Country Club&quot; (1999). She had supporting roles in &quot;Addams Family Values&quot; (1993), &quot;Baby&#x27;s Day Out&quot; (1994), &quot;Marvin&#x27;s Room&quot; (1996), and &quot;The Out-of-Towners&quot; (1999).

===1998–2011: &quot;Sex and the City&quot; and other roles ===
She was one of the four regulars on HBO&#x27;s comedy &quot;Sex and the City&quot; (1998–2004), as the lawyer Miranda Hobbes. Nixon received three Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series (2002, 2003, 2004), winning the award in 2004, for the show&#x27;s final season.

Nixon next had her first leading role in a feature, playing a video artist who falls in love, despite her best efforts to avoid commitment, with a bisexual actor who just happens to be dating a gay man (her best friend) in &quot;Advice from a Caterpillar&quot; (2000), as well as starring opposite Scott Bakula in the holiday television movie &quot;Papa&#x27;s Angels&quot; (2000). In 2002, she also acted in the indie comedy &quot;Igby Goes Down&quot;, and her turn in the theatrical production of Clare Boothe Luce&#x27;s play &quot;The Women&quot; was captured for PBS&#x27; &quot;Stage on Screen&quot; series.

Post-&quot;Sex and the City&quot;, Nixon made a guest appearance on &quot;ER&quot; in 2005, as a mother who undergoes a tricky procedure to lessen the effects of a debilitating stroke. She followed up with a turn as Eleanor Roosevelt for HBO&#x27;s &quot;Warm Springs&quot; (2005), which chronicled Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x27;s quest for a miracle cure for his polio. Nixon earned an Emmy nomination as Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie for her performance. In December 2005, she appeared in the Fox TV series &quot;House&quot; in the episode &quot;Deception&quot;, as a patient who suffers a seizure.

In 2006, she appeared in David Lindsay-Abaire&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning drama &quot;Rabbit Hole&quot; in a Manhattan Theatre Club production, and won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Play). In 2008, she revived her role as Miranda Hobbes in the &quot;Sex and the City&quot; feature film, directed by HBO executive producer Michael Patrick King and co-starring the cast of the original series. Also in 2008, she won an Emmy for her guest appearance in an episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, portraying a woman pretending to have dissociative identity disorder. In 2009, Nixon won the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album along with Beau Bridges and Blair Underwood for the album &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot; (Al Gore).
In March 2010, Nixon received the Vito Russo Award at the GLAAD Media Awards. The award is presented to an openly LGBTQ media professional &quot;who has made a significant difference in promoting equality for the LGBT community&quot;. It was announced in June 2010 that Nixon would appear in four episodes of the Showtime series &quot;The Big C&quot;. Nixon appeared in a &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; episode based on the problems surrounding the Broadway musical &quot;Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark&quot;. Her character is &quot;Amanda Reese, the high-strung and larger-than-life director behind a problem-plagued Broadway version of &quot;Icarus&quot;,&quot; loosely modeled after &quot;Spider-Man&quot; director Julie Taymor.

=== 2012–2019: Return to Broadway ===
In 2012, Nixon starred as Professor Vivian Bearing in the Broadway debut of Margaret Edson&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize–winning play &quot;Wit&quot;. Produced by the Manhattan Theatre Club, the play opened January 26, 2012 at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre. Nixon received a Tony Award nomination for Best Actress in a Play for the performance. In 2012, Nixon also starred as Petranilla in the TV miniseries of Ken Follett&#x27;s &quot;World Without End&quot; broadcast on the ReelzChannel, alongside Ben Chaplin, Peter Firth, Charlotte Riley, and Miranda Richardson.

In 2015, Nixon appeared in two films which premiered at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival: &quot;Stockholm, Pennsylvania&quot; and &quot;James White&quot;. She received critical acclaim for both performances, especially for the latter, which some considered as &quot;Oscar-worthy&quot;.

Nixon played the leading role of reclusive American poet Emily Dickinson in the biographical film &quot;A Quiet Passion&quot; directed and written by Terence Davies. The film premiered in February 2016 at the 66th Berlin International Film Festival. In May 2016, it was announced that Nixon would play Nancy Reagan in the upcoming television film adaptation of &quot;Killing Reagan&quot;. The film aired in October 2016.

Nixon appeared on Broadway in the revival of &quot;The Little Foxes&quot;, officially opening on April 19, 2017, at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre. She alternated the roles of Regina and Birdie with Laura Linney, winning her second Tony Award for her performance as Birdie.

=== 2020–present: Streaming shows ===
In January 2019, it was announced that Nixon will star in the upcoming Netflix drama series &quot;Ratched&quot;. Since 2021 she returned to the role of Miranda Hobbes in the &quot;Sex and the City&quot; revival &quot;And Just Like That...&quot; for HBO Max where she also serves as an executive producer. Since 2022 she took a leading role of Ada Brook in another HBO Max show &quot;The Gilded Age&quot; starring alongside Louisa Jacobson, Christine Baranski, and Carrie Coon.

==Political activism==
Nixon is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America. Nixon is a long-time advocate for public education. She is a spokesperson for New York&#x27;s Alliance for Quality Education, a public education fairness advocacy organization. Nixon also has a history of advocacy in support of women&#x27;s health.

She endorsed Bill de Blasio in the 2013 New York City mayoral election, who went on to win the Democratic nomination and the general election. Nixon campaigned actively for de Blasio, whom she had worked with since the early 2000s when campaigning against Michael Bloomberg&#x27;s education policies. De Blasio credited Nixon and union leader George Gresham as the two &quot;architects of (his) campaign&quot; in the Democratic primaries, when he defeated the favorite Christine Quinn. After his election, de Blasio appointed Nixon as his representative to The Public Theater.

In the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Nixon endorsed Bernie Sanders before campaigning for him in early February 2020 in Las Vegas. She stated, &quot;In the same terrifying and muscular way that Trump is a force for so much of what is bad in this country, in this world, Bernie has that same kind of muscularity of vision but for good. A candidate who is too beholden to big money and the establishment and just basically doesn&#x27;t want to rock the boat is never going to be a powerful enough counterbalance to what Donald Trump has to offer. You need someone as vigorous and who is wanting to turn the system upside down.&quot;

In 2023, Nixon signed an open letter expressing &quot;serious concerns about editorial bias&quot; in reporting by the &quot;New York Times&quot; on transgender people. The letter characterized the NYT&#x27;s coverage as using &quot;an eerily familiar mix of pseudoscience and euphemistic, charged language&quot;, and raised concerns regarding the NYT&#x27;s employment practices regarding trans contributors.

===2018 New York gubernatorial election===

On March 19, 2018, Nixon announced her campaign for Governor of New York as a challenger to Democratic incumbent Andrew Cuomo. Her platform focused on income inequality, renewable energy, establishing universal health care, stopping mass incarceration in the United States, and protecting undocumented children from deportation. She lost in the Democratic primary to Cuomo on September 13, 2018, with 34% of the vote to his 66%. Nixon was initially nominated as the gubernatorial candidate for the Working Families Party; however, the party threw its support to Cuomo, after he defeated Nixon in the Democratic primary.

Nixon was expected to secure the nomination of the Working Families Party of New York during its annual convention in April 2018, thus guaranteeing her a spot on the general election ballot. On April 15, Nixon won 91.5 percent of the vote at the Party&#x27;s statewide committee meeting after Cuomo withdrew himself from consideration at the last minute. Nixon stated that in the event that she did not also secure the Democratic nomination, she would &quot;confer with the Working Families Party and we will make the decision we think is best&quot;.

The endorsement caused a schism in the party, as labor unions, including the Service Employees International Union, and Communications Workers of America, indicated they would not support the party in the election. The withdrawal, it was believed, would significantly hurt the party&#x27;s finances which, in 2018, were at a level of $1.7 million and supported a statewide staff of about 15 people. The battle received considerable attention since there were concerns that Nixon might drain enough votes from Cuomo in the general election to allow a Republican to be elected (though Cuomo was comfortably leading the polls at the time). Cuomo had vigorously campaigned to get the nomination before withdrawing when it was clear he would not get it.

In contrast to Cuomo, Nixon supported the legalization of marijuana. The most important reason, she said, was racial justice. &quot;People across all ethnic and racial lines use marijuana at roughly the same rate, but the arrests for marijuana are 80 percent black and Latino.&quot; Nixon said that the revenues from legalization should be prioritized to the communities that had been harmed by them, as a form of &quot;reparations&quot;. She said that people in jail on marijuana charges should be released, criminal records for marijuana use should be expunged, and marijuana revenues should be used to help them reenter society. However, many black leaders were offended by her use of the term &quot;reparations&quot;.

On June 22, 2018, during a campaign event in New York City, Nixon referred to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as a “terrorist organization” and called for the agency to be abolished. She later reiterated her claim in a Twitter post.

On May 23, 2018, Nixon and other potential Democratic challengers to Cuomo were eliminated from the Democratic party endorsement at the state Democratic Convention after failing to meet the 25% state delegate threshold needed to appear on the ballot. Nixon filed a petition with 65,000 signatures, more than four times the 15,000 required, to force a primary election. The primary was held on September 13. With 93% of precincts reporting, Cuomo received 65% of votes and Nixon got 35%. 

On October 5, 2018, the Working Families Party removed Nixon&#x27;s name from their ticket after deciding to endorse Cuomo and Hochul, thus ensuring that Nixon would not appear on the general election ballot.

In August 2021, Cuomo was forced to resign as governor following allegations of sexual harassment by women who worked in his office. As a result of the scandal, he was stripped of the honorary Emmy given to him for his televised Covid briefings in 2020. After he left office, Nixon tweeted on August 24, 2021: &quot;The difference between me and Andrew Cuomo? Neither of us is governor, but I still have my Emmy(s).&quot;

===2023 support for Palestine===
Nixon supports South Africa&#x27;s genocide case against Israel. She contributed to a video series, published by the Palestine Festival of Literature, in support of South Africa&#x27;s motion, accusing Israel of genocide against civilians in Gaza. The ICJ ruled it was plausible that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.

==Personal life==
From 1988 to 2003, Nixon was in a relationship with educator Danny Mozes. They have two children together. In June 2018, Nixon revealed that her older child is transgender.
In 2004, Nixon began dating education activist Christine Marinoni. Nixon and Marinoni became engaged in April 2009, and married in New York City on May 27, 2012, with Nixon wearing a custom-made, pale green dress by Carolina Herrera. Marinoni gave birth to a son in 2011.

Regarding her sexual orientation, Nixon remarked in 2007: &quot;I don&#x27;t really feel I&#x27;ve changed. I&#x27;d been with men all my life, and I&#x27;d never fallen in love with a woman. But when I did, it didn&#x27;t seem so strange. I&#x27;m just a woman in love with another woman.&quot; She identified herself as bisexual in 2012, and as queer starting in 2018. Prior to the legalization of same-sex marriage in Washington state (Marinoni&#x27;s home state), Nixon had taken a public stand supporting the issue, and hosted a fundraising event in support of Washington Referendum 74.

In October 2006, Nixon was diagnosed with breast cancer during a routine mammography. She initially decided not to go public with her illness because she feared it might hurt her career, but in April 2008, she announced her battle with the disease in an interview with &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. Since then, Nixon has become a breast cancer activist. She convinced the head of NBC to air her breast cancer special in a prime time program, and became an ambassador for Susan G. Komen for the Cure.

She and Marinoni live in the Kips Bay neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. Nixon and her family attend Congregation Beit Simchat Torah, an LGBT synagogue.

<doc id="161260" wikidata="Q10615255" url="?curid=161260" title="Incircle and excircles">
<text>In geometry, the incircle or inscribed circle of a triangle is the largest circle that can be contained in the triangle; it touches (is tangent to) the three sides. The center of the incircle is a triangle center called the triangle&#x27;s incenter.

An excircle or escribed circle of the triangle is a circle lying outside the triangle, tangent to one of its sides and tangent to the extensions of the other two. Every triangle has three distinct excircles, each tangent to one of the triangle&#x27;s sides.

The center of the incircle, called the [[incenter]], can be found as the intersection of the three internal angle bisectors. The center of an excircle is the intersection of the internal bisector of one angle (at vertex , for example) and the external bisectors of the other two. The center of this excircle is called the excenter relative to the vertex , or the excenter of . Because the internal bisector of an angle is perpendicular to its external bisector, it follows that the center of the incircle together with the three excircle centers form an orthocentric system.

==Incircle and Incenter==
Suppose formula_1 has an incircle with radius formula_2 and center formula_3. Let formula_4 be the length of formula_5, formula_6 the length of formula_7, and formula_8 the length of formula_9.

Also let formula_10, formula_11, and formula_12 be the touchpoints where the incircle touches formula_5, formula_7, and formula_9.

===Incenter===
The incenter is the point where the internal angle bisectors of formula_16 meet.

====Trilinear coordinates====
The trilinear coordinates for a point in the triangle is the ratio of all the distances to the triangle sides. Because the incenter is the same distance from all sides of the triangle, the trilinear coordinates for the incenter are
:formula_17

====Barycentric coordinates====
The barycentric coordinates for a point in a triangle give weights such that the point is the weighted average of the triangle vertex positions.
Barycentric coordinates for the incenter are given by
:formula_18

where formula_4, formula_6, and formula_8 are the lengths of the sides of the triangle, or equivalently (using the law of sines) by
:formula_22

where formula_23, formula_24, and formula_25 are the angles at the three vertices.

====Cartesian coordinates====
The Cartesian coordinates of the incenter are a weighted average of the coordinates of the three vertices using the side lengths of the triangle relative to the perimeter (that is, using the barycentric coordinates given above, normalized to sum to unity) as weights. The weights are positive so the incenter lies inside the triangle as stated above. If the three vertices are located at formula_26, formula_27, and formula_28, and the sides opposite these vertices have corresponding lengths formula_4, formula_6, and formula_8, then the incenter is at
:formula_32

====Radius====
The inradius formula_2 of the incircle in a triangle with sides of length formula_4, formula_6, formula_8 is given by
:formula_37

where formula_38 is the semiperimeter.

The tangency points of the incircle divide the sides into segments of lengths formula_39 from formula_23, formula_41 from formula_24, and formula_43 from formula_25.

See Heron&#x27;s formula.

====Distances to the vertices====
Denote the incenter of formula_1 as formula_3.

The distance from vertex formula_23 to the incenter formula_3 is:
:formula_49

====Derivation of the formula stated above====
Use the Law of sines in the triangle formula_50.

We get formula_51.
We have that formula_52.

It follows that formula_53.

The equality with the second expression is obtained the same way.

The distances from the incenter to the vertices combined with the lengths of the triangle sides obey the equation
:formula_54

Additionally,
:formula_55

where formula_56 and formula_2 are the triangle&#x27;s circumradius and inradius respectively.

====Other properties====
The collection of triangle centers may be given the structure of a group under coordinate-wise multiplication of trilinear coordinates; in this group, the incenter forms the identity element.

===Incircle and its radius properties===

====Distances between vertex and nearest touchpoints====
The distances from a vertex to the two nearest touchpoints are equal; for example:
:formula_58

====Other properties====
If the altitudes from sides of lengths formula_4, formula_6, and formula_8 are formula_62, formula_63, and formula_64, then the inradius formula_2 is one-third of the harmonic mean of these altitudes; that is,
:formula_66

The product of the incircle radius formula_2 and the circumcircle radius formula_56 of a triangle with sides formula_4, formula_6, and formula_8 is
:formula_72

Some relations among the sides, incircle radius, and circumcircle radius are:
:formula_73

Any line through a triangle that splits both the triangle&#x27;s area and its perimeter in half goes through the triangle&#x27;s incenter (the center of its incircle). There are either one, two, or three of these for any given triangle.

The incircle radius is no greater than one-ninth the sum of the altitudes.

The squared distance from the incenter formula_3 to the circumcenter formula_75 is given by
:formula_76

and the distance from the incenter to the center formula_77 of the nine point circle is
:formula_78

The incenter lies in the medial triangle (whose vertices are the midpoints of the sides).

====Relation to area of the triangle====

The radius of the incircle is related to the area of the triangle. The ratio of the area of the incircle to the area of the triangle is less than or equal to formula_79,
with equality holding only for equilateral triangles.

Suppose formula_1 has an incircle with radius formula_2 and center formula_3. Let formula_4 be the length of formula_5, formula_6 the length of formula_7, and formula_8 the length of formula_9.

Now, the incircle is tangent to formula_9 at some point formula_12, and so formula_91 is right. Thus, the radius formula_92 is an altitude of formula_50.

Therefore, formula_50 has base length formula_8 and height formula_2, and so has area formula_97.

Similarly, formula_98 has area formula_99 and formula_100 has area formula_101.

Since these three triangles decompose formula_1, we see that the area formula_103 is:
:formula_104

 and formula_105

where formula_106 is the area of formula_1 and formula_38 is its semiperimeter.

For an alternative formula, consider formula_109. This is a right-angled triangle with one side equal to formula_2 and the other side equal to formula_111. The same is true for formula_112. The large triangle is composed of six such triangles and the total area is:
:formula_113

===Gergonne triangle and point===
The Gergonne triangle (of formula_1) is defined by the three touchpoints of the incircle on the three sides. The touchpoint opposite formula_23 is denoted formula_10, etc.

This Gergonne triangle, formula_117, is also known as the contact triangle or intouch triangle of formula_1. Its area is
:formula_119

where formula_120, formula_2, and formula_122 are the area, radius of the incircle, and semiperimeter of the original triangle, and formula_4, formula_6, and formula_8 are the side lengths of the original triangle. This is the same area as that of the extouch triangle.

The three lines formula_126, formula_127, and formula_128 intersect in a single point called the Gergonne point, denoted as formula_129 (or triangle center &quot;X&quot;7). The Gergonne point lies in the open orthocentroidal disk punctured at its own center, and can be any point therein.

The Gergonne point of a triangle has a number of properties, including that it is the symmedian point of the Gergonne triangle.

Trilinear coordinates for the vertices of the intouch triangle are given by
:formula_130

Trilinear coordinates for the Gergonne point are given by
:formula_131

or, equivalently, by the Law of Sines,
:formula_132

==Excircles and excenters==
An excircle or escribed circle of the triangle is a circle lying outside the triangle, tangent to one of its sides, and tangent to the extensions of the other two. Every triangle has three distinct excircles, each tangent to one of the triangle&#x27;s sides.

The center of an excircle is the intersection of the internal bisector of one angle (at vertex formula_23, for example) and the external bisectors of the other two. The center of this excircle is called the excenter relative to the vertex formula_23, or the excenter of formula_23. Because the internal bisector of an angle is perpendicular to its external bisector, it follows that the center of the incircle together with the three excircle centers form an orthocentric system.

===Trilinear coordinates of excenters===
While the incenter of formula_1 has trilinear coordinates formula_137, the excenters have trilinears

:formula_138

===Exradii===
The radii of the excircles are called the exradii.

The exradius of the excircle opposite formula_23 (so touching formula_140, centered at formula_141) is
:formula_142 where formula_143

See Heron&#x27;s formula.

====Derivation of exradii formula====
Source:

Let the excircle at side formula_144 touch at side formula_145 extended at formula_146, and let this excircle&#x27;s
radius be formula_147 and its center be formula_148. Then formula_149 is an altitude of formula_150, so formula_150 has area formula_152. By a similar argument, formula_153 has area formula_154 and formula_155 has area formula_156. Thus the area formula_106 of triangle formula_1 is
:formula_159.

So, by symmetry, denoting formula_2 as the radius of the incircle,
:formula_161.

By the Law of Cosines, we have
:formula_162

Combining this with the identity formula_163, we have
:formula_164

But formula_165, and so
:formula_166

which is Heron&#x27;s formula.

Combining this with formula_167, we have
:formula_168

Similarly, formula_169 gives
:formula_170

====Other properties====
From the formulas above one can see that the excircles are always larger than the incircle and that the largest excircle is the one tangent to the longest side and the smallest excircle is tangent to the shortest side. Further, combining these formulas yields:
:formula_171

===Other excircle properties===
The circular hull of the excircles is internally tangent to each of the excircles and is thus an Apollonius circle. The radius of this Apollonius circle is formula_172 where formula_2 is the incircle radius and formula_122 is the semiperimeter of the triangle.

The following relations hold among the inradius formula_2, the circumradius formula_56, the semiperimeter formula_122, and the excircle radii formula_178, formula_179, formula_147:
:formula_181

The circle through the centers of the three excircles has radius formula_182.

If formula_183 is the orthocenter of formula_1, then
:formula_185

===Nagel triangle and Nagel point===

The Nagel triangle or extouch triangle of formula_1 is denoted by the vertices formula_10, formula_11, and formula_12 that are the three points where the excircles touch the reference formula_1 and where formula_10 is opposite of formula_23, etc. This formula_117 is also known as the extouch triangle of formula_1. The circumcircle of the extouch formula_117 is called the Mandart circle
(cf. Mandart inellipse).

The three line segments formula_196, formula_197 and formula_198 are called the splitters of the triangle; they each bisect the perimeter of the triangle,
:formula_199

The splitters intersect in a single point, the triangle&#x27;s Nagel point formula_200 (or triangle center &quot;X&quot;8).

Trilinear coordinates for the vertices of the extouch triangle are given by
:formula_201

Trilinear coordinates for the Nagel point are given by
:formula_202

or, equivalently, by the Law of Sines,
:formula_203

The Nagel point is the isotomic conjugate of the Gergonne point.

==Related constructions==

===Nine-point circle and Feuerbach point===


In geometry, the nine-point circle is a circle that can be constructed for any given triangle. It is so named because it passes through nine significant concyclic points defined from the triangle. These nine points are:

* The midpoint of each side of the triangle
* The foot of each altitude
* The midpoint of the line segment from each vertex of the triangle to the orthocenter (where the three altitudes meet; these line segments lie on their respective altitudes).

In 1822, Karl Feuerbach discovered that any triangle&#x27;s nine-point circle is externally tangent to that triangle&#x27;s three excircles and internally tangent to its incircle; this result is known as Feuerbach&#x27;s theorem. He proved that:
:... the circle which passes through the feet of the altitudes of a triangle is tangent to all four circles which in turn are tangent to the three sides of the triangle ... 

The triangle center at which the incircle and the nine-point circle touch is called the Feuerbach point.

===Incentral and excentral triangles===
The points of intersection of the interior angle bisectors of formula_1 with the segments formula_140, formula_206, and formula_144 are the vertices of the incentral triangle. Trilinear coordinates for the vertices of the incentral triangle formula_208 are given by
:formula_209

The excentral triangle of a reference triangle has vertices at the centers of the reference triangle&#x27;s excircles. Its sides are on the external angle bisectors of the reference triangle (see figure at top of page). Trilinear coordinates for the vertices of the excentral triangle formula_208 are given by
:formula_211

==Equations for four circles==
Let formula_212 be a variable point in trilinear coordinates, and let formula_213, formula_214, formula_215. The four circles described above are given equivalently by either of the two given equations:
* Incircle:formula_216
* formula_23-excircle:formula_218
* formula_24-excircle:formula_220
* formula_25-excircle:formula_222

==Euler&#x27;s theorem==
Euler&#x27;s theorem states that in a triangle:
:formula_223

where formula_56 and formula_2 are the circumradius and inradius respectively, and formula_226 is the distance between the circumcenter and the incenter.

For excircles the equation is similar:
:formula_227

where formula_228 is the radius of one of the excircles, and formula_229 is the distance between the circumcenter and that excircle&#x27;s center.

==Generalization to other polygons==
Some (but not all) quadrilaterals have an incircle. These are called tangential quadrilaterals. Among their many properties perhaps the most important is that their two pairs of opposite sides have equal sums. This is called the Pitot theorem.

More generally, a polygon with any number of sides that has an inscribed circle (that is, one that is tangent to each side) is called a tangential polygon.

<doc id="161263" wikidata="Q897296" url="?curid=161263" title="Orthocentric system">
<text>In geometry, an orthocentric system is a set of four points on a plane, one of which is the orthocenter of the triangle formed by the other three. Equivalently, the lines passing through disjoint pairs among the points are perpendicular, and the four circles passing through any three of the four points have the same radius.

If four points form an orthocentric system, then &quot;each&quot; of the four points is the orthocenter of the other three. These four possible triangles will all have the same nine-point circle. Consequently these four possible triangles must all have circumcircles with the same circumradius.

==The common nine-point circle==

The center of this common nine-point circle lies at the centroid of the four orthocentric points. The radius of the common nine-point circle is the distance from the nine-point center to the midpoint of any of the six connectors that join any pair of orthocentric points through which the common nine-point circle passes. The nine-point circle also passes through the three orthogonal intersections at the feet of the altitudes of the four possible triangles.

This common nine-point center lies at the midpoint of the connector that joins any orthocentric point to the circumcenter of the triangle formed from the other three orthocentric points.

The common nine-point circle is tangent to all 16 incircles and excircles of the four triangles whose vertices form the orthocentric system.

==The common orthic triangle, its incenter, and its excenters==

If the six connectors that join any pair of orthocentric points are extended to six lines that intersect each other, they generate seven intersection points. Four of these points are the original orthocentric points and the additional three points are the orthogonal intersections at the feet of the altitudes. The joining of these three orthogonal points into a triangle generates an orthic triangle that is common to all the four possible triangles formed from the four orthocentric points taken three at a time.

The incenter of this common orthic triangle must be one of the original four orthocentric points. Furthermore, the three remaining points become the excenters of this common orthic triangle. The orthocentric point that becomes the incenter of the orthic triangle is that orthocentric point closest to the common nine-point center. This relationship between the orthic triangle and the original four orthocentric points leads directly to the fact that the incenter and excenters of a reference triangle form an orthocentric system.

It is normal to distinguish one of the orthocentric points from the others, specifically the one that is the incenter of the orthic triangle; this one is denoted as the orthocenter of the outer three orthocentric points that are chosen as a reference triangle . In this normalized configuration, the point will always lie within the triangle , and all the angles of triangle will be acute. The four possible triangles referred above are then triangles . The six connectors referred above are . The seven intersections referred above are (the original orthocentric points), and (the feet of the altitudes of triangle and the vertices of the orthic triangle).

==The orthocentric system and its orthic axes==

The orthic axis associated with a normalized orthocentric system , where is the reference triangle, is a line that passes through three intersection points formed when each side of the orthic triangle meets each side of the reference triangle. Now consider the three other possible triangles, . They each have their own orthic axis.

==Euler lines and homothetic orthocentric systems==

Let vectors determine the position of each of the four orthocentric points and let be the position vector of , the common nine-point center. Join each of the four orthocentric points to their common nine-point center and extend them into four lines. These four lines now represent the Euler lines of the four possible triangles where the extended line is the Euler line of triangle and the extended line is the Euler line of triangle etc. If a point is chosen on the Euler line of the reference triangle with a position vector such that where is a pure constant independent of the positioning of the four orthocentric points and three more points such that etc., then form an orthocentric system. This generated orthocentric system is always homothetic to the original system of four points with the common nine-point center as the homothetic center and α the ratio of similitude.

When is chosen as the centroid , then . When is chosen as the circumcenter , then and the generated orthocentric system is congruent to the original system as well as being a reflection of it about the nine-point center. In this configuration form a Johnson triangle of the original reference triangle . Consequently the circumcircles of the four triangles are all equal and form a set of Johnson circles as shown in the diagram adjacent.

==Further properties==

The four Euler lines of an orthocentric system are orthogonal to the four orthic axes of an orthocentric system.

The six connectors that join any pair of the original four orthocentric points will produce pairs of connectors that are orthogonal to each other such that they satisfy the distance equations

:formula_1

where is the common circumradius of the four possible triangles. These equations together with the law of sines result in the identity

:formula_2

Feuerbach&#x27;s theorem states that the nine-point circle is tangent to the incircle and the three excircles of a reference triangle. Because the nine-point circle is common to all four possible triangles in an orthocentric system it is tangent to 16 circles comprising the incircles and excircles of the four possible triangles.

Any conic that passes through the four orthocentric points can only be a rectangular hyperbola.
This is a result of Feuerbach&#x27;s conic theorem that states that for all circumconics of a reference triangle that also passes through its orthocenter, the locus of the center of such circumconics forms the nine-point circle and that the circumconics can only be rectangular hyperbolas.
The locus of the perspectors of this family of rectangular hyperbolas will always lie on the four orthic axes. So if a rectangular hyperbola is drawn through four orthocentric points it will have one fixed center on the common nine-point circle but it will have four perspectors one on each of the orthic axes of the four possible triangles. The one point on the nine-point circle that is the center of this rectangular hyperbola will have four different definitions dependent on which of the four possible triangles is used as the reference triangle.

The well documented rectangular hyperbolas that pass through four orthocentric points are the Feuerbach, Jeřábek and Kiepert circumhyperbolas of the reference triangle in a normalized system with as the orthocenter.

The four possible triangles have a set of four inconics known as the orthic inconics that share certain properties. The contacts of these inconics with the four possible triangles occur at the vertices of their common orthic triangle. In a normalized orthocentric system the orthic inconic that is tangent to the sides of the triangle is an inellipse and the orthic inconics of the other three possible triangles are hyperbolas. These four orthic inconics also share the same Brianchon point , the orthocentric point closest to the common nine-point center. The centers of these orthic inconics are the symmedian points of the four possible triangles.

There are many documented cubics that pass through a reference triangle and its orthocenter. The circumcubic known as the orthocubic - K006 is interesting in that it passes through three orthocentric systems as well as the three vertices of the orthic triangle (but not the orthocenter of the orthic triangle). The three orthocentric systems are the incenter and excenters, the reference triangle and its orthocenter and finally the orthocenter of the reference triangle together with the three other intersection points that this cubic has with the circumcircle of the reference triangle.

Any two polar circles of two triangles in an orthocentric system are orthogonal.

<text>Gregorio Luperón International Airport () , also known as Puerto Plata Airport, is located in Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic.The airport is named after General Gregorio Luperón, a Dominican military and state leader. Capable of handling planes of all sizes, &quot;Puerto Plata Airport&quot; has benefited from being in an area with many beaches, which are popular among charter airline passengers. The popularity of the city where it is located has also drawn a number of regularly scheduled passenger airlines over the years.

With over 704,000 passagers, It is the Dominican Republic&#x27;s fourth busiest airport by passenger traffic and aircraft movements, after Punta Cana, Santo Domingo and Santiago de los Caballeros. American Airlines is the primary international operator.

== History ==
The facility opened in 1979 with the purpose of boosting tourism in the North region, it has a runway 3,081 meters long x 46 meters wide, with the capacity to receive wide-body aircraft, including B-747 and A-340.

==Facilities==
The main terminal building has 10 gates: 5 with boarding bridges on the satellite concourse, and 2 boarding bridges and 3 without in the frontal concourse. The terminal has been remodeled with new floors, escalators, immigration hall, departure hall and duty-free areas along with restaurants. The terminal can support 4 Boeing 747-400s simultaneously after renovations to the airport made in 2013/14.

==Incidents==
*On February 6, 1996, Birgenair Flight 301 was bound for Frankfurt, Germany, but crashed shortly after take-off from Puerto Plata Airport into the Atlantic Ocean 26 kilometres off-shore, killing all 176 passengers and 13 crew members aboard, among them were 164 Germans. It was discovered later that one of the air speed indicators of the Boeing 757-200 was not working properly, confusing the pilots about whether the aircraft&#x27;s speed was too fast or too slow.

Duvall was born January 5, 1931, in San Diego, California, to Mildred Virginia Duvall (), an amateur actress, and Virginia-born Rear Admiral William Howard Duvall, United States Navy. The second of three sons, he has an elder brother, William Jr. and a younger brother, John (1934–2000), who was an entertainment lawyer. His mother was a relative of American Civil War General Robert E. Lee, and a member of the Lee Family of Virginia, while his father was a descendant of settler Mareen Duvall. Duvall was raised in the Christian Science religion and has stated that, while it is his belief, he does not attend church. He grew up primarily in Annapolis, Maryland, site of the United States Naval Academy. He recalled: &quot;I was a Navy brat. My father started at the Academy when he was 16, made captain at 39 and retired as a rear admiral.&quot; He attended Severn School in Severna Park, Maryland, and The Principia in St. Louis, Missouri. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in drama from Principia College in Elsah, Illinois, in 1953.

His father had expected him to attend the Naval Academy, but Duvall said &quot;I was terrible at everything but acting—I could barely get through school&quot;. He again defied his father by serving in the United States Army after the Korean War (from August 19, 1953, to August 20, 1954) leaving the Army as private first class. &quot;That&#x27;s led to some confusion in the press,&quot; he explained in 1984, &quot;Some stories have me shooting it out with the Commies from a foxhole over in Frozen Chosin. Pork Chop Hill stuff. Hell, I barely qualified with the M-1 rifle in basic training&quot;. While stationed at Camp Gordon (now Fort Eisenhower) in Georgia, Duvall acted in an amateur production of the comedy &quot;Room Service&quot; in nearby Augusta, Georgia.

In the winter of 1955, Duvall attended the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York City, under Sanford Meisner, on the G.I. Bill. During his two years there, Dustin Hoffman, Gene Hackman and James Caan were among his classmates. While studying acting, he worked as a Manhattan post office clerk. Duvall remains friends today with fellow California-born actors Hoffman and Hackman, whom he knew during their years as struggling actors. In 1955, Duvall roomed with Hoffman in a New York City apartment while they were studying together at the Playhouse. Around this time, he also roomed with Hackman, while working odd jobs such as clerking at Macy&#x27;s, sorting mail at the post office, and driving a truck.

== Career ==

=== Early career: 1952–1969 ===

====Theater====
Duvall began his professional acting career with the Gateway Playhouse, an Equity summer theater based in Bellport, Long Island, New York. Arguably his stage debut was in its 1952 season when he played the Pilot in &quot;Laughter in the Stars&quot;, an adaptation of &quot;The Little Prince&quot;, at what was then the Gateway Theatre.

After a year&#x27;s absence when he was with the U.S. Army (1953–1954), Duvall returned to Gateway in its 1955 summer season, playing: Eddie Davis in Ronald Alexander&#x27;s &quot;Time Out for Ginger&quot; (July 1955), Hal Carter in William Inge&#x27;s &quot;Picnic&quot; (July 1955), Charles Wilder in John Willard&#x27;s &quot;The Cat and the Canary&quot; (August 1955), Parris in Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Crucible&quot; (August 1955), and John the Witchboy in William Berney and Howard Richardson&#x27;s &quot;Dark of the Moon&quot; (September 1955). The playbill of &quot;Dark of the Moon&quot; indicated that he had portrayed the Witchboy before and that he would &quot;repeat his famous portrayal&quot; of this character for the 1955 season&#x27;s revival of this play. For Gateway&#x27;s 1956 season (his third season with the Gateway Players), he played the role of Max Halliday in Frederick Knott&#x27;s &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; (July 1956), Virgil Blessing in Inge&#x27;s &quot;Bus Stop&quot; (August 1956), and Clive Mortimer in John van Druten&#x27;s &quot;I Am a Camera&quot; (August 1956). The playbills for the 1956 season described him as &quot;an audience favorite&quot; in the last season and as having &quot;appeared at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York and studied acting with Sandy Meisner this past winter&quot;.

In its 1957 season, Duvall appeared as Mr. Mayher in Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot; (July 1957), as Hector in Jean Anouilh&#x27;s &quot;Thieves&#x27; Carnivall&quot; (July 1957), and the role which he once described as the &quot;catalyst of his career&quot;: Eddie Carbone in Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;A View from the Bridge&quot; (from July 30 to August 3, 1957, and directed by Ulu Grosbard, who was by then a regular director at the Gateway Theatre). Miller himself attended one of Duvall&#x27;s performances as Eddie, and during that performance he met important people which allowed him, in two months, to land a &quot;spectacular lead&quot; in the &quot;Naked City&quot; television series.

While appearing at the Gateway Theatre in the second half of the 1950s, Duvall was also appearing at the Augusta Civic Theatre, the McLean Theatre in Virginia and the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C.. The 1957 playbills also described him as &quot;a graduate of the Neighborhood Playhouse&quot; (indicating that he had completed his studies there by the summer of 1957), &quot;a member of Sanford Meisner&#x27;s professional workshop&quot; and as having worked with Alvin Epstein, a mime and a member of Marcel Marceau&#x27;s company. By this time (also July 1957), his theatrical credits included performances as Jimmy in &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; and as Harvey Weems in Horton Foote&#x27;s &quot;The Midnight Caller&quot;. Already receiving top-billing at the Gateway Playhouse, in the 1959 season, he appeared in lead roles as Stanley Kowalski in Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; (July–August 1959), Maxwell Archer in &quot;Once More with Feeling&quot;, Igor Romanoff in Peter Ustinov&#x27;s &quot;Romanoff and Juliet&quot;, and Joe Mancuso in Kyle Crichton&#x27;s &quot;The Happiest Millionaire&quot; (all in August 1959).

At the Neighborhood Playhouse, Meisner cast him in Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;Camino Real&quot; and the title role of Harvey Weems in Foote&#x27;s one-act play &quot;The Midnight Caller&quot;. The latter was already part of Duvall&#x27;s performance credits by mid-July 1957.

Duvall made his off-Broadway debut at the Gate Theater as Frank Gardner in George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Mrs. Warren&#x27;s Profession&quot; on June 25, 1958. This play closed three days later (June 28) after five performances. His other early off-Broadway credits include the role of Doug in the premiere of Michael Shurtleff&#x27;s &quot;Call Me By My Rightful Name&quot; on January 31, 1961, at One Sheridan Square and the role of Bob Smith in the premiere of William Snyder&#x27;s &quot;The Days and Nights of BeeBee Fenstermaker&quot; on September 17, 1962, until June 9, 1963, at the Sheridan Square Playhouse. His most notable off-Broadway performance, for which he won an Obie Award in 1965 and which he considers his &quot;Othello&quot;, was as Eddie Carbone (again) in Miller&#x27;s &quot;A View from the Bridge&quot; at the Sheridan Square Playhouse from January 28, 1965, to December 11, 1966. It was directed again by Ulu Grosbard with Dustin Hoffman. On February 2, 1966, he made his Broadway debut as Harry Roat, Jr in Frederick Knott&#x27;s &quot;Wait Until Dark&quot; at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre. This played at the Shubert Theatre and George Abbott Theatre and closed on December 31, 1966, at the Music Box Theatre. His other Broadway performance was as Walter Cole in David Mamet&#x27;s &quot;American Buffalo&quot;, which opened at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre on February 16, 1977, and closed at the Belasco Theatre on June 11, 1977.

====Television====
In 1959, Duvall made his first television appearance on &quot;Armstrong Circle Theater&quot; in the episode &quot;The Jailbreak&quot;. He appeared regularly on television as a guest actor during the 1960s, often in action, suspense, detective, or crime dramas. His appearances during this time include performances on &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;Naked City&quot;, &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, &quot;Route 66&quot;, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, &quot;Combat!&quot;, &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, &quot;T.H.E. Cat&quot;, &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot;, &quot;The Time Tunnel&quot;, &quot;The F.B.I.&quot;, and &quot;The Mod Squad&quot;.

====Film====
His film debut was as Boo Radley in the critically acclaimed &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; (1962). He was cast in the film on the recommendation of screenwriter Horton Foote, who met Duvall at Neighborhood Playhouse during a 1957 production of Foote&#x27;s play, &quot;The Midnight Caller&quot;. Foote, who collaborated with Duvall many more times over the course of their careers, said he believed Duvall had a particular love of common people and ability to infuse fascinating revelations into his roles. Foote has described Duvall as &quot;our number one actor&quot;.

After &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, Duvall appeared in a number of films during the 1960s, mostly in midsized parts, but also in a few larger supporting roles. Some of his more notable appearances include the role of Capt. Paul Cabot Winston in &quot;Captain Newman, M.D.&quot; (1963), Chiz in &quot;Countdown&quot; (1968), and Gordon in &quot;The Rain People&quot;. Duvall had a small part as a cab driver who ferries McQueen around just before the chase scene in the film &quot;Bullitt&quot; (1968). He was the notorious malefactor &quot;Lucky&quot; Ned Pepper in &quot;True Grit&quot; (1969), in which he engaged in a climactic shootout with John Wayne&#x27;s Rooster Cogburn on horseback.

=== Mid-career: 1970–1989 ===


Duvall became an important presence in American films beginning in the 1970s. He drew a considerable amount of attention in 1970 for his portrayal of the malevolent Major Frank Burns in the film &quot;MASH&quot; and for his portrayal of the title role in &quot;THX 1138&quot; in 1971 where he plays a fugitive trying to escape a society controlled by robots. His first major critical success came portraying Tom Hagen in &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; (1974), the 1972 film earning him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Also in 1974, Duvall played a corporate director (uncredited) in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s thriller &quot;The Conversation&quot;. In 1976, Duvall played supporting roles in &quot;The Eagle Has Landed&quot;, and as Dr. Watson in &quot;The Seven-Per-Cent Solution&quot; with Nicol Williamson, Alan Arkin, Vanessa Redgrave and Laurence Olivier.

By the mid-1970s Duvall was a top character actor; &quot;People&quot; described him as &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s No. 1 No. 2 lead&quot;. Duvall received another Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor and won both a BAFTA Award and Golden Globe Award for his role as Lt. Colonel Kilgore in &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; (1979). His line &quot;I love the smell of napalm in the morning&quot; from &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; is regarded as iconic in cinema history. The full text is:

Duvall received a BAFTA Award nomination for his portrayal of detestable television executive Frank Hackett in the critically acclaimed film &quot;Network&quot; (1976) and garnered an Oscar nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role in &quot;The Great Santini&quot; (1979) as the hard-boiled Marine Lt. Col. &quot;Bull&quot; Meechum. The latter role was based on a Marine aviator, Colonel Donald Conroy, the father of the book&#x27;s author Pat Conroy. He also co-starred with Laurence Olivier and Tommy Lee Jones in &quot;The Betsy&quot; (1978) and portrayed United States President Dwight D. Eisenhower in the television miniseries &quot;Ike&quot; (1979).

Francis Ford Coppola praised Duvall as &quot;one of the four or five best actors in the world&quot;. Wanting top billing in films, in 1977 Duvall returned to Broadway to appear as Walter Cole in David Mamet&#x27;s &quot;American Buffalo&quot;, stating &quot;I hope this will get me better film roles&quot;. He received a Drama Desk Award nomination for Outstanding Actor in a Play.
Duvall continued appearing in films during the 1980s, including the roles of a detective in &quot;True Confessions&quot; (1981), a disillusioned sportswriter Max Mercy in &quot;The Natural&quot; (1984) and Los Angeles police officer Bob Hodges in &quot;Colors&quot; (1988). He won an Oscar for Best Actor as country western singer Mac Sledge in &quot;Tender Mercies&quot; (1983). Duvall did his own singing, insisting it be added to his contract that he sing the songs himself; Duvall said, &quot;What&#x27;s the point if you&#x27;re not going to do your own [singing]? They&#x27;re just going to dub somebody else? I mean, there&#x27;s no point to that.&quot;

Actress Tess Harper, who co-starred, said Duvall inhabited the character so fully that she only got to know Mac Sledge and not Duvall himself. Director Bruce Beresford, too, said the transformation was so believable to him that he could feel his skin crawling up the back of his neck the first day of filming with Duvall. Beresford said of the actor, &quot;Duvall has the ability to completely inhabit the person he&#x27;s acting. He totally and utterly becomes that person to a degree which is uncanny.&quot; Nevertheless, Duvall and Beresford did not get along well during the production and often clashed during filming, including one day in which Beresford walked off the set in frustration.

In 1989, Duvall appeared in the miniseries &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; in the role of Captain Augustus &quot;Gus&quot; McCrae, Texas Rangers (retired). He has considered this particular role to be his personal favorite. He won a Golden Globe Award and earned an Emmy Award nomination. For his role as a former Texas Ranger peace officer, Duvall was trained in the use of Walker revolvers by the Texas marksman Joe Bowman.

=== Later career: 1990–present ===

For &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; (1990), Duvall declined to reprise the part of Tom Hagen, unless he was paid a salary comparable to Al Pacino&#x27;s. In 2004, Duvall said on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, &quot;if they paid Pacino twice what they paid me, that&#x27;s fine, but not three or four times, which is what they did.&quot; In 1992, Duvall founded the production company Butcher&#x27;s Run Films. Duvall has maintained a busy film career, sometimes appearing in as many as four in one year. He received Oscar nominations for his portrayals of evangelical preacher Euliss &quot;Sonny&quot; Dewey in &quot;The Apostle&quot; (1997)—a film he also wrote and directed—and lawyer Jerome Facher in &quot;A Civil Action&quot; (1998).

He directed &quot;Assassination Tango&quot; (2002), a thriller about one of his favorite hobbies, tango. He portrayed General Robert E. Lee in &quot;Gods and Generals&quot; in 2003.

Other roles during this period that displayed the actor&#x27;s wide range included that of a crew chief in &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; (1990), the father of an upper-class Southern family in &quot;Rambling Rose&quot; (1991), a retiring cop in &quot;Falling Down&quot; (1993), a Hispanic barber in &quot;Wrestling Ernest Hemingway&quot; (1993), a New York tabloid editor in &quot;The Paper&quot; (1994), a rural doctor in &quot;Phenomenon&quot; (1996), a father who owns a jumper horse farm in &quot;Something to Talk About&quot; (1995), an abusive father in 1996&#x27;s &quot;Sling Blade&quot;, and an astronaut in &quot;Deep Impact&quot; (1998).

He continued his film roles by appearing as a mechanic in &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot; (2000), a soccer coach in &quot;A Shot at Glory&quot; (2000), a scientist in &quot;The 6th Day&quot; (2000), a police officer in &quot;John Q.&quot; (2002), a trail boss in &quot;Open Range&quot; (2003), an old free spirit in &quot;Secondhand Lions&quot; (2003), another soccer coach in the comedy &quot;Kicking &amp; Screaming&quot; (2005), a Las Vegas poker champion in &quot;Lucky You&quot; (2007), a New York City police chief in &quot;We Own the Night&quot; (2007), the father of a dysfunctional family in &quot;Four Christmases&quot; (2008), a man who throws his own funeral party while still alive in &quot;Get Low&quot; (2010), and a retired Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant who owns a shooting range in &quot;Jack Reacher&quot; (2012).

He has his own star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.

Duvall has periodically worked in television from the 1990s on. He won a Golden Globe Award and garnered an Emmy nomination for his portrayal of Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin in the 1992 television film &quot;Stalin&quot;. He was nominated for an Emmy again in 1997 for portraying Adolf Eichmann in &quot;The Man Who Captured Eichmann&quot;. In 2006, he won an Emmy for the role of Prentice &quot;Print&quot; Ritter in the revisionist Western miniseries &quot;Broken Trail&quot;.

In 2005, Duvall was awarded a National Medal of Arts by President George W. Bush at the White House. In 2014, he starred in &quot;The Judge&quot; alongside Robert Downey Jr. While the movie itself received mixed reviews, Duvall&#x27;s performance was praised. He was nominated for a Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild, and Academy Award for his supporting role. In 2015, at age 84, Duvall became the oldest actor ever nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in the film &quot;The Judge&quot;, a record that has since been surpassed by Christopher Plummer.

In 2018, Duvall appeared in the Steve McQueen-directed heist thriller &quot;Widows&quot; as a corrupt power broker. The film earned critical acclaim. In 2022, he appeared in the Netflix films &quot;Hustle&quot; and &quot;The Pale Blue Eye&quot;.

== Personal life ==
=== Relationships ===

Duvall has been married four times but does not have any children. &quot;I guess I&#x27;m shooting blanks,&quot; he said in 2007. He has said, &quot;[I’ve tried] with a lot of different women, in and out of marriage.&quot; Duvall met his first wife, Barbara Benjamin, a former announcer and dancer on &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;, during the shooting of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;. She had also appeared in &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; (1955) and &quot;The Courtship of Eddie&#x27;s Father&quot; (1963) using the name Barbara Brent. She had two daughters from her previous marriage. They were married from 1964 until 1975. His second wife was Gail Youngs, to whom he was married from 1982 to 1986. His marriage to Youngs temporarily made him the brother-in-law of John Savage, Robin Young, and Jim Youngs. His third marriage was to Sharon Brophy, a dancer, from 1991 to 1995.

In 2005, Duvall married his fourth wife, Luciana Pedraza, granddaughter of Argentine aviation pioneer Susana Ferrari Billinghurst. He met Pedraza in Argentina, recalling, &quot;The flower shop was closed, so I went to the bakery. If the flower shop had been open, I never would&#x27;ve met her.&quot; They were both born on January 5, but Duvall is 41 years older. They have been together since 1997. He produced, directed, and acted with her in &quot;Assassination Tango&quot;, with the majority of filming in Buenos Aires. Duvall is also known as a very skilled Argentine tango dancer, having a tango studio in Argentina and in the United States.

Duvall is known to train Brazilian jiu-jitsu and practices martial arts with his wife.

=== Politics ===
Duvall&#x27;s political views are variously described as libertarian or conservative. He was personally invited to Republican President George W. Bush&#x27;s inauguration in 2001. In September 2007, he announced his support for Rudy Giuliani&#x27;s campaign in the 2008 Republican Party presidential primaries. Duvall worked the floor at the GOP&#x27;s 2008 national convention. In September 2008, he appeared onstage at a John McCain–Sarah Palin rally in New Mexico, and he endorsed Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012. However, in 2014, Duvall said in an interview he had become an independent.

=== Philanthropy and activism ===
In 2001, Pedraza and Duvall founded the Robert Duvall Children&#x27;s Fund to assist families in Northern Argentina through renovations of homes, schools, and medical facilities. Duvall and Pedraza have been active supporters of Pro Mujer, a nonprofit charity organization dedicated to helping Latin America&#x27;s poorest women (with Duvall and Pedraza concentrating on Pedraza&#x27;s home in the Argentine Northwest).

In May 2009, Duvall spoke for historic preservation against Walmart&#x27;s proposal to build a store across the road from the entrance to the Wilderness Battlefield national park in Orange County, Virginia. In 2011, he appeared at the Texas Children&#x27;s Cancer Center charity event, &quot;An Evening with a Texas Legend&quot;, in Houston, where he was interviewed by Bob Schieffer.

In February 2023, Duvall spoke at a council meeting in suburban Virginia against a proposed Amazon facility. The facility was nonetheless approved.

== Acting credits and accolades ==
Duvall has received numerous accolades for his acting including an Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as an alcoholic former country music star in the drama &quot;Tender Mercies&quot; (1983). He has also received a British Academy Film Award, two Primetime Emmy Awards, four Golden Globe Awards, and a Screen Actors Guild Award.

<text>Sitting is a basic action and resting position in which the body weight is supported primarily by the bony ischial tuberosities with the buttocks in contact with the ground or a horizontal surface such as a chair seat, instead of by the lower limbs as in standing, squatting or kneeling. When sitting, the torso is more or less upright, although sometimes it can lean against other objects for a more relaxed posture.

Sitting for much of the day may pose significant health risks, with one study suggesting people who sit regularly for prolonged periods may have higher mortality rates than those who do not. The average person sits down for 4.7 hours per day, according to a global review representing 47% of the global adult population.

The form of kneeling where the buttocks sit back on the heels, for example as in the &quot;Seiza&quot; and &quot;Vajrasana&quot; postures, is also often interpreted as sitting.

==Prevalence==
The British Chiropractic Association said in 2006 that 32% of the British population spent more than ten hours per day sitting down.

==Positions==
=== On the floor ===
The most common ways of sitting on the floor involve bending the knees. One can also sit with the legs unbent, using something solid as support for the back or leaning on one&#x27;s arms. Sitting with bent legs can be done with the legs mostly parallel or by crossing them over each other.

A common cross-legged position is with the lower part of both legs folded towards the body, crossing each other at the ankle or calf, with both ankles on the floor, sometimes with the feet tucked under the knees or thighs. The position is known in several European languages as tailor&#x27;s posture, from the traditional working posture of tailors . It is also named after various plains-dwelling nomads: in American English , in many European languages &quot;Turkish style&quot;, and in Japanese . In yoga it is known as sukhasana, meaning &quot;easy pose.&quot;

===On a raised seat===
Various raised surfaces at the appropriate height can be used as for humans, whether they are made for the purpose, such as chairs, stools and benches, or not. While the buttocks are nearly always rested on the raised surface, there are many differences in how one can hold one&#x27;s legs and back.

There are two major styles of sitting on a raised surface. The first has one or two of the legs in front of the sitting person; in the second, sitting astride something, the legs incline outwards on either side of the body.

The feet can rest on the floor or on a footrest, which can keep them vertical, horizontal, or at an angle in between. They can also dangle if the seat is sufficiently high. Legs can be kept right to the front of the body, spread apart, or one crossed over the other.

The upper body can be held upright, recline to either side or backward, or one can lean forward.

===Yoga, traditions and spirituality===

There are many seated positions in various traditions and rituals. Four examples are:

* 正座 (zhengzuo) is a Chinese word which describes the traditional formal way of sitting in Ancient China. A related position is 跪座, which differs in the tops of the feet being raised off the ground.
* Vajrasana (Diamond Pose) is a yoga posture (asana) similar to seiza.
* The lotus position involves resting each foot on the opposite thigh so that the soles of the feet face upwards. 
* The Burmese position, named so because of its use in Buddhist sculptures in Burma, places both feet in front of the pelvis with knees bent and touching the floor to the sides. The heels are pointing toward pelvis or upward, and toes are pointed so that the tops of the feet lie on the ground. This looks similar to the cross-legged position, but the feet are not placed underneath the thigh of the next leg, therefore the legs do not cross. Instead, one foot is placed in front of the other.

In various mythologies and folk magic, sitting is a magical act that connects the person who sits with other persons, states or places.

===Kneeling chairs===
The kneeling chair (often just referred to as &quot;ergonomic chair&quot;) was designed to motivate better posture than the conventional chair. To sit in a kneeling chair, one rests one&#x27;s buttocks on the upper sloping pad and rests the front of the lower legs atop the lower pad, i.e., the human position as both sitting and kneeling at the same time.

== Health risks ==

In 1700, &quot;De Morbis Artificum Diatriba&quot; listed sitting in odd postures as a cause of diseases in &quot;chair-workers&quot;. Current studies indicate there is a significantly higher mortality rate among people who regularly sit for prolonged periods, and the risk is not negated by regular exercise, though it is lowered. The causes of mortality and morbidity include heart disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes and cancer, specifically, breast, endometrial, colorectal, lung, and epithelial ovarian cancer. The link between heart disease and diabetes mortality and sitting is well-established, but the risk of cancer mortality is unclear. Sedentary time is also associated with an increased risk of depression in children and adolescents. A correlation between occupational sitting specifically and higher body mass index has been demonstrated, but causality has not yet been established. There are several hypotheses explaining why sitting is a health risk. These include changes in cardiac output, vitamin D, inflammation, sex hormone activity, lipoprotein lipase activity, and GLUT4 activity due to long periods of muscular unloading, among others.

Sitting may occupy up to half of an adult&#x27;s workday in developed countries. Workplace programs to reduce sitting vary in method. They include sit-stand desks, counseling, workplace policy changes, walking or standing meetings, treadmill desks, breaks, therapy ball chairs, and stepping devices. Results of these programs are mixed, but there is moderate evidence to show that changes to chairs (adjusting the biomechanics of the chair or using different types of chairs) can effectively reduce musculoskeletal symptoms in workers who sit for most of their day.

Public health programs typically focus on increasing physical activity rather than reducing sitting time. One major target for these public health programs is sitting in the workplace. For example, WHO Europe recommended in September 2015 the provision of adjustable desks in the workplace. In general, there is conflicting evidence regarding the precise risks of sitting for long periods. A 2018 Cochrane review found low-quality evidence that providing employees with a standing desk option may reduce the length of time some people sit at work in the first year. This reduction in sitting may decrease with time, and there is no evidence that standing desks are effective in the long term. In addition, a 2018 &quot;British Journal of Medicine&quot; systematic review concluded that interventions aimed at reducing sitting outside of work were only modestly effective. It is not clear how standing desks compare to other work-place interventions to reduce the length of time employees are sitting during the work day.

=== Relationship between posture and health conditions ===
Though most studies even until early 21st century relate human body postures to various musculoskeletal conditions, recent researches show no potential causal relationship between postures and these conditions like back pain; other causes like sleep deprivation, stress and long-term physical inactivity or prolonged static unnatural postural stress could be significant confounders for various health conditions. However some research show that prolonged slouched position may be a cause for minor breathing disorders. Though still a large proportion of the clinical practitioners attribute absence of a neutral spine posture as one of the main causes of conditions like back pain and neck pain, the relationship is not thoroughly established. It is also thought that much of so-called &quot;poor posture&quot; is actually just postural stress and being stuck with bad ergonomics that could be causing the pain, and not really a postural problem. iHunch is an example of postural stress which could cause upper back pain and neck pain, which is prevalent in younger generations and people whose occupation involves prolonged usage of computers. The concept of &quot;good posture&quot; has led to a common misconception that sitting in one good sitting position will allay the negative effects of sitting.

=== Sedentary behaviour ===
Sedentary behaviour is any waking behaviour, whether in sitting or reclining posture, by an energy expenditure less than or equal to 1.5 metabolic equivalents of task (METs). MET, beside the watt and kilojoules, is the unit for expressing the energy cost of physical activities. One MET is defined as resting metabolic rate – as energy used with a person at rest, sitting quietly in a chair or as the amount of oxygen (O2) consumed with that person. MET for an adult weighing 70 kg equals 3.5 ml O2 per kg body weight per min.

Sedentary behaviour should be distinguished from being inactive – performing insufficient amounts of MVPA (moderate to vigorous physical activity). The World Health Organization recommends at least 60 min of daily MVPA for children and adolescents aged 5–17 years, and 150 min of weekly MVPA for adults.

Sedentary behaviour can not be equated with screen time, although some researchers found out that a large share of waking time by children and adolescents in a sedentary position is accumulated by media consumption in front of a screen.

<doc id="161268" wikidata="Q941979" url="?curid=161268" title="Sakanoue no Tamuramaro">
<text>was a court noble, general and &quot;shōgun&quot; of the early Heian period of Japan. He served as Dainagon, Minister of War and &quot;Ukon&#x27;e no Taisho&quot; (Major Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards). He held the &quot;kabane&quot; of Ōsukune and the court rank of Junior Second Rank and was awarded the Order of Second Class. 

He was the son of Sakanoue no Karitamaro. He was considered an avatar of Bishamonten in legend.

==Military career==
Serving Emperor Kanmu, Tamuramaro was appointed &quot;shōgun&quot; and given the task of conquering the Emishi (蝦夷征伐 &quot;Emishi Seibatsu&quot;), a people native to the north of Honshū, which he subjugated. Recent evidence suggests that a migration of Emishi from northern Honshū to Hokkaidō took place sometime between the seventh and eighth centuries, perhaps as a direct result of this policy that pre-dated Tamuramaro&#x27;s appointment. However, many Emishi remained in the Tōhoku region as subjects of the expanding Japanese Empire and later established independent Fushu domains. After Emperor Kanmu&#x27;s death, the general continued to serve Emperor Heizei and Emperor Saga as 
 and . 
He was the second person to be given the title of &quot;Sei-i Taishōgun&quot; (征夷大将軍). The first to receive this title was Ōtomo no Otomaro.
 
It is said that the famous Tanabata festivals and parades of Aomori Prefecture (also celebrated in the city of Sendai in Miyagi prefecture), which draw over 3 million people to the prefecture a year, were popularised in remembrance of Sakanoue no Tamuramaro&#x27;s campaign to subdue the tribal societies then living in Tōhoku. These annual &quot;matsuri&quot; are called the &quot;Nebuta&quot; festival in Aomori City and &quot;Neputa&quot; Festival () in Hirosaki City. They feature a number of gigantic, specially-constructed, illuminated paper floats. These huge festival structures are colourfully painted with mythical figures, and teams of men carry them through the streets as crowds shout encouragement. Aomori&#x27;s great nebuta lanterns are said to hark back to Tamuramaro&#x27;s innovative strategy in that early ninth century campaign. According to legend, the taishogun is remembered for having ordered huge illuminated lanterns to be placed at the top of hills; and when the curious Emishi approached these bright lights to investigate, they were captured and subdued. Until the mid-1990s the prize awarded for the best float of the parades was called the Tamuramaro Prize. However, there is no historical record that Tamuramaro went farther north than Iwate Prefecture.

Tamuramaro&#x27;s name is linked with payments for construction projects at Kiyomizu Temple (&quot;Kiyomizu-dera&quot;) in the late 8th century.

The Azuma Kagami tells a story of when Fujiwara no Toshihito had fought together with Sakanoue no Tamuramaro to subdue a gang of Emishi bandits that had stood in their way when the duo were passing through the Taya Caves on their way back to Kamakura.

==Death, memorial and legends==

In the year 811 (&quot;Kōnin 2, 3rd month&quot;), Tamuramaro died at age 54, to the great regret of Emperor Saga, who expressed his sense of loss by distributing large quantities of silk cloth, cotton cloth and rice in honour of his dead counsellor. His bow, arrows, quiver and sword were placed in his coffin by order of the Emperor.

The Tomb of Sakanoue no Tamuramaro is located in Kanshuji Higashikurisunocho, Yamashina Ward, Kyoto, Japan. He is not the samurai buried at Shōgun-zuka as that was a ceremonial statue of a warrior buried by Emperor Kanmu when he decided to move the capital to Heian-kyo, present day Kyoto. His descendant Urabe no Suetake inherited his bow. 

After his death, Tamuramaro became a legendary figure featured in many stories. In these legends, Tamuramaro is not always a warrior who wages war against barbarians, but a hero who exterminates &quot;oni&quot; and bandits in various areas. According to legend, Ootakemaru, one of the Great Three Evil Yokai of Japan, was slain by Tamuramaro. Other stories connect him to Suzuka Gozen, whom he marries and/or slays. He had a daughter with her named Shourin. According to the Otogi-zoshi, Shourin is said to have become the guardian deity of the Suzuka Mountains, while in the Okujoruri, it is said she ascended to the level of the Jizō Bodhisattva after her death.

==Ancestry==
According to the &quot;Shoku Nihongi&quot;, an official historical record, the Sakanoue clan is descended from Emperor Ling of the Chinese Han dynasty. The Sakanoue clan&#x27;s family tree shows that Tamuramaro is a 14th-generation descendant of Emperor Ling. 
Other research traces the origins of the Sakanoue clan from the Asian mainland, possibly through Baekje.

The lack of extensive detail on Sakanoue no Tamuramaro’s life has led to a number of theories regarding aspects of his life, such as his birthplace, among others: 
* 
* That he was of 
* That he was 
* Racial identity of Sakanoue no Tamuramaro (African origin)

==Honours==
*Senior second rank (May 27, 811; posthumous)

**official rank at the time of death:Senior Third Rank, Senior Counselor, Major Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards(正三位, 大納言, 右近衛大将)

<text>Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang: The Magical Car is a children&#x27;s story written by Ian Fleming and illustrated by John Burningham. It was initially published in three volumes, the first of which was released on 22 October 1964 by Jonathan Cape, before being published as one book. The story concerns the exploits of Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang—a car with hidden powers and abilities—and its owners, the Pott family.

Fleming, better known as the creator of James Bond, took his inspiration for the subject from a series of aero-engined racing cars called &quot;Chitty Bang Bang&quot;, built by Louis Zborowski in the early 1920s. Fleming wrote the book while convalescing after a major heart attack; he had created the story as a bedtime story for his son, Caspar. Although Fleming wanted &quot;The Daily Mail&quot; cartoonist Trog—the pseudonym of Wally Fawkes—as the book&#x27;s illustrator, the newspaper did not allow him to work on the project, so Burningham was commissioned. Fleming did not live to see &quot;Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang&quot; published; he died of a heart attack on 11 August 1964 and the book was published two months later.

&quot;Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang&quot; was serialised in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; and adapted as a comic strip. The book was loosely adapted as a 1968 film of the same name with a screenplay by Roald Dahl and Ken Hughes; a subsequent novelisation was also published. The film was produced by Albert R. Broccoli, the co-producer of the &quot;James Bond&quot; film series. The story was also adapted as a stage musical under the same name. In April 2011 a BBC Radio 4 Extra adaptation was broadcast with Imogen Stubbs as the voice of Chitty. Three sequels to Fleming&#x27;s book have been published, all written by Frank Cottrell-Boyce.

==Plot==
Caractacus Pott, a former commander in the Royal Navy, invents sweets that can also be used as whistles, and sells the idea to Lord Skrumshus, the wealthy owner of a local confectionery factory. Pott uses the money to buy and renovate an old car, a &quot;Paragon Panther&quot;—the sole production of the Paragon motor-car company before it went bankrupt. It is a four-seat touring car with an enormous bonnet. After the restoration is complete, the car is named for the noises made by its starter motor and the characteristic two loud backfires it makes when it starts.

At first, Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang is just a big and powerful car, but as the book progresses it surprises Pott&#x27;s family by beginning to exhibit independent actions. This first happens while the family is caught in a traffic jam on their way to the beach for a picnic. The car suddenly instructs Commander Pott to pull a switch which causes Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang to sprout wings and take flight over the stopped cars on the road. Commander Pott flies them to Goodwin Sands in the English Channel where the family picnics, swims and sleeps. While the family naps, the tide comes in and threatens to drown them. Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang wakes them just in time with a hiss of steam. At the car&#x27;s direction, Commander Pott pulls another switch, which causes it to transform into a hovercraft-like vehicle. They make for the French coast and land on a beach near Calais. Exploring along the beach, they find a cave boobytrapped with some devices intended to scare off intruders. At the back of the cave is a store of armaments and explosives. The family detonates the cache of explosives and flees the cave.

The gang of gun-runners who own the ammunition dump arrive and block the road in front of Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang. The gangsters threaten the family, but Commander Pott throws the switch, which transforms the car into an aeroplane. They take off, leaving the gangsters in helpless fury. The Potts stay overnight in a hotel in Calais. While the family sleeps, the gangsters break into the children&#x27;s room and kidnap them and drive off towards Paris. Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang tracks the gangsters&#x27; route, wakes Commander and Mrs Pott, and they drive off in pursuit.

The gangsters are planning to rob a famous chocolate shop in Paris using the children as decoys. The Pott children overhear this and manage to warn the shop owner, Monsieur Bon-Bon. Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang arrives in time to prevent the gangsters from fleeing. The police arrive and the gangsters are taken away. As a reward, Madame Bon-Bon shares the secret recipe of her fudge with the Potts, and the two families become good friends. Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang flies the family away to parts unknown, and the book implies that the car has yet more secrets.

==Background and writing history==
By March 1961 Ian Fleming had written nine books at the rate of one a year: eight novels and a collection of short stories, all featuring the character James Bond. The most recent of these was &quot;Thunderball&quot;, a novel Fleming wrote in early 1960. It was based on the screenplay he wrote with the screenwriter Jack Whittingham and the writer and director, Kevin McClory. Legal difficulties before publication led to a hearing at the High Court in London on 24 March 1961, putting great strain on Fleming. Two weeks after the case, during the weekly Tuesday staff conference at his employers, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, Fleming suffered a major heart attack.

The attack was severe enough to necessitate hospitalisation, after which Fleming convalesced at the Dudley Hotel in Hove. While he was recuperating, one of his friends—probably Sir George Duff-Sutherland-Dunbar, according to Fleming&#x27;s biographer Andrew Lycett—gave him a copy of Beatrix Potter&#x27;s &quot;The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin&quot; to read, and suggested Fleming write up the bedtime story he used to tell his son Caspar each evening. Fleming disliked the book, but enjoyed the illustrations. He had been forbidden access to a typewriter, in case the strain of writing a new Bond novel was too much for him, and he asked for a pen and paper and wrote the story by hand. He attacked the project with gusto and wrote to his publisher, Michael Howard of Jonathan Cape, joking that &quot;There is not a moment, even on the edge of the tomb, when I am not slaving for you&quot;. Just over a month after his heart attack he sent Howard the drafts of the first two stories. The working title for the book was &quot;The Magical Car&quot;, which may have been in place until about six months before it was published. Fleming considered the idea of publishing the book under the pseudonym &quot;Ian Lancaster&quot; (his first two names), but Howard counselled against it and he agreed.

Fleming did not live to see &quot;Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang&quot; published; he suffered a further heart attack on 11 August 1964 and died in the early morning of the following day—his son Caspar&#x27;s twelfth birthday—in Canterbury, Kent. The book was published two months after his death.

==Inspirations==

As he wrote &quot;Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang&quot;, Fleming used aspects of his life to flesh out the details, much as he did with many of his Bond stories. Thus, in the book, one of the children was called Jemima, after the daughter of his previous employer, Hugo Pitman. The advice Pott gave to his children—&quot;Never say &#x27;no&#x27; to adventure. Always say &#x27;yes&#x27;, otherwise you&#x27;ll lead a very dull life&quot;—is an echo of Fleming&#x27;s outlook. Pott&#x27;s naval rank was commander, which was also that held by Fleming during the Second World War; Fleming used the rank for James Bond and James Gunn, an unrealised television series he wrote in 1956.

The car Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang was based on a composite of two vehicles: Fleming&#x27;s own Standard Tourer, which he had driven in Switzerland in the late 1920s, and Chitty Bang Bang, a chain-driven customised Mercedes with an bonnet and a twenty-three-litre, six-cylinder aero-engine from Maybach. The engine was of the type used on First World War Zeppelins. Fleming had seen the car&#x27;s owner, Louis Zborowski, race at the Brooklands race track. The origin of the name &quot;Chitty Bang Bang&quot; is disputed, but may have been inspired by early aeronautical engineer Letitia Chitty. An obscene song from the First World War may also be connected to the name; this referred to the &quot;chits&quot;, or passes, given to officers to visit the bordellos of Paris. The bibliographer Jon Gilbert suggests that when Fleming was at Eton, there were two brothers called Chitty, the sons of one of the schoolmasters, the Reverend George Jameson Chitty, and it is possible that they are the origin of the name. Fleming had a long-held passion for cars, owning several over his life and reading avidly on the subject. The sound a car made was &quot;almost as important as the appearance&quot; to Fleming, according to Henry Chancellor, who has written for Ian Fleming Publications.

==Illustrations==

When Fleming sent his publisher the manuscripts for the first two volumes of &quot;Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang&quot; in May 1961, he suggested &quot;The Daily Mail&quot; cartoonist Trog—the pseudonym of Wally Fawkes—as the book&#x27;s illustrator. Fleming was an admirer of Trog&#x27;s work and considered him a friend, describing him as &quot;an extremely nice man and great fun&quot;. Although Trog completed preliminary drawings for the project, &quot;The Daily Mail&quot; refused to allow him to complete the work as many of Fleming&#x27;s works were serialised in its rival, the &quot;Daily Express&quot;. While undertaking his preliminary drawings, Trog tried to make the fudge recipe included in the book and found it was not particularly good: the editors at Jonathan Cape spent a day making up batches from different recipes to find a better one to use. 

Cape then asked the illustrator Haro Hodson if he would like to work on the book. He produced some trial sketches, but Fleming rejected them as not being suitable. Fleming asked his friend Amherst Villiers if he would be able to come up with a design for the car which was &quot;really snazzy looking to excite the imagination of children about 7–10&quot;. He explained that the publishers &quot;have got one or two artists lined up for the figures, landscapes, etc, they can&#x27;t find anybody with enough technical know-how and imagination to draw a suitable Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang&quot;. Villiers was an engineer and engine designer who had provided Fleming with the technical details he used for Bond&#x27;s cars in the novels; he also painted Fleming&#x27;s portrait in 1962. According to Fleming&#x27;s biographer, Andrew Lycett, Villiers&#x27;s sketch was of &quot;a low green rakish car, which looked like an SSK Mercedes with a round Delauney Belleville radiator&quot;.

Cape then commissioned John Burningham, who had recently won the 1963 Kate Greenaway Medal for his book &quot;&quot;. Burningham followed Fleming&#x27;s instructions carefully and, although Villiers&#x27;s drawings were not used, Burningham&#x27;s illustrations of the car &quot;bear a striking resemblance to Amherst&#x27;s coloured drawings&quot;, according to Paul Kenny, Villiers&#x27;s biographer.

==Release and reception==
===Publication history===
&quot;Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang: The Magical Car&quot; was first published in the UK in three hard-backed volumes by Jonathan Cape, each costing 10s 6d. The first volume was launched on 22 October 1964, the second on 26 November 1964 and the third on 14 January 1965. Each volume was 48 pages. In July 1968 the three volumes were released in one single 123-page volume by Pan Books under the name &quot;Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang: The Complete Adventures of the Magical Car&quot;. Later editions and paperback versions used only the shortened name &quot;Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang&quot;. Since its initial publication the book has been re-issued in hardback and paperback editions and, , has never been out of print.

The book was published in the US in 1964 by Random House. Rather than publishing in three volumes, the stories were produced in one volume, which meant American readers were able to read the third part of the story before British readers. In May 1965, &quot;Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang&quot; was third in &quot;The New York Times&quot; list of best-selling books for children; by November that year, it was second.

===Critical reception===
Alexander Muir, in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, considered that the first two volumes of &quot;Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang&quot; would be excellent Christmas presents for younger readers, although John Rowe Townsend, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, suggested that a father, rather than the child, would be a better recipient of the present. The unnamed reviewer for &quot;The Birmingham Post&quot; thought the book would be enjoyed by both the children and their parents.

Both Oscar Turnill, writing for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, and Townsend described Fleming&#x27;s writing as avuncular, although Townsend was being critical, saying that &quot;we have the adult writer at play rather than the children&#x27;s writer at work. The style is avuncular, the writing down too evident.&quot; Turnill, however, praised the good-humoured nature of Fleming&#x27;s storytelling. &quot;The Birmingham Post&quot; commended Fleming&#x27;s writing, stating he &quot;proves himself already an accomplished, unpatronising story-teller for ... the 5–12-year-olds&quot;.

Turnill thought the writer &quot;was right in judging the children&#x27;s market ripe for the ... cliff-hanger&quot;; Muir also praised the &quot;thrilling cliff-hanger&quot; nature of the book. The reviewer for &quot;The Times&quot; drew parallels with Fleming&#x27;s other work, and noted that the book would be an excellent choice for younger readers before they started on a Bond novel. The author Richard Usborne, writing for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, also reviewed &quot;Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang&quot; in the light of the &quot;James Bond&quot; novels, and wrote:

These CCBB stories are highly professional in the field of children&#x27;s books. The odd items of information, the super wicked villains, the hairsbreadth escapes, the happy family security, the magic, the happy endings, with the comforting assurance that family and car will soon be in mortal danger again. That&#x27;s the stuff to give the infantry!

==Adaptations==

&quot;Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang&quot; was serialised in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; newspaper in five episodes over the course of a week, from 19 to 23 October 1964. In 1969 a strip cartoon version was issued in the UK under the title &quot;Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang: Authorised Edition&quot;. 

A film loosely based on the book was made in 1968, with a screenplay written by Roald Dahl and Ken Hughes; Hughes also directed. It was produced by Albert R. &quot;Cubby&quot; Broccoli, who had made five James Bond films to that point. A novelisation of the film was published by Pan Books in 1968, written by the author John Burke.

In April 2002 &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;, a stage musical based on the film, opened at the London Palladium theatre, starring Michael Ball. It closed in September 2005. It was the longest-running show ever at the London Palladium, taking over £70 million in its three-and-a-half-year run. A Broadway version ran at the Hilton Theatre, New York, between March and December 2005, with 34 previews and 285 regular performances.

A one-hour adaptation of the story by Sherry Ashworth was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra on 3 April 2011, starring Imogen Stubbs as the voice of Chitty and Alex Jennings as Caractacus Pott. 

Three sequels to the book have been written by Frank Cottrell-Boyce. The first—&quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Flies Again&quot;—was published in October 2011. The second, &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and the Race Against Time&quot;, was released in September 2012. A third sequel, &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Over the Moon&quot;, was released in September 2013.

<text>Priorat () is a comarca (county) in Camp de Tarragona, Catalonia, Spain. The region is named due to the monastery of Scala Dei which held many properties and the capital is now the town of Falset.

==Economy==

The central part of the comarca, &quot;Priorat històric&quot;, produces the highly regarded wines that are certified under the DOQ Priorat. Wines from elsewhere in the comarca are certified as DO Montsant although this region also has a small segment of the neighboring comarca, Ribera d&#x27;Ebre. However, galena mining was the main activity since prehistoric times until 1972, when the last galena mine closed.

The other main agricultural activity is the production of olives and olive oil, the latter of which is certified under DOP Siurana. Historically there was greater production of hazelnuts and almonds but these activities have become mostly for personal use. In late 1800s, a devastating attack of the insect phylloxera destroyed vines and mining kept activities and around twenty mines opened at that time.

Priorat saw a steady loss of population throughout the 20th century due to a number of external factors such as the Spanish Civil War and the rise of coastal tourism. In 2004, with a more prosperous economy there was an overall increase in population that peaked in 2010 and has since been decreasing again each year. In 2001, the population was 9,196, with only the capital exceeding a population of 1,000 and while it has over 2,800 residents as of 2017, the comarca overall has reduced to 9,345 from a high of 10,145 making it the 3rd least populated comarca in all of Catalonia.

== Physical geography ==

Priorat has an area of 496 km2 and is bordered by the River Ebro, and by the comarques of Ribera d&#x27;Ebre, Baix Camp, les Garrigues, and Conca de Barberà. The region is mostly hilly, and in the extreme north of the comarca is the Montsant mountain range, rising to over 1000 m; the south is bordered by the Mola de Colldejou and the mountain ranges of Serra de Llaberia and Serra de Santa Marina.

The climate is continental: dry and hot in summer, cold in the winter.

<text>Terra Alta () is a sparsely populated inland comarca (county) in Terres de l&#x27;Ebre, Catalonia (Spain). Its capital is Gandesa. It is also known as Castellania, a name dating back to its medieval status as a fiefdom held by the Order of Knights of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem under the Crown of Aragon.

<text>William Wilkie Collins (8 January 1824 – 23 September 1889) was an English novelist and playwright known especially for &quot;The Woman in White&quot; (1860), a mystery novel and early sensation novel, and for &quot;The Moonstone&quot; (1868), which established many of the ground rules of the modern detective novel and is also perhaps the earliest clear example of the police procedural genre.

Born to the London painter William Collins and his wife, Harriet Geddes, he moved with them to Italy when he was twelve, living there and in France for two years, learning both Italian and French. He worked initially as a tea merchant. After &quot;Antonina&quot;, his first novel, was published in 1850, Collins met Charles Dickens, who became his friend and mentor. Some of Collins&#x27; work appeared in Dickens&#x27; journals &quot;Household Words&quot; and &quot;All the Year Round&quot;. They also collaborated on drama and fiction. Collins gained financial stability and an international following by the 1860s. In the 1870s and 1880s, after becoming addicted to the opium which he took for his gout, the quality of his health declined and, in turn, the reception of his artistic output.

Collins criticised the institution of marriage. He had relationships with two women: widow Caroline Graves – living with her for most of his life, treating her daughter as his – and the younger Martha Rudd, with whom he had three children.

==Early life==

Collins was born at 11 New Cavendish Street, London, the son of William Collins, a well-known Royal Academician landscape painter, and his wife, Harriet Geddes. Named after his father, he soon became known by his middle name, which honoured his godfather, the painter David Wilkie. The family moved to Pond Street, Hampstead, in 1826. In 1828 Collins&#x27;s brother Charles Allston Collins was born. Between 1829 and 1830, the Collins family moved twice, first to Hampstead Square and then to Porchester Terrace, Bayswater. Wilkie and Charles received their early education from their mother at home. The Collins family were deeply religious, and Collins&#x27;s mother enforced strict church attendance on her sons, which Wilkie disliked.

In 1835, Collins began attending school at the Maida Vale academy. From 1836 to 1838, he lived with his parents in Italy and France, which made a great impression on him. He learned Italian while in Italy and began learning French, in which he would eventually become fluent. From 1838 to 1840, he attended the Reverend Cole&#x27;s private boarding school in Highbury, where he was bullied. One boy forced Collins to tell him a story every night before allowing him to go to sleep. &quot;It was this brute who first awakened in me, his poor little victim, a power of which but for him I might never have been aware... When I left school I continued story telling for my own pleasure,&quot; Collins later said.

In 1840 the family moved to 85 Oxford Terrace, Bayswater. In late 1840, Collins left school at the age of nearly 17 and was apprenticed as a clerk to the firm of tea merchants Antrobus &amp; Co, owned by a friend of Wilkie&#x27;s father. He disliked clerical work, but worked for the company for more than five years. 

Collins started writing and published his first story, &quot;The Last Stage Coachman&quot;, in the &quot;Illuminated Magazine&quot; in August 1843. In 1844 he travelled to Paris with Charles Ward. That same year he wrote his first novel, &quot;Iolani, or Tahiti as It Was; a Romance&quot;, which was submitted to Chapman and Hall but rejected in 1845. The novel remained unpublished during his lifetime. Collins said of it: &quot;My youthful imagination ran riot among the noble savages, in scenes which caused the respectable British publisher to declare that it was impossible to put his name on the title page of such a novel.&quot; While Collins was writing this novel, his father first learned that his son would not follow him in becoming a painter.

William Collins had intended his first son to become a clergyman and was disappointed in Wilkie&#x27;s lack of interest in the profession. At his father&#x27;s insistence, Collins instead entered Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1846, to study law; his father wanted him to have a steady income. Collins showed only a slight interest in law and spent most of his time with friends and on working on a second novel, &quot;Antonina, or the Fall of Rome&quot;. After his father&#x27;s death in 1847, Collins produced his first published book, &quot;Memoirs of the Life of William Collins, Esq., R. A.&quot;, published in 1848. 

The family moved to 38 Blandford Square soon afterwards, where they used their drawing room for amateur theatricals. In 1849, Collins exhibited a painting, &quot;The Smugglers&#x27; Retreat&quot;, at the Royal Academy summer exhibition. &quot;Antonina&quot; was published by Richard Bentley in February 1850. Collins went on a walking tour of Cornwall with artist Henry Brandling in July and August 1850. He managed to complete his legal studies and was called to the bar in 1851. Though he never formally practised, he used his legal knowledge in many of his novels.

==Early writing career==
An instrumental event in his career was an introduction in March 1851 to Charles Dickens by a mutual friend, the painter Augustus Egg. They became lifelong friends and collaborators. In May of that year, Collins acted with Dickens in Edward Bulwer-Lytton&#x27;s play &quot;Not So Bad As We Seem&quot;. Among the audience were Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. Collins&#x27;s story &quot;A Terribly Strange Bed&quot;, his first contribution to Dickens&#x27;s journal &quot;Household Words&quot;, was published in April 1852. In May 1852 he went on tour with Dickens&#x27;s company of amateur actors, again performing &quot;Not So Bad As We Seem&quot;, but with a more substantial role. 

Collins&#x27;s novel &quot;Basil&quot; was published by Bentley in November. During the writing of &quot;Hide and Seek&quot;, in early 1853, Collins suffered what was probably his first attack of gout, a condition from which he would suffer for the rest of his life. He was ill from April to early July. After that he stayed with Dickens in Boulogne from July to September 1853, then toured Switzerland and Italy with Dickens and Egg from October to December. Collins published &quot;Hide and Seek&quot; in June 1854.

During this period Collins extended the variety of his writing, publishing articles in George Henry Lewes&#x27;s paper &quot;The Leader,&quot; short stories and essays for &quot;Bentley&#x27;s Miscellany,&quot; as well as dramatic criticism and the travel book &quot;Rambles Beyond Railways.&quot; (1851) His first play, &quot;The Lighthouse&quot;, was performed by Dickens&#x27;s theatrical company at Tavistock House, in 1855. His first collection of short stories, &quot;After Dark&quot;, was published by Smith, Elder in February 1856. His novel &quot;A Rogue&#x27;s Life&quot; was serialised in &quot;Household Words&quot; in March 1856. Around then, Collins began using laudanum regularly to treat his gout. He became addicted and struggled with that problem later in life.

Collins joined the staff of &quot;Household Words&quot; in October 1856. In 1856–57 he collaborated closely with Dickens on a play, &quot;The Frozen Deep&quot;, first performed in Tavistock. Collins&#x27;s novel &quot;The Dead Secret&quot; was serialised in &quot;Household Words&quot; from January to June 1857, before being published in volume form by Bradbury and Evans. Collins&#x27;s play &quot;The Lighthouse&quot; was performed at the Olympic Theatre in August. His account, &quot;The Lazy Tour of Two Idle Apprentices,&quot; based on Dickens&#x27;s and Collins&#x27;s walking tour in the north of England, was serialised in &quot;Household Words&quot; in October 1857. In 1858 Collins collaborated with Dickens and other writers on the story &quot;A House to Let&quot;.

==1860s==
According to Collins&#x27;s biographer Melisa Klimaszewski, 
The novels Collins published in the 1860s are the best and most enduring of his career. &quot;The Woman in White&quot;, &quot;No Name&quot;, &quot;Armadale&quot;, and &quot;The Moonstone&quot;, written in less than a decade, show Collins not just as a master of his craft, but as an innovater and provocateur. These four works, which secured him an international reputation, and sold in large numbers, ensured his financial stability, and allowed him to support many others.

&quot;The Woman in White&quot; was serialised in &quot;All the Year Round&quot; from November 1859 to August 1860 to great success. The novel was published in book form soon after and reached an eighth edition by November 1860. His rising success as a writer allowed Collins to resign his post with &quot;All the Year Round&quot; in 1862 and focus on his novels. While planning his next novel, &quot;No Name&quot;, he continued to suffer from gout, which began to affect his eyes. Serial publication of &quot;No Name&quot; began in early 1862 and finished in 1863. By that time Collins was having difficulty controlling the amount of laudanum he was taking for his continual gout and became addicted.

At the beginning of 1863, he travelled with Caroline Graves to German spas and Italy for his health. In 1864, he began work on his novel &quot;Armadale&quot;, travelling in August to the Norfolk Broads and the village of Winterton-on-Sea to do research for it. It was published serially in &quot;The Cornhill Magazine&quot; in 1864–1866.

His play &quot;No Thoroughfare&quot;, co-written with Dickens, was published as the 1867 Christmas number of &quot;All the Year Round&quot; and dramatised at the Adelphi Theatre in the West End on 26 December. It enjoyed a run of 200 nights before being taken on tour. &quot;The Moonstone&quot; was serialised in &quot;All the Year Round&quot; from January to August 1868. His mother, Harriet Collins, died in that year.

==Later years==

In 1870, Collins&#x27; novel &quot;Man and Wife&quot; was published. That year Charles Dickens died, which caused him great sadness. He said of the friends&#x27; early days together, &quot;We saw each other every day, and were as fond of each other as men could be.&quot;

&quot;The Woman in White&quot; was dramatised and produced at the Olympic Theatre in October 1871. Collins&#x27;s novel &quot;Poor Miss Finch&quot; was serialised in &quot;Cassell&#x27;s Magazine&quot; from October to March 1872. His short novel &quot;Miss or Mrs.?&quot; was published in the 1871 Christmas number of the &quot;Graphic&quot;. His novel &quot;The New Magdalen&quot; was serialised from October 1872 to July 1873. His younger brother, Charles Allston Collins, died later in 1873 at the age of 45. Charles had married Dickens&#x27;s younger daughter, Kate.
In 1873–74, Collins toured the United States and Canada, giving readings of his work. The American writers he met included Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., and Mark Twain. He began a friendship with photographer Napoleon Sarony, who took several portraits of him.

His novel &quot;The Law and the Lady&quot;, serialised in the &quot;Graphic&quot; from September to March 1875, was followed by a short novel, &quot;The Haunted Hotel&quot;, which was serialised from June to November 1878. His later novels include &quot;Jezebel&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1880), &quot;The Black Robe&quot; (1881), &quot;Heart and Science&quot; (1883), and &quot;The Evil Genius&quot; (1886). In 1884, Collins was elected vice-president of the Society of Authors, which had been founded by his friend and fellow novelist Walter Besant.

The inconsistent quality of Collins&#x27;s dramatic and fictional works in the last decade of his life was accompanied by a general decline in his health, including diminished eyesight. He was often unable to leave home and had difficulty writing. During these last years, he focused on mentoring younger writers, including the novelist Hall Caine. He also used his legal background to help protect other writers from copyright infringement of their works. His writing became a way for him to fight his illness without allowing it to keep him bedridden. His step-daughter Harriet also served as an amanuensis for several years. His last novel, &quot;Blind Love&quot;, was finished posthumously by Walter Besant.

==Death==

Collins died on 23 September 1889, at 65 Wimpole Street, following a paralytic stroke. He is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, West London. His headstone describes him as the author of &quot;The Woman in White&quot;. Caroline Graves died in 1895 and was buried with Collins. Martha Rudd died in 1919.

==Personal life==
In 1858 Collins began living with Caroline Graves and her daughter Harriet. Caroline came from a humble family, having married young, had a child, and been widowed. Collins lived close to the small shop kept by Caroline, and the two may have met in the neighbourhood in the mid–1850s. He treated Harriet, whom he called Carrie, as his own daughter, and helped to provide for her education. Excepting one short separation, they lived together for the rest of Collins&#x27;s life. Collins disliked the institution of marriage, but remained dedicated to Caroline and Harriet, considering them to be his family. 

Caroline had wanted to marry Collins. She left him while he wrote &quot;The Moonstone&quot; when he was suffering an attack of acute gout. She married a younger man named Joseph Clow, but after two years, she returned to Collins.

In 1868, Collins met Martha Rudd in Winterton-on-Sea in Norfolk, and the two began a liaison. She was 19 years old and from a large, poor family. A few years later, she moved to London to be closer to him. Their daughter Marian was born in 1869; their second daughter, Harriet Constance, in 1871; and their son, William Charles, in 1874. When he was with Martha, Collins assumed the name William Dawson, and she and their children used the last name of Dawson themselves.

For the last 20 years of his life Collins divided his time between Caroline, who lived with him at his home in Gloucester Place, and Martha, who was nearby. 

Collins was a professing Christian.

==Works==

Collins&#x27;s works were classified at the time as sensation novels, a genre that became the precursor to detective and suspense fiction. He also wrote penetratingly on the plight of women and on the social and domestic issues of his time. For example, his 1854 &quot;Hide and Seek&quot; contained one of the first portrayals of a deaf character in English literature. As did many writers of his time, Collins first published most of his novels as serials in magazines such as Dickens&#x27;s &quot;All the Year Round&quot;, and was known as a master of the form, creating just the right degree of suspense to keep his audience reading from week to week.

&quot;The Lighthouse&quot; was a melodrama loosely based on Collins&#x27;s 1853 short story, &quot;Gabriel&#x27;s Marriage&quot;, but set in Eddystone Lighthouse in December 1748. In May 1855, Collins sent the finished play to Dickens, who enthusiastically took over the production. Dickens played Aaron Gurnock, the head lightkeeper, and arranged for Clarkson Stanfield to paint the backdrop. Other parts were taken by Collins, Augustus Egg, Mark Lemon, Mary Dickens and Georgina Hogarth. The production ran for four nights at Tavistock House, from 16 June 1855, followed by a single performance on 10 July at Campden House, Kensington. It was staged at the Royal Olympic Theatre from 10 August to 17 October 1857, as Collins&#x27;s first professional production. Robson played Aaron Gurnock and George Vining read the Prologue. An American version opened at the New Theatre, New York, on 21 January 1858. There was an amateur production with Palgrave Simpson on 3 May 1865 at the Royal Bijou Theatre (Lambeth School of Art) and further revivals at Shelley&#x27;s Boscombe Theatre in the 1870s and 1880s. &quot;The Lighthouse&quot; was translated into French by Emile Forgues.

Collins enjoyed ten years of success after publishing &quot;The Woman in White&quot; in 1859. His next novel, &quot;No Name&quot; combined social commentary – the absurdity of the law as applied to children of unmarried parents (see Illegitimacy in fiction) – with a densely plotted revenge thriller. &quot;Armadale,&quot; the first and only one of Collins&#x27;s major novels of the 1860s to be serialised in a magazine other than &quot;All the Year Round,&quot; provoked strong criticism. Reviewers found its villainess Lydia Gwilt to be doubtful, and were further provoked by Collins&#x27;s typically confrontational preface. The novel was simultaneously a financial coup for its author and a comparative commercial failure: the sum paid by &quot;Cornhill&quot; for the serialisation rights was exceptional, eclipsing by a substantial margin the prices paid for the vast majority of similar novels, yet the novel failed to recoup its publisher&#x27;s investment. 

&quot;The Moonstone,&quot; published in 1868, and the last novel of what is generally regarded as the most successful decade of Collins&#x27; author&#x27;s career, was, despite a somewhat cool reception from both Dickens and the critics, a significant return to form. It re-established the market value of an author whose success on the competitive Victorian literary market had been waning in the wake of his first perceived masterpiece. Viewed by many as the advent of the detective story within the tradition of the English novel, &quot;The Moonstone&quot; remains one of Collins&#x27;s most acclaimed works. It was described later by T. S. Eliot as &quot;the first, the longest, and the best of modern English detective novels... in a genre invented by Collins and not by Poe.&quot; The noted mystery writer Dorothy L. Sayers later referred to it as &quot;probably the very finest detective story ever written&quot;.

After &quot;The Moonstone,&quot; Collins&#x27;s novels contained fewer thriller elements and more social commentary. The subject matter continued to be sensational, but his popularity declined. The poet Algernon Charles Swinburne commented: &quot;What brought good Wilkie&#x27;s genius nigh perdition? / Some demon whispered—&#x27;Wilkie! have a mission.&quot; Factors most often cited in Collins&#x27;s decline have been the death of Dickens in 1870 and with it the loss of his literary mentoring, Collins&#x27;s increased dependence upon laudanum, and his penchant for using his fiction to rail against social injustices. 

&quot;The Woman in White&quot; and &quot;The Moonstone&quot; share an unusual narrative structure, somewhat resembling an epistolary novel, in which different portions of the book have different narrators, each with a distinct narrative voice. &quot;Armadale&quot; has this to a lesser extent through the correspondence between some characters.

<doc id="161277" wikidata="Q19003" url="?curid=161277" title="London Calling">
<text>London Calling is the third studio album by the English rock band the Clash. It was originally released as a double album in the United Kingdom on 14 December 1979 by CBS Records, and in the United States in January 1980 by Epic Records.

The Clash recorded the album with producer Guy Stevens at Wessex Sound Studios in London over a five- to six-week period starting in August 1979, following a change in management and a period of writer&#x27;s block for songwriters Joe Strummer and Mick Jones. Bridging a traditional punk rock sound and a new wave aesthetic, &quot;London Calling&quot; reflects the band&#x27;s growing interest in styles beyond their punk roots, including reggae, rockabilly, ska, New Orleans R&amp;B, pop, lounge jazz, and hard rock. Lyrical themes include social displacement, unemployment, racial conflict, drug use, and the responsibilities of adulthood.

The album was a top ten chart success in the UK, and its lead single &quot;London Calling&quot; was a top 20 single. The album has sold over five million copies worldwide, and was certified platinum in the US for sales of one million. It was also met with widespread critical acclaim and has retrospectively been named one of the greatest albums of all time. On &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, &quot;London Calling&quot; was ranked number 8 in the 2003 and 2012 editions, and number 16 in the 2020 edition. In 2010, it was one of ten classic album covers from British artists commemorated on a UK postage stamp issued by the Royal Mail.

==Background==
On their second album &quot;Give &#x27;Em Enough Rope&quot; (1978), the Clash had started to depart from the punk rock sound. While touring the United States in 1979, they chose supporting acts such as rhythm and blues artists Bo Diddley, Sam &amp; Dave, Lee Dorsey, and Screamin&#x27; Jay Hawkins, as well as neotraditional country artist Joe Ely and punk rockabilly band the Cramps. The Clash&#x27;s growing fascination with rock and roll inspired their direction for &quot;London Calling&quot;.

After recording &quot;Give &#x27;Em Enough Rope&quot;, the Clash separated from their manager Bernard Rhodes. This meant they had to leave their rehearsal studio in Camden Town. Tour manager Johnny Green and drum roadie Baker found a new place to rehearse, Vanilla Studios, in the back of a garage in Pimlico.

The Clash arrived at Vanilla in May 1979 with no new songs prepared for their third album. Main songwriters Mick Jones and Joe Strummer had experienced a period of writer&#x27;s block and had not written a new song in over a year; their recently released &quot;Cost of Living&quot; EP featured a cover song and three other songs that had all been written over a year earlier.

== Rehearsals ==
Rehearsal were held in Vanilla Studios over mid-1979. The Clash began playing covers from genres including rockabilly, rock and roll, rhythm and blues, and reggae. In contrast to previous rehearsal sessions, the band kept these rehearsals private, and did not allow hangers-on to attend. This seclusion allowed the band to rebuild their confidence without worrying about the reaction from outsiders, who were familiar with the band&#x27;s punk rock style.

The band developed an &quot;extremely disciplined&quot; daily routine of afternoon rehearsals, broken by a late-afternoon social football game, which fostered a friendly bond between the band members. The football was followed by drinks at a local pub, followed by a second rehearsal in the evening.

The band gradually rebuilt their confidence, with the styles of the session&#x27;s early cover songs setting the template for the diverse material that would be written for &quot;London Calling&quot;. The band were also encouraged by a growing recognition of drummer Topper Headon&#x27;s skills, which they realised could be used to perform music in a wide array of genres and styles beyond punk rock.

== Writing and recording ==

The Clash wrote and recorded demos at Vanilla Studios, with Mick Jones composing and arranging much of the music and Joe Strummer writing most of the lyrics. Strummer wrote &quot;Lost in the Supermarket&quot; after imagining Jones&#x27; childhood growing up in a basement with his mother and grandmother. &quot;The Guns of Brixton&quot; was the first of bassist Paul Simonon&#x27;s compositions the band would record for an album, and the first to have him sing lead. Simonon was originally doubtful about its lyrics, which discuss an individual&#x27;s paranoid outlook on life, but was encouraged by Strummer to continue working on it.

In August 1979, the band entered Wessex Studios to begin recording &quot;London Calling&quot;. The Clash asked Guy Stevens to produce the album, much to the dismay of CBS Records. Stevens had alcohol and drug problems and his production methods were unconventional. During a recording session he swung a ladder and upturned chairs – apparently to create a rock &amp; roll atmosphere. The Clash, especially Simonon, got along well with Stevens, and found Stevens&#x27; work to be very helpful and productive to both Simonon&#x27;s playing and their recording as a band. The album was recorded during a five- to six-week period involving 18-hour days, with many songs recorded in one or two takes.

The first track recorded for &quot;London Calling&quot; was &quot;Brand New Cadillac&quot;, which the Clash had originally used as a warm-up song before recording. &quot;Clampdown&quot; began as an instrumental track called &quot;Working and Waiting&quot;. While working on &quot;The Card Cheat&quot;, the band recorded each part twice to create a &quot;sound as big as possible&quot;.

==Musical style==
&quot;London Calling&quot; is regarded by music critic Mark Kidel as the first post-punk double album, as it exhibits a broader range of musical styles than the Clash&#x27;s previous records. Stephen Thomas Erlewine said the album appropriated the &quot;punk aesthetic into rock &amp; roll mythology and roots music&quot;, while incorporating a wider range of styles such as punk, reggae, rockabilly, ska, New Orleans R&amp;B, pop, lounge jazz, and hard rock. &quot;Brand New Cadillac&quot;, the album&#x27;s second track, was written and originally recorded by Vince Taylor and was cited by the Clash as &quot;one of the first British rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll records&quot;. The fifth song, &quot;Rudie Can&#x27;t Fail&quot; features a horn section and mixes elements of pop, soul, and reggae music together.

The Clash&#x27;s embrace of specific musical traditions for &quot;London Calling&quot; deviated from what Greg Kot viewed as punk&#x27;s iconoclastic sensibilities. Speaking on the album, Jack Sargeant remarked that &quot;whether the Clash completely abandoned their punk roots or pushed punk&#x27;s musical eclecticism and diversity into new terrain remains a controversial issue.&quot; According to rock historian Charles T. Brown, the album led to the band&#x27;s association with new wave music, while music academic James E. Perone considers the album &quot;new wave rock&quot;.

== Themes ==
The album&#x27;s songs are generally about London, with narratives featuring both fictional and life-based characters, such as an underworld criminal named Jimmy Jazz and a gun-toting Jimmy Cliff aspirant living in Brixton (&quot;Guns of Brixton&quot;). In the opinion of &quot;PopMatters&quot; journalist Sal Ciolfi, the songs encompass an arrangement of urban narratives and characters, and touch on themes such as sex, depression and identity crisis. &quot;Rudie Can&#x27;t Fail&quot; chronicles the life of a fun-loving young man who is criticised for his inability to act like a responsible adult. &quot;Clampdown&quot; comments on people who forsake the open-minded idealism of youth and urges young people to fight the status quo. &quot;The Guns of Brixton&quot; explores an individual&#x27;s paranoid outlook on life, while on &quot;Death or Glory&quot;, Strummer examines his life in retrospect and acknowledges the complications and responsibilities of adulthood. &quot;Lover&#x27;s Rock&quot; advocates safe sex and planning.

Some songs have more widely contextualised narratives, including references to the &quot;evil presidentes&quot; working for the &quot;clampdown&quot;, the lingering effects of the Spanish Civil War (&quot;Spanish Bombs&quot;), and how constant consumerism had led to unavoidable political apathy (&quot;Lost in the Supermarket&quot;). &quot;London Calling&quot;, the album&#x27;s title track and opener, was partially influenced by the March 1979 accident at a nuclear reactor at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania. It also discusses the problems of rising unemployment, racial conflict and drug use in Great Britain. According to music critic Tom Carson, &quot;while the album draws on the entirety of rock and roll&#x27;s past for its sound, the concepts and lyrical themes are drawn from the history, politics and myths associated with the genre&quot;.

==Artwork==

The album&#x27;s front cover features a photograph of bassist Paul Simonon smashing his Fender Precision Bass (now on display at the Museum of London, formerly Cleveland Rock and Roll Hall of Fame) against the stage at the Palladium in New York City on 20 September 1979. Simonon explained in a 2011 interview with Fender that he smashed the bass out of frustration when he learned that the bouncers at the concert would not allow the audience members to stand up out of their seats; &quot;I wasn&#x27;t taking it out on the bass guitar, cos there ain&#x27;t anything wrong with it&quot;, Simonon said. Pennie Smith, who photographed the band for the album, originally did not want the photograph to be used. She thought that it was too out of focus, but Strummer and graphic designer Ray Lowry thought it would make a good album cover. In 2002, Smith&#x27;s photograph was named the best rock and roll photograph of all time by &quot;Q&quot; magazine, commenting that &quot;it captures the ultimate rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll moment – total loss of control&quot;.

The cover artwork was designed by Lowry and was an homage to the design of Elvis Presley&#x27;s self-titled debut album, with pink letters down the left side and green text across the bottom. The cover was named the ninth best album cover of all time by &quot;Q&quot; magazine in 2001. In 1995, Big Audio Dynamite (a band fronted by former Clash member Mick Jones) used the same scheme for their &quot;F-Punk&quot; album. The album cover for &quot;London Calling&quot; was among the ten chosen by the Royal Mail for a set of &quot;Classic Album Cover&quot; postage stamps issued in January 2010. The cover art was later parodied for the soundtrack to &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s American Wasteland&quot;.

==Release and promotion==
The album was released in the United Kingdom on vinyl on 14 December 1979, and in the United States on vinyl and 8-track tape two weeks later in January 1980. A gatefold cover design of the LP was only released in Japan. Though &quot;London Calling&quot; was released as a double album it was only sold for about the price of a single album. The Clash&#x27;s record label, CBS, at first denied the band&#x27;s request for the album to be released as a double. In return CBS gave permission for the band to include a free 12-inch single that played at 33⅓ rpm. Ultimately, the planned 12-inch record became a second nine-track LP. The final track, &quot;Train in Vain&quot;, was originally excluded from the back cover&#x27;s track listing. It was intended to be given away through a promotion with &quot;NME&quot;, but was added to the album at the last minute after the deal fell through.

Upon its release, &quot;London Calling&quot; sold approximately two million copies. The album peaked at number nine in the United Kingdom and was certified gold in December 1979. The album performed strongly outside the United Kingdom. It reached number two in Sweden and number four in Norway. In the United States, &quot;London Calling&quot; peaked at number 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Albums chart and was certified platinum in February 1996. The album produced two of the band&#x27;s most successful singles. &quot;London Calling&quot; preceded the album with a 7 December 1979 release. It peaked at number 11 on the UK Singles Chart. The song&#x27;s music video, directed by Letts, featured the band performing the song on a boat in the pouring rain with the River Thames behind them. In the United States, &quot;Train in Vain&quot;, backed with &quot;London Calling&quot;, was released as a single in February 1980. It peaked at number 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart and &quot;London Calling&quot;/&quot;Train in Vain&quot; peaked at number 30 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Disco Top 100 chart.

==Critical reception==
&quot;London Calling&quot; was met with widespread critical acclaim. Reviewing the album for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1980, John Rockwell said it finally validates the acclaim received by the Clash up to that point because of how their serious political themes and vital playing were retained in innovative music with a broad appeal. &quot;This is an album that captures all the Clash&#x27;s primal energy, combines it with a brilliant production job by Guy Stevens and reveals depths of invention and creativity barely suggested by the band&#x27;s previous work&quot;, Rockwell said. Charles Shaar Murray wrote in &quot;NME&quot; that it was the first record to be on-par with the band&#x27;s hype, while &quot;Melody Maker&quot; critic James Truman said the Clash had &quot;discovered themselves&quot; by embracing American music styles. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s Tom Carson claimed the music celebrates &quot;the romance of rock &amp; roll rebellion&quot;, adding that it is vast, engaging, and enduring enough to leave listeners &quot;not just exhilarated but exalted and triumphantly alive&quot;. In a five-star review, &quot;Down Beat&quot; journalist Michael Goldberg said the Clash had produced &quot;a classic rock album which, literally, defines the state of rock and roll and against which the very best of [the 1980s] will have to be judged.&quot; Some reviewers expressed reservations, including DJ and critic Charlie Gillett, who believed some of the songs sounded like poor imitations of Bob Dylan backed by a horn section. Garry Bushell was more critical in his review for &quot;Sounds&quot;, giving the record two out of five stars while claiming the Clash had &quot;retrogressed&quot; to Rolling Stones-style &quot;outlaw imagery&quot; and &quot;tired old rock clichés&quot;.

At the end of 1980, &quot;London Calling&quot; was voted the best album of the year in the Pazz &amp; Jop, an annual poll of American critics published by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. Robert Christgau, the poll&#x27;s creator and supervisor, also named it 1980&#x27;s best record in an accompanying essay and said, &quot;it generated an urgency and vitality and ambition (that Elvis P. cover!) which overwhelmed the pessimism of its leftist world-view.&quot;

=== Reappraisal and legacy ===

&quot;London Calling&quot; has since been considered by many critics to be one of the greatest rock albums of all time, including AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine, who said that it sounded more purposeful than &quot;most albums, let alone double albums&quot;. &quot;This epic double album, from its iconic sleeve to its wildly eclectic mash-up of styles, is surely the quintessential rock album&quot;, wrote &quot;BBC Music&quot; journalist Mark Sutherland. In &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: The &#x27;80s&quot; (1990), Christgau called it the best double album since the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; (1972) and said it expanded upon, rather than compromised, the Clash&#x27;s driving guitar sound in a &quot;warm, angry, and thoughtful, confident, melodic, and hard-rocking&quot; showcase of their musical abilities. According to the English music writer Dave Thompson, &quot;London Calling&quot; established the Clash as more than &quot;a simple punk band&quot; with a &quot;potent&quot; album of neurotic post-punk, despite its amalgam of disparate and occasionally disjointed musical influences. Don McLeese from the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; regarded it as their best album and &quot;punk&#x27;s finest hour&quot;, as it found the band broadening their artistry without compromising their original vigor and immediacy. &quot;PopMatters&quot; critic Sal Ciolfi called it a &quot;big, loud, beautiful collection of hurt, anger, restless thought, and above all hope&quot; that still sounds &quot;relevant and vibrant&quot;. In a review of its 25th anniversary reissue, &quot;Uncut&quot; wrote that the songs and characters in the lyrics cross-referenced each other because of the album&#x27;s exceptional sequencing, adding that &quot;The Vanilla Tapes&quot; bonus disc enhanced what was already a &quot;masterpiece&quot;.

In 1987, Robert Hilburn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; named it the fourth-best album of the previous 10 years and said, while the Clash&#x27;s debut was a punk masterpiece, &quot;London Calling&quot; marked the genre&#x27;s &quot;coming of age&quot; as the band led the way into &quot;fertile post-punk territory&quot;. In 1989, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the 1980 American release as the best album of the 1980s. In the 1994 &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;, Colin Larkin named it the second-greatest punk album; it was also voted number 37 in Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000). In 1999, &quot;Q&quot; magazine named &quot;London Calling&quot; the fourth-greatest British album of all time, and wrote that it is &quot;the best Clash album and therefore among the very best albums ever recorded&quot;. The magazine later ranked it 20th on its list of the 100 Greatest Albums Ever. It has also been ranked as the sixth-greatest album of the 1970s by &quot;NME&quot;, and the second-best in a similar list by &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, whose reviewer Amanda Petrusich said that it was the Clash&#x27;s &quot;creative apex&quot; as a &quot;rock band&quot; rather than as a punk band. In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it eighth on their list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list. The rating dropped to 16 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s revised list in 2020. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Tom Sinclair declared it the &quot;Best Album of All Time&quot; in his headline for a 2004 article on the album. In 2007, it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, a collection of recordings of lasting qualitative or historical significance. In 2009, the album was profiled in the BBC Radio 1 &quot;Masterpieces&quot; series, denoting it as one of the most influential albums of all time.
== 25th anniversary edition ==
In 2004, a 25th-anniversary &quot;Legacy Edition&quot; was released with a bonus CD and DVD in digipack packaging. The bonus CD features &quot;The Vanilla Tapes&quot;, missing recordings made by the band in mid-1979. The DVD includes &quot;The Last Testament – The Making of London Calling&quot;, a film by Don Letts, as well as previously unseen video footage and music videos. A limited-edition picture disc LP was released in 2010.

The edition was met with widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from professional critics, it has an average score of 100 out of 100, based on 12 reviews. &quot;PopMatters&quot; hailed it as &quot;easily one of the best classic re-releases yet&quot;, while &quot;Paste&quot; said &quot;Epic/Legacy has outdone itself.&quot; However, &quot;Blender&quot; recommended consumers opt for the original edition instead, claiming &quot;the demo versions ... sound like an incompetent Clash cover band rehearsing in a sock&quot;.

<doc id="161278" wikidata="Q244982" url="?curid=161278" title="Period 5 element">
<text>A period 5 element is one of the chemical elements in the fifth row (or period) of the periodic table of the chemical elements. The periodic table is laid out in rows to illustrate recurring (periodic) trends in the chemical behaviour of the elements as their atomic number increases: a new row is begun when chemical behaviour begins to repeat, meaning that elements with similar behaviour fall into the same vertical columns. The fifth period contains 18 elements, beginning with rubidium and ending with xenon. As a rule, period 5 elements fill their 5s shells first, then their 4d, and 5p shells, in that order; however, there are exceptions, such as rhodium.

==Physical properties==

This period contains technetium, one of the two elements until lead that has no stable isotopes (along with promethium), as well as molybdenum and iodine, two of the heaviest elements with a known biological role. Niobium has the largest known magnetic penetration depth of all the elements. Zirconium is one of the main components of zircon crystals, currently the oldest known minerals in the Earth&#x27;s crust. Many later transition metals, such as rhodium, are very commonly used in jewelry as they are very shiny.

This period is known to have a large number of exceptions to the Madelung rule.

==Elements and their properties==

(*) Exception to the Madelung rule

== s-block elements ==

=== Rubidium ===
Rubidium is the first element placed in period 5. It is an alkali metal, the most reactive group in the periodic table, having properties and similarities with both other alkali metals and other period 5 elements. For example, rubidium has 5 electron shells, a property found in all other period 5 elements, whereas its electron configuration&#x27;s ending is similar to all other alkali metals: s1. Rubidium also follows the trend of increasing reactivity as the atomic number increases in the alkali metals, for it is more reactive than potassium, but less so than caesium. In addition, both potassium and rubidium yield almost the same hue when , so researchers must use different methods to differentiate between these two 1st group elements. Rubidium is very susceptible to oxidation in air, similar to most of the other alkali metals, so it readily transforms into rubidium oxide, a yellow solid with the chemical formula Rb2O.

=== Strontium ===
Strontium is the second element placed in the 5th period. It is an alkaline earth metal, a relatively reactive group, although not nearly as reactive as the alkali metals. Like rubidium, it has 5 electron shells or energy levels, and in accordance with the Madelung rule it has two electrons in its 5s subshell. Strontium is a soft metal and is extremely reactive upon contact with water. If it comes in contact with water, it will combine with the atoms of both oxygen and hydrogen to form strontium hydroxide and pure hydrogen gas which quickly diffuses in the air. In addition, strontium, like rubidium, oxidizes in air and turns a yellow color. When ignited, it will burn with a strong red flame.

==d-block elements==

===Yttrium===

Yttrium is a chemical element with symbol Y and atomic number 39. It is a silvery-metallic transition metal chemically similar to the lanthanides and it has often been classified as a &quot;rare earth element&quot;. Yttrium is almost always found combined with the lanthanides in rare earth minerals and is never found in nature as a free element. Its only stable isotope, 89Y, is also its only naturally occurring isotope.

In 1787, Carl Axel Arrhenius found a new mineral near Ytterby in Sweden and named it &quot;ytterbite&quot;, after the village. Johan Gadolin discovered yttrium&#x27;s oxide in Arrhenius&#x27; sample in 1789, and Anders Gustaf Ekeberg named the new oxide &quot;yttria&quot;. Elemental yttrium was first isolated in 1828 by Friedrich Wöhler.

The most important use of yttrium is in making phosphors, such as the red ones used in television set cathode-ray tube (CRT) displays and in LEDs. Other uses include the production of electrodes, electrolytes, electronic filters, lasers and superconductors; various medical applications; and as traces in various materials to enhance their properties. Yttrium has no known biological role, and exposure to yttrium compounds can cause lung disease in humans.

===Zirconium===

Zirconium is a chemical element with the symbol Zr and atomic number 40. The name of zirconium is taken from the mineral &quot;zircon&quot;. Its atomic mass is 91.224. It is a lustrous, gray-white, strong transition metal that resembles titanium. Zirconium is mainly used as a refractory and opacifier, although minor amounts are used as alloying agent for its strong resistance to corrosion. Zirconium is obtained mainly from the mineral zircon, which is the most important form of zirconium in use.

Zirconium forms a variety of inorganic and organometallic compounds such as zirconium dioxide and zirconocene dichloride, respectively. Five isotopes occur naturally, three of which are stable. Zirconium compounds have no biological role.

===Niobium===
Niobium, or columbium, is a chemical element with the symbol Nb and atomic number 41. It is a soft, grey, ductile transition metal, which is often found in the pyrochlore mineral, the main commercial source for niobium, and columbite. The name comes from Greek mythology: &quot;Niobe&quot;, daughter of &quot;Tantalus&quot;.

Niobium has physical and chemical properties similar to those of the element tantalum, and the two are therefore difficult to distinguish. The English chemist Charles Hatchett reported a new element similar to tantalum in 1801, and named it columbium. In 1809, the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston wrongly concluded that tantalum and columbium were identical. The German chemist Heinrich Rose determined in 1846 that tantalum ores contain a second element, which he named niobium. In 1864 and 1865, a series of scientific findings clarified that niobium and columbium were the same element (as distinguished from tantalum), and for a century both names were used interchangeably. The name of the element was officially adopted as niobium in 1949.

It was not until the early 20th century that niobium was first used commercially. Brazil is the leading producer of niobium and ferroniobium, an alloy of niobium and iron. Niobium is used mostly in alloys, the largest part in special steel such as that used in gas pipelines. Although alloys contain only a maximum of 0.1%, that small percentage of niobium improves the strength of the steel. The temperature stability of niobium-containing superalloys is important for its use in jet and rocket engines. Niobium is used in various superconducting materials. These superconducting alloys, also containing titanium and tin, are widely used in the superconducting magnets of MRI scanners. Other applications of niobium include its use in welding, nuclear industries, electronics, optics, numismatics and jewelry. In the last two applications, niobium&#x27;s low toxicity and ability to be colored by anodization are particular advantages.

===Molybdenum===
Molybdenum is a Group 6 chemical element with the symbol Mo and atomic number 42. The name is from Neo-Latin &quot;Molybdaenum&quot;, from Ancient Greek , meaning &quot;lead&quot;, itself proposed as a loanword from Anatolian Luvian and Lydian languages, since its ores were confused with lead ores. The free element, which is a silvery metal, has the sixth-highest melting point of any element. It readily forms hard, stable carbides, and for this reason it is often used in high-strength steel alloys. Molybdenum does not occur as a free metal on Earth, but rather in various oxidation states in minerals. Industrially, molybdenum compounds are used in high-pressure and high-temperature applications, as pigments and catalysts.

Molybdenum minerals have long been known, but the element was &quot;discovered&quot; (in the sense of differentiating it as a new entity from the mineral salts of other metals) in 1778 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele. The metal was first isolated in 1781 by Peter Jacob Hjelm.

Most molybdenum compounds have low solubility in water, but the molybdate ion MoO42− is soluble and forms when molybdenum-containing minerals are in contact with oxygen and water.

===Technetium===
Technetium is the chemical element with atomic number 43 and symbol Tc. It is the lowest atomic number element without any stable isotopes; every form of it is radioactive. Nearly all technetium is produced synthetically and only minute amounts are found in nature. Naturally occurring technetium occurs as a spontaneous fission product in uranium ore or by neutron capture in molybdenum ores. The chemical properties of this silvery gray, crystalline transition metal are intermediate between rhenium and manganese.

Many of technetium&#x27;s properties were predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev before the element was discovered. Mendeleev noted a gap in his periodic table and gave the undiscovered element the provisional name &quot;ekamanganese&quot; (&quot;Em&quot;). In 1937 technetium (specifically the technetium-97 isotope) became the first predominantly artificial element to be produced, hence its name (from the Greek , meaning &quot;artificial&quot;).

Its short-lived gamma ray-emitting nuclear isomer—technetium-99m—is used in nuclear medicine for a wide variety of diagnostic tests. Technetium-99 is used as a gamma ray-free source of beta particles. Long-lived technetium isotopes produced commercially are by-products of fission of uranium-235 in nuclear reactors and are extracted from nuclear fuel rods. Because no isotope of technetium has a half-life longer than 4.2 million years (technetium-98), its detection in red giants in 1952, which are billions of years old, helped bolster the theory that stars can produce heavier elements.

===Ruthenium===
Ruthenium is a chemical element with symbol Ru and atomic number 44. It is a rare transition metal belonging to the platinum group of the periodic table. Like the other metals of the platinum group, ruthenium is inert to most chemicals. The Russian scientist Karl Ernst Claus discovered the element in 1844 and named it after Ruthenia, the Latin word for Rus&#x27;. Ruthenium usually occurs as a minor component of platinum ores and its annual production is only about 12 tonnes worldwide. Most ruthenium is used for wear-resistant electrical contacts and the production of thick-film resistors. A minor application of ruthenium is its use in some platinum alloys.

===Rhodium===

Rhodium is a chemical element that is a rare, silvery-white, hard, and chemically inert transition metal and a member of the platinum group. It has the chemical symbol Rh and atomic number 45. It is composed of only one isotope, 103Rh. Naturally occurring rhodium is found as the free metal, alloyed with similar metals, and never as a chemical compound. It is one of the rarest precious metals and one of the most costly (gold has since taken over the top spot of cost per ounce).

Rhodium is a so-called noble metal, resistant to corrosion, found in platinum or nickel ores together with the other members of the platinum group metals. It was discovered in 1803 by William Hyde Wollaston in one such ore, and named for the rose color of one of its chlorine compounds, produced after it reacted with the powerful acid mixture aqua regia.

The element&#x27;s major use (about 80% of world rhodium production) is as one of the catalysts in the three-way catalytic converters of automobiles. Because rhodium metal is inert against corrosion and most aggressive chemicals, and because of its rarity, rhodium is usually alloyed with platinum or palladium and applied in high-temperature and corrosion-resistive coatings. White gold is often plated with a thin rhodium layer to improve its optical impression while sterling silver is often rhodium plated for tarnish resistance.

Rhodium detectors are used in nuclear reactors to measure the neutron flux level.

===Palladium===

Palladium is a chemical element with the chemical symbol Pd and an atomic number of 46. It is a rare and lustrous silvery-white metal discovered in 1803 by William Hyde Wollaston. He named it after the asteroid Pallas, which was itself named after the epithet of the Greek goddess Athena, acquired by her when she slew Pallas. Palladium, platinum, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium and osmium form a group of elements referred to as the platinum group metals (PGMs). These have similar chemical properties, but palladium has the lowest melting point and is the least dense of them.

The unique properties of palladium and other platinum group metals account for their widespread use. A quarter of all goods manufactured today either contain PGMs or have a significant part in their manufacturing process played by PGMs. Over half of the supply of palladium and its congener platinum goes into catalytic converters, which convert up to 90% of harmful gases from auto exhaust (hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide) into less-harmful substances (nitrogen, carbon dioxide and water vapor). Palladium is also used in electronics, dentistry, medicine, hydrogen purification, chemical applications, and groundwater treatment. Palladium plays a key role in the technology used for fuel cells, which combine hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity, heat, and water.

Ore deposits of palladium and other PGMs are rare, and the most extensive deposits have been found in the norite belt of the Bushveld Igneous Complex covering the Transvaal Basin in South Africa, the Stillwater Complex in Montana, United States, the Thunder Bay District of Ontario, Canada, and the Norilsk Complex in Russia. Recycling is also a source of palladium, mostly from scrapped catalytic converters. The numerous applications and limited supply sources of palladium result in the metal attracting considerable investment interest.

===Silver===
Silver is a metallic chemical element with the chemical symbol Ag (, from the Indo-European root &quot;*arg-&quot; for &quot;grey&quot; or &quot;shining&quot;) and atomic number 47. A soft, white, lustrous transition metal, it has the highest electrical conductivity of any element and the highest thermal conductivity of any metal. The metal occurs naturally in its pure, free form (native silver), as an alloy with gold and other metals, and in minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite. Most silver is produced as a byproduct of copper, gold, lead, and zinc refining.

Silver has long been valued as a precious metal, and it is used to make ornaments, jewelry, high-value tableware, utensils (hence the term &quot;silverware&quot;), and currency coins. Today, silver metal is also used in electrical contacts and conductors, in mirrors and in catalysis of chemical reactions. Its compounds are used in photographic film, and dilute silver nitrate solutions and other silver compounds are used as disinfectants and microbiocides. While many medical antimicrobial uses of silver have been supplanted by antibiotics, further research into clinical potential continues.

===Cadmium===

Cadmium is a chemical element with the symbol Cd and atomic number 48. This soft, bluish-white metal is chemically similar to the two other stable metals in group 12, zinc and mercury. Like zinc, it prefers oxidation state +2 in most of its compounds and like mercury it shows a low melting point compared to transition metals. Cadmium and its congeners are not always considered transition metals, in that they do not have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states. The average concentration of cadmium in the Earth&#x27;s crust is between 0.1 and 0.5 parts per million (ppm). It was discovered in 1817 simultaneously by Stromeyer and Hermann, both in Germany, as an impurity in zinc carbonate.

Cadmium occurs as a minor component in most zinc ores and therefore is a byproduct of zinc production. It was used for a long time as a pigment and for corrosion resistant plating on steel while cadmium compounds were used to stabilize plastic. With the exception of its use in nickel–cadmium batteries and cadmium telluride solar panels, the use of cadmium is generally decreasing. These declines have been due to competing technologies, cadmium&#x27;s toxicity in certain forms and concentration and resulting regulations.

===Indium===

Indium is a chemical element with the symbol In and atomic number 49. This rare, very soft, malleable and easily fusible other metal is chemically similar to gallium and thallium, and shows the intermediate properties between these two. Indium was discovered in 1863 and named for the indigo blue line in its spectrum that was the first indication of its existence in zinc ores, as a new and unknown element. The metal was first isolated in the following year. Zinc ores continue to be the primary source of indium, where it is found in compound form. Very rarely the element can be found as grains of native (free) metal, but these are not of commercial importance.

Indium&#x27;s current primary application is to form transparent electrodes from indium tin oxide in liquid crystal displays and touchscreens, and this use largely determines its global mining production. It is widely used in thin-films to form lubricated layers (during World War II it was widely used to coat bearings in high-performance aircraft). It is also used for making particularly low melting point alloys, and is a component in some lead-free solders.

Indium is not known to be used by any organism. In a similar way to aluminium salts, indium(III) ions can be toxic to the kidney when given by injection, but oral indium compounds do not have the chronic toxicity of salts of heavy metals, probably due to poor absorption in basic conditions. Radioactive indium-111 (in very small amounts on a chemical basis) is used in nuclear medicine tests, as a radiotracer to follow the movement of labeled proteins and white blood cells in the body.

===Tin===

Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (for ) and atomic number 50. It is a main-group metal in group 14 of the periodic table. Tin shows chemical similarity to both neighboring group 14 elements, germanium and lead and has two possible oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table. Tin is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, where it occurs as tin dioxide, SnO2.

This silvery, malleable post-transition metal is not easily oxidized in air and is used to coat other metals to prevent corrosion. The first alloy, used in large scale since 3000 BC, was bronze, an alloy of tin and copper. After 600 BC pure metallic tin was produced. Pewter, which is an alloy of 85–90% tin with the remainder commonly consisting of copper, antimony and lead, was used for tableware from the Bronze Age until the 20th century. In modern times tin is used in many alloys, most notably tin/lead soft solders, typically containing 60% or more of tin. Another large application for tin is corrosion-resistant tin plating of steel. Because of its low toxicity, tin-plated metal is also used for food packaging, giving the name to tin cans, which are made mostly of steel.

===Antimony===

Antimony () is a toxic chemical element with the symbol Sb and an atomic number of 51. A lustrous grey metalloid, it is found in nature mainly as the sulfide mineral stibnite (Sb2S3). Antimony compounds have been known since ancient times and were used for cosmetics, metallic antimony was also known but mostly identified as lead.

For some time China has been the largest producer of antimony and its compounds, with most production coming from the Xikuangshan Mine in Hunan. Antimony compounds are prominent additives for chlorine and bromine containing fire retardants found in many commercial and domestic products. The largest application for metallic antimony is as alloying material for lead and tin. It improves the properties of the alloys which are used as in solders, bullets and ball bearings. An emerging application is the use of antimony in microelectronics.

===Tellurium===

Tellurium is a chemical element that has the symbol Te and atomic number 52. A brittle, mildly toxic, rare, silver-white metalloid which looks similar to tin, tellurium is chemically related to selenium and sulfur. It is occasionally found in native form, as elemental crystals. Tellurium is far more common in the universe than on Earth. Its extreme rarity in the Earth&#x27;s crust, comparable to that of platinum, is partly due to its high atomic number, but also due to its formation of a volatile hydride which caused the element to be lost to space as a gas during the hot nebular formation of the planet.

Tellurium was discovered in Transylvania (today part of Romania) in 1782 by Franz-Joseph Müller von Reichenstein in a mineral containing tellurium and gold. Martin Heinrich Klaproth named the new element in 1798 after the Latin word for &quot;earth&quot;, &quot;tellus&quot;. Gold telluride minerals (responsible for the name of Telluride, Colorado) are the most notable natural gold compounds. However, they are not a commercially significant source of tellurium itself, which is normally extracted as by-product of copper and lead production.

Tellurium is commercially primarily used in alloys, foremost in steel and copper to improve machinability. Applications in solar panels and as a semiconductor material also consume a considerable fraction of tellurium production.

===Iodine===

Iodine is a chemical element with the symbol I and atomic number 53. The name is from Greek &quot;ioeidēs&quot;, meaning violet or purple, due to the color of elemental iodine vapor.

Iodine and its compounds are primarily used in nutrition, and industrially in the production of acetic acid and certain polymers. Iodine&#x27;s relatively high atomic number, low toxicity, and ease of attachment to organic compounds have made it a part of many X-ray contrast materials in modern medicine. Iodine has only one stable isotope. A number of iodine radioisotopes are also used in medical applications.

Iodine is found on Earth mainly as the highly water-soluble iodide I−, which concentrates it in oceans and brine pools. Like the other halogens, free iodine occurs mainly as a diatomic molecule I2, and then only momentarily after being oxidized from iodide by an oxidant like free oxygen. In the universe and on Earth, iodine&#x27;s high atomic number makes it a relatively rare element. However, its presence in ocean water has given it a role in biology (see below).

===Xenon===
Xenon is a chemical element with the symbol Xe and atomic number 54. A colorless, heavy, odorless noble gas, xenon occurs in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere in trace amounts. Although generally unreactive, xenon can undergo a few chemical reactions such as the formation of xenon hexafluoroplatinate, the first noble gas compound to be synthesized.

Naturally occurring xenon consists of nine stable isotopes. There are also over 40 unstable isotopes that undergo radioactive decay. The isotope ratios of xenon are an important tool for studying the early history of the Solar System. Radioactive xenon-135 is produced from iodine-135 as a result of nuclear fission, and it acts as the most significant neutron absorber in nuclear reactors.

Xenon is used in flash lamps and arc lamps, and as a general anesthetic. The first excimer laser design used a xenon dimer molecule (Xe2) as its lasing medium, and the earliest laser designs used xenon flash lamps as pumps. Xenon is also being used to search for hypothetical weakly interacting massive particles and as the propellant for ion thrusters in spacecraft.

==Biological role==

Rubidium, strontium, yttrium, zirconium, and niobium have no biological role. Yttrium can cause lung disease in humans.

Molybdenum-containing enzymes are used as catalysts by some bacteria to break the chemical bond in atmospheric molecular nitrogen, allowing biological nitrogen fixation. At least 50 molybdenum-containing enzymes are now known in bacteria and animals, though only the bacterial and cyanobacterial enzymes are involved in nitrogen fixation. Owing to the diverse functions of the remainder of the enzymes, molybdenum is a required element for life in higher organisms (eukaryotes), though not in all bacteria.

Technetium, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, and silver have no biological role. Although cadmium has no known biological role in higher organisms, a cadmium-dependent carbonic anhydrase has been found in marine diatoms. Rats fed a tin-free diet exhibited improper growth, but the evidence for essentiality is otherwise limited. Indium has no biological role and can be toxic as well as antimony.

Tellurium has no biological role, although fungi can incorporate it in place of sulfur and selenium into amino acids such as tellurocysteine and telluromethionine. In humans, tellurium is partly metabolized into dimethyl telluride, (CH3)2Te, a gas with a garlic-like odor which is exhaled in the breath of victims of tellurium toxicity or exposure.

Iodine is the heaviest essential element utilized widely by life in biological functions (only tungsten, employed in enzymes by a few species of bacteria, is heavier). Iodine&#x27;s rarity in many soils, due to initial low abundance as a crust-element, and also leaching of soluble iodide by rainwater, has led to many deficiency problems in land animals and inland human populations. Iodine deficiency affects about two billion people and is the leading preventable cause of intellectual disabilities. Iodine is required by higher animals, which use it to synthesize thyroid hormones, which contain the element. Because of this function, radioisotopes of iodine are concentrated in the thyroid gland along with nonradioactive iodine. The radioisotope iodine-131, which has a high fission product yield, concentrates in the thyroid, and is one of the most carcinogenic of nuclear fission products.

Xenon has no biological role, and is used as a general anaesthetic.

<text>A noble metal is ordinarily regarded as a metallic element that is generally resistant to corrosion and is usually found in nature in its raw form. Gold, platinum, and the other platinum group metals (ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium) are most often so classified. Silver, copper, and mercury are sometimes included as noble metals, but each of these usually occurs in nature combined with sulfur.

In more specialized fields of study and applications the number of elements counted as noble metals can be smaller or larger. It is sometimes used for the three metals copper, silver, and gold which have filled d-bands, while it is often used mainly for silver and gold when discussing surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy involving metal nanoparticles. It is sometimes applied more broadly to any metallic or semimetallic element that does not react with a weak acid and give off hydrogen gas in the process. This broader set includes copper, mercury, technetium, rhenium, arsenic, antimony, bismuth, polonium, gold, the six platinum group metals, and silver.

Many of the noble metals are used in alloys for jewelry or coinage. In dentistry, silver is not always considered a noble metal because it is subject to corrosion when present in the mouth. All the metals are important heterogeneous catalysts.

== Meaning and history ==
While lists of noble metals can differ, they tend to cluster around gold and the six platinum group metals: ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum.

In addition to this term&#x27;s function as a compound noun, there are circumstances where &quot;noble&quot; is used as an adjective for the noun &quot;metal&quot;. A galvanic series is a hierarchy of metals (or other electrically conductive materials, including composites and semimetals) that runs from noble to active, and allows one to predict how materials will interact in the environment used to generate the series. In this sense of the word, graphite is more noble than silver and the relative nobility of many materials is highly dependent upon context, as for aluminium and stainless steel in conditions of varying pH.

The term &quot;noble metal&quot; can be traced back to at least the late 14th century and has slightly different meanings in different fields of study and application.

Prior to Mendeleev&#x27;s publication in 1869 of the first (eventually) widely accepted periodic table, Odling published a table in 1864, in which the &quot;noble metals&quot; rhodium, ruthenium, palladium; and platinum, iridium, and osmium were grouped together, and adjacent to silver and gold.

== Properties ==
===Geochemical===
The noble metals are siderophiles (iron-lovers). They tend to sink into the Earth&#x27;s core because they dissolve readily in iron either as solid solutions or in the molten state. Most siderophile elements have practically no affinity whatsoever for oxygen: indeed, oxides of gold are thermodynamically unstable with respect to the elements.

Copper, silver, gold, and the six platinum group metals are the only native metals that occur naturally in relatively large amounts.

===Corrosion resistance===
Noble metals tend to be resistant to oxidation and other forms of corrosion, and this corrosion resistance is often considered to be a defining characteristic. Some exceptions are described below.

Copper is dissolved by nitric acid and aqueous potassium cyanide.

Ruthenium can be dissolved in aqua regia, a highly concentrated mixture of hydrochloric acid and nitric acid, only when in the presence of oxygen, while rhodium must be in a fine pulverized form. Palladium and silver are soluble in nitric acid, while silver&#x27;s solubility in aqua regia is limited by the formation of silver chloride precipitate.

Rhenium reacts with oxidizing acids, and hydrogen peroxide, and is said to be tarnished by moist air. Osmium and iridium are chemically inert in ambient conditions. Platinum and gold can be dissolved in aqua regia. Mercury reacts with oxidising acids.

In 2010, US researchers discovered that an organic &quot;aqua regia&quot; in the form of a mixture of thionyl chloride SOCl2 and the organic solvent pyridine C5H5N achieved &quot;high dissolution rates of noble metals under mild conditions, with the added benefit of being tunable to a specific metal&quot; for example, gold but not palladium or platinum.

However, Gold can be dissolved in selenic acid (H2SeO4).

=== Anion (-ide) formation===
The noble elements gold and platinum also have a comparatively high electronegativity for a metallic element, thus allowing them to exist as single-metallic anions.

For example:

Cs + Au -&gt; CsAu
(Caesium auride, a yellow crystalline salt with the ion). Platinum also exhibits similar properties with
BaPt, BaPt2, Cs2Pt (Barium and Caesium Platinides, which are reddish salts).

=== Electronic ===
The expression noble metal is sometimes confined to copper, silver, and gold since their full d-subshells can contribute to their noble character. There are also known to be significant contributions from how readily there is overlap of the d-electron states with the orbitals of other elements, particularly for gold. Relativistic contributions are also important, playing a role in the catalytic properties of gold.

The elements to the left of gold and silver have incompletely filled d-bands, which is believed to play a role in their catalytic properties. A common explanation is the d-band filling model of Hammer and Jens Nørskov, where the total d-bands are considered, not just the unoccupied states.

The low-energy plasmon properties are also of some importance, particularly those of silver and gold nanoparticles for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, localized surface plasmons and other plasmonic properties.

=== Electrochemical ===
Standard reduction potentials in aqueous solution are also a useful way of predicting the non-aqueous chemistry of the metals involved. Thus, metals with high negative potentials, such as sodium, or potassium, will ignite in air, forming the respective oxides. These fires cannot be extinguished with water, which also react with the metals involved to give hydrogen, which is itself explosive. Noble metals, in contrast, are disinclined to react with oxygen and, for that reason (as well as their scarcity) have been valued for millennia, and used in jewellery and coins.

The adjacent table lists standard reduction potential in volts; electronegativity (revised Pauling); and electron affinity values (kJ/mol), for some metals and metalloids.

The simplified entries in the reaction column can be read in detail from the Pourbaix diagrams of the considered element in water. Noble metals have large positive potentials; elements not in this table have a negative standard potential or are not metals.

Electronegativity is included since it is reckoned to be, &quot;a major driver of metal nobleness and reactivity&quot;.

The black tarnish commonly seen on silver arises from its sensitivity to sulphur containing gases such as hydrogen sulfide:

:2 Ag + H2S + O2 → Ag2S + H2O.

Rayner-Canham contends that, &quot;silver is so much more chemically-reactive and has such a different chemistry, that it should not be considered as a &#x27;noble metal&#x27;.&quot; In dentistry, silver is not regarded as a noble metal due to its tendency to corrode in the oral environment.

The relevance of the entry for water is addressed by Li et al. in the context of galvanic corrosion. Such a process will only occur when:
:&quot;(1) two metals which have different electrochemical potentials are...connected, (2) an aqueous phase with electrolyte exists, and (3) one of the two metals has...potential lower than the potential of the reaction ( + 4e + = 4 OH•) which is 0.4 V...The...metal with...a potential less than 0.4 V acts as an anode...loses electrons...and dissolves in the aqueous medium. The noble metal (with higher electrochemical potential) acts as a cathode and, under many conditions, the reaction on this electrode is generally − 4 e• − = 4 OH•).&quot;

The superheavy elements from hassium (element 108) to livermorium (116) inclusive are expected to be &quot;partially very noble metals&quot;; chemical investigations of hassium has established that it behaves like its lighter congener osmium, and preliminary investigations of nihonium and flerovium have suggested but not definitively established noble behavior. Copernicium&#x27;s behaviour seems to partly resemble both its lighter congener mercury and the noble gas radon.

===Oxides===
As long ago as 1890, Hiorns observed as follows:

:&quot;Noble Metals. Gold, Platinum, Silver, and a few rare metals. The members of this class have little or no tendency to unite with oxygen in the free state, and when placed in water at a red heat do not alter its composition. The oxides are readily decomposed by heat in consequence of the feeble affinity between the metal and oxygen.&quot;

Smith, writing in 1946, continued the theme:
:&quot;There is no sharp dividing line [between &#x27;noble metals&#x27; and &#x27;base metals&#x27;] but perhaps the best definition of a noble metal is a metal whose oxide is easily decomposed at a temperature below a red heat.&quot;

:&quot;It follows from this that noble metals...have little attraction for oxygen and are consequently not oxidised or discoloured at moderate temperatures.&quot;
Such nobility is mainly associated with the relatively high electronegativity values of the noble metals, resulting in only weakly polar covalent bonding with oxygen. The table lists the melting points of the oxides of the noble metals, and for some of those of the non-noble metals, for the elements in their most stable oxidation states.

=== Catalytic properties ===
All the noble metals can act as catalysts. For example, platinum is used in catalytic converters, devices which convert toxic gases produced in car engines, such as the oxides of nitrogen, into non-polluting substances.

Gold has many industrial applications; it is used as a catalyst in hydrogenation and the water gas shift reaction.

<text>Leslie Townes &quot;Bob&quot; Hope (May 29, 1903 – July 27, 2003) was an English-born American comedian, actor, entertainer and producer with a career that spanned nearly 80 years and achievements in vaudeville, network radio, television, and USO Tours. He appeared in more than 70 short and feature films, starring in 54. These included a series of seven &quot;Road to ...&quot; musical comedy films with Bing Crosby as his partner.

Hope hosted the Academy Awards show 19 times, more than any other host. He also appeared in many stage productions and television roles and wrote 14 books. The song &quot;Thanks for the Memory&quot; was his signature tune. He was praised for his comedic timing, specializing in one-liners and rapid-fire delivery of jokes that were often self-deprecating. Between 1941 and 1991, he made 57 tours for the United Service Organizations (USO), entertaining military personnel around the world. In 1997, Congress passed a bill that made him an honorary veteran of the Armed Forces.

Hope was born in the Eltham district of southeast London. He arrived in the United States with his family at the age of four, and grew up near Cleveland, Ohio. He became a boxer in the 1910s but moved into show business in the early 1920s, initially as a comedian and dancer on the vaudeville circuit before acting on Broadway. He began appearing on radio and in films starting in 1934. Hope retired from public life in 1999 and died in 2003, at 100.

== Early years ==
Leslie Townes Hope was born on May 29, 1903, in Eltham, County of London (now part of the Royal Borough of Greenwich), in a terraced house at 44 Craigton Road in Well Hall, where there is now a British Film Institute &#x27;Centenary of British Cinema&#x27; commemorative plaque in his memory. He was the fifth of seven sons of William Henry Hope, a stonemason from Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, and Welsh mother Avis (née Townes), a light opera singer from Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, who later worked as a cleaner. William and Avis married in April 1891 and lived at 12 Greenwood Street in Barry before moving to Whitehall, Bristol, and then to St George, Bristol. The family emigrated to the United States aboard the SS &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, passing through Ellis Island, New York on March 30, 1908, before moving on to Cleveland, Ohio.

From age 12, Hope earned pocket money by singing, dancing, and performing comedy on the street. He entered numerous dancing and amateur talent contests as Lester Hope, and won a prize in 1915 for his impersonation of Charlie Chaplin. For a time, he attended the Boys&#x27; Industrial School in Lancaster, Ohio, and as an adult donated sizable sums of money to the institution. He had a brief career as a boxer in 1919, fighting under the name Packy East. He had three wins and one loss, and he participated in a few staged charity bouts later in life. In December 1920, 17-year-old Hope and his brothers became US citizens when their British parents became naturalised Americans.

In 1921, while working as a lineman for a power company, Hope was assisting his brother Jim in clearing trees when a tree crashed to the ground, crushing his face; the accident required reconstructive surgery, which contributed to his later distinctive appearance. In his teens, he had also worked as a butcher&#x27;s assistant as well as a brief stint at Cleveland&#x27;s Chandler Motor Car Company in his early 20s.

Hope and his girlfriend later signed up for dancing lessons, encouraged after they performed in a three-day engagement at a club. Hope then formed a partnership with Lloyd Durbin, a friend from the dancing school. Silent film comedian Fatty Arbuckle saw them perform in 1925 and found them work with a touring troupe called Hurley&#x27;s Jolly Follies. Within a year, Hope had formed an act called the &quot;Dancemedians&quot; with George Byrne and the Hilton Sisters, conjoined twins who performed a tap-dancing routine on the vaudeville circuit. Hope and Byrne also had an act as Siamese twins; they sang and danced while wearing blackface until friends advised Hope that he was funnier by himself.

In 1929, Hope informally changed his first name to &quot;Bob&quot;. In one version of the story, he named himself after racecar driver Bob Burman. In another, he said that he chose the name because he wanted a name with a &quot;friendly &#x27;Hiya, fellas!&#x27; sound&quot; to it. In a 1942 legal document, his legal name appears as Lester Townes Hope; it is unknown if this reflects a legal name change from Leslie. After five years on the vaudeville circuit, Hope was &quot;surprised and humbled&quot; when he failed a 1930 screen test for the RKO-Pathé short-subject studio at Culver City, California.

== Career ==
=== 1927–1937: Early theatre and film roles ===

In the early days, Hope&#x27;s career included appearances on stage in vaudeville shows and Broadway productions. Hope&#x27;s first Broadway appearances, in 1927&#x27;s &quot;The Sidewalks of New York&quot; and 1928&#x27;s &quot;Ups-a-Daisy&quot;, were minor walk-on parts. He returned to Broadway in 1933 to star as Huckleberry Haines in the Jerome Kern and Dorothy Fields musical &quot;Roberta&quot;. Stints in the musicals &quot;Say When&quot;, the 1936 Ziegfeld Follies with Fanny Brice, and &quot;Red, Hot and Blue&quot; with Ethel Merman and Jimmy Durante followed.

He began performing on the radio in 1934 mostly with NBC radio, and switched to television when that medium became popular in the 1950s. He started hosting regular TV specials in 1954, and hosted the Academy Awards nineteen times from 1939 through 1977. Overlapping with this was his movie career, spanning 1934 to 1972, and his USO tours, which he conducted from 1941 to 1991.

Hope signed a contract with Educational Pictures of New York for six short comedies. The first was a comedy, &quot;Going Spanish&quot; (1934). He was not happy with it, and told newspaper columnist Walter Winchell, &quot;When they catch [bank robber] Dillinger, they&#x27;re going to make him sit through it twice.&quot; Educational Pictures took umbrage at the remark and canceled Hope&#x27;s contract after only the one film. He soon signed with the Vitaphone short-subject studio in Brooklyn, New York, making musical and comedy shorts during the day and performing in Broadway shows in the evenings.

=== 1938–1949: Hollywood contract and stardom ===
Hope moved to Hollywood when Paramount Pictures signed him for the 1938 film &quot;The Big Broadcast of 1938&quot;, also starring W. C. Fields. The song &quot;Thanks for the Memory&quot;, which later became his trademark, was introduced in the film as a duet with Shirley Ross, accompanied by Shep Fields and his orchestra. The sentimental, fluid nature of the music allowed Hope&#x27;s writers—he depended heavily upon joke writers throughout his career—to later create variations of the song to fit specific circumstances, such as bidding farewell to troops while on tour or mentioning the names of towns in which he was performing.

As a film star, Hope was best known for such comedies as &quot;My Favorite Brunette&quot; and the highly successful &quot;Road&quot; movies in which he starred with Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour. The series consists of seven films made between 1940 and 1962: &quot;Road to Singapore&quot; (1940), &quot;Road to Zanzibar&quot; (1941), &quot;Road to Morocco&quot; (1942), &quot;Road to Utopia&quot; (1946), &quot;Road to Rio&quot; (1947), &quot;Road to Bali&quot; (1952), and &quot;The Road to Hong Kong&quot; (1962). At the outset, Paramount executives were amazed at how relaxed and compatible Hope and Crosby were as a team. What the executives didn&#x27;t know was that Hope and Crosby had already worked together (on the vaudeville stage in 1932), and that working so easily in the &quot;Road&quot; pictures was just an extension of their old stage act.

Hope had seen Lamour performing as a nightclub singer in New York, and invited her to work on his United Service Organizations (USO) tours of military facilities. Lamour sometimes arrived for filming prepared with her lines, only to be baffled by completely rewritten scripts or ad-libbed dialogue between Hope and Crosby. Hope and Lamour were lifelong friends, and she remains the actress most associated with his film career although he made movies with dozens of leading ladies, including Katharine Hepburn, Paulette Goddard, Hedy Lamarr, Lucille Ball, Rosemary Clooney, Jane Russell, and Elke Sommer.

Hope and Crosby teamed not only for the &quot;Road&quot; pictures, but for many stage, radio, and television appearances and many brief movie appearances together over the decades until Crosby died in 1977. Although the two invested together in oil leases and other business ventures, worked together frequently, and lived near each other, they rarely saw each other socially. After the release of &quot;Road to Singapore&quot; (1940), Hope&#x27;s screen career took off, and he had a long and successful run. After an 11-year hiatus from the &quot;Road&quot; genre, he and Crosby reteamed for &quot;The Road to Hong Kong&quot; (1962), starring the 28-year-old Joan Collins in place of Lamour, whom Crosby thought was too old for the part. They had planned one more movie together in 1977, &quot;The Road to the Fountain of Youth&quot;, but filming was postponed when Crosby was injured in a fall, and the production was canceled when he suddenly died of heart failure that October.

Hope starred in 54 theatrical features between 1938 and 1972, as well as cameos and short films. Most of his later movies failed to match the success of his 1940s efforts. He was disappointed with his appearance in &quot;Cancel My Reservation&quot; (1972), his last starring film; critics and filmgoers panned the movie. Though his career as a film star effectively ended in 1972, he did make a few cameo film appearances into the 1980s.
Hope&#x27;s career in broadcasting began on radio in 1934. His first regular series for NBC Radio was the &quot;Woodbury Soap Hour&quot; in 1937, on a 26-week contract. Serving as the master of ceremonies for these &quot;Rippling Rhythm Revue&quot; radio broadcasts, Hope collaborated with the big band leader Shep Fields during this period of transition from vaudeville to radio. A year later, &quot;The Pepsodent Show Starring Bob Hope&quot; began, and Hope signed a ten-year contract with the show&#x27;s sponsor, Lever Brothers. He hired eight writers and paid them out of his salary of $2,500 a week. The original staff included Mel Shavelson, Norman Panama, Jack Rose, Sherwood Schwartz, and Schwartz&#x27;s brother Al. The writing staff eventually grew to fifteen. The show became the top radio program in the country. Regulars on the series included Jerry Colonna and Barbara Jo Allen as spinster Vera Vague. Hope continued his lucrative career in radio into the 1950s, when radio&#x27;s popularity began being overshadowed by the upstart television medium.

=== 1950–1979: Television specials ===
Hope did many specials for the NBC television network in the following decades, beginning in April 1950. He was one of the first people to use cue cards. The shows often were sponsored by Frigidaire (early 1950s), General Motors (1955–61), Chrysler (1963–73), and Texaco (1975–85). Hope&#x27;s Christmas specials were popular favorites and often featured a performance of &quot;Silver Bells&quot;—from his 1951 film &quot;The Lemon Drop Kid&quot;—done as a duet with an often much younger female guest star such as Barbara Mandrell, Olivia Newton-John, Barbara Eden, and Brooke Shields, or with his wife Dolores, a former singer with whom he dueted on two specials.

On April 26, 1970, CBS released the Raquel Welch television special &quot;Raquel!&quot;; in it Hope appears as a guest. Hope&#x27;s 1970 and 1971 Christmas specials for NBC—filmed in Vietnam in front of military audiences at the height of the war—are on the list of the Top 46 U.S. network prime-time telecasts. Both were seen by more than 60 percent of the U.S. households watching television. Likely the most unusual of his television specials was &quot;Joys!&quot;, a parody of murder mystery narratives, where the audience discovers at the end of the broadcast that Johnny Carson was the villain.
Beginning in early 1950, Hope licensed rights to publish a celebrity comic book titled &quot;The Adventures of Bob Hope&quot; to National Periodical Publications, alias DC Comics. The comic, originally featuring publicity stills of Hope on the cover, was entirely made up of fictional stories, eventually including fictitious relatives, a high school taught by movie monsters, and a superhero called Super-Hip. It was published intermittently and continued publication through issue #109 in 1969. Illustrators included Bob Oksner and (for the last four issues) Neal Adams. Hope reprised his role as Huck Haines in a 1958 production of &quot;Roberta&quot; at The Muny Theater in Forest Park in St. Louis, Missouri. Additionally, Hope rescued the Eltham Little Theatre in England from closure by providing funds to buy the property. He continued his interest and support, and regularly visited the facility when in London. The theater was renamed in his honor in 1982.

===1980–1996: Later appearances===
Hope made a guest appearance on &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, season 4, episode 17 (aired February 25, 1989) called &quot;You Gotta Have Hope&quot; in which Rose is convinced Bob Hope is her father. In 1992, Hope made a guest appearance as himself on the animated Fox series &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in the episode &quot;Lisa the Beauty Queen&quot; (season 4, episode 4). His 90th birthday television celebration in May 1993, &quot;Bob Hope: The First 90 Years&quot;, won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety, Music Or Comedy Special. Toward the end of his career, worsening vision problems rendered him unable to read his cue cards. In October 1996, he announced he was ending his 60-year contract with NBC, joking that he &quot;decided to become a free agent&quot;. His final television special, &quot;Laughing with the Presidents&quot;, was broadcast in November 1996, with host Tony Danza helping him present a personal retrospective of presidents of the United States known to Hope, a frequent White House visitor over the years. The special, though different from his usual specials, received high praise from &quot;Variety&quot;, as well as other reviews. Following a brief appearance at the 50th Primetime Emmy Awards in 1997, Hope made his last TV appearance in a 1997 commercial about the introduction of Big Kmart, directed by Penny Marshall.

Hope continued an active entertainment career past his 90th birthday, concentrating on his television specials and USO tours. Although he had given up starring in feature films after &quot;Cancel My Reservation&quot;, he made several cameos in various films and co-starred with Don Ameche in the 1986 television film &quot;A Masterpiece of Murder&quot;. A television special created for his 80th birthday in 1983 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., featured President Ronald Reagan, actress Lucille Ball, comedian-actor-writer George Burns, and many others. In 1985 he was presented with the Life Achievement Award at the Kennedy Center Honors, and in 1998 he was appointed an honorary Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (KBE) by Queen Elizabeth II. Upon accepting the appointment, Hope quipped, &quot;I&#x27;m speechless. 70 years of ad lib material and I&#x27;m speechless.&quot;

== Other ventures ==
=== Academy Awards host ===
Hope was host of the Academy Awards ceremony 19 times between 1939 and 1977. His supposedly-feigned desire for an Oscar became part of his act. While introducing the 1968 telecast, he quipped, &quot;Welcome to the Academy Awards, or, as it&#x27;s known at my house, Passover.&quot; Although he was never nominated for an Oscar, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences honored him with four honorary awards, and in 1960 presented him with the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, given each year as part of the Oscars ceremony.

=== USO Involvement ===
While aboard when World War II began in September 1939, Hope volunteered to perform a special show for the passengers, during which he sang &quot;Thanks for the Memory&quot; with rewritten lyrics. He performed his first USO show on May 6, 1941, at March Field in California, and continued to travel and entertain troops for the rest of World War II, later during the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the third phase of the Lebanon Civil War, the latter years of the Iran–Iraq War, and the Persian Gulf War. His USO career lasted a half-century during which he headlined 57 times.

He had a deep respect for the men and women who served in the armed forces, and this was reflected in his willingness to go anywhere to entertain them. However, during the highly controversial Vietnam War, Hope had trouble convincing some performers to join him on tour, but he was accompanied on at least one USO tour by Ann-Margret. Anti-war sentiment was high, and his pro-troop stance made him a target of criticism from some quarters. Some shows were drowned out by boos; others were listened to in silence.

The tours were funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, Hope&#x27;s television sponsors, and by NBC, the network that broadcast the television specials created after each tour from footage shot on location. However, the footage and shows were owned by Hope&#x27;s own production company, which made them very lucrative ventures for him, as outlined by writer Richard Zoglin in his 2014 biography &quot;Hope: Entertainer of the Century&quot;.


Hope sometimes recruited his own family members for USO travel. His wife, Dolores, sang from atop an armored vehicle during the Desert Storm tour, and granddaughter Miranda appeared alongside him on an aircraft carrier in the Indian Ocean. Of Hope&#x27;s USO shows in World War II, novelist John Steinbeck, who then was working as a war correspondent, wrote in 1943:

Along with his best friend Bing Crosby, Hope was offered a commission in the United States Navy as lieutenant commander during World War II, but FDR intervened, believing it would be better for troop morale if they kept doing what they were doing by playing for &quot;all&quot; branches of military service.

For his service to his nation through the USO, he was awarded the Sylvanus Thayer Award by the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1968, the first entertainer to receive the award. A 1997 act of Congress signed by President Bill Clinton named Hope an &quot;Honorary Veteran&quot;. He remarked, &quot;I&#x27;ve been given many awards in my lifetime, but to be numbered among the men and women I admire most is the greatest honor I have ever received.&quot; In an homage to Hope, comedian/TV host Stephen Colbert carried a golf club on stage during the week of USO performances he taped for his TV show &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; during the 2009 season.

&quot;Dear Bob...: Bob Hope&#x27;s Wartime Correspondence with the G.I.s of World War II,&quot; written by Martha Bolton (first woman staff writer for Bob Hope) and Linda Hope (his eldest daughter), is a collection of some of his letter to the troops.

===Sports car racing===
During a short stint in 1960, Hope became a part owner of the Riverside International Raceway in Moreno Valley, California, along with Los Angeles Rams co-owner Fred Levy Jr. and oil tycoon Ed Pauley for $800,000 (adjusted to $7.0 million in 2020). Les Richter was made president of the raceway.

== Influence ==
In an interview on NPR, Terry Gross said, &quot;Woody Allen and Conan O&#x27;Brien are two of the people who have referred to Bob Hope as influences. And I think influences in part on their own personas as not being this suave, handsome, macho guy.&quot; Hope biographer Zoglin agreed saying, &quot;Woody continually said, this was the guy who influenced me more than anyone else. And that character - that kind of scared character, the guy talk - nervous, talking his way through, you know, bad times and scary times. That was Woody Allen&#x27;s character in &quot;Sleeper&quot; (1973) and &quot;Love and Death&quot; (1975). He always said that he and Diane Keaton in those films were basically like Hope and Crosby&quot;.

Conan O&#x27;Brien also cited Hope as an influence saying, &quot;I loved Woody Allen. And Woody Allen says, oh, I love Bob Hope really influenced me. And I thought, what are you talking about? How did Bob Hope influence you in any way?...Then I went back and I started looking at seeing some of the movies. And you see it, you see that that the character that Woody Allen does is a character that I think was really, to a large extent invented by Bob Hope.&quot;

== Artistry and legacy ==
Hope helped establish modern American stand-up comedy. He was widely praised for his comedic timing and his specialization in the use of one-liners and rapid-fire delivery of jokes. He was known for his style of self-deprecating jokes, first building himself up and then tearing himself down. He performed hundreds of times per year. Such early films as &quot;The Cat and the Canary&quot; (1939) and &quot;The Paleface&quot; (1948) were financially successful and praised by critics, and by the mid-1940s, with his radio program getting good ratings as well, he was one of the most popular entertainers in the United States. When Paramount threatened to stop production of the &quot;Road&quot; pictures in 1945, they received 75,000 letters of protest.

Hope had no faith in his skills as a dramatic actor, and his performances of that type were not as well received. He had been well known in radio until the late 1940s; however, as his ratings began to slip in the 1950s, he switched to television and became an early pioneer of that medium. He published several books, notably dictating to ghostwriters about his wartime experiences.

Although Hope made an effort to keep his material up to date, he never adapted his comic persona or his routines to any great degree. As Hollywood began to transition to the &quot;New Hollywood&quot; era in the 1960s, he reacted negatively, such as when he hosted the 40th Academy Awards in 1968 and voiced his contempt by mocking the show&#x27;s delay because of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and condescendingly greeted attending younger actors on stage—such as Dustin Hoffman, who was 30 at the time—as children. By the 1970s, his popularity was beginning to wane with military personnel and with the movie-going public in general. However, he continued doing USO tours into the 1980s and continued to appear on television into the 1990s. Former First Lady Nancy Reagan, a close friend and frequent host to him at the White House, called Hope &quot;America&#x27;s most honored citizen and our favorite clown&quot;.

Hope was well known as an avid golfer, playing in as many as 150 charity tournaments a year. Introduced to the game in the 1930s while performing in Winnipeg, Canada, he eventually played to a four handicap. His love for the game—and the humor he could find in it—made him a sought-after foursome member. He once remarked that President Dwight D. Eisenhower gave up golf for painting: &quot;Fewer strokes, you know.&quot; He also was quoted as saying, &quot;It&#x27;s wonderful how you can start out with three strangers in the morning, play 18 holes, and by the time the day is over you have three solid enemies.&quot;

A golf club became an integral prop for Hope during the standup segments of his television specials and USO shows. In 1978 he putted against the then-two-year-old Tiger Woods in a television appearance with the actor Jimmy Stewart on &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;.

The Bob Hope Classic, founded in 1960, made history in 1995 when Hope teed up for the opening round in a foursome that included Presidents Gerald Ford, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton, the only time three U.S. presidents played in the same golf foursome. The event, now known as the CareerBuilder Challenge, was one of the few PGA Tour tournaments that took place over five rounds, until the 2012 tournament when it was cut back to the conventional four.

Hope had a heavy interest in sports beyond golf and his brief fling as a professional boxer in his youth. In 1946, he bought a small stake in the Cleveland Indians professional baseball team and held it for most of the rest of his life. He appeared on the June 3, 1963, cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine wearing an Indians uniform, and sang a special version of &quot;Thanks for the Memory&quot; after the Indians&#x27; last game at Cleveland Stadium on October 3, 1993. He also bought a share with Bing Crosby of the Los Angeles Rams football team in 1947, but sold it in 1962. He frequently used his television specials to promote the annual AP College Football All-America Team. The players would come onstage one by one and introduce themselves, then Hope, often dressed in a football uniform, would give a one-liner about the player or his school.

== Acting credits and accolades ==

Hope was awarded more than 2,000 honors and awards, including 54 honorary university doctorates. In 1963 President John F. Kennedy awarded him the Congressional Gold Medal for service to his country. President Lyndon Johnson bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1969 for his service to the armed forces through the USO. In 1982 he received the S. Roger Horchow Award for Greatest Public Service by a Private Citizen, an honor given annually by Jefferson Awards. He was presented with the National Medal of Arts in 1995 and received the Ronald Reagan Freedom Award in 1997. On June 10, 1980, he became the 64th—and only civilian—recipient of the United States Air Force Order of the Sword which recognizes individuals who have made significant contributions to the enlisted corps.

Several buildings and facilities were renamed for Hope, including the historic Fox Theater in downtown Stockton, California, and the Bob Hope Airport in Burbank, California. There is a Bob Hope Gallery at the Library of Congress. In memory of his mother, Avis Townes Hope, Bob and Dolores Hope gave the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C., a chapel called the Chapel of Our Lady of Hope. of the U.S. Military Sealift Command was named for the performer in 1997. It is one of very few U.S. naval ships that were named after living people. The Air Force named a C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft the &quot;Spirit of Bob Hope&quot;.

In 1965, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters (L.H.D.) degree from Whittier College.
In 1978, Hope was invited to dot the &quot;i&quot; in the Ohio State University Marching Band&#x27;s &quot;Script Ohio&quot; formation, an honor only given to non-band members on 14 occasions from 1936 through 2016. Woody Allen wrote and narrated a documentary honoring him, &quot;My Favorite Comedian&quot;, shown at Lincoln Center. In Hope&#x27;s hometown of Cleveland, the refurbished Lorain-Carnegie Bridge was renamed the Hope Memorial Bridge in 1983, though differing claims have been made as to whether the bridge honors Hope himself, his entire family, or his stonemason father who helped in the bridge&#x27;s construction. Also, East 14th Street near Playhouse Square in Cleveland&#x27;s theater district was renamed Memory Lane-Bob Hope Way in 2003 in honor of the entertainer&#x27;s 100th birthday.

In 1992, Hope was honored with the &quot;Lombardi Award of Excellence&quot; from the Vince Lombardi Cancer Foundation. The award was created to honor the football coach&#x27;s legacy, and is awarded annually to an individual who exemplifies his spirit. He was also inducted into Omicron Delta Kappa, the National Leadership Honor Society, in 1992 at Ferris State University. On May 28, 2003, President George W. Bush established the .

* 17th Academy Awards (1944): Special Award for his many services to the academy
* 25th Academy Awards (1952): Honorary Award for his contribution to the laughter of the world, his service to the motion picture industry, and his devotion to the American premise

== Personal life ==
=== Marriage and relationships ===
Hope was briefly married to vaudeville partner Grace Louise Troxell (1912–1992), a secretary from Chicago, Illinois, who was the daughter of Edward and Mary (née McGinnes) Troxell. They were married on January 25, 1933, in Erie, Pennsylvania. They divorced in November 1934.

The couple had shared headliner status with Joe Howard at the Palace Theatre in April 1931, performing &quot;Keep Smiling&quot; and the &quot;Antics of 1931&quot;. They worked together at the RKO Albee, performing the &quot;Antics of 1933&quot; along with Ann Gillens and Johnny Peters in June of that year. The following month, singer Dolores Reade joined Hope&#x27;s vaudeville troupe and was performing with him at Loew&#x27;s Metropolitan Theater. She was described as a &quot;former Ziegfeld beauty and one of society&#x27;s favorite nightclub entertainers, having appeared at many private social functions at New York, Palm Beach, and Southampton&quot;.

His marriage to Reade was fraught with ambiguities. As Richard Zoglin wrote in his 2014 biography &quot;Hope: Entertainer of the Century&quot;, 

Dolores had been one of Hope&#x27;s co-stars on Broadway in &quot;Roberta&quot;. The couple adopted four children: Linda (in 1939), Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; (1940–2004), Kelly (1946), and Eleanora &quot;Nora&quot; (1946). Bob and Dolores were also the legal guardians of Tracey, the youngest daughter of famous New York City bar owner Bernard &quot;Toots&quot; Shor and his wife, Marion &quot;Baby&quot; Shor. In 1935, the couple lived in Manhattan. In 1937, they moved to 10346 Moorpark Street in the Toluca Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, where they would reside until their respective deaths.

Hope had a reputation as a womanizer and continued to see other women throughout his marriage. Zoglin wrote that Hope had several &quot;affairs with chorus girls, beauty queens, singers and showbiz wannabes&quot;. Women who have claimed to have been romantically linked to Hope include Barbara Payton, Marilyn Maxwell, and Rosemarie Frankland.

=== Politics and beliefs ===
Hope had extensive relationships with US Presidents from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Bill Clinton and often made topical political jokes in his comedic material. He hosted the White House Correspondents Dinner three times in 1944, 1953, and 1976. Hope was supportive politically of conservative Presidents such as Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan.

In an interview with Hope biographer Richard Zoglin on NPR he stated that &quot;Bob Hope was the establishment. Bob Hope was friends with Nixon. Bob Hope was speaking in favor of the Vietnam War. Bob Hope was expressing that kind of backward, suburban, WASP view of minorities, homosexuals, the women&#x27;s movement.&quot; Hope&#x27;s beliefs and attitudes of the social issues are a part of the plot of the 2020 film &quot;Misbehaviour&quot;, which follows the Women&#x27;s Liberation protests at the Miss World 1970 competition that Hope hosted; Greg Kinnear plays Hope.

After the shootings of President Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II in 1981, Hope advocated for gun control. Hope told Tom Shales of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, “I’m for gun registration. I don’t think any jerk that’s coked up or anything should be allowed to walk in a store and buy a gun and turn around and shoot 19 people, you know? … And what the hell, hunters can have their guns, they’re registered. I’ve got a gun in each house for a warning thing; that can be registered … They gotta tell me what’s wrong with having them registered. That’s all I wanna hear.” When Hope shared these views during an ABC Radio interview, he quickly realized the repercussions. Vice President George H.W. Bush, who was visiting West Point the same day Hope taped a special there, had declined to meet with him. Additionally, at a luncheon in Washington that same week, Hope had planned to sit with Nancy Reagan, but she canceled at the last minute.

Hope’s views on the gay community also evolved. At the height of Anita Bryant’s campaign to reverse the progress of gay rights and anti-discrimination legislation in Florida in 1977, he, as well as many other comedians, ridiculed her in their routines, but also expressed his disagreement with Bryant: “We’re all entitled to our own sexual habits [and] I believe what these people do behind closed doors is their business … Most of us today are aware of Anita Bryant’s stand [but] I still think jobs should be based on talent, not whether a person is homosexual or heterosexual.” However, Texaco and Chrysler, sponsors for many of his TV specials, asked him to refrain from making further jokes about the subject. In February 1986, he joined Elizabeth Taylor, to cohost a benefit for American Foundation for AIDS Research and the Arizona AIDS Fund Trust in Scottsdale, AZ. Though expressing these supportive views, he occasionally used epithets and told jokes at the expense of the community yet showed remorse when called on it. During a performance at Liberty Weekend in 1986, Hope remarked, “I just heard that the Statue of Liberty has AIDS, but she doesn&#x27;t know if she got it from the mouth of the Hudson or the Staten Island Ferry.” Two months later, Hope took responsibility for telling the joke and apologized, explaining that he overheard the joke and thought it was funny. When Hope used the word “fag” on a 1988 &quot;Tonight Show&quot; appearance, GLAAD asked for a statement apologizing for the slur. He agreed to tape an anti-gay public service announcement on their behalf

=== Philanthropy and estate ===
Hope, who suffered from vision problems for much of his adult life, served as an active honorary chairman on the board of Fight for Sight, a nonprofit organization in the United States which funds medical research in vision and ophthalmology. He hosted its &quot;Lights On&quot; telecast in 1960 and donated $100,000 ($1.04M in 2024) to establish the Bob Hope Fight for Sight Fund. Hope recruited numerous top celebrities for the annual &quot;Lights On&quot; fundraiser. As an example, he hosted boxing champion Joe Frazier, actress Yvonne De Carlo, and singer-actor Sergio Franchi as headliners for the April 25, 1971, show at Philharmonic Hall in Milwaukee.

Hope&#x27;s Modernist home, built to resemble a volcano, was designed in 1973 by John Lautner. It is located above Palm Springs, with panoramic views of the Coachella Valley and the San Jacinto Mountains. It was put on the market for the first time in February 2013 with an asking price of $50 million. Hope also owned a home which had been custom built for him in 1939 on an lot in Toluca Lake. That house was put on the market in late 2012. The Palm Springs house sold in November 2016 for $13 million to investor Ron Burkle, far below its 2013 asking price.

=== Advanced age and death ===

In July 1997 at age 94, he attended the funeral of Jimmy Stewart, where many pointed out his frail appearance. At the age of 95, Hope made an appearance at the 50th anniversary of the Primetime Emmy Awards with Milton Berle and Sid Caesar. Contemporaries Fay Wray and Gloria Stuart were also present. Two years later, he was present at the opening of the Bob Hope Gallery of American Entertainment at the Library of Congress. The Library of Congress has presented two major exhibitions about Hope&#x27;s life: &quot;Hope for America: Performers, Politics and Pop Culture&quot; and &quot;Bob Hope and American Variety&quot;. He last made an appearance at the Hope Classic in 2000, where he hugged Swedish golfer Jesper Parnevik. In August 2001, Hope was hospitalized for pneumonia.
Hope celebrated his 100th birthday on May 29, 2003. To mark this event, the intersection of Hollywood and Vine in Los Angeles was named &quot;Bob Hope Square&quot; and his centennial was declared &quot;Bob Hope Day&quot; in 35 states. Even at 100, Hope maintained his self-deprecating sense of humor, quipping, &quot;I&#x27;m so old, they&#x27;ve canceled my blood type.&quot;

Hope converted to Catholicism seven years before his death.

In 1998, five years before his death, a prepared obituary written by the Associated Press was inadvertently released, resulting in Hope&#x27;s death being announced on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. However, Hope remained in relatively good health until late in his old age, though he became somewhat frail in his last few years. In June 2000 at age 97, he spent nearly a week in a California hospital being treated for gastrointestinal bleeding. In August 2001 at age 98, he spent close to two weeks in a hospital recovering from pneumonia.

On the morning of July 27, 2003, Hope died of pneumonia at his home in Toluca Lake, California, two months after his 100th birthday. His grandson Zach Hope told TV interviewer Soledad O&#x27;Brien that, when asked on his deathbed where he wanted to be buried, Hope is alleged to have told his wife, Dolores, &quot;Surprise me.&quot; His remains were temporarily placed in a mausoleum vault at the San Fernando Mission Cemetery before the construction of the Bob Hope Memorial Garden at the San Fernando Mission, located next door to the cemetery, in Los Angeles. Dolores died four months after her 102nd birthday in 2011. After his death, newspaper cartoonists worldwide paid tribute to his work for the USO, and some featured drawings of Bing Crosby, who had died in 1977, welcoming Hope to Heaven.

<doc id="161293" wikidata="Q182677" url="?curid=161293" title="Amphoterism">
<text>In chemistry, an amphoteric compound () is a molecule or ion that can react both as an acid and as a base. What exactly this can mean depends on which definitions of acids and bases are being used.
==Etymology and terminology==
Amphoteric is derived from the Greek word () meaning &quot;both&quot;. Related words in acid-base chemistry are amphichromatic and amphichroic, both describing substances such as acid-base indicators which give one colour on reaction with an acid and another colour on reaction with a base.

===Amphiprotism===
Amphiprotism is exhibited by compounds with both Brønsted acidic and basic properties. A prime example is H2O.
Amphiprotic molecules can either donate or accept a proton (). Amino acids (and proteins) are amphiprotic molecules because of their amine () and carboxylic acid () groups. 

===Ampholytes===
Ampholytes are zwitterions. Molecules or ions that contain both acidic and basic functional groups. Amino acids have both a basic group and an acidic group . Often such species exists as several structures in chemical equilibrium:

In approximately neutral aqueous solution (pH ≅ 7), the basic amino group is mostly protonated and the carboxylic acid is mostly deprotonated, so that the predominant species is the zwitterion . The pH at which the average charge is zero is known as the molecule&#x27;s &quot;isoelectric point&quot;. Ampholytes are used to establish a stable pH gradient for use in isoelectric focusing.

Metal oxides which react with both acids as well as bases to produce salts and water are known as amphoteric oxides. Many metals (such as zinc, tin, lead, aluminium, and beryllium) form amphoteric oxides or hydroxides. Aluminium oxide () is an example of an amphoteric oxide. Amphoterism depends on the oxidation states of the oxide. Amphoteric oxides include lead(II) oxide and zinc oxide, among many others.

==Amphiprotic molecules==
According to the Brønsted-Lowry theory of acids and bases, acids are proton donors and bases are proton acceptors. An amphiprotic molecule (or ion) can either donate or accept a proton, thus acting either as an acid or a base. Water, amino acids, hydrogencarbonate ion (or bicarbonate ion) , dihydrogen phosphate ion , and hydrogensulfate ion (or bisulfate ion) are common examples of amphiprotic species. Since they can donate a proton, all amphiprotic substances contain a hydrogen atom. Also, since they can act like an acid or a base, they are amphoteric.

===Examples===
The water molecule is amphoteric in aqueous solution. It can either gain a proton to form a hydronium ion , or else lose a proton to form a hydroxide ion .

Another possibility is the molecular autoionization reaction between two water molecules, in which one water molecule acts as an acid and another as a base.

The bicarbonate ion, , is amphoteric as it can act as either an acid or a base:
:As an acid, losing a proton: 
:As a base, accepting a proton: 
Note: in dilute aqueous solution the formation of the hydronium ion, , is effectively complete, so that hydration of the proton can be ignored in relation to the equilibria.

Other examples of inorganic polyprotic acids include anions of sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and hydrogen sulfide that have lost one or more protons. In organic chemistry and biochemistry, important examples include amino acids and derivatives of citric acid.

Although an amphiprotic species must be amphoteric, the converse is not true. For example, a metal oxide such as zinc oxide, ZnO, contains no hydrogen and so cannot donate a proton. Nevertheless, it can act as an acid by reacting with the hydroxide ion, a base:
Zinc oxide can also act as a base:

==Oxides==
Zinc oxide (ZnO) reacts both with acids and with bases:
*&lt;chem&gt;ZnO + \overset{acid}{H2SO4} -&gt; ZnSO4 + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;
*&lt;chem&gt;ZnO + \overset{base}{2 NaOH} + H2O -&gt; Na2[Zn(OH)4]&lt;/chem&gt;
This reactivity can be used to separate different cations, for instance zinc(II), which dissolves in base, from manganese(II), which does not dissolve in base.

Lead oxide (PbO):
* &lt;chem&gt;PbO + \overset{acid}{2 HCl} -&gt; PbCl2 + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;
* &lt;chem&gt;PbO + \overset{base}{2 NaOH} + H2O -&gt; Na2[Pb(OH)4]&lt;/chem&gt;

Lead oxide ():
* &lt;chem&gt;PbO2 + \overset{acid}{4 HCl} -&gt; PbCl4 + 2H2O&lt;/chem&gt;
* &lt;chem&gt;PbO2 + \overset{base}{2 NaOH} + 2H2O -&gt; Na2[Pb(OH)6]&lt;/chem&gt;

Aluminium oxide ():
* &lt;chem&gt;Al2O3 + \overset{acid}{6 HCl} -&gt; 2 AlCl3 + 3 H2O&lt;/chem&gt;
* &lt;chem&gt;Al2O3 + \overset{base}{2 NaOH} + 3 H2O -&gt; 2 Na[Al(OH)4]&lt;/chem&gt; (hydrated sodium aluminate)

Stannous oxide (SnO):
* &lt;chem&gt;SnO + \overset{acid}{2 HCl} &lt;=&gt; SnCl2 + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;
* &lt;chem&gt;SnO + \overset{base}{4 NaOH} + H2O &lt;=&gt; Na4[Sn(OH)6]&lt;/chem&gt;

Stannic oxide ():
* &lt;chem&gt;SnO2 + \overset{acid}{4 HCl} &lt;=&gt; SnCl4 + 2H2O&lt;/chem&gt;
* &lt;chem&gt;SnO2 + \overset{base}{4 NaOH} + 2H2O &lt;=&gt; Na4[Sn(OH)8]&lt;/chem&gt;

Vanadium dioxide ():
*&lt;chem&gt;VO2 + \overset{acid}{2 HCl} -&gt; VOCl2 + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;
*&lt;chem&gt;4 VO2 + \overset{base}{2 NaOH} -&gt; Na2V4O9 + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

Some other elements which form amphoteric oxides are gallium, indium, scandium, titanium, zirconium, chromium, iron, cobalt, copper, silver, gold, germanium, antimony, bismuth, beryllium, and tellurium.

==Hydroxides==
Aluminium hydroxide is also amphoteric:
*&lt;chem&gt;Al(OH)3 + \overset{acid}{3 HCl} -&gt; AlCl3 + 3 H2O&lt;/chem&gt;
*&lt;chem&gt;Al(OH)3 + \overset{base}{NaOH} -&gt; Na[Al(OH)4]&lt;/chem&gt;

Beryllium hydroxide:
*&lt;chem&gt;Be(OH)2 + \overset{acid}{2 HCl} -&gt; BeCl2 + 2 H2O&lt;/chem&gt;
*&lt;chem&gt;Be(OH)2 + \overset{base}{2 NaOH} -&gt; Na2[Be(OH)4]&lt;/chem&gt;

Chromium hydroxide:
*&lt;chem&gt;Cr(OH)3 + \overset{acid}{3 HCl} -&gt; CrCl3 + 3H2O&lt;/chem&gt;
*&lt;chem&gt;Cr(OH)3 + \overset{base}{NaOH} -&gt; Na[Cr(OH)4]&lt;/chem&gt;

<text>West Brookfield is a town in Worcester County, Massachusetts, United States. The population was 3,833 at the 2020 census. Lucy Stone was born in West Brookfield, and George and Charles Merriam, the publishers of &quot;Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;, were raised there.

==History==
West Brookfield was first settled by Europeans in 1665 and was officially incorporated in 1848, splitting off from Brookfield, which was originally settled as part of the Quaboag Plantation.

The town is believed to be the birthplace of asparagus in the New World. Diederik Leertouwer came to the United States in 1784 to promote trade between the Netherlands and New England. He later settled with his wife and daughter in West Brookfield where he carried out his duties as Consul and lived here between the years 1794 and 1798. At that time West Brookfield had a population greater than Worcester and was being considered for the county seat. Local legend has it that Diederik Leertouwer imported asparagus from his homeland and was the first to plant it in this area. This fact was forgotten until it was discovered in an old cookbook. Wild asparagus still grows in this area today. Leertouwer died here and is buried in the Old Indian Cemetery on Cottage Street in West Brookfield.

The town is also home to the Rock House Reservation, a massive, cave-like rock shelter, exposed after the glacial retreat 10,000 years ago, that served as a winter camp for Native Americans. By the mid-1800s, it was part of a farm owned by William Adams whose descendant, F. A. Carter, dammed a small stream to create Carter Pond and built the cottage now serving as a trailside museum and nature center. The reservation is open year-round, daily, sunrise to sunset. Admission is free to all.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 3.03%, is water. West Brookfield is bounded on the southeast by Brookfield, on the north by North Brookfield and New Braintree, on the west by Ware and on the southwest by Warren. Route 9 is the main route in town. Other routes include Route 67, Route 19 (which begins in West Brookfield), and Route 32.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 3,804 people, 1,362 households, and 965 families residing in the town. The population density was . There were 1,534 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the town was 98.16% White, 0.32% Black or African American, 0.24% Native American, 0.24% Asian, 0.05% Pacific Islander, 0.16% from other races, and 0.84% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.05% of the population.

There were 1,362 households, out of which 33.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 59.4% were married couples living together, 8.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 29.1% were non-families. 23.6% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.53 and the average family size was 3.01.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 22.9% under the age of 18, 5.3% from 18 to 24, 25.7% from 25 to 44, 25.1% from 45 to 64, and 20.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 43 years. For every 100 females, there were 81.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 78.3 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $49,722, and the median income for a family was $58,750. Males had a median income of $41,211 versus $29,783 for females. The per capita income for the town was $21,501. About 4.0% of families and 6.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 9.9% of those under age 18 and 4.6% of those age 65 or over.

==Government==

==Library==

The Merriam-Gilbert Public Library was built in 1880 when Charles Merriam (born in West Brookfield in 1806), famous for publishing the first Webster&#x27;s Dictionary, provided the funding for the structure. After seven months of construction, the building was dedicated as the Merriam Public Library and Reading Room. The Library was eventually re-dedicated in 1960 as the Merriam-Gilbert Public Library after it received an unexpected and generous bequest from Helen E. Gilbert, a former West Brookfield native.

The exterior of the Library remains relatively unchanged with the exception of a cupola, which was destroyed in the Hurricane of 1938. Also, an elevator tower was discreetly added during the 1997 building renovation project that both refurbished and made the building accessible to the handicapped.

The following includes the names of those who have served as Head Librarian (Director) throughout the Library&#x27;s history:
Thomas S. Knowlton, 1880–1894; Charlotte E. Wilbur, 1895–1899; Florence A. Johnson, 1900–1906; Mary P. Foster, 1907–1916; Helen P. Shackley, 1916–1948; Evelyn Hazen, 1948–1951; Freeda E. Huyck, 1951–1953; Doris Jones, 1954–1955; Mildred B. Grazier, 1956–1960; Isabel Smith, 1960–1965; Joanne Scobie, 1965–1967; Roberta M. Rhodes, 1967–1987; Mary Hulser, 1987–1997; Michael J. Bennett, 1997–1999; Louise Garwood (Interim), 1999–2000; Elizabeth Zemelka, 2000–2001; Lisa M. Careau, 2001–2011; Carrie Grimshaw, 2011–2015; Katie Marsh, 2015–2017; MaryAnne Pelletier, 2017-2024; Amy Agro, 2024-present.

In fiscal year 2008, the town of West Brookfield spent 3.11% ($167,532) of its budget on its public library—approximately $44 per person, per year ($57.98 adjusted for inflation to 2022).

==Education==

There is one public school in West Brookfield, West Brookfield Elementary School, serving grades K–6. West Brookfield is regionalized with Warren; students in grades 7–12 from both towns attend Quaboag Regional Middle/High School in Warren.

<text>In biology, a colony is composed of two or more conspecific individuals living in close association with, or connected to, one another. This association is usually for mutual benefit such as stronger defense or the ability to attack bigger prey.

Colonies can form in various shapes and ways depending on the organism involved. For instance, the bacterial colony is a cluster of identical cells (clones). These colonies often form and grow on the surface of (or within) a solid medium, usually derived from a single parent cell. 

Colonies, in the context of development, may be composed of two or more unitary (or solitary) organisms or be modular organisms. Unitary organisms have determinate development (set life stages) from zygote to adult form and individuals or groups of individuals (colonies) are visually distinct. Modular organisms have indeterminate growth forms (life stages not set) through repeated iteration of genetically identical modules (or individuals), and it can be difficult to distinguish between the colony as a whole and the modules within. In the latter case, modules may have specific functions within the colony.

In contrast, solitary organisms do not associate with colonies; they are ones in which all individuals live independently and have all of the functions needed to survive and reproduce.

Some organisms are primarily independent and form colonies in reply to environmental conditions while others must live in a colony to survive (). For example, some carpenter bees will form colonies when a dominant hierarchy is formed between two or more nest foundresses (facultative colony), while corals are animals that are physically connected by living tissue (the coenosarc) that contains a shared gastrovascular cavity.

== Colony types ==

=== Social colonies ===
Unicellular and multicellular unitary organisms may aggregate to form colonies. For example,
* Protists such as slime molds are many unicellular organisms that aggregate to form colonies when food resources are hard to come by, as together they are more reactive to chemical cues released by preferred prey.
* Eusocial insects like ants and honey bees are multicellular animals that live in colonies with a highly organized social structure. Colonies of some social insects may be deemed superorganisms.
* Animals, such as humans and rodents, form breeding or nesting colonies, potentially for more successful mating and to better protect offspring.
** The Bracken Cave is the summer home to a colony of around 20 million Mexican free-tailed bats, making it the largest known concentration of mammals.

=== Modular organisms ===
Modular organisms are those in which a genet (or genetic individual formed from a sexually-produced zygote) asexually reproduces to form genetically identical clones called ramets.

A clonal colony is when the ramets of a genet live in close proximity or are physically connected. Ramets may have all of the functions needed to survive on their own or be interdependent on other ramets. For example, some sea anemones go through the process of pedal laceration in which a genetically identical individual is asexually produced from tissue broken off from the anemone&#x27;s pedal disc. In plants, clonal colonies are created through the propagation of genetically identical individuals by stolons or rhizomes.

Colonial organisms are clonal colonies composed of many physically connected, interdependent individuals. The subunits of colonial organisms can be unicellular, as in the alga &quot;Volvox&quot; (a coenobium), or multicellular, as in the phylum Bryozoa. Colonial organisms may have been the first step toward multicellular organisms. Individuals within a multicellular colonial organism may be called ramets, modules, or zooids. Structural and functional variation (polymorphism), when present, designates ramet responsibilities such as feeding, reproduction, and defense. To that end, being physically connected allows the colonial organism to distribute nutrients and energy obtained by feeding zooids throughout the colony. The hydrozoan Portuguese man o&#x27; war is a classic example of a colonial organism, one of many in the taxonomic class.

=== Microbial colonies ===
A microbial colony is defined as a visible cluster of microorganisms growing on the surface of or within a solid medium, presumably cultured from a single cell. Because the colony is clonal, with all organisms in it descending from a single ancestor (assuming no contamination), they are genetically identical, except for any mutations (which occur at low frequencies). Obtaining such genetically identical organisms (or pure strains) can be useful; this is done by spreading organisms on a culture plate and starting a new stock from a single resulting colony.

A biofilm is a colony of microorganisms often comprising several species, with properties and capabilities greater than the aggregate of capabilities of the individual organisms.

==Colony ontogeny for eusocial insects==
Colony ontogeny refers to the developmental process and progression of a colony. It describes the various stages and changes that occur within a colony from its initial formation to its mature state. The exact duration and dynamics of colony ontogeny can vary greatly depending on the species and environmental conditions. Factors such as resource availability, competition, and environmental cues can influence the progression and outcome of colony development.

During colony ontogeny for eusocial insects such as ants and bees, a colony goes through several distinct phases, each characterised by specific behavioural patterns, division of labor, and structural modifications. While the exact details can vary depending on the species, the general progression typically involves a number of well-defined stages, detailed below. 

===Founding stage===
In this initial stage, a single female individual or small group of female individuals, often called the foundress(es), queen(s) (and kings for termites) or primary reproductive(s), establish a new colony. The foundresses build a basic nest structure and begin to lay eggs. The foundresses can also perform non-reproductive tasks at this early stage, such as nursing these first eggs and leaving the nest to gather resources. 

===Worker emergence===
This is also known as the ergonomic stage. As the eggs laid by the foundresses develop, they give rise to the first generation of workers. These workers can assume various tasks, such as foraging, brood care, and nest maintenance. Initially, the worker population is relatively small, and their tasks are not as specialised. As the colony grows, more workers emerge, and the division of labor becomes more pronounced. Some individuals may specialise in tasks like foraging, defense, or tending to the brood, while others may take on general tasks within the nest. These specialised tasks can change throughout the life of a worker. 

===Reproductive phase===
At a certain point in the colony ontogeny, usually after a period of growth and maturation, the colony produces reproductives, including new virgin queens (princesses) and males. These individuals have the potential to leave the nest and start new colonies, ensuring the transmission of the gene pool of its natal colony.

===Colony death===
Over time, colonies may go through a senescence phase where the reproductive output declines, and the colony&#x27;s overall vitality diminishes. Eventually, the colony may die off or be replaced by a new generation of reproductives. After the death of the queen in a monogyne colony, possible fates other than colony death include serial polygyny (when a virgin queen of the colony replaces the dead queen as the primary reproductive) or colony inheritance (when a worker takes over as primary reproductive).

== Life history ==

Individuals in social colonies and modular organisms receive benefit to such a lifestyle. For example, it may be easier to seek out food, defend a nesting site, or increase competitive ability against other species. Modular organisms&#x27; ability to reproduce asexually in addition to sexually allows them unique benefits that social colonies do not have.

The energy required for sexual reproduction varies based on the frequency and length of reproductive activity, number and size of offspring, and parental care. While solitary individuals bear all of those energy costs, individuals in some social colonies share a portion of those costs.

Modular organisms save energy by using asexual reproduction during their life. Energy reserved in this way allows them to put more energy towards colony growth, regenerating lost modules (due to predation or other cause of death), or response to environmental conditions.

<text>La Maddalena (Gallurese: &quot;Madalena&quot; or &quot;La Madalena&quot;, ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; located on the islands of the Maddalena archipelago in the province of Sassari, northern Sardinia, Italy. It is one of I Borghi più belli d&#x27;Italia (&quot;The most beautiful villages of Italy&quot;).

The main town of the same name is located on the homonymous island.

==Comune==

The La Maddalena comune covers all the territory of the La Maddalena archipelago including the islands: Barrettini, Barettinelli, Bisce, Budelli, Camizie, Cappuccini, Caprera, Chiesa, Colombo, Corcelli, Delle Bocche, Italiani, Le Camere, Nibani, Maddalena, Monaci, Mortorio, Pecora, Piana, Porco, Porro, Presa, Razzoli, Santa Maria, Santo Stefano, Soffi, Spargi and Spargiotto.

==Town==
La Maddalena is the largest town in the Maddalena archipelago, just from the northeastern shore of Sardinia and sitting in the Strait of Bonifacio, between it and Corsica.

The focal-point of pedestrian activity is around Piazza Umberto I (formerly known as Piazza Comando-the older generation of natives in town still commonly refer to the piazza by its original name). There is an adjacent via (Garibaldi) that connects the port (Banchina Commerciale I) facing the Island of Santo Stefano and Piazza Umberto I with city hall. Via Garibaldi is surrounded by commercial shops, restaurants, and bars.

La Maddalena now derives much of its income from tourism. The only method of traveling to La Maddalena is by boat, with car ferries travelling from nearby Palau in Sardinia.

The natives of La Maddalena speak a Sardo-Corsican dialect known as &quot;Maddalenino&quot;.

==Island==
The island of Maddalena has several beaches, including Bassa Trinita and Spalmatore. It is characterized by rocky granitic terrain and has some ancient fortifications. It is connected by causeway with the nearby island of Caprera, known as the last residence of the Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi. 


==History== 
La Maddalena has undergone many name changes: the Romans named it &quot;Ilva&quot;, &quot;Fussa&quot; and &quot;Bucina&quot; and in the Middle Ages the island was known as &quot;Bicinara&quot; before being given the name of &quot;Santa Maria Magdalena&quot; in the 16th century. After this it finally became known as La Maddalena.

The Maddalena archipelago is known from archaeological evidence to have been occupied in prehistoric times, but its written history begins with the Roman Empire.

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire the islands were completely abandoned until the 12th century, when they were chosen by Benedictine monks founding small communities there. The islands were the object of a dispute between the Republics of Pisa and Genoa in the 12th century.

In 1584 all the monasteries on the islands were destroyed by one of the Ottoman raids. In the 17th century shepherds began to bring their flocks to the islands in the winter months.

Its location in the Strait of Bonifacio, through which much maritime traffic must pass, turned the archipelago into a strategic military position. In 1767 it was occupied by the Savoy-Piedmontese. The nucleus of the present town of La Maddalena emerged then.

In 1793 a French expedition, in which Napoleon Bonaparte took part, unsuccessfully tried to occupy the island. It was the first combat experience of Napoleon Bonaparte. During all the Napoleonic Wars Admiral Horatio Nelson used the archipelago of La Maddalena as a base for his fleet in actions against the French.

A base was established here by the Italian (Royal Navy) in 1887. In 1943, during World War II, Benito Mussolini was briefly held prisoner here: his imprisonment took place in Villa Webber from 7 to 27 August.

The former Naval Arsenal at the Moneta locality was planned to host the 35th G8 Summit in 2009, which later was moved to L&#x27;Aquila.

<doc id="161301" wikidata="Q164974" url="?curid=161301" title="Oliver Twist">
<text>Oliver Twist; or, The Parish Boy&#x27;s Progress, is the second novel by English author Charles Dickens. It was originally published as a serial from 1837 to 1839 and as a three-volume book in 1838. The story follows the titular orphan, who, after being raised in a workhouse, escapes to London, where he meets a gang of juvenile pickpockets led by the elderly criminal Fagin, discovers the secrets of his parentage, and reconnects with his remaining family.

&quot;Oliver Twist&quot; unromantically portrays the sordid lives of criminals and exposes the cruel treatment of the many orphans in London in the mid-19th century. The alternative title, &quot;The Parish Boy&#x27;s Progress&quot;, alludes to Bunyan&#x27;s &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; as well as the 18th-century caricature series by painter William Hogarth, &quot;A Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot; and &quot;A Harlot&#x27;s Progress&quot;.

In an early example of the social novel, Dickens satirises child labour, domestic violence, the recruitment of children as criminals, and the presence of street children. The novel may have been inspired by the story of Robert Blincoe, an orphan whose account of working as a child labourer in a cotton mill was widely read in the 1830s. It is likely that Dickens&#x27;s own experiences as a youth contributed as well, considering he spent two years of his life in the workhouse at the age of 12 and subsequently missed out on some of his education.

&quot;Oliver Twist&quot; has been the subject of numerous adaptations, including the 1948 film of the same name, starring Alec Guinness as Fagin; a highly successful musical, &quot;Oliver!&quot; (itself adapted into the Oscar-winning 1968 film), and Disney&#x27;s 1988 animated feature film &quot;Oliver &amp; Company.&quot;

==Publications==
The novel was first published in monthly instalments, from February 1837 to April 1839, in the magazine &quot;Bentley&#x27;s Miscellany&quot;. It was originally intended to form part of Dickens&#x27;s serial, &quot;The Mudfog Papers&quot;. George Cruikshank provided one steel etching per month to illustrate each instalment. The novel first appeared in book form six months before the initial serialisation was completed, in three volumes published by Richard Bentley, the owner of &quot;Bentley&#x27;s Miscellany&quot;, under the author&#x27;s pseudonym, &quot;Boz&quot;. It included 24 steel-engraved plates by Cruikshank.

The first edition was titled: &quot;Oliver Twist, or, The Parish Boy&#x27;s Progress&quot;.

== Plot ==

Oliver Twist is born into a life of poverty and misfortune, raised in a workhouse in the fictional town of Mudfog. The children working there receive very little food; after six months, they draw lots, with the loser asking for another portion of gruel. Oliver is designated, and so he approaches workhouse manager Mr Bumble and humbly requests another serving. A great uproar ensues at this perceived act of rebellion. 

Oliver is removed from the workhouse and sent into the service of the undertaker Mr Sowerberry. One day, his jealous co-apprentice, Noah Claypole, insults Oliver&#x27;s mother and an enraged Oliver attacks him. When he is punished by Mr Sowerberry, Oliver runs away to London to seek a better life.
Oliver meets a young man named Jack Dawkins who calls himself &quot;the Artful Dodger&quot;, offers him food and lodging and takes him to meet an infamous criminal known as Fagin, who trains orphan boys as pickpockets. Oliver innocently begins Fagin&#x27;s training, but when he goes out with the Dodger and another boy and sees them stealing a handkerchief from an old gentleman named Mr Brownlow, he realizes the truth. While the Dodger and the other boy escape, Oliver is pursued, apprehended, formally arrested and tried before Magistrate Fang. Interceding for Oliver, Brownlow takes him home and cares for him. As Oliver recovers, Brownlow and his housekeeper notice that Oliver resembles a woman depicted in a portrait hanging in Brownlow&#x27;s home.

Worried that Oliver might incriminate him and his gang, Fagin sends a young woman named Nancy and her abusive lover, the robber Bill Sikes, to abduct Oliver and bring him back to Fagin&#x27;s lair. Fagin forces him to participate in a burglary planned by Sikes. The robbery goes wrong; while Sikes escapes, Oliver, after having been wounded, ends up in the care of the people he was supposed to rob: Miss Rose and her guardian Mrs Maylie.
A mysterious man, known only as &quot;Monks&quot;, teams up with Fagin, to prevent Oliver from learning of his past. Monks bribes Mr Bumble and his new wife, the former Widow Corney, for information on Oliver. Together, they dispose of a ring and medallion that had once belonged to Oliver&#x27;s mother and had been stolen from her after she died. Nancy, racked with guilt for her role in Oliver&#x27;s kidnapping, secretly spies on them and passes the information on to Rose Maylie, who tells Mr Brownlow. Meanwhile, the Artful Dodger is arrested for pickpocketing, tried and sentenced to transportation to Australia.

Noah Claypole, who had fled to London with the Sowerberrys&#x27; maid Charlotte after robbing Mr Sowerberry, joins Fagin&#x27;s gang. Following Fagin&#x27;s orders, he follows Nancy and discovers that she regularly meets with the Brownlows and Maylies for the sake of Oliver&#x27;s welfare. Fearing that Nancy has betrayed him and Sikes (which, unknown to him, she has refused to do), Fagin passes the information on to Sikes, who beats Nancy to death in a fit of rage and goes into hiding. He is recognised by an angry mob and attempts to flee. Going to Toby Crackit&#x27;s hideout, he learns that Fagin has been arrested. When the mob catches up to him, he tries to escape over the rooftops by swinging on a rope, but while he is about to loop the rope about himself a vision of the dead Nancy&#x27;s staring eyes terrorises him into losing his balance; in the fall, the looped rope catches him around the neck and hangs him.
Mr Brownlow has Monks arrested and forces him to divulge his secrets: he is actually Oliver&#x27;s half-brother and had hoped to steal Oliver&#x27;s half of their rightful inheritance. Brownlow begs Oliver to give half his inheritance to Monks and grant him a second chance, to which Oliver happily agrees. Monks emigrates to America, but squanders his money, relapses into crime and dies in prison. Fagin is arrested and sentenced to the gallows. The day before his execution, Oliver and Mr Brownlow visit him in Newgate Prison and learn the location of the documents proving Oliver&#x27;s identity. Bumble and his wife lose their jobs and are forced to become inmates of the workhouse. Rose Maylie, who turns out to be Oliver&#x27;s maternal aunt, marries and enjoys a long life. Oliver lives happily as Mr Brownlow&#x27;s adopted son.

==Major themes and symbols==

In &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, Dickens mixes grim realism with merciless satire to describe the effects of industrialism on 19th-century England and to criticise the harsh new Poor Laws. Oliver, an innocent child, is trapped in a world where his only options seem to be the workhouse, a life of crime symbolised by Fagin&#x27;s gang, a prison, or an early grave. From this unpromising industrial/institutional setting, however, a fairy tale also emerges. In the midst of corruption and degradation, the essentially passive Oliver remains pure-hearted; he steers away from evil when those around him give in to it, and in proper fairy-tale fashion, he eventually receives his reward – leaving for a peaceful life in the country, surrounded by kind friends. On the way to this happy ending, Dickens explores the kind of life an outcast, orphan boy could expect to lead in 1830s London.

===Poverty and social class===
Poverty is a prominent concern in &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;. Throughout the novel, Dickens enlarged on this theme, describing slums so decrepit that whole rows of houses are on the point of ruin. In an early chapter, Oliver attends a pauper&#x27;s funeral with Mr Sowerberry and sees a whole family crowded together in one miserable room. This prevalent misery makes Oliver&#x27;s encounters with charity and love more poignant. Oliver owes his life several times over to kindness both large and small.

===Symbolism===
Dickens makes considerable use of symbolism. The &quot;merry old gentleman&quot; Fagin, for example, has satanic characteristics: he is a veteran corrupter of young boys who presides over his own corner of the criminal world; he makes his first appearance standing over a fire holding a toasting fork, and he refuses to pray on the night before his execution.

===Characters===

In the tradition of Restoration Comedy and Henry Fielding, Dickens fits his characters with appropriate names. Oliver himself, though &quot;badged and ticketed&quot; as a lowly orphan and named according to an alphabetical system, is, in fact, &quot;all of a twist.&quot; However, Oliver and his name may have been based on a young workhouse boy named Peter Tolliver whom Dickens knew while growing up.

Bill Sikes&#x27;s dog, Bull&#x27;s-eye, has &quot;faults of temper in common with his owner&quot; and is an emblem of his owner&#x27;s character. The dog&#x27;s viciousness represents Sikes&#x27;s animal-like brutality while Sikes&#x27;s self-destructiveness is evident in the dog&#x27;s many scars. The dog, with its willingness to harm anyone on Sikes&#x27;s whim, shows the mindless brutality of the master. This is also illustrated when Bull&#x27;s-eye dies immediately after his master.

Nancy, by contrast, redeems herself at the cost of her own life and dies in a prayerful pose. She is one of the few characters in &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; to display much ambivalence. Her storyline in the novel strongly reflects themes of domestic violence and psychological abuse at the hands of Bill. Although Nancy is a full-fledged criminal, indoctrinated and trained by Fagin since childhood, she retains enough empathy to repent her role in Oliver&#x27;s kidnapping, and to take steps to try to atone. As one of Fagin&#x27;s victims, corrupted but not yet morally dead, she gives eloquent voice to the horrors of the old man&#x27;s little criminal empire. She wants to save Oliver from a similar fate; at the same time, she recoils from the idea of turning traitor, especially to Bill Sikes, whom she loves. When Dickens was later criticised for giving to a &quot;thieving, whoring slut of the streets&quot; such an unaccountable reversal of character, he ascribed her change of heart to &quot;the last fair drop of water at the bottom of a dried-up, weed-choked well&quot;.

==Allegations of antisemitism==

Dickens has been accused of portraying antisemitic stereotypes because of his portrayal of the Jewish character Fagin in &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;. Paul Vallely writes that Fagin is widely seen as one of the most grotesque Jews in English literature, and one of the most vivid of Dickens&#x27;s 989 characters. Nadia Valman, in &quot;Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution&quot;, argues that Fagin&#x27;s representation was drawn from the image of the Jew as inherently evil, that the imagery associated him with the Devil, and with beasts.

The novel refers to Fagin 274 times in the first 38 chapters as &quot;the Jew&quot;, while the ethnicity or religion of the other characters is rarely mentioned. In 1854, &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; asked why &quot;Jews alone should be excluded from the &#x27;sympathizing heart&#x27; of this great author and powerful friend of the oppressed.&quot; Dickens (who had extensive knowledge of London street life and child exploitation) explained that he had made Fagin Jewish because &quot;it unfortunately was true, of the time to which the story refers, that that class of criminal almost invariably was a Jew.&quot; It is widely believed that Fagin was based on a specific Jewish criminal of the era, Ikey Solomon. Dickens commented that by calling Fagin a Jew he had meant no imputation against the Jewish people, saying in a letter, &quot;I have no feeling towards the Jews but a friendly one. I always speak well of them, whether in public or private, and bear my testimony (as I ought to do) to their perfect good faith in such transactions as I have ever had with them.&quot; Eliza Davis, whose husband had purchased Dickens&#x27;s home in 1860 when he had put it up for sale, wrote to Dickens in protest at his portrayal of Fagin, arguing that he had &quot;encouraged a vile prejudice against the despised Hebrew&quot;, and that he had done a great wrong to the Jewish people. While Dickens first reacted defensively upon receiving Davis&#x27;s letter, he then halted the printing of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, and changed the text for the parts of the book that had not been set, which explains why after the first 38 chapters Fagin is barely called &quot;the Jew&quot; at all in the next 179 references to him. A shift in his perspective is seen in his later novel &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot;, as he redeems the image of Jews.

==Reception==
Contemporary reviewers including John Forster and the &quot;Literary Gazette&quot; praised the book for its realistic depiction of social conditions. However others such as Richard Ford considered it an exaggeration of poverty.

== Audio recordings ==
Dickens&#x27;s novel has been recorded many times as an audiobook. Notable recordings include:
*An audio dramatization titled &quot;The Adventures of Oliver Twist And Fagin&quot; starring Basil Rathbone as both The Narrator and Fagin was released by Columbia Masterworks Records (MM-700) in a 3-disc 75rpm set in 1947. This was later re-released by Columbia Records in 33rpm format in 1955 (CL 674) and again in 1977 (P13902).

<text>The Napier Lion is a 12-cylinder, petrol-fueled &#x27;broad arrow&#x27; W12 configuration aircraft engine built by D. Napier &amp; Son from 1917 until the 1930s. A number of advanced features made it the most powerful engine of its day and kept it in production long after other contemporary designs had been superseded. It is particularly well known for its use in a number of racing designs, for aircraft, boats and cars.

==Design and development==

Early in the First World War, Napier were contracted to build aero engines to designs from other companies, initially a Royal Aircraft Factory model and then Sunbeams. Both engines proved to be unreliable and in 1916 Napier decided to design an engine with high power, light weight and low frontal area. Napier&#x27;s engineers laid out the engine with its 12 cylinders in what they called a &quot;broad arrow&quot;—three banks of four cylinders sharing a common crankshaft. The configuration is also known as a W engine. The engine was also advanced in form, the heads using four valves per cylinder with twin overhead camshafts on each bank of cylinders and a single block being milled from aluminium instead of the common separate-cylinder steel construction used on almost all other designs.

Under Arthur Rowledge, the design of the engine, renamed Lion, was completed in 1917; hand-built prototypes ran later that year. It was fitted to an Airco DH.9 in early 1918, and many cooling problems were observed during testing. The milled block was difficult to build with the required accuracy and the design reverted to separate aluminium cylinders. Both problems were solved by the middle of the year and the engine entered production in June 1918. The first Lion I versions delivered from their 24 litres. The power output made the Lion the most powerful Allied aircraft engine, which had previously been the Liberty L-12, producing .

As the most powerful engine available (particularly after a turbocharger became an option in 1922), the Lion went on to commercial success. Through the years between the wars the Lion was ubiquitous and Napier manufactured little else. They stopped making cars in 1925 and little thought was given to replacing their world-famous product. Between the wars the Lion engine powered over 160 different aircraft types.
In highly tuned racing versions, the engine could reach and it was used to break many world height, air speed and distance records in aircraft and boats, delivering in a highly tuned Lion for a water speed record of in 1933. In land speed records, Lion engines powered many of Sir Malcolm Campbell&#x27;s record breakers including a record of over in 1932 and John Cobb&#x27;s &quot;Railton Mobil Special&quot; in 1947—a record that came well after the Lion had passed its prime and stood until the 1960s. The record had been held by British drivers for 32 years. Lions powered successful entrants in the most prestigious event in air racing, the Schneider Trophy, in 1922 and 1927 but were dropped by Supermarine in favour of a new engine, the Rolls-Royce R, which had been designed for racing.

During the 1930s a new generation of much larger and more powerful engines appeared and the Lion became uncompetitive. By the time the Bristol Hercules and the Rolls-Royce Merlin arrived in the late 1930s, the Lion was obsolete. The Sea Lion, a marine version of the Lion, was used to power high speed RAF Rescue Launches. The Lion aero engine was also adapted to power propeller-driven motor sleighs, which were used for high-speed transport and SAR duties on sea ice by the Finnish Air Force and Navy.

Turning away from the broad arrow layout, Napier designed new engines using the more compact H engine layout. The 16-cylinder Napier Rapier produced and the 24-cylinder Napier Dagger delivered just under . The engines were smaller than contemporary designs from other companies and Napier started afresh with a new sleeve valve design, which evolved into the Napier Sabre.

<text>James Basevi Ord (15 March 1892 – 30 January 1938) was a United States Army lieutenant colonel killed in an air crash at Camp John Hay, Philippines. At the time, Ord was serving as the Assistant Military Advisor to the Commonwealth of the Philippines, under United States Military Advisor Douglas MacArthur. Ord was a member of the West Point class of 1915, &quot;the class the stars fell on&quot;, that also included Omar Bradley and Dwight Eisenhower.

==Early life==
James Basevi Ord was born in Mexico on 15 March 1892, the son of Captain James Thompson Ord and Rose Basevi. He came from a distinguished military family. He was the grandson of Major General Edward Otho Cresap Ord; Major Edward Otho Cresap Ord II was his uncle; and Major General James Garesche Ord was his cousin.

Ord received an appointment from California to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, which he entered on 12 June 1911. The class he joined would become famous as the class the stars fell on. Of the 164 graduates that year, 59 would wear the stars of a general officer, the most of any class in the history of the Academy. Classmates included Omar Bradley and Dwight Eisenhower.

==World War I==

On 12 June 1915, Ord graduated 66th in his class, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 6th Infantry. He was sent to Camp Cotton, in El Paso, Texas, where he joined the 13th Cavalry as an interpreter with the Pancho Villa Expedition. He was wounded in the Battle of Parral on 12 April 1916, and was recommended for the Medal of Honor, but instead received the Distinguished Service Medal. His citation read:

Ord was promoted to first lieutenant with the 5th Cavalry on 1 July 1916. He was attached the headquarters of the Punitive Expedition until it was disbanded on 10 February 1917. He was placed in charge of a refugee camp in Columbus, New Mexico, which subsequently moved to San Antonio, Texas. He was then posted to the 54th Infantry at Chickamauga Park, Georgia, on 24 June 1917. On 16 July 1917, he joined the staff of the Reserve Officer&#x27;s Training Camp at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia. Then, on 15 September 1917, he returned to West Point, initially as an instructor in modern languages, and then, from 20 September 1917, in tactics. From 18 May to 25 November 1918, he was an intelligence officer and Assistant Military Attaché in The Hague. He was awarded the Order of Orange-Nassau.

==Between the wars==

Promoted to major on 17 June 1918, Ord reverted to the grade of captain on 30 June 1920, only to return to being a major two days later. He attended the &quot;Ecole Supérieure de Guerre&quot; in Paris. Returning to the United States in July 1924. He reverted to captain again on 4 November 1922, but then was promoted to major again on 20 September 1924. From June 1925 to June 1926 he was a student at the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. After graduation, he was posted to the Philippines, as commander of the 3rd Battalion, 31st Infantry, and then, in May 1928, to the American Embassy in Paris as Assistant Military Attaché. He was technical adviser at the Army General Disarmament Conference, in Geneva, Switzerland, from 2 February to 19 June 1932.

Ord attended the Army War College from 1932 to 1933, and then was an instructor in military intelligence there from 1933 to 1935. That year, the outgoing Chief of Staff of the United States Army, Major General Douglas MacArthur, was appointed Military Advisor to the Commonwealth of the Philippines. MacArthur was permitted to select his own staff, so as his chief of staff, he chose Dwight Eisenhower, who had been his assistant for the previous two and a half years. In turn, Eisenhower was permitted to choose his own assistant, and he chose Ord for his staff skills and his knowledge of Spanish. MacArthur had previously been acquainted with Ord in Paris when MacArthur was Chief of Staff.

==Death==
Ord was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 1 July 1936. His main responsibility was to draw up a military budget for the Philippines. A realistic one proved difficult to create, as the United States government would not supply the funding for the equipment that MacArthur and Eisenhower believed that the Philippines would require in order to resist a Japanese invasion. A key part of this was the fledgling Philippine Air Corps. On 30 January 1938, Ord took off on a flight to Baguio with a Filipino student pilot at the controls. As the plane approached its destination, Ord had the pilot flew low over a friend&#x27;s house so he could drop a note announcing his arrival tied to a rock. The inexperienced pilot stalled the plane and it crashed, killing Ord. President Manuel Quezon awarded Ord the Distinguished Service Star. His citation read:

Upon his death, Ord was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Richard K. Sutherland. Ord was buried in Arlington National Cemetery, not far from his father and other members of his family. He was survived by his wife, Emily Collier Howell, and his two children, James Basevi Ord, Jr., and Letitia Howell Ord. James Jr. subsequently became a colonel in the United States Marine Corps. He married Virginia Cartwright Shepherd, the daughter of General Lemuel C. Shepherd, Jr., a Commandant of the Marine Corps.

<doc id="161305" wikidata="Q2485381" url="?curid=161305" title="Larceny">
<text>Larceny is a crime involving the unlawful taking or theft of the personal property of another person or business. It was an offence under the common law of England and became an offence in jurisdictions which incorporated the common law of England into their own law (also statutory law), where in many cases it remains in force.

The crime of larceny has been abolished in England, Wales, Ireland, and Northern Ireland, broken up into the specific crimes of burglary, robbery, fraud, theft, and related crimes. However, larceny remains an offence in parts of the United States, Jersey, and in New South Wales, Australia, involving the taking (caption) and carrying away (asportation) of personal property without the owner&#x27;s consent and without intending to return it.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;larceny&quot; is a late Middle English word, from the French word &quot;larcin&quot;, &quot;theft&quot;. Its probable Latin root is &quot;latrocinium&quot;, a derivative of &quot;latro&quot;, &quot;robber&quot; (originally mercenary).

==By nation==
===Australia===
====New South Wales====
In the state of New South Wales, the common law offence of larceny is punishable with up to 5 years&#x27; imprisonment. Whilst section 117 of the New South Wales Crimes Act 1900 specifies the punishment for larceny, it is silent on the elements of the offence, leaving them to be articulated by the common law. The leading authority on larceny in NSW is the High Court of Australia case of &quot;Ilich v R&quot; (1987). This case stipulates the mens rea and actus reus elements required to be proven by the prosecution for a successful conviction.

===Ireland===
The common law offence of larceny was abolished on 1 August 2002. However, proceedings for larceny committed before its abolition are not affected by this.

===United Kingdom===
====England and Wales====
The common law offence of larceny was codified by the Larceny Act 1916. It was abolished on 1 January 1969, for all purposes not relating to offences committed before that date. It has been replaced by the broader offence of theft under section 1(1) of the Theft Act 1968. This offence did incorporate some of the terminology and substance of larceny. Despite the offence&#x27;s being abolished in England, it has been retained in the Crown Dependency of Jersey.

====Northern Ireland====
The common law offence of larceny was abolished on 1 August 1969, for all purposes not relating to offences committed before that date. It has been replaced by the broader offence of theft under section 1(1) of the Theft Act (Northern Ireland) 1969.

===United States===
Larceny laws in the United States have their roots in common law, pursuant to which larceny involves the trespassory taking (caption) and carrying away (asportation, removal) of the tangible personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of its possession. Larceny is now codified as a statutory crime in all U.S. jurisdictions.

Under many states&#x27; larceny statutes, including California, larceny can include the taking of &quot;money, labor, or real or personal property.&quot;

==Elements==

===Possession versus custody===
Larceny is a crime against possession. Furthermore, it has two elements which must be met: the actual taking of the property, even if momentarily (&quot;actus reus&quot;), and the culpable intent (&quot;mens rea&quot;) to deprive another of their property. Larceny involves the trespassory taking of property from possession of another, with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of that property. To understand larceny, one must understand the distinction between custody and possession.

* A person has possession of property when he has actual physical control over the property (actual possession) or he has the right to exercise considerable control over the disposition or use of the property (constructive possession).
*A person has custody if he has actual physical control of the property, but the person who has constructive possession has substantially restricted the custodian&#x27;s right to use the property.

Examples of custody would be a store customer examining the goods of a merchant, or an employee who has been given the property of his employer to be used in his employment. This is to be contrasted to, for example, a person who has obtained actual possession of the property by fraud.

Ancient Roman law (first 50 years of written University law, possibly borrowing from Greek law there is no copy of) was more lax about &quot;simple possession&quot;; it was assumed &quot;borrowing&quot; if there was no one to ask: unless or until other factors arose (such as refusal to return promptly when asked).

===Take===
The taking or caption element requires that the offender take actual physical control of the property, if but for a moment. Under the 
common law, it was not sufficient if the offender simply deprived the victim of possession; the offender must have gained control over the property. Thus merely knocking an article from a person&#x27;s hand was not larceny, as long as the defendant did not thereafter take it. The control must be complete. In a famous case, the defendant removed an overcoat from a department store mannequin and began to walk away with it. The overcoat was secured to the mannequin by a chain, a fact the defendant first discovered when the chain drew taut. These actions were held not to be larceny because the defendant never had complete control over the disposition and use of the coat.

The taking may be only momentary. In another famous case, the defendant snatched an earring from the victim which immediately became entangled in the victim&#x27;s hair. The court held that the defendant&#x27;s control over the property, although momentary, was sufficient to constitute a taking. The taking may be either direct or indirect; that is, accomplished by the criminal himself or an innocent agent.

The equivalent term &quot;deprive&quot; is also sometimes used:
===Carry away===
Traditionally, a thief must not only gain dominion over the property, but also must move it from its original position. The slightest movement, a hair&#x27;s breadth, is sufficient. However, the entirety of the property must be moved. As Professor Wayne LaFave noted, at its most literal this requirement renders the rotating of a doughnut a larceny, but not the rotating of a pie, as &quot;all&quot; of the doughnut is moved through rotation while the pie&#x27;s exact center remains in the same place when rotated. The movement must also be an actual asportation, rather than movement in preparation. For example, in one case the victim had left his wheelbarrow in his yard. As was his custom he turned the wheelbarrow upside down to avoid water collecting in the tub. The defendant intending to steal the wheelbarrow turned it over but was apprehended by the owner before he could push the wheelbarrow away. The court held that the defendant&#x27;s acts did not satisfy the asportation element of larceny because the movement of the wheelbarrow had merely been preparatory to the carrying away.

Contrary to popular belief, it is not necessary that the property be removed from the owner&#x27;s premises or be taken off his property for an asportation to be complete. The slightest movement from its original position with the intent to steal is enough. The problem is proof. If a person picks up a package of steaks intending to steal them then changes her or his mind and puts the steak back in the meat counter, the crime of larceny has been committed but the state will have a difficult time proving it. However, if the thief conceals the steaks by sticking them inside clothing, his or her intent is rather clear. Of course, there could still be an innocent if bizarre explanation.

That said, the asportation requirement is not universally required. In &quot;People v. Alamo&quot;, for example, the New York Court of Appeals eliminated the asportation requirement. In that case the defendant entered a stranger&#x27;s car and turned on the car&#x27;s lights and engine. The Court read asportation as merely a corroborative element of possession and control, and thus not necessary to establish possession and control of a car because transportation is the purpose of a car. Turning it on suffices to establish that the thief has taken possession and control.

Additionally, the Model Penal Code eliminates the asportation requirement and instead requires that the defendant &quot;exercise unlawful control&quot;. The drafters noted that historically the asportation requirement distinguished larceny (a felony) and attempted larceny (a misdemeanor). They reasoned, therefore, that asportation was an irrelevant requirement because in modern criminal law, like the Model Penal Code, the sentencing consequences between an attempted and completed crime are negligible.

===Personal property===

From its creation the subject matter of larceny has been tangible personal property, with a physical existence: items that can be seen, held, and felt (or in technical terms, property that has a &quot;corporeal existence&quot;).

This limitation means that acts of common law larceny cannot be committed against land or items attached to or forming part of land, such as buildings, trees or shrubbery, crops growing in the field, or minerals. Acts of common law larceny cannot be committed against intangible things, such as love or affection, identity (identity theft is a type of fraud), or intellectual property, such as information and ideas. For example, if a person stole the Coca-Cola formula, the crime would be larceny, but the grade of the offense would be determined by the value of the paper on which the formula was recorded, not the value of the recipe. (Theft of trade secrets would be a different offense.)

Services and labor, as well as intangible personal property (incorporeal rights) such as contract rights and choses in action; wills, codicils, or other testamentary documents; wild animals; and items having no economic value cannot be the subjects of acts of common-law larceny.

Most states have enacted statutes to expand the coverage of larceny to include most if not all of the items mentioned above. For example, North Carolina has statutes that make it a crime to steal choses in action, growing crops and so on.

The restriction of the scope of larceny to personal property may have practical consequences. For example, a person may &quot;steal&quot; a central air conditioning unit by cutting the connections to the house, removing the unit from its concrete pad and hauling the disconnected unit away in a truck. In most jurisdictions, a central air conditioning unit changes from personal property to real property (a fixture) once it is attached to a building. Modernly, severance of a fixture from the realty would convert the fixture from real property back to personal property. However, the common law stated that if the severance and carrying away of a fixture were one continuous act, no larceny would occur. The defendant&#x27;s actions in this example would thus merely constitute damage to real property, and would further not result in possession of stolen property since no larceny had taken place. However, if the person disconnected the air conditioner, left the premises to find someone to help him move the unit, returned and loaded the unit on his truck and left, the crime would be larceny.

===Of another===
The property taken must be &quot;of another&quot;. Thus wild animals cannot be stolen, although possession of a wild animal can itself be unlawful. Nor can co-owners be guilty of larceny. Larceny is a crime against possession. Therefore, it is possible for the person who has title to the property to steal the property from a person who had lawful possession. For example, states provide that a person who repairs a car had a lien on the car to secure payment for the work. The lien is a possessory lien meaning the repair person has the lien as long as he maintains possession of the car. If the title owner were to take the car from the lienholder this action could be prosecuted as larceny in some jurisdictions.

===Without consent===
The taking must be trespassory; that is, it must be without the consent of the owner. This means that the taking must have been accomplished by stealth, force, threat of force, or deceit. If the offender obtained possession lawfully then a subsequent misappropriation is not larceny.

===Intent to steal (&quot;animus furandi&quot;)===

The offender must have taken the property with the intent to steal it. Traditionally intent to steal is defined as the intent to deprive the owner of the possession of the property permanently. &quot;Permanently&quot; means indefinitely, that is, with no plan to return the property to the rightful owner. However, intent to steal includes other states of mind such as the intent to recklessly deprive the owner of the property permanently.

A person who takes property of another under the mistaken belief that the property belongs to him does not have the requisite intent to steal; nor does a person &quot;intend to steal&quot; property when he takes property intending to make temporary use of it and then return the property to the owner within a reasonable time. However, it is not a defense that the defendant did not know that the property belonged to the true owner, only that he knew that it did not belong to him.

===Must have value===
Larceny protects the possession of goods – objects that have economic value. A good has economic value if it has a price; that is, the property can be sold in a market. Thus, if the property taken has no economic value, it is not subject to larceny statutes. Under contemporary larceny laws, it is normally sufficient to support a larceny charge if the item has any value to the owner, even if its market value would be negligible.

Under New York State law, written instruments, utility services, and items of unascertainable value have special rules, and for grand larceny in the fourth degree, a motor vehicle must have value of $100 or greater. Otherwise, value is defined generally as:
====Grand larceny====

Grand larceny is typically defined as larceny of a more significant amount of property. In the US, it is often defined as an amount valued at least $400. In New York, grand larceny refers to amounts of at least $1,000. Grand larceny is often classified as a felony with the concomitant possibility of a harsher sentence. In Virginia the threshold is only $5 if taken from a person, or $500 if not taken from the person. The same penalty applies for stealing checks as for cash or other valuables. Some states (such as North Carolina) use the term &quot;felonious larceny&quot; instead of grand larceny.

The classification of larceny as grand or petit larceny originated in an English statute passed in 1275 (&quot;grand&quot; is a French word meaning &quot;large&quot; while &quot;petit&quot; is a French word meaning &quot;small&quot;). Both were felonies, but the punishment for grand larceny was death while the punishment for petit larceny was forfeiture of property to the Crown and whipping. The classification was based on the value of the property taken. The offence was grand larceny if the value of the property taken was greater than twelve pence, approximately the value of a sheep in the thirteenth century.

Most jurisdictions have discarded the grand/petit terminology and use value to classify larcenies as felonies or misdemeanors. &quot;Value&quot; means the fair market value of the property at the time and place taken. Most jurisdictions also make certain larcenies felonies regardless of the value of the property taken. For example, North Carolina General Statutes Section 14 - 72 (b)(1) makes the crime of larceny a felony &quot;without regard to value&quot; if the larceny is (1) from the person (2) committed pursuant to certain types of breaking or enterings (3) of any explosive or incendiary device or (4) of any firearm. The modern spelling is &quot;petit larceny&quot; for the misdemeanor level. Some states may also charge certain types of larceny as &quot;robbery&quot;, &quot;burglary&quot;, &quot;theft&quot;, &quot;shoplifting&quot;, &quot;conversion&quot;, and other terms.

==Problem areas==

===Subject matter ===

As noted above one cannot steal items &quot;affixed to the earth&quot; because such things are not personal property. However, one of the remarkable qualities of property is its shiftiness: its ability to change its character often and quickly, from real to personal and from personal to real. The principal methods of achieving this transformation are attachment and severance. If personal property is attached to land, it becomes real property. And if real property is severed from the land (rendered unattached) it becomes personal property. Examples abound. A person buys a furnace. The furnace company dispatches a technician to deliver and install the heating system. Before installation the heating system is personal property. It has corporeal presence and it can be moved around as witnessed by the fact that the technician picked it up at the warehouse, loaded it into his truck, drove it to the house, unloaded it, placed it in the basement and hooked it up to the house. The &quot;hooking up&quot; is the act that transformed what was personal property to real property. Once it is installed it has become &quot;attached to the land&quot; (the house) and is now considered real property. The attachment to the house has to be more than casual for personal property to become real property. For example, a table lamp that is plugged into a wall socket is not real property. A window air conditioning unit is not real property.

===Comparison with embezzlement===
Embezzlement differs from larceny in two ways. First, in embezzlement, an actual &quot;conversion&quot; must occur; second, the original taking must not be trespassory. To say that the taking was not trespassory is to say that the person(s) performing the embezzlement had the right to possess, use, and/or access the assets in question, and that such person(s) subsequently secreted and converted the assets for an unintended and/or unsanctioned use. &quot;Conversion&quot; requires that the secretion interferes with the property, rather than just relocate it. As in larceny, the measure is not the gain to the embezzler, but the loss to the asset stakeholders. An example of &quot;conversion&quot; is when a person logs checks in a check register or transaction log as being used for one specific purpose and then explicitly uses the funds from the checking account for another and completely different purpose. It is important to make clear that embezzlement is not always a form of theft or an act of stealing, since those definitions specifically deal with taking something that does not belong to the perpetrator(s). Instead, embezzlement is, more generically, an act of deceitfully secreting assets by one or more persons that have been &quot;entrusted&quot; with such assets. The person(s) entrusted with such assets may or may not have an ownership stake in such assets.

In the case where it is a form of theft, distinguishing between embezzlement and larceny can be tricky. Making the distinction is particularly difficult when dealing with misappropriations of property by employees. To prove embezzlement, the state must show that the employee had possession of the goods &quot;by virtue of her employment&quot;; that is, that the employee had the authority to exercise substantial control over the goods. Typically, in determining whether the employee had sufficient control the courts will look at factors such as the job title, job description and the particular employment practices. For example, the manager of a shoe department at a store would likely have sufficient control over the shoes that if she converted the goods to her own use she would be guilty of embezzlement. On the other hand, if the same employee were to steal cosmetics from the cosmetic counter, so long as they did not convert the product, the crime would not be embezzlement but larceny. For a case that exemplifies the difficulty of distinguishing larceny and embezzlement see &quot;State v. Weaver&quot;, 359 N.C. 246; 607 S.E.2d 599 (2005).

====By trick====
Using confidence tricks (deception) to get possession of property is larceny.

Larceny by trick is descriptive of the method used to obtain possession. The concept arose from Pear&#x27;s Case decided in 1779. The issue was whether a person who had fraudulently obtained possession of personal property (a horse) could be convicted of larceny. The chief impediment to conviction was the doctrine of possessorial immunity which said that a person who had acquired possession lawfully, that is with the consent of the owner, could not be prosecuted for larceny. Clearly the owner of the horse had given the defendant possession of the animal – he had agreed that the defendant could borrow the horse to ride to Surrey. The case would seem to have been cut and dried – the doctrine of possessorial immunity applied and the defendant was therefore not guilty of larceny. The court held that consent induced by fraud was not consent in the eyes of the law. The fraudulent act that induced the owner to transfer possession &quot;vitiated&quot; the consent. This concept of consent broadened the scope of larceny. Before, consent meant the voluntary relinquishment of possession and thus property was wrongfully taken only if the defendant acquired possession by stealth, force or threat of force.

====By employees====

An employee is generally presumed to have custody rather than possession of property of his employer used during his employment. Thus the misappropriation would be larceny. However, officers, managers and employees who have significant authority over the disposition or use of the employer&#x27;s property have possession rather than custody and the misappropriation of the property would likely be embezzlement rather than larceny. Determining whether an employee has custody or possession can be difficult. A careful examination of the employee&#x27;s duties and responsibilities, his authority over the property and the actual business practices is required.

If a third party transfers possession of property to an employee for delivery to his employer, the employee has possession of the property and his conversion of the property would be embezzlement rather than larceny. For example, if a customer of a bank delivers money to a teller to deposit in the customer&#x27;s account, the teller had possession of the property and his misappropriation would be embezzlement rather than larceny. However, once the teller transfers possession of the money to his employer, by placing the money in the till for example, the subsequent taking would be larceny rather than embezzlement. This rule does not apply if the teller intending to steal the property places the money in the till merely as a temporary repository or to hide his peculation.

====Aggregation issues====

Thievery may well involve many items of personal property stolen from multiple victims. Questions arise as to whether such situations are to be treated as one large theft or multiple small ones. The answer depends on the circumstances. If a thief steals multiple items from one victim during a single episode the courts doubtlessly would treat the act as one crime. The same result would obtain if the thief stole items from the same victim over a period of time on the grounds that the stealing was pursuant to a common scheme or plan. The effect would be that the state could aggregate the value of the various items taken in determining whether the crime was a felony or misdemeanor. Such a result would not always work to the criminal&#x27;s detriment. Aggregation is also generally permitted when the thief steals property from multiple victims at the same time. For example, a thief steals &quot;rims&quot; from several cars parked in the same lot. On the other hand, aggregation is not permitted when a thief steals items from various victims at different times and places.

<doc id="161306" wikidata="Q1428292" url="?curid=161306" title="Sellmeier equation">
<text>The Sellmeier equation is an empirical relationship between refractive index and wavelength for a particular transparent medium. The equation is used to determine the dispersion of light in the medium.

It was first proposed in 1872 by Wolfgang Sellmeier and was a development of the work of Augustin Cauchy on Cauchy&#x27;s equation for modelling dispersion.

==Description==
In its original and the most general form, the Sellmeier equation is given as
:formula_1,
where &quot;n&quot; is the refractive index, &quot;λ&quot; is the wavelength, and &quot;B&quot;i and &quot;C&quot;i are experimentally determined &quot;Sellmeier coefficients&quot;. These coefficients are usually quoted for λ in micrometres. Note that this λ is the vacuum wavelength, not that in the material itself, which is λ/n. A different form of the equation is sometimes used for certain types of materials, e.g. crystals.

Each term of the sum representing an absorption resonance of strength &quot;B&quot;i at a wavelength . For example, the coefficients for BK7 below correspond to two absorption resonances in the ultraviolet, and one in the mid-infrared region. Analytically, this process is based on approximating the underlying optical resonances as dirac delta functions, followed by the application of the Kramers-Kronig relations. This results in real and imaginary parts of the refractive index which are physically sensible. However, close to each absorption peak, the equation gives non-physical values of &quot;n&quot;2 = ±∞, and in these wavelength regions a more precise model of dispersion such as Helmholtz&#x27;s must be used. 

If all terms are specified for a material, at long wavelengths far from the absorption peaks the value of &quot;n&quot; tends to
:formula_2
where εr is the relative permittivity of the medium.

For characterization of glasses the equation consisting of three terms is commonly used:

:formula_3

As an example, the coefficients for a common borosilicate crown glass known as &quot;BK7&quot; are shown below:
For common optical glasses, the refractive index calculated with the three-term Sellmeier equation deviates from the actual refractive index by less than 5×10−6 over the wavelengths&#x27; range of 365 nm to 2.3 μm, which is of the order of the homogeneity of a glass sample. Additional terms are sometimes added to make the calculation even more precise.

Sometimes the Sellmeier equation is used in two-term form:
:formula_4
Here the coefficient &quot;A&quot; is an approximation of the short-wavelength (e.g., ultraviolet) absorption contributions to the refractive index at longer wavelengths. Other variants of the Sellmeier equation exist that can account for a material&#x27;s refractive index change due to temperature, pressure, and other parameters.

==Derivation==
Analytically, the Sellmeier equation models the refractive index as due to a series of optical resonances within the bulk material. Its derivation from the Kramers-Kronig relations requires a few assumptions about the material, from which any deviations will affect the model&#x27;s accuracy:
*There exists a number of resonances, and the final refractive index can be calculated from the sum over the contributions from all resonances.
*All optical resonances are at wavelengths far away from the wavelengths of interest, where the model is applied.
*At these resonant frequencies, the imaginary component of the susceptibility (formula_5) can be modeled as a delta function.

From the last point, the complex refractive index (and the electric susceptibility) becomes:
:formula_6

The real part of the refractive index comes from applying the Kramers-Kronig relations to the imaginary part:

:formula_7

Plugging in the first equation above for the imaginary component:

:formula_8

The order of summation and integration can be swapped. When evaluated, this gives the following, where formula_9 is the Heaviside function:
:formula_10

Since the domain is assumed to be far from any resonances (assumption 2 above), formula_11 evaluates to 1 and a familiar form of the Sellmeier equation is obtained:
:formula_12 

By rearranging terms, the constants formula_13 and formula_14 can be substituted into the equation above to give the Sellmeier equation.

<doc id="161307" wikidata="Q180045" url="?curid=161307" title="Hirta">
<text>Hirta () is the largest island in the St Kilda archipelago, on the western edge of Scotland. The names (in Scottish Gaelic) and &quot;Hirta&quot; (historically in English) have also been applied to the entire archipelago. Now without a permanent resident population, the island had nearly all of St Kilda&#x27;s population of about 180 residents in the late 17th century and 112 in 1851. It was abandoned in 1930 when the last 36 remaining inhabitants were evacuated to Lochaline on the mainland.

The National Trust for Scotland owns the entire archipelago. It became one of Scotland&#x27;s six World Heritage Sites in 1986 and is one of the few in the world to hold mixed status for both its natural and cultural qualities. Visits to the island are encouraged during months when the few facilities for tourists are open.

==Geography==
The island measures from east to west, and from north to south. It has an area of and about of coastline. The only real landing place is in the shelter of Village Bay on the southeast side of the island. The island slopes gently down to the sea at Glen Bay (at the western end of the north coast), but the rocks go straight into the sea at a shallow angle and landing here is not easy if there is any swell at all. Apart from these two places, the cliffs rise sheer out of deep water. However, sea kayakers can also land for a break on a small boulder beach backed by cliffs in the north of the island, just before the northeast side where the highest summit in the island, Conachair, forms a precipice . St Kilda is probably the core of a Tertiary volcano, but, besides volcanic rocks, it contains hills of sandstone in which the stratification is distinct.

 is separated from Hirta by a shallow strait by (Caolas an Dùin) which is about wide; the strait is normally impassable and is reputed to dry out on rare occasions.

==Surrounding stacks==

Hirta is surrounded by a number of small stacks. , and lie under the cliffs of to the east and further south under the heights of . is west of and is further north under .

There are also various large stacks in the narrow strait between Hirta and Soay: , and .
==Etymology==
The origin of &quot;Hirta&quot; is open to interpretation. Martin (1703) states that &quot;Hirta is taken from the Irish , which in that language signifies west&quot;. Maclean offers several options, including an unspecified Celtic word meaning &quot;gloom&quot; or &quot;death&quot;, later suggested to be – dangerous or deathlike, or the Scots Gaelic (&quot;westland&quot;). Drawing on an Icelandic saga describing an early 13th-century voyage to Ireland that mentions a visit to the islands of &quot;Hirtir&quot;, he speculates that the shape of Hirta resembles a stag, ( meaning &quot;stags&quot; in Norse). Steel (1998) quotes the view of Reverend Neil Mackenzie, who lived there from 1829 to 1844, that the name is derived from the Gaelic (&quot;high island&quot;), and a further possibility that it is from the Norse (&quot;shepherd&quot;). In a similar vein, Murray (1966) speculates that the Norse (&quot;herd island&quot;, , ), may be the origin.

==History and lifestyle==
The St Kilda islands were continuously populated from prehistoric times. Archeologists working at the archipelago between 2017 and 2019 confirmed habitation as long as 2,000 years ago. Finds included Iron Age pottery and some potsherds that might be from Bronze Age pottery. The director of the project told BBC News that the work &quot;revealed that the eastern end of Village Bay on St Kilda was occupied fairly intensively during the Iron Age period, although no house structures were found&quot;.

In more recent history, Hirta was inhabited until 29 August 1930, when the 36 inhabitants were removed to the Scottish mainland at their own request.

St Kilda was part of the Lordship of the Isles, then a property of the MacLeods of Dunvegan from 1498 until 1930. There were three chapels on St Kilda, dedicated to Saint Brendan, Saint Columba, and Christ Church, but little remains. There are also the remains of a beehive house, known as the Amazon&#x27;s House.

According to UNESCO, &quot;St Kilda represents subsistence economies everywhere – living off the resources of land and sea and changing them over time, until external pressures led to decline&quot;. Indeed, the islanders had a tough life, and survived by exploiting the thousands of sea birds living on the islands. An 1885 report by a surgeon who visited Hirta reported that the inhabitants had no fruit or vegetables, except for a few potatoes of poor quality. They ate &quot;oatmeal, salted fowl, and seabird eggs during summer and salted mutton in winter. They obtained tea, sugar, flour and tobacco from tourists and from the owner&#x27;s factor&quot;. Water was obtained from freshwater springs. 

A history of Village Bay on Hirta states that some improvements in housing were made in the 1830s by the &quot;landlord and the Rev. Neil MacKenzie&quot;. The report adds that &quot;the old village further up the hill was replaced by a crescent of blackhouses ... Those were damaged by a hurricane, and in 1861, 16 new dwellings replaced the blackhouses which were relegated to byres&quot;. 

Missionaries provided education for many years but by 1872, the state took over; a true school building was eventually built.

A diary (now owned by the NTS) written by a school teacher who worked in Village Bay shed some light on life here in the early 1900s. One source offers this perspective about the island in that era: &quot;relatively speaking, a vibrant, well-connected and economically successful place thanks to a booming tourist trade and a buoyant market for the island’s tweed. Whaling boats brought supplies of coal and the government was able to provide more services for the islanders – visiting doctors had spent the two weeks ... vaccinating its residents – and the frequent presence of English fishing fleets meant they were better linked to the wider world than ever before&quot;.

Medical care was always limited. In the late 1890s, there was a single nurse stationed on the island, with limited medical supplies. That level continued until the contingent was increased in 1915.

In 1908, British Pathé News released a documentary film, &quot;The Island Of St. Kilda&quot;, which shed light on the lifestyle in Hirta during that era. The film is available for viewing on several Web sites.

A documentary film which included scenes and people in Hirta filmed primarily in 1923, was released in 1928. The summary for &quot;St Kilda, Britain&#x27;s Loneliest Isle&quot;, states: &quot;A voyage from Glasgow to St Kilda, containing scenes of the Western Isles and island life of the crofters on St Kilda&quot;. The film is available for viewing on a National Library of Scotland Web page which also includes a great deal of specifics in the text, in a &quot;Shotlist&quot;.

=== Declining population ===
In 1764 (according to the Census), there were 90 St Kildans, 105 in 1841, and 112 in 1851. The following year, 36 left for Australia, financed by the Highland and Island Emigration Society. By the 1861 census, the population was only 71; by 1911 it was 74, and 43 by 1927, declining to 36 by 1930.

=== First World War ===
Early in the First World War, the Royal Navy erected a signal station on Hirta, and the first daily communications with the mainland were established. In a belated response, the German submarine SM U-90 arrived in Village Bay on the morning of 15 May 1918 and, after issuing a warning, started shelling the island. One report states that &quot;the wireless station was destroyed. The manse, church &amp; jetty storehouse were damaged, but no loss of life occurred&quot;.

Another source offers this perspective about the significance of WW I: &quot;Ironically, things improved with the war, which brought a naval detachment and regular deliveries of mail and food from naval supply vessels. But when these services were withdrawn at end of the war, the sense of isolation increased. Able bodied young islanders left for a better life, resulting in a breakdown of the island economy&quot;.

===Evacuation and subsequent years===
Before the evacuation in 1930, thirteen men, ten women, eight girls and five boys lived in St Kilda, all on Hirta. The 10 households rented cottages from the landowner, with the other six cottages being unoccupied. The evacuation was encouraged by Williamina Barclay, the resident Queen&#x27;s Nurse, who was very concerned about health issues on Hirta, especially after the deaths of two young women. The islanders finally agreed and the majority signed a petition on 10 May 1930, stating that &quot;it would be impossible to stay on the island another winter.&quot; The plan was supported by Dugald Munro, the missionary and schoolteacher, and by Nurse Barclay.

The evacuation was completed on 29 August 1930, using HMS &quot;Harebell&quot; which took them to Lochaline, in the Morvern peninsula. One report provided this summary: 

The morning of the evacuation promised a perfect day. The sun rose out of a calm and sparkling sea and warmed the impassive cliffs of Oiseval. The sky was hopelessly blue and the sight of Hirta, green and pleasant as the island of so many careless dreams, made parting all the more difficult. Observing tradition the islanders left an open Bible and a small pile of oats in each house, locked all the doors and at 7 am boarded the &quot;Harebell&quot;. Although exhausted by the strain and hard work of the last few days, they were reported to have stayed cheerful throughout the operation. But as the long antler of Dun fell back onto the horizon and the familiar outline of the island grew faint, the severing of an ancient tie became a reality and the St Kildans gave way to tears.
A film made by a private individual in summer 1930 includes some scenes of the &quot;preparations and evacuation of the island&quot;. It is owned by the National Library of Scotland and available for viewing on their Web site.

According to the National Records of Scotland, &quot;officials found forestry work for the men, and most of them were settled at Lochaline near Oban, while other families went to live at Strome Ferry, Ross-shire, Culcabock near Inverness, and at Culross, Fife&quot;.

As of 1930, St Kilda was owned by Sir Reginald MacLeod of MacLeod and sold to the Earl of Dumfries, later Marquess of Bute, in 1931. He bequeathed it National Trust for Scotland in 1957. St Kilda was designated as Scotland&#x27;s first World Heritage Site in 1987. A few facilities for visitors are available on the island. The Ministry of Defence established a base on Hirta for tracking missiles fired from the station on South Uist.

===Military use===
In 1955, the British government decided to incorporate St Kilda into a missile tracking range based in Benbecula, where test firings and flights are carried out. A variety of military buildings and masts were erected, including a canteen (which is not open to the public), the Puff Inn. Some of the workers do live on the island throughout the year. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) leases St Kilda from the National Trust for Scotland for a nominal fee.

In summer 2018, the MOD facilities were being restored as part of building a new base; one report stated that the project included &quot;replacing aged generators and accommodation blocks&quot;. With no permanent population, the island population can vary between 20 and 70. These inhabitants include: MoD employees, National Trust for Scotland employees, and several scientists working on a Soay sheep research project.

==Tourism==
Visits by tourists in summer became quite common starting in the 1870s when steamships and private yachts began arriving. A new pier was built in 1901, making it easier to land passengers from the larger craft, using rowboats.


The remnants of the homes built in the early 1860s in Village Bay (also known as St Kilda Village) and the remnants of three old chapels, are readily visible. A tour operator&#x27;s Web site states that when facilities in Hirta are open, &quot;the St. Kilda museum, school and church provide a fascinating insight into the St Kildans’ way of life ... the remains of the village, the graveyard and Second World War gun&quot; can also be viewed.

The Historic Environment Scotland Web site adds that &quot;the plain, two-bay church, with the schoolroom added to its north west in 1898&quot; was &quot;restored as they might have appeared in the 1920s&quot;. The Web site also explains that the &quot;arrangement of St Kilda Village along a curving street is the result of mid-19th century improvement ... Distinctive drystone storage structures, known as cleitan, are scattered throughout the landscape. There are over 1,400 &quot;cleitan&quot; known throughout the St Kilda archipelago, but they are concentrated in the area around the village&quot;. (A cleit is a small stone building with a thatched roof that was used for drying and storing food.)

The NTS has improved the Village over the years. &quot;They have reroofed [some of] the cottages on the main street, restored the church, and restacked stones that years of gales had toppled from the cleits, or bothies, that dot the volcanic landscape&quot;, according to a November 2017 report. One cottage, #3 on &quot;The Street&quot;, was more extensively restored and turned into the museum.

Tourist trips to the island are readily available from several tour operators by boat.

<doc id="161310" wikidata="Q402047" url="?curid=161310" title="Richard K. Sutherland">
<text>Lieutenant General Richard Kerens Sutherland (27 November 1893 – 25 June 1966) was a United States Army officer during World War II. He served as General of the Army Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s Chief of Staff in the South West Pacific Area during the war.

==Early life and education==
Sutherland was born in Hancock, Maryland, on 27 November 1893, the only son among the six children of Howard Sutherland, who later became a US Senator from West Virginia, and Effie Harris Sutherland. Sutherland was raised and spent his adolescence and early adulthood in Elkins, West Virginia.

Sutherland was educated at Davis and Elkins College, Phillips Academy, from which he graduated in 1911, and Yale University, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1916.

While at Yale, Sutherland joined ROTC. In July 1916, he enlisted as a private in the Connecticut National Guard.

==Career==

===First World War===
Later that year, the National Guard was federalized and Sutherland served on the Mexican border during the Pancho Villa Expedition. The future general soon accepted a National Guard commission as a second lieutenant in the field artillery in August 1916. In December 1916, he transferred to the Regular Army with a commission as a first lieutenant in the Infantry branch. Sutherland was promoted to captain in 1917.

He served with the 2nd Division on the Western Front during World War I. Sutherland was a student at a tank school in England.

===Between the wars===

Returning to the United States, Sutherland married Josephine Whiteside in 1920. They had one child, a daughter named Natalie.

Sutherland was an instructor at the United States Army Infantry School from 1920 to 1923 and professor of military science and tactics at the Shattuck School from 1923 to 1928. He graduated from the Command and General Staff College in 1928. Fluent in French, Sutherland attended the &quot;École supérieure de guerre&quot; in 1930. During 1932 and 1933, he attended the U.S. Army War College. He then served with the Operations and Training Division of the War Department General Staff.

In 1937, Sutherland went to Tientsin, China, in command of a battalion of the 15th Infantry; however, he was not promoted to major until March 1938, when he was assigned to the Office of the Military Advisor to the Commonwealth Government (Philippines), Manila, under General Douglas MacArthur with the &quot;local rank&quot; of lieutenant colonel. Sutherland was promoted to the rank in July of that year. Sutherland soon eased his superior, Lieutenant Colonel Dwight D. Eisenhower out of his position and became MacArthur&#x27;s chief of staff.

===World War II===
As tensions with Japan rose, Sutherland rose rapidly in rank, receiving a promotion to full colonel, then to brigadier general in July 1941 and to major general, just a few months later, in December 1941, the same month of America&#x27;s entry into World War II.

Following the fall of Manila, MacArthur&#x27;s headquarters moved to the island fortress of Corregidor, where it was the target of numerous Japanese air raids, forcing the headquarters to move into the Malinta Tunnel. Sutherland was a frequent visitor to the front on Bataan. He was given a cash payment of $75,000 by President Quezon. In March 1942, MacArthur was ordered by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to relocate to Australia. Sutherland selected the group of advisers and subordinate military commanders that would accompany MacArthur and escape from the Philippines in four PT boats. Sutherland would remain MacArthur&#x27;s chief of staff for the entire war.

Sutherland attracted antagonism from subordinate American and Australian officers because of perceptions that he was high-handed and overprotective of MacArthur. Sutherland was often given the role of &quot;hatchet man&quot;. Bad news invariably came through Sutherland rather than from MacArthur himself.

According to some sources he contributed to a rift between MacArthur and the first SWPA air forces commander, Lieutenant General George Brett. Major General George Kenney, Brett&#x27;s successor, became so frustrated with Sutherland in one meeting, that Kenney drew a dot on a plain page of paper and said: &quot;the dot represents what you know about air operations, the entire rest of the paper what I know.&quot;

Sutherland had been taught to fly in 1940 by US Army Air Corps instructors at the Philippine Army Training Center and had been awarded a civil pilot&#x27;s license by the Civil Aeronautics Association. Flying then became one of his favourite recreational activities. Throughout the war, he flew often as a co-pilot with General MacArthur&#x27;s personal pilot, Weldon &quot;Dusty&quot; Rhoades. In March 1943 he asked to be formally recognised as a &quot;service pilot&quot;, a form of pilot restricted to non-combat duties. His request was turned down by the Commanding General of the U.S. Army Air Forces, General Henry H. Arnold on the grounds that he was over the age limit and not performing flying duties. However, Sutherland secured an official pilot&#x27;s rating under Philippine Army regulations in 1945.

In 1943 Sutherland and Kenney took part in an effort to promote General MacArthur&#x27;s candidacy for the Presidency, working with Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg of Michigan to get the War Department to rescind the order that prevented MacArthur from seeking or accepting political office.
It was Sutherland who represented MacArthur before the Joint Chiefs of Staff on this and other occasions. Sutherland opened, read, and frequently answered all communications with MacArthur, including those addressed to him personally or &quot;eyes only&quot;. Some decisions often attributed to MacArthur were actually taken by Sutherland. For example, the decision to bypass Mindanao and move on directly to Leyte was taken by Sutherland on MacArthur&#x27;s behalf, while MacArthur was traveling under radio silence.

Sutherland&#x27;s conduct in Washington enraged Army Chief of Staff General Marshall. He prepared a letter that he never sent to MacArthur saying Sutherland was &quot;totally lacking in the facility of dealing with others... He antagonized almost every official in the War Department with whom he came in contact and made our dealings with the Navy exceptionally difficult. Unfortunately he appears utterly unaware of the effects of his methods, but to put it bluntly, his attitude in almost every case seems to have been that he knew it all and nobody else knew much of anything.&quot;

When MacArthur discovered that Eisenhower had promoted his chief of staff, Walter Bedell Smith, to the rank of lieutenant general in January 1944, he immediately arranged for Sutherland to be promoted to the same rank.

====Affair with Elaine Clark====
During the time while MacArthur&#x27;s GHQ SWPA was located in Melbourne, Sutherland met Elaine Bessemer Clark, the socialite daughter of Norman Brookes. Her husband, a British Army officer, was serving overseas. When GHQ moved to Brisbane in July 1942, Clark moved with it, as did two other civilian women, Beryl Stevenson and Louise Mowat, who worked as secretaries for Generals Kenney and Richard Marshall respectively. Sutherland installed Clark as the receptionist at the AMP Building, where MacArthur had his headquarters.

When GHQ began planning to move forward to New Guinea, Sutherland requested personnel from the Women&#x27;s Army Corps to replace civilian employees of GHQ who, by agreement between MacArthur and the Prime Minister of Australia, John Curtin, could not be sent outside Australia. Sutherland further asked for direct commissions for Clark, Mowat and Stevenson. This exploited a loophole whereby enlistments in the Women&#x27;s Army Corps were restricted to American citizens, but officer commissions were not. Major General Miller G. White, the U. S. Army Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, and Colonel Oveta Culp Hobby, the commanding officer of the Women&#x27;s Army Corps, were strongly opposed; but they were overruled by Deputy Chief of Staff Joseph T. McNarney, on his being informed that the commissions were personally desired by MacArthur as essential to the operation of his headquarters and the prosecution of the war. Clark was commissioned as a captain, while the other two women, as well as General Eisenhower&#x27;s driver, Kay Summersby, were commissioned as first lieutenants.

Although her rank was more a reflection of Sutherland&#x27;s status rather than her own, Clark became an assistant to the headquarters commandant, with duties commensurate with her rank, and moved with Advance GHQ to Hollandia. However, her presence there, in contravention of MacArthur&#x27;s agreement with Curtin, brought down the displeasure of MacArthur, who ordered her to be returned to Australia, first from Hollandia, and later from the Philippines. That Sutherland defied MacArthur on this matter caused a rift between the two.

===Japanese surrender===

At the Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945, the Canadian representative, Colonel L. Moore Cosgrave, signed the Japanese Instrument of Surrender underneath, instead of on, the line for Canada. The Japanese drew attention to the error. Sutherland ran two strokes of his pen through the names of the four countries above the misplaced signatures and wrote them in where they belonged. The Japanese then accepted the corrected document.

==Later life and death==
Sutherland retired from the U.S. Army shortly after the Japanese surrender.

Returning home, he confessed his affair to Josephine and was ultimately reconciled with her. Letters from Clark were intercepted and destroyed by Natalie.

After the death of Josephine on 30 December 1957, he married Virginia Shaw Root in 1962.

Sutherland died at Walter Reed Army Medical Center on 25 June 1966. His funeral was held at the Fort Myer, Virginia chapel on 29 June 1966 and he is buried at Arlington National Cemetery along with other family members.
