<text>Manchester City Football Club is a professional football club based in Manchester, England, that competes in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. Founded in 1880 as St. Mark&#x27;s (West Gorton), they became Ardwick Association Football Club in 1887 and Manchester City in 1894. The club&#x27;s home ground is the Etihad Stadium in east Manchester, to which they moved in 2003, having played at Maine Road since 1923. Manchester City adopted their sky blue home shirts in 1894, the first season with the current name. Over the course of its history, the club has won ten league titles, seven FA Cups, eight League Cups, seven FA Community Shields, one UEFA Champions League, one European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, one UEFA Super Cup and one FIFA Club World Cup.

The club joined the Football League in 1892, and won their first major honour, the FA Cup, in 1904. Manchester City had its first major period of success in the late 1960s and early 1970s, winning the league title, FA Cup, League Cup, and European Cup Winners Cup under the management of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison. After losing the 1981 FA Cup final, Manchester City went through a period of decline, culminating in relegation to the third tier of English football for the only time in their history in 1998. They since regained promotion to the top tier in 2001–02 and have remained a fixture in the Premier League since 2002–03.

Manchester City received considerable financial investment both in playing staff and facilities following its takeover by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan through the Abu Dhabi United Group in August 2008. This started a new era of unprecedented success, with the club winning the FA Cup in 2011 and the Premier League in 2012, both their first since the 1960s, followed by another league title in 2014. Under the management of Pep Guardiola, Manchester City won the Premier League in 2018, becoming the only team in the competition history to attain 100 points in a single season. In 2018–19, they won four trophies, completing an unprecedented sweep of all domestic titles in England and becoming the first English men&#x27;s team to win the domestic treble. This was followed by four consecutive Premier League titles in 2020–21, 2021–22, 2022–23 and 2023–24, as well as the club&#x27;s first Champions League final in 2021, which they lost to Chelsea. The 2022–23 season saw Manchester City win the Champions League and complete the continental treble in the process, becoming the second English club to do so. The club was ranked first in the UEFA coefficient standings in 2023.

Manchester City topped the Deloitte Football Money League at the end of the 2021–22 season, making it the football club with the highest revenue in the world, approximated at €731 million. In 2022, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated the club was the sixth-most valuable in the world, worth $4.250 billion. Manchester City are owned by City Football Group Limited, a holding company valued at £3.73 ($4.8) billion in November 2019 and majority-owned by the Abu Dhabi United Group.

==History==
===Early years and first trophies===

City gained their first honours by winning the Second Division in 1899; with it came promotion to the highest level in English football, the First Division. They went on to claim their first major honour on 23 April 1904, beating Bolton Wanderers 1–0 at Crystal Palace to win the FA Cup; the Blues narrowly missed out on a League and Cup double that season after finishing runners-up in the league campaign, but they still became the first club in Manchester to win a major honour. In the seasons following the FA Cup triumph, the club was dogged by allegations of financial irregularities, culminating in the suspension of seventeen players in 1906, including captain Billy Meredith, who subsequently moved across town to Manchester United. A fire at Hyde Road destroyed the main stand in 1920, and in 1923 the club moved to their new purpose-built stadium at Maine Road in Moss Side.
In the 1930s, Manchester City reached two consecutive FA Cup finals, losing to Everton in 1933, before claiming the Cup by beating Portsmouth in 1934. During the 1934 run, the club broke the record for the highest home attendance of any club in English football history, as 84,569 fans packed Maine Road for a sixth-round FA Cup tie against Stoke City – a record which stood until 2016. The club won the First Division title for the first time in 1937, but were relegated the following season, despite scoring more goals than any other team in the division. Twenty years later, a City team inspired by a tactical system known as the Revie Plan reached consecutive FA Cup finals again, in 1955 and 1956; just as in the 1930s, they lost the first one, to Newcastle United, and won the second. The 1956 final, in which the Blues defeated Birmingham City 3–1, saw City goalkeeper Bert Trautmann continuing to play on after unknowingly breaking his neck.

===First golden era and subsequent decline===
After being relegated to the Second Division in 1963, the future looked bleak with a record low home attendance of 8,015 against Swindon Town in January 1965. In the summer of 1965, the management team of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison was appointed. In the first season under Mercer, Manchester City won the Second Division title and made important signings in Mike Summerbee and Colin Bell. Two seasons later, in 1967–68, City claimed the league championship for the second time, beating their close neighbours Manchester United to the title on the final day of the season with a 4–3 victory at Newcastle United. Further trophies followed: City won the FA Cup in 1969 and a year later triumphed in the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, defeating Górnik Zabrze 2–1 in the 1970 final. This was the club&#x27;s only European honour until their triumph in the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League. The Blues also won the League Cup that year, becoming the second English team to win a European trophy and a domestic trophy in the same season.

The club continued to challenge for honours throughout the 1970s, finishing one point behind the league champions on two occasions and reaching the final of the 1974 League Cup. One of the matches from this period that is most fondly remembered by supporters of Manchester City is the final match of the 1973–74 season against arch-rivals Manchester United, who needed to win to have any hope of avoiding relegation. Former United player Denis Law scored with a backheel to give City a 1–0 win at Old Trafford and confirm the relegation of their rivals. The final trophy of the club&#x27;s most successful period of the 20th century was won in 1976, when Newcastle United were beaten 2–1 in the League Cup final.
A long period of decline followed the success of the 1960s and 1970s. Malcolm Allison rejoined the club to become manager for the second time in 1979, but squandered large sums of money on several unsuccessful signings, such as Steve Daley. A succession of managers then followed – seven in the 1980s alone. Under John Bond, City reached the 1981 FA Cup final but lost in a replay to Tottenham Hotspur. The club were twice relegated from the top flight in the 1980s (in 1983 and 1987), but returned to the top flight again in 1989 under Mel Machin. Howard Kendall guided the club to top flight safety in 1990 and the club finished fifth in 1991 and 1992 under the management of active player Peter Reid. However, this was only a temporary respite, and following Reid&#x27;s departure Manchester City&#x27;s fortunes continued to fade. City were co-founders of the Premier League upon its creation in 1992, but after finishing ninth in its first season, Peter Swales, club chairman since 1973, was replaced by club legend Francis Lee in February 1994 in a movement supported by fans. Despite this, they endured three years of struggle under Brian Horton and Alan Ball Jr. before being relegated in dramatic fashion in 1996. After two seasons in the First Division and four different permanent managers, Lee resigned from his role as chairman midway through the 1998 season, although remained as a shareholder, as City fell to the lowest point in their history, becoming the second ever European trophy winners to be relegated to their country&#x27;s third-tier league after 1. FC Magdeburg of Germany.

===Recovery and two takeovers===
After relegation, the club underwent off-the-field upheaval, with new chairman David Bernstein introducing greater fiscal discipline. Under manager Joe Royle, City were promoted at the first attempt, achieved in dramatic fashion in the Second Division play-off final against Gillingham. A second successive promotion saw City return to the top division, but this proved to have been a step too far for the recovering club, and in 2001 City were relegated once more. Kevin Keegan replaced Royle as manager in the close season, and achieved an immediate return to the top division as the club won the 2001–02 First Division championship, breaking club records for the number of points gained and goals scored in a single season in the process. The 2002–03 season was the last at Maine Road and included a 3–1 derby victory over rivals Manchester United, ending a 13-year run without a derby win. Additionally, City qualified for European competition for the first time in 25 years via UEFA fair play ranking. In the close 2003–04 season, the club moved to the new City of Manchester Stadium. The first four seasons at the stadium all resulted in mid-table finishes. Former England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson became the club&#x27;s first foreign manager when appointed in 2007. After a bright start, performances faded in the second half of the season, and Eriksson was sacked on 2 June 2008; he was replaced by Mark Hughes two days later.

By 2008, Manchester City were in a financially precarious position. Thaksin Shinawatra had taken control of the club the year before, but his political travails saw his assets frozen. Then, in August 2008, City were purchased by the Abu Dhabi United Group. The takeover was immediately followed by a flurry of bids for high-profile players; the club broke the British transfer record by signing Brazilian international Robinho from Real Madrid for £32.5 million (€42.5 million). There was not a huge improvement in performance compared to the previous season despite the influx of money however, with the team finishing tenth, although they did well to reach the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup. During the summer of 2009, the club took transfer spending to an unprecedented level, with an outlay of over £100 million on players Gareth Barry, Roque Santa Cruz, Kolo Touré, Emmanuel Adebayor, Carlos Tevez, and Joleon Lescott. In December 2009, Mark Hughes – who had been hired shortly before the change in ownership but was originally retained by the new board – was replaced as manager by Roberto Mancini. City finished the season in fifth position in the Premier League, narrowly missing out on a place in the Champions League but qualifying for the UEFA Europa League.

===Second golden era and arrival of Pep Guardiola===
Continued investment in players followed in successive seasons, and results began to match the upturn in player quality. After heavy speculation, Roberto Mancini confirmed that a move of Edin Džeko from Wolfsburg for a fee of £27 million (€32 million) had been agreed on 3 January 2011. This was City&#x27;s second highest transfer figure, after Robinho&#x27;s move from Real Madrid for £32.5 million in 2008. The transfer fee was the sixth highest in the Premier League history at the time, and, the record departure transfer fee in the Bundesliga. City reached the FA Cup final in 2011, their first major final in over 30 years, after defeating derby rivals Manchester United in the semi-finals, the first time they had knocked their rival out of a cup competition since 1975. The Blues defeated Stoke City 1–0 in the final, securing their fifth FA Cup and the club&#x27;s first major trophy since winning the 1976 League Cup. On the last day of the 2010–11 season, City beat out Arsenal for the third place, thereby securing qualification directly into the Champions League group stage.
Strong performances continued to follow in the 2011–12 season, including a 5–1 victory over Tottenham at White Hart Lane and a record-equalling 6–1 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford, but a poor run of form in the second half of the season left City in second place, eight points behind United with only six games left to play. At this point, United suffered their own loss of form, dropping eight points in the space of four games, while City began a run of successive wins which saw both teams level on points with two games to go. Despite the Blues only needing a home win against Queens Park Rangers, a team in the relegation zone, they fell 1–2 behind by the end of normal time. However, two goals in injury time – the second by Sergio Agüero in the fourth added minute – settled the title in City&#x27;s favour, making them the first team to win the Premier League on goal difference alone.

The following season, City were unable to replicate the previous year&#x27;s success. After finishing second in the league, eleven points behind Manchester United, and losing the FA Cup final 0–1 to relegated Wigan Athletic, Mancini was sacked. He was replaced by Chilean manager Manuel Pellegrini. In Pellegrini&#x27;s first year in charge, City won the League Cup and regained the Premier League title on the last matchday of the season. The team&#x27;s league form then slowly declined over the next couple of years, as the Blues finished second in 2014–15 and then dropped to fourth in 2015–16, although the 2015–16 season would see City win another League Cup title and reach the Champions League semi-finals for the first time.
Pep Guardiola, former head coach of Barcelona and Bayern Munich, was confirmed to become Manchester City&#x27;s new manager on 1 February 2016, with the announcement having been made several months before Manuel Pellegrini left his position. Guardiola&#x27;s first season in Manchester would end trophyless, with the Blues placing third in the league standings, but the following season proved far more successful, as City won the Premier League title with the highest points total in history and broke numerous other club and English league records along the way.

This would prove to be the start of a period of unprecedented success for Manchester City under Guardiola. Between the 2017–18 and 2023–24 Premier League seasons, City won six out of possible seven league titles, only finishing second behind Liverpool in the 2019–20 season. Guardiola also guided the Blues to silverware in domestic cup competitions, highlighted by four consecutive League Cup triumphs in 2018–2021. During the 2018–19 season, City completed an unprecedented domestic treble of English men&#x27;s titles. Apart from winning all three of the major English football tournaments, they also won the Community Shield, the first time any team has ever held all four of England&#x27;s primary football trophies at the same time. On the continental stage, the club achieved breakthrough in 2020–21, reaching their first-ever Champions League final. In an all-English affair, City lost 0–1 to Chelsea at the Estádio do Dragão in Porto.
The 2022–23 season turned out to be the greatest in the club&#x27;s history, as Manchester City won their third consecutive Premier League title, the FA Cup final against rivals Manchester United, and their maiden Champions League title at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul against Inter Milan, thereby assembling a rare feat – the continental treble. The road to the Champions League victory included wins over European giants Bayern Munich, who were defeated 4–1 on aggregate, and Real Madrid, who suffered a 1–5 aggregate loss at the hands of City. The following season saw considerably less success for the Blues, as they won the UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup for the first time and became the first English men&#x27;s club to win four consecutive league titles. City also advanced to the FA Cup final for the second straight year but lost in a rematch to rivals Manchester United.

Manchester City&#x27;s era of sustained competitive excellence coincided with charges of breaching Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations. In 2020, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled that sanctions placed on the club by UEFA were not justified, overturning City&#x27;s two-year European ban. In 2023, the Premier League announced its own investigation of the allegations levied against Manchester City, charging the club with 115 breaches of its FFP rules up to the 2017–18 season.

===League history===

==Club badge and colours==
Manchester City&#x27;s home colours are sky blue and white. Traditional away kit colours have been either maroon or (from the 1960s) red and black; however, in recent years several colours have been used. The origins of the club&#x27;s home colours are unclear, but there is evidence that the club has worn blue since 1892 or earlier. A booklet entitled &quot;Famous Football Clubs – Manchester City&quot; published in the 1940s indicates that West Gorton (St. Marks) originally played in scarlet and black, and reports dating from 1884 describe the team wearing black jerseys bearing a white cross, showing the club&#x27;s origins as a church side. The infrequent yet recurrent use of red and black away colours comes from former assistant manager Malcolm Allison&#x27;s belief that adopting the colours of AC Milan would inspire City to glory. Allison&#x27;s theory seemingly took effect, with City winning the 1969 FA Cup final, 1970 League Cup final, and 1970 Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final in red and black stripes as opposed to the club&#x27;s home kit of sky blue.

City had previously worn three other badges on their shirts, prior to their current badge being implemented in 2016. The first, introduced in 1970, was based on designs which had been used on official club documentation since the mid-1960s. It consisted of a circular badge which used the same shield as the present badge (including a ship, based on the City of Manchester coat of arms), inside a circle bearing the name of the club. In 1972, this was replaced by a variation which replaced the lower half of the shield with the red rose of Lancashire. In 1976, a heraldic badge was granted by the College of Arms to the English Football League for use by City. The badge consisted of the familiar ship above a red rose but on a circular device instead of a shield (blazoned as &quot;A roundel per fess azure and argent in chief a three masted ship sails set pennons flying or in base a rose gules barbed and seeded proper&quot;).

On occasions when Manchester City played in a major cup final, the club wore shirts bearing the City of Manchester coat of arms, as a symbol of pride in representing the city at a major event. This practice originated from a time when the players&#x27; shirts did not normally bear a badge of any kind. The club has since abandoned the practice; for the 2011 FA Cup final, its first in the 21st century, City used the usual badge with a special legend, but the Manchester coat of arms was included as a small monochrome logo in the numbers on the back of players&#x27; shirts.

A new club badge was adopted in 1997, as a result of the previous badge being ineligible for registration as a trademark. This badge was based on the arms of the city of Manchester, and consisted of a shield in front of a golden eagle. The eagle is an old heraldic symbol of the city of Manchester; a golden eagle was added to the city&#x27;s badge in 1958 (but had since been removed), representing the growing aviation industry. The shield featured a ship on its upper half representing the Manchester Ship Canal, and three diagonal stripes in the lower half symbolised the city&#x27;s three rivers – the Irwell, the Irk and the Medlock. The bottom of the badge bore the motto &quot;Superbia in Proelio&quot;, which translates as &quot;Pride in Battle&quot; in Latin. Above the eagle and shield were the three stars, added for decorative purposes.

On 15 October 2015, following years of criticism from the fans over the design of the 1997 badge, the club announced they intended to carry out a fan consultation on whether to discontinue the current badge and institute a new design. After the consultation, the club announced in late November 2015 the badge would be replaced in due course by a new version which would be designed in the style of the older, circular variants. A design purporting to be the new badge was unintentionally leaked two days early prior to the official unveiling on 26 December 2015 by the IPO when the design was trademarked on 22 December. The new badge was officially unveiled at Manchester City&#x27;s home match against Sunderland on 26 December.

===Club captains===
This is a list of City&#x27;s official club captains, who are currently appointed via a vote of players and staff. Other players (vice-captains) have led the team on the pitch when the club captain is not playing or not available. Some players have been made captain on a one-off basis to celebrate or commemorate an event, e.g. Oleksandr Zinchenko captained the team in their 2021–22 FA Cup fifth round tie at Peterborough United in support of his country during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.


===Player of the Year===

Each season since the end of the 1966–67 season, the members of the Manchester City Official Supporters Club have voted by ballot to choose the player on the team they feel is the most worthy of recognition for his performances during that season. The following table lists the recipients of this award since 2000.

==Supporters==

Since moving to the City of Manchester Stadium, the club&#x27;s average attendances have been in the top six in England, usually in excess of 40,000. Even in the late 1990s, when City were relegated twice in three seasons and playing in the third tier of English football (then the Second Division, now the EFL League One), home attendances were in the region of 30,000, compared to an average of fewer than 8,000 for the division. Research carried out by Manchester City in 2005 estimated a fanbase of 886,000 in the United Kingdom and a total in excess of 2 million worldwide, although since the purchase of the club by Sheikh Mansour, and City&#x27;s recent achievements, that figure has since ballooned to many times that size.

Manchester City&#x27;s officially recognised supporters club is the Manchester City F.C. Supporters Club (1949), formed by a merger of two existing organisations in 2010: the Official Supporters Club (OSC) and the Centenary Supporters Association (CSA). City fans&#x27; song of choice is a rendition of &quot;Blue Moon&quot;, which despite its melancholic theme is belted out with gusto as though it were a heroic anthem. City supporters tend to believe that unpredictability is an inherent trait of their team, and label unexpected results &quot;typical City&quot;. Events that fans regard as &quot;typical City&quot; include the club being the only reigning English champions ever to be relegated (in 1938), the only team to score and concede over 100 goals in the same season (1957–58), or the more recent example where Manchester City were the only team to beat Chelsea in the latter&#x27;s record-breaking 2004–05 Premier League season, yet in the same season City were knocked out of the FA Cup by Oldham Athletic, a team two divisions lower.

In the late 1980s, City fans started a craze of bringing inflatable objects to matches, primarily oversized bananas. One disputed explanation for the phenomenon is that in a match against West Bromwich Albion, chants from fans calling for the introduction of Imre Varadi as a substitute mutated into &quot;Imre Banana&quot;. Terraces packed with inflatable-waving supporters became a frequent sight in the 1988–89 season, as the craze spread to other clubs (inflatable fish were seen at Grimsby Town), with the craze reaching its peak at City&#x27;s match at Stoke City on 26 December 1988, a game declared by fanzines as a fancy dress party. In 2010, Manchester City supporters adopted an exuberant dance, dubbed The Poznań, from fans of Polish club Lech Poznań that they played in the Europa League. In 2022, Manchester City proposed the release of the Connected Scarf, that would contain a sensor tracking physiological and emotional data of the wearer, for supporters in 2023.

==Rivalries==
Manchester City&#x27;s biggest rivalry is with neighbours Manchester United, against whom they contest the Manchester derby. Before the Second World War, when travel to away games was rare, many Mancunian football fans regularly watched both teams even if considering themselves &quot;supporters&quot; of only one. This practice continued into the early 1960s but as travel became easier, and the cost of entry to matches rose, watching both teams became unusual and the rivalry intensified. A common stereotype is that City fans come from Manchester proper, while United fans come from elsewhere. A 2002 report by a researcher at Manchester Metropolitan University found that while it was true that a higher proportion of City season ticket holders came from Manchester postcode areas (40% compared to United&#x27;s 29%), there were more United season ticket holders, the lower percentage being due to United&#x27;s higher overall number of season ticket holders (27,667 compared to City&#x27;s 16,481). The report noted that since the compiling of data in 2001, the number of both City and United season ticket holders had risen; expansion of United&#x27;s ground and City&#x27;s move to the City of Manchester Stadium have caused season ticket sales to increase further.

Over the last few years, Manchester City has also developed a notable rivalry with Liverpool, currently considered one of the biggest in association football. Though the two clubs had been involved in a title race in the 1976–77 season, Liverpool and City&#x27;s modern rivalry began in the 2010s, with the Blues beating Liverpool to the 2013–14 title by just two points on the final day of the season. In the final of the 2015–16 League Cup, City defeated Liverpool on penalties after a 1–1 draw. The two clubs met in European competition for the first time in the 2017–18 Champions League quarter-finals, where Liverpool won 5–1 on aggregate, ultimately reaching the final and then winning the competition a year later. In the 2018–19 season, City again won the title on the final day, with the Blues&#x27; 98 points and Liverpool&#x27;s 97 being the third- and fourth-highest Premier League points totals ever. The following season, Liverpool clinched the title, recording 99 points (the second-highest Premier League total ever after Manchester City&#x27;s 100 in 2017–18) to finish 18 points above runners-up City. The Blues then regained the title in 2020–21 and outgunned Liverpool in another closely-fought title race in 2021–22, to finish with 93 points to Liverpool&#x27;s 92.

The success of the two teams in the 2010s and 2020s has led to the development of a rivalry between Jürgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola, the managers of Liverpool and Manchester City, with the two previously having been the respective managers of &quot;Der Klassiker&quot; rivals Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga. At the end of the 2018–19 season, Guardiola described his relationship with Klopp as a &quot;beautiful rivalry&quot; and called Klopp&#x27;s Liverpool team &quot;the strongest opponents I have faced in my career as a manager&quot;. In September 2019, Klopp hailed Guardiola for being his &#x27;greatest rival ever&#x27;, after both were nominated for the FIFA Men&#x27;s Coach of the Year award in 2019, which Klopp ultimately won. In a 2019 survey, City fans answered that Liverpool, and not Manchester United, are the club&#x27;s biggest rivals.

Manchester City also have long established local rivalries with Bolton Wanderers, Oldham Athletic, and Stockport County, and more recent competitive Premier League rivalries with Tottenham Hotspur, Chelsea and Arsenal.

==Ownership and finances==

The holding company of Manchester City, Manchester City Limited, is a private limited company, with approximately 54 million shares in issue. The club has been in private hands since 2007, when the major shareholders agreed to sell their holdings to UK Sports Investments Limited (UKSIL), a company controlled by former Thailand prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. UKSIL then made a formal offer to buy the shares held by several thousands of small shareholders.

Prior to the Thaksin takeover, the club was listed on the specialist independent equity market PLUS (formerly OFEX), where it had been listed since 1995. On 6 July 2007, having acquired 75% of the shares, Thaksin de-listed the club and re-registered it as a private company. By August, UKSIL had acquired over 90% of the shares and exercised its rights under the Companies Act to &quot;squeeze out&quot; the remaining shareholders, and acquire the entire shareholding. Thaksin Shinawatra became chairman of the club and two of Thaksin&#x27;s children, Pintongta and Oak Chinnawat became directors. Former chairman John Wardle stayed on the board for a year, but resigned in July 2008 following Nike executive Garry Cook&#x27;s appointment as executive chairman in May. The club made a pre-tax loss of £11m in the fiscal year ending 31 May 2007, the final year for which the club published accounts as a public company.

Thaksin&#x27;s purchase prompted a period of transfer spending at the club, in total around £30 million, whereas over the several previous seasons Manchester City&#x27;s net spending had been among the lowest in the Premier League. A year later, this investment was dwarfed by an influx of money derived from the club&#x27;s takeover. On 1 September 2008, Abu Dhabi-based Abu Dhabi United Group Investment and Development Limited completed the takeover of Manchester City. The deal, worth a reported £200 million, was announced on the morning of 1 September. It sparked various transfer &quot;deadline-day&quot; rumours and bids such as the club&#x27;s attempt to gazump Manchester United&#x27;s protracted bid to sign Dimitar Berbatov from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in excess of £30 million. Minutes before the transfer window closed, the club signed Robinho from Real Madrid for a British record transfer fee of £32.5 million. The wealth of the new owners meant that, in the summer of 2009, City were able to finance the purchase of experienced international players prior to the new season, spending more than any other club in the Premier League.

==Stadium==

The City of Manchester Stadium in east Manchester, known as the Etihad Stadium since 2011 for sponsorship reasons, is on a 200-year lease from Manchester City Council to Manchester City. It has been the club&#x27;s home since the end of the 2002–03 season, when City moved from Maine Road. Before moving to the stadium, the club spent in excess of £30 million to convert it to football use: the pitch was lowered, adding another tier of seating around it, and a new North Stand was constructed. The inaugural match at the new stadium was a 2–1 win over Barcelona in a friendly match. A 7,000-seat third tier on the South Stand was completed in time for the start of the 2015–16 football season, increasing the stadium&#x27;s capacity to 55,097. A North Stand third tier is in development, potentially increasing capacity to around 61,000.

After playing home matches at five stadiums between 1880 and 1887, the club settled at Hyde Road Football Stadium, its home for 36 years. A fire destroyed the Main Stand in 1920, and the club moved to the 84,000 capacity Maine Road three years later. Maine Road, nicknamed the &quot;Wembley of the North&quot; by its designers, hosted the largest-ever crowd at an English club ground when 84,569 attended an FA Cup tie against Stoke City on 3 March 1934. Though Maine Road was redeveloped several times over its 80-year lifespan, by 1995 its capacity was restricted to 32,000, prompting the search for a new ground which culminated in the move to the City of Manchester Stadium in 2003; it was renamed the Etihad Stadium in 2011.

In September 2024, Manchester City revealed plans to expand the North Stand of the Etihad Stadium, increasing the total capacity to 61,000. The expanded section is scheduled to open for the start of the 2025–26 season. The project also includes the construction of a hotel, office premises for club staff and a new fan zone.

==Honours==

Based on trophy count, Manchester City are one of the most successful teams in England – their thirty-six major domestic, European and worldwide honours rank them third on the list of most decorated sides in England, ahead of Chelsea with 34.

The club&#x27;s first major trophy was the 1904 FA Cup, though they had previously won three regional Manchester Cups before that point. Their first top division league title came in the 1936–37 season, with the first Charity Shield won in the following August. City&#x27;s first League Cup and European trophy both came at the end of the 1969–70 season, the two trophies also constituting the team&#x27;s first double of any kind. In the 2018–19 season, City became the first team to claim all of the major English trophies available in a single season, winning not just the Premier League, FA Cup, and League Cup, but also the Community Shield.

The 1970 Cup Winners&#x27; Cup victory remained City&#x27;s only European trophy until their triumph in the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League. They have reached the semi-finals of the Champions League four times overall, losing in 2016, then winning en route to their first-ever final in 2021, losing in 2022, and winning en route to their maiden European Cup title in 2023.

Manchester City jointly held the record for most second division titles with Leicester City, both clubs having won the league on seven occasions, before Leicester clinched their eighth title in 2023–24. Man City&#x27;s first victory was in 1898–99, and the most recent in 2001–02.

<text>Robert Calvin Bland (born Robert Calvin Brooks; January 27, 1930 – June 23, 2013), known professionally as Bobby &quot;Blue&quot; Bland, was an American blues singer. Bland developed a sound that mixed gospel with the blues and R&amp;B. He was described as &quot;among the great storytellers of blues and soul music... [who] created tempestuous arias of love, betrayal and resignation, set against roiling, dramatic orchestrations, and left the listener drained but awed.&quot; The inspiration behind his unique style was a Detroit Preacher, CL Franklin, because Bland studied his sermons. He was sometimes referred to as the &quot;Lion of the Blues&quot; and as the &quot;Sinatra of the Blues&quot;. His music was influenced by Nat King Cole.

Bland was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1981, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992, and the Memphis Music Hall of Fame in 2012. He received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1997. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame described him as &quot;second in stature only to B.B. King as a product of Memphis&#x27;s Beale Street blues scene&quot;. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Bland at number 163 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Bland was born Robert Calvin Brooks in the small town of Barretville, Tennessee. His father, I. J. Brooks, abandoned the family not long after Robert&#x27;s birth. Robert later acquired the name &quot;Bland&quot; from his stepfather, Leroy Bridgeforth, who was also called Leroy Bland. Robert dropped out of school in third grade to work in the cotton fields and never graduated from school.

With his mother, Bland moved to Memphis in 1947, where he started singing with local gospel groups, including the Miniatures. Eager to expand his interests, he began frequenting the city&#x27;s famous Beale Street, where he became associated with a circle of aspiring musicians, including B.B. King, Rosco Gordon, Junior Parker and Johnny Ace, who collectively were known as the Beale Streeters.

===Early career===
In 1951, talent scout Ike Turner recorded Bland for Modern Records at Tuff Green&#x27;s house in Memphis. Because Bland was illiterate, they first recorded the one song he knew, &quot;They Call It Stormy Monday.&quot; While the recording was never released, Bland later recorded the song in 1961, which became one of his hit singles. Turner backed Bland on piano for his first two records, which were released under the name Robert Bland. Between 1951 and 1952, Bland recorded commercially unsuccessful singles for Modern and Sun Records (which licensed its recordings to Chess Records). However, these records caught the attention of Duke Records. Bland&#x27;s recordings from the early 1950s show him striving for individuality, but his progress was halted for two years while he served in the U.S. Army, during which time he performed in a band with the singer Eddie Fisher.

When Bland returned to Memphis in 1954, several of his former associates, including Johnny Ace, were enjoying considerable success. He joined Ace&#x27;s revue and returned to Duke Records, which was then being run by the Houston entrepreneur Don Robey. According to his biographer Charles Farley, &quot;Robey handed Bobby a new contract, which Bobby could not read, and helped Bobby sign his name on it&quot;. The contract gave Bland just half a cent per record sold, instead of the industry standard of 2 cents.

Bland released his first single for Duke in 1955. In 1956 he began touring on the Chitlin&#x27; Circuit with Junior Parker in a revue called Blues Consolidated, initially doubling as Parker&#x27;s valet and driver. He began recording for Duke with the bandleader Bill Harvey and the arranger Joe Scott, asserting his characteristic vocal style and, with Harvey and Scott, beginning to craft the melodic big-band blues singles for which he became famous, often accompanied by the guitarist Wayne Bennett. Unlike many blues musicians, Bland played no instrument.

===Commercial success===

Bland&#x27;s first chart success came in 1957 with &quot;Farther Up the Road&quot;, which reached number 1 on the R&amp;B chart and number 43 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It was followed by a series of hits on the R&amp;B chart, including &quot;Little Boy Blue&quot; (1958). He also recorded an album with Parker, &quot;Blues Consolidated&quot;, in 1958. Bland&#x27;s craft was most clearly heard on a series of early-1960s releases, including &quot;Cry Cry Cry&quot;, &quot;I Pity the Fool&quot; (number 1 on the R&amp;B chart in 1961) and &quot;Turn On Your Love Light&quot;, which became a much-covered standard. Despite credits to the contrary—often claimed by Robey—many of these classic works were written by Joe Scott. Bland also recorded a hit version of T-Bone Walker&#x27;s &quot;Call It Stormy Monday (But Tuesday Is Just as Bad)&quot;, which was erroneously given the title of a different song, &quot;Stormy Monday Blues&quot;.

His last record to reach number 1 on the R&amp;B chart was &quot;That&#x27;s the Way Love Is&quot;, in 1963, but he continued to produce a consistent run of R&amp;B chart entries through the mid-1960s. He barely broke into the mainstream market; his highest-charting song on the pop chart, &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nothing You Can Do&quot;, peaked at number 20 in 1964, in the same week in which the Beatles held down the top five spots. Bland&#x27;s records mostly sold on the R&amp;B market rather than achieving crossover success. He had 23 top ten hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart. In the book &quot;Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942–1995&quot;, by Joel Whitburn, Bland was ranked number 13 of the all-time top-charting artists.

===Later career===

Financial pressures forced the singer to cut his touring band and in 1968 the group broke up. He suffered from depression and became increasingly dependent on alcohol, but he stopped drinking in 1971. His record company, Duke Records, was sold to the larger ABC Records group. This resulted in several successful and critically acclaimed contemporary blues and soul albums including &quot;His California Album&quot; and &quot;Dreamer&quot;, arranged by Michael Omartian and produced by ABC staffer Steve Barri. The albums, including the later &quot;follow-up&quot; in 1977, &quot;Reflections in Blue&quot;, were recorded in Los Angeles and featured many of the city&#x27;s top session musicians at the time.

The first single released from &quot;His California Album&quot;, &quot;This Time I&#x27;m Gone for Good&quot; took Bland back into the pop Top 50 for the first time since 1964 and made the R&amp;B top 10 in late 1973. The opening track from &quot;Dreamer&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Love in the Heart of the City&quot;, was a strong R&amp;B hit. A version of it was released in 1978 by the hard-rock band Whitesnake, featuring the singer David Coverdale. Much later, Kanye West sampled it on Jay-Z&#x27;s hip-hop album &quot;The Blueprint&quot; (2001). The song is also featured on the soundtrack of the crime drama &quot;The Lincoln Lawyer&quot; (2011), starring Matthew McConaughey. The follow-up, &quot;I Wouldn&#x27;t Treat a Dog&quot;, was his biggest R&amp;B hit for some years, climbing to number 3 in late 1974, but it reached only number 88 on the pop charts. Subsequent attempts at adding a disco flavor were mostly unsuccessful. A return to his roots in 1980 for a tribute album to his mentor Joe Scott, produced by music veterans Monk Higgins and Al Bell, resulted in the album &quot;Sweet Vibrations&quot;, but it failed to sell well outside of his traditional &quot;chitlin circuit&quot; base.

In 1985, Bland signed a contract with Malaco Records, specialists in traditional Southern Black music, for which he made a series of albums while continuing to tour and appear at concerts with B. B. King. In the late &#x27;70s and throughout the &#x27;80s, most blues artists were performing for white audiences; however, Bland wanted to continue performing for African American audiences and felt that signing with Malaco Records would help him to do that. The two had collaborated on two albums in the 1970s. Despite occasional age-related ill health, Bland continued to record new albums for Malaco and perform occasional tours alone, with the guitarist and producer Angelo Earl and also with B. B. King, and performed at blues and soul festivals worldwide. In 1985, Bland&#x27;s album &quot;Members Only&quot; on Malaco reached number 45 on Billboard&#x27;s R&amp;B albums chart, and the title song reached number 54 for R&amp;B singles. It was his last chart single, and became Bland&#x27;s signature song for the rest of his career. Bland was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame described him as &quot;second in stature only to B. B. King as a product of Memphis&#x27;s Beale Street blues scene&quot;.

===Collaborations and tributes===
The Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison was an early adherent of Bland, covering &quot;Turn On Your Love Light&quot; while with the band Them (he later covered &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nothing You Can&#x27;t Do&quot; on his 1974 live album &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late to Stop Now&quot;), and Bland was an occasional guest singer at Morrison&#x27;s concerts. He also included a previously unreleased version of a March 2000 duet of Morrison and Bland singing &quot;Tupelo Honey&quot; on his 2007 compilation album, &quot;The Best of Van Morrison Volume 3&quot;.

In 2008 the British singer and lead vocalist of Simply Red, Mick Hucknall, released the album &quot;Tribute to Bobby&quot;, containing songs associated with Bland. The album reached 18 in the UK Albums Chart.

==Death ==
Bland died on June 23, 2013, at his home in Germantown, Tennessee, a suburb of Memphis, after what family members described as &quot;an ongoing illness.&quot; He was 83. He is interred at Memorial Park Cemetery in Memphis. He is survived by his wife, Willie Martin Bland, and his son Rodd, who is also a musician. After his death, Rodd told news media that Bland had recently told him that the blues musician James Cotton was Bland&#x27;s half-brother.

<text>A burqa or a burka (; ) is an enveloping outer garment worn by some Muslim women which fully covers the body and the face. Also known as a chadaree (; ) or chaadar (Dari: چادر) in Afghanistan, or a &quot;paranja&quot; (; ; ) in Central Asia, the Arab version of the burqa is called the &quot;boshiya&quot; and is usually black. The term &quot;burqa&quot; is sometimes conflated with the &quot;niqāb&quot; even though, in more precise usage, the niqab is a face veil that leaves the eyes uncovered, while a burqa covers the entire body from the top of the head to the ground, with a mesh screen which only allows the wearer to see in front of her.

The use of face veils has been documented in various ancient cultures, including the Byzantine Empire, Persia, Arabia, and ancient Palestine. Historical sources mention women’s practices of face veiling. Additionally, Biblical references in Genesis highlight the use of veils, indicating their significance in the cultural traditions of these regions. Coptic Orthodox Christian women traditionally wore dark garments with veils, white for the unmarried and black for the married.

Face veiling has not been regarded as a religious requirement by most Islamic scholars, either in the past or the present. While some interpret Quranic verses, such as 24:31 and 33:59, as encouraging modesty and security for women, most contemporary scholars agree that the burqa is not obligatory. For many women, wearing the burqa represents modesty, piety, and cultural identity, while others choose it as an expression of personal or religious commitment. A minority of scholars in the Islamic jurisprudence (&quot;fiqh&quot;) consider it to be obligatory for Muslim women when they are in the presence of non-related (i.e., non-) males. This is in order to prevent men from looking (perversely) at women. This aligns with the principles of Islamic jurisprudence, which requires men to observe modesty by lowering their gaze in the presence of women.

Women may wear the burqa for a number of reasons, including compulsion, as was the case during the Taliban&#x27;s first rule of Afghanistan. However, several countries have enacted full or partial bans on its use in public spaces. These include Austria, France, Belgium, Denmark, Bulgaria, the Netherlands (in public schools, hospitals and on public transport), Germany (partial bans in some states), Italy (in some localities), Spain (in some localities of Catalonia), Russia (in the Stavropol Krai), Luxembourg, Switzerland, Norway (in nurseries, public schools and universities), Canada (in the public workplace in Quebec), Gabon, Chad, Senegal, the Republic of the Congo, Cameroon (in some localities), Niger (in some localities), Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan (in public schools), Turkey (in the judiciary, military and police), Kosovo (in public schools), Bosnia and Herzegovina (in courts and other legal institutions), Morocco (ban on manufacturing, marketing and sale), Tunisia (in public institutions), Egypt (in universities), Algeria (in the public workplace), and China (in Xinjiang).

==Pre-Islamic use of the face veil==

The face veil was originally part of women&#x27;s dress among certain classes in the Byzantine Empire.

However, although Byzantine art before Islam commonly depicts women with veiled heads or covered hair, it does not depict women with veiled faces. In addition, the Greek geographer Strabo, writing in the 1st century AD, refers to some Persian women veiling their faces; and the early third-century Christian writer Tertullian clearly refers in his treatise &quot;The Veiling of Virgins&quot; to some &quot;pagan&quot; women of &quot;Arabia&quot; wearing a veil that covers not only their head but also the entire face. Clement of Alexandria commends the contemporary use of face coverings. There are also two Biblical references to the employment of covering face veils in Genesis 38:14 and Genesis 24:65, by Tamar and by Rebeccah, Judah and Abraham&#x27;s daughters-in-law respectively. These primary sources show that some women in Persia, Egypt, Arabia, and ancient Israel veiled their faces long before Islam. In the case of Tamar, the Biblical text, &#x27;When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a harlot; because she had covered her face&#x27; indicates customary, if not sacred, use of the face veil to accentuate rather than disguise sexuality.

Coptic Orthodox Christian women historically have worn dark-coloured full garments, along with a Christian head covering that included a veil to wear in public. Women who are unmarried wear white-coloured veils and married women wear black-coloured veils.

==Face veiling in Islam==

Despite legal requirements and prevalence in certain regions, many modern Islamic scholars and most contemporary Islamic jurists have said that Islam does not require women to cover their faces.

=== Scriptural sources ===

Although the Quran commands both men and women to behave modestly and contains no precise prescription for how women should dress, certain Quranic verses have been used in exegetical discussions of face veiling. Coming after a verse which instructs men to lower their gaze and guard their modesty, verse 24:31 instructs women to do the same, providing additional detail:

The verse goes on to list a number of other types of exempted males. Classical Quranic commentators differed in their interpretation of the phrase &quot;except what is apparent outwardly&quot;. Some said that it referred to face and hands, implying that these body parts need not be covered, while others disagreed.

Another passage, known as the &quot;mantle verse&quot; (33:59), has been interpreted as establishing women&#x27;s security as a rationale for veiling:

Based on the context of the verse and early Islamic literature, this verse has been generally understood as establishing a way to protect the Muslim women from a hostile faction who had molested them on the streets of Medina, claiming that they confused them with slave girls.

A sahih hadith (authentic tradition) elaborates the circumstances under which the verse was revealed and attributes it to Umar ibn al-Khattab for taunting one of Muhammad&#x27;s wives while she was walking. 

The exact nature of garments referred to in these verses, and , has been debated by traditional and modern scholars.

Islamic scholars who hold that face veiling is not obligatory also base this on a narration from one of the canonical hadith collections (sayings attributed to Muhammad), in which he tells Asma&#x27;, the daughter of Abu Bakr: &quot;O Asmaʿ, when a woman reaches the age of menstruation, it does not suit her that she displays her parts of body except this and this&quot;, pointing to her face and hands (Abū Dawūd, Book 32, Number 4092). According to Yusuf al-Qaradawi, traditional hadith scholars have not viewed this narration as providing proof on its own, because its recorded chain of transmission made them uncertain about its authenticity, but those who argued that face veiling is not required have used it as supporting evidence along other practices, such as those recording customary practice at the time of prophet Muhammad and his companions however it is argued that this because of the low resources and incapability at the time.

===Classical jurisprudence===

When veiling was discussed in early Islamic jurisprudence beyond the context of prayer, it was generally considered an &quot;issue of social status and physical safety&quot;. Later, during the medieval era, Islamic jurists began to devote more attention to the notion of (intimate parts) and the question of whether women should cover their faces. The majority opinion which emerged during that time, predominant among Maliki and Hanafi jurists, held that women should cover everything except their faces in public. In contrast, most medieval Hanbali and Shafi&#x27;i (two of the four islamic madhabs) jurists counted a woman&#x27;s face among the (parts that shouldn&#x27;t be shown), concluding that it should be veiled, except for the eyes. The Hanbali jurist Ibn Taymiyyah (d. 1328 CE) was an influential proponent of the latter view, while the Hanafi scholar Burhan al-Din al-Marghinani (d. 1197 CE) stressed that it was particularly important for a woman to leave her face and hands uncovered during everyday business dealing with men. There was a difference of opinion on this question within the legal schools. Thus, Yusuf al-Qaradawi quotes Shafi&#x27;i and Hanbali jurists stating that covering the face is not obligatory.

In the Shi&#x27;a Ja&#x27;fari school of , covering the face is not obligatory.

===Salafi views===

According to the Salafi point of view, it is obligatory () for a woman to cover her entire body when in public or in presence of non-mahram (i.e men who aren&#x27;t their husbands and intermediate family) men. Some interpretations say that a veil is not compulsory in front of blind men.

The Salafi scholar Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani wrote a book expounding his view that the face veil is not a binding obligation upon Muslim women, while he was a teacher at Islamic University of Madinah. His opponents within the Saudi establishment ensured that his contract with the university was allowed to lapse without renewal.

===Reasons for wearing===
Reasons for wearing a burqa vary. A woman may choose to wear it to express her piety, modesty, political views, and cultural views among other reasons. A woman may also wear a burqa on being forced to do so by law, such as in the case of Afghanistan during the first period of Taliban rule.

==Around the world==

===Africa===
====Cameroon====

In July 2015, Cameroon&#x27;s Far North Region banned Islamic face veils, including the burqa, after two female suicide bombers in burqa detonated themselves in Fotokol, killing 13. The ban is now active in five of the country&#x27;s ten regions.

====Chad====

In June 2015, the full face veil was banned in Chad after veiled Boko Haram members disguised as women committed multiple suicide bombings in N&#x27;Djamena.

====Republic of the Congo====

In May 2015, the Republic of the Congo banned the face veil citing security reasons. The decision was announced by El Hadji Djibril Bopaka, the president of the country&#x27;s Islamic High Council who stated that &quot;some non-Muslims have been using the full veil to hide and to carry out uncivic acts&quot;.

==== Gabon ====

In 2015, Gabon banned the face veil in public and places of work. The authorities said the move was intended to &quot;prevent the risk of suicide attack&quot;.

==== Morocco ====

The government distributed letters to businesses on 9 January 2017 declaring a ban on the sale, production and importation of burqas. The letters indicated that businesses were expected to clear their stock within 48 hours.

===Asia===
====Afghanistan====
The full Afghan chadaree covers the wearer&#x27;s entire face except for a small region about the eyes, which is covered by a concealing net or grille. They are usually light blue in the Kabul area, white in the north in Mazar-i-Sharif and brown and green in Kandahar in the south.

Before the Taliban took power in Afghanistan, the chadaree was rarely worn in cities, especially Kabul. While they were in power, the Taliban required the wearing of a chadaree in public. Chadaree use in the remainder of Afghanistan is variable and was observed to be gradually declining in Kabul, until the city fell to the Taliban on 15 August 2021. Due to political instability in these areas, women who might not otherwise be inclined to wear the chadaree must do so as a matter of personal safety, according to Khalid Hanafi. The Taliban, immediately after re-taking Afghanistan, declared that while women may return to work, they must always wear the hijab while outside the house, while the chadaree was not mandatory. In May 2022 the Taliban issued a decree that all women in public must wear a chadaree.

====China====
In 2017, China banned the burqa in the Muslim area of Xinjiang.

====India====

Among the Muslim population in India (about 14.2% as of the 2011 census), the burqa (, ) was formerly common in many areas, such as Old Delhi, for example. In Nizamuddin Basti, the obligation of a woman to wear a burqa is dependent on her age, according to a local informant: young, unmarried women or young, married women in their first years of marriage are required to wear the burqa. However, after this the husband usually decides if his wife should continue to wear a burqa. In addition, the Indian burqa is a slim black cloak different from the style worn in Afghanistan.

====Israel====
A group of Haredi (ultra-Orthodox) Jewish women in Israel began to don the Burqa as a symbol of piety. Following its adoption by Bruria Keren, an Israeli religious leader who taught a strict interpretation of Jewish scripture to female adherents, an estimated 600 Jewish women started to wear the veil. Keren claimed to have adopted wearing the burqa to &quot;save men from themselves. A man who sees a woman&#x27;s body parts is sexually aroused, and this might cause him to commit sin. Even if he doesn&#x27;t actually sin physically, his impure thoughts are sin in themselves&quot;. However, a rabbinical authority said &quot;There is a real danger that by exaggerating, you are doing the opposite of what is intended [resulting in] severe transgressions in sexual matters&quot;, and issued an edict declaring burqa-wearing a sexual fetish, and as promiscuous as wearing too little.

According to &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;, in 2010, Marina Solodkin, a member of the Knesset, intended to put forward a bill to &quot;prohibit the wearing of a full-body and face covering for women. [The] bill would not differentiate between Muslims and Jews&quot;.

==== Sri Lanka ====

In April 2019, face-covering clothing was banned in Sri Lanka in the aftermath of the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings by jihadists.

====Syria====
Syria was a Ba&#x27;athist state and discouraged the wearing of hijab. Ghiyath Barakat, Syria&#x27;s minister of higher education, announced that the government would ban students, teachers or staff from covering faces at universities, stating that the veils ran counter to &quot;secular and academic principles of the country&quot;.

==== Tajikistan ====

In 2017 the government of Tajikistan passed a law requiring people to &quot;stick to traditional national clothes and culture&quot;, which has been widely seen as an attempt to prevent women from wearing Islamic clothing, in particular the style of headscarf wrapped under the chin, in contrast to the traditional Tajik headscarf tied behind the head.

===Europe===

====Austria====
In 2017, a legal ban on face-covering clothing in public spaces was adopted by the Austrian parliament including Islamic face-covering garments. The government stated that accepting and respecting Austrian values is essential to the peaceful co-existence between the Austrian majority population and immigrants. The ban came into force on 1 October 2017 and carried a fine of 150 euros. It is reported that there are 150 Austrian women who wear the burqa.

====Belgium====
On 29 April 2010, the lower house of parliament in Belgium passed a bill banning any clothing that would obscure the identity of the wearer in places like parks and in the street. The proposal was passed without dissent, and was then also passed by the Senate. BBC News estimated that only &quot;around 30 women wear this kind of veil in Belgium, out of a Muslim population of around half a million&quot;. The ban came into effect in Belgium in July 2011. On 11 July 2017, the ban was upheld by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) after having been challenged by two Muslim women who claimed their rights had been infringed.

====Bulgaria====
The Parliament of Bulgaria outlawed the wearing of any clothing &quot;that partially or completely covers the face&quot; in public places such as government offices, educational and cultural institutions, and places of public recreation, except for health or professional reasons from 30 September 2016. Anyone who violates the law is liable to a fine of up to 1,500 levs (US$860). The Muslim community makes up 15% of the Bulgarian population of 7.1 million.

==== Denmark ====
In autumn 2017, the Danish government agreed to adopt a law prohibiting people to wear &quot;attire and clothing masking the face in such a way that it impairs recognizability&quot;. A full ban on both niqabs and burqas was announced on 31 May 2018. The ban came into force on 1 August 2018 and carries a fine of 1000 DKK, then about 134 euro; repeat offenses are punishable with fines up to 10,000 DKK. The law targets all garments that cover the face, such as fake beards or balaclavas. Supporters of the ban claim that the ban facilitates integration of Muslims into Danish society, while Amnesty International claimed the ban violated women&#x27;s rights. On the date the law came into force, a protest numbering 300-400 people was held in Copenhagen&#x27;s Nørrebro district organised by Socialist Youth Front, and &quot;Party Rebels,&quot; with protesters wearing various head coverings including party masks.

====France====

Wearing the burqa has not been allowed in French public schools since 2004, when it was judged to be a religious symbol, similar to the Christian cross, and was outlawed for wear within schools as an application of an established 1905 law that prohibits students and staff from wearing any clearly visible religious symbols. The law relates to the time where the secular French state took over control of most schools from the Catholic Church; it does not apply to private or religious schools. This was followed on 22 June 2009, when the then-President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, said that burqas were &quot;not welcome&quot; in France, commenting that &quot;In our country, we cannot accept that women be prisoners behind a screen, cut off from all social life, deprived of all identity&quot;. The French National Assembly appointed 32 lawmakers from right- and left-wing parties to a six-month fact-finding mission to look at ways of restricting its use. On 26 January 2010, the commission reported that access to public services and public transport should be barred to those wearing the burqa. On 13 July 2010, the Assembly overwhelmingly approved a bill banning burqas and niqabs.

On 14 September 2010, the French Senate overwhelmingly approved a ban on burqas in public, with the law becoming effective beginning on 11 April 2011. When the measure was sent in May to the parliament, it was stated that &quot;Given the damage it produces on those rules which allow the life in community, ensure the dignity of the person and equality between sexes, this practice, even if it is voluntary, cannot be tolerated in any public place&quot;.

The ban is officially called &quot;The bill to forbid concealing one&#x27;s face in public&quot;. &quot;It refers neither to Islam nor to veils. Officials insist the law against face-covering is not discriminatory because it would apply to everyone, not just Muslims. They cite a host of exceptions, including motorcycle helmets, or masks for health reasons, fencing, skiing or carnivals&quot;.

In 2014, the European Court of Human Rights upheld the French ban on burqa, accepting the argument of the French government that the law was based on &quot;a certain idea of living together&quot;.

In 2022, France&#x27;s top administrative court ruled against allowing body-covering &quot;burkini&quot; swimwear in public pools for religious reasons, arguing that it violates the principle of government neutrality toward religion.

====Germany====
In a 2016 speech, accepting her nomination for reelection, the German chancellor Angela Merkel called for banning the burqa in Germany &quot;wherever legally possible&quot;, which was interpreted as support for the earlier proposal by Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière to outlaw full-face veils in public buildings. The announcement was seen as an attempt to counter public anger at Merkel&#x27;s handling of the migrant crisis and electoral gains by the anti-immigration AfD party. In 2017, a legal ban on face-covering clothing for soldiers and state workers during work was approved by the German parliament. Also in 2017, a legal ban on face-covering clothing for car and truck drivers was approved by the German Ministry of Traffic. In July 2017 the state of Bavaria approved a ban on face-covering clothing for teachers, state workers and students at university and schools.

In August 2017, the state of Lower Saxony banned the burqa along with the niqab in public schools. This change in the law was prompted by a Muslim pupil in Osnabrück who wore the garment to school for years and refused to take it off. The law was instituted to prevent similar cases in the future following the completion of her schooling.

In July 2020, the state of Baden-Württemberg banned face-covering veils for pupils, an extension of the ban already in force for school staff.

====Italy====
In Italy, by an anti-terrorism law passed in 1975, it is forbidden to wear any dress that hides the face of a person. At that time, Italy was facing domestic (not Islam-related) terrorism. In May 2010, it was reported that a Tunisian woman was fined €500 for this offence.

====Latvia====
In 2016, it was wrongly claimed in foreign media that a legal ban of face-covering Islamic clothing was adopted by the Latvian parliament. After long public discussions draft legislation was approved by Latvian government on 22 August 2017; however, it was never adopted by the parliament as a law.

====Malta====
Malta has no restrictions on Islamic dressing such as the veil (hijab) nor the full face veil (burqa and/or niqab) but strictly speaking face covering is illegal. An official ban on face covering for religious reasons is ambiguous. It is guaranteed that individuals are allowed to wear as they wish at their private homes and at the Mosque. Imam El Sadi stated his belief that banning of the niqab and the burka &quot;offends Muslim women&quot;. Elsadi said that the Malteses&#x27; attitude towards Muslim women is positive and, despite cultural clashes, they tolerate the dressing. Some Muslim women share the belief that it is sinful to be seen in public without veiling themselves; however, they are legally required to remove it when needed.

====Netherlands====
On 27 January 2012, a bill was agreed upon by the Dutch cabinet, banning any clothing that would hide the wearer&#x27;s identity, with potential fines for wearing a burqa in public going up to 380 euros. However, it did not pass in Parliament. In October 2012, this law was mitigated by the succeeding cabinet to pertain only to public transport, health care, education and government buildings, rather than all public spaces.

On 22 May 2015, a bill was agreed upon by the Dutch cabinet, banning wearing a burqa in public places. Public places would have included public transportation, educational institutes, public health institutes, and government buildings. In the courtroom, a burqa or a niqab could not be worn, with both allowed in public spaces. Police officers could have requested one to remove face-covering clothing for identification purposes. There were exceptions, such as during carnival or other festivities, and when face-covering clothing was necessary as a sports or job requirement. Opposition party D66 commented on the burqa abolishment as tokenism, while PVV labelled the ban unsatisfactory. Minister of Internal Affairs, Plasterk, has stated that setting a norm is important.

The May 2015 bill did not pass either, but a new bill was proposed in November 2015, which was eventually made into law. On 26 June 2018, a partial ban on face covering (including burqas) on public transport and in buildings and associated yards of educational institutions, governmental institutions and healthcare institutions was enacted, with a number of exceptions. From 1 August 2019 a national burka ban was introduced in the Netherlands.

, 200-400 Dutch women were believed to wear a burqa or niqab.

====Norway====
In June 2018, the parliament of Norway passed a bill banning clothing covering the face at educational institutions as well as daycare centres, which included face-covering Islamic veils. The prohibition applies to pupils and staff alike.

==== Sweden ====
In December 2019, the municipality of Skurup banned Islamic veils in educational institutions. Earlier, the municipality of Staffanstorp approved a similar ban. The ban was overturned by the Supreme Administrative Court in December 2022 since it was deemed to be a violation religious freedoms as defined in the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression.

In 2012, a poll by Uppsala University found that Swedes responded that face-covering Islamic veils are either completely unacceptable or fairly unacceptable, 85% for the burqa and 81% for the niqab. The researchers noted these figures represented a compact resistance to the face-covering veil by the population of Sweden.

====Switzerland====
The burqa was outlawed in the canton of Ticino after a citizen initiative to hold a referendum. With 65% in favour of a ban, it was ruled that the ban was constitutional, and took effect in July 2016. Those who violate the law face a fine of up to CHF 10,000.

In September 2018, a ban on face-covering veils was approved with a 67% vote in favour in the canton of St. Gallen. The largest Islamic community organisation in Switzerland, the Islamic Central Council, recommended that Muslim women continue to cover their faces.

During the federal votation of the 7 March 2021 regarding the prohibition of face-covering, the Swiss people voted for the prohibition. The question submitted for the referendum was initiated from a right-wing political group affiliated with the Swiss People&#x27;s Party. Although very few women in Switzerland actually wear a burqa or niqab, the proposition has been made with the intention to forbid these outfits in public spaces. 51.4% of the population participated in the vote, 51.2% of them agreed with the initiative.

====United Kingdom====

Face veils have caused debate in the United Kingdom. Former Labour party MP for Blackburn Jack Straw attracted controversy in 2006 after asking Muslim women from his constituency to remove any veils covering their faces during face-to-face constituency surgeries. Despite explaining to the media that a female staffer would remain in the room during any potential meeting, reaction was varied, with some Muslim groups saying that they understood his concerns, and others rejecting his request as prejudicial. A poll in 2011 indicated that 66 per cent of British people supported banning the burqa in all public places. However, a ban on burqas was ruled out by the Conservative government, and in 2018 Theresa May stated &quot;we do not support a ban on the wearing of the veil in public&quot;.

===Oceania===
====Australia====

In 2010, Australian Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi called for the burqa to be banned in Australia, branding it &quot;un-Australian&quot;. The ban did not go ahead, but the debate about the burqa continues.

In 2011, Carnita Matthews of Sydney was sentenced to six months jail for making a statement accusing a police officer of attempting to forcibly lift her niqab, which news sources initially referred to incorrectly as a burqa. The officer had pulled her over for a random breath test and then ticketed her for a licence infringement. Matthews allegedly then submitted a signed complaint to a police station while wearing a niqab. Judge Clive Jeffreys overturned the conviction in June 2011, citing what he thought were differences between the signature on her license and that on the complaint. She then proceeded to seek legal costs. Matthews was subsequently revealed to have a considerable record of unpaid fines and licence revocations that cast doubt on her character.

On 4 July 2011, New South Wales became the first Australian state to pass laws allowing police to demand that burqas (and other headgear such as motorcycle helmets) be removed when asking for identification.

In October 2014, the Speaker of the House and President of the Senate at Parliament House in Canberra decreed that female visitors wearing a face covering would have to sit in the separated glassed-in areas of the public gallery normally reserved for schoolchildren. This was in response to a planned disruptive action by a political activist group. Prime Minister Tony Abbott stated that he opposed this restriction. The decision was subsequently reversed.

In August 2017, Senator Pauline Hanson arrived at the Senate wearing a burqa in protest, calling for the garment to be banned. Following the incident, ReachTEL polled 2,832 Australians and found that 56.3% supported banning the wearing of the burqa in public places.

===Canada===
====Quebec====
On June 16, 2019, Bill 21 was passed which banned all religious symbols in the public sector for those in a position of authority i.e teachers, police officers, judges and lawyers amongst others. It also banned the face veil (niqab, burqa) when receiving public services. It has so far been upheld by the courts due to the passing of the notwithstanding clause.

<doc id="165830" wikidata="Q178134" url="?curid=165830" title="The Isley Brothers">
<text>The Isley Brothers ( ) are an American soul group originally from Cincinnati, Ohio, that began as a vocal trio consisting of the brothers O&#x27;Kelly Isley Jr., Rudolph Isley and Ronald Isley in the 1950s. With a career spanning over seven decades, the group has enjoyed one of the &quot;longest, most influential, and most diverse careers in the pantheon of popular music&quot;.

Together with a fourth brother, Vernon, the group performed gospel music until Vernon&#x27;s death a few years after its formation. After moving to New York City in the late 1950s, the group had their first successes during these early years, and rose to prominence in 1959 with their fourth single, &quot;Shout&quot;, written by the three brothers, which became their first single to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and sold over a million copies. In the 1960s, the group recorded songs for a variety of labels, including the top 20 single &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; and the Motown single &quot;This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)&quot;, before recording and releasing the Grammy Award-winning hit &quot;It&#x27;s Your Thing&quot; on their own label, T-Neck Records.

The inclusion of younger brothers Ernie Isley (lead guitar, drums) and Marvin Isley (bass guitar), and Rudolph&#x27;s brother-in-law Chris Jasper (keyboards, synthesizers), in 1973 turned the original vocal trio into a complete band and led to the group&#x27;s reaching the height of their success. For the next full decade, they recorded a string of top-selling albums including &quot;3 + 3&quot;, &quot;Between the Sheets&quot;, and &quot;The Heat Is On&quot;, with the latter peaking at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. The six-member band splintered in 1983, with Ernie, Marvin, and Chris Jasper forming the short-lived spinoff group Isley-Jasper-Isley. The oldest member, O&#x27;Kelly, died in 1986. Afterwards Rudolph and Ronald released a pair of albums as a duo before Rudolph retired to a life in the Christian ministry in 1989. After multiple lineup changes, the remaining duo of Ronald and Ernie achieved mainstream success with the albums &quot;Mission to Please&quot; (1996), &quot;Eternal&quot; (2001) and &quot;Body Kiss&quot; (2003). &quot;Eternal&quot; spawned the top 20 hit &quot;Contagious&quot;. , the Isley Brothers continue to perform under the lineup of Ronald and Ernie.

The Isley Brothers have sold over 18 million units in the United States alone. With their first major hit charting in 1959 (&quot;Shout&quot;), and their last one in 2001 (&quot;Contagious&quot;), they are among the few groups ever to have hit the Billboard Hot 100 with new music in six different decades and the only act in musical history to have achieved this accomplishment in consecutive decades (1950s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, and 2000s). Sixteen of their albums charted in the Top 40 and thirteen of those albums have been certified gold, platinum or multi-platinum by the RIAA. The brothers have been honored by several musical institutions, including the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which inducted them in 1992. Five years later, they were added to Hollywood&#x27;s Rockwalk, and in 2003 they were inducted to the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. They received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2014.

==Career==

===Origins and initial recordings===
The Isley Brothers originally came from Cincinnati, Ohio, and were raised in the city&#x27;s Lincoln Heights suburb, settling in the satellite town of Blue Ash when they were teenagers. Their father, O&#x27;Kelly Isley Sr., a former United States Navy sailor and vaudeville performer from Durham, North Carolina, and their mother Sallye, from Georgia, guided the elder four Isley boys in their singing in church. The brothers began performing together in 1954, patterning themselves after groups such as Billy Ward and His Dominoes and The Dixie Hummingbirds. Eventually, they landed a spot on Ted Mack&#x27;s &quot;Amateur Hour&quot;, where they won the competition (their prize was a watch). With Vernon singing lead vocals, the quartet soon began touring all over the eastern US, performing in a variety of churches. When Vernon was thirteen, he was killed by a car that struck him as he was riding his bike in his neighborhood. Devastated, the remaining trio disbanded.

Eventually persuaded to regroup, with Ronnie assuming the lead vocal position, the brothers decided to record popular music and left Cincinnati for New York in 1957 with their parents&#x27; blessings. The group got in touch with Richard Barrett, who soon had them in contact with a variety of New York record producers. They eventually had their first recorded songs produced by George Goldner, including &quot;Angels Cried&quot; and &quot;The Cow Jumped Over the Moon&quot; for the Teenage, Cindy, and Mark X imprints. The songs were only regional hits, however. By 1959, the group had landed a recording deal with RCA Victor. Later that year, the group recorded their first composition together, &quot;Shout&quot;, mixing their brand of gospel vocals and doo-wop harmonies, a song derived from a Washington, D.C., club performance in which the brothers had covered Jackie Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Lonely Teardrops&quot;. The original version of the song peaked at number 47 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and never reached the R&amp;B chart. Nevertheless, it sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. 

Follow-up recordings on RCA Victor failed to chart and the brothers were dropped by the label in 1961 and were later signed by Scepter Records. In 1962, the Isley Brothers scored their first top 40 hit with the Bert Berns song &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;, which reached number 17 on the Hot 100 and number 2 on the R&amp;B chart, staying on the charts for 19 weeks. The song had been produced by Berns for the brothers to teach then-struggling producer Phil Spector how to produce a hit.

Moving their entire operations to New Jersey, the brothers continued to struggle with recordings, and formed T-Neck Records in 1964. 

In February or March 1964, at the recommendation of a former associate of Joe Tex, Ronnie Isley granted guitarist Jimi Hendrix (who would later become famous as a solo artist) an audition that led to an offer to become the guitarist with the Isley Brothers&#x27; backing band, the I.B. Specials, which he readily accepted. In March, Hendrix recorded the two-part single &quot;Testify&quot; with the Isley Brothers. Released in June, it failed to chart. Hendrix toured with the Isleys during much of 1964, but near the end of October, after growing tired of playing the same set every night, he left the band. (Soon afterward, Hendrix joined Little Richard&#x27;s touring band, the Upsetters.

In late July 1965 (or August 1965), Hendrix then briefly rejoined the Isley Brothers, recording a second single with them, &quot;Move Over and Let Me Dance&quot; backed with &quot;Have You Ever Been Disappointed&quot;; the single was recorded for and released by T-Neck and distributed by Atlantic Records. Later that year, Hendrix joined a New York-based R&amp;B band, Curtis Knight and the Squires, after meeting Knight in the lobby of a hotel where both men were staying, before eventually launching a successful solo career.

After both songs failed to chart and Hendrix left the Isleys for good in 1965, the brothers signed with Motown Records. Early the following year, the group released their second Top 40 hit single, &quot;This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)&quot;. While the Isley Brothers&#x27; recordings with Motown were more successful than their earlier works, they struggled to score a follow-up Top 40 hit with the label. They left Motown in 1968.

===Major success===
Resurrecting their T-Neck label that year, the brothers signed a distribution deal with Buddah Records and issued &quot;It&#x27;s Your Thing&quot; in February 1969. The song, which featured the first appearance of Ernie Isley on bass, became their biggest success to date, reaching number 2 on the Hot 100 and number 1 on the R&amp;B chart. The song&#x27;s parent album, &quot;It&#x27;s Our Thing&quot;, reached number 22 on the Pop LP chart, and &quot;It&#x27;s Your Thing&quot; became the group&#x27;s second million-seller and won them a Grammy Award. The release of &quot;It&#x27;s Your Thing&quot; brought record label conflicts between the Isleys and Motown, as Motown argued that the group had recorded the song while still under their Motown contract. A 1975 court decision found in the Isleys&#x27; favor.

In June 1969, the brothers independently recorded their concert at Yankee Stadium which featured an array of artists. The live album &quot;Live at Yankee Stadium&quot; was released later that year. They also filmed the concert which was released as a documentary titled &quot;It&#x27;s Your Thing&quot; in theaters in August 1970.

By 1971, the younger Isley brothers Ernie and Marvin and their brother-in-law Chris Jasper started to add to the band&#x27;s music, first performing on the Isleys&#x27; &quot;Givin&#x27; It Back&quot;. The album featured reinterpretations of rock songs mixing them with funk and gospel elements. The new members played an even bigger role in the 1972 album, &quot;Brother, Brother, Brother&quot;. Both albums yielded Top 40 hits, including &quot;Love the One You&#x27;re With&quot; and &quot;Pop That Thang&quot;. By the end of their Buddah tenure in 1973, the brothers had signed a distribution deal with Epic Records and made Ernie, Marvin, and Chris official members. In 1973, the Isleys released &quot;3 + 3&quot;, which included the Top 10 hit single &quot;That Lady&quot; and a UK Top 10 cover of &quot;Summer Breeze&quot;. Incorporating hard rock and folk-rock as well as funk and soulful balladry, the album became their breakthrough hit, eventually selling over two million copies.

The following year, the album &quot;Live It Up&quot; also reached platinum. In 1975, the brothers made one of their most successful recordings, &quot;The Heat Is On&quot;, which featured the hits &quot;Fight the Power&quot; and &quot;For the Love of You&quot;, and became their first album to reach number 1 on the Pop LP chart, going double-platinum at two million copies sold. The brothers would have more hit albums, including &quot;Harvest for the World&quot; (1976), &quot;Go for Your Guns&quot; (1977), and &quot;Showdown&quot; (1978), all of which went platinum, and yielded several Top 40 pop and R&amp;B singles and popular radio cuts. By 1979, with the release of &quot;Winner Takes All&quot;, the brothers had incorporated disco and quiet storm music into their work. The Isley Brothers&#x27; final album under their six-member lineup, &quot;Between the Sheets&quot; (1983), sold more than two million copies. 

By then, financial struggles, creative difficulties, and other issues affected the group. Shortly after the success of &quot;Between the Sheets&quot;, Ernie, Marvin, and Chris left the Isley Brothers and formed Isley-Jasper-Isley. They later recorded the hit &quot;Caravan of Love&quot;.

===Later years===

In 1985, the original Isleys trio of O&#x27;Kelly, Rudy, and Ronnie signed with Warner Bros. Records and recorded and released the album &quot;Masterpiece&quot;. Shortly a year after its release, Kelly Isley died from a heart attack while battling cancer, in March 1986. The remaining duo of Ron and Rudy released the Angela Winbush-produced albums, &quot;Smooth Sailin&#x27;&quot; in 1987 and &quot;Spend the Night&quot; in 1989. Shortly after the latter release, Rudy retired from the music industry and followed life in the ministry. 

Ron put the group on a brief hiatus in 1990 while he recorded solo material. In 1991, Ron revived the group; Ernie Isley and brother Marvin returned to the fold. that year they released the album, &quot;Tracks of Life&quot;. Five years later, Ron Isley gained popularity as video villain Frank Biggs (or Mr. Biggs) in the music video for R. Kelly&#x27;s hit &quot;Down Low (Nobody Has to Know)&quot;, which included the Isley Brothers as featured artists. The success of the song and its video helped the brothers&#x27; 1996 album &quot;Mission to Please&quot; reach platinum status.

That same year, Marvin Isley&#x27;s career ended after a bout with diabetes forced him to have both of his legs amputated. Ron and Ernie have carried on as a duo from then on. In 2001, the duo released their best-selling album in years with the &quot;Eternal&quot; album, which sold over two million copies and featured the top 20 hit single &quot;Contagious&quot;, making the Isley Brothers the only act to reach the Hot 100 (in fact, that chart&#x27;s top 50) during the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. Two years later, the brothers&#x27; &quot;Body Kiss&quot; album peaked at number-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, becoming their second to reach the position and the first to do so since &quot;The Heat Is On&quot;. Their next two released albums included 2006&#x27;s &quot;Baby Makin&#x27; Music&quot; and the 2007 holiday album &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Home for Christmas&quot;. 

In 2007, the Isleys&#x27; career was interrupted by Ron Isley&#x27;s three-year prison sentence for tax evasion. He was released in 2010. In June of that year, youngest brother Marvin Isley died in Chicago after his longtime bout with diabetes. During the group&#x27;s hiatus, Ernie toured as part of the &quot;Experience Hendrix&quot; concert festival, while Ron Isley released his first solo album, &quot;Mr. I&quot;, in 2010. A year later, Ron and Ernie reunited and have since performed on the road.

In 1993, the Isley Brothers song &quot;Footsteps in the Dark&quot; was sampled by hip-hop artist Ice Cube for the hit single &quot;It Was a Good Day&quot;.

In 1994, the Isley Brothers song &quot;Between the Sheets&quot; was sampled by The Notorious B.I.G. for his hit single &quot;Big Poppa&quot;. That same year, R&amp;B singer Aaliyah included a cover version of &quot;(At Your Best) You Are Love&quot; on her debut album, &quot;Age Ain&#x27;t Nothing but a Number&quot;. &quot;Luxurious&quot;, the fifth single from No Doubt frontwoman Gwen Stefani&#x27;s 2004 multi-platinum solo debut &quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot; also benefited from a prominent sample of &quot;Between the Sheets&quot;.

After the break-up of Isley-Jasper-Isley in 1987, Chris Jasper continued as a solo artist, multi-instrumentalist, and producer, forming his own independent record label, Gold City Records. He has since released 14 solo albums, including 4 gospel albums. He released the #1 R&amp;B hit &quot;Superbad&quot; in 1988, a song which emphasized the importance of education, a theme Jasper continues to emphasize in many of the songs he has written since his days with the Isleys. In January 2013, Jasper released &quot;Inspired: By Love, By Life, By the Spirit&quot;, a compilation of love songs as well as socially conscious and spiritual tracks. In May 2014, Jasper released &quot;The One&quot;, reminiscent of the soulful R&amp;B and funk music he wrote for the Isleys. In 2016, Jasper released &quot;Share With Me&quot;, which included a cover of the Billy Preston hit, &quot;You Are So Beautiful&quot; and a track called &quot;America&quot;, a tribute to the nation and a call to come together. In April 2018, Jasper pre-released a double-A single &quot;The Love That You Give/It&#x27;s a Miracle&quot; from his 15th solo album &quot;Dance With You&quot;, scheduled for a July 2018 release.

Jasper, who earned a Juris Doctor in 2004, has continued to write, record, and perform all the music on his solo albums and produce artists for his Gold City label, including Liz Hogue, Out Front, and Brothaz By Choice. The most recent addition to the Gold City label is Jasper&#x27;s son, Michael Jasper, a songwriter, recording artist and screenplay writer, who earned his law degree in 2018. In 1989, Chris Jasper wrote, produced and performed on &quot;Make It Last&quot; for Chaka Khan&#x27;s &quot;CK&quot; album. In 2015, in conjunction with Sony Music, Jasper released the &quot;Essential Chris Jasper&quot; which encompasses all of the tracks that Jasper sang lead on during his Isley-Jasper-Isley years and solo career at CBS/Sony Music. In 2015, he received the German Record Critics Lifetime Achievement Award (&quot;Preis der deutschen Schallplattenkritik&quot;). In 2016, Jasper was awarded the National R&amp;B Society Lifetime Achievement Award.

In 2017, the Isley Brothers (Ernie and Ronnie) collaborated with guitarist Santana (led by its namesake and founder Carlos Santana) and released &quot;Power of Peace&quot;, released on July 28 by Sony Music&#x27;s Legacy Recordings. In 2019, Ron and Ernie Isley received the National R&amp;B Music Society&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award and Proclamations from the City of Atlantic City, while on stage in Atlantic City, NJ. In 2021 the brothers participated in a Verzuz with fellow R&amp;B band Earth, Wind &amp; Fire hosted by Steve Harvey, to celebrate both bands contributions to R&amp;B &amp; Pop music and African American culture.

On September 30, 2022, the Isley Brothers released a new album, titled &quot;Make Me Say It Again, Girl&quot;.

<doc id="165832" wikidata="Q704718" url="?curid=165832" title="Doc Pomus">
<text>Jerome Solon Felder (June 27, 1925 – March 14, 1991), known professionally as Doc Pomus, was an American blues singer and songwriter. He is best known as the co-writer of many rock and roll hits. Pomus was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a non-performer in 1992, the Songwriters Hall of Fame (1992), and the Blues Hall of Fame (2012).

==Early life==
Jerome Solon Felder was born on June 27, 1925, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York. He was the son of British born Jewish immigrants. Having contracted polio as a boy, he was in an iron lung for a year, and walked with the aid of crutches. Later, due to post-polio syndrome exacerbated by an accident, Felder relied on a wheelchair. 

Pomus was homeschooled for much of elementary and junior high school. He had a high IQ, and excelled at the insult challenge among teens and young men, &quot;playing the dozens&quot;. He also was facile at creating his own lyrics for blues songs of the day. He became a fan of the blues after hearing a Big Joe Turner record, &quot;Piney Brown Blues&quot;, which changed the direction of his life. He attended Bushwick High School and then Brooklyn College, where he studied music and learned to play piano and saxophone, from 1943 to 1945. 

His brother is New York attorney Raoul Felder.

==Career==

=== Performing career ===
Using the stage name Doc Pomus, the teenage Felder began performing as a blues singer. His stage name was not inspired by anyone in particular; he just thought it sounded better for a blues singer than Jerry Felder, though it included a “nod” to blues singer Doctor Clayton. He began going to Jazz clubs before working up the nerve to perform in front of mostly black audiences, doing his version of popular blues songs that were received with great enthusiasm by club patrons. The 18 year old Pomus debuted at George&#x27;s Tavern in Greenwich Village. Clubs would invite him to perform, and on one occasion the great saxophonist Lester Young sat in with him. 

Pomus stated that more often than not, he was the only Caucasian in the clubs, but that as a Jew with polio, he felt a special underdog kinship with African Americans, while in turn the audiences respected his courage and were impressed by his talent. Pomus performed as a singer for 10-12 years around metropolitan New York (1944-1954), heading a band that included Mickey Baker and King Curtis. Gigging at clubs in and around New York City, Pomus often performed with Milt Jackson, Horace Silver, Buddy Tate, Baker, and Curtis. Pomus is reported to have recorded more than fifty record sides of music, though others have reported the number at about forty sides, as a singer in the 1940s and 1950s for Chess, Apollo, Dawn, Gotham, and other recording companies (such as Savoy, Atlantic and Coral). 

In his early thirties, Pomus’ song “Heartlessly” was being played by disc jockey Alan Freed. Once the company with rights to the song learned about Pomus’ life and circumstances, they had no interest in promoting his singing career, and he realized he would need another way to make a living. He stopped performing live in 1957. 

=== Songwriter ===
In 1946, Gatemouth Moore had recorded one of Pomus&#x27; own songs for National Records. In 1947, he became one of Atlantic Records original songwriters. In the early 1950s, Pomus began writing magazine articles, as well as songwriting for Lavern Baker, Ruth Brown, Ray Charles, and Big Joe Turner (whose music had changed Pomus&#x27; life). Charles’ 1956 recording of the R&amp;B top ten song &quot;Lonely Avenue&quot; marked a national breakthrough for Pomus, though he made little money. 

In 1957, he married an aspiring Broadway actress from Westville, Illinois, named Willi Burke. (She later performed in the Broadway play &quot;Fiorello&quot;.) They were divorced in 1966. 

His first rock and roll songwriting break came when the Coasters recorded a hit with the song &quot;Young Blood&quot;. He had sent a demo of the song to Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, his role models for this new kind of songwriting. They substantially rewrote the song for the Coasters, and Pomus only first heard about its being recorded by playing it on a jukebox. Still, Pomus had co-credit as lyricist, and soon received a royalty check for $2,500 (US$ in dollars) (reported elsewhere as $1,500), an event that convinced him that songwriting was a career worth pursuing. By 1957, Pomus had given up performing in favor of songwriting.

Pomus collaborated with pianist Mort Shuman, whom he met when Shuman was dating Pomus&#x27;s younger cousin. Songwriter Otis Blackwell introduced the duo to Hill &amp; Range Music Co./Rumbalero Music at its offices in New York City&#x27;s Brill Building. Pomus asked Shuman to write with him because Pomus did not know much about contemporary rock and roll, whereas Shuman was acquainted with popular artists of the day. For the most part, Pomus wrote the lyrics while Shuman composed the melodies, but they often collaborated on both aspects of their songs. Together they wrote &quot;A Teenager in Love&quot;, &quot;Save the Last Dance for Me&quot;, &quot;Hushabye&quot;, &quot;This Magic Moment&quot;, &quot;Turn Me Loose&quot;, &quot;Sweets For My Sweet&quot; (a hit for The Drifters, and later The Searchers), &quot;Go, Jimmy, Go&quot;, &quot;Little Sister&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Used to Losing You&quot;, &quot;Suspicion&quot;, &quot;Surrender&quot;, and &quot;(Marie&#x27;s the Name of) His Latest Flame&quot;. They wrote regularly for Elvis Presley and The Drifters, and wrote hits for others, such as Bobby Darin, Dion and the Belmonts, and Fabian. Pomus&#x27; innovation in writing his early rock song lyrics was focusing on the realities and difficulties of being a teenager, rather than trying to paint an idealized teenage life. 

&quot;Save the Last Dance for Me&quot; has been called his crowning achievement. The lyrics came to him at his wedding, watching his wife dance with others, Pomus being unable to dance because of polio&#x27;s effects on his body. The song has been performed by singers as diverse as country singer Eric Church and jazz guitarist Bill Frisell, and it was a top ten country hit for both Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris. It is said to be the last song Leonard Cohen ever performed on stage.

Phil Spector became a protege of Pomus. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Pomus wrote several songs with Spector (&quot;Young Boy Blues&quot;, &quot;Ecstasy&quot;, &quot;First Taste of Love&quot; and &quot;What Am I To Do?&quot;), Mike Stoller and Jerry Leiber (&quot;Young Blood&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s Not You&quot;), and other Brill Building-era writers.

=== Later life ===
With the advent of the Beatles, the days of the Brill Building type songwriter-for-hire in rock and roll were numbered. While he continued writing and had sporadic success, Pomus&#x27; main means of income for years was as a professional gambler, which he left after ten years as it was becoming too violent a world. Late in his life, his income increased from royalty payments when more performers started covering his songs. 

In the 1970s and 1980s, in his eleventh-floor, two-room apartment at the Westover Hotel at 253 West 72nd Street, Pomus wrote songs with Dr. John, Ken Hirsch, and Willy DeVille for what he said were &quot;... those people stumbling around in the night out there, uncertain or not always so certain of exactly where they fit in and where they were headed.&quot; These later songs (&quot;There Must Be A Better World&quot;, &quot;There Is Always One More Time&quot;, &quot;That World Outside&quot;, &quot;You Just Keep Holding On&quot;, and &quot;Something Beautiful Dying&quot;)—recorded by Willy DeVille, B.B. King, Irma Thomas, Marianne Faithfull, Charlie Rich, Ruth Brown, Dr. John (Mac Rebennack), James Booker, Jimmy Witherspoon, and Johnny Adams—are considered by some, including writer Peter Guralnick, musician and songwriter Dr. John, and producer Joel Dorn, to be signatures of Pomus&#x27;s best craft. B. B King&#x27;s recording of &quot;There Must Be A Better World Somewhere&quot; won a Grammy in 1981. Pomus also played an important role with John Belushi in creating the back-up band for the Blues Brothers in the 1970s, and was Bette Midler&#x27;s musical advisor, bringing her to national attention.

Pomus also focused in later life on helping forgotten R&amp;B artists who had fallen on hard times. The Rhythm and Blues Foundation provides artist grants through The Doc Pomus Artist Assistance Fund.

=== Influence on other performers ===
John Lennon told Pomus the first song the Beatles practiced together was a Pomus song. Bob Dylan came to Pomus when Dylan was experiencing writer&#x27;s block. Later in Pomus&#x27; life, performers as diverse as Bruce Springsteen and Dolly Parton covered his songs, and others like Dr. John and Lou Reed became a part of his life. In July 1985, Ben E. King (the original singer of Save The Last Dance for Me), Dr. John, DeVille, and Marshall Crenshaw performed in a tribute program to Pomus in New York. After his death, a tribute album was produced in 1995, &quot;Till the Night Is Gone: A Tribute to Doc Pomus&quot;, that included Dylan, King, Rebennack, Reed, Thomas, John Hiatt, Shawn Colvin,Solomon Burke, and Los Lobos.

The documentary film &quot;A.K.A. Doc Pomus&quot; (2012), conceived by Pomus&#x27;s daughter Sharyn Felder, directed by filmmaker Peter Miller, edited by Amy Linton, and produced by Felder, Hechter, and Miller, presents Pomus&#x27;s biography.

== Death ==
Pomus died on March 14, 1991, of lung cancer at the age of 65 at NYU Medical Center in Manhattan.

==Legacy and influence==

Together with Shuman, and individually, Pomus was a key figure in the development of popular music. The duo co-wrote such hits as &quot;A Teenager in Love&quot;, &quot;Save the Last Dance for Me&quot;, &quot;This Magic Moment&quot;, &quot;Sweets for My Sweet&quot;, &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot;, &quot;Little Sister&quot;, &quot;Surrender&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Used to Losing You&quot;, &quot;Suspicion&quot;, &quot;Turn Me Loose&quot; and &quot;A Mess of Blues&quot;. 
*Pomus was elected to the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
*In 1991, he was the first non-African American recipient of the Rhythm and Blues Foundation Pioneer Award. Ray Charles presented the award via a pre-recorded message.
*The funk band Cameo was heavily influenced by Pomus&#x27;s song-writing style and frequently acknowledges his impact before performing their hit song &quot;Word Up.&quot;
*Longtime friend, jazz singer Jimmy Scott, performed at Pomus&#x27;s funeral, a performance that resurrected his career. Other attendees included Seymour Stein, who subsequently signed Scott to Sire Records, and Lou Reed, who thereafter would regularly work with Scott until his death. Pomus had been imploring his friends to hear Scott sing for many years.
*The song &quot;Doc&#x27;s Blues&quot; was written as a tribute to Pomus by his close friend, Andrew Vachss. The lyrics originally appeared in Vachss&#x27;s 1990 novel &quot;Blossom&quot;. &quot;Doc&#x27;s Blues&quot; was recorded by bluesman Son Seals on Seals&#x27;s last album, &quot;Lettin&#x27; Go&quot;.
*Responsible for Lou Reed&#x27;s introduction to the music industry in the early 1960s, Pomus was one of two friends Reed memorialized on his 1992 album &quot;Magic and Loss&quot;.
*In 1995, Rhino Records released a tribute album to Pomus entitled &quot;Till The Night Is Gone&quot;. Pomus&#x27;s songs are performed by Bob Dylan, Brian Wilson, Dion, Dr. John, Irma Thomas, Solomon Burke, John Hiatt, Shawn Colvin, Aaron Neville, Lou Reed, The Band, B.B. King, Los Lobos, and Rosanne Cash.
*In 2010, Ben Folds and Nick Hornby named their collaborative album on which the song &quot;Doc Pomus&quot; appeared &quot;Lonely Avenue&quot;. The lyrics referenced an excerpt from Pomus&#x27;s unfinished memoir, February 21, 1984: &quot;I was never one of those happy cripples who stumbled around smiling and shiny-eyed, trying to get the world to cluck its tongue and shake its head sadly in my direction. They&#x27;d never look at me and say, &#x27;What a wonderful, courageous fellow. The album featured lyrics by British author Hornby, set to music by American performer Folds. It was released on September 28, 2010.
*John Goodman&#x27;s character in the Coen brothers&#x27; 2013 dramedy &quot;Inside Llewyn Davis&quot; was loosely inspired by Pomus. 
*Songs written or co-written by Doc Pomus have been recorded by Joe Cocker, ZZ Top, Ray Charles, Elvis Presley, Elvis Costello, Dean Martin, Andy Williams, The Beatles, Bad Company, Leonard Cohen, Van Morrison, Led Zeppelin, Bruce Springsteen, Michael Buble, Dolly Parton, Emmy Lou Harris, Bob Dylan, Brian Wilson, Harry Nilsson, John Hiatt, The Beach Boys, B.B. King, The New York Dolls, Shawn Colvin, Los Lobos, Dion, and hundreds of others.
*Bob Dylan&#x27;s 2022 book,&quot;The Philosophy of Modern Song&quot;, is dedicated to Doc Pomus.

<doc id="165834" wikidata="Q73599" url="?curid=165834" title="Ijtihad">
<text>Ijtihad ( ; &quot;&quot; , ) is an Islamic legal term referring to independent reasoning by an expert in Islamic law, or the thorough exertion of a jurist&#x27;s mental faculty in finding a solution to a legal question. It is contrasted with &quot;taqlid&quot; (imitation, conformity to legal precedent). According to classical Sunni theory, &quot;ijtihad&quot; requires expertise in the Arabic language, theology, revealed texts, and principles of jurisprudence (&quot;usul al-fiqh&quot;), and is not employed where authentic and authoritative texts (Qur&#x27;an and hadith) are considered unambiguous with regard to the question, or where there is an existing scholarly consensus (&quot;ijma&quot;). &quot;Ijtihad&quot; is considered to be a religious duty for those qualified to perform it. An Islamic scholar who is qualified to perform &quot;ijtihad&quot; is called a &quot;mujtahid&quot;.

For first five centuries of Islam, the practice of &quot;ijtihad&quot; continued in theory and practice among Sunni Muslims. It then first became subject to dispute in the 12th century. By the 14th century, development of classic Islamic jurisprudence or &quot;fiqh&quot; prompted leading Sunni jurists to state that the main legal questions in Islam had been addressed, and to call for the scope of &quot;ijtihad&quot; to be restricted. In the modern era, this gave rise to a perception amongst Orientalist scholars and sections of the Muslim public that the so-called &quot;gate of &quot;ijtihad&quot;&quot; was closed at the start of the classical era. While recent scholarship established that the practice of &quot;Ijtihad&quot; had never ceased in Islamic history, the extent and mechanisms of legal change in the post-formative period remain a subject of debate. Differences amongst the &quot;Fuqaha&quot; (jurists) prevented Sunni Muslims from reaching any consensus (&quot;Ijma&quot;) on the issues of continuity of &quot;Ijtihad&quot; and existence of &quot;Mujtahids&quot;. Thus, Ijtihad remained a key aspect of Islamic jurisprudence throughout the centuries. &quot;Ijtihad&quot; was practiced throughout the Early modern period and claims for &quot;ijtihad&quot; and its superiority over &quot;taqlid&quot; were voiced unremittingly.

Starting from the 18th century, Islamic reformers began calling for abandonment of &quot;taqlid&quot; and emphasis on &quot;ijtihad&quot;, which they saw as a return to Islamic origins. Public debates in the Muslim world surrounding &quot;ijtihad&quot; continue to the present day. The advocacy of &quot;ijtihad&quot; has been particularly associated with the Salafiyya and modernist movements. Among contemporary Muslims in the West there have emerged new visions of &quot;ijtihad&quot; which emphasize substantive moral values over traditional juridical methodology.

Shia jurists did not use the term &quot;ijtihad&quot; until the 12th century. With the exception of Zaydi jurisprudence, the early Imami Shia were unanimous in censuring &quot;Ijtihad&quot; in the field of law (&quot;Ahkam&quot;). After the Shiite embrace of various doctrines of Mu&#x27;tazila and classical Sunnite &quot;Fiqh&quot; (jurisprudence), this led to a change. After the victory of the &quot;Usulis&quot; who based law on principles (usul) over the &quot;Akhbaris&quot; (&quot;traditionalists&quot;) who emphasized on reports or traditions (&quot;khabar&quot;) by the 19th century, &quot;Ijtihad&quot; would become a mainstream Shia practice.

==Etymology and definition==
The word derives from the three-letter Arabic verbal root of &quot;-H-D&quot; (&quot;&quot;, &#x27;struggle&#x27;): the &quot;t&quot; is inserted because the word is a derived stem VIII verb. In its literal meaning, the word refers to effort, physical or mental, expended in a particular activity. In its technical sense, &quot;ijtihad&quot; can be defined as a &quot;process of legal reasoning and hermeneutics through which the jurist-mujtahid derives or rationalizes law on the basis of the Qur&#x27;an and the Sunna&quot;.

The juristic meaning of ijtihād has several definitions according to scholars of Islamic legal theory. Some define it as the jurist&#x27;s action and activity to reach a solution. Al-Ghazālī (d. 505/1111) defines it as the &quot;total expenditure of effort made by a jurist for the purpose of obtaining the religious rulings.&quot; Similarly the ijtihād is defined as &quot;the effort made by the mujtahid in seeking knowledge of the &quot;aḥkām&quot; (rulings) of the sharī&#x27;ah (Islamic canonical law) through interpretation.&quot;

From this point of view that ijtihād essentially consists of an inference (&quot;istinbāṭ&quot;) that extents to a probability (&quot;ẓann&quot;). Thus it excludes the extraction of a ruling from a clear text as well as rulings made without recourse to independent legal reasoning. A knowledgeable person who gives a ruling on the sharī&#x27;ah, but is not able to exercise their judgement in the inference of the rulings from the sources, is not called a mujtahid but rather a &quot;muqallid&quot;.

==Scriptural basis==
Islamic scholar Asghar Ali Engineer cites a hadith related by a sahabi (companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad) by the name of Muadh ibn Jabal (also Ma&#x27;adh bin Jabal), as the basis for ijtihad. According to the hadith from &quot;Sunan Abu-Dawud&quot;, Book 24, Muadh was appointed by Muhammad to go to Yemen. Before leaving he was asked how he would judge when the occasion of deciding a case arose.
==History==
===Formative period===

During the early period, &quot;ijtihad&quot; referred to the exertion of mental energy to arrive at a legal opinion (&quot;ra&#x27;y&quot;) on the basis of the knowledge of the Divine Revelation. Jurists used &quot;Ijtihad&quot; to help reach legal rulings, in cases where the Qur&#x27;an and Sunna did not provide clear direction for certain decisions. It was the duty of the educated jurists to come to a ruling that would be in the best interest of the Muslim community and promote the public good.

As religious law continued to develop over time, &quot;ra&#x27;y&quot; became insufficient in making sure that fair legal rulings were being derived in keeping with both the Qur&#x27;an and Sunna. However, during this time, the meaning and process of &quot;ijtihad&quot; became more clearly constructed. &quot;Ijtihad&quot; was &quot;limited to a systematic method of interpreting the law on the basis of authoritative texts, the Quran and Sunna&quot;.

As the practice of &quot;ijtihad&quot; transformed over time, it became religious duty of a &quot;mujtahid&quot; to conduct legal rulings for the Muslim society. &quot;Mujtahid&quot; is defined as a Muslim scholar that has met certain requirements including a strong knowledge of the Qur&#x27;an, Sunna, and Arabic, as well as a deep understanding of legal theory and the precedent; all of which allows them to be considered fully qualified to practice &quot;ijtihad&quot;.

=== Classical era ===

==== Origins of the controversy ====
The controversy over the existence of &quot;Mujtahids&quot; began in its nascent form during the sixth/12th century. The fifth-century Hanbali jurist Ibn &#x27;Aqil (1040–1119) responding to a Hanafi jurist&#x27;s statement, advocated for the necessity of existence of &quot;Mujtahids&quot; using scripture and reasoning. A century later, Shafi&#x27;i jurist Al-Amidi would counter the premise of Hanbalis and prominent Shafīʿis arguing that extinction of &quot;Mujtahids&quot; is possible. Over the centuries, the controversy would garner more attention with the scholars gathering around 3 camps: 1) Hanbalis and majority of Shafīʿis who denied the theoretical possibility of &quot;Mujtahid&quot;&#x27;s extinction 2) a group of jurists who asserted that extinction of &quot;Mujtahids&quot; is possible but not proven 3) a group who advocated the extinction of &quot;Mujtahids.&quot;

To validate their points, the scholars of &quot;Taqlid&quot; camp cited Prophetic &quot;hadiths&quot; that report the disappearance of knowledge when ignorant leaders &quot;will give judgements&quot; and misguide others. &quot;Muqallids&quot; also argued that &quot;Ijtihad&quot; isn&#x27;t a communal obligation (&quot;fard kifaya&quot;) when it is possible to blindly imitate the laws of ancestors received through transmitted chains of narrations. Hanbalis, the staunch advocates of permanent existence of &quot;Mujtahids,&quot; countered by citing Prophetic reports which validated their view that knowledge and sound judgement would accompany the Muslim &quot;Ummah&quot; led by &quot;Mujtahid&quot; scholars until the Day of Judgment, thus giving theological implications to the controversy. They also raised the question of leadership and interpretive religious authority to vigorously deny the possibility of an age without &quot;Mujtahids&quot;, a doctrine which they defended using both Scripultural and rational arguments. Citing Prophetic traditions such as &quot;scholars are the heirs of the prophets&quot;, Hanbalis settled on the belief that God would not leave any age without a proper guide, i.e., Islamic &quot;Fuqaha&quot; (jurists) who solve novel issues through &quot;Ijtihad&quot;.

The majority of Shafīʿi scholars were also leading advocates of &quot;Ijtihad&quot; as a &quot;fard kifaya&quot; (communal obligation). The prominent 16th century Shafi&#x27;i legal treatise &quot;Fath-ul-Mueen&quot; affirmed the existence of &quot;Mujtahids&quot; and obligated them to take the post of Qadi as &quot;fard kifaya&quot;. Leading Shafīʿi jurist Al-Suyuti (1445-1505) also stipulated &quot;Ijtihad&quot; as a communal obligation, the abandonment of which would be sinful upon the whole &quot;Ummah&quot;. Shafīʿis also upheld the popular Muslim tradition of appearance of &quot;Mujaddids&quot; who would renew the religion every century. As promoters of the idea of &quot;Mujaddids;&quot; (who were assumed as &quot;Mujtahids&quot;) majority of jurists who claimed &quot;Tajdid&quot; or honoured as &quot;Mujaddids&quot; were Shafīʿis. On the other hand, some prominent Shafīʿi jurists like Al-Rafi&#x27;i (d. 623) had made statements speculating an &quot;agreement&quot; on the absence of &quot;Mujtahid Mutlaqs&quot; (highest-ranking &quot;Mujtahid&quot;) during his era while few others affirmed theoretical possibility of absence of &quot;Mujtahids&quot;. However, such statements had ambiguities in legal terminology and didn&#x27;t stipulate an established consensus on the issue. In addition, Rafi&#x27;i himself was considered as a &quot;Mujtahid&quot; and a &quot;Mujaddid&quot;.

Yahya ibn Sharaf al-Nawawi (d. 676/1277), a prominent Shafī&#x27;i Muhaddith and Jurist, who is a primary reference even for Shafiites of Taqleed camp; advocated that it isn&#x27;t obligatory for laymen to adhere to a &quot;mad&#x27;hab&quot;, reinforcing the orthodox Shafī&#x27;ite pro-Ijtihad position. Other prominent classical Shafī&#x27;i jurists who advocated the pro-Ijtihad position included Taj ud Din al Subki, Dhahabi, Izz ud Deen Ibn Abdussalam, Ibn al Salah, Al Bulqini, etc. Taj ud Din al Subki (d. 1370) summed up the classical-era Shafi&#x27;i position in his &quot;Kitāb Mu&#x27;īd an-Ni&#x27;am wa-Mubīd an-Niqām&quot;:

==== Emergence of the &quot;closure of the gates&quot; notion ====
In contrast to the view of these Shafiites, classical Shafi&#x27;ite theologian &#x27;Abd al-Malik al-Juwayni (d. 1085 C.E/ 478 A.H) postulated a new doctrine on the controversy of the existence of &quot;Mujtahids&quot;. Juwaynī and his Shāfiʿī colleagues insisted that not only the disappearance of Mujtahids was possible, but that it had already happened. Juwayni&#x27;s doctrine was taken by his student Ghazālī (d. 1111 C.E/ 505 A.H), al-Qaffāl al-Shāshī (d. 1113 C.E/507 A.H) and promoted in the next century by the Shafi&#x27;i scholars Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī (d. 606/1209), Sayf al-Dīn al-Āmidī (d. 631/1233), and Rāfiʿī (d. 623/1226). These scholars asserted the belief that &quot;Mujtahids&quot; had already disappeared, and some would claim a consensus on this point. Thereafter, the theory of legal minimalism elucidated by Juwayni in his book &quot;Ghiyāth al-umam fī iltiyāth al zulam&quot;, penned for his Seljuk patron Nizam ul-Mulk, would be popularised. This system listed a set of core principles that implemented legal and procedural minimalism; and attempted the standardisation of Islamic courts and legal framework in the medieval Muslim World.

Most significantly, the influential Islamic theologian Al Ghazzali introduced the notion of closure of &quot;Ijtihad&quot; since he viewed numerous people with inadequate knowledge of &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; as claiming to be &quot;Mujtahids&quot;. Ghazzali&#x27;s emphasis on rigorous asceticism and imitation of traditions practised by Sufi mystics led him to attack rational enquiry and sciences like physics for contradicting religion. Owing to his status as a great scholar, numerous &quot;ulema&quot; followed his call; even though many continued to dispute it. Intellectuals like Hasan Hanafi argue that Ghazali had tried to preclude the endeavour of &quot;Ijtihad&quot; during his era in order to establish a rigid, stable orthodoxy that could effectively challenge external enemies of Islam like the Crusaders. According to C.A Qadir, Ghazzali&#x27;s efforts had tremendous impact in limiting the scope of &quot;Ijtihad&quot; in medieval Islamic orthodxy.

However, there is still a vigorous scholarly debate regarding whether Al-Ghazali had himself &quot;closed the gates&quot; or whether he merely continued an established policy of his scholarly predecessors or whether the gate was ever closed. According to James P. Piscatori, the provision for &quot;Ijtihad&quot; in Sunni &quot;Fiqh&quot; was never &quot;tightly shut&quot; and remained open to some extent. During the 16th century, majority of the clerical classes would claim Ghazzali&#x27;s doctrine as sacrosanct and inviolable by &quot;Ijma&quot; (consensus). Post-classical era, a large part of Shafīʿi scholarship would also shift to a pro-&quot;Taqleed&quot; position owing to external influence from Hanafite-Malikite &quot;Muqallid&quot; camps. Most noteworthy amongst them were Ibn Hajar al-Haytami (d. 1566). However many still defended &quot;Ijtihad&quot; while others who theoretically affirmed the disappearance of &quot;Mujtahids&quot; rejected the claim that they did in reality.

==== Late classical period ====
Until the end of the 14th century, no voice had before actively risen to condemn the claims of &quot;mujtahids&quot; to practice &quot;ijtihad&quot; within their schools. However, the doctrine of &quot;Taqlid&quot; was steadily amassing support amongst the masses. The first incident in which &quot;muqallids&quot; openly attacked the claims of &quot;mujtahids&quot; occurred in Egypt, during the lifetime of Suyuti. Suyuti had claimed to practice the highest degree of &quot;Ijtihad&quot; within the Shafi&#x27;i school. He advocated that Ijtihad is a backbone of Sharia and believed in the continuous existence of &quot;Mujtahids&quot;.

Around the 15th century, most Sunni jurists argued that all major matters of religious law had been settled, allowing for &quot;taqlid&quot; (تقليد), &quot;the established legal precedents and traditions,&quot; to take priority over &quot;ijtihād&quot; (اجتهاد). This move away from the practice of &quot;ijtihād&quot; was primarily made by the scholars of Hanafī and Malikī schools, and a number of Shafīʿis, but not by Hanbalīs and majority of Shafīʿi jurists who believed that &quot;true consensus&quot; (&quot;ijmāʿ&quot; اجماع), apart from that of Muhammad&#x27;s Companions, did not exist&quot; and that &quot;the constant continuous existence of &quot;mujtahids&quot; (مجتهد) was a theological requirement.&quot; Although the Ottoman clergy denied &quot;Ijtihad&quot; in theory&quot;,&quot; throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, the Ottoman Hanafite &quot;ulema&quot; had practiced &quot;Ijtihad&quot; to solve a number of new legal issues. Various legal rulings were formulated on a number of issues, such as the Waqf of movables, on drugs, coffee, music, tobacco, etc. However to support the official doctrine of &quot;extinction of &quot;Mujtahids&quot;&quot;, the Ottoman &quot;ulema&quot; denied &quot;Ijtihad&quot; even when it was practised.

The increasing prominence of &quot;taqlid&quot; had at one point led most Western scholars to believe that the &quot;gate of &quot;ijtihad&quot;&quot; was in fact effectively closed around tenth century. In a 1964 monograph, which exercised considerable influence on later scholars, Joseph Schacht wrote that &quot;a consensus gradually established itself to the effect that from that time onwards no one could be deemed to have the necessary qualifications for independent reasoning in religious law, and that all future activity would have to be confined to the explanation, application, and, at the most, interpretation of the doctrine as it had been laid down once and for all.&quot;

While more recent research is said to have disproven the notion that the practice of &quot;ijtihad&quot; was abandoned in the tenth century — or even later in the 15th century — the extent of legal change during this period and its mechanisms remain a subject of scholarly debate. The &quot;Ijtihad&quot; camp primarily consisted of Hanbalis and Shafiites, while the Taqlid camp were primarily Hanafites who were supported to a greater or lesser extent by Malikis as well as some Shafi&#x27;is.

=== Ranking of Mujtahids ===

After the 11th century, Sunni legal theory developed systems for ranking jurists according to their qualifications for &quot;ijtihad&quot;. One such ranking placed the founders of &quot;maddhab&quot;s, who were credited with being &quot;&quot;absolute&quot; &quot;mujtahid&quot;s&quot; (&quot;mujtahid muṭlaq&quot;) capable of methodological innovation, at the top, and jurists capable only of &quot;taqlīd&quot; at the bottom, with &quot;mujtahid&quot;s and those who combined &quot;ijtihād&quot; and &quot;taqlīd&quot; given the middle ranks. In the 11th century, jurists required a &quot;mufti&quot; (jurisconsult) to be a &quot;mujtahid&quot;; by the middle of the 13th century, however, most scholars considered a &quot;muqallid&quot; (practitioner of &quot;taqlīd&quot;) to be qualified for the role. During that era some jurists began to ponder whether practitioners of &quot;ijtihad&quot; continued to exist and the phrase &quot;closing of the gate of &quot;ijtihād&quot;&quot; (إغلاق باب الاجتهاد &quot;iġlāq bāb al-ijtihād&quot;) appeared after the 16th century.

However, these rankings have been criticized for its arbitrariness. Many other distinguished scholars have been recorded by scholars as &quot;Mujtahid Mutlaqs&quot; even after the deaths of four &quot;Imams&quot; (to whom the four schools are attributed). Also, various schools were subject to transformation and evolution through time in ways that their founders had not imagined. The founders themselves had not stipulated many such rankings or classifications. Nor did they obligate strict adherence to a particular scholar or legal theory. In many cases, major parts of the legal theory were in fact developed by the later followers.

The classical Hanbali theologian Taqi al-Din Ibn Taymiyya (d. 1328 C.E/ 728 A.H) was a notable figure who dissented from the prevalent &quot;Madh&#x27;hab&quot;-based ranking standardisations and classifications. Arguing that the practice of &quot;Ijtihad&quot; is allowed for every Muslim, Ibn Taymiyya writes:

Legal schools(&quot;mad&#x27;habs&quot;) had begun to take shape by the middle of the fourth/tenth century and practice of affiliating to the madhabs began to become popular. Systematic categorisation of &quot;Mujtahids&quot; emerged during late fifth/eleventh century into ranks of excellence. By doing so, they sought to facilitate the &quot;Ijtihad&quot; of qualified Muftis. The earliest known typology of jurists is Ibn Rushd&#x27;s (d. 520/1126) tripartite classification of Muftis. In this typology, the top-Mufti was a &quot;Mujtahid&quot; (like Ibn Rushd himself) while the latter two ranks weren&#x27;t, i.e., a &quot;Mujtahid&quot; must independently reason on the basis of Scriptures and general principles of the school. On the other hand, Ghazzali distinguished between two ranks of &quot;Mujtahids&quot;, the independent(&quot;Mutlaq&quot;) and the affiliated(&quot;Muqayyad&quot;) in a three-rank classification. In the seventh century, Shafi&#x27;i jurist Ibn al-Salah (d. 643/1245) would elaborate a five rank classification of Muftis. During the 10th/16th century, Ottoman Shaykh al-Islam Ammad Ibn Kamal (d. 940/1533) articulated a Hanafite typology of jurists with seven ranks. Unlike the previous typologies, the latter classification was promoted by &quot;Taqlid&quot; partisans who advocated that &quot;Mujtahids&quot; ceased to exist. All these classifications created an archetype of an ideal standard to which all other typologies must conform, i.e., the founders of 4 schools. However, this typological conception of the founder &quot;Mujtahid&quot; suffered from chronological ruptures, overlooking in the process the founder&#x27;s predecessors as well as his immediate intellectual history that formed a continuity. Although the founder imams were accomplished jurists, they were not as absolutely and as categorically as they were portrayed to be, starting from the 5th/11th century. Ibn Kamal&#x27;s seven-rank typology, in particular, would come under scathing criticism by other Hanafites as well, such as Muhammad Bakhit al-Muti&#x27;i (1854 or 1856 — 1935), who was the Grand Mufti of Al-Azhar.

Many Islamic reformers, starting from the 18th century would criticize these classifications altogether, since these classifications assumed every Mufti in terms of leaders and followers, affiliated to the founder imams and succeeding generations who are progressively inferior to knowledge of imams. Faithful to the tenets of Ibn Taymiyya and Muhammad Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab (1792 C.E/ 1206 A.H), the Wahhabi movement called for &quot;Ijtihad&quot; and opposed &quot;Taqlid&quot;. Advocating the Wahhabi stance on &quot;Ijtihad&quot;, &#x27;Abd al-Rahman ibn Hasan Aal-Al Shaykh (1196-1285 A.H / 1782-1868 C.E), influential &quot;Qadi&quot; of the Emirate of Nejd, asserts:

The 18th-century Islamic reformer and top-most &quot;Qadi&quot; of Yemen, Al-Shawkani (1759-1839) totally rejected the theory of classification of &quot;Mujtahids&quot;. According to him, there is only one form of &quot;Ijtihad&quot; which can be practised by anybody possessing sufficient knowledge. Shawkani maintains that it is sufficient for a scholar to study one compendium in each of the five disciplines to practice &quot;Ijtihad&quot;. According to Shawkani, the &quot;Muqallids&quot; who propagate the closure of &quot;Ijtihad&quot; and argue that only the four Imams can understand &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and &quot;Sunnah&quot; are guilty of:

This view would influence many 19th and 20th century Salafi reform movements.

=== Modern era ===

During the turn of the 16th to 17th century, Sunni Muslim reformers began to criticize taqlid, and promoted greater use of &quot;ijtihad&quot; in legal matters. They claimed that instead of looking solely to previous generations for practices developed by religious scholars, there should be an established doctrine and rule of behavior through the interpretation of original foundational texts of Islam—the Qur&#x27;an and Sunna.

During the 18th century, Islamic revivalists increasingly condemned the &quot;Muqallid&quot; camp through a mass of writings explaining the evils of &quot;Taqlid&quot; and advocating &quot;Ijtihad&quot; as well as defending its status as a Divinely established principle in sharia. This would often result in violence between their followers. Most prominent amongst them were Shah Waliullah Dehlawi, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, Shawkani, Muhammad ibn Isma&#x27;il Al-San&#x27;aani, Ibn Mu&#x27;ammar, Ahmad ibn Idris al-Fasi, Uthman Ibn Fudio, Muhammad ibn Ali al-Sanusi, etc.

Shah Waliullah Dehlawi was an ardent advocate of &quot;Ijtihad&quot; and considered it essential for the vigour of society. Re-inforcing the classical theory, he considered Ijtihad to be &quot;fard kifaya&quot; (communal obligation). Condemning the prevalent partisanship over &quot;Taqleed&quot; he denounced the &quot;Muqallid&quot; camp as the misguided &quot;simpletons of our time&quot;. He considered himself as a &quot;Mujtahid&quot; of the highest rank affiliated to Hanafi school.

In his treatise &quot;Usul al-Sittah&quot; (Six Foundations), Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab harshly rebuked the &quot;Muqallids&quot; for raising the description of &quot;Mujtahids&quot; to humanely unattainable levels. He also condemned the practice of obligating &quot;Taqleed&quot; which deviated people away from Qur&#x27;an and Sunnah. In similar terms, Yemeni scholar Shawkani too condemned the practice of rigid &quot;Taqleed&quot;. Demonstrating the perpetual existence of Mujtahids in his works, Shawkani also argued that &quot;Ijtihad&quot; at later times was far easier due to detailed manuals unavailable for jurists of the past era.

Amongst the eighteenth-century reformers, the most radical condemnation of &quot;Taqlid&quot; and advocacy of &quot;Ijtihad&quot; was championed by the Arabian scholar Muhammad ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab, whose uncompromising reformist efforts often turned violent. Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab condemned the centuries-long heritage of jurisprudence (&quot;Fiqh&quot;) that coalesced into four schools (&quot;mad&#x27;habs&quot;) as an innovation. Challenging the authority of religious clerics, and a large portion of the classical scholarship, he proclaimed the necessity of directly returning to Qur&#x27;an and hadith, rather than relying on medieval interpretations. According to Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab, in order to uphold true monotheism (&quot;Tawhid&quot;), Muslims should return to the pristine Islam of the early generations (&quot;Salaf&quot;), stripped of all human additions and speculations. In his legal treatises such as &quot;Mukhtasar al-Insaf wa al-Sharh al-Kabir&quot;, Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab weighed in legal opinions between different schools, opening the realm to comparative Fiqh thinking and often referring the conclusions of Ibn Taymiyya. This legal approach of drawing inferences directly from Qur&#x27;an and Hadith (&quot;istinbat&quot;), instead of &quot;taqlid&quot; to one of the 4 law schools, as well as his prohibition of &quot;Taqlid&quot;, drew sharp condemnation from the &quot;Muqallid&quot; camp. In a scathing response, Muhammad Ibn &#x27;Abdul Wahhab accused his detractors of taking &quot;the scholars as lords&quot; and vehemently condemned &quot;taqleed&quot; as the biggest principle of the &quot;kuffar&quot; (disbelievers), in his treatise &quot;Masa&#x27;il al-Jahiliyya&quot; (Aspects of the Days of Ignorance) writing : 

In face of the backlash towards Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab&#x27;s uncompromising stance in his rejection of taqlid, advocacy of Ijtihad and radical anti-madhab views, the later Wahhabis became more conciliatory towards traditional four schools of Fiqh. Abdallah, the son of Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab also toned down the radical anti-Taqlid stances by stating that they affiliate themselves to the Hanbali school and do not condemn the common people who make taqleed to the four schools of jurisprudence. The earliest substantial Wahhabite treatise on &quot;Ijtihad&quot; was written by the scholar Ibn Mu&#x27;ammar (d. 1810), a student of Ibn Abd al-Wahhab and a &quot;Qadi&quot; of First Saudi state. In his treatise &quot;Risalat al-Ijtihad wal Taqlid&quot;, Ibn Muammar gave respect to the four traditional Sunni schools of law and distinguished between two ranks of &quot;Mujtahids&quot;: independent &quot;Mujtahid&quot; and &quot;Mujtahid al-Muqayyid&quot; bound to the &quot;Imams&quot;. According to Ibn Mu&#x27;ammar, &quot;Taqlid&quot; is permissible for laymen and scholar without sufficient knowledge, but forbidden for those who can comprehend the bases of the law. Unlike Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab, Ibn Mu&#x27;ammar permitted laypeople to make &quot;Taqleed&quot; to trustworthy scholars, with certain reservations. Despite this, he also criticized strict adherence to a &quot;madhab&quot; and denounced &quot;mad&#x27;hab&quot; fanaticism as a &quot;bid&#x27;ah&quot; (innovation). According to Ibn Mu&#x27;ammar, the opinions of Imams should be discarded if they differ from authentic Prophetic traditions.

Outlining the conventional Wahhabi legal theory which harmonised the &quot;madhhab&quot; system with the practice of Ijtihad, Ibn Mu&#x27;ammar writes:&quot;Adopting the [revealed] proof [for a position] without considering the statements of [other] &quot;ulama&quot; is the function of the absolute mujtahid... [Laity are] obligated to practice taqlid and to consult those with knowledge.. [But the idea that one must always follow a single school] is a false view which Satan has cast upon many claimants to knowledge. ... [T]hey imagine that study of the proofs is a difficult matter, of which only an absolute mujtahid is capable... [They have even arrived at a claim] that one associated with the school of an imam is obliged to accept that school... even if it differs with the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and the &quot;sunna&quot;. Thus, the imam of the school is to the members of his school as the Prophet is to his Community, ... You will [also] find the fanatic adherents of the schools in many matters differing with the explicit positions of their imams, and following the views of the latecomers in their school.. the books of the predecessors are hardly found among them.&quot;

Ahmad Ibn Idris Al-Fasi also emphasized on the practice of &quot;ijtihad&quot;. His criticism of &quot;Taqleed&quot; of the schools of law (madhhabs) was based on three concerns. First, the need for following the Prophetic traditions. Second, to reduce divisions between the Muslims. Third, mercy for the Muslims, because there were &#x27;few circumstances on which the Quran and Sunna were genuinely silent, but if there was a silence on any question, then that silence was intentional on God&#x27;s part- a divine mercy.&#x27; He therefore rejected any &#x27;attempt to fill a silence deliberately left by God, and so to abrogate one of His mercies.&#x27;

His student, Muhammad ibn Ali al-Sanusi also followed in his footsteps. In his work &quot;Al-Bughya&quot;, Al Sanusi advocates for the need to practice &quot;Ijtihad&quot;. The most detailed treatise by Al-Sanusi on the topic of &quot;Ijtihad&quot; is &quot;Iqaz al-wasnan fi &#x27;l-&#x27;amal bi&#x27;l-hadith wa&#x27;l-Qur`an.&quot; Quoting Ibn Taymiyya, Al Sanusi emphasizes on the principle of fallibility of the Imams of the &quot;madhabs&quot; and the obligation to follow the &quot;Sunnah&quot;. The opinions of the four Imams should only be used for a better understanding of &quot;Fiqh&quot;. Following Ibn Hazm and Shawkani, Sanussi asserted that &quot;taqlid&quot; is &quot;bid&#x27;ah&quot;(innovation) and fully condemned it. Sanussi distinguished between the independent &quot;Mujtahid&quot; and the affiliated &quot;Mujtahid&quot; and affirmed the existence of the affiliated &quot;Mujtahid&quot; in every age. He also objected to &quot;Taqlid&quot; and emphasized that &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and &quot;Sunna&quot; must be given precedence over the opinions of Mujtahids, even in cases where the 4 &quot;Imams&quot; are wrong.

Remarkably, all these reformers shared common points of contact in Hijaz and a network of scholars with a Hijazi-Yemeni centre. Shah Waliullah Dehlawi and Muhammad Hayat as-Sindi were pupils of Muhammad Ibn Ibrahim Al Kurrani Al Kurdi as well as connected to Ibrahim Ibn Hasan Al Kurrani Al Kurdi (d. 1690) and AbuI-Baqa&#x27; al-Hasan ibn &#x27;Ali al- Ajami (d. 1702). Al-Sanusi is also linked with these scholars via his teacher al-Badr b. &#x27;Amir al-Mi&#x27;dani who was a student of Al-Sindi as well as via other independent chains. Al-Shawkani is connected to Ibrahim Al-Kurrani via his teacher Yusuf Ibn Muhammad.

Outside these circles, some scholars amongst traditional Sufi circles were also in favour of Ijtihad. These included the prominent Ottoman Hanafite jurist Ibn Abidin (1784-1836) who is a scholarly authoritaty for even Hanafites of the &quot;Taqleed&quot; camp. Ibn Abidin employed &quot;Ijtihad&quot; in order to issue fatwas, using reasoning and believed that &quot;ijtihad&quot; was acceptable to use in certain circumstances. According to Ibn Abidin, Hanafite Muftis should look up to rulings of Abu Hanifa, then Abu Yusuf, then Shaybani, then Zufar and then some lesser jurists for fatwas. However, if a previous Hanafi scholar hasn&#x27;t found an answer to the issue, then he should employ &quot;Ijtihad&quot; to solve the novel issue. According to Ibn Abidin, it is not obligatory to follow a particular &quot;mad&#x27;hab&quot; as well.

==== Contemporary debates over Ijtihad ====
On the issue of existence of &quot;Mujtahids&quot; and continuity of &quot;Ijtihad&quot;, contemporary scholarship are divided into two diametric camps, and a third moderate camp:

1) Those who oppose &quot;Ijtihad&quot;: These include the Orientalist scholars who view that &quot;Gates of &quot;Ijtihad&quot; are closed&quot;. Sufi groups such as Barelvis, Deobandis, etc. believe that &quot;Mujtahids&quot; have ceased to exist. Some others such as Said Nursi is not theoretically against &quot;Ijtihad&quot;, but advocates postponing &quot;Ijtihad&quot; to a later time when Muslims attain sufficient strength.

2) Those who advocate &quot;Ijtihad&quot;: These include Salafi scholars and Islamic modernists who believe in the existence of &quot;Mujtahids&quot;. Salafis argue that &quot;Ijtihad&quot; doesn&#x27;t have a gate, but only pre-requisites. Others who advocate Ijtihad include Muhammad Iqbal, Muhammad Asad, etc. Recent scholars in academia such as Wael Hallaq are also its supporters.

3) Those who take an intermediary position.

====Islamic modernism====

Starting in the middle of the 19th century, Islamic modernists such as Sir Sayyid Ahmed Khan, Jamal al-din Al-Afghani, and Muhammad Abduh emerged seeking to revitalize Islam by re-establish and reform Islamic law and its interpretations to accommodate Islam with modern society. They emphasized the use of &quot;ijtihad&quot;, but in contrast to its original use, they sought to &quot;apply contemporary intellectual methods&quot; such as academic or scientific thought &quot;to the task of reforming Islam&quot;. Al-Afghani proposed the new use of &quot;ijtihad&quot; that he believed would enable Muslims to think critically and apply their own individual interpretations of the innovations of modernity in the context of Islam.

One modernist argument for applying ijtihad to sharia law is that while &quot;the principles and values underlying Sharia (i.e. &quot;usul al-fiqh&quot;)&quot; are unalterable, human interpretation of sharia is not. Another, (made by Asghar Ali Engineer of India), is that the &quot;adaat&quot; (customs and traditions) of Arabs were used in the development of the sharia, and form an important part of it. They are very much not divine or immutable, and have no more legal justification to be part of the sharia than the &quot;adaat&quot; of Muslims—Iranians, Uzbeks, Turks, Chinese, Indians and others—living beyond the home of the original Muslim in the Arab Hejaz.

In Indonesia, following considerable debate among the ulema, Indonesian &quot;adaat&quot; &quot;become part of Sharia as applicable in that country&quot;. This use of ijtihad of &quot;adaat&quot; applies to &quot;mu&#x27;amalat&quot; (socio-economic matters such as marriage, divorce, inheritance), and not &quot;Ibadah&quot; fiqh (ritual salat, sawm, zakat, etc.). Asghar Ali Engineer argues that while the Quran was revealed in a &quot;highly patriarchal&quot; Arab &quot;adaat&quot; that still informs what is understood as sharia, the Quran itself has a &quot;transcendental&quot; vision of justice that includes &quot;absolutely equal rights&quot; between genders and should guide ijtihad of sharia.

====Islamism and Salafism====

Contemporary Salafis are major proponents of &quot;ijtihad&quot;. They criticize &quot;taqlid&quot; and believe &quot;ijtihad&quot; makes modern Islam more authentic and will guide Muslims back to the Golden Age of early Islam. Salafis assert that reliance on &quot;taqlid&quot; has led to Islam&#x27;s decline.

Ahl-i-Hadith revivalist movement of Indian subcontinent highly influenced by the thoughts of Shah Waliullah Dehlawi, Shawkani and Syed Ahmed Barelvi, fully condemn &quot;taqlid a&quot;nd advocate for &quot;ijtihad&quot; based on scriptures. Founded in mid-19th century in Bhopal, it places great emphasis on hadith studies and condemns imitation to the canonical law schools. They identify with the early school of Ahl al-Hadith. During the late 19th century, Najdi scholars would establish contacts with Ahl-i-Hadith and many Najdi students would study under the scholars of Ahl-i-Hadith, amongst them prominent scholars.

The Muslim Brotherhood traces its founding philosophies to al-Afghani&#x27;s &quot;ijtihad&quot;. The Muslim Brotherhood holds that the practice of &quot;ijtihad&quot; will strengthen the faith of believers by compelling them to better familiarize themselves with the Quran and come to their own conclusions about its teachings. But as a political group the Muslim Brotherhood faces a major paradox between &quot;ijtihad&quot; as a religious matter and as a political one. &quot;Ijtihad&quot; weakens political unity and promotes pluralism (which is also why many oppressive regimes reject &quot;ijtihad&quot;″s legitimacy).

The Iranian Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini envisioned a prominent role for &quot;ijtihad&quot; in his political theory of &quot;guardianship of the jurist&quot; (&quot;vilāyat-e faqīh&quot;).

Osama bin Laden supported &quot;ijtihad&quot;. He criticized the Saudi regime for disallowing the &quot;free believer&quot; and imposing harsh restrictions on successful practice of Islam. Thus, Bin Laden believed his striving for the implementation of &quot;ijtihad&quot; was his &quot;duty&quot; (&quot;takleef&quot;).

==Qualifications of a mujtahid==

A mujtahid (, &quot;&quot;) is an individual who is qualified to exercise &quot;ijtihad&quot; in the evaluation of Islamic law. The female equivalent is a &quot;mujtahida&quot;. In general &quot;mujtahids&quot; must have an extensive knowledge of Arabic, the Qur&#x27;an, the Sunnah, and legal theory (Usul al-fiqh). Sunni Islam and Shia Islam, due to their divergent beliefs regarding the persistence of divine authority, have different views on &quot;ijtihad&quot; and the qualifications required to achieve &quot;mujtahid&quot;.

===Sunni===
In the years following the death of Muhammad, Sunni Muslims practiced &quot;ijtihad&quot; and saw it as an acceptable form of the continuation of sacred instruction. Sunni Muslims justified practice of &quot;Ijtihad&quot; with a particular hadith, which cites Muhammad&#x27;s approval of forming an individual sound legal opinion if the Qur&#x27;an and Sunnah contain no explicit text regarding that particular issue. As Muslims turned to the Quran and Sunnah to solve their legal issues, they began to recognize that these Divine proponents did not deal directly with certain topics of law. Therefore, Sunni jurists began to find other ways and sources for &quot;ijtihad&quot; which allowed for personal judgment of Islamic law. Thus, a legal theory (&quot;usul al-Fiqh&quot;) was developed during the classical period to facilitate &quot;Ijtihad&quot;. It established a coherent system of principles through which a jurist could extract rulings on upcoming issues. Only a competent Muslim of sound mind with intellectual qualifications was allowed to engage in &quot;Ijtihad&quot;. Abu&#x27;l-Husayn al-Basri (d. 436/1044) provides the earliest, complete account for the qualifications of a &quot;mujtahid&quot;, in his book &quot;al-Mu&#x27;tamad fi Usul al-Fiqh&quot;.
They include:
* Enough knowledge of Arabic so that the scholar can read and understand both the Qur&#x27;an and the Sunnah.
* Extensive comprehensive knowledge of the Qur&#x27;an and the Sunnah. More specifically, the scholar must have a full understanding of the Qur&#x27;an&#x27;s legal contents. In regards to the Sunnah the scholar must understand the specific texts that refer to law and also the incidence of abrogation in the Sunnah.
* Must be able to confirm the consensus (&quot;Ijma&quot;) of the Companions, the Successors, and the leading Imams and mujtahideen of the past, in order to prevent making decisions that disregard these honored decisions made in the past.
* Should be able to fully understand the objectives of the sharia and be dedicated to the protection of the five necessities, which are life, religion, intellect, lineage, and property.
* Be able to distinguish strength and weakness in reasoning, or in other words exercise logic.
* Must be sincere and a good person.

After Basri, classical &quot;Mujtahids&quot; like Al-Shirazi (d. 467/1083), Al-Ghazzali (d. 505/1111), Al-Amidi (d. 632/1234) would also develop various criterion with minor changes. Amidi also allowed less qualified &quot;Mujtahids&quot; who didn&#x27;t meet these requirements to solve issues provided he has the tools of solution. From the declaration of these requirements of &quot;mujtahid&quot; onwards, legal scholars adopted these characteristics as being standard for any claimant of &quot;ijtihad&quot;. This allowed for &quot;mujtahids&quot; to openly discuss their particular views and reach a conclusion together. The interaction required by &quot;ijma&quot; allowed for &quot;mujtahids&quot; to circulate ideas and eventually merge to create particular Islamic schools of law (&quot;madhhabs&quot;). This consolidation of &quot;mujtahids&quot; into particular &quot;madhhabs&quot; prompted these groups to create their own distinct authoritative rules. These laws reduced issues of legal uncertainty that had been present when multiple &quot;mujtahids&quot; were working together with one another. Oftentimes, multiple rulings would be issued by jurists of the same legal school. Historical records show that throughout the tenth to nineteenth centuries, legal practitioners had consistently modified law using degrees of &quot;Ijtihad&quot;, making it flexible and adaptable to change. Eventually, there developed a legal system of authoritative rulings on which influential jurists agreed. However, by the 14th century, while influential jurists held that knowledgeable legal scholars should be allowed to engage in &quot;Ijtihad ,&quot; some others began to argue that there were no longer any legal scholars capable of performing &quot;Ijtihad&quot; beyond a certain limit as the founders of the four &quot;mad&#x27;habs&quot;. Despite this dispute, many high-ranking jurists upheld the practice of &quot;Ijtihad&quot; in legal rulings.

Recent scholarship has largely adopted this view, concluding that &quot;Ijtihad&quot; was indispensable in Islamic legal theory. Rather than obstructing &quot;Ijtihad&quot;, the legal theory as well as its stipulated qualifications facilitated &quot;Ijtihad&quot;.

===Shia===

Shia Muslims understand the process of &quot;ijtihad&quot; as being the independent effort used to arrive at the rulings of sharia. Following the death of the Prophet and once they had determined the Imam as absent, &quot;ijtihad&quot; evolved into a practice of applying careful reason in order to uncover the knowledge of what &quot;Imams&quot; would have done in particular legal situations. The decisions the &quot;Imams&quot; would have made were explored through the application of the Qur&#x27;an, Sunnah, &quot;ijma&quot; and &quot;&#x27;aql&quot; (reason). It was not until the end of the eighteenth century that the title of &quot;mujtahid&quot; became associated with the term &quot;faqih&quot; or one who is an expert in jurisprudence. From this point on religious courts began to increase in number and the ulama were transformed by Shia Islamic authorities into the new producer of &quot;ijtihad&quot;. Early Shiite theologians had denounced Sunni interpretative tools like &quot;Ijtihad&quot; and &quot;Qiyas&quot; (analogical reasoning) citing reports from the Shi&#x27;i Imams. They held that &quot;Ijtihad&quot; was a deductive process based on personal conjecture to argue that it had no legal basis in the shari&#x27;a (Islamic law). Therefore, until the 13th century, the concept of Ijtihad was denounced disparagingly by the Shi&#x27;i jurists, who wanted to construct a systematic and stable legal edifice that was devoid of any uncertainty. However, with the passage of time some Shia jurists sensed the need to respond to newer and novel circumstances.

According to &quot;Usuli&quot; scholars, &quot;Mujtahids&quot; existed continuously since the 16th century and employed &quot;Ijtihad&quot; to form new laws according to altering circumstances. From the late 18th century, &quot;Usuli&quot; jurists had advocated for appending &quot;&#x27;Aql&quot; (intellect) as the fourth source of law. This enabled them to issue legal opinions based on societal needs. The &quot;Akhbari&quot; school rejected the idea of human intellect playing any role in legal reasoning. In order to produce perceptive &quot;mujtahids&quot; that could fulfill this important role, &quot;Usulis&quot; developed the principles of Shia jurisprudence (&quot;Usool&quot;) to provide a foundation for scholarly deduction of Islamic law. Shaykh Murtada Ansari and his successors developed the school of Shia law, dividing the legal decisions into four levels of certainty (&quot;qat&quot;), valid conjecture (&quot;zann&quot;), doubt (&quot;shakk&quot;), and erroneous conjecture (&quot;wahm&quot;). These rules allowed &quot;mujtahids&quot; to issue adjudications on any subject, that could be derived through this process of &quot;ijtihad&quot;, demonstrating responsibility to the Shia community. Furthermore, according to Shia Islamic Jurisprudence a believer of Islam is either a &quot;Mujtahid&quot; (one that expresses their own legal reasoning), or a &quot;Muqallid&quot; (one performing taqlid—following or imitating a Mujtahid) and a &quot;Muhtat&quot; (&quot;a lay Shiite who does not follow anyone, yet acts on such precaution that assures him the fulfilment of his religious obligations&quot;). Most Shia Muslims qualify as &quot;Muqallid&quot;, and therefore are very dependent on the rulings of the &quot;Mujtahids&quot;. Therefore, the &quot;Mujtahids&quot; must be well prepared to perform &quot;ijtihad&quot;, as the community of &quot;Muqallid&quot; are dependent on their rulings. Not only did Shia Muslims require:
* Knowledge of the texts of the Qur&#x27;an and Sunnah
* Justice in matters of public and personal life
* Utmost piety
* Understanding of the cases where Shia &quot;mujtahids&quot; reached consensus
* Ability to exercise competence and authority

However, these scholars also depended on further training that could be received in religious centers called Hawza. At these centers they are taught the important subjects and technical knowledge a &quot;mujtahid&quot; need be proficient in such as:
* Arabic grammar and literature
* Logic
* Extensive knowledge of the Qur&#x27;anic sciences and Hadith
* Science of narrators
* Principle of Jurisprudence
* Comparative Jurisprudence

Therefore, Shia &quot;mujtahids&quot; remain revered throughout the Shia Islamic world. The relationship between the &quot;mujtahids&quot; and &quot;muqallids&quot; continues to address and solve the contemporary legal issues. Participating in ijtihad, however, has been cautioned by scholars for those not properly educated in interpretation of the Qu&#x27;ran. This is narrated by Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin, the great-grandson of Muhammad, when he cautioned Aban ibn abi-Ayyash, a fellow companion, saying, &quot;Oh brother from &#x27;Abd Qays, if the issue becomes clear to you, then accept it. Otherwise remain silent and defer to Allah because your interpretation from the truth will be as far from the Earth as the sky.&quot;

===Female &quot;mujtahids&quot;===

Women can be &quot;Mujtahid&quot; and throughout Islamic history there were well known female Islamic scholars and &quot;Mujtahids&quot; who played an important role in traditional Islamic discourse. Aisha the wife of Muhammad was a well-known hadith scholar and a &quot;Mujtahid&quot;. She was an assertive, intelligent woman as well as an eloquent speaker. According to Urwah Ibn Zubair, Aisha was the most knowledgeable in &quot;hadith&quot; and &quot;fiqh&quot; and surpassed everyone in knowledge of poetry and medicine. Al-Zuhri studied under the well-known woman jurist of the day, Amrah bint Abdul Rahman. She was one of the most knowledgeable people of hadith and was described as an &quot;ocean of knowledge&quot;. When the judge of Madinah heard Amrah&#x27;s message, he did not feel the need to get a male opinion, although Madinah was then housing the famous Seven Jurists. Islamic scholar Akram Nadwi published a 40-volume biographical collection of female Muslim scholars wherein more than 8,000 female scholars were detailed. Other famous female &quot;Muhadditha&quot; and jurists include Zainab bint Kamal, Fatima Al Batayahiyyah, Fatimah bint Muhammad al Samarqandi, etc. Fatima Al Fihiriyya founded the University of Qarawiyyin in Fez in 859, world&#x27;s first academic university that offered a degree. Scholars such as Umm al-Darda used to sit and debate with male scholars in the mosque. She was a teacher of hadith and Fiqh and also lectured in the men&#x27;s section. One of her students was a Caliph.

In Shiism, there have been dozens of women who have attained the rank in the modern history of Iran (for instance, Amina Bint al-Majlisi in the Safavid era, Bibi Khanum in the Qajar era, Lady Amin in the Pahlavi era, and Zohreh Sefati during the time of the Islamic Republic). There are diverging opinions as to whether a female &quot;mujtahid&quot; can be a marjaʻ or not. Zohreh Sefati and some male jurists believe a female &quot;mujtahida&quot; can become a &quot;marja&quot;&#x27; — in other words, they believe that believers perform &quot;taqlid&quot; (emulation) of a female mujtahid— but most male jurists believe a &quot;marjaʻ&quot; must be male.

<text>The Cleveland Spiders were an American professional baseball team based in Cleveland, Ohio. The team competed at the major league level from 1887 to 1899, first for two seasons as a member of the now-defunct American Association (AA), followed by eleven seasons in the National League (NL). Early names for the team included the Forest Citys and Blues. The name Spiders itself emerged early in the team&#x27;s inaugural NL season of 1889, owing to new black-and-gray uniforms and the skinny, long-limbed look of many players (thereby evoking the spider arachnid). National League Park served as the team&#x27;s home for its first four seasons until the opening of League Park in 1891.

Amid seven straight winning seasons under manager Patsy Tebeau, the team finished second in the National League three times – in 1892, 1895, and 1896. While the Spiders never won the National League pennant, the club did win the 1895 Temple Cup, a two-team league championship playoff predating the World Series. The Spiders beat that year&#x27;s pennant winner, the Baltimore Orioles (unrelated to the modern franchise), four games to one in a best-of-seven game series. Six Spiders players were later inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, including left fielder Jesse Burkett and pitcher Cy Young.

In 1899, owners Frank and Stanley Robison purchased a second team – the bankrupt St. Louis NL franchise – and sent all of the Spiders&#x27; top talent to that club, including future Hall-of-Famers Young, Burkett, and Bobby Wallace. The resulting Spiders roster finished the 1899 season 20–134, a record which remains the worst for a single season in major league history. The Spiders were subsequently one of four teams contracted by the National League that year. Partly in response to the Robison brothers&#x27; actions – which effectively ended the Spiders franchise – the practice of &quot;syndicate ownership&quot; was later banned.

Spiders outfielder Louis Sockalexis played for the team during its final three seasons and is often credited as the first Native American to play major league baseball. The Cleveland Guardians, major league successor to the Spiders in Cleveland, have long cited Sockalexis as the inspiration for their controversial former team name – &quot;Indians&quot; – though that claim is disputed.

==History==
The Spiders were the third professional baseball franchise based in Cleveland. The first team, Forest City, which played from 1870 through 1872, was initially an independent team before joining the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players for two seasons before disbanding. They were followed in 1879 by the city&#x27;s first National League team, the Cleveland Blues, which folded after the 1884 season.

===1887–1888===
After the 1886 season, the Pittsburgh Alleghenys left the American Association (AA) to join the National League. The AA, then considered a major league, chose the Cleveland group headed by Frank Robison as an expansion team to begin play in 1887 over proposals from Kansas City and Detroit. Later, Robison&#x27;s brother Stanley was added to the ownership group. Initially, the team was known as the Forest Citys, drawing on the city&#x27;s nickname and the nickname that had been used on the city&#x27;s two previous professional baseball teams. The nickname Blues was also used again in reference to the team uniforms. The Forest Citys were a weak team in their early years.

===1889–1898===

In , they moved to the National League and became known as the Spiders, reportedly after comments from a team executive assessing the players. Frank H. Brunell, this team executive who also doubled as sportswriter for &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot;, noted the combination of the team&#x27;s new black-and-gray uniforms together with the sight of several skinny, long-limbed players. He joked the team should be called &quot;Spiders&quot;, and the name stuck. The team started to improve in , largely due to the signing of future Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Cy Young.

The Spiders had their first taste of success in 1892 when they finished 93–56 overall; winning the second half by three games over Boston with a 53–23 record. Other than standout second baseman Cupid Childs, the Spiders had an unremarkable offense. Their success in 1892 was built on pitching strength; Cy Young was the NL&#x27;s most dominant hurler, and 22-year-old George Cuppy had an outstanding rookie year. Following the season, a &quot;World&#x27;s Championship Series&quot; exhibition was played between Cleveland and the first-half winner Boston Beaneaters, but the Spiders could only muster one tie in six games.
In 1895, the Spiders again finished second, this time to the equally rough-and-tumble Baltimore Orioles. Young again led the league in wins, and speedy left fielder Jesse Burkett won the batting title with a .409 average. The Spiders won the Temple Cup, an 1890s postseason series between the first- and second-place teams in the NL. Amid fan rowdyism and garbage-throwing, the Spiders won four of five games against Baltimore, including two wins for Cy Young.

The 1895 championship was the high-water mark for the franchise. The following season, Baltimore and Cleveland again finished first and second in the NL, but in the battle for the 1896 Temple Cup, the second-place Spiders were swept in four games. In 1897, despite a winning record, the franchise finished fifth, a season highlighted by Young throwing the first of three career no-hitters on September 18. The Spiders again finished fifth in 1898.

===1899 season===

In 1899, the Spiders&#x27; owners, the Robison brothers, bought the St. Louis Browns out of bankruptcy and changed their name to the Perfectos. However, they kept the Spiders as well—a blatant conflict of interest. Believing the Perfectos would draw greater attendance in more densely populated St. Louis, the Robisons transferred most of the Cleveland stars, including future Baseball Hall of Famers Cy Young, Jesse Burkett, and Bobby Wallace, to St. Louis. They also shifted a large number of Cleveland home games to the road (for instance, the original Opening Day game was shifted to St. Louis).

With a decimated roster, the Spiders made a wretched showing. They finished with a dismal win-loss record of 20–134 (.130), the worst in MLB history, 84 games behind the pennant-winning Brooklyn Superbas and 35 games behind the next-to-last (11th) place Washington Senators. Their batting records were the worst in the league in runs, hits, doubles, triples, home runs, walks, stolen bases, on-base percentage, and slugging percentage.

The Robisons announced after buying the Perfectos that they intended to run the Spiders as a &quot;sideshow&quot;, and Cleveland fans apparently took them at their word. The Spiders&#x27; first 16 home games drew a total of 3,179 fans, or an average of 199 fans per game. Due to these meager attendance figures, the other 11 NL teams refused to come to League Park, as their cut of the revenue from ticket sales did not even begin to cover their hotel and travel expenses. The Spiders were thus forced to play 85 of their remaining 93 games on the road. Counting the large number of home games that had been shifted to the road earlier in the season, they only played 42 home games during the season, including only eight after July 1, and finished 9–33 (.214) at home and 11–101 (.098) on the road. Only 6,088 fans paid to attend Spiders home games in 1899, for a pitiful average of a mere 145 spectators per game in 9,000-seat League Park.

The 101 road losses is a major-league record that will never be threatened, as current scheduling practices have teams play a maximum of 81 away games. The team&#x27;s longest winning streak of the season was two games, which they accomplished once: on May 20–21. Spiders opponents scored ten or more runs 49 times in 154 games. Pitchers Jim Hughey (4–30) and Charlie Knepper (4–22) tied for the team lead in wins.

The 1962 New York Mets, 40–120 (.250), and the 2024 Chicago White Sox, 41–121 (.253), own the modern records in their respective leagues for the most losses, and thus draw frequent comparisons to the 1899 Spiders for futility.

==Legacy==
The Robisons&#x27; decision to effectively reduce the Spiders to minor league status, along with other intra-league raiding such as that conducted by the Dodgers and to a lesser extent the Pittsburgh Pirates, unwittingly helped pave the way to the National League&#x27;s loss of its major league monopoly. The 12th-place Spiders were one of four teams contracted out of the National League at the end of the 1899 season (the others were the 11th-place Senators, the ninth-place Louisville Colonels and the bankrupt fourth-place Baltimore Orioles). The 1899 fiasco played a role in the major leagues passing a rule which barred one person from owning controlling interest in two clubs.

The Robisons sold the assets of the Spiders team to Charles Somers and John Kilfoyle in 1900. In 1900, the then-minor American League (previously the Western League) fielded a team called the Cleveland Lake Shores. In 1901, after the American League declared major league status, the team was called the Cleveland Blues, eventually the Cleveland Indians, and now the Cleveland Guardians.

The Cleveland Guardians have long claimed Spiders outfielder Louis Sockalexis as the inspiration for their controversial former team name – &quot;Indians&quot; – in use from 1915 to 2021. Sockalexis played three seasons for the Cleveland Spiders, from 1897 to 1899, and is often credited as the first Native American to play professional baseball at the major league level. During his time with the Spiders, the press often referred to the team as the Indians or &quot;Tebeau&#x27;s Indians&quot;. The Cleveland Guardians claim has been disputed, however, including in a 2012 &quot;Cleveland Scene&quot; essay titled &quot;The Curse of Chief Wahoo&quot;, which argues the organization cited Sockalexis in part to justify use of the &quot;Indians&quot; name.

<text>Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s were an American instrumental, R&amp;B, and funk band formed in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1962. The band is considered influential in shaping the sound of Southern soul and Memphis soul. The original members of the group were Booker T. Jones (organ, piano), Steve Cropper (guitar), Lewie Steinberg (bass), and Al Jackson Jr. (drums). In the 1960s, as members of the Mar-Keys, the rotating slate of musicians that served as the house band of Stax Records, they played on hundreds of recordings by artists including Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, Bill Withers, Sam &amp; Dave, Carla Thomas, Rufus Thomas, Johnnie Taylor, and Albert King. They also released instrumental records under their own name, including the 1962 hit single &quot;Green Onions&quot;. As originators of the unique Stax sound, the group was one of the most prolific, respected, and imitated of its era.

In 1965, Steinberg was replaced by Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn, who played with the group until his death in 2012. Al Jackson Jr. was murdered in 1975, after which Dunn, Cropper, and Jones reunited on numerous occasions using various drummers, including Willie Hall, Anton Fig, Steve Jordan and Steve Potts.

The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992, the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, Tennessee in 2008, the Memphis Music Hall of Fame in 2012, and the Blues Hall of Fame in 2019.

Having two white members (initially Cropper and Steinberg, later Cropper and Dunn) and two Black members (Jones and Jackson Jr.), Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s was one of the first racially integrated rock groups, at a time when soul music, and the Memphis music scene in particular, were generally considered the preserve of Black culture.

==Early years: 1962–1964==

Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s formed as the house band of Stax Records, providing backing music for numerous singers, including Wilson Pickett and Otis Redding. In summer 1962, 17-year-old keyboardist Booker T. Jones, 20-year-old guitarist Steve Cropper, and two seasoned players, bassist Lewie Steinberg and drummer Al Jackson Jr. (the latter making his debut with the company) were in the Memphis studio to back the former Sun Records star Billy Lee Riley. During downtime, the four started playing around with a bluesy organ riff. Jim Stewart, the president of Stax Records, was in the control booth. He liked what he heard, and he recorded it. Cropper remembered a riff that Jones had come up with weeks earlier, and before long they had a second track.

Stewart wanted to release the single with the first track, &quot;Behave Yourself&quot;, as the A-side and the second track as the B-side. Cropper and radio disc jockeys thought otherwise; soon, Stax released Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s&#x27; &quot;Green Onions&quot; backed with &quot;Behave Yourself&quot;. In an interview with BBC Radio 2&#x27;s Johnnie Walker in 2008, Cropper recalled the song&#x27;s immediate popularity after Reuben Washington, a disc jockey at Memphis radio station WLOK, played it four times in a row, prompting calls from listeners asking if it had been released.

The single went to number 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart and number 3 on the pop chart. It sold over one million copies and was certified a gold disc. It has been used in numerous movies and trailers, including a pivotal scene in the motion picture &quot;American Graffiti&quot;.

Later in 1962, the band released an all-instrumental album, &quot;Green Onions&quot;. Aside from the title track, a &quot;sequel&quot; (&quot;Mo&#x27; Onions&quot;) and &quot;Behave Yourself&quot;, the album consisted of instrumental covers of popular hits.

Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s continued to issue instrumental singles and albums throughout the 1960s. The group was a successful recording combo in its own right, but most of the work by the musicians in the band during this period was as the core of the &quot;de facto&quot; house band at Stax Records. Members of Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s (often, but not always, performing as a unit, and usually supported by a horn section) performed as the studio backing band for Otis Redding, Sam &amp; Dave, Albert King, Johnnie Taylor, Eddie Floyd, the Staple Singers, Wilson Pickett, Delaney &amp; Bonnie and many others in the 1960s.

They played on hundreds of records, including classics like &quot;Walking the Dog&quot;, &quot;Hold On, I&#x27;m Comin&#x27;&quot; (on which the multi-instrumentalist Jones played tuba over Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn&#x27;s bass line), &quot;Soul Man&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s Making Love&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Loving You Too Long (To Stop Now)&quot;, and &quot;Try a Little Tenderness&quot;, among others. Along with their counterparts in Detroit, Motown&#x27;s Funk Brothers, as a backing band to numerous hits, they are considered to have originated much of the sound of soul music—particularly, in the case of the M.G.&#x27;s, Southern soul—in which &quot;the groove&quot; is paramount.

In the mid-1960s, Jones was often away from Memphis while studying music full-time at Indiana University. Stax writer and producer Isaac Hayes usually stepped in when Jones was unavailable for session work, and on several sessions Jones and Hayes played together with one on organ, the other on piano. However, Hayes was never a regular member of the M.G.&#x27;s, and Jones played on all the records credited to Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s, with one exception: the 1965 hit &quot;Boot-Leg&quot;, a studio jam with Hayes playing keyboards in Jones&#x27;s place. According to Cropper, it had been recorded with the intention of releasing it under the name of the Mar-Keys (the name, which predated the creation of the MG&#x27;s, had sometimes been used on singles by the Stax house band). However, as recordings credited to Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s were meeting with greater commercial success than those credited to the Mar-Keys, the decision was made to credit &quot;Boot-Leg&quot; to Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s, although Jones did not participate in the recording.

Individual session credits notwithstanding, the Stax house band—Cropper, Jackson, Jones, and Steinberg, along with bassist Dunn (Cropper&#x27;s bandmate in the Mar-Keys); keyboardist Isaac Hayes; and various horn players, most frequently Floyd Newman, Wayne Jackson and Andrew Love (the latter two later formed the Memphis Horns)—set a standard for soul music. Whereas the sign outside Detroit&#x27;s pop-oriented Motown Records read &quot;Hitsville U.S.A.&quot;, the marquee outside of the converted movie theater where Stax was based proclaimed &quot;Soulsville U.S.A.&quot;

==Later success: 1965–1969==
Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s consistently issued singles from 1963 to 1965, but only a few made the charts, and none was as successful as &quot;Green Onions&quot;. Their second album, &quot;Soul Dressing&quot;, was released in 1965. Whereas the &quot;Green Onions&quot; album contained mostly covers, every composition but one on &quot;Soul Dressing&quot; was an original. After contributing to that album, Steinberg left the group, and Dunn (who had played on previous Stax sessions) became the group&#x27;s full-time bassist.

During a tour when the band was in Los Angeles playing in a Stax Revue, an informal jam session with three of the M.G.&#x27;s was recorded in Hollywood in 1965, initiated by DJ Magnificent Montague who played congas. The resulting track, &quot;Hole in the Wall&quot;, was issued by Pure Soul Music in October 1965 credited to the Packers with writing shared by Montague, Cropper, Jackson and Jones. The track reached number 43 on Billboard, and made the Top 30 on Cash Box. All other songs released by the Packers had no involvement from Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s.

After a period of commercial decline, Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s finally returned to the Top 40 with the 1967 instrumental &quot;Hip Hug-Her&quot;. It was the first single on which Jones played a Hammond B-3 organ, the instrument with which he is most closely associated (he used a Hammond M-3 on all of the earlier recordings, including &quot;Green Onions&quot;). The group also had a substantial hit with their cover of the Rascals&#x27; &quot;Groovin&#x27;&quot;. Both tracks are included on their album &quot;Hip Hug-Her&quot;, released in the same year.

In the spring of 1967, they joined a group of Stax artists billed as the &quot;Stax/Volt Revue&quot; on a European tour, in which they performed in their own right and backed the other acts. In June of that year, they appeared at the Monterey Pop Festival, playing their own set and then backing Otis Redding, alongside performers like Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, the Who, and Jefferson Airplane. They were invited to perform at the Woodstock Festival in 1969, but drummer Jackson was worried about the helicopter needed to deliver them to the site, and so they decided not to play.

The albums &quot;Doin&#x27; Our Thing&quot; and &quot;Soul Limbo&quot; were released in 1968. The track &quot;Soul Limbo&quot;, featuring marimba by Terry Manning, was a hit (later used by the BBC as their theme for cricket coverage on both TV and, latterly, radio&#x27;s &quot;Test Match Special&quot;), as was their version of &quot;Hang &#x27;Em High&quot;. In 1969, the band scored their second biggest hit with &quot;Time Is Tight&quot;, from the soundtrack to the movie &quot;Up Tight!&quot;, scored by Jones, which reached No. 6 on the Billboard pop charts.

For the 1969 album &quot;Damifiknow!&quot;, the Mar-Keys name was revived. The members of the group were explicitly identified in the album credits as the sextet of Steve Cropper, Duck Dunn, Booker T. Jones, Al Jackson, and horn players Andrew Love and Wayne Jackson (no relation to Al). The album didn&#x27;t receive much attention, and the core quartet soon returned to playing and performing as Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s.

==Reinterpreting the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Abbey Road&quot; and gig with CCR==
In 1969, Dunn and Jones, in particular, had become admirers of the Beatles, especially their work on &quot;Abbey Road&quot;. The appreciation was mutual, as the Beatles had been musically influenced by the M.G.&#x27;s. John Lennon was a Stax fan, who fondly called the group &quot;Book a Table and the Maitre d&#x27;s&quot; (in 1974, Lennon facetiously credited himself and his studio band as &quot;Dr. Winston and Booker Table and the Maitre d&#x27;s&quot; on his original R&amp;B-inspired instrumental, &quot;Beef Jerky&quot;). Paul McCartney, like Dunn, played bass melodically, without straying from the rhythm or the groove. The Beatles had even floated the possibility of recording their 1966 album &quot;Revolver&quot; at Stax, but backed out when fans besieged the Memphis studio.

In 1970, Lennon&#x27;s wish was granted, in a sense, when Booker T. and the M.G.&#x27;s recorded &quot;McLemore Avenue&quot; (named for the street where Stax Records was located), on which they performed instrumental cover versions of thirteen of the songs on &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, condensing twelve of them into three medleys. The album&#x27;s front cover is a parody of the front cover of &quot;Abbey Road&quot;; the back cover, with the blurred image of a mini-skirted woman at the edge of the photo, also mirrors that of &quot;Abbey Road&quot;.

In 1970 Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s sat in with Creedence Clearwater Revival (CCR) for a jam, and they were the opening act for that band&#x27;s January 31 performance at the Oakland Coliseum, which was recorded for the CCR album &quot;The Concert&quot;.

==Jones&#x27;s departure from Stax and &quot;Melting Pot&quot;==
In 1971 Booker T. and the M.G.&#x27;s released what would be their last Stax single, &quot;Melting Pot&quot;, and their last Stax album, also called &quot;Melting Pot&quot;. &quot;Melting Pots repetitive groove-oriented drumming, loping bass line, and tight rhythm guitar made it an underground hit popular in New York City block parties. The song has often been sampled by rappers and techno DJs. The full-length album version of the track is over eight minutes long and contains a passage (not included on the single) featuring some particularly powerful flourishes from Jones&#x27;s Hammond B-3. &quot;Melting Pot&quot; also includes the tuneful Native American–influenced track &quot;Fuquawi&quot;, which was also released on a single, coupled with &quot;Jamaica This Morning&quot;.

Before &quot;Melting Pot&quot; was recorded, Jones had already left Stax and moved to California, because he disliked the changes that had occurred under the label&#x27;s new chairman Al Bell. Part of the album was recorded at The Record Plant in New York City, not the Stax Studio, because Jones did not want to record there and instead opted for a different sound, hence the change of studios and cities between MG&#x27;s gigs. Like Jones, Cropper had also become unhappy with business affairs at Stax and soon left to open his own studio in Memphis. However, the rhythm section of Dunn and Jackson remained on at Stax and did session and production work. Jackson (who had been in Hi Records producer Willie Mitchell&#x27;s band) played on and wrote many of Al Green&#x27;s biggest hits.

Without Jones, the group (billed simply as the MG&#x27;s) released a &quot;final&quot; single, &quot;Jamaica This Morning&quot;, in October 1971. It failed to chart, and the group name was retired for the time being.

==1970s reunions==
In 1973, Dunn and Stax session guitarist Bobby Manuel recruited Hammond B-3 organist Carson Whitsett to be part of a band that was to back Stefan Anderson, a promising new Stax artist. Al Jackson was later brought in. The project did not ultimately yield any results, but the rehearsals were promising, prompting Jackson and Dunn to reform the M.G.&#x27;s. This version of the band featured Whitsett in place of Jones, so it was billed as simply &quot;the MG&#x27;s&quot;.

The 1973 album entitled &quot;The MG&#x27;s&quot;, with Manuel and Whitsett replacing Cropper and Jones, was not commercially successful. Whitsett went on to back Bobby &quot;Blue&quot; Bland, Little Milton, and Kathy Mattea, and his songs were recorded by Johnnie Taylor, Solomon Burke, B. B. King, Etta James, Conway Twitty, and Lorrie Morgan. Manuel became a staple of the Memphis music scene, playing with everybody from Al Green to Albert King, and later founded HighStacks Records (the name being a tribute to both Stax and Hi Records).

After a promising meeting in late September 1975, Jones and Cropper (who were now living in Los Angeles) and Jackson and Dunn (still in Memphis), decided to give each other three months to finish up all of their individual projects. They would then devote three years to what would be renamed &quot;Booker T. Jones &amp; the Memphis Group&quot;. Nine days later (October 1), Al Jackson, the man Cropper would remember as &quot;the greatest drummer to ever walk the earth&quot;, was murdered in his home.

In 1975, Al Bell tasked Stax Producer/Musician Terry Manning (who had worked on several of the MGs albums) with a project which involved taking songs previously recorded by the classic Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s lineup of Jones/Cropper/Dunn/Jackson, but which had never been completed or released. Manning found and performed post production in the Stax studios on 12 songs, and the album was released in the UK and France in 1976 as &quot;Union Extended.&quot;

The remaining three members and drummer Willie Hall (a session musician who had played on many Stax hits, such as Isaac Hayes&#x27;s &quot;Theme from &quot;Shaft&quot;&quot;) regrouped under their old name, Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s, and recorded the album &quot;Universal Language&quot; for Asylum Records in 1977. The album did not meet with either commercial or critical success, and the band once again dissolved.

Over the next decade, Cropper, Dunn and Jones remained active, producing, writing, and playing with other artists. All three joined Levon Helm, formerly the drummer of the Band, as part of his RCO All-Stars in 1977. Also in that year, Cropper and Dunn became part of the Blues Brothers band, appearing on the number-one album &quot;Briefcase Full of Blues&quot;. Cropper, Dunn and Hall also appeared in the 1980 movie &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;, starring Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi. Cropper, Dunn and Hall later reprised their roles in &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot;.

==1980s to the present==

In 1980 the hit feature film &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; featured Cropper, Dunn and Hall as part of the primary band backing the Blues Brothers.

In 1986, former co-owner of Atlantic Records Jerry Wexler asked the group to be the house band for Atlantic Records&#x27; 40th anniversary celebration. The night before the gig, Jones came down with food poisoning, so Paul Shaffer stepped in at the last minute. The earlier rehearsals (with Jones, Cropper, Dunn, and drummer Anton Fig of Shaffer&#x27;s &quot;World&#x27;s Most Dangerous Band&quot;, featured on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;) went so well that the group decided to play some dates together. Over the next few years, they played together occasionally, completing some gigs in the UK in 1990.

In 1992, after Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Bob Dylan asked Jones, Cropper, and Dunn to serve as the house band (with Fig and Jim Keltner on drums) for his &quot;30th Anniversary Concert&quot;, commemorating his thirty years in the music business, at which they backed Dylan, Stevie Wonder, Johnny Cash, Eric Clapton, and George Harrison, among others.

At the concert, Neil Young asked the group to back him on his 1993 world tour, and Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s toured with Neil Young, backing him on his own compositions. The set list often included a cover of &quot;(Sittin&#x27; On) The Dock of the Bay&quot; (the original recording by Otis Redding had, of course, featured Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s).

In 1994, the group recorded its first album in 17 years, &quot;That&#x27;s the Way It Should Be&quot;. Steve Jordan was the drummer on most tracks.

In 1995, when the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame opened its museum in Cleveland, Ohio, the M.G.&#x27;s served as the house band for the opening ceremonies, playing behind Aretha Franklin, Sam Moore, John Fogerty, and Al Green, as well as performing themselves.

Jones, Dunn, and Al Jackson&#x27;s cousin, drummer Steve Potts, backed Neil Young on his 2002 album &quot;Are You Passionate?&quot;. Cropper, along with Isaac Hayes and Sam Moore, welcomed Stax president Jim Stewart into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002. Cropper and Hayes were later inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s, usually with Steve Potts on drums, still play select dates. They have been called the most influential stylists in modern American music. In early 2008 they backed singer Guy Sebastian on a sold-out tour of Australia.

In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the group #93 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, and in 2007, the group received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Also in 2004, Eric Clapton featured Jones, Cropper, and Dunn as the house band for the first &quot;Crossroads Guitar Festival&quot; a two-day event held at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, featuring outstanding performers in various musical genres who play guitar as their primary instrument. A two-disc DVD of the show was released in the same year.

Jones, in collaboration with the band Drive-By Truckers, released the album &quot;Potato Hole&quot;, featuring Neil Young on guitar, in 2009. He released &quot;The Road from Memphis&quot; in 2011; the album won a Grammy Award.

On May 13, 2012, Dunn died following two concerts in Tokyo. Since his death, the band has, for the most part, gone their separate ways. Cropper is currently touring with the Blues Brothers, and Jones is performing as a solo artist as well as releasing new music under his name only.

==Band name==
For many years, Stax publicity releases stated that the initials in the band&#x27;s name stood for &quot;Memphis Group&quot;, not the MG sports car.

Musician and record producer Chips Moman, who worked at Stax Records when the band was formed, claimed that the band was named after his sports car, and only after he left the label did Stax&#x27;s publicity department declare that &quot;M.G.&quot; stood for &quot;Memphis Group&quot;. Moman had played with Jones and Steinberg in an earlier Stax backing group called the Triumphs, which was also named after his car.

Jones, in a 2007 interview on National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;Fresh Air with Terry Gross&quot;, confirmed Moman&#x27;s account of the origin of the group&#x27;s name. Jones has re-confirmed this story on several occasions since, most recently as a guest on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on May 9, 2012.

Stax historian Rob Bowman has averred that the reason the label obscured the story of the meaning of the name &quot;M.G.&#x27;s&quot; (and concocted the &quot;Memphis Group&quot; explanation) was to avoid claims of trademark infringement from the manufacturers of the car. In a 2019 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Steve Cropper confirmed the motor car origin and &quot;Memphis Group&quot; explanation, but added &#x27;we were being interviewed and someone asked: &quot;What does MG actually stand for?&quot; Duck Dunn said: &quot;Musical geniuses!&quot;&#x27;

<text>Princess Lilian of Belgium, Princess of Réthy (born Mary Lilian Henriette Lucie Josephine Ghislaine Baels; – ) was the second wife of King Leopold III of Belgium. Born in the United Kingdom and raised in Belgium, she became a volunteer as a car driver who transported wounded Belgians and French to the hospital in Bruges during World War II. Lilian married King Leopold III in 1941 and became consort of the Belgian monarch. The couple had three children. She was also a stepmother to Leopold III&#x27;s children from Queen Astrid and became the &quot;first lady&quot; of Belgium during the first nine years of her stepson King Baudouin&#x27;s reign. Her charity work revolved around medicine and cardiology.

==Early life and education==
Mary Lilian Baels was born in Highbury, London, England, where her parents had fled during World War I. She was one of the nine children of Henri Baels from Ostend and his wife, Anne Marie de Visscher, a member of the Belgian nobility from Dentergem. Lilian was initially educated in English, but, upon her parents&#x27; return to Belgium, she attended the College of the Sacred Heart in Ostend, where she learned Dutch. Lilian continued her studies in French at the Institute of the Sacred Heart in Brussels. She was also fluent in German. Lilian completed her education by attending a convent school in London and attending finishing schools in France, Switzerland and Austria.

In addition to academic work, Lilian participated extensively in sports, such as skiing, swimming, golfing, and hunting. Above all, however, she enjoyed, as did her father, literature and the arts. As a teenager, she was presented to King George V and Queen Mary of the United Kingdom at Buckingham Palace.

==Friendship with the Belgian royal family==
In 1933, Lilian Baels, as a student at the Institute of the Sacred Heart, saw her future husband King Leopold III of Belgium, then the Duke of Brabant, for the first time during a military review that was conducted by King Albert I at the location near to the school. Leopold was at the time married to Astrid of Sweden. When the students in her class were given the task of writing an essay on a topic of their choice, Lilian decided to write on the then-Prince Leopold. A few years later, when her father, then Governor of West Flanders, took his daughter to a public ceremony, she had the occasion to meet King Leopold, who presided at the event, for the second time.

In 1937, again on another ceremonial occasion, Lilian and her mother met the King, who was now a widower after Queen Astrid&#x27;s death in an automobile accident in 1935. Soon afterwards, King Leopold III contacted Governor Baels to invite him and his daughter to join him in a golfing party the next day. Lilian also saw the King in 1939 at a garden-party organised in honour of Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, and later at the golf course at Laeken, where she was invited to lunch by King Leopold&#x27;s mother, Queen Elisabeth of Belgium. A final golf party near the Belgian coast occurred in May 1940, shortly before the Nazi invasion of Belgium.

==Beginnings of World War II in Belgium==

Following the Nazi invasion of Belgium, Lilian&#x27;s mother put herself at the service of the Red Cross during the Belgian and Allied military campaign against the invaders. Lilian helped her mother actively in her new role, transporting wounded Belgian and French to the hospital of St. John in Bruges by car and helped to evacuate the elderly from an asylum in Aalst, which was inside the combat zone. Meanwhile, her father, Governor Baels, attempted to alleviate the plight of his invaded province. On 18 May, Henri Baels went in search of the Minister of the Interior, thinking he had left for France, to obtain his signature for an important relief measure. On his journey, however, Governor Baels had a car accident and injured his legs. He was admitted to a hospital in Le Havre. As the military situation in Belgium headed towards disaster, his wife decided to bring her daughters to safety in France, and Lilian drove the family car on the trip. Governor Baels&#x27; wife and daughters met him again, by pure chance, in a hospital in Poitiers. Baels was subsequently accused of having abandoned his post as Governor without justification by fleeing to France. He succeeded, however, in obtaining an audience with the King following the capitulation of the Belgian army on 28 May 1940 and the King&#x27;s own imprisonment by the Germans at Laeken Castle. Baels and his daughter Lilian, who drove him to the audience, explained the real circumstances of his departure from Belgium, and the Governor was thereby vindicated. Subsequently, Lilian and her father returned to France and occupied themselves with the care of Belgian refugees in the region of Anglet. After Belgium&#x27;s liberation, Henri Baels was accused of collaborating with the Nazis during the war, while he lived in France.

==Marriage and controversy==
In 1941, at the invitation of Queen Elisabeth, Lilian visited Laeken Castle, where King Leopold III, now a prisoner of war, was held by the Germans under house arrest. This visit was followed by several others, with the result that Leopold III and Lilian fell in love. Leopold proposed marriage to Lilian in July 1941, but Lilian declined his offer because &quot;Kings only marry princesses,&quot; she said. Queen Elisabeth, however, prevailed upon Lilian to accept the King&#x27;s offer. Lilian agreed to marry the King, but declined the title of queen. Instead, the King gave Lilian the title Princess of Belgium, a.k.a. Princess of Réthy, with the style &quot;Royal Highness&quot;. It was agreed that descendants of the King&#x27;s new marriage would be titled Prince/Princess of Belgium with the style &quot;Royal Highness&quot; but excluded from succession to the throne.

Leopold and Lilian initially planned to hold their official, civil marriage after the end of the war and the liberation of Belgium, but in the meantime, a secret religious marriage ceremony took place on 11 September 1941, in the chapel of Laeken Castle, in the presence of King Leopold&#x27;s mother Queen Elisabeth, Lilian&#x27;s father Henri Baels, Cardinal van Roey (who worked as the Archbishop of Mechelen and primate of Belgium) and one of the King&#x27;s old friends. Lilian was wearing Queen Elisabeth&#x27;s bridal veil during her wedding. This actually contravened Belgian law, which required that the religious wedding be preceded by the civil one. Although Lilian and Leopold had originally planned to postpone their civil marriage until the end of the war, Lilian was soon expecting her first child, necessitating a civil marriage, which took place on 6 December 1941. The civil marriage automatically made Lilian a Belgian princess. Lilian proved a devoted wife to the King and an affectionate and vivacious stepmother to his children by his first wife, Queen Astrid. Her stepchildren—Joséphine-Charlotte, Baudouin, and Albert II—adored her and they called her &quot;Mother&quot;.

When the civil marriage of Leopold and Lilian was made public in a pastoral letter by Cardinal van Roey read throughout Belgian churches in December 1941, there was a mixed reaction in Belgium. Some showed sympathy for the new couple, sending flowers and messages of congratulations to the palace at Laeken. Others, however, argued that the marriage was incompatible with the King&#x27;s status as a prisoner of war and his stated desire to share the hard fate of his conquered people and captive army, and was a betrayal of Queen Astrid&#x27;s memory. They also branded Lilian as a social-climber. One of the leading Belgian newspapers rebuked King Leopold: &quot;Sire, we thought you had your face turned towards us in mourning. Instead you had it hidden in the shoulder of a woman.&quot; Leopold and Lilian were also blamed for violating Belgian law by holding their religious marriage before their civil one. These criticisms would continue for many years, even after the war.

According to Lilian&#x27;s account, the news of her secret marriage with King Leopold upset and worried her mother, who foresaw that it would provoke a political storm. Her mother quoted &quot;My little one, you don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in store for you. It will be appalling, they will all attack you, you will have a terribly hard life.&quot; Queen Astrid&#x27;s parents, Prince Carl and Princess Ingeborg of Sweden, did not take the hard line against King Leopold&#x27;s remarriage. Princess Ingeborg told a Belgian journalist that she couldn&#x27;t understand all the animus in Belgium against the king&#x27;s second marriage, that it was perfectly natural for a young man not to want to remain alone forever. She said she was happy about her son-in-law&#x27;s new marriage, both for his own sake and for the sake of her grandchildren.

==Deportation to Nazi Germany==
In 1944, the Belgian royal family was deported to Nazi Germany, where they were strictly guarded by 70 members of the SS, under harsh conditions. The family suffered from a deficient diet and lived with the constant fear that they would be massacred by their jailers, as an act of revenge on the part of the Nazis, angered at their defeat (by now becoming increasingly certain) by the Allies, or that they would be caught in the cross-fire between Allied forces and their captors, who might try to make a desperate last stand at the site of the royal family&#x27;s internment. The family&#x27;s fears were not unfounded. At one point, a Nazi official tried to give them cyanide, pretending it was a mixture of vitamins to compensate for the captives&#x27; poor diet during their imprisonment. Lilian and Leopold, however, were rightly suspicious and did not take the pills or give them to their children. During their period of captivity in Germany, (and later Austria), Leopold and Lilian jointly homeschooled the royal children. The King taught scientific subjects; his wife, arts and literature. In 1945, the Belgian royal family was released by the American 106th Cavalry Regiment under the command of Lieutenant General Alexander Patch, who thereafter became a close friend of King Leopold and Princess Lilian until he died 2 months later.

==&quot;Royal Question&quot; and the aftermath==
Following his liberation, King Leopold was unable to return to Belgium (by now liberated as well) due to a political controversy that arose in Belgium surrounding his actions during World War II. He was accused of having betrayed the Allies by an allegedly premature surrender in 1940 and of collaborating with the Nazis during the occupation of Belgium. In 1946, a juridical commission was constituted in Brussels to investigate the King&#x27;s conduct during the war and occupation. During this period, the king and his family lived in exile in Pregny-Chambésy, Switzerland, and the King&#x27;s younger brother, Prince Charles, Count of Flanders, was made regent of the country. The commission of inquiry eventually exonerated Leopold of the charges and he was able, in 1950, to return to Belgium and resume his royal duties. Political agitation against the King continued, however, leading to civil disturbances in what became known as the Royal Question. As a result, in 1951, to avoid tearing the country apart and to save the embattled monarchy, King Leopold III abdicated in favour of his 21-year-old son, Prince Baudouin.

During the first nine years of her stepson&#x27;s reign, Lilian acted as &quot;first lady&quot; of Belgium. At the same period, Lilian also became the senior lady of the household. King Leopold and Princess Lilian continued to live in the royal palace at Laeken until Baudouin&#x27;s marriage to Doña Fabiola de Mora y Aragón in 1960.

== Life in Argenteuil and charity work ==
In 1960, following the marriage of King Baudouin, Leopold and Lilian moved out of the royal palace to a government property, the estate of Argenteuil, Belgium. Lilian employed various designers to transform the dilapidated mansion on the property into a distinguished and elegant residence for the ex-King. Argenteuil became a cultural centre under the auspices of Leopold and Lilian, who cultivated the friendship of numerous prominent writers, scientists, mathematicians, and doctors. Leopold and Lilian also travelled extensively all over the world.

Following her son Prince Alexandre&#x27;s heart surgery in Boston, Massachusetts in 1957, Princess Lilian became very interested in medicine, and, in particular, in cardiology, and founded a Cardiological Foundation in 1958 to promote new forms of treatment for cardiovascular diseases, which, through its work, has saved the lives of hundreds of people. Both before and after her husband&#x27;s death in 1983, Lilian pursued her interests in intellectual and scientific spheres with energy and passion. Princess Lilian also personally financed a number of Belgian children who needed to go to the United States for operations. Princess Lilian and her husband appeared in public at a ceremony for the Brussels Exhibition of 1958. In 1961, Lilian inaugurated a new cardiac research laboratory at the Hospital Saint-Pierre in Brussels.

In 1962, &quot;Pan&quot;, a Belgian satirical journal, followed by two French tabloids, released a publication about the private life of Lilian. On December 31, Leopold submitted a complaint to the press. He wrote that &quot;For more than twenty years, my wife has shared my joys and my sorrows: she has restored a home to me, she has helped me to raise the children Queen Astrid gave me, and she has consecrated herself to them with a devotion and a tenderness that have made them what they are today.&quot; He also concluded that &quot;My wife and I wish for nothing more than to dwell in peace at Argenteuil, and devote ourselves to scientific, philanthropic and social activities in which we take a deep interest.&quot;

Her belongings from the chateau were put up at auction in Amsterdam.

==Death==

Princess Lilian died at the Domaine d&#x27;Argenteuil in Waterloo, Belgium. Before her death, she had expressed the desire to be buried at Argenteuil. Her wish was denied, however, and she was buried in the royal crypt of the Church of Our Lady, Laeken, Belgium, with King Leopold and his first wife, Queen Astrid. Queen Fabiola and Lilian&#x27;s stepchildren attended the funeral, as did Lilian&#x27;s son Alexandre and her daughter Marie-Esmeralda. Lilian&#x27;s long-estranged daughter Marie-Christine did not attend.

== Legacy ==
===Character and reputation===
Lilian was known as a woman who was terribly strict and demanding towards herself, and, a result, as one who could be excessively severe with others as well. Due to the controversy surrounding King Leopold&#x27;s wartime actions, and, in particular, his second marriage, Lilian was widely unpopular in Belgium. However, she also had a circle of close friends, who saw her as a woman of great beauty, charm, intelligence, elegance, strength of character, kindness, generosity, humor and culture. They admired her for the courage and dignity with which she faced a long series of personal attacks, both during the Royal Question and for decades afterwards. According to Queen Elisabeth&#x27;s lady-in-waiting, Lilian was &quot;a true princess in the full sense of the term.&quot;

===Fashion===
Jacqueline Kennedy, First Lady of the United States as wife of John F. Kennedy, cited Princess Lilian as a fashion inspiration. Lilian&#x27;s wardrobe and jewelry collection were auctioned by Sotheby&#x27;s in 2003.

===Philanthropy===
Following Princess Lilian&#x27;s death, a cardiological conference was organised and prominent doctors and surgeons such as DeBakey and many others rendered an homage to Lilian and her contributions to cardiology through Cardiological Foundation.

==Children==

Lilian had three children with King Leopold III:

*Prince &quot;Alexandre&quot; Emmanuel Henri Albert Marie Léopold of Belgium (1942–2009). Married Léa Wolman in 1991 (the marriage became public knowledge in 1998).

<text>Industrial design is a process of design applied to physical products that are to be manufactured by mass production. It is the creative act of determining and defining a product&#x27;s form and features, which takes place in advance of the manufacture or production of the product. Industrial manufacture consists of predetermined, standardized and repeated, often automated, acts of replication, while craft-based design is a process or approach in which the form of the product is determined personally by the product&#x27;s creator largely concurrent with the act of its production.

All manufactured products are the result of a design process, but the nature of this process can vary. It can be conducted by an individual or a team, and such a team could include people with varied expertise (e.g. designers, engineers, business experts, etc.). It can emphasize intuitive creativity or calculated scientific decision-making, and often emphasizes a mix of both. It can be influenced by factors as varied as materials, production processes, business strategy, and prevailing social, commercial, or aesthetic attitudes. Industrial design, as an applied art, most often focuses on a combination of aesthetics and user-focused considerations, but also often provides solutions for problems of form, function, physical ergonomics, marketing, brand development, sustainability, and sales.

==History==

===Precursors===
For several millennia before the onset of industrialization, design, technical expertise, and manufacturing was often done by individual crafts people, who determined the form of a product at the point of its creation, according to their own manual skill, the requirements of their clients, experience accumulated through their own experimentation, and knowledge passed on to them through training or apprenticeship.

The division of labour that underlies the practice of industrial design did have precedents in the pre-industrial era. The growth of trade in the medieval period led to the emergence of large workshops in cities such as Florence, Venice, Nuremberg, and Bruges, where groups of more specialized craftsmen made objects with common forms through the repetitive duplication of models which defined by their shared training and technique. Competitive pressures in the early 16th century led to the emergence in Italy and Germany of pattern books: collections of engravings illustrating decorative forms and motifs which could be applied to a wide range of products, and whose creation took place in advance of their application. The use of drawing to specify how something was to be constructed later was first developed by architects and shipwrights during the Italian Renaissance.

In the 17th century, the growth of artistic patronage in centralized monarchical states such as France led to large government-operated manufacturing operations epitomized by the Gobelins Manufactory, opened in Paris in 1667 by Louis XIV. Here teams of hundreds of craftsmen, including specialist artists, decorators and engravers, produced sumptuously decorated products ranging from tapestries and furniture to metalwork and coaches, all under the creative supervision of the King&#x27;s leading artist Charles Le Brun. This pattern of large-scale royal patronage was repeated in the court porcelain factories of the early 18th century, such as the Meissen porcelain workshops established in 1709 by the Grand Duke of Saxony, where patterns from a range of sources, including court goldsmiths, sculptors, and engravers, were used as models for the vessels and figurines for which it became famous. As long as reproduction remained craft-based, however, the form and artistic quality of the product remained in the hands of the individual craftsman, and tended to decline as the scale of production increased.

===Birth of industrial design===
The emergence of industrial design is specifically linked to the growth of industrialization and mechanization that began with the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain in the mid 18th century. The rise of industrial manufacture changed the way objects were made, urbanization changed patterns of consumption, the growth of empires broadened tastes and diversified markets, and the emergence of a wider middle class created demand for fashionable styles from a much larger and more heterogeneous population.

The first use of the term &quot;industrial design&quot; is often attributed to the industrial designer Joseph Claude Sinel in 1919 (although he himself denied this in interviews), but the discipline predates 1919 by at least a decade. Christopher Dresser is considered among the first independent industrial designers. Industrial design&#x27;s origins lie in the industrialization of consumer products. For instance, the Deutscher Werkbund (a precursor to the Bauhaus founded in 1907 by Peter Behrens and others) was a state-sponsored effort to integrate traditional crafts and industrial mass-production techniques, to put Germany on a competitive footing with Great Britain and the United States.

The earliest published use of the term may have been in &quot;The Art-Union&quot;, 15 September 1840.

&quot;The Practical Draughtsman&#x27;s Book of Industrial Design&quot; by Jacques-Eugène Armengaud was printed in 1853. The subtitle of the (translated) work explains, that it wants to offer a &quot;complete course of mechanical, engineering, and architectural drawing.&quot; The study of those types of technical drawing, according to Armengaud, belongs to the field of industrial design. This work paved the way for a big expansion in the field of drawing education in France, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

Robert Lepper helped to establish one of the USA&#x27;s first industrial design degree programs in 1934 at Carnegie Institute of Technology.

==Education==
Product design and industrial design overlap in the fields of user interface design, information design, and interaction design. Various schools of industrial design specialize in one of these aspects, ranging from pure art colleges and design schools (product styling), to mixed programs of engineering and design, to related disciplines such as exhibit design and interior design, to schools that almost completely subordinated aesthetic design to concerns of usage and ergonomics, the so-called &quot;functionalist&quot; school. Except for certain functional areas of overlap between industrial design and engineering design, the former is considered an applied art while the latter is an applied science. Educational programs in the U.S. for engineering require accreditation by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) in contrast to programs for industrial design which are accredited by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD). Of course, engineering education requires heavy training in mathematics and physical sciences, which is not typically required in industrial design education.

===Institutions===
Most industrial designers complete a design or related program at a vocational school or university. Relevant programs include graphic design, interior design, industrial design, architectural technology, and drafting. Diplomas and degrees in industrial design are offered at vocational schools and universities worldwide. Diplomas and degrees take two to four years of study. The study results in a Bachelor of Industrial Design (B.I.D.), Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) or Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.). Afterwards, the bachelor programme can be extended to postgraduate degrees such as Master of Design, Master of Fine Arts and others to a Master of Arts or Master of Science.

==Definition==

Industrial design studies function and form—and the connection between product, user, and environment. Generally, industrial design professionals work in small scale design, rather than overall design of complex systems such as buildings or ships. Industrial designers don&#x27;t usually design motors, electrical circuits, or gearing that make machines move, but they may affect technical aspects through usability design and form relationships. Usually, they work with other professionals such as engineers who focus on the mechanical and other functional aspects of the product, assuring functionality and manufacturability, and with marketers to identify and fulfill customer needs and expectations.
Design, itself, is often difficult to describe to non-designers because the meaning accepted by the design community is not made of words. Instead, the definition is created as a result of acquiring a critical framework for the analysis and creation of artifacts. One of the many accepted (but intentionally unspecific) definitions of design originates from Carnegie Mellon&#x27;s School of Design: &quot;Everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones.&quot; This applies to new artifacts, whose existing state is undefined, and previously created artifacts, whose state stands to be improved.

Industrial design can overlap significantly with engineering design, and in different countries the boundaries of the two concepts can vary, but in general engineering focuses principally on functionality or utility of products, whereas industrial design focuses principally on &quot;aesthetic and user-interface&quot; aspects of products. In many jurisdictions this distinction is effectively defined by credentials and/or licensure required to engage in the practice of engineering. &quot;Industrial design&quot; as such does not overlap much with the engineering sub-discipline of industrial engineering, except for the latter&#x27;s sub-specialty of ergonomics.

At the 29th General Assembly in Gwangju, South Korea, 2015, the Professional Practise Committee unveiled a renewed definition of industrial design as follows:
&quot;Industrial Design is a strategic problem-solving process that drives innovation, builds business success and leads to a better quality of life through innovative products, systems, services and experiences.&quot;
An extended version of this definition is as follows:
&quot;Industrial Design is a strategic problem-solving process that drives innovation, builds business success and leads to a better quality of life through innovative products, systems, services and experiences. Industrial Design bridges the gap between what is and what&#x27;s possible. It is a trans-disciplinary profession that harnesses creativity to resolve problems and co-create solutions with the intent of making a product, system, service, experience or a business, better. At its heart, Industrial Design provides a more optimistic way of looking at the future by reframing problems as opportunities. It links innovation, technology, research, business and customers to provide new value and competitive advantage across economic, social and environmental spheres.
Industrial Designers place the human in the centre of the process. They acquire a deep understanding of user needs through empathy and apply a pragmatic, user centric problem solving process to design products, systems, services and experiences. They are strategic stakeholders in the innovation process and are uniquely positioned to bridge varied professional disciplines and business interests. They value the economic, social and environmental impact of their work and their contribution towards co-creating a better quality of life. &quot;

==Design process==

Although the process of design may be considered &#x27;creative,&#x27; many analytical processes also take place. In fact, many industrial designers often use various design methodologies in their creative process. Some of the processes that are commonly used are user research, sketching, comparative product research, model making, prototyping and testing. The design process is iterative, involving dozens or even hundreds of ideas being considered until the final design is reached. Industrial designers often utilize 3D software, computer-aided industrial design and CAD programs to move from concept to production. They may also build a prototype or scaled down sketch models through a 3D printing process or using other materials such as paper, balsa wood, various foams, or clay for modeling. They may then use industrial CT scanning to test for interior defects and generate a CAD model. From this the manufacturing process may be modified to improve the product.

Product characteristics specified by industrial designers may include the overall form of the object, the location of details with respect to one another, colors, texture, form, and aspects concerning the use of the product. Additionally, they may specify aspects concerning the production process, choice of materials and the way the product is presented to the consumer at the point of sale. The inclusion of industrial designers in a product development process may lead to added value by improving usability, lowering production costs, and developing more appealing products.

Industrial design may also focus on technical concepts, products, and processes. In addition to aesthetics, human factors, ergonomics and anthropometrics, it can also encompass engineering, usefulness, market placement, and other concerns—such as psychology, and the emotional attachment of the user. These values and accompanying aspects that form the basis of industrial design can vary—between different schools of thought, and among practicing designers.

==Industrial design rights==

Industrial design rights are intellectual property rights that make exclusive the visual design of objects that are not purely utilitarian. A design patent would also be considered under this category. An industrial design consists of the creation of a shape, configuration or composition of pattern or color, or combination of pattern and color in three-dimensional form containing aesthetic value. An industrial design can be a two- or three-dimensional pattern used to produce a product, industrial commodity or handicraft. Under the Hague Agreement Concerning the International Deposit of Industrial Designs, a WIPO-administered treaty, a procedure for an international registration exists. An applicant can file for a single international deposit with WIPO or with the national office in a country party to the treaty. The design will then be protected in as many member countries of the treaty as desired.

In 2022, about 1.1 million industrial design applications were filed worldwide. This represents a decrease of 3% on 2021, marking a first drop in filings since 2014.

=== Hague top applicants ===
The Hague System for the International Registration of Industrial Designs provides an international mechanism that secures protection of up to 100 designs in multiple countries or regions, through a single international application. International design applications are filed directly through WIPO. The domestic legal framework of each designated contracting party governs the design protection provided by the resulting international registrations. The Hague System does not require the applicant to file a national or regional design application.

==Examples of industrial design==


A number of industrial designers have made such a significant impact on culture and daily life that their work is documented by historians of social science. Alvar Aalto, renowned as an architect, also designed a significant number of household items, such as chairs, stools, lamps, a tea-cart, and vases. Raymond Loewy was a prolific American designer who is responsible for the Royal Dutch Shell corporate logo, the original BP logo (in use until 2000), the PRR S1 steam locomotive, the Studebaker Starlight (including the later bulletnose), as well as Schick electric razors, Electrolux refrigerators, short-wave radios, Le Creuset French ovens, and a complete line of modern furniture, among many other items.

Richard Teague, who spent most of his career with the American Motors Corporation, originated the concept of using interchangeable body panels so as to create a wide array of different vehicles using the same stampings. He was responsible for such unique automotive designs as the Pacer, Gremlin, Matador coupe, Jeep Cherokee, and the complete interior of the Eagle Premier.

Milwaukee&#x27;s Brooks Stevens was best known for his Milwaukee Road Skytop Lounge car and Oscar Mayer Wienermobile designs, among others.

Viktor Schreckengost designed bicycles manufactured by Murray bicycles for Murray and Sears, Roebuck and Company. With engineer Ray Spiller, he designed the first truck with a cab-over-engine configuration, a design in use to this day. Schreckengost also founded The Cleveland Institute of Art&#x27;s school of industrial design.

Oskar Barnack was a German optical engineer, precision mechanic, industrial designer, and the father of 35mm photography. He developed the Leica, which became the hallmark for photography for 50 years, and remains a high-water mark for mechanical and optical design.

Charles and Ray Eames were most famous for their pioneering furniture designs, such as the Eames Lounge Chair Wood and Eames Lounge Chair. Other influential designers included Henry Dreyfuss, Eliot Noyes, John Vassos, and Russel Wright.

Dieter Rams is a German industrial designer closely associated with the consumer products company Braun and the Functionalist school of industrial design.

German industrial designer Luigi Colani, who designed cars for automobile manufacturers including Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Lancia, Volkswagen, and BMW, was also known to the general public for his unconventional approach to industrial design. He had expanded in numerous areas ranging from mundane household items, instruments and furniture to trucks, uniforms and entire rooms. A grand piano created by Colani, the &quot;Pegasus&quot;, is manufactured and sold by the Schimmel piano company.

Many of Apple&#x27;s recent products were designed by Sir Jonathan Ive.

<text>Sam &amp; Dave were an American soul and R&amp;B duo who performed together from 1961 until 1981. The tenor (higher) voice was Sam Moore (1935–2025) and the baritone/tenor (lower) voice was Dave Prater (1937–1988).

Nicknamed &quot;Double Dynamite&quot;, &quot;The Sultans of Sweat&quot;, and &quot;The Dynamic Duo&quot; for their gritty, gospel-infused performances, Sam &amp; Dave are considered one of the greatest live acts of the 1960s. Many subsequent musicians have named them as an influence, including Bruce Springsteen, Al Green, Tom Petty, Phil Collins, Michael Jackson, Steve Van Zandt, Elvis Costello, The Jam, Teddy Pendergrass, Billy Joel, and Steve Winwood. The Blues Brothers, who helped create a resurgence of popularity for soul, R&amp;B, and blues in the 1980s, were influenced by Sam &amp; Dave – their biggest hit was a cover of &quot;Soul Man&quot;, and their act and stage show contained many homages to the duo.

According to the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, Sam &amp; Dave were the most successful soul duo and brought the sounds of the black gospel church to pop music with their call-and-response records. Recorded primarily at Stax Records in Memphis, Tennessee, from 1965 through 1968, these included &quot;Soul Man&quot;, &quot;Hold On, I&#x27;m Comin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Like I Know&quot;, &quot;I Thank You&quot;, &quot;When Something Is Wrong with My Baby&quot;, &quot;Wrap It Up&quot;, and many other Southern Soul classics. Except for Aretha Franklin, no soul act during Sam &amp; Dave&#x27;s Stax years (1965–1968) had more consistent R&amp;B chart success, including 10 consecutive top-20 singles and three consecutive top-10 LPs. Their crossover charts appeal (13 straight appearances and two top-10 singles) helped to pave the way for the acceptance of soul music by white pop audiences, and their song &quot;Soul Man&quot; was one of the first songs by a black group to top the pop charts using the word &quot;soul&quot;, helping define the genre. &quot;Soul Man&quot; was a number-one Pop Hit (&quot;Cashbox&quot;: November 11, 1967) and has been recognized as one of the most influential songs of the past 50 years by the Grammy Hall of Fame, the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, and RIAA Songs of the Century. &quot;Soul Man&quot; was featured as the soundtrack and title for a 1986 film and also a 1997–1998 television series, and &quot;Soul Men&quot; was a 2008 feature film.

Sam &amp; Dave are inductees in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, the Memphis Music Hall of Fame, and the Rhythm &amp; Blues Music Hall of Fame. They won a Grammy Award for &quot;Soul Man&quot; and they received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2019. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Sam &amp; Dave No. 14 on its list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time.

==Early years==

Sam Moore and Dave Prater&#x27;s early musical backgrounds involved listening to and singing gospel music in their homes and churches, and in Dave&#x27;s case, also singing gospel in the choir in his church. Dave later sang with his older brother JT Prater in the gospel group The Sensational Hummingbirds, who recorded &quot;Lord Teach Me&quot; in the 1950s. Sam recorded &quot;Nitey-Nite&quot;/&quot;Caveman Rock&quot; in 1954 with the doo-wop group The Majestics, and later sang with the gospel groups The Gales and The Mellonaires. Moore and Prater listed Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke as influences on their styles, and Moore was also influenced by Little Willie John, whom he and Dave opened for often in the early 1960s.

Sam &amp; Dave met working the gospel music circuit, and later in small clubs in Miami during amateur nights in 1961 according to Dave. They sang together one night at the King of Hearts club, and started working together immediately thereafter, developing a live act featuring gospel-inspired call-and-response. Soul singer and record producer Steve Alaimo discovered them while performing during the same show with them at the King of Hearts nightclub in Miami and signed them to Marlin Records.

After two singles in early 1962 were released on the local Marlin label owned by Miami&#x27;s Henry Stone, Stone helped sign them to Roulette Records in New York City. They released six 45s from 1962 to 1964 (two were re-releases of Marlin recordings) with Roulette, and one single on Stone and Alaimo&#x27;s Alston Label. A few of the singles received regional airplay, but did not achieve national chart success. The songs, some of which were produced by Steve Alaimo and some of which were produced by Henry Glover, were similar in many ways to R&amp;B recordings by Sam Cooke, Jackie Wilson and Little Willie John. Prater was the lead vocalist on most of these singles, with Moore singing harmony and alternate verses.

In summer 1964, Stone introduced the duo to Atlantic Records&#x27; Jerry Wexler, who signed them to Atlantic. Wexler asked Memphis, Tennessee-based Stax Records, which Atlantic distributed nationally, to work with Sam &amp; Dave. Wexler wanted the Southern roots and gospel style of their live performances, so the pair were loaned to Stax to record, although they remained Atlantic Records artists. According to Wexler&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Rhythms &amp; Blues&quot;, &quot;Their live act was filled with animation, harmony and seeming goodwill. I put Sam in the sweet tradition of Sam Cooke or Solomon Burke, while Dave had an ominous Four Tops&#x27; Levi Stubbs-sounding voice, the preacher promising hellfire.&quot;

==Stax years (1965–1968)==

===Arrival at Stax and early Stax singles===

When Sam &amp; Dave arrived at Stax, they worked with producer &amp; engineer Jim Stewart and songwriters including the MGs&#x27; guitarist Steve Cropper, who wrote or co-wrote four of their first eight recordings. The duo then moved to relative newcomer writers and producers Isaac Hayes and David Porter. Hayes and Porter wrote and produced the duo&#x27;s biggest hits (although they did not receive production credits until the &quot;Soul Men&quot; LP and singles). According to Moore and Prater, they also greatly influenced the duo&#x27;s singing style, and shifted their recording style from the style of their Roulette records to a more live, more energetic gospel, call-and-response feel and beat driven soul style the group is known for today.

Sam &amp; Dave&#x27;s Stax records also benefited from the musicians and engineering at Stax. The Stax house band, Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s, and the Stax horn section, The Mar-Keys, were world-class musicians who co-wrote (often without credit) and contributed to recordings—the same musicians who recorded with Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, Carla Thomas and other soul artists. Sam &amp; Dave&#x27;s Stax recordings through 1967 were engineered by Stax founder Jim Stewart, who created the Memphis Sound by recording live in a single take. Stewart is credited for instrumental mixes that allowed for instrumental separation and the distinct contribution of each instrument to the overall feel of the song.

While the first two Stax singles failed to chart, the third, the Hayes/Porter composition (with similarities, including the title, to a gospel standard) &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Like I Know&quot; hit No. 7 R&amp;B in 1966. This was the first of 10 consecutive top-20 R&amp;B chart hits over three years, and 14 R&amp;B chart appearances during their career.

===&quot;Hold On, I&#x27;m Comin single and &quot;Hold On, I&#x27;m Comin&quot;&#x27; LP===
&quot;Hold On, I&#x27;m Comin&#x27; (R&amp;B#1/Pop#21), released in March 1966, was an enormous R&amp;B hit for Sam &amp; Dave, and also their first single to break into the top-40 pop charts. The song was named the No. 1 song of the year for 1966 by the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B charts, and spent 20 weeks on the R&amp;B charts in 1966, peaking at No. 1 in June. In 1988, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named it one of the best 100 songs of the past 25 years. &quot;Hold On, I&#x27;m Comin received a belated RIAA gold record for one million sales in 1995, 29 years after its release. &quot;Hold On, I&#x27;m Comin has since been recorded by dozens of other artists.

&quot;Hold On, I&#x27;m Comin was also the first recording on which Moore took lead on the first verse and Prater was given the response role and second verse at Hayes and Porter&#x27;s suggestion. The duo used this format (singing dual leads) on most of their songs. The song was created when Hayes called to Porter, who was in the bathroom. Porter supposedly said &quot;Hold on, man. I&#x27;m comin&#x27;,&quot; and Hayes and Porter wrote the song within 10 minutes. &quot;Hold On, I&#x27;m Comin&#x27;, when released, received objections from radio stations over the suggestive title. This resulted in a name change by Stewart and quick re-recording and re-release, and nearly all the original U.S. copies of the single bear the title &quot;Hold On, I&#x27;m A-Comin&#x27;&quot;.

The LP &quot;Hold On, I&#x27;m Comin&#x27;&quot; (4/66) reached No. 1 for 19 weeks on the R&amp;B album charts in 1966. After Sam &amp; Dave&#x27;s chart success, Roulette quickly released the album &quot;Sam &amp; Dave&quot; in 1966 as well, a collection of the A &amp; B sides of their six Roulette 45s, which did not chart.

===&quot;When Something is Wrong, Double Dynamite&quot; LP and singles===
Sam &amp; Dave&#x27;s next huge R&amp;B hit was &quot;When Something is Wrong With My Baby&quot;, their only ballad single, which was released in January 1967. Stax author Rob Bowman called this &quot;One of the most sublime records in soul music&#x27;s history,&quot; and The Mar-Keys trumpet player Wayne Jackson called it the greatest song he has ever heard. This was the only Sam &amp; Dave hit where Dave sang the first verse solo; their other hits started with Sam &amp; Dave together or Sam singing the first verse. &quot;When Something is Wrong With My Baby&quot; has since become an often recorded and performed duet for male and female singers performing together.

The duo also charted in late 1966 with the top 10 R&amp;B hits &quot;Said I Wasn&#x27;t Gonna Tell Nobody&quot;, and &quot;You Got Me Hummin&quot;. These three singles, along with other tracks, were compiled on &quot;Double Dynamite&quot; (12/66), Sam &amp; Dave&#x27;s second LP on Stax. The LP peaked at No. 7 R&amp;B and No. 118 Pop.

===&quot;Soul Man&quot; single and &quot;Soul Men&quot; LP===
Sam &amp; Dave&#x27;s biggest hit and best-remembered song, &quot;Soul Man&quot; (R&amp;B No. 1/Pop No. 2), was released in August 1967. It was the number No. 1 song in the US according to &quot;Cashbox&quot; magazine Pop charts in November 1967. Sam &amp; Dave won the Grammy Award in 1967 for &quot;Best Performance – Rhythm &amp; Blues Group&quot; for &quot;Soul Man&quot;, their first gold record. &quot;Soul Man&quot; was voted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999. The song helped name the emerging music genre as &quot;Soul Music&quot;. According to co-writer Isaac Hayes, the title was inspired by news reports of soul pride that emerged after the 1967 race riots, where stories that painting the word &quot;soul&quot; on your door was a message for looters to bypass your house. Hayes-Porter extrapolated that to &quot;I&#x27;m a soul brother, I&#x27;m a soul man.&quot;. It has been recognized as one of the best or most influential songs of 50 years by the Grammy Hall of Fame, The Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and R.I.A.A. Songs of the Century. &quot;Soul Man&quot; was used as the soundtrack and title for a 1986 film, a 2008 film &quot;Soul Men&quot;, a 1997–1998 television series. In 2019, &quot;Soul Man&quot; was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

The &quot;Soul Men&quot; LP (October 1967) was Sam &amp; Dave&#x27;s third Stax LP (R&amp;B No. 5/Pop No. 68). Musicologist Rob Bowman called &quot;Soul Men&quot; &quot;One of the greatest soul music albums of all time.&quot; &quot;Don&#x27;t Knock It&quot; from the LP was released as a single in France, but other songs were not released as U.S. singles due to the long run by &quot;Soul Man&quot; on the Pop charts (15 weeks), by which time &quot;I Thank You/Wrap It Up&quot; was ready for release. &quot;May I Baby&quot;, the B-side of &quot;Soul Man&quot;, is also regarded as a classic song on the LP by Whitburn&#x27;s &quot;Top Pop Singles&quot; guide, and was a popular live song performed frequently by Sam &amp; Dave.

===&quot;I Thank You&quot; single and &quot;I Thank You&quot; LP===
In 1968, Sam &amp; Dave again charted with the gospel-inspired &quot;I Thank You/Wrap It Up&quot; (R&amp;B No. 4/Pop No. 9). Critics commented that the B-side &quot;Wrap It Up&quot; could have been a separate successful single, which it later became for The Fabulous Thunderbirds. Because the duo were so busy touring, Hayes &amp; Porter traveled to Europe to record the vocal track on &quot;Wrap It Up&quot; in order to release the single. Due to the end of the distribution agreement between Stax and Atlantic Records in May 1968, &quot;I Thank You&quot; was Sam &amp; Dave&#x27;s final single on Stax. Although they continued to work at Stax with Hayes/Porter, as of May 1968, the duo&#x27;s work was released on Atlantic Records. &quot;I Thank You&quot; sold over one million copies, earning it gold record status.

Sam &amp; Dave&#x27;s first 1968 single for Atlantic was &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know What You Mean to Me&quot;, written by Eddie Floyd and Steve Cropper (R&amp;B #19/Pop #48). Sam &amp; Dave said it was their favorite of their songs. Sam &amp; Dave also released &quot;Can&#x27;t You Find Another Way (of Doing It)&quot; (#20 R&amp;B/#54 Pop), but it was not included in the &quot;I Thank You&quot; LP. Their final single of 1968, &quot;Everybody Got to Believe in Somebody&quot;, charted in the lower levels of the pop charts and ended Sam &amp; Dave&#x27;s streak at 10 straight R&amp;B top 20 singles.

Though on Atlantic, the &quot;I Thank You&quot; LP (10/68) included 1968 singles initially on both Stax and Atlantic. The LP peaked at No. 38 on the R&amp;B charts, and was the only LP of their Stax recordings not to chart on the Pop LP charts.

===Sam &amp; Dave&#x27;s live performances===

In March 1967, Sam &amp; Dave were co-headliners for the Stax/Volt Revue in Europe, which included Booker T &amp; the MGs, The Mar-Keys, Eddie Floyd, Carla Thomas, Arthur Conley and headliner Otis Redding. It was the duo&#x27;s first trip to Europe. Although Redding headlined the tour, many agreed Sam &amp; Dave stole the show on many nights. A live version of &quot;Soothe Me&quot; from Sam &amp; Dave&#x27;s &quot;Double Dynamite&quot; LP was recorded in Paris during the 1967 tour. Released as a single in mid-1967, it continued Sam &amp; Dave&#x27;s string of top 20 U.S. R&amp;B hits and was their first in the UK Top 40.

After the tour, Sam &amp; Dave worked as headliners in the U.S. and in Europe during Fall 1967, Fall 1968 and January 1970, and in Japan in 1969 and 1970. They averaged 280 shows per year from 1967 through 1969 and in 1967, they only took ten days off. Other high points included headlining the Montreal World&#x27;s Fair in 1967, performing at the tribute to Martin Luther King, Jr. at Madison Square Garden in June 1968, being the first black soul act to headline the Fillmore East in December 1968, and headlining the Texas International Pop Festival for two nights in August 1969. Sam &amp; Dave also performed on U.S. and European television, including two appearances on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in 1969, appearing on The Tonight Show and American Bandstand in 1967, and performing on &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot; in 1969 and 1970.

The year 1969 started well, with the Atlantic release of &quot;The Best of Sam &amp; Dave&quot; LP in January. It contained all of their Stax A sides except &quot;A Place Nobody Can Find&quot; and several B-sides, and peaked at No. 24 on the R&amp;B LP charts and No. 89 on the Billboard LP charts. Their first single of the year, &quot;Soul Sister, Brown Sugar&quot;, returned Sam &amp; Dave to the R&amp;B top 20, and was a No. 15 hit in the UK. The follow-up &quot;Born Again&quot;, reached the lower levels of the charts, and was the last single Sam &amp; Dave recorded at Stax.

===Atlantic produced records, first break-up, and reunion (1969–1972)===
Jerry Wexler with co-producer Tom Dowd tried producing Sam &amp; Dave in New York, with Atlantic songwriters and musicians. It took eight months to issue &quot;Ooh, Ooh, Ooh&quot;, the first Atlantic single in August 1969. It was not a very good record, by Sam&#x27;s own admission, and it represented the first time in four years that a Sam &amp; Dave single failed to chart.

Two more singles followed in 1970, &quot;Baby, Baby, Don&#x27;t Stop Now&quot;, and &quot;One Part Love, Two Parts Pain&quot;. The first was a leftover Hayes-Porter recording from Stax; the second was produced by Wexler and Dowd in New York, and was written by Stax executive Al Bell and Allen Jones. Both failed to chart. According to Wexler, &quot;We just made some shit-ass records with them. I never really got into their sensibilities as a producer.&quot; Wexler then sent the duo south to Muscle Shoals and Miami to work with producers Brad Shapiro and Dave Crawford for their next single &quot;Knock It Out The Park&quot;, which also failed to chart.

Sam &amp; Dave split in June 1970, according to Moore, as a result of his dissatisfaction with the duo and his desire to pursue a career solo. According to Prater, they broke up because &quot;[Moore] decided to do what he wanted to do on his own.&quot; Moore performed with his own revue in 1970. He recorded three solo singles (none of which charted) for Atlantic over the next year and was preparing an album produced by King Curtis, which was shelved after Curtis was stabbed to death in 1971. Prater recorded a single for Alston. Neither was commercially successful as a solo act, and they reunited in August 1971.

In October 1971, their last Atlantic single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Pull Your Love&quot;, was a cover of a hit by Hamilton, Joe Frank &amp; Reynolds. This Shapiro/Crawford production was a minor hit (R&amp;B No. 36/Pop No. 102), but not a substantial enough commercial success to keep the duo signed to the label. Sam &amp; Dave recorded four final songs for Atlantic in August, 1972, none of which was released by the label. Their contract with Atlantic expired shortly thereafter.

==Later years (1972–1981)==
Despite inability to attract a major label after Atlantic, there was still demand for public performances, especially in Europe. They toured Turkey in Spring, 1972 and England in Spring, 1973. Sam &amp; Dave also continued to be visible in the U.S., performing on TV shows including &quot;The Midnight Special&quot; and &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;. According to Sam, most U.S. shows in the 1970s were small clubs, oldies shows, and whatever they could get. He attributed their poor bookings during this period to rumors of drug use and bad blood between the duo.

Sam &amp; Dave returned to the studio in 1974 and 1975, recording an album of new songs titled &quot;Back at Cha&quot; for United Artists. The album – their first album of new material in 7 years – was produced by Steve Cropper, and featured the MGs and The Memphis Horns and had a minor R&amp;B single, &quot;A Little Bit of Good&quot; (R&amp;B No. 89). Songwriters included Cropper, Allen Toussaint, and Jimmy Cliff. Although the LP received positive reviews, it failed to chart. In a side project, they provided vocals on &quot;Come On, Come Over&quot; for Jaco Pastorius for his debut album on Epic in 1976.

In 1976–77, Sam &amp; Dave recorded songs in the UK with producer John Abbey. Two singles were released on Abbey&#x27;s Contempo label in the UK and Germany, with limited success. Ironically, given the duo&#x27;s disputes, one of the last singles by Sam &amp; Dave was a cover of The Beatles &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot;. Sam &amp; Dave also briefly retired in 1977, with Dave working at a Pontiac dealership in New Jersey and Sam working at an Austin, Texas, law firm as a process server.

In 1978, Sam &amp; Dave re-recorded old hits for the LP &quot;Sweet &amp; Funky Gold&quot; (Gusto), and re-recorded songs and other soul hits during this period in Nashville for an album for K-Tel Records, &quot;The Original Soul Man&quot;. In Summer, 1978, they toured Germany for two weeks.

In 1979, Sam &amp; Dave enjoyed a significant resurgence of interest as a result of Dan Aykroyd&#x27;s and John Belushi&#x27;s sketch characters The Blues Brothers&quot;, &quot;and the comic actors&#x27; 1979 top-40 cover of &quot;Soul Man&quot;. Moore stated they were offered an opportunity to perform onstage with Belushi and Aykroyd on &quot;SNL&quot; but turned it down when Belushi said Sam &amp; Dave had to perform the intro, then the Blues Brothers would take over. According to an April 1988 interview with Aykroyd in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times,&quot; Aykroyd saw Sam &amp; Dave as a teenager at the Montreal Expo in 1967 and said they were one of his biggest influences for creating The Blues Brothers. Aykroyd convinced director John Landis to include the Jake and Elwood Blues characters listening to &quot;Hold On, I&#x27;m Comin and &quot;Soothe Me&quot; while riding in the Bluesmobile in the 1980 film &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; as a tribute to Sam &amp; Dave.

Also in 1979, Sam &amp; Dave opened shows for The Clash on their U.S. tour, including at the Palladium in New York City. In 1980, the duo performed in Paul Simon&#x27;s film &quot;One Trick Pony&quot; and, finally, on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. In 1980, they also were featured in a U.S. tour opening for the 1950s revival band Sha Na Na.

In 1981, they re-recorded many hits along with Sam Cooke and Otis Redding covers for LPs titled &quot;Soul Study Vol. 1&quot; and &quot;Soul Study Vol. 2&quot; (Odyssey). The pair last performed on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 1981, at the Old Waldorf in San Francisco. According to Moore, when they walked off stage it was the last time they spoke to each other.

==Dave Prater and Sam Daniels (1982–1988)==
In 1982, Prater started touring under the &quot;Sam &amp; Dave&quot; name or as &quot;The New Sam &amp; Dave Revue&quot; with Sam Daniels, who performed with Dave from October 1982 until Dave&#x27;s death in 1988. Moore attempted to block Prater from using the group&#x27;s name, but was largely unsuccessful. The Daniels &amp; Prater incarnation played 100 shows per year over the next seven years, including in Europe, Japan and Canada.

In 1983, Sam &amp; Dave called on J.C. &quot;Billy&quot; Davis to put together a band to back them at a concert at Pine Knob, in Clarkston, Michigan where they were opening for James Brown.

In 1985, Prater and Sam Daniels released a newly sung medley of Sam &amp; Dave hits recorded in The Netherlands, which peaked at No. 92 on the R&amp;B chart and was credited to &quot;Sam &amp; Dave&quot;. Sam Moore got the record company to recall the single for using the &quot;Sam &amp; Dave&quot; name without permission, and the record was re-labelled and re-issued by &quot;The New Sam &amp; Dave Revue&quot;.

Prater last performed with Sam Daniels on April 3, 1988, at a Stax Reunion at the Atlanta Civic Center, which also featured Isaac Hayes, Eddie Floyd, and Rufus and Carla Thomas. Six days later, on April 9, 1988, Prater died in a car crash in Sycamore, Georgia while driving to his mother&#x27;s house.

==Sam Moore solo career (1982–2025)==

Moore continued to perform and record as a solo artist, and also performed in numerous duets with other popular artists, until his death on January 10, 2025.

==Conflict between Moore and Prater==
Sam &amp; Dave were known for having a very tumultuous partnership during most of their 21 years together. According to Moore, they did not speak to each other offstage for almost 13 years. During the 1970s, they broke up many times, and typically would show up separately for shows, require separate dressing rooms, not look at each other onstage, and communicate through intermediaries. They also had performances in the 1970s where only one of them would show up, leading to the eventual departure of Moore, and the continuation of the name &quot;Sam &amp; Dave&quot; by Prater pairing with vocalist Sam Daniels. Moore describes personal issues with Prater, including drug use, touring fatigue, and a desire to do his own act with new material as contributing to their break-up and replacement of Dave. Prater attributed their rift and break-ups to Moore&#x27;s frustrations in wanting to do his own act and diversify from repeatedly performing the Sam &amp; Dave song catalog (which Prater has said that Moore did not like very much).

==Covers by other artists/use in pop culture==
Sam &amp; Dave songs have been recorded by other artists, including 29 covers of &quot;Hold On, I&#x27;m Comin&#x27;&quot;. Others who charted with Sam &amp; Dave songs include ZZ Top – &quot;I Thank You&quot;, The Fabulous Thunderbirds – &quot;Wrap It Up&quot;, James &amp; Bobby Purify – &quot;I Take What I Want&quot;, Linda Ronstadt (featuring Aaron Neville) – &quot;When Something Is Wrong with My Baby&quot;, Chuck Jackson &amp; Maxine Brown – &quot;Hold On, I&#x27;m Comin&#x27;&quot;, Elvis Costello – &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand Up for Falling Down&quot;, and Lydia Pense &amp; Cold Blood – &quot;I Take What I Want&quot;. A diverse group of other successful artists also recorded Sam &amp; Dave covers, including: Aretha Franklin, Peter Frampton, The Temptations, Bonnie Raitt, Jackie Wilson, Eurythmics, Rory Gallagher, Tom Jones, The Band, Martha Reeves &amp; the Vandellas, Michael Bolton, Patti LaBelle &amp; Travis Tritt, Bryan Ferry, Marilyn McCoo &amp; Billy Davis Jr., The Hollies, Paul Butterfield, Taj Mahal, Guy Sebastian, and Eric Clapton &amp; B.B. King.

In 2003, the Stax Museum of American Soul Music opened in Memphis, and Sam &amp; Dave are in the film made for the museum, titled &quot;Soulsville&quot;, and they have a permanent wall-and-video display.

Barack Obama used &quot;Hold On, I&#x27;m Comin as a theme song on the campaign trail until Sam Moore requested that he stop using it. Eleven months later, Sam Moore performed &quot;Soul Man&quot; with Sting and Elvis Costello at one of Obama&#x27;s inaugural parties. A parody of &quot;Soul Man&quot; created by Moore, &quot;I&#x27;m a Dole Man&quot;, was used in the 1996 Bob Dole presidential campaign until the copyright owners objected and requested the campaign stop using it. Sam &amp; Dave released the rare single &quot;Hold On, Edwin&#x27;s Coming&quot; in 1982 to support Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards&#x27; third run for governor. Another parody, &quot;I&#x27;m a Suns Fan&quot;, was recorded by Moore and used for the Phoenix Suns basketball games.

Sam &amp; Dave songs have been used frequently in movie and TV soundtracks and commercials, including &quot;Hold On, I&#x27;m Comin on the soundtrack of the 2007 hit film &quot;American Gangster&quot;. &quot;Hold On, I&#x27;m Comin and &quot;Soothe Me&quot; played on the radio and 8 track player (album titled: &quot;The Best of Sam &amp; Dave&quot;) in the Bluesmobile during the 1980 hit movie &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;. &quot;A Place Nobody Can Find&quot; was used in the background of a scene in HBO&#x27;s series &quot;The Wire&quot;. Jay Leno used &quot;Hold On, I&#x27;m Comin&quot; while driving his AC Cobra on his 2009 Super Bowl commercial to announce his show&#x27;s move to a new time. &quot;Wrap It Up&quot; was used as a transition to commercial break for &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;. &quot;Soul Man&quot; was used as the title and title track in the 1986 movie featuring C. Thomas Howell, and also the 1997–1998 television series featuring Dan Aykroyd. The movie &quot;Tapeheads&quot;, released in 1988 and starring John Cusack and Tim Robbins, featured Sam Moore and Junior Walker as a fictitious, legendary soul duo called The Swanky Modes.

The movie &quot;Soul Men&quot;, released in November 2008, was a comedy featuring Bernie Mac and Samuel L. Jackson as two feuding soul singers called &quot;The Real Deal&quot;. In February 2009, Moore filed suit against the film production company (The Weinstein Company) and the producers for infringing on the marks &quot;Soul Man&quot; and &quot;Soul Men&quot;, claiming the movie is based on the careers of Sam &amp; Dave, and damaged both Moore&#x27;s reputation and career. The suit was dismissed on summary judgment in May 2012.

<doc id="165857" wikidata="Q455818" url="?curid=165857" title="Duane Eddy">
<text>Duane Eddy (April 26, 1938 – April 30, 2024) was an American rock and roll guitarist. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, he had a string of hit records produced by Lee Hazlewood which were noted for their characteristically &quot;twangy&quot; guitar sound, including &quot;Rebel-&#x27;Rouser&quot;, &quot;Peter Gunn&quot;, and &quot;Because They&#x27;re Young&quot;. He had sold 12 million records by 1963. His guitar style influenced the Ventures, the Shadows, the Beatles (especially their lead guitarist George Harrison), Bruce Springsteen, Steve Earle, and Marty Stuart.

Eddy was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2008.

==Early life==
Eddy was born in Corning, New York, on April 26, 1938. His parents were Lloyd and Alberta (née Granger) Eddy. Eddy&#x27;s father drove a bread truck and later became the manager of a grocery store. He began playing the guitar at the age of five after hearing the cowboy singer Gene Autry. In 1950, at the age of 12, Eddy made his first on-air radio appearance when he performed &quot;The Missouri Waltz&quot; on a Hornell, N.Y. station. 

In 1951, his family moved to Tucson, and then to Coolidge, Arizona. He formed a duo, Jimmy and Duane, with his friend Jimmy Delbridge, who later recorded as Jimmy Dell. Eddy left school at sixteen and played in local bars.

==Career==
===1950s-60s: Career rise and peak===
In 1957, Eddy had a weekly showcase on radio station KCKY and then a slot on a weekly hit parade television show in Phoenix, where he met Arizona-based disc jockey, songwriter and music publisher Lee Hazlewood. Hazlewood produced the duo&#x27;s single, &quot;Soda Fountain Girl&quot;, recorded and released in 1955 in Phoenix, Arizona. They performed and appeared on radio stations in Phoenix and joined Buddy Long&#x27;s Western Melody Boys, playing country music in and around the city.

Eddy was not happy with his singing voice, and he devised a technique of playing lead lines on his guitar&#x27;s bass strings to produce a low, reverberant &quot;twangy&quot; sound instead. At the age of 19, he had acquired a 1957 Chet Atkins model Gretsch 6120 guitar from Ziggie&#x27;s Music in Phoenix, and in November 1957, he recorded an instrumental piece, &quot;Movin&#x27; n&#x27; Groovin&#x27;&quot;, which he co-wrote with Hazlewood. His backing band included saxophonist Steve Douglas, pianist Larry Knechtel, and bassist Al Casey. As the Phoenix studio had no echo chamber, Hazlewood bought a 2,000-gallon (7570-litre) water storage tank to use as an echo chamber to accentuate the &quot;twangy&quot; guitar sound. In 1958, Eddy signed a recording contract with Lester Sill and Hazlewood to record in Phoenix at the Audio Recorders studio. Sill and Hazlewood leased the tapes of all their singles and albums to the Philadelphia-based Jamie Records.

&quot;Movin&#x27; n&#x27; Groovin&#x27;&quot; reached number 72 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in early 1958. The opening riff, borrowed from Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Brown Eyed Handsome Man&quot;, was in turn copied a few years later by the Beach Boys on &quot;Surfin&#x27; U.S.A.&quot; The follow-up, &quot;Rebel-Rouser&quot;, featured a saxophone overdubbed by Los Angeles session musician Gil Bernal, and yells and handclaps by doo-wop group the Rivingtons. This became Eddy&#x27;s breakthrough hit, reaching number 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. It sold over one million copies, earning him his first gold disc.

Eddy had a succession of hit records over the next few years. His band members, including saxophonists Steve Douglas and Jim Horn, and keyboard player Larry Knechtel, were later members of Phil Spector&#x27;s Wrecking Crew. According to writer Richie Unterberger, &quot;The singles, of which &#x27;Peter Gunn&#x27;, &#x27;Cannonball&#x27;, &#x27;Shazam&#x27;, and &#x27;Forty Miles of Bad Road&#x27; were probably the best, also did their part to help keep the raunchy spirit of rock and roll alive during a time in which it was in danger of being watered down.&quot; 

On January 9, 1958, Eddy&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Have &#x27;Twangy&#x27; Guitar Will Travel&quot;, was released. It reached number five on the album chart and remained there for 82 weeks. Duane Eddy and the Rebels appeared six times on &quot;The Dick Clark Show&quot; between 1958 and 1960. On Eddy&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Songs of Our Heritage&quot; (1960), each track featured him playing acoustic guitar or banjo. His biggest hit came with the theme of the movie &quot;Because They&#x27;re Young&quot; in 1960, which featured a string arrangement. It reached a chart peak of number four in America and number two in the UK in September 1960, and became his second million-selling disc. Eddy&#x27;s records were consistently more successful in the UK than they were in his native United States, and in 1960, readers of the UK&#x27;s &quot;NME&quot; voted him World&#x27;s Number One Musical Personality, ousting Elvis Presley.

In 1960, Eddy signed a contract directly with Jamie Records, bypassing Sill and Hazlewood, which caused a temporary rift between Eddy and Hazlewood. The result was that for the duration of his contract with Jamie, Eddy produced his own singles and albums.

In the 1960s, Eddy launched an acting career, appearing in such films as &quot;Because They&#x27;re Young&quot;, &quot;A Thunder of Drums&quot;, &quot;The Wild Westerners&quot;, &quot;Kona Coast&quot;, and &quot;The Savage Seven.&quot; In 1961, he signed a three-year contract with Paul Anka&#x27;s production company, Camy, whose recordings were issued by RCA Victor. In the early days of recording in the RCA Victor studios, he renewed contact with Lee Hazlewood, who became involved in a number of his RCA Victor singles and albums. Eddy&#x27;s 1962 single release, &quot;(Dance With The) Guitar Man&quot;, co-written with Hazlewood, sold a million copies and earned his third gold disc. Also in 1962, Eddy recorded &quot;The Ballad of Paladin&quot;, the instrumental theme song to the western television series &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot;, in which Eddy also acted in two episodes. Eddy had sold 12 million records by 1963. In 1965, he released an album of instrumental versions of Bob Dylan songs.

===1970s-80s: Solo decline, focus on production, and comeback===
In the 1970s, Eddy produced songs for Phil Everly and Waylon Jennings. In 1972, he worked as lead guitarist, alongside rhythm guitarist Al Gorgoni, on BJ Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Rock and Roll Lullaby&quot;. In 1975 a collaboration with hit songwriter Tony Macaulay and former founding member of The Seekers, Keith Potger, led to another UK top 10 record, &quot;Play Me Like You Play Your Guitar&quot;, featuring a female vocal group. Eddy performed on the BBC television show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; while promoting the single. A recording of &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot;, featuring Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, and Eddy&#x27;s third wife Deed, appeared in the country charts in 1977.

In 1982, Eddy&#x27;s &quot;Rebel Walk&quot; was heard in the musical comedy &quot;Grease 2&quot; as background music at the bowling alley. It was not part of the original soundtrack, but was mentioned in the film&#x27;s credits.

In 1986, Eddy collaborated with Art of Noise on a new recording of his 1960 version of Henry Mancini&#x27;s &quot;Peter Gunn&quot;. It was a top 10 hit around the world, ranking number one on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s dance chart for six weeks that summer. &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; won the Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental of 1986. It also gave Eddy the distinction of being the only instrumentalist to have had top 10 hit singles in four different decades in the UK.

The following year, the album &quot;Duane Eddy&quot; was released on Capitol. Several of the tracks were produced by Paul McCartney, Jeff Lynne, Ry Cooder and Art of Noise. Guest musicians included John Fogerty, George Harrison, Paul McCartney, Ry Cooder, James Burton, David Lindley, Phil Pickett, Steve Cropper, and original Rebels Larry Knechtel and Jim Horn. The album included a cover of Paul McCartney&#x27;s 1979 instrumental, &quot;Rockestra Theme&quot;.

===1990s-2024: Later career===
In 1992, Eddy recorded a duet with Hank Marvin for Marvin&#x27;s album &quot;Into the Light,&quot; a cover version of The Chantays&#x27; 1963 hit &quot;Pipeline&quot;. 
Eddy&#x27;s &quot;Rebel Rouser&quot; was featured in 1994 in the film &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;. Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; used &quot;The Trembler&quot;, a track written by Eddy and Ravi Shankar. Also in 1994, Eddy teamed up with Carl Perkins and The Mavericks to contribute &quot;Matchbox&quot; to the AIDS benefit album &quot;Red Hot + Country,&quot; produced by the Red Hot Organization. Eddy was the lead guitarist on Foreigner&#x27;s 1995 hit &quot;Until the End of Time&quot;, which reached the top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart. In 1996, Eddy played guitar on Hans Zimmer&#x27;s soundtrack for the film &quot;Broken Arrow&quot;.

In October 2010, Eddy returned to the UK for a sold-out Royal Festival Hall concert in London. This success prompted an album, &quot;Road Trip&quot;, for Mad Monkey/EMI, produced by Richard Hawley in Sheffield, England. The album was released on June 20, 2011, and &quot;Mojo&quot; placed it at number 37 on its list of &quot;Top 50 albums of 2011.&quot; Eddy performed at the Glastonbury Festival on June 26, 2011.

In 2015, Eddy participated in overdubbing sessions for the Elvis Presley and Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO) remix album &quot;If I Can Dream&quot;, adding guitar to &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; and &quot;An American Trilogy&quot;. Eddy later expressed disappointment that some of his guitar playing was cut from the two songs, which he assumed happened because it may have interfered with the orchestral focus of the album project.

In 2016, Eddy participated in an extensive interview with the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum as part of their &quot;Nashville Cats&quot; series.

For an 80th-birthday tour in 2018, Eddy returned to the UK in concerts with Liverpudlian singer-songwriter Robert Vincent, performing on October 23 at the London Palladium, and October 30 at Bridgewater Hall in Manchester.

In 2020, Eddy participated in overdubbing sessions for the Johnny Cash and RPO remix album (titled &quot;Johnny Cash and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra&quot;), adding guitar to the gospel song &quot;Farther Along&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Music Radar&quot; that year, Eddy was unsure if he would continue recording or touring after conditions related to the coronavirus pandemic improved; however, he stated that he was working on a documentary and considering writing an autobiography.

In 2024, Eddy was one of 66 musicians credited for collaborating with Mark Knopfler on a re-recording of Knopfler&#x27;s “Going Home (Theme From Local Hero)&quot;. Jointly credited as &quot;Mark Knopfler&#x27;s Guitar Heroes&quot;, the single was released as a charity single to benefit two charities, Teenage Cancer Trust and Teen Cancer America. It debuted and peaked at #1 on Billboard&#x27;s Rock Digital Song Sales in March, which was his only #1 on any Billboard chart; in the UK, the collaborative single reached the top 20 on the main singles chart.

==Private life and death==
Eddy&#x27;s first wife was Carol Puckett; they were married and divorced prior to 1961. In 1961, Eddy married singer Miriam Johnson, with whom he recorded a gospel album. They had a daughter, Jennifer. Duane and Miriam divorced in 1968. She adopted the stage name Jessi Colter, became a popular country singer, and later married fellow country star Waylon Jennings.

Eddy later married Deed Abbate, with whom he collaborated on a cover of &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot; in 1977. In addition to his daughter with Miriam Johnson/Jessi Colter, Eddy had three children with third wife Deed Abbate-Eddy.

Eddy died of cancer in Franklin, Tennessee, on April 30, 2024, four days after his 86th birthday. Eddy was survived by his third wife Deed and his children (four, according to an obituary by &quot;Billboard&quot;, or three, according to an obituary by &quot;The Guardian&quot;). &quot;The Guardian&quot; also reported that Eddy was also survived by five grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.

Eddy was the last surviving musician to have charted in the top 10 of the first-ever issue of the &quot;Billboard Hot 100&quot; chart in 1958.

==Honors==

In 1987, Eddy won his first and only Grammy award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance for his re-recording of &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; with Art of Noise. In 1996, he received a second Grammy nomination, this time for Best Country Instrumental Performance, for his contribution as a &quot;featured artist&quot; on Doc Watson&#x27;s &quot;Thunder Road/Sugarfoot Rag&quot;.

In 1994, Eddy was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and he was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2008. In 1997, Eddy was inducted into Guitar Center&#x27;s &quot;Rockwalk&quot;, an honor similar to the Hollywood Walk of Fame bestowed exclusively to legendary rock and pop musicians.

In 2000, at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee, the title &quot;Titan of Twang&quot; was bestowed upon Eddy by mayor Bill Purcell.

In 2004, Eddy was presented with the &quot;Guitar Player Magazine&quot; &quot;Legend Award&quot;. He was the second recipient of the award, the first having been presented to Les Paul.

==Legacy==
Among those who have acknowledged Eddy&#x27;s influence are George Harrison, Dave Davies, Hank Marvin, the Ventures, John Entwistle, Bruce Springsteen, John Fogerty, Adrian Belew, Bill Nelson, Mark Knopfler, Steve Earle, Marty Stuart, and Ben Vaughn. Eddy&#x27;s playing inspired some of the lead guitar playing on Springsteen&#x27;s 1975 hit &quot;Born to Run&quot;.

In the 1990s, Eddy&#x27;s songs appeared in the soundtracks of popular films including &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot;, &quot;Broken Arrow&quot;, &quot;Milk Money&quot;, and &quot;Scream 2&quot;.

==Signature guitars==
Eddy&#x27;s favored guitar was a 1957 Chet Atkins Gretsch 6120 guitar that he bought at Ziggie&#x27;s Music in Phoenix, Arizona in 1957. He traded in an early 1950s gold top Gibson Les Paul Standard guitar for it, plus monthly payments of $17. On 1959&#x27;s &quot;The &quot;Twangs&quot; the &quot;Thang&quot;&quot; LP he also used a Danelectro six-string bass.

Eddy became the first rock and roll guitarist to have a signature guitar when, in 1961, the Guild Guitar Company introduced the Duane Eddy signature models DE-400 and the deluxe DE-500. A limited edition of the DE-500 model was reissued briefly in 1983 to mark Eddy&#x27;s 25th anniversary in the recording industry. In 1997, 40 years after he bought his Gretsch Chet Atkins 6120, Gretsch started production of the Duane Eddy Signature Model, the Gretsch 6120-DE. In 2004, the Gibson Custom Art and Historic Division introduced the new Duane Eddy Signature Gibson guitar. A new Gretsch G6120DE Duane Eddy Signature model was released in spring 2011 and in 2018 Gretsch released the G6120TB-DE Duane Eddy 6-string bass model.

<text>The Shirelles were an American girl group formed in Passaic, New Jersey, in 1957. They consisted of schoolmates Shirley Owens (later Shirley Alston Reeves), Doris Coley (later Doris Kenner-Jackson), Addie &quot;Micki&quot; Harris (later Addie Harris McFadden), and Beverly Lee.

Founded in 1957 for a talent show at their high school, they were signed by Florence Greenberg of Tiara Records. Their first single, &quot;I Met Him on a Sunday&quot;, was released by Tiara and licensed by Decca Records in 1958. After a brief and unsuccessful period with Decca, they went with Greenberg to her newly formed company, Scepter Records. Working with Luther Dixon, the group rose to fame with &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot;. After a successful period of collaboration with Dixon and promotion by Scepter, with seven top 20 hits, the Shirelles left Scepter in 1966. Afterwards, they were unable to maintain their previous popularity.

The Shirelles have been described as having a &quot;naive schoolgirl sound&quot; that contrasted with the sexual themes of many of their songs. Several of their hits used strings and featured the influence of Brazilian baião music. They have been credited with launching the girl group genre, with much of their music reflecting the genre&#x27;s essence. Their acceptance by both white and black audiences, predating that of the Motown acts, has been noted as reflecting the early success of the Civil Rights Movement. They have received numerous honors, including the Pioneer Award from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation, as well as being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and named one of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2004. Two of their songs, &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot;, were selected by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; on its list of the greatest songs of all time. In 2022, their debut album &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Initial career and success==
The group that later became the Shirelles was formed in 1957 by four teenage girls from Passaic, New Jersey, under the name the Poquellos (or Pequellos). The founding members, Shirley Owens (born June 10, 1941, Henderson, NC), Doris Coley (August 2, 1941, Goldsboro, NC– February 4, 2000, Sacramento, CA), Addie &quot;Micki&quot; Harris (January 22, 1941, High Point, NC – June 10, 1982, Atlanta, Georgia), and Beverly Lee (born August 3, 1941, Passaic, NJ), entered a talent show at Passaic High School at the suggestion of a teacher. After hearing them sing &quot;I Met Him on a Sunday&quot;, a song they had written for the show, their classmate Mary Jane Greenberg convinced the reluctant Poquellos to meet with her mother, Florence, the owner of Tiara Records. After several months of avoiding Greenberg and telling her that they were not interested in singing professionally, they were booked to Tiara. By the end of the year they had changed their name to the Shirelles, a combination of the first syllable of Owens&#x27;s given name and -el, reminiscent of then-popular group the Chantels, after briefly using the name the Honeytunes. That year, they released their first song, &quot;I Met Him on a Sunday&quot;; after local success, it was licensed to Decca Records for national broadcast and charted at #50. The song was influenced by doo-wop, but infused with pop melodies.

Tiara Records, along with the Shirelles&#x27; contract, was sold to Decca Records in 1959 for $4,000; Greenberg stayed as the manager, securing performances for the group, including one at the Howard Theatre in Washington D.C. After two singles did poorly, including their first release—with Coley as lead vocalist—of &quot;Dedicated to the One I Love&quot;, a cover of the &quot;5&quot; Royales song of the same name, Decca returned them to Greenberg and gave up on them, considering them a one-hit act. On Greenberg&#x27;s new label, Scepter Records, they rereleased &quot;Dedicated to the One I Love&quot; as a single, which peaked at #89; Wayne Wadhams, David Nathan, and Susan Lindsay in &quot;Inside the Hits&quot; attribute the low rating to poor distribution. In order to better promote the group, Greenberg asked songwriter Luther Dixon, who had previously worked with Perry Como, Nat King Cole, and Pat Boone and co-written the 1959 hit &quot;16 Candles&quot;, to write for and produce songs for them. Dixon accepted.

Their first single produced with Dixon, &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot;, was released in 1960 and peaked at #39. The success of &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; led to the girls being booked to perform with several major artists, such as Etta James and Little Richard, and facilitated Scepter&#x27;s move to a larger office. It was followed by &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow&quot;, written by husband-wife songwriting team Gerry Goffin and Carole King; the song went on to become the first &quot;Billboard&quot; number-one hit by an African-American girl group, possibly the first by any girl group. &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; was later used as the title song for the 1961 album &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot;, which also included &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Dedicated to the One I Love&quot;.

After the success of their singles, the Shirelles became frequent guests of Murray the K, who hosted them on his &quot;All Star Rock Shows&quot; on the New York radio station WINS. During this same period they reissued &quot;Dedicated to the One I Love&quot;, which peaked at #3, followed by &quot;Mama Said&quot;, then &quot;Baby It&#x27;s You&quot;, written by Burt Bacharach, Luther Dixon, and Mack David, &quot;Soldier Boy&quot;, and &quot;Boys&quot;, with saxophonist King Curtis.

In 1963 Dixon left Scepter, which presaged a tailing-off of the number of the Shirelles&#x27; singles to chart. However, they carried on performing and recording. Dionne Warwick replaced Owens and Coley, who took leave to marry their fiancés, in concerts and the group continued to record material. That year, their song &quot;Foolish Little Girl&quot; reached the pop/R&amp;B Top 10, and they performed two songs, &quot;31 Flavors&quot; and &quot;You Satisfy My Soul,&quot; for the soundtrack of the film &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot;; &quot;31 Flavors&quot; was also used to promote Baskin-Robbins. However, later in 1963, the Shirelles learned that the trust, holding their royalties, that they were supposed to receive from Scepter on their 21st birthdays, did not exist. In response, they left the label, and later filed a breach of contract suit against the company. Scepter met this with a countersuit for quitting; both suits were withdrawn in 1965, after an agreement was reached. Knowing that Scepter had lied about the trust disappointed the Shirelles, who felt deceived. In a 1981 interview with Bruce Pollock, Owens said that Greenberg had put on a &quot;mother routine&quot;, which the girls had &quot;fall[en] for ... completely&quot;.

==Later career==

In later years, the Shirelles declined in popularity due in part to pressure from the British Invasion and the heavy competition from other girl groups, including the Chiffons, the Supremes, the Ronettes, Martha &amp; the Vandellas, and the Crystals. During this period, Warwick often replaced Coley on stage due to the latter&#x27;s family commitments. The Shirelles were still bound to Scepter and thus unable to record for another company until the end of their contract in 1966. Their last single to chart was 1967&#x27;s &quot;Last Minute Miracle&quot;, which peaked at #99.

After the commercial failure of their most recent releases, Coley left the group in 1968 to focus on her family. The remaining three Shirelles recorded songs for several labels, including Bell Records, RCA Victor, and United Artists until 1971. Afterwards, they toured singing their older songs, and participated in the filming of the 1973 documentary &quot;Let the Good Times Roll&quot;, recording two songs for it. Coley returned as lead singer in 1975, replacing Owens, who left that year to pursue a solo career. Addie &quot;Micki&quot; Harris collapsed of a heart attack in June 1982 in the lobby of Hyatt Regency in Atlanta, Georgia after two performances with the group. She was sent to the Grady Memorial Hospital, where she died at 12:50 a.m. on June 10, 1982. The following year, the remaining three original members performed &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow&quot; with Warwick on her album &quot;How Many Times Can We Say Goodbye&quot;.

==Current versions of the group==
Today, the original members tour in different, separate groups, although the trademark to the Shirelles name was eventually acquired by Lee. One of the versions of the group had member Geraldine Crowell, who was the daughter of David Jones of The Rays. Shirley Owens performed on the Doo Wop 51 PBS special in 2000. She continued to tour under the name &quot;Shirley Alston Reeves and her Shirelles&quot;. Shirley retired in 2020. Lee currently tours with new members, billed as &quot;The Shirelles&quot;. Doris Coley died in Sacramento, California on February 4, 2000 of breast cancer.

==Deaths==
Addie Harris died from a heart attack at the age of 41 on June 10, 1982.

Doris Coley died of breast cancer at the age of 58 on February 4, 2000.

==Style==
Wadhams, Nathan, and Lindsay describe the style of the Shirelles early work as &quot;tight, almost doo-wop harmony&quot;. Owens&#x27;s vocals, described by rock n&#x27; roll writer Alwyn W. Turner as being &quot;wonderfully expressive&quot;, were capable of sounding &quot;almost, but not quite&quot; out of tune, which in his opinion lent Owens an innocent sound in her songs; music critic Albin Zak describes her vocals as being able to intone desire and vulnerability. The other members, singing backup, also convey what Michael Campbell, a professor of music at Western Illinois University, calls a &quot;naive schoolgirl sound&quot;. The lyrics sung by the Shirelles tended to be fairly simple and &quot;barely&quot; concealed the subtexts of the songs. The songs were implicitly directed at female listeners, with the male subjects of songs being referred to as &quot;he&quot; instead of &quot;you&quot;; this was a change from previous female-written songs, which tended to be more gender neutral, and helped pave the way for the &quot;confessional&quot; songs of 70s singers like Joni Mitchell and Carole King.

Musically, their works with Dixon were influenced by Brazilian baião and featured numerous instances of syncopation.

==Influence==
Steve Huey of AllMusic notes that the Shirelles defined &quot;the so-called girl group sound with their soft, sweet harmonies and yearning innocence&quot;, with their songs predating Motown in their widespread crossing of racial demographics, both in the US and in Britain. He also notes that they spawned &quot;legions of imitators&quot;, and laid a blueprint for future female pop stars to follow. Turner writes that the Shirelles &quot;launched [the girl group] genre&quot;, noting that their early work already included &quot;the essence&quot; of the genre; Alwyn Zak expands on the statement, noting that the influx of female groups started after the success of &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow&quot;.

Michael Campbell notes that the Shirelles&#x27; success reflected the Civil Rights Movement. He indicates that works such as &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow&quot;, written by a white couple, produced by an African-American man, with vocals by young African-American women and strings sounding like they were targeted at a white audience, conveyed a &quot;color-blind&quot; message on top of its more obvious sexual one.

The Beatles were large admirers, according to George Harrison, &quot;We always loved those American girl groups, like the Shirelles and the Ronettes, so yeah we developed our harmonies from trying to come up with an English, male version of their vocal feel.&quot; Their debut album, Please Please Me included cover versions of two songs by the Shirelles, &quot;Baby It&#x27;s You&quot;, and &quot;Boys&quot;, and a third song from the album, &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot; was according to John Lennon, Paul&#x27;s attempt at &quot;trying to write a &quot;Soldier Boy&quot; like the Shirelles.&quot;

==Accolades==
In 1994, the Shirelles were honored by the Rhythm and Blues Foundation with the Pioneer Award for their contributions to music. The award was accepted by Owens, Lee, and Kenner. As Coley was accepting her award, she said &quot;This is dedicated to the one I love&quot;, and sang an impromptu rendition of &quot;Soldier Boy&quot; together with Owens and Lee. Two years later they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, together with Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips. At the ceremony in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York, the three surviving members sang a medley of songs after being presented the awards by Merry Clayton, Marianne Faithfull, and Darlene Love. In 2002, they were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. Lee and Owens accepted the award.

In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked them #76 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Paul Shaffer, who did the write-up, wrote that the girl-group sound, originated by them, was &quot;everything to [him]&quot;; he also described their impromptu performance of &quot;Soldier Boy&quot; as inspiring. They also included two of the Shirelles&#x27; songs, &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot;, on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In the 2010 edition, &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow&quot; was ranked 126th, while &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; was ranked 409th. The Shirelles&#x27; 1963 &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album was included in Robert Christgau&#x27;s &quot;Basic Record Library&quot; of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981). He later characterized it as &quot;merely one of the greatest phonograph albums ever made available to the general public&quot;.

In September 2008, the Shirelles&#x27; hometown of Passaic honored the group by renaming a section of Paulison Avenue between Passaic and Pennington Avenues (the section where Passaic High School is located) &quot;Shirelles Boulevard&quot;. The dedication ceremony was attended by both surviving Shirelles. Owens said that it was different from they were inducted into the Hall of Fame, as it was their home town. She noted that &quot;the people who loves us and we loved are right here.&quot;

In 2022, their debut album &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Stage musical==
The Shirelles&#x27; story was shown in &quot;Baby It&#x27;s You!&quot; (a musical revue written by Floyd Mutrux and Colin Escott), which follows the story of Greenberg and Scepter Records. The revue played on Broadway for 148 performances, opening at the Broadhurst Theatre on April 27, 2011, and closing on September 4 of the same year. The use of their likenesses without permission led to Lee, as well as the estates of Coley and Harris, to sue Warner Bros.

<text>A bedroom farce or sex farce is a type of light comedy focusing on the sexual pairings and recombinations of characters as they move through improbable plots and slamming doors.

==Overview==
Georges Feydeau plays, presented in Paris in the 1890s, are now considered forerunners to the Theatre of the Absurd. The Viennese playwright Arthur Schnitzler took bedroom farce to its highest dramatic level in his &quot;La Ronde&quot;, which in ten bedroom scenes connect the highest and lowest of Vienna.

Some of the English Aldwych farces by Ben Travers which were popular in the 1920s and 1930s have aspects of &quot;bedroom farce&quot;, e.g. &quot;A Cuckoo in the Nest&quot; or &quot;Rookery Nook&quot;. However, in each case the sharing of a bedroom or house turns out to have an innocent explanation.

In modern times, Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Sex Comedy&quot; (1982) presents aspects of the bedroom farce. Michael Frayn&#x27;s 1977 play &quot;Donkeys&#x27; Years&quot; is a classic bedroom farce; Frayn parodied the genre in his 1982 play &quot;Noises Off&quot; via its play-within-the-play, &quot;Nothing On.&quot; Alan Ayckbourn&#x27;s play, entitled &quot;Bedroom Farce&quot;, looks at the lives of three couples seen in their own bedrooms, the stage being split into three sets for this purpose. There is much humour in the play, although few if any of the usual conventions of farce are observed.

&quot;Boeing Boeing&quot; is a classic French farce for the stage by Marc Camoletti. Utilizing most of the conventions of bedroom farce&#x27;s canon, it concerns a Parisian bachelor playboy with three international air stewardess fiancées he secretly keeps in careful rotation, until their flight schedules change and he, along with his provincial friend and sassy maid, must keep them from finding out about each other. Luckily they have enough doors in the apartment to keep the girls unwittingly flitting about for two hours.

American three-camera situation comedy, an extension of proscenium stage tradition, often includes elements of farce, specifically in several episodes of &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;, the &quot;Woody&#x27;s Wedding&quot; episode of &quot;Cheers&quot;, &quot;The Ski Lodge&quot; episode of &quot;Frasier&quot;, and the &quot;Love Car Displacement&quot; episode of &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;.

Brian Rix performed many bedroom farces at the Garrick theatre in London, many of which were broadcast by the BBC.

British dramatist Ray Cooney, whose &quot;Run For Your Wife&quot; was the longest running-comedy in West End theater history, is a modern master of this genre.

<text>Franklin Joseph Lymon (September 30, 1942 – February 27, 1968) was an American rock and roll/rhythm and blues singer and songwriter, best known as the boy soprano lead singer of the New York City-based early rock and roll doo-wop group the Teenagers. The group was composed of five boys, all in their early to mid-teens. The original lineup of the Teenagers, an integrated group, included three African-American members, Lymon, Jimmy Merchant, and Sherman Garnes; and two Puerto Rican members, Joe Negroni and Herman Santiago. The Teenagers&#x27; first single, 1956&#x27;s &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot;, was also their biggest hit. After Lymon went solo in mid-1957, both his career and that of the Teenagers fell into decline. In 1968, Lymon was found dead at the age of 25 on the floor of his grandmother&#x27;s bathroom from a heroin overdose. Lymon was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993 as a member of the Teenagers. His life was dramatized in the 1998 film &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot;.

==Biography==
===1942–56: Early life/joining the Teenagers===

Franklin Joseph Lymon was born in Washington Heights, New York City on September 30, 1942, to Jeanette and Howard Lymon. Howard was a truck driver and Jeanette was a maid. Both also sang in the gospel group the Harlemaires; Frankie and his brothers, Lewis and Howie, sang with the Harlemaire Juniors (a fourth brother, Timmy, was also a singer, though not with the Harlemaire Juniors). The Lymons struggled to make ends meet, so Lymon began working as a grocery boy at age 10.

At age 12 in 1954, Lymon heard a local doo-wop group known as the Coupe De Villes at a school talent show. He became friends with the lead singer Herman Santiago, and eventually became a member of the group, now calling itself both the Ermines and the Premiers. One day in 1955, a neighbor gave the Premiers several love letters that had been written to him by his girlfriend, hoping to give the boys inspiration to write their own songs. Jimmy Merchant and Santiago adapted one of the letters into a song called &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot;. The Premiers, now calling themselves the Teenagers, got their first shot at fame after impressing Richard Barrett, a singer with the Valentines. Barrett, in turn, got the group an audition with record producer George Goldner. On the day of the group&#x27;s audition, original lead singer Santiago was late. Lymon stepped up and told Goldner that he knew the part because he helped write the song. The disc jockeys always called them &quot;Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers&quot;.

===1956: &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot; success===
Goldner signed the group to Gee Records, and &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot; became its first single in January 1956. The single peaked at No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop singles chart, and topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B singles chart for five weeks. Four other top 10 R&amp;B singles followed over the next year or so: &quot;I Want You to Be My Girl&quot;, &quot;I Promise to Remember&quot;, &quot;Who Can Explain?&quot; (the B side of &quot;I Promise to Remember&quot; but which charted on its own), &quot;The ABC&#x27;s of Love&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m Not a Juvenile Delinquent&quot;. &quot;I Want You To Be My Girl&quot; gave the band its second pop hit, reaching No. 13 on the national Billboard Hot 100 chart. &quot;Goody Goody&quot; (written by Matty Malneck and Johnny Mercer and originally performed by Benny Goodman) was a No. 20 pop hit but did not appear on the R&amp;B chart. The Teenagers placed two other singles in the lower half of the pop chart. With the release of &quot;I Want You To Be My Girl&quot;, the group&#x27;s second single, the Teenagers became Frankie Lymon &amp; the Teenagers. However, the album that mostly compiled the singles released in 1956 came out under the older name: &quot;The Teenagers Featuring Frankie Lymon&quot;.

===1957–65: Solo career===
In early 1957, Lymon and the Teenagers broke up while on a tour in Europe. During an engagement at the London Palladium, Goldner began pushing Lymon as a solo act, giving him solo spots in the show. Lymon began performing with backing from pre-recorded tapes. The group&#x27;s last single, &quot;Goody Goody&quot; backed with &quot;Creation of Love,&quot; initially retained the &quot;Frankie Lymon &amp; the Teenagers&quot; credit, but they were actually solo recordings (with backing by session singers). Lymon had officially departed from the group by September 1957; an in-progress studio album called &quot;Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers at the London Palladium&quot; was instead issued as a Lymon solo release.

As a solo artist, Lymon was not nearly as successful as he had been with the Teenagers. Beginning with his second solo release, &quot;My Girl&quot;, Lymon had moved to Roulette Records. On a July 19, 1957, episode of Alan Freed&#x27;s live ABC TV show &quot;The Big Beat&quot;, Lymon began dancing with a white teenage girl while performing. His actions caused a scandal, particularly among Southern TV station owners, and &quot;The Big Beat&quot; was subsequently canceled.

Lymon&#x27;s slowly declining sales fell sharply in the early 1960s. His highest-charting solo hit was a cover of Bobby Day&#x27;s &quot;Little Bitty Pretty One&quot;, which peaked at No. 58 on the Hot 100 pop chart in 1960 and which had been recorded in 1957. Addicted to heroin since the age of 15, Lymon fell further into his habit, and his performing career went into decline. According to Lymon in an interview with &quot;Ebony&quot; magazine in 1967, he was first introduced to heroin at age 15 by a woman twice his age. In 1961, Roulette, now run by Morris Levy, ended their contract with Lymon and he entered a drug rehabilitation program. After losing Lymon, the Teenagers went through a string of replacement singers, the first of whom was Billy Lobrano. In 1960, Howard Kenny Bobo sang lead on &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; with the Teenagers; later that year, Johnny Houston sang lead on two songs. The Teenagers, who had been moved by Morris Levy to End Records, were released from their contract in 1961. The Teenagers briefly reunited with Lymon in 1965, without success.

===1966–68: Later years===
Over the next four years, Lymon struggled through short-lived deals with 20th Century Fox Records and Columbia Records. He began a relationship with Elizabeth Mickey Waters, who became his first wife in January 1964 and gave birth to his only child, a baby girl named Francine who died two days after birth at Lenox Hill Hospital. Lymon&#x27;s marriage to Waters was not legal because she was still married to her first husband at the time. After the marriage failed, Lymon moved to Los Angeles in the mid-1960s, where he began a romantic relationship with Zola Taylor, a member of the Platters. Taylor claimed to have married Lymon in Mexico in 1965 although their relationship ended several months later, purportedly because of Lymon&#x27;s drug habits. However, Lymon had been known to say that their marriage was a publicity stunt, and Taylor could produce no legal documentation of their marriage. In Major Robinson&#x27;s gossip column of June 6, 1966, Zola said the whole thing was a joke that she went along with at the time (October 1965).

Lymon appeared at the Apollo as part of a revue, adding an extended tap dance number. He recorded several live performances (such as &quot;Melinda&quot; in 1959), but none rose on the charts. Lymon&#x27;s final television performance was on &quot;Hollywood a Go-Go&quot; in 1965, where he lip-synched to the recording of his 13-year-old self singing &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot;. On June 21, 1966, Lymon was arrested on a heroin charge and was drafted into the United States Army in lieu of a jail sentence. He reported to Fort Gordon, Georgia, near Augusta, Georgia, for training. While in the Augusta area, Lymon met and fell in love with Emira Eagle, a schoolteacher at Hornsby Elementary in Augusta. The two were wed in June 1967, and Lymon repeatedly went AWOL to secure gigs at small Southern clubs. Dishonorably discharged from the Army, Lymon moved into his wife&#x27;s home and continued to perform sporadically. Traveling to New York in 1968, Lymon was signed by manager Sam Bray to his Big Apple label, and the singer returned to recording. Roulette Records expressed interest in releasing Lymon&#x27;s records in conjunction with Big Apple and scheduled a recording session for February 28. A major promotion had been arranged with CHO Associates, owned by radio personalities Frankie Crocker, Herb Hamlett, and Eddie O&#x27;Jay. Lymon, staying at his grandmother&#x27;s apartment in Harlem, where he had grown up, celebrated his good fortune by taking heroin; Lymon had remained clean ever since entering the Army two years earlier.

==Death==
On February 27, 1968, Lymon was found dead on the floor of his grandmother&#x27;s bathroom from a heroin overdose with a syringe by his side. Lymon was only 25 years old. The overdose was a result from &quot;acute intravenous narcotism,&quot; according to his death certificate. Lymon, a Baptist, was buried at Saint Raymond&#x27;s Cemetery in the Throggs Neck section of The Bronx, New York City, New York. 

===Posthumous troubles===
&quot;I&#x27;m Sorry&quot; and &quot;Seabreeze&quot; are the two songs that Lymon had recorded for Big Apple before his death, and were posthumously released later in 1969.

Apart from the posthumous releases of these songs, Lymon&#x27;s troubles extended to others after his death. After Diana Ross returned &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot; to the Top Ten in 1981, a major controversy concerning Lymon&#x27;s estate ensued. Having neglected to divorce any of them and each claiming to be Frankie Lymon&#x27;s rightful widow, Zola Taylor, Elizabeth Waters, and Emira Eagle approached Morris Levy, the music impresario who retained possession of Lymon&#x27;s copyrights and his royalties. The complex issue resulted in lawsuits and counter-lawsuits, and in 1986 the first of several court cases concerning the ownership of Lymon&#x27;s estate began.

Trying to determine who was indeed the lawful Mrs. Frankie Lymon was complicated by more issues. Waters was already married when she married Lymon; she had separated from her first husband, but their divorce was finalized in 1965, after she had married Lymon. Taylor claimed to have married Lymon in Mexico in 1965, but could produce no acceptable evidence of their union. Lymon&#x27;s marriage to Eagle, on the other hand, was properly documented as having taken place at Beulah Grove Baptist Church in Augusta, Georgia, in 1967; however, the singer was still apparently twice-married and never divorced when he married Eagle. The first decision was made in Waters&#x27; favor; Eagle appealed, and in 1989, the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court reversed the original decision and awarded Lymon&#x27;s estate to Eagle.

However, the details of the case brought about another issue: whether mobster Morris Levy was deserving of the songwriting co-credit on &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot;. Although early single releases of &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot; credit Frankie Lymon, Herman Santiago, and Jimmy Merchant as co-writers, later releases and cover versions were attributed to Lymon and George Goldner. When Goldner sold his music companies to Morris Levy in 1959, Levy&#x27;s name began appearing as co-writer of &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot; in place of Goldner&#x27;s. Lymon was never paid his songwriting royalties during his lifetime; one result of Emira Eagle&#x27;s legal victory was that Lymon&#x27;s estate would finally begin receiving monetary compensation from his hit song&#x27;s success. In 1987, Herman Santiago and Jimmy Merchant, both by then poor, sued Morris Levy&#x27;s estate for their songwriting credits. In December 1992, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled that Santiago and Merchant were co-authors of &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot;. However, in 1996 the ruling was reversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on the basis of the statute of limitations: copyright cases must be brought before a court within three years of the alleged civil violation while Merchant and Santiago&#x27;s lawsuit was not filed until 30 years later. Authorship of &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot; currently remains in the names of Frankie Lymon and Morris Levy.

==Legacy==
Although their period of success was brief, Frankie Lymon &amp; the Teenagers&#x27; string of hits were highly influential on the rock and R&amp;B performers who followed them. Lymon&#x27;s high-voiced sound is said to be a direct predecessor of the girl group sound, and the list of performers who name him as an influence include Michael Jackson, Ronnie Spector, Diana Ross, the Chantels, the Temptations, George Clinton, Smokey Robinson, Len Barry, the Beach Boys and Billy Joel, among others. The performers most inspired by and derivative of Lymon and the Teenagers&#x27; style are the Jackson 5 and their lead singer and future superstar Michael Jackson. Motown founder Berry Gordy based much of the Jackson 5&#x27;s sound on Frankie Lymon &amp; the Teenagers&#x27; recordings, and the Teenagers are believed to be the original model for many of the other Motown groups he cultivated. 

In 1973, Lymon became known to a slightly younger generation than before with the release of &quot;American Graffiti&quot;, which included &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot; on its soundtrack. In September 1979 at the Santa Barbara Bowl, Joni Mitchell performed a version of &quot;Why Do Fools Fall In Love&quot; which subsequently appeared on the release of her album of the concert entitled &quot;Shadows and Light&quot; the following September. During the opening mix of the album, Mitchell also spliced sections of &quot;I&#x27;m Not A Juvenile Delinquent&quot; into the title track refrains.

The Fall referenced Lymon in &quot;No X-mas for John Quays&quot; on their March 1979 album &quot;Live at the Witch Trials&quot;. The English band Everything but the Girl, on their 1991 album &quot;Worldwide&quot;, include the song &quot;Boxing and Pop Music&quot; which references Lymon throughout the song. Lymon was mentioned in the 1992 Stephen King short story &quot;You Know They Got a Hell of a Band&quot;. Lymon is named as the one who cut off the waitress Sissy&#x27;s finger for trying to help the protagonists, Mary and Clark Willingham, escape from the town of Rock &amp; Roll Heaven, Oregon, which is inhabited by Janis Joplin, Otis Redding, Roy Orbison, and other musicians who died young.

In 1993, Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2000.

Lymon&#x27;s music and story were eventually re-introduced to modern audiences with &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot;, a 1998 biographical film directed by Gregory Nava, also the director of the &quot;Selena&quot; biopic. &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot; tells a comedic, fictionalized version of Lymon&#x27;s story from the points of view of his three wives as they battle in court for the rights to his estate. The film stars Larenz Tate as Frankie Lymon, Halle Berry as Zola Taylor, Vivica A. Fox as Elizabeth Waters and Lela Rochon as Emira Eagle. &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot; was not a commercial success and met with mixed reviews; the film grossed a total of $12,461,773 during its original theatrical run.

The song &quot;Harlem Roulette&quot; by the Mountain Goats, off its 2012 album &quot;Transcendental Youth&quot;, contains references to Frankie Lymon, to the song &quot;Seabreeze&quot;, and to Roulette Records. Frontman John Darnielle has stated that the song is about the last night of Lymon&#x27;s life.

Much of Lymon&#x27;s kinescoped footage from shows such as &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night Beechnut Show&quot; and the &quot;Mike Douglas Show&quot; remains unavailable due to copyright claims.

<text>Sly and the Family Stone was an American funk band formed in San Francisco, California in 1966 and active until 1983. They are considered to be pivotal in the development of funk, soul, R&amp;B, rock, and psychedelic music. Their core line-up was led by singer-songwriter, record producer, and multi-instrumentalist Sly Stone, and included Stone&#x27;s brother and singer/guitarist Freddie Stone, sister and singer/keyboardist Rose Stone, trumpeter Cynthia Robinson, drummer Greg Errico, saxophonist Jerry Martini, and bassist Larry Graham. The band was the first major American rock group to have a racially integrated, mixed-gender lineup.

Formed in 1966, the group&#x27;s music synthesized a variety of disparate musical genres to help pioneer the emerging &quot;psychedelic soul&quot; sound. They released a series of Top 10 &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 hits such as &quot;Dance to the Music&quot; (1968), &quot;Everyday People&quot; (1968), and &quot;Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)&quot; (1969), as well as critically acclaimed albums such as &quot;Stand!&quot; (1969), which combined pop sensibility with social commentary. In the 1970s, it transitioned into a darker and less commercial funk sound on releases such as &quot;There&#x27;s a Riot Goin&#x27; On&quot; (1971) and &quot;Fresh&quot; (1973), proving as influential as their early work. By 1975, drug problems and interpersonal clashes led to dissolution, though Sly continued to record and tour with a new rotating lineup under the name &quot;Sly and the Family Stone&quot; until drug problems forced his effective retirement in 1987.

The work of Sly and the Family Stone influenced the sound of subsequent American funk, pop, soul, R&amp;B, and hip hop music. Music critic Joel Selvin wrote, &quot;there are two types of black music: black music before Sly Stone, and black music after Sly Stone&quot;. In 2010, they were ranked 43rd in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, and three of their albums are included on the most recent version of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993.

== Career ==
Sylvester Stewart was born into the Dallas, Texas, family of K.C. and Alpha Stewart, followers of the Church of God in Christ (COGIC), who encouraged musical expression in the household. After the Stewarts moved to Vallejo, California, the youngest four children (Sylvester, Freddie, Rose, and Vaetta) formed &quot;The Stewart Four&quot;, who released a local 78 RPM single, &quot;On the Battlefield of the Lord&quot; b/w &quot;Walking in Jesus&#x27; Name&quot;.

While attending high school, Sylvester and Freddie joined student bands. One of Sylvester&#x27;s high school musical groups was a doo-wop act called The Viscaynes. The Viscaynes released a few local singles, and Sylvester recorded several solo singles under the name &quot;Danny Stewart&quot;.

By 1964, Sylvester had become Sly Stone. He became a disc jockey for San Mateo, California-located R&amp;B radio station KSOL, where he included white performers such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones in his playlists. During the same period, he worked as a record producer for Autumn Records, producing for San Francisco-area bands such as the Beau Brummels and the Mojo Men. One of the Sylvester Stewart-produced Autumn singles, Bobby Freeman&#x27;s &quot;C&#x27;mon and Swim&quot;, was a national hit. Stewart recorded unsuccessful solo singles while at Autumn.

=== Early years ===
In 1966, Sly Stone formed a band called Sly &amp; the Stoners, which included acquaintance Cynthia Robinson on trumpet. Around the same time, Freddie founded a band called Freddie &amp; the Stone Souls, which included Greg Errico on drums, and Ronnie Crawford on saxophone. At the suggestion of Stone&#x27;s friend, saxophonist Jerry Martini, Sly and Freddie combined their bands, creating Sly and the Family Stone in November 1966. At first the group was called Sly Brothers and Sisters but after their first gig at the Winchester Cathedral, a night club in Redwood City, California, they changed the name to Sly &amp; the Family Stone. Since both Sly and Freddie were guitarists, Sly appointed Freddie the official guitarist for the Family Stone, and taught himself to play the electronic organ. Sly also recruited Larry Graham, Robinson&#x27;s cousin, to play bass guitar.

Vaetta Stewart wanted to join the band as well. She and her friends, Mary McCreary and Elva Mouton, had a gospel group called &quot;the Heavenly Tones&quot;. Sly recruited the teenagers directly out of high school to become Little Sister, Sly and the Family Stone&#x27;s background vocalists.

After a gig at the Winchester Cathedral, CBS Records executive David Kapralik signed the group to CBS&#x27;s Epic Records label. The Family Stone&#x27;s first album, &quot;A Whole New Thing&quot;, was released in 1967 to critical acclaim, particularly from musicians such as Mose Allison and Tony Bennett. However, the album&#x27;s low sales restricted their playing venues to small clubs, and caused Clive Davis and the record label to intervene. Some musicologists believe the Abaco Dream single &quot;Life And Death in G &amp; A&quot;, recorded for A&amp;M Records in 1967 and peaking at No. 74 in September 1969, was performed by Sly and the Family Stone.

Davis talked Sly into writing and recording a record, and he and the band reluctantly provided the single &quot;Dance to the Music&quot;. Upon its February 1968 release, &quot;Dance to the Music&quot; became a widespread ground-breaking hit, and was the band&#x27;s first charting single, reaching No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Just before the release of &quot;Dance to the Music&quot;, Rose Stone joined the group as a vocalist and a keyboardist. Rose&#x27;s brothers had invited her to join the band from the beginning, but she initially had been reluctant to leave her steady job at a local record store.

The &quot;Dance to the Music&quot; album went on to decent sales, but the follow-up, &quot;Life&quot;, was not as successful commercially. In September 1968, the band embarked on its first overseas tour, to England. It was cut short after Graham was arrested for possession of marijuana and because of disagreements with concert promoters.

=== &quot;Stand!&quot; (1969) ===

In late 1968, Sly and the Family Stone released the single &quot;Everyday People&quot;, which became their first No. 1 hit. &quot;Everyday People&quot; was a protest against prejudice of all kinds and popularized the catchphrase &quot;different strokes for different folks&quot;. With its B-side &quot;Sing a Simple Song&quot;, it served as the lead single for the band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Stand!&quot;, which was released on May 3, 1969. The &quot;Stand!&quot; album eventually sold more than three million copies; its title track peaked at No. 22 in the U.S. &quot;Stand!&quot; is considered one of the artistic high points of the band&#x27;s career. It contained the above three tracks as well as the songs &quot;I Want to Take You Higher&quot; (which was the B-side of the &quot;Stand!&quot; single), &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Me Nigger, Whitey&quot;, &quot;Sex Machine&quot;, and &quot;You Can Make It If You Try&quot;.

The band headlined the Harlem Cultural Festival before tens of thousands of spectators in Mount Morris Park in 1969, several weeks before the more widely known Woodstock festival. The concert series is the subject of a 2021 documentary film directed by Ahmir &quot;Questlove&quot; Thompson called &quot;Summer of Soul.&quot;
The success of &quot;Stand!&quot; secured Sly and the Family Stone a performance slot at the landmark Woodstock Music and Art Festival. They performed their set during the early-morning hours of August 17, 1969; their performance was said to be one of the best shows of the festival. A new non-album single, &quot;Hot Fun in the Summertime&quot;, was released the same month and went to No. 2 on the U.S. pop chart (peaking in October, after the summer of 1969 had already ended). In 1970, following the release of the &quot;Woodstock&quot; documentary, the single of &quot;Stand!&quot; and &quot;I Want to Take You Higher&quot; was reissued with the latter song now the A-side; it reached the Top 40.

=== Internal problems and a change of direction ===
With the band&#x27;s new-found fame and success came numerous problems. Relationships within the band were deteriorating; there was friction in particular between the Stone brothers and Larry Graham. Epic requested more marketable output. The Black Panther Party demanded that Sly replace Gregg Errico and Jerry Martini with black instrumentalists and fire manager David Kapralik.

After moving to the Los Angeles area in fall 1969, Sly Stone and his fellow band members became heavy users of illegal drugs, primarily cocaine and PCP. As the members became increasingly focused on drug use and partying (Sly Stone carried a violin case filled with illegal drugs wherever he went), recording slowed significantly. Between summer 1969 and fall 1971, the band released only one single, &quot;Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)&quot;/&quot;Everybody Is a Star&quot;, released in December 1969. &quot;Thank You&quot; reached the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in February 1970.

During 1970, Sly Stone spent most of his waking hours on drugs. He became erratic and moody, and missed nearly a third of the band&#x27;s concerts that year. The band did close out the Strawberry Fields Festival near Toronto, Ontario, in August, but live appearances on television talk shows such as &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot; and &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot; went unpredictably. Meanwhile, Sly hired his streetwise cohorts, Hamp &quot;Bubba&quot; Banks and J.B. Brown, as his personal managers; they in turn brought in gangsters such as Edward &quot;Eddie Chin&quot; Elliott and Mafioso J.R. Valtrano to be Sly&#x27;s bodyguards. Sly enlisted these individuals to handle his business dealings, to retrieve drugs, and to protect him from those he considered his enemies, some of whom were his own bandmates and staff. A rift developed between Sly and the rest of the band; in early 1971, drummer Errico became the first to leave the band for other ventures. He was replaced with a succession of drummers until Sly settled on Gerry Gibson, who only remained with the band for a year before being replaced by Andy Newmark in 1973.

To appease fan demand for new songs, Epic began re-releasing material. &quot;A Whole New Thing&quot; was reissued with a new cover, and several of the Family Stone&#x27;s most popular recordings were packaged into the band&#x27;s first &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album. &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in 1970.

During this period, Sly Stone negotiated a production deal with Atlantic Records, resulting in his own imprint, Stone Flower Productions. Stone Flower released four singles, including one by R&amp;B artist Joe Hicks, one by a group called 6IX, and two pop Top 40/R&amp;B Top 10 singles by Little Sister: &quot;You&#x27;re the One&quot; and &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Watching You&quot;, a cover of a song from &quot;Stand!&quot;. For unclear reasons, Sly gradually withdrew his attention from Stone Flower, and the label was closed in 1971. Little Sister&#x27;s &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Watching You&quot; is the first popular recording to feature the use of a drum machine for its rhythm track.

=== &quot;There&#x27;s a Riot Goin&#x27; On&quot; (1971) ===
In 1971, Sly and the Family Stone returned with a new single, &quot;Family Affair&quot;, which became a number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100. &quot;Family Affair&quot; was the lead single from the band&#x27;s long-awaited &quot;There&#x27;s a Riot Goin&#x27; On&quot;.

Instead of the optimistic, rock-laced soul that had characterized the Family Stone&#x27;s 1960s output, &quot;There&#x27;s a Riot Goin&#x27; On&quot; was urban blues, filled with dark instrumentation, filtered drum machine tracks, and plaintive vocals representing the hopelessness Sly and many other people were feeling in the early 1970s. The album is characterized by a significant amount of tape hiss – the result of Sly&#x27;s extensive re-recording and overdubbing during production. Allegedly, most of the album&#x27;s instrumentation is performed by Sly alone, who enlisted the Family Stone for some of the additional instrumental parts and friends such as Billy Preston, Ike Turner, and Bobby Womack for others. &quot;(You Caught Me) Smilin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Runnin&#x27; Away&quot; were also released as singles, and performed well on the charts.

After the release of &quot;Riot&quot;, additional lineup changes took place. In early 1972, reacting to Jerry Martini&#x27;s probing about his share of the band&#x27;s earnings, Sly hired saxophonist Pat Rizzo as a potential replacement though both ended up remaining in the band. Later that year, the tension between Sly Stone and Larry Graham reached its peak. A post-concert brawl broke out between the Graham and Sly entourages; Bubba Banks and Eddie Chin, having heard that Larry had hired a hit man to kill Sly, assaulted Graham&#x27;s associates. Graham and his wife climbed out of a hotel window to escape, and Pat Rizzo gave them a ride to safety. Unable to continue working with Sly, Graham immediately quit the Family Stone and went on to start Graham Central Station, a successful band in the same vein as Sly and the Family Stone. Graham was replaced in the interim by Bobby Womack, and then by nineteen-year-old Rustee Allen.

=== &quot;Fresh&quot; (1973) and &quot;Small Talk&quot; (1974) ===
Despite the loss of the original rhythm section and Sly&#x27;s escalating cocaine use, the band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Fresh&quot;, was released in 1973. By this time, Sly&#x27;s sound had become more stripped down, yet more syncopated and rhythmically complex. Sly obsessively overdubbed the masters, as he had done with &quot;Riot&quot;. Although the record received mixed reviews at its release and did not attract the attention enjoyed by the band&#x27;s earlier work, &quot;Fresh&quot; has become recognized as one of the most important funk albums ever made. Rose Stone sang lead on a gospel-styled cover of Doris Day&#x27;s &quot;Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)&quot;, and the single &quot;If You Want Me to Stay&quot; became a Top 20 hit in the U.S. Its follow-up, &quot;Small Talk&quot;, was released in 1974 to mixed reviews and low sales. The first &quot;Small Talk&quot; single, &quot;Time For Livin&#x27;&quot;, became the band&#x27;s final Top 40 hit single. &quot;Loose Booty&quot;, the second single, peaked at No. 84.

=== Dissolution ===

During the 1970s, Sly or another of the band members would often miss a gig, refuse to play, or pass out from drug use, impacting their live bookings. At many gigs, concert-goers rioted if the band failed to appear or if Sly walked out before finishing his set. Ken Roberts became the group&#x27;s promoter, and later their general manager, when other representatives would not work with the band because of their erratic attendance. In January 1975, the band booked itself at Radio City Music Hall. The famed music hall was only one-eighth filled, and Sly and company had to scrape together money to return home. Following the Radio City engagement, the band was dissolved.

Rose Stone was pulled out of the band by Bubba Banks, who was then her husband. She began a solo career, recording a Motown-style album under the name Rose Banks in 1976. Freddie Stone joined Larry Graham&#x27;s group, Graham Central Station, for a time; after collaborating with his brother one last time in 1979 for &quot;Back on the Right Track&quot;, he retired from the music industry and eventually became the pastor of the Evangelist Temple Fellowship Center in Vallejo. Little Sister was also dissolved; Mary McCreary married Leon Russell and worked with him on music projects. Andy Newmark became a successful session drummer, playing with Roxy Music, Pink Floyd, B. B. King, Steve Winwood and others.

=== Sly Stone&#x27;s later career ===

Sly recorded two more albums for Epic: &quot;High on You&quot; (1975) and &quot;Heard You Missed Me, Well I&#x27;m Back&quot; (1976). &quot;High on You&quot; was billed as a Sly Stone solo album; &quot;Heard You Missed Me&quot; was a Sly and the Family Stone album in name only. Although Sly continued to collaborate with some of the original Family Stone members on occasion, the actual band no longer existed. Sly played most of the instruments on the record himself; he maintained a band to support him for live shows. Among his main collaborators were Cynthia Robinson and Pat Rizzo from the Family Stone, and background vocalists Lynn Mabry and Dawn Silva, who parted with Sly in 1977 and formed The Brides of Funkenstein in 1978. Epic released Stone from his contract in 1977, and in 1979 released &quot;10 Years Too Soon&quot;, a remix album featuring disco versions of the 1960s Family Stone hits.

Sly signed with Warner Bros. and recorded &quot;Back on the Right Track&quot; (1979). Although the album featured contributions from Freddie and Rose Stone, Sly remained unable to return to the success of his late &#x27;60s and early &#x27;70s fame. He toured with George Clinton and Funkadelic during the late 1970s and early 1980s, and also appeared on the 1981 Funkadelic album &quot;The Electric Spanking of War Babies&quot;. That year, Clinton and Sly began work on a new Sly Stone album; however, recording halted when Clinton and Funkadelic disputed with and left Warner Bros. Records in late 1981. When Sly disappeared into seclusion, producer Stewart Levine completed the album, which was released as &quot;Ain&#x27;t But the One Way&quot; in 1982. The album sold poorly and received mixed critical reception, but Sly made an appearance on &quot;Late Night With David Letterman&quot; that year. Overcome by drug addictions, Sly Stone toured the United States with various backup acts. In June 1983 in Ft. Myers, Florida, he was arrested on drug possession and entered court-ordered drug rehabilitation in 1983. Once released, Sly continued sporadically releasing new singles and collaborations until a 1987 arrest and conviction for cocaine possession and use. Afterwards, he stopped releasing music.

In 1992, Sly and the Family Stone appeared on the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s dance compilation album, &quot;Red Hot + Dance&quot;, contributing an original track, &quot;Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin) (Todds CD Mix)&quot;. The album attempted to raise awareness and money in support of the AIDS epidemic, and all proceeds were donated to AIDS charities.

In 2009 the documentary &quot;Coming Back for More&quot; was released. Sly tells director Willem Alkema about his conflicts with his manager Jerry Goldstein and that because of this he is forced to live in hotels.

On August 16, 2011, the album &quot;I&#x27;m Back! Family &amp; Friends&quot; was released. The album features re-recorded versions of Sly and the Family Stone&#x27;s greatest hits with guest appearances from Jeff Beck, Ray Manzarek, Bootsy Collins, Ann Wilson, Carmine Appice, and Johnny Winter, as well as three previously unreleased songs.

One month later, on September 25, 2011, the &quot;New York Post&quot; reported that Sly Stone was now homeless and living out of a white camper-van in Los Angeles: &quot;The van is parked on a residential street in Crenshaw, the rough Los Angeles neighborhood where Boyz n the Hood was set. A retired couple makes sure he eats once a day, and Stone showers at their house.&quot;

==Musical style and legacy ==

===Early years===
Sly Stone produced for and performed with black and white musicians during his early career, and he integrated music by white artists into black radio station KSOL&#x27;s playlist as a DJ. Similarly, the Sly and the Family Stone sound was a melting pot of many influences and cultures, including James Brown funk, Motown pop, Stax soul, Broadway showtunes, and psychedelic rock music. Wah-wah guitars, distorted fuzz basslines, church-styled organ lines, and horn riffs provided the musical backdrop for the vocals of the band&#x27;s four lead singers. Sly Stone, Freddie Stone, Larry Graham, and Rose Stone traded off on various bars of each verse, a style of vocal arrangement unusual and revolutionary at that time in popular music. Cynthia Robinson shouted ad-libbed vocal directions to the audience and the band; for example, urging everyone to &quot;get on up and &#x27;Dance to the Music&#x27;&quot; and demanding that &quot;all the squares go home!&quot;

The lyrics for the band&#x27;s songs were often pleas for peace, love, and understanding among people. These calls against prejudice and self-hate were underscored by the band&#x27;s on-stage appearance. White musicians Gregg Errico and Jerry Martini were members of the band at a time when integrated performance bands were virtually unknown; integration had only recently become enforced by law. Female members Cynthia Robinson and Rosie Stone played instruments onstage, rather than just providing vocals or serving as visual accompaniment for the male members. The band&#x27;s gospel-styled singing endeared them to black audiences; their rock music elements and wild costuming—including Sly&#x27;s large Afro and tight leather outfits, Rose&#x27;s blond wig, and the other members&#x27; loud psychedelic clothing—caught the attention of mainstream audiences, and helped the group enjoy success as a pop act.

Although &quot;Dance to the Music&quot; was the band&#x27;s only hit single until late 1968, the impact of that single and the &quot;Dance to the Music&quot; and &quot;Life&quot; albums reverberated across the music industry. The smooth, piano-based &quot;Motown sound&quot; was out; &quot;psychedelic soul&quot; was in, and the band would become a leading exponent of the sound. Rock-styled guitar lines similar to the ones Freddie Stone played began appearing in the music of artists such as The Isley Brothers (&quot;It&#x27;s Your Thing&quot;) and Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes (&quot;Love Child&quot;). Larry Graham invented the &quot;slapping technique&quot; of bass guitar playing, which became synonymous with funk music. Some musicians changed their sound completely to co-opt that of Sly and the Family Stone, most notably Motown in-house producer Norman Whitfield, who took his main act The Temptations into &quot;psychedelic soul&quot; territory starting with the Grammy-winning &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; in 1968. The early work of Sly and the Family Stone was also a significant influence on the music of Michael Jackson &amp; The Jackson 5 and soul/hip-hop groups such as George Clinton &amp; Parliament/Funkadelic, Arrested Development, and The Black Eyed Peas.

===Later work===
The later work of Sly and the Family Stone was as influential as the band&#x27;s early work. &quot;There&#x27;s a Riot Goin&#x27; On&quot;, &quot;Fresh&quot;, and &quot;Small Talk&quot; are considered among the first and best examples of the matured version of funk music, after prototypical instances of the sound in the band&#x27;s 1960s work. A 2003 article for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; commented; &quot;Sly and the Family Stone created a musical utopia: an interracial group of men and women who blended funk, rock and positive vibes... Sly Stone ultimately discovered that his utopia had a ghetto, and he brilliantly tore the whole thing down on &quot;There&#x27;s a Riot Goin&#x27; On&quot;, which does not refute the joy of his earlier music.&quot; In a retrospective review, Zeth Lundy of PopMatters called &quot;There&#x27;s a Riot Goin&#x27; On&quot; &quot;a challenging listen, at times rambling, incoherent, dissonant, and just plain uncomfortable&quot; with &quot;some episodic moments of pop greatness to be found&quot; and viewed it as a radical departure from the band&#x27;s previous work:

Writer Colin Larkin described the album as &quot;unlike anything heard before in black music&quot;. Herbie Hancock was inspired by Sly&#x27;s new funk sound to move towards a more electric sound with his material, resulting in &quot;Head Hunters&quot; (1973). Miles Davis was similarly inspired by the band and worked with Sly Stone on his recordings, resulting in &quot;On the Corner&quot;; the sartorial and band lineup changes hallmarked jazz fusion. Davis was particularly impressed with material from Stone&#x27;s 1973 album &quot;Fresh&quot;. British musician and ambient music pioneer Brian Eno cited &quot;Fresh&quot; as having heralded a shift in the history of recording, &quot;where the rhythm instruments, particularly the bass drum and bass, suddenly [became] the important instruments in the mix.&quot; Artists such as Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Prince, Outkast, Chuck D, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and John Mayer have also shown significant inspiration from the post-1970 work of Sly and the Family Stone.

== Awards and tributes ==
Sly and the Family Stone were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993. The original members of the Family Stone were in attendance, except Sly. Just as the band took the podium to receive their awards, Sly suddenly appeared. He accepted his award, made some very brief remarks (&quot;See you soon&quot;), and disappeared from public view. In December 2001, Sly and the Family Stone were awarded the R&amp;B Foundation Pioneer Award. Two Family Stone songs, &quot;Dance to the Music&quot; and &quot;Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Again)&quot;, are among The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked them 43rd on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.

In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list included &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; at number 60, &quot;There&#x27;s a Riot Goin&#x27; On&quot; at number 99, &quot;Stand!&quot; at number 118, and &quot;Fresh&quot; at number 186. In 2004, on their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included &quot;Family Affair&quot; at number 138, &quot;Everyday People&quot; at number 145, &quot;Dance to the Music&quot; at number 223, &quot;Stand!&quot; at number 241, &quot;Hot Fun in the Summertime&quot; at number 247, and &quot;Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)&quot; at number 402.

A Sly and the Family Stone tribute album, &quot;Different Strokes by Different Folks&quot;, was released on July 12, 2005, by Starbucks&#x27; Hear Music label. The project features cover versions of the band&#x27;s songs, songs which sample the original recordings, and songs that do both. The artists included The Roots (&quot;Star&quot;, which samples &quot;Everybody Is a Star&quot;), Maroon 5 (&quot;Everyday People&quot;), John Legend, Joss Stone &amp; Van Hunt (&quot;Family Affair&quot;); the Black Eyed Peas&#x27; will.i.am (&quot;Dance to the Music&quot;), and Steven Tyler and Robert Randolph (&quot;I Want to Take You Higher&quot;). Epic Records&#x27; version of the tribute album (with two additional covers: &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Me Nigger, Whitey&quot; and &quot;Thank You (Faletinme Be Mice Elf Again)&quot;) was released on February 7, 2006. The version of &quot;Family Affair&quot; won the 2007 R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal Grammy.

The group was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2007.
=== 2006 Grammy Awards tribute ===
A Sly and the Family Stone tribute took place at the 2006 Grammy Awards on February 8, 2006. The original plan, to have been a surprise for audiences, was to feature a reunion performance by the original Sly and the Family Stone lineup as the highlight of the tribute. However, the Grammy Award show&#x27;s producers were worried that Sly Stone, who missed some of the rehearsals and belatedly arrived for others, would miss the show.

The tribute began halfway through the Grammy Awards ceremony, and was introduced by comedian Dave Chappelle. It featured Nile Rodgers, Joss Stone, Van Hunt, and John Legend performing &quot;Family Affair&quot;; Fantasia and Devin Lima performing &quot;If You Want Me to Stay&quot;; Adam Levine and Ciara performing &quot;Everyday People&quot;; will.i.am performing &quot;Dance to the Music&quot;; and Steven Tyler and Joe Perry of Aerosmith with Robert Randolph performing &quot;I Want to Take You Higher&quot;.

After the first half of &quot;I Want to Take You Higher&quot;, the Family Stone took the stage alongside the other musicians, and Tyler called backstage &quot;Hey, Sly; let&#x27;s do it the way we used to do it!&quot; Sporting a blonde mohawk hairdo, sunglasses, and a silver lamé suit, Sly Stone emerged and contributed vocals and keyboards to a continuation of &quot;I Want To Take You Higher.&quot; Three minutes into the performance, Sly tossed a wave to the audience and exited the stage, leaving the Family Stone and the guest performers to complete the number alone.

Sly&#x27;s unusual appearance and brief performance garnered highly mixed reviews and was covered throughout the press. One Associated Press report referred to Sly as the &quot;J. D. Salinger of funk&quot; and simply referred to the performance as being &quot;bizarre&quot;. Another AP report stated that &quot;nineteen years after his last live performance, Sly Stone proved he&#x27;s still able to steal the show.&quot; MTV News was much less complimentary: &quot;The Grammy performance—Sly&#x27;s first with the original Family Stone since 1971—was a halting, confused affair and a complete disservice to his music.&quot;

<text>Rough consensus is a term used in consensus decision-making to indicate the &quot;sense of the group&quot; concerning a particular matter under consideration. It has been defined as the &quot;dominant view&quot; of a group as determined by its chairperson. The term was used by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in describing its procedures for working groups (WGs). The means to establish rough consensus was described by the IETF as follows:
Working groups make decisions through a &quot;rough consensus&quot; process. IETF consensus does not require that all participants agree although this is, of course, preferred. In general, the dominant view of the working group shall prevail. (However, &quot;dominance&quot; is not to be determined on the basis of volume or persistence, but rather a more general sense of agreement). Consensus can be determined by a show of hands, humming, or any other means on which the WG agrees (by rough consensus, of course). Note that 51% of the working group does not qualify as &quot;rough consensus&quot; and 99% is better than rough. It is up to the Chair to determine if rough consensus has been reached (IETF Working Group Guidelines and Procedures).

The phrase is often extended into the saying &quot;rough consensus and running code&quot;, to make it clear that the IETF is interested in practical, working systems that can be quickly implemented. There is some debate as to whether running code leads to rough consensus or vice versa. There is also caution about whether percentages are a good measure for rough consensus. The IETF published a subsequent document pointing out that supporting percentage is less important for determining &quot;rough consensus&quot; than ensuring opposing views are addressed.

<text>Rockefeller Center is a complex of 19 commercial buildings covering between 48th Street and 51st Street in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. The 14 original Art Deco buildings, commissioned by the Rockefeller family, span the area between Fifth Avenue and Sixth Avenue, split by a large sunken square and a private street called Rockefeller Plaza. Later additions include 75 Rockefeller Plaza across 51st Street at the north end of Rockefeller Plaza, and four International Style buildings on the west side of Sixth Avenue.

In 1928, Columbia University, the owner of the site, leased the land to John D. Rockefeller Jr., who was the main person behind the complex&#x27;s construction. Originally envisioned as the site for a new Metropolitan Opera building, the current Rockefeller Center came about after the Met could not afford to move to the proposed new building. Various plans were discussed before the current one was approved in 1932. Construction of Rockefeller Center started in 1931, and the first buildings opened in 1933. The core of the complex was completed by 1939. Described as one of the greatest projects of the Great Depression era, Rockefeller Center became a New York City designated landmark in 1985 and a National Historic Landmark in 1987. The complex and associated land has been controlled since 2000 by Tishman Speyer, which bought the property for $1.85 billion.

The original center has several sections. Radio City, along Sixth Avenue and centered on 30 Rockefeller Plaza, includes Radio City Music Hall and was built for RCA&#x27;s radio-related enterprises such as NBC. The International Complex along Fifth Avenue was built to house foreign-based tenants. The remainder of the original complex originally hosted printed media as well as Eastern Air Lines. While 600 Fifth Avenue is at the southeast corner of the complex, it was built by private interests in the 1950s and was only acquired by the center in 1963. The complex is noted for the large quantities of art present in almost all of its buildings, its expansive underground concourse, its ice-skating rink, and its annual lighting of the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree.

==History==
===Context===

The first private owner of the site was physician David Hosack, who purchased twenty acres of rural land from New York City in 1801 and opened the country&#x27;s first public botanical garden, the Elgin Botanic Garden, on the site. The gardens operated until 1811, and by 1823 the property was under the ownership of Columbia University. Columbia moved its main campus north to Morningside Heights, in Upper Manhattan, by the turn of the century.

In 1926, the Metropolitan Opera started looking for locations for a new opera house to replace the existing building at 39th Street and Broadway. By 1928, Benjamin Wistar Morris and designer Joseph Urban were hired to come up with blueprints for the house. However, the new building was too expensive for the Met to fund by itself, and John D. Rockefeller Jr. eventually gave his support to the project (John D. Rockefeller Sr., his father, was not involved). Rockefeller hired Todd, Robertson and Todd as design consultants to determine its viability. John R. Todd then put forth a plan for the Met. Columbia leased the plot to Rockefeller for 87 years at a cost of $3 million per year, excluding some properties on Fifth Avenue and a strip on Sixth Avenue. The initial cost of acquiring the space, razing some of the existing buildings, and constructing new buildings was estimated at $250 million.

Rockefeller hired Corbett, Harrison &amp; MacMurray; Hood, Godley &amp; Fouilhoux; and Reinhard &amp; Hofmeister, to design the buildings. They worked under the umbrella of &quot;Associated Architects&quot; so none of the buildings could be attributed to any specific firm. The principal builder and &quot;managing agent&quot; was John R. Todd, one of the co-founders of Todd, Robertson and Todd. The principal architect and leader of the Associated Architects was Raymond Hood, a student of the Art Deco architectural movement. The other architects included Harvey Wiley Corbett and Wallace Harrison. L. Andrew Reinhard and Henry Hofmeister had been hired by John Todd as the &quot;rental architects&quot;, who designed the floor plans for the complex. The Metropolitan Square Corporation (the precursor to Rockefeller Center Inc.) was formed in December 1928 to oversee construction.

After the stock market crash of 1929, the Metropolitan Opera could not afford to move anymore. After the opera plans were canceled on December 6, 1929, Rockefeller quickly negotiated with Radio Corporation of America (RCA) and its subsidiaries, National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and Radio-Keith-Orpheum (RKO), to build a mass media entertainment complex on the site. By May 1930, RCA and its affiliates had agreed to develop the site. Todd released a new plan &quot;G-3&quot; in January 1930, followed by an &quot;H plan&quot; that March. Another plan, announced in March 1931, received mostly negative feedback from the public. The design of the complex was affected greatly by the 1916 Zoning Resolution, which required setbacks to all high street-side exterior walls of New York City buildings in order to increase sunlight for city streets. The plan also included rooftop gardens and a recessed central plaza. The International Complex, announced in 1931, replaced an earlier plan for an oval retail building; its name was derived by the British, French, and Italian tenants who eventually occupied it.

During early planning, the development was often referred to as &quot;Radio City&quot;, &quot;Rockefeller City&quot;, or &quot;Metropolitan Square&quot; (after the Metropolitan Square Corporation). Ivy Lee, the Rockefeller family&#x27;s publicity adviser, suggested changing the name to &quot;Rockefeller Center&quot;. John Rockefeller Jr. initially did not want the Rockefeller family name associated with the commercial project, but was persuaded on the grounds that the name would attract far more tenants. The name was formally changed in December 1931. Over time, the appellation of &quot;Radio City&quot; devolved from describing the entire complex to just the complex&#x27;s western section, and by 1937, only the Radio City Music Hall contained the &quot;Radio City&quot; name.

===Construction===
For the project, 228 buildings on the site were razed and some 4,000 tenants relocated. Demolition of the properties began in 1930. All of the buildings&#x27; leases had been bought by August 1931, though there were some tenants on the western and southeastern edges of the plot who refused to leave their property, and Rockefeller Center was built around these buildings. Excavation of the Sixth Avenue side of the complex began in July 1931, and construction on the first buildings, Radio City Music Hall and the Center Theatre, began later that year. of Indiana Limestone were ordered for the project in December 1931, the largest such order at the time.

The RKO Building was the first structure to be completed, in September 1932, followed by the Music Hall in December 1932 and the British Empire Building in April 1933. The RCA Building&#x27;s opening was delayed from May 1 to mid-May because of a controversy over &quot;Man at the Crossroads&quot;, a painting in the building&#x27;s lobby, which was later covered up and removed. A new street through the complex, Rockefeller Plaza, was constructed in stages between 1933 and 1937. The complex&#x27;s famed Christmas tree in the center of the plaza was erected for the first time in December 1933, and the complex&#x27;s Prometheus statue was constructed in May 1934. By July 1934, the complex had leased 80% of the available space in the six buildings that were already opened.

Work on two more internationally themed retail buildings and a larger, 38-story, &quot;International Building&quot;, started in September 1934. One of the two small buildings was already rented to Italian interests. The final small building would have been rented by Germany, but Rockefeller ruled this out in 1934 after noticing National Socialist extremism from the country&#x27;s government. The empty office site was downsized and became the &quot;International Building North&quot;, rented by various international tenants. In April 1935, developers opened the International Building and its wings.

The underground pedestrian mall and ramp system between 48th and 51st streets was finished in early May. In 1936, an ice skating rink replaced the unprofitable retail space on the lower plaza, below ground level.

The 36-story Time &amp; Life Building, named for anchor tenant Time Inc., was completed in November 1936, replacing an empty plot on the southern block that had been used for vehicle parking. Eleven buildings had been completed by 1937 at a total cost of over $100 million. A building for Associated Press on the northern block&#x27;s empty lot, which had been reserved for the Metropolitan Opera house, was topped out by June 1938 and occupied by December of that year. The presence of Associated Press and Time Inc. expanded Rockefeller Center&#x27;s scope from strictly a radio-communications complex to a hub of both radio and print media. The Guild, a newsreel theater, opened in 1938 along the curve of the truck ramp below the Associated Press Building. After Nelson Rockefeller became president of Rockefeller Center in 1938, he fired John Todd as the complex&#x27;s manager and appointed Hugh Robertson in his place. The Rockefeller family started occupying the 56th floor of the RCA Building, though the offices would later expand to the 54th and 55th floors as well.

A proposed 16-story building in the center of the southernmost block was leased to Eastern Air Lines in June 1940. Excavation started in October 1938, and the building was topped out by April 1939. At the same time, Rockefeller Center Inc. wanted to develop the western half of the southern plot, which was partially occupied by the Center Theatre. The United States Rubber Company agreed to occupy the plot, and excavation of the U.S. Rubber Company Building site commenced in May 1939. John Rockefeller installed the building&#x27;s ceremonial final rivet on November 1, 1939, marking the completion of the original complex. However, although the final rivet had been driven, the Eastern Air Lines Building was not completed until October 1940.

The construction of the project employed between 40,000 and 60,000 people. The complex was the largest private building project ever undertaken in contemporary times. Architectural historian Carol Herselle Krinsky describes the center as &quot;the only large private permanent construction project planned and executed between the start of the Depression and the end of the Second World War&quot;. According to writer Daniel Okrent, Rockefeller Center was so extensive that it was said that &quot;you could do anything you wanted except sleep (no hotels), pray (no churches), or not pay rent to [John Rockefeller Jr.]&quot;. By fall 1939, the complex had 26,000 tenants and 125,000 daily visitors. That year, 1.3 million people went on a guided tour of Rockefeller Center or visited the RCA Building&#x27;s observation deck, while 6 million people visited the underground shopping mall, and 7 million saw a performance at Rockefeller Center.

===World War II era===
Even before the U.S. officially entered World War II in 1941, Rockefeller Center was affected by the war. The Dutch government had been slated to take up one-fifth of the space at 10 Rockefeller Plaza, but could not do so because of World War II. Seven of the complex&#x27;s eight travel agencies had to move elsewhere because of the war, and William Rhodes Davis, a tenant who shipped oil to Nazi Germany and fascist Italy, was denied a lease renewal in 1941. After the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Rockefeller Center Inc. terminated all lease agreements with German, Italian, and Japanese tenants because their respective countries comprised the Axis powers, whom the United States were fighting against. Art on Palazzo d&#x27;Italia was taken down because they were seen as being fascist, and the Rainbow Room was closed to the public from 1943 to 1950. Instructions for blackouts and sandbags for extinguishing fires were placed throughout the complex. During the war, the RCA Building&#x27;s Room 3603 became the primary location of the U.S. operations of British Intelligence&#x27;s British Security Co-ordination, organized by William Stephenson. It also served as the office of Allen Dulles, who would later head the Central Intelligence Agency.

Rockefeller Center only became profitable after the last building in the original complex was completed. The complex had incurred $26 million in debt by 1935, which had increased to $39 million by 1940. However, the complex was already 87% rented by 1940, and by the next year, Rockefeller Center was nearly fully rented, making a profit for the first time in its history. By 1944, the complex&#x27;s existing rentable area totaled , with 99.7% of the space being leased. Because the complex was almost completely rented, Rockefeller Center&#x27;s managers kept waiting lists of potential tenants, and as a result of the waiting lists, the complex&#x27;s office space became more desirable to these tenants. Two years later, there were 400 companies who wanted to rent space in Rockefeller Center, and the complex&#x27;s managers determined that they would need to add of space in order to house all the prospective tenants. Rockefeller Center was also popular among visitors: for instance, the lines to enter one of the Music Hall&#x27;s five daily shows stretched from Sixth Avenue and 50th Street to Fifth Avenue and 52nd Street, a distance of four blocks.

In light of the abundance of possible renters, John Rockefeller Jr. transferred his ownership of the complex to his sons. The father collected the $57.5 million loan that Rockefeller Center Inc. owed him, then distributed it to his sons in the form of a tax break. Rockefeller Center eventually became the family&#x27;s &quot;single largest repository&quot; of wealth. In 1950, Rockefeller Center Inc. paid the last installment of the $65 million mortgage owed to the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. Three years later, the complex was making $5 million per year in profit, excluding the tax breaks.

=== Post-World War II expansion ===

Rockefeller Center Inc. had started working on plans to expand the complex during World War II, even though the outbreak of the war had stopped almost all civilian construction projects. In 1943, the complex&#x27;s managers bought land and buildings on three street corners near the complex. Rockefeller Center unveiled plans for expansion to the southwest and north in 1944.

Esso (now Exxon) was one of the tenants who wanted to expand, and the company signaled that it would build its own office tower if Rockefeller Center&#x27;s managers did not construct a building for them. They were given land at the north end of Rockefeller Plaza. In February 1947, the under-construction Esso Building, at the north end of the existing property, became part of Rockefeller Center after ownership of the building was transferred from the Haswin Corporation to Rockefeller Center, Inc. The building was topped out the next month. Hugh Robertson stepped down as manager the next year, and he was replaced by Gustav Eyssell.

Some tenants, such as the Sinclair Oil Corporation, indicated that they wanted to leave the complex after their leases expired in 1962–1963 because the original complex&#x27;s buildings did not have air conditioning, while newer office buildings did. As Columbia University still owned the land underneath the complex, they were tasked with installing air conditioning in the buildings. The new building would add emphasis to any north–south views of the center, since the existing complex&#x27;s building only formed west–east axes. Another problem befell Rockefeller Center&#x27;s key tenants, NBC and RCA, who were approached by other developers with the promise of more leasable space, a commodity that was scarce in the fully leased complex. These problems were pushed aside temporarily by the onset of the Korean War in 1950. By 1951, Columbia had acquiesced to reimbursing Rockefeller Center, Inc., for AC installation, while NBC and RCA were given permission to use the Center Theatre for extra broadcasting space.

In 1949, in the face of a shrinking congregation, the St. Nicholas Church leased the church building to the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company, who then leased three contiguous plots from Rockefeller Center for a proposed 28-story building. The congregation was dispersed to other churches, and the old church building at Fifth Avenue and 48th Street was subsequently demolished. Construction commenced on 600 Fifth Avenue in 1950, and the tower was completed by 1952. The building was named after the Sinclair Oil Company, who leased eight floors. As a result of Sinclair&#x27;s relocation to 600 Fifth Avenue, as well as Esso&#x27;s relocation to 75 Rockefeller Plaza, NBC and RCA could expand into the space that Sinclair and Esso formerly occupied in the original complex, and they moved out of the Center Theatre shortly after the Sinclair Oil Company moved into its own tower. In mid-1953, Columbia bought all of the land along Sixth Avenue that had been owned by the Underel Corporation at a cost of $5.5 million. Rockefeller Center leased the land back from Columbia until 1973 for $200,000 a year. This allowed Columbia to install air conditioning, passing the costs on to the remaining tenants in return for lease extensions.

The small Center Theatre was deemed redundant to the Radio City Music Hall, and in its final years, had been used as an NBC and RCA broadcasting space. After NBC and RCA expanded into the floor area formerly occupied by Sinclair, the U.S. Rubber Company indicated that it wanted to expand its office building into the space that was taken up by the underused theater. In October 1953, it was announced that the theater would be demolished. It was demolished in 1954.

Time-Life also wanted to expand, as its existing space in 1 Rockefeller Plaza was also becoming insufficient. In August 1953, Rockefeller Center, Inc., bought a tract of land on the west side of Sixth Avenue between 50th and 51st streets. In 1956, two years after the demolition of the Center Theatre, officials announced the construction of a new tower, the Time-Life Building, on that plot. The , $7 million building would include connections to the existing passageway system and to Roxy&#x27;s Theater directly to its west. Time Inc. and Rockefeller Center formed a joint venture, Rock-Time Inc., which would share the tower&#x27;s rent income between Time Inc. and Rockefeller Center. Construction on the Time-Life Building&#x27;s steelwork started in April 1958, and the structure topped out in November of that year. The building officially opened in December 1959.

Around 1960, Rockefeller Center, Uris Buildings Corporation, and Webb and Knapp formed another joint venture, Rock-Uris Corp. Originally, the venture wanted to construct a hotel to the west of 75 Rockefeller Center, but ultimately, a glass-and-concrete 43-story office building was built on the site. In 1961, the building was named after Sperry Corporation, who leased eight floors in the future building. The hotel, New York Hilton at Rockefeller Center, was built two blocks north in 1963.

600 Fifth Avenue was sold to Rockefeller Center&#x27;s managers in 1963, thus officially becoming part of Rockefeller Center. The same year, officials from Esso (later renamed Exxon) proposed a new building for the complex because the company had outgrown the space in the buildings it already occupied. Rockefeller Center&#x27;s managers hired the architectural firm Harrison &amp; Abramovitz to design three new towers on the west side of Sixth Avenue, with one tower on each block between 47th and 50th streets. The Exxon Building, at 1251 Avenue of the Americas between 49th and 50th streets, was formally announced in August 1967. Three months later, officials also announced plans for a tower housing McGraw-Hill, located one block south at 1221 Avenue of the Americas. Plans for a tower anchored by Celanese, to be located at 1211 Avenue of the Americas between 47th and 48th streets, would not be revealed until 1970. The Exxon Building opened in 1971, followed by the McGraw-Hill Building in 1973 and the Celanese Building in 1974. By the time all three of the new buildings were opened, Rockefeller Center contained 7% of Manhattan&#x27;s of leasable office space.

=== 1970s and 1980s ===

600 Fifth Avenue and 75 Rockefeller Plaza received renovations in the early 1970s. Unlike in the rest of the complex, where different components were renovated one at a time to avoid disturbing tenants, the two structures were renovated all at once because their space was largely vacant. Rockefeller Center Inc. renewed their lease on the complex in 1973.

Through the 1960s, the Music Hall was successful regardless of the status of the city&#x27;s economic, business, or entertainment sectors as a whole. However, by the early 1970s, the proliferation of closed-captioned foreign movies had reduced attendance at the Music Hall. The first round of staff and performer firings began in 1972. By January 1978, the Music Hall was in debt, and the hall&#x27;s annual attendance had declined to 1.5 million visitors, down from 5 million in 1968. Officials stated that it could not remain open after April. A grassroots campaign formed the Showpeople&#x27;s Committee to Save Radio City Music Hall. After several weeks of lobbying, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) designated the theater as an interior city landmark in March, followed by a National Register of Historic Places listing in May. The hall was set to close on April 12, but five days before the planned closing date, the Empire State Development Corporation voted to create a nonprofit subsidiary to lease the Music Hall.

A &quot;New York Times&quot; report in 1982 stated that Rockefeller Center had been popular among tenants from its inception, being almost fully rented for much of the first half-century of its existence. The major exception was in the 1970s, when it was only 85 percent rented. However, Rockefeller Center was not popular as an entertainment complex, having been used for mainly commercial purposes through its history. The LPC held hearings in 1983 to determine how much of Rockefeller Center should be protected as a landmark. The Rockefeller family and Columbia University acknowledged that the buildings were already symbolically landmarks, but their spokesman John E. Zuccotti recommended that only a small section (including the RCA Building, Lower Plaza, and Channel Gardens) should be protected. By contrast, almost everyone else who supported Rockefeller Center&#x27;s landmark status recommended that the entire complex be landmarked. The LPC granted landmark status to the exteriors of all of the original complex&#x27;s buildings, as well as the interiors of the International Building&#x27;s and 30 Rockefeller Plaza&#x27;s lobbies, on April 23, 1985. In its approval of the complex&#x27;s landmark status, the commission wrote, &quot;Rockefeller Center ranks among the grandest architectural projects ever undertaken in the United States&quot;. The buildings became a National Historic Landmark two years later. The United States Department of the Interior wrote in its report that the center was &quot;one of the most successful urban planning projects in the history of American architecture&quot;.

Columbia University was not making enough money from Rockefeller Center leases by the 1970s, since a series of negotiations with Rockefeller Center Inc. (now Rockefeller Group) had effectively reduced the annual lease payment to $11 million. The university&#x27;s funds had dwindled so much that by 1972, their expenses were paid for by their endowment fund. In 1983, Columbia University started looking to sell the land beneath Rockefeller Center. Two years later, Columbia agreed to sell the land to the Rockefeller Group for $400 million. The Rockefeller Group immediately set out to modernize many aspects of the complex. The Rainbow Room was closed for a $20 million restoration and expansion that brought the restaurant&#x27;s floor area to , and it reopened in December 1987. The RCA Building&#x27;s observation deck was subsequently closed because the Rainbow Room&#x27;s expansion eliminated the only passageway to the observatory&#x27;s elevator bank. In mid-1988, the RCA Building was renamed the GE Building. Mitsubishi Estate, a real estate company of the Mitsubishi Group, purchased the Rockefeller Group in 1989.

===1990s to present===
The Rockefeller Group filed for bankruptcy protection in May 1995 after missing several mortgage payments. That November, John Rockefeller Jr.&#x27;s son David and a consortium led by Goldman Sachs agreed to buy Rockefeller Center&#x27;s buildings for $1.1 billion, beating out Sam Zell and other bidders. The consortium, which also included Gianni Agnelli and Stavros Niarchos, finalized its acquisition in July 1996. Before the sale was even completed, the consortium sold of space in 30 Rockefeller Plaza to NBC, who had rented that space in the tower since the beginning. A preservation dispute arose in May 1998, when the owners announced plans to enlarge shop windows on the center&#x27;s Fifth Avenue buildings to two stories. These windows were reduced in size upon the LPC&#x27;s request, and the modifications were approved in September 1998. Due to the decline of the newsreel theater industry, the Guild was shuttered in late 1999 after Tishman Speyer decided not to renew its lease.

Tishman Speyer, led by David Rockefeller&#x27;s close friend Jerry Speyer and the Lester Crown family of Chicago, bought the original 14 buildings and land in 2000 for $1.85 billion. With the sale, the Rockefeller family gave up its remaining interest in Rockefeller Center&#x27;s operation. Tishman Speyer also decided to renovate the complex&#x27;s retail spaces and underground concourse. The Rainbow Room closed in 2009 in preparation for an extensive renovation that started in 2011. The restaurant reopened in October 2014. The Rockefeller family moved out of their offices in the GE Building in 2014 due to rising rents. They re-settled in less expensive offices on 49th Street, near their old headquarters. The next year, in July 2015, the GE Building was renamed after Comcast, the parent company of NBCUniversal. Future Green installed temporary artwork in the Channel Gardens in 2019 to celebrate the 250th anniversary of David Hosack&#x27;s birth.

In January 2020, Tishman Speyer hired Gabellini Sheppard Associates to design a renovation for Channel Gardens, Rockefeller Plaza, and the Lower Plaza. These plans included modifications to lighting, planting, pathways, and facades. The plans were approved that April. Gabellini Sheppard also proposed renovating the International Building&#x27;s lobby. A rooftop garden above Radio City Music Hall opened in September 2021. Starting in 2022, a roller rink called Flipper&#x27;s Roller Boogie Palace was set up in the Lower Plaza from April to October. In addition, 19 eateries opened within Rockefeller Center during the early 2020s, including 12 sit-down restaurants. In April 2023, Tishman Speyer proposed renovating ten of 10 Rockefeller Plaza&#x27;s upper stories into a 130-room hotel. At the time, 93 percent of the complex&#x27;s office space was leased, but the offices were largely empty during workdays. An event venue named Hero opened at Rockefeller Center that November. The Rockefeller Group also renovated the complex in the mid-2020s, adding restaurants and stores, and Tishman Speyer refinanced Rockefeller Center in October 2024 with a $3.5 billion loan.

==Buildings==

The current complex is a combination of two building complexes and a standalone building: 13 of the original Art Deco office buildings from the 1930s, one building across 51st Street built in 1947, and a set of four International-style towers built along the west side of Avenue of the Americas during the 1960s and 1970s. The center spans in total, with some in office space.

===Landmarked buildings===
The landmarked buildings comprise in Midtown, bounded by Fifth and Sixth avenues between 48th and 51st streets. Built as a cohesive unit, the buildings have been owned by Tishman Speyer since 2000. The buildings are spread along six blocks, with three blocks facing each avenue. These six blocks are the size of three standard blocks. One of the landmark buildings&#x27; defining features is the Indiana limestone facade possessed by all 14 structures, as specified in the original plans. All of the structures were designed by Associated Architects, with Raymond Hood as the principal architect, and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

====Radio City====
The east side of Sixth Avenue, officially known as Avenue of the Americas, contains most of the buildings that were built specifically for the proposed radio complex. These buildings, which comprise &quot;Radio City&quot;, are 1230 Avenue of the Americas, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, Radio City Music Hall and 1270 Avenue of the Americas. The idea for an integrated media complex somewhere came in 1920, when Owen D. Young, the chairman of RCA parent General Electric, suggested that RCA combine its then-disparate offices into one location.

The western half of the southernmost block of the complex along Sixth Avenue, between 48th and 49th streets, contains the former U.S. Rubber Company Building (now Simon &amp; Schuster Building) at 1230 Avenue of the Americas. The last structure in the original complex to be built, it was topped out in November 1939. The 23-story building contains two 7-story wings on its north and south sides. It was renamed after Uniroyal in 1967, and again after Simon &amp; Schuster in 1976. 1230 Avenue of the Americas was expanded to the east in 1954 after the Center Theatre adjacent to it was demolished. The 19-story annex, designed by Wallace Harrison and Max Abramovitz, had a glass facade on the lowest two stories—reflecting the design of the former American Airlines Building across Sixth Avenue—and a limestone facade above the second story. It is aligned with the axis of 10 Rockefeller Plaza on the eastern side of the block, and its northern and southern elevations contain five setbacks. The exterior also houses an abstract bas-relief created by Naum Gabo.

The Center Theatre, at 1236 Sixth Avenue, was the only structure in the original Rockefeller Center to be demolished. Originally the &quot;RKO Roxy Theatre&quot;, it was renamed after Fox Theatres sued Roxy Rothafel over the naming rights to the nearby Roxy Theatre, which Rothafel had originally managed. The 3,700-seat Center Theatre had a short massing (general shape) in place due to height restrictions at the time, which prohibited construction above theater auditoriums. The theater&#x27;s stage was enlarged for musicals in 1936, and four years later, 380 seats were removed in order to make way for an ice rink for skating spectaculars. It showed film, musicals, ice-skating competitions, and television through its 21-year existence. Due to its duplication of the larger Radio City Music Hall&#x27;s activities, it was deemed uneconomical almost from its opening, and was considered redundant by the 1950s. In 1954, it was replaced by the expansion of 1230 Avenue of the Americas.

The block immediately to the north, on Sixth Avenue between 49th and 50th streets, is occupied by 30 Rockefeller Plaza and its western annex at 1250 Sixth Avenue. The 70-floor, building anchors the entire complex, and is located on the eastern side of the block. Opened in 1933 as the RCA Building, the building has been renamed multiple times, first to the GE Building in 1988, after General Electric bought RCA, and then to the Comcast Building in 2014 after Comcast&#x27;s purchase of NBCUniversal. 30 Rockefeller Plaza was built as a single structure occupying the entire block between Sixth Avenue and Rockefeller Plaza, and its design was influenced by John Todd&#x27;s desire for the building to use its air rights to their maximum potential. It has three main segments: the 66-story tower rising from the eastern part of the base with the famous Rainbow Room restaurant on the 65th floor, and, formerly, the Rockefeller family office; a windowless segment in the middle of the base that houses NBC Studios; and a shorter 16-story tower on the western part of the base at 1250 Avenue of the Americas. As an icon of the complex, 30 Rockefeller Plaza&#x27;s architecture influenced the design of the rest of the complex, with its limestone facade and Gothic-inspired four-leafed spandrels.

Radio City Music Hall at 1260 Avenue of the Americas, occupying the southwestern portion of the block between 50th and 51st streets. The only remaining theater in the complex, it was similar in style to the Center Theatre, but at a larger scale. Construction started in December 1931, and the hall opened in December 1932. The Music Hall seats 6,000 people, and since opening has seen over 300 million visitors. Located in a niche adjacent to the neighboring 1270 Avenue of the Americas, the Music Hall is housed under the building&#x27;s seventh-floor setback.

The other building on the block between 50th and 51st streets is 1270 Avenue of the Americas, a 31-story structure with a setback on the sixth floor. Originally named the RKO Building for RKO Pictures, it was built over the Music Hall, and shares many of the same exterior architectural details. Construction of the building started in 1931, and the building was complete by September 1932. Henry Hofmeister designed the building, as well as several other office buildings in the city that were built over theaters. The building&#x27;s entrance design, blending in with that of the other buildings in the Radio City section, is marked by three sculptural bas-reliefs created by Robert Garrison for each of the building&#x27;s three bays, signifying muses of Contemporary Thought, Morning, and Evening. In 1990, Robert Kushner created three bronze sculptures of winged spirits for the lobby. The RKO Building served as headquarters for its namesake company in the 1930s, and was renamed for the American Metal Climax Company (AMAX), its new owners, in the early 1960s.

====International complex====
The International Complex is along Fifth Avenue, with the 41-story International Building and four smaller country-themed structures with retail outlets. The tower and the two southern retail buildings—were planned after the cancellation of the incongruously designed oval retail building in 1931, while the two retail wings east of the International Building were designed later. The low rectangular structures that replaced the oval building were seen as a more suitable design for the avenue. The current international theme was decided on due to a lack of American tenants willing to rent there; eventually, the structures were occupied by British, French, and Italian interests, although the Italian interests ultimately were the only foreign tenants who rented for the long term.

All four retail the structures have identical limestone facades, roof gardens, and ground-floor storefronts, but differ in the artworks with which they were decorated. Contemporary advertisements for shopping on Fifth Avenue touted the complex&#x27;s proximity to the Saks Fifth Avenue flagship store and St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral. When viewed from Fifth Avenue, the buildings provide a foreground for the taller 30 Rockefeller Plaza building behind them. The Channel Gardens separate the British Empire Building and La Maison Francaise.

The southernmost of the four retail buildings is La Maison Francaise (literally &quot;the French House&quot;) at 610 Fifth Avenue, which opened in October 1933. It is a six-story standalone building with a limestone facade with a sixth-story setback, as well as a partial -story penthouse on the west half of the seventh story and a garden on the east side of the seventh-story roof. Immediately across the Channel Gardens to the north of La Maison Francaise is its twin, the British Empire Building at 620 Fifth Avenue, which opened in April 1933. It is also a standalone building, with exactly the same massing asLa Maison Francaise, down to the setback, rooftop garden, and half-penthouse.

The International Building has the address 630 Fifth Avenue to its east, or 45 Rockefeller Plaza to its west. The tower stands at 41 stories high, including mechanical floors. One of two skyscrapers that opened in Manhattan in 1935, it was noted for its short 136-day duration of construction, as well as the construction quality, overall design, and materials used. The building, located in the middle of the block between Rockefeller Plaza and Fifth Avenue, contains a central plaza on its east, facing the Fifth Avenue entrance, which contains the famous statue of Atlas. The Palazzo d&#x27;Italia and International Building North serve as six-story retail wings of the International Building. The Palazzo d&#x27;Italia is at 626 Fifth Avenue, on the south side of the plaza, while International Building North is at 636 Fifth Avenue, north of the plaza.

====Other buildings====

The 36-story tower at 1 Rockefeller Plaza, on the east side of the plaza between 48th and 49th streets, is the original Time &amp; Life Building that was opened in April 1937. Time Inc. itself did not move into the building for another year after its completion. In 1960, the building was renamed for General Dynamics after Time Inc. had moved into 1271 Avenue of the Americas, the new Time-Life Building located three blocks away. The tower was renamed for its street address after General Dynamics moved to St. Louis in 1971.

10 Rockefeller Plaza is located opposite 1 Rockefeller, on the west side of the plaza. Its planning name was the Holland House, but the Dutch government did not sign on, so the building became the Eastern Air Lines Building instead. 10 Rockefeller was built as a 16-story slab, basically a miniature version of 1 Rockefeller. 10 Rockefeller&#x27;s six-story parking garage was the first in Rockefeller Center. Notable modern tenants include the &quot;Today Show&quot; studios, and since 2005, the Nintendo New York store.

50 Rockefeller Plaza, formerly the Associated Press Building, is located on the west side of Rockefeller Plaza between 50th and 51st streets. It was constructed in the spring of 1938. The only building in the Center built to the outer limits of its lot line, the 15-story building took its shape from Associated Press&#x27;s need for a single, undivided, loft-like newsroom as large as the lot could accommodate—namely, a blocky structure with no setbacks.

600 Fifth Avenue is located at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 48th Street and was built after the other buildings in the main complex, opening in 1952. The 28-story tower was once also known as the Sinclair Oil Building and the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company Building. Its L-shaped footprint surrounds another building at the corner of 49th Street and Fifth Avenue, such that it fronts on 48th Street, on Fifth Avenue, but only midblock on 49th Street. Carson and Lundin designed 600 Fifth Avenue, along with 666 Fifth Avenue three blocks north, to complement the Rockefeller complex between the two towers. 600 Fifth Avenue contains a limestone facade, consistent with that of the original complex, as well as a seventh-story setback on its Fifth Avenue side and rooftop gardens on its setbacks. The building contains a main lobby at 48th Street, a service entrance to the same street, and a connection to 1 Rockefeller Plaza at its west end. Unlike other buildings in the complex, 600 Fifth Avenue&#x27;s ground level only contained one public entrance to maximize the ground-floor retail space, which was originally leased by Swiss interests and Pan Am Airlines.

===Later buildings===

The buildings subsequently added are separately owned by multiple owners. The first subsequent building to be built was 75 Rockefeller Plaza, at 51st Street on the north end of the complex, was built in 1947. The building contains a low base that is level with the rooftops of the low-rise buildings on 51st and 52nd Street, as well as a tall slab rising from the base, aligned in a north–south direction. It was originally built privately, but ownership was transferred to Rockefeller Center in February 1947. The 33-story, building was originally called the Esso Building. It was the headquarters of Standard Oil Company of New Jersey (later Exxon) until the early 1970s. The Esso Building was later renamed after Warner Communications, Time Warner and AOL Time Warner. It is owned by the estate of Mohamed Al Fayed, who died in 2023, and managed by RXR Realty under a 99-year lease that began in 2013.

The other four buildings were built as part of a single project on the west side of Sixth Avenue between 47th and 51st streets. Erected from 1958 through 1974, they were all built by the same firm, Harrison, Abramovitz &amp; Harris. The $300 million project was part of a drive to get large companies such as Celanese Corporation, McGraw-Hill, Exxon, and Time Inc. to invest in the center. The new project added a combined of space to the existing center when it was completed, and was attractive to potential tenants because of this. Four buildings are part of the newer Sixth Avenue expansion:
* 1211 Avenue of the Americas, the former Celanese Building, is located between 47th and 48th streets. The tower opened in 1974. Now the News Corp Building, it is owned by an affiliate of Beacon Capital Partners, and leasing is managed by Cushman &amp; Wakefield.
* 1221 Avenue of the Americas, the former McGraw-Hill Building, is located between 48th and 49th streets. The building opened in 1973 and is owned by the Rockefeller Group.
* 1251 Avenue of the Americas, the former Exxon Building, is located between 49th and 50th streets. This building was built from 1967 to 1971. Exxon&#x27;s corporate headquarters moved into the structure in 1972, with co-ownership with Rockefeller Center&#x27;s managers, and held an ownership stake there until 1986, when Mitsui &amp; Company purchased the building. Exxon moved its headquarters to Texas in 1989, vacating all of the space in 1251 Avenue of the Americas.
* 1271 Avenue of the Americas, the former Time &amp; Life Building, is located between 50th and 51st streets. The building was completed in 1958 Construction on the Time-Life&#x27;s Building&#x27;s steelwork started in April 1958, and is owned by the Rockefeller Group.

==Other architectural elements==
===Lower Plaza===
At the front of 30 Rock is the Lower Plaza, located in the very center of the complex and below ground level. The center plaza was part of the plans for the canceled Metropolitan Opera House. Although the opera house was canceled in 1929, the plaza was retained in subsequent plans. Originally, the plaza would have been located at ground level with a promenade called Channel Gardens, which led westward from Fifth Avenue to the plaza. In the March 1931 revision to the complex&#x27;s blueprint, the center plaza was enhanced and sunken. The sunken plaza was originally supposed to be oval-shaped, but the plaza was later changed to a rectangular shape. The sunken rectangular plaza, planted with shrubs, provided a sense of privacy and enclosure when it was originally built.

The plaza&#x27;s main entrance is through the Channel Gardens, a , planted pedestrian esplanade running westward from Fifth Avenue between the British Empire Building and La Maison Francaise. The steeply sloping promenade was originally furnished with six narrow pools in the center of the space, each surrounded by hedges. The pools are topped with fountain heads designed by Rene Chambellan, each representing a different attribute: leadership, will, thought, imagination, energy, and alertness. Chambellan also designed the fountains&#x27; drain covers with various bronze depictions of sea creatures such as turtles and crabs. During the winter, the Channel Gardens&#x27; fountains were shut off and decorated with Valerie Clarebout&#x27;s sculptures of angels. The twelve sculptures, each measuring tall, have been placed in the gardens every winter since 1954. At the western end of the promenade is a plaque commemorating the original Elgin Gardens, as well as a bronze monumental plaque to John D. Rockefeller Jr (see below). From there, a flight of the steps descends toward the rink, then splits into two different stairs heading both north and south.

The western end of the plaza contains Paul Manship&#x27;s 1934 masterwork, &quot;Prometheus&quot;. The statue stands in a fountain basin in front of a grey rectangular wall. The Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree is placed above the statue from November to January every year; it is usually put in place and lit the week after Thanksgiving, and taken down the week after New Year&#x27;s Day. The first tree was erected in 1934, and as successive trees received more lavish decorations, the tradition gradually became known worldwide.

Much of the plaza&#x27;s outdoor section is occupied by an ice rink. Installed in 1936, it replaced unprofitable retail space that had been constructed as part of the original center. Originally intended as a &quot;temporary&quot; measure, the rink became an immediate tourist attraction upon opening, becoming one of the world&#x27;s most famous skating rinks in later years. In 1939, a permanent rink was installed, which necessitated the replacement of the center staircase from Channel Gardens. Its popularity inspired the construction of a skating rink in the former Center Theatre, and for a short time, there were also proposals to convert the lower plaza&#x27;s ice rink to a roller skating rink during the springtime.

The northern, southern, and eastern sides of the plaza are surrounded by a walkway that is several steps below street level, with staircases at either western end as well as at the plaza&#x27;s Channel Gardens entrance. Some 200 flagpoles surround the plaza&#x27;s perimeter at ground level, installed at regular intervals along the walkway and Rockefeller Plaza. The poles were installed in 1942 and were originally intended to be temporary. The flags later became permanent installations, fitting in with the nearby International Complex. The poles originally displayed the flags of the United Nations&#x27; member countries, although in later years they also carried flags of the U.S. states and territories, or decorative and seasonal motifs. Originally, there were 26 flags for each of the members of the United Nations, but as more countries became UN members, additional rows of poles were added on the north and south sides of the plaza. During national and state holidays, every pole carries the flag of the United States. The flags&#x27; ropes are secured with locks to prevent people from tampering with the flags.

In July 1962, two years after John Rockefeller Jr.&#x27;s death, the center&#x27;s management placed a plaque at the plaza, containing a list of ten principles in which he believed. The creed was first expressed in 1941. Rockefeller&#x27;s beliefs include &quot;the supreme worth of the individual and in his right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&quot; (the first principle) and &quot;truth and justice are fundamental to an enduring social order&quot; (the sixth principle).

The architect I. M. Pei praised Rockefeller Center&#x27;s lower plaza as being &quot;perhaps the most successful open space in the United States, perhaps in the world&quot;, due to its success in drawing visitors. The plaza has also inspired similar developments around the world.

===Rockefeller Plaza===

Rockefeller Plaza is a pedestrian street running through the complex, parallel to Fifth and Sixth avenues. This street was also part of the original plans for the Metropolitan Opera, and Benjamin Morris originally intended for the road to stretch from 42nd to 59th streets. Only the section between 48th and 51st streets was built, and the road was open in its entirety by 1937. The road was given the name &quot;Rockefeller Plaza&quot; in 1933, despite the potential confusion with the Lower Plaza, because it was believed that the &quot;Plaza&quot; in the road&#x27;s name would emphasize its &quot;spatial unity&quot; with the Lower Plaza and Channel Gardens. The original intention of the street&#x27;s construction was to enhance the shopping district of Fifth Avenue, to its east, but this never happened, and Rockefeller Plaza now primarily serves as a pedestrian passage that connects all of Rockefeller Center&#x27;s separate components.

As with most numbered crosstown streets in Manhattan, Rockefeller Plaza is wide with curbs on either side of an asphalt surface. However, the sidewalks are much wider than on typical streets. In addition, Rockefeller Plaza is supported by a multi-level steel skeleton underneath, which houses the underground mall, storage rooms, and the complex&#x27;s shipping and loading center. As such, it contains a layer of waterproofing. The surface of Rockefeller Plaza outside Radio City Music Hall, between 50th and 51st Street, contains small bronze circles for theatergoers to stand on while waiting to enter the hall. Until the 1980s, the plaza contained plaques that affirmed Columbia University&#x27;s ownership of Rockefeller Center, but these were removed with the 1985 sale of the complex to the Rockefeller Group. Since Rockefeller Plaza is technically a purely private property to which the public is welcome, the plaza is closed for part of one day every year.

===Rooftop gardens===

The gardens atop Rockefeller Center&#x27;s roofs were designed by Ralph Hancock and Raymond Hood. They came about because both Hood and Todd believed that rooftop gardens would enhance the complex&#x27;s beauty; in particular, Hood compared the presence of rooftop gardens to the plants around a house. Originally, the gardens were supposed to be all interconnected via bridges between the roofs of each building. However, after Hood&#x27;s death in 1935, the garden plan fell apart, as most of the complex&#x27;s final buildings were built without provisions for gardens. The Associated Press Building&#x27;s 15th-story roof, as well as the isolated location of the International Building and the high cost of these gardens, made this system infeasible. Ultimately, gardens were installed on 10 Rockefeller Plaza; 30 Rockefeller Plaza; the four International-themed retail buildings; the Center Theatre; and Radio City Music Hall. The gardens started running a $45,000-per-year deficit by 1937 due to various expenses as well as a lack of interest among tourists.

The largest and most grand of the gardens was the &quot;Garden of the Nations&quot; (alternatively &quot;Gardens of the Nations&quot;), which was installed on the eleventh-floor roof of 30 Rockefeller Plaza and opened in April 1935. The construction effort involved of soil; of rock from as far as England; 100,000 bricks; 2,000 trees and shrubs; 4,000 small plants; and 20,000 bulbs for flowers. They were originally composed of thirteen nation-specific gardens whose layouts were inspired by the gardens in the respective countries they represented. Each of the nation-themed gardens were separated by barriers. There was an &quot;International Garden&quot;, a rock garden, in the center of the thirteen nation-themed gardens, which featured a meandering stream and 2,000 plant varieties. The Garden of the Nations also contained a children&#x27;s garden, a modern-style garden, and a shrub-and-vegetable patch. Upon opening, the Garden of the Nations attracted many visitors because of its collection of exotic flora, and it became the most popular garden in Rockefeller Center. In its heyday, the Center charged admission fees for the Garden of the Nations. However, all of the nation-themed gardens were eventually removed, and the rock garden was left to dry up, supplanted by flower beds that were no longer open to the public.

The International complex&#x27;s gardens fared better. Hancock developed the British Empire Building and La Maison Francaise&#x27;s gardens, while A.M. van den Hoek designed the gardens atop the other two buildings. The British and French gardens both contain a lawn and pool surrounded by hedges, while the other two gardens atop the International Building&#x27;s wings include ivy lawns surrounded by hedges. The Italian garden also contained a cobblestone walkway and two plaques from the Roman Forum, while International Building North&#x27;s garden has a paved walkway with steps. The roof gardens of the International Building&#x27;s wings were restored in 1986 for $48,000 each, followed by the gardens on the British and French buildings, which were restored the next year.

In 2021, Tishman Speyer submitted proposals for a rooftop terrace on Radio City Music Hall, as well as a pedestrian bridge to 50 Rockefeller Plaza. These plans dated from an original proposal for the theater that was never carried out. The garden opened in September 2021 and is formally known as Radio Park. Designed by the firm of HMWhite, the slightly sloped garden includes birch trees, a set of bleachers, and various pathways.

===Underground concourse===
A series of shop-and-restaurant-filled pedestrian passages stretch underground from 47th to 51st streets between Fifth and Seventh avenues. The pedestrian tunnel system was part of the updated 1931 plan for the center, and formal proposals for the system were submitted in 1933. It was supposed to comprise a system that stretched over , all air-conditioned and lined with shops. Meanwhile, the pair of four-lane roadways was supposed to be located underneath the pedestrian mall, with delivery ramps leading to a central loading area below ground. Later plans also included a people mover.

Ultimately, the people mover was not built, but the 25-space mall opened in May 1935. The complex&#x27;s owner Tishman Speyer renovated the concourse in 1999 in an effort to make the underground retail space more noticeable and attract more upscale tenants. The original bronze ornaments and lighting were replaced, air-conditioning was installed, two passageways were demolished, and both ground-level and underground retail spaces were refurbished as part of the renovation.

The concourse is the uppermost level of the complex&#x27;s four basement levels, as well as the only basement level open to the public. The lower three levels are home to storage rooms and the complex&#x27;s shipping center, the latter of which is accessed by a delivery ramp at 50th Street. Access is via lobby stairways in the six landmark buildings, through restaurants surrounding the concourse-level skating rink, and via elevators to the north and south of the rink. There is also a connection to the New York City Subway&#x27;s 47th–50th Streets–Rockefeller Center station, serving the . , the largest retailer in the concourse is Banana Republic.

===Pre-existing buildings===
Two small buildings abut the north and south corners of the 30 Rockefeller Plaza annex. These buildings exist as a result of two tenants who refused to sell their rights to Rockefeller during construction. The grocer John F. Maxwell would only sell his property at Sixth Avenue and 50th Street if he received $1 million in return. However, Rockefeller&#x27;s assistant Charles O. Heydt mistakenly said that Maxwell would never sell, and Maxwell himself said that he had never been approached by the Rockefellers. Consequently, Rockefeller Center did not purchase Maxwell&#x27;s property until 1970. Maxwell&#x27;s demand paled to that of Daniel Hurley and Patrick Daly, owners of a speakeasy who, since 1892, had leased a property at 49th Street. They would sell for $250 million, roughly the cost of the entire complex. They initially gained a lease extension until 1942, but ended up leasing their property until 1975, and was built around Maxwell&#x27;s and Hurley and Daly&#x27;s properties.

On the southeast corner of the complex, on Fifth Avenue between 48th and 49th streets, there were also two pre-existing buildings. Robert Walton Goelet owned a lot at 2–6 West 49th Street and wished to develop it; the lot was developed as 608 Fifth Avenue, which was completed in 1932. The St. Nicholas Church, located on 48th Street behind Goelet&#x27;s land, also refused to sell the property despite an offer of up to $7 million for the property. The church was razed in 1949 to make way for 600 Fifth Avenue.

==Art==

In November 1931, John Todd suggested the creation of a program for placing distinctive artworks within each of the buildings. Hartley Burr Alexander, a noted mythology and symbology professor, was tasked with planning the complex&#x27;s arts installations. Alexander submitted his plan for the site&#x27;s artwork in December 1932. As part of the proposal, the complex would have a variety of sculptures, statues, murals, friezes, decorative fountains, and mosaics. In an expansion of Hood&#x27;s setback-garden plan, Alexander&#x27;s proposal also included rooftop gardens atop all the buildings, which would create a &quot;Babylonian garden&quot; when viewed from above.

At first, Alexander suggested &quot;Homo Fabor, Man the Builder&quot; as the complex&#x27;s overarching theme, representing satisfaction with one&#x27;s occupation rather than with the wage. However, that theme was not particularly well received by the architects, so Alexander proposed another theme, the &quot;New Frontiers&quot;; this theme dealt with social and scientific innovations and represented the challenges that humanity faced &quot;after the conquest of the physical world&quot;. In theory, this was considered a fitting theme, but Alexander had been so specific about the details of the necessary artworks that it limited the creative license for any artists who would be commissioned for such works, so he was fired. It took several tries to agree on the current theme, &quot;The March of Civilization&quot;, at which point some of the art had already been commissioned, including those which Alexander had proposed.

The art that currently exists within Rockefeller Center was inspired by Professor Alexander&#x27;s arts program. Sculptor Lee Lawrie contributed the largest number of individual pieces – twelve, including the &quot;Atlas&quot; statue facing Fifth Avenue and the conspicuous friezes of Wisdom above the main entrance to 30 Rockefeller Plaza. Edward Trumbull coordinated the colors of the works located inside the buildings, and Léon-Victor Solon did the same job for the exterior pieces. Isamu Noguchi&#x27;s gleaming stainless steel bas-relief, &quot;News&quot;, over the main entrance to 50 Rockefeller Plaza (the Associated Press Building) was, at the time of commissioning, the largest metal bas-relief in the world. The complex&#x27;s other sculptors included Rene Chambellan, Leo Friedlander, Robert Garrison, Alfred Janniot, Carl Paul Jennewein, Gaston Lachaise, Leo Lentelli, Paul Manship, Giacomo Manzù, Hildreth Meiere, and Attilio Piccirilli. Other artists included Carl Milles, Margaret Bourke-White, and Dean Cornwell, who executed the mural &quot;The History of Transportation&quot; in the lobby of the Eastern Airlines building (today 10 Rockefeller Plaza). Radio City Music Hall architect Donald Deskey commissioned many Depression-era artists to design works for the interior of the hall, including Stuart Davis&#x27;s 1932 mural &quot;Men Without Women&quot;, named after the short story collection by Ernest Hemingway that had been published the same year. One of the center&#x27;s more controversial works was &quot;Man at the Crossroads&quot;, created by Diego Rivera, which was originally commissioned for 30 Rockefeller Plaza&#x27;s lobby but was demolished before it could be completed.

===Statues===
====&quot;Atlas&quot;====

Commissioned in 1936 and executed by Lee Lawrie and Rene Chambellan, the &quot;Atlas&quot; statue is located in the International Building&#x27;s courtyard. It faces eastward toward St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral on Fifth Avenue. The statue depicts Atlas the titan, with exaggerated muscles, supporting the celestial vault on his shoulders.

==== &quot;Prometheus&quot; ====
Paul Manship&#x27;s highly recognizable bronze gilded &quot;Prometheus&quot; statue, commissioned in 1934, is located at the western end of the sunken plaza. It stands high and weighs . The statue depicts the Greek legend of the Titan Prometheus recumbent, bringing fire to mankind. The statue is flanked by two smaller gilded representations of Youth and Maiden, which were relocated to Palazzo d&#x27;Italia from 1939 to 1984 because Manship thought the representations did not fit visually. The model for Prometheus was Leonardo (Leon) Nole, and the inscription, a paraphrase from Aeschylus, on the granite wall behind, reads: &quot;Prometheus, teacher in every art, brought the fire that hath proved to mortals a means to mighty ends.&quot;

===&quot;Man at the Crossroads&quot;===
In 1932, the Mexican socialist artist Diego Rivera (whose sponsor was the Museum of Modern Art and whose patron at the time was Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, the wife of John D. Rockefeller, Jr.), was commissioned by their son Nelson to create a color fresco for the wall in the lobby of the then-RCA Building. This came after Nelson had been unable to secure the commissioning of either Matisse or Picasso. Previously Rivera had painted a controversial fresco in Detroit titled &quot;Detroit Industry&quot;, commissioned by Abby and John&#x27;s friend, Edsel Ford, who later became a trustee of the Museum of Modern Art.

As expected, his &quot;Man at the Crossroads&quot; became controversial, as it contained Moscow May Day scenes and a clear portrait of Lenin, which had not been apparent in initial sketches. After Nelson issued a written warning to Rivera to replace the offending figure with an anonymous face, Rivera refused (after offering to counterbalance Lenin with a portrait of Lincoln). As per Nelson&#x27;s orders, Rivera was paid for his commission and the mural was papered over. Nine months later, after all attempts to save the fresco were explored—including relocating it to Abby&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art—it was destroyed as a last option. (Rivera would later partially recreate the work as &quot;Man, Controller of the Universe&quot;, using photographs taken by an assistant, Lucienne Bloch.) Rivera&#x27;s fresco in the center was replaced with a larger mural by the Catalan artist Josep Maria Sert, titled &quot;American Progress&quot;, depicting a vast allegorical scene of men constructing modern America. Containing figures of Abraham Lincoln, Mahatma Gandhi, and Ralph Waldo Emerson, it wraps around the west wall of 30 Rockefeller Plaza&#x27;s Grand Lobby.

==Reception==
===Contemporary commentary===
In its earliest years, Rockefeller Center received largely negative and pessimistic reviews from architectural critics. The most cynical opinion came from architectural scholar Lewis Mumford, who so hated the &quot;weakly conceived, reckless, romantic chaos&quot; of the March 1931 plans for Rockefeller Center that he reportedly went into exile in upstate New York. He blamed John Rockefeller Jr. for the complex&#x27;s &quot;inability to consider a new type of problem in any form except the skyscraper stereotype&quot;. Mumford&#x27;s view of the complex was only marginally less negative when he revisited the issue in December 1933: he said that it could be &quot;large, exciting, [and] romantic&quot; at night, but that &quot;a mountain or ash heap of the same size would do the trick almost as well, if the lights were cleverly arranged&quot;. Ralph Adams Cram, who adhered to a more classical architectural style, also had a pessimistic view of the plans unveiled in March 1931. He called the plan for Rockefeller Center &quot;an apotheosis of megalomania, a defiant egotism&quot; arising from an ostentatious display of wealth, and said that &quot;the sooner we accomplish the destiny it so perfectly foreshadows, the sooner we shall be able to clear the ground and begin again&quot;. Douglas Haskell, who formerly edited &quot;Architectural Forum&quot; magazine, wrote that Rockefeller Center&#x27;s ambiance was &quot;gray, unreal, baleful&quot;.

The urban planner Le Corbusier had a more optimistic view of the complex, expressing that Rockefeller Center was &quot;rational, logically conceived, biologically normal, [and] harmonious&quot;. He wrote that although Rockefeller Center would inevitably be disorganized in its earliest years, it would eventually adhere to a certain &quot;order&quot;, and he also praised the complex for being a paragon of &quot;noble&quot; and &quot;efficient&quot; construction. The writer Frederick Lewis Allen took a more moderate viewpoint, saying that negative critics had &quot;hoped for too much&quot; precisely because Rockefeller Center had been planned during an economically prosperous time, but was constructed during the Depression. Even though Allen thought that the art was mediocre and the opportunities for a less lively complex were wasted, he stated that Rockefeller Center had an aura of &quot;festivity&quot; around it, unlike most other office buildings in America. Sigfried Giedion wrote in his book &quot;Space, Time and Architecture&quot; that Rockefeller Center&#x27;s design was akin to a &quot;civic center&quot; whose design represented the 1930s version of the future. Henry Luce, the founder of Time Inc., said in 1941 that Rockefeller Center represented &quot;the true world of tomorrow&quot;, as opposed to the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair, whose &quot;World of Tomorrow&quot; representations &quot;are today junk piles under the winter snow&quot;. Novelist Gertrude Stein said in 1935, &quot;The view of Rockefeller Center from Fifth Avenue is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.&quot;

===Retrospective commentary and impact===
By the 1940s, most critics had positive views of Rockefeller Center. Even Mumford praised the complex, lamenting in 1947 that the new headquarters of the United Nations on First Avenue had no &quot;human scale&quot; or &quot;transition from the intimate to the monumental&quot;, whereas Rockefeller Center&#x27;s buildings &quot;produce an aesthetic effect out of all proportion to their size&quot;. Haskell wrote in 1966 that Rockefeller Center&#x27;s designers &quot;seemed to have regarded urban life as an enhanceable romance&quot;. In 1969, the art historian Vincent Scully wrote, &quot;Rockefeller Center is one of the few surviving public spaces that look as if they were designed and used by people who knew what stable wealth was and were not ashamed to enjoy it.&quot;

The New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation commissioned a report in 1974 titled &quot;Grand Central Terminal and Rockefeller Center: A Historic-Critical Estimate of Their Significance&quot;, in which they concluded that Rockefeller Center, along with Central Park and Grand Central Terminal, were the only three developments that could slow down Manhattan&#x27;s &quot;remorseless process of expansion and decay&quot;. In 1976, &quot;New York Times&quot; architectural critic Paul Goldberger wrote, &quot;What makes Rockefeller Center work is that it is at once a formal Beaux‐Arts‐influenced complex of dignified towers and a lively, utterly contemporary amalgam of shops, plazas and street life. It is as natural a home for a 1970&#x27;s street festival as for a 1930&#x27;s movie about cafe society: few designs can join such disparate worlds so comfortably.&quot; The American Institute of Architects&#x27; 2007 survey &quot;List of America&#x27;s Favorite Architecture&quot; ranked the Rockefeller Center complex among the top 150 buildings in the United States.

Several later buildings were inspired by Rockefeller Center and its constituent buildings. 525 William Penn Place in Pittsburgh, also designed by Harrison &amp; Abramovitz, includes limestone piers and steel fins that were inspired by 30 Rockefeller Plaza&#x27;s design. In the 1960s, David Rockefeller developed the Embarcadero Center in San Francisco, which was nicknamed &quot;Rockefeller Center West&quot;. Postmodern skyscrapers based on Rockefeller Center include the NBC Tower in Chicago and the Wells Fargo Center in Minneapolis.

<text>Sylvester Stewart (born March 15, 1943), better known by his stage name Sly Stone, is an American musician, songwriter, and record producer who is most famous for his role as frontman for Sly and the Family Stone, playing a critical role in the development of funk with his pioneering fusion of soul, rock, psychedelia and gospel in the 1960s and 1970s. AllMusic stated that &quot;James Brown may have invented funk, but Sly Stone perfected it,&quot; and credited him with &quot;creating a series of euphoric yet politically charged records that proved a massive influence on artists of all musical and cultural backgrounds.&quot; &quot;Crawdaddy!&quot; has credited him as the founder of the &quot;progressive soul&quot; movement.

Born in Texas and raised in the Bay Area city Vallejo in Northern California, Stone mastered several instruments at an early age and performed gospel music as a child with his siblings (and future bandmates) Freddie and Rose. In the mid-1960s, he worked as both a record producer for Autumn Records and a disc jockey for San Francisco radio station KDIA. In 1966, Stone and his brother Freddie joined their bands together to form Sly and the Family Stone, a racially integrated, mixed-gender act. The group would score hits including &quot;Dance to the Music&quot; (1968), &quot;Everyday People&quot; (1968), &quot;Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)&quot; (1969), &quot;I Want to Take You Higher&quot; (1969) &quot;Family Affair&quot; (1971) and &quot;If You Want Me to Stay&quot; (1973) and acclaimed albums including &quot;Stand!&quot; (1969), &quot;There&#x27;s a Riot Goin&#x27; On&quot; (1971) and &quot;Fresh&quot; (1973).

By the mid-1970s, Stone&#x27;s drug use and erratic behavior effectively ended the group, leaving him to record several unsuccessful solo albums. He toured or collaborated with artists such as Parliament-Funkadelic, Bobby Womack, and Jesse Johnson. In 1993, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the group. He took part in a Sly and the Family Stone tribute at the 2006 Grammy Awards, his first live performance since 1987. He released the autobiography &quot;Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)&quot; in 2023.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Stone was born in Denton, Texas, on March 15, 1943, before the family’s move to Vallejo, California, in the North Bay of the San Francisco Bay Area. He was the second of five children born to K.C. and Alpha Stewart, a deeply religious couple. As part of the doctrines of the Church of God in Christ (COGIC), to which the Stewart family belonged, the parents encouraged musical expression in their middle-class household. Sylvester and his brother Freddie, along with their sisters Rose and Loretta, formed &quot;the Stewart Four&quot; as children, performing gospel music in church. They recorded and locally released a 78 rpm single, &quot;On the Battlefield&quot; b/w &quot;Walking in Jesus&#x27; Name&quot;, in August 1956. Only their eldest sister Loretta did not pursue a musical career; the others, including youngest sister Vaetta or &quot;Vet&quot;, would later adopt the surname &quot;Stone&quot; and pursue musical interests.

Sylvester was identified as a musical prodigy. By the time he was seven, he had already become proficient on the keyboards, and by the age of eleven, he had mastered the guitar, bass, and drums as well. While still in high school, Sylvester had settled primarily on the guitar and joined a number of high school bands. One of these was the Viscaynes, a doo-wop group in which Sylvester and his friend Frank Arellano—who was Filipino—were the only non-white members. The fact that the group was integrated made the Viscaynes &quot;hip&quot; in the eyes of their audiences, and would later inspire Sylvester&#x27;s idea of the multicultural Family Stone. The Viscaynes released a few local singles, including &quot;Yellow Moon&quot; and &quot;Stop What You Are&quot;; during the same period, Sylvester also recorded a few solo singles under the name Danny Stewart. With his brother, Fred, he formed several short-lived groups, like the Stewart Bros. After high school Stone studied music at the Vallejo campus of Solano Community College.

The nickname Sly was a common one for Sylvester throughout his years in grade school. Early on, a classmate misspelled his name &quot;Slyvester,&quot; and ever since, the nickname followed him.

In the mid-1960s, Stone worked as a disc jockey for San Francisco, California, soul radio station KSOL, where he included white performers such as The Beatles and The Rolling Stones in his playlists. During the same period, he worked as a staff record producer for Autumn Records, producing for predominantly white San Francisco-area bands such as The Beau Brummels, The Mojo Men, Bobby Freeman, and Grace Slick&#x27;s first band, The Great Society.

Stone was influential in guiding KSOL-AM into soul music and started calling the station K-SOUL. The second was a popular soul music station (sans the K-SOUL moniker), at 107.7 FM (now known as KSAN). The current KSOL has a different format and is unrelated to the previous two stations. While still providing &quot;music for your mind, body, and your soul&quot; on KSOL, Sly Stone played keyboard for dozens of major performers including Dionne Warwick, Righteous Brothers, Ronettes, Bobby Freeman, George &amp; Teddy, Freddy Cannon, Marvin Gaye, Dick &amp; Dee Dee, Jan &amp; Dean, Gene Chandler, and many more, including at least one of the three Twist Party concerts by then chart topper Chubby Checker held at the Cow Palace in San Francisco in 1962 and 1963. The concerts were put together by &quot;Big Daddy&quot; Tom Donohue and Bobby Mitchell from the then infamous KYA 1260 AM radio station and largely choreographed by Jerry Marcellino and Mel Larson who went on to produce many Motown artists including Michael Jackson, Diana Ross, and some of the top artists of the day.

In 1966, Sly was performing with his band Sly and The Stoners which included Cynthia Robinson on trumpet. His brother Freddie was working with his band called Freddie and the Stone Souls with Greg Errico and Jerry Martini. One night, the two stood in a kitchen making the decision to fuse the bands together adding Larry Graham, who had studied music and worked in numerous groups. Working around the Bay Area in 1967, this multiracial band made a strong impression. Later, in 1968, Rose Stone joined the band.

===Sly and the Family Stone&#x27;s success===

After a mildly received debut album, &quot;A Whole New Thing&quot; (1967), Sly &amp; The Family Stone had their first hit single with &quot;Dance to the Music&quot;, which was later included on an album of the same name (1968). Although their third album, &quot;Life&quot; (also 1968), also suffered from low sales, their fourth album, &quot;Stand!&quot; (1969), became a runaway success, selling over three million copies and spawning a number one hit single, &quot;Everyday People&quot;. By the summer of 1969, Sly &amp; The Family Stone were one of the biggest names in music, releasing two more top five singles, &quot;Hot Fun in the Summertime&quot; and &quot;Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)&quot;/&quot;Everybody Is a Star&quot;, before the end of the year and appearing at Woodstock. During the summer of 1969, Sly and the Family Stone also performed at the Summer of Soul concerts in Harlem and received an enthusiastic response from the large crowd.

After the group began touring following the success of &quot;Dance to the Music&quot;, The Family Stone drew praise for their explosive live show, which attracted black and white fans in equal measure. When Bob Marley first played in the U.S. in 1973 with his band The Wailers, he opened on tour for Sly and The Family Stone.

===Stone Flower Productions===
Along with David Kapralik who brought Sly &amp; the Family Stone to Epic records, he co-formed Stone Flower Productions, a company that was jointly owned by both of them. They appointed Steve Topley formerly of Epic Records and Hanna -Barbera Records as their vice-president in charge of Sales and Promotion.

The label that had material produced by the company, Stone Flower Records had their records distributed by Atlantic Records.

===Personal problems===
With the band&#x27;s newfound fame and success came numerous problems. Relationships within the band were deteriorating; there was friction in particular between the Stone brothers and Larry Graham. Epic requested more marketable output. The Black Panther Party demanded that Stone make his music more militant and more reflective of the black power movement, replace Greg Errico and Jerry Martini with black instrumentalists, and replace manager David Kapralik.

After moving to the Los Angeles area in fall 1969, Stone and his bandmates became heavy users of illegal drugs, primarily cocaine and PCP. As the members became increasingly focused on drug use and partying (Stone carried a violin case filled with illegal drugs wherever he went), recording slowed significantly. Between summer 1969 and fall 1971, the band released only one single, &quot;Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)&quot;/&quot;Everybody Is a Star&quot;, in December 1969. This song was one of the first recordings to employ the heavy, funky beats that would be featured in the funk music of the following decade. It showcased bass player Larry Graham&#x27;s innovative percussive playing technique of bass &quot;slapping&quot;. Graham later said that he developed this technique in an earlier band in order to compensate for that band&#x27;s lack of a drummer.

&quot;Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)&quot; hit the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in early 1970. The single also peaked at No. 5 on the R&amp;B chart, selling over a million copies.

Having relocated to Los Angeles with his girlfriend Deborah King, later Deborah Santana (wife of Carlos Santana from 1973 until filing for divorce in 2007), Stone&#x27;s behavior became increasingly erratic. Epic was anticipating new material in 1970, but with none forthcoming, finally released &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; that November. One year later, the band&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;There&#x27;s a Riot Goin&#x27; On&quot;, was released. &quot;Riot&quot; featured a much darker sound, and most tracks were recorded with overdubbing as opposed to the Family Stone all playing at the same time as they had done previously. Stone played most of the parts himself and performed more of the lead vocals than usual. This was one of the first major label albums to feature a drum machine.

The band&#x27;s cohesion slowly began to erode, and its sales and popularity began to decline as well. Errico withdrew from the group in 1971 and was eventually replaced with Andy Newmark. Larry Graham and Stone were no longer on friendly terms, and Graham was fired in early 1972 and replaced with Rustee Allen. The band&#x27;s later releases, &quot;Fresh&quot; (1973) and &quot;Small Talk&quot; (1974), featured even less of the band and more of Stone.

Live bookings for Sly &amp; the Family Stone had steadily dropped since 1970, because promoters were afraid that Stone or one of the band members might miss the gig, refuse to play, or pass out from drug use. These issues were regular occurrences for the band during the 1970s, and had an adverse effect on their ability to demand money for live bookings. In 1970, 26 of 80 concerts were cancelled, and numerous others started late. At many of these gigs, concertgoers rioted if the band failed to show up, or if Stone walked out before finishing his set. Ken Roberts became the group&#x27;s promoter, and later their general manager, when no other representatives would work with the band because of their erratic gig attendance record. In January 1975, the band booked itself at Radio City Music Hall in New York. The famed music hall was only one-eighth occupied, and Stone and company had to scrape together money to return home. Following the Radio City engagement, the band was dissolved.

Rose Stone was pulled out of the band by Bubba Banks, who was by then her husband. She began a solo career, recording a Motown-style album under the name Rose Banks in 1976. Freddie Stone joined Larry Graham&#x27;s group, Graham Central Station, for a time; after collaborating with his brother one last time in 1979 for &quot;Back on the Right Track&quot;, he retired from the music industry and eventually became the pastor of the Evangelist Temple Fellowship Center in Vallejo, California. Background vocalist trio Little Sister was also dissolved; Mary McCreary married Leon Russell and released recordings on Russell&#x27;s Shelter Records label. Andy Newmark became a successful session drummer, playing with John Lennon, Roxy Music, B. B. King, Steve Winwood and others.

===Later years===
Stone went on to record four more albums as a solo artist (only &quot;High on You&quot; (1975) was released under just his name; the other three were released under the &quot;Sly &amp; The Family Stone&quot; name). In 1976, Stone assembled a new Family Stone and released &quot;Heard Ya Missed Me, Well I&#x27;m Back&quot;. 1979&#x27;s &quot;Back on the Right Track&quot; followed, and in 1982 &quot;Ain&#x27;t But the One Way&quot; was released, which began as a collaborative album with George Clinton, but was scrapped and later completed by producer Stewart Levine for release. None of these later albums achieved much success.

Stone also collaborated with Funkadelic on &quot;The Electric Spanking of War Babies&quot; (1981), but was unable to reinvigorate his career. In the early 1980s Sly Stone was also part of a George Clinton/Funkadelic family project with Muruga Booker called &quot;The Soda Jerks,&quot; who recorded an album worth of material, of which only one song has been released. However, Muruga still has plans to release the material from the project.

In June 1983, Stone was arrested and charged with cocaine possession in Fort Myers, Florida. He served 3 years probation, and was then jailed again for violating parole.

Stone managed to do a short tour with Bobby Womack in the summer of 1984, and he continued to make sporadic appearances on compilations and other artists&#x27; records. In 1986, Stone was featured on a track from Jesse Johnson&#x27;s album &quot;Shockadelica&quot; called &quot;Crazay&quot;. The music video featured Stone on keyboards and vocals, and received some airplay on the BET music network.

In 1986, Stone released a single, &quot;Eek-ah-Bo Static Automatic&quot;, from the &quot;Soul Man&quot; soundtrack, and the song &quot;I&#x27;m the Burglar&quot; from the &quot;Burglar&quot; soundtrack. He also co-wrote and co-produced &quot;Just Like A Teeter-Totter,&quot; which appeared on a Bar-Kays album from 1989.
From 1988 to 1989 Sly Stone wrote and produced a collection of unreleased recordings in his home studio in New Jersey. &quot;Coming Back for More&quot; and &quot;Just Like A Teeter-Totter&quot; are a part of that collection of about 20 songs.

In 1990, he gave an energetic vocal performance on the Earth, Wind &amp; Fire song, &quot;Good Time.&quot; In 1991, he appeared on a cover of &quot;Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)&quot; performed by the Japanese band 13CATS, and shared lead vocals with Bobby Womack on &quot;When the Weekend Comes&quot; from Womack&#x27;s 1993 album &quot;I Still Love You&quot;.

In 1992, Sly and the Family Stone appeared on the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s dance compilation album, &quot;Red Hot + Dance&quot;, contributing an original track, &quot;Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin) (Todds CD Mix).&quot; The album attempted to raise awareness and money in support of the AIDS epidemic, and all proceeds were donated to AIDS charities.

In 1995, ex-landlord Chase Mellon III accused Stone of trashing the Beverly Hills mansion Mellon rented to him in 1993. Mellon says that he found bathrooms smeared with gold paint, marble floors blackened, windows broken and a gaunt Stone emerging from a guest house to say, &quot;You’re spying on me.&quot; Sly Jr., then studying to be a recording engineer, told &quot;People&quot;, &quot;Nobody purposely destroyed the house. I’d thrown parties. My dad had a few get-togethers. We weren&#x27;t aware of the damage.&quot; The damage, however, was not just superficial. &quot;Sly never grew out of drugs,&quot; says ex-wife Silva. &quot;He lost his backbone and destroyed his future.&quot;

His last major public appearance until 2006 was during the 1993 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony where Stone showed up onstage to be entered into the Hall of Fame along with the Family Stone. In 2003, the other six members of the original Family Stone entered the studio to record a new album. Stone was invited to participate, but declined.

&quot;I feel like Sly just doesn&#x27;t wanna deal with it no more,&quot; Bootsy Collins told &quot;Mojo&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s like he&#x27;s had it – it ain&#x27;t no fun no more. It&#x27;s a curse and a blessing. The curse part of it is the business you have to deal with, and then the blessing part is you get to be a musician and have fun….&quot;

A few home-studio recordings (most likely from the late 1980s) with Stone&#x27;s voice and keyboards over a drum machine have made their way onto a bootleg. One Stone-penned demo called &quot;Coming Back for More&quot; appears to be autobiographical and includes the verse: &quot;Been so high, I touched the sky and the sky says &#x27;Sly, why you tryin&#x27; to get by?&#x27;&quot; His son, Sylvester Stewart Jr., told &quot;People Magazine&quot; in 1997 that his father had composed an album&#x27;s worth of material, including a tribute to Miles Davis called &quot;Miles and Miles.&quot;

On August 15, 2005, Stone drove his younger sister Vet Stone on his motorcycle to Los Angeles&#x27; Knitting Factory, where Vet was performing with her Sly &amp; the Family Stone tribute band, the Phunk Phamily Affair. Stone kept his helmet on during the entire performance, and was described by one concertgoer as looking a little like Bootsy Collins. A film crew doing a documentary on Sly &amp; the Family Stone, later released as &quot;On the Sly: In Search of the Family Stone&quot;, was at the show and captured this rare sighting on film. Stone, according to his web site, is producing and writing material for the group&#x27;s new album. In addition, Stone renamed the group &quot;Family Stone.&quot;

In 2009, the documentary film &quot;Coming Back for More&quot; detailed his dire financial situation. On August 18, 2009, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that the forthcoming documentary, &quot;Coming Back for More&quot; by Dutch director Willem Alkema, claims Stone is homeless and living off welfare while staying in cheap hotels and a camper van. The film alleges that Stone&#x27;s former manager, Jerry Goldstein, cut off his access to royalty payments following a dispute over a &#x27;debt agreement&#x27;, forcing Stone to depend on welfare payments. On September 25, 2011, Alkema wrote in the &quot;New York Post&quot; that Sly Stone was homeless and living out of a white camper-van in Los Angeles: &quot;The van is parked on a residential street in Crenshaw, the rough Los Angeles neighborhood where &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot; was set. A retired couple makes sure he eats once a day, and Stone showers at their house.&quot;

Stone had filed suit against Goldstein for $50 million in January 2010, accusing Goldstein of cheating him out of years&#x27; worth of royalty payments for the songs he had written. He testified that he had not been paid any royalties between 1989 and 2009. The litigation further claimed that Goldstein had used fraudulent practices to convince him to give up the rights to his songs, and made the same claim about the Sly and the Family Stone trademark. Goldstein filed a countersuit for slander following a rant by Stone at the Coachella Festival. In January 2015, a Los Angeles jury ruled in favor of Stone, awarding him $5 million. However, in December 2015, the award was overturned when an appellate court ruled that the trial judge had not told the jury to take into account the fact that Stone had assigned his royalties to a production company in exchange for a 50% ownership stake. In May 2016, Stone&#x27;s attorneys appealed that decision.

===Mid-2000s tributes===
A Sly and the Family Stone tribute took place at the 2006 Grammy Awards on February 8, 2006, at which Stone gave his first live musical performance since 1987. Sly and the original Family Stone lineup (minus Larry Graham) performed briefly during a tribute to the band, for which the headliners included Steven Tyler, John Legend, Van Hunt, Nile Rodgers and Robert Randolph. Sporting an enormous blonde mohawk, thick sunglasses, a &quot;Sly&quot; beltbuckle and a silver lamé suit, he joined in on &quot;I Want To Take You Higher.&quot; Hunched over the keyboards, he wore a cast on his right hand (the result of a recent motorcycle mishap), and a hunched back caused him to look down through most of the performance. His voice, though strong, was barely audible over the production. Stone walked to the front of the stage toward the end of the performance, sang a verse, and then, with a wave to the audience, sauntered offstage before the song was over. &quot;He went up the ramp [outside the theater], got on a motorcycle and took off,&quot; Ken Ehrlich, executive producer of the Grammy Awards show, told the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;. Ehrlich also said that Stone had refused to leave his hotel room until he was given a police escort to the show and then waited in his car until the performance began.

A Sly and the Family Stone tribute album, &quot;Different Strokes by Different Folks&quot;, was released on July 12, 2005, by Starbucks&#x27; Hear Music label, and on February 7, 2006, by Epic Records. The project features both cover versions of the band&#x27;s songs and songs which sample the original recordings. Among the artists for the set are The Roots (&quot;Star&quot;, which samples &quot;Everybody is a Star&quot;), Maroon 5 and Ciara (&quot;Everyday People&quot;), John Legend, Joss Stone and Van Hunt (&quot;Family Affair&quot;), The Black Eyed Peas&#x27; will.i.am (&quot;Dance to the Music&quot;), and Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, and Robert Randolph (&quot;I Want to Take You Higher&quot;). Epic Records&#x27; version of the tribute album, which included two additional covers (&quot;Don&#x27;t Call Me Nigger, Whitey&quot; and &quot;Thank You (Falletinme Be Mice Elf Agin)&quot;) was released in January 2006.

===Re-emergence===
On Sunday, January 14, 2007, Stone made a short guest appearance at a show of The New Family Stone band he supported at the House of Blues.

On April 1, 2007, Stone appeared with the Family Stone at the Flamingo Las Vegas Showroom, after George Wallace&#x27;s standup act.

On July 7, 2007, Stone made a short appearance with the Family Stone at the San Jose Summerfest. He sang &quot;Sing a Simple Song&quot; and &quot;If You Want Me to Stay,&quot; and walked off stage before the end of &quot;Higher&quot;. Stone cut the set short, in part, because the band began their set over 90 minutes late and had to finish before a certain time. While many blamed Stone for this incident, others believed that the promoter was at fault.

A similar scene took place at the Montreux Jazz Festival on July 13, 2007, with over half the sold-out venue walking out in disgust before his stage exit. A day later at the Blue Note Records Festival in Ghent, Belgium, he left the stage after telling the audience that when waking up that morning he realized he was old, and so he needed to take a break now. He repeated this behavior the day after that while performing at the North Sea Jazz Festival.
As the tour progressed, however, Stone seemed to be more confident and animated, often dancing and engaging the audience. He performed &quot;Stand&quot;, &quot;I Want To Take You Higher&quot;, &quot;Sing A Simple Song&quot;, &quot;If You Want Me To Stay&quot;, and &quot;Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)&quot;, which at one point morphed into &quot;Thank you For Talkin&#x27; To Me Africa&quot;, a track rarely performed in public. But the show was marred by sound problems and the vocals were barely audible through much of the show.

On October 17, 2008, Sly played with the Family Stone at the Wells Fargo Center for the Arts in Santa Rosa, California. He played a 22-minute set and ventured offstage, telling the crowd &quot;I gotta go take a piss. I&#x27;ll be right back.&quot; He never returned.
On Memorial Day, May 25, 2009, Stone re-emerged once again, granting an hour-long interview with KCRW-FM, a Los Angeles NPR affiliate, to discuss his life and career.

On Labor Day, September 7, 2009, Stone appeared at the 20th annual African Festival of the Arts in Chicago, Illinois. He contributed a 15-minute set during George Clinton&#x27;s show in which he performed his popular hits along with Clinton&#x27;s band. He left immediately after his short performance.

On December 6, 2009, Stone signed a new recording contract with the LA-based Cleopatra Records and on August 16, 2011, &quot;I&#x27;m Back! Family &amp; Friends&quot; was released, his first album since 1982&#x27;s &quot;Ain&#x27;t But the One Way&quot;. The album features re-recorded versions of Sly &amp; the Family Stone hits with guest appearances from Jeff Beck, Ray Manzarek, Bootsy Collins, Ann Wilson, Carmine Appice and Johnny Winter, as well as three previously unreleased songs.

Stone has appeared in later years with George Clinton and performed with his daughter Novena&#x27;s band, Baby Stone.

In January 2015, Sly Stone, along with four of his bandmates, appeared at a convention dedicated to honoring the band and its legacy. Called LOVE CITY CONVENTION, it occurred in Oakland at the Den Lounge inside the Fox Oakland Theater. Sly was in good spirits, answered questions from fans, and signed autographs.

In October 2023, Stone&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)&quot; was published. In December 2023, a single titled &quot;Santa Claus Is Coming To Town (2023 Mix)&quot; was released by Cleopatra Records.

== Film and television ==
Greg Zola made a documentary about Sly Stone, &quot;Small Talk About Sly&quot;. It was begun on, or prior to 2006. It was completed prior to 2017. It has been described in Ellen Exner&#x27;s book, &quot;Bach Perspectives, Volume 13 Bach Reworked&quot; as a series of interviews about the musical background and contributions of Sly Stone. It is viewable in sections.

Michael Rubenstone&#x27;s &quot;On the Sly: In Search of the Family Stone&quot; was released in 2017. In the film, Rubenstone travels across the United States in a bid to track down those who were involved with Sly Stone. The film played at the Slamdance Film Festival.

The documentary &quot;Sly Lives! (aka the Burden of Black Genius)&quot; by Ahmir &quot;Questlove&quot; Thompson was released in 2025. It explores the challenges black performers face, and celebrates how Stone has been able to establish a healthy life after the pressures of show business and fame&quot;.&quot; Some interviews from &quot;Small Talk About Sly&quot; and Michael Rubenstone&#x27;s &quot;On the Sly: In Search of the Family Stone&quot; were used in the documentary.

== Legacy ==
Along with James Brown and Parliament-Funkadelic, Sly and the Family Stone were pioneers of late 1960s and early &#x27;70s funk. Their fusion of R&amp;B rhythms, infectious melodies, and psychedelia created a new pop/soul/rock hybrid, the impact of which has proven lasting and widespread. Motown producer Norman Whitfield, for example, patterned the label&#x27;s forays into harder-driving, socially relevant material (such as The Temptations&#x27; &quot;Runaway Child&quot; and &quot;Ball of Confusion&quot;) based on their sound. The pioneering precedent of Stone&#x27;s racial, sexual, and stylistic mix, had a major influence in the 1980s on artists such as Prince and Rick James. Legions of artists from the 1990s forward – including Public Enemy, Fatboy Slim, Beck, Beastie Boys and LL Cool J&#x27;s popular &quot;Mama Said Knock You Out&quot; along with many others – mined Stone&#x27;s seminal back catalog for hook-laden samples.

&quot;The most talented musician I know is Sly Stone,&quot; Bootsy Collins said in an interview with &quot;Mojo&quot;. &quot;He&#x27;s more talented than anybody I ever have seen – he&#x27;s amazing. I worked with him in Detroit from 1981 to &#x27;83, and to see him just fooling around, playing, jamming, is a whole other trip. He&#x27;s the most amazing musician.&quot;

==Personal life==
Stone and producer Terry Melcher spent time together at Melcher&#x27;s home in the late 1960s, and on more than one occasion Stone saw Charles Manson there. According to Stone in a 2009 interview with &quot;LA Weekly&#x27;s&quot; Randall Roberts, he was once at Melcher&#x27;s home playing music and had a small disagreement with Manson there, though Stone did not know who Manson was at the time. Stone met Melcher&#x27;s mother, Doris Day, through Melcher when Stone was interested in an old car that he thought one of them owned. When he met Day, he told her how much he liked her song &quot;Whatever Will Be, Will Be,&quot; and they sat at the piano and sang it. After that, a rumor spread that Stone and Day were involved romantically.

Stone married model-actress Kathy Silva on June 5, 1974, during a sold-out performance at Madison Square Garden. Their outfits were designed by Halston. They made elaborate plans for a laser-light show, a real-life &quot;angel&quot; flying on wires dropping gold glitter all over the crowd, and for thousands of doves to be released. The ASPCA threatened a lawsuit, which kept the doves from flying and the Garden wouldn&#x27;t let the human &quot;angel&quot; fly unless Stone and company posted a $125,000 security bond. They declined to pay the fee, and also opted not to pay for the 200 extra security guards the venue demanded in order to allow the wedding party to stage a processional right through the audience.

They separated in 1976 after their son was mauled by Stone&#x27;s dog. Silva later told &quot;People&quot; magazine. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want that world of drugs and weirdness.&quot; Still, she remembers, &quot;He&#x27;d write me a song or promise to change, and I&#x27;d try again. We were always fighting, then getting back together.&quot;

===Children===
Stone’s son Sylvester Jr. was born in late 1973. His mother is Kathy Silva. His first daughter Sylvyette, who now goes by her middle name Phunne, was born c. 1976. Her mother was Stone’s band member Cynthia Robinson. Stone’s second daughter, Novena Carmel, born c. 1982, is a singer and performer, and also a booking agent at the Little Temple club in Los Angeles, now known as The Virgil, and currently a co-host for the popular public radio station KCRW on Morning Becomes Eclectic. She also worked with pop/hip hop musician Wallpaper.

===Family===
Stone&#x27;s cousin is Moses Tyson, Jr., who is a gospel musician and organist.

<doc id="165889" wikidata="Q1113011" url="?curid=165889" title="Fixed capital">
<text>In accounting, fixed capital is any kind of real, physical asset that is used repeatedly in the production of a product. In economics, fixed capital is a type of capital good that as a real, physical asset is used as a means of production which is durable or isn&#x27;t fully consumed in a single time period. 
It contrasts with circulating capital such as raw materials, operating expenses etc.

The concept was first theoretically analyzed in some depth by the economist Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations (1776) and by David Ricardo in On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation (1821). Ricardo studied the use of machines in place of labor and concluded that workers&#x27; fear of technology replacing them might be justified.

Thus fixed capital is that portion of the total capital outlay that is invested in fixed assets (such as land improvements, buildings, vehicles, plant, and equipment), that stay in the business almost permanently—or at the very least, for more than one accounting period. Fixed assets can be &quot;purchased&quot; by a business, in which case the business owns them. They can also be &quot;leased&quot;, &quot;hired&quot; or &quot;rented&quot;, if that is cheaper or more convenient, or if owning the fixed asset is practically impossible (for legal or technical reasons).

Refining the classical distinction between fixed and circulating capital in &quot;Das Kapital&quot;, Karl Marx emphasizes that the distinction is really purely relative, i.e. it refers only to the comparative rotation speeds (turnover time) of different types of physical capital assets. Fixed capital also &quot;circulates&quot;, except that the circulation time is much longer, because a fixed asset may be held for 5, 10 or 20 years before it has yielded its value and is discarded for its salvage value. A fixed asset may also be resold and re-used, which often happens with vehicles and planes.

In national accounts, fixed capital is conventionally defined as the stock of tangible, durable fixed assets owned or used by resident enterprises for more than one year. This includes plant, machinery, vehicles and equipment, installations and physical infrastructures, the value of land improvements, and buildings.

The European system of national and regional accounts (ESA95) explicitly includes produced intangible assets (e.g. mineral exploitation, computer software, copyright protected entertainment, literary and artistics originals) within the definition of fixed assets.

&quot;Land&quot; itself is not included in the statistical concept of fixed capital, even though it is a fixed asset. The main reason is that land is not regarded as a product (a reproducible good). But the value of &quot;land improvements&quot; is included in the statistical concept of fixed capital, is regarded as the creation of value-added through production.

==Estimating the value==
There are two primary methods for estimating the stock of fixed capital in any nation: direct measurement of the capital stock and perpetual inventory calculations. 
Attempts have been made to estimate the value of the stock of fixed capital for the whole economy using direct enterprise surveys of &quot;book value&quot;, administrative business records, tax assessments, and data on gross fixed capital formation, price inflation and depreciation schedules. A pioneer in this area was the economist Simon Kuznets.

The &quot;perpetual inventory method&quot; (PIM) used to estimate fixed capital stocks was invented by Raymond W. Goldsmith in 1951 and subsequently used around the world. The basic idea of the PIM method is, that one starts off from a benchmark asset figure, and adds on the net additions to fixed assets year by year (using gross fixed capital formation data), while deducting annual estimates of economic depreciation based upon an explicit service life assumption, all data being adjusted for price inflation using a capital expenditure price index. In this way, one obtains a time series of annual fixed capital stocks. This data series can also be modified further with various other adjustments for prices, economic depreciation, etc. (several variants of the PIM approach are nowadays used by economic historians and statisticians).
==Economic depreciation==

Depreciation as an economic concept distinguishes between &quot;...the value of the stock of capital assets and the annual value of that asset&#x27;s services, distinguishing between depreciation and inflation as sources of the change in asset value, and distinguishing between the depreciation in asset values and deterioration in an asset&#x27;s physical productivity.&quot; 
Depreciation is the cost of the stock of capital assets allocated over their service lives in proportion to estimates of their service lives, net of maintenance and repair costs.

Economic depreciation, therefore, is &quot;...the decline in asset price (or shadow price) is due to aging and varies with age&quot; Economic depreciation is also characterized by an &quot; ... age-price relationship in which the largest rate of price decline occurs in the early years of asset life.&quot;
The depreciation write-off permitted for tax purposes may also diverge from that of economic depreciation or &quot;real&quot; depreciation rates. The key factor is the estimate of &quot;economic service life&quot;. Economic depreciation can, however, be estimated with &quot;...sufficient precision to be useful in policy analysis.&quot; 
==Investment risk==
A business executive who invests in or accumulates fixed capital is tying up wealth in a fixed asset, hoping to make a future profit. Thus, such investment usually implies a risk. Sometimes depreciation write-offs are also viewed partly as compensation for this risk. Often leasing or renting a fixed asset (such as a vehicle) rather than buying it is preferred by enterprises because the cost of using it is lowered thereby, and the real owner may be able to obtain special tax advantages.

==Sources of funding for fixed capital investment==

An owner can obtain funding for the purchase of fixed capital assets from the aptly named capital market, where loans are given on a long-term basis. Funding can also come from reserve funds, the selling of shares, and the issuing of debentures, bonds or other promissory notes.

==Factors which influence fixed-capital requirements==

*The nature of the undertaking- the nature of the business, certainly plays a role in determining fixed capital requirements. A florist, for example, needs less fixed capital than a vehicle-assembly factory.
* The size of the undertaking- a general rule that states: the bigger the business, the higher the need for fixed capital.
* The stage of development of the undertaking- the requirement of capital for a new undertaking is usually greater than that needed for an established business that has reached optimum size.

<text>Paintball is a competitive team shooting sport in which players eliminate opponents from play by hitting them with spherical dye-filled gelatin capsules called paintballs that break upon impact. Paintballs are usually shot using low-energy air weapons called paintball markers that are powered by compressed air or carbon dioxide and were originally designed for remotely marking trees and cattle.

The game was invented in June 1981 in New Hampshire by Hayes Noel, a Wall Street stock trader, and Charles Gaines, an outdoorsman and writer. A debate arose between them about whether a city-dweller had the instinct to survive in the woods against a man who had spent his youth hunting, fishing, and building cabins. A friend of the pair chanced upon an advertisement for &quot;Nel-Spot&quot; cattle marking guns in a farm catalogue and they were inspired to use it to settle their argument. Shortly after they participated with 10 other men in a capture the flag competition they called the first annual &quot;Survival Game&quot;. One hundred acres of forest in New Hampshire were divided in to four quadrants and participants were tasked with collecting a flag from each quadrant and returning to a home base. A forester named G. Ritchie White collected the four flags to win in two hours and fifteen minutes. Many initial public reactions to the game were negative, believing that hunting other humans with realistic but non-lethal guns was &quot;sick&quot;, &quot;macho&quot;, and &quot;perverted&quot;. 

The sport is played for recreation and is also played at a formal sporting level with organized competition that involves major tournaments, professional teams, and players. Games can be played on indoor or outdoor fields of varying sizes. A playing field may have natural or artificial terrain which players use for tactical cover. Game types and goals vary, but include capture the flag, elimination, defending or attacking a particular point or area, or capturing objects of interest hidden in the playing area. Depending on the variant played, games can last from minutes to hours, or even &quot;days&quot; in &quot;scenario play&quot;.

The legality of the sport and use of paintball markers varies among countries and regions. In most areas where regulated play is offered, players are required to wear protective masks, use barrel-blocking safety equipment, and strictly enforce safe game rules.

==Equipment==

The paintball equipment used may depend on the game type (&quot;e.g.&quot;, woodsball, speedball, scenario), on how much money one is willing to spend on equipment, and on personal preference. However, almost every player will utilize three basic pieces of equipment:
* Paintball marker: also known as a &quot;paintball gun&quot;, this is the primary piece of equipment, used to mark the opposing player with paintballs. The paintball gun must have a loader or &quot;hopper&quot; or magazines attached to feed paint into the marker, and will be either spring-fed, gravity-fed (where balls drop into the loading chamber), or electronically force-fed. Modern markers require a compressed air tank or CO2 tank. In contrast, very early bolt-action paintball markers used disposable metal CO2 cartridges also used by pellet guns. In the mid to late 1980s, marker mechanics improved to include constant air pressure and semi-automatic operation. Further improvements included increased rates of fire; carbon dioxide (CO2) tanks from 100 to 1,180 ml (3.5 to 40 US fluid ounces), and compressed-air or nitrogen tanks in a variety of sizes and pressure capacities up to 34,000 kPa (5,000 psi). The use of unstable CO2 causes damage to the low-pressure pneumatic components inside electronic markers, therefore the more stable compressed air is preferred by owners of such markers.
* Paintballs (pellets): Paintballs, the ammunition used in the marker, are spherical gelatin capsules containing primarily polyethylene glycol, other non-toxic and water-soluble substances, and dye. The quality of paintballs is dependent on the brittleness of the ball&#x27;s shell, the roundness of the sphere, and the thickness of the fill; higher-quality balls are almost perfectly spherical, with a very thin shell to guarantee breaking upon impact, and a thick, brightly colored fill that is difficult to hide or wipe off during the game. Almost all paintballs in use today are biodegradable. All ingredients used in the making of a paintball are food-grade quality and are harmless to the participants and environment. Manufacturers and distributors have been making the effort to move away from the traditional oil-based paints and compressed CO2 gas propellant, to a more friendly water-based formula and compressed air in an effort to become more &quot;eco-friendly&quot;. Paintballs come in a variety of sizes, including of 13mm (0.50 in) and 17mm (0.68 in).
* Mask or goggles: Masks are safety devices players are required to wear at all times on the field, to protect them from paintballs. The original equipment used by players were safety goggles of the type used in labs and wood shops; today&#x27;s goggles are derived from skiing/snowboarding goggles, with an attached shell that completely covers the eyes, mouth, ears and nostrils of the wearer. Masks can also feature throat guards. Modern masks have developed to be less bulky compared with older designs. Some players may remove the mouth and/or ear protection for aesthetic or comfort reasons, but this is neither recommended nor often allowed at commercial venues. A good paintball mask will protect the eyes from vision distortion caused by fogging, glare, and scratches. Players who do not wear a paintball mask can suffer serious injury.

Additional equipment, commonly seen among frequent players, tournament participants, and professional players include:
* Pods and pod packs: The most common addition to the above &quot;mandatory&quot; equipment, &quot;pods&quot; are plastic containers, usually with flip-open lids, that store paintballs in a ready-to-use manner. Pods are available in many sizes, including 10, 80, 100 and 140-round sizes, with the larger 140-round pods being most common among tournament players. Pods are carried by the player in &quot;pod packs&quot; or &quot;harnesses&quot; which facilitate easy access to the pods during play. There are several designs of pod packs, from belt loops allowing a recreational player to carry one or two extra pods, to harness designs generally designed for either tournament-style or scenario-style players.
* Squeegee/swab – From time to time, a paintball will break inside the player&#x27;s marker. When this happens it coats the inner surfaces of the marker with paint, especially the barrel, which considerably reduces accuracy. While speedball and tournament players generally have no time to clear this obstruction and instead simply &quot;shoot through it&quot;, woodsball and scenario players generally carry a tool to allow them to clear the barrel following a break. There are several types of squeegee, most of which are advantageous in two of three areas and disadvantageous in the last: cleaning time, effectiveness, and storage space.
* Paintball jerseys and pants: Originally derived from motocross and BMX attire, tournament players commonly wear special outer clothing with integrated padding that allows the player a free range of motion, and helps protect the player both from paintball hits and from incidental contact with rocks and hard ground. Certain designs of jersey and pant even advertise lower incidence of hits, due to increased &quot;bounce-offs&quot; and &quot;breakaways&quot;. In indoor fields, where shooting generally happens at very close range, hard-shelled armor is sometimes worn to protect the player from bruising and welts from close-range hits.
* Elbow and knee pads: Common among outdoor sports, players can choose to help protect knee, elbow and even hip joints from jarring impact with the use of pads. For paintball, these pads are generally soft foam worn inside a player&#x27;s pants to prevent abrasion of the pad against the ground.
* Gloves: Paintball impacts to the hands, knuckles and fingers can be extremely painful and temporarily debilitating. Outdoors, players are often prone or crawling which can cause scrapes to the hands. Padded or armored gloves help reduce the potential for injury to the hands. These gloves are generally referred to as &quot;tactical gloves&quot; and their purpose is to protect the player&#x27;s hands while maintaining dexterity.
* Athletic supporter: Also called a jockstrap with cup pocket and protective cup. Players generally take care to protect sensitive or vulnerable anatomical areas from painful hits and injury; men commonly wear an athletic supporter with a rigid cup similar to types used in cricket, American football, lacrosse, hockey or baseball, while women often wear a pelvic protector and a padded or hard-shelled sports bra also commonly seen in the aforementioned sports.
* Other paint marking equipment: Normally seen in scenario play only, and disallowed at all tournaments, other forms of paint-marking equipment are sold, such as paint-grenades (paint-filled balloons or lengths of surgical hose).
* Vehicles: Again normally only seen in scenario play, a variety of vehicles have been devised based on go-karts, pickup trucks, ATVs, small off-road vehicles, etc. to create &quot;armored vehicles&quot;, within which players are protected from hits and can move around on the field. Such vehicles may employ a wide range of mounted paint-discharging weaponry.
* Hats/Toques/Bandanas: Commonly worn by all levels of players to protect the forehead from direct paintball hits, and stop sweat from running down in to the mask.
* Remote lines: Used to increase maneuverability, a remote line is a high- pressure hose connecting the fuel tank to the marker allowing the tank to be stored in a backpack or harness. It is mostly found in Mil-Sim, woodsball and scenario events.

== Gameplay ==

Paintball is played with a potentially limitless variety of rules and variations, which are specified before the game begins. The most basic game rule is that players must attempt to accomplish a goal without being shot and marked with a paintball. A variety of different rules govern the legality of a hit, ranging from &quot;anything counts&quot; (hits cause elimination whether the paintball broke and left a mark or not) to the most common variation: the paintball must break and leave a mark the size of a US quarter or larger. Eliminated players are expected to leave the field of play; eliminations may also earn the opposing team points. Depending on the agreed upon game rules, the player may return to the field and continue playing, or is eliminated from the game completely.

The particular goal of the game is determined before play begins; examples include &quot;capture the flag&quot; and &quot;elimination&quot;. Paintball has spawned popular variants, including woodsball, which is played in the natural environment and spans across a large area. Conversely, the variant of speedball is played on a smaller field and has a very fast pace with games as brief as two minutes fifteen seconds in the (NSL) or lasting up to twenty minutes in the PSP (Paintball Sports Promotions). Another variant is scenario paintball, in which players attempt to recreate historical, or fictional settings.

=== Tournament ===

Tournaments are skill based competitions. These are often bracket tournaments with 5 person teams, taking place on Speedball (paintball) fields. Tournaments such as the NXL hold different events throughout the summer months all over the United States with a range of skill divisions. Other series such as the Ultimate Woodsball League (UWL) play tournaments with large teams on large wooded fields. The types of tournaments and applicable skill divisions vary wildly to serve the diverse interest of paintball competitors.

The CPPS (Central Premier Paintball Series) is the leading paintball tournament event in the UK and only hosts tournament style paintball. Everything is played on sup air fields (inflatable bunkers on flat grass) and games are timed and scored.

=== Speedball ===

Speedball is played in an open field that could be compared to a soccer field, it is flat with a minimum of natural obstacles, and sometimes artificial turf is used, especially in indoor fields. The first speedball fields were constructed with flat wooden obstacles staked into the ground to provide cover; this concept was further developed into a number of urban-scenario field styles with larger building-like obstacles for casual play, but speedball itself progressed to using smaller obstacles made from plastic drainage pipe, which offered a more variable field layout and some &quot;give&quot; to the obstacles for increased safety. This style of play was often referred to as &quot;Hyperball&quot;. Eventually, inflatable fabric &quot;bunkers&quot; were developed based on common obstacle shapes from previous fields, such as &quot;snake&quot; and &quot;can&quot; bunkers. Often referred to as &quot;Airball&quot;, the use of these inflatable obstacles both increases player safety by reducing potential injury from collisions with obstacles, and allows them to be easily moved to reconfigure the field or to set up temporary fields.

=== Woodsball ===

Woodsball, or &quot;Bushball&quot;, is a fairly recent term that refers to what was the original form of the game: teams competing in a wooded or natural environment, in which varying amounts of stealth and concealment tactics can offer an advantage. The term is commonly used as a synonym for specialized scenario-based play, but it technically refers to virtually any form of paintball played in fields primarily composed of natural terrain and cover such as trees and berms, instead of manmade obstacles. Usually the gamemode is &quot;team death match&quot; although some times it is &quot;capture the flag&quot;, or &quot;protect the president&quot; (where one player is chosen as the &quot;president&quot;, the president&#x27;s team must protect the president, the enemy team must eliminate the president).

=== Scenario ===

Commonly referred to as &quot;Big Games&quot; or &quot;Scenario Games&quot;. &quot;Big Games&quot; refer to territory control based gameplay, while a &quot;Paintball Scenario&quot; refers to a game where tasks are given to each side at timed intervals. Pioneered by Wayne Dollack, &quot;Scenario Paintball&quot; focus much more heavily on Live Action Roleplaying events, elevating their immersion, storyline, and game play mechanics above the paintball aspect of play. Many variations and combinations of these games are currently played and are unique to each event and event producer. The game uses the entire venue it is at, combining all normal gaming fields into 1 large playing area. Popular examples of the scenario format are Paintball&#x27;s Grand Finale at Wayne&#x27;s World (Ocala, Florida), Cousin&#x27;s Big Game in Coram, New York (on Long Island), Hell Survivor&#x27;s Monster Game (just outside Pinckney, Michigan), Invasion of Normandy at Skirmish U.S.A in Pennsylvania, Oklahoma D-Day (in Wyandotte, Oklahoma), Fight For Asylum at PRZ Paintball (Picton, Ontario), Battle Royale at Flag Raiders Paintball (Kitchener, Ontario), the Sherwood Classic at Sherwood Forest (La Porte, Indiana), and Free Finale at Low Country Paintball (Ludowici, GA) events which draws in 100 to 5000 players and run at least 6 hours of uninterrupted play, most often averaging 12 hours of play in 2 days. &quot;True24&quot; scenario events run at least 24 hours continuously, the most recent one taking place in May 2019 at Sherwood Forest. These formats vary widely and are frequently historical MilSim, movie, or pop culture themed.

=== MilSim ===
MilSim (&quot;Military Simulation&quot;) is a mode of play designed to create an experience closer to military reality, where the attainment of specific objectives is the most important aspect of the game.

MilSim addresses the logistics of combat, mission planning and execution, and dealing with limited resources and ammunition. Players are typically eliminated from the game when struck by paint just like in any traditional game of paintball. MilSim is a popular gamemode also played in Airsoft, which is a similar sport to paintball.

With the advent of shaped projectiles, such as the First Strike, and the resulting development of magazine fed markers, a considerable increase in range, accuracy and MILSIM realism was gained. Functionally speaking, magazine-fed markers are no different from any other paintball marker, with one exception. Instead of paintballs being gravity fed from a bulky hopper, which sits above the marker, shaped projectiles (or paintballs) are fed from a spring-loaded magazine from the bottom of the marker. The caliber of both the gravity fed and magazine fed markers are the same (.68 caliber) and the velocities are also generally the same. The increased range and accuracy of the shaped projectile comes from the higher ballistic coefficient that the shaped projectile has, and the gyroscopic spin imparted onto the projectile from a rifled barrel and fins on the projectile itself. Magazine fed markers and shaped projectiles have allowed marker designs to more closely approximate the styling and functionality of actual (real steel) firearms, which in turn has given paintball a better avenue to compete with Airsoft in the MilSim environment.

=== MFOG ===
Mag-Fed Only Game. An increasingly popular style of game play that forbids bulk loading devices such as the traditional paintball &quot;hopper&quot; or &quot;loader&quot; and under or back mounted

=== Time Trials ===
A single player paintball attraction in which participants move through a closed course and shoot at a succession of targets. Runs are timed and competition among players is through a leader board, competing to be the quickest.

=== Zombie Hunt ===
A static (or mobile) entertainment attraction. Venue staff are padded up and dressed as zombies. Paintball markers are mounted to a flat bed trailer. Participants are taken on a &quot;Haunted Hay Ride&quot; style attraction, towed through the property, where they defend themselves from the zombie hordes with paintballs. Generally, black lights and glow in the dark paintballs are used as ammo.

=== Enforcement of game rules ===
Regulated games are overseen by referees or marshals, who patrol the course to ensure enforcement of the rules and the safety of the players. If a player is marked with paint, they will call them out, but competitors may also be expected to follow the honor code; a broken ball means elimination. Field operators may specify variations to this rule, such as requiring a tag to certain body locations only – such as the head and torso only. There are game rules that can be enforced depending on the venue, to ensure safety, balance the fairness of the game or eliminate cheating.
* Masks On Even when a game isn&#x27;t in progress, virtually all venues enforce a &quot;masks-on&quot; rule while players are within the playing area. More generally, within any given area of the park, either all players&#x27;/spectators&#x27;/officials&#x27; masks must be on, or all players&#x27; markers must either have a barrel block in place or be disconnected from their gas source, to ensure that a paintball cannot be fired from any nearby marker and cause eye injury. Some fields encourage players to aim away from opponents&#x27; heads during play if possible; splatter from mask hits can penetrate ventilation holes in the goggles and cause eye irritation, close-range hits to the mask can cause improperly maintained lenses to fail, and hits to unprotected areas of the face, head and neck are especially painful and can cause more serious injury.
* Minimum distance – When being tagged, depending on the distance from where the shot was fired, a direct paintball impact commonly causes bruises. In certain areas and at close range, these impacts may leave welts, or even break the skin and cause bleeding. To decrease these risks and the severity of associated injuries, commercial venues may enforce a minimum distance, such as , within which players cannot shoot an opponent. Many fields enforce a modified minimum distance &quot;surrender rule&quot;; a player who advances to within minimum range must offer his opponent the chance to surrender before shooting. This generally prevents injury and discord at recreational games, however it is seldom used in tournaments as it confers a real disadvantage to the attacking player; he must hesitate while his opponent is free to shoot immediately. The act of shooting a player at close range is colloquially called &quot;bunkering&quot;; it happens most often when a player uses covering fire to force his opponent behind the cover of a bunker, then advances on that bunker while still shooting to eliminate the opponent point-blank. A tap of the targeted player with the barrel of a marker, sometimes called a &quot;barrel tag&quot;, &quot;Murphy&quot; or &quot;tap-out&quot;, is generally considered equivalent to marking them with a paintball and is sometimes used in situations where one player is able to sneak up on an opponent to point-blank range.
* Hits - A player is hit if a paintball leaves a solid mark of a specified minimum size (often nickel- or quarter-sized) anywhere on the player&#x27;s body or equipment. Some variations of paintball don&#x27;t count hits to the gun or the pod pack, or require multiple hits on the arms or legs. Most professional fields and tournaments, though, count any hit on a person, the equipment on their person, or even objects picked up at random from the field. A grey area of &quot;splatter&quot; often occurs when a paintball breaks on a nearby surface and that paint deflects onto the player; this usually does not count as a hit but it can be difficult to tell the difference between significant splatter and a genuine direct hit.
* Overshooting – Fields may discourage players from &quot;overshooting&quot; (also regarded as &quot;bonus balling&quot;, &quot;ramping&quot;, &quot;overkill&quot;, or &quot;lighting up&quot;), which is to repeatedly shoot an opposing player after he is eliminated from the game. It is also considered overshooting if a player knew the opponent was eliminated but continued to shoot, disregarding the safety of the opposing player and risking dangerous injury to others.
* Ramping – Ramping is a feature of many electronic markers, where after a certain number of rapid shots or upon a threshold rate-of-fire being achieved by the player, the gun will begin firing faster than the trigger is being pulled. Ramping of rate of fire is prohibited or sharply limited at most paintball fields, however it is allowed in various tournament formats with specific rules governing when and how the marker may ramp.
* Wiping – Players may attempt to cheat by &quot;wiping&quot; paint from themselves, to pretend they were not hit and stay in the game. If caught, &quot;wipers&quot; are generally called out of the game, and in recreational paintball may be ejected from the field for multiple instances of wiping. Various tournament rules state additional penalties for players or teams caught wiping, such as &quot;3-for-1&quot; (calling the wiping player and the nearest three players out) in PSP capture-the-flag, or a prescribed number of &quot;penalty minutes&quot; in XBall.
* Non-contact - While paintball does involve tagging players with paintball projectiles, this is generally considered the sole point of physical contact between members of opposing teams. Players are generally prohibited from physically contacting other players, such as colliding with them, physically restraining them, and especially using fists, feet, protective gear or the markers themselves to hit other players. Fisticuffs in particular are dangerous not only to the participants but to all players on or off the field, and referees are generally trained to respond immediately and aggressively to stop the fight, and to eject and ban instigators of these fights.
* Velocity - Though most paintball markers are capable of firing at muzzle velocities of around 300 feet per second (fps), the players&#x27; paintball marker is generally limited to a muzzle velocity of 280 fps for safety reasons.

=== Strategy ===
Player and team strategy varies depending on the size and layout of the field and the total number and experience level of players. The most basic strategy is to coordinate with the team to distribute the team members across the field roughly perpendicular to the line between starting stations to cover all potential lines of advance; a team that runs all in the same direction is easily flanked by opponents moving around the field on the opposite side. A second basic goal is to control as much of the field as possible, as early as possible, either by being the first to get to advantageous obstacles on the field or by quickly eliminating one or more opponents to reduce the number of directions each player has to watch for incoming paint. The more territory that the members of a team have behind them, the more options they have for choosing effective cover and changing position to get a good shot at one or more opponents, and because the field is of finite size, the fewer options the opposing team has.

A key element of intermediate and advanced strategy is the concept of &quot;firing lanes&quot;. These are clear lines of sight between obstacles on the field and thus potentially between opposing players on the field behind them. A lane is &quot;occupied&quot; if at least one player of the opposing team can fire along it, and it&#x27;s &quot;active&quot; if any player is firing along it, friend or foe. Occupied and active lanes hinder player movement as the player risks getting hit and eliminated. Open fields with sparse cover often have long open lanes between most or all bunkers on the field, most of which will be occupied if not active. Therefore, players have to keep track of which lanes to and from their bunker become occupied by the other team, so the player can make sure the bunker is between themselves and the opponent(s). This becomes harder the more occupied firing lanes there are; when most available firing lanes on the field are occupied, each team has to create cover in at least one direction using suppressing fire (rounds sent to the opponent&#x27;s location designed to keep their head down more than to eliminate them). Speedball, which tends to use small open fields with relatively few obstacles, requires each player to use hundreds of paintballs in the course of a game to keep his opponents pinned down, lest he be pinned himself. Conversely, if most firing lanes on the field are clear, players on each team have greater mobility and the use of covering fire to pin an opponent is less useful as the player can stay behind cover while moving long distances, so players tend to fire less and move more to gain clear shots. Urban scenarios and woodsball fields tend to be larger and with more cover, shortening firing lanes and requiring players to move more to get good shots against their opponent.

Typically, strategy is limited for casual walk-on style paintball play. Some teamwork will be seen at the beginning of the games with brief discussions on tactics and strategy, such as distributing players between bunkers and assigning defenders that will stay back and cover attackers that advance. However, mid to late game tactics tend to be limited to groups of players sticking together or doing isolated attacks rather than a coordinated sweep down the field. In team paintball tournaments, more serious planned team tactics and strategy is seen throughout each game from the opening to the endgame. Teams generally practice together and have planned tactics they can use in the tournament, and know what each of their teammates will be trying to do in various situations during the game.

== Playing venues ==

Paintball is played at both commercial venues, which require paid admission, and private land, both of which may include multiple fields of varying size and layout. Fields can be scattered with either natural or artificial terrain, and may also be themed to simulate a particular environment, such as a wooded or urban area, and may involve a historical context. Smaller fields (such as those used for speedball and tournament play) may include an assortment of various inflatable bunkers; these fields are less prone to cause injury as the bunkers are little more than air bags, which can absorb the impact of a player colliding with them. Before these inflatable fields became available and popular, speedball fields were commonly constructed of various rigid building materials, such as plywood and framing timber, shipping pallets, even concrete and plastic drainage pipe. The use of plastic pipe tethered with stakes became common, as it allowed for relatively easy reconfiguration of fields and at least some impact-absorption, and was the precursor to the modern inflatable bunker (in fact, certain common features in inflatable fields, such as &quot;can&quot; and &quot;snake&quot; bunkers, were derived from similar features built with plastic drainage pipe). Recreational fields still commonly use these older materials for their higher durability and novelty; inflatable bunkers are prone to bursting seams or otherwise developing holes and leaks. Other fields have wooden or plastic barriers.

Commercial venues may provide amenities such as bathrooms, picnic areas, lockers, equipment rentals, air refills and food service. Countries may have paintball sports guidelines, with rules on specific safety and insurance standards, and paid staff (including referees) who must ensure players are instructed in proper play to ensure participants&#x27; safety. Some fields are &quot;BYOP&quot; (Bring Your Own Paint), allowing players to buy paint at unrelated retail stores or online and use it at their field. However, most fields are FPO (Field Paint Only,) meaning players must buy paint at the venue or at a pro shop affiliated with the park. This is largely for revenue reasons; field and rental fees generally do not cover expenses of a paintball park. However, other reasons relating to player safety are generally cited and have some merit, as poor quality or poorly stored paint can cause gun failures or personal injury to targeted players. Other times, FPO policies are in keeping with municipal laws for wastewater and runoff; paintballs contain food dyes, and some formulations have metallic flakes and/or cornstarch to make them more visible, all of which can pose problems in water reservoirs and treatment plants. So, fields that must wash paintball paint into municipal wastewater facilities, or that have substantial rain runoff into bodies of water that are used as sources of drinking water, are generally required by the municipality to restrict players to only certain paint formulations; the easiest way to achieve this is to sell only approved paint and require that field paint be used.

Playing on a non-established field is sometimes referred to as &quot;renegade&quot; or &quot;gonzo&quot; play or &quot;outlaw ball&quot; (with the players nicknamed &quot;renegade ballers&quot; or &quot;outlaws&quot;). Though less expensive and less structured than play at a commercial facility, the lack of safety protocols, instruction, and oversight can lead to higher incidence of injuries.
== Organized play ==
The first organized paintball game in record was held by Charles Gaines and his friends in New Hampshire in 1981, with the first paintball field opening approximately a year later in Sutton, New Hampshire. In 1983, the first &quot;National Survival Game&quot; (NSG) championship was held, with a $14,000 cash award for the winning team. , tournaments are largely organized by &quot;paintball leagues&quot;.

=== Leagues ===

A Speedball league is an organization that provides a regulated competition for Speedball players to compete. Leagues can be of various sizes (for example, regional, national or international) and offer organized tournaments and or games for professional, semi-professional, and amateur teams, sometimes with financial prizes. The first British national league was the British Paintball League created in 1989 by Gary Morhall, Richard Hart and Derek Wildermuth in Essex England. As of 2017, the major leagues in the United States are the National X-ball League (NXL), Carolina Field Owners Association (CFOA), Maximum Velocity Paintball Series (MVPS), the Northern Xtreme Paintball League (NXPL). Internationally, Paintball League Middle-East (PALM)  in  Middle-East, East Asian Paintball League (PALS) series in East Asia, Hazara Series in Western Europe, the Centurio series in Eastern Europe, and the National Collegiate Paintball Association in the US and Canada (A league was also created for high school and college players, the NCPA.*Not recognized by the NCAA*). They are supplemented by various regional and local leagues spread worldwide. Within these leagues it is narrowed down further to divisions. There are six divisions from division 5 to division 1 besides various professional leagues.

=== Tournament format ===
The nature and timing of paintball events are specified by the league running the tournament, with the league also defining match rules – such as number of players per team (anywhere from 3-7 players per team), or acceptable equipment for use. The number of matches in a tournament is largely defined by the number of available teams playing. However, the NSL offers non-tournament game play where a more traditional game day format has been adopted. Two teams face off at a set time and play only one game per game day in the season as beginners play a 24-minute game and amateur and professionals play a 32-minute game, both requiring 90 minutes to resolve.

A match in a tournament is refereed by a judge, whose authority and decisions are final. Tournament rules can vary as specified by the league, but may include for example – not allowing players to use devices to communicate with other persons during a game, or not allowing players to unduly alter the layout of terrain on the field. In contrast to a casual game designed for fun, a tournament is much stricter and violations of rules may result in penalties for the players or entire teams.

Though tournament paintball was originally played in the woods, speedball became the standard competitive format in the 1990s. The smaller fields made use of artificial terrain such as bunkers, allowing symmetrical fields that eliminate terrain advantages for either team; woodsball fields having no such guarantee. Most recently, fields using inflatable bunkers, tethered to the ground with stakes, have become standard for most tournament formats; the soft, yielding bunkers reduce the occurrence of injuries, the bunkers deflate to store in a compact space and anchor to the ground with tent stakes, allowing for temporary fields to be set up and torn down with less impact on the ground underneath, and the arrangement of bunkers can be easily re-configured to maintain novelty of play or to simulate a predetermined field layout for an upcoming event.

=== Professional teams ===

A professional paintball team is one that plays paintball with the financial, equipment or other kind of support of one or more sponsors, often in return for advertising rights. Professional teams can have different names in different leagues due to franchising and sponsorship issues.

== Accused terrorists&#x27; usage ==
In the past, unlawful groups and terrorists have been accused of using paintball for tactical training purposes in connection with the following incidents:

Mohamed Mahmood Alessa and Carlos &quot;Omar&quot; Eduardo Almonte, two men arrested in June 2010 as they were bound for Somalia, and charged with terrorism and conspiring to kill, maim, and kidnap people outside the U.S., had simulated combat at an outdoor paintball facility in West Milford, New Jersey, according to the complaint against them.

Similarly, 11 men, convicted in 2003–04 of composing the Virginia Jihad Network, engaged in paintball training in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, to simulate guerrilla operations and develop combat skills to prepare for &quot;jihad&quot;, according to prosecutors. In 2006, Ali Asad Chandia of the Virginia Jihad Network was sentenced to 15 years in prison aiding the Pakistani terrorist organization, Lashkar-e-Taiba, including arranging a shipment of 50,000 paintballs from the U.S. to Pakistan.

In addition, two of the 2005 London 7/7 bombers were filmed while training in June 2005 at a paintball center in Tonbridge, Kent. Also, the suspects in the 2006 Toronto terrorism case played paintball to prepare for their attack. In 2007, paintball training was engaged in by five terrorists to prepare for an attack aimed at killing American soldiers in Fort Dix, New Jersey; they were later convicted.

== Safety statistics ==

The rate of injury to paintball participants has been estimated as 45 injuries per 100,000 participants per year.
Research published by the Minnesota Paintball Association has argued that paintball is one of the statistically safest sports to participate in, with 20 injuries per 100,000 players annually, and these injuries tend to be incidental to outdoor physical activity (e.g. trip-and-fall). A 2003 study of the 24 patients with modern sports eye injuries presenting to the eye emergency department of Porto São João Hospital between April 1992 and March 2002 included five paintball eye injuries. Furthermore, a one-year study undertaken by the Eye Emergency Department, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston has shown that most sports eye injuries are caused by basketball, baseball, hockey, and racquetball. Another analysis concluded that eye injuries incurred from paintball were in settings where protective equipment such as masks were not enforced, or were removed by the player.
Eye injuries can occur when protective equipment is not properly used and such injuries often cause devastating visual loss. For safety, most regulated paintball fields strictly enforce a &#x27;masks-on&#x27; policy, and most eject players who consistently disobey.

Regardless, paintball has received criticism due to incidents of injury. In Canada in 2007, an eleven-year-old boy lifted his mask and was shot point blank in the eye by an adult playing on the same field, leading to calls by the Montreal Children&#x27;s Hospital to restrict the minimum age of paintball participants to 16 years. In Australia, the sport attracted criticism when a 39-year-old man playing at a registered field in Victoria died of a suspected heart attack, after being struck in the chest.

Additionally, the use of paintball markers outside a regulated environment has caused concern. In the United States in 1998, 14-year-old Jorel Lynn Travis was shot with a paintball gun while standing outside a Fort Collins, Colorado ice cream parlor – blinding her in one eye. In 2001, a series of pre-meditated and racially motivated drive-by shootings targeted Alaska Natives in Anchorage, Alaska, using a paintball marker. In Ottawa, Canada in 2007, Ashley Roos was shot in the eye and blinded with a paintball gun while waiting for a bus. In 2014 in the UK, as a marketing strategy, one company advertised and hired a Human Bullet Tester.

== Legality ==
=== Argentina ===
Paintball has been considered an inappropriate game, that promotes violence, by the Parliament of the Province of Buenos Aires. The approved law 14,492 (December 2012) regulates its use: it is totally forbidden for children under 16 years old, but can be played with written authorization by the parents, or responsible person in charge, of youths between 16 and 18 years old. Originally, the initiative had proposed the total prohibition for players under 21 years old. The penalties are also established by law, as 30 days of communitarian work or other modalities.

=== Australia ===
Paintballing in Australia is controlled by the police in each state, with differing minimum age requirements. Players under 18 are required to have a guardian sign a consent form. The minimum ages are 12 for South Australia, New South Wales and Western Australia, 15 for Queensland, 16 for Australian Capital Territory and Victoria. The minimum age for Victoria was 18 until it was lowered in 2015, with the support of both major parties.

To own a paintball marker privately in Australia (outside Tasmania and the Northern Territory) one must hold a valid firearms license endorsed for paintball use.

In the Northern Territory they are considered a Class C firearm and private ownership is illegal.

In Western Australia they are considered a Category E(5) miscellaneous weapon.

In New South Wales, South Australia, the Australian Capital Territory and Queensland they are considered Class A firearms for the purposes of licensing and storage.

In Victoria they are now classified as a Category P firearm.

Operators must adhere to legislation on gun storage, safety training and field sizes; private owners have to secure their markers according to state law on storage, as by law paintball markers are considered firearms in Australia.

=== Cyprus ===
Paintballing in the Republic of Cyprus is controlled by police, i.e. all paintball markers must be registered and licensed, the field must be in certain standards that is inspected by police in order to obtain the license for a paintball field. The process of buying one&#x27;s own paintball marker is just as complicated, the buyer must have completed military service, have a clean police record and be over the age of 18 years.

Minimum age for paintball is 14 years old with parents consent, from 16 and up no parental consent is required. It is required that all players must wear a protective mask as well and neck and chest protection.
Paintball markers are not allowed to exceed 290 fps velocity and a maximum of 12 bit/s (balls per second) firing rate.

=== Germany ===
In Germany, paintball is restricted to players over 18 years of age. Paintball markers are classified as weapons that do not require a license or permit; they are legal to buy and use, but restricted to adults. Markers are limited to a kinetic energy of 7.5 J. Tampering with the marker to increase muzzle velocity above 280
 fps can lead to confiscation/destruction of the marker and a fine. All paintball markers sold officially in Germany must be certified by the government &quot;Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt&quot; (PTB; English translation: &quot;Federal Physical and Technical Institute&quot;) to operate within these limits and must have a registered serial number and an official stamp on the firing mechanism. In May 2009, reacting to the Winnenden school shooting, German lawmakers announced plans to ban games such as paintball as they allegedly trivialized and encouraged violence but the plans were retracted a few days later. Most indoor paintball areas in Germany have a strict &quot;no mil-sim&quot; policy, meaning that no camouflage clothing or real-life looking markers are allowed.

=== Ireland ===
Paintballing is widely accepted as a recreational pastime in Ireland and is not directly subject to any governing regulations. In Northern Ireland all paintball guns are classified as firearms and as such all gun owners needs to obtain a license from the PSNI (Police Service of Northern Ireland). There is also a minimum age where all players need to be 16 or older. Paintball is governed by the local Gardaí in the Republic of Ireland. A firearms licence is required for both personal and site use. Weapon storage guidelines and security must also be strictly adhered to.

=== New Zealand ===
Paintball markers are classified as Airguns under New Zealand law, and as such are legal for persons 18 and over to possess (those between the ages of 16 and 18 require a firearms license). Following the Arms (Military Style Semi-automatic Firearms and Import Controls) Amendment Act 2012 (Which came into effect on December 1, 2013), fully automatic Paintball guns are legal to purchase and use, although a permit to procure from the New Zealand Police is required in order to legally import them into the country. Military replicas require a permit for import.

=== United Kingdom ===

The UKPSF (UK Paintball Sports Federation) is the only recognised body on behalf of paintball in the UK. The UKPSF represents players, traders and sites within the UK and is recognised by the Home Office and government as the representative body for the UK.
Under Covid lockdown exit arrangements the UKPSF established authority and covid operating procedures for the reopening of sites as sports/activity centres in the UK with the authority of Sport England on recognition of safe operating procedures and standards of UKPSF member sites.

Paintballing venues in the United Kingdom accredited by bodies such as the United Kingdom Paintball Association and the UKPSF (UK Paintball Sports Federation). These bodies define codes of practice for venue operators, but accreditation with these bodies is voluntary. The UKPBA is not an accredited body and has been rejected for its attempts to claim that one of players at Delta Force sites were UKPBA/Delta Force members due to having completed game waivers required to play.

Laws pertaining to paintball markers in the United Kingdom classify them as a type of air gun, although some could be considered to be imitation firearms. Owners do not require a license unless the marker fires above . Only approved paintballs may be used, and the marker must not be fully automatic. The minimum age to be in possession of a marker is 17, except in target shooting clubs or galleries, or on private property so long as projectiles are not fired beyond the premises. It is prohibited to be in possession of a paintball marker in public places. The minimum age for a commercial venue is generally 10, although some venues provide lower-powered guns for children of a younger age.

=== United States ===
In the United States, eight states define explicit legislation for paintball guns. In Pennsylvania, paintball markers have transport requirements, cannot be used against anyone not participating in a paintball activity, and cannot be used for property damage. New Hampshire and Rhode Island require players be at least 18 years of age to own a marker, with students in New Hampshire faced with the possibility of expulsion from school for possessing a marker. In Illinois, owners must be at least 13 years of age, and Illinois law makes it unlawful to fire a paintball gun from or across a street, sidewalk, road, highway, public land, or public place except on a safely constructed target range.

Virginia is one of two states that permit its towns to adopt ordinances on paintball guns, allowing its local authorities to do so. Delaware on the other hand only authorizes Wilmington to do so, but does allow paintball to be played on farms as it is considered an agritourism activity. Florida and Texas limit government liability if a government entity allows paintball on its property.

In virtually all jurisdictions, the use of a paintball marker in a manner other than its intended purpose and/or outside the confines of a sanctioned game or field can result in criminal charges such as disturbing the peace, disorderly conduct, vandalism, criminal mischief or even aggravated assault. Paintball guns may also be considered air guns in some states. The possession and use of paintball guns in public places may also provoke officer-involved shootings from police.

== Paintball around the world ==
=== Australia ===
Despite stiff legislation, paintball is growing in popularity as a competitive sport, with several leagues and tournaments across the country. There are paintball fields in every state except Tasmania that allows paintball marker ownership. In Victoria the Paintball Association of Victoria runs a number of events including scenario, 3v3 and 5v5 competitions.

=== Bangladesh ===
In Bangladesh paintball as a sport is rare. Paintball was first initiated in the BD and the Middle East in 1996. Paintball games and rules were established in Dhaka.

Paintball was first introduced in Bangladesh in 2017 by Ground Zero, a paintball center located in Vatara, Bashundhara R/A. Even though the idea came in 2017 but the paperwork had taken more than two years and in 2020 the paintball center started its journey. Toggy Fun world also has a space for paintballing but it is not a dedicated paintball center.

=== Canada ===
Certain paintball fields opened in the Eastern Townships and in the Laurentians. In the beginning it was mostly fields with regular open fields with barricades of wood, old tires and barrels, and very basic infrastructure. Harry Kruger has operated a paintball venue known as &quot;Capture the Flag&quot; in Alberta since the late 1980s. In 1995 Bigfoot Paintball opened in St. Alphonse-Rodriguez in the region of Lanaudière. After only a few years it became more and more prominent in Québec. In 2013, paintball has become relatively mainstream in Canada, with multiple commercial indoor paintball facilities located in most large cities across Canada, as well as a variety of outdoor style commercial paintball fields located in the countryside around the cities. In 2016, the Ontario Paintball League (OPL) was created. The league offers four divisions with cash and gear prizes for the different divisions. In 2018, the most recent &quot;NXL World Cup&quot; winners, Edmonton Impact, or just Impact, were based out of Canada.

=== Cyprus ===
There are about ten fields in Cyprus, the most recognized of them being the Lapatsa Paintball Ranch in Nicosia, DNA-Paintball in Paphos, and Paintball Cyprus in Limassol. The Republic of Cyprus has a number of ongoing paintball leagues, including CRL (Cyprus Rec-ball League) and CSL (Cyprus Speedball League). Each league has tournaments every month for the duration of the season which is usually about 7–9 months.

=== Denmark ===
In Denmark paintball is a popular sport. There are around 25 paintball outdoor and indoor fields in Denmark. The largest indoor paintball center in Europe is in Copenhagen.

=== Finland ===

Since 1998, Finland&#x27;s operating nationwide umbrella organization, SPBL (Finnish Paintball Association), is responsible for the country&#x27;s paintball activities and its development both as a hobby and as a competitive sport. The largest game paintball area of Finland is located in the town of Jämsä in Central Finland, including no less than 12 hectares of different terrains and nine game areas.

=== India ===
In India, paintball dates back to 2005 when TPCI (The Paintball Co India) joined with PALS (Paintball Asia League Series) which then was the biggest paintball tournament organizer in the Asian circuit and introduced this sport to the country by starting the first commercial paintball park on the outskirts of the national capital at Damdama Lake in Gurgaon, Haryana.

=== Iran ===
In Iran, paintball is a popular recreational sport but also considered by some as expensive and/or dangerous. Nearly every city has one or more paintball fields but only a few of them offer woodsball and realistic terrain, and every province has one or more teams that play in the national paintball league. Iran has a national paintball team.

=== Lebanon ===
Hezbollah, the militant group and political party based in Lebanon, has trained with paintball.

=== Malaysia ===
Paintball is a very popular sport in Malaysia. The Malaysian paintball community is considered the largest in Asia. The Paintball Asia League Series (PALS) is headquartered in Petaling Jaya near the capital city of Kuala Lumpur.

There are also the Malaysian Paintball Official Circuit (MPOC), Malaysian National Paintball League (MY-NPL), the Malaysian Super Sevens Series, World Paintball Players League (WPPL), the Malaysian Ultimate Woodsball League (UWL Malaysia), and Tactical Paintball Championship (TPC). The Paintball World Cup Asia is also held annually in Langkawi island.

Several woodsball and scenario big games are also held throughout the year such as the International Scenario Paintball Games (ISPG) and by Paintball Warfare Group Malaysia (PWG-Malaysia). There are many commercial paintball fields operating in almost every major city across the country, with most of them concentrated around the Klang Valley region. However, in December 2013, the Royal Malaysian Police stated that all paintball markers must be owned with a licence and owners must hand in their markers. Some paintball organizations have stated that this will be &quot;a big blow&quot; to paintball in the country while others stated that this will not affect the sport at all.

In February 2019 the high court has said that paintball markers do not fall under the firearms act but look alike weapons do fall under the category of imitation firearms. This means that paintball markers that do not look like firearms can be owned by anyone with a licence.

=== Singapore ===
Paintball in Singapore started in the late 1990s as a recreational team building activity for corporate sectors. Singapore was one of the earliest countries in South East Asia to introduce paintball as a team building tool. TAG Paintball which was originally located in Downtown East shifted its operations to Orchid Country Club (Yishun) and remained there for almost a decade. Speedball which is the competitive side of paintball was introduced in 2007 by Red Dynasty Paintball Park through a competition known as the Singapore Paintball Novice Series (SPNS). The first tournament saw the participation of 8 3on3 teams which PSG Warfreakz taking the Champion title. The SPNS was later renamed as the Singapore Paintball Series in 2010 to cater to the growing sport. Over the years, Singapore held many international paintball tournaments notably the Paintball Asia League Series (PALS) Singapore edition in 2015 and 2016, the GI.Sportz Cup in 2017 and the Asia Girls Paintball International Championship (AGPIC) in 2018. The AGPIC is the only All-Female paintball tournament to promote women&#x27;s paintball in Asia. All tournaments were held in Red Dynasty Paintball Park which houses 2 internationally sized speedball fields with artificial turf grass.

=== South Africa ===
In South Africa, organised paintball has been played since the late 1980s. The only legal enforcement regarding paintball is the concealment of paintball (and airsoft) guns in public areas. There are no license requirements or age limitations in place, but with the threat of the implementation of the &quot;Dangerous Weapons Act&quot;, this could change.

South Africa has seen a steady growth of the sport of paintball since its introduction. Recreational bushball is the most popular form throughout the country, but the last couple of years have seen a big increase in the popularity of speedball. The South African Paintball League has been in existence since 2002. During 2013 South Africa was invited to send a representative paintball team to the first ever Paintball World Cup held in Paris, France. The South African team got officially ranked 13th in the world.

Popular tournaments such as The Tippmann Challenge, D-Day and the Navy Festival SWAT Challenge, see hundreds of players from around the entire country participate.

The first ever public paintball performance in South Africa was held at the Swartkop Airshow during 2013. More than 80 paintball players took part in a simulated a counter terrorist raid on a weapons dealer.

Since 2009 the largest national speedball league in South Africa is the South African Regional Paintball League (SARPL) having over 500 members during 2014 and hosting both a three-man and five-man series events at one stage in 5 provinces (including Gauteng, Kwazulu Natal, Eastern Cape, Western Cape and the Free State). The league hosted around 31 events per year on a regional and national level with the national finals that usually takes place during the beginning of December each year since its inception in 2013. The SARPL currently uses the NXl Mercy-to format and use their own ruleset based on the NXL rules as well as using the APPA system for player classification.

The South African National Paintball and Airsoft Association (SANPA) is the national body looking after the sport of paintball and airsoft in South Africa and is an active member of the United Paintball Federation (UPBF) and also have committee members on both the ASTM as well as the SABS.

Since 2013 The South African National Paintball and Airsoft Association (SANPA) represented South Africa at the United Paintball Federation (UPBF) World Championship events in the Mens category with SANPA also being fortunate enough, in later years, to send over the first U16, U19, Women&#x27;s and Veterans teams to represent South Africa.

During 2016 The South African National Paintball and Airsoft Association (SANPA) sent over the first U19 team to compete in the United Paintball Federation (UPBF) World Championships where the team missed out going into the finals due to a technicality in the rules which was subsequently updated by the organization to prevent future situations.

During 2018 the South African National Paintball and Airsoft Association (SANPA) sent over the first all female team to compete in the United Paintball Federation (UPBF) World Championships where they won the Women&#x27;s 3-player category and brought South Africa the Gold.

2019 saw the South African National Paintball and Airsoft Association (SANPA) sent over teams in the U16, U19, Women&#x27;s (3 and 5-player) as well as Mens and Veterans Categories to represent South Africa in all the categories at the United Paintball Federation (UPBF) Paintball World Championship.

=== Thailand ===
Thai teams have won the Division 1 Paintball Asia League Series (PALS) World Cup and series titles in year 2012, 2014, and 2015. In 2014, Thai teams made history by taking victories in all Divisions 1, 2, and 3 at the PALS World Cup at Langkawi Island, Malaysia. This trend continued into 2015, with Thai teams taking victories in Divisions 1 and 2 during the PALS World Cup 2015. Along with winning the PALS World Cup titles in 2014 and 2015, all respective teams also took the overall series titles for their respective divisions in 2014 and 2015.

=== Turkey ===
At first, paintball was engaged to the Turkey Shooting and Hunting Federation in 2006, it has grown especially in recent years in Turkey. It has organized at least four tournaments each year in different cities.

Particularly on the European side of Istanbul, there are some paintball areas opened in the last decade.

=== United Arab Emirates ===
Paintball is a growing sport in the United Arab Emirates. Paintball was first introduced in the UAE and the Middle East in 1996. The very first paintball facility was established in Dubai with the technical assistance of some of the best European and American Paintball operators in the industry.

<text>Martha and the Vandellas (known from 1967 to 1972 as Martha Reeves &amp; the Vandellas) were an American girl group formed in Detroit, Michigan in 1957. The group achieved fame in the 1960s as a major act for Motown. Formed by friends Annette Beard, Rosalind Ashford and Gloria Williams, Martha Reeves eventually joined the group, and she became its lead vocalist after Williams&#x27; departure in 1962. The group signed with and eventually recorded all of their singles for Motown&#x27;s Gordy imprint.

The group&#x27;s string of hits included &quot;Come and Get These Memories&quot; (1963), &quot;Heat Wave&quot; (1963), &quot;Quicksand&quot; (1963), &quot;Nowhere to Run&quot; (1965), &quot;Jimmy Mack&quot; (1967), &quot;I&#x27;m Ready for Love&quot; (1968), &quot;Bless You&quot; (1971), and &quot;Dancing in the Street&quot; (1964), the last of which became known as their signature song. During their nine-year run on the charts from 1963 to 1972, Martha and the Vandellas charted over twenty-six hits and recorded in the styles of doo-wop, R&amp;B, pop, blues, rock and roll and soul. Ten Vandellas songs reached the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B singles chart, including two R&amp;B number ones, and six Top Ten hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Selected members of the group were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995 and the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame in 2013.

==History==

===Early years (1957–1962)===
Teenagers Rosalind Ashford and Annette Beard first became acquainted after a local music manager hired them to be members of a girl group he named the Del-Phis. Ashford, Beard, and lead vocalist Gloria Williams, performed at local clubs, private events, church benefits, YMCA events and school functions. They were also being coached by Maxine Powell at Detroit&#x27;s Ferris Center. One of the group&#x27;s first professional engagements was singing background for singer Mike Hanks.

The group originally had up to six members, subsequently reduced to four. When one of the four left the group, she was replaced by Alabama-born vocalist Martha Reeves, a former member of two groups, the Fascinations and the Sabre-Ettes. In 1960, the group signed their first recording contract with Checker Records, releasing the Reeves-led &quot;I&#x27;ll Let You Know&quot;, which flopped. The Del-Phis then went to Checkmate Records, a subsidiary of Chess Records, recording their &quot;There He Is (At My Door)&quot; featuring Williams on lead vocals, which also flopped.

Reeves reverted to a solo artist under the name Martha LaVaille in the hope of getting a contract with emerging Detroit label Motown. After Motown staffer Mickey Stevenson saw Reeves singing at a Detroit club, he offered her an audition. Reeves showed up at Motown&#x27;s Hitsville USA studios on a Tuesday rather than Thursday, Motown&#x27;s usual audition day. Initially upset with Reeves, Stevenson soon assigned her as his secretary eventually responsible for handling Motown&#x27;s auditions. By 1961, the group, now known as The Vels, were recording background vocals for Motown acts. Prior to her success as lead singer of The Elgins, Saundra Edwards (then going by her surname Mallett) recorded the song &quot;Camel Walk&quot;, in 1962, which featured the Vels in background vocals. That year, the quartet began applying background vocals for emerging Motown star Marvin Gaye, singing on Gaye&#x27;s first hit single, &quot;Stubborn Kind of Fellow&quot; After Mary Wells failed to make a scheduled recording session feigning a short illness, the Vels recorded what was initially a demo recording of &quot;I&#x27;ll Have to Let Him Go&quot;. Motown was so impressed by the group&#x27;s vocals – and Martha&#x27;s lead vocals in the song – that the label CEO Berry Gordy offered to give the group a contract. Figuring that being in show business was too rigorous, Williams opted out of the group. With Williams out, the remaining trio of Ashford, Beard and Reeves were told by Gordy that they would need a new name. After failing to come up with a name on their own, Gordy gave the group the name The Vandellas. As stated in an interview with The History Makers, Ashford emphatically states that contrary to popular belief, The Vandellas were not named after Della Reese and Van Dyke Avenue, nor did Reeves come up with the name.

===Motown major hit years (1962–1968)===

Following their signing to Motown&#x27;s Gordy imprint in 1962, the Vandellas struck gold with their second release, the first composition and production from the famed writing team, Holland–Dozier–Holland, titled &quot;Come and Get These Memories&quot;. It became the Vandellas&#x27; first Top 40 recording, reaching number twenty-nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and peaking at number six on the R&amp;B chart. Their second hit, &quot;Heat Wave&quot;, became a phenomenal record for the group, reaching number four on the Hot 100 and hitting number one on the R&amp;B singles chart for five weeks. It became their first million-seller and eventually got the group their only Grammy Award nomination for Best R&amp;B Performance. On the single and album, the song was titled &quot;Heat Wave&quot;. It was sometime later that the song was retitled to avoid confusion with the Irving Berlin song.

The group&#x27;s success continued with their second Top Ten single and third Top 40 single, &quot;Quicksand&quot;, which was another composition with Holland-Dozier-Holland and reached number eight pop in the late fall of 1963. Around that time, Annette, who was pregnant with her first child and set to get married, chose to leave her singing career behind by 1964. Betty Kelly, formerly of the Velvelettes, was brought in shortly afterward to continue the Vandellas&#x27; rise.

The next two singles, &quot;Live Wire&quot; and &quot;In My Lonely Room&quot; (#6 R&amp;B &quot;Cashbox&quot;) were less successful singles, failing to reach the Pop Top 40. However, their next single, &quot;Dancing in the Street&quot;, rose up to No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and also found global success, peaking at No. 21 on the UK Singles Chart in 1964. In 1969, &quot;Dancing in the Street&quot; was re-issued and it was plugged heavily on radio stations. It did not take long for the song to peak at No. 4 in the UK, thus making the song one of the all-time favourite Motown single releases ever. The song became a million-seller, and one of the most played singles in history.

Between 1964 and 1967, singles like &quot;Wild One&quot; (US #34), &quot;Nowhere to Run&quot; (US #8; UK #26), &quot;Love (Makes Me Do Foolish Things)&quot; (US #70; R&amp;B #22), &quot;You&#x27;ve Been in Love Too Long&quot; (US #36), &quot;My Baby Loves Me&quot; (US #22; R&amp;B #3), &quot;I&#x27;m Ready for Love&quot; (US #9; R&amp;B #2; UK #29) and &quot;Jimmy Mack&quot; (US #10; R&amp;B #1; UK #21) kept the Vandellas on the map as one of the label&#x27;s top acts. The Vandellas&#x27; popularity helped the group get spots on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;, &quot;American Bandstand&quot; and &quot;Shindig!&quot;. Throughout this period, the Vandellas had also become one of the label&#x27;s most popular performing acts. On June 28, 1965, the group appeared with several other popular acts of the period on CBS-TV&#x27;s &quot;Murray The K-It&#x27;s What&#x27;s Happening, Baby&quot;. Martha, Rosalind and Betty performed &quot;Nowhere to Run&quot;, as they skipped through a Ford auto plant and sat in a Ford Mustang convertible as it&#x27;s being assembled.

===Personnel changes===
Motown struggled to find good material for many of their acts after the exit of Motown contributor and Reeves&#x27; mentor William &quot;Mickey&quot; Stevenson in 1967 and Holland–Dozier–Holland in early 1968, but after their former collaborators left the label, the Vandellas initially continued to find success with the Richard Morris-produced singles &quot;Love Bug Leave My Heart Alone&quot; (US #25; R&amp;B #14) and &quot;Honey Chile&quot; (US #11; UK #30; R&amp;B #5) added to their already extended list of charted singles. In the summer of 1968, the group joined The Supremes, The Temptations, The Four Tops and Marvin Gaye in performing at the Copacabana though much like albums from the Four Tops and Gaye, a live album of their performance there was shelved indefinitely.

That same year, label changes had started to take effect, and Gordy focused much of his attention on building the Supremes&#x27; as well as Diana Ross&#x27; burgeoning upcoming solo career that would follow in 1970. The Vandellas&#x27; chart performance (and the chart performance of many Motown acts with the exception of Marvin Gaye, The Temptations, and Stevie Wonder) suffered as a result.

However it was the infighting among the members of the Vandellas that led to their problems. Kelly was the first to be let go after reportedly missing shows, as well as getting into altercations with Reeves. There were many instances where these &quot;fights&quot; happened on stage. Kelly was fired in 1967 and was replaced by Martha Reeves&#x27; sister Lois. Simultaneously, the group&#x27;s name was officially changed to &quot;Martha Reeves and the Vandellas&quot;, to conform with the company&#x27;s recent changes of The Supremes&#x27; and The Miracles&#x27; names to reflect their featured lead singers. During this time, Vandellas records including &quot;(We&#x27;ve Got) Honey Love&quot;, &quot;Sweet Darlin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Taking My Love and Leaving Me&quot; were issued as singles with diminishing success.

===&quot;Bless You&quot; (1969–1972)===
Reeves, out of the group temporarily due to illness, recovered and returned; Ashford was replaced by another former member of the Velvelettes, Sandra Tilley, and the group continued to release albums and singles into the early 1970s. Although they could not reignite the fire they had made in America they continued to have successful records in the UK and abroad. Among their late 1960s hits was &quot;I Can&#x27;t Dance to That Music You&#x27;re Playing&quot;, which featured singer Syreeta Wright singing the chorus, and peaked at number forty-two. Reeves reportedly hated singing the song sensing it &quot;close to home&quot;. In 1969 a reissue of &quot;Nowhere To Run&quot; reached the top 40 in the UK. In 1970, the group issued Motown&#x27;s first protest single, the controversial anti-war song, &quot;I Should Be Proud&quot;, which peaked at a modest forty-five on the R&amp;B singles chart. The song was uncharacteristic of the Vandellas and did nothing to promote the group. On some stations, the flip-side &quot;Love, Guess Who&quot; was played instead, however the group reached the top 20 that year in the UK with a reissue of &quot;Jimmy Mack&quot;.

In 1971, the group scored a top 11 hit in the UK with &quot;Forget Me Not&quot;. later that year they scored an international hit with &quot;Bless You&quot; (produced by the Jackson 5&#x27;s producers The Corporation). The song peaked at number fifty-three on the American pop singles chart (the biggest peak of Vandellas&#x27; seventies singles in the US), and number twenty-nine on the R&amp;B singles chart. &quot;Bless You&quot; reached number thirty-three in the UK giving the group two big hits that year in England. . &quot;Bless You&quot; reached number 16 in Canada and went all the way to number 2 in Puerto Rico . It was to be the last Billboard Hot 100 hit single for the group. After two successive Top 40 R&amp;B singles, the ballad &quot;In and Out of My Life&quot; (#22 US R&amp;B) and the Marvin Gaye cover, &quot;Tear It On Down&quot; (#37 US R&amp;B), the group disbanded following a farewell concert, held at Detroit&#x27;s Cobo Hall on December 21, 1972, but Martha Reeves is still often billed as &#x27;Martha Reeves &amp; The Vandellas&#x27;.

The next year, Reeves announced plans of starting a solo career. At the same time, Motown Records moved its operations to Los Angeles. When Reeves did not want to move, she negotiated out of her contract with Motown, signing with MCA in 1974, and releasing the critically acclaimed self-titled debut album, &quot;Martha Reeves&quot;. Despite rave reviews of her work, neither of Reeves&#x27; post-Vandellas/Motown recordings produced the same success as they had the decade before. After living what she called &quot;a rock &amp; roll lifestyle&quot; of prescription pills, cocaine and alcohol, Reeves sobered up in 1977, overcoming her addictions and becoming a born-again Christian.

==Epilogue==
After the Vandellas&#x27; split, Reeves&#x27; sister Lois sang with the group Quiet Elegance and sang background for Al Green, while Tilley retired from show business in 1972, suddenly dying of a brain aneurysm in 1983 at the age of thirty-seven. Original member Gloria Williams, who retired from show business when she left the group, died in 2000. In 1978, Reeves and original Vandellas Ashford and Beard reunited at a Los Angeles benefit concert for actor Will Geer. In 1983, Reeves successfully sued for royalties from her Motown hits and the label agreed to have the songs credited as &quot;Martha Reeves and the Vandellas&quot; from then on. That year, Reeves performed solo at &quot;Motown 25&quot;, which alongside some of their songs being placed on the &quot;Big Chill&quot; soundtrack, helped Reeves and the Vandellas gain a new audience. In 1989, original members Ashford and Beard also sued Motown for royalties. During this time, the original trio were inspired to reunite both as a recording act and in performances. They were offered a recording contract with Ian Levine at Motorcity Records who issued the group&#x27;s first single since the Vandellas disbanded seventeen years earlier called &quot;Step into My Shoes&quot;.

Although they are no longer singing together full-time, Martha Reeves and the Vandellas have occasionally reunited for various concerts. Currently, Ashford, whose full name now is Rosalind Ashford-Holmes, and Beard, whose full name now is Annette Beard-Helton, continue to perform with other singers, most notably Roschelle Laughhunn, as &quot;The Original Vandellas&quot;. Reeves, with her sisters Lois and Delphine Reeves, tour as &quot;Martha Reeves and the Vandellas&quot;.

From 2005 to 2009, Reeves held the eighth seat of Detroit&#x27;s city council. She has since lost her seat and told the press that she would continue performing.

A remake of the song &quot;Nowhere To Run&quot;, sung by Arnold McCuller, is heard in the film &quot;The Warriors&quot; during the scene in which the Gramercy Riffs call a hit on the Warriors.

In a Season One episode of the television show &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, Blanche described her car as the &quot;noisiest thing to come out of Detroit since Martha &amp; The Vandellas.&quot;

Candice Bergen, who hosted the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; episode on which Martha Reeves appeared in its inaugural season, made sure that Martha Reeves and the Vandellas were a presence throughout her &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; series. The group&#x27;s picture was displayed prominently in Murphy&#x27;s office. When Aretha Franklin guest starred and Murphy tried to sing with her, Franklin stopped her, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m not Martha, and you ain&#x27;t no Vandella.&quot;

The group is briefly portrayed in the 2017 film &quot;Detroit&quot;, performing &quot;Nowhere to Run&quot; at the Fox Theatre in Detroit.

<text>24-7 Spyz (pronounced &quot;twenty-four-seven spies&quot;) are an American rock band from the South Bronx, New York, formed in 1986, originally consisting of Jimi Hazel (born Wayne K. Richardson) (guitars), Rick Skatore (born Kenneth D. Lucas) (bass), Kindu Phibes (drums), and P. Fluid (born Peter Forrest) (vocals). The band plays hard rock, heavy metal, funk metal and rap metal songs which incorporate elements of jazz, R&amp;B, soul, reggae and hardcore punk. The fact that they are African Americans playing variations of heavy metal led critics to compare them to bands such as Living Colour and Bad Brains. After several lineup changes, the band broke up in 1998, but reformed in 2003 before releasing their first new album of original material in over a decade in 2006. As of 2021, the lineup of the band includes Hazel, Skatore, and drummer Tobias Ralph.

==Band history==
===Early days and In-Effect Records===
Upon their formation in 1986, the band, consisting of Jimi Hazel, Rick Skatore, Kindu Phibes, and P. Fluid, quickly earned a dedicated following in New York City due to the eclectic mix of their music. The band would switch gears from Motown and soul sounds with lush vocal harmonies to violent heavy metal and hardcore punk with ease, sometimes several times within the course of one song. Phibes left the band in 1987.

In 1988, In-Effect Records, a subsidiary of Relativity, signed the band which now included Anthony Johnson, formerly of the three-piece New York ska band, A-Kings, replacing Phibes on drums. The band released their debut album, the genre-hopping &quot;Harder Than You&quot;, produced by Bob Musso and Jimi Hazel, in December 1988. The first single was a cover of the Kool &amp; the Gang song &quot;Jungle Boogie.&quot; Critics and fans took notice of the band&#x27;s left-wing political stance and the unique sound of their tight-knit, high-energy music. The album sold just under 300,000 units due to non-stop touring worldwide and became an underground hit. It remains a pioneering classic in the rock/funk/hip hop genre made popular in later years by such bands as 311, Limp Bizkit, and Kid Rock. The video for &quot;Jungle Boogie&quot; was the first single video on MTV to air on all of the following specialty shows: &quot;120 Minutes&quot;, &quot;Yo! MTV Raps&quot;, &quot;Hard 60&quot;, and &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;.

The band&#x27;s second album, 1990&#x27;s &quot;Gumbo Millennium&quot;, produced by Jimi Hazel and Tom Soares, was once again released through In-Effect Records. The album was much softer than the previous effort, focusing mostly on clean guitar and lush R&amp;B harmonies and grooves although it still contained elements of thrash metal and punk. The first single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Break My Heart!,&quot; while commercially viable, failed to receive radio airplay. Regardless, the album sold over 300,000 units once again due to massive amounts of touring and proved to be an underground success. It soon brought the attention of several major labels. The band were soon opening for Jane&#x27;s Addiction on their &#x27;Ritual De Lo Habitual&#x27; tour. The tour brought the band to a new audience but their growing success could not halt the sudden departure of Anthony Johnson and P. Fluid. Fluid made the announcement of his departure during the band&#x27;s live performance on the final date of the Jane&#x27;s Addiction tour. Allegedly, he had not made it known to his bandmates beforehand. Johnson followed suit and, as a result of the departures, the band dropped out of a planned co-headlining tour with Suicidal Tendencies. Fluid soon made it known that he intended to start a new band named The P. Fluid Foundation.
===East West Records America===
Despite the loss of two of the band&#x27;s four members, Rick Skatore and Jimi Hazel decided to continue on. Jeff Brodnax was brought in as the new vocalist along with former Cro-Mags and Bad Brains drummer, Mackie Jayson. Jayson only rehearsed with the band for a short time before leaving, to be replaced by Joel Maitoza. The new lineup received rave reviews and the band was soon signed to East West Records America, a division of Atlantic Records headed by label president, Sylvia Rhone. The company tested the marketability of the new band by releasing a five-song EP titled &quot;This is...24-7 Spyz!&quot;, produced by Jimi Hazel and Bruce Calder in 1991.

In 1992, the band received their largest commercial exposure to date by appearing in a Budweiser television commercial that aired for the first five months of the year. Soon after, the hour-long &quot;Strength In Numbers&quot; album, produced by Terry Date and Jimi Hazel, was released and proved to be the band&#x27;s most critically acclaimed release to date. The album saw the band depart from its New York hardcore roots to concentrate more on heavy metal and soul. Unfortunately, by that time, popular music had begun shifting away from musical dexterity and in favor of the simplicity of grunge. The album&#x27;s single, &quot;Break The Chains,&quot; received minor radio airplay and MTV exposure but Sylvia Rhone pulled the label&#x27;s support before dropping the band altogether. To the band&#x27;s dismay, the label only pressed 18,000 pieces and allotted 2,000 for press purposes, thus making the disc widely unavailable almost immediately.

Disgusted by their dealings with East West and Sylvia Rhone, the band members began working on other musical projects. Hazel and Skatore looked to form a new band, Black Angus, with Follow for Now drummer Bernard &quot;Enrique&quot; Coley. The Black Angus sessions were eventually recorded with drummer and longtime friend Carlton Smith of the Royal Crescent Mob. Maitoza formed Shockhead with vocalist Joseph McCraw and Nixons bassist Ricky Wolking, recording one disc, titled &quot;Television&quot;, which was produced by Jimi Hazel. Brodnax concentrated on his band, Egypt.

===The Enemy Label===
When Hazel and Skatore discovered how popular the first two albums remained in Europe, they reunited with Anthony Johnson and P. Fluid, now performing as Forrest (his real last name) to release &quot;Temporarily Disconnected&quot;, produced by Jimi Hazel. The album was released exclusively in Europe by Enemy Records, and was followed by a quick tour of the continent before Johnson and Fluid left the band once again.

In March 1996, &quot;6&quot;, produced by Jimi Hazel, was released exclusively in Europe through the Enemy label. The album contained covers of The Association&#x27;s &quot;Along Comes Mary&quot; and Love&#x27;s &quot;7 and 7 Is.&quot; The album was titled &quot;6&quot; due to it being the sixth release by the band. In September 1996, What Are Records released &quot;Heavy Metal Soul by the Pound&quot;, the American version of &quot;6&quot;. The track listing would remain almost identical to &quot;6&quot; with the exception of the removal of &quot;Along Comes Mary&quot; and &quot;7 and 7 Is&quot; and the additions of &quot;Earth And Sky&quot; and &quot;Save The World&quot; as replacements. Both versions of the album saw the band returning as a trio with Jimi Hazel on guitar and lead vocals, Rick Skatore on bass and Joel Maitoza returning to the drums for the first time in four years. Two tracks recorded before Maitoza&#x27;s return featured guest drummer Carlton Smith. Additional vocals were contributed by Doug Pinnick of King&#x27;s X for the songs &quot;Love And Peace&quot; and &quot;Yeah X 3&quot;. The 1997 tour to support the album featured Matt Martin on drums.

In 1997, the &quot;If I Could&quot; EP, featuring remixes and live performances recorded while Maitoza was still a member, was released exclusively through the band&#x27;s fan club. In 1998, a disagreement between Hazel and Skatore led to the dissolution of 24-7 Spyz. In the months prior to the breakup, drummer Tony Lewis had been performing with the band.

===Solo albums and reformations===
In 2000, Hazel co-wrote several songs for a band named Crime, who were using the material to shop for labels. Skatore re-emerged in 2001, playing bass in a band named Blockk-16 alongside Savatage guitarist Chris Caffery. The band&#x27;s first release, &quot;Too Brutal For Radio&quot; also featured appearances by Andrew Freeman, Ray Freeman Jr, Mosh Ben-Ari, Ronen Barak and Spread Eagle vocalist, Ray West. After the release of the album, Skatore suffered from a collapsed lung. Despite their prior disagreement, Hazel came to the aid of his friend by performing together as 24-7 Spyz for a benefit concert at New York City&#x27;s CBGB&#x27;s. Proceeds from the show went towards Skatore&#x27;s medical bills.

In 2002, Hazel released his first solo CD, &quot;21stCenturySouthBronxRockStar&quot; on his own label, The Gumbo Recording Company. It was followed by the formation of Maitoza&#x27;s new band, Crown 10, in May 2003. 2003 also saw Hazel and Skatore reunite for a second CBGB&#x27;s performance with Tony Lewis on drums. Later that year, Hazel and Skatore would announce the official re-formation of 24-7 Spyz. In 2005, the band released a limited edition DVD titled &quot;HMS4L: The Many Lives of Walter Rattamus&quot; through their website. The DVD tells the history of the band through the various incarnations and also includes commentary from Jimi Hazel and Rick Skatore.

In 2006, the band released &quot;Face the Day&quot;, with new drummer Tobias Ralph, through The Gumbo Recording Company label. The disc was produced by Jimi Hazel and Ron &quot;Bumblefoot&quot; Thal and was the first 24-7-Spyz studio album in a decade. Shortly thereafter, the band released a live performance, recorded months before the band had split up in 1998, as a digital download and CD titled &quot;Can You Hear the Sound?&quot;.

In 2009, Hazel and Skatore began focusing their attention on a new side project called A.N.M. (Anti Nigger Machine). Other members of the band included Doug Pinnick (vocals), Greg Fulton (guitar and vocals), Spacey T (guitar and vocals) plus Philip &quot;Fish&quot; Fisher (drums and percussion). Later that year, they released a four-song demo via their MySpace page. In 2010, the band began soliciting donations to fund the recording of their first album.

On August 6, 2011, 24-7 Spyz performed at the Highline Ballroom in New York City. The show saw former members Jeff Brodnax and Joel Maitoza return for a reunion of the &quot;Strength in Numbers&quot; era lineup. In November 2011, the band announced that the lineup would continue performing together with the &quot;Strength In Numbers Twentieth Anniversary Tour&quot; beginning with a string of European dates from late February through March 2012. In September 2012, it was announced that the band had officially parted ways with Brodnax and Maitoza once again. It was also stated that Maitoza, Ralph and Lewis would all take part in recording drum tracks for a planned upcoming album. In November 2012, the band announced that Sekou Lumumba of Bedouin Soundclash had officially joined the band on drums. Guitarist Ronny Drayton would join the band soon after. On April 27, 2014, an image posted by the band on their official Facebook page stated that the band was on hiatus. In October 2014, the band announced via their official Facebook page that Phillip &quot;Fish&quot; Fisher, a founding member of Fishbone, had taken the position as drummer for the band. In January 2015, it was officially announced that the band had emerged from their self-imposed hiatus with plans to not only perform select dates in Europe but also to release a single and a new EP later in the year. The digital single, &quot;Jungle (for Jef)&quot; was credited as 24-7 Spyz &amp; Family and featured a core lineup of Hazel and Drayton alongside drummer Lenny White and bassist Chico Huff, with additional instrumentation performed by Jesse Johnson, Eddie Martinez, Vernon Reid and Skatore. The song was a tribute to Jef Lee Johnson, a friend and fellow musician who had died in 2013 at age 54 due to complications from pneumonia and diabetes, and was released via iTunes and SoundCloud. The band&#x27;s next release came in April 2016 in the form of CD and digital single for a song titled &quot;Anthem&quot; that would also be featured on their upcoming album. It was announced in 2017 that &quot;The Soundtrack To The Innermost Galaxy&quot; was expected to be released in 2018. In April 2018, the band started accepting pledges through PledgeMusic.com to fund the release of the album although a release date has yet to be announced. At Fishbone&#x27;s August 24, 2018 Brooklyn, New York show, a three-piece version of the band consisting of Hazel, Skatore and Fish performed a short, unannounced opening set. On January 28, 2019, &quot;The Soundtrack to the Innermost Galaxy&quot;, their eighth studio album, was released.

In January 2020, a three-piece version of the band featuring Hazel, Skatore and Tony Lewis, replacing Fisher who had returned to the Fishbone lineup, announced their &quot;Sex, Juice &amp; Heavy Metal Soul&quot; tour which was scheduled to run from April through October 2020. However, the tour was postponed indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On February 7, 2020, Ronnie Drayton died of Non Hodgkins Lymphoma at the age of 67.

In September 2021, the band&#x27;s Facebook page indicated that Hazel and Skatore were once again working on new music with Tobias Ralph playing drums. In October 2022, the band released a digital single, via Bandcamp, titled &quot;Angels &amp; Demons.&quot; The track features guest vocalists Ryan Bland of New York hardcore band Ache, and Corinne Drewery of Swing Out Sister.

===Activity of former members===

Anthony Johnson reappeared as the drummer for the band Middle Man before moving on to perform a lead role in the Off-Broadway production of &quot;Stomp&quot;. He was also featured in the HBO film &quot;Stomp Out Loud&quot;. While performing in Stomp, Johnson was recruited to play drums for Japanese pop star, Bonnie Pink. Johnson relocated to Japan where he lived and toured with the band for a time. He was named as the drummer for Ben Folds during a tour supporting Folds&#x27; solo album, &quot;Rockin&#x27; the Suburbs&quot;. In 2005, he made an appearance on the self-titled, five-song release by Lost Tricks, a band fronted by actor Trevor Oswalt. He has also performed with artists such as Eagle-Eye Cherry, Dionne Farris and Vanessa Daou. Johnson lives in New York City where he continues to participate in music, as a member of The Morning After Girls, and theatre.

P. Fluid and the P. Fluid Foundation performed in clubs in and around New York City but never released an album. Shortly after leaving 24-7 Spyz for the second time, P. Fluid, now using the name Forrest Thinner, formed BlkVampires. The band released a five-song EP titled &quot;The Collector&#x27;s Item&quot; through the Catch A Fire website. These five songs had previously been recorded by 24-7 Spyz and released on &quot;Temporarily Disconnected&quot;. In 2005, the New York City based band released their debut, self-titled album, compiling seven previously unreleased tracks as well as the five songs previously included on &quot;The Collector&#x27;s Item&quot; EP. In 2010, the band released a follow-up ten-song EP/DVD titled &quot;Blkcula&quot;. A five-song release, titled &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Music&quot;, followed in 2012. Also in 2012, Thinner was the creative director and publisher of a book titled &quot;The HarlequinX&quot;. The book, based on a short film and characters created by Thinner, was written by CJ Cassidy and edited by Hector Valle. Thinner also appeared in the film &quot;Riot on the Dance Floor&quot;, a documentary about City Gardens, a nightclub formerly located in Trenton, New Jersey. In 2015, the band released the two-song &quot;Eric Garner&quot; EP. In 2019, Thinner announced that BlkVampires had broken up and that he was embarking on his first solo project, BlkVampiresX. In 2022, BlkVampiresX released the single &quot;Bike Ride in Manhattan/La Flaca Negra&quot;, produced by Swedish guitarist Apollo Kris. On January 13, 2025, Peter Forrest was found beaten to death in the back of an ambulette he had been driving in the Bronx. He was 64.

Joel Maitoza has continued playing drums with bands such as Crown 10, Shockhead, Headtrip Superstar, Don Lithgow, Sahara, Seventrain and Kerry Conally. He remains heavily involved in session work, songwriting and producing and has appeared on a total of 22 albums as of 2016. From 2000 to 2006, Maitoza managed the thrash-groove metal act Brick Bath on the Pavement/Crash Music label. In 2007, Maitoza began working with French guitarist, Christophe Godin. Maitoza reunited with 24-7 Spyz in 2011 for a reunion of the &quot;Strength in Numbers&quot; lineup and continued to tour with the band through 2012 for the band&#x27;s European tour dates. In September 2012, it was announced that Maitoza and the band had parted ways again, but that Maitoza would contribute drum tracks to the band&#x27;s planned 2013 album along with other previous Spyz drummers. In 2013, Maitoza joined the hard rock band, Seventrain, which also features former members of Cage and Tourniquet. Their self-titled debut album, produced by Maitoza, was released in 2014, along with a video for the single &quot;Bittersweet Seduction.&quot; The band was nominated for Best Hard Rock Album of the Year at the 2014 San Diego Music Awards and charted on the CMJ Top 40 Loud Rock chart in February 2014. Seventrain released their second album, titled &quot;Back on Track&quot;, also produced by Maitoza, in 2019. Maitoza parted with Seventrain in early 2019 citing irreconcilable differences. In early 2020, Maitoza announced his solo project called The Frequency Conspiracy and released two singles and accompanying videos of cover versions of &quot;Rock Candy&quot; by Montrose and &quot;Carry On Wayward Son&quot; by Kansas. In September 2020, Maitoza was putting finishing touches on an album of cover tunes titled &quot;Quarantine Covers&quot;. The album features vocalist Andrew Freeman (Last in Line, Lynch Mob), bassist Jaimie Scott (Tyketto), bassist Rick Skatore, guitarist Joshua Jones (Poster Child), guitarist Christophe Godin (Mörglbl, The Prize), guitarist Craig Soderberg (Shockhead, -ITIS) and guitarist Jason (JMR) Richardson (Year of the Dragon, David Pastorius), and is slated to be released in early 2021. A self-titled, full-length album of original material will be released as well.

Jeff Brodnax went on to join the band Egypt. During his time with the band, they released two albums, &quot;Drowning in the Promised Land&quot; and &quot;Soul Hammer&quot;. The singer later released a solo album titled &quot;Acoustic EP&quot; in 2002. It was followed in 2009 by an album titled &quot;Forcing Me To Bend&quot; which he continues to support through touring. Like Maitoza, Brodnax reunited with 24-7 Spyz in 2011 and continued to tour with the band through 2012 for the band&#x27;s European tour dates. In September 2012, it was announced that Brodnax had parted with the band for a second time. In 2019, Jeff announced the formation of his new band, The Soulvation Society.

<text>Consensus democracy is the application of consensus decision-making and supermajority to the process of legislation in a democracy. It is characterized by a decision-making structure that involves and takes into account as broad a range of opinions as possible, as opposed to majoritarian democracy systems where minority opinions can potentially be ignored by vote-winning majorities. Constitutions typically require consensus or supermajority.

A consensus government is a national unity government with representation across the whole political spectrum. A concordance democracy is a type of consensus democracy where majority rule does not play a central role. Optional referendums and popular initiatives correspond to consensus democracy.

==Examples==
Consensus democracy is most closely embodied in certain countries such as Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Denmark, Lebanon, Sweden, Iraq, and Belgium, where consensus is an important feature of political culture, particularly with a view to preventing the domination of one linguistic or cultural group in the political process. The term consociational state is used in political science to describe countries with such consensus based political systems. An example of such a system could be the Dutch Poldermodel.
Many parties in Lebanon call for applying consensus democracy, especially at times of crisis.

Tripartism applies consensus democracy to economic policy by fostering social dialogue between opposing interest groups, primarily national trade unions and employers&#x27; organizations.

Consensus government chiefly arises in non-partisan democracies and similar systems in which a majority of politicians are independent. Many former British territories with large indigenous populations use consensus government to fuse traditional tribal leadership with the Westminster system. Consensus government in Canada is used in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, as well as the autonomous Nunatsiavut region, and similar systems have arisen in the Pacific island nations of Fiji, Tuvalu and Vanuatu, as well as the ancient Tynwald of the Isle of Man.

==Electoral systems==
The Borda count tends to elect broadly-acceptable options or candidates (rather than consistently following the preferences of a majority).

<text>Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips were an American R&amp;B, soul, and funk family music group from Atlanta, Georgia, that remained active on the music charts and performing circuit for over three decades starting from the early 1950s.

Starting out as simply The Pips in 1952, derived from a cousin&#x27;s nickname, the founding members were Gladys Knight, brother Merald &quot;Bubba&quot; Knight, sister Brenda Knight and cousins Eleanor Guest and William Guest. After a couple of years performing in talent shows, the group signed with Brunswick Records in 1957, recording a couple of singles that failed to chart. Brenda Knight and Eleanor Guest eventually left the group and were replaced by another cousin, Edward Patten, and a non-relative, Langston George in 1959. This lineup produced the group&#x27;s first hit single, &quot;Every Beat of My Heart&quot;. After the single was released on three different labels, they changed their name to &quot;Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips&quot; in 1961. Langston George left the same year and Gladys Knight left in 1962 to start a family with musician Jimmy Newman. Knight rejoined in 1964 and this lineup continued until the group&#x27;s disbandment in 1989.

The group reached commercial success after signing with Motown Records in 1966. After a year and a half, the group recorded the first hit single version of &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot; in 1967, which led to several hit singles for Motown&#x27;s Soul Records label, including &quot;Nitty Gritty&quot;, &quot;Friendship Train&quot;, &quot;If I Were Your Woman&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Do Wrong&quot; and the Grammy-winning &quot;Neither One of Us (Wants to Be the First to Say Goodbye)&quot;, before leaving the label for Buddah Records in 1973. At Buddah, they recorded the hits &quot;Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got to Use My Imagination&quot;, &quot;I Feel a Song (In My Heart)&quot; and their Grammy-winning and number-one hit single, &quot;Midnight Train to Georgia&quot;. In 1974, they recorded the soundtrack to the successful film &quot;Claudine&quot; with producer Curtis Mayfield, which included the songs &quot;On and On&quot;, &quot;The Makings of You&quot; and &quot;Make Yours a Happy Home&quot;. Contractual difficulties with their labels forced the group to record side projects from 1977 until 1980 when they signed with Columbia Records. Later hits included &quot;Landlord&quot;, &quot;Save the Overtime (For Me)&quot; and the Grammy-winning single &quot;Love Overboard&quot;. In 1989, the group disbanded with the Pips retiring and Knight embarking on a successful solo career.

Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips are multiple Grammy and American Music Award winners and are inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1996 and 2001 respectively.

==History==
===Early years (1952–1961)===
Gladys Knight performed on Ted Mack&#x27;s &quot;Original Amateur Hour&quot; in 1952 at the age of eight, winning first prize. On September 4, 1952, Gladys, Bubba, sister Brenda and their cousins William and Eleanor Guest began performing together during Bubba&#x27;s tenth birthday party after a record player malfunctioned. Shortly afterwards, the quintet agreed to form a group under the insistence of Gladys&#x27; mother Elizabeth Knight. They settled on the name The Pips, inspired by the nickname of their cousin James &quot;Pip&quot; Woods. By 1955, the group began performing on the talent show circuit in their hometown of Atlanta, winning each talent show they entered. This success allowed them to get a record contract with Brunswick Records in 1957. At Brunswick, the group released two recordings that failed to chart. Despite this, the group was now opening for top recording acts such as Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke.

By 1959, Brunswick dropped the group and both Brenda Knight and Eleanor Guest left the group to begin families. They were replaced by another cousin, Edward Patten, and a friend, Langston George. Patten and George were involved in another group before joining the Pips. 

===Early success (1961–1965)===
In 1961, the Pips recorded the Johnny Otis-penned &quot;Every Beat of My Heart&quot;. Because the group was without a record label, a local Atlanta label, Huntom Records, pushed the single and got a distribution deal with Vee-Jay Records to release the single. During this time, the group moved to New York where they auditioned for Bobby Robinson&#x27;s Fury Records. Upon learning that &quot;Every Beat of My Heart&quot; was already becoming a hit and cutting the group out of profits, Robinson had the group re-record the song and re-release it on Fury Records. Both versions made the Billboard charts, with the Huntom/Vee-Jay version reaching number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Prior to the re-release on Fury Records, the group changed their name to Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips. Later in 1961, the newly christened quintet released the single, &quot;Letter Full of Tears&quot;, which became another top 40 hit in early 1962. After a string of single releases on Fury Records, Langston George left the group in 1962.

The group&#x27;s success was halted by Gladys Knight&#x27;s sudden departure in 1962 to start a family with husband Jimmy Newman, a musician. Knight gave birth to the couple&#x27;s son James Gaston Newman III in August 1962. A daughter, Kenya Maria Newman, was born in November 1963. During this period, the Pips kept performing and recording to little fanfare, and eventually each Pip took odd jobs while Gladys Knight began performing solo with Newman, now her musical director. Eventually Gladys reunited with the Pips and signed with a local New York label, Maxx Records, that year. During that time, Newman served as the group&#x27;s musical director. During this period, the group were mentored by Maurice King and Cholly &quot;Pops&quot; Atkins; their association with King going back to the group&#x27;s early years traveling to Detroit. The group recorded a third top 40 single with Van McCoy&#x27;s &quot;Giving Up&quot; in 1964. Other notable songs they released on Maxx on the &quot;Gladys Knight and the Pips&quot; album include &quot;Lovers Always Forgive&quot;, &quot;(There Will Never Be) Another Love&quot;, &quot;Either Way I Lose&quot;, &quot;Go Away, Stay Away&quot;, &quot;Maybe Maybe Baby&quot;, &quot;&quot;Stop and Get a Hold of Myself&quot;, &quot;Who Knows? (I Just Can&#x27;t Trust You)&quot; and &quot;If I Should Ever Fall in Love&quot;.

The group developed a reputation for exciting and polished live performances, that enabled them to work even without the benefit of bestselling records. Choreographer Atkins designed &quot;fast-stepping&quot; dance routines that became a signature of the Pips&#x27; stage presentation; Atkins later described his working and personal relationship with the group in his autobiography, &quot;Class Act: The Jazz Life of Choreographer Cholly Atkins&quot;: &quot;The one thing that I was pleased about was a stipulation in my contract that allowed me to keep working with Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips as personal clients even though I would be an employee of Motown Records. To tell the truth, Gordy wasn&#x27;t too happy about it at first, but this is something that I would not compromise under any circumstances. By that time, Gladys and the guys were like my own children!&quot;

===Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips join Motown Records (1966–1973)===
By the end of 1965, Berry Gordy was scouting to get the group signed to his Motown label. Knight initially refused to sign due to her fears that the label would overlook them for the more popular artists on his roster, but she was outvoted by the Pips. They would sign with Motown in 1966, being assigned to Motown&#x27;s Soul Records label, a label which featured acts who had more of an R&amp;B flavor than a pop one. Their first Motown single, &quot;Just Walk in My Shoes&quot;, was a hit in the UK, but the group was disappointed in Motown having The Andantes sing over the Pips&#x27; signature harmony in the song, resulting in the group demanding that the Andantes not be featured on anymore of the group&#x27;s recordings. They also were one of the few Motown acts that did not regularly perform on the label&#x27;s Motortown Revues, with an exception being a Christmas showcase at the Fox Theater in Detroit, recorded for the album, &quot;Motortown Revue Live&quot;. A second single, &quot;Take Me in Your Arms and Love Me&quot;, also reached the charts in the UK.
Their third single, &quot;Everybody Needs Love&quot;, became the group&#x27;s first American charted single in two years, reaching number 39 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number three R&amp;B after its release in 1967. On the A&amp;E Network television program &quot;Biography&quot;, Knight stated that she and the Pips were regarded as a second-string act, and that &quot;Diana (Ross) &amp; the Supremes, The Temptations, and Marvin Gaye were given all the hits, while we took the leftovers.&quot; In Knight&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Between Each Line of Pain and Glory: My Life Story&quot;, she stated that Diana Ross had the group removed from being The Supremes&#x27; opening act on a 1968 tour for, according to Knight, being &#x27;too good&#x27;. The group finally scored a career breakthrough with their fourth Motown single, &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot;, which reached number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the R&amp;B chart. The group&#x27;s recording became Motown&#x27;s bestselling single ever to that point, selling over 2.5 million copies. Marvin Gaye&#x27;s version of the song, released in 1968, outsold the group&#x27;s version, selling four million copies and reaching number one on the Hot 100. While at Motown in 1968, Knight was the first person to suggest that Berry Gordy sign the up-and-coming group called The Jackson Five (though Bobby Taylor of the Vancouvers also had a role), after appearing with them on a concert held in Gary, Indiana, to help elect Mayor Richard Hatcher, despite the claim that Diana Ross discovered them.

Following the success of &quot;Grapevine&quot;, the group worked frequently with Norman Whitfield. Whitfield produced them the hits, &quot;The End of Our Road&quot;, &quot;It Should&#x27;ve Been Me&quot;, &quot;Friendship Train&quot;, &quot;Nitty Gritty&quot; and &quot;You Need Love Like I Do (Don&#x27;t You)&quot;. They also recorded Ashford &amp; Simpson&#x27;s &quot;Didn&#x27;t You Know (You&#x27;d Have To Cry Sometime)&quot; in 1969. They scored their second million-selling Motown single with the ballad &quot;If I Were Your Woman&quot; in 1970. Another ballad, the self-composed &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Do Wrong&quot;, became another million-selling single. Both singles were featured on their first number one album, also titled &quot;If I Were Your Woman&quot;. In late 1971, they released a soulful version of Kris Kristofferson&#x27;s &quot;Help Me Make It Through the Night&quot;, which became an international hit. The group released the Jim Weatherly ballad, &quot;Neither One of Us (Wants to Be the First to Say Goodbye)&quot;, in December 1972, the single would become their last single released while still with the label. As the single was charting, the group tried to negotiate a better contract with Motown. Negotiations fell through weeks later and, in February 1973, the group left Motown and signed with Buddah Records. &quot;Neither One of Us&quot; became their biggest selling single at Motown, reaching number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and winning the group a Grammy for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.

===Taking the &quot;Midnight Train&quot; to Buddah Records (1973–1980)===
Following the signing with Buddah Records, the label issued another Weatherly ballad, &quot;Where Peaceful Waters Flow&quot;, released around the same time &quot;Neither One of Us&quot; and a Motown single, &quot;Daddy Could Swear, I Declare&quot;, was charting. The song became a modest success as a result. The group reached its popular and critical peak soon afterwards, starting with the release of another Weatherly song, &quot;Midnight Train to Georgia&quot;, in August 1973. The song eventually hit number one on both the Billboard Hot 100 and R&amp;B singles charts, becoming their signature song.

They followed that single with the release of the million-selling album, &quot;Imagination&quot;, which released two more top ten singles, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got to Use My Imagination&quot; and &quot;Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me&quot;. The release of &quot;Imagination&quot; sparked a consecutive series of million-selling albums for the label including the soundtrack to the movie, &quot;Claudine&quot;; &quot;I Feel a Song&quot; and &quot;2nd Anniversary&quot;. In 1975, the group scored a mid-season variety series, &quot;The Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips Show&quot;, that aired for four episodes on NBC. During this time, the group recorded more hit singles, including &quot;I Feel a Song (In My Heart)&quot;, &quot;Part-Time Love&quot;, &quot;Love Finds Its Own Way&quot; and the live recording, &quot;The Way We Were/Try to Remember&quot;.

By 1977, the group ran into contract disputes with both Motown and Buddah Records. After asking to be released from their contract from Buddah, the label forced the band to record side projects while the dispute was settled. Between 1978 and 1980, Knight released two solo albums and the Pips released two side albums. In a segment for Richard Pryor&#x27;s TV special, the Pips (minus Gladys) appeared on his show performing their backup verses for the songs &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot; and &quot;Midnight Train to Georgia&quot;; during parts where Gladys would sing, the camera panned on a lone-standing microphone. The group still performed together during this period, which ended with the group signing with Columbia Records in 1980.

===Later years and disbandment (1980–1989)===
In 1980, having signed with Columbia, the group reunited with their old Motown collaborators Ashford &amp; Simpson, recording and releasing the album, &quot;About Love&quot;, which included the charted singles &quot;Taste of Bitter Love&quot;, &quot;Bourgie, Bourgie&quot; and &quot;Landlord&quot;. They continued the collaboration with the duo on their 1981 follow-up, &quot;Touch&quot;, which included the single &quot;I Will Fight&quot;, and a cover of &quot;I Will Survive&quot;. Also in 1981, the group provided prominent backing vocals for Kenny Rogers on his remake of Bobby &quot;Blue&quot; Bland&#x27;s &quot;Share Your Love with Me&quot;. The group had appeared on Rogers&#x27; television show with the First Edition several times in the early 1970s, and Knight guested on Rogers&#x27; TV special, &quot;Kenny Rogers Classic Weekend&quot; in 1986, performing a duet of &quot;Am I Too Late?&quot;, a song both singers had previously recorded. Three years later she also collaborated with Rogers on the US Billboard AC top ten single &quot;If I Knew Then What I Know Now&quot;.

Following a year-long international tour, the group recorded their third Columbia album, &quot;Visions&quot;, in 1983. The leading single, &quot;Save the Overtime (For Me)&quot;, gave the group their first number one R&amp;B single in eight years. The video accompanying the song became among the earliest R&amp;B videos to incorporate elements of hip-hop culture. The album also included the R&amp;B hit &quot;You&#x27;re Number One (In My Book)&quot;. After Knight partook in solo projects, including a No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 and R&amp;B hit collaboration on the song, &quot;That&#x27;s What Friends Are For&quot;, the group signed with MCA Records and released their final album &quot;All Our Love&quot; in 1987. The album was certified gold and included the hits &quot;Lovin&#x27; On Next to Nothin&#x27;&quot; and their Grammy-winning number-one single, &quot;Love Overboard&quot;. In 1988 the band also won a Soul Train Music Award for Career Achievement. Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips embarked on their final tour in 1988 and disbanded upon its conclusion, as Knight decided she wanted to pursue a solo career, ending a 37-year tenure.

===Honors, solo careers and deaths===
Following the group&#x27;s amicable disbandment in 1989, Edward Patten and William Guest formed their own production company in Detroit, titled Guest and Patten Productions, later renamed the Crew Entertainment Company. Patten was diagnosed with diabetes, which led to amputations of his legs and being confined to a wheelchair. He died of complications from the disease on February 25, 2005, in Livonia, Michigan. William Guest continued to lead the company with members of Patten&#x27;s family until his death from congestive heart failure in Detroit on December 24, 2015. Two years prior, Guest and his sister, Dame Dhyana Ziegler, PhD, released his autobiography, &quot;Midnight Train FROM Georgia: A Pip&#x27;s Journey&quot; (Branden Books, Boston, MA, USA), about his life and career. In 2007, Bubba Knight and Guest, along with a third man, Neil Taffe (one of Gladys Knight&#x27;s background singers), appeared in a commercial for Geico. On August 23, 1997, original Pips member Eleanor Guest died of heart failure. Langston George died on March 19, 2007, from congestive heart failure.

Bubba Knight still continues to oversee his sister&#x27;s career, by being her tour manager and occasionally joining Gladys onstage during performances. Gladys Knight recorded the theme song for the James Bond film, &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; in 1989, which became a top ten single in the UK. Two years later, she released her 1991 album, &quot;Good Woman&quot;, which included the top five R&amp;B hit, &quot;Men&quot;, and Grammy-nominated duet version of &quot;Superwoman&quot;, recorded with Dionne Warwick and Patti LaBelle. A 1994 album, &quot;Just for You&quot;, featured the hits &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Know&quot; and her cover of Boyz II Men&#x27;s &quot;End of the Road&quot;, and went gold. Knight still records and performs today. As a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, she sometimes leads the Saints Unified Voices choir.

The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2001 and received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Rhythm &amp; Blues Foundation in 1998. Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips are ranked as the ninth most successful act in &quot;The Billboard Top 40 Book of R&amp;B and Hip-Hop Hits&quot; (2005). They were also ranked No. 91 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Artists of Rock n&#x27; Roll&quot;. In June 2006, Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips were inducted into the Apollo Theater&#x27;s Hall of Fame in New York City. In 2017 the group was inducted into Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame.

<text>Pips are small but easily countable items, such as the dots on dominoes and dice, or the symbols on a playing card that denote its suit and value.

==Playing cards==
In playing cards, pips are small symbols on the front side of the cards that determine the suit of the card and its rank. For example, a standard 52-card deck consists of four suits of thirteen cards each: spades, hearts, clubs, and diamonds. Each suit contains three face cards – the jack, queen, and king. The remaining ten cards are called pip cards and are numbered from one to ten. (The &quot;one&quot; is almost always changed to &quot;ace&quot; and often is the highest card in many games, followed by the face cards.) Each pip card consists of an encoding in the top left-hand corner (and, because the card is also inverted upon itself, the lower right-hand corner) which tells the card-holder the value of the card. In Europe, it is more common to have corner indices on all four corners which lets left-handed players fan their cards more comfortably. The center of the card contains pips representing the suit. The number of pips corresponds with the number of the card, and the arrangement of the pips is generally the same from deck to deck.

Pip cards are also known as numerals or numeral cards.

In point-trick games where cards often score their value in pips (or equivalent if they are court cards e.g. a King may be worth 13), card points are sometimes referred to as pips.

Many French-suited packs derived from the English pattern contain a variation on the pip style for the Ace of spades, often consisting of an especially large pip or even a representative image, along with information about the deck&#x27;s manufacturer, originally to display the stamp duty. This is also the case for the Ace of clubs in the Paris pattern and the Ace of diamonds in the Russian pattern. For German-suited playing cards, the deuce of hearts was used for this purpose, and for Latin-suited playing cards, the ace of coins was used.

Historically German pips are generally different from the pips used in France and England, and the latter dates from at least the fourteenth century CE.

==Dice==
On dice, pips are small dots on each face of a die. These pips are typically arranged in patterns denoting the numbers one through &quot;n&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is the number of faces. For the common six-sided die, the sum of the pips on opposing faces traditionally adds up to seven.

Pips are commonly colored black on white or yellow dice, and white on dice of other colors, although colored pips on white/yellow dice are not uncommon; Asian dice often have an enlarged red single pip for the &quot;one&quot; face, while the dice for the 1964 commercial game Kismet feature black pips for 1 and 6, red pips for 2 and 5, and green pips for 3 and 4.

==Dominoes==
Dominoes use pips that are similar to dice. Each half of a domino tile can have anywhere from no pips all the way up to 18, in practice, depending on the set. A common double-six set has pips all the way up to six arranged in the same manner to dice pips. The game is generally played by up to four players only, individually or in partners (pairs). Domino sets having more pips on one half of the tile allow the game to be played by more players.
