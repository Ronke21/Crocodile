<text>George Grunert (July 21, 1881 – January 12, 1971) was a United States Army cavalry officer who worked his way up through the ranks from private to retirement as a lieutenant general. His 47-year career extended from the Spanish–American War to the end of World War II.

==Education and early career==
George Grunert was born in White Haven, Pennsylvania, on July 21, 1881, a son of David Grunert and Henrietta (Hollmann) Grunert. He graduated from White Haven High School in 1898 and joined the United States Army for the Spanish–American War. Enlisting as a private in the 2nd Artillery Regiment, he performed coast artillery duties in the Philippines, Cuba and on the west coast of the United States. He advanced through the ranks to corporal, sergeant, and quartermaster sergeant, and was serving at Fort Monroe in Virginia, when his application for a commission was approved. Grunert was commissioned as a second lieutenant of Cavalry in February 1901. He accepted in April and was assigned to the 11th Cavalry Regiment. By 1908 he was stationed in Cuba and in 1910 he was assigned to Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia.

==World War I and the inter-war years==
Grunert was sent to France as an observer with British forces in 1917 during World War I. During the American build up, he served as assistant chief of staff for I Corps and was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal for his work during the United States offensives of 1918. The citation for the medal reads:

In 1919, Grunert attended the Army War College then at Washington Barracks, now Fort Lesley J. McNair, in Washington, D.C. He served with the 1st Infantry Division at Camp Dix, then to Washington, D.C., to serve in the office of the Army Chief of Staff. He returned to the field as a lieutenant colonel of the 10th Cavalry Regiment at Fort Huachuca in Arizona in 1925.

After a second tour of duty in the office of the Army Chief of Staff, Grunert attended the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas from 1930 to 1932. In 1933, he was the director of military intelligence and espionage division course at the Army War College and in 1935, he became director of war plans division course.

In 1936, Grunert was posted to the Philippines as commanding officer of the 26th Cavalry Regiment (Philippine Scouts). He received his promotion to brigadier general in December 1936 in preparation for his command of the 23rd Brigade, a brigade of the Philippine Division composed of Philippine Scouts.

In November 1938 Grunert succeeded George C. Marshall in command of 5th Brigade at Vancouver Barracks, Washington. Grunert was promoted to major general in 1939 and, in October, returned to the Philippines to command the Philippine Division. From May 1940 to November 1941 Grunert commanded the Philippine Department, directing the United States Army supervision and control over the Philippine defense force until Douglas MacArthur came out of retirement to assume command in July 1941. MacArthur abolished the Philippine Department as a redundant command echelon in November 1941 and Grunert returned to the United States.

==World War II==
The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor occurred shortly after Grunert reached the United States, and he was shuffled between a number of assignments that included command of the Sixth Service Command at Fort Sheridan, Illinois, serving as the ranking military officer in the Chicago area, and two administrative posts with Army Service Forces as Deputy Chief of Staff for Service Commands (Service of Supply) overseeing the nine United States-based supply and logistics commands (formerly corps areas), under General Brehon B. Somervell.

In August 1943, Grunert was appointed deputy commander for both the Eastern Defense Command, a continental defense command for the eastern United States, and First United States Army at Fort Jay, Governors Island in New York City, taking the place of General Hugh A. Drum upon his mandatory retirement at age 64 in October 1943 and being promoted to lieutenant general at the same time.

Grunert held interim command over the First Army until January 1944 while Lieutenant General Omar Bradley completed assembling and staffing its new headquarters in England for the Normandy landings. Grunert continued command of Eastern Defense Command, which also assumed the duties of Central Defense Command, and Second Service Command for the New York area until his retirement in July 1945.

==Pearl Harbor investigation==
In June 1944, Grunert was appointed by Secretary of War Henry Stimson as the presiding officer of a secret panel that investigated the army response to events prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor. The Pearl Harbor Board report, released after the war, traced the entire military and diplomatic history prior to the attack finding much fault along the way, critical of break downs in communications between Secretary of State Cordell Hull, George C. Marshall and a failure of appropriate action by Hawaiian Department commander, Walter C. Short. The panel&#x27;s method of investigation and conclusions are still subject to criticism today.

==Retirement==
Grunert died at Brooke Army Hospital in San Antonio, Texas, on January 12, 1971, at age 89 and was buried at Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery. He was survived by his wife Florence Reynolds, daughter Mary and son-in-law, then First United States Army commander, Lieutenant General Jonathan O. Seaman at Fort Meade, Maryland. His son, Colonel George R. Grunert, attended the United States Military Academy, graduating with the class of 1930 and played on the army polo team. He was a veteran of World War II and Korea and preceded his father in death.

<doc id="161618" wikidata="Q8611" url="?curid=161618" title="La Spezia">
<text>La Spezia (, ; ; , in the local ) is the capital city of the province of La Spezia and is located at the head of the Gulf of La Spezia in the southern part of the Liguria region of Italy.

La Spezia is the second-largest city in the Liguria region, after Genoa. Located roughly midway between Genoa and Pisa, on the Ligurian Sea, it is one of the main Italian military and commercial harbours and a major Italian Navy base. A popular seaside resort, it is also a significant railway junction, and is notable for its museums, for the Palio del Golfo rowing race, and for railway and boat links with the Cinque Terre.

== History ==

La Spezia and its province have been settled since prehistoric times. In Roman times the most important centre was Luni, not far from Sarzana. As the capital of the short-lived Niccolò Fieschi Signoria in the period between 1256 and 1273, La Spezia was inevitably linked with Genoese vicissitudes. After the fall of the Republic of Genoa, an independent state until 1797, La Spezia grew, developed and changed, though along lines similar to Liguria&#x27;s capital Genoa. This Ligurian influence can still be seen in the urban layout as well as in the types of buildings and decorations. This is notable in the carrugio, the narrow street that divides the Old Town into two. It is called Via del Prione, taking its name from the &quot;pietrone&quot; or large stone, in local dialect prione, where public announcements were once read out.

La Spezia developed substantially after 1861 when the great naval arsenal there was commissioned by the Royal government. In September 1943, after the Italian capitulation to the Allies, it was the departure port for the Italian Navy when it was ordered to steam into British hands at Malta. The Germans arrived too late to stop the departure of the fleet. During the war Italian troopships also left from La Spezia, including the &quot;Kaiser Franz Josef&quot;, a trans-Atlantic liner launched in Trieste in 1911 for the Austrian Lloyd company, which Italy had confiscated in 1919. It was sunk in La Spezia harbour in 1944.

After the liberation, La Spezia became the point of departure for survivors from Nazi concentration camps. From the summer of 1945 to the spring of 1948 more than 23,000 Jewish displaced persons managed to leave Italy clandestinely for the Palestine Mandate. After lengthy vicissitudes, the ships &quot;Fede&quot;, &quot;Fenice&quot;, and &quot;Komemiut&quot; managed to evacuate everyone from the Golfo di La Spezia, to the extent that on Israeli maps, La Spezia is called &quot;Shaʿar Zion&quot;, in Hebrew &quot;Gateway to Zion&quot;.

== Main sights ==


=== Churches ===
* &quot;Cristo Re dei Secoli&quot;, modern cathedral, consecrated in 1975, designed by Adalberto Libera.
* Abbey church of &quot;Santa Maria Assunta&quot; (&quot;Our Lady of the Assumption&quot;, thirteenth century). It houses a considerable series of artworks, some of them originally from other suppressed religious institutes. They include an &quot;Incoronation of the Virgin&quot; by Andrea della Robbia, the &quot;Multiplication of Bread&quot; by Giovanni Battista Casoni and &quot;St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Martyrdom&quot; by Luca Cambiaso.
* &quot;Santi Giovanni e Agostino&quot;. It has a single nave with eighteenth and nineteenth century decorations.
* &quot;Nostra Signora della Scorza&quot;. Built in 1900 in Piazza Brin, in the heart of what is now a working-class neighborhood, Quartiere Umbertino.
* &quot;Maria Ausiliatrice&quot;. Built in the second half of 20th century and administered by the order of Salesiani in the proletarian neighbourhood &quot;Canaletto&quot;.
* &quot;Nostra Signora del Pianto&quot;, a small church which hosts an image of the Blessed Virgin Mary that is believed to be the protagonist of a sorrowful event. Its feast occurs on Pentecost.

=== Others ===
* Castle of San Giorgio, recently restored, probably originated from a watchtower. A first castle is known to have been built by Niccolò Fieschi in 1262. In 1273 it was destroyed by the Genoese, and a new fortification, along with a new line of walls, was erected by the &quot;podesteria&quot; of La Spezia from 1371. Annexed to this, the Republic of Genoa added a new castle starting from 1607.
* Public Gardens
* Art Nouveau—style villas
* Futurist mosaic by Prampolini inside the Post Office
* La Spezia is a point of departure for the villages of the Cinque Terre, either by train or boat. The boat also serves Lerici and Portovenere before turning into the open sea toward the Cinque Terre. The Cinque Terre villages are accessible by public transport, from central railway station.

== Climate ==

La Spezia has a borderline humid subtropical (&quot;Cfa&quot;) and Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;). The city enjoys hot summers, chilly damp winters and very changeable and rainy autumns and springs. The average temperatures of the coldest month (January) are minimum and maximum. In the hottest month (July) they are minimum and maximum. Average annual precipitation is , more than twice that in London. Snow is extremely uncommon. Heavy snowfalls are exceptional events: only in 1985 was a snowfall of more than recorded. Another big snowfall occurred during the night of 18 December 2009, with approximately of snow and temperatures as low as in the following nights.

In winter nights, if the sky is clear, temperatures may fall below zero, usually reaching about . Conversely, in summer, especially during sunny days, the temperature can easily exceed , and sometimes it reaches . Furthermore, the sensation of heat in summer is increased by the high humidity.

Because of its topography, the city is not exposed to winds from the north, which lap western Liguria, but to those from the southeast. These may bring heavy rain and they can reach , in rare cases causing the blocking of the port. The only northern wind reaching the city is the north-eastern Grecale, common during incursions of Arctic air, when the cold air flowing over the warmer Tyrrhenian sea triggers the formation of low pressures, draining the colder and heavier air trapped in the Po Valley, behind the Apennine Mountains.

<text>Monty is an American comic strip created, written and illustrated by cartoonist Jim Meddick. The strip began as Robotman starting February 18, 1985. The title changed to &quot;Monty&quot; in 2001.

==&quot;Robotman&quot;==
The comic strip began as &quot;Robotman&quot; on February 18, 1985. It originally depicted the exploits of a small robot from outer space visiting Earth, living with the ordinary Milde family.

&quot;Robotman&quot; originated as a character created by British musician Peter Shelley. Shelley later worked with United Feature Syndicate in an attempt to push Robotman via cross-marketing toys, records, videos, and other merchandise. In 1985, DIC Enterprises produced a 90-minute television special called &quot;Robotman &amp; Friends&quot;.

The syndicate desired to have a comic strip featuring the character; they had asked Bill Watterson to incorporate the character into &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; as a condition of syndication, but Watterson refused. The job was then passed on to Jim Meddick, who created the family setting and the other characters. As the strip progressed the design of Robotman changed considerably as Meddick&#x27;s style evolved. Within about 18 months after the strip debuted, the merchandising of the Robotman character had declined, and eventually the comic strip was left as the only active license for the character.

In the 1990s, Meddick changed the strip so that instead of the Mildes, Robotman began living with a geeky inventor named Monty, introduced in the January 20, 1993 strip.

During contract negotiations, the syndicate approached Meddick with a request to change the name of the strip to &quot;Monty&quot; and to deemphasize and remove the Robotman character from the strip. This was due to an ongoing difficulty in marketing the strip with the name &quot;Robotman&quot;. (For a brief period, the strip was rechristened &quot;Robotman and Monty&quot;.)

Robotman was gradually phased out of the strip through a farewell storyline in 2001 in which he left Earth to find love on the planet Diskelion. The series continued as &quot;Monty&quot; in April 2001, with Robotman&#x27;s place in the strip being taken by space alien Mr. Pi.

== Storylines==
As the website announces, the comic strip &quot;spoofs suburbia, trashes tacky TV shows and offers absurdist commentary on everything from hosing down spider monkeys to the latest conspiracy theory.&quot; Monty Montahue, the brainy, bumbling bachelor who&#x27;s unlucky in work and love, is the star of the strip.

Explains Meddick, &quot;I&#x27;ve tried to create the comic strip equivalent of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;. The name &#x27;Monty&#x27; is a nod to the influence that show had on my humor. In my cartoon just about anything can happen — this way, the ideas and characters always stay fresh.&quot;

== Characters ==

=== Current cast ===
* Monty Montahue is the protagonist and titular character. He is an odd, optimistic nerd who often comes up with strange inventions and works odd jobs. Monty was introduced to the &quot;Robotman&quot; strip in the early 1990s. In 1996, it was revealed that Monty was brainwashed of his past life as a government scientist when he invented Robotman. Monty is typically depicted as socially awkward, having poor dress skills and has a prominent nose but no chin. He takes on various (often very nerdy) hobbies and daily occupations, regularly failing because of a mix of goofiness and excessive self-confidence.
First Appearance: Early 1990s 
* Fleshy is a skinny, hairless housecat resembling the Pink Panther cartoon character. Fleshy is remarkable for his being the complete opposite of feline attitudes: he is goofy, fearful, unable to catch even the most innocuous of butterflies. Fleshy is frequently shown to be entirely uninterested while in the presence of people, but once alone, he shows his intelligence to be on par with humans. He has a son, who was abducted (and then returned) by the same aliens that took Robotman.
First Appearance: April 2, 2001
* Moondog McHorney is the only true friend of Monty. He&#x27;s a chronic beer drinker, and his house is one of the biggest centers of entropy in the world.
First Appearance: April 14, 2001
* Pilsner is Moondog&#x27;s cynical parrot, who often seems to be smarter than his owner, but still hasn&#x27;t managed to understand that the other parrot he sees in the mirror is himself.
First Appearance: April 23, 2001 
*Dehlia is Monty&#x27;s casual girlfriend. She works part-time with him in a Halloween pop-up store.
First Appearance:September 19, 2015 
* Professor Xemit is a time traveler from the year 2525 who came to visit the early 21st century and wound up living with Monty for a while and still visits occasionally.
First Appearance: April 9, 2007
* EB3 is a cyborg and a friend of Professor Xemit&#x27;s. Small in stature and painted white, he frets incessantly about the fact that he has a &quot;P-word&quot; (in his case meaning pancreas, not what you might think it means). Monty often tries to reassure about his pancreas anxiety (&quot;I have one. Doc has one. It&#x27;s nothing to be ashamed of!&quot;). He has shown romantic interest in a vacuum cleaner.
First Appearance: October 14, 2008
* Sedgwick Nuttingham III is a privileged child who inhabits a mansion somewhere in Monty&#x27;s neighborhood. His only companion is his faithful manservant Jarvis, who does anything that Sedgwick desires, from carrying ammunition as Sedgwick hunts Fleshy, to serving as a human target for snowballs, darts etc. Sedgwick&#x27;s parents do not appear in the strip. The characters have occasional contact with Sedgewick&#x27;s father, but he is usually away on business and rarely home. Sedgewick&#x27;s Aunt Polly lives in the mansion and exercises some parental control, but is not seen in the strip. Auntie Nell appears sometimes. The only other characters that Sedgwick interacts with besides Fleshy are various doctors and psychologists. Sedgwick is highly conservative politically, elitist, and convinced of his innate superiority to all others. First Appearance: May 11, 2009
* Jarvis is Sedgwick&#x27;s aristocratic butler, with a politely sarcastic sense of humour. First Appearance: May 11, 2009

=== Previous characters ===
* Robotman the original character for which the comic was originally named. He was portrayed at first as visiting Earth, but was later revealed to have been built by Monty in a secret government project. He originally lived with the Milde Family.
* The Milde Family was the original supporting cast for Robotman during the 1980s. They portrayed an American middle-class family that lived in suburbia. It was made up of Robotman&#x27;s best friend Oscar who was an insecure boy about 10 years old, his cynical teenage brother Gary, and their parents. When the strip shifted focus away from Robotman, they stopped appearing.
* Bruce; Robotman&#x27;s evil twin. He too was phased out after Monty&#x27;s debut.
* Olga; was one of Monty&#x27;s girlfriends in the mid-90s. She was a personal trainer, large-boned and muscular, in contrast to the out-of-shape Monty.
* Loco Ohno was Monty&#x27;s on-again/off-again girlfriend, a parody of Yoko Ono. She was cynical and artistic, very different from the optimistic and technology-minded Monty. She was a devoted feminist, often finding men being the root of evil.
First Appearance: April 16, 2001
Last Appearance:April 27, 2004
* Gretchen is a coffee waitress on whom Monty has a crush. She, however, does not return the feelings. She&#x27;s a friend and is currently single.
First Appearance:
*Lorri (also spelled &quot;Laurie&quot;) was Monty&#x27;s aggressive girlfriend. She works at a garage.
First Appearance: September 29, 2004

* Chimpy was a talking chimpanzee. Chimpy constantly attempted to demonstrate his superiority to (or at least parity with) human intelligence and culture, but in fact, he was not particularly bright. For example, he attempted to use a circular saw as a hammer. He left the strip for no apparent reason two years after his debut.
First Appearance:July 3, 2001
Last Appearance: December 20, 2003 
* Dave-7, formerly known as Mr. Pi, was an alien from Rigel and served as Monty&#x27;s straight man. Dave-7 lived with Monty. He was very logical and deeply involved in studying sciences such as quantum mechanics. There were occasionally ominous references to his race&#x27;s plans to take over the earth. Nothing has come of them yet. The closest they ever got was to the moon. Then Chimpy got his hands on Dave-7&#x27;s fleet-command-device, thinking it was a video game, and annihilated the entire fleet.
First Appearance: April 2, 2001
Last Appearance:
* Giggles the Gumdrop-Eating Bear was introduced when Robotman met him in a &quot;coping with cuteness&quot; support group. His relentlessly cheerful personality is embraced by readers and syndicate executives who love him and his tie-in merchandise, but the other characters find him creepy and off-putting.

== Notable spoofs ==
* There was a three-week spoof of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;: Monty&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Thing&quot;.
* In March 2006, there was a two-week spoof of the television series &quot;Lost&quot;, where Monty found himself shipwrecked on the island. In this spoof, Monty discovers that the Others are actually the castaways from &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;.
* Following a transporter accident, Robotman and Mr. Spock exchanged ears. This had to be rectified by the Vulcan Ear meld.
* After assuring Monty that he would be unaffected by the Y2k bug, Robotman became a Theodore Roosevelt-like character.

<doc id="161621" wikidata="Q2135736" url="?curid=161621" title="United States Army Forces in the Far East">
<text>United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE) (Filipino: &quot;Hukbong Katihan ng Estados Unidos sa Malayong Silangan&quot;; Spanish: &quot;Fuerzas del Ejército de los Estados Unidos en el Lejano Oriente&quot;) was a military formation of the United States Army active from 1941 to 1946. The new command&#x27;s headquarters was created on 26 July 1941, at No. 1, Calle Victoria, Manila, Luzon, the Philippines, with General Douglas MacArthur as commander. The Chief of Staff was Brigadier General Richard K. Sutherland and the Deputy Chief of Staff was Lieutenant Colonel Richard J. Marshall. The core of this command (including MacArthur, Marshall, and Sutherland) was drawn from the Office of the Military Advisor to the Commonwealth Government of the Philippines.

Creation of this command led to the subordination of the headquarters of the Philippine Department of the U.S. Army, as a service command, since planning and tactical control were now under USAFFE control. MacArthur explains, &quot;It became an administrative echelon. It was analogous to a corps area&quot;. MacArthur recommended that Philippine Department commander Major General Grunert be reassigned, as his services were no longer needed. On 23 October, Grunert returned to the United States and MacArthur was temporarily appointed as the Philippine Department&#x27;s commander.

==History==
In January 1941, the intelligence officer (G-2) of the Philippine Department recommended, to his superior in Washington, D.C., that an American high command in the Far East be created, with the commander of the Philippine Department as its designated commander. It does not appear this idea was seriously considered until Douglas MacArthur suggested, to the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, that such a command be created with MacArthur as the Far Eastern Commander.

On 6 June, Acting Chief of the War Plans Division Brigadier General Leonard T. Gerow noted that he saw no need for such a command, as US Forces in the Far East were concentrated in the Philippines. As such, Gerow argued that should a &quot;crisis&quot; occur, then MacArthur should become the commander of, not some new command, but rather, of the Philippine Department itself.

On 20 June, Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall informed MacArthur, &quot;Both the Secretary of War (Stimson) and I are much concerned about the situation in the Far East. Your qualifications and experience make you the logical selection for the Army Commander in the Far East should the situation approach a crisis. The Secretary has delayed recommending your appointment as he does not feel the time has arrived for such action. At the proper time, he will recommend to the President that you be so appointed.&quot;


On 17 July, Gerow made the following recommendations:

* The President should call into the service of the United States all organized military forces of the Commonwealth of the Philippines;
* General MacArthur should be called to active duty as a Major General and assigned as commander of Army Forces in the Far East;
* $10,000,000, from the President&#x27;s Emergency Fund should be allotted to cover the costs of mobilization and training of the Philippine Army;
* Training of the Philippine Army be financed from the sugar excise fund, or from other funds; and
* 425 U.S. Army reserve officers be sent to the Philippines to assist in mobilization and training.

On 25 July, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson requested that President Roosevelt issue orders calling the military forces of the Commonwealth into active service for the United States. Stimson explains, &quot;All practical steps should be taken to increase the defensive strength of the Philippine Islands&quot;.

The following day, Roosevelt froze all Japanese assets within the United States and issued the orders to absorb the forces of the Philippine Army. That same day, the United States Department of War created the USAFFE command, with jurisdiction over the Philippine Department and the military forces of Commonwealth of the Philippines (seemingly the Philippine Army, with two regular and ten reserve divisions, and the Philippine Army Air Corps). At the same time, MacArthur was recalled to active duty, with the rank of lieutenant general, as the USAFFE commander, from his positions as military advisor to the Philippine government and Field Marshal of the Philippine Army.

On 4 November 1941 USAFFE formally created the North Luzon Force, South Luzon Force, and the Visayas-Mindanao Force. Actually all had been in existence for several months.

Following the Japanese invasion of the Philippines in December 1941, the short-lived American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDACOM) was formed on 1 January 1942, to control all Allied forces in South East Asia and the South West Pacific. ABDACOM nominally controlled USAFFE forces, although the latter was effectively an independent force.

In February 1942, the US Army established United States Army Forces in Australia under Lieutenant General George Brett under the authority of General MacArthur. Australia will the launching area for supplies and reinforcements in the Philippines. This expanded USAFFE to a theater of Operations command rather than being only within the Philippines. US Army Forces in Dutch East Indies under MGen. Elliot S. Thorpe, was also established as Air Fields are created for the fighters escorting ships or Cargo planes.

In March, due to the worsening Allied position in Asia and the Pacific, Roosevelt ordered MacArthur to relocate his command to Australia. MacArthur&#x27;s famous speech regarding the Philippines, in which he said, &quot;I came out of Bataan and I shall return&quot; was made on 20 March at Terowie, South Australia during his first contact with the press in Australia. General Jonathan Wainwright officially assumed control of the remaining forces in the Philippines, now known as United States Forces in the Philippines (USFIP) on 23 March.

On 18 April 1942, ABDACOM was replaced by General Headquarters (GHQ), Southwest Pacific Area (SWPA) in Melbourne, including USFIP. MacArthur was appointed Supreme Commander, SWPA. USFIP, with the exception of some ad hoc guerilla and resistance outfits, had surrendered to Japanese by 8 May.

MacArthur formally reconstituted USAFFE in Australia in February 1943, to assume responsibility for all administrative staff duties pertaining to U.S. Army units in the SWPA, as well as control of guerrilla forces in the Philippines.

On 20 October 1944, the recapture of the Philippines commenced when Allied forces landed in Leyte Gulf. The campaign was declared completed on 4 July 1945 Major General Richard J. Marshall assumed command and MacArthur assumed Allied Powers in Asia Pacific command in preparation for the Invasion of Japan.

USAFFE was absorbed by US Army, Western Pacific under Lieutenant General Robert Richardson, even before end of war and since bulk of US Army was stationed in Japan it was formally dissolved in the lead-up to Philippine independence on 4 July 1946.

In 1947, the term was revitalized with the creation of Far East Command under General MacArthur in Tokyo. &quot;General MacArthur, however, retained direct command of Army components, wearing a second hat as Commanding General, Army Forces Far East (CG AFFE).&quot; &quot;In 1952, after General MacArthur had left.. the headquarters of Army Forces Far East was fully staffed and placed on a par with the other two component commands, and the Far East Command was given a truly joint staff.&quot;

<text>PlanetMath is a free, collaborative, mathematics online encyclopedia. Intended to be comprehensive, the project is currently hosted by the University of Waterloo. The site is owned by a US-based nonprofit corporation, &quot;PlanetMath.org, Ltd&quot;.

PlanetMath was started when the popular free online mathematics encyclopedia MathWorld was temporarily taken offline for 12 months by a court injunction as a result of the CRC Press lawsuit against the Wolfram Research company and its employee (and MathWorld&#x27;s author) Eric Weisstein.

==Materials==
The main PlanetMath focus is on encyclopedic entries. It formerly operated a self-hosted forum, but now encourages discussion via Gitter.

An all-inclusive PlanetMath &quot;Free Encyclopedia&quot; book of 2,300 pages is available for the encyclopedia contents up to 2006 as a free download PDF file.

===Content development model===

PlanetMath implements a specific content creation system called &quot;authority model&quot;.

An author who starts a new article becomes its &quot;owner&quot;, that is the only person authorized to edit that article. Other users may add corrections and discuss improvements but the resulting modifications of the article, if any, are always made by the owner. However, if there are long lasting unresolved corrections, the ownership can be removed. More precisely, after two weeks the system starts to remind the owner by mail; at six weeks any user can &quot;adopt&quot; the article; at eight weeks the ownership of the entry is completely removed (and such an entry is called &quot;orphaned&quot;).

To make the development more smooth, the owner may also choose to grant editing rights to other individuals or groups.

The user can explicitly create links to other articles, and the system also automatically turns certain words into links to the defining articles. The topic area of every article is classified by the Mathematics Subject Classification (MSC) of the American Mathematical Society (AMS).

The site is supervised by the Content Committee. Its basic mission is to &quot;maintain the integrity and quality of the mathematical content and organization of PlanetMath.&quot; As defined in its Charter, the tasks of the Committee include:
* Developing/maintaining the standards for PlanetMath content
* Improving individual PlanetMath entries in its Encyclopedia, Book, Paper, and Exposition)
* Developing topic areas
* Developing/improving site and user documentation
* Managing the PlanetMath Request list and Unproved Theorems list
* Improving categorization and other meta-attributes of entries.
* Developing software recommendations for improved content authoring and editorial functions.

===Technical details===
PlanetMath content is licensed under the copyleft Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License.
All content is written in LaTeX, a typesetting system popular among mathematicians because of its support of the technical needs of mathematical typesetting and its high-quality output.

PlanetMath originally used software written in Perl and running on Linux and the web server Apache. It was known as &quot;Noösphere&quot; and has been released under the free BSD License. PlanetMath retired Noösphere in favor of another piece of software called &quot;Planetary&quot;, implemented with Drupal.

===Related projects===
Encyclopedic content and bibliographic materials related to physics, mathematics and mathematical physics are developed by PlanetPhysics. The site, launched in 2005, uses similar software (Noosphere), but a significantly different moderation model with emphasis on current research in physics and peer review.

<text>Jeremy John Durham Ashdown, Baron Ashdown of Norton-sub-Hamdon (27 February 194122 December 2018), better known as Paddy Ashdown, was a British politician and diplomat who served as Leader of the Liberal Democrats from 1988 to 1999. Internationally, he is recognised for his role as High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina from 2002 to 2006, following his vigorous lobbying for military action against Yugoslavia in the 1990s.

Ashdown had an interpretership qualification in Mandarin and was fluent in several other languages, including Malay, German, French and Bosnian. After serving as a Royal Marine and Special Boat Service officer and as an intelligence officer in the UK security services, Ashdown was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Yeovil in 1983 before retiring in 2001.

Ashdown was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) in the 2006 New Year Honours and Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the 2015 New Year Honours. In 2017, Ashdown was appointed Officer of the Legion of Honour by the French government.
== Early life and career ==
Ashdown was the eldest of seven children: four brothers and two sisters. He was born in New Delhi, British India, on 27 February 1941 to a family of soldiers and colonial administrators who spent their lives in India. His father was a lapsed Catholic, and his mother a Protestant. His mother (née Hudson) was a nurse in the Queen Alexandra&#x27;s Royal Army Nursing Corps. Ashdown&#x27;s father, John William Richard Durham Ashdown (1909–1980), was a British Indian Army officer who served in the 14th Punjab Regiment and the Royal Indian Army Service Corps, and in 1944 attained the rank of temporary lieutenant colonel.

Ashdown was primarily brought up in Northern Ireland, where his father bought a farm in 1945 near Comber, County Down. He was educated first at a local primary school, then as a weekly boarder at Garth House Preparatory School in Bangor and from age 11 at Bedford School in England, where his accent earned him the nickname &quot;Paddy&quot;.

=== Royal Marines and Special Boat Section ===
After his father&#x27;s business collapsed, Ashdown passed the naval scholarship examination to pay for his school fees, but left before taking A-levels and joined the Royal Marines in 1959. He served until 1972 and retired with the rank of captain. He served in Borneo during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation and the Persian Gulf, before training as a Swimmer Canoeist in 1965, after which he joined the elite Special Boat Section (now named the Special Boat Service) and commanded a Section in the Far East. He then went to Hong Kong in 1967 to undertake a full-time interpreter&#x27;s course in Chinese, and returned to the UK in 1970 when he was given command of a Royal Marine company in Belfast.

=== Intelligence officer and diplomat ===
Ashdown left the Royal Marines to join the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS or MI6). As diplomatic cover, he worked for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office as first secretary to the United Kingdom mission to the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland. At the UN, Ashdown was responsible for relations with several UN organisations, involved in the negotiation of several international treaties, and some aspects of the Helsinki Accords in 1975.

== Political career ==
While in the Marines, Ashdown had been a supporter of the Labour Party but switched support to the Liberal Party in 1975. He had a comfortable life in Switzerland, where he lived with his wife Jane and their two children, Simon and Katherine, in a large house on the shores of Lake Geneva, enjoying plenty of time for sailing, skiing and climbing. Ashdown decided to enter politics after the UK had two general elections in one year (those of February and October 1974) and the Three-Day Week. He said that, &quot;most of my friends thought it was utterly bonkers&quot; to leave the diplomatic service, but that he had &quot;a sense of purpose&quot;.

In 1976 Ashdown was selected as the Liberal Party&#x27;s prospective parliamentary candidate in his wife&#x27;s home constituency of Yeovil in Somerset, and took a job with Normalair Garrett, then part of the Yeovil-based Westland Group. Yeovil&#x27;s Liberal candidate had been placed second in the February 1974 and third in the October 1974 general elections; Ashdown&#x27;s objective was to &quot;squeeze&quot; the local Labour vote to enable him to defeat the Conservatives, who had held the seat since its creation in 1918. He subsequently worked for Tescan, and was unemployed for a time after that firm&#x27;s closure in 1981, before becoming a youth worker with Dorset County Council&#x27;s Youth Service, working on initiatives to help the young unemployed. That position being an unpaid &quot;volunteer&quot; one, Ashdown was at the time classified as &quot;long-term unemployed&quot;, having applied unsuccessfully for 150 jobs.

=== Member of Parliament ===
At the 1979 general election, which returned the Conservatives to power, Ashdown regained second place, establishing a clear lead of 9% over the Labour candidate. The Conservative majority of 11,382 was still large enough to be regarded as a safe seat when the sitting MP John Peyton stood down at the 1983 general election to be made a life peer. Ashdown had gained momentum after his years of local campaigning. The Labour vote fell to only 5.5% and Ashdown won the seat with a majority of over 3,000, a swing from the Conservatives of 11.9% against a national swing of 4% to the Conservatives.

==== In Parliament ====
Ashdown had long been on his party&#x27;s social democratic wing, supporting the 1977 Lib–Lab pact, and the SDP–Liberal Alliance. In the early 1980s, he was a prominent campaigner against the deployment in Europe of American nuclear-armed cruise missiles, describing them at a Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament rally in Hyde Park in 1983 as &quot;the front end of the whole anti-nuclear struggle. It is the weapon we to stop.&quot;

Shortly after entering the House of Commons, he was appointed SDP–Liberal Alliance spokesman on trade and industry and then on education. He opposed the privatisation of the Royal Ordnance Factories in 1984, criticised the Thatcher government in 1986 for allowing the United States to bomb Libya from UK bases, and campaigned against the loss of trade union rights by workers at GCHQ in 1987.

==== Leader of Liberal Democrats ====

When the Liberal Party merged in 1988 with the Social Democrats to form the Social and Liberal Democrats (their name shortened in 1989 to &quot;Liberal Democrats&quot;), he was elected as the new party&#x27;s leader and made a Privy Councillor in January 1989.

Ashdown led the Liberal Democrats into two general elections, in 1992 and 1997, and three European Parliament elections, in 1989, 1994 and 1999. The Lib Dems failed to win any seats in the 1989 European Parliament election. They recorded a net loss of two seats in the 1992 general election when the party was still recovering from the after-effects of the 1988 merger. In 1994, the party gained its first two Members of the European Parliament. At the 1997 election, the Liberal Democrats won 46 seats, their best performance since the Liberal Party in the 1920s. However, they took a smaller share of the vote than in the 1992 election. While the Liberal Democrats vote share decreased in the 1999 European Parliament election, the move from first-past-the-post to the D&#x27;Hondt method saw the party make a net gain of 8 seats.

Between 1993 and 1997, he was a notable proponent of cooperation between the Liberal Democrats and &quot;New Labour&quot; and had regular secret meetings with Tony Blair to discuss the possibility of a coalition government. This was despite Labour&#x27;s opinion poll showings from late 1992 onwards, virtually all suggesting that they would gain a majority at the next election, particularly in the first year or so of Blair&#x27;s leadership following his appointment in mid-1994. The discussions began in early 1993, while the party was still being led by Blair&#x27;s predecessor John Smith, who died suddenly in May 1994. After Blair was elected as Labour leader, the talks continued.

There was no need for a coalition, as the 1997 general election ended in a Labour landslide victory. The election also saw a breakthrough for the Liberal Democrats despite receiving fewer votes than in 1992; they increased their representation from 18 to 46. A &quot;Joint Cabinet Committee&quot; (JCC), including senior Labour and Liberal Democrat politicians, was then created to discuss the implementation of the two parties&#x27; shared priorities for constitutional reform; its remit was later expanded to include other issues on which Blair and Ashdown saw scope for cooperation between the two parties. Ashdown&#x27;s successor as Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, deliberately allowed the JCC to slip into abeyance until it effectively stopped meeting.

=== Resignation and peerage ===
Ashdown announced his intention to resign as Leader of the Liberal Democrats on 20 January 1999, departing on 9 August that year following 11 years in the role, and was succeeded by Charles Kennedy. In mid-1999, there was speculation that he would be appointed the new Secretary General of NATO; his lack of governmental experience meant that doubts were raised about his suitability. The post was ultimately filled by defence secretary George Robertson.

He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 2000 and after retiring from the Commons one month previously, he was created a life peer, the peerage being gazetted on 16 July 2001 as that of Baron Ashdown of Norton-sub-Hamdon, of Norton-sub-Hamdon in the County of Somerset. In the 2001 election, the Yeovil seat was retained for the Liberal Democrats by David Laws. Likewise, in 2001, the University of Bath conferred on Ashdown an honorary Doctor of Laws degree.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 2001, when he was surprised by Michael Aspel at BBC Television Centre.

== High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina ==
After leaving frontline British politics, he accepted the post of the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina on 27 May 2002, reflecting his long-time advocacy of international intervention in that region. He succeeded Wolfgang Petritsch in the position created under the Dayton Agreement. During his time as High Representative between 2002 and 2006, he strengthened the central state institutions, brought in statewide legal bodies such as the State Investigation and Protection Agency and brought the two ethnic armies under a central civilian command, and moved Bosnia-Herzegovina toward EU integration. He was sometimes denigrated as &quot;the Viceroy of Bosnia&quot; by critics of his work as High Representative.

=== Witness for the prosecution at Milošević trial ===
On 14 March 2002, Ashdown testified as a witness for the prosecution at the trial of Slobodan Milošević at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. He said that he was on the Kosovo–Albania border near Junik in June 1998. From this location, through his binoculars, Ashdown claimed to have seen Serbian forces shelling several villages. In July 2005, a defence witness, General Božidar Delić, claimed by demonstrating with a topographical map of the area that Ashdown could not have been able to see the areas that he claimed to be able to see as hills, mountains and thick woods would have obstructed his view. After the Delić claims, Ashdown supplied the Tribunal with grid coordinates and a cross-section of the ground indicating that he could see the locations concerned. These coordinates indicated he was on the Kosovo–Albania border, which was a sealed border at the time. The prosecution also used new maps and topographical cross-sections indicating Ashdown&#x27;s location, but their accuracy was challenged by Delić, for the location of a village was different from that shown in other maps of the area.

== Retirement ==

In retirement, Ashdown became a regular voice for the Liberal Democrats. He publicly supported military strikes in Syria in 2013 and said he was ashamed after Parliament voted against them. At the 2015 general election he appeared on the BBC soon after the announcement of the exit poll which predicted that the Liberal Democrats would be reduced from 57 MPs to 10. Ashdown said he would eat his hat if the exit poll was correct. The result was that the Liberal Democrats returned eight MPs, but the technical difference from the exit poll was not enough to save him from several requests to carry out his vow. Some commentators suggested humorously that this was an example of Liberal Democrats breaking their promises in response to U-turns conducted in the coalition government. The following day after the election, on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot; programme, Ashdown was presented with a chocolate hat that he later ate.

=== Offer of Cabinet post ===
In June 2007, the BBC reported that Ashdown had been offered and rejected the Cabinet post of Northern Ireland secretary by incoming Labour Party prime minister Gordon Brown. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell had already ruled out the idea that members of his party would take seats in a Brown Cabinet, but, according to the reports, Brown still approached Ashdown with the offer.

=== Offer of Afghanistan post ===
Ashdown was later asked by US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and Prime Minister Gordon Brown to take charge of the Allied effort in Afghanistan, though an unnamed source is quoted in a January 2008 Reuters report indicating that Ashdown was also approached by UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon and met with the Afghan president Hamid Karzai secretly in Kuwait to discuss the post which he later accepted. He later decided against taking the role after gleaning that Afghanistan preferred General Sir John McColl over him. On 7 March, Norwegian diplomat Kai Eide was appointed as the UN representative for Afghanistan, stating &quot;I&#x27;m not Paddy Ashdown, but don&#x27;t under-estimate me.&quot;

=== Other positions ===
Ashdown was a member of the Governing Council of Interpeace, an international peacebuilding organisation, and also served as President of Chatham House. He later chaired the Liberal Democrats&#x27; 2015 general election team.

In 2016, Ashdown founded More United alongside several other public figures in the aftermath of the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. More United is a liberal and progressive cross-party political movement.

== Personal life ==
Ashdown married Jane Courtenay in 1962. The couple had a son, Simon; a daughter, Katharine; and three grandchildren. In 1992, following the press becoming aware of a stolen document relating to a divorce case, he disclosed a five-month affair with his secretary, Patricia Howard, five years earlier from which he acquired the press nickname &quot;Paddy Pantsdown&quot;. His career and marriage both survived the political and tabloid storm, with his wife forgiving him.

Ashdown supported Yeovil Town. He was a member of the National Liberal Club.

=== Death and funeral ===
Ashdown was diagnosed with bladder cancer in October 2018. He died on 22 December at Southmead Hospital in Bristol, at the age of 77.

On 10 January 2019, a funeral service was held at Church of St Mary the Virgin, Norton-sub-Hamdon, and he was buried in the churchyard. A service of thanksgiving was held for him at Westminster Abbey on 10 September.

<text>&quot;Silent Night&quot; () is a popular Christmas carol, composed in 1818 by Franz Xaver Gruber to lyrics by Joseph Mohr in Oberndorf bei Salzburg, Austria. It was declared an intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO in 2011. The song was first recorded in 1905 and has remained a popular success, appearing in films and multiple successful recordings, as well as being quoted in other musical compositions. It is one of the most recorded Christmas songs, with more than 137,000 known recordings.

==History==
&quot;&quot; was first performed on Christmas Eve, 1818, at the Nikolauskirche, the parish church of Oberndorf, a village in the Austrian Empire on the Salzach river in present-day Austria. A young Catholic priest, Father Joseph Mohr, had come to Oberndorf the year before. In the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, he had written the poem &quot;&quot; in 1816 at Mariapfarr, the hometown of his father in the Salzburg Lungau region, where Joseph had worked as an assistant priest.

The melody was composed by Franz Xaver Gruber, schoolmaster and organist in the nearby village of , now part of Lamprechtshausen. On Christmas Eve, 1818, Mohr brought the words to Gruber and asked him to compose a melody and guitar accompaniment for that night&#x27;s mass, after river flooding had possibly damaged the church organ. The church was eventually destroyed by repeated flooding and replaced with the Silent-Night-Chapel. It is unknown what inspired Mohr to write the lyrics, or what prompted him to create a new carol.

According to Gruber, Karl Mauracher, an organ builder who serviced the instrument at the Oberndorf church, was enamoured of the song, and took the composition home with him to the Zillertal. From there, two travelling families of folk singers, the Strassers and the Rainers, included the tune in their shows. The Rainers were already singing it around Christmas 1819, and they once performed it for an audience that included Franz I of Austria and Alexander I of Russia, as well as making the first performance of the song in the U.S., in New York City in 1839. By the 1840s the song was well known in Lower Saxony and was reported to be a favourite of Frederick William IV of Prussia. During this period, the melody changed slightly to become the version that is commonly played today.
Over the years, because the original manuscript had been lost, Mohr&#x27;s name was forgotten and although Gruber was known to be the composer, many people assumed the melody was composed by a more famous composer, and it was variously attributed to Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven or Schubert. However, a manuscript was discovered in 1995 in Mohr&#x27;s handwriting and dated by researchers as . It states that Mohr wrote the words in 1816 when he was assigned to a pilgrim church in Mariapfarr, Austria, and shows that the music was composed by Gruber in 1818. This is the earliest manuscript that exists and the only one in Mohr&#x27;s handwriting.

&lt;/score&gt;

==Translations==
In 1859, the Episcopal priest John Freeman Young, then serving at Trinity Church, New York City, wrote and published the English translation that is most frequently sung today, translated from three of Mohr&#x27;s original six verses. The version of the melody that is generally used today is a slow, meditative lullaby or pastorale, differing slightly (particularly in the final strain) from Gruber&#x27;s original, which was a &quot;moderato&quot; tune in time and siciliana rhythm. Today, the lyrics and melody are in the public domain, although newer translations usually are not. 

In 1998 the Silent Night Museum in Salzburg commissioned a new English translation by Bettina Klein of Mohr&#x27;s German lyrics. For the most part, Klein preserves both Young&#x27;s translation and the interpretive decisions that inform his word-choices. Yet Klein also attempts occasionally to restore Mohr&#x27;s original phrasing, changing, for instance, Young&#x27;s &quot;Holy infant, so tender and mild&quot; to Mohr&#x27;s &quot;Holy infant with curly hair&quot; (&quot;Holder Knab&#x27; im lockigten Haar&quot;). However, she continues to interpret Mohr&#x27;s &quot;traute heilige Paar&quot; as referring to Mary and the baby, whereas Mohr&#x27;s use of the word &quot;traute&quot; can mean &quot;espoused,&quot; thus suggesting perhaps that the &quot;holy pair&quot; represents Mary and Joseph watching (picking up Mohr&#x27;s &quot;wacht&quot;) over the curly-haired infant/boy. 

The carol has been translated into about 300 languages.

==Lyrics==

In the second stanza, some English versions read &quot;shepherds &quot; rather than &quot;shepherds quake.&quot;

A common fourth verse or alternative third verse is:
&lt;poem&gt;Silent night, holy night,
wondrous star, lend thy light;
with the angels let us sing,
Alleluia to our King;
Christ the Savior is born,
Christ the Savior is born!&lt;/poem&gt;

==Musical settings==
The carol was arranged by various composers, such as Carl Reinecke, Gustav Schreck, Eusebius Mandyczewski, Malcolm Sargent, David Willcocks, Charles Mackerras, Philip Ledger, John Rutter, Stephen Cleobury, Jacob de Haan and Taylor Scott Davis..

Max Reger quotes the tune in the Christmas section of his organ pieces &quot;Sieben Stücke&quot;, Op. 145.

Alfred Schnittke composed an arrangement of &quot;Stille Nacht&quot; for violin and piano in 1978, as a holiday greeting for violinist Gidon Kremer. Due to its dissonant and nightmarish character, the miniature caused a scandal in Austria.

==In film==
Several theatrical and television films depict how the song was ostensibly written. Most of them report the organ breaking down at the church in Oberndorf, which appeared in a fictional story published in the U.S. in the 1930s.

<doc id="161644" wikidata="Q1583377" url="?curid=161644" title="Lovesexy">
<text>Lovesexy is the tenth studio album by American recording artist Prince. The album was released on May 10, 1988, by Paisley Park Records and Warner Bros. Records. The album was recorded in just seven weeks, from mid-December 1987 to late January 1988, at Prince&#x27;s new Paisley Park Studios, after the cancellation of the infamous Black Album and most of the album is a solo effort from Prince, with a few exceptions. The lyrical themes of the record include positivity, self-improvement, spirituality, and God.

Despite being critically acclaimed, &quot;Lovesexy&quot; only reached number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, Prince&#x27;s first album since 1981&#x27;s &quot;Controversy&quot; not to crack the top 10; however, it reached number one in the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK. It spawned three singles: &quot;Alphabet St.&quot;—which became a worldwide top-10 hit in the spring of 1988—and the follow-up singles &quot;Glam Slam&quot; and &quot;I Wish U Heaven&quot;, both of which failed to reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Subsequently, it was Prince&#x27;s least successful album in the United States since 1980. It was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in December 1988.

&quot;Lovesexy&quot; was accompanied by the Lovesexy Tour, of which the September 9th Dortmund show in Germany was released on video cassette and LaserDisc. The tour was also televised (with a short delay for editorial purposes) on several European channels, with the broadcast containing various alternate camera shots in place of the ones used in the officially released video, which was released a year later in 1989.

== Recording ==
The opening track, &quot;Eye No&quot;, was recorded with the full band (Miko Weaver on guitar, Levi Seacer, Jr. on bass, Doctor Fink and Boni Boyer on keyboards, Eric Leeds on saxophone, Atlanta Bliss on trumpet and Sheila E. on drums). Sheila E., in fact, plays drums on several tracks and sings backup, along with Boyer. Leeds and Bliss provide horns on most tracks, and Ingrid Chavez provides the intro to &quot;Eye No&quot;. The album is designed to be heard in the context of a continuous sequence: LP pressings split the album in two side-long tracks, without visual bands to indicate individual songs. Similarly, early CD copies of &quot;Lovesexy&quot; have the entire album in sequence as a single track, though some later editions have it as nine separate tracks. &quot;Lovesexy&quot; is also the first Prince album to replace the pronoun &quot;I&quot; with a stylized &quot;👁&quot; symbol, commonly Romanized as &quot;eye&quot; (i.e. &quot;Eye No&quot;), in both song titles and liner notes; the symbol would not be completely adopted, however, until 1992&#x27;s &quot;Love Symbol Album&quot;.

==Music==
The theme of the album is the struggle between good and evil. God and Satan, virtue and sin (although, with the Gemini character that he developed in 1989, these &quot;sides&quot; may also represent &quot;ego and alter-ego&quot;), the perennial themes of Prince&#x27;s work, mix as Prince climaxes to &quot;Love is God, God is love, girls and boys love God above&quot; in the song &quot;Anna Stesia&quot;.

Prince referred to &quot;Lovesexy&quot; as a gospel album. It opens with a sermon of sorts; &quot;Eye No&quot;, a positive energetic track advising people to be free from their vices and to reject Satan, and affirming his belief in God, while using his bully pulpit to encourage the listener to do the same. &quot;Eye No&quot; is a reworking of a song called &quot;The Ball&quot; from the unreleased &quot;Crystal Ball&quot;. The song ends with a scale of horns and a segue of conversations (originally recorded on &quot;Eye No&quot;&#x27;s original version &quot;The Ball&quot; which segued into another song; the &quot;conversations&quot;, or background party ambiance, was later used on the &quot;Graffiti Bridge&quot; album as a segue between &quot;We Can Funk&quot; and &quot;Joy in Repetition&quot;) leading to the album&#x27;s biggest-selling single, &quot;Alphabet St.&quot;, which mixes dance music, rock and rap along with playful lyrics about sex, braggadocio, and the heavenly state of feeling &quot;lovesexy&quot;. Next is &quot;Glam Slam&quot;, a busy dance track which features Prince&#x27;s full band. It speaks to the uplifting interlude between Prince and a woman, and how, when he fell down, she lifted him. It also praises the woman&#x27;s love and sense of humanity. The song ends with an almost classical music string solo (performed on keyboard). Ending side one of the vinyl release is &quot;Anna Stesia&quot;, a heartfelt confessional number divulging various sins of the flesh, and ends with Prince promising to dedicate his life and music to God.

Side two opens with the machine gun-like pace of &quot;Dance On&quot;, which lambastes negative aspects of society, somewhat akin to &quot;Sign O&#x27; the Times&quot;. The title track follows, described by Prince as &quot;The feeling you get when you fall in love ... not with a boy or girl but with the heavens above,&quot; and it is another energetic dance track; the &quot;Good News&quot; indeed Prince extols its virtues graphically and then he and Cat Glover share an orgasm, both using sped-up &quot;Camille&quot;-like vocals, going from Prince&#x27;s voice to Cat&#x27;s. This leads into &quot;When 2 R in Love&quot;, a sex-infused ballad recorded during the sessions for the untitled black album. Next is the almost sparse, but uplifting &quot;I Wish U Heaven&quot;, which says that no matter what controversy or opposition one may bring, the result is still wishing your enemy the best. It follows a Biblical proverb about &quot;blessing those that curse you, loving those that hate you, for it heaps hot coals on their heads&quot;. The last track is &quot;Positivity&quot;, which echoes the theme of &quot;Dance On&quot;. It extols the virtues of staying positive, while asking the listener to examine examples of negativity and negative aspects of the world; overlooking the quick thrill and pushing toward being positive throughout it. The song continuously asks the question &quot;Have you had your plus sign today?&quot; The vocals are sung, but the bridge and extended portions are more of a spoken rap-type style that Prince had started to display as early as &quot;Annie Christian&quot; in 1981. The song ends with sounds of water rushing and a river over keyboard chords. This final song was later given to Mavis Staples for her 1991 album, &quot;The Voice&quot;.

==Critical reception==
The cover (based on a photo by Jean Baptiste Mondino) caused some controversy upon release as it depicts Prince in the nude. Some record stores refused to stock it or wrapped the album in black, although &quot;Lovesexy&quot; had been issued as a replacement for the hastily withdrawn &quot;The Black Album&quot;, which had an achromatic black cover.

&quot;Lovesexy&quot; was Prince&#x27;s least successful album since 1981, failing to break the top 10, being certified Gold and spending just 21 weeks on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. While &quot;Alphabet St.&quot; managed to crack the top 10, it did not make a lasting impression and the subsequent two single releases failed to chart on the Hot 100. 

The situation in the United Kingdom was more positive, where the album debuted at number 1 (Prince&#x27;s first number-one album in the UK) and all the singles became top 40 hits. In addition, the Lovesexy Tour (which concluded in February 1989) was a massive success across Europe and Asia.

==Track listing==
Sample credits
* The opening to &quot;Eye No&quot; contains a sample from a Roger Limb track &quot;Passing Clouds&quot;, created at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop released in 1971 on the &quot;Out of this World&quot; album.

Notes
* The &quot;Eye&quot; in &quot;Eye No&quot; is actually represented by a stylized eye symbol (👁) in place of the pronoun &quot;I&quot; throughout the liner notes. It is commonly transliterated as &quot;Eye&quot; because of &quot;I Wish U Heaven&quot;&#x27;s placement later on the album.
* First pressings of the compact disc feature all content on a single track. Likewise, the vinyl edition presented each side of vinyl with no track indexes. Some later pressings of both CD and vinyl featured nine separate tracks. When Prince&#x27;s music was added to digital stores and streaming services in 2017, &quot;Lovesexy&quot; was made available in its single track format only. However, a tracked version was later released digitally in 2021.

<text>Eric Johnson (born August 17, 1954) is an American guitarist, vocalist and composer. His 1990 album &quot;Ah Via Musicom&quot; was certified platinum by the RIAA, and the single &quot;Cliffs of Dover&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.

Best known for his electric guitar skills, Johnson is also a highly proficient player of acoustic, lap steel, and resonator guitar, as well as an accomplished bassist, pianist, and vocalist. He plays many musical genres, including rock, blues, jazz fusion, soul, folk, new-age, classical, and country. &quot;Keyboard Magazine&quot; called him &quot;one of the most respected guitarists on the planet&quot; in 2006.

==Music career==
===Early life===
Born into a musically inclined family, Eric Johnson and his three sisters studied piano, while his father was a whistling enthusiast. Johnson started learning the guitar at age 11 and rapidly progressed while listening to the musicians who would heavily influence his future style, including Mike Bloomfield, Chet Atkins, Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Ric Bailey, Wes Montgomery, Jerry Reed, Bob Dylan, and Django Reinhardt, among others. At the age of 15, he joined his first professional band, Mariani, a psychedelic rock group. In 1970, Johnson and the group recorded a demonstration, which had an extremely limited release. The recording became a prized collector&#x27;s item years later.

===Early bands===

After graduating from high school, Johnson briefly attended the University of Texas at Austin and traveled with his family to Africa. He eventually returned to Austin, and in 1974, joined a local fusion group called Electromagnets. The group toured and recorded regionally, but did not attract attention from major record labels and disbanded in 1977. The strength of Johnson&#x27;s playing, however, attracted a small cult following to the group&#x27;s early recordings, and decades later, their two albums were given wide release on compact disc.

===&quot;Seven Worlds&quot;===
Following the Electromagnets&#x27; demise, Johnson formed a touring trio, the Eric Johnson Group, with drummer Bill Maddox and bassist Kyle Brock. They played to audiences around Austin. From 1976–1978, Johnson recorded &quot;Seven Worlds&quot;, his debut album, at Odyssey Studios in Austin. Contract disputes followed, and &quot;Seven Worlds&quot; was not released until 1998 on Ark21 Records.

Unable to secure a new management contract, Johnson began working as a session guitarist for some well-known acts, including Cat Stevens, Carole King, and Christopher Cross. While a session musician, Johnson continued to perform locally in Austin.

Johnson&#x27;s career rebounded in 1984 when he was signed to Warner Bros. Records. Christopher Cross and producer David Tickle recommended Johnson to the label. His breakthrough appearance at &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; on July 31, 1984, was recorded and later released on CD/DVD in 2010. The performance of &quot;Cliffs of Dover&quot; from the concert was distributed in a flexi-disc soundpage in the May 1986 issue of &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine.

===&quot;Tones&quot; and &quot;Ah Via Musicom&quot;===

In May 1986, &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine ran a cover story about Johnson. The article helped promote the release of &quot;Tones&quot; and brought Johnson critical praise, as well as elevating his profile in the guitar and music community. The album&#x27;s track &quot;Zap&quot; was nominated for the 1987 Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance, but as a whole, the album did not sell well, and Warner Bros. let Johnson&#x27;s contract expire. He signed on with indie label Cinema Records, distributed by Capitol Records.

By the time Johnson released his 1990 Capitol Records debut album, &quot;Ah Via Musicom&quot;, he was regularly winning awards for his musicianship in the guitar press. During this period, Johnson also drew recognition for the rich, violin-like lead sound he coaxed from his beloved 1954 Fender Stratocaster, which he named Virginia. The album&#x27;s second track, &quot;Cliffs of Dover&quot;, exemplified his unique sound and won Johnson a 1991 Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. &quot;Ah Via Musicom&quot; was a crossover hit and was certified platinum.

===&quot;Venus Isle&quot;===
Johnson is an admitted perfectionist, and those traits seemed to work against the &quot;Ah Via Musicom&quot; follow-up release. Unhappy with his recordings, Johnson mastered, then later scrapped several completed tracks for the new album and delayed its release for three years, on top of the three years he had spent touring in support of &quot;Ah Via Musicom&quot;. He also had setbacks involving musical growth and personal issues while recording his next album &quot;Venus Isle&quot;.

&quot;Venus Isle&quot; was released on September 3, 1996. It was an album with world influences that demonstrated Johnson&#x27;s growth as a guitarist, songwriter, producer, musical arranger, and vocalist, but the album received mixed reviews and did not match the success of its predecessor. As a result, Johnson was dropped from Capitol Records. He rebounded with a successful tour from October to November 1996 with fellow guitarists Joe Satriani and Steve Vai. Named the &quot;G3&quot; tour, it resulted in a platinum-selling compact disc and DVD titled &quot;G3: Live in Concert&quot;.

===Solo albums in the 2000s===
Johnson eventually returned to the recording studio, releasing &quot;Souvenir&quot; in January 2003 on his own Vortexan Records label. The album, released on the Internet, received nearly 65,000 plays in the first seven weeks after it was made available on mp3.com. Johnson promoted &quot;Souvenir&quot; with an electric tour in 2003 and an acoustic tour in 2004.

Johnson&#x27;s album &quot;Bloom&quot; was released in June 2005, on Vai&#x27;s Favored Nations label. The album was divided into three sections with different musical styles, intended to showcase Johnson&#x27;s versatility. His December 1988 &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; performance was released on both DVD and compact disc on New West Records in November 2005. His instructional guitar DVD, &quot;The Art of Guitar&quot; (Hal Leonard Corporation), was also released at the end of 2005.

On June 24, 2014, Provogue Records released &quot;Europe Live&quot;, a retrospective of Johnson&#x27;s work that features two new compositions. One of the new compositions is entitled &quot;Evinrude Fever&quot; and draws inspiration from water skiing and boating.

===Other projects===
In 1991, Johnson contributed guitar for two tracks on Stuart Hamm&#x27;s album, &quot;The Urge&quot;. 
In 1994, he formed a side project called Alien Love Child and played shows sporadically while recording &quot;Venus Isle&quot;. The positive fan feedback from the shows made Alien Love Child a permanent gig. A live performance recording, &quot;Live and Beyond&quot;, was released in 2000 on Steve Vai&#x27;s Favored Nations label. Alien Love Child featured the vocal prowess of Malford Milligan, an Austin-area musician who fronted the local band Storyville, made up of members of Stevie Ray Vaughan&#x27;s Double Trouble.

In 1998, Johnson was among the judges in &quot;Musician&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Best Unsigned Bands&quot; competition, along with Ani DiFranco, Moby, Art Alexakis of Everclear, Keb&#x27; Mo&#x27;, and Joe Perry of Aerosmith.

In 2003, he contributed a guitar solo on Mike Tramp&#x27;s solo album, &quot;More to Life than This&quot;. The solo was featured on the track &quot;The Good, the Sad and the Ugly&quot;.

In September 2006, Johnson took part in a theatrical production titled &quot;Primal Twang: The Legacy of the Guitar&quot; – the first definitive theatrical journey through the guitar&#x27;s colorful and controversial 3,500-year history. In September 2007, Johnson participated in a second theatrical production by the same company titled &quot;Love In: A Musical Celebration&quot; in which he performed a Jimi Hendrix set, a tribute to the year 1967, often called &quot;The Summer of Love&quot;.

In late 2006, he participated in a second G3 tour in South America with Joe Satriani and John Petrucci.

Johnson appeared as part of &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ultimate Musician&#x27;s Fantasy Camp in Las Vegas in February 2014, with guitarists Joe Perry, Steve Vai, Elliot Easton, Michael Anthony, and others. He appeared with Zakk Wylde, Buddy Guy, Jonny Lang, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Dweezil Zappa, and Doyle Bramhall II as part of the eighth edition of the Experience Hendrix Tour highlighting the music of Jimi Hendrix, in March 2014. Johnson returned to the Experience Hendrix Tour in September and October 2014. Johnson and fellow guitarist Mike Stern kicked off their Eclectic Guitar Tour on November 6, 2014, and released an album supporting it on October 27, 2014. In August 2015, he participated in the &quot;Vai Academy&quot; along with guitarists Steve Vai and Sonny Landreth, and also kicked off an acoustic tour of the Southwest.

In 2016, he released &quot;EJ: Explorations on Guitar and Piano&quot;, which was his first entirely acoustic album. He toured the album in early 2017.

In 2017, Johnson released &quot;Collage&quot;, which also coincided with the announcement of a tour revisiting his hit album &quot;Ah Via Musicom&quot;.

In the fall of 2018, he was invited to promote the Fender and Nissan collaboration for car stereo systems designed by Fender Audio.

In January 2020, Johnson released &quot;EJ: Volume II&quot;, which was a follow-up to his first acoustic album.

On September 12, 2023, Johnson was announced as a part of the G3 2024 Tour along with Steve Vai and Joe Satriani.

==Guitars and equipment==

===Guitars===
Johnson is best known for playing the lightly modified Fender Stratocasters and Gibson ES-335 electric guitars through either a Fender or Marshall amplifier, depending on whether he is targeting a clean rhythm, dirty rhythm, or lead tone. He tends to swap out the bridge pickups in some of his Stratocasters for DiMarzio HS-2 pickups, because they do not hum as much as standard single-coil pickups. Johnson has also played other guitar brands such as Robin, Rickenbacker, Jackson, Maton, and Charvel, one of which appears on the cover of the &quot;Ah Via Musicom&quot; album. In 2001, Johnson added a Gibson Custom Shop &#x27;59 Les Paul Reissue to his collection of guitars. Of note, he no longer uses a Dumble amplifier, as he had to replace a faulty component in his favorite Dumble, the Steel String Singer. It never sounded the same afterwards, and he sold the amplifier to Carlos Santana.

Johnson has had several models built to his specifications for sale in the mass market. In 2003, C. F. Martin &amp; Company released a limited-edition Eric Johnson Signature MC-40 guitar built for him. Johnson donated 5% of the guitar&#x27;s sales profit to his father&#x27;s college, Jefferson Medical College (now called the Thomas Jefferson University). Johnson has also been known to use the Martin D-45 before his signature Martin guitar was released.

In 2005, Fender released an Eric Johnson Signature Fender Stratocaster also built to his specifications. This was followed up by the Eric Johnson Signature Stratocaster Rosewood model in 2009. It featured the same specifications as the Eric Johnson Maple Neck guitar, but with the addition of an unusual three-ply, eight-hole white pick guard, hotter treble pickup, and a bound rosewood laminated fingerboard with pearloid dot position markers.

In January 2006, a man named Brian Sparks was arrested for posing as Johnson, and in the process, defrauding businesses out of about US$18,000 worth of guitars and equipment. Also in 2006, some of Johnson&#x27;s guitars that had been stolen 24 years earlier were recovered.

Johnson has also released other signature gear such as GHS Eric Johnson Nickel Rockers Electric Guitar Strings, DiMarzio DP211 Eric Johnson Signature Custom Pickups, and a Fulton-Webb amplifier. Jim Dunlop also has released an Eric Johnson signature Jazz III plectrum and an Eric Johnson signature Fuzz Face. The Eminence Eric Johnson signature 12&quot; alnico guitar speaker was introduced in 2012.

In early 2015, Roland Corporation announced the Eric Johnson Tone Capsule, an accessory to Roland Blues Cube amplifiers.

In March 2018, Fender released an Eric Johnson Signature Thinline Fender Stratocaster built to exactly the same specifications as his first signature Strat, the sole exception being that the guitar is a semihollow design. The guitar is available in Vintage White and two-color Sunburst, with quarter-sawn maple necks exclusively.

In early 2020, Fender announced the Eric Johnson &quot;Virginia&quot; Custom Shop Stratocaster, modeled after a 1954 Stratocaster he owned. The original &quot;Virginia&quot; was made out of sassafras and was featured extensively on &quot;Ah Via Musicom&quot; and &quot;Venus Isle&quot;.

===Johnson guitar collection===

Johnson generally does not collect guitars, as he is not interested in owning superfluous items. His collection is limited to the best-playing examples of the guitar he finds:

*1967 Flying V: Traded at a show for a 30s Dobro guitar, which he purchased just to swap for the Flying V.
*1964 SG Maestro Vibrola: An instrument famously played by George Harrison on stage and during the recording of several Beatles albums, Eric generally avoided SGs for being unable to stay in tune, but traded two Marshall amplifiers for this particular one for its ability to hold a tune extremely well.
*1962 Fender Stratocaster: This is the instrument stolen from his apartment in 1982. It had a Mustang pick up that Seymour Duncan had rewound himself. Found at a pawn shop 24 years later, Eric cross-referenced with serial numbers he had written down, and found the pawn shop had his stolen collection of guitars. He bought it back. It has 6.5 kΩ single-coil pickups (similar to the Seymour Duncan five two pickup available for purchase).
*1957 Fender Stratocaster: Bought at a show in Florida
*Undated early 80s Martin D45: A reissue of a prewar design purchased for him by his father after the 1982 incident
*1964 Gibson ES-335: Block inlay stop tail piece with lower output pickups, it has a ding from the photographer dropping equipment on it during the &quot;Venus Isle&quot; photo shoot.
*1966 Fender Bass VI: The replacement for one of the guitars stolen in the 1982 incident, it was featured on &quot;Bloom&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Tribute to Jerry Reed&quot; and &quot;On the Way to Love&quot; on &quot;Up Close&quot; and other tracks.
*Prototype EJ Signature Fender Stratocasters: Eric tours with the final prototypes sent to him before production began of his signature models, including the thinline, and is not using examples from the production lineup available in stores.

===Effects===
Johnson uses effect pedals such as the Dallas-Arbiter Fuzz Face, BK Butler Tube Driver, MXR KD IV Stereo Chorus, Vox CryBaby wah-wah, ToadWorks Barracuda flanger, Prescription Electronics Experience octave fuzz, Xotic AC Booster, MXR Flanger/Doubler, Electro-Harmonix Deluxe Memory Man delay, Boss Corporation DD-2 Digital Delay, MXR 1500 Digital Delay, Line 6 Echo Pro Studio Modeler, and up to two Maestro Echoplex tape delays. All of these are connected to multiple A/B boxes to create sounds and tones that are both clean and distorted. Dunlop has also begun selling Johnson&#x27;s signature Fuzz Face pedal.

===Recording===
In late 2006, Johnson switched from recording in analog to digital format.

<doc id="161648" wikidata="Q805218" url="?curid=161648" title="Balleny Islands">
<text>The Balleny Islands () are a series of uninhabited islands in the Southern Ocean extending from 66°15&#x27; to 67°35&#x27;S and 162°30&#x27; to 165°00&#x27;E. The group extends for about in a northwest–southeast direction. The islands are heavily glaciated and of volcanic origin. Glaciers project from their slopes into the sea. The islands were formed by the so-called Balleny hotspot.

The group includes three main islands: Young, Buckle and Sturge, which lie in a line from northwest to southeast, and several smaller islets and rocks:
*northeast of Young Island: Seal Rocks, Pillar
*southeast of Young Island: Row Island, Borradaile Island (with Swan Base shelter hut)
*south of Buckle Island: Scott Cone, Chinstrap Islet, Sabrina Islet (with Sabrina Refuge shelter hut), and the Monolith

The islands are claimed by New Zealand as part of the Ross Dependency (see Territorial claims in Antarctica).

== Islands and rocks from north to south ==

The islands&#x27; area totals and the highest point has been measured as or approximately (the unclimbed Brown Peak on Sturge Island).

The Antarctic Circle is close to Borradaile Island, in the eight-kilometre channel between Young and Buckle Islands. Buckle Island and the nearby Sabrina Island is home to several colonies of Adelie and chinstrap penguins.

== Recorded human visits to the islands ==
The English sealing captains John Balleny and Thomas Freeman first sighted the group in 1839. Balleny named the island group after himself and the individual islands after the London merchants whose financial backing had made the expedition possible. Freeman was the first person known to land on any of the islands on 9 February 1839, and this was the first recorded human landfall south of the Antarctic Circle.

Sealers sighted the islands in 1853 but did not land.

In February 2015 the islands were visited for three days by the New Zealand-Australia Antarctic Ecosystems Voyage under the auspices of the New Zealand National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research aboard the vessel RV Tangaroa, with the objective of studying marine life ecosystems of the islands, especially with reference to the humpback whale. This work followed up work done on a previous visit in 2010.

On 3 February 2017, personnel from the Swiss Polar Institute&#x27;s Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition visited the islands and carried out considerable photographic and video survey work which was intended to contribute to the first accurate mapping of the main islands. Most of the work was done by helicopter, although at least one landfall was also made on the islands by this expedition, using Zodiac inflatable boats.

== Geology ==
In the archipelago, the Buckle, Sturge and Young Islands are examples of stratovolcanoes. Strong earthquakes very close to the islands are rare, but tremors of moderate strength do occur over the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge, Macquarie triple junction and Pacific Rim between the Balleny Islands and Macquarie Island. Other earthquakes occur near the Southeast Indian Ridge and Balleny fracture zone, including a magnitude 8.1 earthquake in 1998 that struck just over west-northwest of the islands which changed the pattern of seismicity in a wide area around the islands.

It is possible that these islands are still volcanically active. The Brown Peak volcano may have had an eruption in 2001, based on satellite observation.

== Submerged features ==
Several underwater features lie close to the Balleny Islands:
* Balleny Seamounts
* Balleny Trough
* Umitaka Bank
* Vaughan Seamount

<doc id="161653" wikidata="Q2382513" url="?curid=161653" title="Hard power">
<text>In politics, hard power is the use of military and economic means to influence the behavior or interests of other political bodies. This form of political power is often aggressive (coercion), and is most immediately effective when imposed by one political body upon another of less military and/or economic power. Hard power contrasts with soft power, which comes from diplomacy, culture and history.

According to Joseph Nye, hard power involves &quot;the ability to use the carrots and sticks of economic and military might to make others follow your will&quot;. Here, &quot;carrots&quot; stand for inducements such as the reduction of trade barriers, the offer of an alliance or the promise of military protection. On the other hand, &quot;sticks&quot; represent threats - including the use of coercive diplomacy, the threat of military intervention, or the implementation of economic sanctions. Ernest Wilson describes hard power as the capacity to coerce &quot;another to act in ways in which that entity would not have acted otherwise&quot;.

==History==
While the existence of hard power has a long history, the term itself arose when Joseph Nye coined &quot;soft power&quot; as a new and different form of power in a sovereign state&#x27;s foreign policy. According to the realist school in international relations theory, power is linked with the possession of certain tangible resources, including population, territory, natural resources, economic and military strength, among others. Hard power describes a nation or political body&#x27;s ability to use economic incentives or military strength to influence other actors&#x27; behaviors.

Hard power encompasses a wide range of coercive policies, such as coercive diplomacy, economic sanctions, military action, and the forming of military alliances for deterrence and mutual defense. Hard power can be used to establish or change a state of political hegemony or balance of power. Although the term &quot;hard power&quot; generally refers to diplomacy, it can also be used to describe forms of negotiation which involve pressure or threats as leverage.

==Examples==
The United States has demonstrated a &#x27;hard power&#x27; policy in regard to the Iraq War, the Afghanistan War and its continued war on the Taliban. To be more specific, the United States&#x27; attack on Iraq in 2003 was initially justified based on concerns about Iraq&#x27;s possession of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). In part by referring to &quot;War on Terrorism,&quot; George W. Bush administration used hard power measures to uproot Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and to handle subsequent crisis in Iraq. 

Joseph Nye has used the term to define some policy measures in regard to Iran as well. For instance, there are many sanctions against Iran passed by UN Security Council and numerous nations such as the United States and those of the European Union also impose bilateral sanctions against Iran. They impose restrictions on exports of nuclear and missile to Iran, banking and insurance transactions, investment in oil, exports of refined petroleum products, and so on. Such measures are taken by many nations to deter Iran&#x27;s possible nuclear weapon programs because they wanted to ensure that the Islamic Republic of Iran is forced to negotiate a deal (p5 +1) in order to reduce its nuclear weapons programme which was steadily on its way to creating Iran into nuclear power. The economic sanctions imposed saw a major economic collapse of the Iranian economy in terms of inflation and GDP. This in may part was described as effective use of economic hard power compared to less effective attempts such as those on North Korea.

<text>In politics (and particularly in international politics), soft power is the ability to co-opt rather than coerce (in contrast with hard power). It involves shaping the preferences of others through appeal and attraction. Soft power is non-coercive, using culture, political values, and foreign policies to enact change. In 2012, Joseph Nye of Harvard University explained that with soft power, &quot;the best propaganda is not propaganda&quot;, further explaining that during the Information Age, &quot;credibility is the scarcest resource&quot;.

Nye popularised the term in his 1990 book, &quot;Bound to Lead: The Changing Nature of American Power&quot;.

In this book he wrote: &quot;when one country gets other countries to want what it wants might be called co-optive or soft power in contrast with the hard or command power of ordering others to do what it wants&quot;. He further developed the concept in his 2004 book, &quot;Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics&quot;.

== Description ==
The Oxford English Dictionary records the phrase &quot;soft power&quot; (meaning &quot;power (of a nation, state, alliance, etc.) deriving from economic and cultural influence, rather than coercion or military strength&quot;) from 1985.
Joseph Nye popularized the concept of &quot;soft power&quot; in the late 1980s.
For Nye, power is the ability to influence the behavior of others to get the outcomes you want. There are several ways one can achieve this: one can coerce others with threats; one can induce them with payments; or one can attract and co-opt them to want what one wants. This soft power – getting others to want the outcomes one wants – co-opts people rather than coerces them.

Soft power contrasts with &quot;hard power&quot; - the use of coercion and payment. Soft power can be wielded not just by states but also by all actors in international politics, such as NGOs or international institutions. It is also considered by some an example of the &quot;second face of power&quot;
that indirectly allows one to obtain the outcomes one wants.
A country&#x27;s soft power, according to Nye, rests on three resources: &quot;its culture (in places where it is attractive to others), its political values (when it lives up to them at home and abroad), and its foreign policies (when others see them as legitimate and having moral authority).&quot;

Soft power resources are the assets that produce attraction, which often leads to acquiescence. Nye asserts that, &quot;Seduction is always more effective than coercion, and many values like democracy, human rights, and individual opportunities are deeply seductive.&quot; Angelo Codevilla observed that an often overlooked essential aspect of soft power is that different parts of populations are attracted or repelled by different things, ideas, images, or prospects. Soft power is hampered when policies, culture, or values repel others instead of attracting them.

In his book, Nye argues that soft power is a more difficult instrument for governments to wield than hard power for two reasons: many of its critical resources are outside the control of governments, and soft power tends to &quot;work indirectly by shaping the environment for policy, and sometimes takes years to produce the desired outcomes.&quot; The book identifies three broad categories of soft power: &quot;culture&quot;, &quot;political values&quot;, and &quot;policies.&quot;

In &quot;The Future of Power&quot; (2011), Nye reiterates that soft power is a descriptive, rather than a normative, concept. Therefore, soft power can be wielded for nefarious purposes. &quot;Hitler, Stalin, and Mao all possessed a great deal of soft power in the eyes of their acolytes, but that did not make it good. It is not necessarily better to twist minds than to twist arms.&quot; Nye also claims that soft power does not contradict the international relations theory of realism. &quot;Soft power is not a form of idealism or liberalism. It is simply a form of power, one way of getting desired outcomes.&quot;

== Limitations of the concept ==
Soft power has been criticized as being ineffective by authors such as Niall Ferguson in the preface to &quot;Colossus&quot;. Neorealist and other rationalist and neorationalist authors (with the exception of Stephen Walt) dismiss soft power out of hand as they assert that actors in international relations respond to only two types of incentives: economic incentives and force.

As a concept, it can be difficult to distinguish soft power from hard power. For example, Janice Bially Mattern argues that George W. Bush&#x27;s use of the phrase &quot;you are either with us or with the terrorists&quot; was in fact an exercise of hard power. Though military and economic force was not used to pressure other states to join its coalition, a kind of force – representational force – was used. This kind of force threatens the identity of its partners, forcing them to comply or risk being labeled as evil. This being the case, soft power is therefore not so soft.

There are also recent articles about the concept&#x27;s neglect of its defensive use. Since Nye&#x27;s approach &quot;mainly focuses on how to get others to do your bidding&quot;, some researchers argued that rising powers, such as China, are creating new approaches to soft power, thus using it defensively.

Additionally, others have argued that more attention needs to be paid towards locating and understanding how actors&#x27; attempts at soft power can backfire, leading to reputational damage or loss, or what has been termed &#x27;soft disempowerment&#x27;.

Amit Kumar Gupta has written on what he regards as a flaw in the definition provided by Nye, and has made an effort to redefine the concept. Citing Nye&#x27;s definition, the author writes that, &quot;a country&#x27;s behaviour in the international platform is not in the least determined by the other parties&#x27; attraction in soft power terms. Every country weighs its interest and follows its convictions before taking any decision.&quot; Gupta proposes the terms &quot;positive soft power&quot; and &quot;negative soft power&quot; to replace Nye&#x27;s definition.

== Measurement ==
An initial undertaking to measure soft power through a composite index was published by the Institute for Government (IfG) and the media company &quot;Monocle&quot; in 2010. The IfG-Monocle Soft Power Index, created by then IfG senior researcher Jonathan McClory, combined a range of statistical metrics and subjective panel scores to measure the soft power resources of 26 countries. The metrics were organized according to a framework of five sub-indices including culture, diplomacy, education, business/innovation, and government. The index is said to measure the soft power resources of countries, and does not translate directly into ability influence. &quot;Monocle&quot; has published an annual &quot;Soft Power Survey&quot; since then. As of 2016/17, the list is calculated using around 50 factors that indicate the use of soft power, including the number of cultural missions (primarily language schools), Olympic medals, the quality of a country&#x27;s architecture and business brands.

&quot;The Soft Power 30&quot;, which includes a foreword by Joseph Nye, is a ranking of countries&#x27; soft power produced and published by the media company &quot;Portland&quot; in 2015. The ranking is based on &quot;the quality of a country&#x27;s political institutions, the extent of their cultural appeal, the strength of their diplomatic network, the global reputation of their higher education system, the attractiveness of their economic model, and a country&#x27;s digital engagement with the world.&quot;

The &quot;Elcano Global Presence Report&quot; scores the EU first for soft presence. Soft power, then, represents the third behavioral way of getting the outcomes you want. Soft power is contrasted with hard power, which has historically been the predominant realist measure of national power, through quantitative metrics such as population size, concrete military assets, or a nation&#x27;s gross domestic product. But having such resources does not always produce the desired outcomes, as the United States discovered in the Vietnam War.

The success of soft power heavily depends on the actor&#x27;s reputation within the international community, as well as the flow of information between actors. Thus, soft power is often associated with the rise of globalization and neoliberal international relations theory. Popular culture and mass media are regularly identified as a source of soft power, as is the spread of a national language or a particular set of normative structures. More particularly, international news was found crucial in shaping the image and reputation of foreign countries. The high prominence of the US in international news, for example, has been linked to its soft power. Positive news coverage was associated with positive international views, while negative news coverage with negative views.

== Research ==
Academics have engaged in several debates around soft power. These have included:
* Its usefulness (Giulio Gallarotti, Niall Ferguson, Josef Joffe, Robert Kagan, Ken Waltz, Mearsheimer vs Nye, Katzenstein, Janice Bially Mattern, Jacques Hymans, Alexander Vuving, Jan Mellisen)
* How soft power and hard power interact (Giulio Gallarotti, Joseph Nye)
* Whether soft power can be coercive or manipulative, (Janice Bially Mattern, Katzenstein, Duvall &amp; Barnet vs Nye, Vuving)
* How the relationship between structure and agency work (Hymans vs Nye)
* Whether soft balancing is occurring (Wohlforth &amp; Brooks vs Walt &quot;et al.&quot;.)
* Soft power and normative power in Europe (Ian Manners, A Ciambra, Thomas Diez, A Hyde Pryce, Richard Whitman)
* How civil resistance (i.e., non-violent forms of resistance) can often involve certain uses of soft power, but remains a distinct concept (Adam Roberts, Timothy Garton Ash)

== Examples ==

=== Worldwide ===
The Soviet Union competed with the U.S. for influence throughout the Cold War. The Soviets were engaged in a broad campaign to convince the world of the attractiveness of its Communist system. In 1945, the Soviet Union was very effective in attracting many in Europe from its resistance to Hitler, and in colonized areas around the world because of its opposition to European imperialism. The Soviets also employed a substantially large public diplomacy program that included: promoting their high culture, broadcasting, disseminating information about the West, and sponsoring nuclear protests, peace movements, and youth organizations. Despite all of this, the Soviets&#x27; closed system and lack of popular culture impeded the ability of the Soviet Union to compete with the U.S. in terms of soft power.

A number of non-democratic governments have attempted to use migration as an instrument of soft power: Egypt under the rule of Gamal Abdel Nasser trained and dispatched thousands of teachers across the Arab world in an effort to spread ideas of anti-colonialism and anti-Zionism. In Cuba, the Fidel Castro regime&#x27;s medical internationalism programme has dispatched thousands of medical professionals abroad for cultural diplomacy purposes. The Chinese-sponsored Confucius Institutes across the world rely on Chinese teachers in order to strengthen the country&#x27;s soft power abroad.

The United States and Europe have consistently been sources of influence and soft power. European culture&#x27;s art, literature, music, design, fashion, and even food have been global magnets for some time. Europe and the U.S. have often claimed to support human rights and international law throughout the world. In 2012, the European Union was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize &quot;for over six decades [it has] contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe.&quot; In 2019, the U.S. has the second largest diplomatic network in the world, the largest number of foreign journalists based in the country, and is the most popular destination for international students. American films, television, music, advertising, fashion, food, economic models, political culture, and literature have contributed to the Americanization of other cultures.

Asia and more recently China have been working to use the potential soft power assets that are present in the admiration of their ancient cultures, arts, fashion and cuisine. China is presenting itself as a defender of national sovereignty, which became an issue after the NATO air campaign to oust Colonel Muammar Gaddafi and NATO&#x27;s support of the rebels in Libya. The Chinese are also competing with the United States to gain influence throughout the South Pacific, however some commentators have said their recent assertiveness in this region has created an appeal for nations in this region to align with the United States thus increasing U.S. soft power in this area.

Soft power extends beyond the operations of government, to the activities of the private sector and to society and culture at large. Soft power has gained more influence because it addresses the underlying dispositions of the people who have increasingly become more active in their governments. This is true even in authoritarian countries where people and institutions are increasingly able to shape the debate.

=== Australia ===
According to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Commonwealth Government, Australia maintains a good reputation thanks to “its democracy, rule of law, strong economy, quality education, cutting-edge science, multiculturalism and environmental protections”, enabling to its citizens and institutions to “speak with confidence and credibility in the world stage”. Education has remained central to Australia&#x27;s soft power, being one of the most recognized education powerhouses in the world with more than 700,000 international students enrolled. In 2023, Australia&#x27;s nation branding was ranked as the world&#x27;s ninth strongest according to the Nation Brand Index, which positions Australia as an attractive place for tourism and foreign investment: it perceives the world&#x27;s eighth largest tourism receipts and it is the 16th largest FDI receptor.

=== Middle East ===
The Middle East has been an area in which soft power has been employed by both regional and outside actors. Small states, such as Qatar, frequently employ soft-power strategies, including the use of al-Jazeera and the hosting of sports events, in their foreign policymaking. Outside powers, such as the United States or China, also employ soft power in terms of expanding their influence across the Middle East. Competition amongst states of the Middle East often involves the use of soft power, as in the case of Egyptian-Israeli rivalry over Africa, or Saudi-Iranian relations.

=== Iran ===
Iran’s soft power, driven by its Shia Islamic ideology, Iranian-Persian background, civilization and history, the legacy of the 1979 Iranian Revolution and Anti-Zionist stance exerts significant influence in the Middle East, the broader Islamic world, Central Asia, Africa and even the West. Central to this influence is the promotion of anti-imperialist, Islamic, and Shia ideologies like Khomeinism and political interpretation of Shia Islam, which have fostered strong ties with the Muslim world, especially countries in the &quot;Axis of Resistance&quot; such as Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen that have led to the foundation of many Islamic and Shia groups such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, Islamic Resistance groups in Iraq, Islamic Jihad in Palestine and many others across the region. Iran also promotes the idea of a &quot;Greater Iran,&quot; connecting culturally and ideologically with Persian-speaking nations like Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, where the Persian language plays a unifying role.

In the Islamic world, Iran’s influence extends beyond its borders, particularly in countries of the Axis of Resistance and other countries like Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and the Muslim world, where Shia communities often look to Iran for religious guidance and political inspiration, and some Sunnis support the Axis of Resistance and are attracted by Iran&#x27;s anti-Israeli policies in countries like Palestine, Qatar and Syria. Iran&#x27;s cultural and religious outreach, including media, educational exchanges, and religious diplomacy, strengthens its ties with Shia and Islamic populations worldwide. Iran&#x27;s anti-imperialist and anti-colonial stance, rooted in the 1979 Islamic Revolution, is attractive to many. By positioning itself as a defender of sovereignty against U.S. influence, Iran resonates with anti-globalization movements and intellectuals critical of Western interventionism.

In Latin America, Iran’s solidarity with anti-imperialist governments, like Venezuela, strengthens ties based on mutual resistance to U.S. domination, promoting a shared vision of self-determination. Iran’s ideological message, combining anti-imperialism, Islamic and Shia values, Iranian cultural and historical roots, and cultural diplomacy, has made it a significant actor on the regional and world stage, inspiring and fostering relations with a diverse range of countries committed to challenging Western domination and promoting an alternative vision of global order.

=== China ===

China&#x27;s traditional culture has been a source of attraction, building on which it has created several hundred Confucius Institutes around the world to teach its language and culture. The enrollment of foreign students in China has increased from 36,000 a decade before to at least 240,000 in 2010. China is the most popular country in Asia for international students, the leading destination globally for Anglophone African students, and the second most popular education powerhouse in the world. China&#x27;s Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank has attracted many Western countries to join. China has the largest diplomatic network in the world, overtaking the US in 2019. The provision of Chinese medical aid during the COVID-19 pandemic has been dubbed &quot;facemask diplomacy&quot;.

=== France ===
According to a 2018 study in the &quot;American Sociological Review&quot;, France had greater influence on European geopolitics than Britain in the 18th century because of its cultural and symbolic power.

=== Germany ===
The annual soft power rankings by &quot;Monocle&quot; magazine and the Institute for Government ranks 30 countries which &quot;best attract favor from other nations through culture, sport, cuisine, design, diplomacy and beyond.&quot; &quot;Monocle&quot; magazine said: &quot;Merkel may be painted as a stern taskmaster but it seems she has a softer side, or the country she leads does.&quot; It said Germany&#x27;s rise as a soft power should not come as a surprise. &quot;The country is traditionally excellent at pursuing its ideas, values and aims using diplomatic, cultural and economic tools,&quot; it said. &quot;By quietly doing the simple things well it is a country that has become a global power and the rest of us can feel comfortable with that.&quot; Germans had been understandably wary about depicting a dominant image abroad, the magazine added, but it said that the country&#x27;s rise should not make everyone else feel uncomfortable. In 2017, Germany had the eighth largest diplomatic network in the world.

=== India ===

The five pillars of India&#x27;s soft power—dignity, dialogue, shared prosperity, regional and global security, and cultural and civilizational links—are strategically employed to enhance its global influence. On May 21, 2021, the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) announced plans to use Indian cuisine as a form of soft power, emphasizing its role in showcasing India&#x27;s cultural heritage. 
Additionally, the soft power of India in Africa has been reflected in cultural exchanges, including the influence of Bollywood movies, the spread of yoga practices, and the involvement of the Indian diaspora. 

=== Italy ===
The elements of Italian soft culture are its art, music, fashion, design, and food. Italy was the birthplace of opera, and for generations the language of opera was Italian. Popular tastes in drama in Italy have long favored comedy; the improvisational style known as the &quot;Commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot; began in Italy in the mid-16th century and is still performed today. Before being exported to France and Russia, Ballet also originated in Italy.
The country boasts several world-famous cities: Rome was the ancient capital of the Roman Empire and seat of the Pope of the Catholic Church. Rome is generally considered one of the &quot;cradles of Western civilization and Christian culture&quot;. Florence was the heart of the Renaissance, a period of great achievements in the arts which marked the transition from the Middle Ages to modernity. Other important cities include Turin, one of the world&#x27;s great centers of automobile engineering. Milan is one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; fashion capitals. Venice, with its intricate canal system and history of seafaring, attracts tourists from all over the world especially during the Venetian Carnival and the Venice Biennale.
Italy is home to the greatest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites (59) to date. In 2019, Italy had the ninth largest diplomatic network in the world. Italy is the fifth most visited country in the World.

=== Japan ===

&quot;Cool Japan&quot; is a concept coined in 2002 as an expression of Japan&#x27;s popular culture. The concept has been adopted by the Japanese government as well as trade bodies seeking to exploit the commercial capital of the country&#x27;s culture industry. It has been described as a form of soft power, &quot;the ability to indirectly influence behavior or interests through cultural or ideological means.&quot; In a 2002 article in the journal &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; titled &quot;Japan&#x27;s Gross National Cool&quot;, Douglas McGray wrote of Japan &quot;reinventing superpower&quot; as its cultural influence expanded internationally despite the economic and political problems of the &quot;lost decade.&quot; Surveying youth culture and the role of J-pop, manga, anime, video game, fashion, film, automobiles, consumer electronics, architecture, and cuisine, McGray highlighted Japan&#x27;s considerable soft power, posing the question of what message the country might project. He also argued that Japan&#x27;s recession may even have boosted its national cool, due to the partial discrediting of erstwhile rigid social hierarchies and big-business career paths. In 2015, during remarks welcoming Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to the White House, President Barack Obama thanked Japan for its cultural contributions to the United States by saying:

In 2017, Japan had the fifth largest diplomatic network in the world. Anime, manga and Japanese films are considered to be soft power. In April 2023, the Japan Business Federation laid out a proposal aiming to spur the economic growth of Japan by further promoting the contents industry abroad, primarily anime, manga and video games, for measures to invite industry experts from abroad to come to Japan to work, and to link with the tourism sector to help foreign fans of manga and anime visit sites across the country associated with particular manga stories. The federation seeks on quadrupling the sales of Japanese content in overseas markets within the upcoming 10 years. In 2023, U.S. News &amp; World Report ranked Japan&#x27;s cultural influence as the highest in Asia and 5th worldwide. Today, the culture of Japan stands as one of the most influential cultures around the world, mainly because of the global reach of its popular culture. Currently, the worldwide spread of Japanese popular culture can most often be seen in the Western world, Latin America, Arab World, East and Southeast Asia.

=== Russia ===

Russia has been developing its soft power by investing in various public diplomacy instruments throughout the 2000s but the term was first used in an official document in 2010 as President Medvedev approved an Addendum to the national Foreign Policy Concept. The term was not defined but it was described as related to cultural diplomacy. In 2013, the term appeared in a new version of the Foreign Policy Concept where the soft power was defined as &quot;a comprehensive toolkit for achieving foreign policy objectives building on civil society potential, information, cultural and other methods and technologies alternative to traditional diplomacy.&quot; In 2007, Russian President Vladimir Putin was named &quot;Time&quot; Person of the Year. In 2013, he was named most powerful person by Forbes magazine. In 2015, Russia led the creation of the Eurasian Economic Union. In 2017, Russia had the fourth largest diplomatic network in the world. In the wake of the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in 2018, the BBC reported that &quot;Its extensive diplomatic network reflects both its imperial history as a great power in the 19th Century, as well as its Cold War posture. It has a multitude of posts in Eastern Europe and former communist allies including China, Vietnam, Cuba and Angola, as well as legacies of the former USSR in Africa and Asia. The size of its network reflects the extent of its undiminished global ambition.&quot;

=== South Korea ===

&quot;Hallyu&quot;, also known as the &quot;Korean Wave&quot;, is a neologism referring to the spread of South Korean culture since the late 1990s. According to a &quot;Washington Post&quot; reporter, the spread of South Korean entertainment has led to higher sales of other goods and services such as food, clothing, and Korean language classes. Besides increasing the amount of exports, the &quot;Korean Wave&quot; is used by the government as a soft power tool to engage with the masses of young people all over the world. 

In 2012, the BBC&#x27;s country rating poll revealed that public opinion of South Korea has been improving every year since the first rating poll for the country was conducted in 2009. In several countries such as Taiwan, India, France and Japan, public opinion about South Korea is generally positive. The report cited culture and tradition as among the most important factors contributing to positive perceptions of South Korea. This comes alongside a rapid growth in the total value of cultural exports which rose to US$4.2 billion in 2011. And as of 2021, South Korea&#x27;s cultural content industry has exports of $12.45 billion.

First driven by the spread of Korean dramas televised across East, South and Southeast Asia during its initial stages, the &quot;Korean Wave&quot; evolved from a regional development into a global phenomenon due to the proliferation of Korean pop (K-pop) music videos on YouTube. Developed far beyond YouTube, the most successful K-pop band, BTS, is valued to be worth US$5 billion, generating impressive revenue for South Korea. Currently, the spread of the &quot;Korean Wave&quot; to other regions of the world is most visibly seen among teenagers and young adults in East Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, and immigrant enclaves of the Western world.

===Spain===
The main power of the Age of Discovery, Spain began the conquest of the New World in 1492, giving rise to the Spanish Empire. Controlling vast portions of the Americas, parts of Africa, various territories in Asia, Oceania, as well as territory in other parts of Europe, the Spanish Empire became, in conjunction with the Portuguese, the first empire to achieve a global scale and one of the largest empires in history. The Hispanic culture is the legacy of the vast and prolonged Spanish Empire, whose cultural background is primarily associated with Spain, regardless of racial or geographical differences. The whole sense of identity of the Hispanic population and the Hispanophones is sometimes referred by the term &quot;Hispanidad&quot; (Hispanicity).

Since the so-called &quot;Siglo de Oro&quot;, a period of flourishing in arts and literature in Spain coinciding with the political rise of the Spanish Empire under the Catholic Monarchs and the Spanish Habsburgs, the Spanish art, architecture, music, literature, poetry, painting, and cuisine have been influential worldwide, particularly in Western Europe and the Americas. As a reflection of its large cultural wealth, Spain has one of the world&#x27;s largest numbers of World Heritage Sites and is the world&#x27;s second-most visited country. Its cultural influence extends over 600 million Hispanophones, making Spanish language the world&#x27;s second-most spoken native language and the world&#x27;s most widely spoken Romance language.

=== United Kingdom ===
Since the 1814–1914 century of &quot;Pax Britannica&quot; the foreign relations of the United Kingdom has held a significant soft power component.

British influence can be observed in the legal and political systems of many of its former colonies, and the UK&#x27;s culture remains globally influential, particularly in language, literature, music and sport. English is the most widely spoken Germanic language as well as the world&#x27;s most widely spoken language and the third-most spoken native language. It is a co-official language of the United Nations, the European Union, and many other international and regional organisations. It has also become the &quot;de facto&quot; language of diplomacy, science, international trade, tourism, aviation, entertainment and the internet.

=== United States ===
The foreign relations of the United States has long had a great deal of soft power. Examples of the impact include Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s four freedoms in Europe to motivate the Allies in World War II; people behind the Iron Curtain listening to the government&#x27;s foreign propaganda arm Radio Free Europe; newly liberated Afghans in 2001 asking for a copy of the Bill of Rights and young Afghans today surreptitiously watching banned American videos and satellite television broadcasts in the privacy of their homes. America&#x27;s early commitment to religious toleration, for example, was a powerful element of its overall appeal to potential immigrants; and American aid in the reconstruction of Europe after World War II was a propaganda victory to show off the prosperity and the generosity of the people of the United States.

American culture has been embraced around the world for many decades. Due to America&#x27;s superpower status, American culture is often seen as &quot;hegemonic&quot;. American dominance and the popularization of American media largely contributed to the English language (particularly American English) becoming the global lingua franca. American music has had a wide influence over the development of music around the globe. American architecture and urban planning, American political and economic philosophy, and American film and television have played strong roles in shaping both western and non-western culture. American cuisine, fashion trends, literature, theatre, and dance have also widely influenced global culture of the modern era, and various subcultures that were born in the United States, such as the hippie, hip-hop, punk rock, rock and roll, greaser, grunge, and Beatnik movements (among others), have influenced mainstream culture of the 20th and 21st centuries. American technology and social media companies hold a monopoly over the world&#x27;s digital space.

Studies of American broadcasting into the Soviet bloc, and testimonials from Czech president Václav Havel, Polish president Lech Wałęsa, and Russian president Boris Yeltsin, support that soft power efforts of the United States and its allies during the Cold War were ultimately successful in creating the favorable conditions that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union.

<text>Scott Island is a small uninhabited island of volcanic origin in the Ross Sea, Southern Ocean, northeast of Cape Adare, the northeastern extremity of Victoria Land, Antarctica. It is long north–south, and between and wide, reaching a height of and covering an area of . Haggits Pillar, a stack reaching in height and measuring in diameter, yielding an area of less than , is located west of the island. The island has two small coves with beaches, the rest of the island being surrounded by high cliffs. One of the coves is on the northeastern coast and the other opposite Haggitts Pillar on the western coast of the island.

The island was discovered and landed upon on 25 December 1902 by captain William Colbeck, commander of the SY &quot;Morning&quot;, the relief ship for Robert Scott&#x27;s expedition. Colbeck originally planned to name the island Markham Island, after Sir Clements Markham, but later decided to name it after Scott. Haggits Pillar is named after Colbeck&#x27;s mother&#x27;s family name, Haggit. In 2006, a mapping expedition to the Ross Sea found the islands north of their previously determined position.

Scott Island is part of the Ross Dependency, claimed by New Zealand (see Territorial claims of Antarctica).

There was an automatic weather station on the island from December 1987 to March 1999.
The records show an average temperature of a few °C (°F) below in summer, and down to in winter.

On 12 February 2009 Andrew Perry and Molly Kendall, crew members of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society&#x27;s ship MY &quot;Steve Irwin&quot;, were married on the island by captain Paul Watson.

<doc id="161672" wikidata="Q485665" url="?curid=161672" title="Progress Party (Norway)">
<text>The Progress Party (; , FrP; ), is a political party in Norway. It is generally positioned to the right of the Conservative Party, and is considered the most right-wing party to be represented in parliament. The FrP has traditionally self-identified as classical-liberal and as a libertarian party. It is often described as right-wing populist, which has been disputed in public discourse, and has been described by various academics as far-right. By 2020, the party attained a growing national conservative faction. After the 2017 parliamentary election, it was Norway&#x27;s third largest political party, with 26 representatives in the Storting. It was a partner in the government coalition led by the Conservative Party from 2013 to 2020.

The Progress Party focuses on law and order, downsizing the bureaucracy and the public sector; the FrP self-identifies as an economic liberal party which competes with the left to represent the workers of Norway. The party has officially opposed Norwegian membership in the European Union since 2016, after having been neutral on the issue before. The Progress Party calls for a strict immigration policy, integration of immigrants and for the removal of illegal immigrants or foreigners who commit crimes. During its time in coalition government from 2013, the party oversaw the creation of a Minister for Integration and increased the process of deporting failed asylum seekers or migrants with criminal convictions. It has been described as anti-immigration; nevertheless, the FrP also supports free migration to and from the European Union through the European Economic Area as well as helping refugees through the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Progress Party has been amenable to receiving Ukrainian refugees.

The Progress Party was founded by Anders Lange in 1973 as an anti-tax protest movement. Its development was greatly influenced by Carl I. Hagen, the party&#x27;s long-standing leader between 1978 and 2006. Siv Jensen served as the party leader between 2006 and 2021, when in February 2021 she announced that she would be stepping down at the next party convention in May. She was succeeded by her deputy leader, Sylvi Listhaug on 8 May 2021.

== History ==
=== Anders Lange&#x27;s Party ===

The Progress Party was founded at a meeting at the movie theater &quot;Saga Kino&quot; in Oslo on 8 April 1973, attended by around 1,345 people. An address speech was held by Anders Lange, after whom the party was named the Anders Lange&#x27;s Party for a Strong Reduction in Taxes, Duties and Public Intervention, commonly known as Anders Lange&#x27;s Party (ALP). Lange had some political experience from the interwar era Fatherland League and was part of the Norwegian resistance movement during the Second World War. Since the end of the war, he had worked as an independent right-wing political editor and public speaker. Lange held his first public speech as chairman of ALP at Youngstorget in Oslo on 16 May the same year. ALP was to a large extent inspired by the Danish Progress Party, which was founded by Mogens Glistrup. Glistrup also spoke at the event, which gathered around 4,000 attendees.

Originally, Anders Lange wanted the party to be an anti-tax protest movement rather than a common political party. The party had a brief political platform on a single sheet of paper that on one side listed ten things the party was &quot;tired of&quot;, and on the other side ten things that they were in favour of. The protest was directed against what Lange claimed to be an unacceptable high level of taxes and subsidies. In the 1973 parliamentary election, the party won 5% of the vote and gained four seats in the Norwegian parliament. The main reasons for the success has later been seen by scholars as a mixture of tax protests, the charisma of Anders Lange, the role of television, the aftermath of the 1972 European Community membership referendum and the political development in Denmark. The first party conference was held in Hjelmeland in 1974, where the party established its first political conventions.

=== Progress Party and Carl I. Hagen ===
In early 1974, Kristofer Almås, Deputy Member of Parliament Carl I. Hagen, along with some others, broke away and formed the short-lived Reform Party. The background for this was a criticism of ALPs &quot;undemocratic organisation&quot; and lack of a real party program. However, in the same year, Anders Lange died; consequently Hagen stepped in as a regular Member of Parliament in Lange&#x27;s place. As a result, the Reform Party merged back into ALP already the following year. The party adopted its current name, the &quot;Progress Party&quot;, on 29 January 1977, inspired by the great success of the Danish Progress Party. The Progress Party performed poorly in the 1977 parliamentary election, and was left without parliamentary representation. In the 1978 party convention, Carl I. Hagen was elected as party chairman. Hagen soon started to expand the political program of the party, and built a conventional party organisation, a step which Lange and some of his followers had opposed. The party&#x27;s youth organisation, the Progress Party&#x27;s Youth, was also established in 1978. Hagen succeeded in sharpening the image of the party as an anti-tax movement. His criticism of the wisdom of hoarding billions of dollars in the &quot;Oil Fund&quot; hit a nerve owing to perceived declines in infrastructure, schools, and social services and long queues at hospitals.

=== 1980s: establishing the party ===

While the Progress Party dropped out of parliament altogether in 1977, it returned in the following 1981 parliamentary election with four representatives. In this election, the political right in general had a great upturn, which garnered the Progress Party increased support. The ideology of the party was sharpened in the 1980s, and the party officially declared that it was a libertarian party at its national convention in Sandefjord in 1983. Until then, the party had not had a clearly defined ideology. In the campaign for the 1985 parliamentary election, the party attacked many aspects of the Norwegian welfare state, and campaigned for privatization of medical care, education and government-owned enterprises as well as steep cuts in income tax. In the election, the party lost two of its four members of parliament, but was left with some power as they became the kingmaker. In May 1986, the party used this position to effectively throw out the governing Conservative-led government after it had proposed to increase gas taxes. A minority Labour government was established as a result.

The first real breakthrough for the party in Norwegian politics came in the 1987 local elections, when the party nearly doubled its support from 6.3% to 12.3% (county results). This was largely as immigration was for the first time seriously taken up as an issue by the party (although Hagen had already in the late 1970s called for a strongly restrictive immigration policy), successfully putting the issue on the national agenda. Its campaign had mainly been focused on the issue of asylum seekers, but was additionally helped by the infamous &quot;Mustafa-letter&quot;, a letter read out by Hagen during the electoral campaign that portrayed the future Islamisation of Norway. In April 1988 the party was for the first time the second largest party in Norway in an opinion poll with 23.5%. In September 1988, the party further proposed in parliament for a referendum on the immigration policy, which was regarded by political scientists as the start of the party&#x27;s 1989 election campaign. In 1989, the party made its breakthrough in national politics. In the 1989 parliamentary election, the party obtained 13%, up from 3.7% in 1985, and became the third largest party in Norway. It started to gain power in some local administrations. The first mayors from the party were Håkon Rege in Sola (1988–1989), Bjørn Bråthen in Råde (1990–1991) and Peter N. Myhre in Oslo (1990–1991).

=== 1990s: libertarian-wing schism and consolidation ===

The 1993 parliamentary election halved the party&#x27;s support to 6.3% and ten members of parliament. This drop in support can be seen as the result of an internal conflict within the party that came to a head in 1992, between the more radical libertarian minority and the majority led by Carl I. Hagen. The right-libertarians, or simply libertarians, had removed the party&#x27;s focus on immigration, declaring it a &quot;non-issue&quot; in the early 1990s, which was heavily punished by voters in 1993 as well as 1991. Social conservative policy platforms had also been liberalised and caused controversy such as accepting homosexual partnership. The party&#x27;s unclear stance on Norwegian membership of the European Union also contributed greatly to the setback, by moving the focus away from the party&#x27;s stronger issues such as during the 1994 Norwegian European Union membership referendum.

While many of the libertarians, including Pål Atle Skjervengen and Tor Mikkel Wara, had left the party before the 1993 election or had been rejected by voters, the conflict finally culminated in 1994. Following the party conference at &quot;Bolkesjø Hotell&quot; in Telemark in April of that year, four MPs of the &quot;libertarian wing&quot; in the party broke off as independents. This was because Hagen had given them an ultimatum to adhere to the political line of the party majority and parliamentary group, or else to leave. This incident was later nicknamed &quot;Dolkesjø&quot;, a pun on the name of the hotel, with &quot;dolke&quot; meaning to &quot;lit. stab (in the back) /betray&quot;.

These events have been seen by political scientists as a turning point for the party. Subsequently, the libertarians founded a libertarian organisation called the Free Democrats, which attempted to establish a political party but without success. Parts of the younger management of the party and the more libertarian youth organisation of the party also broke away and even tried to disestablish the entire youth organisation. The youth organisation was however soon running again, this time with more &quot;loyal&quot; members, although it remained more libertarian than its mother organisation. After this, the Progress Party had a more right-wing populist profile, which resulted in its gaining electoral support.

In the 1995 local elections, the Progress Party regained the level of support seen at the 1987 elections. This was said largely to have been as a result of a focus on Progress Party core issues in the electoral campaign, especially immigration, as well as the party dominating the media picture as a result of the controversy around the 1995 Norwegian Association meeting at Godlia kino. The latter particularly gained the party many sympathy votes, as a result of the harsh media storm targeted against Hagen. In the 1997 parliamentary election, the party obtained 15.3% of the vote, and for the first time became the second largest political party in Norway. The 1999 local elections resulted in the party&#x27;s first mayor as a direct result of an election, Terje Søviknes in Os. 20 municipalities also elected a deputy mayor from the Progress Party.

=== 2000–2001: turmoil and expulsion of populists ===
While the Progress Party had witnessed close to 35% support in opinion polls in late 2000, its support fell back to 1997 levels in the upcoming election in 2001. This was largely a result of turmoil surrounding the party. The party&#x27;s deputy leader Terje Søviknes became involved in a sex scandal, and internal political conflicts came to the surface; Hagen had already in 1999 tried to quiet the most controversial immigration opponents in the parliamentary party, who had gained influence since the 1994 national convention. In late 2000 and early 2001, opposition to this locally in Oslo, Hordaland and Vest-Agder sometimes resulted in expulsions of local representatives. Eventually Hagen also, in various ways, got rid of the so-called &quot;gang of seven&quot; (&quot;syverbanden&quot;), which consisted of seven members of parliament. In January 2001, Hagen claimed that he had seen a pattern where these had cooperated on several issues, and postulated that they were behind a conspiracy to eventually get Øystein Hedstrøm elected as party chairman. The seven were eventually suspended, excluded from or voluntarily left the party, starting in early 2001. They most notably included Vidar Kleppe (the alleged &quot;leader&quot;), Dag Danielsen, Fridtjof Frank Gundersen, as well as Jan Simonsen. Only Hedstrøm remained in the party, but was subsequently kept away from publicly discussing immigration issues.

This again caused turmoil within the party; supporters of the excluded members criticized their treatment, some resigned from the party, and some of the party&#x27;s local chapters were closed. Some of the outcasts ran for office in the 2001 election in several new county lists, and later some formed a new party called the Democrats, with Kleppe as chairman and Simonsen as deputy chairman. Though the &quot;gang of seven&quot; took controversial positions on immigration, the actions taken against them were also based on internal issues; it remains unclear to what degree the settlement was based primarily on political disagreements or tactical considerations. Hagen&#x27;s main goal with the &quot;purge&quot; was an attempt to make it possible for non-socialist parties to cooperate in an eventual government together with the Progress Party. In 2007, he revealed that he had received &quot;clear signals&quot; from politicians in among other the Christian Democratic Party, that government negotiations were out of the question so long as certain specific Progress Party politicians, including Kleppe and Simonsen (but not Hedstrøm), remained in the party. The more moderate libertarian minority in Oslo, including Henning Holstad, Svenn Kristiansen and Siv Jensen, now improved their hold in the party.

=== 2001–2005: Bondevik II years ===
In the 2001 parliamentary election, the party lost the gains it had made according to opinion polling but maintained its position from the 1997 election, it got 14.6% and 26 members in the parliament. The election result allowed them to unseat the Labour Party government of Jens Stoltenberg and replace it with a three-party coalition led by Christian Democrat Kjell Magne Bondevik. However, the coalition continued to decline to govern together with the Progress Party as they considered the political differences too large. The Progress Party eventually decided to tolerate the coalition, as it promised to invest more in defence, open more private hospitals and open for more competition in the public sector. In 2002 the Progress Party again advanced in the opinion polls and for a while became the largest party.

The local elections of 2003 were a success for the party. In 36 municipalities, the party gained more votes than any other; it succeeded in electing the mayor in only 13 of these, but also secured 40 deputy mayor positions. The Progress Party had participated in local elections since 1975, but until 2003 had only secured a mayoral position four times, all on separate occasions. The Progress Party vote in Os—the only municipality that elected a Progress Party mayor in 1999—increased from 36.6% in 1999 to 45.7% in 2003. The party also became the single largest in the counties of Vestfold and Rogaland.

In the 2005 parliamentary elections, the party again became the second largest party in the Norwegian parliament, with 22.1% of the votes and 38 seats, a major increase from 2001. Although the centre-right government of Bondevik which the Progress Party had tolerated since 2001 was beaten by the leftist Red-Green Coalition, Hagen had before the election said that his party would no longer accept Bondevik as Prime Minister, following his consistent refusal to formally include the Progress Party in government. For the first time, the party was also successful in getting members of parliament elected from all counties of Norway, and even became the largest party in three: Vest-Agder, Rogaland and Møre og Romsdal. After the parliamentary elections in 2005, the party also became the largest party in many opinion polls. The Progress Party led November 2006 opinion polls with a support of 32.9% of respondents, and it continued to poll above 25 percent during the following years.

=== 2006–2021: Siv Jensen ===
In 2006, after 27 years as leader of the party, Hagen stepped down to become Vice President of the Norwegian parliament Stortinget. Siv Jensen was chosen as his successor, with the hope that she could increase the party&#x27;s appeal to voters, build bridges to centre-right parties, and head or participate in a future government of Norway. Following the local elections of 2007, Progress Party candidates became mayor in 17 municipalities, seven of these continuing on from 2003. Deputy mayors for the party however decreased to 33. The party in general strongly increased its support in municipalities where the mayor had been elected from the Progress Party in 2003.

In the months before the 2009 parliamentary elections, the party had, as in the 2001 election, rated very highly in opinion poll results which however declined towards the actual election. Earlier in the year, the Progress Party had achieved above 30% in some polls which made it the largest party by several percentage points. With such high gains, the election result was in this case relatively disappointing. Before the election the gains continued to decrease, with most of these losses going to the Conservative Party which had a surprisingly successful campaign. The decline in support over a longer period of time can also be seen as the Labour Party was since 2008 accused of &quot;stealing&quot; policies from the Progress Party. The Progress Party did, regardless, achieve a slight gain from the 2005 election with 22.9%, the best election result in the party&#x27;s history. It also for the first time got represented in the Sami Parliament of Norway in 2009, with three representatives. This made it the fourth largest party in the Sami parliament, and second largest of the nationwide parties. In the 2009 informal school elections, it became the largest party in Norway with 24% of the votes.

While other parties before had refused the Progress Party&#x27;s efforts to join governing coalitions at the national level owing to concerns about the party&#x27;s alleged populism and positions on immigration issues, after the election the Conservative Party stated they wanted to be &quot;a bridge between the Progress Party and the centre.&quot; The position arose as the Progress Party vowed to not support any government coalition that it itself was not a part of, while centrist parties rejected participating in a government coalition together with the party.

Since early 2010, opinion polls regularly showed a majority support for the Progress Party and Conservative Party together. The Progress Party however saw a strong setback for the 2011 local elections. The party lost 6% in vote share, while the Conservative Party gained 9%. According to political scientists, most of the setback could be explained by a low turnout of Progress Party supporters.
In coalition with the Conservative Party, the party won the 2013 parliamentary election and helped form its first ever government, the Solberg&#x27;s Cabinet, although the Progress Party itself lost seats and is now the third largest party instead of the second largest. The parties won renewed support for the government in the 2017 parliamentary election, which was expanded to include the centrist Liberal Party and the Christian Democratic Party in 2018.

The Progress Party withdrew from the government coalition in January 2020. The cause of the withdrawal was repatriation to Norway of a Norwegian citizen who volunteered in the Islamic State. The position of the Progress Party was that no such person should receive assistance to return to Norway. The Solberg cabinet undertook the repatriation despite the protests from the Progress Party, over what they considered humanitarian considerations.

=== 2021–present: Sylvi Listhaug ===
In February 2021, Jensen announced that she would stand down as party leader. She was replaced by former deputy leader and immigration minister Sylvi Listhaug in May 2021. Listhaug had previously been endorsed as a potential future leader by both Jensen and former chairman Carl I. Hagen.

== Ideology and political positions ==
The party officially identifies itself in the preamble of its platform as a liberal (&quot;liberalistisk&quot;; &quot;liberal&quot;, &quot;libertarian&quot;) party, built on Norwegian and Western traditions and cultural heritage, with a basis in a Christian understanding of life and humanist values. Its main declared goal is a strong reduction in taxes and government intervention.

Many within the party reject the description of the party as liberal. The party has a wing that identifies itself as economically liberal or libertarian, and a wing that identifies itself as national-conservative and focuses strongly on anti-immigration politics. According to scholar Anders Ravik Jupskås, the national conservative faction has been gaining ground in the 2010s; while members of the party leadership tend to identify as liberals or libertarians, the national conservative wing has strong support among the membership. The party&#x27;s largest chapter, the Oslo chapter, adopted a resolution that calls for the party to declare itself as national conservative and to replace liberalism with a &quot;Norway first&quot; policy aiming at making Norway a &quot;patriotic beacon&quot; in Europe, with a focus on anti-immigration politics and rejection of the scientific consensus on climate change, that includes &quot;a complete ban on non-western immigration&quot; and a referendum on immigration; the Oslo chapter&#x27;s MP Christian Tybring-Gjedde said that &quot;very few people agree&quot; with the stated ideology of liberalism in the party programme because &quot;liberalism in its extreme form means open borders&quot; and because &quot;liberalism is a dead ideology.&quot; Christian Tybring-Gjedde was later expelled from the Progress Party in 2024. Former party leader Carl I. Hagen has supported this initiative, stating that liberal values do not belong in the Progress Party and arguing that the party should become national conservative instead of &quot;liberal extremist&quot;. The Progress Party has often been described by academics as right-wing populist, to the disagreement of the party and some observers, including former Prime Minister Erna Solberg and professor Cas Mudde. Various academics have also described the Progress Party as far-right.

The core issues for the party revolve around immigration, crime, foreign aid, the elderly and social security in regards to health and care for the elderly. The party is regarded as having policies on the right in most of these cases, both fiscally and socially, though in some cases, like care for the elderly, the policy is regarded as being on the left. It has been claimed that the party changed in its first three decades, in turn from an &quot;outsider movement&quot; in the 1970s, to American-style libertarianism in the 1980s, to right-wing populism in the 1990s. From the 2000s, the party has to some extent sought to moderate its profile in order to seek government cooperation with centre-right parties. This has been especially true since the expulsion of certain members around 2001, and further under the lead of Siv Jensen from 2006, when the party has tried to move and position itself more towards conservatism and also seek cooperation with such parties abroad. The party values are officially focused on civil liberties, individualism and limited government. A local group within the party, centered around Oslo, expressed a desire for a more nationalistic policy, inspired by the Centre Party. They emphasize patriotism and openly prioritize the interests of Norway and the Norwegian people in a &quot;Norway first&quot; policy. They also promote a complete halt to non-western immigration, and express support for climate change denial. The party has often criticised and called for a reduction of Norwegian foreign aid. The program of the party considers humanitarian action abroad to be preferable, when possible, to receiving refugees from affected areas.

=== Health care ===
The party has for decades been a proponent for shortening wait times for hospital treatment in Norway. 270,000 Norwegians were waiting for medical treatment in 2012–13. In the OECD publication &quot;Health at a Glance 2011&quot;, Norway had among the longest wait times for elective surgery and specialist appointments among eleven countries surveyed. Since 2013, the Solberg Cabinet has been successful in reducing the average wait times for hospital care.

=== Economy ===
The party aims to reduce the power of the state and the public sector. It believes that the public sector should only be there to secure a minimum standard of living, and that individuals, businesses and organisations should take care of various tasks instead of the public sector, in most cases. The party also generally advocates the lowering of taxes, various duties as well increased market economy. The party also notably want to invest more of Norway&#x27;s oil wealth in infrastructure (particularly roads, broadband capacity, hospitals, schools and nursing homes) and the welfare state. This position, that has used a sense of a welfare crisis to support demands to spend more of the oil fund now rather than later, is part of its electoral success.

The party wants to strongly reduce taxation in Norway, and says that the money Norwegians earn, is theirs to be kept. They want to remove inheritance tax and property tax. The party advocates increased spending of Norway&#x27;s Oil Fund on investments in infrastructure and aims to eliminate the existing budgetary rules which set a limit on such spending.

=== Society ===
The party regards the family to be a natural, necessary and fundamental element in a free society. It regards the family to be a carrier of traditions and culture, and to have a role in raising and caring for children. The party also wants all children to have a right of visitation and care from both parents, and to secure everyone&#x27;s right to know who their biological parents are. The party opposed the legalization of same-sex marriage in 2008, questioning how children would &quot;cope&quot; with the law. In schools, the party wants to improve the working environment for teachers and students by focusing more on order, discipline and class management. The party wants more individual adaptation, to implement grades in basic subjects from fifth grade, open more private schools and decrease the amount of theory in vocational educations.

During the national convention in May 2013, the party voted in favor of both same-sex marriage and same-sex adoption. The party has for several years been a proponent for legalizing blood donation for homosexuals.

The party believes that artists should be less dependent on public support, and instead be more dependent on making a living on what they create. The party believes that regular people should rather decide what good culture is, and demands that artists on public support should offer something the audience wants. It also wants to abolish the annual licence fee for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation and privatise the company. Otherwise, the party wants to protect and secure Norwegian cultural heritage.

Since the party distances itself from discrimination and special treatment based on gender, religion and ethnic origin, the party wants to dissolve the Sami Parliament of Norway, which is based on ethnic classifications. The party wants to uphold Sami culture, but wants to work against any special treatment based on ethnic origin regarding the right of use of water and land.

The party is also a proponent of a ban on wearing the burka and niqab in public spaces, schools and universities, first proposing the idea in 2010. This policy for schools and universities was ultimately achieved in 2018.

=== Law and order ===

The party supports an increase in police forces, and more visible police on the streets. It wants to implement tougher punishments, especially for crime regarding violence and morality offences. The party also wants to establish an ombudsman for victims and relatives, as it believes today&#x27;s supportive concern focus too much on the criminals rather than the victims. It wants the police to be able to use more non-lethal weapons, such as electroshock weapons. It also does not accept any use of religious or political symbols with the police uniform, and wants to expel foreign citizens who are convicted of crime with a frame of more than three months imprisonment.

=== Immigration ===
From the second half of the 1980s, the economic and welfare aspects of immigration policy were mainly a focus of Progress Party criticism, including the strains placed by immigration on the welfare state. During the 1990s the party shifted to focus more on cultural issues and conflicts, a development which can also be seen in the general public debate, including among its political opponents. In 1993, it was the first party in Norway to use the notion of &quot;integration politics&quot; in its party programme. While the party has made numerous proposals on immigration in parliament, it has rarely received majority support for them. Its proposals has largely been rejected by the remaining political parties, as well as the mass media. Although the party&#x27;s immigration policies have been compared to those of the Danish People&#x27;s Party and the Sweden Democrats, leading party members have rather chosen to compare its immigration policies with those of the Dutch People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy and the Danish , when those parties were in government.
Generally, the party wants a stricter immigration policy, so that only those who are in need of protection according to the UN Refugee Convention are allowed to stay in Norway. Progress Party MPs have also stated that high levels of immigration combined with poor integration leads to both Norwegian and broadly Western values such as tolerance, freedom of speech and democracy being undermined and that politicians on the political left have enabled social issues through relaxing immigration policies. In a speech in the 2007 election campaign, Siv Jensen claimed that the immigration policy was a failure because it let criminals stay in Norway, while throwing out people who worked hard and followed the law. The party claims the immigration and integration policy to be naïve. In 2008, the party wanted to &quot;avoid illiterates and other poorly resourced groups who we see are not able to adapt in Norway&quot;; which included countries as Somalia, Afghanistan and Pakistan. The party opposes that asylum seekers are allowed stay in Norway on humanitarian grounds or due to health issues, and seeks to substantially limit the number of family reunifications. The party has also called for a referendum on the general immigration policy. In government, the party supported creating a Minister for Integration in the cabinet and a zero tolerance policy on illegal immigration combined with deportation of illegal immigrants and non-citizens who had committed serious felonies. Some commentators noted that Norway deported a record number of failed asylum seekers and illegal residents during the period when the party provided support to the Conservatives from 2013 to 2021.

The Progress Party is also opposed to repatriating Norwegian citizens who leave the country to join terrorist organisations such as Islamic State and withdrew their support to the Solberg cabinet in January 2020 over the government&#x27;s decision to repatriate a Norwegian national on humanitarian grounds who had escaped to join ISIS.

A poll conducted by &quot;Utrop&quot; in August 2009 showed that 10% (14% if the respondents answering &quot;Don&#x27;t know&quot; are removed) of immigrants in Norway would vote for the Progress Party, only beaten by the Labour Party (38% and 56% respectively), when asked. More specifically, this constituted 9% of both African and Eastern European immigrants, 22% of Western European immigrants and 3% of Asian immigrants. Politicians with immigrant background are increasingly active in the party, most notably Iranian-Norwegian Mazyar Keshvari and former leader of the youth party, Indian-Norwegian Himanshu Gulati.

=== Foreign policy ===
The Progress Party was for many years open to a referendum on Norwegian membership of the European Union, although only if a majority of the public opinion was seen to favour it beforehand. The party eventually grew to consider membership of Norway in the European Union to be a &quot;non-issue&quot;, believing there to be no reason for a debate of a new referendum. In 2016, the party officially adopted a position against Norwegian membership in the EU.

The party regards NATO to be a positive basic element of Norway&#x27;s defense, security and foreign policy. It also wants to strengthen transatlantic relations in general, and Norway&#x27;s relationship with the United States more specifically. The party considers its international policy to &quot;follow in the footsteps of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher.&quot;

Of all the major political parties in Norway, the Progress Party has shown the strongest support for Israel. In 2009, it supported the right of Israel to defend itself against rocket attacks from Hamas, and was the only party in Norway which supported Israel through the 2008-9 Gaza War. The party has for many years also wanted to relocate the Norwegian embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

The party sees the most viable form of foreign aid policy to be for developing countries to gradually manage themselves without Western aid. It believes that free trade is the key for developing countries to gain economic growth, and that &quot;the relationship between aid and development is at best unclear.&quot; The party is strongly critical of &quot;forced contribution to government development aid through taxation&quot;, which it wants to limit, also as it believe this weakens the individual&#x27;s personal sense of responsibility and generosity (voluntary aid). The party instead supports an increase in support for global health and vaccination initiatives against global epidemics such as HIV, AIDS and tuberculosis, and to increase the support after emergencies and disasters.

== International relations ==
The Progress Party does not belong to any international political groups, and does not have any official sister parties. Historically the party has not compared itself to other European parties, and has sought to rather establish its own identity. An international secretary for the party in the same year said that the party had been connected with a &quot;misunderstood right-wing radical label&quot;, partly because people with nationalistic and &quot;hopeless attitudes&quot; had previously been involved in the party. Such persons were said no longer to be involved.

The Progress Party was originally inspired by its Danish counterpart, the Progress Party, which ultimately lost parliamentary representation and fell into the fringes of Danish politics. In recent years, the Norwegian party has rather considered Denmark&#x27;s Venstre to be its sister party. Although Venstre formally is aligned with the Norwegian Liberal Party, some politicians of the party has voiced support for the Progress Party. The party has been compared by some journalists to the Danish People&#x27;s Party while others such as political scientist Cas Mudde has regarded the Progress Party to be somewhere in between these two parties. Some prominent individual Progress Party politicians. including former Justice Minister Per-Willy Amundsen and former MP Christian Tybring-Gjedde support an official partnership with Sweden Democrats (SD), although historically the party at large has not supported such collaboration. In 2022, party leader Sylvi Listhaug stated that she welcomed the SD&#x27;s growth in votes and supported the party during the 2022 Swedish general election, but has stated that while her party has common ground with the Sweden Democrats on immigration and law &amp; order, differences in economic policy prevent the Progress Party from considering the SD as a sister party and that the Progress Party as a whole was not looking to build any international alliances.

While the party has been compared by some commentators to European populist parties ranging from the French National Front and the Dutch Pim Fortuyn List, the Progress Party has often distanced itself from parties on the extreme right and has turned down offers of alliances from other European far-right parties. In 2009 the British Conservative Party invited party leader Siv Jensen to hold a lecture in the House of Commons, which was seen as a further recognition of the party internationally.

In the United States, the Progress Party generally supports the Republican Party, and was in 2010 called &quot;friends&quot; by the Republican Party chairman as he said he looked forward to the &quot;continued growth of the party and free market conservative principles.&quot; The party has also been described as Reaganite. Party leader Siv Jensen attended the 2008 Republican National Convention in Saint Paul, Minnesota. In 2018, former Frp parliamentary member Christian Tybring-Gjedde and former Minister of Justice Per-Willy Amundsen nominated President Donald Trump for the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize. Trump was nominated due to his historic summit in North Korea and due to his work for &quot;disarmament, peace, and reconciliation between North and South Korea.&quot;

<text>The Dungeons of Moria, usually referred to as simply Moria, is a computer game inspired by J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s novel &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. The objective of the game is to dive deep into the Mines of Moria and kill the Balrog. Moria, along with &quot;Hack&quot; (1984) and &quot;Larn&quot; (1986), is considered to be the first roguelike game, and the first to include a town level.

&quot;Moria&quot; was the basis of the better known &quot;Angband&quot; roguelike game, and influenced the preliminary design of Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Diablo&quot;.

== Gameplay ==
The player&#x27;s goal is to descend to the depths of Moria to defeat the Balrog, akin to a boss battle. As with &quot;Rogue&quot;, levels are not persistent: when the player leaves the level and then tries to return, a new level is procedurally generated. Among other improvements to &quot;Rogue&quot;, there is a persistent town at the highest level where players can buy and sell equipment.

&quot;Moria&quot; begins with creation of a character. The player first chooses a &quot;race&quot; from the following: Human, Half-Elf, Elf, Halfling, Gnome, Dwarf, Half-Orc, or Half-Troll. Racial selection determines base statistics and class availability. One then selects the character&#x27;s &quot;class&quot; from the following: Warrior, Mage, Priest, Rogue, Ranger, or Paladin. Class further determines statistics, as well as the abilities acquired during gameplay. Mages, Rangers, and Rogues can learn magic, while Priests and Paladins can learn prayers. Warriors possess no additional abilities.

The player begins the game with a limited number of items on a town level consisting of six shops: (1) a General Store, (2) an Armory, (3) a Weaponsmith, (4) a Temple, (5) an Alchemy shop, and (6) a Magic-Users store. A staircase on this level descends into a series of randomly generated underground mazes. Deeper levels contain more powerful monsters and better treasures. Each time the player ascends or descends a staircase, a new level is created and the old one discarded; only the town persists throughout the game.

As in most roguelikes, it is impossible to reload from a save if the player&#x27;s character dies, as the game saves the state only upon exit, preventing save-scumming that is a key strategy in most computer games that allow saving, although it is possible to save the file that is generated by the game (MORIA.SAV in the Windows version) to a backup location, then restore/replace that file after the character had been killed.

The balrog (represented by the upper-case letter B) is encountered at the deepest depths of the dungeon. Once the balrog has been killed, the game has been won, and no further saving of the game is possible.

=== Player characteristics ===

The player has many characteristics in the game. Some characteristics, like sex, weight, and height, cannot be changed once the player has been created, while other characteristics like strength, intelligence, and armor class can be modified by using certain items in a particular way. Mana and hit points are replenished by rest or by some other magical means. Gold accrues as the player steps on gems or currency. Experience accrues as the player performs various actions in the dungeon, mostly by killing creatures. The &quot;miscellaneous abilities&quot; are modified as each skill is performed and as the player increases in experience.

== History ==
Around 1981, while enrolled at the University of Oklahoma, Robert Alan Koeneke became hooked on playing the video game &quot;Rogue&quot;. Soon after, Koeneke moved departments to work on an early VAX-11/780 minicomputer running VMS operating system, which at that time had no games. Since no longer having access to &quot;Rogue&quot; was &quot;intolerable&quot; for Koeneke, he started developing his own &quot;Rogue&quot; game using VMS BASIC and gave it the name, Moria Beta 1.0.

During the summer of 1983, Koeneke rewrote his game in VMS Pascal, releasing Moria 1.0.

In 1983/84 Jimmey Wayne Todd Jr. joined Koeneke on the development of &quot;Moria&quot;, bringing with him his character generator, and working on various aspects of the game, including the death routines.

Koeneke started distributing the source code in 1985 under a license that permitted sharing and modification, but not commercial use.

The last VMS version was &quot;Moria&quot; 4.8, released in November 1986.

In February 1987, James E. Wilson started converting the VMS Pascal source code to the C programming language for use on UNIX systems, which had started to become popular by this date. To distinguish his release from the original VMS Moria, Wilson named it UNIX Moria, shortened to UMoria.

UMoria 4.85 was released on November 5, 1987.

As C was a much more portable programming language than VMS Pascal, there was an explosion of &quot;Moria&quot; ports for a variety of different computer systems such as MS-DOS, Amiga, Atari ST and Apple II.

UMoria 5.0, released in 1989, unified these separate ports into a single code base, fixing many bugs and gameplay balance issues, as well as adding lots of new features; many of which were taken from &quot;BRUCE Moria&quot; (1988).

In 1990 the &quot;Angband&quot; project was started, which is based on the UMoria 5.2.1 source code.

UMoria was in continuous development for several more years, with UMoria 5.5.2 released on July 21, 1994.

During the early 2000s David Grabiner maintained the code base, releasing only minor compiler related fixes.

In 2008, through the work of the free-moria project, UMoria was relicensed under the GNU General Public License. Work has since continued on the game, with regular releases.

<doc id="161678" wikidata="Q294945" url="?curid=161678" title="Antiochus VII Sidetes">
<text>Antiochus VII Euergetes (; 164/160 BC129 BC), nicknamed Sidetes () (from Side, a city in Asia Minor), also known as Antiochus the Pious, was ruler of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire from July/August 138 to 129 BC. He was the last Seleucid king of any stature. After Antiochus was killed in battle, the Seleucid realm was restricted to Syria.

== Biography ==
===Early life and early reign===
He was one of the sons of Demetrius I Soter, the brother of Demetrius II Nicator and his mother may have been Laodice V. Antiochus was elevated after Demetrius was captured by the Parthians. He married Cleopatra Thea, who had been the wife of Demetrius. Their offspring was Antiochus IX, who thus became both half-brother and cousin to Seleucus V and Antiochus VIII.

In his nine-year reign, Antiochus made some effort to undo the massive territorial and authority losses of recent decades. Antiochus defeated the usurper Diodotus Tryphon at Dora and laid siege to Jerusalem in 134 BC. During the siege he allowed a seven-day truce for the Jews to celebrate a religious festival, impressing the Jewish leadership. According to Josephus the Hasmonean leader John Hyrcanus opened King David&#x27;s sepulchre and removed three thousand talents, which he then paid Antiochus to spare the city. Nevertheless, King Antiochus&#x27; respectful treatment of the Jews, and respect for their religion, earned him their gratitude and added name &quot;Euergetes&quot; (&quot;the Benefactor&quot;). With no Jewish sources of that time (the Book of Maccabees ends a few years before his time), it is unclear if the siege of Jerusalem ended with a decisive Seleucid victory or simply a peace treaty. Furthermore, Jewish forces later assisted Antiochus in his wars, and for nearly 20 years after his death, John Hyrcanus refrained from attacking areas under Seleucid control.

===Later territory disputes and defeat===

Antiochus spent the final years of his life attempting to reclaim the lost eastern territories, overrun by the Parthians under their &quot;Great King&quot;, Mithridates I. Marching east, with what would prove to be the last great Seleucid royal army (including a unit of Judean troops under John Hyrcanus), he defeated Mithridates in two battles. He restored Mesopotamia, Babylonia and Media to the Seleucid empire, before dispersing his army into winter quarters.

The Seleucid king and army spent the winter feasting, hunting and drinking (the Seleucids maintained the Macedonian tradition of heavy drinking). As with any time an army is quartered upon a population, tensions soon grew between the locals and the Syrian troops.

The new Parthian ruler, Phraates II, had not been idle. He raised a new army while stirring up rebellion in the Seleucid occupied towns of Media. Hoping to further sow dissension amongst his foes, Phraates also released his long-held prisoner, Demetrius II, Antiochus&#x27; older brother, who returned to Syria to reclaim the throne.

That winter (130–129 BC), several Median towns rose in rebellion and attacked their Seleucid garrisons. Antiochus marched to support one such isolated garrison with only a small force (probably only his Royal Guards). In a barren valley, he was ambushed and killed in the Battle of Ecbatana by Phraates II and a large force of Parthians, who had entered the country without being detected. Most Greco-Roman historians state that Antiochus died in battle; the victorious Parthians claimed that he killed himself because of fear, an assertion also made by Appian.
=== Succession ===
Antiochus&#x27;s confirmed heir was Antiochus IX Cyzicenus. But a fragment from book 16 of Posidonius&#x27; &quot;Histories&quot;, which survives in the Deipnosophistae written by Athenaeus, mentions a king named Seleucus, who was captured in Media by king Arsaces and treated like royalty. The identity of this Seleucus have been a matter of debate; the possibility of Seleucus being a son of Antiochus VII captured after the death of his father is suggested by Felix Jacoby and, with reservations, by Ian G. Kidd.

<doc id="161681" wikidata="Q1591480" url="?curid=161681" title="Parents Music Resource Center">
<text>The Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) was an American committee formed in 1985 with the stated goal of increasing parental control over the access of children to music deemed to have violent, drug-related, or sexual themes via labeling albums with Parental Advisory stickers. The committee was founded by four women known as the &quot;Washington Wives&quot;—a reference to their husbands&#x27; connections with government in the Washington, D.C. area. The women who founded the PMRC are Tipper Gore, wife of Senator and later Vice President Al Gore; Susan Baker, wife of Treasury Secretary James Baker; Pam Howar, wife of Washington realtor Raymond Howar; and Sally Nevius, wife of former Washington City Council Chairman John Nevius. The PMRC eventually grew to include 22 participants before shutting down in the mid-to-late 1990s.

== Early history ==
The Parents Music Resource Center was founded in May 1985. The group&#x27;s formation was cemented with the financial help of Mike Love of the Beach Boys, and Joseph Coors, the owner of Coors beers. Both had actively supported Reagan&#x27;s candidacy, and Coors offered offices to the PMRC.

== Actions ==
As a method of combating this alleged problem, the PMRC suggested a voluntary move by the RIAA and the music industry to develop music labeling in the form of a rating system similar to the film rating system developed by the Motion Picture Association of America. Additional suggestions from the PMRC that appeared in an article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; included: printing warnings and lyrics on album covers, requiring record stores to put albums with explicit covers under the counters, pressuring television stations not to broadcast explicit songs or videos, &quot;reassess[ing]&quot; the contracts of musicians who performed violently or sexually in concert, and creating a panel to set industry standards.

== Filthy Fifteen ==

One of the actions taken by the PMRC was compiling a list of fifteen songs in popular music, at the time, that they found the most objectionable. This list is known as the &quot;Filthy Fifteen&quot; and consists of the following songs along with the lyrical content category for which each song was considered objectionable:

== Senate hearing ==
In August 1985, 19 record companies agreed to put &quot;Parental Guidance: Explicit Lyrics&quot; labels on albums to warn consumers of explicit lyrical content. Before the labels could be put into place, the Senate agreed to hold a hearing on so-called &quot;porn rock&quot;. The hearing was held on September 19, 1985, when representatives from the PMRC, three musicians—Dee Snider, Frank Zappa, John Denver—and Senators Paula Hawkins, Al Gore, and others testified before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee on &quot;the subject of the content of certain sound recordings and suggestions that recording packages be labeled to provide a warning to prospective purchasers of sexually explicit or other potentially offensive content.&quot;

=== Supporting witnesses ===
Paula Hawkins presented three record covers (&quot;Pyromania&quot; by Def Leppard, &quot;W.O.W.&quot; by Wendy O. Williams, and &quot;W.A.S.P.&quot; by W.A.S.P.) and the music videos for &quot;Hot for Teacher&quot; by Van Halen, and &quot;We&#x27;re Not Gonna Take It&quot; by Twisted Sister, commenting: &quot;Much has changed since Elvis&#x27; seemingly innocent times. Subtleties, suggestions, and innuendo have given way to overt expressions and descriptions of often violent sexual acts, drug taking, and flirtations with the occult. The record album covers to me are self-explanatory.&quot;

Susan Baker testified that &quot;There certainly are many causes for these ills in our society, but it is our contention that the pervasive messages aimed at children which promote and glorify suicide, rape, sadomasochism, and so on, have to be numbered among the contributing factors.&quot; Tipper Gore asked record companies to voluntarily &quot;plac[e] a warning label on music products inappropriate for younger children due to explicit sexual or violent lyrics.&quot;

National PTA Vice President for Legislative Activity Millie Waterman related the PTA&#x27;s role in the debate, and proposed printing the symbol &quot;R&quot; on the cover of recordings containing &quot;explicit sexual language, violence, profanity, the occult and glorification of drugs and alcohol&quot;, and providing lyrics for &quot;R&quot;-labeled albums.

In addition, Dr. Joe Stuessy, a music professor at the University of Texas at San Antonio, spoke regarding the power of music to influence behavior. He argued that heavy metal was different from earlier forms of music such as jazz and rock and roll because it was &quot;church music&quot; and &quot;had as one of its central elements the element of hatred.&quot; Dr. Paul King, a child and adolescent psychiatrist, testified on the deification of heavy metal musicians, and to the presentation of heavy metal as a religion. He also stated that &quot;many&quot; adolescents read deeply into song lyrics.

=== Opposing witnesses ===
During his statement, musician and producer Frank Zappa asserted that &quot;the PMRC proposal is an ill-conceived piece of nonsense which fails to deliver any real benefits to children, infringes the civil liberties of people who are not children, and promises to keep the courts busy for years dealing with the interpretational and enforcemental problems inherent in the proposal&#x27;s design.&quot; He went on to state his suspicion that the hearings were a front for H.R. 2911, a proposed blank tape tax: &quot;The major record labels need to have H.R. 2911 whiz through a few committees before anybody smells a rat. One of them is chaired by Senator Thurmond. Is it a coincidence that Mrs. Thurmond is affiliated with the PMRC?&quot; Zappa had earlier stated about the Senate&#x27;s agreement to hold a hearing on the matter that &quot;A couple of blowjobs here and there and Bingo!—you get a hearing.&quot;

Folk rock musician John Denver referred to the proposed labels as censorship and stated he was &quot;strongly opposed to censorship of any kind in our society or anywhere else in the world&quot;, and that in his experience censors often misinterpret music, as was the case with his song &quot;Rocky Mountain High&quot;. He further compared the PMRC proposals to Nazi book burnings, and expressed his belief that censorship is ultimately counterproductive: &quot;That which is denied becomes that which is most desired, and that which is hidden becomes that which is most interesting. Consequently, a great deal of time and energy is spent trying to get at what is being kept from you.&quot; When Denver came up to give his speech, many expected him to side with the PMRC.

Dee Snider, frontman and lead singer of the heavy metal band Twisted Sister, testified that he &quot;[did] not support ... [RIAA president] Gortikov&#x27;s unnecessary and unfortunate decision to agree to a so-called generic label on some selected records&quot;. Like John Denver, Snider felt that his music had been misinterpreted. He defended the Twisted Sister songs &quot;Under the Blade&quot;, which had been interpreted by the PMRC as referring to sadomasochism, bondage, and rape, and &quot;We&#x27;re Not Gonna Take It&quot;, which the PMRC accused of promoting violence. Snider told the panel that &quot;Under the Blade&quot; was inspired by a band member&#x27;s surgery and was about the fear he imagined one would experience undergoing surgery, announcing that &quot;the only sadomasochism, bondage, and rape in this song is in the mind of Ms. Gore.&quot; He further stated &quot;Ms. Gore was looking for sadomasochism and bondage, and she found it. Someone looking for surgical references would have found it as well.&quot; Snider concluded that &quot;The full responsibility for defending my children falls on the shoulders of my wife and I, because there is no one else capable of making these judgments for us.&quot;

Notable snippets of audio from the hearing found their way into Zappa&#x27;s audiocollage &quot;Porn Wars&quot;, released on the &quot;Frank Zappa Meets the Mothers of Prevention&quot; album. Senators Gore, Hollings, Gorton, Hawkins, and others appeared. The album cover featured a parody of the RIAA warning label. The LP included a note to listeners to send to Zappa&#x27;s Barking Pumpkin Records for a free &quot;Z-PAC&quot;, a printed information package that included transcripts of the committee hearing, and a letter from Zappa encouraging young people to register to vote. Zappa&#x27;s full testimonial was released on a posthumous 2010 compilation called &quot;Congress Shall Make No Law...&quot;

== Parental Advisory sticker ==
On November 1, 1985, before the hearing ended, the RIAA agreed to put &quot;Parental Advisory&quot; labels on selected releases at their own discretion. The labels were generic, unlike the original idea of a descriptive label categorizing the explicit lyrics. Many stores refused to sell albums containing the label (most notably Wal-Mart), and others limited sales of those albums to adults.

It is uncertain whether the &quot;Tipper sticker&quot; is effective at preventing children from being exposed to explicit content. Some, citing the &quot;forbidden-fruit effect&quot;, suggest that the sticker in fact increases record sales. Philip Bailey of Earth, Wind &amp; Fire said that &quot;for the most part [the sticker] might even sell more records in some areas – all you&#x27;ve got to do is tell somebody this is a no-no and then that&#x27;s what they want to go see.&quot; Ice-T&#x27;s track &quot;Freedom of Speech&quot; contains the lyrics: &quot;Hey, PMRC, you stupid fuckin&#x27; assholes/The sticker on the record is what makes &#x27;em sell gold./Can&#x27;t you see, you alcoholic idiots/The more you try to suppress us, the larger we get.&quot; While lyrics from the Furnaceface song &quot;We Love You, Tipper Gore&quot;, from their 1991 album &quot;Just Buy It&quot;, suggest that the label &quot;only whets my appetite ... only makes us want to hear it that much more&quot;.

== Musician reaction ==
Many musicians have criticized or parodied the PMRC and Tipper Gore:
* &quot;In a world with major pollution and guns ablaze,&quot; John Lydon marveled, &quot;they have to pick on someone using foul language.&quot;
* Judas Priest&#x27;s song &quot;Parental Guidance&quot; from 1986 album &quot;Turbo&quot; was allegedly written as a response to Tipper Gore&#x27;s attack on the band and on heavy metal in general.
* In the Motley Crue cover version of the song &quot;Anarchy in the UK&quot; the altered lyrics referencing the PMRC as well as the U.S. government law enforcement, &quot;Is this the PMRC? Is this the DEA or is this the CIA? I thought it was the U.S.A.&quot;
* In 1987, the punk rock band NOFX released an EP titled &quot;The P.M.R.C. Can Suck on This.&quot;
* Danzig&#x27;s 1988 song &quot;Mother&quot; scored a top 50 hit as the most famous song about the PMRC labeling and its inherent problems (&quot;Mother/Tell your children not to walk my way/Tell your children not to hear my words/What they mean, what they say, mother&quot;). 
* Some prints of Metallica&#x27;s 1986 album &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; contained a parody warning, shaped like a stop sign, that read &quot;THE ONLY TRACK YOU PROBABLY WON&#x27;T WANT TO PLAY IS &quot;DAMAGE, INC.&quot; DUE TO MULTIPLE USE OF THE INFAMOUS &quot;F&quot; WORD. OTHERWISE, THERE AREN&#x27;T ANY &quot;SHITS,&quot; &quot;FUCKS,&quot; &quot;PISSES,&quot; &quot;CUNTS,&quot; &quot;MOTHERFUCKERS&quot; OR &quot;COCKSUCKERS&quot; ANYWHERE ON THIS RECORD.&quot; This also references George Carlin&#x27;s &quot;seven dirty words&quot; routine by mentioning six of them (all but &quot;tits&quot;).
* Flotsam and Jetsam&#x27;s song &quot;Hard on You&quot; (from their 1988 album &quot;No Place for Disgrace&quot;) is a direct reference to the PMRC, with several lines such as &quot;One that&#x27;s young sees the circled &#x27;R&#x27;, does he buy it?&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t you see, you&#x27;re ripping away our independence&quot; and &quot;If your committee is so damn right, why did we write this song?&quot;
* Todd Rundgren&#x27;s 1991 non-album song &quot;Jesse&quot; featured a verse directed toward Tipper Gore, including the lyrics: &quot;I wanna fuck you, Tipper, &#x27;cause you showed me that Things are still the same, Everybody&#x27;s parents turn out lame, I wanna say &quot;fuck you,&quot; Tipper Gore&quot; It was released only as a promotional cassette single, though Rundgren played it live for several years.
* The Megadeth song &quot;Hook In Mouth&quot; from their 1988 album &quot;So Far, So Good... So What!&quot; is aimed at the PMRC, which is explicitly mentioned in the chorus.
* Alice Donut&#x27;s 1988 debut album &quot;Donut Comes Alive&quot; ends with the song &quot;Tipper Gore,&quot; which pretends to lionize Gore for her crusade against obscene lyrics in music, but in reality is loaded with double entendres.
* The Aerosmith song &quot;F.I.N.E.&quot; from their 1989 album &quot;Pump&quot; mentions Tipper Gore in the line &quot;Even Tipper thinks I&#x27;m alright&quot;, the song being explicitly about sex. When accepting a Grammy Award for that album&#x27;s single Janie&#x27;s Got a Gun, Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler sarcastically thanked both Tipper Gore and Senator Jesse Helms (who was not a member of the PMRC but publicly supported the organization) for helping ensure &quot;that if an album has a few dirty words, it&#x27;ll sell another million copies.&quot;
* Ice-T&#x27;s 1989 album &quot;The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech... Just Watch What You Say!&quot; contains many criticisms of the PMRC. One song in particular, &quot;Freedom of Speech&quot;, is an extended attack on Tipper Gore:

&lt;poem&gt;
Yo, Tip, what&#x27;s the matter? You ain&#x27;t gettin&#x27; no dick?
You&#x27;re bitchin&#x27; about rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll—that&#x27;s censorship, dumb bitch
The Constitution says we all got a right to speak
Say what we want, Tip—your argument is weak
&lt;/poem&gt;

:In his book &quot;The Ice Opinion&quot;, Ice-T wrote &quot;Tipper Gore is the only woman I ever directly called a bitch on any of my records, and I meant that in the most negative sense of the word.&quot; On &quot;You Shoulda Killed Me Last Year&quot;, his spoken-word outro to his album &quot;O.G. Original Gangster&quot;, he curses the CIA, the LAPD, FBI, George H. W. Bush, and Tipper Gore.

* One of the bonus tracks on Warrant&#x27;s 1990 album &quot;Cherry Pie&quot;, titled &quot;Ode to Tipper Gore&quot;, is a montage of short audio clips from various live performances by the band, featuring ample use of expletives and obscene language.
* In 1990, Kid Rock released his debut album &quot;Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast&quot; with one song titled &quot;Pimp of the Nation&quot; where he states that &quot;Tipper Gore is my highest paid whore&quot; which is a diss regarding the PMRC.
* The liner notes of Sonic Youth&#x27;s 1990 album &quot;Goo&quot; include a cartoon with the caption &quot;SMASH THE PMRC.&quot;
* The cover art for the 1990 PDQ Bach album &quot;Oedipus Tex and Other Choral Calamities&quot; features a &quot;Pathetic Advisory: Inane Lyrics&quot; warning label.
* Cinderella referenced the PMRC in their song &quot;Shelter Me&quot; (from their &quot;Heartbreak Station&quot; album) with the lines &quot;Tipper led the war against the record industry, she said she saw the devil on her MTV&quot;.
* The 1990 Dead Milkmen song &quot;Do the Brown Nose&quot; includes the lyrics &quot;You, yes you, here&#x27;s a dime, run out and call the PMRC.&quot;
* In the 1992 video for &quot;Hush&quot;, Tool perform naked, except for placards over their genitals, designed to resemble the Explicit Lyric warning stickers (but replacing &quot;lyrics&quot; with &quot;parts&quot;).
* On July 18, 1993, Rage Against the Machine protested against the PMRC at Lollapalooza III by standing naked onstage with duct tape covering their mouths and the letters PMRC on their chests. The band used up their 14-minute performance time without playing any songs. The only sound emitted was audio feedback from Tom Morello and Tim Commerford&#x27;s guitars. The band later played a free show for disappointed fans.
* W.A.S.P live album &quot;Live... in the Raw&quot; includes the song &quot;Harder, Faster&quot;, which Blackie Lawless dedicates during the opening of the song to the PMRC.
* KMFDM&#x27;s irony-laden song &quot;Sucks&quot;, from their 1993 album &quot;Angst&quot;, contains the lyrics:

Our records have stickers with a warning from Tipper
&#x27;Cause they&#x27;re no good for kids; if we&#x27;d get her, we&#x27;d strip her

* New York-based thrash band Anthrax wrote and composed a song called &quot;Startin&#x27; Up a Posse&quot; for their 1991 release &quot;Attack of the Killer B&#x27;s&quot;. This song ridicules the members of the PMRC.
* Punk rock band Ramones recorded for their 1992 album &quot;Mondo Bizarro&quot; the song &quot;Censorshit&quot; about how rock and rap albums were being censored by the PMRC. It mentions Frank Zappa and Ozzy Osbourne, and is addressed to Tipper Gore.
* The third verse of Sir Mix-A-Lot&#x27;s 1994 single &quot;Put &#x27;Em on the Glass&quot; begins &quot;How many times will you play this/Before you ban this?/I heard Mrs. Gore can&#x27;t stand this&quot;.
* The 1997 Canadian punk band Reset&#x27;s album &quot;No Worries&quot; features a track titled &quot;Go Away&quot;, which is entirely about their disapproval of the PMRC and Tipper Gore, with one line directly naming Gore.
Tipper, won&#x27;t you understand the message that I want to say
It&#x27;s kind of rude but here it goes: it&#x27;s &quot;fuck you!&quot;
I don&#x27;t like what you do, and I don&#x27;t like you.

* On the 2001 Dead Kennedys live album &quot;Mutiny on the Bay&quot; (recorded in a 1986 concert), during their song &quot;M.T.V. – Get off the Air&quot;, lead singer Jello Biafra tells the audience to &quot;buy a homemade [record] instead, before the PMRC closes the stores down that sell &#x27;em.&quot; Biafra had earlier been brought to trial on charges of &quot;distributing harmful matter to minors&quot; in an incident involving the 1985 Dead Kennedys&#x27;s album &quot;Frankenchrist&quot;, which featured an insert of H. R. Giger&#x27;s &quot;Penis Landscape&quot; and a parody sticker on the front cover reading:
WARNING: The inside fold out to this record cover is a work of art by H.R. Giger that some people may find shocking, repulsive or offensive. Life can sometimes be that way.
* Rapper Eminem directly referenced Tipper Gore and indirectly referenced the PMRC in &quot;White America&quot;, the opening selection of his 2002 album &quot;The Eminem Show&quot;; in it, he referred to his mission as being
To burn the {flag} and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker/ To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy/ Fuck you, Ms. Cheney; Fuck you, Tipper Gore.

:Eminem also included Lynne Cheney, owing to her heavy criticism of his previous album and its explicit lyrical content, &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot;, at a United States Senate hearing.
* Suicidal Tendencies referenced Tipper Gore in their song &quot;Lovely&quot; from the album &quot;Lights...Camera...Revolution!&quot;: &quot;Tipper, babe, don&#x27;t you remember me/Now I&#x27;m kinder, gentler, and so happy&quot;.
* Harry and the Potters reference Tipper Gore and the PMRC in the title track of their album &quot;Voldemort Can&#x27;t Stop the Rock!&quot; with the line &quot;We won&#x27;t let the Dark Lord ruin our party just like Tipper Gore tried with the PMRC.&quot;
* Quiet Riot&#x27;s music video for their song The Wild and the Young showed rockers being rounded up and arrested by government soldiers while the members of Quiet Riot escape and perform the song underground, then in the final scene it says &quot;In Washington, Congress has just passed legislation that requires record companies to reproduce song lyrics on all album jackets...The government has also cited the rock and roll band, Quiet Riot, as one of the chief offenders in this ongoing controversy.&quot;

<text>Proletären (meaning &quot;the proletarian&quot;; in full &quot;Marxist-leninist Proletären&quot;) is a Swedish Marxist-Leninist weekly newspaper published by the Communist Party.

==History and profile==
&quot;Proletären&quot; was founded in 1970. About a third of the paper is sold in the streets.

Many notable Swedes, such as Jan Myrdal, Peter Birro, and Sven Wollter (who was a member of the Communist Party), have had their articles published in &quot;Proletären&quot;.

&quot;Proletären&quot; had a circulation of 3,200 copies in 2013.

<doc id="161684" wikidata="Q33648" url="?curid=161684" title="Language isolate">
<text>A language isolate is a language that has no demonstrable genetic relationship with any other languages. Basque in Europe, Ainu in Asia, Sandawe in Africa, Haida and Zuni in North America, Kanoê in South America, Tiwi in Australia and Burushaski in Pakistan are all examples of such languages. The exact number of language isolates is yet unknown due to insufficient data on several languages.

One explanation for the existence of language isolates is that they might be the last remaining member of a larger language family. Such languages might have had relatives in the past that have since disappeared without being documented, leaving them an orphaned language. One example is the Ket language spoken in central Siberia, which belongs to the wider Yeniseian language family; had it been discovered in recent times independently from its now extinct relatives, such as Yugh and Kott, it would have been classified as an isolate. Another explanation for language isolates is that they arose independently in isolation and thus do not share a common linguistic genesis with any other language but themselves. This explanation mostly applies to sign languages that have developed independently of other spoken or signed languages.

Some languages once seen as isolates may be reclassified as small families if some of their dialects are judged to be sufficiently different from the standard to be seen as different languages. Examples include Japanese and Georgian: Japanese is now part of the Japonic language family with the Ryukyuan languages, and Georgian is the main language in the Kartvelian language family. There is a difference between language isolates and unclassified languages, but they can be difficult to differentiate when it comes to classifying extinct languages. If such efforts eventually do prove fruitful, a language previously considered an isolate may no longer be considered one, as happened with the Yanyuwa language of northern Australia, which has been placed in the Pama–Nyungan family. Since linguists do not always agree on whether a genetic relationship has been demonstrated, it is often disputed whether a language is an isolate.

==Genetic relationships==

A genetic relationship is when two different languages are descended from a common ancestral language. This is what makes up a language family, which is a set of languages for which sufficient evidence exists to demonstrate that they descend from a single ancestral language and are therefore genetically related. For example, English is related to other Indo-European languages and Mandarin Chinese is related to other Sino-Tibetan languages. By this criterion, each language isolate constitutes a family of its own.

In some situations, a language with no ancestor can arise. This frequently happens with sign languages—most famously in the case of Nicaraguan Sign Language, where deaf children with no language were placed together and developed a new language.

==Extinct isolates==
Caution is required when speaking of extinct languages as language isolates. Despite their great age, Sumerian and Elamite can be safely classified as isolates, as the languages are well enough documented that, if modern relatives existed, they would be recognizably related. A language thought to be an isolate may turn out to be related to other languages once enough material is recovered, but this is unlikely for extinct languages whose written records have not been preserved.

Many extinct languages are very poorly attested, which may lead to them being considered unclassified languages instead of language isolates. This occurs when linguists do not have enough information on a language to classify it as either a language isolate or as a part of another language family.

== Isolates v. unclassified languages ==
Unclassified languages are different from language isolates in that they have no demonstrable genetic relationships to other languages due to a lack of sufficient data. In order to be considered a language isolate, a language needs to have sufficient data for comparisons with other languages through methods of historical-comparative linguistics to show that it does not have any genetic relationships.

Many extinct languages and living languages today are very poorly attested, and the fact that they cannot be linked to other languages may be a reflection of our poor knowledge of them. Hattic, Gutian, and Kassite are all considered unclassified languages, but their status is disputed by a minority of linguists. Many extinct languages of the Americas such as Cayuse and Majena may likewise have been isolates. Several unclassified languages could also be language isolates, but linguists cannot be sure of this without sufficient evidence.

==Sign language isolates==
A number of sign languages have arisen independently, without any ancestral language, and thus are language isolates. The most famous of these is the Nicaraguan Sign Language, a well documented case of what has happened in schools for the deaf in many countries. In Tanzania, for example, there are seven schools for the deaf, each with its own sign language with no known connection to any other language. Sign languages have also developed outside schools, in communities with high incidences of deafness, such as Kata Kolok in Bali, and half a dozen sign languages of the hill tribes in Thailand including the Ban Khor Sign Language.

These and more are all presumed isolates or small local families, because many deaf communities are made up of people whose hearing parents do not use sign language, and have manifestly, as shown by the language itself, not borrowed their sign language from other deaf communities during the recorded history of these languages.

== Reclassification ==
Some languages once seen as isolates may be reclassified as small families because their genetic relationship to other languages has been established. This happened with Japanese and Ryukyuan languages, Korean and Koreanic languages, Atakapa and Akokisa languages, Tol and Jicaque of El Palmar languages, and the Xincan Guatemala language family in which linguists have grouped the Chiquimulilla, Guazacapán, Jumaytepeque, and Yupiltepeque languages.

==List of language isolates by continent==
Below is a list of known language isolates, arranged by continent, along with notes on possible relations to other languages or language families.

The status column indicates the degree of endangerment of the language, according to the definitions of the UNESCO &quot;Atlas of the World&#x27;s Languages in Danger&quot;. &quot;Vibrant&quot; languages are those in full use by speakers of every generation, with consistent native acquisition by children. &quot;Vulnerable&quot; languages have a similarly wide base of native speakers, but a restricted use and the long-term risk of language shift. &quot;Endangered&quot; languages are either acquired irregularly or spoken only by older generations. &quot;Moribund&quot; languages have only a few remaining native speakers, with no new acquisition, highly restricted use, and near-universal multilingualism. &quot;Extinct&quot; languages have no native speakers, but are sufficiently documented to be classified as isolates.
===Africa===
With few exceptions, all of Africa&#x27;s languages have been gathered into four major phyla: Afroasiatic, Niger–Congo, Nilo-Saharan and Khoisan. However, the genetic unity of some language families, like Nilo-Saharan, is questionable, and so there may be many more language families and isolates than currently accepted. Data for several African languages, like Kwisi, are not sufficient for classification. In addition, Jalaa, Shabo, Laal, Kujargé, and a few other languages within Nilo-Saharan and Afroasiatic-speaking areas may turn out to be isolates upon further investigation. Defaka and Ega are highly divergent languages located within Niger–Congo-speaking areas, and may also possibly be language isolates.
===Asia===
===Oceania===
Current research considers that the &quot;Papuasphere&quot; centered in New Guinea includes as many as 37 isolates. (The more is known about these languages in the future, the more likely it is for these languages to be later assigned to a known language family.) To these, one must add several isolates found among non-Pama-Nyungan languages of Australia:

<doc id="161685" wikidata="Q315006" url="?curid=161685" title="Alexander II Zabinas">
<text>Alexander II Theos Epiphanes Nikephoros ( &quot;Aléxandros Theòs Epiphanḕs Nikēphóros&quot;, surnamed Zabinas; 150 BC – 123 BC) was a Hellenistic Seleucid monarch who reigned as the King of Syria between 128 BC and 123 BC. His true parentage is debated; depending on which ancient historian, he either claimed to be a son of Alexander I or an adopted son of Antiochus VII. Most ancient historians and the modern academic consensus maintain that Alexander II&#x27;s claim to be a Seleucid was false. His surname &quot;Zabinas&quot; (Ζαβίνας) is a Semitic name that is usually translated as &quot;the bought one&quot;. It is possible, however, that Alexander II was a natural son of Alexander I, as the surname can also mean &quot;bought from the god&quot;. The iconography of Alexander II&#x27;s coinage indicates he based his claims to the throne on his descent from Antiochus IV, the father of Alexander I.

Alexander II&#x27;s rise is connected to the dynastic feuds of the Seleucid Empire. Both King Seleucus IV (d. 175 BC) and his brother Antiochus IV (d. 164 BC) had descendants contending for the throne, leading the country to experience many civil wars. The situation was complicated by Ptolemaic Egyptian interference, which was facilitated by the dynastic marriages between the two royal houses. In 128 BC, King Demetrius II of Syria, the representative of Seleucus IV&#x27;s line, invaded Egypt to help his mother-in-law Cleopatra II who was engaged in a civil war against her brother and husband King Ptolemy VIII. Angered by the Syrian invasion, the Egyptian king instigated revolts in the cities of Syria against Demetrius II and chose Alexander II, a supposed representative of Antiochus IV&#x27;s line, as an anti-king. With Egyptian troops, Alexander II captured the Syrian capital Antioch in 128 BC and warred against Demetrius II, defeating him decisively in 125 BC. The beaten king escaped to his wife Cleopatra Thea in the city of Ptolemais, but she expelled him. He was killed while trying to find refuge in the city of Tyre.

With the death of Demetrius II, Alexander II became the master of the kingdom, controlling the realm except for a small pocket around Ptolemais where Cleopatra Thea ruled. Alexander II was a beloved king, known for his kindness and forgiving nature. He maintained friendly relations with John I Hyrcanus of Judea, who acknowledged the Syrian king as his suzerain. Alexander II&#x27;s successes were not welcomed by Egypt&#x27;s Ptolemy VIII, who did not want a strong king on the Syrian throne. Thus, in 124 BC an alliance was established between Egypt and Cleopatra Thea, now ruling jointly with Antiochus VIII, her son by Demetrius II. Alexander II was defeated, and he escaped to Antioch, where he pillaged the temple of Zeus to pay his soldiers; the population turned against him, and he fled and was eventually captured. Alexander II was probably executed by Antiochus VIII in 123 BC, ending the line of Antiochus IV.

==Background==


The death of the Seleucid king Seleucus IV in 175 BC created a dynastic crisis because of the illegal succession of his brother Antiochus IV. Seleucus IV&#x27;s legitimate heir, Demetrius I, was a hostage in Rome, and his younger son Antiochus was declared king. Shortly after the succession of young Antiochus, however, Antiochus IV assumed the throne as a co-ruler. He may have had his nephew killed in 170/169 BC (145 SE (Seleucid year)). After Antiochus IV&#x27;s death in 164 BC, his son Antiochus V succeeded him. Three years later Demetrius I managed to escape Rome and take the throne, killing Antiochus V in 161 BC. The Seleucid dynasty was torn apart by the civil war between the lines of Seleucus IV and Antiochus IV.

In 150 BC Alexander I, an illegitimate son of Antiochus IV, managed to dethrone and kill Demetrius I. He married Cleopatra Thea, the daughter of Ptolemy VI of Ptolemaic Egypt, who became his ally and supporter. The Egyptian king changed his policy and supported Demetrius I&#x27;s son Demetrius II, marrying him to Cleopatra Thea after divorcing her from Alexander I, who was defeated by his former father in law and eventually killed in 145 BC. The Egyptian king was wounded during the battle and died shortly after Alexander I. His sister-wife and co-ruler, the mother of Cleopatra Thea, Cleopatra II, then married her other brother, Ptolemy VIII who became her new co-ruler.

Diodotus Tryphon, Alexander I&#x27;s official, declared the latter&#x27;s son Antiochus VI king in 144 BC. Tryphon then had him killed and assumed the throne himself in 142 BC. The usurper controlled lands in the western parts of the Seleucid empire, including Antioch, but Demetrius II retained large parts of the realm, including Babylonia, which was invaded by the Parthian Empire in 141 BC. This led Demetrius II to launch a campaign against Parthia which ended in his defeat and capture in 138 BC. His younger brother Antiochus VII took the throne and married Demetrius II&#x27;s wife. He was able to defeat Tryphon and the Parthians, restoring the lost Seleucid provinces.

In Egypt, without divorcing Cleopatra II, Ptolemy VIII married her daughter by Ptolemy VI, Cleopatra III, and declared her co-ruler. Cleopatra II revolted and took control over the countryside. By September 131 BC, Ptolemy VIII lost recognition in the capital Alexandria and fled to Cyprus. The Parthians freed Demetrius II to put pressure on Antiochus VII, who was killed in 129 BC during a battle in Media. This opened the way for Demetrius II to regain his throne and wife Cleopatra Thea the same year. Ptolemy VIII returned to Egypt two years after his expulsion; he warred against his sister Cleopatra II, eventually besieging her in Alexandria; she then asked her son-in-law Demetrius II for help, offering him the throne of Egypt. The Syrian king marched against Egypt and by spring 128 BC, he reached Pelusium.

In response to Demetrius II&#x27;s campaign, Ptolemy VIII incited a rebellion in Syria. The Syrian capital Antioch proclaimed a young son of Antiochus VII named Antiochus Epiphanes king, but the city was willing to change hands in such unstable political circumstances. Ptolemy VIII sent Alexander II as an anti-king for Syria, forcing Demetrius II to withdraw from Egypt. According to the third century historian Porphyry, in his history preserved in the work of his contemporary Eusebius, and also to the third century historian Justin, in his epitome of the &quot;Philippic Histories&quot;, a work written by the first century BC historian Trogus, Alexander II was a protégé of Ptolemy VIII. The first century historian Josephus wrote the Syrians themselves asked Ptolemy VIII to send them a Seleucid prince as their king, and he chose Alexander II. According to the &quot;Prologues of the Philippic Histories&quot;, the Egyptian king bribed Alexander II to oppose Demetrius II.

==Parentage and name==

Alexander II was probably born in c. 150 BC. His name is Greek, meaning &quot;protector of men&quot;. According to Justin, Alexander II was the son of an Egyptian trader named Protarchus. Justin also added that &quot;Alexander&quot; was a regnal name bestowed upon the king by the Syrians. Justin further stated that Alexander II produced a fabricated story claiming he was an adopted son of Antiochus VII. Porphyry presented a different account in which Alexander II was claimed to be the son of Alexander I.

Modern historic research prefers the detailed account of Justin regarding Alexander II&#x27;s claims of paternity and his connection to Antiochus VII. However, a 125 BC series of gold staters minted by Alexander II had his epithets, the same ones used by King Antiochus IV, father of Alexander I, and arranged in the same order they had on Antiochus IV&#x27;s coins. Zeus carrying a Nike is depicted on the reverse of the stater; the Nike is carrying a wreath which crowns the epithet &quot;Epiphanes&quot;, an element featured in Antiochus IV&#x27;s coinage. Many themes of Antiochus IV&#x27;s line appeared on Alexander II&#x27;s coinage, such as the god Dionysus which was used by Alexander I in 150 BC, in addition to the lion scalp, another theme in Alexander I&#x27;s coinage. Furthermore, Alexander II was depicted wearing the radiate crown; six rays protrude from the head and are not attached to the diadem, which is a theme that characterized all portraits of Antiochus VI when depicted wearing the radiate crown. Based on those arguments, the account of Porphyry regarding Alexander II&#x27;s claim of descent from Alexander I should be preferred to the account of Justin.

===Surname and legitimacy===
Popular surnames of Seleucid kings are never found on coins, but are handed down only through ancient literature. The surname of Alexander II has different spellings; it is &quot;Zabinaeus&quot; in the prologue of the Latin language &quot;Philippic Histories&quot;, book XXXIX. &quot;Zebinas&quot; was used by Josephus. The Greek rendition, Zabinas, was used by many historians such as Diodorus Siculus and Porphyry. Zabinas is a Semitic proper name, derived from the Aramaic verb &quot;זבן&quot; (pronounced Zabn), which means &quot;buy&quot; or &quot;gain&quot;. The meaning of Zabinas as a surname of Alexander II is &quot;a slave sold in the market&quot; according to philologist Pierre Jouguet. This is based on a statement by Porphyry. He wrote that Alexander II was named Zabinas by the Syrians because he was a &quot;bought slave&quot;. In the view of archaeologist Jean-Antoine Letronne, who agreed that Alexander II was an imposter, a coin meant for the public could not have had &quot;Zabinas&quot; inscribed on it as it is derisory. On the other hand, historian Philip Khuri Hitti noted that &quot;Zebina&quot;, another rendering of Zabinas, occurs in Ezra (10:43), indicating it originally meant &quot;bought from god&quot;. The numismatist Nicholas L. Wright also considered that Zabinas meant &quot;purchased from the god&quot;.

Though academic consensus considers Alexander II an imposter of non-Seleucid birth, Josephus accepted the king as a Seleucid dynast but did not specify his connection to earlier kings. Historian ascribed Josephus&#x27;s acceptance to Alexander II&#x27;s successful propaganda. Wright, however, contends that Alexander II should be considered a legitimate Seleucid and a descendant of Antiochus IV using the following arguments:
* Porphyry&#x27;s account of the adoption by Antiochus VII might be based on facts. Justin called Antiochus VI a step-son of Demetrius II. In Wright&#x27;s view, this association between Antiochus VI and his father&#x27;s enemy might be an indication that Demetrius II adopted Antiochus VI in an attempt to close the rift in the royal family. Likewise, it is possible Alexander II was indeed a son of Alexander I adopted by Antiochus VII. The second century historian Arrian spoke of an Alexander, the son of Alexander I, who was elevated to kingship by Tryphon in 145 BC; this passage is puzzling as it is numismatically proven that it was Antiochus VI whom Tryphon raised to the throne. According to Wright, the language of Arrian indicates he probably had access to sources mentioning Alexander II as a son of Alexander I.
* Justin&#x27;s account regarding Protarchos, the alleged Egyptian father of Alexander II, is illogical. Wright suggested Alexander II was an illegitimate son of Alexander I; it is probable Alexander II might have been a younger son of Alexander I destined to become a priest, hence he was called Zabinas—purchased from the god. It is dubious Alexander II was a low-born Egyptian man, whose claims to the throne were based on publicly known falsifications, yet he was accepted by the Syrians as their king. The story about Alexander II&#x27;s Egyptian origin was probably invented by the court of Demetrius II, maintained by the court of his son Antiochus VIII, and kept alive by ancient historians due to its scandalous nature.

==King of Syria==
===Ascending the throne===
The young Antiochus Epiphanes likely died of an illness. Alexander II, whose earliest coins from the capital are dated to 184 SE (129/128 BC), probably landed in northern Syria with Ptolemaic support and declared himself king, taking Antioch in the process; the fall of the capital probably took place in spring 128 BC. According to Justin&#x27;s epitome, the Syrians were ready to accept any king other than Demetrius II. Probably soon after capturing Antioch, Alexander II incorporated Laodicea ad mare and Tarsus into his domains. Other cities, such as Apamea, had already freed themselves from Demetrius II during his Egyptian campaign and did not come immediately under Alexander II&#x27;s authority.

===Epithets and royal image===
Hellenistic kings did not use regnal numbers, which is a modern practice; instead, they used epithets to distinguish themselves from similarly named monarchs. The majority of Alexander II&#x27;s coins did not feature an epithet, but the 125 BC series of gold staters bore the epithets &quot;Theos&quot; &quot;Epiphanes&quot; (god manifest) and &quot;Nikephoros&quot; (bearer of victory). Three bronze issues, one of them minted in Seleucia Pieria, are missing the epithet &quot;Theos&quot; but retain &quot;Epiphanes&quot; and &quot;Nikephoros&quot;. Those epithets, an echo of those of Antiochus IV&#x27;s, served to emphasise the legitimacy of Alexander II as a Seleucid king.

Alexander the Great (d. 323 BC), founder of the Macedonian Empire, was an important figure in the Hellenistic world; his successors used his legacy to establish their legitimacy. Alexander the Great never had his image minted on his own coins, but his successors, such as the Ptolemaics, sought to associate themselves with him; cities were named after him, and his image appeared on coins. In contrast, the memory of Alexander the Great was not important for Seleucid royal ideology. However, Alexander I and Alexander II, both having Egyptian support, were the only Seleucid kings who paid particular attention to Alexander the Great by depicting themselves wearing the lion scalp, a motif closely connected to the Macedonian king. By associating himself with Alexander the Great, Alexander II was continuing the practice of Alexander I, who used the theme of Alexander the Great to strengthen his legitimacy.

The native Syro-Phoenician religious complex was based on triads that included a supreme god, a supreme goddess, and their son; the deities taking those roles were diverse. It is possible that by 145 BC Dionysus took the role of the son. The Levant was a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural region, but the religious complex was a unifying force. The Seleucid monarchs understood the possibility of using this complex to expand their support base amongst the locals by integrating themselves into the triads. Usage of the radiate crown, a sign of divinity, by the Seleucid kings, probably carried a message: that the king was the consort of Atargatis, Syria&#x27;s supreme goddess. The radiate crown was utilised for the first time at an unknown date by Antiochus IV, who chose Hierapolis-Bambyce, the most important sanctuary of Atargatis, to ritually marry Diana, considered a manifestation of the Syrian goddess in the Levant. Alexander I&#x27;s nickname, Balas, was probably used by the king himself. It is the Greek rendering of Ba&#x27;al, the Levant&#x27;s supreme god. By using such an epithet, Alexander I was declaring himself the embodiment of Ba&#x27;al. Alexander I also used the radiate crown to indicate his ritual marriage to the supreme goddess. Alexander II made heavy use of the motifs of Dionysus in his coins. It is possible that, by utilising Dionysus, the son of the supreme god, Alexander II presented himself as the spiritual successor of his god-father, in addition to being his political heir.

===Policy===
One of Alexander II&#x27;s first acts was the burial of Antiochus VII&#x27;s remains which were returned by the Parthians. Burying the fallen king earned Alexander II the acclaim of Antioch&#x27;s citizens; it was probably a calculated move aiming at gaining the support of Antiochus VII&#x27;s loyal men. The seventh century chronicler John of Antioch wrote that following Antiochus VII&#x27;s death, his son Seleucus ascended the throne and was quickly deposed by Demetrius II and fled to Parthia. Historian Auguste Bouché-Leclercq criticised this account, which is problematic and could be a version of Demetrius II&#x27;s Parthian captivity corrupted by John of Antioch. However, it is possible that a son of Antiochus VII named Seleucus was captured by the Parthians along with his father and was later sent with Antiochus VII&#x27;s remains to take the throne of Syria as a Parthian protégé. If this scenario happened, then Seleucus was faced by Alexander II and had to return to Parthia.
Since he ascended the throne with Egyptian help, Alexander II was under Ptolemaic influence, which was manifested in the appearance of the Egyptian style double filleted cornucopiae on the Syrian coinage. In Egypt, the double cornucopiae on coins might have been a reference to the union between the king and his consort. If the appearance of cornucopiae on Alexander II&#x27;s coinage was connected to Ptolemaic practices, then it can be understood that Alexander II might have married a Ptolemaic princess, though such a marriage is not recorded by ancient literature.

According to Diodorus Siculus, Alexander II was &quot;kindly and of a forgiving nature, and moreover was gentle in speech and in manners, wherefore he was deeply beloved by the common people&quot;. Diodorus Siculus wrote that three of Alexander II&#x27;s officers, Antipater, Klonios, and Aeropos, rebelled and entrenched themselves in Laodicea. Alexander II defeated the rebels and recaptured the city; he pardoned the culprits. Bouché-Leclercq suggested that this rebellion took place in 128 BC and that the officers either defected to Demetrius II&#x27;s side, were working for the son of Antiochus VII, or were instigated in their rebellion by Cleopatra Thea.

===War against Demetrius II===
Between August 127 BC and August 126 BC, Ptolemy VIII regained Alexandria; Cleopatra II fled to Demetrius II with the treasury of Egypt. Despite Alexander II&#x27;s success in taking the capital, Demetrius II retained Cilicia, and Seleucia Pieria remained loyal to him, so did many cities in Coele-Syria; this led Alexander II to launch a campaign in the region. The armies of the two kings passed through Judea causing a plight for the inhabitants. This led the Jews to send an embassy to Rome demanding &quot;the prohibition of the marching of royal soldiers through the Jewish territory &#x27;and that of their subjects″&quot;; the embassy was between c. 127–125 BC. By October 126 BC, Ashkelon fell into Alexander II&#x27;s hands. Numismatic evidence indicates that Samaria came under Alexander II&#x27;s control. In the beginning of 125 BC, Demetrius II was defeated near Damascus and fled to Ptolemais. Cleopatra Thea refused to allow her husband to stay in the city, so he headed to Tyre on board a ship. Demetrius II asked for temple asylum in Tyre, but was killed by the city&#x27;s commander (&quot;praefectus&quot;) in the spring or summer of 125 BC.

Alexander II minted bronze coins depicting him with an elephant scalp headdress on the obverse, and an aphlaston appears on the reverse; this can mean that Alexander II claimed a naval victory. The sea battle between Alexander II and Demetrius II, which is not documented in ancient literature, may have occurred only during the voyage of Demetrius II from Ptolemais to Tyre. The elephant scalp headdress was a theme in Alexander the Great&#x27;s posthumous coinage minted by his successors. According to Ehling, by appearing with the elephant scalp, Alexander II alluded to Alexander the Great&#x27;s conquest of Tyre which took place in 332 BC after seven months of siege. The 125 BC gold staters containing Alexander II&#x27;s epithets were probably struck to celebrate his victory over Demetrius II.

===Relations with Judea===
Under Antiochus VII, the Judean high-priest and ruler John Hyrcanus I acquired the status of a vassal prince, paying tribute and minting his coinage in the name of the Syrian monarch. Following Antiochus VII&#x27;s death, John Hyrcanus I ceased paying the tribute and minted coinage bearing his own name, but ties were kept with the Seleucid kingdom through monograms, representing Seleucid kings, that appeared on the early coins. The dating of this event is conjectural, with the earliest date possible 129 BC but more likely 128 BC. Demetrius II apparently planned an invasion of Judea, which was halted due to the king&#x27;s failed invasion of Egypt and the uprising that erupted in Syria. According to Josephus, John Hyrcanus I &quot;flourished greatly&quot; under Alexander II&#x27;s rule; apparently, the Judean leader sought an alliance with Alexander II to defend himself against Demetrius II.

The 127 BC embassy sent by Judea to Rome asked the senate to force the Syrian abandonment of: Jaffa, the Mediterranean harbours which included Iamnia and Gaza, the cities of Gazara and Pegae (near Kfar Saba), in addition to other territories taken by King Antiochus VII. A Roman &quot;senatus consultum&quot; (senatorial decree), preserved in Josephus&#x27;s work &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; (book XIV, 250), granted the Jews their request regarding the cities, but did not mention the city of Gazara. The senatorial decree mentions the reigning Syrian king as Antiochus son of Antiochus, which can mean only Antiochus IX, who assumed the throne in 199 SE (114/113 BC). The decree might indicate the Syrians had already abandoned Gazara in c. 187 SE (126/125 BC). This supports the notion that an agreement between Alexander II and John Hyrcanus I was signed early in the Syrian king&#x27;s reign. Such a treaty would have established the alliance between Alexander II and Judea, and stipulated a territorial agreement where John Hyrcanus I received the lands south of Gazara including that city, while Alexander II maintained control over the region north of Gazara including Samaria.

John Hyrcanus I recognised Alexander II as his sovereign. The earliest series of coins minted by the high priest showed the Greek letter Α (alpha) positioned prominently above John Hyrcanus I&#x27;s name. The alpha must have been the first letter of a Seleucid king&#x27;s name, and many scholars, such as Dan Barag, suggested that it represents Alexander II. Another clue indicating the relationship between Alexander II and John Hyrcanus I is the latter&#x27;s use of the double cornucopiae motif on his coins; a pomegranate motif appeared in the centre of the cornucopiae to highlight the authority of the Jewish leader. This imagery was apparently a cautious policy by John Hyrcanus I. In case Alexander II was defeated, the Judean coins motifs were neutral enough to appease an eventual successor, while if Alexander II emerged victorious and decided to interfere in Judea, the cornucopiae coins could be used to show the king that John Hyrcanus I already accepted Alexander II&#x27;s suzerainty. The high priest eventually won the independence of Judea later in Alexander II&#x27;s reign; once John Hyrcanus I severed his ties with the Seleucids, the alpha was removed.

===Height of power and the break with Egypt===
Following Demetrius II&#x27;s death, Alexander II, commanding a force of forty thousand soldiers, brought Seleucia Pieria under his control. Cilicia was also conquered in 125 BC along with other regions. The coinage of Alexander II was minted in: Antioch, Seleucia Pieria, Apamea, Damascus, Beirut, Ashkelon and Tarsus, in addition to unknown minting centers in northern Syria, southern Coele-Syria and Cilicia (coded by numismatists: uncertain mint 111, 112, 113, 114). In Ptolemais, Cleopatra Thea refused to recognise Alexander II as king; already in 187 SE (126/125 BC), the year of her husband&#x27;s defeat, she struck tetradrachms in her own name as the sole monarch of Syria. Her son with Demetrius II, Seleucus V, declared himself king, but she had him assassinated. The people of Syria did not accept a woman as the sole monarch. This led Cleopatra Thea to choose her younger son by Demetrius II, Antiochus VIII, as a co-ruler in 186 SE (125/124 BC).

According to Justin, Ptolemy VIII abandoned Alexander II after the death of Demetrius II and reconciled with Cleopatra II who went back to Egypt as a co-ruler. Justin stated that Ptolemy VIII&#x27;s reason for abandoning Alexander II was the latter&#x27;s increased arrogance swelled by his successes that led him to treat his benefactor with insolence. The change of Ptolemaic policy probably had less to do with Ptolemy VIII&#x27;s pride than with Alexander II&#x27;s victories; a strong neighbour in Syria was not a desired situation for Egypt. It is also probable that Cleopatra Thea negotiated an alliance with her uncle. Soon after Cleopatra II&#x27;s return, Ptolemy VIII&#x27;s daughter by Cleopatra III, Tryphaena, was married to Antiochus VIII. An Egyptian army was sent to support the faction of Antiochus VIII against AlexanderII. The return of Cleopatra II and the marriage of Antiochus VIII both took place in 124 BC.

===War with Antiochus VIII, defeat and death===

Supported by the Egyptian troops, Antiochus VIII waged war against Alexander II, who lost most of his lands. He lost Ashkelon in 189 SE (124/123 BC). The final battle took place at an unknown location in the first half of 123 BC, ending with Alexander II&#x27;s defeat. Different ancient historians presented varying accounts of Alexander II&#x27;s end. Josephus merely stated that the king was defeated and killed, while Eusebius mentioned that Alexander II committed suicide with poison because he could not live with his defeat. Most details are found in the accounts of Diodorus Siculus and Justin:
* In the account of Diodorus Siculus, Alexander II decided to avoid the battle with Antiochus VIII since he had no confidence in his subjects&#x27; aspirations for political change or their tolerance for the hardships that warfare would bring. Instead of fighting, Alexander II decided to take the royal treasuries, steal the valuables of the temples, and sail to Greece at night. While pillaging the temple of Zeus with some of his foreign subordinates, he was discovered by the populace and barely escaped with his life. Accompanied by a few men he went to Seleucia Pieria, but the news of his sacrilege arrived before him. The city closed its gates, forcing him to seek shelter in Posidium. Two days after pillaging the temple, Alexander II was caught and brought in chains to Antiochus VIII in his camp, suffering the insults and humiliation at the hands of his enemies. People who witnessed the indignation of Alexander II were shocked at the scene they thought could never happen. After accepting what had occurred in front of them was reality, they looked away with astonishment.
* In the account of Justin, Alexander II fled to Antioch following his defeat at the hands of Antiochus VIII. Lacking the resources to pay his troops, the king ordered the removal of a golden Nike from the temple of Jupiter (Zeus), joking that &quot;victory was lent to him by Jupiter&quot;. A few days later, Alexander II himself ordered the golden statue of Jupiter to be taken out under the cover of night. The city&#x27;s populace revolted against the king, and he was forced to flee. He was later deserted by his men and caught by bandits; they delivered him to Antiochus VIII, who ordered him executed.

Alexander II issued two series of gold staters. One bears his epithets and dates to 125 BC according to many numismatists, such as Oliver Hoover and Arthur Houghton, and another bearing only the title of king (&quot;basileus&quot;). Earlier numismatists, such as Edward Theodore Newell and Ernest Babelon, who only knew about the 125 BC stater, suggested that it was minted with the gold pillaged from the temple. However, the iconography of that stater does not match that used for Alexander II&#x27;s late coinage, as the diadem ties fall in a straight fashion on the neck. On the other hand, the arrangement of the diadem ties on the stater that lacks the royal epithets is more consistent with Alexander II&#x27;s late tetradrachm, making it more reasonable to associate that stater with the Nike theft.

Though his last coins were issued in 190 SE (123/122 BC), ancient historians do not provide the explicit date of Alexander II&#x27;s death. He probably died by October 123 BC since the first Antiochene coins of Antiochus VIII were issued in 190 SE (123/122 BC). Damascus kept striking coinage in the name of Alexander II until 191 SE (122/121 BC), when the forces of Antiochus VIII took it. According to Diodorus Siculus, many who witnessed the king&#x27;s end &quot;remarked in various ways on the fickleness of fate, the reversals in human fortunes, the sudden turns of tide, and how changeable life could be, far beyond what anyone would expect&quot;. No wife or children of Alexander II, if he had any, are known; with his death, the line of Antiochus IV became extinct.

<text>Hisingen () is the fifth-largest island of Sweden (after Gotland, Öland, Södertörn and Orust), with an area of . It is a river island, formed by the split of the Göta Älv at Bohus, and is defined to the east and south by the main arm of that river, to the north by the smaller arm (known as the Nordre Älv), and to the west by the Kattegat. The southern part of Hisingen is extensively urbanised, representing the northern suburbs of the city of Gothenburg. The island is divided between the historical provinces of Västergötland and Bohuslän, but lies entirely within the modern county of Västra Götaland.

According to the 2023 census, the island of Hisingen in Sweden has a population of 176,047, making it the second most populous island in Sweden, after Södermalm but before Gotland.

For a brief, post-war period Hisingen was home to the largest shipbuilding centre in the world, but all three yards closed in 1979. Hisingen is home to both the Volvo Group and the now separate Volvo Cars. Most of the Nordic countries&#x27; largest port, the Port of Gothenburg is also located on Hisingen.

==Etymology==
The etymology of the name &quot;Hisingen&quot; is disputed. &quot;Hísing&quot; makes its first appearance in 13th century Icelandic sources; &quot;Hisingen&quot; is dated back to 1399.

The basic meaning of the prefix &quot;His&quot;- is &quot;to split, cut off&quot; and can be found in the placenames &quot;Hisøy&quot; and &quot;Hisön&quot;. Hence, the name can be interpreted as &quot;the island cut off from the mainland&quot;.

==History==
The Tumlehed rock painting and remains of ancient settlements prove that Hisingen was inhabited by the year 9000 BC.

During the Middle Ages, the Göta Älv represented the frontier between the Kingdom of Norway and the Kingdom of Sweden, with the river island of Hisingen being divided between the two realms. The division was not equal, with only the southern quarter of the island (comprising Lundy and Tuve parishes) belonging to Sweden while the remainder (Rödbo, Säfve, Backa, Björlanda and Torslanda parishes) was Norwegian.

It was on Hisingen that the first town with the name Gothenburg existed. It was founded by king Charles IX in 1607 on the southern shore of Hisingen, at Färjenäs. It was inhabited mostly by Dutch merchants, enticed to settle there by favourable economic conditions. However, the town was completely destroyed by the Danes in 1611, during the Kalmar War.

Under the 1658 Treaty of Roskilde, the Norwegian province of Bohuslän was ceded to Sweden, thereby uniting Hisingen under Swedish control, although the old border was preserved in the division between the districts of (the formerly Norwegian area) and .

The island was mostly farmland until the 19th century, when industrialization began and companies like Arendalsvarvet, Eriksberg, Götaverken and Lindholmen started operating there. For most of the 20th century, until the shipyard crisis in the 1970s, the island was the focus for Swedish shipbuilding.

The Volvo car manufacturer has its roots on Hisingen; it was there that their first factory was located and the first car, the Volvo ÖV 4, was produced in 1927. Today, the company still has its main office and production facilities on the island. The Volvo Museum is also located nearby.

Over the last 20 years, the northern bank of Göta älv has undergone major expansion. Residential areas, university buildings and high tech industry have largely replaced the shipyards.

==Geography==

The island has a diverse landscape with coasts, farms and forests. The biggest forest area is Hisingsparken, which is also the largest park in Gothenburg. Rya skog, a smaller forest and a nature reserve, is located in the south of Hisingen.

Ramberget, an 87 m hill, is a well-known landmark. It is part of Keiller&#x27;s Park, which was established in 1908 and covers an area of over 31 hectares. From the top of the hill, which can be reached by car, there is a wide view of the whole city.

==Administration==
All of the island belongs to Gothenburg Municipality. It is divided up into three boroughs:
* Norra Hisingen (Northern Hisingen)
* Västra Hisingen (Western Hisingen)
* Lundby

The island is linked to the mainland by several bridges, including the Hisingen Bridge, the Älvsborg Bridge, and the Tingstadstunneln motorway tunnel (a second motorway tunnel is also planned). A number of bus routes, as well as tram lines 5, 6 10 and 13, connect the island to central Gothenburg.

Gothenburg City Airport (Gothenburg&#x27;s second international airport after Landvetter) is located at Säve in the northern part of Hisingen.

==Ranking in the list of Sweden&#x27;s largest islands==
In 2014 Statistics Sweden declared it to instead be the fifth largest island, under a definition which adds artificial canals to the possible bodies of water surrounding an island. It has been noted that under this definition, all of Götaland would be the country&#x27;s largest island, rendering Hisingen instead the sixth largest.

<doc id="161692" wikidata="Q216286" url="?curid=161692" title="Burushaski">
<text>Burushaski (; , ) is a language isolate, spoken by the Burusho people, who predominantly reside in northern Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan. There are also a few hundred speakers of this language in northern Jammu and Kashmir, India.

In Pakistan, Burushaski is spoken by the people of the Hunza District, the Nagar District, the northern Gilgit District, the Yasin Valley in the Gupis-Yasin District, and the Ishkoman Valley of the northern Ghizer District. Their native region is northern Gilgit–Baltistan. It also borders the Pamir corridor to the north. In India, Burushaski is spoken in Botraj Mohalla of the Hari Parbat region in Srinagar. It is generally believed that the language was spoken in a much wider area in the past. It is also known as &quot;Werchikwar&quot; and &quot;Miśa:ski&quot;.

== Classification ==
Attempts have been made to establish links between Burushaski and several different language families, although none has been accepted by a majority of linguists.

Some hypotheses posit a genealogical relationship between Burushaski and the North Caucasian languages, Kartvelian languages, Yeniseian languages and/or Indo-European languages, usually in proposed macrofamilies:
* The proposed but contended &quot;Dené–Caucasian&quot; macrofamily includes Burushaski alongside Basque, North Caucasian, Yeniseian, Sino-Tibetan and Na-Dene.
* Another proposed family, known as &quot;Karasuk&quot;, links Burushaski with Yeniseian.
* A relationship to the proposed &quot;Indo-Hittite clade&quot; of the Indo-European family and ancient Phrygian has been suggested by Eric P. Hamp and . The various proposals linking Burushaski to Indo-European make divergent—or in the case of Čašule even contradictory—claims about the nature of the relationship, and are rejected by mainstream scholarship.
* A possible connection specifically to the North Caucasian languages.

== Language contact ==
Blench (2008) notes that the supposed evidence for external relationships of Burushaski rely on lexical data which may be better explained as originating from language contact. In particular, almost all Burushaski agricultural vocabulary appears to be borrowed from Dardic, Tibeto-Burman, and North Caucasian languages.

Following Berger (1956), the &quot;American Heritage&quot; dictionaries suggested that the word &quot;*abel&quot; &#x27;apple&#x27;, the only name for a fruit (tree) reconstructed for Proto-Indo-European, may have been borrowed from a language ancestral to Burushaski. (&quot;Apple&quot; and &quot;apple tree&quot; are &quot;báalt&quot; in modern Burushaski.)

Kashmiri linguist Sadaf Munshi stated that Burushaski may have developed alongside the Dravidian languages before the Indo-Aryan migration to South Asia, mentioning the fact that both possess retroflex sounds.

== Varieties ==
Burushaski is spoken by about 120,000 speakers in Pakistan, and also by a few hundred in India. In Pakistan, it is spoken in three main valleys: Yasin, Hunza, and Nagar. The varieties of Hunza and Nagar diverge slightly, but are clearly dialects of a single language. The Yasin variety, also known by the Khowar exonym &quot;Werchikwar&quot;, is much more divergent. Intelligibility between Yasin and Hunza-Nagar is difficult, and Yasin is sometimes considered a distinct language and thought to be the &quot;pure&quot; or &quot;original&quot; Burushaski by the speakers of Yasin valley itself. Yasin is the least affected by contact with neighboring languages, though speakers are bilingual in Khowar. Yasin is spoken by a quarter of Burushaski speakers.

In India, Jammu &amp; Kashmir Burushaski (JKB) &quot;has developed divergent linguistic features which make it systematically different from the varieties spoken in Pakistan.&quot; The dialect of Burushashki spoken in India has been influenced by Kashmiri, as well as Hindi and Urdu. Unique to JKB is the features of vowel syncopation. Jammu &amp; Kashmir Burushaski shares more similarities with the dialect spoken in Nagar than with that spoken in Hunza. The Srinagar variety of Burushaski has been known as low toned and is spoken a Kashmiri way of speaking the language. The Srinagar variety of Burushaski has only 300 speakers.

== Phonology ==

=== Vowels ===

Burushaski primarily has five vowels, /i e a o u/. There are two sets of long vowels, distinguished by whether it is the first or the second mora that bears a stress or higher pitch. Various contractions result in long vowels; stressed vowels (marked with acute accents in Berger&#x27;s transcription) tend to be longer and less &quot;open&quot; than unstressed ones ( as opposed to ). Some have described this as an intentional utterance of a rising tone or a falling tone. For example, a word &quot;óosanam&quot; ‘i made them say’ has a falling tone and the stress is on first mora. Another word, &quot;oósanam&quot; ‘i did not say’ has a rising tone and stress is on the second mora.

Long vowels only ever appear in stressed syllables, and will thus carry one tone or the other.

As for short vowels, mid vowels and open vowels [e], [o], [a] can appear in either stressed syllables or unstressed syllables. Short close vowels [i] and [u] usually only appear in unstressed syllables. Furthermore, the pair [i] and [u] alternate with [e] and [o] respectively in a stressed syllable.

All vowels have nasal counterparts in Hunza (in some expressive words) and in Nager (also in proper names and a few other words).

=== Consonants ===

Berger (1998) finds the following consonants to be phonemic, shown below in the and in his romanization scheme:
Notes:
== Writing system ==
=== Modern evolution ===
Burushaski is predominantly a spoken rather than a written language. One of the earliest examples of modern Burushaski literature was the poetry written by Prof. Allamah Nasiruddin Nasir Hunzai in the 1940s. He began by using the Urdu alphabet to write the language, but soon realized that Urdu script was not adequate to the task, since it lacked the necessary letters to represent certain phonemes unique to Burushaski. This led him to undertake the task of devising a standardised Urdu-derived alphabet geared specifically to the accurate transcription of the Burushaski language. To this end, he went on to create the new consonants ݼ [tsʰ], څ [ʈʂ], ڎ [ts], ݽ [ʂ], ڞ [ʈʂʰ], and ݣ [ŋ]. Furthermore, innovative writers of Burushaski began to use superscript Urdu numbers to indicate different stress patterns, tones and vowel-lengths. For example, in Burushaski, the letter ـو (&quot;waw&quot;) represents a long vowel with a falling tone, &quot;óo&quot;. The letter ـݸ (&quot;waw&quot; with a superscript &quot;2&quot;) represents a short vowel &quot;o&quot;, and the letter ـݹ (&quot;waw&quot; with a superscript 3) represents a long vowel with a rising tone, &quot;oó&quot;.

Parallel to this, a Latin-derived orthography was created by Hermann Berger - a system which has found favour among many researchers and linguists. The &quot;Burushaski Research Academy&quot; currently recognises both the Urdu-based and the Latin-based orthography.

In the years, 2006, 2009, and 2013, a 3-volume Burushaski-Urdu Dictionary was compiled in a collaboration between the &quot;Burushaski Research Academy&quot; and the University of Karachi, under the auspices of Prof. Allamah Nasiruddin Nasir Hunzai and published by the university&#x27;s &quot;Bureau of Composition, Compilation &amp; Translation&quot;. This dictionary uses primarily the Urdu-derived alphabet, while employing Berger&#x27;s Latin alphabet-derived orthography in a supplementary capacity.

=== History ===

Tibetan sources record a &quot;Bru zha&quot; language of the Gilgit valley, which appears to have been Burushaski and the script of which was one of five used also to write the extinct Zhangzhung language. Although Burushaski may once have been a significant literary language, no &quot;Bru zha&quot; manuscripts are known to have survived. There is a very voluminous Buddhist tantra of the &#x27;Ancient&#x27; (&quot;rNying ma&quot;) school of Tibetan Buddhism, preserved in Tibetan as the &quot;mDo dgongs &#x27;dus&quot;, which has been the subject of numerous Tibetological publications, including a recent monograph by Jacob P. Dalton, &quot;The Gathering of Intentions&quot;, which is supposed to be translated from the Burushaski (&quot;bru zha&#x27;i skad&quot;). It contains words that are not Sanskrit but which have not, thus far, been demonstrated satisfactorily to be relatable either to Burushaski, or to any other language (or, for that matter, to be purely &quot;elfic&quot;). If at least part of this text had actually been translated from Burushaski, it would make it one of the major monuments of an apparently lost literature.

=== Alphabet ===

Below table shows the standardized orthography used in University of Karachi-published Burushaski-Urdu Dictionary.

In addition, linguists working on Burushaski use various makeshift transcriptions based on the Latin alphabet, most commonly that by Berger (see below), in their publications.

==== Aspirates ====

Below table shows the digraphs, a combination of a consonant with the letter &quot;round he&quot; () that represent aspirated consonants that occur in Burushaski.

==== Vowels ====

Below tables show how vowels are written in different parts of the word.



=== Sample text ===

Below poetry, written in praise of University of Karachi for its role in documentation and preservation of Burushaski language and literature, is presented as a sample text in Burushaski Arabic alphabet, alongside Urdu and English translation of each verse.

== Grammar ==
Burushaski is a double-marking language and word order is generally subject–object–verb.

Nouns in Burushaski are divided into four genders: human masculine, human feminine, countable objects, and uncountable ones (similar to mass nouns). The assignment of a noun to a particular gender is largely predictable. Some words can belong both to the countable and to the uncountable class, producing differences in meaning. For example, when countable, &quot;báalt&quot; means &#x27;apple&#x27; but when uncountable, it means &#x27;apple tree&#x27; (Grune 1998).

Noun morphology consists of the noun stem, a possessive prefix (mandatory for some nouns, and thus an example of inherent possession), and number and case suffixes. Distinctions in number are singular, plural, indefinite, and grouped. Cases include absolutive, ergative/oblique, genitive, and several locatives; the latter indicate both location and direction and may be compounded.

Burushaski verbs have three basic stems: past tense, present tense, and consecutive. The past stem is the citation form and is also used for imperatives and nominalization; the consecutive stem is similar to a past participle and is used for coordination. Agreement on the verb has both nominative and ergative features: transitive verbs and unaccusatives mark both the subject and the object of a clause, while unergatives verbs mark only subject agreement on the verb. Altogether, a verb can take up to four prefixes and six suffixes.

=== Nouns ===

==== Noun classes ====
In Burushaski, there are four noun classes, similar to declensional classes in Indo-European languages, but unlike Indo-European, the nominal classes in Burushaski are associated with four grammatical &quot;genders&quot;:
* m = male human beings, gods and spirits
* f = female human beings and spirits
* x = animals, countable nouns
* y = abstract concepts, fluids, uncountable nouns

Below, the abbreviation &quot;h&quot; will stand for the combination of the m- and f-classes, while &quot;hx&quot; will stand for the combination of the m-, f- and x-classes. Nouns in the x-class typically refer to countable, non-human beings or things, for example animals, fruit, stones, eggs, or coins; conversely, nouns in the y-class are as a rule uncountable abstractions or mass nouns, such as rice, fire, water, snow, wool, etc.

However, these rules are not universal – countable objects in the y-class are sometimes encountered, e.g. &quot;ha&quot;, &#x27;house&#x27;. Related words can subtly change their meanings when used in different classes – for example, &quot;bayú&quot;, when a member of the x-class, means salt in clumps, but when in the y-class, it means powdered salt. Fruit trees are understood collectively and placed in the y-class, but their individual fruits belong to the x-class. Objects made of particular materials can belong to either the x- or the y- class: stone and wood are in the x-class, but metal and leather in the y-class. The article, adjectives, numerals and other attributes must be in agreement with the noun class of their subject.

==== Pluralisation ====
There are two numbers in Burushaski: singular and plural. The singular is unmarked, while the plural is expressed by means of suffix, which vary depending on the class of the noun:
* h-class: possible suffixes 
* h- and x-class: possible suffixes 
* y-class: possible suffixes (Nagar dialect)

Some nouns admit two or three different suffixes, while others have no distinctive suffix, and occur only in the plural, e.g. &quot;bras&quot; &#x27;rice&#x27;, &quot;gur&quot; &#x27;wheat&#x27;, &quot;bishké&quot;, &#x27;fur&#x27;, (cf. plurale tantum). On the other hand, there are also nouns which have identical forms in the singular and plural, e.g. &quot;hagúr&quot; &#x27;horses&#x27;. Adjectives have a unique plural suffix, whose form depends on the class of the noun they modify, e.g. &quot;burúm&quot; &#x27;white&#x27; gives the x-class plural &quot;burum-išo&quot; and the y-class plural &quot;burúm-ing&quot;.

Examples of pluralisation in Burushaski:
* (m), pl. &quot;wazíirishu&quot; &#x27;vizier, minister&#x27;
* (m), pl. &quot;hiri&quot; &#x27;man&#x27; (stress shifts)
* (f), pl. &quot;gushínga&quot; &#x27;woman&#x27; (stress shifts)
* (f), pl. &quot;daseyoo&quot; &#x27;girl&#x27;, &#x27;unmarried woman&#x27;
* (x), pl. &quot;huká&quot; &#x27;dog&#x27;
* (x), pl. &quot;tilí&quot; &#x27;walnut&#x27;
* (y), pl. &quot;theleng&quot; &#x27;walnut tree&#x27;

==== Declension ====
Burushaski is an ergative language. It has five primary cases.

The case suffixes are appended to the plural suffix, e.g. &quot;Huséiniukutse&quot;, &#x27;the people of Hussein&#x27; (ergative plural). The genitive ending is irregular, /mo/, for singular f-class nouns, but /-e/ in all others (identical to the ergative ending). The dative ending, /-ar/, /-r/ is attached to the genitive ending for singular f-class nouns, but to the stem for all others. Examples:
* &quot;hir-e&quot; &#x27;the man&#x27;s&#x27;, &quot;gus-mo&quot; &#x27;the woman&#x27;s&#x27; (gen.)
* &quot;hir-ar&quot; &#x27;to the man&#x27;, &quot;gus-mu-r&quot; &#x27;to the woman&#x27; (dat.)

The genitive is placed before the thing possessed: &quot;Hunzue tham&quot;, &#x27;the Emir of Hunza.&#x27;

The endings of the secondary cases are formed from a secondary case suffix (or infix) and one of the primary endings /-e/, /-ar/ or /-um/. These endings are directional, /-e/ being locative (answering &#x27;where?&#x27;), /-ar/ being terminative (answering &#x27;where to?&#x27;), and /-um/ being ablative (answering &#x27;where from?&#x27;). The infixes, and their basic meanings, are as follows:

# &quot;-ts-&quot; &#x27;at&#x27;
# &quot;-ul-&quot; &#x27;in&#x27;
# &quot;-aṭ-&quot; &#x27;on; with&#x27;
# &quot;-al-&quot; &#x27;near&#x27; (only in the Hunza dialect)

From these, the following secondary or compound cases are formed:

The regular endings /-ul-e/ and /-ul-ar/ are archaic and are now replaced by /-ul-o/ and /-ar-ulo/ respectively.

==== Pronouns and pronominal prefixes ====
Nouns indicating parts of the body and kinship terms are accompanied by an obligatory pronominal prefix. Thus, one cannot simply say &#x27;mother&#x27; or &#x27;arm&#x27; in Burushaski, but only &#x27;my arm&#x27;, &#x27;your mother&#x27;, &#x27;his father&#x27;, etc. For example, the root &quot;mi&quot; &#x27;mother&#x27;, is never found in isolation, instead one finds:
* &quot;i-mi&quot; &#x27;his mother&#x27;, &quot;mu-mi&quot; &#x27;her mother&#x27;, &quot;gu-mi&quot; &#x27;your mother&#x27;(3f sg.), &quot;u-mi&quot; &#x27;their mother&#x27; (3h pl.), &quot;u-mi-tsaro&quot; &#x27;their mothers&#x27;(3h pl.).

The pronominal, or personal, prefixes agree with the person, number and – in the third person, the class of their noun. A summary of the basic forms is given in the following table:

Personal pronouns in Burushaski distinguish proximal and distal forms, e.g. &quot;khin&quot; &#x27;he, this one here&#x27;, but &quot;in&quot;, &#x27;he, that one there&#x27;. In the oblique, there are additional abbreviated forms.

=== Numerals ===
The Burushaski number system is vigesimal, i.e. based on the number 20. For example, 20 &quot;altar&quot;, 40 &quot;alto-altar&quot; (2 times 20), 60 &quot;iski-altar&quot; (3 times 20) etc. The base numerals are:
* 1 &quot;han&quot; (or &quot;hen&quot;, &quot;hak&quot;)
* 2 &quot;altó&quot; (or &quot;altán&quot;)
* 3 &quot;isko&quot; (or &quot;iskey&quot;)
* 4 &quot;wálto&quot;
* 5 &quot;čindó&quot;
* 6 &quot;mishíndo&quot;
* 7 &quot;thaló&quot;
* 8 &quot;altámbo&quot;
* 9 &quot;hunchó&quot;
* 10 &quot;tóorumo&quot; (also &quot;toorimi&quot; and &quot;turma&quot;)
* 100 &quot;tha&quot;

Examples of compound numerals:

11 &quot;turma-han&quot;, 12 &quot;turma-alto&quot;, 13 &quot;turma-isko&quot;, ... , 19 &quot;turma-hunti&quot;;
20 &quot;altar&quot;, 30 &quot;altar-toorumo&quot;, 40 &quot;alto-altar&quot;, 50 &quot;alto-altar-toorumo&quot;, 60 &quot;iski-altar&quot; and so on;
21 &quot;altar-hak&quot;, 22 &quot;altar-alto&quot;, 23 &quot;altar-isko&quot; and so on.

=== Verbs ===

==== Overview ====
The verbal morphology of Burushaski is extremely complicated and rich in forms. Many sound changes can take place, including assimilation, deletion and accent shift, which are unique for almost every verb. Here, we can specify only certain basic principles.

The Burushaski finite verb falls into the following categories:

For many transitive verbs, in addition to the subject, the (direct) object is also indicated, also by pronominal prefixes which vary according to person, number and class. All verbs have negative forms, and many intransitive verbs also have derived transitive forms. The infinitive forms – which in Burushaski are the absolutives of the past and present, the perfect participle, and two infinitives – admit all the finite variations except tense and mood. Infinitive forms are made together with auxiliary verbs and periphrastic forms.

==== The 11 positions of the finite verb ====
All verb forms can be constructed according to a complex but regular position system. Berger describes a total of 11 possible positions, or slots, although not all of these will be filled in any given verb form. Many positions also have several alternative contents (indicated by A/B/C below). The verb stem is in position 5, preceded by four possible prefixes and followed by seven possible suffixes. The following table gives an overview of the positions and their functions

==== Formation of tenses and moods ====
The formation of the tenses and moods involves the use of several positions, or slots, in complicated ways. The preterite, perfect, pluperfect and conative are formed from the &#x27;simple stem,&#x27; whereas the present, imperfect, future and conditional are formed from the &#x27;present stem,&#x27; which is itself formed from the simple stem by placing -č- in position 7. The optative and imperative are derived directly from the stem. Altogether, the schema is as follows:

The formation of the tenses and moods of the verb &quot;her&quot; &#x27;to cry&#x27;, without prefixes:



==== Indication of the subject and object ====
The subject and object of the verb are indicated by the use of personal prefixes and suffixes in positions 3, 8 and 10 as follows:

The personal prefixes are identical to the pronominal prefixes of nouns (mandatory with body parts and kinship terms, as above). A simplified overview of the forms of the affixes is given in the following table:

For example, the construction of the preterite of the transitive verb &quot;phus&quot; &#x27;to tie&#x27;, with prefixes and suffixes separated by hyphens, is as follows :
* &quot;i-phus-i-m-i&quot; &quot;he ties him&quot; (filled positions: 3-5-8-9-10)
* &quot;mu-phus-i-m-i&quot; &quot;he ties her (f)&quot;
* &quot;u-phus-i-m-i&quot; &quot;he ties them (pl. hx)&quot;
* &quot;mi-phus-i-m-i&quot; &quot;he ties us&quot;
* &quot;i-phus-i-m-an&quot; &quot;we/you/they tie him&quot;
* &quot;mi-phus-i-m-an&quot; &quot;you/they tie us&quot;
* &quot;i-phus-i-m-a&quot; &quot;I tie it&quot;
* &quot;gu-phus-i-m-a&quot; &quot;I tie you&quot;

The personal affixes are also used when the noun occupies the role of the subject or the object, e.g. &quot;hir i-ír-i-mi&quot; &#x27;the man died&#x27;. With intransitive verbs, the subject function is indicated by both a prefix and a suffix, as in:
* &quot;gu-ir-č-u-m-a&quot; &quot;you will die&quot; (future)
* &quot;i-ghurts-i-m-i&quot; &quot;he sank&quot; (preterite)

Personal prefixes do not occur in all verbs and all tenses. Some verbs do not admit personal prefixes, others still do so only under certain circumstances. Personal prefixes used with intransitive verbs often express a volitional function, with prefixed forms indicating an action contrary to the intention of the subject. For example:
* &quot;hurúṭ-i-m-i&quot; &quot;he sat down&quot; (volitional action without prefix)
* &quot;i-ír-i-m-i&quot; &quot;he died&quot; (involuntary action with prefix)
* &quot;ghurts-i-mi&quot; &quot;he went willingly underwater&quot;, &quot;he dove&quot; (without prefix)
* &quot;i-ghurts-i-m-i&quot; &quot;he went unwillingly underwater&quot;, &quot;he sank&quot; (with prefix)

==== The d- prefix ====
A number of verbs – mostly according to their root form – are found with the d-prefix in position 2, which occurs before a consonant according to vowel harmony. The precise semantic function of the d-prefix is unclear. With primary transitive verbs the d-prefix, always without personal prefixes, forms regular intransitives. Examples:
* &quot;i-phalt-i-mi&quot; &#x27;he breaks it open&#x27; (transitive)
* &quot;du-phalt-as&quot; &#x27;to break open, to explode&#x27; (intransitive)

A master&#x27;s thesis research work of a native speaker of Burushaski on Middle Voice Construction in the Hunza Dialect claims that the [dd-] verbal prefix is an overt morphological middle marker for MV constructions, while the [n-] verbal prefix is a morphological marker for passive voice. The data primarily come from the Hunza dialect of Burushaski, but analogous phenomena can be observed in other dialects. This research is based on a corpus of 120 dd-prefix verbs. This research has showed that position {-2} on the verb template is occupied by voice-marker in Burushaski. The author argues that the middle marker is a semantic category of its own and that it is clearly distinguished from the reflexive marker in this language. The middle marker (MM) means the grammatical device used to &quot;indicate that the two semantic roles of Initiator and Endpoint refer to a single holistic entity&quot; (Kemmer 1993: 47). In the view of that definition, I look at a middle marked verb in Burushaski and illustration follows the example.
* &quot;hiles dd-i-il-imi&quot; &#x27;the boy drenched&#x27;

<doc id="161693" wikidata="Q203073" url="?curid=161693" title="Ross Dependency">
<text>The Ross Dependency is a region of Antarctica defined by a sector originating at the South Pole, passing along longitudes 160° east to 150° west, and terminating at latitude 60° south. It is claimed by New Zealand, a claim mutually accepted only by Australia, the UK, France and Norway, which are countries that also have territorial claims in Antarctica. Under the 1961 Antarctic Treaty, of which all territorial claimants are signatories, including New Zealand, all claims are held in abeyance. Article IV states: &quot;No acts or activities taking place while the present Treaty is in force shall constitute a basis for asserting, supporting or denying a claim to territorial sovereignty in Antarctica or create any rights of sovereignty in Antarctica&quot;.

The Dependency takes its name from Sir James Clark Ross, who discovered the Ross Sea and includes part of Victoria Land, and most of the Ross Ice Shelf. Ross, Balleny, Scott and Roosevelt Islands also form part of the Dependency.

== History of claim ==
Following his discovery of Victoria Land in 1841, James Clark Ross took possession of this territory, along with the surrounding sea, on behalf of Britain. On 30 July 1923, the British Government passed an Order in Council under the British Settlements Act 1887, which defined the current borders of the Ross Dependency as follows:

The Order in Council then went on to appoint the governor-general and commander-in-chief of New Zealand as the governor of the territory. This Order in Council was published in the &quot;New Zealand Gazette&quot; on 16 August 1923, and on 14 November 1923, the governor-general issued regulations extending New Zealand law to the Ross Dependency.

After the Order in Council was read in the New Zealand House of Representatives by the Prime Minister of New Zealand William Massey, a clarification was made by the Attorney-General Sir Francis Bell in the legislative council. Bell stated:

It has been said that the Order in Council contained no suggestion of a transfer to New Zealand of the United Kingdom&#x27;s claim, but the fact remains that the territory is administered by the Government of New Zealand. Technically, the claim is that of the monarch and they can exercise it through any of their governments.

At an Imperial Conference in 1930, it was agreed that the governors-general of the Dominions would be appointed by the king on the advice of the Dominion in question. And following the passing of the Statute of Westminster in 1931 (which was adopted in full by New Zealand in 1947), the Government of the United Kingdom relinquished all control over the government of New Zealand. This however had no bearing on the obligations of the governor-general of New Zealand in their capacity as governor of the Ross Dependency on the appointment of the Government of the United Kingdom. Then in the year 1959, the Antarctic Treaty was signed by twelve nations, which included both the United Kingdom and New Zealand.

The New Zealand government began to take some interest in the territory in 1955. As reliance on the United Kingdom waned, New Zealand&#x27;s exercise of authority began to rely on the United States, which maintained a much larger presence in the territory, despite the United States not recognising the New Zealand claim and reserving the right to make a claim of its own. The New Zealand Scott Base was established close to the American McMurdo Station, and Americans in the territory are exempt from taxation, customs, and criminal jurisdiction in minor matters.

== Geography and habitation ==
The actual amount of land mass claimed is not large; most of the area defined as being in the Ross Dependency is either in the Ross Sea or the Antarctic Ocean. It is the second-smallest of the claims which were made before the implementation of the Antarctic Treaty System and the suspension of all territorial claims to Antarctica proper. Officers of the Government of the Ross Dependency are annually appointed to run the Dependency. The New Zealand Geographic Board has named many features within the Dependency.

The scientific bases of Scott Base (New Zealand), McMurdo Station (US), Zucchelli Station (Italy) and Jang Bogo Station (South Korea) are the only permanently occupied human habitations in the area, though Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station (US) is partially within the territory and dependent on logistics operations based in New Zealand. China is establishing a year-round research station at Inexpressible Island in Terra Nova Bay of the Ross Sea that opened in 2024. The Dependency has access to US Antarctic Program-maintained snow runways at Williams Field and Phoenix Airfield. This guarantees accessibility by wheeled and ski-equipped aircraft year-round.

From 1969 to 1995 New Zealand operated a summer-only base called Vanda Station in the Dry Valley area of the Dependency.

The New Zealand Defence Force is tasked with providing support for New Zealand programmes in Antarctica. This is provided by the Royal New Zealand Air Force&#x27;s C-130J and Boeing 757 aircraft. New Zealand military personnel also fulfill communications, logistics and other duties at Scott Base. In 2020, the Royal New Zealand Navy commissioned a new logistics support ship, , which is a Polar-class Level 6 vessel (Summer/autumn operation in medium first-year ice) capable of berthing at McMurdo Station (ten minutes by jeep from Scott Base) for resupply purposes. 

About 1.12 million square kilometres of the Ross Sea region have been declared a Marine Protected Area (MPA). In this regard, the Navy is tasked with conducing Southern Ocean patrols during the fishing season to enforce international rules and fight against illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing.

Greenpeace maintained its Antarctic station in the Ross Dependency called World Park Base from 1987 to 1992, which was on Ross Island. As this base was a non-governmental entity, the official policy of the signatory nations of the Antarctic Treaty was not to give any support or assistance to it.

==Other events==

In 1979, an Air New Zealand sightseeing flight crashed into the slopes of Mount Erebus killing all 257 people on board. It was the most deadly air crash in the history of both Antarctica and New Zealand (see Mount Erebus disaster).

In the summer of 1985, when the British non-governmental exploratory vessel &quot;Southern Quest&quot; sank in the Ross Sea, the United States Coast Guard helicopters rescued the crew, who were taken to McMurdo Station. The British expedition was criticised by scientists in the Antarctic because the rescue and return of the crew disrupted their work.

In 2006, the New Zealand police reported that jurisdictional issues prevented them from issuing warrants for potential American witnesses who were reluctant to testify during the Christchurch Coroner&#x27;s investigation into the poisoning death of Rodney Marks at the South Pole base.

<text>The Ross Sea is a deep bay of the Southern Ocean in Antarctica, between Victoria Land and Marie Byrd Land and within the Ross Embayment, and is the southernmost sea on Earth. It derives its name from the British explorer James Clark Ross who visited this area in 1841. To the west of the sea lies Ross Island and Victoria Land, to the east Roosevelt Island and Edward VII Peninsula in Marie Byrd Land, while the southernmost part is covered by the Ross Ice Shelf, and is about from the South Pole. Its boundaries and area have been defined by the New Zealand National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research as having an area of .

The circulation of the Ross Sea is dominated by a wind-driven ocean gyre and the flow is strongly influenced by three submarine ridges that run from southwest to northeast. The circumpolar deep water current is a relatively warm, salty and nutrient-rich water mass that flows onto the continental shelf at certain locations. The Ross Sea is covered with ice for most of the year.

The nutrient-laden water supports an abundance of plankton and this encourages a rich marine fauna. At least ten mammal species, six bird species and 95 fish species are found here, as well as many invertebrates, and the sea remains relatively unaffected by human activities. New Zealand has claimed that the sea comes under its jurisdiction as part of the Ross Dependency. Marine biologists consider the sea to have a high level of biological diversity and it is the site of much scientific research. It is also the focus of some environmentalist groups who have campaigned to have the area proclaimed as a world marine reserve. In 2016 an international agreement established the region as a marine park.

==Description==
The Ross Sea was discovered by the Ross expedition in 1841. In the west of the Ross Sea is Ross Island with the Mt. Erebus volcano; in the east is Roosevelt Island. The southern part is covered by the Ross Ice Shelf. Roald Amundsen started his South Pole expedition in 1911 from the Bay of Whales, which was located at the shelf. In the western parts of the Ross Sea, McMurdo Sound is a port that is usually free of ice during the summer. The southernmost part of the Ross Sea is Gould Coast, which is approximately from the geographic South Pole. 

== Geology ==

=== The continental shelf ===

 The Ross Sea (and Ross Ice Shelf) overlies a deep continental shelf. Although the average depth of the world&#x27;s continental shelves (at the shelf break joining the continental slope) is about 130 meters, the Ross shelf average depth is about 500 meters. It is shallower in the western Ross Sea (east longitudes) than the east (west longitudes). This over-deepened condition is due to cycles of erosion and deposition of sediments from expanding and contracting ice sheets overriding the shelf during Oligocene and later time, and is also found on other locations around Antarctica. Erosion was more focused on the inner parts of the shelf while deposition of sediment dominated the outer shelf, making the inner shelf deeper than the outer.

Seismic studies in the latter half of the twentieth century defined the major features of the geology of the Ross Sea. The deepest or basement rocks, are faulted into four major north trending graben systems, which are basins for sedimentary fill. These basins include the Northern and Victoria Land Basin in the west, the Central Trough, and the Eastern Basin, which has approximately the same width as the other three. The Coulman High separates the Victoria Land Basin and Central Trough and the Central High separates the Central Trough and Eastern Basin. The majority of the faulting and accompanying graben formation along with crustal extension occurred during the rifting away of the Zealandia microcontinent from Antarctica in Gondwana during Cretaceous time. Paleogene and Neogene -age and faulting and extension is restricted to the Victoria Land Basin and Northern Basin.

=== Stratigraphy ===
Basement grabens are filled with rift sediments of uncertain character and age. A widespread unconformity has cut into the basement and sedimentary fill of the large basins. Above this major unconformity (named RSU-6) are a series of glacial marine sedimentary units deposited during multiple advances and retreats of the Antarctic Ice Sheet across the sea floor of the Ross Sea during the Oligocene and later.

=== Geologic drilling ===
Drill holes have recovered cores of rock from the western edges of the sea. The most ambitious recent efforts are the Cape Roberts Project (CRP) and the ANDRILL project. Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Leg 28 completed several holes (270–273) farther from land in the central and western portions of the sea. These resulted in defining a stratigraphy for most of the older glacial sequences, which comprise Oligocene and younger sediments. The Ross Sea-wide major unconformity RSU-6 has been proposed to mark a global climate event and the first appearance of the Antarctic Ice Sheet in the Oligocene.

During 2018, Expedition 374 of the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP), the latest successor to the DSDP, drilled additional holes (U1521–1525) in the central Ross Sea for determining Neogene and Quaternary ice sheet history.

=== Basement ===
The nature of the basement rocks and the fill within the grabens are known in few locations. Basement rocks have been sampled at DSDP Leg 28 drill site 270 where metamorphic rocks of unknown age were recovered, and in the eastern Ross Sea where a bottom dredge was collected. In both these locations the metamorphic rocks are mylonites deformed in the Cretaceous suggesting extreme stretching of the Ross Embayment during that time.

Marie Byrd Land – Rocks exposed in western Marie Byrd Land on the Edward VII Peninsula and within the Ford Ranges are candidates for basement in the eastern Ross Sea. The oldest rocks are Permian sediments of the Swanson Formation, which is slightly metamorphosed. The Ford granodiorite of Devonian age intrudes these sediments. Cretaceous Byrd Coast granite in turn intrudes the older rocks. The Byrd Coast and older formations have been cut by basalt dikes. Scattered through the Ford Ranges and Fosdick Mountains are late Cenozoic volcanic rocks that are not found to the west on Edward VII Peninsula. Metamorphic rocks, migmatites, are found in the Fosdick Mountains and Alexandra Mountains. These were metamorphosed and deformed in the Cretaceous.

The Ross Supergroup system and Beacon Supergroup – Ross System rocks exposed in Victoria Land and in the Transantarctic Mountains on the western side of the Ross Sea are possible basement rock below the sedimentary cover of the sea floor. The rocks are of upper Precambrian to lower Paleozoic in age, deformed in many places during the Ross Orogeny in the Cambrian. These miogeosyncline metasedimentary rocks are partly composed of calcium carbonate, often including limestone. Groups within the Ross System include the Robertson Bay Group, Priestley Group, Skelton Group, Beardmore Group, Byrd Group, Queen Maud Group, and Koettlitz Group. The Robertson Bay Group compares closely with other Ross System members. The Priestley Group rocks are similar to those of the Robertson Bay Group and include dark slates, argillites, siltstones, fine sandstones and limestones. They can be found near the Priestley and Campbell glaciers. For thirty miles along the lower Skelton Glacier are the calcareous greywackes and argillites of the Skelton Group. The region between the lower Beardmore Glacier and the lower Shackelton Glacier sits the Beardmore Group. North of the Nimrod Glacier are four block faulted ranges that make up the Byrd Group. The contents of the Queen Maud Group area are mainly post-tectonic granite.

Beacon Sandstone of Devonian-Triassic age and the Ferarr volcanic rocks of Jurassic age are separated from the Ross Supergroup by the Kukri Peneplain. Beacon rocks are reported to have been recovered in the drill cores of the Cape Roberts Project at the western edge of the Ross Sea.

== Oceanography ==

=== Circulation ===

The Ross Sea circulation, dominated by polynya processes, is in general very slow-moving. Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) is a relatively warm, salty and nutrient-rich water mass that flows onto the continental shelf at certain locations in the Ross Sea. Through heat flux, this water mass moderates the ice cover. The near-surface water also provides a warm environment for some animals and nutrients to excite primary production. CDW transport onto the shelf is known to be persistent and periodic, and is thought to occur at specific locations influenced by bottom topography. The circulation of the Ross Sea is dominated by a wind-driven gyre. The flow is strongly influenced by three submarine ridges that run from southwest to northeast. Flow over the shelf below the surface layer consists of two anticyclonic gyres connected by a central cyclonic flow. The flow is considerable in spring and winter, due to influencing tides. The Ross Sea is covered with ice for much of the year and ice concentrations and in the south-central region little melting occurs. Ice concentrations in the Ross Sea are influenced by winds with ice remaining in the western region throughout the austral spring and generally melting in January due to local heating. This leads to extremely strong stratification and shallow mixed layers in the western Ross Sea. Observation and data access in the region is coordinated by the Ross Sea Working Group of the Southern Ocean Observing System.

==Ecological importance and conservation==
The Ross Sea is one of the last stretches of seas on Earth that remains relatively unaffected by human activities. Consequently, the Ross Sea has become a focus of numerous environmentalist groups who have campaigned to make the area a world marine reserve, citing the rare opportunity to protect the Ross Sea from a growing number of threats and destruction. The Ross Sea is regarded by marine biologists as having a very high biological diversity and as such has a long history of human exploration and scientific research, with some datasets going back over 150 years.

===Biodiversity===
The Ross Sea is home to at least 10 mammal species, half a dozen species of birds, 95 species of fish, and over 1,000 invertebrate species. Some species of birds that nest in and near the Ross Sea include the Adélie penguin, emperor penguin, Antarctic petrel, snow petrel, and south polar skua. Marine mammals in the Ross Sea include the Antarctic minke whale, killer whale, Weddell seal, crabeater seal, and leopard seal. Antarctic toothfish, Antarctic silverfish, Antarctic krill, and crystal krill also swim in the cold Antarctic water of the Ross Sea. A distinct ecotype of Orca called Type C can be found in the Ross Sea. 

Albatrosses rely on wind to travel and cannot get airborne in a calm. The westerlies do not extend as far south as the ice edge and therefore albatrosses do not travel often to the ice-pack. An albatross would be trapped on an ice floe for many days if it landed in the calm.

The coastal parts of the sea contain a number of rookeries of Adélie and Emperor penguins, which have been observed at a number of places around the Ross Sea, both towards the coast and outwards in open sea.

A 10-metre (32.8 feet) long colossal squid weighing 495 kilograms (1,091 lb) was captured in the Ross Sea on February 22, 2007.

===Toothfish fishery===
In 2010, the Ross Sea Antarctic toothfish fishery was independently certified by the Marine Stewardship Council, and has been rated as a &#x27;Good Alternative&#x27; by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch program. However, a 2008 document submitted to the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) reported significant declines in toothfish populations of McMurdo Sound coinciding with the development of the industrial toothfishing industry since 1996, and other reports have noted a coincident decrease in the number of orcas. The report recommended a full moratorium on fishing over the Ross shelf. In October 2012, Philippa Ross, James Ross&#x27; great, great, great granddaughter, voiced her opposition to fishing in the area.

In the southern winter of 2017 New Zealand scientists discovered the breeding ground of the Antarctic toothfish in the northern Ross Sea seamounts for the first time underscoring how little is known about the species.

===Marine Protected Area===
On 28 October 2016, at its annual meeting in Hobart, a Ross Sea marine park was declared by the CCAMLR, under an agreement signed by 24 countries and the European Union. It protected over 1.5 million square kilometers of sea and was the world&#x27;s largest protected area at the time. However, a sunset provision of 35 years was part of negotiations, which means it does not meet the International Union for Conservation of Nature definition of a marine protected area, which requires it to be permanent.

Beginning in 2005, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) commissioned scientific analysis and planning for Marine Protected Areas (MPA) in the Antarctic. In 2010, the CCAMLR endorsed their Scientific Committee&#x27;s proposal to develop Antarctic MPAs for conservation purposes. The US State Department submitted a proposal for a Ross Sea MPA at the September 2012 meeting of the CCAMLR. At this stage, a sustained campaign by various international and national NGOs commenced to accelerate the process.

In July 2013, the CCAMLR held a meeting in Bremerhaven in Germany, to decide whether to turn the Ross Sea into an MPA. The deal failed due to Russia voting against it, citing uncertainty about whether the commission had the authority to establish a marine protected area.

In October 2014, the MPA proposal was again defeated at the CCAMLR by votes against from China and Russia. At the October 2015 meeting a revised MPA proposal from the US and New Zealand was expanded with the assistance of China, who however shifted the MPA&#x27;s priorities from conservation by allowing commercial fishing. The proposal was again blocked by Russia.

<text>Ross Island is an island in Antarctica lying on the east side of McMurdo Sound and extending from Cape Bird in the north to Cape Armitage in the south, and a similar distance from Cape Royds in the west to Cape Crozier in the east.
The island is entirely volcanic.
Mount Erebus, , near the center, is an active volcano.
Mount Terror, about eastward, is an extinct volcano. 
Mount Bird rises to just south of Cape Bird.

Ross Island lies within the boundary of Ross Dependency, an area of Antarctica claimed by New Zealand. However, the claim is currently in abeyance by the International Antarctic Treaty System of 1961. Signatories of this treaty essentially agree that Antarctica is used for peaceful and scientific purposes. The United States and New Zealand each established bases, McMurdo and Scott, in the mid 1950s on Ross Island; the former is now the largest human settlement in Antarctica since its founding. The island is also home to early exploration shacks and memorials including Shackleton&#x27;s Hut at Cape Royds, Scott&#x27;s Hut at Cape Evans, and Discovery Hut at Hut Point.

Ross Island, although an island surrounded by water, is essentially permanently connected to the main Antarctica land mass by a glacial ice sheet on its south and eastern side: it is only the sea ice in McMurdo sound that melts and re-freezes each year. The South Pole Traverse goes from Ross Island across the ice sheet to the South Pole, and that road is opened seasonally to clear snow and check for new crevasses in the 21st century. At the edge of the Antarctic glacial ice sheet and McMurdo sound, is an ice cliff. The southern tip of Ross Island, Hut Point, has a harbor that is the southernmost harbor in the world, and is opened each year by icebreakers during the light season at the end of the year to bring supplies. From these bases resources flow to science projects and Antarctic bases and field stations not just on Ross island but many places throughout Antarctica. There are also several airports and airstrips around Ross Island, some of which are only open seasonally.
==History==
===Discovery===

This area was discovered by Sir James Clark Ross in 1841, but he thought it formed part of the mainland of Victoria Land. 
It was determined to be an island and named Ross Island by the British National Antarctic Expedition (1901-04), led by Robert Falcon Scott, in honor of Sir James Clark Ross.
Ross Island was the base for many of the early expeditions to Antarctica. It is the southernmost island reachable by sea. 
Huts built by Scott&#x27;s and Shackleton&#x27;s expeditions are still standing on the island, preserved as historical sites.

Today Ross Island is home to New Zealand&#x27;s Scott Base and to the largest Antarctic settlement, the United States Antarctic Program&#x27;s McMurdo Station. Greenpeace established World Park Base on the island and ran it for five years, from 1987 to 1992.

==Geography==
Because of the persistent presence of the ice sheet, the island is sometimes taken to be part of the Antarctic mainland. 
Only a small portion of the island is free of ice and snow.
Its area is .
Despite its relatively small size, Ross Island is the world&#x27;s 6th highest island and the highest island in Antarctica. It has the highest average elevation of any island.

Major volcanic peaks include, from west to east, Mount Bird, Mount Erebus, Mount Terra Nova and Mount Terror.
Mount Erebus is () is the planet&#x27;s southernmost active volcano.
The dormant volcano Mount Terror (), is the second highest on the island. 
They were named by Captain James Ross after his ships HMS &quot;Erebus&quot; and HMS &quot;Terror&quot;. 
The third highest elevation is Mount Bird, with Shell Glacier and Endeavour Piedmont Glacier on its slopes.

The Erebus hotspot is thought to be responsible for the island&#x27;s volcanic activity.


==Stations and huts==
The base of the Hut Point Peninsula is home to McMurdo Station, Scott Base and Discovery Hut.
Scott&#x27;s Hut is further north on the west coast, at Cape Evans.
North of this at Cape Royds is Shackleton&#x27;s Hut.
Finally, the Cape Bird Hut is just south of Cape Bird.
*McMurdo Station, established in 1955, is the largest station in Antarctica. It provides logistic support to the United States Antarctic Program. It has a harbor, landing strips, about 85 buildings including large three story structures, a power plant, warehouses and other infrastructure.
*Scott Base was established on Pram Point by New Zealand in 1957 as a permanent base supporting scientific researchers who visit Antarctica in the summer. The area under roof is about .
*Discovery Hut was built on Hut Point during the British National Antarctic Expedition 1901-1904 (Discovery Expedition). It was the first hut to be built on the island.
*Scott’s Hut at Cape Evans was the base for Robert Falcon Scott’s British Antarctic (Terra Nova) Expedition 1910–1913. It was built in January 1911 on a beach of volcanic scoria on the north-west side of Cape Evans. The Antarctic Heritage Trust has restored the hut and now maintains it.
*Shackleton&#x27;s Hut at Cape Royds is a prefabricated timber hut built in London in 1907 for Ernest Shackleton’s British Antarctic (Nimrod) Expedition 1907–1909. It was disassembled, then rebuilt on site, and used by the expedition for 14 months.
*Cape Bird Hut was a six-person shelter built at New Zealand&#x27;s Scott Base in 1966 and taken by helicopter to Cape Bird. It was rebuilt in 1991, can house eight people, and has a kitchen with a propane stove and diesel-powered central heating.

==Capes and peninsulas==
Capes and peninsulas include, clockwise from the south, the Hut Point Peninsula, Cape Evans, Cape Royds, Cape Bird, Cape Tennyson, Cape Crozier and Cape MacKay.
*Hut Point Peninsula is a long, narrow peninsula from wide and long, projecting south-west from the slopes of Mount Erebus.
*Cape Evans is a rocky cape on the west side of Ross Island, forming the north side of the entrance to Erebus Bay.
*Cape Royds is a dark rock cape forming the western extremity of Ross Island, facing on McMurdo Sound.
*Cape Bird marks the north extremity of Ross Island.
*Cape Tennyson is a rock cape on the north coast of Ross Island, about southeast of Cape Bird.
*Cape Crozier is the most easterly point of Ross Island.
*Cape MacKay is an ice-covered cape which forms the southeast extremity of Ross Island.

==Major bays==
Large bays include Erebus Bay, Wohlschlag Bay, Lewis Bay and Windless Bight.
*Erebus Bay is about wide between Cape Evans and Hut Point Peninsula, on the west side of Ross Island.
*Wohlschlag Bay is a large bay indenting the west side of Ross Island between Harrison Bluff and Cape Royds.
*Lewis Bay is a bay indenting the north coast of Ross Island between Mount Bird and Cape Tennyson.
*Windless Bight is the prominent bight indenting the south side of Ross Island eastward of Hut Point Peninsula.

==Major glaciers==

Major glaciers entering the sea or ice cap around the island include, clockwise from the south, Erebus Glacier and the Erebus Glacier Tongue, Barne Glacier, Shell Glacier, Terror Glacier and Aurora Glacier.

*Erebus Glacier is a glacier draining the lower southern slopes of Mount Erebus. It flows west to Erebus Bay where it forms the floating Erebus Glacier Tongue.
*Shell Glacier is a western lobe of the Mount Bird icecap. It descends steeply in the valley north of Trachyte Hill and Harrison Bluff in the center of the ice-free area on the lower western slopes of Mount Bird.
*Barne Glacier is a steep glacier which descends from the west slopes of Mount Erebus and terminates on the west side of Ross Island between Cape Barne and Cape Evans where it forms a steep ice cliff.
*Terror Glacier is a large glacier between Mount Terra Nova and Mount Terror, flowing south into Windless Bight.
*Aurora Glacier is a large glacier draining that part of Ross Island between Mount Erebus and Mount Terra Nova, and flowing south into McMurdo Ice Shelf.

<doc id="161697" wikidata="Q582825" url="?curid=161697" title="The Children of Men">
<text>The Children of Men is a dystopian novel by English writer P. D. James, published in 1992. Set in England in 2021, it centres on the results of mass infertility. James describes a United Kingdom that is steadily depopulating and focuses on a small group of resisters who do not share the disillusionment of the masses.

The book received very positive reviews from many critics such as Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, who called it &quot;wonderfully rich&quot; and &quot;a trenchant analysis of politics and power that speaks urgently&quot;. The academic Alan Jacobs said, &quot;Of all James&#x27; novels, &quot;The Children of Men&quot; is probably the most pointed in its social criticism, certainly the deepest in its theological reflection.&quot;

==Writing==
About writing the story P. D. James said &quot;I thought, if there was no future, how would we behave?&quot;.

==Plot==

The narrative voice for the novel alternates between the third person and the first person, the latter in the form of a diary kept by Dr. Theodore &quot;Theo&quot; Faron, an Oxford don.

The novel opens with the first entry in Theo&#x27;s diary. It is the year 2021, but the novel&#x27;s events have their origin in 1995, which is referred to as &quot;Year Omega&quot;. In 1994, the sperm count of human males plummeted to zero and, with no significant scientific breakthroughs, mankind now faces imminent extinction. The last people to be born are now called &quot;Omegas&quot;. &quot;A race apart&quot;, they enjoy various prerogatives. Theo writes that the last human being born on Earth has been killed in a pub brawl.

In 2006, Xan Lyppiatt, Theo&#x27;s rich and charismatic cousin, appoints himself Warden of England in the last general election. As people have lost all interest in politics, Lyppiatt abolishes democracy. He is called a despot and tyrant by his opponents, but the new society is officially referred to as egalitarian.

Theo is approached by a woman called Julian, a member of a group of dissidents calling themselves the Five Fishes. He meets with them at an isolated church. Rolf, their leader and Julian&#x27;s husband, is hostile, but the others—Miriam (a former midwife), Gascoigne (a man from a military family), Luke (a former priest), and Julian—are more personable. The group wants Theo to approach Xan on their behalf and ask for various reforms, including a return to a more democratic system. During their discussions, as Theo prepares to meet with Xan, the reader learns about the situation in the UK in 2021:

* The Omegas are described as beautiful (for females) and handsome (for males), but spoiled, over-entitled, and egotistical because of their youth and luxurious lifestyle. They are violent, remote, and unstable. They regard non-Omegas (elders) with undisguised contempt, yet they are spared punishment due to their age. According to rumors, some countries sacrifice Omegas in fertility rituals outside the UK.
*Due to the global infertility of mankind, newborn animals (such as kittens and puppies) are doted upon and treated as infants, pushed in prams, and dressed in children&#x27;s clothing. The latest trend in London is to have elaborate christening ceremonies for newborn pets.
* The country is governed by decree of the Council of England, which consists of five people. Parliament has been reduced to an advisory role. The aims of the council are (1) protection and security, (2) comfort, and (3) pleasure, corresponding to the Warden&#x27;s promises of: (1) freedom from fear, (2) freedom from want, and (3) freedom from boredom.
* The Grenadiers, formerly an elite regiment in the British Armed Forces, are the Warden&#x27;s private army. The State Secret Police (SSP) ensures the council&#x27;s decrees are executed.
* The courts still exist, but juries have been abolished. Under the &quot;new arrangements&quot;, defendants are tried by a judge and two magistrates. All convicted criminals are dumped at a penal colony on the Isle of Man. There is no , escape is almost impossible, visitors are forbidden, and prisoners may not write or receive letters.
* Every citizen is required to learn skills, such as animal husbandry, which they might need to help them survive if they happen to be among the last human beings in the UK.
* Foreign workers are lured into the country and then exploited. Young people, preferably Omegas, from poorer countries come to England to work there. These &quot;foreign Omegas&quot; or &quot;sojourners&quot; are imported to do undesirable work. They are sent back at age 60 (&quot;forcibly repatriated&quot;). British Omegas are not allowed to emigrate so as to prevent further loss of labor.
* Elderly/infirm citizens have become a burden; nursing homes are for the privileged few. The rest are expected and sometimes forced to commit suicide by taking part in a &quot;Quietus&quot; (council-sanctioned mass drowning) at age 60.
* The state has opened &quot;pornography centers&quot; as well as installed special transmitters that emit a kind of radiation designed to increase libido. Twice a year, healthy women under 45 must submit to a gynecological examination, and most men must have their sperm tested, to keep hope alive.

Theo&#x27;s meeting, which turns out to be a meeting with the full Council of England, does not go well. Some of the members resent him because he resigned as Xan&#x27;s advisor rather than share the responsibility of governing the UK. Xan guesses that Theo&#x27;s suggestions came from others and makes clear to Theo that he will take action against dissidents.

The Five Fishes distribute a leaflet detailing their demands. The SSP visit Theo. He sees Julian in the market shortly afterward. He tells her of the SSP visit, then tells her that if she ever needs him she only has to send for him. That night, however, Theo decides to leave England for the summer and visit the continent before nature overruns it.

Soon after Theo&#x27;s return, Miriam tells him that Gascoigne was arrested as he was trying to rig a Quietus landing stage to explode. The other Fishes are about to go on the run, and Julian wants him. Miriam reveals why Julian did not come herself: Julian is pregnant. Theo believes Julian is deceiving herself, but when the two meet, Julian invites Theo to listen to her baby&#x27;s heartbeat.

During the group&#x27;s flight, Luke is killed while trying to protect Julian during a confrontation with a wild gang of Omegas. Julian confesses that the father of her child is not Rolf, but rather the deceased Luke. Rolf, who believes he should rule the UK in Xan&#x27;s place, is angered at the discovery; he abandons the group to notify the Warden.

The group heads to a shack Theo knows of. Miriam delivers Julian&#x27;s baby: a boy, not a girl as Julian had thought. Miriam goes to find more supplies; after she is gone too long, Theo investigates. He finds Miriam dead, garrotted in a nearby house. Theo returns to Julian, but soon afterward Julian hears a noise outside: Xan.

Theo and Xan confront each other and both fire one shot. The sudden wailing of the baby startles Xan, causing him to miss, as Rolf had thought the baby would not be born for another month. Theo shoots and kills Xan. He removes from Xan&#x27;s finger the Coronation Ring, which Xan had taken to wearing as a symbol of authority, and seems poised to become the new leader of the UK, at least temporarily. The other members of the council are introduced to the baby, whom Theo baptizes.

==Adaptation==

In 2006, a film adaptation by Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón and starring Julianne Moore and Clive Owen was released. Cuarón used the premise as a jumping-off point to address contemporary issues such as the treatment of refugees. The film was well received. According to Cuarón, P. D. James said in a statement sent to Universal that she was proud to be associated with it despite its differences from the source material.

==Critical reception==
On 5 November 2019 BBC News included &quot;The Children of Men&quot; on its list of the 100 most influential novels.

Critics praised the &quot;powerful imagining&quot; and world building of the scenario of human infertility.

<text>Mount Erebus () is the southernmost active volcano on Earth, located on Ross Island in the Ross Dependency in Antarctica. With a summit elevation of , it is the second most prominent mountain in Antarctica (after Mount Vinson) and the second-highest volcano in Antarctica (after the dormant Mount Sidley). It is the highest point on Ross Island, which is also home to three inactive volcanoes: Mount Terror, Mount Bird, and Mount Terra Nova. It makes Ross Island the sixth-highest island on Earth.

The mountain was named by Captain James Clark Ross in 1841 for his ship, HMS Erebus. The volcano has been active for around 1.3 million years and has a long-lived lava lake in its inner summit crater that has been present since at least the early 1970s. On 28 November, 1979, Air New Zealand Flight 901 crashed on Mount Erebus, killing all 257 people on board.

==Geology and volcanology==
Mount Erebus is the world&#x27;s southernmost active volcano. It is the current eruptive centre of the Erebus hotspot. The summit contains a persistent convecting phonolitic lava lake, one of five long-lasting lava lakes on Earth. Characteristic eruptive activity consists of Strombolian eruptions from the lava lake or from one of several subsidiary vents, all within the volcano&#x27;s inner crater. The volcano is scientifically remarkable in that its relatively low-level and unusually persistent eruptive activity enables long-term volcanological study of a Strombolian eruptive system very close (hundreds of metres) to the active vents, a characteristic shared with only a few volcanoes on Earth, such as Stromboli in Italy. Scientific study of the volcano is also facilitated by its proximity to McMurdo Station (U.S.) and Scott Base (New Zealand), both sited on the same island around 35 km away.

Mount Erebus is classified as a polygenetic stratovolcano. The bottom half of the volcano is a shield and the top half is a stratocone. The composition of the current eruptive products of Erebus are anorthoclase-porphyritic tephritic phonolite and phonolite, which are the bulk of exposed lava flow on the volcano. The oldest eruptive products consist of relatively undifferentiated and nonviscous basanite lavas that form the low broad platform shield of Erebus. Slightly younger basanite and phonotephrite lavas crop out on Fang Ridgean eroded remnant of an early Erebus volcanoand at other isolated locations on the flanks of Erebus. Erebus is the world&#x27;s only presently erupting phonolite volcano.

Lava flows of more viscous phonotephrite and trachyte erupted after the basanite. The upper slopes of Mount Erebus are dominated by steeply dipping (about 30°) tephritic phonolite lava flows with large-scale flow levees. A conspicuous break in slope around 3,200 m ASL calls attention to a summit plateau representing a caldera. The summit caldera was created by an explosive VEI-6 eruption that occurred 18,000 ± 7,000 years ago. It is filled with small volume tephritic phonolite and phonolite lava flows. In the center of the summit caldera is a small, steep-sided cone composed primarily of decomposed lava bombs and a large deposit of anorthoclase crystals known as Erebus crystals. The active lava lake in this summit cone undergoes continuous degassing.

Microscopic gold particles have been found up to 1000 kilometers from Mount Erebus, ranging in size up to 60 micrometres. A 1991 paper shows that these particles condense from the volcano&#x27;s emissions that include 80 grams of gold vapor daily. This amount of gold vapor is low compared to other volcanoes, but the condensation from vapor into gold particles is the first ever documented.

Researchers spent more than three months during the 2007–08 field season installing an atypically dense array of seismometers around Mount Erebus to listen to waves of energy generated by small, controlled blasts from explosives they buried along its flanks and perimeter, and to record scattered seismic signals generated by lava lake eruptions and local ice quakes. By studying the refracted and scattered seismic waves, the scientists produced an image of the uppermost (top few km) of the volcano to understand the geometry of its &quot;plumbing&quot; and how the magma rises to the lava lake.
 These results demonstrated a complex upper-volcano conduit system with appreciable upper-volcano magma storage to the northwest of the lava lake at depths hundreds of meters below the surface.

==Ice fumaroles==

Mount Erebus is notable for its numerous ice fumaroles – ice towers that form around gases that escape from vents in the surface. The ice caves associated with the fumaroles are dark, in polar alpine environments starved in organics and with oxygenated hydrothermal circulation in highly reducing host rock. The life is sparse, mainly bacteria and fungi. This makes it of special interest for studying oligotrophs – organisms that can survive on minimal amounts of resources.

The caves on Erebus are of special interest for astrobiology, as most surface caves are influenced by human activities, or by organics from the surface brought in by animals (e.g. bats and birds) or ground water. The caves at Erebus are at high altitude, yet accessible for study. Some of the caves can reach temperatures of 25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit), and with light near the cave mouths, in some caves covered by thin overlying ice, the light may reach even deeper and is sufficient to sustain an ecosystem of flora and fauna consisting of moss, algae, arthropods and nematodes. 

They are dynamic systems that collapse and rebuild, but persist over decades. The air inside the caves has 80 to 100% humidity, and up to 3% carbon dioxide (CO2), and some carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2), but almost no methane (CH4) or hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Many of them are completely dark, so cannot support photosynthesis. Organics can only come from the atmosphere, or from ice algae that grow on the surface in summer, which may eventually find their way into the caves through burial and melting. As a result, most micro-organisms there are chemolithoautotrophic i.e. microbes that get all of their energy from chemical reactions with the rocks, and that do not depend on any other lifeforms to survive. The organisms survive using CO2 fixation and some may use CO oxidization for the metabolism. The main types of microbe found there are Chloroflexota and Acidobacteriota. In 2019, the Marsden Fund granted nearly NZ$1 million to the University of Waikato and the University of Canterbury to study the micro-organisms in the geothermal fumaroles.

==History==
===Discovery and naming===
Mount Erebus was discovered on 27 January 1841 (and observed to be in eruption), by polar explorer Sir James Clark Ross on his Antarctic expedition, who named it and its companion, Mount Terror, after his ships, HMS &quot;Erebus&quot; and HMS &quot;Terror&quot; (which were later used and lost by Sir John Franklin on his disastrous Arctic expedition). Present with Ross on HMS &quot;Erebus&quot; was the young Joseph Hooker, future president of the Royal Society and close friend of Charles Darwin. Erebus is a dark region in Hades in Greek mythology, personified as the Ancient Greek primordial deity of darkness, the son of Chaos.

===Historic sites===

The mountain was surveyed in December 1912 by a science party from Robert Falcon Scott&#x27;s &quot;Terra Nova&quot; expedition, who also collected geological samples. Two of the camp sites they used have been recognised for their historic significance:
* Upper “Summit Camp” site (HSM 89) consists of part of a circle of rocks, which were probably used to weight the tent valances.
* Lower “Camp E” site (HSM 90) consists of a slightly elevated area of gravel, as well as some aligned rocks, which may have been used to weight the tent valances.

They have been designated historic sites or monuments following a proposal by the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and the United States to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.

===Climbing===

Mount Erebus&#x27; summit crater rim was first achieved by members of Sir Ernest Shackleton&#x27;s party; Professor Edgeworth David, Sir Douglas Mawson, Dr Alister Mackay, Alex Lagasse, Jameson Adams, Dr Eric Marshall and Phillip Brocklehurst (who did not reach the summit), on March 10, 1908. The ascent was documented in the first chapter of Aurora Australis, the first book to be written and published in Antarctica. Its first known solo ascent and the first winter ascent was accomplished by British mountaineer Roger Mear on 7 June 1985, a member of the &quot;In the Footsteps of Scott&quot; expedition. On 19–20 January 1991, Charles J. Blackmer, an iron-worker for many years at McMurdo Station and the South Pole, accomplished a solo ascent in about 17 hours completely unsupported, by snow mobile and on foot.

===Robotic exploration===
In 1992, the inside of the volcano was explored by &quot;Dante I&quot;, an eight legged tethered robotic explorer. &quot;Dante&quot; was designed to acquire gas samples from the magma lake inside the inner crater of Mount Erebus to understand the chemistry better through the use of the on-board gas chromatograph, as well as measuring the temperature inside the volcano and the radioactivity of the materials present in such volcanoes. &quot;Dante&quot; successfully scaled a significant portion of the crater before technical difficulties emerged with the fibre-optic cable used for communications between the walker and base station. Since &quot;Dante&quot; had not yet reached the bottom of the crater, no data of volcanic significance was recorded. The expedition proved to be highly successful in terms of robotic and computer science, and was possibly the first expedition by a robotic platform to Antarctica.

===Air New Zealand Flight 901===
Air New Zealand Flight 901 was a scheduled sightseeing service from Auckland Airport in New Zealand to Antarctica and return with a scheduled stop at Christchurch Airport to refuel before returning to Auckland. The Air New Zealand flyover service, for the purposes of Antarctic sightseeing, was operated with McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 aircraft and began in February 1977. The flight crashed into Mount Erebus on November 28, 1979, killing all 257 people on board. Passenger photographs taken seconds before the collision ruled out the &quot;flying in a cloud&quot; theory, showing perfectly clear visibility well beneath the cloud base, with landmarks visible to the left and to the right of the aircraft. The mountain directly ahead was lit by sunlight shining from directly behind the aircraft through the cloud deck above, resulting in a lack of shadows that made Mount Erebus effectively invisible against the overcast sky beyond in a classic whiteout (more accurately, &quot;flat-light&quot;) phenomenon. Further investigation of the crash showed a navigational error in flight documentation by Air New Zealand and a cover-up that resulted in about $100 million in lawsuits. Air New Zealand discontinued its flyovers of Antarctica. Its final flight was on February 17, 1980. During the Antarctic summer, snow melt on the flanks of Mount Erebus continually reveals debris from the crash that is visible from the air.

==Craters==

===Main Crater ===
The topographic feature that rises to about high and forms the primary summit crater of Mount Erebus. 
Inner Crater, which lies within Main Crater, contains an anorthoclase-phonolite lava lake.

===Inner Crater===
The topographic feature that embraces the crater within the floor of Main Crater, at the summit of Mount Erebus. 
Inner Crater contains an active anorthoclase-phonolite lava lake. 
The name derives from the fact that the crater is within the Main Crater of Mount Erebus.

===Side Crater===

A nearly circular crater, about high, situated at the summit of Mount Erebus on the southwest crater rim. 
Named for its location on the side of the main summit cone of Mount Erebus.

===Western Crater===

A small circular crater at high on the western slope of the summit of Mount Erebus. 
So named for its location.

==Summit features==
Mount Erebus has several named features on its slopes, including a number of rock formations.
Features around the summit of the mountain include:

===Helo Cliffs===
Prominent cliffs at about high on the north rim of the summit caldera of Mount Erebus. The name derives from a nearby United States Coast Guard (USCG) HH-52A helicopter (CG 1404) which lost power and crashed while enroute from McMurdo Station to Cape Bird, Jan. 9, 1971. The four crew and passengers were not injured, but the helicopter was abandoned because of its location.

===Seismic Bluff===

Steep bluff at about high on the southwest rim of the summit caldera of Mount Erebus.
So named after a seismic station nearby.

===Tower Ridge===
A ridge at about high that descends the southwest slope of the summit crater of Mount Erebus. So named because the ridge is defined by a series of fumarolic ice towers.

===Camp Slope===
A concave slope, about high, just south of Crystal Slope on the west side of the summit cone of Mount Erebus. The feature is the site of a slump which has occurred off the crater rim. It is also a former camp site used by summit parties. A small hut is located on the upper part of the slope.

===Robot Gully===
A gully at about high on the northwest side of the summit crater of Mount Erebus. The feature was used as the access route from a NASA robot called Dante that was carried to the crater rim, Jan. 1, 1993.

===Crystal Slope===
A western slope, high, between Camp Slope and Robot Gully, leading down from the summit crater rim of Mount Erebus. So named because the slope includes a talus of large anorthoclase feldspar crystals.

===Nausea Knob===

A prominent outcropping of jumbled rocks, high, formed as a lava flow on the northwest upper slope of the active cone of Mount Erebus. 
The feature is near a camp site used mainly in the 1970s by teams working at the summit of the volcano. 
So named because many working at the camp suffered from nausea due to high elevation mountain sickness.

==Northern features==

Features on the northern slopes include:
===Abbott Peak===
Pyramidal peak on the north side of Mount Erebus,
between it and Mount Bird. Charted by the British Antarctic Expedition under Scott,
1910-13, and named for Petty Officer George P. Abbott, Royal Navy, a
member of the expedition.

===Krall Crags===
Two rock summits rising to over high on the northwest slope of Mount Erebus. The feature is west-northwest of Abbott Peak. At the suggestion of P.R. Kyle, named by Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) (2000) after Sarah Krall who worked over 10 years in providing support to science in Antarctica. She was cook and camp manager at the lower Erebus Hut during the 1992-93 NSF-NASA Dante robot experiment on Mount Erebus. She also managed the food room at McMurdo Station, was the hovercraft pilot, and has also been a helicopter technician.

===Tarr Nunatak===

A nunatak rising to about high on the northwest slope of Mount Erebus. 
The feature is south-southwest of Abbott Peak. 
Named by New Zealand Geographic Board (NZGB) (2000) after Sergeant L.W. (Wally) Tarr, Royal New Zealand Air Force, aircraft mechanic with the New Zealand contingent of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition (CTAE), 1956-58.

===Fang Ridge===
A conspicuous ridge on the northeast slope of Mount Erebus. 
It is a much denuded portion of the original caldera rim left by a catastrophic eruption. 
So named, probably for its curved shape, by Frank Debenham of the British Antarctic Expedition, 1910-13, who made a plane table survey in 1912.

=== The Fang===
A distinctive toothlike peak, high, which forms the highest point of Fang Ridge. 
Descriptively named by Frank Debenham of British Antarctic Expedition (British Antarctic Expedition), 1910-13, who made a plane table survey of the vicinity in 1912.

=== Millennium Peak===
A peak rising to about high on the northeast slope of Mount Erebus, east-northeast of the Erebus summit. 
So named by Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) in the millennium year 2000.

=== Coleman Peak===
A peak rising to about high on the northeast slope of Mount Erebus, east of the summit of Fang Ridge. Named by the New Zealand Geographic Board (NZGB) (2000) after Father Coleman, a New Zealand chaplain, who traveled to Antarctica many times with the United States Antarctic Program.

=== Te Puna Roimata Peak===
A peak about high, located west of Terra Nova Glacier and south of Lewis Bay on the lower northeast slope of Mount Erebus. On November 28, 1979, an Air New Zealand McDonnell Douglas DC-10 aircraft on a scenic flight from Auckland crashed near this peak claiming the lives of 237 passengers from eight countries and a crew of 20. In 1987, a stainless steel memorial cross was erected west of the peak. 
Te Puna Roimata Peak (meaning spring of tears) was named by the New Zealand Geographic Board (NZGB) in 2000.

==Southern features==
Features of the southern slopes of the mountain include:
===Hoopers Shoulder===
An independent cone at an elevation of high on the west slopes of Mount Erebus. From McMurdo Sound it appears as a perfect pyramid of black rock, standing out as a splendid mark against the background of the ice and almost on a line from Cape Royds to the crater of Mount Erebus. 
The cone itself is about high high and is surrounded by a deep moat or ditch, caused by the sweeping action of strong winds. 
It was named by F. Debenham on the second ascent of Mount Erebus for F.J. Hooper, a steward of the British Antarctic Expedition, 1910-13. 
Hooper was one of the party making the second ascent.

===Cashman Crags===

Two rock summits at about high on the west slope of Mount Erebus. 
The feature is southwest of Hoopers Shoulder. 
At the suggestion of P.R. Kyle, named by United States Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) (2000) after Katherine V. Cashman, United States Antarctic Research Program (USARP) team member on Mount Erebus in 1978-79 while a Fulbright scholar at Victoria University of Wellington; worked again on Mount Erebus, 1988-89; later Professor of Geology, University of Oregon.

===Williams Cliff===
A prominent rock cliff that stands out from the ice-covered southwest slopes of Mount Erebus, situated east of Cape Barne. 
This rock cliff was mapped by the British Antarctic Expedition under Scott, 1910-13, and identified simply as &quot;Bold Cliff on maps resulting from that expedition. 
It was named Williams Cliff by the US-ACAN in 1964 to commemorate Richard T. Williams, who lost his life when his tractor broke through the ice at McMurdo Sound in January 1956. 

===Tech Crags===
A narrow broken ridge south of Williams Cliff on Ross Island. The feature rises to about high and marks a declivity along the north flank of broad Turks Head Ridge, from which ice moves to Pukaru Icefalls. Named by US-ACAN (2000) after the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, known as New Mexico Tech. From 1981, many Tech students under the direction of Philip R. Kyle, have undertaken graduate research projects (thesis and dissertation) on Mount Erebus.

===Three Sisters Cones===
Three aligned cones at an elevation of about high on the southwest slopes of Mount Erebus. 
Named by members of the British Antarctic Expedition, 1910-13, under Scott.
===Turks Head Ridge===
A mostly ice-covered ridge extending from Turks Head for a few miles up the slopes of Mount Erebus. 
Mapped by the British Antarctic Expedition, 1910-13, under Scott and so named because of its association with Turks Head.

===Esser Bluff===
A rock bluff rising to about high on the southeast margin of Turks Head Ridge. The bluff is east-northeast of Grazyna Bluff. At the suggestion of P.R. Kyle, named by US-ACAN (2000) after Richard Esser, a member of New Mexico Tech field parties on Mount Erebus in the 1993-94 and 1994-95 seasons; later a technician in the New Mexico Geochronology Lab at NM Tech, where he has dated many rocks from Antarctica.

===Grazyna Bluff===
A rock bluff rising to about high in the south part of Turks Head Ridge. 
The bluff is north-northeast of Turks Head. 
At the suggestion of P.R. Kyle, named by US-ACAN (2000) after Grazyna Zreda-Gostynska, who worked on Mount Erebus in 1989-90 as a member of the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology team. A Ph.D. student at NMIMT, she completed her doctoral dissertation on the gas emissions from Mount Erebus.

===Glacier Ridge===
A broad north–south ridge, long and wide, on the south slopes of Mount Erebus. Completely ice covered, the ridge descends from about high to high, terminating northwest of Tyree Head. 
In association with the names of expedition ships grouped on this island, named after United States Coast Guard Cutter (USCGC) &quot;Glacier&quot;, an icebreaker which for three decades, 1955-56 to 1986-87, supported scientific activity in Antarctica and Ross Sea on virtually an annual basis. 
From 1955-56, &quot;Glacier&quot; operated as a US Navy ship. 
Along with other Navy icebreakers, Glacier was transferred to the US Coast Guard fleet, June 1966, from which she operated until decommissioned, June 1987.

<doc id="161707" wikidata="Q2735373" url="?curid=161707" title="Ah Via Musicom">
<text>Ah Via Musicom is the second studio album by guitarist Eric Johnson, released in 1990 through Capitol Records. The album reached No. 67 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and remained on that chart for 60 weeks. All four singles charted on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Mainstream Rock chart, with three of them being top 10 hits: &quot;High Landrons&quot; at No. 31, &quot;Righteous&quot; at No. 8, &quot;Cliffs of Dover&quot; at No. 5 and &quot;Trademark&quot; at No. 7. &quot;Cliffs of Dover&quot; went on to win the Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance at the 1992 Grammys.

==Overview==
Several songs are dedicated to fellow guitarists: Johnson stated in a March 1990 interview with &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine that &quot;Steve&#x27;s Boogie&quot; is dedicated to Austin-based pedal steel guitarist Steve Hennig, while &quot;Song for George&quot; is dedicated to an 80-year-old guitarist friend of his named George Washington. Furthermore, &quot;East Wes&quot; is dedicated to jazz guitarist Wes Montgomery, and takes its name from the 1966 album &quot;East-West&quot; by The Paul Butterfield Blues Band.

A DVD-Audio edition of &quot;Ah Via Musicom&quot; was released in 2002 through Capitol Records, but without Johnson&#x27;s input. After he expressed disappointment in the sound quality and mixing, it was soon withdrawn by the label after 2500 copies were sold. In an August 2005 issue of &quot;Guitar Player&quot;, he confirmed that an authorized 5.1 DVD-Audio edition of the album was in the works, but as of 2022 it has not been released.

==Critical reception==
Robert Taylor at AllMusic gave &quot;Ah Via Musicom&quot; 4.5 stars out of 5, saying that it has &quot;reached near-classic proportions within the guitar community&quot; and highlighting the varied styles present, namely rock, pop, blues, country and jazz. Praise was given to Johnson for his &quot;excellent chops and a clear tone&quot; as well as his singing, which was described as &quot;not quite as interesting as his guitar playing&quot;, but also for being &quot;not obtrusive and ... at times quite pleasing&quot;.

&quot;Cliffs of Dover&quot; has endured as Johnson&#x27;s best-known song and is a mainstay at his concerts. It was ranked No. 17 in a list of &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Solos&quot; by &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine, No. 34 in a list of &quot;50 greatest guitar tones of all time&quot; by &quot;Guitarist&quot; magazine, and remains a highly regarded staple within the guitar community.

<text>An endangered language or moribund language is a language that is at risk of disappearing as its speakers die out or shift to speaking other languages. Language loss occurs when the language has no more native speakers and becomes a &quot;dead language&quot;. If no one can speak the language at all, it becomes an &quot;extinct language&quot;. A dead language may still be studied through recordings or writings, but it is still dead or extinct unless there are fluent speakers. Although languages have always become extinct throughout human history, they are currently dying at an accelerated rate because of globalization, mass migration, cultural replacement, imperialism, neocolonialism and linguicide (language killing).

Language shift most commonly occurs when speakers switch to a language associated with social or economic power or one spoken more widely, leading to the gradual decline and eventual death of the endangered language. The process of language shift is often influenced by factors such as globalisation, economic authorities, and the perceived prestige of certain languages. The ultimate result is the loss of linguistic diversity and cultural heritage within affected communities. The general consensus is that there are between 6,000 and 7,000 languages currently spoken. Some linguists estimate that between 50% and 90% of them will be severely endangered or dead by the year 2100. The 20 most common languages, each with more than 50 million speakers, are spoken by 50% of the world&#x27;s population, but most languages are spoken by fewer than 10,000 people.

The first step towards language death is &quot;potential endangerment&quot;. This is when a language faces strong external pressure, but there are still communities of speakers who pass the language to their children. The second stage is &quot;endangerment&quot;. Once a language has reached the endangerment stage, there are only a few speakers left and children are, for the most part, not learning the language. The third stage of language extinction is &quot;seriously endangered&quot;. During this stage, a language is unlikely to survive another generation and will soon be extinct. The fourth stage is &quot;moribund&quot;, followed by the fifth stage &quot;extinction&quot;.

Many projects are under way aimed at preventing or slowing language loss by revitalizing endangered languages and promoting education and literacy in minority languages, often involving joint projects between language communities and linguists. Across the world, many countries have enacted specific legislation aimed at protecting and stabilizing the language of indigenous speech communities. Recognizing that most of the world&#x27;s endangered languages are unlikely to be revitalized, many linguists are also working on documenting the thousands of languages of the world about which little or nothing is known.
Some widely spoken languages have endangered regional dialects, such as the varieties of English spoken on the American east coast, such as Eastern New England English.

==Number of languages==
The total number of contemporary languages in the world is not known, and it is not well defined what constitutes a separate language as opposed to a dialect. Estimates vary depending on the extent and means of the research undertaken, and the definition of a distinct language and the current state of knowledge of remote and isolated language communities. The number of known languages varies over time as some of them become extinct and others are newly discovered. An accurate number of languages in the world was not yet known until the use of universal, systematic surveys in the later half of the twentieth century. The majority of linguists in the early twentieth century refrained from making estimates. Before then, estimates were frequently the product of guesswork and very low.

One of the most active research agencies is SIL International, which maintains a database, Ethnologue, kept up to date by the contributions of linguists globally.

Ethnologue&#x27;s 2005 count of languages in its database, excluding duplicates in different countries, was 6,912, of which 32.8% (2,269) were in Asia, and 30.3% (2,092) in Africa. This contemporary tally must be regarded as a variable number within a range. Areas with a particularly large number of languages that are nearing extinction include: Eastern Siberia, Central Siberia, Northern Australia, Central America, and the Northwest Pacific Plateau. Other hotspots are Oklahoma and the Southern Cone of South America.

===Endangered sign languages===
Almost all of the study of language endangerment has been with spoken languages. A UNESCO study of endangered languages does not mention sign languages. However, some sign languages are also endangered, such as Alipur Village Sign Language (AVSL) of India, Adamorobe Sign Language of Ghana, Ban Khor Sign Language of Thailand, and Plains Indian Sign Language. Many sign languages are used by small communities; small changes in their environment (such as contact with a larger sign language or dispersal of the deaf community) can lead to the endangerment and loss of their traditional sign language. Methods are being developed to assess the vitality of sign languages.

==Defining and measuring endangerment==

While there is no definite threshold for identifying a language as endangered, UNESCO&#x27;s 2003 document entitled &quot;Language vitality and endangerment&quot; outlines nine factors for determining language vitality:
# Intergenerational language transmission
# Absolute number of speakers
# Proportion of speakers existing within the total (global) population
# Language use within existing contexts and domains
# Response to language use in new domains and media
# Availability of materials for language education and literacy
# Government and institutional language policies
# Community attitudes toward their language
# Amount and quality of documentation
Many languages, for example some in Indonesia, have tens of thousands of speakers but are endangered because children are no longer learning them, and speakers are shifting to using the national language (e.g. Indonesian) in place of local languages. In contrast, a language with only 500 speakers might be considered very much alive if it is the primary language of a community, and is the first (or only) spoken language of all children in that community.

Asserting that &quot;Language diversity is essential to the human heritage&quot;, UNESCO&#x27;s Ad Hoc Expert Group on Endangered Languages offers this definition of an endangered language: &quot;... when its speakers cease to use it, use it in an increasingly reduced number of communicative domains, and cease to pass it on from one generation to the next. That is, there are no new speakers, adults or children.&quot;

UNESCO operates with four levels of language endangerment between &quot;safe&quot; (not endangered) and &quot;extinct&quot; (no living speakers), based on intergenerational transfer: &quot;vulnerable&quot; (not spoken by children outside the home), &quot;definitely endangered&quot; (children not speaking), &quot;severely endangered&quot; (only spoken by the oldest generations), and &quot;critically endangered&quot; (spoken by few members of the oldest generation, often semi-speakers).
UNESCO&#x27;s &quot;Atlas of the World&#x27;s Languages in Danger&quot; categorises 2,473 languages by level of endangerment.

Using an alternative scheme of classification, linguist Michael E. Krauss defines languages as &quot;safe&quot; if it is considered that children will probably be speaking them in 100 years; &quot;endangered&quot; if children will probably not be speaking them in 100 years (approximately 60–80% of languages fall into this category) and &quot;moribund&quot; if children are not speaking them now.

Many scholars have devised techniques for determining whether languages are endangered. One of the earliest is GIDS (Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale) proposed by Joshua Fishman in 1991. In 2011 an entire issue of &quot;Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development&quot; was devoted to the study of ethnolinguistic vitality, Vol. 32.2, 2011, with several authors presenting their own tools for measuring language vitality. A number of other published works on measuring language vitality have been published, prepared by authors with varying situations and applications in mind.

==Causes==
According to the &quot;Cambridge Handbook of Endangered Languages&quot;, there are four main types of causes of language endangerment:

Causes that put the populations that speak the languages in physical danger, such as:
# War and genocide. Examples of this are the languages of the native population of Tasmania who died from diseases, and many extinct and endangered languages of the Americas where indigenous peoples have been subjected to genocidal violence. The Miskito language in Nicaragua and the Mayan languages of Guatemala have been affected by civil war. 
# Natural disasters, famine, disease. Any natural disaster severe enough to wipe out an entire population of native language speakers has the capability of endangering a language. An example of this is the languages spoken by the people of the Andaman Islands, who were seriously affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami.

Causes that prevent or discourage speakers from using a language, such as:
# Cultural, political, or economic marginalization creates a strong incentive for individuals to abandon their language (on behalf of themselves and their children as well) in favor of another more prestigious language; one example of this is assimilatory education. This frequently happens when indigenous populations and ethnic groups who were once subjected to colonisation and/or earlier conquest, in order to achieve a higher social status, have a better chance to get employment and/or acceptance in a given social network only when they adopt the cultural and linguistic traits of other groups with enough power imbalance to culturally integrate them, through various means of ingroup and outgroup coercion (see below); examples of this kind of endangerment are the cases of Welsh, Scottish Gaelic, and Scots in Great Britain, Irish in Ireland, the Sardinian language in Italy, the Ryukyuan and Ainu languages in Japan, and the Chamorro language in Guam. This is also the most common cause of language endangerment. Ever since the Indian government adopted Hindi as the official language of the union government, Hindi has taken over many languages in India. Other forms of cultural imperialism include religion and technology; religious groups may hold the belief that the use of a certain language is immoral or require its followers to speak one language that is the approved language of the religion (like the Arabic language as the language of the Quran, with the pressure for many North African groups of Amazigh or Egyptian descent to Arabize). There are also cases where cultural hegemony may often arise not from an earlier history of domination or conquest, but simply from increasing contact with larger and more influential communities through better communications, compared with the relative isolation of past centuries.
# Political repression. This has frequently happened when nation-states, as they work to promote a single national culture, limit the opportunities for using minority languages in the public sphere, schools, the media, and elsewhere, sometimes even prohibiting them altogether. Sometimes ethnic groups are forcibly resettled, or children may be removed to be schooled away from home, or otherwise have their chances of cultural and linguistic continuity disrupted. This has happened in the case of many Native American, Louisiana French and Australian languages, as well as European and Asian minority languages such as Breton, Occitan, or Alsatian in France and Kurdish in Turkey.
# Urbanization. The movement of people into urban areas can force people to learn the language of their new environment. Eventually, later generations will lose the ability to speak their native language, leading to endangerment. Once urbanization takes place, new families who live there will be under pressure to speak the lingua franca of the city. 
# Intermarriage can also cause language endangerment, as there will always be pressure to speak one language to each other. This may lead to children only speaking the more common language spoken between the married couple.

Often multiple of these causes act at the same time. Poverty, disease and disasters often affect minority groups disproportionately, for example causing the dispersal of speaker populations and decreased survival rates for those who stay behind.

===Marginalization and endangerment===
Among the causes of language endangerment cultural, political and economic marginalization accounts for most of the world&#x27;s language endangerment. Scholars distinguish between several types of marginalization: Economic dominance negatively affects minority languages when poverty leads people to migrate towards the cities or to other countries, thus dispersing the speakers. Cultural dominance occurs when literature and higher education is only accessible in the majority language. Political dominance occurs when education and political activity is carried out exclusively in a majority language.

Historically, in colonies, and elsewhere where speakers of different languages have come into contact, some languages have been considered superior to others: often one language has attained a dominant position in a country. Speakers of endangered languages may themselves come to associate their language with negative values such as poverty, illiteracy and social stigma, causing them to wish to adopt the dominant language that is associated with social and economical progress and modernity. Immigrants moving into an area may lead to the endangerment of the autochthonous language.

Dialects and accents have seen similar levels of endangerment during the 21st century due to similar reasons.

==Effects==
Language endangerment affects both the languages themselves and the people that speak them. This also affects the essence of a culture. 

===Effects on communities===
As communities lose their language, they often lose parts of their cultural traditions that are tied to that language. Examples include songs, myths, poetry, local remedies, ecological and geological knowledge, as well as language behaviors that are not easily translated. Furthermore, the social structure of one&#x27;s community is often reflected through speech and language behavior. This pattern is even more prominent in dialects. This may in turn affect the sense of identity of the individual and the community as a whole, producing a weakened social cohesion as their values and traditions are replaced with new ones. This is sometimes characterized as anomie. Losing a language may also have political consequences as some countries confer different political statuses or privileges on minority ethnic groups, often defining ethnicity in terms of language. In turn, communities that lose their language may also lose political legitimacy as a community with special collective rights. Language can also be considered as scientific knowledge in topics such as medicine, philosophy, botany, and more. It reflects a community&#x27;s practices when dealing with the environment and each other. When a language is lost, this knowledge is often lost as well.

In contrast, language revitalization is correlated with better health outcomes in indigenous communities.

===Effects on languages===
During language loss—sometimes referred to as &quot;obsolescence&quot; in the linguistic literature—the language that is being lost generally undergoes changes as speakers make their language more similar to the language that they are shifting to. For example, gradually losing grammatical or phonological complexities that are not found in the dominant language.

===Ethical considerations and attitudes===
Generally the accelerated pace of language endangerment is considered to be a problem by linguists and by the speakers. However, some linguists, such as the phonetician Peter Ladefoged, have argued that language death is a natural part of the process of human cultural development, and that languages die because communities stop speaking them for their own reasons. Ladefoged argued that linguists should simply document and describe languages scientifically, but not seek to interfere with the processes of language loss. A similar view has been argued at length by linguist Salikoko Mufwene, who sees the cycles of language death and emergence of new languages through creolization as a continuous ongoing process.

A majority of linguists do consider that language loss is an ethical problem, as they consider that most communities would prefer to maintain their languages if given a real choice. They also consider it a scientific problem, because language loss on the scale currently taking place will mean that future linguists will only have access to a fraction of the world&#x27;s linguistic diversity, therefore their picture of what human language is—and can be—will be limited.

Some linguists consider linguistic diversity to be analogous to biological diversity, and compare language endangerment to wildlife endangerment.

== Response ==
Linguists, members of endangered language communities, governments, nongovernmental organizations, and international organizations such as UNESCO and the European Union are actively working to save and stabilize endangered languages. Once a language is determined to be endangered, there are three steps that can be taken in order to stabilize or rescue the language. The first is language documentation, the second is language revitalization and the third is language maintenance.

Language documentation is the documentation in writing and audio-visual recording of grammar, vocabulary, and oral traditions (e.g. stories, songs, religious texts) of endangered languages. It entails producing descriptive grammars, collections of texts and dictionaries of the languages, and it requires the establishment of a secure archive where the material can be stored once it is produced so that it can be accessed by future generations of speakers or scientists.

Language revitalization is the process by which a language community through political, community, and educational means attempts to increase the number of active speakers of the endangered language. This process is also sometimes referred to as language revival or reversing language shift. For case studies of this process, see Anderson (2014). Applied linguistics and education are helpful in revitalizing endangered languages. Vocabulary and courses are available online for a number of endangered languages.

Language maintenance refers to the support given to languages that need for their survival to be protected from outsiders who can ultimately affect the number of speakers of a language. UNESCO seeks to prevent language extinction by promoting and supporting the language in education, culture, communication and information, and science.

Another option is &quot;post-vernacular maintenance&quot;: the teaching of some words and concepts of the lost language, rather than revival proper.

As of June 2012 the United States has a J-1 specialist visa, which allows indigenous language experts who do not have academic training to enter the U.S. as experts aiming to share their knowledge and expand their skills.

<text>In logic and mathematics, a truth value, sometimes called a logical value, is a value indicating the relation of a proposition to truth, which in classical logic has only two possible values (&quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;). Truth values are used in computing as well as various types of logic.

== Computing ==

In some programming languages, any expression can be evaluated in a context that expects a Boolean data type. Typically (though this varies by programming language) expressions like the number zero, the empty string, empty lists, and null are treated as false, and strings with content (like &quot;abc&quot;), other numbers, and objects evaluate to true. Sometimes these classes of expressions are called falsy and truthy. For example, in Lisp, nil, the empty list, is treated as false, and all other values are treated as true. In C, the number 0 or 0.0 is false, and all other values are treated as true. 

In JavaScript, the empty string (codice_1), codice_2, codice_3, codice_4, +0, −0 and codice_5 are sometimes called &quot;falsy&quot; (of which the complement is &quot;truthy&quot;) to distinguish between strictly type-checked and coerced Booleans (see also: JavaScript syntax#Type conversion). As opposed to Python, empty containers (Arrays, Maps, Sets) are considered truthy. Languages such as PHP also use this approach.

== Classical logic ==

In classical logic, with its intended semantics, the truth values are &quot;true&quot; (denoted by &quot;1&quot; or the verum ⊤), and &quot;untrue&quot; or &quot;false&quot; (denoted by &quot;0&quot; or the falsum ⊥); that is, classical logic is a two-valued logic. This set of two values is also called the Boolean domain. Corresponding semantics of logical connectives are truth functions, whose values are expressed in the form of truth tables. Logical biconditional becomes the equality binary relation, and negation becomes a bijection which permutes true and false. Conjunction and disjunction are dual with respect to negation, which is expressed by De Morgan&#x27;s laws:
: ¬(

Propositional variables become variables in the Boolean domain. Assigning values for propositional variables is referred to as valuation.
== Intuitionistic and constructive logic ==
Whereas in classical logic truth values form a Boolean algebra, in intuitionistic logic, and more generally, constructive mathematics, the truth values form a Heyting algebra. Such truth values may express various aspects of validity, including locality, temporality, or computational content.

For example, one may use the open sets
of a topological space as intuitionistic truth values, in which case the truth value of a formula expresses &quot;where&quot; the formula holds, not whether it holds.

In realizability truth values are sets of programs, which can be understood as computational evidence of validity of a formula. For example, the truth value of the statement &quot;for every number there is a prime larger than it&quot; is the set of all programs that take as input a number formula_1, and output a prime larger than formula_1.

In category theory, truth values appear as the elements of the subobject classifier. In particular, in a topos every formula of higher-order logic may be assigned a truth value in the subobject classifier.

Even though a Heyting algebra may have many elements, this should not be understood as there being truth values that are neither true nor false, because intuitionistic logic proves formula_3 (&quot;it is not the case that formula_4 is neither true nor false&quot;).

In intuitionistic type theory, the Curry-Howard correspondence exhibits an equivalence of propositions and types, according to which validity is equivalent to inhabitation of a type.

For other notions of intuitionistic truth values, see the Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation and .

== Multi-valued logic ==
Multi-valued logics (such as fuzzy logic and relevance logic) allow for more than two truth values, possibly containing some internal structure. For example, on the unit interval such structure is a total order; this may be expressed as the existence of various degrees of truth.

== Algebraic semantics ==

Not all logical systems are truth-valuational in the sense that logical connectives may be interpreted as truth functions. For example, intuitionistic logic lacks a complete set of truth values because its semantics, the Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation, is specified in terms of provability conditions, and not directly in terms of the necessary truth of formulae.

But even non-truth-valuational logics can associate values with logical formulae, as is done in algebraic semantics. The algebraic semantics of intuitionistic logic is given in terms of Heyting algebras, compared to Boolean algebra semantics of classical propositional calculus.

<text>The Doctrine of Chances was the first textbook on probability theory, written by 18th-century French mathematician Abraham de Moivre and first published in 1718. De Moivre wrote in English because he resided in England at the time, having fled France to escape the persecution of Huguenots. The book&#x27;s title came to be synonymous with &quot;probability theory&quot;, and accordingly the phrase was used in Thomas Bayes&#x27; famous posthumous paper &quot;An Essay Towards Solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances&quot;, wherein a version of Bayes&#x27; theorem was first introduced.

==Editions==
The full title of the first edition was &quot;The Doctrine of Chances: or, A Method of Calculating the Probability of Events in Play&quot;. It was published in 1718, by W. Pearson, and ran for 175 pages.
Published in 1738 by Woodfall and running for 258 pages, the second edition of de Moivre&#x27;s book introduced the concept of normal distributions as approximations to binomial distributions. In effect de Moivre proved a special case of the central limit theorem. Sometimes his result is called the theorem of de Moivre–Laplace.
A third edition was published posthumously in 1756 by A. Millar, and ran for 348 pages; additional material in this edition included an application of probability theory to actuarial science in the calculation of annuities.

<text>Western Michigan University (Western Michigan, Western or WMU) is a public research university in Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States. It was initially established as Western State Normal School in 1903 by Governor Aaron T. Bliss for the training of teachers. It was renamed Western Michigan University in 1957.

Western is one of the eight research universities in the state of Michigan and is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;. The university has seven degree-granting colleges, offering 147 undergraduate degree programs, 73 master&#x27;s degree programs, 30 doctoral programs, and 1 specialist degree program. It is governed by an eight-member board of regents whose members are appointed by the governor of Michigan and confirmed by the Michigan Senate for eight-year terms.

The university&#x27;s athletic teams compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and are known as the Western Michigan Broncos. They compete in the Mid-American Conference for most sports.

==History==

On May 27, 1903, Michigan Governor Aaron T. Bliss signed a bill authorizing the creation of a teacher-training facility. Kalamazoo was chosen as the new school&#x27;s location on August 28, 1903. Other locations considered included Allegan, Muskegon, Grand Rapids, Decatur, Three Oaks, and Hastings. The first building, then known as the Administration Building, and now known as Heritage Hall, was constructed in 1904.

The university was first officially known as Western State Normal School and offered a two-year training program. The first principal was Dwight B. Waldo, who served from 1904 until 1936. The school was renamed several times throughout its early history, beginning with Western State Teachers College in 1927, Western Michigan College of Education in 1941, and Western Michigan College in 1955. It was renamed Western Michigan University in 1957.

Most of the oldest and original WMU buildings are collectively known as East Campus. Because of the steep grade elevating the campus above the city, the Western State Normal Railroad was established in 1907 to carry students and staff up and down the hill with a funicular. It operated until 1949.

Western Michigan University had a partnership with Cooley Law School for over a decade, that on August 13, 2014, culminated in the adoption of a new name and partnership, the Western Michigan University Cooley Law School. In 2020, the university&#x27;s Board of Trustees voted to end its affiliation with the Cooley Law School.

Western Michigan University was negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. President Edward B. Montgomery stated &quot;the crisis has already cost WMU well over $45 million, and we expect the tally to rise through the remainder of this fiscal year.&quot; To soften the economic toll of the pandemic, WMU instituted a number of cost-cutting measures.

===Presidents===
* Dwight B. Waldo (1904–1936)
* Paul V. Sangren (1936–1960)
* James W. Miller (1961–1974)
* John T. Bernhard (1974–1985)
* Diether H. Haenicke (1985–1998)
* Elson S. Floyd (1998–2003)
* Judith I. Bailey (2003–2006)
* John M. Dunn (2007–2017)

==Campus==
WMU&#x27;s campuses encompass more than and roughly 150 buildings. Western Michigan University is divided into five campuses in and near Kalamazoo, Michigan:
* West Campus
* East Campus
* Oakland Drive Campus
* Parkview Campus
* College of Aviation in Battle Creek, Michigan

===West Campus===
West Campus is the primary and largest WMU campus in Kalamazoo, and is usually referred to as &quot;Main Campus.&quot; Most of the university academic and administrative buildings are on West Campus, including the College of Arts and Sciences, Haworth College of Business, College of Education and Human Development, College of Fine Arts, the Lee Honors College and Waldo Library. Many of the residence halls are found scattered throughout West Campus, while other dormitories (affectionately referred to as &quot;The Valleys&quot;) are adjacent to West Campus in Goldsworth Valley. Waldo Library is the fourth largest university library system in Michigan, where it houses millions of various resources such as books, audio/visual materials, maps, electronic resources and more. The library also has a cafe, student commons, study rooms, and a virtual reality lab.

The WMU Student Center opened in 2023 and contains a dining center, restaurants, a bank, the campus bookstore, student organization center and other student services.

West Campus is also the site of Miller Auditorium, a large entertainment venue seating nearly 3500 people. It is Michigan&#x27;s fourth largest auditorium. Miller Auditorium hosts events ranging from popular musicals and concerts to graduation commencements and film screenings. The Gilmore Theater Complex, featuring three performance stages and faculty offices, is directly next to Miller Auditorium. The Dalton Center houses the School of Music and Department of Dance. The Richmond Center for Visual Arts was added to the Fine Arts Complex in 2007, followed by South Kohrman Hall being renovated into faculty offices and upgraded studio spaces in 2008. Both buildings house the Gwen Frostic School of Art.

===East Campus===

East Campus is the original development dating from the university&#x27;s founding in 1903. It contains many of the university&#x27;s historical buildings including, East Hall, West Hall, North Hall, Walwood Hall, Spindler Hall, Vandercook Hall, and The Little Theater. Many of these buildings are on a hill overlooking the city of Kalamazoo. Walwood Hall, renovated in 1992, is home to the Graduate College, the Graduate Student Advisory Committee, the Medieval Institute, the WMU Office of Research and Innovation, the Southwest Michigan Small Business Development Center, and several other academic and administrative offices.

In December 2012, WMU announced plans to renovate its birthplace, historic East Hall, for use as an alumni center. It also announced plans to demolish several of the university&#x27;s original historic buildings and utilize the hilltop as green space.

In August 2013 West Hall and the Speech and Hearing building on WMU&#x27;s East Campus were demolished. The original portion of East Hall was retained, but North Hall and the two side wings of East Hall came down. East Hall reopened in 2015 as Heritage Hall, home to the WMU Alumni Center. In addition to the renovation of East Hall, the portico of North Hall was preserved and positioned just north of East Hall.

===Oakland Drive Campus===
The Oakland Drive campus is home to the university&#x27;s College of Health and Human Services and the WMU Army ROTC program. It is also home to the Western Michigan University Archives and Regional History Collections, located in the Charles C. and Lynn L. Zhang Legacy Collections Center. In 2021, the University Libraries announced that Special Collections would be moving from Waldo Library to the Zhang Center.

===Parkview Campus===
The Parkview Campus is home to the university&#x27;s College of Engineering and Applied Sciences and is within the Business Technology and Research Park. Erected in 2003, the $72.5 million building Floyd Hall is and features two three-story wings connected by a middle glass enclosure. The campus is about southwest of the main campus.

The campus contains the paper coating plant. The school offers 17 undergraduate engineering, technology and applied sciences programs, while the graduate level, the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences offers 9 master programs, and 6 doctoral programs.

===College of Aviation===
The College of Aviation offers three undergraduate aviation majors in Battle Creek, Michigan.

The College of Aviation runs a Cirrus SR-20 fleet, turbine engine testing sites, and aviation maintenance training facilities. Additionally the College of Aviation has a fleet of Piper PA-44 Seminole, one Piper PA-18 Super Cub, and one American Champion Super Decathlon used for flight training. The facility is in Battle Creek, Michigan at W. K. Kellogg Airport.

Because the demand for training was high, the city of Battle Creek and the Air National Guard, in conjunction with the College of Aviation, constructed a new runway just to the west of the original runway 23 and parallel to it. This caused Battle Creek&#x27;s main runway to be renamed runway 23R and the new runway 23L. The project&#x27;s cost was around $7 million, 95% of the money coming from the government. The runway is now fully &quot;operational&quot;.

From August 2017 to August 2019, Western Michigan University operated a satellite campus in Punta Gorda, Florida near the Punta Gorda Airport with additional facilities being located on the airfield. WMU planned to build a new building on the north side of the airport to consolidate the aviation classes at the airport. Western Michigan University offered aviation and music therapy programs in Punta Gorda and used Florida SouthWestern State College&#x27;s campus. It was announced in February 2019 that WMU Punta Gorda would close due to low enrollment numbers.

===Regional sites===
Western Michigan University also has several regional sites that offer education to more than 6,000 students each year. These regional sites are in cities throughout Michigan:
* Battle Creek
* Benton Harbor
* Grand Rapids
* Metro Detroit

==Academics==

The college is in Schneider Hall on the main campus. The College of Business was renamed in honor of alumnus G. W. Haworth after Haworth gave a large donation in the 1980s.

===Medical school===
Western Michigan began planning a medical school in 2008, named Western Michigan University Homer Stryker M.D. School of Medicine, which admitted its first class in August 2014. Privately funded and created in partnership with Borgess Medical Center and Bronson Methodist Hospital, the school was seeded by a $100 million cash donation from Dr. Homer Stryker&#x27;s granddaughter, Ronda Stryker, and her husband William Johnston, a WMU trustee – the largest cash gift ever given to a college or university in Michigan. At the time it was the 15th largest cash gift ever given to any public university in the nation.

===Law school===
In 2001, WMU and the Thomas M. Cooley Law School entered into a partnership where students could obtain a Master in Public Administration from WMU while simultaneously working on a Juris Doctor degree from Cooley. In 2008, WMU and Cooley expanded this partnership so now WMU students enrolled in both MPA and Masters in Business Administration programs at WMU may simultaneously work on obtaining a Juris Doctor degree from Cooley Law School at Western Michigan University. The university ended its affiliation with the Cooley Law School in 2020. The law school closed its campus in Kalamazoo, Michigan in 2020.

==Student life==
=== Entertainment ===
The Campus Activities Board is the main student organization responsible for bringing entertainment events for students. The organization sponsors concerts, comedians, films, and special events.

=== Student government ===
The Western Student Association (WSA) along with the Graduate Student Association (GSA) are the &quot;primary&quot; body of student government at Western Michigan University.

=== Social groups ===
WMU sponsors or recognizes several groups aimed towards personal and social development. This includes faith and spiritual development, the Office of LBGT Student Services, Greek Life, services for International Students, Multicultural Affairs, Off-Campus Life, and Sponsored Student Organizations. WMU also has around 400 student organizations registered through the university that are available to any student.

=== Student activism ===
Placement of the Chemistry Building generated much controversy from student groups because it displaced a large portion of greenery in the center of West Campus. A temporary outdoor plaza was constructed outside of Sangren Hall in 2007 to replace the greenery. However, this also generated controversy and protests among students and faculty because of its aesthetic characteristics and costs. One such protest by a student group involved requesting the financial records of the construction and using chalk to depict the costs of each item on the plaza.

=== Student newspaper ===
The &quot;Western Herald&quot; is the school&#x27;s student newspaper. It began printing in 1916 and was known as the &quot;Western Normal Herald&quot; until 1927. The paper provides news about the students, campus events and activities, as well as sporting events, opinion sections, and local culture and politics. The &quot;Western Herald&quot; maintains a staff of approximately about 40 students. It is the oldest registered student organization at Western Michigan University.

=== Fraternities and sororities ===
There are 32 Greek Life chapters, each having its own unique values and mission; including the
Divine Nine which are the 9 historically black Greek organizations, along with honors,
academic, service, and social chapters at WMU.

The Western Michigan Broncos main rival is the Central Michigan Chippewas who also compete in the Mid-American Conference.

The Broncos have won two NCAA national championships. The cross country team won the NCAA title in 1964 and 1965.

==School songs==
The current alma mater, Brown and Gold, and the current WMU fight song are the result of a 1959 contest to replace existing songs. Open to the university community, the two-stage contest first solicited lyrics and then music. Alumnus James H. Bull won the lyrics stage with his entry for Brown and Gold.

<text>Eastern Michigan University (EMU, EMich, Eastern Michigan or simply Eastern) is a public research university in Ypsilanti, Michigan, United States. Founded in 1849 as the Michigan State Normal School, it was the fourth normal school (teachers&#x27; college) established in the United States and the first outside New England. In 1899, the Michigan State Normal School became the first normal school in the nation to offer a four-year curriculum; the college became a university in 1959.

EMU is one of the eight research universities in the state of Michigan and is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;. It is governed by an eight-member board of regents whose members are appointed by the governor of Michigan and confirmed by the Michigan Senate for eight-year terms.

The university comprises eight colleges and schools: College of Arts and Sciences, College of Business, College of Education, College of Health and Human Services, GameAbove College of Engineering and Technology, School of Music &amp; Dance, the Honors College, and the Graduate School. The university is composed of an academic and athletic campus spread across , with over 120 buildings. As of 2023, EMU&#x27;s total enrollment is over 13,000 students. EMU has experienced a steady yearly decrease in total fall enrollment; in the fall of 1990, total enrollment was 25,954 students.

In 1991, Eastern Michigan&#x27;s athletic teams started competing as the Eastern Michigan Eagles and the school mascot, Swoop, was officially adopted by the university three years later in 1994. The Eagles compete in the NCAA Division I Mid-American Conference. EMU Athletics utilizes Rynearson Stadium for its football games, Oestrike Stadium for its baseball games, and the multipurpose George Gervin GameAbove Center for its basketball games.

==History==


Influenced by similar academies in Europe, the Michigan Legislature founded the Michigan State Normal School in 1849 with its campus in Ypsilanti. There was a significant contest among municipalities across Michigan to become the home of the state&#x27;s first normal school. These other contending villages and towns included Niles, Jackson, and Marshall. The school officially opened its doors for classes on March 29, 1853, with 122 enrolled students. American normal schools were intended to be institutions to improve the quality of the burgeoning common school system by producing qualified teachers.

Adonijah Welch, a University of Michigan graduate, served as the Normal School&#x27;s first principal. He later became the first president of Iowa State Agricultural College, now Iowa State University. The university&#x27;s Georgian Revival-style Welch Hall bears his name. Constructed in 1895, Welch Hall is the second-oldest surviving building on the university&#x27;s campus and an Eastern Michigan University Historic District contributing property.

In 1899, the school became the Michigan State Normal College when it developed the first four-year curriculum for a normal school in the nation. The Normal College began the twentieth-century as Michigan&#x27;s premier teacher-preparatory school. The school continued through World War I, the Great Depression, and World War II, and continued to expand further. In 1956, under President Eugene Elliott, the school officially became Eastern Michigan College. This was mostly due to the expansion of the school&#x27;s programs and increased enrollment following the Second World War.

In 1959 the school became a university, gaining the title Eastern Michigan University after establishing the Graduate School (graduate classes had been offered for two decades, since 1939). Between 1959 and 1980 the College of Education, College of Arts and Sciences, the Graduate School, College of Business, College of Health and Human Services, and College of Technology (now GameAbove College of Engineering and Technology) were formally organized and established. In the early 1970s, international student exchange schemes were organized, including one with Coventry College of Education (later part of the University of Warwick) in Britain. In 2005, the Honors Program officially became the Eastern Michigan University Honors College.

More recently, extended programs were added, such as Continuing Education (which includes EMU Online), the Centers for Corporate Training, the World College, and numerous community-focused institutes. Most programs are undergraduate or master&#x27;s level, although the university has doctoral programs in Educational Leadership, Technology, and Psychology.

Prior to Michigan&#x27;s 1963 State Constitution, Eastern Michigan University was governed by Michigan&#x27;s elected State Board of Education. Since the ratification of the 1963 constitution, EMU has been governed by an eight-member Board of Regents. These regents are appointed by the Governor of Michigan with the advice and consent of the Michigan Senate, and serve eight-year terms. The regents, in turn, elect the president of the university.

== Campus ==

Eastern Michigan University&#x27;s main campus is located in Ypsilanti, Michigan, comprising 122 buildings and spanning .

Off-campus hangouts include Depot Town, Frog Island, Riverside Park, downtown Ann Arbor and The Ugly Mug coffee shop.

===Student organizations===
Student Organizations at Eastern are housed under Campus Life. Most academic departments on campus have at least one student organization for students who are interested in that subject area. Students work with volunteer organizations such as Habitat for Humanity both during the school year and on breaks. Other clubs include the Muslim Student Association, Eastern Michigan Smash Club (EMUSC) and the LGBTA (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender/Transsexual Association). Eastern Michigan University has over 340 student clubs and organizations.

EMU offers a variety of Greek organizations on campus. The Greek system provides fraternities and sororities students can join, many of which have houses within walking distance of campus. Just like most universities EMU has a National Pan-Hellenic Council, College Panhellenic Council and Interfraternity Council Interfraternity Council comprises eight fraternities, and the Panhellenic Council is made up of nine sororities. National Pan-Hellenic Council consists of 9 historically African-American fraternities and sororities, five fraternities and four sororities.

Alpha Sigma Tau, a national Panhellenic sorority was founded at EMU on November 4, 1899. Sigma Nu Phi, a local sorority, was founded on Eastern&#x27;s campus September 30, 1897. It is the oldest Greek organization on campus as well as the oldest continually-functioning local sorority in the nation. Greek Life at EMU hosts a yearly event called Greek Week. Greek Week is a week of events centered on Greek unity and spirit. The week often occurs in the beginning of April. Other traditions include Greek Awards. The yearly awards are based on the university&#x27;s Greek Standards and Assessment Program (GSAP).

===Campus media and publications===

The &quot;Eastern Echo&quot;, EMU&#x27;s independent student newspaper, is published three times a week during the fall and winter semesters and once a week during the spring semester, as well as publishing content online. The paper won eight awards in the 2005 Division 1 Michigan Collegiate Press Association contest, including second place in the general excellence category. The newspaper, which is funded through advertising revenue and university funds, is not under the editorial control of the university.

Also part of the EMU Student Media Office is &quot;Cellar Roots&quot;, the school&#x27;s student-run literary and fine arts magazine. &quot;Cellar Roots&quot; celebrated its 35th anniversary in 2006 with a week of events that highlighted the history of the publication. &quot;Cellar Roots&quot; is a five-time winner of the National Pacemaker award for design, an award often equated with the Pulitzer Prize for the college level, as well numerous other awards.

EMU hosts two radio stations WQBR and WEMU 89.1 FM. WEMU is a National Public Radio member station. The radio station, which features jazz music, has many student employees and broadcasts many EMU athletic games. WQBR stands for Quirk Building Radio, where the station was once hosted in Quirk. Today WQBR is named Eagle Radio and is no longer hosted in Quirk. Eagle Radio broadcasts from Halle library and is an Internet only radio station at www.eagleradio.org.

The LINGUIST List is a major online resource for the academic field of linguistics. It was founded by Anthony Aristar in early 1990 at the University of Western Australia, and is used as a reference by the National Science Foundation in the United States. Its main and oldest feature is the premoderated electronic mailing list, now with thousands of subscribers all over the world, where queries and their summarized results, discussions, journal table of contents, dissertation abstracts, calls for papers, book and conference announcements, software notices and other useful pieces of linguistic information are posted.

===Traditions===
Eastern Michigan has several campus-wide traditions throughout the school year. Longstanding traditions include Homecoming, Martin Luther King Jr. Week and the use of the Pray-Harrold Kiosk by students.

The Pray-Harrold Kiosk (or Pillar) is a large cement pillar outside the Pray-Harrold Building and the Rec/IM. The Pillar is painted by various organizations for campus awareness, advertisements and organization unity. The legend is that it started as a flagpole and layers of paint have accumulated over the years.

During Eastern&#x27;s fall semester, traditions include EagleFest, Community Plunge, and Homecoming. EagleFest occurs during the school&#x27;s orientation and welcoming weekend in September. The event brings more than 300 campus offices, and student organizations together in University Park &amp; Bowen Field House to showcase campus organizations and services. Community Plunge also occurs during orientation and offers the opportunity for students, staff and faculty to participate in service in the Ypsilanti community.

During Eastern&#x27;s winter semester campus traditions include: Ethos Week; The Gold Medallion Awards; Relay For Life; and Martin Luther King Jr. Week, held in conjunction with the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday, with speakers, community building events and awards in celebration of King and his dream. Ethos Week is a week-long annual event occurring in March and is led by the COB. The event promotes business ethics and ethics education. The Gold Medallions Awards are split into two ceremonies. The Gold Medallion Awards started in 1982 and is organized by Eastern&#x27;s Student Affairs Division to recognize faculty, students and staff. In 1996, the Student Gold Medallion Awards were established. The award ceremony recognizes student leaders, student organizations, divisional programs, activities or service. Eastern&#x27;s Relay For Life event is a 24-hour, yearly event held in University Park that started in 1985. The event is centered on supporting the American Cancer Society. The event brings in campus organizations from the entire campus. The event has been held at various times during the year but in recent times the event is held in early April before the school-year ends.

===Residence halls and apartments===


Eastern Michigan University has 14 residence halls. As of Fall 2014 first-year only residence halls will include Putnam and Phelps. Upperclassmen student living options include: the Village, Buell, and the three apartment complexes. Sellers, Wise, Walton, Downing, Wise, Hill, Hoyt, Pittman and Best house all students, regardless of class ranking. Honors students are housed in Downing and Best Halls. Past locations included Jones and Goddard Halls. Eastern also offers faculty, staff and family housing options in Cornell Courts, and Westview apartments.

According to the university, approximately 5,000 students live on campus. In the fall of 2010, EMU began housing some full-time students in the Village Complex from Washtenaw Community College, which is less than half a mile away, however the program ended in 2011 when housing enrollment went up.

In 2011, Eastern Michigan became the first university in Michigan and the eighth nationwide to offer a targeted program to house single parents with their children on campus. Called &quot;Keys to Degrees&quot;, the program will house single-parent families near each other in one of Eastern Michigan&#x27;s on-campus apartment complexes, and will offer extra academic and personal support to enrollees.

Dining services at EMU are operated by Chartwells Higher Education. Facilities include one buffet-style dining hall, two à la carte dining halls, the Student Center food court, and convenience stores across campus.

In June 2022, Eastern Michigan finalized plans to invest $200 million into a long-term renovation and addition to the campus&#x27; residence halls, including the renovation of all existing residence halls and the construction of two new residence halls.

===Safety===

EMU former-President Susan W. Martin, Ph.D., took office as EMU&#x27;s twenty-second president on July 7, 2008, just after the university was fined a then-record $350,000 for not reporting to students the sexual assault and murder of a student in her residence hall room.

==Athletics==



Eastern Michigan athletic teams have been successful on a national level, winning three NCAA Division II national championships and 13 NAIA Division I national championships in five different sports (baseball, men&#x27;s cross country, men&#x27;s swimming and diving, men&#x27;s indoor track and field, and men&#x27;s outdoor track and field).

EMU has also been NCAA Division I national runner-up twice in 1940 and 1976. In 1940, the men&#x27;s cross country team finished second to the Indiana Hoosiers. In 1976, the baseball team was defeated by the Arizona Wildcats in the final game of the College World Series. The Eagles have the most MAC championships in a single sport, 29, in men&#x27;s swimming and diving. For men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s Track and field (indoor and outdoor), collectively holds the record for most MAC titles out of all the EMU athletics teams.

Eastern&#x27;s men&#x27;s basketball team has appeared in four NCAA Division I tournaments, and have a 3–4 record, tied for third best among Michigan colleges. In the 1996 men&#x27;s basketball tournament, Eastern Michigan defeated the Duke Blue Devils in the opening round.

The 2006–2007 season was a successful one for Eastern Michigan, as they won an EMU and Mid-American Conference record eight conference titles: Men&#x27;s Cross Country, Men&#x27;s Swimming And Diving, Women&#x27;s Swimming And Diving, Softball, Men&#x27;s Indoor Track, Women&#x27;s Gymnastics, Men&#x27;s Golf and Men&#x27;s Outdoor Track. This beat the school&#x27;s previous record of five titles as well as the previous MAC record of six.

In 1987, EMU won its first Mid-American Conference title then defeated 17-point favorite San Jose State in the California Bowl.

There have been small successes though, such as a 6–4 record against rivals the Western Michigan Broncos and the Central Michigan Chippewas in the 5 years under coach Jeff Genyk from 2004 to 2008, setting a school record for a 5-year span against Western and Central.

Since the 1991 season, Eastern Michigan athletic teams have gone by the nickname &quot;Eagles&quot;. Prior to the 1991 season EMU used the name &quot;Hurons&quot;. EMU used the Hurons name and Indian logo from 1929 until 1991. Despite much controversy, support of the Huron tribes in Oklahoma and Quebec, and anger among its alumni, EMU changed the logo after the Michigan Department of Civil Rights issued a report suggesting all schools drop such logos. During the Michigan State Normal College years the school went by the nicknames such as &quot;Normalites&quot; and &quot;Men from Ypsi&quot; and various other titles.

=== Esports ===
The Eastern Michigan University (EMU) Esports program has grown significantly, relocating from a small space in the REC/IM building to a state-of-the-art facility in the Student Center. This new location features over 20 computers, enabling competitive teams and community members to practice and connect. The facility allows EMU Esports to host in-person events and tournaments, such as a scholastic invitational for &quot;Valorant&quot; and &quot;Rocket League&quot; on November 9 and 10, 2024, while expanding its presence through weekly student outreach and social media. With improved facilities, the program aims to strengthen its community connections and establish a national reputation in collegiate esports.

<text>Stephen V (, , ; before 18 October 1239 – 6 August 1272) was King of Hungary and Croatia between 1270 and 1272, and Duke of Styria from 1258 to 1260. He was the oldest son of King Béla IV and Maria Laskarina. King Béla had his son crowned king at the age of six and appointed him Duke of Slavonia. Still a child, Stephen married Elizabeth, a daughter of a chieftain of the Cumans whom his father settled in the Great Hungarian Plain.

King Béla appointed Stephen Duke of Transylvania in 1257 and Duke of Styria in 1258. The local noblemen in Styria, which had been annexed four years before, opposed his rule. Assisted by King Ottokar II of Bohemia, they rebelled and expelled Stephen&#x27;s troops from most parts of Styria. After Ottokar II routed the united army of Stephen and his father in the Battle of Kressenbrunn on 12 July 1260, Stephen left Styria and returned to Transylvania.

Stephen forced his father to cede all the lands of the Kingdom of Hungary to the east of the Danube to him and adopted the title of junior king in 1262. In two years, a civil war broke out between father and son, because Stephen accused Béla of planning to disinherit him. They concluded a peace treaty in 1266, but confidence was never restored between them. Stephen succeeded his father, who died on 3 May 1270, without difficulties, but his sister Anna and his father&#x27;s closest advisors fled to the Kingdom of Bohemia. Ottokar II invaded Hungary in the spring of 1271, but Stephen routed him. In next summer, a rebellious lord captured and imprisoned Stephen&#x27;s son, Ladislaus. Shortly thereafter, Stephen unexpectedly fell ill and died.

==Childhood (1239–1245)==

Stephen was the eighth child and first son of King Béla IV of Hungary and his wife, Maria, a daughter of Theodore I Lascaris, Emperor of Nicaea. He was born in 1239. Archbishop Robert of Esztergom baptised him on 18 October. The child, heir apparent from birth, was named after Saint Stephen, the first King of Hungary.

Béla and his family, including Stephen, fled to Zagreb after the Mongols had annihilated the royal army in the Battle of Mohi on 11 April 1241. The Mongols crossed the frozen Danube in February 1242 and the royal family ran off as far as the well-fortified Dalmatian town of Trogir. The King and his family returned from Dalmatia after the Mongols unexpectedly withdrew from Hungary in March.

==Junior king==
===Duke of Slavonia (1245–1257)===

A royal charter of 1246 mentions Stephen as &quot;King, and Duke of Slavonia&quot;. Apparently, in the previous year, Béla had his son crowned as junior king and endowed with the lands between the river Dráva and the Adriatic Sea, according to historians Gyula Kristó and Ferenc Makk. The seven-year-old Stephen&#x27;s provinces—Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia—were administered by royal governors, known as bans.

In a letter addressed to Pope Innocent IV in the late 1240s, Béla IV wrote that &quot;[o]n behalf of Christendom we had our son marry a Cuman girl&quot;. The bride was Elizabeth, the daughter of a leader of the Cumans whom Béla had invited to settle in the plains along the river Tisza. Elizabeth had been baptized, but ten Cuman chieftains present at the ceremony nevertheless took their customary oath upon a dog cut into two by a sword.

===Duke of Transylvania and Styria (1257–1260)===
When Stephen attained the age of majority in 1257, his father appointed him Duke of Transylvania. Stephen&#x27;s rule in Transylvania was short-lived, because his father transferred him to Styria in 1258. Styria had been annexed in 1254, but the local lords rose up in rebellion and expelled Béla IV&#x27;s governor, Stephen Gutkeled, before Stephen&#x27;s appointment. Stephen and his father jointly invaded Styria and subdued the rebels. In addition to Styria, Stephen also received two neighboring counties—Vas and Zala—in Hungary from his father. He launched a plundering raid in Carinthia in the spring of 1259, in retaliation of Duke Ulrich III of Carinthia&#x27;s support of the Styrian rebels.

Stephen&#x27;s rule remained unpopular in Styria. With support from King Ottokar II of Bohemia, the local lords again rebelled. Stephen could preserve only Pettau (present-day Ptuj, Slovenia) and its region. On 25 June 1260, Stephen crossed the river Morava to invade Ottokar&#x27;s realm. His military force, which consisted of Székely, Romanian and Cuman troops, routed an Austrian army. However, in the decisive Battle of Kressenbrunn King Béla&#x27;s and Stephen&#x27;s united army was vanquished on 12 July, primarily because the main forces, which were under King Béla&#x27;s command, arrived late. Stephen, who commanded the advance guard, barely escaped from the battlefield. The Peace of Vienna, which was signed on 31 March 1261, put an end to the conflict between Hungary and Bohemia, forcing Béla IV to renounce of Styria in favor of Ottokar II.

===Conflicts and civil war (1260–1270)===

Stephen returned to Transylvania and started to rule it for the second time after 20 August 1260. He and his father jointly invaded Bulgaria and seized Vidin in 1261. His father returned to Hungary, but Stephen continued the campaign alone. He laid siege to Lom on the Danube and advanced as far as Tirnovo in pursuit of Tsar Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria. However, the Tsar succeeded in avoiding any clashes with the invaders and Stephen withdrew his troops from Bulgaria by the end of the year.

Stephen&#x27;s relationship with Béla IV deteriorated in the early 1260s. Stephen&#x27;s charters reveal his fear of being disinherited and expelled by his father. He also accused some unnamed barons of inciting the old monarch against him. On the other hand, Stephen&#x27;s charters prove that he made land grants in Bihar, Szatmár, Ugocsa, and other counties which were situated outside Transylvania.

Archbishops Philip of Esztergom and Smaragd of Kalocsa undertook to mediate after some clashes occurred between the two kings&#x27; partisans in the autumn. According to the Peace of Pressburg, which was concluded around 25 November, Béla IV and his son divided the country and Stephen received the lands to the east of the Danube. When confirming the treaty on 5 December, Stephen also promised that he would not invade Slavonia which had been granted to his younger brother, Béla, by their father. On this occasion, Stephen styled himself &quot;Junior King, Duke of Transylvania and Lord of the Cumans&quot;.

A Bulgarian nobleman, Despot Jacob Svetoslav sought assistance from Stephen after his domains, which were situated in the regions south of Vidin, were overrun by Byzantine troops in the second half of 1263. Stephen sent reinforcements under the command of Ladislaus II Kán, Voivode of Transylvania to Bulgaria. The Voivode routed the Byzantines and drove them out of Bulgaria. Stephen granted Vidin to Jacob Svetoslav who accepted his suzerainty.

The reconciliation of Stephen and his father was only temporary. Stephen confiscated the domains of his mother and sister, Anna—including Beszterce (present-day Bistrița, Romania) and Füzér—which were located in the lands under his rule. Béla IV&#x27;s army crossed the Danube under Anna&#x27;s command sometime after the autumn of 1264. She besieged and took Sárospatak and seized Stephen&#x27;s wife and children. Voivode Ladislaus Kán turned against Stephen and led an army, which consisted of Cuman warriors, to Transylvania. Stephen routed him at the fort of Déva (now Deva, Romania). King Béla&#x27;s Judge royal, Lawrence arrived at the head of a new army and forced Stephen to retreat to Feketehalom (now Codlea, Romania). The Judge royal lay siege to the fortress, but Stephen&#x27;s partisans relieved it. Stephen launched a counter-offensive and forced his father&#x27;s army to retreat. He gained a decisive victory over his father&#x27;s army in the Battle of Isaszeg in March 1265. The two archbishops mediated a new consolidation between father and son, which confirmed the 1262 division of the country. Béla and Stephen signed the peace treaty in the Convent of the Blessed Virgin on the Rabbits&#x27; Island (now Margaret Island in Budapest) on 23 March 1266.

During the civil war in Hungary, Stephen&#x27;s vassal, Despot Jacob Svetoslav submitted himself to Tsar Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria. In the summer of 1266, Stephen invaded Bulgaria, seized Vidin, Pleven and other forts and routed the Bulgarians in five battles. Jacob Svetoslav again accepted Stephen&#x27;s suzerainty and was reinstalled in Vidin. From then on, Stephen used the title &quot;King of Bulgaria&quot; in his charters.

Béla and Stephen together confirmed the liberties of the &quot;royal servants&quot;, from then on known as noblemen, in 1267. A double marriage alliance between Stephen and King Charles I of Sicily—Stephen&#x27;s son, Ladislaus married Charles&#x27;s daughter, Elisabeth, and Charles&#x27;s namesake son married Stephen&#x27;s daughter, Mary—strengthened Stephen&#x27;s international position in 1269. Confidence was never restored between Béla and Stephen. On his deathbed, the old King requested King Ottokar II of Bohemia to give shelter to his daughter Anna and his partisans after his death.

==Reign (1270–1272)==
The senior King died on 3 May 1270. His daughter, Anna, seized the royal treasury and fled to Bohemia. Henry Kőszegi, Nicholas Geregye, and Lawrence Aba—Béla&#x27;s closest advisors—followed her and handed over Kőszeg, Borostyánkő (Bernstein, Austria) and their other castles along the western borders to Ottokar II. Instead of leaving Hungary, Nicholas Hahót garrisoned Styrian soldiers in his fort at Pölöske, and made plundering raids against the nearby villages. Stephen nominated his own partisans to the highest offices; for instance, Joachim Gutkeled became Ban of Slavonia, and Matthew Csák was appointed Voivode of Transylvania. Stephen granted Esztergom County to Archbishop Philip who crowned him king in Esztergom on or after 17 May.

The Polish chronicler Jan Długosz writes that Stephen made &quot;a pilgrimage to the tomb of St. Stanisław&quot; in Kraków and visited his brother-in-law, Boleslaw the Chaste, Duke of Kraków at the end of August. The two monarchs renewed &quot;the old alliance between Hungary and Poland&quot; and entered into an alliance &quot;to have the same friends and the same enemies&quot;. Stephen also met Ottokar II on an island of the Danube near Pressburg (present-day Bratislava, Slovakia), but they only concluded a truce.

Stephen launched a plundering raid into Austria around 21 December. King Ottokar invaded the lands north of the Danube in April 1271 and captured a number of fortresses, including Dévény (now Devín, Slovakia), Pressburg and Nagyszombat (present-day Trnava, Slovakia). Ottokar routed Stephen at Pressburg on 9 May, and at Mosonmagyaróvár on 15 May, but Stephen won the decisive battle on the Rábca River on 21 May. Ottokar withdrew from Hungary and Stephen chased his troops as far as Vienna. The two kings&#x27; envoys reached an agreement in Pressburg on 2 July. According to their treaty, Stephen promised that he would not assist Ottokar&#x27;s opponents in Carinthia, and Ottokar renounced the castles he and his partisans held in Hungary. The Hungarians soon recaptured Kőszeg, Borostyánkő and other fortresses along the western border of Hungary. 

According to the &quot;Life&quot; of Stephen&#x27;s saintly sister, Margaret, who had died on 18 January 1270, Stephen was present when the first miracle attributed to her occurred on the first anniversary of her death. Stephen, in fact, initiated Margaret&#x27;s canonization at the Holy See in 1271. In the same year, Stephen granted town privileges to the citizens of Győr. He also confirmed the liberties of the Saxon &quot;guests&quot; in the Szepesség region (present-day Spiš, Slovakia), contributing to the development of their autonomous community. On the other hand, Stephen protected the Archbishop of Esztergom&#x27;s rights against the conditional nobles of the archbishopric who attempted to get rid of their obligations.

Ban Joachim Gutkeled kidnapped Stephen&#x27;s ten-year-old son and heir, Ladislaus and imprisoned him in the castle of Koprivnica in the summer of 1272. Stephen besieged the fortress, but could not capture it. Stephen fell ill and was taken to the Csepel Island. He died on 6 August 1272. Stephen was buried near to the tomb of his sister, Margaret, in the Monastery of the Blessed Virgin on Rabbits&#x27; Island.

==Family==

Stephen&#x27;s wife, Elizabeth, was born around 1239, according to historian Gyula Kristó. A charter of her father-in-law, Béla IV, refers to one Seyhan, a Cuman chieftain as his kinsman, implying that Seyhan was Elizabeth&#x27;s father. Stephen&#x27;s first child by Elizabeth, Catherine, was born around 1256. She was given in marriage to Stephen Dragutin, the elder son and heir of King Stephen Uroš I of Serbia, in about 1268. Her sister Mary was born around 1257 and married the future Charles II of Naples in 1270. Their grandson Charles Robert became King of Hungary in the first decade of the 14th century.

According to historian Gyula Kristó, Stephen&#x27;s third (unnamed) daughter was the wife of Despot Jacob Svetoslav. Stephen&#x27;s third (or fourth) daughter, Elizabeth, who was born in about 1260, became a Dominican nun in the Monastery of the Blessed Virgin on Rabbits&#x27; Island. She was appointed prioress in 1277, but her brother, Ladislaus, kidnapped and married her to a Czech baron, Záviš of Falkenstein, in 1288. Stephen&#x27;s youngest daughter, Anna, was born in about 1260. She married Andronikos Palaiologos, son and heir of the Byzantine Emperor, Michael VIII.

Stephen&#x27;s first son, Ladislaus IV, was born in 1262. He succeeded his father in 1272. Stephen&#x27;s youngest child, Andrew, was born in 1268 and died at the age of 10.

<text>Ladislaus V, more commonly known as Ladislaus the Posthumous (; ; ; ; 22 February 144023 November 1457), was Duke of Austria and King of Hungary, Croatia and Bohemia. He was the posthumous son of Albert of Habsburg with Elizabeth of Luxembourg. Albert had bequeathed all his realms to his future son on his deathbed, but only the estates of Austria accepted his last will. Fearing an Ottoman invasion, the majority of the Hungarian lords and prelates offered the crown to Vladislaus III of Poland. The Hussite noblemen and towns of Bohemia did not acknowledge the hereditary right of Albert&#x27;s descendants to the throne, but also did not elect a new king.

After Ladislaus&#x27;s birth, his mother seized the Holy Crown of Hungary and had Ladislaus crowned king in Székesfehérvár on 15 May 1440. However, the Diet of Hungary declared Ladislaus&#x27;s coronation invalid and elected Vladislaus I as king. A civil war broke out which lasted for years. Elizabeth appointed her late husband&#x27;s distant cousin, Albert VI as her child&#x27;s guardian. However, as a representative of the interests of the Austrian and Hungarian estates, he could not defend himself against his rival, Frederick III, King of the Romans, who in turn took over his role as guardian of Ladislaus. Albert had to renounce his guardianship and in return received the mighty Hungarian border castle Forchtenstein, including a principality in the Hungarian-Styrian-Carinthian area. Ladislaus lived at Frederick&#x27;s court (mainly in Wiener Neustadt), where Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini (later Pope Pius II) wrote a treatise on his upbringing.

After his mother died in late 1442, Ladislaus&#x27; interests were represented by a Czech condottiere, John Jiskra of Brandýs, in Hungary, and by the Czech Catholic lord, Ulrich II of Rosenberg, in Bohemia. Ladislaus&#x27; rival in Hungary, Vladislaus, fell in the Battle of Varna in November 1444. The next year, the Diet of Hungary offered to acknowledge Ladislaus as king if Frederick III renounced his guardianship. After Frederick III rejected the offer, the Diet of Hungary elected John Hunyadi regent in 1446. In Bohemia, the head of the moderate Hussites (or Utraquists), George of Poděbrady, took control of Prague in 1448. The Estates of Austria forced Frederick III to resign the guardianship and hand over Ladislaus to them in September 1452. Royal administration was formally restored in Hungary after Hunyadi resigned the regency in early 1453, but he continued to control most royal castles and revenues.

Ulrich II, Count of Celje (his mother&#x27;s cousin) became Ladislaus&#x27; main advisor, but an Austrian baron, Ulrich von Eytzinger, forced Ladislaus to expel Celje from his court. Although Ladislaus was crowned king of Bohemia on 28 October 1453, Poděbrady remained in full control of the government. During the following years, Eytzinger, Hunyadi and Poděbrady closely cooperated to mutually secure their positions. Ladislaus was reconciled with Ulrich II in early 1455. With the support of the leading Hungarian barons, Ladislaus persuaded Hunyadi to withdraw his troops from most royal castles and renounce the administration of part of the royal revenues.

After the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II decided to invade Hungary, Ladislaus and Ulrich II left the kingdom. The sultan laid siege to Belgrade. Hunyadi relieved the fortress on 22 July 1456, but he died two weeks later. Ladislaus and Ulrich II returned to Hungary and tried to force Hunyadi&#x27;s son, also named Ladislaus, to renounce all royal castles and revenues, but Ladislaus Hunyadi murdered Ulrich II on 9 November, forcing Ladislaus to grant an amnesty to him. However, most Hungarian barons were hostile towards Ladislaus Hunyadi. With their support, Ladislaus captured him and his brother, Matthias. After Ladislaus Hunyadi was executed in March 1457, his relatives stirred up a rebellion against Ladislaus, forcing him to flee from Hungary. Ladislaus died unexpectedly in Prague. He was the last male member of the Albertinian Line of the House of Habsburg.

==Life==
===Parentage and birth===
Ladislaus was the posthumous son of Albert II of Germany and Elizabeth of Luxembourg. Albert was the hereditary duke of Austria, while Elizabeth was the only child of Emperor Sigismund, who was also king of Bohemia and Hungary. Sigismund had mortgaged the Duchy of Luxembourg to his niece, Elizabeth of Goerlitz. He wanted to secure his realms for both his daughter and her husband, but the Estates of Bohemia and Hungary did not acknowledge the couple&#x27;s hereditary right to rule. After Sigismund died in December 1437, Albert was elected the sole king of Hungary. In Bohemia, Albert was unanimously elected king only after he defeated Casimirthe younger brother of Vladislaus III of Polandwho was supported by a group of Hussite lords and burghers.

Albert was planning to launch a military expedition against the Ottoman Turks, who had been making plundering raids in the southern regions of Hungary, but fell seriously ill during the preparations. The dying king, who knew that his wife was pregnant, willed Austria, Bohemia and Hungary to his posthumous child if his wife gave birth to a son. He also put the potential heir under the guardianship of his widow and his cousin, Frederick of Austria. Albert died on 27 October 1439.

Fearing a new Ottoman invasion of Hungary, the majority of the Hungarian lords and prelates refused to accept the deceased king&#x27;s last will. They offered the crown to Vladislaus III of Poland and wanted to persuade the pregnant queen dowager to marry the new king. In Bohemia, the assembly of the Estates passed decrees in January 1440 to avoid having a new civil war break out between the Hussites and the Catholics before a new king was elected. The Estates of Moravia passed a similar decree.

Although the 31-year-old Elizabeth seemingly agreed to marry Vladislaus, who was only 16, she made preparations for the coronation of her son after her physicians predicted that she would have a son. She ordered her chambermaid, Helene Kottanner, to steal the Holy Crown of Hungary from the castle of Visegrád. Before long, Helene Kottanner and her accomplice seized the crown. They handed it to the queen on the very day she went into labour, which was considered a miracle by both the queen and her courtiers. Elizabeth gave birth to Ladislaus in Komárom (now Komárno in Slovakia) on 21 February 1440, almost four months after his father&#x27;s death. He was named for King St Ladislaus. Dénes Szécsi, Archbishop of Esztergom, baptised him.

===Inheritance and civil war===
The Estates of the Duchy of Austria acknowledged Ladislaus&#x27; right to rule and made Frederick of Austria, who had been elected King of the Romans, regent in accordance with the last will of Ladislaus&#x27; father. In Bohemia, only the Catholic lords, who were under the leadership of Ulrich II of Rosenberg, were willing to accept Ladislaus&#x27; hereditary right to rule. Soon after the birth of her son, Queen Elizabeth sent envoys to Poland to persuade the delegates of the Hungarian Estates to break off their negotiations with Vladislaus III of Poland. However, the Hungarian lords refused and elected Vladislaus king on 8 March 1440. Before his election, Vladislaus had pledged that he would marry Queen Elizabeth and protect her infant son&#x27;s interests in Austria and Bohemia.

The queen refused to give her consent to the project and decided to have her son crowned king before Vladislaus came to Hungary. She hastily took Ladislaus from Komárom to Székesfehérvár, which was the traditional place of the royal coronations in Hungary. After a young lord, Nicholas Újlaki, symbolically knighted the infant Ladislaus, Archbishop Dénes Szécsi anointed and crowned him king on 15 May. During the lengthy ceremonies, his mother&#x27;s cousin, Ulrich II, Count of Celje, held the crown over the head of Ladislaus who burst into tears while the coronation oath was being read out on his behalf. Six days later Vladislaus III entered Buda. Queen Elizabeth fled first to Győr, and from there to Sopron, taking the infant king with her.

The most powerful lordsincluding Ladislaus Garai, Đurađ Branković, Frederick II and Ulrich II of Celje and most towns remained faithful to the child-king, but most noblemen preferred Vladislaus&#x27; rule in the hope that he would be able to lead the defence of the kingdom against the Ottomans. A civil war broke out between the partisans of the two kings which would last for years. The Diet declared Ladislaus&#x27; coronation invalid on 29 June 1440, stating that &quot;the crowning of kings is always dependent on the will of the kingdom&#x27;s inhabitants, in whose consent both the effectiveness and the force of the crown reside&quot;. On 17 July, Archbishop Dénes Szécsi crowned Vladislaus king with a crown taken from the tomb of King Saint Stephen, the first king of Hungary.

In need of financial resources to continue the war against Vladislaus, Queen Elizabeth signed a treaty with Frederick III, King of the Romans, in Wiener Neustadt on 22 November. She not only mortgaged Sopron to Frederick III, but also appointed him as her son&#x27;s guardian and gave the Holy Crown of Hungary to him. Thereafter Ladislaus lived in Frederick III&#x27;s court, mainly in Wiener Neustatdt.

Queen Elizabeth hired a Czech condottiere, John Jiskra of Brandýs, who took control of Kassa (now Košice in Slovakia) and a dozen other towns in Upper Hungary during the next months. However, Vladislaus&#x27; two military commanders, Nicholas Újlaki and John Hunyadi, defeated the united army of the child Ladislaus&#x27;s supporters from the central and southern parts of Hungary in the Battle of Bátaszék in early 1441. During the next months, Vladislaus and his commanders took control of the western and eastern territories of Hungary, but Jiskra and Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s other supporters continued to control Upper Hungary, along with Esztergom, Győr, Pressburg (now Bratislava in Slovakia) and other important towns. Negotiations began and Queen Elizabeth and Vladislaus signed a peace treaty in Győr on 13 December 1442. The queen recognized Vladislaus as king, but preserved her son&#x27;s claim to the throne. Three or four days later the queen suddenly died and Ladislaus became an orphan before his third birthday.

===Wardship===
After the death of Ladislaus&#x27; mother, his claim to rule in Hungary and Bohemia was primarily protected by Jan Jiskra and Ulrich of Rosenberg, respectively. Most parts of Hungary remained under the rule of Ladislaus&#x27;s rival, Vladislaus. In Bohemia, the moderate Hussite lord, Hynce Ptáček of Pirkstein, administered the eastern territories, and the towns dominated by the radical Taborites were united in a league. The Hussite Ctibor Tovačovský of Cimburk, who had assumed the title governor after Albert&#x27;s death, continued to administer Moravia, closely cooperating with the towns and the Catholic Bishop of Olomouc. Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, whom Elizabeth of Goerlitz made her heir, invaded Luxemburg on her behalf in 1443. Frederick III authorized the Estates of Luxemburg to pay homage to Philip the Good, but he also stipulated that Ladislaus could buy back the duchy after Elizabeth of Goerlitz&#x27;s death. During Ladislaus&#x27;s lifetime, the Luxembourgeoise Estates did not recognize Philip the Good as their legitimate sovereign.
Ladislaus&#x27; rival, Vladislaus, died fighting against the Ottomans in the Battle of Varna on 10 November 1444. At the Diet of next year, the Hungarian Estates agreed that they would acknowledge the child Ladislaus as king if Vladislaus, whose fate was still uncertain, did not come back to Hungary before 1 June 1445. However, they stipulated that they would elect a new king if the child king&#x27;s guardian, Frederick III, did not release both the king and the Holy Crown of Hungary. The Estates also elected seven &quot;Captains in Chief&quot;John Hunyadi, Nicholas Újlaki, George Rozgonyi, Emeric Bebek, Michael Ország, Pancrace Szentmiklósi, and Jan Jiskrato administer the kingdom. Frederick III stormed into Hungary, and captured a dozen fortresses along the western frontiers of Hungary, including Kőszeg, by the end of July. The Counts of Celje, who were related to Ladislaus through his mother, invaded Slavonia and took control of the province before the end of the year. As Frederick III refused to release Ladislaus, the Diet of Hungary elected John Hunyadi regent for the period of Ladislaus&#x27; minority on 6 June 1446. John Hunyadi, who adopted the title governor, ruled most part of Hungary, but could not expand his authority over the regions under the rule of Frederick III, Jan Jiskra and the Counts of Celje. The envoys of the Hungarian Estates and Frederick III signed a truce on 1 June 1446, which confirmed Frederick III&#x27;s guardianship over Ladislaus.

In Bohemia, George of Poděbrady took up the leadership of the moderate Hussite lords after the death of Hynce Ptáček. He captured Prague on 3 September 1448 and imprisoned Meinhard of Neuhaus who had started negotiations of the moderate Hussites&#x27; union with the Catholic Church. Early the next year, Ulrich of Rosenberg and other Catholic lords entered into a formal league against Poděbrady.

Ladislaus had a good education in Frederick III&#x27;s court. A Latin grammar was completed especially for him. Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini (the future Pope Pius II) summarized his advice on education in a letter that he addressed to the ten-year-old Ladislaus in 1450. Piccolomini suggested that Ladislaus should read both classical authors (including Archimedes, Cicero, Livy and Vergil) and the Bible. He also emphasized the importance of physical training, stating that &quot;both mind and must be developed side by side&quot;.

John Hunyadi signed a peace treaty with Frederick III on 22 October 1450. They agreed that Ladislaus would remain under Frederick III&#x27;s guardianship until his eighteenth birthday, and during Ladislaus&#x27; minority Hunyadi would administer Hungary. Their agreement stirred up discontent among the Austrian Estates, because the age of majority was twelve or sixteen, according to local customs. The Austrian lords tried to prevent Ladislaus from accompanying his guardian to Italy in late 1451. However, Frederick took Ladislaus with him to Rome where Frederick was crowned Holy Roman Emperor. After their return from Italy, Emperor Frederick again refused to renounce the guardianship of Ladislaus, provoking the Austrian Estates to rise up in open rebellion in early 1452. The representatives of the Austrian and Hungarian Estates, and the Bohemian Catholic lords, signed a treaty in Vienna on 5 March against Emperor Frederick, but he refused to hand over Ladislaus to them. On the other hand, the emperor assisted George of Poděbrady in gaining the newly established office of governor in Bohemia in April. The rebellious Austrian lords laid siege to Wiener Neustadt, forcing Emperor Frederick III to hand over Ladislaus to Ulrich of Celje on 4 September.

===Reign===
Count Ulrich von Cilli accompanied Ladislaus to Vienna but only after &quot;washing the Styrian filth off him&quot; to symbolize the liberation of Ladislaus from the &quot;Styrian&quot; Frederick III&#x27;s influence. Ladislaus Garai and Nicholas Újlaki visited Ladislaus in Vienna in October, and John Hunyadi also joined them before the end of the year. Hunyadi resigned from the governorship early the next year. Ladislaus made Hunyadi &quot;captain general of the kingdom&quot;, authorizing him to retain all royal castles that were in his possession at the time of his resignation, and to continue administering royal revenues. Hunyadi was only to pay 24,000 gold florins to the sovereign in each year. During a debate between the representatives of the Austrian and Hungarian Estates about his future seat, Ladislaus declared that he was Hungarian and wanted to live in Hungary, according to Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini.

On 29 January 1453 in Pressburg, the Diet of Hungary acknowledged Ladislaus&#x27; position as the lawful king without a formal election or a new coronation. He declared an amnesty for those who had supported Vladislaus against him. Although all grants that Queen Elizabeth and King Vladislaus had made were annulled, Ladislaus issued new charters of grant for the grantees to confirm their proprietary rights. The greater chancellery and the secret chancellery (two important offices of central administration, which had not functioned for a decade) were restored under the direction of Archbishop Dénes Szécsi and John Vitéz, Bishop of Várad (now Oradea in Romania). The central courts of justice (the Court of Royal Special Presence and the Court of Personal Presence) also started functioning again.

Ladislaus returned to Vienna shortly after the Diet was closed. During the next months, Ulrich of Celje was Ladislaus&#x27; most influential advisor. Celje signed a treaty with George of Poděbrady on 16 April and persuaded Ladislaus to confirm Poděbrady&#x27;s position as governor in Bohemia. Ulrich of Celje also signed a treaty with Archbishop Dénes Szécsi, Ladislaus Garai, Nicholas Újlaki, and other Hungarian lords on 13 September, who promised to support him against his opponents. Their league was implicitly formed against John Hunyadi and Ulrich Eytzinger, the head of the Estates in Austria, who had for long been hostile towards Ulrich of Celje. Fifteen days later, Ulrich Eytzinger persuaded Ladislaus to expel Ulrich of Celje from his court at an assembly of the Estates of Austria.

Ladislaus was crowned king of Bohemia in Prague on 28 October 1453, which put an end to the long interregnum. Ulrich Eytzinger, John Hunyadi, and George Poděbrady, who all were present at Ladislaus&#x27; coronation, signed a treaty. Ladislaus stayed in Prague during the next twelve months. George Poděbrady hindered him from consulting with his Austrian and Hungarian advisors, and even the royal seal was taken from Ladislaus. At the next Diet of Hungary, Bishop John Vitéz submitted a proposal on the king&#x27;s behalf to the Estates, demanding the centralization of the administration of royal revenues, but the Diet refused the proposal, which would have limited John Hunyadi&#x27;s authority. According to the document prepared by the bishop on this occasion, Ladislaus&#x27; cash revenues amounted to 216,000 florins. Historian János M. Bak writes that that amount would have only covered about 85% of the expenses of a military expedition against the Ottoman Turks, who had captured Constantinople and planned to invade Hungary.

Ladislaus left Prague in late November 1454. He visited Silesia and Moravia where the local Estates paid homage to him. After Ladislaus arrived in Moravia, Ctibor Tovačovský himself appointed Czech Catholic noblemen as royal officials, ensuring their loyalty towards him. Ladislaus returned to Vienna on 16 February 1455. Taking advantage of Ulrich Eytzinger&#x27;s growing unpopularity among the Austrian noblemen, Ulrich of Celje persuaded Ladislaus to restore him in his court. On 20 February, Ulrich triumphally returned to Vienna and vigorously reasserted his role as the young king&#x27;s main advisor for Austrian affairs. Ladislaus visited Buda and persuaded Hunyadi to resign a part of the royal revenues and withdraw his garrisons from Buda, Diósgyőr and other royal castles. Ulrich of Celje also renewed his alliance with Ladislaus Garai and Nicholas Újlaki on 7 April.

The newly elected Pope Callixtus III declared a crusade against the Ottoman Turks, who had occupied the greater part of Serbia. News of Sultan Mehmed II&#x27;s preparations for invasion reached Hungary in autumn 1455. Ladislaus came to Hungary in February 1456. He held a Diet in March that proclaimed general mobilization and consented to an extraordinary tax to cover the expenditures of the defense of the country. In April, Ladislaus borrowed 8,000 florins from Hunyadi, because the king had to pay off half of his former debt to Ulrich of Celje. Before the sultan&#x27;s army reached the southern border of Hungary, Ladislaus left Hungary and returned to Vienna.

Sultan Mehmed II laid siege to Belgrade in early July 1456. With the assistance of thousands of commoners whom John of Capistrano, a Franciscan friar, had stirred up to join the crusade against the Ottomans, John Hunyadi prevented the besiegers from completing the blockade and relieved Belgrade on 22 July. Two weeks later, Hunyadi died of an epidemic that broke out in Belgrade.

Ladislaus returned to Hungary in September. Ulrich of Celje accompanied him at the head of an army of German crusaders who had assembled near Vienna. Ladislaus made Ulrich of Celje &quot;captain general&quot;. They also decided to reclaim all royal castles and revenues that Hunyadi had held from his son, Ladislaus Hunyadi. The young Hunyadi seemingly yielded to the king at their meeting in Futak (now Futog in Serbia) and invited Ladislaus and Ulrich of Celje to Belgrade, but after the king and the Count of Celje entered the fortress, Hunyadi&#x27;s soldiers attacked and murdered the count on 9 November. The royal army soon disbanded, and the king found himself captive. He accompanied Hunyadi to Temesvár (now Timișoara in Romania), which was an important center of the Hunyadi domains. Hunyadi only allowed the king to leave Temesvár after Ladislaus made him captain general and pledged that he would not take revenge for Ulrich of Celje&#x27;s murder.

From Temesvár, Ladislaus went to Buda. He soon realized that the majority of the Hungarian barons were hostile towards Ladislaus Hunyadi. Upon the advice of Ladislaus Garai, the king convinced Ladislaus Hunyadi, who had also arrived in the capital, to persuade his younger brother, the fourteen-year-old Matthias, to join him in Buda. As soon as Matthias arrived on 14 March 1457, Ladislaus had the two Hunyadis imprisoned. Sitting in the royal council, the barons of the realm condemned the Hunyadi brothers to death for high treason, and Ladislaus Hunyadi was beheaded on 16 March. The Hunyadi brothers&#x27; mother, Elizabeth Szilágyi, and her brother, Michael Szilágyi, rebelled against the king, which caused a civil war between the lords loyal to the king and the supporters of the Hunyadi family. Ladislaus appointed John Jiskra to be the commander of the royal army and left Hungary for Vienna, dragging the captive Matthias Hunyadi with him in early June.

From Vienna, Ladislaus went to Prague where he unexpectedly died on 23 November 1457. Although his contemporaries suspected that the young king was poisoned, the examination of his skeleton suggests that he fell victim either to bubonic plague or to leukemia. He was buried in the St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague.

==Family==
Ladislaus never married. After his arrival in Prague in autumn 1457, he asked for the hand of Magdalena, daughter of Charles VII of France. Charles VII accepted that proposal but Ladislaus had died by the time the marriage contract was signed by his envoys in Paris. With Ladislaus&#x27;s death, the &quot;Albertinian Line&quot; of the House of Habsburg became extinct. Emperor Frederick III and his brother, Albert VI, jointly succeeded him in Austria. In Hungary, Matthias Hunyadi was elected king two months after Ladislaus&#x27; death. George of Poděbrady was elected king of Bohemia on 3 March 1458.

<doc id="161738" wikidata="Q156147" url="?curid=161738" title="Ladislaus IV of Hungary">
<text>Ladislaus IV (, , ; 5 August 1262 – 10 July 1290), also known as Ladislaus the Cuman, was King of Hungary and Croatia from 1272 to 1290. His mother, Elizabeth, was the daughter of a chieftain from the pagan Cumans who had settled in Hungary. At the age of seven, he married Elisabeth (or Isabella), a daughter of King Charles I of Sicily. Ladislaus was only 9 when a rebellious lord, Joachim Gutkeled, kidnapped and imprisoned him.

Ladislaus was still a prisoner when his father Stephen V died on 6 August 1272. During his minority, many groupings of barons – primarily the Abas, Csáks, Kőszegis, and Gutkeleds – fought against each other for supreme power. Ladislaus was declared to be of age at an assembly of the prelates, barons, noblemen, and Cumans in 1277. He allied himself with Rudolf I of Germany against Ottokar II of Bohemia. His forces had a preeminent role in Rudolf&#x27;s victory over Ottokar in the Battle on the Marchfeld on 26 August 1278.

However, Ladislaus could not restore royal power in Hungary. A papal legate, Philip, bishop of Fermo, came to Hungary to help Ladislaus consolidate his authority, but the prelate was shocked at the presence of thousands of pagan Cumans in Hungary. Ladislaus promised that he would force them to adopt a Christian lifestyle, but they refused to obey the legate&#x27;s demands. Ladislaus decided to support the Cumans, for which Philip of Fermo excommunicated him. The Cumans imprisoned the legate, and the legate&#x27;s partisans captured Ladislaus. In early 1280, Ladislaus agreed to persuade the Cumans to submit to the legate, but many Cumans preferred to leave Hungary.

Ladislaus vanquished a Cuman army that invaded Hungary in 1282. Hungary also survived a Mongol invasion in 1285. Ladislaus had, by that time, become so unpopular that many of his subjects accused him of inciting the Mongols to invade Hungary. After he imprisoned his wife in 1286, he lived with his Cuman mistresses. During the last years of his life, he wandered throughout the country with his Cuman allies, but he was unable to control the most powerful lords and bishops any more. Pope Nicholas IV planned to declare a crusade against him, but three Cuman assassins murdered Ladislaus.

==Childhood (1262–1272)==
Ladislaus was the elder son of Stephen V, son of Béla IV of Hungary, and Stephen&#x27;s wife Elizabeth the Cuman. Elizabeth was the daughter of a chieftain of the Cumans who had settled in Hungary. She was born as a pagan and was baptized before her marriage to Stephen. Ladislaus was born under the sign of Mars in 1262, according to Simon of Kéza, who was his chaplain in the 1270s.

Conflicts between Ladislaus&#x27;s father and grandfather developed into a civil war in 1264. Béla IV&#x27;s troops, which were under the command of Ladislaus&#x27;s aunt, Anna, captured the castle of Sárospatak, where Ladislaus and his mother were staying, and imprisoned them. Ladislaus initially was kept in the Turóc Castle by Andrew Hont-Pázmány, but two months later, he was sent to the court of Boleslaw the Chaste, Duke of Cracow, who was Béla IV&#x27;s son-in-law. After his grandfather and father made peace in March 1265, Ladislaus was set free and returned to his father.

Ladislaus&#x27;s father made an alliance with King Charles I of Sicily in September 1269. According to the treaty, Charles I&#x27;s daughter, Elizabeth, who was about four years old at that time, was engaged to the seven-year-old Ladislaus. The children&#x27;s marriage took place in 1270.

Béla IV died on 3 May 1270, and Ladislaus&#x27;s father was crowned king two weeks later; the new monarch, however, could not stabilize his rule. Béla IV&#x27;s closest advisors – Duchess Anna, and Béla IV&#x27;s former palatine, Henry Kőszegi – left Hungary and sought assistance from Anna&#x27;s son-in-law, King Ottokar II of Bohemia. The newly appointed ban of Slavonia, Joachim Gutkeled, also turned against Stephen V and kidnapped Ladislaus in the summer of 1272. Gutkeled held Ladislaus in captivity in the fortress of Koprivnica in Slavonia. Historian Pál Engel suggests that Joachim Gutkeled planned to force Stephen V to divide Hungary with Ladislaus. Stephen V besieged Koprivnica, but could not take it. Stephen fell seriously ill and died on 6 August.

===Minority (1272–1277)===

Joachim Gutkeled departed for Székesfehérvár as soon as he was informed of Stephen V&#x27;s death, because he wanted to arrange the boy–king&#x27;s coronation. Ladislaus&#x27;s mother joined him, infuriating Stephen V&#x27;s partisans who accused her of having conspired against her husband. Stephen V&#x27;s master of the treasury, Egidius Monoszló, laid siege to her palace in Székesfehérvár, but Gutkeled&#x27;s supporters routed him. Monoszló fled to Pressburg (now Bratislava, Slovakia); he captured the town and ceded it to Ottokar II of Bohemia.

Archbishop Philip of Esztergom crowned Ladislaus king in Székesfehérvár on about 3 September. In theory, the 10-year-old Ladislaus ruled under his mother&#x27;s regency, but in fact, baronial parties administered the kingdom. In November of that year, Henry Kőszegi returned from Bohemia and assassinated Ladislaus&#x27;s cousin, Béla of Macsó. Duke Béla&#x27;s extensive domains, which were located along the southern borders, were divided among Henry Kőszegi and his supporters. In retaliation for Hungarian incursions into Austria and Moravia, Austrian and Moravian troops invaded the borderlands of Hungary in April 1273. They captured Győr and Szombathely, plundering the western counties. Joachim Gutkeled recaptured the two forts two months later, but Ottokar II of Bohemia invaded Hungary and seized many fortresses, including Győr and Sopron in the autumn.

Peter Csák and his allies removed Joachim Gutkeled and Henry Kőszegi from power, but Gutkeled and Kőszegi seized Ladislaus and his mother in June 1274. Although Peter Csák liberated the king and his mother, Gutkeled and Kőszegi captured Ladislaus&#x27;s younger brother, Andrew, and took him to Slavonia. They demanded Slavonia in Duke Andrew&#x27;s name, but Peter Csák defeated their united forces near Polgárdi at the end of September. Kőszegi was killed in the battle. Peter Csák then launched a campaign against Kőszegi&#x27;s son and Ladislaus accompanied him. At the end of 1274, Rudolf I, the new king of Germany, and Ladislaus concluded an alliance against Ottokar II of Bohemia.

Ladislaus contracted an unidentified serious illness, but recovered from it. He attributed this recovery to a miracle by his deceased saintly aunt, Margaret, and approached the Holy See to promote her canonization in 1275. In the same year, a new civil war broke out between Joachim Gutkeled and Peter Csák. Ladislaus took part in Csák&#x27;s military expedition against the Kőszegis, who were Gutkeled&#x27;s supporters. However, Gutkeled and his supporters removed their opponents from power at an assembly of the barons and noblemen at Buda around 21 June 1276.

Taking advantage of the war between Rudolf I and Ottokar II, Ladislaus made an incursion into Austria in the autumn. Sopron soon accepted Ladislaus&#x27;s suzerainty and Ottokar II promised to renounce of all towns he occupied in western Hungary. However, new armed conflicts began in Hungary during 1277: the Transylvanian Saxons captured and destroyed Gyulafehérvár (now Alba Iulia in Romania), the see of the bishop of Transylvania, and the Babonići rose up in rebellion in Slavonia.

===First years of majority (1277–1278)===

Joachim Gutkeled died while battling against the Babonići in April 1277. A month later, an assembly of the prelates, barons, noblemen, and Cumans declared Ladislaus to be of age. The estates of the realm also authorized the 15-year-old monarch to restore internal peace with all possible means. Ladislaus then invaded the Kőszegis&#x27;s domains in Transdanubia, but could not defeat them. He met Rudolf I of Germany in Hainburg an der Donau on 11 November to confirm their alliance against Ottokar II of Bohemia.

After the royal army captured the rebellious Nicholas Geregye&#x27;s fortress at Adorján (now Adrian in Romania), Ladislaus held a &quot;general assembly&quot; for seven counties along the River Tisza in early summer of 1278. The assembly condemned two rebellious local noblemen to death. In Transdanubia, Ivan Kőszegi attempted to play off Ladislaus&#x27;s father&#x27;s first cousin, Andrew the Venetian, against Ladislaus. Andrew demanded Slavonia for himself, but returned to Venice without success.

Ladislaus joined forces with Rudolf I of Germany to launch a campaign against Ottokar II. Ladislaus&#x27;s troops played a decisive role in Rudolf&#x27;s victory in the Battle on the Marchfeld on 26 August. Ottokar was killed in the battlefield. After the battle, King Rudolf I gave Ladislaus &quot;his thanks, declaring that through his help all Austria and Styria had been restored to him&quot;, according to Ladislaus&#x27;s chronicler, Simon of Kéza.

===The Cuman question (1278–1285)===

Pope Nicholas III sent Philip, bishop of Fermo, to Hungary to help Ladislaus restore royal power on 22 September 1278. The papal legate arrived in Hungary in early 1279. With the legate&#x27;s mediation, Ladislaus concluded a peace treaty with the Kőszegis. Bishop Philip soon realized, however, that most Cumans were still pagans in Hungary. He extracted a ceremonious promise from the Cuman chieftains of giving up their pagan customs, and persuaded the young King Ladislaus to swear an oath to enforce the keeping of the Cuman chieftains&#x27; promise. An assembly held at Tétény passed laws which, in accordance with the legate&#x27;s demand, prescribed that the Cumans should leave their tents and live &quot;in houses attached to the ground&quot;. The Cumans did not obey the laws, however, and Ladislaus, himself a half-Cuman, failed to force them. In retaliation, Bishop Philip excommunicated him and placed Hungary under interdict in October. Ladislaus joined the Cumans and appealed to the Holy See, but the Pope refused to absolve him.

On Ladislaus&#x27;s demand, the Cumans seized and imprisoned Philip of Fermo in early January 1280. However, Finta Aba, voivode of Transylvania captured Ladislaus and handed him over to Roland Borsa. In less than two months, both the legate and the king were set free and Ladislaus took a new oath to enforce the Cuman laws. However, many Cumans decided to leave Hungary instead of obeying the legate&#x27;s demands. Ladislaus followed the moving Cumans as far as Szalánkemén (now Stari Slankamen in Serbia), but could not hinder them from crossing the frontier.

Ladislaus launched a campaign against Finta Aba and seized his castles in the summer of 1281. According to the &quot;Austrian Rhymed Chronicle&quot;, Bishop Philip of Fermo left Hungary around the same time, stating that he would never come back, &quot;not for the sake of the Holy Father&quot;. A Cuman army invaded the southern parts of Hungary in 1282. The &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; writes that Ladislaus, &quot;like the brave Joshua, went out against&quot; the Cumans &quot;to fight for his people and his realm.&quot; He vanquished the invaders&#x27;s army at Lake Hód, near Hódmezővásárhely, in the autumn of 1282.

At the end of 1282, Ladislaus laid siege to Borostyánkő (now Bernstein im Burgenland in Austria), which was held by the Kőszegis. The Kőszegis resisted, forcing the king to lift the siege in early 1283. Ladislaus even reconciled with Ivan Kőszegi and appointed him palatine before 6 July. Ladislaus abandoned his wife, Isabella, and settled among the Cumans by the end of the year.

===Last years (1285–1290)===

The Mongols of the Golden Horde invaded Hungary under the command of Khans Talabuga and Nogai in January 1285. According to the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot;, they &quot;spread a terrible devastation of fire throughout the whole country&quot; to the east of the Danube. Local forces resisted the invaders at many places, including, for example, at Regéc. The invasion lasted for two months before the Mongols withdrew.

Ladislaus&#x27;s favoritism towards the Cumans made him so unpopular that many of his subjects accused him of inciting the Mongols to invade Hungary. In fact, Ladislaus employed Mongol prisoners of war, known as &quot;nyögérs&quot;, when he subjugated a rebellion in the Szepesség in September 1285. The king preferred the Cumans&#x27; way of life, including their costumes and hairstyle, and took Cuman girls as his mistresses. According to Lodomer, archbishop of Esztergom, Ladislaus copulated with his favorite concubine, Aydua, whom the archbishop described as a &quot;poisonous viper&quot;, in public.

In September 1286, Ladislaus imprisoned his wife and granted all her revenues to his mistress. Archbishop Lodomer liberated the queen the following September. The archbishop summoned the prelates, the barons, and the noblemen to an assembly in Buda and excommunicated Ladislaus. In response, the infuriated king stated that &quot;beginning with the archbishop of Esztergom and his suffragans, I shall exterminate the whole lot right up to Rome with the aid of Tartar swords&quot;, according to Archbishop Lodomer.

The barons captured Ladislaus in the Szepesség in January 1288. Although his partisans soon liberated him, he acquiesced in concluding an agreement with Archbishop Lodomer. The archbishop absolved Ladislaus on condition that the king would live in accordance with Christian morals. However, Ladislaus broke his promise. He abducted his sister, Elizabeth, prioress of the Dominican Monastery of the Blessed Virgin on Rabbits&#x27; Island, and gave her in marriage to a Czech aristocrat, Záviš of Falkenstein. According to Archbishop Lodomer, Ladislaus even stated, &quot;If I had 15 or more sisters in as many cloistered communities as you like, I would snatch them from there to marry them off licitly or illicitly; in order to procure through them a kin-group who will support me by all their power in the fulfillment of my will&quot;.

Ladislaus spent the last years of his life wandering from place to place. Hungary&#x27;s central government lost power because the prelates and the barons ruled the kingdom independently of the monarch. For example, Ivan Kőszegi and his brothers waged wars against Albert I, Duke of Austria, but Ladislaus did not intervene, although the Austrians captured at least 30 fortresses along the western borders.

The Kőszegis offered the crown to Andrew the Venetian, who arrived in Hungary in early 1290. One of their opponents, Arnold Hahót, captured the pretender, however, and surrendered him to Duke Albert. Ladislaus appointed Mizse, who had recently converted from Islam to Christianity, palatine. Pope Nicholas IV was even planning to proclaim a crusade against Ladislaus. However, Ladislaus, who had always been partial towards his Cuman subjects, was assassinated by three Cumans, named Arbuz, Törtel, and Kemence, at the castle of Körösszeg (now Cheresig in Romania) on 10 July 1290. Mizse and the Cuman Nicholas, who was the brother of Ladislaus&#x27;s Cuman lover, took vengeance for Ladislaus&#x27;s death, slaughtering the murderers.

Upon Pope Nicholas IV&#x27;s orders, an inquiry was carried out to find out &quot;whether the king died as a Catholic Christian&quot;. The results of the investigation are unknown, but the &quot;Chronicon Budense&quot; writes that Ladislaus was buried in the cathedral of Csanád (now Cenad in Romania). His successor, Andrew the Venetian, and Pope Benedict VIII recalled Ladislaus as &quot;of renowned memory&quot;.

<text>Ladislaus I (, , , ; 1040 – 29 July 1095), also known as Saint Ladislas, was King of Hungary from 1077 and King of Croatia from 1091. He was the second son of King Béla I of Hungary and Richeza (or Adelaide) of Poland. After Béla&#x27;s death in 1063, Ladislaus and his elder brother, Géza, acknowledged their cousin Solomon as the lawful king in exchange for receiving their father&#x27;s former duchy, which included one-third of the kingdom. They cooperated with Solomon for the next decade. Ladislaus&#x27;s most popular legend, which narrates his fight with a &quot;Cuman&quot; (a Turkic nomad marauder) who abducted a Hungarian girl, is connected to this period. The brothers&#x27; relationship with Solomon deteriorated in the early 1070s, and they rebelled against him. Géza was proclaimed king in 1074, but Solomon maintained control of the western regions of his kingdom. During Géza&#x27;s reign, Ladislaus was his brother&#x27;s most influential adviser.

Géza died in 1077, and his supporters made Ladislaus king. Solomon resisted Ladislaus with assistance from King Henry IV of Germany. Ladislaus supported Henry IV&#x27;s opponents during the Investiture Controversy. In 1081, Solomon abdicated and acknowledged Ladislaus&#x27;s reign, but he conspired to regain the royal crown, and Ladislaus imprisoned him. Ladislaus canonized the first Hungarian saints (including his distant relatives, King Stephen I and Duke Emeric) in 1085. He set Solomon free during the canonization ceremony.

After a series of civil wars, Ladislaus&#x27;s main focus was the restoration of public safety. He introduced severe legislation, punishing those who violated property rights with death or mutilation. He occupied almost all Croatia in 1091, which marked the beginning of an expansion period for the medieval Kingdom of Hungary. Ladislaus&#x27;s victories over the Pechenegs and Cumans ensured the security of his kingdom&#x27;s eastern borders for about 150 years. His relationship with the Holy See deteriorated during the last years of his reign, as the popes claimed that Croatia was their fief, but Ladislaus denied their claims.

Ladislaus was canonized on 27 June 1192 by Pope Celestine III. Legends depict him as a pious knight-king, &quot;the incarnation of the late-medieval Hungarian ideal of chivalry.&quot; He is a popular saint in Hungary and neighboring nations, where many churches are dedicated to him.

== Early years (before 1064) ==

Ladislaus was the second son of the future King Béla I of Hungary and his wife, Richeza (or Adelaide), who was a daughter of King Mieszko II Lambert of Poland. Ladislaus and his elder brother, Géza, were born in Poland, where Béla had settled in the 1030s after being banished from Hungary. Ladislaus was born around 1040. Ladislaus&#x27;s &quot;physical and spiritual makeup testified to God&#x27;s gracious will even at his birth&quot;, according to his late-12th-century &quot;Legend&quot;. The almost contemporaneous Gallus Anonymus wrote that Ladislaus was &quot;raised from childhood in Poland&quot; and almost became a &quot;Pole in his ways and life&quot;. He received a Slavic name: &quot;Ladislaus&quot; is derived from &quot;Vladislav&quot;.

Béla and his family returned to Hungary around 1048. Béla received the so-called &quot;Duchy&quot;which encompassed one-third of the kingdomfrom his brother, King Andrew I of Hungary. The &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; mentions that Andrew&#x27;s son, Solomon, &quot;was anointed king with the consent of Duke Bela and his sons Geysa and Ladislaus&quot; in 1057 or 1058.

Béla, who had been Andrew&#x27;s heir before Solomon&#x27;s coronation, left for Poland in 1059; his sons accompanied him. They returned with Polish reinforcements and began a rebellion against Andrew. After defeating Andrew, Béla was crowned king on 6 December 1060. Solomon left the country, taking refuge in the Holy Roman Empire. Béla I died on 11 September 1063, some time before German troops entered Hungary in order to restore Solomon. Ladislaus and his brothers, Géza and Lampert, went back to Poland, and Solomon was once again crowned king in Székesfehérvár. The three brothers returned when the Germans left Hungary. To avoid another civil war, the brothers signed a treaty with Solomon on 20 January 1064, acknowledging Solomon&#x27;s reign in exchange for their father&#x27;s duchy.

== Duke in Hungary (1064–1077) ==

Ladislaus and Géza probably divided the administration of their duchy; Ladislaus seems to have received the regions around Bihar (now Biharia, Romania). Géza and Ladislaus cooperated with King Solomon between 1064 and 1071. The most popular story in Ladislaus&#x27;s later legendshis fight with a &quot;Cuman&quot; warrior who abducted a Christian maidenoccurred during this period. The relationship between the king and his cousins became tense in the early 1070s. When Géza accompanied Solomon on a military campaign against the Byzantine Empire in 1072, Ladislaus stayed behind with half of the ducal troops in Nyírség to &quot;avenge his brother with a strong hand&quot; if Solomon harmed Géza.

Realizing that another civil war was inevitable, the king and dukes launched negotiations to obtain the assistance of foreign powers. First, Ladislaus visited the Kievan Rus&#x27;, but he returned without reinforcements. He then went to Moravia, and persuaded Duke Otto I of Olomouc to accompany him back to Hungary with Czech troops. By the time they returned to Hungary, the royal army had already invaded the duchy and routed Géza&#x27;s troops at the Battle of Kemej on 26 February 1074. Ladislaus met his fleeing brother at Vác, and they decided to continue the fight against Solomon. A legend preserved in the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; mentions that before the battle, Ladislaus &quot;saw in broad daylight a vision from heaven&quot; of an angel placing a crown on Géza&#x27;s head. Another legendary episode also predicted the dukes&#x27; triumph over the king: an &quot;ermine of purest white&quot; jumped from a thorny bush to Ladislaus&#x27;s lance and then onto his chest. The decisive Battle of Mogyoród was fought on 14 March 1074. Ladislaus commanded &quot;the troops from Byhor&quot; on the left flank. Solomon was defeated, but instead of surrendering to his cousins, he fled to the western borders of the kingdom to seek assistance from his brother-in-law Henry IV of Germany.

Géza was proclaimed king, but Solomon established himself in Moson and Pressburg (now Bratislava, Slovakia). During his brother&#x27;s reign, Ladislaus administered all of their father&#x27;s former duchy. He repelled Solomon&#x27;s attack on Nyitra (present-day Nitra, Slovakia) in August or September 1074, but he could not seize Pressburg. Ladislaus was also his brother&#x27;s main advisor. Legend says that Géza decided to build a church dedicated to the Holy Virgin in Vác after Ladislaus explained the significance of the wondrous appearance of a red deer at the place where the church would be erected:

== His reign ==

=== Consolidation (1077–1085) ===

Géza I died on 25 April 1077. Since Géza&#x27;s sons, Coloman and Álmos, were minors, his supporters proclaimed Ladislaus king instead. Gallus Anonymus emphasizes that King Boleslaus II the Bold of Poland &quot;drove out&quot; Solomon &quot;from Hungary with his forces, and placed [Ladislaus] on the throne&quot;; Boleslaus even called Ladislaus &quot;his king&quot;. Although the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; emphasizes that Ladislaus &quot;never placed the crown upon his head, for he desired a heavenly crown rather than the earthly crown of a mortal king&quot;, all his coins depict him wearing a crown, suggesting that Ladislaus was actually crowned around 1078. Shortly after his coronation, Ladislaus promulgated two law books, which incorporated the decisions of an assembly of the &quot;magnates of the kingdom&quot;, held in Pannonhalma. The majority of these laws were draconian measures to defend private property, showing that Ladislaus primarily focused on internal consolidation and security during the first years of his reign. Those who were caught stealing were to be executed, and even criminals who committed minor offenses against property rights were blinded or sold as slaves. His other laws regulated legal proceedings and economic matters, including the issuing of judicial summons and the royal monopoly on salt trade.

The &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; claims that Ladislaus planned to &quot;restore the kingdom&quot; to Solomon and &quot;himself have the dukedom&quot;, but almost all contemporaneous sources contradict this report. Ladislaus approached Pope Gregory VII, who was the primary opponent of Solomon&#x27;s ally, Henry IV of Germany. At the Pope&#x27;s request, Ladislaus sheltered Bavarian nobles who had rebelled against Henry. In 1078 or 1079, Ladislaus married Adelaide, a daughter of Rudolf of Rheinfelden, whom the German princes had elected to take the place of Henry IV as king. Ladislaus supported Leopold II, Margrave of Austria, who also rebelled against Henry IV; however, the German monarch forced Leopold to surrender in May 1078.

Taking advantage of the internal conflicts in the Holy Roman Empire, Ladislaus besieged and captured the fortress of Moson from Solomon in early 1079. However, Henry IV stormed the western regions of Hungary, and secured Solomon&#x27;s position. The German invasion also prevented Ladislaus from assisting Boleslaus the Bold, who fled to Hungary after his subjects expelled him from Poland. Ladislaus initiated negotiations with Solomon, who abdicated in 1080 or 1081 in exchange for &quot;revenues sufficient to bear the expenses of a king&quot;. However, Solomon soon began conspiring against Ladislaus, and Ladislaus imprisoned him.

The first five Hungarian saints, including the first king of Hungary, Stephen I, and Stephen&#x27;s son, Emeric, were canonized during Ladislaus&#x27;s reign. Stephen&#x27;s canonization demonstrates Ladislaus&#x27;s magnanimity, because Ladislaus&#x27;s grandfather, Vazul, had been blinded on Stephen&#x27;s orders in the 1030s. Historian László Kontler says that the canonization ceremony, held in August 1083, was also a political act, demonstrating Ladislaus&#x27;s &quot;commitment to preserving and strengthening&quot; the Christian state. Ladislaus even dedicated a newly established Benedictine monasterySzentjobb Abbeyto Stephen&#x27;s right arm, known as the &quot;Holy Dexter&quot;, which was miraculously found intact. Ladislaus released Solomon at the time of the ceremony; legend said that Stephen&#x27;s grave could not be opened until he did so.

After his release, Solomon made a final effort to regain his crown. He persuaded a Pecheneg chieftain, Kutesk, to invade Hungary in 1085. Ladislaus defeated the invaders at the upper courses of the Tisza River.

=== Expansion (1085–1092) ===

In August 1087, German princes who opposed Henry IV&#x27;s rule held a conference in Speyer. The contemporaneous Bernold of St Blasien mentions that Ladislaus sent envoys to the meeting, and &quot;promised that he would assist [them] with 20,000 knights, if it became necessary&quot;. Ladislaus also recognized Pope Victor III as the legitimate pope, rather than Clement III, who had been elected pope at Henry IV&#x27;s initiative. However, Ladislaus provided no further support to Henry IV&#x27;s opponents after he was informed of Solomon&#x27;s death in 1087.

King Demetrius Zvonimir of Croatia&#x27;s wife, Helen, was Ladislaus&#x27;s sister. After the death of Zvonimir and his successor, Stephen II, a conflict developed between factions of Croatian noblemen. At Helen&#x27;s request, Ladislaus intervened in the conflict and invaded Croatia in 1091. The same year, he wrote to Oderizius, Abbot of Monte Cassino in Italy, about his invasion. Thomas the Archdeacon&#x27;s chronicle describes how Ladislaus &quot;occupied the entire land from the River Drava to the mountains called the Iron Alps without encountering opposition&quot;. However, his opponents crowned a local nobleman, Petar Snačić, as king. Snačić fought in the Gvozd Mountains, preventing the complete conquest of Croatia. Ladislaus appointed his nephew, Álmos, to administer the occupied territory. Around the same time, Ladislaus set up a separate diocese in Slavonia, with its see in Zagreb. The bishop of the new see became the suffragan to the archbishop of Esztergom in Hungary.

Ladislaus admitted in his letter to Oderizius that he could not &quot;promote the cause of earthly dignities without committing grave sins&quot;. Historian Bálint Hóman says that Ladislaus was referring to a developing conflict with Pope Urban II, who objected to Ladislaus&#x27;s refusal to acknowledge the Holy See&#x27;s suzerainty over Croatia. In the letter, Ladislaus styled himself as &quot;king of the Hungarians and of Messia&quot;. Historian Ferenc Makk writes that the latter title referred to Moesia, implying that Ladislaus had taken the regions between the Great Morava and Drina rivers from the Byzantine Empire. No other documents refer to Ladislaus&#x27;s occupation of Moesia, suggesting that if Ladislaus did occupy the region, he lost it quickly. Alexandru Madgearu says that &quot;Messia&quot; should rather be associated with Bosnia, which was occupied during Ladislaus&#x27;s campaign against Croatia.

The Cumans invaded and plundered the eastern part of the kingdom in 1091. The invading Cumans were leading by chieftain Kapolcs, they broke first in Transylvania, then the territory between the Danube and Tisza rivers. The Cumans tried to leave Hungary with their huge booty and prisoners, but King Ladislaus reached and defeated them near the Temes river. Ladislaus offered the Christianity for the Cuman survivors, the majority of them accepted, thus the king settled them in Jászság. The rumor of the losing battle reached the Cuman camp, the Cumans threatened King Ladislaus with revenge and demanded to free the Cuman prisoners. King Ladislaus marched to the Hungarian border to prevent the next invasion. The two armies clashed near Severin, the Hungarian army was victorious, King Ladislaus killed Ákos, the Cuman chieftain. Makk argues that the Byzantines persuaded them to attack Hungary, while the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; states that the Cumans were incited by the &quot;Ruthenians&quot;. In retaliation, the chronicle continues, Ladislaus invaded the neighboring Rus&#x27; principalities, forcing the &quot;Ruthenians&quot; to ask &quot;for mercy&quot; and to promise &quot;that they would be faithful to him in all things&quot;. No Rus&#x27; chronicle documents Ladislaus&#x27;s military action.

Bernold of St Blasien writes that Duke Welf of Bavaria prevented a conference that Emperor Henry IV &quot;had arranged with the king of the Hungarians&quot; in December 1092. A letter written by Henry refers to &quot;the alliance into which [he] once entered&quot; with Ladislaus. Pope Urban II also mentioned that the Hungarians &quot;left the shepherds of their salvation&quot;, implying that Ladislaus had changed sides and acknowledged the legitimacy of Antipope Clement III. In the deed of the Benedictine Somogyvár Abbey, Ladislaus stated that the abbot should be obedient to him, proving that Ladislaus opposed the Church&#x27;s independence, which was demanded by the Gregorian Reforms. Ladislaus personally presided over an assembly of the Hungarian prelates that met in Szabolcs on 21 May 1091. The synod recognized the legitimacy of a clergyman&#x27;s first marriage, in contrast to the requirements of canon law, which states that members of the clergy may not marry at all. According to a scholarly theory, the sees of the dioceses of Kalocsa and Bihar were moved to Bács (now Bač, Serbia) and Nagyvárad (present-day Oradea, Romania), respectively, during Ladislaus&#x27;s reign.

=== Last years (1092–1095) ===

Ladislaus intervened in a conflict between Władysław I Herman, Duke of Poland, and the duke&#x27;s illegitimate son, Zbigniew, on the latter&#x27;s behalf. He marched to Poland and captured Herman&#x27;s younger son, Boleslaus, in 1093. At Ladislaus&#x27;s demand, Władysław I Herman declared Zbigniew his legitimate son. The &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; also mentions that the Hungarian troops captured Kraków during Ladislaus&#x27;s campaign, but the credibility of this report has been questioned.

The &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; states that &quot;messengers from France and from Spain, from England and Britain, and especially from Willermus, the brother of the King of the Franks&quot; visited Ladislaus in Bodrog (near present-day Bački Monoštor in Serbia) on Easter 1095, asking him to lead their crusade to the Holy Land. Ladislaus&#x27;s legend says that he decided &quot;to go to Jerusalem, and to die there for Christ&quot;. The whole story was invented, probably during the reign of King Béla III of Hungary (who was actually planning to lead a crusade to the Holy Land in the 1190s), according to historian Gábor Klaniczay. However, Ladislaus did plan to invade Bohemia, because he wanted to assist his sister&#x27;s sons, Svatopluk and Otto. He became seriously ill before reaching Moravia. The &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; narrates that Ladislaus, who had no sons, &quot;called together his chief men&quot;, telling them that his brother&#x27;s younger son, Álmos, &quot;should reign after him&quot;.

Ladislaus died near the Hungarian-Bohemian border on 29 July 1095. A papal bull of Pope Paschal II in 1106 states that Ladislaus&#x27;s &quot;venerable body rests&quot; in Somogyvár Abbey, implying that Ladislaus had been buried in Somogyvár. On the other hand, Ladislaus&#x27;s late 12th-century &quot;Legend&quot; provides that his attendants buried him in Székesfehérvár, but the cart carrying his body &quot;set out to Várad on its own, unassisted by any draft animal&quot;.

== Family ==


Historian Gyula Kristó says that Ladislaus had a first wife, but her name and family are not known. She gave birth to a daughter, whose name is also unknown. Ladislaus&#x27;s daughter married Prince Iaroslav Sviatopolchich of Volhinia around 1090. Ladislaus married again in 1078, to Adelaide, a daughter of the German anti-king Rudolf of Swabia. Their only known child, Piroska, became the wife of the Byzantine Emperor John II Komnenos in 1105 or 1106.

Ladislaus&#x27;s family and relatives who are mentioned in the article are shown in the following family tree.



&quot;*According to a scholarly theory suggesting that Ladislaus had two wives.&quot;

== Legacy ==

===Consolidation of the Christian monarchy ===

For centuries, hagiographers and historians have emphasized Ladislaus&#x27;s prominent role in the consolidation of the Christian monarchy. The chronicles also stressed his &quot;idoneitas&quot;, or personal suitability, to reign, because the legitimacy of his rule was questionable. The &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; clearly states that Ladislaus knew that &quot;the right of law between him and [Solomon] was not on his side but only the force of fact&quot;.

After Ladislaus&#x27;s victories over the Pechenegs and the Cumans, the nomadic peoples of the Pontic steppes stopped invading Hungary until the Mongol invasion of 1241. Kristó suggests that the Székely peoplea community of Hungarian-speaking warriorsstarted settling the easternmost borderlands under Ladislaus. The &quot;historic association of the Kingdom of Hungary and Croatia&quot;, which ended in 1918, began with Ladislaus&#x27;s conquest of Croatia. His conquest marked the beginning of a period of Hungarian expansion, which ensured that Hungary developed into a leading Central European power during the following centuries. It became a customary rite for a newly crowned Hungarian king to make a pilgrimage to Ladislaus&#x27;s shrine at Várad. Louis I of Hungary, who made many attempts to expand his territory in the Balkan Peninsula, showed a special respect for Ladislaus.

=== Veneration ===


Gábor Klaniczay emphasizes that Ladislaus &quot;seemed expressly designed to personify the knight-king ideal&quot; of his age. During the reign of Ladislaus&#x27;s successor, Coloman the Learned, Bishop Hartvik said that Ladislaus&#x27;s &quot;character was distinguished by the respectability of morals and remarkable for the splendor of his virtues&quot;. The so-called &quot;Gesta Ladislai regis&quot; (&quot;The Deeds of King Ladislaus&quot;), which are the texts about Ladislaus&#x27;s life and reign preserved in 14th-century Hungarian chronicles, were written during Coloman&#x27;s rule. Five significant events of Ladislaus&#x27;s life, which were not included in his official legend, were only preserved in the &quot;Gesta&quot;.

The most popular story describes Ladislaus&#x27;s fight with a &quot;Cuman&quot; warrior after the Battle of Kerlés (at present-day Chiraleș, Romania) in 1068. In the battle, the united armies of Solomon, Géza and Ladislaus routed a band of Pechenegs or Oghuz Turks who were plundering the eastern parts of the kingdom. According to the version recorded in the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot;, Ladislaus spotted a pagan warrior fleeing from the battlefield with a captive Hungarian maiden. Ladislaus pursued the &quot;Cuman&quot;, but he could not stop him. On Ladislaus&#x27;s advice, the maiden pulled the warrior off his horse, allowing Ladislaus to kill the &quot;Cuman&quot; after a long fight on the ground. Archaeologist Gyula László says that murals depicting this legend in medieval churches preserved the elements of pagan myths, including a &quot;struggle between forces of light and darkness&quot;.

During the reign of Stephen II of Hungary, Ladislaus&#x27;s shrine in the cathedral of Várad became a preferred venue for trials by ordeal. However, it cannot be determined whether Ladislaus became subject to veneration soon after his death, or if his cult emerged after he was canonized by Béla III of Hungary on 27 June 1192. Béla had lived in the Byzantine court, where Ladislaus&#x27;s daughter, Irene, was venerated as a saint.

According to Thomas the Archdeacon, Pope Innocent III declared that Ladislaus &quot;should be enrolled in the catalogue of saints&quot;, but his report is unreliable, because Celestine III was pope at the time. Celestine III&#x27;s bulls and charters make no reference to Ladislaus&#x27;s canonization, implying that Ladislaus was canonized without the Holy See&#x27;s authorization. The nearly contemporaneous &quot;Regestrum Varadinense&quot; says that a bondsman, named &quot;Tekus, son of the craftsman Dénes&quot;, opened Ladislaus&#x27;s tomb at the beginning of the ceremony, after which Tekus was granted freedom. Parts of Ladislaus&#x27;s head and right hand were severed so that they could be distributed as relics. The 15th-century silver reliquary that contains Ladislaus&#x27;s head is displayed in the Győr Cathedral.

Ladislaus&#x27;s official legend, which was compiled after 1204, attributes a number of miracles to him. According to one of his legends, a pestilence spread throughout the kingdom during Ladislaus&#x27;s reign. Ladislaus prayed for a cure; he then shot an arrow into the air at random, hitting a herb which cured the illness. This plant became known as &quot;Saint Ladislaus&#x27;s herb&quot; in Hungary.

Ladislaus is a patron saint of Hungary, especially along the borders. In particular, soldiers and the Székely people venerate him. A late medieval legend says that Ladislaus appeared at the head of a Székely army fighting against and routing a plundering band of Tatars in 1345. He is also called upon during times of pestilence. He is often depicted as a mature, bearded man wearing a royal crown and holding a long sword or banner. He is also shown on his knees before a deer, or in the company of two angels.

King Sigismund of Hungary died on 1437, and as ordered in life, he was buried at Várad (now Oradea), next to the tomb of the King Saint Ladislaus, who was the ideal of the perfect monarch, warrior and Christian for that time and was deeply venerated by Sigismund.

== Herma of King Saint Ladislaus and genetics ==

The skull relic in the Saint Ladislaus&#x27; Herma preserved in the Cathedral Basilica of Győr, is one of the most important relics for Hungarians.

King Saint Ladislaus of Hungary completed the work of King Saint Stephen of Hungary, consolidating Hungarian state power and strengthening Christianity in Hungary. His charismatic personality, strategic leadership and military talents resulted the termination of internal power struggles and foreign military threats. He was seen as the embodiment of the knight-king ideal to be emulated all over Europe. He was canonized in 1192 at the request of King Béla III of Hungary, and his body was exhumed to prepare relics from his skull and other skeletal remains as was the custom in that medieval times.

According to historian György Szabados, Gyula László proved already in 1965 that the face of the Saint Ladislaus&#x27; Herma depicts King Béla III. The skull reconstruction of the Royal Basilica&#x27;s tomb find in Székesfehérvár also shows the face of the Herma, which is not surprising, because King Ladislaus had already been dead for 97 years in 1192, so only the then living king from the same family, Béla III was worthy to sit as a model for the creation of the face of the Herma.

The wooden herm containing the skull was damaged in a fire in 1406, but miraculously the skull has been preserved unharmed. Later it was placed into the current Herma created during the reign of King Sigismund of Hungary. In the 16th century, the relic had to be rescued from Várad due to the ravage of Transylvania by the Protestants. In the first decades of the 17th century, it reached its current location in the Cathedral of Győr after passing through Prague, Pozsony (now Bratislava) and Veszprém.

The turbulent history events of the Herma raised doubts concerning the authenticity of the relic by historians and archaeologists. At that time, the only Árpád dynasty king, the remains of King Béla III had known and identified, because little earlier, the Institute of Hungarian Research determinated the whole genome data of King Béla III which was published in 2020. Thus the Hungarian scholars were able to compare the paternal Y chromosome sequence of the skull to that of King Béla III from whom a whole genome data was available.

On 4 June 2021, Endre Neparáczki collected a sample from the skull of the herm, during his researches so far, they isolated from the sample one of the best own extracted endogenous DNA. The Institute of Hungarian Research defined the genetic composition of the skull found in the herm and it was published in 2023. The result supported the originality of Saint Ladislaus relic, the Y chromosome of the skull belongs to the exclusive haplogroup of the Árpád-dynasty R-ARP (R1a1a1b2a2a1c3a3b) and the kinship analysis detected the skull is at five generations distance from King Béla III.

The R-ARP sub-haplogroup belongs to the R-Z2123 clade, the phylogenetic analysis suggested a Bronze Age BMAC origin of the R-Z2123 sub-haplogroup which belongs to the R-Z2125 clade, which was detected in individuals from the Middle-Late Bronze Age on the Caspian Steppe, connected to the Potapovka, Sintashta and Andronovo cultures. In the Iron Age, this haplogroup was detected in the Turan basin and in Scytho-Siberians of the Minusinsk Basin, later among the Asian Huns (Xiongnus) and up until the Middle Ages in Mongolia which indicates an eastward and southward spread of the haplogroup. The first appearance of R-Z2125 in the Carpathian Basin was detected in 5th-century European Huns, and 7th–8th-century Avars, but it also arrived with the conquering Hungarians, in the 9th–10th century including Árpád and his family. The basic premise of the Hungarian medieval chronicle tradition (for example in the Chronicon Pictum) that the Huns, i.e. the Hungarians coming out twice from Scythia, the guiding principle was the Hun-Hungarian continuity. The genomic analyses of the Hungarian royal Árpád family members are in line with the reported conquering Hungarian-Hun origin of the dynasty in harmony with their Y-chromosomal phylogenetic connections.

The Institute of Hungarian Research published a genetic study in 2022 in which 113 Hungarian conqueror samples were analyzed. The results of the genome analysis of King Saint Ladislaus confirmed that the Árpád dynasty originated from the same ethnic group as other members of the Hungarian conqueror elite (i.e. from semi-nomadic tribes originating in central and east Asia), and that he had higher genetic affinity to the these Hungarian conquerors than later Hungarian royalty that succeeded him. King Saint Ladislaus had more Eastern genomic heritage than his later relatives, on the PCA genetic map he shifted slightly eastward from the cloud of modern European populations, while the genome of King Béla III was projected near modern Hungarians and Croatians, because the Central Asian genomes were progressively attenuated during the centuries through dynastic marriages with European royal families.

Saint Ladislaus became the first saint in the world whose identity was confirmed by archaeogenetic tests.

<doc id="161742" wikidata="Q470731" url="?curid=161742" title="Archie Moore">
<text>Archie Moore (born Archibald Lee Wright; December 13, 1913 – December 9, 1998) was an American professional boxer and the longest reigning World Light Heavyweight Champion of all time (1952 – 1962). He had one of the longest professional careers in the history of the sport, competing from 1935 to 1963. Nicknamed &quot;the Mongoose&quot;, and then &quot;the Old Mongoose&quot; in the latter half of his career, Moore was a highly strategic and defensive boxer. As of December 2020, BoxRec ranks Moore as the third greatest pound-for-pound boxer of all time. He also ranks fourth on &quot;The Ring&quot;s list of &quot;100 greatest punchers of all time&quot;. Moore was also a trainer for a short time after retirement, training Muhammad Ali, George Foreman, Bob Foster, Eddie Mustafa Muhammad, Earnie Shavers and James Tillis.

Born in Benoit, Mississippi, Moore was raised in St. Louis, Missouri, and grew up in poverty. Moore was denied a shot at the world title for 15 years, and spent many of those years fighting on the road with little to show for it. An important figure in the American Black community, he became involved in African American causes once his days as a fighter were over. He also established himself as a successful character actor in television and film. Moore died in his adopted home of San Diego, California; he was 84 years old.

==Early life==
Moore was born Archibald Lee Wright, the son of Thomas Wright, a farm laborer and drifter, and Lorena Wright. He always insisted that he was born in 1916 in Collinsville, Illinois, his mother told reporters that he was actually born in 1913 in Benoit, Mississippi. His father abandoned the family when Archie was an infant. Unable to provide for him and his older sister, his mother gave them into the care of an uncle and aunt, Cleveland and Willie Pearl Moore, who lived in St. Louis. Archie later explained why he was given their surname: &quot;It was less questions to be called Moore.&quot;

He attended segregated all-Black schools in St. Louis, including Lincoln High School, although he never graduated. His uncle and aunt provided him with a stable upbringing, but after his uncle died in a freak accident around 1928, Moore began running with a street gang. One of his first thefts was a pair of oil lamps from his home, which he sold so that he would have money to buy boxing gloves. He later recalled of his stealing: &quot;It was inevitable that I would be caught. I think I knew this even before I started, but somehow the urge to have a few cents in my pocket made me overlook this eventuality&quot;. After he was arrested for attempting to steal change from a motorman&#x27;s box on a streetcar, he was sentenced to a three-year term at a reform school in Booneville, Missouri. He was released early from the school for good behavior after serving twenty-two months.

Around 1933 Moore joined the Civilian Conservation Corps, working for the forestry division at a camp in Poplar Bluff, Missouri. Determined to become a boxer, he decided to make his work at the camp a form of training. He later recalled that the other boys constantly kidded him about one daily exercise—standing upright in the bed of a truck as it drove along primitive forest roads, waiting until the last possible moment before ducking or weaving away from tree branches.

== Boxing career ==

The captain of the camp permitted him to organize a boxing team, which competed in Golden Gloves tournaments in southern Missouri and Illinois. Many of his fights occurred in a racially charged atmosphere; he later described one of them, against a white boxer named Bill Richardson in Poplar Bluff:I knocked him down with a volley of head punches about one minute into round one. His brother ... was the referee. He was furious at me and told me to keep my punches up. Since I had been hitting Bill in the head I would have missed him altogether if I threw my punches any higher. But the referee said I had fouled him. ... I got steamed at this and offered to fight [the referee], too. I resolved not to hit Bill any place but his head. ... In the second round I dropped him with a left hook that spun his head like a top. ... I heard a man at ringside say, &quot;For two cents I&#x27;d shoot that nigger.&quot;

===First retirement and comeback===

Moore had four fights in 1941, during which he went 2–1–1, with the draw against Eddie Booker. By then, however, he had suffered through several stomach ulcers and the resulting operations, and had announced his retirement from boxing.

His retirement was brief. By 1942 he was back in the ring. He won his first six bouts that year, including a second-round knockout of Hogue in a rematch, and a ten-round decision over Jack Chase. He met Booker in a rematch, and reached the same conclusion as their first meeting had: another 10-round draw.

In 1943, Moore fought seven bouts, winning five and losing two. He won and then lost the California State Middleweight title against Chase, both by 15-round decisions, and beat Chase again in his last bout of that year, in a ten-round decision. He also lost a decision to Aaron Wade that year.

===The Atlantic Coast===

In 1944, he had nine bouts, going 7–2. His last bout that year marked his debut on the Atlantic Coast, and the level of his opposition began to improve. He beat Jimmy Hayden by a knockout in five, lost to future Hall of Famer Charlie Burley by a decision, and to Booker by a knockout in eight.

He won his first eight bouts of 1945, impressing Atlantic coast boxing experts and earning a fight with light heavyweight Jimmy Bivins, a boxer that was not considered a hard puncher, who defeated Moore by a knockout in six at Cleveland. He returned to the Eastern Seaboard to fight five more times before that year was over. He met, among others, light heavyweight Holman Williams during that span, losing a ten-round decision, and knocking him out in eleven in the rematch.

By 1946, Moore had moved to the light heavyweight division and he went 5–2–1 that year, beating contender Curtis Sheppard, but losing to future World Heavyweight Champion and Hall of Famer Ezzard Charles by a decision in ten, and drawing with old nemesis Chase. By then, Moore began complaining publicly that, according to him, none of boxing&#x27;s world champions would risk their titles fighting him. 1947 was essentially a year of rematches for Moore. He went 7–1 that year, his one loss being to Charles. He beat Chase by a knockout in nine, Sheppard by a decision in ten and Bivins by a knockout in nine. He also defeated Burt Lytell, by a decision in ten.

On June 2, 1948, Leonard Morrow (12–2–1) KO’d Archie Moore (92–14–7) in the first round to win the California light heavyweight championship.

Years later when asked about the fight with Morrow, Archie would claim he had accidentally fouled Morrow and reached out his hand as a sign of an apology, but this wasn&#x27;t what happened. He had also forgotten he had told the newspapers what had really happened while he was in California before his fight with Bob Dunlap, saying, “I never dreamed this kid could hurt me. I thought I’d spar a bit and see what he had. He hit me hard. I got up and he swarmed all over me. Never was I so humiliated.”

He fought a solid 14 fights in 1948, losing again to Charles by a knockout in nine, losing to Henry Hall by a decision in ten and to Lloyd Gibson by a disqualification in four. But he also beat Ted Lowry, by a decision in ten, and Hall in a rematch, also by decision.

In 1949, he had 13 bouts, going 12–1. He defeated the &quot;Alabama Kid&quot; twice; by knockout in four and by knockout in three, Bob Satterfield by a knockout in three, Bivins by a knockout in eight, future World Light Heavyweight Champion and IBHOF inductee Harold Johnson by a decision, Bob Sikes by a knockout in three and Phil Muscato by a decision. He lost to Clinton Bacon by a disqualification in six. By Moore&#x27;s standards, 1950 was a vacation year for him: he only had two fights, winning both, including a 10-round decision in a rematch with Lydell.

In 1951, Moore boxed 18 times, winning 16, losing one, and drawing one. He went on an Argentinian tour, fighting seven times there, winning six and drawing one. In between those seven fights, he found time for a trip to Montevideo, Uruguay, where he defeated Vicente Quiroz by a knockout in six. He knocked out Bivins in nine and split two decisions with Johnson.

===World Light Heavyweight Champion===
1952 was one of the most important years in Moore&#x27;s life. After beating Johnson, heavyweight contenders Jimmy Slade, Bob Dunlap, and Clarence Henry and light heavyweight Clinton Bacon (knocked out in four in a rematch), Moore was finally given an opportunity at age 36 (he later learned he was actually nearly 39, his mother confirming he had been born in 1913, not 1916) to fight for the title of World Light Heavyweight Champion against future IBHOF honoree Joey Maxim. Maxim had just defeated the great Sugar Ray Robinson by a technical knockout in 14 rounds, forcing Robinson to quit in his corner due to heat exhaustion. Against Maxim, Moore consistently landed powerful right hands, hurting him several times en route to a fifteen-round decision. After sixteen long years, he had finally achieved his dream. The next year, Moore won all nine of his bouts, including a 10-round, non-title win against then fringe heavyweight contender Nino Valdez of Cuba and a 15-round decision over Maxim in a rematch to retain the belt. He made two more bouts in Argentina before the end of the year.

In 1954, he had only four fights, retaining the title in a third fight with Maxim, who once again went the 15 round distance, and versus Johnson, whom he knocked out in 14. He also beat highly ranked heavyweight Bob Baker. In 1955, Moore again beat Valdez, who by that time was the no. 1 heavyweight contender, and defended against Bobo Olson, the World Middleweight Champion and future Hall of Famer who was coming off a decision victory over Joey Maxim, by a knockout in three.

&quot;The Mongoose&quot; received two cracks at the heavyweight championship of the world. On September 21, 1955, Moore faced future Hall of Famer Rocky Marciano at New York&#x27;s Yankee Stadium. The fight was originally scheduled for September 20, according to Trilogy Book. It was in this fight Archie came closest to wearing the belt. A Moore surprise right hand in the 2nd round sent Marciano down for the second and final time in his career, setting the stage for a legendary battle, but also creating controversy as far as shared memory. In subsequent years Moore made much of Referee Harry Kessler&#x27;s handling of the pivotal moment. A half-decade on, in Archie&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;The Archie Moore Story&quot; (1960), he describes in detail the referee, though Rocky arose at &quot;two&quot;, continuing a superfluous mandatory eight-count: &quot;...Kessler went on, three, four. The mandatory count does not apply in championship bouts (1955)...My seconds were screaming for me to finish him and I moved to do so, but Kessler...carefully wiped off Rocky&#x27;s gloves, giving him another few seconds...he gave him a sort of stiff jerk, which may have helped Rocky clear his head.&quot; Moore admits to being angry enough at what he saw as interference, he went recklessly, &quot;blind and stupid with rage&quot;, going for the knockout, toe-to-toe. This resentment toward referee Kessler appears only to have grown more entrenched. By the time of a recorded interview with Peter Heller, in October, 1970, Archie had this to say: &quot;(Kessler) had no business refereeing that match because he was too excitable. He didn&#x27;t know what to do...He grabbed Marciano&#x27;s gloves and began to wipe Marciano&#x27;s gloves and look over his shoulder...I&#x27;ll never forget it. It cost me the heavyweight title.&quot;

This grudge, however, was not mutual. In his own autobiography, Harry Kessler indeed recounts Marciano-Moore with a great excitement, frequently employing exclamation marks in his punctuation, going so far as a direct comparison to the donnybrook between Jack Dempsey and Luis Firpo. Yet, the third man is evenhanded in his praise, taking time over most of a chapter on the bout, to laud Moore. His praise for Moore include the following quotes:
&quot;Archie had exuded a stalwart confidence from his training camp...&quot;
&quot;Archie Moore had more punches in his arsenal than Robin Hood and all his Merry Men had arrows in their quivers...&quot;
&quot;Archie Moore was probably as sure a fighter as ever set foot in the ring...&quot;
&quot;No one ever questioned Archie Moore&#x27;s courage...&quot;.
As for the knockdown, described here also in detail, Kessler offers a perspective directly contradicting Moore&#x27;s, saying &quot;I didn&#x27;t bother to wipe Marciano&#x27;s gloves on my shirt before I waved them back to combat; that early in the drama, there was no resin on the canvas.&quot; As opposed to any blind rage, Kessler states that &quot;Archie hesitated a couple of seconds before he came in.&quot; With humor and without malice, Kessler even recounts the 41-year-old Moore poo-pooing any talk of retirement at the postfight press conference, then sitting in on bass fiddle at a hotspot in Greenwich Village until 5 a.m.!
Examination of the original, uncut closed circuit broadcast from 1955, shows no excesses in referee involvement. Marciano arises at &quot;two&quot;, but the voice of Al Berl, assigned the counting for knockdowns, continues to &quot;four&quot;. In harmony with Archie&#x27;s further 1960 description, Marciano has moved to the ropes and rests an elbow. Moore is already moving toward him. Kessler flashes onscreen quickly, then away again, as though he had meant to separate the fighters. He is perpendicular to Marciano&#x27;s chest, and his right hand waves rapidly near Rocky&#x27;s left glove. Kessler reverses out as fast as he has come into frame, with no wiping of Marciano&#x27;s gloves, and the action resumes. Marciano recovered, and went on to knock Moore down five times, finally knocking him out in the ninth to retain the belt. It was Marciano&#x27;s sixth and last title defense, before retiring in 1956.

In 1956, Moore fought mostly as a heavyweight but did retain his Light Heavyweight title with a ten-round knockout over Yolande Pompey in London. He won 11 bouts in a row before challenging again for the World Heavyweight Championship. The title was left vacant by Marciano, but Moore lost to Floyd Patterson by a knockout in five (Patterson, yet another future Hall of Famer, himself made history that night, becoming, at the age of 21, the youngest World Heavyweight Champion yet, a record he would hold until 1986).

Moore won all six of his bouts during 1957. Among those wins was an easy 10-round decision over heavyweight contender Hans Kalbfell in Germany, a knockout in 7 rounds over highly ranked Tony Anthony to retain the light heavyweight title, a one-sided 10-round decision over light heavyweight contender Eddie Cotton in a non-title bout and a 4th-round knockout of future top ten heavyweight contender Roger Rischer.

In 1958, Moore had 10 fights, going 9–0–1 during that span. His fight with Yvon Durelle in particular was of note: defending his world light heavyweight title in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, he was felled three times in round one, and once again in round five, but then dropped Durelle in round 10 and won by a knockout in the 11th. 1959, his last full year as uncontested champion, was another rare low-profile year; in his two fights, he beat Sterling Davis by a knockout in three, and then Durelle again, also by a knockout in three, to once again retain his World Light Heavyweight title.

In 1960, Moore was stripped of his World Light Heavyweight title by the National Boxing Association (NBA), but continued to be recognized by most major boxing authorities including the New York State Athletic Commission and The Ring Magazine. Moore won three of his four bouts in 1960, one by decision against Buddy Turman in Dallas, his lone loss coming in a ten-round decision versus Giulio Rinaldi in Rome. In 1961, he defeated Turman again by decision in Manila, Philippines before defending his Lineal World Light Heavyweight Championship for what would be the last time, beating Rinaldi by a 15-round decision to retain the belt. In his last fight that year, he once again ventured into the heavyweights, and met Pete Rademacher, a man who had made history earlier in his career by becoming the first man ever to challenge for a world title in his first professional bout (when he lost to Patterson by a knockout in six). Moore beat Rademacher by a knockout in nine.

In 1962, the remaining boxing commissions that had continued to back Moore as the World Light Heavyweight Champion withdrew their recognition. He campaigned exclusively as a heavyweight from then on, and beat Alejandro Lavorante by a knockout in 10 and Howard King by a knockout in one round in Tijuana. He then drew against future World Light Heavyweight Champion Willie Pastrano in a 10-round heavyweight contest. On the posters advertising that fight, Moore was billed as the &quot;World Light Heavyweight Champion.&quot; The bout took place in California, which had not yet withdrawn recognition from Moore at the time the Moore-Pastrano fight was signed. By the time the bout took place, the California commission, like New York, Massachusetts, the EBU and Ring Magazine, had recognized Harold Johnson, who had beaten Doug Jones 16 days earlier, as the new Light Heavyweight Champion. Johnson had reigned as the NBA (WBA) Champion since February 7, 1961.

Then, in his last fight of note, the 49 year-old Moore faced a young heavyweight out of Louisville named Cassius Clay (Muhammad Ali). Moore had been Clay&#x27;s trainer for a time, but Clay became dissatisfied and left Moore because of Moore&#x27;s attempts to change his style and his insistence that Clay do dishes and help clean gym floors. In the days before the fight, Clay had rhymed that &quot;Archie Moore...Must fall in four.&quot; Moore replied that he had perfected a new punch for the match: The Lip-Buttoner. Nonetheless, as Clay predicted, Moore was beaten by a knockout in four rounds. Moore is the only man to have faced both Rocky Marciano and Muhammad Ali. After one more fight in 1963, a third-round knockout win over Mike DiBiase in Phoenix, Moore announced his retirement from boxing, for good.

==Post-retirement==

Despite retiring, Moore couldn&#x27;t escape the limelight, and received numerous awards and dedications. In 1965, he was given the key to the city of San Diego, California. In 1970, he was named &quot;Man of The Year&quot; by &quot;Listen Magazine&quot;, and received the key to the city of Sandpoint, Idaho. He was elected in 1985 to the St. Louis city Boxing Hall of Fame and he received the Rocky Marciano Memorial Award in the city of New York in 1988. In 1990, he became a member of the International Boxing Hall of Fame in Canastota, New York, being one of the original members of that institution.

At one point the oldest boxer to win the World&#x27;s Light Heavyweight Championship, he is believed to have been the only boxer who boxed professionally in the eras of Joe Louis, Rocky Marciano and Muhammad Ali. He is one of only a handful of boxers whose careers spanned four decades, retiring with a final record of 185 wins, 23 losses, 11 draws and 1 no contest, with 131 official knockouts.

However, at least three of Moore&#x27;s 131 knockouts came in less-than-competitive matches against pro wrestlers: &quot;Professor&quot; Roy Shire in 1956, Sterling Davis in 1959 and Mike DiBiase in 1963 (Moore&#x27;s 131st and final knockout). All three matches are officially listed as third-round TKO stoppages. The second-highest amount of knockouts in boxing history is 128, which belongs to Sam Langford .

During the 1960s he founded an organization called Any Boy Can, which taught boxing to underprivileged youth in the San Diego area. In 1974 he helped train heavyweight boxer George Foreman for his famous &quot;Rumble in the Jungle&quot; title bout in Zaire against Muhammad Ali. In 1976 he served as an assistant coach for the Nigerian Olympic boxing team. Actively involved in efforts to teach children about the dangers of drug abuse, he worked during the 1980s as a youth boxing instructor for the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, assigned largely to ghettos in San Diego and Los Angeles. &quot;I try to pass on the arts I know: self-control, self-reliance, self-defense,&quot; he told a reporter. In the early 1990s he again worked as a trainer for George Foreman.

==Acting career==
In 1960, Moore was chosen to play the role of the runaway slave Jim in Michael Curtiz&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;, based on the Mark Twain novel, opposite Eddie Hodges as Huck. Moore garnered positive reviews for his sympathetic portrayal of Jim, which some viewers still consider the best interpretation of this much-filmed role.

Moore did not choose to pursue a full-time career as an actor, but he did appear in films such as &quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot; (1964), &quot;The Hanged Man&quot; (1964) and &quot;The Fortune Cookie&quot; (1966), and on television in episodes of &quot;Family Affair&quot;, &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, &quot;The Reporter&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot; (episode 35) and the soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. He also appeared in the critically acclaimed TV movie &quot;My Sweet Charlie&quot;. His later film appearances included the crime film &quot;The Outfit&quot; (1973), as a chef in &quot;Breakheart Pass&quot; (1975) with Charles Bronson, and a cameo role as himself in the 1982 film &quot;Penitentiary II&quot;, along with Leon Isaac Kennedy and Mr. T.

==Humanitarian==
Boxing took Moore all over the world as a fighter, a civil rights activist, and a leader in the fight to influence the minds of the nation&#x27;s youth. He arrived in Argentina in June 1951 for a rematch with the champion Abel Cestac. Moore&#x27;s victory made headlines and caught the attention of the Argentinian President Juan Perón and his wife Eva for his selfless act helping children, buying them shoes, clothing, and building their confidence. Moore was invited to stay in Argentina and accept an appointment as the Minister of Welfare of Children. He declined the offer to continue his road to winning title fights.

In 1957, Moore founded Any Boy Can, a non-profit organization based in San Diego, California. ABC, as it was known, provides services to all who seek help regardless of age, race, creed, religion or national origin. Moore stated that the mission of ABC is to help the youth to &quot;step off in life with their best foot forward.&quot; The students were taught good sportsmanship, respect, and confidence. They were instructed to look a person in the eye and give them a firm handshake. They addressed him as Instructor Moore.

Word traveled fast about Moore&#x27;s ABC program. He was invited to Jamaica and sponsored by the Jamaican Boxing Board of Control to train boys for the Olympics. He trained 600 boys using his ABC methods.

In 1968, the ABC Foundation received the Freedom Foundation&#x27;s Patriotism Award, a special citation for providing a challenge for youth to become contributing members of their communities and upholding the ideals and ideas that were present at the founding of our great nation. This recognition is one of many.

Based on his work with the youth, in 1981, Moore became the Presidential Appointee of Ronald Reagan to work under Samuel R. Pierce, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Under the national heading, Project Build, Moore taught boxing to underprivileged youth in and around the housing projects in California.

Moore applied the philosophy and mechanics of his ABC program and until his death, he believed that &quot;Any Body Can.&quot;

==Personal life==

Archie Moore had three daughters, Reena, J&#x27;Marie and Elizabeth Moore-Stump, and four sons, Archie Jr., Hardy, Anthony and D&#x27;Angelo. The marriage of Archie Moore and Elizabeth Thorton produced Archie Jr. and Elizabeth. In 1956, he married Joan Hardy and had five children: Reena, J&#x27;Marie, Hardy, Anthony and D&#x27;Angelo. They were married until his death in 1998.

Moore joined the Seventh-day Adventist Church later in life.

In 1997, J&#x27;Marie Moore became the first daughter of a famous boxer to herself become a professional boxer.

==Death==
Moore died of heart failure on December 9th, 1998, four days short of his 85th birthday. He was cremated and is interred in a niche at Cypress View Mausoleum and Crematory, in San Diego.
