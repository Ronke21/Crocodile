<text>Silat Melayu (Jawi: ), also known as &quot;Seni Persilatan Melayu&quot; (&#x27;art of Malay Silat&#x27;) or simply &quot;Silat&quot;, is a combative art of self-defence from the Malay world, that employs &quot;langkah&quot; (&#x27;steps&#x27;) and &quot;jurus&quot; (&#x27;movements&#x27;) to ward off or to strike assaults, either with or without weapons. Silat traced its origin to the early days of Malay civilisation, and has since developed into a fine tradition of physical and spiritual training that embodies aspects of traditional Malay attire, performing art and &quot;adat&quot;. The philosophical foundation of modern Malay Silat is largely based on the Islamic spirituality. Its moves and shapes are rooted from the basis of Silat movements called &quot;Bunga Silat&quot;, and Silat performances are normally accompanied with Malay drum assembles.

The term Silat is also employed to refer to similar fighting styles in areas with significant Malay cultural influence, in modern-day Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Philippines, and Vietnam. In Indonesia, the term Pencak Silat, a composite term introduced in the late 1940s, deriving from the Sundanese/Javanese word &quot;Penca(k)&quot; and Malay/Sumatran word &quot;Silat&quot;, has been used officially since 1973 as an umbrella term of traditional martial arts of Indonesia. In Malay terminology, the term &#x27;Pencak Silat&#x27; is also used, but more in referring to the exoteric aspect of the fighting style, in contrast to the esoteric aspect of Silat called &quot;Seni Silat&quot; (&#x27;the art of Silat&#x27;). In other words, &#x27;pencak&#x27; (fighting) can be regarded as the &quot;zahir&quot; (outer/exoteric knowledge), whilst &quot;seni&quot; pertains to the whole of Silat including &quot;batin&quot; (inner/esoteric knowledge) and &quot;zahir&quot;. &quot;Seni Silat&quot; is thus considered to be a deeper level of understanding. Therefore, it is said that each aspect of Silat emanates from &quot;seni&quot; (art), including both the fighting and the dance aspects.

Regionally, Silat is governed by PERSIB (National Pencak Silat Federation of Brunei Darussalam) in Brunei, PESAKA (National Silat Federation of Malaysia) in Malaysia and PERSISI (Singapore Silat Federation) in Singapore. These governing bodies, together with IPSI (Indonesian Pencak Silat Association), are the founding members of International Pencak Silat Federation (PERSILAT). The sport version of Silat is one of the sports included in the Southeast Asian Games and other region-wide competitions, under the name &#x27;Pencak Silat&#x27;. Pencak silat first made its debut in 1987 Southeast Asian Games and 2018 Asian Games, both were held in Indonesia. Silat was recognized as a piece of Intangible Cultural Heritage by UNESCO in 2019.

==Etymology==
Owing to lack of written records, the origin of the word &#x27;silat&#x27; remains uncertain. The use of the term &#x27;silat&#x27; in referring to Malay martial arts was somewhat absent from contemporary writings from the 15th to 16th centuries. The &quot;Hikayat Hang Tuah&quot; that was written by the end of the 17th century, with warrior stories form its main repertoire, does not employ the word ‘silat’, but uses other terms like &quot;ilmu perang&quot; (&#x27;military knowledge&#x27;), &quot;ilmu hulubalang&quot; (&#x27;knowledge of Hulubalang&#x27;), &quot;ilmu prajurit&quot; (&#x27;knowledge of soldiers’), in referring to the Malay martial arts.

The earliest known mention of ‘silat’ in &quot;Misa Melayu&quot;, written sometimes between 1720 and 1786, was rather generic in nature and not specifically referring to the Malay martial arts. It was used as a generic term in describing the movements of kuntao as performed by Chinese folks. In this regard, the word &#x27;silat&#x27; is thought to originate from the composite of two words &#x27;si&#x27; and &#x27;elat&#x27;. &#x27;Si&#x27; is a Malay article used with adjectives to describe people, and normally found in names and nicknames. While &#x27;elat&#x27; is a verb means &#x27;to trick&#x27;, &#x27;to confuse&#x27; or &#x27;to deceive&#x27;. The derivative transitive verb &#x27;menyilat&#x27; or &#x27;menyilap&#x27; carries the meaning of an action to evade, to trick or to take an assault, together with a counterattack. This implies that the term &#x27;silat&#x27; is a generic term in origin, referring to any forms of martial arts that involve such movements, before it began to specifically refers to Malay martial arts. In the 19th century literary texts, reference to &#x27;silat&#x27; as a specific martial art of Malay people began to appear, for example in &quot;Hikayat Pahang&quot;, &quot;Hikayat Awang Sulung Merah Muda&quot;, Hikayat Malim Deman and many others.

Alternative views from oral literature point the word to Arabic origin. &#x27;Silat&#x27; is said to derive from the Arabic word &#x27;silah&#x27; (سِلَاح) meaning &#x27;weapon&#x27; or &#x27;silah&#x27; (صِلَةُ) meaning &#x27;connection&#x27;. Over the time, the word is believed to has been malayised into &#x27;Silat&#x27; in similar way the word &quot;karamah&quot; (كرامة) was malayised into &quot;keramat&quot; (کرامت) (&#x27;sacred&#x27;) and the word &#x27;hikmah&#x27; (حكمة) was malayised into &quot;hikmat&quot; (حکمت) (&#x27;supernatural power&#x27;). This etymological root suggests that Silat is philosophically based on the teaching of Islam, which over the centuries, have become the source of a Malay identity. The use of the Arabic word serves as a tool in elaborating the philosophy of both Malay culture and art itself. The &#x27;connection&#x27; in the etymology suggests that Silat covers aspects in the relationship between humans, between humans and their enemies, and between human and nature, and ultimately attaining the spirituality, that is the relationship between human and their creator.

Other etymological root suggests that the word is said to derive from &#x27;silap&#x27; (to make a mistake). This means that using the opponent&#x27;s strength against them—in their strength lies their weakness. This strength could be physical or psychological. Others suggested that it originated from the word &quot;sekilat&quot; meaning &quot;as fast as lightning&quot; derived from &quot;kilat&quot; (lightning); &quot;sila&quot; (as in silsilah or chain) indicating the transmission of Silat from guru to murid (disciple of Silat or other religious or secular knowledge); and more mysteriously, from the Arabic &quot;solat&quot; (prayer), although linguists regard solat as an unlikely candidate for the etymological root of &#x27;Silat&#x27;. Other contenders for the etymological root of &#x27;Silat&#x27; include the &#x27;Orang Selat&#x27; (an indigenous Malay people of Singapore), and selat as in &quot;Selat Melaka&quot; (the Straits of Malacca). English-language publications are sometimes mistakenly refer to Silat Melayu as &quot;bersilat&quot; but this is actually a verb form of the noun Silat, literally meaning &quot;to perform Silat&quot;.

==History==
===Early period===
The genesis of traditional Malay martial arts has been attributed to the need for self-defense, hunting techniques and military training in ancient Malay world. Hand-to-hand combat and weapons practice were important in training warriors for combat in human warfare. Early traditional fighting styles believed to have been developed among various Malayic tribes from the dawn of the Malayic civilisation, 2000 years ago. Movements of these early fighting styles epitomize the movements of various animals such as the crocodile, tiger and eagle, and deeply influenced by ancient Malay animism. As the expanding Iron Age civilisations on the Mainland Southeast Asia engaged in wars and diplomacy, it led to the advancement of the art of war, weaponry and martial arts skills.

Early Malays and the related Chams, were the only sizable Austronesians that had established themselves since the Iron Age on the Mainland Southeast Asia among the Austroasiatic inhabitants. Some scholars like Hall and Blust argued that even the earlier Funanese were Austronesians, and by the early centuries of Christiann era, a single dialect chain of Austronesian languages would have extended almost unbroken from the Malay Peninsula to Champa. The expansion of the Khmers into the region of the Mekong Delta would then have divided an earlier language continuum into two separate and smaller dialects. By the 2nd century CE, the early Austronesian settlements that centered around present day Southern Vietnam and the Kra Isthmus region of the Malay Peninsula and its peripheries, had developed into strong kingdoms like Champa, Langkasuka and Kedah. The Chams were particularly known as formidable warriors who were great exponents of martial arts. Their exceptional skills in warfare were gained through their long intermittent conflicts with neighbouring kingdoms. The discovery of prototypes of bronze kris in Southern Vietnam, with hilt decorated by human figure, dating back to more than 2000 years ago, further indicated that the Chams had developed an advanced martial arts tradition. Even centuries later, their martial prowess were still held in high regards among people in Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, as the legends of prominent Cham warriors made its way in the Malay Annals and &quot;Tambo&quot; of Minangkabau people. &quot;Tambo&quot; for example, recounts the legend of a Cham warrior who goes by the name Harimau Campo (&#x27;tiger of Champa’). Together with Kuciang Siam, Kambiang Hutan and Anjiang Mualim, they developed the early Minangkabau &quot;silek&quot;.

The early fighting styles are also thought to have been developed in Langkasuka, another important Austronesian polity of Mainland Southeast Asia. Langkasuka that is widely regarded as the progenitor of Pattani Kingdom, along with the culturally-related Kedah, are earliest kingdoms of the Malay Peninsula. The martial prowess of people in the Pattani region is well recounted in many Malay legends, an indication of a long established martial arts tradition since the ancient times. &quot;Hikayat Hang Tuah&quot; narrates that the people of Pattani were known for their advanced martial art skills and their army were not easily subdued by the Melakan forces. The oldest form of silat still in existence, &quot;Silat Tua&quot; (&#x27;ancient silat&#x27;) which is strongly rooted in animism, is originated from Pattani and according to the local legends, was once practiced by Hang Tuah himself.

An important development of martial arts of the Malay world is also attributed to the foreign influence. The infusion of foreign elements were not only obtained through wars and conquests, but also through trade and diplomacy. The growth in trade relations brought in foreign influence throughout the early primordial Austronesian ancient states, most importantly in cultural traits including the combative arts. The influence from both Chinese and Indian martial arts can be observed from the use of weapons such as the Indian mace and the Chinese sword. During this period, formalised combat arts were believed to have been practiced in the Champa, Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. From the 12th century, the martial arts were further developed in Langkasuka under Srivijaya after Chola Empire was expelled from Sumatra and Malay Peninsula.The Riau Archipelago is particularly noted in its role in the development of Malay martial arts. Its people Orang Laut also called Orang Selat are stereotyped as sea pirates, but historically played major roles in the times of Srivijaya and later sultanates of Melaka, and Johor. The fighting styles developed in this area are described by different writers as a crude prototype of Malay martial arts and one of the progenitors of modern Malay Silat.

===Islamic era===

The Malay martial arts reached its historical peak with the rise of Islam during the 15th century under the Melaka Sultanate. The era is known for the infusions of Islamic philosophy and elements of sufism, or Islamic mysticism, in silat. Literary texts mentioned some notable sufis like Makhdum Sadar Jahan who was a teacher for Sultan Ahmad Shah, as well as Sheikh Mansur who taught Hang Tuah the knowledge of &quot;tasawuf&quot;. The era also saw the introduction of Baju Melayu that became the common uniform of silat practitioners until today.

The Melakan era that lasted until the early 16th century is also a popular setting for the stories and legends in classical Malay literature. Numerous exploits of warriors are recounted in famous literary texts like the &quot;Malay Annals&quot; and &quot;Hikayat Hang Tuah&quot;. In the &quot;Malay Annals&quot;, the martial prowess of the Malay rulers and nobility is dramatically recounted in many colourful vignettes, for example, that of Sultan Alauddin personally apprehending thieves in flight. These legends are important because they establish the principle of the divine rule of kings, kings who are said to be the shadow of god on earth, and because they firmly tie divine right to the war machine, silat. The &quot;Hikayat Hang Tuah&quot; narrates the life of the legendary Laksamana Hang Tuah, a renowned formidable exponent of martial arts, whose exploits are still recounted today as an integral part of the cultural legacy of silat. His duel with one of his companions, Hang Jebat is the famous depiction of a silat duel in literature and art, and has also become the most controversial subject in Malay culture, concerning on the questions of unconditional loyalty and justice. In early literature, the Malay martial arts were generally known as &quot;ilmu perang&quot; (&#x27;military knowledge&#x27;), &quot;ilmu hulubalang&quot; (&#x27;knowledge of Hulubalang&#x27;), &quot;ilmu prajurit&quot; (&#x27;knowledge of soldiers&#x27;) in literature.

Foreign influences, like in pre-Islamic era Malay Peninsula, plays important role in shaping various cultural aspects in Melakan society. The Malay Annals recorded an enclave of Chams among many foreign enclaves in the city of Melaka. The Chams who arrived after the sack of Champa’s capital Vijaya in 1471, were said to be instrumental in the development of martial arts in Melakan era. They were known to have been held in high esteem by the Malay kings for their knowledge in martial arts and for being highly skilled in the art of war. Since it was common back then for prominent fighters to be elevated to head war troops and received ranks or bestowals from the raja, Chams also rose in ranks, filling important positions within the sultanate. During the reign of Sultan Mansur Shah, a Cham prince named Indera Brama was appointed as a senior minister in Melakan court, an indication of their importance.

From the 15th century onwards, Malayisation spread many Malay traditions including language, literature, martial arts, and other cultural values throughout Maritime Southeast Asia. Historical accounts note close relationship between Melaka and Brunei Sultanates, leading to the spread of Silat through the region from as early as the 15th century. Brunei&#x27;s national epic poem, the &quot;Syair Awang Semaun&quot;, recounts the legend of a strong and brave warrior Awang Semaun who contributed extensively to the development of Brunei, and who is also said to be the younger brother of Awang Alak Betatar or Muhammad Shah (1405–1415), the first Sultan of Brunei. The fifth Sultan, Bolkiah, who ruled between 1485 and 1524, excelled both in martial art and diplomacy. Under the seventh Sultan, Saiful Rijal (1575–1600), the sultanate was involved in the Castilian War against the Spanish Empire in 1578, and they would have used Silat and invulnerability practices. Thereafter, several patriots excelled as warriors, including Pengiran Bendahara Sakam under the reign of Sultan Abdul Mubin (1600–1673). As Brunei rose to the status of a maritime power at the crossroads of Southeast Asia, it built the unity of the kingdom through war and conquest, and managed to extend its control over the coastal regions of modern-day Sarawak and Sabah and the Philippines Islands, which were under the Sultanate&#x27;s control for more than two centuries.

===Colonial and modern era===
In the 16th century, conquistadors from Portugal attacked Malacca in an attempt to monopolise the spice trade. The Malay warriors managed to hold back the better-equipped Europeans for over 40 days before Malacca was eventually defeated. The Portuguese hunted and killed anyone with knowledge of martial arts so that the remaining practitioners fled to more isolated areas. Even today, the best silat masters are said to come from rural villages that have had the least contact with outsiders.

For the next few hundred years, the Malay Archipelago would be contested by a string of foreign rulers, namely the Portuguese, Dutch, and finally the British. The 17th century saw an influx of Minangkabau and Bugis people into the peninsula from Sumatra and south Sulawesi respectively. Bugis sailors were particularly famous for their martial prowess and were feared even by the European colonists. Between 1666 and 1673, Bugis mercenaries were employed by the Johor Empire when a civil war erupted with Jambi, an event that marked the beginning of Bugis influences in local conflicts for succeeding centuries. By the 1780s the Bugis had control of Johor and established a kingdom in Selangor. With the consent of the Johor ruler, the Minangkabau people formed their own federation of nine states called Negeri Sembilan in the hinterland. Today, some of Malaysia&#x27;s silat schools can trace their lineage directly back to the Minangkabau and Bugis settlers of this period.
After Malaysia achieved independence, Tuan Haji Anuar bin Haji Abd. Wahab was given the responsibility of developing the nation&#x27;s national silat curriculum which would be taught to secondary and primary school students all over the country. On 28 March 2002, his Seni Silat Malaysia was recognised by the Ministry of Heritage and Culture, the Ministry of Education and PESAKA as Malaysia&#x27;s national silat. It is now conveyed to the community by means of the &quot;gelanggang bangsal&quot; meaning the martial arts training institution carried out by silat instructors. Malaysian Silat by December 2019, received recognition from UNESCO as part of Malaysian Intangible Cultural Heritage.

==Styles==
===Brunei===
Silat in Brunei shares characteristics common in the Malay world, but it has also developed specific techniques and practices of its own. Silat as a performing art is traditionally accompanied by an orchestra called &quot;gulintangan&quot; or &quot;gulingtangan&quot; (literally: ‘rolling hands’), often composed of a drum (&quot;gandang labik&quot;) and eight gongs, including a thin gong (&quot;canang tiga&quot;) and a thick gong (&quot;tawak-tawak&quot;). There are several styles being practiced in Brunei, and some are influenced by a range of elements from Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. The most widespread is Gerak 4 1, created by H. Ibrahim, and consisting of the four styles learnt from his masters: Panca Sunda, Silat Cahaya, Silat Kuntau and Silat Cakak Asli. Some of the other styles include Kembang Goyang, Kuntau Iban, Lintau Pelangi (originally from Belait), Pampang Mayat, Pancasukma, Perisai Putih (originally from the East Javanese school Setia Hati), Persatuan Perkasa, Persatuan Basikap, Selendang Merah (‘the red scarf’), Silat Sendi, Tambong, Teipi Campaka Puteh, Gayong Kicih or Kiceh, Gayong Tiga or Permainan Tiga (which includes Gayong, Cimande and Fattani), and Cengkaman Harimau Ghaib.

The different styles of Silat are often practiced among different nationalities, and not according to specific territorial borders. Nevertheless, the foreign influences are rarely clearly expressed by the practitioners. There are many Filipinos and Indonesians in Brunei as migrant workers, but due to their significantly lower social status, the influence of the styles developed in their original countries are not that clearly visible among local styles. This is contributed in part, by the royal and aristocratic status of Silat itself in Malay society, in contrast to its peasant martial arts status in other society. At the same time, a variety of local styles fell under the nationalisation drive for a common tradition of Bruneian Silat, bringing other styles of different indigenous groups that occupied the territories that were formerly part of Brunei, into isolation. This led to the abandonment of many details of the Silat practices in favor of a national homogeneity.

In the end, two most widespread styles were established as national ones; &quot;Silat Cakak Asli&quot; and &quot;Silat Kuntau&quot;, which both be seen as complementing each other. &quot;Cakak Asli&quot; focuses more on relaxed moves but sticky-hand techniques in a close combat, to ultimately unbalance the opponent, and hit with the knees, elbows and forehead. Kuntau prioritizes various forms of punches and kicking, and normally done in fast and harsh movements, therefore making it hard to perform lock in a close range combat. These two styles have been patronized in the sultanate for many generation of rulers, but with lack of written records, it is hard to trace their origins and development in Brunei. The 29th sultan, Omar Ali Saifuddien III, was known for having learnt both &quot;Silat Cakak Asli&quot; and &quot;Silat Kuntau&quot; and he promoted local Silat in the 1950s, notably by organizing tournaments at the palace.

===Malaysia===
Silat practiced in Malaysia are diverse, with vast differences in training tools, methods and philosophy across different schools and styles. The variety of styles not only demonstrated many different combat skills, but also the ability of the martial art itself in manifesting different personages and community in warrior traditions. Some forms of Silat also exist especially in the very remote villages, with members consisting of a few students. The modern law and regulations require that the Silat bodies need to be registered as an association or club. Therefore, we find that those silat forms with very few members are those which are being practiced in a secretive way in remote areas and are taught only by invitation of the master. Based on the data from 1975, there were 265 styles of Silat in Malaysia, which in turn grouped into 464 different Silat associations throughout the country. Today, there are 548 associations or communities which actively practicing Silat in Malaysia. Out of these, four associations are the most prominent and became the founding members of &quot;Majlis Silat Negara&quot; (&#x27;National Silat Council&#x27;) in 1978, later renamed &quot;Persekutuan Silat Kebangsaan Malaysia&quot; or PESAKA (The National Silat Federation of Malaysia).

The first two associations are &quot;Seni Gayung Fatani Malaysia&quot; and &quot;Silat Seni Gayung Malaysia&quot; that represent a style called &quot;seni gayong&quot; (modern spelling &quot;seni gayung&quot;). The word &quot;gayung&quot; in Malay literally means to assault using blades like parang or sword, or it can also can means &#x27;martial art&#x27; and synonymous to Silat itself. &quot;Gayung&quot; also means &quot;single-stick,&quot; a weapon that is associated with magical powers in Malay literature. For the Malay martial artist, &quot;gayung&quot; is a verb that describes the action of dipping into the well of the unseen, to draw out mystical power for use in this world. Seni Gayung is a composite style, incorporating both Malay Silat and elements from Bugis fighting styles. It is visually distinctive from other Malay styles of Silat due to its emphasis upon performance acrobatics, including flips, diving rolls, somersaults, and handsprings. The student learns to competently handle several weapons, notably the &quot;parang&quot;, &quot;lembing&quot; (spear), &quot;sarung&quot; and the &quot;kris&quot;.

The next association is &quot;Seni Silat Cekak Malaysia&quot; that represents a style called &quot;Silat Cekak&quot;. &quot;Silat cekak&quot; was originally developed in the Kedah Court, and has been practiced by senior commanders of Kedah army in wars fought against the Siamese. The style is said to has been developed specifically to counter the Thai fighting style, Muay Thai or known locally as &quot;tomoi&quot;. It is one of the most popular Silat styles in Malaysia, first registered as an association in Kedah in 1904, and for Malaysia generally in 1965. &quot;Cekak&quot; in Malay means to &#x27;claw&#x27; or to seize the opponent. It is renowned for its series of &quot;buah&quot; (combat strategy) which have been influential in the development of more recent silat styles in Malay Peninsula, including &quot;seni gayung&quot;. Unlike most of styles of Silat, &quot;Silat Cekak&quot; is known for its non-ceremonious nature with no emphasis in graceful dance-like movements. It is a defensive-type of Silat that applies 99% defending techniques and only 1% attacking techniques. The style has no &quot;kuda-kuda&quot; stances commonly found in other Silat styles, and it does not utilize any evading nor side stepping techniques in mortal combat. As a result, it is hard to predict movements and counter-attacks of this style.

The last association is &quot;Seni Silat Lincah Malaysia&quot; that represents a style called &quot;Silat Lincah&quot;. &quot;Silat Lincah&quot; is said to originate from another older style of Melaka called &quot;Silat Tarah&quot;, allegedly practiced by Hang Jebat himself, one of the companions of Hang Tuah. The word &quot;tarah&quot; in Malay means to sever as in cut off, and the term was considered too aggressive for the use of masses, thus it was changed to &quot;Lincah&quot;. &quot;Lincah&quot; means fast and aggressive which is the principle of the style, that emphasise aggressive movements both in defense and attacking techniques in punches and kicks. The style favors evasion with follow up sweeps, locks and chokes that do not relate to dueling techniques used with a kris. Similar to &quot;Silat Cekak&quot;, &quot;Silat Lincah&quot; put little emphasis to graceful dance-like movements.

===Singapore===
Despite its status as a global city, Singapore still retains a large part of its cultural heritage including Silat. Historically, Silat development in Singapore is closely related to the mainland Malay Peninsula, owing to its status as an important city in Malay history from classical to modern era. There are styles being practiced are influenced by a range of elements from both Malaysia and Indonesia, and there are also styles that locally developed and spread to other neighboring countries especially Malaysia. Seni Gayong, one of the biggest Silat styles in Malaysia, was founded in the early 1940s by Mahaguru Datuk Meor Abdul Rahman on Pulau Sudong seven kilometres south of Singapore. Having inherited the art from his maternal grandfather, Syed Zainal Abidin Al-Attas, a prominent pendekar from Pahang, he transformed the style from a parochial past time to a regimented and highly organised form of self defense during the troubled years of the Japanese occupation.

Another notable style originated from Singapore is called &quot;Silat Harimau&quot; established by Mahaguru Haji Hosni Bin Ahmad in 1974. The styles that inspired by the movements of tiger began to gain popularity in 1975 not only in Singapore but also in Malaysia. It was recognised by the Malaysian Martial Arts Federation, as a native Silat of Singapore that represents the city state in various competitions and demonstrations. Haji Hosni went on to establish another style called &quot;Seni Silat Al-Haq&quot;. It is a style that derives its &quot;buah&quot; (combat strategy) from both &quot;Seni gayung&quot; and &quot;Silat Cekak&quot;, and considered as a more aesthetically polished (&quot;halus&quot;) style of Seni gayung. There are many other styles of Silat currently found in Singapore but nearly a third of the styles are the result from Haji Rosni&#x27;s adaptations and innovations. For example, where there was &quot;Silat Kuntao Melaka&quot;, he created &quot;Silat Kuntao Asli&quot;, and in the place of &quot;Silat Cekak&quot;, he created &quot;Cekak Serantau&quot;.

===Thailand===
The southernmost provinces of Thailand, located on the Malay Peninsula, are culturally and historically related to the states of Malaysia. Similarities are not only found in the spoken language, but also in a variety of Malay cultural aspects including Silat. Despite being suppressed and subjected to Thaification by the central government, the practice of Silat still finds its widespread currency in those provinces. Many different forms of Silat can be found in the Malay Muslim communities in Pattani, Yala, and Narathiwat as well as Saba-yoy and Thebha districts from the Songkhla province at its northern reaches, and with southern form s down through Malaysia. Historically, the Thai part of the peninsula and the Malaysian side, have been influencing each other&#x27;s styles of Silat for centuries. Silat in Southern Thailand had also significant influence in the development of Thai martial art called Krabi–krabong.

&quot;Silat Tua&quot;, an important Silat style that has an intimate relationship with four elements of nature (earth, water, fire and wind) as understood from its roots in animism, is said to originate from Pattani region. Silat Tua is directly translated as ‘old’ or ‘ancient’ Silat. Described as the &#x27;Malay dance of life&#x27;, &quot;Silat Tua&quot; does not has sets of rigid instructions as well as the endless pre-arranged movement patterns like most traditional martial arts, rather it is an art that begins with &#x27;natural movement&#x27;, focusing on the strengths and weaknesses of the exponent and the potential of the individual body. What is focused instead are basic principles and uses of imagery that are immortalised in freestyle movement known as a &quot;tari&quot; (&#x27;dance&#x27;). As Pattani was constantly at war with the neighbouring kingdom of Siam, many combative developments in the art were made in this region leading Silat Tua to take on another name, Silat Pattani.

==Uniform==

The Silat uniform may varies according to different schools and locality but generally can be divided into three types; training, ceremonial, and formal dress. The most important dress is for the training, which commonly consist of a baggy black trousers and a black long sleeved baju melayu. Some schools require the practitioners to wear belts (&quot;bengkung&quot;) during training, with different colours signifying different rank, a practice adopted from the belt system of Japanese martial arts, while some silat schools replace the bengkung with a modern buckled belt. Headdress is optional but donning a black bandana is popular. Female practitioners may replace the bandana with an Islamic veil (tudong), or left their hair uncovered except when uttering prayers at the beginning and end of the training sessions. A sarong can also be worn along with a roll of cloth which could be used as a bag, a blanket or a weapon. In Seni Gayong, a wide red cloth sash is wrapped several times around the waist and ribs of the practitioner as a type of supple armour to protect the body against spear thrusts. Generally, every part of the uniform has a special function, for example, the headdress or bandana doubles as a bandage, and the sash may be used as weapon as well. Nevertheless, some schools use a modern uniform consisting of a T-shirt and pants topped with a short sarong. Others may not even have any official uniform and allow the students to dress as they normally would, so that they become accustomed to fighting in their daily attire.

The ceremonial dress (&quot;baju istiadat&quot;) is more elaborate compared to the training dress and usually worn during special cultural events. This type of dress originated from the 15th century&#x27;s full Malay costume, which was the trademark of warriors, panglima and hulubalang. For female practitioners, the ceremonial dress is in the form of baju kurung. The dress consists of the normal baju melayu for male, but its most distinctive feature is the inclusion of a headdress called tengkolok or &quot;tanjak&quot; and a waistcloth (&quot;sampin&quot; or &quot;likat&quot; in Thailand). The headdress is traditionally made from songket cloth and they can be tied in many different styles depending on status and region. While the waistcloth is also commonly made from songket, some can be made from batik and sarong cloth as well. There are a number of ways to tie it but the popular old style used by warriors was the &quot;sampin silang&quot; which allows for freedom of movement and easy access to weapons worn at the side. Full ceremonial dress also include the traditional short jacket (&quot;baju sikap&quot;), sandals (&quot;capal&quot;) and weapons. A poem from &quot;Hikayat Awang Sulung Merah Muda&quot; describe in details the full ceremonial dress of a Malay warrior.

The final type of dress is the formal dress which commonly worn during religious functions. For male, the dress consists of the traditional baju melayu worn together with sampin and a black hat called songkok. This is considered the common style of Malay dress for male, which has been elevated to the national dress in Malaysia and Brunei. For female practitioners, the ceremonial dress is normally similar to the formal dress in the form of baju kurung.

The formal training area of Silat is called &quot;gelanggang&quot; in Malay, or sometimes known as &quot;bangsal Silat&quot;. The term &quot;gelanggang&quot; literally means &#x27;arena&#x27; or &#x27;court&#x27;, and may also refer to any space used for competitive activities. The traditional &quot;gelanggang&quot; is located outdoors, in a specially built part of the village or a jungle clearing. It can be either in the form of sand or grass court, and would be enclosed by a simple fence made of bamboo and covered in nipah or coconut leaves to prevent outsiders from stealing secrets. The entrance of the traditional &quot;gelanggang&quot; commonly consists of two poles (&quot;penjuru&quot;) upon which wrapped layers of cloth which have been blessed (&quot;jampi&quot;) by the guru or cikgu to prevent spirits from entering the arena. Each pole in the gelanggang is also blessed by the guru in order to &#x27;fence in&#x27; or &#x27;protect&#x27; (&quot;pagar&quot;) the area, and neutralize all evils or potentially evil influences in it. Practitioners are also expected to adhere to strict &#x27;taboo&#x27; (&quot;pantang larang&quot;) whenever they are in the &quot;gelanggang&quot; to maintain discipline in training. Training start right after the night prayer or Isha and can continue up until midnight everyday, except for the night before Friday.

Before training can begin, the &quot;gelanggang&quot; must be prepared either by the guru or senior students in a ritual called &quot;opening of training&quot; (&quot;upacara buka gelanggang&quot; ). The purpose of this mandatory ritual is to clear the mind and to establish concentration and focus. In its traditional form, the ritual starts by cutting some limes into water and then walking around the area while sprinkling the water onto the floor. The guru walks in a pattern starting from the centre to the front-right corner, and then across to the front-left corner. They then walk backwards past the centre into the rear-right corner, across to the rear-left corner, and finally ends back in the centre. The purpose of walking backwards is to show respect to the &quot;gelanggang&quot;, and any guests that may be present, by never turning one&#x27;s back to the front of the area. Once this has been done, the teacher sits in the centre and recites an invocation so the space is protected with positive energy. From the centre, the guru walks to the front-right corner and repeats the invocation while keeping the head bowed and hands crossed. The right hand is crossed over the left and they are kept at waist level. The mantra is repeated at each corner and in the same pattern as when the water was sprinkled. As a sign of humility, the guru maintains a bent posture while walking across the training area. After repeating the invocation in the centre once more, the teacher sits down and meditates. Although most practitioners today train in modern indoor &quot;gelanggang&quot; and the invocations are often replaced with Islamic prayers, this ritual is still carried out in some form or another.

Until the early 19th century, the teaching of Silat through the &quot;gelanggang&quot; system was largely informal and the methods may vary between different schools of Silat. In 1840, Syeikh Abd.Rahman Tohir, a Silat master hailing from Pattani is said to had established a Silat education system called &quot;Gelanggang Bangsal&quot; in Pendang, Kedah. The system seek to embody the various aspects of Silat including the art, defense, music and spiritual into a standard Silat education for the masses. In 1976, Haji Anuar Abdul Wahab initiated the development of a Silat curriculum based on the &quot;gelannggang bangsal&quot; system, which in turn became the basis of Seni Silat Malaysia curriculum.

==Music==

The silat performance, either in the form of competitive sport, or of highly stylized dance-like performance, are always accompanied by a type of music called &#x27;martial arts drum&#x27; (&quot;gendang silat&quot;). Normally performed by a small orchestra, the music served to energize the performers and heighten the engagement of the audience in silat competitions and demonstrations for wedding receptions, official occasions, as well as for combat scenes in dramatic performances like Bangsawan, Mak yong or Mek Mulung theaters. It is also increasingly performed on its own as music for festive occasions or casual gatherings.

Gendang silat is predominant across the northern region of Malay Peninsula. The region prompted tunes and manners of playing that have been adopted as common practices by gendang silat performers elsewhere. There are two major ensemble styles originated from this region that differ in approaches to playing and musical repertoire; the west coast &quot;lagu silat&quot; style found in Kedah and its neighbours, and the east coast style of Kelantan, Terengganu and Pattani. In addition to these predominant styles, there are myriad vernacular styles, for example, upper Pahang two-drums and a gong ensembles that resemble those of their northern neighbours, but do not use a melodic instrument.

Based on the instruments, the northern ensembles are relatively similar. Both include a pair of gendang barrel-shaped drums of two sizes, the larger of the pair is referred as the &#x27;mother&#x27; drum (&quot;pengibu&quot; or just &quot;ibu&quot;) and the smaller one as the &#x27;child&#x27; (&quot;penganak&quot; or &quot;anak&quot;). Included in the ensemble is a hanging knobbed gong that may vary in size, shape and material construction. The gendang play loud rhythms in interlocking style, accenting specific beats. On every other beat, the knobbed gong is struck with a padded beater. Melodies are played using a reef aerophone called &quot;serunai&quot;. It is generally blown using a circular or continuous breathing technique, and provides a lively melodic line in eighth- and sixteenth- note movement throughout the silat performance. The music is polyphonic and features a melodic line, percussive rhythmic patterns and a periodic gong unit played on the single gong. It begins in a slow tempo and accelerates until the performance climaxes.

Gendang silat tunes are categorised into three separate repertoires depending on their performance context. The first being the martial art pieces (&quot;lagu silat&quot;, &quot;paluan silat&quot;), which accompany combat demonstrations of silat, and muay thai (&quot;tomoi&quot;) for wedding receptions, competitions, and other public events. They are usually named based on their origins; for example &quot;Lagu Silat Kedah&quot; (&#x27;Kedah martial arts piece&#x27;) and &quot;paluan Kelantan&quot; (&#x27;Kelantan drumming&#x27;). Next are the processional tunes (&quot;lagu berarak&quot;) which are pieces played for short parades heralding the arrival of dignitaries such as newlyweds or government officials. They can be in the form of specific parade music or inspired from local folk tunes. There are also entertainment pieces (&quot;lagu hiburan&quot;) that are often played on the same occasions as the previous two categories, as well as in casual gatherings at private home and training centers (&quot;gelanggang&quot;). This large heterogeneous category includes among its sources folk tunes, old Malay pop songs as well as various interpretations of both global and regional tunes.

Gendang silat music in general, functions to reflect and enliven the various phases of a silat demonstration and competition. A good example of how music and movement interrelate may be seen and heard in a piece known as &quot;Lagu Silat Kedah&quot; which is used as the current standard gendang silat competition piece.

==Performance==

Silat can be divided into a number of types, the ultimate form of which is duel silat. In this type, the opponents can be either one group against another or between individuals, performing either a real combat or an entertaining performance for the audience. Another type of silat is called ritual silat held upon commonly during the shamanic ritual rites and performances. For instance, the ritual silat is an integral part of the healing rite of &quot;main puteri&quot;, featuring an unarmed duel performed by a warrior shaman accompanied by war tune. A type of ritual silat also called &quot;silat yawor&quot; in Pattani, is a silat dance with a &quot;kris&quot; performed within the Burung Petala Processions. Ritual silat is also performed during the ritual ceremony of paying homage to either martial or performing art masters, known as &quot;adat sembah guru&quot; or &quot;wai khru&quot; in Southern Thailand. Silat practitioners believe that by showing respect to their teacher during the ceremony, it will ensure their success during the performance. It is a traditional pre-performance rite that contributes to their confidence and safety that silat practitioners maintain no matter what type of silat they perform.

The third type of silat is called silat dance that aims to highlight the dramatic features of the silat&#x27;s movements, poses and its transitions. This type of silat includes both solo and pair performances and comes with elegant dance-like sequences, performed with the accompaniment silat music. It functions as a means of entertainment or celebration through dance and may sometimes used for light contact game. Silat dance is commonly incorporated in either highly choreographed performances like in traditional theatres and demonstrations, or in more spontaneous performances like in wedding silat. It is usually incorporated in dramatic performances like Bangsawan, Mak yong or Mek Mulung theatres. An example of silat from this category is called &quot;silat taghina&quot; in Southern Thailand normally performed with slow tempo music. Other example which is the most prominent of this category is called &quot;silat pulut&quot;. Literally means &#x27;sticky rice silat&#x27; in Malay, it was named after the sticky rice or &quot;pulut&quot; which traditionally presented to players after performance. It goes by various other names such as &quot;gayong pulut&quot;, &quot;silat tari&quot; (&#x27;dance silat&#x27;), &quot;silat sembah&quot; (&#x27;obeisance silat&#x27;), &quot;silat pengantin&quot; (&#x27;wedding silat&#x27;) and &quot;silat bunga&quot; (&#x27;flower silat&#x27;).

===Silat Pulut===

Silat pulut utilises agility in attacking and defending oneself. In this exercise, the two partners begin some distance apart and perform freestyle movements while trying to match each other&#x27;s flow. One attacks when they notice an opening in the opponent&#x27;s defences. Without interfering with the direction of force, the defender then parries and counterattacks. The other partner follows by parrying and attacking. This would go on with both partners disabling and counter-attacking their opponent with locking, grappling and other techniques. Contact between the partners is generally kept light but faster and stronger attacks may be agreed upon beforehand. In another variation which is also found in Chinese qinna, the initial attack is parried and then the defender applies a lock on the attacker. The attacker follows the flow of the lock and escapes it while putting a lock on the opponent. Both partners go from lock to lock until one is incapable of escaping or countering.

Silat pulut is held during leisure time, the completion of silat instruction, official events, weddings or festivals where it is accompanied by the rhythm of &quot;gendang silat&quot; (silat drums) or &quot;tanji silat baku&quot; (traditional silat music). As with a tomoi match, the speed of the music adapts to the performer&#x27;s pace.

British colonists introduced western training systems by incorporating the police and sepoys (soldiers who were local citizens) to handle the nation&#x27;s defence forces which at that time were receiving opposition from former Malay fighters. Consequently, silat teachers were very cautious in letting their art become apparent because the colonists had experience in fighting Malay warriors. Thus silat pulut provided an avenue for exponents to hone their skills without giving themselves away. It could also be used as preliminary training before students are allowed to spar.

Despite its satirical appearance, silat pulut actually enables students to learn moves and their applications without having to be taught set techniques. Partners who frequently practice together can exchange hard blows without injuring each other by adhering to the principle of not meeting force with force. What starts off as a matching of striking movements is usually followed by successions of locks and may end in groundwork, a pattern that is echoed in the modern mixed martial arts.

===Others===
Silat performance in Southern Thailand can be categorised in a number of ways. Based on the tempo of movements, it can be divided into four types, &quot;Silat Tari Yuema&quot; consisting medium-paced movements, &quot;Silat Tari Lagoh Galae&quot; with its fast sequences, &quot;Silat Tari Eena&quot; with its slow, flowing and beautiful movement sets, and lastly &quot;Silat Tari Sapaelae&quot; with its very quick movements imitating a warrior in battle.

Another categorisation is based on the mode of the performance and the type of movement featured, either with weapons or bare hand. &quot;Silat Yatoh&quot; is performed as a contest using the rules of attack and defense, in which a pair of combatants take turns attacking and defending. Secondly, &quot;Silat Tari&quot; refers to a silat featuring graceful bare-handed stances and movement sequences choreographed to the music&#x27;s tempo, which traditionally performed for royalty and high dignitaries. The third type is &quot;Silat Kayor&quot; that features combat using &quot;kris&quot; usually performed at night for entertainment.

===Literature===
The exploits of Malay warriors are prominently featured in many classical texts in Malay history. The Malay Annals for example, contains stories of heroic struggles of a number of warrior figures like Badang, or even a female warrior like Tun Fatimah. Although not specifically mentioning the term &#x27;silat&#x27;, the annals did narrates the demonstration of &quot;berlayam&quot; (dancing with a sword and shield) of a Melakan warrior, an indication that the silat&#x27;s dance-like and graceful movements have been in existence since the days of Melaka Sultanate. In addition to the annals, accounts of the adventure of Malay warriors can also be found in another classical text, &quot;Hikayat Hang Tuah&quot;. The epic literature tells the stories of Hang Tuah and his four companions, who with their exceptional skill in martial art and warfare, rose in fame to become the Melaka&#x27;s foremost &quot;Hulubalang&quot;. The text also recounts arguably the most famous silat duel in literature, that is the kris-fighting between Hang Tuah and one of his companions, Hang Jebat. Various artistic genres have attempted to re-interpret and re-invent this epic over at least the last hundred years. The &quot;Hikayat Hang Tuah&quot;, in full or in part, has been recast as movies, short stories or novels, comics, plays, musicals, stories, novels and poems.

Another notable literary text, the &quot;Hikayat Merong Mahawangsa&quot; contains similar theme of the adventure of the warrior king Merong Mahawangsa who founded the ancient Kedah state. In &quot;Hikayat Malim Deman&quot;, the detailed silat movements are mentioned in a pantun to describe the agility and powerful martial art skill of the main character in defeating his foes in his quest. By the 18th century, the term &#x27;silat&#x27; was first mentioned in a literary text called &quot;Misa Melayu&quot;, though it tends to refer as ‘martial art’ in general. Silat movements or &quot;bunga&quot; and dance, are the main components of the tradition of &quot;bersilat&quot;, that became part of the repertoire of &quot;Hikayat Awang Sulung Merah Muda&quot;. The &quot;Hikayat Pahang&quot;, a historical literature that covers the period of the 19th century, is concerned on several wars fought by the state of Pahang like Pahang Civil War and Klang War, and also contain the exploits of famous silat masters in Pahang history, like Tok Gajah, Dato&#x27; Bahaman and Mat Kilau.

Malay oral literature also contains stories of prominent warriors, some of which are associated with real historical figures, while others are considered folk tales. The legend of Siti Wan Kembang is one of such stories, that recounts the life of a Queen thought to have ruled Kelantan in the 17th century. She was described as an expert sword fighter and horse rider who lead and won various battles. The legend of Walinong Sari on the other hand, tells the story of a princess of Pahang renowned for her mastery in silat who had defeated a celestial king.

===Film===
Silat have been present in Malay cinema since the 1950s. Major studios centred in Singapore, Shaw Brothers and Cathay-Keris, have produced a number of well-known classics in a genre known as &quot;purba&quot; (&#x27;ancient&#x27;) films, that features the traditional Malay warriors and silat, and largely based on fictional stories, folklores or even history. One particularly famous title was &quot;Hang Tuah&quot; released in 1956. It is based on the &quot;Hikayat Hang Tuah&quot; and recognised as the first Malay movie to be fully shot in Eastman colour film. Other notable titles include &quot;Semerah Padi&quot; (1956), &quot;Musang Berjanggut&quot; (1959), &quot;Pendekar Bujang Lapok&quot; (1959), &quot;Seri Mersing&quot; (1961), &quot;Hang Jebat&quot; (1961), &quot;Panglima Besi&quot; (1964), &quot;Enam Jahanam&quot; (1969) and &quot;Serikandi&quot; (1969).

By the late 70s and throughout the 1980s, when the centre of Malay film productions was shifted to Kuala Lumpur, the popularity of &quot;purba&quot; films began to wane when Malay cinema was dominated by more female-oriented genres such as women&#x27;s films, family melodramas and romance. There were however still emerged a number of fully-fledged and better choreographed action-martial arts films like &quot;Loceng Maut&quot; (1976), &quot;Pendekar&quot; (1977) and &quot;Anak Sulong Tujuh Keturunan&quot; (1982). While purba films became increasingly rare on-screen in the 90s, two films revisited the story of Hang Tuah, but combining both &quot;purba&quot; and modern setting, &quot;Tuah&quot; (1990) and XX-Ray II (1995). Similar setting are also applied in an animated movie, &quot;Silat Legenda&quot; (1998), again based on the legend of Hang Tuah. In the year 2000s, silat was featured to varying degrees of importance in popular Malay movies such as &quot;Jiwa Taiko&quot;, &quot;Gong&quot;, &quot;KL Gangster&quot;, &quot;Pontianak Harum Sundal Malam&quot;, and the colour remake of &quot;Orang Minyak&quot;. In 2004, &quot;Puteri Gunung Ledang&quot; was released, it was a remake of a &quot;purba&quot; film of 1961 of the same title, and was promoted as an epic romance that draws on episodic tale of Hang Tuah. It was Malaysia&#x27;s first big-budget movie that featured two highly publicised fights choreographed by a silat exponent.

By 2010s, fully-fledged action-martial arts films regained its popularity in Malaysia, which successfully embraced the modern setting for its plot, rather than the traditional &quot;purba&quot;-style. Films like &quot;Wira&quot; (2019) and &quot;Geran&quot; (2019) are among the examples. &quot;Queens of Langkasuka&quot;, released in 2008, is the first Thai film to prominently feature silat. Among the few other Thai movies to do so is 2008&#x27;s &quot;Ong-Bak 2&quot; which only briefly features a style of tiger silat. The 2014 Brunei movie &quot;Yasmine&quot; is about a teenage female protagonist who learns silat.

===Television===
&quot;Purba&quot; genre also made its way to the television and reached its peak during the 1990s when directors like Uwei Shaari strove to depict silat in its original form by casting martial artists rather than famous actors. Series from that period such as &quot;Keris Lok Tujuh&quot;, &quot;Pendekar: Bayangan Harta&quot; and &quot;Keris Hitam Bersepuh Emas&quot; are still regarded as the country&#x27;s best costume dramas before the genre began to decline in Malaysia after the early 2000s. Various styles of silat are regularly showcased in martial arts-themed documentary serials like &quot;Mahaguru&quot;, &quot;Gelanggang&quot; and &quot;Gerak Tangkas&quot;.

In 2019, Malaysia&#x27;s very own &#x27;Ultraman Ribut&#x27; joins the ranks of the legendary 50-decade spanning Japanese giant superheroes in the &quot;Ultra Galaxy Fight: The Absolute Conspiracy&quot; mini-series. Ultraman Ribut uses a unique fighting style which is a mix of acrobatics and silat martial arts techniques to fight off monsters.

<text>The Search for the Dice Man was written by George Cockcroft under the pen name Luke Rhinehart. It is the official sequel to &quot;The Dice Man&quot;, and was published in 1993.

The story was optioned for a film adaptation in 2009, though none was made.

Other books by George Cockcroft with the same premise: &quot;Adventures of Wim&quot;, &quot;The Book of the Die&quot;.

==Plot summary==
The book is set 20 years after the end of &quot;The Dice Man&quot;, and Luke&#x27;s dicechild, Larry Rhinehart, has grown up to become a hotshot investor on the stock market. He has totally rejected his father&#x27;s reverence for chance: he sees it as an adversary to be overcome, and has managed to create a stable, normal life for himself, in spite of his early abandonment. Indeed, he is due to wed the daughter of his boss, and live wealthily ever after.

This state of affairs would make a dull story and soon his father&#x27;s ghostly presence intervenes. He gets approached by the FBI, who are trying to trace his father&#x27;s location, and find out whether he&#x27;s alive or dead. Though Larry naturally refuses to have anything to do with the FBI, he soon starts to pursue his own investigations. He is financed in this by his fiancée&#x27;s father, who wants to put the whole dice business to rest, and is accompanied by his fiancée&#x27;s cousin, an unreformed hippy.

It takes a long time - a whole book in fact, but Larry eventually does complete his quest. Along the way, what he sees and hears change his views somewhat; by the end of the book it is he who is trying to convince Luke, his father, to accept more chance into his life, rather than the other way round.

<text>The Christian music industry is one aspect of the broader music industry, with a focus on Christian music and subgenres such as gospel music, southern gospel, contemporary Christian music, contemporary worship music, and even traditional church music. It is sometimes called the gospel music industry, a narrower term that does not encompass all the musical genres included here.

Like its broader category, the Christian music industry consists of individuals and organizations that earn money through writing songs, producing recorded music, presenting concerts, and performances on Christian radio. The Christian market also includes some unique aspects, such as hymnal production and church music licensed for congregational singing.

From its roots in the 1920s, the developing Christian music industry exhibited unique tensions between religious, musical, and commercial goals. While it was subject to the same economic and market forces as the entire music industry, the Christian subgenre was also subject to different aesthetic and social boundaries. This was often expressed as a tension between “secular” and “sacred” ideals. Recent scholarship explores why Christian music remained marginal to the general market, was largely critiqued by mainstream media, and was often criticized for being derivative.

==History==
The contemporary Christian music industry has roots in the late 1960s and early 1970s Jesus movement and its Jesus music artists. The &quot;Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music&quot; points out three reasons that the Christian music industry developed as a parallel structure to the general music industry. First, the Jesus movement produced a large number of bands in a very short period, which the general market was unable and/or unwilling to absorb. This was in part due to a lack of appreciation for the ideology expressed by such artists. Finally, Jesus music artists tended toward mistrust of secular corporations. According to another critic, the industry in this period was defined by four characteristics: lack of audience acceptance for styles, inferior production, inefficient distribution, and lack of wide radio exposure. Petra, for instance, struggled to find an audience for their hard rock sound, partially due to limited distribution to Christian bookstores.

Even so, the 1970s saw established corporations become involved in the Christian music market. Word Records, founded in 1951, was bought in 1976 by ABC. Other music industry giants also got involved, CBS started a short-lived Christian label, Priority Records, and MCA also fielded a label, Songbird Records, for a time.

While the Jesus movement had ended by the 1980s, the Christian music industry was maturing and transforming into a multimillion-dollar enterprise. The early 1980s saw an increase Christian booksellers taking product, and an increase in sales followed, despite the recession. As a percentage of gross sales, Christian music rose from 9% in 1976 to 23% in 1985. By her 1982 release Amy Grant had saturated the Christian marketplace and made significant inroads into the general market. Sandi Patti and Michael W. Smith also gained influence within Christian music, each playing significant roles in the development of the industry.

Harder forms of Christian music, such as heavy metal, also began to gain acceptance. This is largely credited to Stryper, who had begun making inroads into the general market by 1985. Still, rock and alternative acts faced a longer battle for acceptance than contemporary acts, as the form was opposed by prominent religious leaders such as Jimmy Swaggart and others on the Christian right. While in 1981 total gospel music industry revenues were approximately $180 million, only ten years later they would total $680 million, according to &quot;CCM Magazine&quot;.

According to RIAA data, market share for sales of Christian music albums more than doubled between 1993 and 1997. In the 1990s the Christian music industry became the fastest growing segment of the music industry. This was due to several factors, including consolidation of record labels, and independent Christian bookstores into chains.

The Christian music industry began adopting SoundScan in 1995, although implementation was spotty even into the millennium. Even so, the adoption caused the visibility of Christian artists to increase significantly, and brought credibility to the industry as Christian albums became integrated into all &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.

In 1985, 90% of Christian music sales originated at Christian bookstores. By 1995, that number had dropped to 64%, with general retailers taking 21%, and the remainder accountable through other methods, such as direct mail. At that same time, the industry was estimated to gross $750 million, with $381 million in album sales. In the late 1990s, general market retailers, especially big box stores such as Best Buy, Walmart, Target, and Blockbuster began carrying a wider selection of Christian music products. By 2000 those stores had surpassed Christian retail in terms of the number of Christian albums sold, according to Soundscan numbers. This phenomenon was partially responsible for crossover successes. P.O.D., for example, sold 1.4 million albums in 2001, although sales at Christian retail outlets accounted for only 10%.

The new millennium has brought challenges for the record industry as a whole, and these have affected the Christian music industry as well. Contemporary worship music, a long time staple of the industry, began to gain significant market share in about the year 2000. By focusing on marketing worship music to youth culture, this genre became a growth driver despite the downturn in the general music industry.

Growth continued until about 2003, but has generally followed the trends of the larger music industry since that point. In 2009 a &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed placed the entire music industry on a &quot;deathwatch,&quot; pointing out that new forms of media, piracy, and new pricing options are driving gross sales down. In another example of parallelism, the Christian music industry has experienced largely the same phenomenon. In the Christian marketplace, music consumption has risen by as much as 30% since 2005, but overall album sales have dropped to about half of their 1999 levels. However, some critics point out that the current downturn may have long term positive effects for the industry. John J. Thompson told &quot;Christianity Today&quot; that &quot;The lack of monetary benefit has filtered out some of the people who should not have been doing this in the first place. If the people who are in it for the money are gone, it leaves more turf for those who had something a little bit loftier in mind.&quot;

==Criticisms==

===&quot;Ghetto&quot; assertion===
Christian music is sometimes cited as a &quot;ghetto,&quot; meaning that the majority of artists in the industry are pigeonholed to operate solely in it. These artists are isolated from the mainstream public, to Christian media, including radio, magazines, and book stores. For many this is a conscious choice, however others, not content to stay in an isolated industry segment, attempt to &quot;cross over&quot; and gain acceptance in the general market. For many artists, being called Christian becomes a .

A 1997 study revealed that a self-identified audience of &quot;Christian music listeners&quot; had what was considered a lacking recognition of Christian artists. The survey was commissioned by the Christian Music Trade Association and Z Music Television. The study looked at several artists including Amy Grant, BeBe and CeCe Winans, Carman, Steven Curtis Chapman, dc Talk, Sandi Patty, and Michael W. Smith. At the time of the survey, each of these artists was active in Christian music and had been so for at least nine years, was a multiple Dove Award and/or Grammy Award winner, and had albums certified Gold or higher.

Even so, the survey found that the Christian music audience was no more familiar with artists in the field than they were with Hootie &amp; The Blowfish, a popular act at that time. The study concluded that the word &quot;Christian&quot; was the problem, causing a stigma. &quot;It&#x27;s the label, not the music, that dissuades,&quot; one Christian music executive was quoted as saying, agreeing with the survey.

Another aspect of the &quot;ghetto&quot; is that some artists have trouble gaining audience with Christians due to their non-conservative image. Stryper is a well-known example. Stryper received large amounts of criticism from groups on the Christian right, who argue (among other things) that their image as rock stars contradict their espoused faith. One critic wrote that the marriage of secular and religious elements in &quot;Christian music&quot; &quot;violates all that God has commanded in the Bible about separation.&quot;

The &quot;ghetto&quot; has several effects, critics point out that the audience of such artists are often already Christians, thus limiting the impact of any supposed &quot;evangelism.&quot; Another is that artists sometimes have trouble appealing to and maintaining both secular and religious audiences. For example:

*One Jesus music artist, Randy Matthews, ran into trouble at an early Christian music festival after announcing an upcoming tour with Lynyrd Skynyrd and ZZ Top. The crowd, also reacting to his electric musical style, chased him off the stage, pronouncing him to be demon or drug possessed. Matthews was later dropped from the tour.
*After Bob Dylan announced his conversion to Christianity in 1979, he released three albums widely cited as being based on his newfound faith. Dylan spent several years touring and preaching from stage, though he never became a part of the &quot;Christian music subculture.&quot; The result, as one critic bluntly puts it, was that &quot;It didn&#x27;t work. Christian music fans were characteristically suspicious of Dylan&#x27;s failure to leave the world behind and become a part of their little ghetto, and the world at large tired quickly of paying money to hear him sing about religion.&quot; By 1981, Dylan had dropped the explicit religious references; both critics and audiences returned his music to acclaim.
*While commonly cited as the father of Christian rock, Larry Norman struggled to gain acceptance from the Christian music industry, and was largely estranged from it for his career. His 1969 solo debut has been described by secular observers as &quot;perhaps the first truly accomplished and relevant Christian rock testimony ever recorded,&quot; and 1972&#x27;s &quot;Only Visiting This Planet&quot; became one of the most revered albums of all time in Christian music. Even so, Norman became, according to &quot;CCM&quot; &quot;so far outside the mainstream that most of today&#x27;s Christian music fans have no idea who Larry Norman is.&quot;

The problem, as summed by one critic, was that the music was too religious for secular audience, while simultaneously too aggressive for religious audiences. One critic describes the situation, stating that for a band &quot;to be taken seriously outside the Christian scene, a band must stay far, far away from that scene.&quot;

Mutemath, for instance sued their record label with the goal of removing their product from the Christian market. Their first release sold almost 30,000 copies, with &quot;bulk of sales coming from the Christian market,&quot; according to &quot;Billboard&quot;. The band had been placed in the Christian market by their record label largely because their lead singer, Paul Meany, was previously with the band Earthsuit, whose only major label release was released on a Christian label.

This caused the band to not get taken seriously by music critics, and by the release of their full-length album the band began expressing discontent with their situation. Meany told &quot;Tucson Weekly&quot; &quot;...we began to see ourselves getting pigeonholed into this particular world that we weren&#x27;t necessarily proud to be associated with... We&#x27;re not trying to preach through our music; we don&#x27;t have some kind of evangelistic agenda with what we&#x27;re doing... You know, you don&#x27;t want to be ashamed of your faith and your beliefs, but you don&#x27;t want to be marketed by that, either.&quot;

On the other hand, some artists operate solely within the &quot;ghetto&quot; of Christian music, and find great success in doing so.

===Downplayed religious content===
An early Christian record label, Lamb &amp; Lion Records (founded by Pat Boone) reported in 1978 that it was their goal to produce crossover artists, but they were limited by lack of distribution to the secular marketplace. Both problems affected Christian labels into the 1990s. &quot;Since people don&#x27;t understand [the term] &#x27;the Blood of Jesus, &#x27;&quot; stated a manager for Lamb &amp; Lion, &quot;...music that communicates must approach it another way. We&#x27;ve got to present a subtle but sensitive Christian message.&quot; Lyrics with subdued religious content have become commonplace in the industry; One critic points out that the secular hit &quot;Spirit in the Sky&quot; &quot;has more explicit religious references than do many recent Christian radio hits.&quot;

Some critics have alleged that CCM often uses &quot;minimal direct theology,&quot; and promotes a &quot;Jesus is my boyfriend&quot; image of God. Using downplayed religious content in lyrics has allowed some artists to &quot;cross over&quot; and make significant impact into the general market. Some Christian bands are able to do this while maintaining their identity in the Christian market. For example, MercyMe, whose double platinum album &quot;Almost There&quot; produced the Christian and secular chart hit &quot;I Can Only Imagine.&quot; However, the lyrics of the single, while Christian in nature, contain what one critic calls &quot;rather theology.&quot;

Sometimes &quot;crossing over&quot; creates ambiguity over whether an artist is Christian (a &quot;Christian band&quot;), or the artist is composed of Christians and produces music that appeals to Christian music fans but does not cater to the Christian market (&quot;Christians in a band&quot;). Such artists are:

*Chevelle, whose debut album was released to Christian music markets, received three Dove awards. However, the band is not generally considered to be a &quot;Christian band&quot; today. On that topic the band states &quot;We originally signed with a record company that was backed by Word (a Christian label housing John Tesh and Amy Grant), so the record was in Christian bookstores. It was really an accidental thing.&quot;
*Project 86 has sometimes been labeled a &quot;Christian band&quot;, although the band itself eschewed the label. The band considers its art to be the best conveyance of their message. Frontman Andrew Schwab has offered several statements on the topic. &quot;We&#x27;re not going to go in there and say &#x27;Hey we&#x27;re the Christian band. We&#x27;re going to carry ourselves like a normal band. Hopefully people will like our music and investigate into the band [...] and they will learn our beliefs.&quot; &quot;If we&#x27;re playing at Ozzfest or on Family Values...,&quot; the band told &quot;7ball&quot; after the release of their second album, &quot;there is a greater level of tact necessary in order to reach that sort of audience.&quot; In a 2007 interview, Schwab further opined &quot;We always tell people that the goal has been to just write music that we love, and write music hopefully that is challenging and inspiring to people and doesn&#x27;t sound like everything else out there.&quot;
*Switchfoot is often referred to as a &quot;Christian band&quot;, mostly due to their involvement with the Christian rock scene in their early days. But the band has always shunned this label: &quot;For us, it&#x27;s a faith, not a genre...&quot; says Jon Foreman. &quot;...these songs are for everyone. Calling us &#x27;Christian rock&#x27; tends to be a box that closes some people out and excludes them. And that&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re trying to do. Music has always opened my mind—and that&#x27;s what we want&quot;. Duly, Foreman&#x27;s lyrics steer clear of preachiness, exclusive declarations of faith, or even any mention of Jesus Christ, instead questioning the status quo, probing existential issues through &quot;Socratic dialogue&quot; in which he answers questions with more questions, exploring frustrations, or simply being inspirational. Even so, this position has not alienated their Christian fans. As in their indie days, they are still distributed to Christian retail outlets through Sparrow Records, featured on Christian radio and charts, and presented Dove Awards, even after having been signed to the mainstream Columbia Records. Spin writer Andrew Beaujon takes the view that &quot;their lyrics often have two different meanings, one meaning for a Christian audience and one meaning for the rest of us. They try to relate to two different groups of people at once&quot;.

====In video====
The trend continues when examining religious videos. Many Christian bands produce videos with rotation on MTV in mind, however, the images can lead to an ambiguous impression of the portrayal.

In 1982 MTV featured two videos, &quot;Constantly Changing&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Mad&quot; (which was the first one to be featured), made by the Swedish Christian rock band Jerusalem to promote their 1981 release &quot;Warrior&quot;. DeGarmo and Key was the first Christian band in the US whose video appeared on MTV, made a video for their single &quot;Six, Six, Six&quot; off their 1984 release &quot;Communication&quot;. While the video was shown on MTV for a short time, it was subsequently pulled for a scene which depicted the Antichrist engulfed in flames, which MTV described as &quot;senseless violence.&quot; Eventually the video was re-edited for MTV—however, the unedited version continued to play in Christian bookstores and on Christian television networks, like Trinity Broadcasting. The video received a Dove award in a category created specially for it, &quot;Gospel Music Visual Song&quot; in 1985.

Another artist, Brian Welch, whose &quot;solo debut&quot; was released to Christian markets, found their album pulled from some Christian bookstores after the music video for &quot;Flush&quot; was released. The video is an interpretation of the authors personal experience with methamphetamine, before his religious conversion. At the time the album was pulled, Brian Welsh released a statement about the visual content of the video, relating its symbolism to his personal experiences of addiction and redemption. He also issued the following statement: &quot;The video for &#x27;Flush&#x27; is about crystal meth addiction and the crazy things anyone addicted to meth will do while they&#x27;re high or to get their fix. Everything the models were doing in the video is what I was wrapped up in while I was addicted to meth... I believe I would be dead right now if I continued using meth, but instead, I chose to surrender my life to Christ and die to myself so He could share His resurrection with me... There is a huge message of hope on my CD and I believe those retailers that are pulling the CD from their shelves are robbing someone spiritually by taking it off of the shelves.&quot;

A study of visual elements of Christian music videos on Z Music Television, a now defunct MTV-like channel for Christian music, found that almost one third of the channel&#x27;s videos could be described as &quot;Ambiguously Religious&quot; at best (red area, right). The conclusion was that the channel&#x27;s programming was designed to make its Christian nature &quot;apparent only to those willing to listen for it.&quot;

===Other arguments===
Some critics describe the Christian music industry as being committed &quot;to the goals and strategies of the commercial marketplace – industrial growth, increased market share, and greater profits.&quot; This became more apparent in the 1980s and 1990s as the largest Christian record labels became subsidiaries of the &quot;mainstream&quot; labels (who are themselves owned by huge media conglomerates like Viacom and Time Warner). Others see the industry as taking on the roles traditionally reserved for the church. Concerts are the equivalent of religious services, and commodities symbols of faith. Under these conditions &quot;evangelism becomes rhetoric—justifying the propaganda value of the industry&#x27;s work – not spiritual reality.&quot; One critic comments that &quot;perhaps the &#x27;ghettoization&#x27; and parallel institutionalism of CCM manifests itself nowhere more apparently than at numerous Christian rock festivals.&quot;

<text>Anna Karenina () is a novel by the Russian author Leo Tolstoy, first published in book form in 1878. Tolstoy called it his first true novel. It was initially released in serial installments from 1875 to 1877, all but the last part appearing in the periodical &quot;The Russian Messenger.&quot; By the time he was finishing up the last installments Tolstoy was in an anguished state of mind and, having come to hate it, finished it unwillingly.

The novel deals with themes of betrayal, faith, family, marriage, Imperial Russian society, desire, and the differences between rural and urban life. The story centres on an extramarital affair between Anna and cavalry officer Count Alexei Kirillovich Vronsky that scandalises the social circles of Saint Petersburg and forces the young lovers to flee to Italy in a search for happiness, but after they return to Russia, their lives further unravel.

Trains are a motif throughout the novel, with several major plot points taking place either on passenger trains or at stations in Saint Petersburg or elsewhere in Russia. The story takes place against the backdrop of the liberal reforms initiated by Emperor Alexander II of Russia and the rapid societal transformations that followed. The novel has been adapted into various media including theatre, opera, film, television, ballet, figure skating, and radio drama.

==Plot introduction==
&quot;Anna Karenina&quot; consists of more than the story of Anna Karenina, a married socialite, and her affair with the affluent Count Vronsky, though their relationship is a very strong component of the plot. The story starts when she arrives in the midst of her brother&#x27;s family being broken up by his unbridled womanising—something that prefigures her own later situation.

A bachelor, Vronsky is eager to marry Anna if she will agree to leave her husband Karenin, a senior government official. Although Vronsky and Anna go to Italy, where they can be together, leaving behind Anna&#x27;s child from her first marriage, they have trouble making friends. When they return to Russia, Anna suffers shunning and isolation due to the relationship. While Vronsky pursues his social life, Anna grows increasingly possessive and paranoid about his supposed infidelity.

A parallel story within the novel is Konstantin Levin, a wealthy country landowner who wants to marry Kitty, sister to Dolly and sister-in-law to Anna&#x27;s brother Stepan Oblonsky. Levin has to propose twice before Kitty accepts. The novel details Levin&#x27;s difficulties managing his estate, his eventual marriage, and his struggle to accept the Christian faith, until the birth of his first child.

The novel explores a diverse range of topics throughout its approximately one thousand pages. Some of these topics include an evaluation of the land and agricultural system that existed in Russia at the time as well as politics, not only in the Russian government, but also at the level of the individual characters and families, religion, morality, gender, and social class.

==Summary==
The novel is divided into eight parts and 239 chapters. Its epigraph is &quot;Vengeance is mine; I will repay&quot;, from Romans 12:19, which in turn quotes from Deuteronomy 32:35. The novel begins with one of its most oft-quoted lines:

===Part 1===

Prince Stepan Arkadyevich Oblonsky (&quot;Stiva&quot;), a Moscow aristocrat and civil servant, has been unfaithful to his wife, Princess Darya Alexandrovna (&quot;Dolly&quot;). Dolly has discovered his affair with the family&#x27;s governess, and the household and family are in turmoil. Stiva informs the household that his married sister, Anna Arkadyevna Karenina, is coming to visit from Saint Petersburg in a bid to calm the situation.

Meanwhile, Stiva&#x27;s childhood friend, Konstantin Dmitrievich Levin (&quot;Kostya&quot;), arrives in Moscow with the aim of proposing to Dolly&#x27;s youngest sister, Princess Katerina Alexandrovna Shcherbatskaya (&quot;Kitty&quot;). Kostya is a passionate, restless, but shy aristocratic landowner who, unlike his Moscow friends, chooses to live in the country on his large estate. He discovers that Kitty is also being pursued by Count Alexei Kirillovich Vronsky, an army cavalry officer.

Whilst at the railway station to meet his sister Anna, Stiva bumps into Vronsky who is there to meet his mother, the Countess Vronskaya. Anna and Vronskaya have travelled and talked together in the same carriage. As the family members are reunited and Vronsky sees Anna for the first time, a railway worker accidentally falls in front of a moving train carriage and is killed. Anna interprets this as an &quot;evil omen&quot;.

At the Oblonsky home, Anna talks openly and emotionally to Dolly about Stiva&#x27;s affair and convinces her that Stiva still loves her despite the infidelity. Dolly is moved by Anna&#x27;s speeches and decides to forgive Stiva.

Kitty, who comes to visit Dolly and Anna, is just eighteen. In her first season as a debutante, she is expected to make an excellent match with a man of her own social standing. Vronsky has been paying her considerable attention, and she expects to dance with him at a ball that evening. Kitty is very struck by Anna&#x27;s beauty and personality and becomes infatuated with her just as much as with Vronsky. When Kostya proposes to Kitty at her home, she clumsily turns him down, as she is in love with Vronsky and believes that he will propose to her; she was encouraged to do so by her mother, the Princess Shcherbatskaya, who believes Vronsky would be a better match (in contrast to Kitty&#x27;s father, who favours Kostya).

At the ball Kitty expects to hear something definitive from Vronsky, but he dances with Anna instead, choosing her as a partner over a shocked and heartbroken Kitty. Kitty realises that Vronsky has fallen in love with Anna and has no intention of marrying her, despite his overt flirtations. Vronsky has regarded his interactions with Kitty merely as a source of amusement and assumes that Kitty has acted for the same reasons. Anna, shaken by her emotional and physical response to Vronsky, returns at once to St. Petersburg. Vronsky travels on the same train. During the overnight journey, the two meet and Vronsky confesses his love. Anna refuses him, although she is affected by his attentions.

Kostya, crushed by Kitty&#x27;s refusal, returns to his estate, abandoning any hope of marriage. Anna returns to her husband, Count Alexei Alexandrovich Karenin, a senior government official, and her son, Seryozha, in St. Petersburg.

===Part 2===
The Shcherbatskys consult doctors over Kitty&#x27;s health, which has been failing since Vronsky&#x27;s rejection. A specialist advises that Kitty should go abroad to a health spa to recover. Dolly speaks to Kitty and understands she is suffering because of Vronsky and Kostya, whom she cares for and had hurt in vain. Kitty, humiliated by Vronsky and tormented by her rejection of Kostya, upsets her sister by referring to Stiva&#x27;s infidelity, saying she could never love a man who betrayed her. Meanwhile, Stiva visits Kostya on his country estate while selling a nearby plot of land.

In St. Petersburg, Anna begins to spend more time in the inner circle of Princess Elizaveta (&quot;Betsy&quot;), a fashionable socialite and Vronsky&#x27;s cousin. Vronsky continues to pursue Anna. Although she initially tries to reject him, she eventually succumbs to his attentions and begins an affair. Meanwhile, Karenin reminds his wife of the impropriety of paying too much attention to Vronsky in public, which is becoming the subject of gossip. He is concerned about the couple&#x27;s public image, although he mistakenly believes that Anna is above suspicion.

Vronsky, a keen horseman, takes part in a steeplechase event, during which he rides his mare Frou-Frou too hard—his irresponsibility causing him to fall and break the horse&#x27;s back. Anna is unable to hide her distress during the accident. Before this, Anna had told Vronsky that she is pregnant with his child. Karenin is also present at the races and remarks to Anna that her behavior is improper. Anna, in a state of extreme distress and emotion, confesses her affair to her husband. Karenin asks her to break it off to avoid further gossip, believing that their marriage will be preserved.

Kitty and her mother travel to a German spa to enable Kitty to recover from her ill health. There, they meet the wheelchair-using Pietist Madame Stahl, who is accompanied by the kind and virtuous Varenka, her adopted daughter. Influenced by Varenka, Kitty becomes extremely pious and concerned for others, but when her father joins them she becomes disillusioned after learning from him that Madame Stahl is faking her illness. She then returns to Moscow.

===Part 3===

Kostya continues working on his estate, a setting closely tied to his spiritual thoughts and struggles. He wrestles with the idea of falseness, wondering how he should go about ridding himself of it, and criticizing what he feels is falseness in others. He develops ideas relating to agriculture, and the unique relationship between the agricultural laborer and his native land and culture. He comes to believe that the agricultural reforms of Europe will not work in Russia because of the unique culture and personality of the Russian peasant.

When Kostya visits Dolly, she attempts to understand what happened between him and Kitty and to explain Kitty&#x27;s behavior. Kostya is very agitated by Dolly&#x27;s talk about Kitty, and he begins to feel distant from Dolly as he perceives her loving behavior towards her children as false. Kostya resolves to forget Kitty and contemplates the possibility of marriage to a peasant woman. However, a chance sighting of Kitty in her carriage makes Kostya realise he still loves her. Meanwhile, in St. Petersburg, Karenin refuses to separate from Anna, insisting that their relationship will continue. He threatens to take away Seryozha if she persists in her affair with Vronsky.

===Part 4===
When Anna and Vronsky continue seeing each other, Karenin consults a lawyer about obtaining a divorce. During the time period, a divorce in Russia could only be requested by the innocent party in an affair and required either that the guilty party confess or that the guilty party be discovered in the act of adultery. Karenin forces Anna to hand over some of Vronsky&#x27;s love letters, which the lawyer deems insufficient as proof of the affair. Stiva and Dolly argue against Karenin&#x27;s drive for a divorce.

Karenin changes his plans after hearing that Anna is at risk of death after the difficult birth of her daughter, Annie. At her bedside, Karenin forgives Vronsky. However, Vronsky, embarrassed by Karenin&#x27;s kindness, unsuccessfully attempts suicide by shooting himself. As Anna recovers, she finds that she cannot bear living with Karenin despite his forgiveness and his attachment to Annie. When she hears that Vronsky is about to leave for a military posting in Tashkent, she becomes desperate. Anna and Vronsky reunite and flee to Italy, leaving behind Seryozha and Karenin&#x27;s offer of divorce.

Meanwhile, Stiva acts as a matchmaker with Kostya: he arranges a meeting between him and Kitty, which results in their reconciliation and engagement.

===Part 5===
Kostya and Kitty marry and start their new life on his country estate. Although the couple are happy, they undergo a bitter and stressful first three months of marriage. Kostya feels dissatisfied at the amount of time Kitty wants to spend with him and dwells on his inability to be as productive as he was as a bachelor. When the marriage starts to improve, Kostya learns that his brother, Nikolai, is dying of consumption. Kitty offers to accompany Kostya on his journey to see Nikolai and proves herself a great help in nursing Nikolai. Seeing his wife take charge of the situation in an infinitely more capable manner than he could have done himself without her, Kostya&#x27;s love for Kitty grows. Kitty eventually learns that she is pregnant.

In Italy, Vronsky and Anna struggle to find friends who will accept them. Whilst Anna is happy to be finally alone with Vronsky, he feels suffocated. They cannot socialize with Russians of their own class and find it difficult to amuse themselves. Vronsky, who believed that being with Anna was the key to his happiness, finds himself increasingly bored and unsatisfied. He takes up painting and makes an attempt to patronize an émigré Russian artist of genius. However, Vronsky cannot see that his own art lacks talent and passion, and that his conversation about art is extremely pretentious. Increasingly restless, Anna and Vronsky decide to return to Russia.

In St. Petersburg, Anna and Vronsky stay in one of the best hotels, but take separate suites. It becomes clear that whilst Vronsky is still able to move freely in Russian society, Anna is barred from it. Even her old friend, Princess Betsy, who has had affairs herself, evades her company. Anna starts to become anxious that Vronsky no longer loves her. Meanwhile, Karenin is comforted by Countess Lidia Ivanovna, an enthusiast of religious and mystic ideas fashionable with the upper classes. She advises him to keep Seryozha away from Anna and to tell him his mother is dead. However, Seryozha refuses to believe that this is true. Anna visits Seryozha uninvited on his ninth birthday but is discovered by Karenin.

Anna, desperate to regain at least some of her former position in society, attends a show at the theater at which all of St. Petersburg&#x27;s high society are present. Vronsky begs her not to go, but he is unable to bring himself to explain to her why she cannot attend. At the theater, Anna is openly snubbed by her former friends, one of whom makes a deliberate scene and leaves the theater. Anna is devastated. Unable to find a place for themselves in St. Petersburg, Anna and Vronsky leave for Vronsky&#x27;s country estate.

===Part 6===
Dolly, her children, and her mother, the Princess Shcherbatskaya, spend the summer with Kostya and Kitty. The couple&#x27;s life is simple and unaffected, although Kostya is uneasy at the &quot;invasion&quot; of so many Shcherbatskys. He becomes extremely jealous when one of the visitors, Veslovsky, flirts openly with the pregnant Kitty. Kostya tries to overcome his jealousy, and briefly succeeds during a hunt with Veslovsky and Oblonsky, but eventually succumbs to his feelings and asks Veslovsky to leave. Veslovsky immediately goes to stay with Anna and Vronsky at their nearby estate.

When Dolly visits Anna, she is struck by the difference between Kostya and Kitty&#x27;s aristocratic-yet-simple home life and Vronsky&#x27;s overtly luxurious and lavish country estate. She is also unable to keep pace with Anna&#x27;s fashionable dresses or Vronsky&#x27;s extravagant spending on a hospital he is building. In addition, all is not quite well with Anna and Vronsky. Dolly notices Anna&#x27;s anxious behavior and her uncomfortable flirtations with Veslovsky. Vronsky makes an emotional request to Dolly, asking her to convince Anna to seek a divorce from Karenin so that the two might marry and live normally.

Anna has become intensely jealous of Vronsky and cannot bear when he leaves her, even for short excursions. When Vronsky leaves for several days of provincial elections, Anna becomes convinced that she must marry him to prevent him from leaving her. After Anna writes to Karenin again seeking a divorce, she and Vronsky leave the countryside for Moscow.

===Part 7===
While visiting Moscow for Kitty&#x27;s confinement, Kostya quickly gets used to the city&#x27;s fast-paced, expensive and frivolous society life. He accompanies Stiva to a gentleman&#x27;s club, where the two meet Vronsky. Kostya and Stiva pay a visit to Anna, who is occupying her empty days by being a patroness to an orphaned English girl. Kostya is initially uneasy about the visit, but Anna easily puts him under her spell. When he admits to Kitty that he has visited Anna, she accuses him of falling in love with her. The couple are later reconciled, realizing that Moscow society life has had a negative, corrupting effect on Kostya.

Anna cannot understand why she can attract a man like Kostya, who has a young and beautiful new wife, but can no longer attract Vronsky. Her relationship with Vronsky is under increasing strain, because he can move freely in Russian society while she remains excluded. Her increasing bitterness, boredom, and jealousy cause the couple to argue.

Anna begins to abuse morphine to help her sleep, a habit she began while living with Vronsky at his country estate, and becomes addicted to the narcotic. Meanwhile, after a long and difficult labor, Kitty gives birth to a son, Dmitri, who goes by the nickname Mitya and Kostya is paradoxically both horrified and profoundly moved by the sight of the tiny baby.

Stiva visits Karenin to seek his commendation for a new post. During the visit, Stiva asks Karenin to grant Anna a divorce with her as the innocent party (which would require him to confess to a non-existent affair), but Karenin&#x27;s decisions are now governed by a French clairvoyant recommended by Lidia Ivanovna. The clairvoyant apparently had a vision in his sleep during Stiva&#x27;s visit and gives Karenin a cryptic message that he interprets in a way such that he must decline the request for divorce.

Anna becomes increasingly jealous and irrational towards Vronsky, whom she suspects of having love affairs with other women. She is also convinced that he will give in to his mother&#x27;s plans to marry him off to a rich society woman. They have a bitter row and Anna believes the relationship is over. She starts to think of suicide as an escape from her torments. In her mental and emotional confusion, she sends a telegram to Vronsky asking him to come home to her, and then pays a visit to Dolly and Kitty. Anna&#x27;s confusion and anger overcome her and, in conscious symmetry with the railway worker&#x27;s death on her first meeting with Vronsky, from ground level at the end of a railway platform, she commits suicide by throwing herself under a passing freight train.

===Part 8===
Sergei Ivanovich&#x27;s (Kostya&#x27;s brother) latest book is ignored by readers and critics and he participates in the Russian commitment to Pan-Slavism. Stiva gets the post he desired so much, and Karenin takes custody of Vronsky and Anna&#x27;s baby, Annie. A group of Russian volunteers, including the suicidal Vronsky, depart from Russia to fight in the Orthodox Serbian revolt that has broken out against the Turks, more broadly identified as the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878).

Kostya struggles to find the meaning of his life after his brother Nikolai&#x27;s death from consumption, and begins to have suicidal thoughts. However, after speaking at length to a peasant, Kostya has a true change of heart, concluding that the meaning of life is to serve God, and that he does believe in the Christian principles taught to him in childhood and no longer questions his faith. He realizes that one must decide for oneself what is acceptable concerning one&#x27;s own faith and beliefs and chooses not to tell Kitty of the change that he has undergone.

A lightning storm later occurs at Kostya&#x27;s estate while his wife and newborn son are outdoors and, in his fear for their safety, Kostya realizes that he does indeed love his son as much as he loves Kitty. Kitty&#x27;s family is concerned that a man as altruistic as her husband does not consider himself to be a Christian.

Kostya is initially displeased that his return to his faith does not bring with it a complete transformation to righteousness. However, at the end of the story, Kostya arrives at the conclusion that despite his newly accepted beliefs, he is human and will go on making mistakes. His life can now be meaningfully and truthfully oriented toward righteousness.

==Style and major themes==

Tolstoy&#x27;s style in &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; is considered by many critics to be transitional, forming a bridge between the realist and modernist novel. According to Ruth Benson in her book about Tolstoy&#x27;s heroines, Tolstoy&#x27;s diaries show how displeased he was with his style and approach to writing in early drafts of &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;, quoting him as stating, &quot;I loathe what I have written. The galleys of &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; for the April issue of &quot;Russkij Vestnik&quot; now lie on my table, and I really don&#x27;t have the heart to correct them. Everything in them is so rotten, and the whole thing should be rewritten—all that has been printed too—scrapped, and melted down, thrown away, renounced (1876, JI 62: 265)&quot;.

&quot;Anna Karenina&quot; is commonly thought to explore the themes of hypocrisy, jealousy, faith, fidelity, family, marriage, society, progress, carnal desire and passion, and the agrarian connection to land in contrast to the lifestyles of the city. According to literary theorist Cornelius Quassus, in the novel &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;, &quot;unofficial institutions of the system, presented through social salons, function as part of the power apparatus that successfully calms the disorder created by Anna&#x27;s irrational emotional action, which is a symbol of resistance to the system of social behavioral control.&quot; Translator Rosemary Edmonds wrote that Tolstoy does not explicitly moralize in the book, but instead allows his themes to emerge naturally from the &quot;vast panorama of Russian life.&quot; She also says one of the novel&#x27;s key messages is that &quot;no one may build their happiness on another&#x27;s pain.&quot;

Levin is often considered a semi-autobiographical portrayal of Tolstoy&#x27;s own beliefs, struggles, and life events. Tolstoy&#x27;s first name was &quot;Lev,&quot; and the Russian surname &quot;Levin&quot; means &quot;of Lev.&quot; According to footnotes in the Pevear/Volokhonsky translation, the viewpoints Levin supports throughout the novel in his arguments match Tolstoy&#x27;s outspoken views on the same issues. Moreover, according to W. Gareth Jones, Levin proposed to Kitty in the same way as Tolstoy to Sophia Behrs. Additionally, Levin&#x27;s request that his fiancée read his diary as a way of disclosing his faults and previous sexual encounters parallels Tolstoy&#x27;s own requests to his fiancée Behrs.

==Historical context==
The events in the novel take place against the backdrop of rapid transformations as a result of the liberal reforms initiated by Emperor Alexander II of Russia, principal among these the emancipation reform of 1861, followed by judicial reform, including a jury system; military reforms, the introduction of elected local governments (zemstvos), the fast development of railroads, banks, industry, telegraphy, the rise of new business elites and the decline of the old landed aristocracy, a freer press, the awakening of public opinion, the Pan-Slavism movement, the woman question, volunteering to aid Serbia in its military conflict with the Ottoman Empire in 1876 etc. These contemporary developments are hotly debated by the characters in the novel.

The suburban railway station of Obiralovka, where one of the characters commits suicide, is now known as the town of Zheleznodorozhny, Moscow Oblast.

==Reception==
&quot;Anna Karenina&quot;″s immediate reception in the United States was mixed, with the work&#x27;s themes and eponymous character receiving praise but its length and depiction of suicide receiving criticism.

When William Faulkner was asked to list what he thought were the three greatest novels, he replied: &quot;&quot;Anna Karenina, Anna Karenina&quot;, and &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;&quot;.

===Comparisons of translations===
Writing in the year 2000, academic Zoja Pavlovskis-Petit compared the different translations of &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; on the market. Commenting on the revision of Constance Garnett&#x27;s 1901 translation she says: &quot;The revision (1965) ... by Kent &amp; Berberova (the latter no mean stylist herself) succeeds in &#x27;correcting errors ... tightening the prose, converting Briticisms, and casting light on areas Mrs Garnett did not explore&#x27;. Their edition shows an excellent understanding of the details of Tolstoy&#x27;s world (for instance, the fact that the elaborate coiffure Kitty wears to the ball is not her own hair—a detail that eludes most other translators), and at the same time they use English imaginatively (Kitty&#x27;s shoes &#x27;delighted her feet&#x27; rather than &#x27;seemed to make her feet lighter&#x27;—Maude; a paraphrase). ... the purist will be pleased to see Kent &amp; Berberova give all the Russian names in full, as used by the author; any reader will be grateful for the footnotes that elucidate anything not immediately accessible to someone not well acquainted with imperial Russia. This emended Garnett should probably be a reader&#x27;s first choice.&quot;

She further comments on the Maudes&#x27; translation: &quot;the revised Garnett and the Magarshack versions do better justice to the original, but still, the World&#x27;s Classics edition (1995) ... offers a very full List of Characters ... and good notes based on the Maudes&#x27;.&quot; On Edmonds&#x27;s translation she states: &quot;[it] has the advantage of solid scholarship ... Yet she lacks a true sensitivity for the language ... [leading] to [her] missing many a subtlety.&quot; On Carmichael&#x27;s version she comments: &quot;this is a—rather breezily—readable translation ... but there are errors and misunderstandings, as well as clumsiness.&quot; On Magarshack&#x27;s translation she comments: &quot;[it] offers natural, simple, and direct English prose that is appropriate to Tolstoy&#x27;s Russian. There is occasional awkwardness ... and imprecision ... but Magarshack understands the text ... and even when unable to translate an idiom closely he renders its real meaning ... This is a good translation.&quot; On Wettlin&#x27;s Soviet version she writes: &quot;steady but uninspired, and sounds like English prose written by a Russian who knows the language but is not completely at home in it. The advantage is that Wettlin misses hardly any cultural detail.&quot;

In &quot;In Quest Of Tolstoy&quot; (2008), Hughes McLean devotes a full chapter (&quot;Which English &quot;Anna&quot;?&quot;) comparing different translations of &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;. His conclusion, after comparing seven translations, is that &quot;the PV [Pevear and Volokhonsky] translation, while perfectly adequate, is in my view not consistently or unequivocally superior to others in the market.&quot; He states his recommendations in the last two pages of the survey: &quot;&quot;None&quot; of the existing translations is actively &quot;bad&quot; ... One&#x27;s choice ... must therefore be based on nuances, subtleties, and refinements.&quot; He eliminates the Maudes for &quot;disturbing errors&quot; and &quot;did not find either the Margashack or Carmichael ever superior to the others, and the lack of notes is a drawback.&quot; On Edmonds&#x27;s version he states: &quot;her version has no notes at all and all too frequently errs in the direction of making Tolstoy&#x27;s &#x27;robust awkwardness&#x27; conform to the translator&#x27;s notion of good English style.&quot;

McLean&#x27;s recommendations are the Kent–Berberova revision of Garnett&#x27;s translation and the Pevear and Volokhonsky version. &quot;I consider the GKB [Garnett–Kent–Berberova] a very good version, even though it is based on an out-of-date Russian text. Kent and Berberova did a much more thorough and careful revision of Garnett&#x27;s translation than Gibian did of the Maude one, and they have supplied fairly full notes, conveniently printed at the bottom of the page.&quot; McLean takes Pevear and Volokhonsky to task for not using the best critical text (the &quot;Zaidenshnur–Zhdanov text&quot;) and offering flawed notes without consulting C.J. Turner&#x27;s &quot;A Karenina Companion&quot; (1993), although he calls their version &quot;certainly a good translation.&quot;

Reviewing the translations by Bartlett and Schwartz for &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, Masha Gessen noted that each new translation of &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; ended up highlighting an aspect of Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;variable voice&quot; in the novel, and thus, &quot;The Tolstoy of Garnett... is a monocled British gentleman who is simply incapable of taking his characters as seriously as they take themselves. Pevear and Volokhonsky... created a reasonable, calm storyteller who communicated in conversational American English. Rosamund Bartlett... creates an updated ironic-Brit version of Tolstoy. Marian Schwartz... has produced what is probably the least smooth-talking and most contradictory Tolstoy yet.&quot; Gessen found Schwartz&#x27;s translation to be formally closer to the original Russian, but often weighed down with details as a result; Bartlett&#x27;s translation, like Pevear and Volokhonsky&#x27;s, was rendered in more idiomatic English and more readable.

===&quot;Anna Karenin&quot;===
The title has been translated as both &quot;Anna Karenin&quot; and &quot;Anna Karenina.&quot; The first instance eschews the Russian practice of employing gender-specific forms of surnames, instead using the masculine form for all characters. The second is a direct transliteration of the actual Russian name. Vladimir Nabokov explains: &quot;In Russian, a surname ending in a consonant acquires a final &#x27;a&#x27; (except for the cases of such names that cannot be declined and except adjectives like OblonskAYA) when designating a woman.&quot; Since surnames are not gendered in English, proponents of the first convention—removing the Russian &#x27;a&#x27; to naturalize the name into English—argue that it is more consistent with English naming practice, and should be followed in an English translation. Nabokov, for instance, recommends that &quot;only when the reference is to a female stage performer should English feminise a Russian surname (following a French custom: la Pavlova, &#x27;the Pavlova&#x27;). Ivanov&#x27;s and Karenin&#x27;s wives are Mrs Ivanov and Mrs Karenin in Britain and the US—not &#x27;Mrs Ivanova&#x27; or &#x27;Mrs Karenina&#x27;.&quot;

The practice favored by most translators, however, has been to allow Anna&#x27;s actual Russian name to stand. Larissa Volokhonsky, herself a Russian, prefers the second option, as did Aylmer and Louise Maude, who lived in Russia for many years and were friends of Tolstoy. A handful of other translators, including Constance Garnett and Rosemary Edmonds, both non-Russians, prefer the first.

<text>Adventures of Wim is a book by George Cockcroft, written under the pen name Luke Rhinehart. It was first published in 1986.

==Plot summary==
The book is composed of sections taken from other, fictional books. The preface to the book claims that it was written in Deya, Majorca, in 2326. According to the book, an entire industry has grown up publishing books about a Montauk named Wim - including &quot;The Gospel According to Luke&quot; (Luke Froth, not Luke Rhinehart) and the screenplay of a movie. The screenplay is possibly in there as a result of Luke Rhinehart&#x27;s continuing frustration in trying to get &quot;The Dice Man&quot; turned into a good movie. Adventures of Wim, then, is an effort to create a new interpretation of the story of Wim, drawing on the many previous efforts, and so providing a multi-faceted and whimsical account of &#x27;one of the greatest figures in the 20th and 21st Century&#x27;.

A boy is born of a virgin mother and is named &quot;Wim&quot; (in &quot;Adventures of Wim&quot;) or &quot;Whim&quot; (in &quot;The Book of the Die&quot; and &quot;Whim&quot;): Montauk for &quot;Wave Rider&quot;. He is pronounced to be the saviour of the Montauk nation by his tribe&#x27;s navigator (official historian and spiritual guide), and educated in their ways including the &quot;Montauk martial arts&quot; which are predicated on not engaging with, nor even being noticed by an enemy. Sadly, social services force Wim to attend school, where they attempt to educate him in more useful skills, such as American Football. Wim, also known as &quot;He of Many Chances&quot;, proves to be an inefficient saviour, as God sends him on a quest for Ultimate Truth. This does not seem to be something that will benefit his tribe terribly, but the navigator isn&#x27;t one to stare down the barrel of a lightning gun, and sends him on his way. After a long and arduous search, Wim finds ultimate truth (in a potato), and with it the cure for the sickness of the human condition.

<text>Starship Titanic is an adventure game developed by The Digital Village and published by Simon &amp; Schuster Interactive. It was released in April 1998 for Microsoft Windows and in March 1999 for Apple Macintosh. The game takes place on the eponymous starship, which the player is tasked with repairing by locating the missing parts of its control system. The gameplay involves solving puzzles and speaking with the bots inside the ship. The game features a text parser similar to those of text adventure games with which the player can talk with characters.

Written and designed by &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; creator Douglas Adams, &quot;Starship Titanic&quot; began development in 1996 and took two years to develop. In order to achieve Adams&#x27;s goal of being able to converse with characters in the game, his company developed a language processor to interpret players&#x27; input and give an appropriate response and recorded over 16 hours of character dialogue. Oscar Chichoni and Isabel Molina, artists on the film &quot;Restoration&quot; (1995), served as the game&#x27;s production designers and designed the ship&#x27;s Art Deco visuals. The game&#x27;s voice cast includes Monty Python members Terry Jones and John Cleese. A tie-in novel titled &quot;Douglas Adams&#x27;s Starship Titanic: A Novel&quot; was written by Jones and released in October 1997.

&quot;Starship Titanic&quot; was released to mixed reviews and was a financial disappointment, although it was nominated for three industry awards and won a Codie award in 1999. It was re-released for modern PCs in September 2015 by GOG.com.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Starship Titanic&quot; is a graphic adventure game played from a first-person perspective. The player moves on the eponymous ship by clicking on locations indicated by the cursor and advancing to the next frame after a blurred transition (although this can be avoided by holding down shift during clicks). The mouse can also be used to pick up and store items in your inventory and interact with onscreen objects. In the beginning of the game, the player is given a device called Personal Electronic Thing (PET), which serves as a toolbar on the bottom of the screen. The PET has five modes: Chat-O-Mat, a text parser through which the player can talk with characters by inputting text; Personal Baggage, the inventory in which the player can add or withdraw items; Remote Thingummy, a set of functions to interact with objects and locations; Designer Room Numbers, which indicates the player&#x27;s current location; and Real Life, an options menu with settings and a game save/load system.

Much of the gameplay involves solving puzzles by using items with other items or with objects and characters onscreen. Another significant aspect of the game involves talking with characters in the game, namely the bots that work in the ship and a parrot, by inputting prompts in the Chat-O-Mat mode. Additionally to conversation with characters through interpreting of user input, the parser often provides hints or explanations that come in the form of pre-recorded speech, which can help the player in progressing in the game.

The main objective of the game is to locate the missing parts of the ship&#x27;s broken intelligence system in order to repair the starship. In order to advance within the game, the player must upgrade from the standard third class level to first class and thus gain access to areas that are restricted when the game begins. The game also requires the player to transport items throughout the ship through the Succ-U-Bus, a system of tubes that transfer objects placed in them to other parts of the ship; these tubes can be found in many areas of the ship. The player also needs to use the parrot to solve certain puzzles. A talking bomb can be found in the game and unwillingly armed by the player; if that happens, the player has to either disarm it or distract it during countdown to prevent it from exploding.

== Plot ==

&quot;Starship Titanic&quot; begins in the player character&#x27;s house on Earth, which is partially destroyed when the eponymous cruise ship crash-lands through the roof. Fentible, the &quot;DoorBot&quot;, informs the player that the ship and its crew have malfunctioned and needs help to get them back to normal. Once the ship is taken back to space, the player meets Marsinta, the &quot;DeskBot&quot;, who makes them a third-class reservation, and Krage, a &quot;BellBot&quot;. The player begins the journey as a third-class passenger and thus cannot access many areas of the ship that are reserved for higher class passengers until he or she obtains a second-class promotion and eventually convinces Marsinta to upgrade them to first class after managing to alter her personality.

Through backstory in the ship&#x27;s email system, the player learns that Brobostigon and Scraliontis, two associates of the ship&#x27;s creator Leovinus, double crossed him and deliberately provoked a &quot;Spontaneous Massive Existence Failure&quot; by hiding the body parts of the ship&#x27;s humanoid intelligence system Titania in various locations within the ship as well as planting a scuttling bomb, in an effort to destroy the ship and profit from its insurance. However, both men perished in the attempt with the player finding their dead bodies on the ship. After exploring the vessel and solving puzzles, the player eventually finds all of Titania&#x27;s body parts and awakens her, repairing the sabotaged ship and allowing for it to be navigated. The player then accesses the bridge and navigates the ship back to their home on Earth. Throughout the game, the player meets other bots, including Nobby, the &quot;LiftBot&quot;, Fortillian, the &quot;BarBot&quot; and D&#x27;Astragaaar, the &quot;Maitre d&#x27;Bot&quot;. The player also meets a parrot that accompanies them throughout most of the journey.

After returning to Earth, the player gets a message from Leovinus (played by Douglas Adams) who announces that he has decided to retire on Earth as a fisherman and to find a wife. Depending on if the bomb was disarmed, one of two endings occurs:
*If the bomb wasn&#x27;t disarmed, the ship takes off and explodes in midair.
*If the bomb was disarmed, the ship simply takes off and the player is informed by Leovinus that, by galactic salvage laws, they now own the &quot;Starship Titanic&quot;.

== Development ==

=== Background ===

Douglas Adams first imagined the &quot;Starship Titanic&quot; in &quot;Life, the Universe and Everything&quot;, the third entry in &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; series, where it is briefly mentioned in the book&#x27;s 10th chapter. Adams describes the ship—named after the famous ocean liner—as a &quot;majestic and luxurious cruise-liner&quot; that &quot;did not even manage to complete its very first radio message—an SOS—before undergoing a sudden and gratuitous total existence failure&quot;.

Before making &quot;Starship Titanic&quot;, Adams had previously served as a designer for Infocom&#x27;s 1984 text-based game &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, which was based on his successful science fiction series of the same name, and had been an advocate for &quot;new media&quot;. Since working with Infocom, Adams had expressed interest in returning to game design, and feared that he was spending too much time by himself writing.
He turned to game design again after playing &quot;Myst&quot;, which is when he said &quot;the medium had gotten interesting again&quot;. However, he thought &quot;Myst&quot; was lacking in story and characters. Commenting on the gameplay of &quot;Myst&quot; and its sequel &quot;Riven&quot;, Adams said that &quot;nothing really happens, and nobody is there. I thought, let&#x27;s do something similar but populate the environment with characters you can interact with&quot;, and hoped to combine graphics and a text-based system that allowed for players to converse with characters in the game.

In 1996 Adams co-founded The Digital Village, a company intended to handle his future endeavours in film, print and new media. Adams first discussed founding the company with Robbie Stamp, a producer at Central Independent Television in the early 1990s, and they did so along with Stamp&#x27;s boss at Central, Richard Creasey; literary agent Ed Victor was also one of the company&#x27;s founders. Ian Charles Stewart, one of the founders of &quot;Wired&quot;, joined the enterprise shortly thereafter. In December 1995, The Digital Village arranged a deal to raise seed capital from venture capitalist Alex Catto, who bought 10% of the company&#x27;s shares for £400,000. In 1996 Simon &amp; Schuster Interactive reached a deal with the company to finance &quot;Starship Titanic&quot;, whose budget was estimated at $2 million.

Development of the game began Summer 1996. Around 40 people worked on the game&#x27;s development.

===Writing===
The story was created by Adams, who wrote the game&#x27;s script with Michael Bywater and Neil Richards. Additional dialogue was written by D. A. Barham. Adams&#x27;s inspiration for the game—particularly the objective of upgrading from third to first-class—came from an experience with airline ticketing personnel, where he was told he would be given an upgrade from economy-class tickets upon checking in for his flight, but found out upon arrival that the upgrade had not been arranged; he said the idea is based on the premise that &quot;everyone wants a free upgrade in life&quot;. Adams had devised a story concept to add an additional gameplay element where players would be able to enter the ship&#x27;s data system as a &quot;full realtime, flyable environment&quot; and control how information flows through the vessel, but the idea was abandoned because, according to Adams, it was &quot;a bridge too far&quot;.

Adams aimed to develop a text parser-based dialogue system as opposed to the drop-down conversation menus of contemporary adventure games, in which player have limited dialogue options. The text parser includes over 30,000 words and 16 hours of dialogue recorded by voice actors. According to Adams, over 10,000 lines of dialogue were recorded for the game. In order to make conversations with characters convincing, The Digital Village&#x27;s Jason Williams and Richard Millican created a language processor called SpookiTalk, which was based on VelociText, a software developed by Linda Watson of Virtus Corporation. Producer Emma Westecott thought the processor was preferable as common text-to-speech programs &quot;made the voices sound cold and distant&quot;. Douglas Adams claimed that they made &quot;all of your characters sound like semi-concussed Norwegians&quot;. The bots in the game understood around 500 words of vocabulary and were capable of conversing with the player as well as each other. According to Westecott, the developers&#x27; intention was &quot;getting into characters&quot; and cited games such as &quot;Myst&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; as contemporary games that lacked &quot;proper interaction&quot; with human characters. Williams and Millican modified VelociText into SpookiTalk in order to improve recognition of complicated sentence forms from players, as well as reducing repeated responses, and retaining a character&#x27;s memory of an object or topic as a conversation progresses. Additional dialogue support was done by linguist Renata Henkes.

===Design===
The futuristic, Art Deco visuals were designed by Oscar Chichoni and Isabel Molina, who also worked on the 1995 Oscar-winning film &quot;Restoration&quot;. Chichoni drew the initial sketches of the ship on a flight to Los Angeles on the day he and Molina joined the project. Adams described the ship&#x27;s interior design as a mixture of the Ritz Hotel, the Chrysler Building, Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb and Venice. In order to make the design of the ship similar to Art Deco, Molina and Chichoni drew inspiration from 1950s American electrical appliances and modern architecture; to design the ship&#x27;s external shape, they also drew from bones and dinosaur skeletons.

Adams, Chichoni and Molina gave detailed briefings for the animators for each environment and character in the game. Modeling and animation for the 30 environments and 10 characters was done on Softimage 3D, version 3.5. Most environments were done separately. However, the center of the ship in particular also included other environments as it connects the first and second class canals, the top of the well and the central well; Darren Blencowe was responsible for modeling the ship&#x27;s center. A total of six 3D artists worked on the game. Rendering was done on Mental Ray; in order to complete the rendering in time, the team&#x27;s systems administrator wrote a Perl-based software to control all rendering jobs for up to 20 processors working 24 hours a day. In order to animate the parrot, Philip Dubree, one of the team&#x27;s animators, visited pet shops and studied macaws for inspiration. Dubree created a skeleton and modeled the wings and feathers, later adjoining the body. He also scanned photos of macaw features and used Photoshop to incorporate those in the parrot&#x27;s textures. In order to create Titania&#x27;s statue at the Top of the Well, animator John Attard built the 3D model as a refractive metallic structure and texturized it with streaks of oxidation on her face; Attard used the Statue of Liberty as a visual reference.

Programming was done on The Digital Village&#x27;s own developed engine, Lifeboat. The engine was developed by programmers Sean Solle and Rik Heywood, who joined the company in January 1997. Their intention when developing Lifeboat was allowing simultaneous work on different parts of the game, facilitating game test runs and unifying the work of coders and 3D animators. The engine went live on 14 February 1997. To keep within a data budget of 1.8 gigabytes, the team used the MP3 sound format to compress the 16 hours of speech and dialogue, and compressed movies and cutscenes with Indeo. The final set of the game CDs were burned 400 days after the first build of Lifeboat.

===Sound===

Sound designer John Whitehall, who was in charge of the company&#x27;s sound studio during the recording process, worked with Adams on creating the sound for the game. Whitehall and Adams had previously collaborated in the radio version of &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; for the BBC, where Whitehall was a studio manager. The voice cast included actors Laurel Lefkow, Quint Boa, Dermot Crowley and Jonathan Kydd, who voiced the bot characters in the game. Monty Python members Terry Jones and John Cleese also lent their voices to characters in the game. Jones, a longtime friend of Adams, provided the voice of the parrot, while Cleese (who is credited as &quot;Kim Bread&quot;) voiced the bomb. Actor Philip Pope was also involved, having voiced the Mâitre d&#x27;Bot. Adams himself also did voice acting for the game, voicing the Succ-U-Bus and Leovinus.

The ambient music for the game was composed by Paul Wickens, who is also a member of Paul McCartney&#x27;s touring band. Adams and Wickens were acquainted from school, but lost touch until Adams saw him performing with McCartney. Adams also wrote additional soundtrack himself, including the music in the Music Room puzzle, which was based on a tune he had written on the guitar years earlier.

== Novel ==
A 1997 novelisation was written by Terry Jones as part of his involvement with the game development, the spinoff planned alongside the game. An audiobook version was also released, followed by an e-book version ten years later, and a radio dramatisation over twenty years later.

==Release==
In May 1996, Simon &amp; Schuster Interactive announced a deal to co-publish &quot;Starship Titanic&quot; with The Digital Village. Simon &amp; Schuster presented the game along with 11 other projects at E3 1997. Release was originally slated for September 1997, but was postponed for December 1997 in time for the U.S. Christmas season. However, the game was delayed again, and in January 1998 Adams said the game &quot;should be ready by March&quot;.

The game was eventually released on 2 April 1998 for PC, and had an official launch at a New York City event, at 550 Madison Avenue, on 20 April 1998. Simon &amp; Schuster made an initial April distribution of 200,000 copies to be shipped to 13 countries through seven international publishers. Zablac Entertainment secured the publishing rights in the United Kingdom, while NBG EDV Handels &amp; Verlags AG acquired the rights in German, R&amp;P Electronic Media did so in the Netherlands and Benelux territories, and HILAD in Australia and New Zealand. Apple, Inc. announced on 8 July 1998 that &quot;Starship Titanic&quot;, along with many other games, would be released for Macintosh computers in the future. The game was released for the Mac on 15 March 1999. Sonopress developed a DVD version of the game, which was released in the UK in May 1999.

Sales for the game were financially disappointing.
 Simon &amp; Schuster marketing VP Walter Walker estimated that the game had sold over 60,000 copies by the end of April, far below the expected number of 200,000. In the United States, it sold 41,524 copies and earned $1,841,429 by July; sales in that country rose to 150,000 copies by August 1999. According to the company&#x27;s creative director Jeff Siegel, a DVD version of the game &quot;did not really sell&quot; despite being an alternative to the three-CD original release. According to Douglas Adams biographer Nick Webb, The Digital Village CEO Robbie Stamp sold the rights of &quot;Starship Titanic&quot; and all associated intellectual property to Thomas Hoegh&#x27;s Arts Alliance in September 1998.

The game&#x27;s Windows version was re-released for modern PCs on digital download by GOG.com on 17 September 2015.

== Reception ==

&quot;Starship Titanic&quot; received generally mixed reviews. Review aggregator GameRankings gives the game a score of 63.79% based on 19 reviews in the website. Charles Ardai of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; gave the game two and a half stars out of five, praising the graphics and visuals as &quot;gorgeous&quot;, but criticizing the playability, the bots&#x27; responses in the text parser, and ultimately thought that the game is &quot;just not very funny&quot;. Adventure Gamers&#x27;s Evan Dickens similarly praised the graphics and &quot;beautiful&quot; animation, but criticized the navigation and the parser, writing that the bots &quot;won&#x27;t understand or respond correctly to a single thing [the player asks]&quot;, and called it an &quot;antiquated keyword-recognition system&quot;. He also described the puzzles as &quot;contrived and unnecessary&quot;. IGN reviewer Chris Buckman gave the game a 4.9/10 score, criticizing the lack of a backstory, the movement sequences and navigation, and the obscurity of the puzzles.

Writing for &quot;PC Gamer US&quot;, Stephen Poole called &quot;Starship Titanic&quot; &quot;an uninspiring and ultimately tedious adventure.&quot; He criticized the parser as unhelpful and thought there are few characters to interact with, although he praised the puzzles as &quot;involved and challenging&quot; and compared them to those of classic adventure games. David Wildgoose of &quot;PC Powerplay&quot; gave the game a 71% rating, writing that the parser is &quot;a refreshing change to the predictable keyword or menu conversation systems&quot; of most contemporary games, and praised the difficulty of the puzzles. However, Wildgoose thought the game was &quot;a bit of a disappointment&quot;, believing that it should have been longer and expected it to be funnier. In a review for &quot;Computer Games Strategy Plus&quot;, Cindy Yans gave the game three and a half stars out of five. She also criticized the parser for failing to understand context in conversations, and called the navigation and item usage &quot;cumbersome&quot;; however, she praised Adams&#x27;s humor, the animations and graphics. CNN&#x27;s Brad Morris praised the game overall, but compared its graphics unfavorably to contemporary games such as &quot;Riven&quot; and &quot;Zork Nemesis&quot;, and said that &quot;it is not a revolution in this genre&quot;. Stuart Clarke of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; praised the graphics and the game overall, but said players will &quot;do much scratching of the head and aimless wandering in circles before the mysteries of the Titanic are solved&quot;. GameSpot&#x27;s Ron Dulin gave the game a 7.1 score, criticizing the lack of a story but praising the humor, graphics and the presence of a text parser as &quot;a nice nod to the days of old&quot;.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; praised the text parser and wrote that as the game progresses, &quot;it&#x27;s impossible to get anywhere&quot; without asking the bots questions, adding that &quot;the humor of the answers alone makes it worth asking questions&quot;. Paul Presley of &quot;PC Zone&quot; gave the game a score of 91%, praising its atmosphere as &quot;totally absorbing&quot; and commended it for its humor and presentation as well. Alex Cruickshank of &quot;PC Magazine&quot; called it a &quot;pleasantly entertaining adventure&quot; and praised the graphics, gameplay and puzzles. Reviewing the Mac version, Mike Dixon of &quot;MacAddict&quot; gave it a positive review, praising the graphics, the recorded dialogue and the humor, whilst giving minor criticism to the interface. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s Megan Harlan gave the game an A, praising the parser and the ability to converse with the bots, as well as their responses. In a &quot;Computer Shopper&quot; review, Jim Freund wrote the game &quot;provides many hours of enjoyable game play&quot; and suggested that it might be &quot;a milestone in the annals of interactive fiction&quot;. Writing for &quot;USA Today&quot;, Jeffrey Adam Young rated it three and a half stars out of four, calling it a &quot;hilarious blend of Monty Pythonesque humor and zany wordplay in a sci-fi setting&quot; and praising it for its characters and script. &quot;New York Daily News&quot; reviewer Kenneth Li gave the game three and a half stars out of four, calling it &quot;breathtaking&quot; and praising the storyline; however, he offered minor criticism towards repetitive replies in the text parser. Joe Brussel of &quot;Adventure Classic Gaming&quot; rated the game four stars out of five, writing that the puzzles are &quot;entertaining but not too hard&quot; and praised the voice acting and graphics, although he wrote the story is &quot;a little shortsighted&quot;.

The game received two nominations for the BAFTA Interactive Awards in the categories of Comedy and Interactive Treatment in October 1998, and was nominated for PC Adventure Game of the Year at the 2nd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards. Likewise, the editors of &quot;The Electric Playground&quot; nominated &quot;Starship Titanic&quot; for their 1998 &quot;Best Adventure Game&quot; award, which ultimately went to &quot;Grim Fandango&quot;. However, it was given a Codie award in 1999 for &quot;Best New Adventure/Role Playing Game&quot; by the Software and Information Industry Association.

== Legacy ==

In a 2015 article, &quot;Kotaku&quot; contributor Lewis Packwood wrote that &quot;perhaps the &quot;Starship Titanic&quot;&#x27;s most enduring legacy&quot; is a forum in the older version of the game&#x27;s official website, which was developed by The Digital Village&#x27;s web developer Yoz Grahame. The starship&#x27;s fictional construction company Star-Struct Inc. , &quot;a wholly-owned subsidiary&quot; of the fictional travel agency Starlight Lines Corp., contained an &quot;employee forum&quot; that became popular months after it was created, entirely through user-generated content. Users role-played as fictional employees and characters in the ship, and created scenarios, storylines and in-jokes that developed over years. After The Digital Village closed, Grahame hosted the website himself and kept the domain alive.

Shortly after &quot;Starship Titanic&quot;, The Digital Village (which was renamed to h2g2) developed an online guide based on &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; called h2g2, which became a BBC domain after the company shut down in 2001.
In 2011, the BBC sold h2g2 to Not Panicking Ltd.

<text>Christian radio refers to Christian media radio formats that focus on Christian religious broadcasting or various forms of Christian music. Many such formats and programs include contemporary Christian music, gospel music, sermons, radio dramas, as well as news and talk shows covering popular culture, economics, and political topics from a Christian perspective.

==Business models==
Brokered programming is a significant portion of most U.S. Christian radio stations&#x27; revenue, with stations regularly selling blocks of airtime to evangelists seeking an audience. Another revenue stream is solicitation of donations, either to the evangelists who buy the air time or to the stations or their owners themselves. In order to further encourage donations, certain evangelists may emphasize the prosperity gospel, in which they preach that tithing and donations to the ministry will result in financial blessings from God. Others may have special days of the year dedicated to fundraising, similar to many NPR stations. Although the solicitation of donations and the sale of airtime may resemble a commercial enterprise, such actions do not necessarily constitute a call to action, and thus this does not forbid them from airing on noncommercial licensed stations in the U.S. A minority of stations, typically music stations, use the traditional model for music radio and allow traditional commercial advertising.

Numerous religious broadcasters own many of their own stations. In the U.S., religious radio stations are exempt from certain rules requiring radio stations to have some local operations, which allows them to have massive networks of transmitters covering far larger areas than a radio station would otherwise be allowed and may not face the same restrictions on the number of signals a broadcaster can own within one geographic area.

==Radio formats==
Most Christian radio stations transmit a mixture of Christian music and Christian talk and teaching.

===Christian music===
Christian music radio outlets mirror commercial radio in many ways, and music in a variety of different genres is available. Many stations play primarily gospel music, including Black Gospel and Southern Gospel, or contemporary worship music, while others play all formats of contemporary Christian music, including Christian pop, Christian rock, Christian rap, Christian country music, and Christian alternative rock. Many artists within the Christian music industry criticize Christian radio for only playing &quot;safe&quot; music, and not taking enough chances on new artists, or in some cases older artists, that may not be as appealing to the largely conservative Gospel Music Association.

Many non-religious radio stations devote some of their weekend programming to Christian music; for example, Black Gospel programming is common on Sundays on many stations featuring the Urban Contemporary format.

===Christian talk, radio drama, sermons===
Other Christian stations will present a no-music format that features talk radio-style programming (sometimes including live radio call-in shows) and/or long-form &quot;preaching and teaching&quot; programs. Notable examples include &quot;Focus on the Family&quot; with host Jim Daly, &quot;Amazing Facts&quot;, &quot;Living Way&quot; with pastor Jack Hayford, and Pastor Rick&#x27;s Daily Hope; an example of an inspirational program are &quot;Moments of Melody&quot; and &quot;The Voice of Prophecy.&quot; Radio drama programs, long dead in most other radio formats, continue to be transmitted on Christian radio; notable examples include long-running &quot;Adventures in Odyssey&quot;, &quot;Patch the Pirate&quot;, and &quot;Unshackled!&quot; and relative newcomers such as &quot;Down Gilead Lane&quot; and &quot;A Work in Progress.&quot;

==Denominations==
Christian radio, particularly in North America, is dominated by Protestant ministries, particularly those associated with evangelical Christianity. The predominant Roman Catholic radio services are the Eternal Word Network, founded by Mother Angelica as a spin-off of her television service EWTN, and Radio Maria USA.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a sect whose place in Christianity is heavily debated, maintains some limited radio evangelical operations through BYU Radio, which owns a single FM station. The Seventh-day Adventists are most closely associated with Three Angels Broadcasting Network.

==North American and international availability==
Most Christian radio stations as well as programmers based in the United States are members of the National Religious Broadcasters, a Christian organization. There are reportedly 1,600 Christian broadcasting organizations in the U.S. They range from single stations to expansive networks. It is common for religious broadcasters to purchase many small broadcast translators to create networks that stretch across large regions. Moody Radio was the first example, and still one of the largest, though most of its stations broadcast stand-alone programming as well as network feeds. Z88.3 in Orlando, Florida, the WAY-FM Network, K-LOVE, Air 1, The Joy FM, Reach Radio, 3ABN Radio, Radio 74, and the Bible Broadcasting Network are other notable examples in the world.

Christian radio expanded in the early twenty-first century. It became available in the United Kingdom with changes to broadcasting regulations. Premier Christian Radio is based in the London area where it is available on medium wave and DAB; elsewhere, it is available digitally or by Internet. United Christian Broadcasters is an international broadcasting and media company; radio stations are based in Albania, Australia, Canada, Denmark, New Zealand, the Philippines, and the United Kingdom. Trans World Radio is an evangelical media distributor broadcasting Christian programs in 190 countries in more than 300 languages, TWR-UK can be heard in the United Kingdom on Sky, Freeview and online.

<text>The Western Approaches is an approximately rectangular area of the Atlantic Ocean lying immediately to the west of Ireland and parts of Great Britain. Its north and south boundaries are defined by the corresponding extremities of Britain. The coast of the mainland forms the eastern side and the western boundary is the 30 degree meridian, which passes through Iceland. The area is particularly important to the United Kingdom, because many of its larger shipping ports lie within it.

The term is most commonly used when discussing naval warfare, notably during the Napoleonic Wars, the First World War and the Battle of the Atlantic during the Second World War in which Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; attempted to blockade the United Kingdom using submarines (U-boats) operating in this area. Since almost all shipping to and from the United Kingdom passed through this area, it was an excellent hunting ground and had to be heavily defended.

<doc id="159948" wikidata="Q207371" url="?curid=159948" title="Lichfield">
<text>Lichfield () is a cathedral city and civil parish in Staffordshire, England. Lichfield is situated south-east of the county town of Stafford, north-east of Walsall, north-west of Tamworth and south-west of Burton upon Trent. At the time of the 2021 Census, the population was 34,738 and the population of the wider Lichfield District was 106,400.

Notable for its three-spired medieval cathedral, Lichfield was the birthplace of Samuel Johnson, the writer of the first authoritative &quot;Dictionary of the English Language&quot;. The city&#x27;s recorded history began when Chad of Mercia arrived to establish his bishopric in 669 AD and the settlement grew as the ecclesiastical centre of Mercia. In 2009, the Staffordshire Hoard, the largest hoard of Anglo-Saxon gold and silver metalwork, was found south-west of Lichfield.

The development of the city was consolidated in the 12th century under Roger de Clinton, who fortified the Cathedral Close and also laid out the town with the ladder-shaped street pattern that survives to this day. Lichfield&#x27;s heyday was in the 18th century, when it developed into a thriving coaching city. This was a period of great intellectual activity; the city was the home of many famous people including Samuel Johnson, David Garrick, Erasmus Darwin and Anna Seward, prompting Johnson&#x27;s remark that Lichfield was &quot;a city of philosophers&quot;.

Today, the city still retains its old importance as an ecclesiastical centre, and its industrial and commercial development has been limited. The centre of the city has over 230 listed buildings (including many examples of Georgian architecture) and preserves much of its historic character.

== Toponymy ==
The origin of the modern name &quot;Lichfield&quot; is twofold. At Wall, south of the current city, there was a Romano-British village, Letocetum, a Common Brittonic place-name meaning &quot;Grey wood&quot;, &quot;grey&quot; perhaps referring to varieties of tree prominent in the landscape, such as ash and elm. In the post-Roman period, &quot;Letocetum&quot; developed into Old Welsh .

The earliest record of the name in English is the &quot;Vita Sancti Wilfredi&quot; of around 715, describing when Chad moves from York to Lichfield in 669. &quot;Chad was made Bishop of the Mercians immediately after his deposition; Wilfred gave him the place (&quot;locus&quot;) at Lichfield (&quot;Onlicitfelda&quot;)&quot;. The prefix &quot;on&quot; indicates that the place given to Chad by Wilfrid was &quot;in Lichfield&quot;, indicating the name was understood to apply to a region rather than a specific settlement. Bede&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;, completed in 731, states that Chad acquired &quot;Licidfelth&quot; as his episcopal seat (&quot;sedes episcolpalem&quot;).

These and later sources show that the name &quot;Letocetum&quot; had passed into Old English as &quot;Licid&quot;, to which was appended the Old English word (&quot;open country&quot;). This word is the origin of the word &quot;Lichfield&quot;.

The modern day city of Lichfield and the Roman villa of Letocetum are just two miles (3 km) apart. While these names are distinct in modern usage, they had a common derivation in the Brittonic original *&quot;Letocaiton&quot;, indicating that &quot;grey wood&quot; referred to the region inclusive of modern-day Lichfield City and the Roman villa.

Popular etymology has it that a thousand Christians were martyred in Lichfield around AD 300 during the reign of Diocletian and that the name Lichfield actually means &quot;field of the dead&quot; (see &quot;lich&quot;). There is no evidence to support this legend.

== History ==
=== Prehistory and antiquity ===

The earliest evidence of settlement is Mesolithic flints discovered on the high ground of the cemetery at St Michael on Greenhill, which may indicate an early flint industry. Traces of Neolithic settlement have been discovered on the south side of the sandstone ridge occupied by Lichfield Cathedral.

 south-west of Lichfield, near the point where Icknield Street crosses Watling Street, was the site of Letocetum (the Brittonic *Lētocaiton, &quot;Greywood&quot;). Established in AD 50 as a Roman military fortress, it had become a civilian settlement (vicus) with a bath house and a mansio by the 2nd century. Letocetum fell into decline by the 4th century and the Romans had left by the 5th century. There have been scattered Romano-British finds in Lichfield and it is possible that a burial discovered beneath the cathedral in 1751 was Romano-British. There is no evidence of what happened to Letocetum after the Romans left; however, Lichfield may have emerged as the inhabitants of Letocetum relocated during its decline. A (&quot;Fort Greywood&quot;) was listed by Nennius among the 28 cities of Britain in his &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, although these were largely historic remembrances of early Sub-Roman Britain.

=== Middle Ages ===
The early history of Lichfield is obscure. The first authentic record of Lichfield occurs in Bede&#x27;s history, where it is called &quot;Licidfelth&quot; and mentioned as the place where St Chad fixed the episcopal see of the Mercians in 669. The first Christian king of Mercia, Wulfhere, donated land at Lichfield for St Chad to build a monastery. It was because of this that the ecclesiastical centre of Mercia became settled as the Diocese of Lichfield, which was approximately northwest of the seat of the Mercian kings at Tamworth.

In July 2009, the Staffordshire Hoard, the largest collection of Anglo-Saxon gold ever found, was discovered in a field in the parish of Hammerwich, south-west of Lichfield; it was probably deposited in the 7th century.

The first cathedral was built on the present site in 700 when Bishop Hædde built a new church to house the bones of St Chad, which had become the centre of a sacred shrine to many pilgrims when he died in 672. The burial in the cathedral of the kings of Mercia, Wulfhere in 674 and Ceolred in 716, further increased the city&#x27;s prestige. In 786 King Offa made the city an archbishopric with authority over all the bishops from the Humber to the River Thames; his appointee was Archbishop Hygeberht. This may have been motivated by Offa&#x27;s desire to have an archbishop consecrate his son Ecgfrith as king, since it is possible Jænberht refused to perform the ceremony, which took place in 787. After King Offa&#x27;s death in 796, Lichfield&#x27;s power waned; in 803 the primacy was restored to Canterbury by Pope Leo III after only 16 years.

The &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; lists the city as one of the 28 cities of Britain around AD 833.

During the 9th century, Mercia was devastated by Danish Vikings. Lichfield itself was unwalled and the cathedral was despoiled, so Bishop Peter moved the see to the fortified and wealthier Chester in 1075. At the time of the Domesday Book survey (1086), Lichfield was held by the bishop of Chester; Lichfield was listed as a small village. The lord of the manor was the Bishop of Chester until the reign of Edward VI. In 1102 Bishop Peter&#x27;s successor, Robert de Limesey, transferred the see from Chester to Coventry. The Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield had seats in both locations; work on the present Gothic cathedral at Lichfield began in 1195. (In 1837 the see of Lichfield acquired independent status, and the style &#x27;Bishop of Lichfield&#x27; was adopted.)

In 1153 a markets charter was granted by King Stephen and, ever since, weekly markets have been held in the Market Square.

Bishop Roger de Clinton was responsible for transforming the scattered settlements to the south of Minster Pool into the ladder-plan streets existing today. Market Street, Wade Street, Bore Street and Frog Lane linked Dam Street, Conduit Street and Bakers Lane on one side with Bird Street and St John Street on the other. Bishop de Clinton also fortified the cathedral close and enclosed the town with a bank and ditch, and gates were set up where roads into the town crossed the ditch. In 1291 Lichfield was severely damaged by a fire which destroyed most of the town; however the Cathedral and Close survived unscathed.

In 1387 Richard II gave a charter for the foundation of the guild of St Mary and St John the Baptist; this guild functioned as the local government, until its dissolution by Edward VI, who incorporated the town in 1548.

=== Early Modern ===

The policies of Henry VIII had a dramatic effect on Lichfield. The Reformation brought the disappearance of pilgrim traffic following the destruction of St Chad&#x27;s shrine in 1538, which was a major loss to the city&#x27;s economic prosperity. That year too the Franciscan Friary was dissolved, the site becoming a private estate. Further economic decline followed the outbreak of plague in 1593, which resulted in the death of over a third of the entire population.

Three people were burned at the stake for heresy under Mary I. The last public burning at the stake for heresy in England took place in Lichfield, when Edward Wightman from Burton upon Trent was executed by burning in the Market Place on 11 April 1612 for promoting himself as the divine Paraclete and Saviour of the world.


In the English Civil War, Lichfield was divided. The cathedral authorities, supported by some of the townsfolk, were for the king, but the townsfolk generally sided with the Parliament. This led to the fortification of the close in 1643. Lichfield&#x27;s position as a focus of supply routes had an important strategic significance during the war, and both forces were anxious for control of the city. The Parliamentary commander Lord Brooke led an assault on the fortified close, but was killed by a deflected bullet on St Chad&#x27;s day in 1643, an accident welcomed as a miracle by the Royalists. The close subsequently yielded to the Parliamentarians, but was retaken by Prince Rupert of the Rhine in the same year; on the collapse of the Royalist cause in 1646 it again surrendered. The cathedral suffered extensive damage from the war, including the complete destruction of the central spire. It was restored at the Restoration under the supervision of Bishop Hacket, and thanks in part to the generosity of King Charles II.

Lichfield started to develop a lively coaching trade as a stop-off on the busy route between London and Chester from the 1650s onwards, making it Staffordshire&#x27;s most prosperous town. In the 18th century, and then reaching its peak in the period from 1800 to 1840, the city thrived as a busy coaching city on the main routes from London to the north-west and Birmingham to the north-east. It also became a centre of great intellectual activity, being the home of many famous people including Samuel Johnson, David Garrick, Erasmus Darwin and Anna Seward; this prompted Johnson&#x27;s remark that Lichfield was &quot;a city of philosophers&quot;. In the 1720s Daniel Defoe described Lichfield as &#x27;a fine, neat, well-built, and indifferent large city&#x27;, the principal town in the region after Chester. During the late 18th and early 19th century much of the medieval city was rebuilt with the red-brick Georgian style buildings still to be seen today. Also during this time, the city&#x27;s infrastructure underwent great improvements, with underground sewerage systems, paved streets and gas-powered street lighting. An infantry regiment of the British Army was formed at Lichfield in 1705 by Col. Luke Lillingstone in the King&#x27;s Head tavern in Bird Street. In 1751 it became the 38th Regiment of Foot, and in 1783 the 1st Staffordshire Regiment; after reorganisation in 1881 it became the 1st battalion of the South Staffordshire Regiment.

=== Late Modern and contemporary ===

The arrival of the Industrial Revolution and the railways in 1837 signalled the end of Lichfield&#x27;s position as an important staging post for coaching traffic. While nearby Birmingham (and its population) expanded greatly during the Industrial Revolution, Lichfield remained largely unchanged in character.

The first council houses were built in the Dimbles area of the city in the 1930s. The outbreak of World War II brought over 2,000 evacuees from industrialised areas. However, due to the lack of heavy industry in the city, Lichfield escaped lightly, although there were air raids in 1940 and 1941 and three Lichfeldians were killed. Just outside the city, Wellington Bombers flew out of Fradley Aerodrome, which was known as RAF Lichfield. After the war the council built many new houses in the 1960s, including some high-rise flats, while the late 1970s and early 1980s saw the construction of a large housing estate at Boley Park in the south-east of the city. The city&#x27;s population tripled between 1951 and the late 1980s.

The city has continued expanding to the west. The Darwin Park housing estate has been under development for a number of years and has swelled the city&#x27;s population by approximately 3,000. Plans were approved for Friarsgate, a new £100 million shopping and leisure complex opposite Lichfield City Station. The police station, bus station, Ford garage and multi-storey car park were to be demolished to make way for 22,000 m2 of retail space and 2,000 m2 of leisure facilities, consisting of a flagship department store, six-screen cinema, hotel, 37 individual shops and 56 flats. These plans have not gone ahead and new plans have been made for a cinema in the abandoned Debenhams building.

== Governance ==

=== Local government ===
Historically the Bishop of Lichfield had authority over the city. It was not until 1548, with Edward VI&#x27;s charter, that Lichfield had any form of secular government. As a reward for the support given to Mary I by the bailiffs and citizens during the Duke of Northumberland&#x27;s attempt to prevent her accession, the Queen issued a new charter in 1553, confirming the 1548 charter and in addition granting the city its own Sheriff. The same charter made Lichfield a county separate from the rest of Staffordshire. It remained so until 1888.

The City Council (not to be confused with Lichfield District Council, which has authority over a wider area than Lichfield city) has 28 members from the six wards of Boley Park, Chadsmead, Curborough, Leamonsley, St John&#x27;s, and Stowe, who are elected every four years. After the 2019 parish council elections, the Conservatives remained in overall control, with the 28 seats being divided between the Conservatives (16), the Liberal Democrats (8), Labour (3) and Independent (1) who subsequently joined the Labour group. The Right Worshipful the Mayor of Lichfield (currently Councillor Robert Yardley) is the civic head of the council and chairs council meetings. The council also appoints a Leader of Council to be the main person responsible for leadership of the council&#x27;s political and policy matters. The council&#x27;s current Leader is Councillor Mark Warfield. Lichfield is one of only 15 towns and cities in England and Wales which appoints a Sheriff.

=== Members of Parliament ===

The Lichfield constituency sent two members to the parliament of 1304 and to a few succeeding parliaments, but the representation did not become regular until 1552; in 1867 it lost one member, and in 1885 its representation was merged into that of the county. The Lichfield constituency was abolished in 1950 and replaced with the Lichfield and Tamworth constituency. This constituency lasted until 1983, when it was replaced with the Mid Staffordshire constituency.

Based on the resident&#x27;s location in Lichfield District, there are technically two MPs. The current Member of Parliament for Lichfield, including the whole of the city, is the Labour Politician Dave Robertson, who has been MP for Lichfield since the 2024 general election. Robertson won the seat from Conservative Michael Fabricant, who had held the seat since 1997, by a majority of 810.

Sarah Edwards was elected to the Tamworth constituency in a byelection in 2023 and held the seat in the 2024 general election. Christopher Pincher was the previous MP until a highly publicised scandal in 2022 after which he had the Conservative whip revoked and subsequently sat as an independent before announcing his resignation in September 2023.

==Geography==

Lichfield covers an area of approximately in the south-east of the county of Staffordshire in the West Midlands region of England. It is approximately north of Birmingham and north-west of London. The city is located between the high ground of Cannock Chase to the west and the valleys of the Rivers Trent and Tame to the east. It is underlain by red sandstone, deposited during the arid desert conditions of the Triassic period. Mercia Mudstone underlies the north and north-eastern edges of the city towards Elmhurst and Curborough. The red sandstone underlying the majority of Lichfield is present in many of its ancient buildings, including Lichfield Cathedral and the Church of St Chad.

The ground within the city slopes down from 116m in the north-west to 86m on the sandstone shelf where Lichfield Cathedral stands. To the south and east of the city centre is a ridge which reaches 103 m at St Michael on Greenhill. Boley Park lies on top of a ridge with its highest point on Borrowcop Hill at 113m. To the south-east the level drops to 69 m where Tamworth Road crosses the city boundary into Freeford. There is another high ridge south-west of the city where there are two high points, one at Berry Hill Farm at 123 m and the other on Harehurst Hill near the city boundary at Aldershawe where the level reaches 134 m.

The city is built on the two sides of a shallow valley, into which flow two streams from the west, the Trunkfield Brook and the Leamonsley Brook, and out of which the Curborough Brook runs to the north-east, eventually flowing into the River Trent. The two streams have been dammed south of the cathedral on Dam Street to form Minster Pool and near St Chad&#x27;s Road to form Stowe Pool.
=== Suburbs ===
Lichfield has a number of suburbs including Boley Park, Chadsmead, Christ Church, Darwin Park, The Dimbles, Leomonsley, Nether Stowe, Sandfields, Stowe, Streethay and Trent Valley. A major recent residential development is Darwin Park, to the immediate south-west of the city centre. Designed by the architectural practice BHB in the early 21st century, it provides mixed housing together with a range of community facilities. The development is named after Erasmus Darwin, who was born and raised in Lichfield, and who is commemorated with a sculpture on Cathedral Walk, a footpath which offers a direct traffic-free connection between Darwin Park and Lichfield city centre.

== Demography ==

At the time of the 2021 census, the population of the City of Lichfield was 34,738. Lichfield is 96.5% white and 66.5% Christian. 51% of the population over 16 were married. 64% were employed and 21% of the people were retired. All of these figures were higher than the national average.

== Economy ==

Lichfield&#x27;s wealth grew along with its importance as an ecclesiastical centre. The original settlement prospered as the place where pilgrims gathered to worship at the shrine of St Chad: this practice continued until the Reformation, when the shrine was destroyed.

In the Middle Ages, the main industry in Lichfield was making woollen cloth; there was also a leather industry. Much of the surrounding area was open pasture, and there were many surrounding farms.

In the 18th century, Lichfield became a busy coaching centre. Inns and hostelries grew up to provide accommodation, and industries dependent on the coaching trade such as coach builders, corn and hay merchants, saddlers, and tanneries began to thrive. The Corn Exchange was designed by T. Johnson and Son and completed in 1850.

The invention of the railways saw a decline in coach travel, and with it came the decline in Lichfield&#x27;s prosperity. By the end of the 19th century, brewing was the principal industry, and in the neighbourhood were large market gardens which provided food for the growing populations of nearby Birmingham and the Black Country.

Today there are a number of light industrial areas, predominantly in the east of the city, not dominated by any one particular industry. The district is famous for two local manufacturers: Armitage Shanks, makers of baths/bidets and showers, and Arthur Price of England, master cutlers and silversmiths. Many residents commute to Birmingham.

The city is home to Central England Co-operative (and its predecessor Midlands Co-operative Society), the second largest independent consumer co-operative in the UK.

==Culture and community==

===Culture===
The Lichfield Greenhill Bower takes place annually on Spring Bank Holiday. Originating from a celebration that was held after the Court of Arraye in the 12th century, the festival has evolved into its modern form, but has kept many of its ancient traditions. After a recreation of the Court of Arraye at the Guildhall, a procession of marching bands, morris men and carnival floats makes its way through the city and the Bower Queen is crowned outside the Guildhall. There is a funfair in the city centre, and another fair and jamboree in Beacon Park.

The Lichfield Festival, an international arts festival, has taken place every July for 30 years. The festival is a celebration of classical music, dance, drama, film, jazz, literature, poetry, visual arts and world music. Events take place at many venues around the city but centre on Lichfield Cathedral and the Garrick Theatre. Popular events include the medieval market in the Cathedral Close and the fireworks display which closes the festival.

Triennially the Lichfield Mysteries, the biggest community theatre event in the country, takes place at the cathedral and in the Market Place. It consists of a cycle of 24 medieval-style plays involving over 600 amateur actors.

After Chad&#x27;s death in 672 AD he was buried in an Anglo-Saxon church which later became part of Lichfield Cathedral.

Anglicanism predominates, with three parishes as well as the cathedral. St Michael&#x27;s and St Mary&#x27;s serve one parish and Christ Church and St Chad&#x27;s serve the other two. Lichfield is within the Diocese of Lichfield and represented by Michael Ipgrave, the current Bishop of Lichfield.

<text>Joshua Barnes FRS (10 January 1654 – 3 August 1712), was an English scholar. His work &quot;Gerania; a New Discovery of a Little Sort of People, anciently discoursed of, called Pygmies&quot; (1675) was an Utopian romance.

==Life and work==
Barnes was born in London, the son of Edward Barnes, a merchant taylor. Educated at Christ&#x27;s Hospital and Emmanuel College, Cambridge, he was chosen in 1695 as Regius Professor of Greek, a language which he wrote and spoke with facility.

One of his early publications was &quot;Gerania; a New Discovery of a Little Sort of People, anciently discoursed of, called Pygmies&quot; (1675), a whimsical sketch, to which Swift&#x27;s &quot;Voyage to Lilliput&quot; may owe something. Among his other works is a &quot;History of that Most Victorious Monarch Edward III&quot; (1688), an epic of over 900 pages, which inserts elaborate speeches into the narrative. He also produced editions of Euripides (1694), Homer (1711), and Anacreon (1705), of which the last contains titles of Greek verses of his own, which he hoped to publish. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in November, 1710.

Barnes married a widow named Mrs Mafon in 1700. Barnes died on 3 August 1712 at Hemingford, near St Ives, Huntingdonshire where his widow erected a monument to him.

==Fiction writer==
The present-day scholar Robert Ignatius Letellier considers &quot;Gerania&quot;, a work of prose fiction, to have been part of an emerging type of adventure novels, featuring an &quot;imaginary voyage into alien or fictional regions&quot;. These combined first-person adventure narratives with either &quot;satirical social observation&quot; or perceptions of ideal human behaviour in remote lands, following a tradition rooted in the &quot;Utopia&quot; (1516) of Thomas More, which found prominent manifestations in &quot;The Blazing World&quot; (1666) of Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne and &quot;The Isle of Pines&quot; of Henry Neville. The tradition would lead to later works, such as the &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; (1719) of Daniel Defoe.

<doc id="159955" wikidata="Q478750" url="?curid=159955" title="Dio (band)">
<text>Dio was an American heavy metal band formed in 1982 and led by vocalist Ronnie James Dio. Dio left Black Sabbath with intentions to form a new band with fellow former Black Sabbath drummer Vinny Appice. The name Dio was chosen because it made sense from a commercial standpoint, as the name was already well known at that time.

The band released ten studio albums and had numerous lineup changes over the years, with Dio himself being the only constant member. Guitarists included Vivian Campbell, Craig Goldy, Doug Aldrich, Warren DeMartini, Tracy G, Jake E. Lee and Rowan Robertson.

The band dissolved in 2010 when Ronnie James Dio died of stomach cancer at the age of 67. R. J. Dio has sold over 50 million records worldwide.

==Biography==
===Origins and &quot;Holy Diver&quot; (1982–1983)===
In 1982, disagreements originating over the mixing of Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Live Evil&quot; album resulted in the departure of Ronnie James Dio and Vinny Appice from the band. Wanting to continue together as a band, the two formed Dio in October 1982 in the United States with guitarist Jake E. Lee and bassist Jimmy Bain. About a month after the band’s formation, Lee was replaced by Vivian Campbell. The following May, the band released their debut album, &quot;Holy Diver&quot;, which featured two hit singles – &quot;Rainbow in the Dark&quot; and &quot;Holy Diver&quot; – that gained popularity, in part from MTV. Dio and Bain played keyboards in the studio, but keyboardist Claude Schnell was recruited for live shows in 1983 prior to the Holy Diver tour. Schnell played to the side of the stage on the first two tours before coming out front in 1985. Dio had this to say of the band&#x27;s origins:

===&quot;The Last in Line&quot; to &quot;Dream Evil&quot; (1984–1989)===
Now a quintet with Schnell on keyboards, the band released their second studio album, &quot;The Last in Line&quot;, on July 2, 1984. It was followed by their third album, &quot;Sacred Heart&quot;, which was released on August 13, 1985.

In 1985, Dio, Campbell and Bain also wrote the song &quot;Stars&quot; for the Hear &#x27;n Aid project, with many other heavy metal luminaries of the time contributing. Campbell became unhappy working with Dio, and the rift between them culminated in Campbell being fired from Dio&#x27;s band. Campbell was subsequently invited to join Whitesnake in 1987. Several songs were recorded live during the &quot;Sacred Heart&quot; tour for the 1986 &quot;Intermission&quot; EP with Campbell still on guitar, however the EP also contained the studio track &quot;Time To Burn&quot;, which served to introduce fans to Craig Goldy as the new guitarist.

On July 21, 1987, their fourth album &quot;Dream Evil&quot; was released. After &quot;Dream Evil&quot;, Goldy, wanting to pursue solo projects, left the band. In June 1989, 18-year-old Rowan Robertson was announced as Goldy&#x27;s successor but further changes were to follow, with Schnell, Bain and Appice leaving the band.

===Changes (1990–1999)===
Schnell, Bain, and Appice were replaced, respectively, with Jens Johansson, Teddy Cook, and former AC/DC drummer Simon Wright. The new band released the album &quot;Lock Up the Wolves&quot; in the spring of 1990. During the tour, Dio had a chance meeting with former Black Sabbath bandmate Geezer Butler which led to that band&#x27;s short-lived reunion, producing one album, &quot;Dehumanizer&quot;. After this, Dio reassembled Dio once again, retaining only Appice on the drums. By early 1993, guitarist Tracy G, keyboardist Scott Warren of Warrant and bassist Jeff Pilson of Dokken had all joined. During this era, the band abandoned fantasy themed songs and focused on modern issues. As a result, some fans regard the albums made during this period—1993&#x27;s &quot;Strange Highways&quot;, 1996&#x27;s &quot;Angry Machines&quot; and the live album &quot;&quot;—as the worst in Dio&#x27;s catalogue, while others view them positively as a step away from the outdated sound of the 1980s. With disappointing record sales for &quot;Angry Machines&quot;, management wanted the band to go back to their earlier style prompting the departure of Tracy G to be replaced by the returning Craig Goldy. In addition, Appice left Dio once again.

===Comeback (2000–2004)===

Craig Goldy&#x27;s return facilitated the release of Dio&#x27;s eighth studio album in 2000, &quot;Magica&quot;, which was regarded by many as the band&#x27;s &quot;comeback album&quot; and reached No. 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; independent charts. It featured not only the return of Goldy but also of Simon Wright and Jimmy Bain, although on the European leg of the tour Chuck Garric played bass. Scott Warren remained in the band and performed live, although Dio and Bain handled all of the keyboard and synth on &quot;Magica&quot;. A concept album, &quot;Magica&quot; featured a return to the band&#x27;s older, more successful sound, while increased use of keyboards gave it a more modern feel. During the following tour, however, tensions rose between Goldy on the one hand and Bain and Dio on the other, as Goldy was dealing with family obligations. Goldy left the band in January 2002 and was replaced with Doug Aldrich, who Bain had met while recording a tribute album for Metallica. Because of his late arrival, Aldrich did not contribute much to Dio&#x27;s ninth work, &quot;Killing the Dragon&quot;, which was written primarily by Dio and Bain. &quot;Killing The Dragon&quot; was released in 2002 through Spitfire Records and was well received in the metal community, making the Billboard top 200. Aldrich would stay in the band until April of the following year, when he, like Campbell before him, joined Whitesnake, prompting Goldy&#x27;s return. Soon afterward, Bain left the band.

===&quot;Master of the Moon&quot; and Split (2004–2010)===
Dio released their tenth studio album, &quot;Master of the Moon&quot; on August 30, 2004 in Europe through SPV Records and on September 7, 2004 in the United States through Sanctuary Records. The album features multi-instrumentalist Jeff Pilson (formerly of Dokken) on bass duties; however, because of prior obligations with Foreigner, he was only available for the recording sessions, and so was replaced by Rudy Sarzo (formerly of Ozzy Osbourne, Quiet Riot, Whitesnake, Blue Öyster Cult among others) on the tour.

2005 saw the release of the Dio live album &quot;Evil or Divine – Live in New York City&quot;, which featured the same show that was released on DVD in 2003. Dio toured South America, Japan, Europe, and Russia in 2005. Their autumn tour was titled &quot;An Evening With Dio&quot; and featured a regular set, and then a second set of the band playing &quot;Holy Diver&quot; in its entirety. A DVD of the tour was filmed in London. The audio of this performance, a double CD named &quot;Holy Diver – Live&quot; was released in April 2006.

In 2007, it was announced that Black Sabbath would reunite with Dio and go under the name Heaven &amp; Hell. The band released &quot;The Devil You Know&quot; in 2009.

Dio&#x27;s involvement with Heaven &amp; Hell delayed the recording of what was to be the follow-up to &quot;Master of the Moon&quot;, &quot;Magica II&quot;. The three-year hiatus was briefly interrupted for a 10 concert European mini-tour in May/June 2008, and was scheduled to be interrupted again in November/December 2009 with 22 concerts starting in the UK and ending in Germany.
Doug Aldrich was to have filled in for Craig Goldy on guitar on these dates, who had other obligations. Dio intended to release a new single, entitled &quot;Electra&quot;, to coincide with the tour. This would have been their first studio material in 5 years. The band also intended to record an album or two in 2010.

On November 18, 2009, the European tour was cancelled due to Dio&#x27;s hospitalization. He had been diagnosed with stomach cancer, and was undergoing treatment. His manager and wife Wendy Dio thanked well-wishers and said &quot;After he kills this dragon, Ronnie will be back on stage, where he belongs, doing what he loves best, performing for his fans.&quot;

On February 19, 2010, it was announced on Dio&#x27;s official website that he would release a box set, entitled the &quot;Tournado Box Set&quot;, for limited purchase. The set includes the &quot;Killing the Dragon&quot; CD, &quot;Evil or Divine&quot; DVD (PAL format only), DVD bonus material, interviews, photo gallery, never-before-seen behind the scenes footage, promo video for the &quot;Killing the Dragon&quot; track &quot;Push&quot;, exclusive Dio cards, and the bonus CD single &quot;Electra&quot; (which is the last song the band recorded), from the unfinished albums &quot;Magica II &amp; Magica III&quot;.

===Death of Ronnie James Dio===
Dio died on May 16, 2010, of stomach cancer at the Texas Medical Center in Houston, Texas, at the age of 67.

On November 9, 2010, a posthumous live album was released. Titled &quot;Dio at Donington UK: Live 1983 &amp; 1987&quot;, it features Dio&#x27;s 1983 and 1987 appearances at the Monsters of Rock festival and showcases several songs from the Dio era of both Rainbow and Black Sabbath, in addition to songs from Dio&#x27;s own catalogue.

When being interviewed by Classic Rock Magazine from the UK, Dio guitarist Craig Goldy stated &quot;We were working on tracks for a new Dio album just before Ronnie died in May. And we did almost finish one song. Wendy [Dio, Ronnie&#x27;s widow/manager] has been talking about reissuing [DIO&#x27;s] &#x27;Magica&#x27; album (originally released in 2000) with bonus tracks, including this one.&quot; Goldy goes on to say of the lyrics, that they were written by Dio when he was fighting cancer, and are &quot;very emotional&quot; and &quot;hard to listen to without a lump at the back of your throat&quot;.

On March 18, it was announced that the surviving members of the final line-up of Dio would embark on a project with former Judas Priest front man Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens under the moniker DIO Disciples. The project has been touring extensively since 2011.

In May 2012, former Dio guitarist Vivian Campbell, despite his long established feud with Dio, announced his intent to reunite the original Dio band for a potential series of shows. This would include himself, drummer Vinny Appice, bassist Jimmy Bain, and keyboardist Claude Schnell. This announced line-up would feature former Lynch Mob vocalist and The Offspring touring member Andrew Freeman stepping in for Dio. and would perform under the name Last in Line.

==Murray==
Murray is the demonic-looking mascot of Dio who appears on several of Dio&#x27;s album covers, including &quot;Holy Diver&quot;, &quot;The Last in Line&quot; and &quot;Dream Evil&quot;, as well as on some of their singles and compilation albums. He was also featured in the sets for live shows.

=== &quot;Holy Diver&quot; ===
Dio&#x27;s first studio album, &quot;Holy Diver&quot;, from 1983, was the first to feature Murray on its cover. Murray appears to be a demon torturing a cleric, but Ronnie James Dio said that it is not necessarily clear which one is the monster and which one is the priest.

===&quot;The Last in Line&quot;===
Murray is also featured on Dio&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;The Last in Line&quot;. On this cover, resurrected souls emerge from their graves on Judgment Day to find a gigantic Murray staring at them from the far horizon.

===&quot;Dream Evil&quot;===
Murray is not featured on Dio&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Sacred Heart&quot;, but is, for the last time in his original form, featured on the cover of &quot;Dream Evil&quot;. He is shown in the window of a bedroom with a child sleeping in a bed, while being haunted by several different spooky creatures. Murray&#x27;s story is printed in the &quot;Dream Evil Tour&quot; book. The cover art of &quot;Dream Evil&quot; is a reference to one of the tracks on the album, &quot;Faces in the Window&quot; (the entire album&#x27;s concept is fears and superstitions about the night and darkness).

==Legacy==
Comedy rock duo Tenacious D released a song on their first album entitled &quot;Dio&quot;, written as a tribute to Dio, which mocked him somewhat for being too old and stated that Tenacious D were going to take over his position as masters of heavy metal. Before playing the song live, Jack Black would typically speak about how Dio&#x27;s tenure in Black Sabbath served as his inspiration to get into heavy metal. The duo appeared in the music video for Dio&#x27;s song &quot;Push&quot;, and he in turn appeared and sang in Tenacious D&#x27;s comedy movie &quot;The Pick of Destiny&quot;.

The Dio patch on the denim jacket worn by Eddie Munson (played by Joe Quinn) in a season of the Netflix show Stranger Things is made using a t-shirt from Ronnie James Dio&#x27;s personal estate. The show’s costume designer, Amy Parris, in a Q&amp;A posted on the Netflix website said, “He&#x27;s (Munson) a fan of wizard metal, he&#x27;s a fan of Dio. He&#x27;s a fan of Metallica. Actually, Dio was a popular band in the &#x27;80s, and we reached out to the estate. His wife is in charge of his estate and offered to send us vintage T-shirts, which was such a dream.&quot;

The 1989 Nintendo Entertainment System video game &quot;Holy Diver&quot; was named after the band&#x27;s song of the same title and incorporates the members of the band as its protagonists, despite not being licensed from the band.

The character Dio Brando, the main antagonist of the manga series &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot; is named after the band. This has two meanings, as both a reference to the band and to the Italian for &quot;God&quot;, referencing the character&#x27;s high self-esteem.

<text>Goodhart&#x27;s law is an adage often stated as, &quot;When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure&quot;. It is named after British economist Charles Goodhart, who is credited with expressing the core idea of the adage in a 1975 article on monetary policy in the United Kingdom:
It was used to criticize the British Thatcher government for trying to conduct monetary policy on the basis of targets for broad and narrow money, but the law reflects a much more general phenomenon.

==Priority and background==

Numerous concepts are related to this idea, at least one of which predates Goodhart&#x27;s statement. Notably, Campbell&#x27;s law likely has precedence, as Jeff Rodamar has argued, since various formulations date to 1969. Other academics had similar insights at the time. Jerome Ravetz&#x27;s 1971 book &quot;Scientific Knowledge and Its Social Problems&quot; also predates Goodhart, though it does not formulate the same law. He discusses how systems in general can be gamed, focuses on cases where the goals of a task are complex, sophisticated, or subtle. In such cases, the persons possessing the skills to execute the tasks properly seek their own goals to the detriment of the assigned tasks. When the goals are instantiated as metrics, this could be seen as equivalent to Goodhart and Campbell&#x27;s claim.

Shortly after Goodhart&#x27;s publication, others suggested closely related ideas, including the Lucas critique (1976). As applied in economics, the law is also implicit in the idea of rational expectations, a theory in economics that states that those who are aware of a system of rewards and punishments will optimize their actions within that system to achieve their desired results. For example, if an employee is rewarded by the number of cars sold each month, they will try to sell more cars, even at a loss.

While it originated in the context of market responses, the law has profound implications for the selection of high-level targets in organizations. Jon Danielsson states the law as

And suggested a corollary for use in financial risk modelling:

Mario Biagioli related the concept to consequences of using citation impact measures to estimate the importance of scientific publications:

==Generalization==
Later writers generalized Goodhart&#x27;s point about monetary policy into a more general adage about measures and targets in accounting and evaluation systems. In a book chapter published in 1996, Keith Hoskin wrote:

In a 1997 paper responding to the work of Hoskin and others on financial accounting and grades in education, anthropologist Marilyn Strathern expressed Goodhart&#x27;s Law as &quot;When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure&quot;, and linked the sentiment to the history of accounting stretching back into Britain in the 1800s:

== Examples ==

* The San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment denounces several problems in science and as Goodhart&#x27;s law explains, one of them is that measurement has become a target. The correlation between h-index and scientific awards is decreasing since widespread usage of h-index.
* The International Union for Conservation of Nature&#x27;s (IUCN) measure of extinction can be used to remove environmental protections, which resulted in IUCN becoming more conservative in labeling something as extinct.
* In healthcare, the misapplication of metrics can lead to adverse outcomes. For instance, hospitals striving to reduce length of stay (LOS) may inadvertently discharge patients prematurely, leading to increased emergency readmissions.
* According to Tom and David Chivers in &quot;How to Read Numbers&quot;, the law applied to the British government response to the COVID-19 pandemic when it announced a target of 100,000 COVID-19 tests per day—initially a target for tests actually carried out and later for maximum capacity of test-taking. The number of useful diagnostic tests was far lower than the government-reported number when it announced it had met the target.
* In the HBO television series &quot;The Wire&quot;, Roland &#x27;Prezbo&#x27; Pryzbylewski draws parallels between public school policy of teaching to the test and improving crime statistics through reclassification of those crimes as &quot;juking the stats&quot;. He notes that they both are examples of strategies that are ineffective at substantive improvements in learning and public safety respectively because they cater to ineffective metrics of standardized test scores and reported crime rates.

<text>Robert Barnes ( – 30 July 1540) was an English reformer and martyr.

==Life==
Barnes was born in King&#x27;s Lynn, Norfolk in 1495, and was educated at Cambridge, where he was an Augustinian priest of the Austin Friars. Sometime after 1514 he was sent to study in Leuven. Barnes returned to Cambridge in the early 1520s, where he graduated Doctor of Divinity in 1523, and, soon after, was made Prior of his Cambridge convent.

John Foxe says that Barnes was one of the Cambridge men who gathered at the White Horse Tavern for Bible-reading and theological discussion in the early 1530s. At the encouragement of Thomas Bilney, Barnes preached at the Christmas Day Midnight Mass in 1525 at St Edward&#x27;s Church in Cambridge. Barnes&#x27; sermon, although against clerical pomp and ecclesiastical abuses, was neither particularly unorthodox nor surprising. However, after seeing a churchwarden whose civil suit resulted in the imprisonment of a local man, Fr. Barnes departed from his prepared text to denounce lawsuits by one Christian against another - inside the parish church of Cambridge University&#x27;s College of Lawyers. At a time when King Henry VIII and Cardinal Wolsey were attempting to stop the smuggling of Martin Luther&#x27;s books into England from the Continent, Barnes&#x27; remarks immediately drew suspicion.

As a result, in 1526 Barnes was brought before the vice-chancellor for preaching a heretical sermon, and was subsequently interrogated by Wolsey and four other bishops. He was ordered to abjure his sermon or be burnt; and, after choosing the former, was committed to the Fleet prison, but afterwards conditionally released to the Austin Friary in London. Although under house arrest in the Friary, Barnes was allowed visitors. It was subsequently discovered that while incarcerated there, Barnes was secretly a distributor of illegal copies of William Tyndale&#x27;s Protestant Bible.

He escaped to Antwerp in 1528, and also visited Wittenberg, where he became good friends with Martin Luther. While at Wittenberg in the summer of 1531, Barnes was commissioned to ascertain the opinion of Luther and other continental divines on the divorce proceedings between Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon. That year he also published the first edition of &quot;A Supplication&quot;, which essentially outlined Lutheran theology in an appeal to Henry VIII. Stephen Vaughan, an agent of Thomas Cromwell in the Low Countries and an advanced reformer, came across a copy of Barnes&#x27;s work and was so impressed by his description of Lutheran political philosophy that he pleaded with Cromwell to invite the exile home.

In late 1531 Barnes returned to England, becoming one of the chief intermediaries between the English Court and the Lutheran German States, and he spent the next several years going between England and Germany. He was a vocal defender of King Henry&#x27;s policy of Caesaropapism, in the vain hope that the King would choose Lutheranism for the theology of the Church of England. In 1539 Barnes was employed in negotiating with William, Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg for King Henry&#x27;s marriage to Anne of Cleves. The policy was Cromwell&#x27;s, but Henry VIII had already in 1538 refused to embrace Lutheranism, and the statute of Six Articles, followed by the immediate annulment of the King&#x27;s marriage to Anne of Cleves in 1540, ultimately brought Cromwell and all other agents of his policies to ruin.

A denunciation by Barnes of Bishop Stephen Gardiner in a sermon at St Paul&#x27;s Cross launched a battle to the death between the Crypto-Lutheran, Crypto-Calvinist, and Crypto-Catholic courtiers in King Henry&#x27;s council, which raged during the spring of 1540. Barnes was forced to apologise and recant; and Bishop Gardiner delivered a series of counter-sermons at St Paul&#x27;s Cross. But a month later Cromwell was made earl of Essex, Gardiner&#x27;s friend, Bishop Sampson, was sent to the Tower, and Barnes openly reverted to Lutheranism, but it proved a delusive victory. In July, however, Cromwell was attainted, the marriage between the King and Anne of Cleves was annulled and Barnes was convicted of heresy and sentenced to execution by burning.

On 30 July, 1540, Barnes and five other religious dissidents were drawn on hurdles from the Tower of London to Smithfield for execution. In a deeply ironic moment, each hurdle carried both a condemned Lutheran pastor and a condemned Catholic priest.

The two fellow Lutherans pastors; William Jerome and Thomas Gerrard, were, like Barnes, burnt at the stake for heresy under the Six Articles. Meanwhile, three Roman Catholic priests: Fr .Thomas Abel, Fr. Richard Fetherstone and Barnes&#x27; companion on the hurdle, Fr. Edward Powell, were hanged, drawn, and quartered, officially for high treason, but in reality for rejecting both the King&#x27;s title as Supreme Head of the Church of England and State control over the Church.

==Legacy==
Both Catholics and Lutherans throughout Europe were shocked and horrified by the executions. Some historians have concluded that Barnes was crucial in having the English Protestants and Catholics alike understand the Reformation around them. 

The feast day of Rev. Barnes and his two companions is commemorated every year on the Lutheran Calendar of Saints.

The three Catholic priests executed with Barnes were among the fifty-four English Catholic Martyrs who were Beatified by Pope Leo XIII on 29 December, 1886.

==Literature==
* Shortly after their executions, a dialogue in verse was published, &quot;The Metynge of Doctor Barnes and Dr. Powell at Paradise Gate and of theyre communicacion bothe drawen to Smithfylde fro the Towar&quot; (London, 1540), in the British Museum. 
* Martin Luther published Barnes&#x27; confession after writing a preface of his own as &quot;Bekenntnis des Glaubens&quot; (1540).
* Robert Barnes also appears in &quot;The Mirror &amp; the Light&quot;, by Hilary Mantel.

<doc id="159960" wikidata="Q7787404" url="?curid=159960" title="Thomas Barnes (journalist)">
<text>Thomas Barnes (11 September 1785 – 7 May 1841) was an English journalist, essayist, and editor. He is best known for his work with &quot;The Times&quot; which he edited from 1817 until his death in 1841.

==Early life and education==
Barnes was the eldest son of John Barnes, a solicitor, and his wife Mary, &quot;née&quot; Anderson. After his mother&#x27;s death, Barnes was raised by his grandmother before beginning his education at Christ&#x27;s Hospital. When the school moved to Horsham in 1902 he had a boarding house named after him. While he was there he was a contemporary of Leigh Hunt and Thomas Mitchell, later a prominent academic. From there Barnes went up to Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he excelled both academically and athletically. While at Pembroke, Barnes studied classics, and he took his degree in 1808 as head of the senior optimes.

After considering a career as an academic, Barnes acceded to his family&#x27;s wishes and embarked on a career in the law, moving to London in 1809 and entering the Inner Temple. While working at his new profession, Barnes joined the famous literary circle of which Hunt, Charles Lamb and William Hazlitt were prominent members. Barnes enjoyed the entertainments of the West End, and he indulged his appetites frequently, much to the detriment of his physical appearance.

==Career in journalism==
With his legal career characterised by drudgery, Barnes sought an outlet for his talents. He found this through his friendship with Barron Field, who was the theatre critic for &quot;The Times&quot;. Through Field, Barnes met John Walter, who soon employed Barnes as a journalist reporting on law cases, politics and the theatre. Upon Field&#x27;s retirement Barnes succeeded him as theatre critic, and in 1811 he became a member of the parliamentary staff. As part of his duties he penned a number of parliamentary sketches, which were later collected and published in a book, &quot;Parliamentary Portraits&quot;, in 1815. During this period, he also wrote for Leigh Hunt&#x27;s publications the &quot;Examiner&quot; and the &quot;Reflector&quot;.

===Editor of &quot;The Times&quot;===
Walter&#x27;s trust in Barnes was soon demonstrated when in 1815 Walter empowered him revise the controversial leading articles written by the intemperate John Stoddart, then the editor of the paper. Upon Stoddart&#x27;s dismissal at the end of 1816 Barnes was named as his successor as editor, assuming a position which he held until his death. As editor, Barnes came to enjoy a greater degree of control over the paper than his predecessors, and received a share of ownership in the paper. He used it to reshape the paper, analysing events rather than merely summarising them, and making the leading article a central component of the paper. With the Peterloo Massacre in August 1819 he inaugurated a policy of support for the Whig opposition in Parliament that contrasted with his predecessor&#x27;s staunchly pro-Tory stance. He became a close friend of Henry Brougham, who was an important source of information for Barnes&#x27;s leading articles.

During Barnes&#x27;s editorship, the influence and the scope of &quot;The Times&quot; grew, and with it its prominence in public affairs. Moved by what he saw during a trip to Ireland, Barnes became a passionate supporter of Catholic Emancipation. By the early 1830s his paper had earned the nickname &quot;The Thunderer&quot;, with Robert Peel declaring it to be &quot;a powerful advocate of Reform&quot; and his colleague Lord Lyndhurst describing Barnes as &quot;the most powerful man in the country.&quot; It was during this period that Barnes shifted politically, opposing the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 and falling out with Brougham.

Barnes feuded with Lord Palmerston, who manipulated public opinion to enhance his control of foreign affairs. Palmerston leaked secrets to the press, published selected documents, and released letters to give himself more control and more publicity, all the while stirring up British nationalism. Barnes refused to play along with his propaganda ploys.

==Personal life==
Though Barnes never married, he had a relationship for over two decades with Dinah Mary Mondet. Together they lived at 49 Nelson Square Southwark, London from 1821 to 1836 and then at 25 Soho Square, London. After Barnes&#x27;s death in 1841, Dinah Mondet continued to live in their home in Soho Square until her own death in 1852, after which she was buried next to Barnes in Kensal Green Cemetery. It is probable (from correspondence with the volume, between A. N. L. Munby and the Archivist of The Times, in 1971) that an auction catalogue of &#x27;A valuable collection of books ... comprising the library of an editor, deceased&#x27; and sold by Mr Fletcher on 11-13 May 1842 represents Barnes&#x27;s library, sold by &#x27;the administratrix&#x27;, presumably Mondet. A copy of the catalogue is at Cambridge University Library (shelfmark Munby.c.155(29)).

<text>RAF Coastal Command was a formation within the Royal Air Force (RAF). It was founded in 1936, when the RAF was restructured into Fighter, Bomber and Coastal commands and played an important role during the Second World War. Maritime Aviation had been neglected in the inter-war period, due to disagreements between the Royal Navy (RN) and RAF over the ownership, roles and investment in maritime air power.

The Admiralty&#x27;s main concern until 1937 was the return of the Fleet Air Arm to the Royal Navy while the RAF concentrated on the development of a bombing force to provide a deterrent. Coastal Command was referred to as the &quot;Cinderella Service&quot; by A V Alexander, the First Lord of the Admiralty in November 1940. Soon after RAF Coastal Area was elevated to Coastal Command, its headquarters moved from Lee-on-Solent to Northwood in northwest London.

During the Second World War, Coastal Command&#x27;s most important contribution was the protection of Allied convoys from attacks by the U-boats of the German &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;. It also protected Allied shipping from aerial attacks by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. The main operations of Coastal Command were defensive, defending supply lines in the Battle of the Atlantic, as well as the Mediterranean, Middle East, and African theatres. It operated from bases in the United Kingdom, Iceland, Gibraltar, the Soviet Union, West Africa and North Africa. It also had an offensive capacity, in the North Sea, Arctic, Mediterranean and Baltic, strike wings attacked German shipping carrying war materials from Italy to North Africa and from Scandinavia to Germany.

By 1943 Coastal Command finally received sufficient Very Long Range [VLR] aircraft and its operations proved decisive in the victory over the U-boats. These aircraft were Consolidated B-24 Liberators and from early 1943, these and other Coastal Command aircraft, were fitted with ASV Mark III [air-to-surface vessel] centimetric radar, the latest depth charges, including homing torpedoes, officially classed as Mark 24 mines [nicknamed &#x27;Wandering Annie&#x27; or &#x27;Wandering Willie&#x27;] and even rockets. The Command saw action from the first day of hostilities until the last day of the Second World War.

Coastal Command completed one million flying hours, 240,000 operations and destroyed 212 U-boats. Coastal Command casualties amounted to 2,060 aircraft to all causes. From 1940 to 1945 Coastal Command sank 366 German transport vessels and damaged 134. The total tonnage sunk was 512,330 tons and another 513,454 tons damaged. 10,663 persons were rescued by the Command, comprising 5,721 Allied crew members, 277 enemy personnel and 4,665 non-aircrews. A total of 5,866 Coastal Command personnel were killed in action. During the Cold War, Coastal Command concentrated on anti-submarine warfare preparations against the fleets of the Warsaw Pact. In 1969, Coastal Command was subsumed into the new Strike Command, which had also absorbed the former Bomber, Fighter and Signals Commands and later absorbed Air Support Command, the former Transport Command.

==Formation and neglect==

In 1936, almost 18 years after the end of the First World War, there was a change in the command structure of the RAF. Several Expansion Schemes were heading at such pace to re-arm the British military in face of the Nazi threat that &quot;Area&quot; formations were now to be called &quot;Commands&quot;. Fighter and Bomber Areas became Fighter and Bomber Commands and Coastal Area was renamed Coastal Command. Its headquarters was located at Lee-on-Solent. Air Marshal Sir Arthur Longmore, Air Officer Commanding (AOC) RAF Coastal Area oversaw the renaming and handed over command to Air Marshal Philip Joubert de la Ferté on 24 August 1936.

In March 1935 the threat from Nazi Germany prompted a series of expansion schemes which pushed the number of squadrons up to 163 (as per Expansion Scheme M, the last before the outbreak of war) and the number of aircraft to 2,549. The scheme was never fully implemented, and Scheme F, 124 Squadrons and 1,736 aircraft, was the only scheme that ran its full course. It did produce modern aircraft and it made adequate provision for reserves (75 per cent) but again, the bomber forces received no less than 50 per cent which averaged 57 per cent over all schemes. Maritime air units never made up more than 12 per cent of British air strength. From a pre-expansion strength of just five squadrons, four of which were flying boats, the figure of maritime squadrons rose to 18 by September 1939, with a strength of just 176 aircraft. Some 16 of these were allocated to trade defence but given Trenchard&#x27;s policy (which was still in place after his retirement) of developing bombers for the maritime arm which could bolster the air offensive, most were not specialised anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft. The Air Ministry was thoroughly uninterested in any aircraft which fell outside the bomber function.

De la Ferté was highly critical of the Air Ministry&#x27;s attitude to his service. In 1937 several exercises were carried out by Coastal Command in co-operation with submarines against the Home Fleet to judge the surface fleet&#x27;s defence against submarine and air attack. Despite the experiences of the First World War, no attention was paid to the problem of attacking submarines from the air as part of trade protection measures. Owing to misplaced faith in the imperfect ASDIC invention which was never intended to detect surface-running submarines, it appeared the Royal Navy no longer considered U-boats a threat to Britain&#x27;s sea lanes. The Air Ministry, keen to concentrate on strategic air forces, did not dispute the Admiralty&#x27;s conclusions and Coastal Command did not receive any guidance from the Air Ministry. The saving grace for both services was the construction of the Combined Headquarters which enabled rapid collaboration in maritime operations. This was one of the few successes in organisation and preparation made before the outbreak of war.

When the review of the role Coastal Command was to play in war was assessed in 1937, the AOC Sir Frederick Bowhill was informed by his Senior Air Staff Officer, Air Commodore Geoffrey Bromet, that the other two commands (Bomber and Fighter) had clear mission objectives while Coastal Command had been given no clear mandate. It was assumed that Coastal Command was to keep sea communications open for merchant shipping and prevent seaborne raids on British coastlines and ports. No mention of U-boats was made by either man. Both apparently assumed aircraft and surface raiders presented the greater threat in British waters, thus following the Admiralty line that U-boats were no longer a threat. When Admiral Sir Dudley Pound enquired about aerial assets in trade and commerce defence, Chief of the Air Staff Cyril Newall, replied that there was not enough &quot;jam&quot; [resources] to go around and stated it was more advisable to risk losses on trade routes than weaken the RAF&#x27;s ability to protect Britain from air attack and bomb its enemies.

In March 1937, the Director of Operations, Group Captain Robert Saundby, complained that the role for Coastal Command in war, namely supporting the bomber offensive and second, the support of naval forces along the British coastline, were too limited and was in danger of diverting the Command from its main concern: ASW. In October the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff (DCAS) Air Vice Marshal Richard Peirse confirmed that there was no formal role for the service or location of its units. Peirse did reverse the decision to have strategic bombing support as the primary function. This was changed to trade defence, Coastal Command was only to be used for other purposes if trade routes were suffering little interference and the intensity of air attack on Britain, or air attacks on enemy targets, required all available air units for those purposes. In December 1937, the Naval and Air Staffs met again and changed the priority to North Sea reconnaissance. The Naval Staff insisted that surface commerce raiders presented the greatest danger and aircraft could prove decisive only in locating enemy warships. ASW remained in third place, after direct co-operation with surface fleets. In December 1938, this was changed again and ASW moved up to second priority. In August 1939 it was moved to first priority. When Coastal Command went to war, its first task was to co-operate with the Navy to prevent enemy vessels from escaping into the North Sea and Atlantic Oceans. Secondly, it was to provide ASW support where and when it could. These steps are significant as the language indicates a change from passive reconnaissance of enemy warships and submarines to an active directive which involved the attack of the vessels by Coastal Command aircraft.

Since the late 1920s the tension between the air and naval services had declined. It arose briefly again in 1937 when the question of the FAA operational control arose. On this occasion the British Government sided with the Admiralty. Despite a spirited defence of its asset, once the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, Sir Thomas Inskip had decided to transfer the arm, the Air Ministry was content to let the matter rest. Any threat to the Air Ministry&#x27;s existence had long since passed; budgetary constraint and the reluctance to engage in another battle which would waste resources were also factors in the Air Ministry&#x27;s decision not to contest the issue further. Inter-service squabbling assured maritime aviation&#x27;s stagnation, especially in shore-based elements. Virtually no co-operation existed in the area of research and development. In the case of Coastal Command, it continued to come third in the Air Ministry&#x27;s list of priorities, after Fighter and Bomber Commands, well into the late 1930s.

==Second World War==

===Early war===
From its formation in 1936, Coastal Command did not receive the support it required to be an effective naval air service. In September 1939 Nazi Germany invaded Poland beginning the war in Europe. The Command&#x27;s position was comfortable for the first nine months of the war, the period known as the Phoney War. German submarines were not able to reach the Atlantic unless they undertook a dangerous transit journey through the North Sea and around Britain&#x27;s northern waters or through the English Channel, which was guarded by the Royal and French Navies. The powerful French Navy was responsible for covering half of the Atlantic shipping routes and thus contributed half of the Allied forces available.

The events of April to June 1940 overturned the balance of naval and air power, as the Germans conquered Denmark, Norway, The Netherlands, Belgium and France. The occupation of these countries permitted the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; and &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; to operate from French ports on the Atlantic coast, hundreds of miles closer to the Atlantic shipping lanes. German medium bombers could also reach British ports on the westernmost and northernmost coasts. The advantage enjoyed by the Germans, allowed them to interdict merchant shipping supplying food and war materials to Britain much more effectively, which had the potential to starve Britain. While merchant shipping was suffering these losses, Coastal Command had proven ineffective at countering German air and sea attacks on shipping. But the command could not protect English Channel convoys, and was forced to abandon operations until July 1940. RAF Fighter Command was given the task, supplying air attack and defence with the enemy. Warning signs after the First World War, that U-boats could become a serious threat once again, meant that aircraft would be the best counter to their operations. This fact not being fully understood, Coastal Command became the &quot;Cinderella service&quot; until about 1943.

The situation would not improve until 1942. Coastal Command did operate with effect alongside RAF Bomber Command in disrupting enemy shipping during the Battle of Britain in 1940. Coastal Command attacked shipping and mined waters around invasion ports. The German invasion of Britain in 1940, Operation Sea Lion, was eventually cancelled owing to the German defeat in the Battle of Britain.

During the first three years of the Second World War, Coastal Command and the Admiralty fought a battle with the RAF and Air Ministry over the primacy of trade defence, in relation to the bomber effort against mainland Germany, a strategic tussle which conceivably could have cost the Western Alliance the Battle of the Atlantic. The Air Staff and Bomber Command enjoyed the backing of Churchill and the maritime air effort struggled to receive the recognition it needed. On the outbreak of war, the order of battle listed just 298 aircraft, of which only 171 were operational. On 15 February 1941, Coastal Command was placed under the operational control of the Admiralty. Instrumental in improving the strike rate against submarines was scientific advisor and assistant director of research E. J. Williams, who applied scientific analysis to the logistical problems to great effect. Williams was present at some meetings of the Cabinet Anti-U-boat Committee at 10 Downing Street, under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister.

Owing to the starvation of resources, even as late as March 1943, the Atlantic supply lines were being threatened. This situation arose as a direct result of the lack of very long-range aircraft. Despite the enormous losses of the disastrous 1940–1942 period, known to the Germans as the &quot;First&quot; and &quot;Second Happy Time&quot;, the Air Ministry refused to invest in trade defence. Further delays in resource procurement might have led to German success, which could have defeated Britain and forced it out of the war or at least caused a postponement of Operation Torch, the Allied landings in French North-West Africa in 1942 and Operation Overlord, the landing in France, in 1944. Other research indicates that losses unquestionably affected the build-up for Operation Neptune, the naval phase of the landings in Europe.

===Mid and later war===
Eventually the Command was given the investment it needed. Radar and long-range aircraft enabled the Command to hunt and destroy U-boats with growing efficiency. German submarines had been sinking a large number of Allied ships in the Atlantic Gap, which was a stretch of water in the central Atlantic beyond the range of most Allied aircraft. The covering of the gap by very-long-range aircraft equipped with radar helped reduce the effectiveness of U-boats. In May 1943 the campaign reached a peak, when a large number of U-boats were sunk with little loss to Allied shipping; Coastal Command had gained the initiative and it was known by the Germans as Black May. Thereafter the suppression of German submarines was effective in the Atlantic and in their transit routes through the Bay of Biscay in 1942, 1943 and 1944. In June 1944 the Normandy landings and subsequent Operation Overlord liberated France and cost the Germans their air and submarine bases won in 1940. The U-boats were forced to relocate to Norway and Germany in August, restoring many of the difficulties faced by the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; in 1939 and early 1940. The entire strategic position, which had been the foundation of the U-boat war since June 1940 had been undermined.

In the last three years of the war, Coastal Command sank more U-boats than any other service and continued to hold the technological advantage from 1943. A brief threat, in the shape of the German Type XXI submarine emerged but was too late to alter the course of the war. Technological answers to the Type XXI were available in the form of 3-centimetre radar and magnetic anomaly detectors in aircraft. At midnight 4 June 1945, official wartime operations ceased. The last mission was flown by Wing Commander J. Barret DFC, commanding officer of No. 201 Squadron RAF. By that time over 2,000 decorations had been awarded. These included four Victoria Crosses, of whom only one survived the war, 17 George Medals, and 82 Distinguished Service Orders.

==Cold War==

===Beginnings===

The capitulation of Germany in May 1945 was followed by a rapid rundown of Coastal Command with the immediate disbandment of combat units and the transfer of aircraft to the RAF Transport Command. Commonwealth personnel were also sent home and the powerful Bristol Beaufighter and de Havilland Mosquito wings were reduced. The Command still maintained strong air-sea-rescue Air-sea rescue (ASR) and reconnaissance forces but its ASW was lopsided. With a few exceptions, only a handful of squadrons with ASW aircraft remained by January 1946.

While the Command retained a minimum peacetime force and the Air Ministry had every intention of maintaining it as such, the fleet was further reduced and suffered from procurement problems. The Short Shetland and Short Seaford were rejected as replacements for the Consolidated B-24 Liberator. A maritime version of the promising Avro Lincoln had yet to be ordered by the time the Lend-Lease programme ended in August 1945. The Short Sunderland was forced to continue as the main operational type until the end of 1946. Most of the aircraft that operated in the command were the Second World War types; the Spitfire, Lancaster, Mosquito and Beaufighter.

The Command was kept busy in the late 1940s. Units were sent to the Middle East and Palestine as part of an air policing policy, in co-operation with the Israeli Air Force and Egyptian Air Force to prevent conflict between the two countries owing to the formation of the state of Israel in 1948. While there, they undertook a major operation, Operation Bobcat, to prevent illegal Jewish migrants coming into Palestine. In May 1948 the variety of aircraft was reduced despite increasing demand for operations. In May, Palestinians began attacking British military installations throughout the region. In the largest British post-war action, Operation Dawn (13 to 14 May 1948) was launched with the support of Coastal Command.

On 28 June 1948 Coastal Command was also involved in the Berlin Airlift. The Soviet Union attempted to cut off all aid to the city which was jointly occupied by the four major powers, the Soviets in the east, and the Americans, French and British in the west. The joint American-British operation continued for almost a year. Coastal Command aircraft were involved as flying boats were the only aircraft with internal anti-corrosion treatment allowing bulk salt to be transported. The Command&#x27;s operations grew in intensity. By 13 July daily sorties had risen to 16. By October it was 214 sorties (other RAF Commands were also flying in supplies). The flying boats made their flight in using the Elbe river, but these operations came to a close on 14 December 1948, when the hazard from uncharted sandbanks and wreckage which, in some cases had been deliberately placed there by the Soviets to prevent the Western Allies from supplying the city, made operations impractical. Over 1,000 sorties had been made, and 4,500 tons of supplies were flown in and 1,113 people, mainly children, evacuated.

===Soviet threat===
NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, began preparations for a military defence of Western Europe by incorporating most West European nations into a defence pact against alleged Soviet aggression in April 1951. This led to the militarisation of West Germany in 1955 and was met with the militarisation of East Germany soon after and its merger into the Warsaw Pact alliance with the Soviet Union. The purpose of Coastal Command was to help bolster the defence and guard against a potential Soviet naval threat in Atlantic and European waters. For Coastal Command the main concern was the Atlantic. On 1 March 1950 it had lost the photo reconnaissance units to RAF Bomber Command. The transfer was not complete when North Korea invaded South Korea beginning the Korean War. Handley Page Hastings were hastily modified and ready for operations but were not sent, owing to the need for ASW aircraft in the Eastern Atlantic.

The Avro Shackleton was the main operational aircraft in the 1950s, replacing the wartime Liberator GRs, along with the Neptune MR.1s. At the end of August 1951, No. 201 Squadron RAF became the first unit to complete training on the type. In mid-1953 the order of battle consisted of eight Shackleton squadrons; one at Gibraltar, four covering the South-Western Approaches in the Atlantic and three more covering the North-Western Approaches. This force numbered 64 aircraft. A further four Sunderland squadrons with 20 aircraft were split between the North-Western and South-Western Approaches. The Neptunes, numbering 32 aircraft in four squadrons, covered the North-Eastern and Eastern Approaches. The Helicopter also joined Coastal Command. Bristol Sycamores entered service in 1953 and 16 aircraft were dispersed in Britain for ASW. In March the Avro Lancaster was finally phased out of Coastal Command service.

The Command was too expensive to maintain and cost cuts were made during the 1950s which caused a reduction in strength. By mid-1957 the Command had been cut to 82 aircraft. By mid-1958 it had shrunk to just 67. The Shackletons dominated the core of this force, numbering 54 aircraft. The Neptune was cut from the service altogether, beginning on 31 August 1956. There was little operational action for the Command at this point. It airlifted British Army forces into Egypt during the Suez Crisis which was its major action during this period. The lack of funds and any active conventional military role saw the Command struggle to keep its front-line strength high. There was a brief alert in October 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, when all six squadrons it then possessed were put on high alert, but nothing came of the crisis, although the Shackleton squadrons at RAF Ballykelly were sent to Macrihanish as it was known that Ballykelly was on the Soviet IRBM target list.

In the early 1960s the Soviet Navy and Communist Bloc&#x27;s fishing fleets began operating around the British Isles in increasing numbers. The British public began taking an interest in their operations as civilian fisherman began complaining about their presence. Operation Chacewater began, in which Coastal Command began monitoring their movements, in particular other vessels that loitered in areas covering the arrival and departure routes for Royal Navy nuclear submarine forces. Soon after, counter operations such as Operation Adjutant were carried out, which was aimed at searching for Soviet submarines. The main threat from the Soviets in the Atlantic came from the Soviet Northern Fleet and in early 1965 most of the Command&#x27;s units were concentrated in No. 18 Group RAF, based in Scotland to monitor their activities. No recorded confrontation took place between Coastal Command and Soviet naval forces during this time, although both the Shackletons from RAF Ballykelly and frigates from Londonderry would &#x27;ping&#x27; the Soviet submarines carrying out surveillance off the mouth of Lough Foyle. In at least one instance, a Ballykelly-based Shackleton lost its radome when making a mock attack on the Russian sub.

In 1969 the special-purpose Hawker-Siddeley Nimrod, based on the de Havilland Comet airliner, was introduced into RAF service and Coastal Command duties were passed on to general squadrons. The Nimrod was a replacement for the Shackleton and it began to do so on 2 October 1969. Less than eight weeks later, Coastal Command was disbanded and ceased to exist on 27 November 1969, when it was subsumed into RAF Strike Command.

<text>MPEG-1 Audio Layer II or MPEG-2 Audio Layer II (MP2, sometimes incorrectly called Musicam or MUSICAM) is a lossy audio compression format defined by ISO/IEC 11172-3 alongside MPEG-1 Audio Layer I and MPEG-1 Audio Layer III (MP3). While MP3 is much more popular for PC and Internet applications, MP2 remains a dominant standard for audio broadcasting.
==History of development from MP2 to MP3==
=== MUSICAM ===
MPEG-1 Audio Layer 2 encoding was derived from the MUSICAM (&quot;Masking pattern adapted Universal Subband Integrated Coding And Multiplexing&quot;) audio codec, developed by Centre commun d&#x27;études de télévision et télécommunications (CCETT), Philips, and the Institut für Rundfunktechnik (IRT) in 1989 as part of the EUREKA 147 pan-European inter-governmental research and development initiative for the development of a system for the broadcasting of audio and data to fixed, portable or mobile receivers (established in 1987).

It began as the Digital Audio Broadcast (DAB) project managed by Egon Meier-Engelen of the Deutsche Forschungs- und Versuchsanstalt für Luft- und Raumfahrt (later on called Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt, German Aerospace Center) in Germany. The European Community financed this project, commonly known as EU-147, from 1987 to 1994 as a part of the EUREKA research program.

The Eureka 147 System comprised three main elements: MUSICAM Audio Coding (&quot;Masking pattern Universal Sub-band Integrated Coding And Multiplexing&quot;), Transmission Coding &amp; Multiplexing and COFDM Modulation.

MUSICAM was one of the few codecs able to achieve high audio quality at bit rates in the range of 64 to 192 kbit/s per monophonic channel. It has been designed to meet the technical requirements of most applications (in the field of broadcasting, telecommunication and recording on digital storage media) — low delay, low complexity, error robustness, short access units, etc.

As a predecessor of the MP3 format and technology, the perceptual codec MUSICAM is based on integer arithmetics 32 subbands transform, driven by a psychoacoustic model. It was primarily designed for Digital Audio Broadcasting and digital TV, and disclosed by CCETT(France) and IRT (Germany) in Atlanta during an IEEE-ICASSP conference. This codec incorporated into a broadcasting system using COFDM modulation was demonstrated on air and on the field together with Radio Canada and CRC Canada during the NAB show (Las Vegas) in 1991. The implementation of the audio part of this broadcasting system was based on a two chips encoder (one for the subband transform, one for the psychoacoustic model designed by the team of G. Stoll (IRT Germany), later known as Psychoacoustic model I in the ISO MPEG audio standard) and a real time decoder using one Motorola 56001 DSP chip running an integer arithmetics software designed by Y.F. Dehery&#x27;s team (CCETT, France). The simplicity of the corresponding decoder together with the high audio quality of this codec using for the first time a 48 kHz sampling frequency, a 20 bits/sample input format (the highest available sampling standard in 1991, compatible with the AES/EBU professional digital input studio standard) were the main reasons to later adopt the characteristics of MUSICAM as the basic features for an advanced digital music compression codec such as MP3.

The audio coding algorithm used by the Eureka 147 Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) system has been subject to the standardization process within the ISO/Moving Pictures Expert Group (MPEG) in 1989–94. MUSICAM audio coding was used as a basis for some coding schemes of MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 Audio. Most key features of MPEG-1 Audio were directly inherited from MUSICAM, including the filter bank, time-domain processing, audio frame sizes, etc. However, improvements were made, and the actual MUSICAM algorithm was not used in the final MPEG-1 Audio Layer II standard.

Since the finalisation of MPEG-1 Audio and MPEG-2 Audio (in 1992 and 1994), the original MUSICAM algorithm is not used anymore. The name MUSICAM is often mistakenly used when MPEG-1 Audio Layer II is meant. This can lead to some confusion, because the name MUSICAM is trademarked by different companies in different regions of the world. (Musicam is the name used for MP2 in some specifications for Astra Digital Radio as well as in the BBC&#x27;s DAB documents.)

The Eureka Project 147 resulted in the publication of European Standard, ETS 300 401 in 1995, for DAB which now has worldwide acceptance. The DAB standard uses the MPEG-1 Audio Layer II (ISO/IEC 11172-3) for 48 kHz sampling frequency and the MPEG-2 Audio Layer II (ISO/IEC 13818-3) for 24 kHz sampling frequency.

=== MPEG Audio ===
In the late 1980s, ISO&#x27;s Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) started an effort to standardize digital audio and video encoding, expected to have a wide range of applications in digital radio and TV broadcasting (later DAB, DMB, DVB), and use on CD-ROM (later Video CD). The MUSICAM audio coding was one of 14 proposals for MPEG-1 Audio standard that were submitted to ISO in 1989.

The MPEG-1 Audio standard was based on the existing MUSICAM and ASPEC audio formats.
The MPEG-1 Audio standard included the three audio &quot;layers&quot; (encoding techniques) now known as Layer I (MP1), Layer II (MP2) and Layer III (MP3).
All algorithms for MPEG-1 Audio Layer I, II and III were approved in 1991 as the committee draft of ISO-11172 and finalized in 1992 as part of MPEG-1, the first standard suite by MPEG, which resulted in the international standard ISO/IEC 11172-3 (a.k.a. &quot;MPEG-1 Audio&quot; or &quot;MPEG-1 Part 3&quot;), published in 1993. Further work on MPEG audio was finalized in 1994 as part of the second suite of MPEG standards, MPEG-2, more formally known as international standard ISO/IEC 13818-3 (a.k.a. &quot;MPEG-2 Part 3&quot; or backward compatible &quot;MPEG-2 Audio&quot; or &quot;MPEG-2 Audio BC&quot;), originally published in 1995. MPEG-2 Part 3 (ISO/IEC 13818-3) defined additional bit rates and sample rates for MPEG-1 Audio Layer I, II and III. The new sampling rates are exactly half that of those originally defined for MPEG-1 Audio. MPEG-2 Part 3 also enhanced MPEG-1&#x27;s audio by allowing the coding of audio programs with more than two channels, up to 5.1 multichannel.

The Layer III (MP3) component uses a lossy compression algorithm that was designed to greatly reduce the amount of data required to represent an audio recording and sound like a decent reproduction of the original uncompressed audio for most listeners.

===Emmy Award in Engineering===
CCETT (France), IRT (Germany) and Philips (The Netherlands) won an Emmy Award in Engineering 2000 for development of a digital audio two-channel compression system known as Musicam or MPEG Audio Layer II.

==Technical specifications==

MPEG-1 Audio Layer II is defined in ISO/IEC 11172-3 (MPEG-1 Part 3)

*Sampling rates: 32, 44.1 and 48 kHz
*Bit rates: 32, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 160, 192, 224, 256, 320 and 384 kbit/s

An extension has been provided in MPEG-2 Audio Layer II and is defined in ISO/IEC 13818-3 (MPEG-2 Part 3)

*Additional sampling rates: 16, 22.05 and 24 kHz
*Additional bit rates: 8, 16, 24, 40 and 144 kbit/s
*Multichannel support - up to 5 full range audio channels and an LFE-channel (Low Frequency Enhancement channel)

The format is based on successive digital frames of 1152 sampling intervals with four possible formats:
* mono format
* stereo format
* intensity encoded joint stereo format (stereo irrelevance)
* dual channel (uncorrelated) format

=== Variable bit rate ===

MPEG audio may have variable bit rate (VBR), but it is not widely supported. Layer II can use a method called bit rate switching. Each frame may be created with a different bit rate.
According to ISO/IEC 11172-3:1993, Section 2.4.2.3: To provide the smallest possible delay and complexity, the (MPEG audio) decoder is not required to support a continuously variable bit rate when in layer I or II.

==How the MP2 format works==
* MP2 is a sub-band audio encoder, which means that compression takes place in the time domain with a low-delay filter bank producing 32 frequency domain components. By comparison, MP3 is a transform audio encoder with hybrid filter bank, which means that compression takes place in the frequency domain after a hybrid (double) transformation from the time domain.
* MPEG Audio Layer II is the core algorithm of the MP3 standards. All psychoacoustical characteristics and frame format structures of the MP3 format are derived from the basic MP2 algorithm and format.
* The MP2 encoder may exploit inter channel redundancies using optional &quot;joint stereo&quot; intensity encoding.
* Like MP3, MP2 is a perceptual coding format, which means that it removes information that the human auditory system will not be able to easily perceive. To choose which information to remove, the audio signal is analyzed according to a psychoacoustic model, which takes into account the parameters of the human auditory system. Research into psychoacoustics has shown that if there is a strong signal on a certain frequency, then weaker signals at frequencies close to the strong signal&#x27;s frequency cannot be perceived by the human auditory system. This is called frequency masking. Perceptual audio codecs take advantage of this frequency masking by ignoring information at frequencies that are deemed to be imperceptible, thus allowing more data to be allocated to the reproduction of perceptible frequencies.
* MP2 splits the input audio signal into 32 sub-bands, and if the audio in a sub-band is deemed to be imperceptible then that sub-band is not transmitted. MP3, on the other hand, transforms the input audio signal to the frequency domain in 576 frequency components. Therefore, MP3 has a higher frequency resolution than MP2, which allows the psychoacoustic model to be applied more selectively than for MP2. So MP3 has greater scope to reduce the bit rate.
* The use of an additional entropy coding tool, and higher frequency accuracy (due to the larger number of frequency sub-bands used by MP3) explains why MP3 does not need as high a bit rate as MP2 to get an acceptable audio quality. Conversely, MP2 shows a better behavior than MP3 in the time domain, due to its lower frequency resolution. This implies less codec time delay — which can make editing audio simpler — as well as &quot;ruggedness&quot; and resistance to errors which may occur during the digital recording process, or during transmission errors.
* The MP2 sub-band filter bank also provides an inherent &quot;transient concealment&quot; feature, due to the specific temporal masking effect of its mother filter. This unique characteristic of the MPEG-1 Audio family implies a very good sound quality on audio signals with rapid energy changes, such as percussive sounds. Because both the MP2 and MP3 formats use the same basic sub-band filter bank, both benefit from this characteristic.

==Applications of MP2==
Part of the DAB digital radio and DVB digital television standards.

MPEG-1 Audio Layer II is commonly used within the broadcast industry for distributing live audio over satellite, ISDN and IP Network connections as well as for storage of audio in digital playout systems. An example is NPR&#x27;s PRSS Content Depot programming distribution system. The Content Depot distributes MPEG-1 L2 audio in a Broadcast Wave File wrapper. MPEG2 with RIFF headers (used in codice_1) is specified in the RIFF/WAV standards. As a result, Windows Media Player will directly play Content Depot files, however, less intelligent codice_1 players often do not. As the encoding and decoding process would have been a significant drain on CPU resources in the first generations of broadcast playout systems, professional broadcast playout systems typically implement the codec in hardware, such as by delegating the task of encoding and decoding to a compatible soundcard rather than the system CPU.

MPEG-1 Audio Layer II is the audio format used in Digital Audio Broadcast (DAB), a digital radio standard for broadcasting digital audio radio services in many countries around the world.&lt;br&gt;
The BBC Research &amp; Development department states that at least 192 kbit/s is necessary for a high fidelity stereo broadcast:
All DVD-Video players in PAL countries contain stereo MP2 decoders, making MP2 a possible competitor to Dolby Digital in these markets. DVD-Video players in NTSC countries are not required to decode MP2 audio, although most do. While some DVD recorders store audio in MP2 and many consumer-authored DVDs use the format, commercial DVDs with MP2 soundtracks are rare.

MPEG-1 Audio Layer II is the standard audio format used in the Video CD and Super Video CD formats (VCD and SVCD also support variable bit rate and MPEG Multichannel as added by MPEG-2).

MPEG-1 Audio Layer II is the standard audio format used in the MHP standard for set-top boxes.

MPEG-1 Audio Layer II is the audio format used in HDV camcorders.

MP2 files are compatible with some Portable audio players.

==Naming and extensions==
The term MP2 and filename extension codice_3 usually refer MPEG-1 Audio Layer II data, but can also refer to MPEG-2 Audio Layer II, a mostly backward compatible extension which adds support for multichannel audio, variable bit rate encoding, and additional sampling rates, defined in ISO/IEC 13818-3. The abbreviation MP2 is also sometimes erroneously applied to MPEG-2 video or MPEG-2 AAC audio.

<doc id="159964" wikidata="Q185223" url="?curid=159964" title="Cassius Dio">
<text>Lucius Cassius Dio (), also known as Dio Cassius ( ), was a Roman historian and senator of maternal Greek origin. He published 80 volumes of the history of ancient Rome, beginning with the arrival of Aeneas in Italy. The volumes documented the subsequent founding of Rome (753 BC), the formation of the Republic (509 BC), and the creation of the Empire (27 BC) up until 229 AD, during the reign of Severus Alexander. Written in Ancient Greek over 22 years, Dio&#x27;s work covers approximately 1,000 years of history.

Many of his books have survived intact, alongside summaries edited by later authors such as Xiphilinus, a Byzantine monk of the 11th century, and Zonaras, a Byzantine chronicler of the 12th century.

==Biography==
Lucius Cassius Dio was the son of Cassius Apronianus, a Roman senator and member of the Cassia gens, who was born and raised at Nicaea in Bithynia. Byzantine tradition maintains that Dio&#x27;s mother was the daughter or sister of the Greek orator and philosopher, Dio Chrysostom; however, this relationship has been disputed. Although Dio was a Roman citizen, he wrote in Greek. Dio always maintained a love for his hometown of Nicaea, calling it &quot;my home&quot;, as opposed to his description of his villa in Capua, Italy (&quot;the place where I spend my time whenever I am in Italy&quot;).

For the greater part of his life, Dio was a member of the public service. He was a senator under Commodus and governor of Smyrna following the death of Septimius Severus; he became a suffect consul in approximately the year 205. Dio was also proconsul in Africa and Pannonia. Severus Alexander held Dio in the highest esteem and reappointed him to the position of consul in 229. Following his second consulship, while in his later years, Dio returned to his native Bithynia, where he eventually died.

Dio was either the grandfather or great-grandfather of Cassius Dio, consul in 291.

==&quot;Roman History&quot; ==
Dio published a &quot;Roman History&quot; (, &quot;Rhōmaïkḕ Historía&quot;) in 80 books in Greek, later translated into Latin as the . On the matter of its composition, he writes the following: &quot;I spent ten years in collecting all the achievements of the Romans from the beginning down to the death of Severus [211 AD], and twelve years more in composing my work. As for subsequent events, they also shall be recorded, down to whatever point it shall be permitted me&quot;.

The books cover a period of approximately 1,400 years, beginning with the tales from Roman mythology of the arrival of the legendary Aeneas in Italy () and the founding of Rome by his descendant Romulus (753 BC); as well as the historic events of the republican and imperial eras through 229 AD. The work is one of only three written Roman sources that document the British revolt of 60–61 AD led by Boudica. Until the first century BC, Dio provides only a summary of events; after that period, his accounts become more detailed.

Dio&#x27;s work has often been deprecated as unreliable and lacking any overall political aim. Recently, however, some scholars have re-evaluated his work and have highlighted his complexity and sophisticated political and historical interpretations.

===Survey of surviving books and fragments===
The first 21 books have been partially reconstructed based on fragments from other works, as well as the 12th-century epitome of Joannes Zonaras who used Dio&#x27;s &quot;Roman History&quot; as a main source. Scholarship on this part of Dio&#x27;s work is scarce but the importance of the Early Republic and Regal period to Dio&#x27;s overall work has recently been underlined. Books 22 through 35, which are only sparsely covered by fragments, were already lost by the times of Zonaras.

The books that follow, Books 36 through 54, are all nearly complete; they cover the period from 65 BC to 12 BC, or from the eastern campaign of Pompey and the death of Mithridates to the death of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. Book 55 contains a considerable gap, while Books 56 through 60 (which cover the period from 9–54 AD) are complete and contain events from the defeat of Varus in Germany to the death of Claudius.

Of the 20 subsequent books in the series, there remain only fragments and the meager abridgement of John Xiphilinus, a Byzantine monk from the 11th century sponsored by emperor Michael VII Doukas. The abridgment of Xiphilinus, as now extant, commences with Book 35 and continues to the end of Book 80. The last book covers the period from 222 to 229 AD (the first half of the reign of Alexander Severus).

===Collections of book fragments===
The fragments of the first 36 books have been collected in four ways:

;&quot;Fragmenta Valesiana&quot;: Fragments that were dispersed throughout various writers, scholiasts, grammarians, and lexicographers, and were collected by Henri Valois

;&quot;Fragmenta Peiresciana&quot;: Large extracts, found in the section entitled &quot;Of Virtues and Vices&quot;, contained in the collection, or portative library, compiled by order of Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus. The manuscript of this belonged to Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc.

;&quot;Fragmenta Ursiniana&quot;: The fragments of the first 34 books, preserved in the second section of the same work by Constantine, entitled &quot;Of Embassies&quot;. These are known under the name of &quot;Fragmenta Ursiniana&quot;, as the manuscript in which they are contained was found in Sicily by Fulvio Orsini.

;&quot;Excerpta Vaticana&quot;: &quot;Excerpta Vaticana&quot; by Angelo Mai contains fragments of Books 1 to 35 and 61 to 80. Additionally, fragments of an unknown continuator of Dio (&quot;Anonymus post Dionem&quot;), generally identified with the 6th century CE historian Peter the Patrician, are included; these date from the time of Constantine. Other fragments from Dio that are primarily associated with the first 34 books were found by Mai in two Vatican manuscripts; these contain a collection that was compiled by Maximus Planudes. The annals of Joannes Zonaras also contain numerous extracts from Dio.

<text>Christopher Brian Bridges (born September 11, 1977), known professionally as Ludacris (, spoken as &quot;ludicrous&quot; in American English), is an American rapper and actor. Born in Champaign, Illinois, Ludacris moved to Atlanta, Georgia, at age nine, where he first began rapping. Starting out with a brief stint as a DJ, he formed his own record label, Disturbing tha Peace in the late 1990s to independently release his debut studio album &quot;Incognegro&quot; (1999). After its single, &quot;What&#x27;s Your Fantasy&quot; (featuring Shawnna), became a top 40 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, the album was re-released by Def Jam Recordings as his major label debut, &quot;Back for the First Time&quot; (2000). The latter album peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and spawned his second top 40 single, &quot;Southern Hospitality&quot; (featuring Pharrell).

Ludacris&#x27; following albums, &quot;Word of Mouf&quot; (2001), &quot;Chicken-n-Beer&quot; (2003) and &quot;The Red Light District&quot; (2004), were each met with continued success and received multi-platinum certifications by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). His fifth and sixth albums, &quot;Release Therapy&quot; (2006) and &quot;Theater of the Mind&quot; (2008), explored more serious subject matter than its predecessors. His seventh album, &quot;Battle of the Sexes&quot; (2010) featured a return to the more lighthearted tone of his earlier albums. Throughout his career, Ludacris has scored two number-one singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 as a lead artist: &quot;Stand Up&quot; (featuring Shawnna) and &quot;Money Maker&quot; (featuring Pharrell), as well as three singles which did so as a guest performer: Usher&#x27;s &quot;Yeah!&quot; in 2004, Fergie&#x27;s &quot;Glamorous&quot; in 2007, and Taio Cruz&#x27;s &quot;Break Your Heart&quot; in 2009. The following year, he guest featured on Justin Bieber&#x27;s single &quot;Baby&quot;, which remains one of the highest-certified singles of all time in the United States.

Ludacris is cited as one of the first Dirty South rappers to achieve mainstream success in the early 2000s. He is the recipient of three Grammy Awards, a Screen Actors Guild Award, a Critics&#x27; Choice Award and an MTV Video Music Award. Outside of music, he has portrayed the character Tej Parker in the &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; film series—first appearing in its second film, &quot;2 Fast 2 Furious&quot; (2003). His other notable acting roles include &quot;Crash&quot; (2004), &quot;Gamer&quot; (2009), and &quot;New Year&#x27;s Eve&quot; (2011). In 2021, he created and starred in the children&#x27;s animated series &quot;Karma&#x27;s World&quot; for Netflix. Ludacris is also a private pilot.

==Early life==
Bridges was born in Champaign, Illinois, and moved to Oak Park as a teenager. After attending Oak Park River Forest High School in ninth grade, Bridges moved to Centreville, Virginia, and attended Centreville High School for one year. He attended Banneker High School in Atlanta, Georgia, and graduated in 1995. From 1998 to 1999, he studied music management at Georgia State University. Bridges&#x27; parents are both African American. His great-great-grandfather was a Choctaw. In an interview with A. J. Jacobs, Bridges learned that his great-grandmother had said one of his great-great-grandfathers, who is a white Englishman, was probably Jewish. Bridges is also a distant cousin of the comedian Richard Pryor. He wrote his first rap song at age nine when moving to Atlanta and joined an amateur rap group three years later.

==Music career==

===1998–2000: &quot;Incognegro&quot; and &quot;Back for the First Time&quot;===
Ludacris served as an intern and then a DJ at Atlanta&#x27;s Hot 97.5 (now Hot 107.9) under the name &quot;Chris Lova Lova&quot;. During his radio career, Ludacris met music producer Timbaland, whose album &quot;Tim&#x27;s Bio: Life from da Bassment&quot; would feature Ludacris on the track &quot;Phat Rabbit&quot; (credited as Ludichris).

Speaking with MTV&#x27;s hip hop show &quot;Direct Effect&quot; in 2000, Ludacris explained his stage name was a play on the word &quot;ludicrous&quot;.

In 1999, Ludacris released his debut album &quot;Incognegro&quot; through his independent label Disturbing tha Peace. Def Jam South would later repackage &quot;Incognegro&quot; with some new songs added into Ludacris&#x27;s major label debut &quot;Back for the First Time&quot; in 2000. The album reached number four on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and included the singles &quot;What&#x27;s Your Fantasy&quot; (featuring Shawnna) and &quot;Southern Hospitality&quot; (featuring Pharrell Williams), which respectively reached the nos. 21 and 23 spots on the Billboard Hot 100.

===2001–2003: &quot;Word of Mouf&quot; and &quot;Chicken-n-Beer&quot;===
In 2001, Ludacris contributed the hit single &quot;Area Codes&quot; (featuring Nate Dogg) to the soundtrack to the film &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot;. It was also included on his next album, &quot;Word of Mouf&quot;, released later that year. The &quot;Word of Mouf&quot; lead single &quot;Rollout (My Business)&quot; was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Male Rap Solo Performance in the 2003 Grammy Awards. Two other singles reached the Hot 100 in 2002: &quot;Saturday (Oooh! Ooooh!)&quot; featuring Sleepy Brown peaked at no. 22, and &quot;Move Bitch&quot; featuring Mystikal and I-20 peaked at no. 10.

Ludacris also had guest spots on hit singles throughout 2001 and 2002, such as Jermaine Dupri&#x27;s &quot;Welcome to Atlanta&quot; that peaked at no. 35 on the Hot 100 and no. 15 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop chart. Ludacris was among multiple featured rappers on &quot;Bia&#x27; Bia&#x27;&quot; by Lil Jon and the East Side Boyz, which peaked at no. 47 on the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop chart in August 2001. In the last week of 2002, &quot;Gossip Folks&quot; by Missy Elliott featuring Ludacris was released as a single. It peaked at no. 8 on the Hot 100 in March 2003.

In April 2003, Ludacris released single &quot;Act a Fool&quot; from the soundtrack of the movie &quot;2 Fast 2 Furious&quot;, where Ludacris played Tej Parker. Director John Singleton brought Ludacris into the franchise after failing to secure Ja Rule&#x27;s return for the sequel to &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot;. In the fall of 2003, Ludacris released his next album &quot;Chicken-n-Beer&quot;. Guest appearances included Playaz Circle, Chingy, Snoop Dogg, 8Ball &amp; MJG, Lil&#x27; Flip, I-20, Lil Fate, and Shawnna. The single, &quot;Stand Up&quot; appeared on both &quot;Chicken-n-Beer&quot; as well as the soundtrack for the teen hip hop/dance movie &quot;You Got Served&quot;. Produced by Kanye West, &quot;Stand Up&quot; went on to become one of Ludacris&#x27; biggest mainstream hits to date, hitting the top spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 garnering heavy airplay on mainstream pop, rhythmic, and urban radio stations, as well as on MTV, MTV2, and BET. Ludacris was sued by a New Jersey group called I.O.F. who claimed that &quot;Stand Up&quot; used a hook from one of their songs, but in June 2006, a jury found that the song did not violate copyrights. &quot;I hope the plaintiffs enjoyed their 15 minutes of fame,&quot; Ludacris said after the verdict.

The album&#x27;s next single, &quot;Splash Waterfalls&quot;, was released in early 2004. A huge pop hit (despite its steamy video and explicit, adult-oriented lyrical content and themes), it subsequently became a success at urban radio and BET, and is the only time he has produced two consecutive top 10 singles from a solo album, except for &quot;Release Therapy&quot; (an unedited version of the video could only be viewed on BET&#x27;s Uncut program). It was Ludacris&#x27; most sexual video yet, an R&amp;B remix that featured Raphael Saadiq and sampled Tony! Toni! Tone!&#x27;s &quot;Whatever You Want&quot;. Ludacris received his first Grammy Award with Usher and Lil Jon for their hit single &quot;Yeah!&quot;. Ludacris next released &quot;Blow It Out&quot;, which was accompanied by a low-budget music video.

===2004–2007: &quot;The Red Light District&quot; and &quot;Release Therapy&quot;===

Ludacris took a more mature approach to his fourth album &quot;The Red Light District&quot;. Sohail Khalid helped produce this album with various artists such as T.I., Lil Flip and Bun B. Ludacris openly boasted that he may be the only rapper able to keep the Def Jam label afloat on the opening track. Ludacris filmed and recorded the single &quot;Get Back&quot; in which he was featured as a muscle-bound hulk who was being annoyed by the media and warned critics to leave him alone. He first appeared on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; as a special guest performing with musical guest Sum 41 on a season 30 episode hosted by Paul Giamatti. He then recorded &quot;Get Back&quot; with Sum 41 to make a rock crossover single. The follow-up single was the &quot;Austin Powers&quot;-inspired &quot;Number One Spot&quot;. It was produced by New York City&#x27;s Hot 97 personality DJ Green Lantern. It used the Quincy Jones sample of &quot;Soul Bossa Nova&quot; and sped it up to the tempo of Ludacris&#x27; rap flow. Featured artists on the album include Nas, DJ Quik, DMX, Trick Daddy, Sleepy Brown and Disturbing tha Peace newcomers Bobby Valentino, Dolla Boi and Small World. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard charts.

In an issue of &quot;XXL&quot;, Ludacris was placed in the number nine spot for the most anticipated albums of 2006, for &quot;Release Therapy&quot;. The album &quot;Release Therapy&quot; was released on September 26, 2006. Ludacris formatted the CD to have two sides: a &quot;Release&quot; side and a &quot;Therapy&quot; side on a single CD. Guest appearances include Pharrell Williams, R. Kelly, Young Jeezy, Mary J. Blige, Field Mob, Bobby Valentino, Pimp C, C-Murder and Beanie Sigel. The first single, &quot;Money Maker&quot;, which features Williams, was released to U.S. radio outlets on July 17, 2006. &quot;Money Maker&quot; reached number one on the BET program &quot;106 &amp; Park&quot;. It then went to become the rapper&#x27;s second number-one single after 6 years. His second single, &quot;Grew Up a Screw Up&quot;, featuring Young Jeezy, dispels rumors that the two are or ever were in a dispute. His third single, &quot;Runaway Love&quot;, soon peaked at number one on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Rap Tracks and won Best Collaboration in the 2007 BET Awards. &quot;Release Therapy&quot; won the Best Rap Album award at the 2007 Grammy Awards. His album then reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album charts with sales of 309,000 in its first week. With the release of this album, Ludacris marked a change in style in his career with his musical style. The new album itself features a departure of the lighthearted mood of his previous albums, and introduces a darker side. A change of hair accompanied this as he cut off his trademark braids for a more conventional &quot;fade&quot; cut. To promote the album, Ludacris returned to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (as both host and musical guest) on November 18, 2006.

===2008–2010: &quot;Theater of the Mind&quot; and &quot;Battle of the Sexes&quot;===
&quot;The Preview&quot;, a mixtape to preview the album was released on July 28, 2008. &quot;Theater of the Mind&quot; was released on November 24, 2008, and in April 2008, the single &quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Together&quot; appeared on xxlmag.com; supposedly from the new album (&quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Together&quot; was expected to but was released as a bonus track on the CD). A song with Small World called &quot;Pinky Shinin&quot; was expected to be on the album, but it was dropped. In an interview with &quot;Complex Magazine&quot; he stated that Chris Brown, Lil Wayne, Rick Ross, T.I., Plies, Common, T-Pain, Jay-Z, Nas and The Game will be on the album; Game is featured in a track with Willy Northpole titled &quot;Call Up the Homies&quot;. T.I. was on the album on a track called &quot;Wish You Would&quot; squashing the long feud between them. The album debuted at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 213,493 sold first week. The album was released the same day as Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;808s &amp; Heartbreak&quot;, which took the number-one spot. His first single &quot;What Them Girls Like&quot;, featuring Chris Brown and Sean Garrett, peaked at number 33 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. His second single, &quot;One More Drink&quot;, featuring T-Pain, peaked at number 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The third official single is &quot;Nasty Girl&quot;, featuring Plies. He confirmed a &quot;sequel&quot; titled &quot;Ludaversal&quot; due to be released September 11, 2012.

Ludacris was featured on Justin Bieber&#x27;s hit single &quot;Baby&quot;, which became one of the highest-certified singles of all time in the US and gained international success. His eighth studio album was released on March 9, 2010, with his first promotional single for the album being &quot;Everybody Drunk&quot; which features Callum Smith, originally featuring Shawnna. The first concept idea of the album was to have Ludacris and Shawnna battle it out on the album back–to–back, but this was later axed upon Shawnna&#x27;s departure from Disturbing tha Peace, ending her contract on Ludacris&#x27; label and joining T-Pain&#x27;s Nappy Boy Entertainment label. The first official single released from &quot;Battle of the Sexes&quot; was &quot;How Low&quot;, which was released on December 8, 2009. The follow–up single was &quot;My Chick Bad&quot;, released on February 23, 2010. The third single is &quot;Sex Room&quot;, peaking at number 69 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Ludacris&#x27;s &quot;Battle of the Sexes&quot; entered the chart at number one, with 137,000 sales in the first week. The album is currently certified gold.

===2012–2015: &quot;Ludaversal&quot;===
In 2012, Ludacris released the singles &quot;Representin&quot; and &quot;Rest of My Life&quot;, both of which were scrapped after the songs underperformed and the recording process for his upcoming album &quot;Ludaversal&quot; stalled.

On May 24, 2013, Ludacris released a mixtape entitled &quot;#IDGAF&quot;. He had been releasing a new song on Fridays as he was calling these releases &quot;IDGAF Fridays&quot;. These songs, in order of release, were &quot;Raised in the South&quot; featuring rapper Jeezy, released on April 19. That release was followed by &quot;If I Ain&#x27;t Fucked Up&quot; on April 26, &quot;9 Times Out of 10&quot; featuring rappers French Montana &amp; Que on May 3, &quot;Speak into The Mic&quot; on May 10, and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Give A Fuck&quot; on May 17. The last song was released a week before the release of the mixtape. The mixtape had almost 60,000 downloads via datpiff.com within the first day. Ludacris reprised his role as Tej in the blockbuster movie &quot;Fast &amp; Furious 6&quot;, which opened during Memorial Day Weekend, May 2013. Ludacris had this to say about his upcoming new album: &quot;I think every album is like a progression, I&#x27;m working with different producers. Usher, We definitely have this album which is a great thing. Ne-Yo is also on the album and I have producers like David Guetta, we have Stargate, have trainees. [The] Kelly Rowland single just came out that you need to check out. It&#x27;s called &#x27;Representing.

On August 3, 2013, Ludacris confirmed to VIBE.com he will be working with Anita Baker. &quot;I don&#x27;t know if the cat&#x27;s out the bag. Yeah, Anita Baker is definitely on the album&quot;, admitted Luda. &quot;She&#x27;s on that particular song. [It] is really about my father and growing up and me being a kid and trying to get him to stop and me dealing with that.&quot;

After a lengthy hiatus, Ludacris returned to the music on January 30, 2014, with the release of a single &quot;Party Girls&quot; featuring Jeremih, Wiz Khalifa and Cashmere Cat. The song takes a cue from Aqua&#x27;s 1997 song &quot;Barbie Girl&quot;; however, the single did not appear on the new album. On October 9, 2014, Ludacris announced that &quot;Ludaversal&quot; would be released on March 31, 2015; which will be preceded by an EP titled &quot;Burning Bridges&quot; due for release on December 16, 2014. On October 31, 2014, Ludacris premiered the first single from the &quot;Burning Bridges&quot; EP titled &quot;Good Lovin&#x27;&quot; featuring American singer Miguel.

Due to its moderate success, &quot;Good Lovin&quot; would go on to serve as the first single from &quot;Ludaversal&quot;. On March 3, 2015, Ludacris held a listening party for Ludaversal with Def Jam. The tracks &quot;Intro&quot;, &quot;Not For Long&quot; featuring Usher, and &quot;Come N See Me&quot; featuring Big K.R.I.T. were revealed to the public After 3 years worth of delays, Ludaversal was released March 31, 2015 to generally positive reviews and peaked at number 3 on the Billboard 200.

On May 8, 2018, Ludacris received three nominations and one win at the 2018 CMT Music Awards.

On October 14, 2020, Netflix commissioned his then-new animated musical children&#x27;s television series known as &quot;Karma&#x27;s World&quot; for an initial 40 episodes from 9 Story Productions, Creative Affairs Group and his production company, &quot;Karma&#x27;s World Entertainment&quot;, Using the inspiration of his eldest daughter, Karma Bridges, and the eponymous website created in 2009. Ludacris stated in interviews with &quot;People&quot; and &quot;Billboard&quot; that he and Karma &quot;spent close to a decade and a half&quot; working on the &quot;perfection&quot; of the production. The series premiered on Netflix on October 15, 2021, alongside its official soundtrack album, which was produced and released by Def Jam Recordings on global digital music streaming platforms.

He received this honorary degree on May 4, 2022, at the commencement ceremony at Center Parc Stadium where he also delivered a speech.

==Controversy==

===T.I.===
Tensions began when T.I. saw Disturbing tha Peace rapper I-20&#x27;s video in which a man wearing a shirt with the words &quot;Trap House&quot;, was being beaten. T.I. believed the man&#x27;s shirt actually said &quot;Trap Muzik&quot;, perhaps interpreting this to be a reference to his album of the same name. Later, G-Unit artist Young Buck asked these two fellow Southern rappers to appear on his new record on the track &quot;Stomp&quot;. T.I. recorded a verse that contained a line that Young Buck considered to be an insult towards Ludacris, &quot;Me gettin&#x27; beat down?/That&#x27;s ludicrous&quot;. Young Buck spoke to Ludacris about his interpretation of the event. Ludacris then later recorded a verse that can be found on the album &quot;Straight Outta Cashville&quot;. T.I&#x27;s record company wanted Ludacris to change his verse before they sanctioned it but Ludacris refused and T.I. was therefore replaced by Game on the album version.

On June 24, 2007, at the Sunset Tower Hotel in West Hollywood, California, T.I. was involved in a physical altercation. During a luncheon held by Kevin Liles of Warner Music Group (parent company of T.I.&#x27;s label, Atlantic Records), the MC got into a fight with Ludacris&#x27; manager Chaka Zulu. According to witnesses, T.I. punched Zulu in the face and choked him and a small, brief melee ensued.

T.I. was awarded honors for Best Hip-Hop Artist at the BET Awards, and took the opportunity to apologize for his scuffle with Zulu. While accepting his award, he expressed regret over the situation. &quot;They say it&#x27;s a fine line between brilliance and insanity&quot;, he said, in an apparent reference to his troublesome alter ego, T.I.P. During the broadcast, cameras showed his onetime rival Ludacris smiling in the audience.

The two rappers have resolved their disagreement and have collaborated on four songs: &quot;Wish You Would&quot; off Ludacris&#x27;s sixth studio album &quot;Theater of the Mind&quot;, &quot;On Top of the World&quot; off T.I.&#x27;s sixth studio album &quot;Paper Trail&quot;, and &quot;We in This Bitch&quot; off DJ Drama&#x27;s album &quot;Quality Street Music&quot;. The original version of the latter had Kanye West. The two have also collaborated on Big Boi&#x27;s song called &quot;In The A&quot;, released on the 2012 album &quot;Vicious Lies and Dangerous Rumors&quot;.

===Bill O&#x27;Reilly and Pepsi===
On August 27, 2002, political pundit Bill O&#x27;Reilly called for all Americans to boycott Pepsi products because they hired Ludacris for promotional purposes and O&#x27;Reilly objected to Ludacris&#x27;s style and attitude. The next day, O&#x27;Reilly reported that Pepsi had fired Ludacris. Six months later, Russell Simmons and his hip hop action summit threatened a boycott of all PepsiCo products on the grounds that Pepsi had subsequently hired Ozzy Osbourne for a commercial even though Osbourne is notable for use of profanity and explicit lyrics. Eventually an agreement was reached that resulted in PepsiCo donating $3 million to Ludacris&#x27;s foundation and other inner city charities.

This is referred to in the 2003 songs &quot;Hoes in My Room&quot; as well as &quot;Blow It Out&quot; from &quot;Chicken n&#x27; Beer&quot;. Three years later, this would be referred to again in the song &quot;Number One Spot&quot;. During a summer 2003 appearance on MTV&#x27;s &quot;The New Tom Green Show&quot;, Ludacris and host Tom Green launched copies of Bill O&#x27;Reilly-authored books into a dumpster using a homemade catapult. In an interview with RadarOnline.com in 2010, Ludacris stated that he and O&#x27;Reilly had made amends after having a conversation at a charity event.

===2008 presidential election===
The song &quot;Politics as Usual&quot; from Ludacris&#x27;s mixtape &quot;The Preview&quot; has caused controversy due to lyrics in the song criticizing Jesse Jackson; &quot;Now Jesse talkin&#x27; slick and apologizin&#x27; for what? If you said it then you meant it&quot; (in reference to Jackson stating that he would &quot;like to cut Obama&#x27;s nuts off&quot;); John McCain &quot;McCain don&#x27;t belong in any chair unless he&#x27;s paralyzed&quot;; President George W. Bush &quot;Yeah I said it, &#x27;cuz Bush is mentally handicapped/Ball up all of his speeches and throw &#x27;em just like candy wraps/&#x27;Cuz what you talkin&#x27; I hear nothin&#x27; even relevant/you the worst of all 43 presidents&quot;; Hillary Clinton &quot;Hillary hated on you, so that bitch is irrelevant&quot;, in reference to Hillary&#x27;s campaign comments against Obama.

<text>The Minnesota Orchestra is an American orchestra based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Founded originally as the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra in 1903, the Minnesota Orchestra plays most of its concerts at Minneapolis&#x27;s Orchestra Hall.

==History==
The eighth major orchestra established in the United States, the Minnesota Orchestra was founded by Emil Oberhoffer as the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra in 1903. It gave its first performance on November 5, 1903, in Minneapolis&#x27;s Exposition Building. In 1911, it began a series of children&#x27;s concerts under the sponsorship of the Young People&#x27;s Symphony Concert Association (YPSCA), which continues to this day. Early in the 1920s, the orchestra was one of the first to be heard on recordings and on the radio, playing a nationally broadcast concert with guest conductor Bruno Walter in 1923. In 1968, the orchestra changed its name to the Minnesota Orchestra. It makes its home in downtown Minneapolis&#x27;s Orchestra Hall, which was built for the ensemble in 1974. The orchestra&#x27;s previous hall, starting in 1929, was Northrop Memorial Auditorium on the University of Minnesota&#x27;s Minneapolis campus.

===Financial concerns===
In 2007 the Minnesota Orchestra&#x27;s assets began declining, a trend exacerbated by the financial crisis of 2007–2008. In August 2008, the Minnesota Orchestra Association&#x27;s invested assets totaled $168.5 million, 13% less than the $192.4 million the Association had projected in its 2007 Strategic Plan. In fiscal year 2009, the Minnesota Orchestra&#x27;s board &quot;sold $28.7 million in securities at a nearly $14 million loss&quot;.

During 2009 and 2010, the orchestra&#x27;s board reported a balanced budget and drew on its endowment to cover operational deficits. At the time, it was trying to secure $16 million in state bonding for renovations of Orchestra Hall and Peavey Plaza. The orchestra posted operational deficits of $2.9 million in 2011 and $6 million in 2012.

===2012–2014 lockout===
On October 1, 2012, the Minnesota Orchestral Association (the orchestra&#x27;s governing body) locked out the orchestra&#x27;s musicians and canceled concerts through November 18 after failing to reach a new collective bargaining agreement. The MOA stated that spending on musician salaries and benefits was depleting the organization&#x27;s endowment, and that labor costs needed to be reduced by $5 million per year. The musicians and their union took the position that the proposed cuts were so deep and draconian as to represent an existential threat to the future of the orchestra.

The entire 2012–13 concert season was canceled. During the lockout, the musicians periodically presented concerts on their own, In December 2012, Vänskä sent a letter to the board of directors and the musicians, warning that the lockout was causing severe damage to the orchestra&#x27;s reputation at home and abroad. On April 30, 2013, Vänskä stated he would resign if the lockout continued:

: &quot;I must make it clear that in the case Carnegie Hall chooses to cancel the Minnesota Orchestra’s concerts this November, i.e. if they lose confidence in our ability to perform … then I will be forced to resign&quot;.

After the orchestra management cancelled the concerts in question, Vänskä resigned as music director on 1 October 2013 with immediate effect. On October 4 and 5, Vänskä conducted three final concerts with the locked-out orchestra at the University of Minnesota&#x27;s Ted Mann Concert Hall, with Emanuel Ax as the guest pianist. As an encore, Vänskä conducted Sibelius&#x27;s &quot;Valse Triste&quot;, where he requested that the audience withhold its applause afterward.

===Post-lockout===
On January 14, 2014, the Musicians of the Minnesota Orchestra announced that they had reached a collective bargaining agreement with the Minnesota Orchestra Association to end the lockout on February 1, 2014. Concerts resumed at Orchestra Hall in February. On April 24, 2014, the orchestra announced Vänskä&#x27;s return as music director effective with the 2014–15 and 2015–16 seasons. In July 2017, the orchestra announced the extension of Vänskä&#x27;s contract as music director through the 2021–22 season. In December 2018, the orchestra announced that Vänskä would conclude his tenure as music director at the close of the 2021-2022 season. He is to take the title of conductor laureate.

In May 2015, the Minnesota Orchestra performed in Havana, Cuba, as a result of the Cuban Thaw, becoming the first professional U.S. orchestra to play in Cuba since the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra in 1999. In August 2018, it became the first professional U.S. orchestra to perform in South Africa. In January 2022, the orchestra, Vänskä, and Elina Vähälä gave the North American premiere of the original 1904 version of Jean Sibelius&#x27;s Violin Concerto. 

In December 2021, Thomas Søndergård first guest-conducted the orchestra. He returned for another guest-conducting engagement in April 2022. In July 2022, the orchestra announced Søndergård&#x27;s appointment as its next music director, effective with the 2023-2024 season, with an initial contract of five seasons.

==Recordings==
The orchestra first began recording (by the acoustical process) under Henri Verbrugghen in 1924 for Brunswick, and in the following years produced some landmark records. Among these was the first electrical recording of Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Resurrection&quot; Symphony with Eugene Ormandy, who recorded extensively with the orchestra for RCA Victor in the 1930s. In the 1940s, the Minneapolis Symphony was contracted to Columbia Records and made a series of records with Ormandy&#x27;s successor, Dimitri Mitropoulos. These included the premiere recording of Mahler&#x27;s First Symphony. Beginning in 1954 and continuing on through 1955, the group made the first complete recordings of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s three ballets: &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, and &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; under the baton of Antal Doráti. In 1954, they also made the first recording of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;1812 Overture&quot; to include actual cannon fire, again under Doráti&#x27;s direction. These recordings were made for Mercury Records as part of the &quot;Living Presence&quot; series.

In the 1970s, the renamed Minnesota Orchestra made a series of recordings for Vox Records under the direction of Stanisław Skrowaczewski. In the 1990s and 2000s, the orchestra recorded for the Reference Recordings label under the direction of music director Eiji Oue, winning a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Classical Composition in 2003 with &quot;Casa Guidi&quot;. More recently, Osmo Vänskä conducted a cycle of the Beethoven symphonies and a cycle of the Sibelius symphonies, both for the Swedish label BIS. Their recording of Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony, with the Minnesota Chorale, was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Orchestral Performance in 2007, as was their recording of Sibelius&#x27;s Second and Fifth Symphonies in 2012. On January 26, 2014, the Minnesota Orchestra and Vänskä won the Grammy Award for Best Orchestral Performance for their recording of Sibelius&#x27;s 1st and 4th symphonies. In August 2017, the orchestra released a recording of Mahler&#x27;s Fifth Symphony, starting a cycle of the Mahler symphonies. In November 2017, that recording was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Orchestral Performance.

==Discography==
* Dominick Argento: &quot;Casa Guidi&quot;, &quot;Capriccio for Clarinet and Orchestra&quot; and &quot;In Praise of Music&quot;, with Frederica von Stade and Burt Hara, conducted by Eiji Oue, Reference Recordings, 2002

==Summer festival==
Begun in 1980 with Leonard Slatkin at the helm, the orchestra&#x27;s summer festival has been known by several names, beginning with &quot;Viennese Sommerfest,&quot; changing to &quot;MusicFest&quot; in 2001, and eventually reverting to &quot;Sommerfest&quot; in 2003. Sommerfest concerts are held at Orchestra Hall over a four-week period in midsummer. The orchestra also offers free live music on the plaza before and after each show, in genres varying from folk to jazz to polka. Slatkin was Artistic Director of Sommerfest from 1980 to 1989. Andrew Litton was the festival&#x27;s Artistic Director from 2003 to 2017. 

The orchestra&#x27;s &quot;creative partner for summer programming&quot; is Jon Kimura Parker, whom the orchestra named to the post in 2019. In July 2022, the orchestra announced an extension to Parker&#x27;s summer programming contract through August 2024.

<doc id="159970" wikidata="Q1088477" url="?curid=159970" title="Word of Mouf">
<text>Word of Mouf is the third studio album by American rapper Ludacris. It was released on November 27, 2001, through Disturbing tha Peace and Def Jam South.

Recording sessions took place at PatchWerk Recording Studios, Dungeon Recording Studios and Noontime in Atlanta, Manhattan Center Studios, The Hit Factory and Quad Recording in New York, Hypnotized Minds Studio in Memphis and The Medicine Cabinet in Baton Rouge. Production was handled by Bangladesh, Jazze Pha, Organized Noize, I-20, Jook, KLC, Mike Johnson, P. King &quot;The Specialist&quot;, Swizz Beatz, Timbaland, and Ludacris himself, who also served as executive producer together with Chaka Zulu. It features guest appearances from Fate Wilson, I-20, 4-Ize, Chimere, Jagged Edge, Jazze Pha, Keon Bryce, Mystikal, Nate Dogg, Shawnna, Sleepy Brown, Three 6 Mafia and Twista.

It was supported with four charted singles: &quot;Rollout (My Business)&quot;, &quot;Area Codes&quot;, &quot;Move Bitch&quot;, and &quot;Saturday (Oooh! Ooooh!)&quot;. Ludacris took part in the second edition of the Anger Management Tour in the summer of 2002. Headlined by Eminem along with support from Papa Roach, Xzibit, X-Ecutioners and Bionic Jive. It was his sole Tour where he toured alongside rap acts and rock acts in the same package.

The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 45th Annual Grammy Awards, but lost to &quot;The Eminem Show&quot;.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Word of Mouf&quot; was met with generally favourable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 67 based on eight reviews.

Tom Sinclair of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;with his fashionably foul worldview, Ludacris could indeed be Foxx&#x27;s bastard son, and &quot;Word&quot; often seems like nothing so much as an extended Dolemite routine set to hip-hop beats&quot;. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; found Ludacris &quot;raps and rhymes with gusto&quot;, adding: &quot;song after song pumps the pimp theory that all women are whores. Rotate good-humored dance songs in which the best thing you say about female persons is that they crave your tallywhacker and the worst is that you&#x27;ll murder them if they bother, and you&#x27;ll change how real human beings of both sexes think and behave&quot;. Dele Fadele of &quot;NME&quot; stated that &quot;there&#x27;s a more commercial edge to the beats, as well as a subversive edge you&#x27;d expect from an MC who&#x27;s cribbed from Eddie Murphy routines&quot;. Soren Baker of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; also praised the album&#x27;s comedic nature, commenting that &quot;whether he&#x27;s delivering a punchy one-liner, exaggerating his rhyme flow to a silly extreme or cleverly deploying pop culture references, Ludacris keeps the mood light and festive. Even his skits are funny enough that they could serve as the foundation for a top-tier comedy album&quot;.

In his mixed review, AllMusic&#x27;s Jason Birchmeier called the album a &quot;superstar affair that aims for mass appeal with a broad array of different styles&quot; and enjoyed &quot;witty puns and sly innuendoes&quot; displayed in songs such as &quot;Area Codes&quot;. However, he felt that &quot;amid all of these various team-ups you do lose a little bit of the sincere, personal edge that had characterized much of Ludacris&#x27; debut&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
In the United States, the album debuted at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number-one on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums charts, with first-week sales of 281,000 copies. On November 30, 2022, the album was certified four times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for selling 4,000,000 units in the US alone.

The album reached number 30 on the Canadian Albums and number 6 on the Canadian R&amp;B Albums charts, and by June 27, 2002 was received platinum certification by Canadian Recording Industry Association for the sales of 100,000 copies in Canada.

In the United Kingdom, &quot;Word of Mouf&quot; peaked at number 57 on the UK Albums Chart, number 12 on the UK R&amp;B Albums, and also number 74 on the Scottish Albums charts. It was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry on July 22, 2013, selling 100,000 copies in the UK.

<doc id="159973" wikidata="Q264685" url="?curid=159973" title="Marvin the Paranoid Android">
<text>Marvin the Paranoid Android is a fictional character in &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; series by Douglas Adams. Marvin is the ship&#x27;s robot aboard the starship &quot;Heart of Gold&quot;. Originally built as one of many failed prototypes of Sirius Cybernetics Corporation&#x27;s &quot;GPP&quot; (Genuine People Personalities) technology, Marvin is afflicted with severe depression and boredom, in part because he has a &quot;brain the size of a planet&quot; which he is seldom, if ever, given the chance to use. Instead, the crew request him merely to carry out mundane jobs such as &quot;opening the door&quot;. Indeed, the true horror of Marvin&#x27;s existence is that no task he could be given would occupy even the tiniest fraction of his vast intellect. Marvin claims he is 50,000 times more intelligent than a human (or 30 billion times more intelligent than a live mattress), though this is, if anything, an underestimation. When kidnapped by the bellicose Krikkit robots and tied to the interfaces of their intelligent war computer, Marvin simultaneously manages to plan the entire planet&#x27;s military strategy, solve &quot;all of the major mathematical, , chemical, biological, sociological, philosophical, etymological, meteorological and psychological problems of the Universe, except his own, three times over&quot;, and compose several lullabies.

==Name==
According to Douglas Adams, &quot;Marvin came from Andrew Marshall. He&#x27;s another comedy writer, and he&#x27;s exactly like that.&quot; (Indeed, in one of the early drafts for &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s&quot;, the robot was called Marshall. It was changed to &quot;Marvin&quot; partly to avoid causing offence, but also because it was pointed out to Adams that on radio the name would sound like &quot;&quot;, which would have undesirable military connotations.) However, Adams also admitted that Marvin is part of a long line of literary depressives, such as A. A. Milne&#x27;s Eeyore or Jacques in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;As You Like It&quot;, and even owes something to Adams&#x27;s own periods of depression.

Marvin does not actually display any signs of paranoia, though Zaphod Beeblebrox refers to him as &quot;the Paranoid Android&quot;. Nor does he show any signs of mania, though Ford refers to him as a &quot;manically depressed robot&quot;. He merely remains consistently morose throughout. In fact, he exhibits remarkable stoicism, being willing to wait hundreds of millions of years for his employers to come.

==Radio and TV series==
According to his autobiography read in the Secondary Phase of the radio series, Marvin was constructed, much against his own wishes, by the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation to prototype human personality artificial intelligence. In his own words:

The cutaway illustration of Marvin made by Kevin J. Davies for the &quot;Depreciation Society&quot; featured a &quot;rat cavity&quot;.

As the menial labourer on the &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; spaceship, he grew immensely resentful of the insistence of his new masters (Zaphod Beeblebrox and Trillian; later also Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent) that he open doors, check airlocks and pick up pieces of paper. He reserved a particular contempt for the sentient doors, despising their blissful satisfaction with existence.
When the &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; crew arrive on the ancient planet of Magrathea, they abandon Marvin on the surface. During an apparently suicidal confrontation with a pair of trigger-happy cops, the crew are teleported directly from Magrathea into the future to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe to find that, in fact, they have not travelled at all. The Restaurant was constructed on the ruins of the planet they had just left, and, while there, they find Marvin, who had been waiting patiently for their return for 576,000,003,579 years (he counted them). According to Marvin, &quot;The first ten million years were the worst, and the second ten million years, they were the worst too. The third ten million I didn&#x27;t enjoy at all. After that I went into a bit of a decline.&quot; Apparently, the best conversation he had was over 40 million years ago with a coffee machine.

Deciding they had better leave, the crew make a desperate and futile attempt to engage Marvin&#x27;s enthusiasm (he &quot;hasn&#x27;t got one&quot;) before he simply does what they really want and opens the door to the ship they want to steal. The ship turns out to be a Haggunenon battle cruiser, and the entire group, including Marvin, but excluding Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent, who escape, are eaten by its crew. Marvin&#x27;s subsequent survival is never explained, but against all probability, he eventually finds himself on Ursa Minor Beta, just in time to rescue Zaphod from a robotic tank.

A subsequent section of Marvin&#x27;s biography occurs only in the Secondary Phase of the radio series. Marvin rejoins the crew on the &quot;Heart of Gold&quot;, and using the improbability drive programmed by Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth, takes them to the ravaged planet Brontitall. Having landed in a giant floating marble copy of a plastic cup, the crew accidentally find themselves falling several miles through the air. The carbon-based members of the crew manage to stay alive by grabbing onto passing giant birds. Marvin has no such luck, and, upon impact with the ground, creates his own archaeological excavation site. Cruelly intact, he grudgingly saves the crew multiple times from the Foot Soldiers of the Dolmansaxlil Shoe Corporation. Marvin remains in &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; whilst Ford, Zaphod, Zarniwoop and Arthur bother the Ruler of the Universe, leaving when an enraged Arthur hijacks the ship.

However, in the Tertiary Phase, Trillian claims this story is Zaphod&#x27;s hallucination, especially as the reverse temporal engineering explanation has not entered the plot yet. However, of the stories of Zaphod&#x27;s visit to the Frogstar, the Guide says &quot;10% are 95% true, 14% are 65% true, 35% are only 5% true and the rest are told by Zaphod Beeblebrox&quot;, and listeners are presented with one &quot;version&quot; of that visit.

In the television series, the black ship stolen at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe is actually the stunt ship of the Disaster Area rock band, and, having taken them back in time two million years before the present, is set on an irreversible course to collide with the sun of Kakrafoon. Forced to flee in the ship&#x27;s barely functional teleport, the crew politely ask Marvin to stay behind and operate it. He does so and stoically awaits his fate &quot;almost as good as death&quot; in the heart of the blazing sun.

==Portrayals==
===Radio and TV===
Marvin&#x27;s voice was performed by Stephen Moore on the first five radio series and television series and by Jim Broadbent in the sixth radio series. David Learner operated his body on television, having previously played and voiced the part for the stage version.

===Film===

Warwick Davis wore the Marvin costume in the 2005 film. He is voiced by Alan Rickman. This Marvin&#x27;s design is a departure from the Marvin of the television series, featuring shorter with an oversized head and stubby limbs. The original television costume from the 1981 television series was refurbished for a cameo role in the film, standing in a queue in the Vogon office on Vogsphere, where the main characters are trying to release Tricia, with various other life forms.

==Novel series==
A difference between the radio and TV series occurs in the novels when the &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; crew arrive on the ancient planet of Magrathea. Marvin inadvertently saves the crew by plugging himself into the onboard computer of a police vehicle, which, when exposed to the true nature of Marvin&#x27;s view of the universe, commits suicide, taking the two police who were then firing at the ship&#x27;s crew with it. The crew leave Magrathea on the &quot; Heart of Gold&quot;, but are teleported summarily to Ursa Minor Beta, where Zaphod&#x27;s great grandfather, in an apparent fit of vicious humour, forces Marvin to accompany Zaphod on his mission of self-discovery. Marvin subsequently saves Zaphod&#x27;s life by engaging in a battle of wits with a vicious (yet stupid) automated tank and then is abandoned on the planet Frogstar B when Zaphod is sent to the Total Perspective Vortex. Eventually, the crew arrive at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe (which was built over the ruins of Frogstar B in this continuity) and the story continues as with the TV series.

In the third novel, &quot;Life, the Universe and Everything&quot;, we find that Marvin survived his collision with the sun of Kakrafoon, and was sent back in time by the Improbability Field projected by the &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; to be rescued by a scrap metal merchant on Sqornshellous Zeta. The merchant grafted a steel rod to Marvin&#x27;s now-lost leg and sold him to a Mind Zoo, where excited onlookers would try to make him happy. This made him something of a celebrity on the planet of Sqornshellous Zeta, and he was asked to open the brand new bridge that was meant to revitalise the planet&#x27;s economy. Marvin dutifully plugged himself into the bridge&#x27;s opening circuit, and, just like the police computer, the bridge committed suicide, taking the entire gathered crowd with it. Marvin was left in the swamp, his false leg having trapped him in the mud, so he spent just over 1.5 million years walking around in a circle, &quot;just to make the point.&quot; He planned to keep walking in a circle for another million years before trying it backwards. &quot;Just for the variety, you understand.&quot;

Suddenly, he is kidnapped by a squad of Krikkit war robots, who are after his leg, a fragment of the key that will reopen their imprisoned world and restart the genocidal Krikkit War. Thinking that Marvin&#x27;s intelligence will be an asset, they wire his brain into the interfaces of their intelligent war computer. This is a mistake. The once formidable Krikkit robots find themselves overcome with crippling sorrow and depression, and rather than focusing on their mission of extermination, instead sulk in corners doing quadratic equations. It is also due to Marvin&#x27;s influence that Zaphod and the others&#x27; lives are spared by the Krikkit robots. Marvin is (presumably) rescued by his friends, who bring him back to the &quot;Heart of Gold.&quot; From here his story is unknown.

Marvin reappears in the second-to-last chapter of &quot;So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish&quot;. Arthur and Fenchurch find him on the planet where God&#x27;s Final Message To His Creation is located. He is barely functional, claiming that, due to time travel, he is now &quot;thirty-seven times older than the Universe itself.&quot; Every part of his body has been replaced, with the exception of &quot;all the diodes down [his] left side&quot;, which have been giving him severe pain for the whole of his existence. Arthur and Fenchurch end up carrying him, enduring the robot&#x27;s constant abuse, to the God&#x27;s Final Message viewing station, where they lift him up to see the words of the message: &quot;We apologise for the inconvenience.&quot; Astonishingly, Marvin responds &quot;I think... I feel good about it.&quot; The lights in his eyes go out and his already-worn circuits completely stop working; Marvin is no more. (In the radio dramatisation, his last words are &quot;Goodbye, Arthur.&quot; Marvin&#x27;s &#x27;death&#x27; prompts Arthur to say, &quot;Miserable git!&quot; and then, to his own obvious astonishment, to add, &quot;I&#x27;ll &quot;miss&quot; him.&quot;)

However, in the 2005 radio adaptation of the fifth novel in the series, &quot;Mostly Harmless&quot;, in which Marvin did not originally appear, he has a cameo at the end of the last episode alive and well. He explains that it turned out he was still covered by his warranty agreement and is back to parking cars at Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe.

==Songs==
Stephen Moore released two pop singles—&quot;Marvin/Metal Man&quot; and &quot;Reasons to Be Miserable/Marvin I Love You&quot; (double B-side)—in the UK in 1981, though neither reached the top 40. One song was re-recorded and rearranged to coincide with the 2005 Hitchhiker&#x27;s movie release, &quot;Reasons To Be Miserable (His Name Is Marvin)&quot;, performed by Stephen Fry (singing in the third-person, not as Marvin).

===&quot;Marvin&quot;===
&quot;Marvin&quot; was released in 1981. It was a minor hit, reaching number 52 in the British Charts.

The song involves Marvin describing his woes (&quot;My moving parts are in a solid state&quot;) and frustrations (&quot;You know what really makes me mad? They clean me with a Brillo Pad&quot;), to a synthesiser backing. The intro to the song consists of a simple guitar figure, but with the tape reversed so that the notes play backwards.

The vocal was performed by Stephen Moore, who had played Marvin on the radio and television series. Moore also narrated the ship&#x27;s captain on the B-side.

&quot;Metal Man&quot; was the B-side. The song involves a spoken exchange between the starship captain (also played by Moore, as is a cameo radio voice) and the depressed robot Marvin. The starship is falling into a black hole, and can only be saved by assigning control to Marvin. In thanks for saving the ship, Marvin is relegated back to a menial servant. Such is the lot of a robot.

&quot;Marvin&quot; was incorporated into the 2012 live radio show.

===The Double B-Side===
&quot;Reasons To Be Miserable&quot; was released in 1981. Its official title was &quot;The Double &#x27;B&#x27;-Side&quot;, and it was a double B-side single released by Polydor on Depressive Discs. The song involves Marvin describing his views on life (&quot;I&#x27;d feel a little better if they broke me up for spares&quot;, &quot;If I had my time again, I&#x27;d rather be a lemming&quot;), to a synthesiser backing. The title is a reference to the hit song &quot;Reasons to be Cheerful, Part 3&quot; by Ian Dury and The Blockheads.

&quot;Marvin I Love You&quot; was the other B-side. Marvin describes finding a love letter in his data banks eons after receiving it. The female vocal is provided by Kimi Wong-O&#x27;Brien. The song was a frequently requested tune on the Dr. Demento radio show, and was featured on several Dr. Demento compilation albums. As of 2008, it is ranked 56 out of the top 100 favorite novelty tunes on the official Dr. Demento web site.

===Marvin&#x27;s lullaby===
&quot;How I Hate the Night&quot;, also known as &quot;Marvin&#x27;s lullaby&quot;, was published in the book &quot;Life, the Universe and Everything&quot;, where it is described as &quot;a short dolorous ditty of no tone, or indeed tune.&quot; The first verse of &quot;Marvin&#x27;s Lullaby&quot; appears close to the end of the episode &quot;Fit the Seventeenth&quot;, and the second verse soon after the start of &quot;Fit the Eighteenth&quot; as listed below:

:Now the world has gone to bed
:Darkness won&#x27;t engulf my head
:I can see by infra-red
:How I hate the night

:Now I lay me down to sleep
:Try to count electric sheep
:Sweet dream wishes you can keep
:How I hate the night

The line &quot;try to count electric sheep&quot; is a reference to Philip K. Dick&#x27;s novel &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot;, which inspired the movie &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. According to &quot;Don&#x27;t Panic&quot;, Douglas Adams wrote a guitar tune for the lullaby, and thought it should have been released. In the radio series, Stephen Moore sings the words to a tune resembling &quot;Abendsegen&quot; from Humperdinck&#x27;s opera &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;.
The song was performed at the very end of the 2012 live radio show.

===Outside the &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s&quot; universe===
In the episode &quot;Sibling Tsunami&quot; of the animated series &quot;My Life as a Teenage Robot&quot;, when asked what&#x27;s wrong, XJ-7, a chronically depressed robot character, replied: &quot;The usual, life, the universe, everything&quot;, a reference not only to Marvin, but the &quot;Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything&quot;, a central tenet of the series&#x27; storyline (as well as the title of the third book).

British alternative rock group Radiohead named &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;, the lead single from their 1997 album &quot;OK Computer&quot;, after Marvin. &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; frequently appears on lists of greatest songs of all time and has been described as &quot;possibly the most acclaimed song from the most acclaimed album of all time.&quot;

Marvin&#x27;s origins (including those of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation, and the HitchHikers handheld device) are referenced in the 2008 radio series &quot;The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul&quot;. In episode 4, Dirk Gently phones his friend Richard McDuff, who now works for a new startup, Sirius Cybernetics. Occasionally, background noises of electronic groans and air pistons can be heard. At the end of the phone call, the electronic voice of Stephen Moore says &quot;Richard, I think we might have a problem with these diodes.&quot;

Marvin appeared and was declared the winner in the Q-series episode &quot;Quests: Part II&quot; of the panel game show QI.

<text>In mathematical optimization, the method of Lagrange multipliers is a strategy for finding the local maxima and minima of a function subject to equation constraints (i.e., subject to the condition that one or more equations have to be satisfied exactly by the chosen values of the variables). It is named after the mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange.

== Summary and rationale ==
The basic idea is to convert a constrained problem into a form such that the derivative test of an unconstrained problem can still be applied. The relationship between the gradient of the function and gradients of the constraints rather naturally leads to a reformulation of the original problem, known as the Lagrangian function or Lagrangian. In the general case, the Lagrangian is defined as

:formula_1

for functions formula_2; the notation formula_3 denotes an inner product. The value formula_4 is called the Lagrange multiplier.

In simple cases, where the inner product is defined as the dot product, the Lagrangian is

:formula_5

The method can be summarized as follows: in order to find the maximum or minimum of a function formula_6 subject to the equality constraint formula_7, find the stationary points of formula_8 considered as a function of formula_9 and the Lagrange multiplier formula_10. This means that all partial derivatives should be zero, including the partial derivative with respect to formula_10.

or equivalently
The solution corresponding to the original constrained optimization is always a saddle point of the Lagrangian function, which can be identified among the stationary points from the definiteness of the bordered Hessian matrix.

The great advantage of this method is that it allows the optimization to be solved without explicit parameterization in terms of the constraints. As a result, the method of Lagrange multipliers is widely used to solve challenging constrained optimization problems. Further, the method of Lagrange multipliers is generalized by the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions, which can also take into account inequality constraints of the form formula_12 for a given constant formula_13.

== Statement ==

The following is known as the Lagrange multiplier theorem.

Let formula_14 be the objective function and let formula_15 be the constraints function, both belonging to formula_16 (that is, having continuous first derivatives). Let formula_17 be an optimal solution to the following optimization problem such that, for the matrix of partial derivatives formula_18, formula_19:

formula_20

Then there exists a unique Lagrange multiplier formula_21 such that formula_22 (Note that this is a somewhat conventional thing where formula_23 is clearly treated as a column vector to ensure that the dimensions match. But, we might as well make it just a row vector without taking the transpose.)

The Lagrange multiplier theorem states that at any local maximum (or minimum) of the function evaluated under the equality constraints, if constraint qualification applies (explained below), then the gradient of the function (at that point) can be expressed as a linear combination of the gradients of the constraints (at that point), with the Lagrange multipliers acting as coefficients. This is equivalent to saying that any direction perpendicular to all gradients of the constraints is also perpendicular to the gradient of the function. Or still, saying that the directional derivative of the function is in every feasible direction.

== Single constraint ==
For the case of only one constraint and only two choice variables (as exemplified in Figure 1), consider the optimization problem
formula_24
(Sometimes an additive constant is shown separately rather than being included in formula_25, in which case the constraint is written formula_26 as in Figure 1.) We assume that both formula_27 and formula_28 have continuous first partial derivatives. We introduce a new variable (formula_29) called a Lagrange multiplier (or Lagrange undetermined multiplier) and study the Lagrange function (or Lagrangian or Lagrangian expression) defined by
formula_30
where the formula_29 term may be either added or subtracted. If formula_32 is a maximum of formula_33 for the original constrained problem and formula_34 then there exists formula_35 such that (formula_36) is a &quot;stationary point&quot; for the Lagrange function (stationary points are those points where the first partial derivatives of formula_37 are zero). The assumption formula_38 is called constraint qualification. However, not all stationary points yield a solution of the original problem, as the method of Lagrange multipliers yields only a necessary condition for optimality in constrained problems. Sufficient conditions for a minimum or maximum also exist, but if a particular candidate solution satisfies the sufficient conditions, it is only guaranteed that that solution is the best one &quot;locally&quot; – that is, it is better than any permissible nearby points. The &quot;global&quot; optimum can be found by comparing the values of the original objective function at the points satisfying the necessary and locally sufficient conditions.

The method of Lagrange multipliers relies on the intuition that at a maximum, cannot be increasing in the direction of any such neighboring point that also has . If it were, we could walk along to get higher, meaning that the starting point wasn&#x27;t actually the maximum. Viewed in this way, it is an exact analogue to testing if the derivative of an unconstrained function is , that is, we are verifying that the directional derivative is 0 in any relevant (viable) direction.

We can visualize contours of given by for various values of , and the contour of given by .

Suppose we walk along the contour line with We are interested in finding points where almost does not change as we walk, since these points might be maxima.

There are two ways this could happen:

# We could touch a contour line of , since by definition does not change as we walk along its contour lines. This would mean that the tangents to the contour lines of and are parallel here.
# We have reached a &quot;level&quot; part of , meaning that does not change in any direction.

To check the first possibility (we touch a contour line of ), notice that since the gradient of a function is perpendicular to the contour lines, the tangents to the contour lines of and are parallel if and only if the gradients of and are parallel. Thus we want points where and
formula_39
for some formula_29

where
formula_41
are the respective gradients. The constant formula_29 is required because although the two gradient vectors are parallel, the magnitudes of the gradient vectors are generally not equal. This constant is called the Lagrange multiplier. (In some conventions formula_29 is preceded by a minus sign).

Notice that this method also solves the second possibility, that is level: if is level, then its gradient is zero, and setting formula_44 is a solution regardless of formula_45.

To incorporate these conditions into one equation, we introduce an auxiliary function
formula_46
and solve
formula_47

Note that this amounts to solving three equations in three unknowns. This is the method of Lagrange multipliers.

Note that formula_48 implies formula_49 as the partial derivative of formula_50 with respect to formula_4 is formula_52

To summarize
formula_53

The method generalizes readily to functions on formula_54 variables
formula_55
which amounts to solving equations in unknowns.

The constrained extrema of are &quot;critical points&quot; of the Lagrangian formula_56, but they are not necessarily &quot;local extrema&quot; of formula_37 (see below).

One may reformulate the Lagrangian as a Hamiltonian, in which case the solutions are local minima for the Hamiltonian. This is done in optimal control theory, in the form of Pontryagin&#x27;s maximum principle.

The fact that solutions of the method of Lagrange multipliers are not necessarily extrema of the Lagrangian, also poses difficulties for numerical optimization. This can be addressed by minimizing the &quot;magnitude&quot; of the gradient of the Lagrangian, as these minima are the same as the zeros of the magnitude, as illustrated in Example 5: Numerical optimization.

== Multiple constraints ==
The method of Lagrange multipliers can be extended to solve problems with multiple constraints using a similar argument. Consider a paraboloid subject to two line constraints that intersect at a single point. As the only feasible solution, this point is obviously a constrained extremum. However, the level set of formula_27 is clearly not parallel to either constraint at the intersection point (see Figure 3); instead, it is a linear combination of the two constraints&#x27; gradients. In the case of multiple constraints, that will be what we seek in general: The method of Lagrange seeks points not at which the gradient of formula_27 is a multiple of any single constraint&#x27;s gradient necessarily, but in which it is a linear combination of all the constraints&#x27; gradients.

Concretely, suppose we have formula_60 constraints and are walking along the set of points satisfying formula_61 Every point formula_62 on the contour of a given constraint function formula_63 has a space of allowable directions: the space of vectors perpendicular to formula_64 The set of directions that are allowed by all constraints is thus the space of directions perpendicular to all of the constraints&#x27; gradients. Denote this space of allowable moves by formula_65 and denote the span of the constraints&#x27; gradients by formula_66 Then formula_67 the space of vectors perpendicular to every element of formula_66

We are still interested in finding points where formula_27 does not change as we walk, since these points might be (constrained) extrema. We therefore seek formula_62 such that any allowable direction of movement away from formula_71 is perpendicular to formula_72 (otherwise we could increase formula_73 by moving along that allowable direction). In other words, formula_74 Thus there are scalars formula_75 such that
formula_76

These scalars are the Lagrange multipliers. We now have formula_60 of them, one for every constraint.

As before, we introduce an auxiliary function
formula_78
and solve
formula_79
which amounts to solving formula_80 equations in formula_81 unknowns.

The constraint qualification assumption when there are multiple constraints is that the constraint gradients at the relevant point are linearly independent.

==Modern formulation via differentiable manifolds==

The problem of finding the local maxima and minima subject to constraints can be generalized to finding local maxima and minima on a differentiable manifold formula_82 In what follows, it is not necessary that formula_83 be a Euclidean space, or even a Riemannian manifold. All appearances of the gradient formula_84 (which depends on a choice of Riemannian metric) can be replaced with the exterior derivative formula_85

===Single constraint===
Let formula_86 be a smooth manifold of dimension formula_87 Suppose that we wish to find the stationary points formula_88 of a smooth function formula_89 when restricted to the submanifold formula_90 defined by formula_91 where formula_92 is a smooth function for which is a regular value.

Let formula_93 and formula_94 be the exterior derivatives of formula_95 and formula_96. Stationarity for the restriction formula_97 at formula_98 means formula_99 Equivalently, the kernel formula_100 contains formula_101 In other words, formula_102 and formula_103 are proportional 1-forms. For this it is necessary and sufficient that the following system of formula_104 equations holds:
formula_105
where formula_106 denotes the exterior product. The stationary points formula_88 are the solutions of the above system of equations plus the constraint formula_108 Note that the formula_109 equations are not independent, since the left-hand side of the equation belongs to the subvariety of formula_110 consisting of decomposable elements.

In this formulation, it is not necessary to explicitly find the Lagrange multiplier, a number formula_111 such that formula_112

===Multiple constraints===
Let formula_86 and formula_95 be as in the above section regarding the case of a single constraint. Rather than the function formula_25 described there, now consider a smooth function formula_116 with component functions formula_117 for which formula_118 is a regular value. Let formula_119 be the submanifold of formula_86 defined by formula_121

formula_88 is a stationary point of formula_123 if and only if formula_124 contains formula_125 For convenience let formula_126 and formula_127 where formula_128 denotes the tangent map or Jacobian formula_129 (formula_130 can be canonically identified with formula_131). The subspace formula_132 has dimension smaller than that of formula_133, namely formula_134 and formula_135 formula_132 belongs to formula_137 if and only if formula_138 belongs to the image of formula_139 Computationally speaking, the condition is that formula_140 belongs to the row space of the matrix of formula_141 or equivalently the column space of the matrix of formula_142 (the transpose). If formula_143 denotes the exterior product of the columns of the matrix of formula_144 the stationary condition for formula_97 at formula_88 becomes
formula_147
Once again, in this formulation it is not necessary to explicitly find the Lagrange multipliers, the numbers formula_148 such that
formula_149

==Interpretation of the Lagrange multipliers==
In this section, we modify the constraint equations from the form formula_150 to the form formula_151 where the formula_152 are real constants that are considered to be additional arguments of the Lagrangian expression formula_50.

Often the Lagrange multipliers have an interpretation as some quantity of interest. For example, by parametrising the constraint&#x27;s contour line, that is, if the Lagrangian expression is
formula_154
then
formula_155

So, is the rate of change of the quantity being optimized as a function of the constraint parameter.
As examples, in Lagrangian mechanics the equations of motion are derived by finding stationary points of the action, the time integral of the difference between kinetic and potential energy. Thus, the force on a particle due to a scalar potential, , can be interpreted as a Lagrange multiplier determining the change in action (transfer of potential to kinetic energy) following a variation in the particle&#x27;s constrained trajectory. 
In control theory this is formulated instead as costate equations.

Moreover, by the envelope theorem the optimal value of a Lagrange multiplier has an interpretation as the marginal effect of the corresponding constraint constant upon the optimal attainable value of the original objective function: If we denote values at the optimum with a star (formula_156), then it can be shown that
formula_157

For example, in economics the optimal profit to a player is calculated subject to a constrained space of actions, where a Lagrange multiplier is the change in the optimal value of the objective function (profit) due to the relaxation of a given constraint (e.g. through a change in income); in such a context formula_158 is the marginal cost of the constraint, and is referred to as the shadow price.

==Sufficient conditions==
Sufficient conditions for a constrained local maximum or minimum can be stated in terms of a sequence of principal minors (determinants of upper-left-justified sub-matrices) of the bordered Hessian matrix of second derivatives of the Lagrangian expression.

== Examples ==

=== Example 1 ===
Suppose we wish to maximize formula_159 subject to the constraint formula_160 The feasible set is the unit circle, and the level sets of are diagonal lines (with slope −1), so we can see graphically that the maximum occurs at formula_161 and that the minimum occurs at formula_162

For the method of Lagrange multipliers, the constraint is
formula_163
hence the Lagrangian function,
formula_164
is a function that is equivalent to formula_165 when formula_166 is set to .

Now we can calculate the gradient:
formula_167
and therefore:
formula_168

Notice that the last equation is the original constraint.

The first two equations yield
formula_169
By substituting into the last equation we have:
formula_170
so
formula_171
which implies that the stationary points of formula_50 are
formula_173

Evaluating the objective function at these points yields
formula_174

Thus the constrained maximum is formula_175 and the constrained minimum is formula_176.

=== Example 2 ===
Now we modify the objective function of Example 1 so that we minimize formula_177 instead of formula_178 again along the circle formula_179 Now the level sets of formula_73 are still lines of slope −1, and the points on the circle tangent to these level sets are again formula_181 and formula_182 These tangency points are maxima of formula_183

On the other hand, the minima occur on the level set for formula_184 (since by its construction formula_95 cannot take negative values), at formula_186 and formula_187 where the level curves of formula_95 are not tangent to the constraint. The condition that formula_189 correctly identifies all four points as extrema; the minima are characterized in by formula_190 and the maxima by formula_191

=== Example 3 ===
This example deals with more strenuous calculations, but it is still a single constraint problem.

Suppose one wants to find the maximum values of
formula_192
with the condition that the formula_88- and formula_194-coordinates lie on the circle around the origin with radius formula_195 That is, subject to the constraint
formula_196

As there is just a single constraint, there is a single multiplier, say formula_197

The constraint formula_166 is identically zero on the circle of radius formula_195 Any multiple of formula_166 may be added to formula_166 leaving formula_166 unchanged in the region of interest (on the circle where our original constraint is satisfied).

Applying the ordinary Lagrange multiplier method yields
formula_203
from which the gradient can be calculated:
formula_204
And therefore:
formula_205
(iii) is just the original constraint. (i) implies formula_206 or formula_207 If formula_208 then formula_209 by (iii) and consequently formula_210 from (ii). If formula_211 substituting this into (ii) yields formula_212 Substituting this into (iii) and solving for formula_194 gives formula_214 Thus there are six critical points of formula_215
formula_216

Evaluating the objective at these points, one finds that
formula_217

Therefore, the objective function attains the global maximum (subject to the constraints) at formula_218 and the global minimum at formula_219 The point formula_220 is a local minimum of formula_95 and formula_222 is a local maximum of formula_223 as may be determined by consideration of the Hessian matrix of formula_224

Note that while formula_225 is a critical point of formula_226 it is not a local extremum of formula_227 We have
formula_228

Given any neighbourhood of formula_229 one can choose a small positive formula_230 and a small formula_231 of either sign to get formula_232 values both greater and less than formula_233 This can also be seen from the Hessian matrix of formula_234 evaluated at this point (or indeed at any of the critical points) which is an indefinite matrix. Each of the critical points of formula_234 is a saddle point of formula_227

=== Example 4 – Entropy ===

Suppose we wish to find the discrete probability distribution on the points formula_237 with maximal information entropy. This is the same as saying that we wish to find the least structured probability distribution on the points formula_238 In other words, we wish to maximize the Shannon entropy equation:
formula_239

For this to be a probability distribution the sum of the probabilities formula_240 at each point formula_241 must equal 1, so our constraint is:
formula_242

We use Lagrange multipliers to find the point of maximum entropy, formula_243 across all discrete probability distributions formula_244 on formula_245 We require that:
formula_246
which gives a system of equations, formula_247 such that:
formula_248

Carrying out the differentiation of these equations, we get
formula_249

This shows that all formula_250 are equal (because they depend on only). By using the constraint
formula_251
we find
formula_252

Hence, the uniform distribution is the distribution with the greatest entropy, among distributions on points.

=== Example 5 – Numerical optimization===


The critical points of Lagrangians occur at saddle points, rather than at local maxima (or minima). Unfortunately, many numerical optimization techniques, such as hill climbing, gradient descent, some of the quasi-Newton methods, among others, are designed to find local maxima (or minima) and not saddle points. For this reason, one must either modify the formulation to ensure that it&#x27;s a minimization problem (for example, by extremizing the square of the gradient of the Lagrangian as below), or else use an optimization technique that finds stationary points (such as Newton&#x27;s method without an extremum seeking line search) and not necessarily extrema.

As a simple example, consider the problem of finding the value of that minimizes formula_253 constrained such that formula_254 (This problem is somewhat untypical because there are only two values that satisfy this constraint, but it is useful for illustration purposes because the corresponding unconstrained function can be visualized in three dimensions.)

Using Lagrange multipliers, this problem can be converted into an unconstrained optimization problem:
formula_255

The two critical points occur at saddle points where and .

In order to solve this problem with a numerical optimization technique, we must first transform this problem such that the critical points occur at local minima. This is done by computing the magnitude of the gradient of the unconstrained optimization problem.

First, we compute the partial derivative of the unconstrained problem with respect to each variable:
formula_256

If the target function is not easily differentiable, the differential with respect to each variable can be approximated as
formula_257
where formula_258 is a small value.

Next, we compute the magnitude of the gradient, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of the partial derivatives:
formula_259

(Since magnitude is always non-negative, optimizing over the squared-magnitude is equivalent to optimizing over the magnitude. Thus, the &quot;square root&quot; may be omitted from these equations with no expected difference in the results of optimization.)

The critical points of occur at and , just as in formula_260 Unlike the critical points in formula_261 however, the critical points in occur at local minima, so numerical optimization techniques can be used to find them.

==Applications==

===Control theory===
In optimal control theory, the Lagrange multipliers are interpreted as costate variables, and Lagrange multipliers are reformulated as the minimization of the Hamiltonian, in Pontryagin&#x27;s maximum principle.

===Nonlinear programming===
The Lagrange multiplier method has several generalizations. In nonlinear programming there are several multiplier rules, e.g. the Carathéodory–John Multiplier Rule and the Convex Multiplier Rule, for inequality constraints.

===Economics===

In many models in mathematical economics such as general equilibrium models, consumer behavior is implemented as utility maximization and firm behavior as profit maximization, both entities being subject to constraints such as budget constraints and production constraints. The usual way to determine an optimal solution is achieved by maximizing some function, where the constraints are enforced using Lagrangian multipliers.

===Power systems===
Methods based on Lagrange multipliers have applications in power systems, e.g. in distributed-energy-resources (DER) placement and load shedding.

===Safe Reinforcement Learning===
The method of Lagrange multipliers applies to constrained Markov decision processes. 
It naturally produces gradient-based primal-dual algorithms in safe reinforcement learning.

===Normalized solutions===
Considering the PDE problems with constraints, i.e., the study of the properties of the normalized solutions, Lagrange multipliers play an important role.

<text>Jacques Bernard Edmon Martin Henri &quot;Jacky&quot; Ickx (; born 1 January 1945) is a Belgian former racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . Ickx twice finished runner-up in the Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship in and , and won eight Grands Prix across 14 seasons. In endurance racing, Ickx won two World Endurance Championships with Porsche and is a six-time winner of the 24 Hours of Le Mans, as well as a two-time winner of the 12 Hours of Sebring. In rallying, Ickx won the Paris–Dakar Rally in 1983 with Mercedes.

Born and raised in Brussels, Ickx started his career in motorcycle road racing and trials, winning several national and continental titles in the latter discipline. Progressing to touring car racing in the mid-1960s, Ickx won multiple titles before winning the 24 Hours of Spa in 1966. Attracting the attention of Ken Tyrrell, he entered the 1966 German Grand Prix in a Matra Formula Two car, retiring after a first-lap collision with John Taylor, who later died of his injuries. Ickx returned to the race the following year, qualifying third in his Formula Two machinery and earning a Formula One drive with Cooper from the onwards, where he finished sixth. Ickx was signed by Ferrari in , taking his maiden victory in France, amongst several podiums, as he finished fourth in the standings.

Moving to Brabham in , he took multiple wins as he finished runner-up to Jackie Stewart. He returned to Ferrari the next year, again finishing runner-up to Jochen Rindt as he took wins in Austria, Canada and Mexico. Ickx took further wins for Ferrari at the in and the in , but left the team halfway through the season over the performance of the Ferrari 312B3. After one-off appearances for McLaren and Williams, Ickx joined Lotus in , but left after less than two seasons with the team. He returned to the sport with Wolf–Williams in , swapping seats with Chris Amon at Ensign from the onwards. After intermittent appearances for Ensign over the next three seasons, Ickx joined Ligier in , replacing an injured Patrick Depailler at the final eight Grands Prix of the season. Struggling to adapt to the ground effect era, Ickx retired from Formula One at the conclusion of the 1979 season with eight race wins, 13 pole positions, 14 fastest laps and 25 podiums.

Outside of Formula One, Ickx won the 24 Hours of Le Mans six times, a record which stood until . He also won the 12 Hours of Sebring in 1969 and 1972, and the 24 Hours of Daytona in 1972 alongside Mario Andretti, making him the fourth driver to complete the Triple Crown of endurance racing. Ickx won two World Endurance Championships in 1982 and 1983 with Porsche. He retired from endurance racing in 1985, following his involvement in the death of Stefan Bellof. Between 1981 and 2000, Ickx entered 14 editions of the Dakar Rally, winning in 1983. Ickx was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 2002.

==Early life and career==
Jacques Bernard Edmon Martin Henri Ickx was born on 1 January 1945 in Brussels, Ickx was introduced to motorsports when he was taken by his father, motoring journalist Jacques Ickx, to races which he covered. Despite this family background, Ickx had limited interest in the sport until his father bought him a 50 cc Zündapp motorcycle.

He began to compete in road racing and motorcycle trials. He won the 50 cc class at the 1962 Mettet Grand Prix road race, then demonstrated impressive talent when he defeated future motocross world champion Roger De Coster in the 1963 Belgian 50 cc trials national championship. Soon afterwards, Ickx won 8 of 13 races at the first season and the European 50 cc trials title.

He took another two titles before he moved to racing a Lotus Cortina in touring car racing, taking his national saloon car championship in 1965, as well as winning the Spa 24 Hours race in 1966 driving a BMW 2000TI. He also competed in sports car races where he had already significant experience from taking part in the 1000 km races at the Nürburgring.

==Formula One career==

===Debut and early career (1966–1967)===
Ickx entered his first Grand Prix at the Nürburgring in 1966, driving a Matra MS5-Cosworth one-litre Formula Two (F2) car, entered by Ken Tyrrell. However, a first lap collision with John Taylor at Flugplatz caused both cars to retire and Taylor later died as a result of burns received in the accident, after his car caught fire. In 1967, Ickx again drove at the Nurburgring, with an F2 Matra MS7-Cosworth 1.6-litre, also entered by Tyrrell. Despite the greater power of the Formula One cars, only two drivers qualified with a faster time than Ickx: Denny Hulme and Jim Clark. As Ickx was racing in the separate F2 class, he started the race behind all of the Formula One cars, but within four laps of the 28 km circuit he was up to fifth place, having overtaken 12 Formula One cars. He was forced to retire after 12 laps with a broken front suspension, but set the fastest lap of the F2 runners.

At Monza in 1967, he made his Formula One debut in a Cooper T81B-Maserati, finishing sixth, despite suffering a puncture on the last lap. He also drove for Cooper in the United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen but retired on lap 45 with overheating.

===Ferrari (1968)===

In 1968 Ickx drove in Formula 1 for Ferrari. He retired from his first two races, but at his home race at Spa-Francorchamps he started from the front row and finished third. In the French Grand Prix at Rouen he took his first win, in heavy rain. Ickx also finished third at Brands Hatch and fourth at the Nürburgring after driving almost the entire race in heavy rain without his helmet visor. At Monza he finished the race in third position. In Canada he crashed and broke his left leg during practice, thus did not start and also missed the subsequent United States Grand Prix. He returned in time for the final race of the season in Mexico. Ickx scored 27 points in the 1968 Formula One season finishing in fourth place behind Graham Hill, Jackie Stewart and Hulme.

===Brabham (1969)===
In 1969, Ickx moved to Brabham, partly at the instigation of the John Wyer team for whom he&#x27;d had considerable success in sports cars. Wyer&#x27;s main sponsor, Gulf Oil were keen to ensure that they retained his services rather than possibly lose him to Ferrari&#x27;s sports car team. His first results at Brabham were poor, but after Jack Brabham broke his foot in a testing accident, Ickx&#x27;s results improved: Alan Henry suggests that Ickx performed better with the whole team focussed on him. Ickx finished third in France, second in Great Britain and won in Canada and in Germany at the Nürburgring, where he also took pole position and fastest lap, in the last Formula One race there before &#x27;The Ring&#x27; was made less bumpy and dangerous. In the 1969 Mexican Grand Prix Ickx finished second and ended the year as runner-up in the drivers&#x27; world championship, behind Stewart. He returned to the Ferrari team for the 1970 season, a move he had been considering since the Italian Grand Prix.

===Return to Ferrari (1970–1973)===

As in 1969, Ickx had a disappointing start to the 1970 season. On the first lap of the Spanish Grand Prix he collided with the BRM of Jackie Oliver and his car caught fire. It took at least 20 seconds for him to leave the burning car and he was hospitalized with severe burns. After 17 days he was back in his car at the Monaco Grand Prix, where he ran fifth before retiring with a driveshaft failure. The car started to improve and at the German Grand Prix (held at Hockenheim as his favourite Nürburgring was boycotted for safety reasons) he fought with Jochen Rindt for the win, but finished a close second. At the Austrian Grand Prix it was Ickx that took the win. At Monza, Rindt died in an accident during qualifying. Ickx was the only driver with a chance to take the championship from Rindt who had already won five of nine races in that season, with four more to go. Monza saw a win by Ferrari teammate Clay Regazzoni while Ickx&#x27;s car broke down. The Belgian took the win at Canada and if he could win at the remaining two events, he would overtake Rindt and win the championship. However, in the US Grand Prix at Watkins Glen he only finished fourth, with Rindt&#x27;s replacement Emerson Fittipaldi scoring his first career win, and thus was mathematically eliminated from the championship chase. Despite winning the last race in Mexico, Ickx could not beat Rindt&#x27;s points total. Ickx later stated in a 2011 article in the British magazine &quot;Motor Sport&quot; that he was glad he did not win the 1970 World Championship. He did not want to win against a man who could not defend his chances, referring to the deceased Rindt.
In 1971, Ickx and Ferrari started as favourites, but the championship went to Jackie Stewart with the new Tyrrell. Ferrari traditionally started the season with its full attention on the sports car championship rather than Formula One, a fact that had already caused John Surtees to leave in the middle of the 1966 season. Ickx won at Zandvoort in the rain with Firestone wet tyres, while Stewart had no chance with his Goodyear rubber. After that, he had a lot of retirements, while Stewart took one win after the other, despite Ickx giving him a good challenge at the Nürburgring once again, where both drivers shared victories from 1968 to 1973. That long and very challenging track was the favourite of Ickx, while Stewart had called it the &#x27;Green Hell&#x27; as well as being a driving force behind the driver boycott of 1970 that urged the Germans to rework the layout of the track, which had been built in 1927. Stewart said the only thing that had changed since then were the trees growing bigger. As requested, those near the track were cut and replaced with a small run-off area, and armco. So, the Scot and the Belgian not only fought on the track, but also off the track. Stewart was constantly fighting for more safety in Formula One, while Ickx thought by doing that the challenge was taken out of the sport.

In 1972, Ickx stayed at Ferrari and finished second in Spain and Monaco. After that the Ferrari only got noticed for its retirements. Yet, once again it was the Nürburgring where Ickx was eager to show it was his track, giving his great rival Stewart no chance at all. As for Stewart one year later, and other champions such as Juan Manuel Fangio in 1957, it turned out that the last Formula One win for Ickx came at Nürburgring, where superior driving skill could beat superior machinery.

In 1973, the Ferrari 312B3 was no longer competitive, and Ickx only managed one fourth place at the opening Grand Prix of the season. While being successful with their sports cars, which were driven to several wins by Ickx himself, the Formula One programme of the Italians was outclassed, and they even had to skip some races, notably at the Nürburgring. This was not acceptable to Ickx, who left the team halfway through the season (after the 1973 British Grand Prix, where he finished eighth). Instead, he competed in the German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring in a McLaren, and scored a sterling third place behind the all-conquering Tyrrells of Stewart and François Cevert. Ickx returned to Ferrari for the Italian Grand Prix at Monza again finishing eighth but drove for Williams in the 1973 United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen finishing seventh.

===Lotus (1974–1975)===

When Ickx signed with Team Lotus in 1974, a difficult period awaited. Lotus had problems replacing the successful but ageing Lotus 72 (which debuted in 1970) with the troublesome Lotus 76 and, during the opening races of the championship, Ickx only managed a solitary third place in Brazil. Ickx demonstrated that he was still the Rain Master when he won the non-championship Race of Champions at Brands Hatch after having passed Niki Lauda on the outside at Paddock Bend. After the Brazilian Grand Prix his season deteriorated, the Lotus-Ford retiring in five consecutive races until an eleventh-place finish at Zandvoort. However, in mid season Ickx recovered some form, rising through the field in the British Grand Prix to finish a strong third. Even better was his drive in the German Grand Prix. For most of the race Ickx dueled for fourth place with his teammate Ronnie Peterson who was using a Lotus 76, which had been grafted to the back end of a Lotus 72, Mike Hailwood in a McLaren M23 and Jochen Mass in a Surtees running on his home circuit on Firestone tyres well suited to the circuit. It was a classic duel on the daunting circuit, which still lacked armco around half the track in 1974. Two laps from the end Hailwood crashed badly ending his World Championship career. On the last two laps Ickx was getting close to third place Carlos Reutemann, but on the final lap, Ronnie Peterson slipstreamed past to claim 4th. In Austria, Ickx, this time in the Lotus 76, moved up the field but went off while attempting to take Depailler for second. In the last races of the year, tyre issues with Goodyears unsuitable for the Lotus 72 and 76 meant Lotus were not competitive.

1975 was even more disastrous for Lotus and Ickx left the team halfway through the season, even though he managed a second place in the chaotic Spanish Grand Prix which was overshadowed by accidents and stopped before half distance. Ickx was generally qualifying about 0.8 seconds slower than teammate Peterson. Ickx was stood down after the 1975 French GP with the promise that Chapman might re-employ him when a competitive new Lotus was ready to race. Ickx did not compete in Formula One for the remainder of 1975.

===Later career (1976–1979)===
It seemed that the end of Ickx&#x27;s career was near. After Fittipaldi left McLaren, Ickx was at the &quot;top of the list.&quot; However, James Hunt got the drive, allegedly because McLaren&#x27;s chief sponsor John Hogan had known Hunt for many years. (After Hunt&#x27;s death, Hogan claimed that he preferred Ickx but McLaren leadership wanted Hunt.) In 1976 Ickx began the season with Wolf–Williams Racing (then entering as &quot;Frank Williams Racing Cars&quot;), but after three races signed with the new team of Walter Wolf Racing, which had substantial financial backing from Wolf. The Wolf team were also running the Wolf–Williams FW05 which was essentially a rebadged Hesketh 308C from 1975 and was uncompetitive. However, at the Race of Champions, Ickx was challenging Hunt and Alan Jones for the lead, when Ickx&#x27;s visor ripped off. In the world championship races he failed to qualify on four occasions, (a first in his career) achieving a degree of respectability only with a 7th in Spain and a good drive to 10th out of 19 finishers in the French GP in a car which, in the estimate of James Hunt and Chris Amon, was worse than useless. Nevertheless, for a large payment from Wolf, Amon agreed to swap drives with Ickx and Ickx raced the rest of the season in the fast and fragile Lotus styled Ensign N176, in which design Amon had suffered horrific breakages at Zolder and in the Swedish GP. For most of the Dutch GP, Ickx moved through the field, running the third fastest lap and on most laps was the fastest car in the race. With a newer Cosworth engine, Ickx probably would have won, but the under-maintained engine expired ten laps from the end. In the Italian race, Ickx drove at competitive pace in a Grand Prix for the last time, when he finished tenth, only 30 seconds behind winner Ronnie Peterson, hard on the tail of Carlos Reutemann in a works Ferrari 312T2 in ninth. After a bad crash at the United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen which he was lucky to have survived with only ankle injuries, Ickx only competed sporadically. In 1977 Ickx competed in only one Grand Prix at Monaco for Ensign finishing tenth. In 1978 he entered four Grands Prix, again for Ensign but only achieved a twelfth place at Zolder. In the Swedish Grand Prix at Anderstorp Ickx failed to qualify.

In 1979, he ended his career as a Grand Prix driver at Ligier, standing in for the injured Patrick Depailler, gaining a fifth and sixth, but finding the ground effect cars dangerous and disconcerting, ill-suited to his precise style. Outside of Formula One, Ickx continued to win races in various sports car series, which he had decided to concentrate on exclusively.

==Endurance racing career==
In 1966, Ickx teamed up with Hubert Hahne in a BMW 2000TI to win the Spa 24 Hours endurance race in his native Belgium. In 1967, Ickx won the 1000km of Spa with Dick Thompson in the Gulf-liveried JW Automotive Mirage M1. In 1968, Ickx won the Brands Hatch six-hour endurance race partnered with Brian Redman in a John Wyer entered Ford GT40 Mk1. Ickx would go on to win the Brands race on a further three occasions, in 1972 for Ferrari alongside Mario Andretti and 1977 and 1982 driving Porsches with Jochen Mass and Derek Bell respectively.
Ickx won the 1969 24 Hours of Le Mans, his first victory in that race. This race also saw the first appearance of the Porsche 917 at Le Mans, which was regarded by far as the favourite. The Ford GT40 that Ickx drove with Jackie Oliver appeared at that time to be an obsolete car, outperformed by the new Porsche 917 but also by the older Porsche 908 and the new generation of 3-litre prototypes from Ferrari, Matra and Alfa Romeo.

As Ickx was opposed to the traditional Le Mans start which he considered to be dangerous, he slowly walked across the track to his machine, instead of running. He locked the safety belt carefully and thus was the last to start the race, chasing the field. On lap one, private driver John Woolfe, who had not taken time to belt himself in, had a fatal accident in his new and powerful 917.
During the race the Porsche 917 cars proved unreliable, and none finished. The last four hours of the race turned into a duel between the Porsche 908 of Hans Herrmann/Gérard Larrousse and the Ford GT-40 of Ickx/Oliver. In the last hour, Ickx and Herrmann continually leapfrogged each other, the Porsche being faster on the straights owing to having less aerodynamic drag, while being passed again under braking as the brake pads were worn and the team reckoned there was not enough time left to change them. Ickx won the race by the smallest of competitive margins ever, with less than between the two cars, despite having lost a bigger distance intentionally at the start. He also won his case for safety: from 1970, all drivers could start the race sitting in their cars with the belts tightened properly.

In later years, Ickx won a record six times at the 24h race at Le Mans, becoming known as &quot;Monsieur Le Mans&quot;. Three of the wins were with Derek Bell: this would become one of the most legendary partnerships. In 2005, Tom Kristensen surpassed Ickx&#x27;s record and when Kristensen announced his proposed retirement at the end of the 2014 season had nine victories.
From 1976 on, he was a factory driver for Porsche and their new turbocharged race cars, the 935 and especially the 936 sports car, which he drove to wins in Le Mans three times. These drives, as well as the losing effort in 1978, often in the rain and at night, were some of the finest ever. Ickx considers the 1977 24 Hours of Le Mans race to be his favourite win of all time. Retiring earlier on in another Porsche 936, which he shared with Henri Pescarolo, the team transferred him to the car of Jürgen Barth and Hurley Haywood which was in 42nd place. Ickx made up for lost laps to lead the race by early morning, but suffered a mechanical problem which forced the car to pit. The mechanics resolved the issue by switching off one cylinder, and Ickx went on to win the race. The win in 1982 came with the new and superior Porsche 956 model, though, which carried him to two titles as world champion of endurance racing, in 1982 and 1983.

In 1983, Ickx was the team leader at Porsche, but a new teammate was faster than he was: young German Stefan Bellof set new lap records at the Nürburgring in the last ever sports car race held on the original configuration of Ickx&#x27;s favourite track. As it turned out, Ickx and Bellof would become involved in controversial events later on.

In 1984, Ickx acted as Formula One race director in Monaco. He stopped the race before half distance due to heavy rain, just as leader Alain Prost was being caught by a young Ayrton Senna and Bellof. Prost thus won the race but was awarded only half the points for a win (4.5); the Frenchman subsequently lost the 1984 World Championship to McLaren team-mate Niki Lauda by half a point.
In 1985, Ickx was involved with Bellof again, but with fatal consequences. Bellof raced a privateer Porsche while waiting to join the Ferrari in 1986, which had promised him a seat after his performance in Monaco, similar to what they had done for Lauda after he outclassed Ickx there in 1973. At Spa, Ickx&#x27;s home track, the young German in the private Porsche 956 of Walter Brun tried to pass the experienced Belgian in the factory Porsche 962 for first place after being behind Ickx for three laps. At Eau Rouge corner, Bellof attempted to pass from the left, but Ickx turned left from the right side at the entry of the Eau Rouge and they collided and crashed, Bellof dying an hour later after he crashed the barrier in the &quot;Raidillon&quot; part of the track head-on, while Ickx was shaken but unharmed. He retired from professional circuit racing at the end of the season.

==Further racing career==
Ickx also co-drove to victory with Allan Moffat at the 1977 Hardie-Ferodo 1000 in Australia, becoming the last debutant to win the race until 2011, when Nick Percat matched this feat partnering two-time winner Garth Tander. The victory at the Bathurst 1000 was in a Ford XC Falcon Group C Touring Car manufactured in Australia with limited modifications for racing. After only days practice in a car he had never driven before he was doing lap times the same or quicker than drivers who drove nothing else and who were familiar with the circuit. Ickx visited Bathurst&#x27;s National Motor Racing Museum in January 2025, where he was reunited with the car he and Moffat had driven to victory some 38 years prior.

In 1979, in the newly reborn Can-Am series for rebodied covered wheel Formula 5000 cars, Ickx won against strong opposition from Keke Rosberg, Elliot Forbes-Robinson and Bobby Rahal. Formula One fledgling Rosberg drove his Can Am car with ferocity, but often went off the road trying to match the pace of Ickx, who won the series decisively at the season finale at Riverside. The previous weekend, on the dangerous and undulating Laguna Seca circuit near Monterey, Ickx elected to race conservatively rather than going after leaders Forbes-Robinson and Rosberg, but film of the race indicates the brutal nature of this late generation of Can Am racing. Ickx did not return to defend his title the following season.

One of his other Le Mans victories in a non-driving capacity was when he consulted for the Oreca team who were running a Mazda 787B for Mazdaspeed in 1991. Ickx was also selected to participate in the 1978 and 1984 editions of the International Race of Champions.

Although he had never driven a stock car before, Ickx was entered to race in the 1969 Daytona 500, in a car owned by Junior Johnson. A few days before the race, Ickx crashed the car during practice, and although he was not injured, the car was damaged beyond repair. The team&#x27;s only backup car was needed by eventual race winner LeeRoy Yarbrough, so Ickx did not have the opportunity to race.

After he retired from his professional racing career, he continued to compete in the Paris-Dakar Rally, even competing with daughter Vanina in recent years. He won the event in 1983 driving a Mercedes-Benz G-Class. Nowadays, he appears in historic events as a driver, such as the Goodwood Festival of Speed and the Monterey Historics, usually on behalf of Porsche, Ferrari and Genesis. He still acts as the Clerk of the Course for the Monaco Grand Prix and is still a resident of Brussels.

<doc id="159976" wikidata="Q206235" url="?curid=159976" title="Alex D. Linz">
<text>Alexander David Linz (born January 3, 1989) is an American former child actor who starred in several late 1990s and early 2000s films and television series. His film roles include &quot;Home Alone 3&quot; (1997) and &quot;Max Keeble&#x27;s Big Move&quot; (2001). He retired from acting in 2007.

== Early life, family and education==
Linz was born in Santa Barbara, California, the son of Deborah (née Baltaxe), an attorney, and Dr. Daniel Linz, a professor of communication at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He has two younger sisters, Lily Alice and Livia. His parents are divorced, and he lived with his mother. The family is Jewish, and Alex had a bar mitzvah ceremony. 

He attended Alexander Hamilton High School in Los Angeles, during which time he was the lead singer of a garage band, The Fez Armada.

After his career as a child actor, Linz attended college at University of California, Berkeley, where he became involved in a campus improv group, Jericho!. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 2011. He earned his master&#x27;s degree in urban and regional planning at University of California, Los Angeles in 2017.

== Acting career ==
Linz made his professional acting debut in 1995 on an episode of the television series &quot;Cybill&quot;. He subsequently appeared in several television productions, played Phillip Chancellor IV on the soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; in 1995 for a short period of time.

He was cast as the son of Michelle Pfeiffer&#x27;s character in the 1996 feature film &quot;One Fine Day&quot;. His big breakthrough came in the 1997 Christmas film &quot;Home Alone 3&quot;, but the film received a lukewarm response due to lacking a reprising cast that represented the McCallister family of the previous blockbuster &quot;Home Alone&quot; feature films. In 2001, Linz played the title character in the Disney film &quot;Max Keeble&#x27;s Big Move&quot;, which received mixed reviews and was a box-office failure.

==Career after acting==
, Linz was working as a legal researcher in Los Angeles, California, and he is also a lead science instructor.

<text>John Barnett (15 July 1802 – 16 April 1890) was an English composer and writer on music.

==Life==
Barnett was the eldest son of a Prussian Jew named Bernhard Beer, who changed his surname on settling in England as a jeweller. According to some he was a cousin of the composer Giacomo Meyerbeer. Barnett was born at Bedford, and at the age of eleven sang at the Lyceum Theatre stage in London. His good voice led to his being given a musical education, and he soon began writing songs and lighter pieces for the stage.

In 1834 he published a collection of &quot;Lyrical Illustrations of the Modern Poets&quot;. His opera &quot;The Mountain Sylph&quot; – with which his name is nowadays most associated – received a warm welcome when produced at the Lyceum on 25 August 1834, as the first modern English opera, and was given over 100 performances, which was an unusual success. It was followed by &quot;Fair Rosamond&quot; in 1837, and &quot;Farinelli&quot; in 1839, to librettos by his younger brother Charles Zachary Barnett, but Barnett never again achieved the success that he had enjoyed with &quot;The Mountain Sylph&quot;. Disappointed with his reception as a composer, Barnett retired to the country. He had a large connection as a singing-master at Cheltenham, and published &quot;Systems and Singing-masters&quot; (1842) and &quot;School for the Voice&quot; (1844). Barnett wrote several songs for the theatre with the actor, playwright and theatre manager John Baldwin Buckstone, and also some instrumental works, including three string quartets and a violin sonata.

Amongst his light music is a piece for Concertina and Piano called &quot;Spare Moments&quot; composed in 1859.

One of his daughters Clara Kathleen Barnett became a singer and composer; another daughter, a goddaughter of Franz Liszt, married the prolific author R. E. Francillon. His nephew John Francis Barnett (1837–1916) was also a composer.

Although &quot;The Mountain Sylph&quot; is all but forgotten, it inspired parts of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s 1882 Savoy Opera, &quot;Iolanthe&quot;.

<doc id="159979" wikidata="Q613901" url="?curid=159979" title="Arthur Dent">
<text>Arthur Philip Dent is a fictional character and the hapless protagonist of the comic science fiction series &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; by Douglas Adams.

In the radio, LP and television versions of the story, Arthur is played by Simon Jones (not to be confused with Peter Jones, the voice of the guide). In Ken Campbell&#x27;s 1979 stage production, Chris Langham took the part. In the 2005 film adaptation, he is played by Martin Freeman. In &quot;The Illustrated Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, he is portrayed by Jonathan Lermit.

==Arthur&#x27;s story==
Along with Ford Prefect, Arthur Dent barely escapes from Earth as it is demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Arthur spends the next several years, still wearing his dressing gown, helplessly launched from crisis to crisis while trying to straighten out his lifestyle. He rather enjoys tea, but seems to have trouble obtaining it in the far reaches of the galaxy. In time, he learns how to fly and carves a niche for himself as a sandwich-maker.

In most versions of the series, Arthur and Ford eventually find themselves back on Earth, but two million years in the past, marooned with a third of the Golgafrincham population (consisting of hairdressers, account executives, film-makers, security guards, telephone sanitisers, and the like). The Golgafrincham arrival spurs the extinction of the native &quot;cavemen&quot; (although, as Ford Prefect pointed out, they did not live in caves, to which a witty repartee was that they &#x27;might have been getting their caves redecorated&#x27;), resulting in the human race&#x27;s eventual replacement by a shipload of middle managers, telephone sanitisers and hairdressers.

The original radio series and the television series end at this point, although a second radio series was made in which Ford and Arthur are rescued by Ford&#x27;s cousin Zaphod Beeblebrox and have further adventures, and which ends with Arthur stealing Zaphod&#x27;s spaceship, the &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; (which Zaphod had himself stolen) and striking out with only Marvin the Paranoid Android, Eddie the shipboard computer, a cloned archaeologist named Lintilla, a bunch of appliances with Genuine People Personalities, and a rather battered copy of the Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy for companionship.

In the novels and the new (series 3 and onwards) radio series (the latter of which dismisses the events of the second radio series as one of Zaphod&#x27;s &quot;psychotic episodes&quot;), Ford and Arthur escape prehistoric Earth via an eddy in the space-time continuum and a time-travelling Chesterfield sofa that deposits them in the middle of Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground at the climax of the final (in more ways than one, it turns out) match in the Ashes series, the day before the destruction of Earth by the Vogons. Having escaped the destruction of Earth once more and survived further adventures, Arthur eventually finds himself once more back on Earth (or rather an alternative Earth founded by the Dolphins to save the human race from extinction). Here he falls in love with a woman named Fenchurch and seems set to live happily ever after – at least until the following – and final – novel, &quot;Mostly Harmless&quot;. By the end of this fifth novel, Earth and all of its possible permutations and alternate versions are destroyed once and for all, and everybody dies, at least as far as the novel goes. However, it is subtly hinted that Arthur, his friends, and a few Earths might have survived.

In the Quintessential Phase of the radio series, there are multiple alternative endings after the final destruction of all possible Earths. The final ending here consists of the Babel fish carried by Arthur, Trillian, Ford, and Random having a sense for self-preservation, i.e. at the last minute they teleport the person they are inhabiting, and anyone nearby (namely Tricia McMillan), to safety. They are teleported to Milliways where they meet up with Zaphod, both Trillians merge, leaving her with her British accent but her blonde-American hair. Marvin has been rebuilt as his warranty has yet to expire and is parking cars at Milliways again (he has been promoted, he remarks; he now has his own bucket). Finally, they meet up with Fenchurch again who was teleported to Milliways after we last saw her in the Quandary Phase and has been working as a waitress there, waiting for Arthur. They all settle in together, leaving the series on an upbeat note and allowing for further adventures.

In the latest book, &quot;And Another Thing...&quot;, it is revealed that there are other Arthur Dents in the different dimensions of the book series, but they are all deceased, due to various mishaps of fate, so that only the Arthur who was rescued from Earth remains. One briefly appears in the book, wearing Arthur&#x27;s traditional dressing gown and slippers, and is destroyed with the rest of Earth by the Grebulons. Ford almost sees him, but searches for a drink and misses him being vaporized.

==Arthur&#x27;s &quot;death&quot;==
Arthur dies in the fifth installment of the book series, &quot;Mostly Harmless&quot;, in a club called Beta (owned by Stavro Mueller) when the Earth and all its duplicates are seemingly destroyed by the Grebulons. Adams frequently expressed his disdain for this ending in retrospect, claiming that it was too depressing and came about as the result of him having a bad year.

In the radio series, Arthur is saved by the Babel Fish, which can teleport itself, along with its carrier, out of danger. Arthur and the others who died in the books are instead teleported by their Babel Fishes to somewhere safer than Sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha. This is also used in Trillian&#x27;s dream sequence, as the reason for their escape.

In &quot;And Another Thing...&quot;, written by Eoin Colfer, Arthur is put into a dream sequence (presumably referring to the epilogue of the radio series) and then frozen in time by the &quot;Guide&quot; Mk.2, allowing him to experience decades of life on a peaceful beach. The &quot;Guide&quot;&#x27;s batteries soon run out, however, so all the main characters are re-awakened on the exploding Earth, at the exact point where &quot;Mostly Harmless&quot; left off. Zaphod then rescues them in the &quot;Heart of Gold&quot;. All alternative Arthurs are killed. In the end, Arthur travels through hyperspace on an interstellar passenger ship; he looks to the seat next to him to find Fenchurch sitting there talking to him, but he fades out of her dimension and into a new one. Materializing on the beach from his dream, he looks into the sky and discovers that the Vogons are on their way to destroy this planet.

<doc id="159980" wikidata="Q1779547" url="?curid=159980" title="Max Keeble's Big Move">
<text>Max Keeble&#x27;s Big Move is a 2001 American comedy film directed by Tim Hill, written by David L. Watts, James Greer, Jonathan Bernstein and Mark Blackwell and starring Alex D. Linz, Larry Miller, Jamie Kennedy, Nora Dunn, and Robert Carradine. The plot follows the eponymous Max and his friends, who begin going to junior high school only to learn Max and his family will soon move elsewhere; Max resolves to get even with those who bully him and his friends before he leaves since he will not remain long enough to face discipline for anything he does.

The film was released in the United States on October 5, 2001, by Walt Disney Pictures. It received mixed reviews from critics and was a box office bomb that grossed $18 million against its $25 million budget.

==Plot==
Max Keeble is a paperboy who starts his first day of middle school. Max is antagonized by the corrupt megalomaniac and tyrannical school principal, Elliot T. Jindrake; school bullies Troy McGinty and Dobbs; and the Evil Ice Cream Man. Max also learns that an animal shelter he visits next to the school is being closed to build Jindrake&#x27;s opulent football stadium. One day, Max&#x27;s father reveals that because of his job, he and the family will be relocating to Chicago for his boss, because he is unable to stand up for himself. Max realizes that he is free to do whatever he wants to his tormentors, facing no consequences because he will be gone by then.

Enlisting his equally socially outcast friends Robe and Megan, Max sets up a variety of pranks. These include traumatizing Troy by playing the main theme song of the children&#x27;s television show &quot;MacGoogles the Highlander Frog&quot; (which frightened him as a child), then trapping him in the gym with someone wearing a MacGoogles costume; instigating a fight between Dobbs and the Evil Ice Cream Man by stealing the coolant coil for the ice cream truck and Dobbs&#x27; handheld device; and ruining Jindrake&#x27;s chances of becoming successor to the current superintendent, Bobby &quot;Crazy Legs&quot; Knebworth (an alumnus who was a star football player for the school) by planting animal pheromones within his breath spray, instigating a food fight in the cafeteria in view of Superintendent Knebworth, and later by sabotaging his TV announcements by placing a cardboard cutout of Max mocking him.

After Max&#x27;s missions are completed, Jindrake, Troy and Dobbs somehow find out that Max was behind all the pranks he pulled off. Later, Max ends up ditching Robe and Megan&#x27;s going-away party by accepting an invitation to a milkshake party hosted by his crush Jenna, causing a falling-out. Robe tells Max how Megan really feels about him, and then walks away telling Max that he hopes he enjoys his new life in Chicago. Max then calls Megan&#x27;s house, telling her mom to relay to her that he is sorry for what happened. Taking Max&#x27;s earlier advice to heart, Max&#x27;s dad announces that he quit his job and will start his own business, meaning that Max is not moving after all. Max freaks out at this news, and learns that other students at his school are suffering because of his actions.

Max confronts Jindrake, Troy, and Dobbs one final time, and with the help of other students at his school, Max eventually defeats Troy and Dobbs for good by throwing them into the dumpster with his schoolmates&#x27; help and stops Jindrake from demolishing the animal shelter. Jindrake is dismissed from his job as principal and faces criminal charges for manipulating the school budget in order to build his stadium after Max tricked him into publicly admitting to his crimes earlier.

<doc id="159981" wikidata="Q518231" url="?curid=159981" title="Samuel Barnett (reformer)">
<text>Samuel Augustus Barnett (8 February 1844 – 17 June 1913) was a Church of England cleric and social reformer who was particularly associated with the establishment of the first university settlement, Toynbee Hall, in east London in 1884. He is often referred to as Canon Barnett, having served as Canon of Westminster Abbey from 1906 until his death.

==Early life==
Samuel Augustus Barnett was born in Bristol, the elder son of Francis Augustus Barnett, an iron manufacturer. After a private education by tutors he entered Wadham College, Oxford, in 1862, leaving in 1866, whereafter he visited the United States. In the following year he was ordained as a deacon and became the curate of St Mary&#x27;s, Bryanston Square before being ordained as a priest in 1868.

In 1873, he married Henrietta Octavia Weston Rowland (1851–1936), heiress, social reformer and author, later Dame Henrietta Barnett, DBE, who had been a co-worker of Octavia Hill. Both were social reformers and philanthropists with broad cultural interests. Later that year, the Barnetts moved to the impoverished Whitechapel parish of St. Jude&#x27;s intent on improving social conditions in one of London&#x27;s worst slums.

==Social reform==

The East End area was notorious for its squalor and overcrowded housing conditions, as well as prostitution and other criminal activities. The Barnetts worked hard for the poor of their parish—opening evening schools for adults, providing them with music and entertainment, and serving on the local board of guardians and on the managing committees of schools. Barnett discouraged outdoor relief believing it fostered the pauperisation of the neighbourhood. At the same time, the Barnetts helped improve conditions of indoor relief, and coordinated the various charities by co-operation with the Charity Organization Society and the parish board of guardians.
In 1875 Balliol historian Arnold Toynbee paid the first of many visits to Whitechapel. In 1877, Barnett, who kept in constant touch with Oxford, formed a small committee, over which he presided, to consider the organisation of university extension in London. His chief assistants were Leonard Montefiore, a young Oxford man, and Frederick Rogers, a member of the Vellum (Account Book) Binders&#x27; Trade Society.

The committee received influential support, and in October four courses of lectures, one by Dr Samuel Rawson Gardiner on English history, were given in Whitechapel. The Barnetts were associated with the foundation of the East End Dwellings Company, which built many model dwellings in the East End from 1888, with the establishment of the Children&#x27;s Country Holiday Fund (1884) and the annual loan exhibitions of fine art at the Whitechapel gallery.

==University settlements==

In 1884 an article by Henrietta Barnett in &quot;Nineteenth Century&quot; discussed the question of university settlements – places where richer students could live alongside, learn about and contribute to the welfare of much poorer people – in Barnett&#x27;s words: &#x27;to learn as much as to teach; to receive as much to give&#x27;. This resulted in the formation of the University Settlements Association. Toynbee Hall, named after the recently deceased historian Arnold Toynbee, was built shortly afterwards, and Barnett became its first Warden. In 1888 American reformer Jane Addams visited the settlement, and was inspired to create similar facilities in the United States—the first Hull House opening in Chicago a year later.

Barnett was a select preacher at Oxford (1895–97), and at Cambridge in 1900. In 1893 he received a canonry in Bristol Cathedral, but retained his wardenship of Toynbee Hall, while relinquishing the living of St. Jude&#x27;s. In June 1906 he was given a canonry at Westminster, and when in December he resigned the wardenship of Toynbee Hall the position of president was created so that he might retain his home there.

==Hampstead Garden Suburb==

The Barnetts also became known for their involvement in the Hampstead Garden Suburb. This arose after the activist couple acquired a weekend home at Spaniard&#x27;s End in the Hampstead area of north-west London. The Barnetts worked to protect part of nearby Hampstead Heath from development by Eton College, as well as beginning in 1904 established trusts which bought 243 acres of land along the newly opened Northern line extension to Golders Green. Henrietta Barnett broke ground for the development on her 56th birthday, and while it never was completed to the plan of architects Raymond Unwin and Sir Edwin Lutyens, it achieved worldwide acclaim.

==Westminster Abbey==

In 1906 Barnett moved from Canon of Bristol Cathedral to Canon of Westminster Abbey. At the coronation of King George V in 1911, Barnett&#x27;s role was to carry the royal orb.

In 1913 he was elevated to Sub-Dean. His health had begun to fail, suffering several heart attacks prior to the coronation and one after. In his final days he suffered greatly from insomnia. A memorial to his memory lies on the north aisle of the Choir.

==Legacy==

Samuel Barnett died in 1913 at 69 Kings Esplanade in Hove, and is buried with his wife in the churchyard at St Helen&#x27;s Church, Hangleton, East Sussex.

As a memorial, his friend Sir Alfred Yarrow dedicated a charitable building in Hampstead Garden Suburb in his name in 1916: the Barnett Homestead. A Greater London Council blue plaque unveiled in 1983 on Heath End House on Spaniards Road, Hampstead commemorates Barnett and his wife. In 1914, Henrietta Barnett founded Barnett House at Oxford in his memory, and it became the Department of Social Policy and Intervention, University of Oxford. There is a Samuel Barnett Close in Filwood Park, Bristol.

The Barnetts jointly wrote &quot;Practicable Socialism&quot; (1888; 2nd ed. 1894).

Samuel is remembered (with Henrietta) in the Church of England with a commemoration on 17 June.

<doc id="159987" wikidata="Q1768161" url="?curid=159987" title="Abraham in Islam">
<text>Abraham was a prophet and messenger of God according to Islam, and an ancestor to the Ishmaelite Arabs and Israelites. Abraham plays a prominent role as an example of faith in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. In Muslim belief, Abraham fulfilled all the commandments and trials wherein God nurtured him throughout his lifetime. As a result of his unwavering faith in God, Abraham was promised by God to be a leader to all the nations of the world. The Quran extols Abraham as a model, an exemplar, obedient and not an idolater. In this sense, Abraham has been described as representing &quot;primordial man in universal surrender to the Divine Reality before its fragmentation into religions separated from each other by differences in form&quot;. Muslims believe that the Kaaba in Mecca was built by Abraham and his son Ishmael as the first house of worship on earth. The Islamic holy day &#x27;Eid ul-Adha is celebrated in commemoration of Abraham&#x27;s willingness to sacrifice his son on God&#x27;s command, as well as the end of the Hajj pilgrimage to the Kaaba.

Muslims believe that Abraham became the leader of the righteous in his time and that it was through him that Adnanite-Arabs and Israelites came. Abraham, in the belief of Islam, was instrumental in cleansing the world of idolatry at the time. Paganism was cleared out by Abraham in both the Arabian peninsula and Canaan. He spiritually purified both places as well as physically sanctifying the houses of worship. Abraham and Isma&#x27;il (Ishmael) further established the rites of pilgrimage, or &quot;Ḥajj&quot; (&#x27;Pilgrimage&#x27;), which are still followed by Muslims today. Muslims maintain that Abraham further asked God to bless both the lines of his progeny, of Isma&#x27;il and Isḥaq (Isaac), and to keep all of his descendants in the protection of God.

== In the Quran==

There are numerous references to Abraham in the Quran, including, twice, to the Scrolls of Abraham; in the latter passage, it is mentioned that Abraham &quot;fulfilled his engagements?-&quot;, a reference to all the trials that Abraham had succeeded in. In a whole series of chapters, the Qur&#x27;an relates how Abraham preached to his community as a youth and how he specifically told his father, named Azar, to leave idol-worship and come to the worship of God. Some passages of the Quran, meanwhile, deal with the story of how God sent angels to Abraham with the announcement of the punishment to be imposed upon Lot&#x27;s people in Sodom and Gomorrah. Other verses mention the near-sacrifice of Abraham&#x27;s son, whose name is not given but is presumed to be Ishmael as the following verses mention the birth of Isaac. The Quran also repeatedly establishes Abraham&#x27;s role as patriarch and mentions numerous important descendants who came through his lineage, including Isaac, Jacob and Ishmael. In the later chapters of the Quran, Abraham&#x27;s role becomes yet more prominent. The Quran mentions that Abraham and Ishmael were the reformers who set up the Ka‘bah in Mecca as a center of pilgrimage for monotheism The Quran consistently refers to Islam as &quot;the Religion of Abraham&quot; (&quot;millat Ibrahim&quot;) and Abraham is given a title as &quot;Hanif&quot; (&quot;The Pure&quot;, &quot;true in Faith&quot; or &quot;upright man&quot;). The Quran also mentions Abraham as one whom God took as a friend (&quot;Khalil&quot;), hence Abraham&#x27;s title in Islam, &quot;Khalil-Allah&quot; (&quot;Friend of God&quot;). The term is considered by some to be a derivation of the patriarch&#x27;s title, &quot;Qal El&quot;. Other instances in the Quran which are described in a concise manner are the rescue of Abraham from the fire into which he was thrown by his people&#x27;; his pleading for his father; his quarrel with an unrighteous and powerful king and the miracle of the dead birds.

All these events and more have been discussed with more details in Muslim tradition, and especially in the &quot;Stories of the Prophets&quot; and works of universal Islamic theology. Certain episodes from the life of Abraham have been more heavily detailed in Islamic text, such as the arguments between Abraham and the evil king, Nimrod, the near-sacrifice of his son, and the story of Hagar and Ishmael, which Muslims commemorate when performing pilgrimage in Mecca. An important Islamic religious holiday, Eid al-Adha, commemorates Abraham&#x27;s willingness to sacrifice his son Ishmael as an act of obedience to God, before God intervened to provide him with a sheep to sacrifice instead. In some cases, some believe these legends in Islamic text may have influenced later Jewish tradition.

== Biography in Islamic scripture ==
===Youth===

Ibrahim was born in a house of idolaters in the ancient city of Ur of the Chaldees, likely the place called &#x27;Ur&#x27; in present-day Iraq, in which case, the idolaters would have been practitioners of the hypothesized Ancient Mesopotamian religion. His father Azar was a well-known idol-sculptor that his people worshiped. As a young child, Ibrahim used to watch his father sculpting these idols from stones or wood. When his father was finished with them, Ibrahim would ask his father why they could not move or respond to any request and then would mock them; therefore, his father would always scold him for not following his ancestors&#x27; rituals and mocking their idols.

Despite his opposition to idolatry, his father Azar would still send Ibrahim to sell his idols in the marketplace. During one of the many festivals that would take place in the city, the people would gather in their temple and place offerings of food before their idols. Ur&#x27;s most prominent temple is the Great Ziggurat, which can be seen today. Ibrahim would ask them, &quot;What are you worshipping? Do these idols hear when you call them? Can they help you or hurt you?&quot; The people would reply, &quot;It is the way of our forefathers.&quot; Ibrahim declared &quot;I am sick of your gods! Truly I am their enemy.&quot;

===The great fire===
The decision to have Abraham burned at the stake was affirmed by the temple priests and the king of Babylon, Nimrod. The news spread like fire in the kingdom and people were coming from all places to watch the execution. A huge pit was dug up and a large quantity of wood was piled up. Then the biggest fire people ever witnessed was lit. The flames were so high up in the sky that even the birds could not fly over it for fear of being burnt themselves. Ibrahim&#x27;s hands and feet were chained, and he was put in a catapult, ready to be thrown in. During this time, Angel Gabriel came to him and said: &quot;O Abraham! Is there anything you wish for?&quot; Abraham could have asked to be saved from the fire or to be taken away, but Ibrahim replied, &quot;God is sufficient for me, He is the best disposer of my affairs.&quot; The catapult was released and Ibrahim was thrown into the fire. God then gave an order to the fire, &quot;O fire! Be coolness and safety for Ibrahim.&quot; A miracle occurred, the fire obeyed and burned only his chains. Abraham came out from it as if he was coming out from a garden, peaceful, his face illuminated, and not a trace of smoke on his clothes. People watched in shock and exclaimed: &quot;Amazing! Abraham&#x27;s God has saved him from the fire!&quot;

===Confrontation with Nimrod===
The Quran discusses a very short conversation between an unrighteous ruler and Abraham. Although the king in the Quran is unnamed, and this fact has been recognized as being least important in the narrative, outside of the Quran, namely in some of the &quot;tafasir&quot;, this king has been suggested to be Nimrod. This Tafsir by Ibn Kathir, a 14th-century scholar, has many embellishments in the narrative like Nimrod claiming divinity for himself. The Tafsir describes Nimrod&#x27;s quarrel with Ibrahim, how he (Nimrod) became extremely angry and in his &#x27;utter disbelief and arrant rebellion&#x27; became a tyrant.

According to Romano-Jewish historian Flavius Josephus, Nimrod was a man who set his will against that of God. Nimrod proclaimed himself as a living god and was worshipped as such by his subjects. Nimrod&#x27;s consort Semiramis was also worshipped as a goddess at his side. Before Abraham was born, a portent in the stars tells Nimrod and his astrologers of the impending birth of Abraham, who would put an end to idolatry. Nimrod therefore orders the killing of all newborn babies. However, Abraham&#x27;s mother escapes into the fields and gives birth secretly. Flavius Josephus mentions that Abraham confronts Nimrod and tells him face-to-face to cease his idolatry, whereupon Nimrod orders him burned at the stake. Nimrod has his subjects gather enough wood so as to burn Abraham in the biggest fire the world had ever seen. Yet when the fire is lit and Abraham is thrown into it, Abraham walks out unscathed. In Islam, it is debated whether the decision to have Ibrahim burned at the stake came from Nimrod and the temple priests or whether the people themselves became vigilantes and hatched the plan to have him burned at the stake. According to Muslim commentators, after Abraham survived the great fire, notoriety in society grew bigger after this event. Nimrod, who was the King of Babylon felt that his throne was in danger, and that he was losing power because upon witnessing Ibrahim coming out of the fire unharmed, a large part of society started believing in God and Abraham being a prophet of God. Up until this point, Nimrod was pretending that he himself was a god. Nimrod wanted to debate with him and show his people that he, the king is indeed the god and that Ibrahim was a liar. Nimrod asked Ibrahim, &quot;What can your God do that I cannot?&quot; Ibrahim replied, &quot;My Lord is He who gives life and death.&quot; Nimrod then shouted, &quot;I give life and death! I can bring a person from the street and have him executed, and I can grant my pardon to a person who was sentenced to death and save his life.&quot; Abraham replied, &quot;Well, my lord God makes the sun rise from the East. Can you make it rise from the West?&quot; Nimrod was confounded. He was beaten at his own game, on his own territory and in front of his own people. Abraham left him there speechless and went back to his mission of calling people to worship God.

This event has been noted as particularly important because, in the Muslim perspective, it almost foreshadowed the prophetic careers of future prophets, most significantly the career of Moses. Abraham&#x27;s quarrel with the king has been interpreted by some to be a precursor to Moses&#x27;s preaching to Pharaoh. Just as the ruler who argued against Abraham claimed divinity for himself, so did the Pharaoh of the Exodus, who refused to hear the call of Moses and perished in the Red Sea. In this particular incident, scholars have further commented on Abraham&#x27;s wisdom in employing &quot;rational, wise and target-oriented&quot; speech, as opposed to pointless arguments.

Abraham, in the eyes of many Muslims, also symbolized the highest moral values essential to any person. The Qur&#x27;an details the account of the angels coming to Abraham to tell him of the birth of Ismael. It says that, as soon as Abraham saw the messengers, he &quot;hastened to entertain them with a roasted calf.&quot; This action has been interpreted by all the scholars as exemplary; many scholars have commentated upon this one action, saying that it symbolizes Abraham&#x27;s exceedingly high moral level and thus is a model for how men should act in a similar situation. This incident has only further heightened the &quot;compassionate&quot; character of Abraham in Muslim theology.

===Sacrifice===

The classical Quranic exegete and historian Tabari offered two versions, whom Abraham was ordered to sacrifice. According to the first strand, Abraham wished for a righteous son, whereupon an angel appeared to him informing him, that he will get a righteous son, but when he was born and reached puberty, he must be sacrificed for God. Later, the angel appeared to Hagar to inform her about the upcoming child. When Ishmael was grown, someone appeared to Abraham, invites him to keep his vow.
 When Ishmael was grown, someone appeared to Abraham in a dream and said to him: &quot;Keep your vow which you made! God bestowed upon you a boy by Hagar so that you may sacrifice him&quot; So he said to Ishmael: &quot;Let us go offer a sacrifice to God!&quot; So he took a knife and some rope and went with him until they reached a place in the mountains. The boy said to him: &quot;Oh father! Where is your sacrifice?&quot; He replied: &quot;Oh my son, I saw in a dream, that I will slaughter you. So pay attention to what you see&quot;. He said, &quot;Oh my father, do what you have been commanded; you will find me, Insha-Allah (if God wills), one of the patient&quot;. Ishmael then said to him: &quot;Make tight my bonds, so that I will not struggle to pull back your clothes so that none of my blood will be shed on them for Hagar will see it and be grieved. Hurry! Pass the knife over my throat so that death will be easy for me. When you come to Hagar, greet her&#x27;. Abraham began to approach him and, while crying, tied him up. Ishmael too was crying such that the tears gathered by the cheek of Ishmael. He then drew the knife along his throat but the knife did not cut, for God had placed a sheet of copper on the throat of Ishmael. When he saw that, he turned him on his forehead and nicked him on the back of the head just as God has said in Quran : &quot;When they had both submitted and he flung on his forehead&quot;, that is they had submitted the affair to God. A voice called out: &#x27;Abraham, you have fulfilled the vision!&quot; He turned around and behold, there was a ram. He took it and released his son and he bent over his son saying: &quot;Oh my son, today you have been given to me&quot;. That comes in God&#x27;s saying in Quran : &quot;We ransomed him with a great sacrifice&quot;.

The second strand, provided by Tabari, states that Abraham was about to sacrifice his son Ishmael, and Iblis appeared in form of a man to prevent the sacrifice.
 Iblis (Satan), who had taken on the form of a man, said: &quot;Where are you going, O Shaikh?&quot; He replied: &quot; I am going to these mountains because I must do something there&#x27;. Iblis said: &quot;By God, I have seen that Shaytan has come to you in a dream and ordered you to slaughter this little son of yours. And you intend to do that slaughtering!&quot; Thereupon Abraham recognized him and said: &quot;Get away from me, enemy of God! By God, I will most certainly continue to do what my Lord has commanded&quot;. Iblis, the enemy of God, gave up on Abraham but then he encountered Ishmael, who was behind Abraham carrying the wood and the large knife. He said to him: &quot;O young man, do you realize where your father is taking you?&quot; He said: &quot;To gather wood for our family from the mountains&quot;. He replied: &quot;By God, his actual intention is to sacrifice you!&quot; He said: &quot;Why?!&quot; Iblis replied: &quot;He claims that his Lord has ordered him to do so!&quot; Ishmael replied: &quot;He must do what his Lord commands, absolutely!&quot; When the young man had rebuffed him, Iblis went to Hagar, the mother of Ishmael who was still at home. Iblis said to her: &quot;Oh mother of Ishmael! Do you realize where Abraham is going with Ishmael?&quot; She replied: &quot;They have gone to gather wood for us in the mountains&quot;. He said: &quot;He has actually gone in order to sacrifice him!&quot; She replied: &quot;It cannot be! He is too kind and too loving towards him to do that!&quot; Iblis said: &quot;He claims that God has ordered him to do that!&quot; Hagar said: &quot;If his Lord has ordered him to do that then he must submit to the command of God!&quot; So the enemy of God returned exasperated at not being able to influence the family of Abraham as he wished.

This great sacrifice denotes the importance of the ram that replaced Ibraheem&#x27;s son. Tafsir ibn Kathir records Ibn Abbas&#x27; explanation of the verse, according to Muhammad&#x27;s teachings. The explanation is as follows:
The Tafsir further goes on to say that the ram&#x27;s horns were preserved until the time of Muhammad:
 Imam Ahmad recorded that Safiyyah bint Shaybah said, &quot;A woman from Bani Sulaym, who was the midwife of most of the people in our household, told me that the Messenger of God sent for `Uthman bin Talhah, may God be pleased with him.&quot; On one occasion she said, &quot;I asked `Uthman, `Why did the Prophet call you&#x27; He said, `The Messenger of God said to me, I saw the horns of the ram when I entered the House (i.e., the Ka`bah), and I forgot to tell you to cover them up; cover them up, for there should not be anything in the House which could distract the worshipper.)&quot;&#x27; Sufyan said, &quot;The horns of the ram remained hanging in the House until it was burned, and they were burned too.&quot; The Quraysh had inherited the horns of the ram that Abraham sacrificed, and they had been passed down from generation to generation, until the Messenger of God was sent. And God knows best.

From that day onwards, every Eid al-Adha once a year Muslims around the world slaughter an animal to commemorate Abraham&#x27;s sacrifice and to remind themselves of self-abnegation in the way of God, and they would share the meat among friends, family, the poor and the needy. This is called Qurbani (&quot;sacrifice&quot;).

===Miracles===
Abraham encountered several miracles of God during his lifetime. The Quran records a few main miracles, although different interpretations have been attributed to the passages. Some of the miracles recorded in the Quran are:
* Abraham was shown the kingdom of the Heavens and the Earth.
* Abraham and the miracle of the birds.
* Abraham was thrown into a fire, which became &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;peaceful&quot; for him.
The first passage has been interpreted both literally, allegorically, and otherwise. Although some commentators feel that this passage referred to a physical miracle, where Abraham was physically shown the entire kingdom of Heaven (Jannah), others have felt that it refers to the spiritual understanding of Abraham; these latter scholars maintain that the Chaldeans were skilled in the observance of the stars, but Abraham, who lived amongst them, saw beyond the physical world and into a higher spiritual realm. The second passage has one mainstream interpretation amongst the Quranic commentators, that Abraham took four birds and cut them up, placing pieces of each on nearby hills; when he called out to them, each piece joined and four birds flew back to Abraham. This miracle, as told by the Quranic passage, was a demonstration by God to show Abraham how God gave life to the dead. As the physical cutting of the birds is not implied in the passage, some commentators have offered alternative interpretations, but all maintain that the miracle was for the same demonstrative purpose to show Abraham the power God has to raise the dead to life. The third passage has also been interpreted both literally and metaphorically, or in some cases both. Commentators state that the &#x27;fire&#x27; refers to the main aspects. They maintained that, firstly, the fire referred to the physical flame, from which Abraham was saved unharmed. The commentators further stated that, secondly, the fire referred to the &#x27;fire of persecution&#x27;, from which Abraham was saved, as he left his people after this with his wife Sarah and his nephew Lot.

==Title==
Abraham is given the title &quot;Khalilullah&quot; in Islam. The Quran says:

This particular title of Abraham is so famous in Muslim culture and tradition that, in the areas in and around Mecca, Abraham is often referred to solely as &quot;The Friend&quot;. This title of &quot;Friend of God&quot; is not exclusive to Islamic theology. Although the other religious traditions do not stress upon it, Abraham is called a &quot;Friend of God&quot; in the second Book of Chronicles and the Book of Isaiah in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) as well as in the New Testament.

==Relationship with Islamic shrines==
One of Abraham&#x27;s most important features in Islamic theology is his role as the constructor of the Kaaba. Although tradition recounts that Adam constructed the original Kaaba, which was demolished by the Great Flood at the time of Noah, Abraham is believed to have rebuilt it in its original form. The Quran, in the Muslim perspective, merely confirms or reinforces the laws of pilgrimage. The rites were instituted by Abraham and for all Muslims, as they perform the pilgrimage, the event is a way to return to the perfection of Abraham&#x27;s faith. Just as Medina is referred to as the &quot;City of the Prophet [Muhammad]&quot; or simply the &quot;City of Muhammad&quot;, Mecca is frequently cited as the &quot;City of Abraham&quot;, because Abraham&#x27;s reformation of the monotheistic faith is believed to have taken place in Mecca. Likewise, Islamic belief links the original sanctuary of Al-Aqsa in the Old City of Jerusalem to Abraham.

==&quot;Suhuf&quot;==

The Quran refers to certain Scrolls of Abraham. All Muslim scholars have generally agreed that no scrolls of Abraham survive, and therefore this is a reference to a lost body of scripture. The Scrolls of Abraham are understood by Muslims to refer to certain revelations Abraham received, which he would have then transmitted to writing. The exact contents of the revelation are not described in the Qur&#x27;an.

The 87th chapter of the Quran, Surah al-Ala, concludes by saying the subject matter of the sura has been in the earlier scriptures of Abraham and Moses. It is slightly indicative of what were in the previous scriptures, according to Islam:
&quot;Surah an-Najm&quot; mentions some more subject matters of the earlier scriptures of Abraham and Musa (Moses):
Yet some scholars suggested it to be a reference to the &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot;, as Jewish tradition generally ascribed its authorship to Abraham. Other scholars, however, wrote of a certain &quot;Testament of Abraham&quot;, which they explained was available at the time of Muhammad.

The Quran contains numerous references to Abraham, his life, prayers, and traditions and has a dedicated chapter named Ibrahim. On a relevant note, surah al-Kahf was revealed as an answer from God to the Jews who inquired of Muhammad about past events. Here God directly instructed Muhammad in surah Al-Kahf, not to consult the Jews for verifying the three stories about which they inquired.

The reason being God declaring He Himself is relating what needs to be verified in another verse of al-Kahf:
Regarding consultation with the People of the Book, it is also narrated by Abu Hurairah in hadith:

Therefore, relating to any ascription of the Scrolls of Abraham by the people of the book is not required.

==Significance as a patriarch==

Abraham is also extremely important as a leader of Islam and as a patriarch of the Islamic faith. Muslims recognize Abraham as the ancestor through whom many other prophets and saints (&quot;Wali&quot;) came, including Moses, Jesus (Isa) and Muhammad. The Quran lists, in the sixth chapter, some of the greatest figures to have through Abraham&#x27;s progeny:
Abraham&#x27;s narrative in the Quran indirectly refers to his role as one of the great patriarchs. The Quran says that God made Abraham &quot;an Imam to the Nations&quot; and father to Muslims, and his narrative records him praying for his offspring. The Quran further states that Abraham&#x27;s descendants were given &quot;the Book and Wisdom&quot;, and this fact is reinforced in a verse which states that Abraham&#x27;s family was one of those in which the gift of prophecy was established as a generic trait. The Quran emphasizes upon Abraham&#x27;s significance as it states that Abraham&#x27;s family, Noah, Adam and the family of Amram were the four selected by God above all the worlds. As a result of his significance as a patriarch, Abraham is sometimes given the title &quot;Father of the Prophets.&quot; Of Abraham&#x27;s immediate sons, the Quran repeatedly establishes the gifts God bestowed upon them. Ishmael, along with Elisha and Dhul-Kifl (possibly Ezekiel), is regarded as being &quot;of the Company of the Good.&quot; and one of the men who was given &quot;favour above the nations.&quot; In addition, Ishmael is described as being &quot;true to what he promised, and he was a messenger (and) a prophet.&quot; Likewise, the Quran says of Isaac that he was &quot;of the company of the Elect and the Good.&quot; and was &quot;a prophet,- one of the Righteous.&quot; and further describes him as &quot;of Power and Vision.&quot;

==Burial place==
Muslims believe that Abraham was buried, along with his wife Sarah, at the Cave of the Patriarchs in the Old City of Hebron, the West Bank. Known to Muslims as the &quot;Sanctuary of Abraham&quot; it is also thought to be the burial site of his son Isaac, his wife Rebecca, their son Jacob, and his wife Leah.

<text>Richard Barnfield (baptized 29 June 1574 – 1620) was an English poet. His relationship with William Shakespeare has long made him interesting to scholars. It has been suggested that he was the &quot;rival poet&quot; mentioned in Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets.

== Early life ==
Barnfield was born at the home of his maternal grandparents in Norbury, Staffordshire, where he was baptized on 29 June 1574. He was the son of Richard Barnfield, gentleman, and Mary Skrymsher (1552–1581).

He was brought up in Shropshire at The Manor House in Edgmond, his upbringing supervised by his aunt Elizabeth Skrymsher after his mother died when Barnfield was six years old.

In November 1589, Barnfield matriculated at Brasenose College, Oxford, and took his degree in February 1592. He performed the exercise for his master&#x27;s gown, but seems to have left the university abruptly, without proceeding to the M.A. It is conjectured that he came up to London in 1593, and became acquainted with Watson, Drayton, and perhaps with Edmund Spenser. The death of Sir Philip Sidney had occurred while Barnfield was still a school-boy, but it seems to have strongly affected his imagination and to have inspired some of his earliest verses.

==Publications==
In November 1594, in his twenty-first year, Barnfield published anonymously his first work, &quot;The Affectionate Shepherd&quot;, dedicated with familiar devotion to Penelope Rich, Lady Rich. This was a sort of florid romance, in two books of six-line stanzas, in the manner of Lodge and Shakespeare, dealing at large with the complaint of Daphnis for the love of Ganymede. As the author expressly admitted later, it was an expansion or paraphrase of Virgil&#x27;s second eclogue &quot;Formosum pastor Corydon ardebat Alexin&quot;.

Although the poem was successful, it did not pass without censure from the moral point of view because of its openly homosexual content. Two months later, in January 1595, Barnfield published his second volume, &quot;Cynthia, with certain Sonnets, and the legend of Cassandra&quot;, and this time signed the preface, which was dedicated, in terms which imply close personal relations, to William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby. In the preface Barnfield distances himself from the homoeroticism of his previous work, writing that some readers &quot;did interpret The Affectionate Shepherd otherwise than in truth I meant, touching the subject thereof, to wit, the love of a shepherd to a boy&quot;. He excuses himself by saying he was imitating Virgil. The new collection, however, also contained poems which were &quot;explicitly and unashamedly homoerotic, full of physical desire&quot;, in the words of critics Stanley Wells and Paul Edmondson. The book exemplifies the earliest study both of Spenser and Shakespeare. &quot;Cynthia&quot; itself, a panegyric on Queen Elizabeth, is written in the Spenserian stanza, of which it is probably the earliest example extant outside &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;.

In 1598, Barnfield published his third volume, &quot;The Encomion of Lady Pecunia&quot;, a poem in praise of money, followed by a sort of continuation, in the same six-line stanza, called &quot;The Complaint of Poetry for the Death of Liberality&quot;. In this volume there is already a decline in poetic quality. But an appendix of &quot;Poems in diverse Humours&quot; to this volume of 1598 presents some very interesting features. Here appears what seems to be the absolutely earliest praise of Shakespeare in a piece entitled &quot;A Remembrance of some English Poets&quot;, in which the still unrecognized author of &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; is celebrated by the side of Spenser, Daniel and Drayton. Here also are the sonnet, &quot;If Music and sweet Poetrie agree&quot;, and the ode beginning &quot;As it fell upon a day&quot;, which were once attributed to Shakespeare himself.

In 1599, &quot;The Passionate Pilgrim&quot; was published, with the words &quot;By W. Shakespeare&quot; on the title-page. It was long supposed that this attribution was correct, but Barnfield claimed one of the two pieces just mentioned, not only in 1598, but again in 1605. It is certain that both are his, and possibly other things in &quot;The Passionate Pilgrim&quot; also; Shakespeare&#x27;s share in the twenty poems of that miscellany being doubtless confined to the five short pieces which have been definitely identified as his.

He was for a long time neglected, but a less homophobic age has been kinder to his reputation. The sonnet sequence, in particular, can be read as one of the more obviously homoerotic sequences of the period. His work once passed for that of Shakespeare, albeit for only one ode. The &quot;Affectionate Shepheard&quot; and the &quot;Sonnets&quot; appeared as limited-edition artist&#x27;s books in 1998 and 2001, illustrated by Clive Hicks-Jenkins and produced by the Old Stile Press.

Barnfield&#x27;s &quot;Lady Pecunia&quot; and &quot;The Complaint of Poetry&quot; were used as sample texts by the early 17th-century phonetician Robert Robinson for his invented phonetic script.

==Later life==
In 1605, his &quot;Lady Pecunia&quot; was reprinted, and this was his last appearance as a man of letters. Some sources have claimed that Barnfield married and withdrew to his estate of Dorlestone (a locality in Staffordshire now known as Darlaston), where he thenceforth resided as a country gentleman. This is allegedly supported by records of a will for a Richard Barnfield, resident at Darlaston who was buried in the parish church of St Michaels, Stone, on 6 March 1627. However, it now appears that the Barnfield in question was in fact the poet&#x27;s father, the poet having died in 1620 in Shropshire.

<doc id="159990" wikidata="Q654405" url="?curid=159990" title="Manitoulin Island">
<text>Manitoulin Island ( ) is an island in Lake Huron, located within the borders of the Canadian province of Ontario, in the bioregion known as Laurentia. With an area of , it is the largest lake island in the world, large enough that it has over 100 lakes itself. In addition to the historic Anishinaabe and European settlement of the island, archaeological discoveries at Sheguiandah have demonstrated Paleo-Indian and Archaic cultures dating from 10,000 BC to 2,000 BC.

The current name of the island is the English version, via French, of the Ottawa or Ojibwe name &quot;Manidoowaaling&quot; (ᒪᓂᑝᐙᓕᓐᒃ), which means &quot;cave of the spirit&quot;. It was named for an underwater cave where a powerful spirit is said to live. By the 19th century, the Odawa &quot;l&quot; was pronounced as &quot;n&quot;. The same word with a newer pronunciation is used for the town &quot;Manitowaning&quot; (19th-century Odawa &quot;Manidoowaaning&quot;), which is located on Manitoulin Island near the underwater cave where legend has it that the spirit dwells. The modern Odawa name for Manitoulin Island is &quot;Mnidoo Mnis&quot;, meaning &quot;Spirit Island&quot;.

Manitoulin Island contains a number of lakes of its own. In order of size, its three most prominent lakes are Lake Manitou, Lake Kagawong and Lake Mindemoya. These three lakes in turn have islands within them, the largest of these being Lake Mindemoya&#x27;s Treasure Island, located in the centre of Mindemoya.

The island is the site of the administrative office of the band government of the Sheshegwaning First Nation.

==Geography and geology==
The island has an area of , making it the largest freshwater island in the world, the 174th largest island in the world and Canada&#x27;s 31st largest island.

The island separates the larger part of Lake Huron to its south and west from Georgian Bay to its east and the North Channel to the north.

Manitoulin Island itself has 108 freshwater lakes, some of which have their own islands; in turn several of these &quot;islands within islands&quot; have their own ponds. Lake Manitou, at , is the largest lake in a freshwater island in the world, and Treasure Island in Lake Mindemoya is the largest island in a lake on an island in a lake in the world. Motors are prohibited on boats on Nameless Lake.

The island also has four major rivers: the Kagawong, Manitou River, Blue Jay Creek in Michael&#x27;s Bay and Mindemoya rivers, which provide spawning grounds for salmon and trout.

The Manitoulin Streams Improvement Association was formed in 2000 and incorporated in 2007. The organization rehabilitates streams, rivers and creeks on Manitoulin Island to improve water quality and the fisheries resource. The Manitoulin Streams Improvement Association has conducted enhancement strategies for the Manitou River and Blue Jay Creek. The association has rehabilitated 17 major sites on the Manitou River and three major sites on Blue Jay Creek; it has completed work on Bass Lake Creek and Norton&#x27;s Creek. The organization plans to start work on the Mindemoya River in 2010.

Although culturally and politically considered part of Northern Ontario, the island is physiographically part of Southern Ontario, an &quot;eastward extension of the Interior Plains, a region characterized by low relief and sedimentary underpinnings&quot;. The island consists mainly of dolomite as it is a continuation of the Bruce Peninsula and Niagara Escarpment. This geological rock formation runs south into Niagara Falls and continues into New York. The &quot;Cup and Saucer Trail&quot;, which climbs the escarpment, provides a lookout over the island.

===Climate===
Manitoulin Island experiences a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;) with moderation from Lake Huron. The island experiences warm to hot summers and cool to cold winters. Manitoulin Island has a comparable climate to that of Hokkaido, Japan (hemiboreal climate), despite being on the same latitude as Lugano, Switzerland, which has a temperate climate. The island is characterized by long stretches of marked seasonal differences.

==Culture==

The island has two incorporated towns (Northeastern Manitoulin and the Islands and Gore Bay), eight townships (Assiginack, Billings, Burpee and Mills, Central Manitoulin, Dawson, Gordon/Barrie Island, Robinson and Tehkummah) and six Anishinaabe reserves (M&#x27;Chigeeng, Sheguiandah, Sheshegwaning, Aundeck Omni Kaning, Wiikwemkoong and Zhiibaahaasing).

During the summer, the population (12,600 permanent residents) on the island grows by more than a quarter due to tourists coming for boating and other activities in scenic surroundings. The island, along with several smaller neighbouring islands, constitutes the Manitoulin District census division of Ontario.

Manitoulin Island&#x27;s soil is relatively alkaline, which precludes the growth of common Northern Ontario flora such as blueberries, but allows for the island&#x27;s trademark hawberries. These berries are so distinctive that people born on the island are referred to as &quot;Haweaters&quot;. Each year on the August long weekend, the island hosts the Haweater Festival. The festival attracts numerous tourists; it features parades, firework shows, craft shows, and rural competitions such as horse pulls.

== Transportation ==
Year-round motor-vehicle access to the island is available via the one-lane Little Current Swing Bridge, which crosses the North Channel at Little Current. From late May to early October, a daily passenger-vehicle ferry, the (Ojibwe for &quot;Big Canoe&quot;), travels between Tobermory on the tip of the Bruce Peninsula and South Baymouth. Winter ice prevents ferry service during that season. There are two airports on the island. Gore Bay-Manitoulin Airport, and Manitoulin East Municipal Airport, which opened in 1988. Both allow small planes access to the island and Border Patrol clearance. 

== Demographics ==
, the population was 13,255.

Ethnic groups
*59% White (European-Canadian)
*40.6% Aboriginal (First Nations)
*0.4% Black (African-Canadian)

Religious groups

*17.7% other/none

The most common first languages on Manitoulin Island in 2016 were English (80.8%), Ojibwe (11.2%), French (2.8%), German (0.8%), and Odawa (0.8%).

== History ==

In 1952 archaeologist Thomas E. Lee discovered Sheguiandah on the island, a prehistoric site. During excavation, he found artefacts of the Paleo-Indian and Archaic periods, dating at least to 10,000 BC and possibly to 30,000 years ago. Additional studies were undertaken by a team he led from the National Museum of Canada in succeeding years. Popular interest in the finds was so high that it contributed to Ontario&#x27;s passing legislation in 1953 to protect its archaeological sites.

A team performed excavations again in the early 1990s, applying new methods of analysis from botany and other scientific disciplines. They concluded the site was at least 9500 years old, making it one of the most significant in Ontario.

Manitoulin means &quot;spirit island&quot; in &quot;Anishinaabemowin&quot; (Ojibwe language). The island is considered sacred by the Native Anishinaabe people, who identify as the &quot;People of the Three Fires.&quot; This loose confederation is made up of the Ojibwe, Odawa and Potawatomi tribes.

The North Channel was part of the route used by the French colonial voyageurs and coureurs des bois to reach Lake Superior. The first known European to settle on the island was Father Joseph Poncet, a French Jesuit, who set up a mission near Wiikwemkoong in 1648. The Jesuits called the island &quot;&quot;Isle de Ste-Marie&quot;.&quot; 

In addition, the Five Nations of the Iroquois began raiding the island and area to try to control the fur trade with the French. As part of what was called the Beaver Wars, the Iroquois drove the Anishinaabe people from the island by 1650. According to Anishinaabe oral tradition, to purify the island from disease, the people burned their settlements as they left. The island was mostly uninhabited for nearly 150 years.

Native people (Odawa, Ojibwe, Potawatomi) began to return to the island following the War of 1812 between Britain and the United States. They ceded the island to the British Crown in 1836; the government set aside the land as a refuge for Natives. In 1838 Jean-Baptiste Proulx re-established a Roman Catholic mission. The Jesuits took over the mission in 1845.

In 1862, the government opened up the island to settlement by non-Native people by the Manitoulin Island treaty. As the &quot;Wikwemikong&quot; chief did not accept this treaty, his people&#x27;s reserve was held back from being offered for development. That reserve remains unceded. On August 7, 1975, the Wikwemikong Unceded Indian Reserve reasserted their claim to sovereignty over the islands off the east end of Manitoulin Island, declaring, &quot;Wikwemikong Band has jurisdiction over its reservation lands and surrounding waters.&quot;

The province erected an Ontario Historical Plaque on the grounds of the Assiginack Museum to commemorate the Manitoulin Treaties&#x27; role in Ontario&#x27;s history.

<text>Microsoft Flight Simulator is a series of flight simulator programs for MS-DOS, Classic Mac OS, and Microsoft Windows operating systems. It was an early product in the Microsoft application portfolio and differed significantly from Microsoft&#x27;s other software, which was largely business-oriented. &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot; is Microsoft&#x27;s longest-running software product line, predating Windows by three years, and is one of the longest-running video game series of all time.

Bruce Artwick began the development of &quot;Flight Simulator&quot; in 1977. His company, Sublogic, initially distributed it for various personal computers. In 1981, Artwick was approached by Microsoft&#x27;s Alan M. Boyd who was interested in creating a &quot;definitive game&quot; that would graphically demonstrate the difference between older 8-bit computers, such as the Apple II, and the new 16-bit computers, such as the IBM PC, still in development. In 1982, Artwick&#x27;s company licensed a version of &quot;Flight Simulator&quot; for the IBM PC to Microsoft, which marketed it as &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot;.

In 2009, Microsoft closed down Aces Game Studio, which was the department responsible for creating and maintaining the &quot;Flight Simulator&quot; series. In 2014, Dovetail Games were granted the rights by Microsoft to port the Gold Edition of Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;Flight Simulator X&quot; to Steam and publish &quot;Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition&quot;.

Microsoft announced a new installment at E3 in 2019, simply titled &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot;, to be released initially on PC and ported over to the Xbox Series consoles at a later date. On July 12, 2020, Microsoft opened up preorders and announced that &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot; for PC will be available on August 18, 2020. The company announced three different versions of the title – standard, deluxe, and premium deluxe, each providing an incremental set of gameplay features, including airports, and airplanes to choose from. The Xbox edition was released on July 27, 2021.

The newest entry, &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024&quot;, was released on November 19, 2024.

==History==

&quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot; began as a set of articles written by Bruce Artwick in 1976 about a 3D computer graphics program. When the magazine editor said that subscribers wanted to buy the program, Artwick set to work to create it and incorporated a company called Sublogic Corporation in 1977. The company began selling flight simulators for several computer platforms, including the 8080, Altair 8800, and IMSAI 8080. In 1979 Sublogic released &quot;FS1 Flight Simulator&quot; for the Apple II. In 1980, Sublogic released a version for the TRS-80, and in 1982 they licensed an IBM PC version with CGA graphics to Microsoft, which was released as simply &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot; on a self-booting disk. In the early days of less-than-100% IBM PC compatible systems, &quot;Flight Simulator&quot; and Lotus 1-2-3 were used as unofficial compatibility test software for new PC clone models.

Sublogic continued to develop for other platforms and ported &quot;Flight Simulator II&quot; to the Apple II in 1983; Commodore 64, MSX, and Atari 8-bit computers in 1984; and Amiga and Atari ST in 1986. Meanwhile, Bruce Artwick left Sublogic and founded The Bruce Artwick Organization to continue his work on subsequent Microsoft releases, beginning with &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator 3.0&quot; in 1988. &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot; reached commercial maturity with version 3.1, and went on to encompass the use of 3D graphics and graphic hardware acceleration.

Microsoft continued to produce newer versions of the flight simulation software, adding features, such as new aircraft types and augmented scenery. The &quot;2000&quot; and &quot;2002&quot; versions were available in &quot;Standard&quot; and &quot;Professional&quot; editions, where the latter included more aircraft, tools and scenery options. The &quot;2004&quot; release (version 9) marked the celebration of one hundred years of powered flight and had only one edition. &quot;Flight Simulator X&quot;, released in 2006, returned to dual versions with a &quot;Standard&quot; and a &quot;Deluxe&quot; edition.

The flying area encompasses planet Earth with varying degrees of detail and includes over 24,000 airports. There is an ever-growing list of scenery representing major landmarks and popular cities. Landscape details become sparse as gameplay moves away from population centers within the flight simulator, particularly outside the United States, although a variety of websites offer scenery add-ons to remedy this.

The three latest versions incorporate sophisticated weather simulation, along with the ability to download real-world weather data (first available with &quot;Flight Simulator 2000&quot;). Additional features in these newer versions include air traffic environments with interactive air traffic control functions, new aircraft models from the historical Douglas DC-3 to the modern Boeing 777, interactive lessons, challenges, and aircraft checklists. The two latest versions of &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot; have a &quot;kiosk mode&quot;, which allows the application to be run in electronic kiosks located in public places like shopping malls. &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot; has a wide selection of upgrades and add-ons, both free and commercial, official and fan-made.

===&quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator X&quot;===

&quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator X&quot; is the third most recent major release of &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot;, and the last one developed by Aces Game Studio. It includes a graphics engine upgrade and compatibility with preview DirectX 10 and Windows Vista. It was released on October 17, 2006, in North America. There are two versions of the game, both on two DVDs. The &quot;Deluxe&quot; edition contains the new Garmin G1000 integrated flight instrument system in three cockpits, additional aircraft, and missions; Tower Control capability in multiplayer mode; higher detail scenery for cities and airports; and a Software Development Kit (SDK) for development. The main improvements are graphical.

Microsoft has also released a &quot;Flight Simulator X&quot; demo, which contains three aircraft, two airports, and two missions. It is compatible with Windows XP SP2 and Windows Vista.

===Closure of the Aces Game Studio===

On January 22, 2009, it was reported that the development team was heavily affected by Microsoft&#x27;s program of job cuts, with indications that the entire &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot; team had been laid off. Microsoft confirmed the closure of the Aces Game Studio on January 26, 2009, in a post on the official FSInsider Web site. stating &quot;This difficult decision was made to align Microsoft&#x27;s resources with our strategic priorities. &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator X&quot; will remain available at retail stores and Web retailers, the Flight Sim community will continue to learn from and encourage one another, and we remain committed to the &quot;Flight Simulator&quot; franchise for the long term.&quot;

According to former Aces employee Phil Taylor, the shutdown was not due to sales performance of &quot;FSX&quot;, but due to management problems and delays in project delivery, combined with increased demand for staff. Speculation in the mainstream and gaming media was that future versions could be released as an Internet-based version, or on Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox platform.

In October 2009, two (out of over fifty) former members of the Aces Game Studio formed a new game studio called the Cascade Game Foundry for the development of simulation games.

===Third-party developer agreements===
====Lockheed Martin &quot;Prepar3D&quot;====

In late 2007, Aces Game Studio announced Microsoft ESP (Enterprise Simulation Platform), a development platform for companies that want to create products that use the technology in &quot;Flight Simulator&quot;. Following the closure of the Aces Game Studio in January 2009, Lockheed Martin announced in late 2009 that they had negotiated with Microsoft a licensing agreement to purchase the intellectual property (including source code) for the Microsoft ESP product. It is the commercial-use version of &quot;Flight Simulator X&quot; SP2. On May 17, 2010, Lockheed announced that the new product based upon the ESP source code would be called Prepar3D (P3D). Lockheed hired members of the original Aces Game Studio team to continue development of the product.

In November 2010, Lockheed Martin debuted &quot;Prepar3D&quot; version 1. Version 1.1 was released in April 2011, with a retail license cost of US$499. A developer license is also available for a monthly fee of US$9.95. In March 2012, along with the release of version 1.3, the pricing strategy was revised. The Professional edition is now available for US$199, with an Academic License available for US$59.95.

Often touted as &#x27;FSX on steroids&#x27;, P3D has so far had 5 versions, with the latest launched on April 14, 2020. Version 5 features 41 aircraft and over 23000 airports. Before that, version 2, 3 and 4 saw releases in 2013, 2015, and 2017 respectively.

Due to the changes in elevation between version 4 and version 5, many developers charged for upgrades to make their airport sceneries compatible with the new elevation. This elevation issue, in turn, created new developers to pop up to create &quot;compatibility files&quot; for older version 4 airports to work on version 5. Companies such as iniBuilds and Scandinavian Mountains lead the development of compatibility files.

====Dovetail Games and &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition&quot;====
On July 9, 2014, Dovetail Games announced that Microsoft had granted them rights to develop the next &quot;Flight Simulator&quot; in the series. Dovetail Games also announced the release of &quot;Flight Simulator X: Gold Edition&quot; on Steam for late 2014, titled &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition&quot;. It was released on December 18, 2014. It is a re-release and includes content that was provided with the original &quot;FSX: Gold Edition&quot; which includes &quot;FSX: Deluxe Edition&quot;, the &quot;Acceleration&quot; expansion pack, and both official Service Packs and repackages them in one bundle and a single installation. The &quot;Steam Edition&quot; includes &quot;all standard Steam functionality&quot;, including an overhaul of the multiplayer support to go through Steam rather than the now-defunct GameSpy, improved stability on Windows 7 and 8, and features minor performance tweaks including a complete recompile using VS2013.

Additionally, Dovetail Games has worked with existing developers and publishers to distribute their content on Steam as DLC. Currently, there are over 100 add-ons for FSX: Steam Edition from over 35 developers available on the Steam store including Aerosoft, Captain Sim, Orbx Simulation Systems, Real Environment Xtreme (REX), Carenado, Virtavia, and others.

=====&quot;Flight Sim World&quot;=====
In May 2017, Dovetail Games announced &quot;Flight Sim World&quot;, based on the codebase of &quot;Flight Simulator X&quot;, and released later that month. Only a year later, on April 23, 2018, Dovetail announced end of development of &quot;Flight Sim World&quot; and the end of sales effective May 15, 2018.

===&quot;Microsoft Flight&quot;===

Microsoft released a new flight simulator titled &quot;Microsoft Flight&quot; in February 2012. Developed by The Coalition (as Microsoft Game Studios Vancouver), it was not part of the &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot; series, but instead was designed to replace it and aimed at drawing new users into flight gaming. While claiming to be simpler to use for inexperienced users, it is incompatible with &quot;Flight Simulator&quot; and does not allow the use of existing &quot;Flight Simulator&quot; add-ons (including aircraft, objects, and photographic scenery).

The game was &quot;pay to play&quot;, as only the single island of Hawai&#x27;i and one aircraft was available without buying downloadable content. On July 26, 2012, Microsoft cancelled further development of &quot;Flight&quot;.

===&quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot; (2020)===

On June 9, 2019, as part of their E3 conference announcements Microsoft revealed that they would be bringing back the &quot;Flight Simulator&quot; series with an updated release, simply titled &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot;. On the same day, Microsoft launched a new website for the title and posted a teaser video on their Xbox YouTube channel. The new version features tight integration of ground satellite data and Microsoft&#x27;s own Azure AI into the simulator&#x27;s engine to generate near-photorealistic graphics. Asobo Studio is the lead developer.

The game is Microsoft&#x27;s first simulator since &quot;Microsoft Flight&quot; in 2012. In addition to the PC release it was also released for the Xbox Series X and Series S, making it the first entry in the &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot; series to be released for a gaming console. The Windows PC version of the simulator was released on August 18, 2020. &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot; launched for Xbox Series X and Series S on July 27, 2021 and can be played on the Xbox One with Cloud Gaming from Xbox Game Pass.

=== &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024&quot; ===
On June 11, 2023, during the Xbox Games Showcase Microsoft revealed a trailer for &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024&quot;, which was captioned &quot;the next generation of the legendary franchise.&quot; This update will bring performance improvements, graphics improvements, and more planes.

On Nov. 2024, &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024&quot; introduces Joby Aviation’s electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft.

==Add-ons, customization, and community involvement==

The long history and consistent sales of &quot;Flight Simulator&quot; has encouraged a very large body of add-on packages to be developed as both commercial and volunteer ventures. A formal software development kit and other tools for the simulator exist to further facilitate third-party efforts, and some third parties have also learned to &#x27;tweak&#x27; the simulator in various ways by trial and error. As for number of add-ons, tweaks, and modifications &quot;Flight Simulator&quot; can accommodate solely depends on the user&#x27;s hardware setup. The number is not limited by the simulator, and when multiple computers are linked together with multiple monitors and third-party software and controls, &quot;Flight Simulator&quot; enthusiasts can build their own realistic home cockpits.

===Aircraft===

Individual attributes of &quot;Flight Simulator&quot; aircraft that can be customized include; cockpit layout, cockpit image, aircraft model, aircraft model textures, aircraft flight characteristics, scenery models, scenery layouts, and scenery textures, often with simple-to-use programs, or only a text editor such as &#x27;Notepad&#x27;. Dedicated &#x27;flight simmers have taken advantage of &quot;Flight Simulator&#x27;s&quot; vast add-on capabilities, having successfully linked &quot;Flight Simulator&quot; to homebuilt hardware, some of which approaches the complexity of commercial full-motion flight simulators.

The simulator&#x27;s aircraft are made up of five parts:

* The model, which is a 3D CAD-style model of the aircraft&#x27;s exterior and virtual cockpit, if applicable. Models consist of two distinct sections - the main chassis or &quot;core&quot;, and accessories or dynamic parts, such as the landing gear or ailerons.
* The textures, bitmap images which the game layers onto the model. These can be easily edited (known as &quot;repainting&quot;), so that a model can adopt any paint scheme imaginable, real or fictional.
* The sounds, literally what the aircraft sounds like. This is determined by defining which WAV files the aircraft uses as its sound-set.
* The panel, a representation of the aircraft&#x27;s cockpit. This includes one or more bitmap images of the panel, instrument gauge files, and sometimes its own sounds.
* The FDE, or &quot;Flight Dynamics Engine&quot;. This consists of the air-file (a *.air file), which contains hundreds of parameters that define the aircraft&#x27;s flight characteristics, and the aircraft.cfg file, which contains more and easier-to-edit parameters.

Most versions of &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot; include some of the world&#x27;s most popular aircraft from different categories, such as the Mooney Bravo and Beechcraft Baron 58, which fall into the general aviation category; the Airbus A321 and Boeing 737, which fall into the civil jets category; the Robinson R22, which falls into the helicopter category; the Air Scheffel 738, which falls into the general aviation category again; and many other planes commonly used around the world.

Not being limited to using the default aircraft, add-on planes can be downloaded from many sources for free or purchased, which can then be installed into &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot;. The Beechcraft 1900D pictured above, is an add-on aircraft. Similarly, add-on repaints can be added to default aircraft; these repaints are usually downloaded for free.

====AI Traffic====
A growing add-on category for the series is AI (artificial intelligence) traffic. AI traffic is the simulation of other vehicles in the &quot;FS&quot; landscape. This traffic plays an important role in the simulator, as it is possible to crash into traffic (this can be disabled), thus ending your session, and to interact with the traffic via the radio and ATC. This feature is active even with third-party traffic. Microsoft introduced AI traffic in MSFS 2002 with several airliners and private aircraft. This has since been supplemented with many files created by third-party developers. Typically, third-party aircraft models have multiple levels of detail, which allow the AI traffic to be better on frame rates, while still being detailed during close looks. There are several prominent freeware developers. Some third-party AI traffic can even be configured for &quot;real-time&quot; departures.

===Scenery===

Scenery add-ons usually involve replacements for existing airports, with enhanced and more accurate detail, or large expanses of highly detailed ground scenery for specific regions of the world. Some types of scenery add-on replace or add structures to the simulator. Both freeware and payware scenery add-ons are very widely available. Airport enhancements, for example, range from simple add-ons that update runways or taxiways to very elaborate packages that reproduce every lamp, pavement marking, and structure at an airport with near-total accuracy, including animated effects such as baggage cars or marshalling agents. Wide-area scenery enhancements may use detailed satellite photos and 3-D structures to closely reproduce real-world regions, particularly those including large cities, landmarks, or spectacular natural wonders.

===Flight networks===
Virtual flight networks such as IVAO, VATSIM, and Pilot Edge as well as Virtual Skies, and Mindstar Aviation&#x27;s AirspaceVR use special, small add-on modules for &quot;Flight Simulator&quot; to enable connection to their proprietary networks in multiplayer mode, and to allow for voice and text communication with other virtual pilots and controllers over the network. These networks allow players to enjoy and enhance realism in their game. These networks are for ATC (air traffic control).

===Miscellaneous===
Some utilities, such as FSUIPC, merely provide useful tweaks for the simulator to overcome design limitations or bugs, or to allow more extensive interfacing with other third-party add-ons. Sometimes certain add-ons require other utility add-ons in order to work correctly with the simulator.

Other add-ons provide navigation tools, simulation of passengers, and cameras that can view aircraft or scenery from any angle, more realistic instrument panels and gauges, and so on.

Some software add-ons provide operability with specific hardware, such as game controllers and optical motion sensors.

FSDeveloper.com is one website that host a forum style knowledge base aimed at the development of add-on items, tools, and software.

Excel Unusual hosts two versions of flight simulator downloads and tutorials, built from scratch with only VBA and cell formulas, in both 2D and 3D.

===Availability===
A number of websites are dedicated to providing users with add-on files (such as airplanes from actual airlines, airport utility cars, actual buildings located in specific cities, textures, and city files). The wide availability over the internet of freeware add-on files for the simulation package has encouraged the development of a large and diverse virtual community, linked up by design group and enthusiast message boards, online multiplayer flying, and &#x27;virtual airlines&#x27;. The internet has also facilitated the distribution of &#x27;payware&#x27; add-ons for the simulator, with the option of downloading the files, which reduces distribution costs.

==Reception==
&quot;PC Magazine&quot; in January 1983 called &quot;Flight Simulator&quot; &quot;extraordinarily realistic ... a classic program, unique in the market&quot;. It praised the graphics and detailed scenery, and concluded &quot;I think it&#x27;s going to sell its share of IBM PCs, and will certainly sell some color/graphics adapters&quot;. &quot;BYTE&quot; in December 1983 wrote that &quot;this amazing package does an incredible job of making you think you&#x27;re actually flying a small plane&quot;. While it noted the inability to use a RGB monitor or a joystick, the magazine concluded that &quot;for $49.95 you can&#x27;t have everything&quot;. A pilot wrote in the magazine in March 1984 that he found the simulated Cessna 182 to be &quot;surprisingly realistic&quot;. While criticizing the requirement of using the keyboard to fly, he concluded &quot;&quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot; is a tour de force of the programmer&#x27;s art ... It can be an excellent introduction to how an aircraft actually operates for a budding or student pilot and can even help instrument pilots or those going for an instrument rating sharpen their skills&quot;.

Another pilot similarly praised &quot;Flight Simulator 2.0&quot; in &quot;PC Magazine&quot; that year, giving it 18 out of 18 points. He reported that its realism compared well to two $3 million hardware flight simulators he had recently flown, and that he could use real approach plates to land at and navigate airports &quot;Flight Simulator&quot;″s manual did not document. &quot;Compute!&quot; warned &quot;if you don&#x27;t know much about flying, this program may overwhelm you. It&#x27;s not a simple simulation. It&#x27;s a challenging program even for experienced pilots&quot;. The magazine concluded that &quot;Flight Simulator&quot; &quot;is interesting, challenging, graphically superb, diverse, rewarding, and just plain fun ... sheer delight&quot;. &quot;Flight Simulator 2.0&quot; was reviewed in 1989 in &quot;Dragon&quot; #142 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in &quot;The Role of Computers&quot; column. The reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars.

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; stated in 1994 that &quot;Flight Simulator 5&quot; &quot;is closer to simulating real flight than ever before&quot;.

&quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator X&quot; was reviewed in 2006 by &quot;GameSpot&quot;. The reviewer gave the game an 8.4 out of 10 and commented on how it was realistic enough to be used for real-life flight training.

==Awards==
By June 1999, the series had sold units worldwide, for which it was awarded the Guinness World Record for best-selling flight simulator series.

The success of the &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot; series has led to Guinness World Records awarding the series seven world records in the &quot;Guinness World Records: Gamer&#x27;s Edition 2008&quot;. These records include &quot;Longest Running Flight Sim Series&quot;, &quot;Most Successful Flight Simulator Series&quot;, and &quot;Most Expensive Home Flight Simulator Cockpit&quot;, which was built by Australian trucking tycoon Matthew Sheil, and cost around $200,000 to build.

<text>Ferdowsi University of Mashhad (FUM, , &quot;Danushgah-e Ferdusi-ye Mashhad&quot;) is a public university in Mashhad, the capital city of the Iranian province of Razavi Khorasan. FUM is named after [[Ferdowsi|Abul-Qâsem Ferdowsi]] [[Tus, Iran|Tusi]], who is considered to be the national epic poet of Greater Iran. Having been established in 1949, FUM is the third-oldest modern university in Iran.

FUM is among the most prestigious universities in Iran, and had been ranked as the 3rd best university of the nation in the 2018 ISC rankings published by the Iranian government. FUM offers 180 bachelors, master&#x27;s, and Ph.D. programs to 30,000 students. It has 810 faculty members and 2500 staff members. FUM has the highest number of enrollments of foreign students in Iran. Foreign students, from countries such as Afghanistan, Syria, and Iraq make up a significant portion of the students.

== Mission ==
The mission of the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad is to educate the citizens and citizen-leaders of society based on divine principles of Islam and scientifically qualified centers of excellence. FUM has some mosques, the most prominent of which is the mosque of Imam Reza (which was built a few years ago).
== History ==
If the upgrading of the College of Health to the status of Faculty of Medicine in 1949 is regarded as the first step in establishing the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, the university is the fifth oldest in Iran after the universities of Tehran (1934), Tabriz (1947), Shiraz (1946) and Isfahan (1946), not counting the founding of other academic colleges such as the West Minster Medical College (1878), now Urmia University)).

Mashhad Faculty of Medicine is part of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, which merged with the Faculty of Literature to form the University of Mashhad in 1954 when the new faculty opened with five different fields. With the expansion of higher education, the following faculties were subsequently established: Faculty of Theology, Faculty of Science, Faculty of Dentistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Nutrition, Faculty of Education and Psychology, Faculty of Agriculture, Faculty of Engineering, the Institute of Optometry, the university&#x27;s high school, and the Teaching Center. Mashhad University was renamed Ferdowsi University in 1974.

Before the 1979 Iranian revolution, the curriculum and research agenda at Ferdowsi were designed with the help of Georgetown University. However, this collaboration was halted after the revolution. 

The university also has one of the largest campuses in Iran.

After emerging regional health organizations in the universities of medical sciences in 1994, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences was separated from Ferdowsi University. Meanwhile, a number of new faculties and schools such as Faculty of Administration and Economics, Faculty of Veterinary Sciences, Shirvan Agricultural College, Faculty of Physical Education and Sports, Faculty of Mathematical Sciences, Neishaboor Faculty of the Arts, Institute of Plantation Science, The Seismology Research Center, the University&#x27;s College, Faculty of Natural Resources and Environment, Faculty of Architecture and Urban Planning were established one after the other.

At the present time, this institute focuses on the development of different types of wind turbine and assessment of Solar panels and solar machines.

== Admissions ==
The admission rate range is 40–50%, making this Iranian higher education organization an averagely selective institution. However, considering the strong efforts to improve the higher institutions in religious cities after the Islamic Revolution (27% of the resources allocated to the university are reported to be funded through proprietary revenues other than the governmental budget), undergraduate admission to Ferdowsi is limited to the top 10–20% of students who pass the national entrance examination administered yearly by the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education and could not be admitted in University of Tehran, Sharif University of Technology, Amirkabir University of Technology, Iran University of Science and Technology and Shahid Beheshti University (mostly from the cities of Razavi Khorasan, and specially Mashhad). To attract top students, the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad has tried to use the scholarships so that after the increasing decline in admission rate in sciences (and especially physics), which was considered a serious threat to the university, additional scholarships are to be dedicated to all disciplines.

There are 12,645 undergraduate students, including 8,398 females (66.4%) and 4,247 males (33.6%) in the university.

=== Foreign students ===
The Ferdowsi University of Mashhad is regarded as the first institution in attracting foreign students, mainly from Afghanistan, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, Bahrain, Central Asian republics, after the efforts made during the presidency of Ahmadinejad who declared Mashhad as &quot;Iran&#x27;s spiritual capital&quot;. Currently, more than 1,300 foreign students have enrolled in the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, which form one twentieth of the university students. According to the head of the University, more than half of the foreign students studying at the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad are from Afghanistan and have were admitted at the university by using scholarships (106 students), through participating in the National entrance examination (199 students) and as independent students (204 people).

According to a deputy president of Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, most of the foreign students studying in Iran are from Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Pakistan, and Turkey. According to Iran&#x27;s Minister of Science, Research, and Technology (in a speech at a graduation ceremony of a number of foreign students of Ferdowsi University of Mashhad), many efforts were underway to attract as many as 25,000 by 2015 during the presidency of Ahmadinejad: &quot;The improvement of the quality of universities has paved the way for the enrollment of foreign students. Fourteen thousand foreign students from 92 countries are currently studying at Iran&#x27;s universities. And if we include the 12,000 foreign students studying at Al-Mustafa (International) University, a total of 26,000 foreign students are studying at higher education institutions in the country&quot;.

== International interactions ==
The university has been described with weak connection to other institutions. As the head of the University said, &quot;less than 10% of our colleagues have international interactions in Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, showing a bad situation on the connection between our academics and the universities abroad so that in order to improve the cooperation with Russian universities, the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad pays the entire cost of any joint project that each of university professors have with a Russian university or a professor.&quot;

== Publications ==
FUM publishes 48 peer-reviewed scientific journals covering almost all fields of sciences and humanities. Some national notable journals are, &quot;Journal of Cell and Molecular Research&quot; (&quot;JCMR&quot;), &quot;Iranian Journal of Health and Physical Activity&quot;, &quot;Iranian Journal of Animal BioSystematics&quot;, &quot;Iranian Journal of Electrical Systems&quot;, &quot;Iranian Journal of Veterinary Science Technology&quot;, &quot;Iranian Journal of Numerical Analysis and Optimization&quot;, etc.

== Famous events ==
After the controversial appearance of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at Columbia University on 25 September 2007, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad invited President Bush to travel to Iran and speak on campus about a range of issues, including the Holocaust, terrorism, human rights and U.S. foreign policy. The invitation asked Bush to answer questions from students and professors &quot;just the same way&quot; that Ahmadinejad took questions &quot;despite all the insults directed at him.&quot; The White House said that Bush would be willing to travel to Iran, but under different circumstances: &quot;President Bush looks forward to traveling to a democratic Iran, an Iran where its leaders allow freedom of speech and assembly for all of its people and an Iran where the leaders mourn the victims of the Holocaust, not call for the destruction of Israel,&quot; National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said.

Some Iranian educational institutions such as Ferdowsi University of Mashhad have also been building their presence in Afghanistan. As Iranian officials announced in February 2009, the university opened a campus in Herat (named after a Persian poet who resided in Herat during the eleventh century)—the efforts that allow Iran to engage directly with Afghanistan&#x27;s population and develop close ties with religious and ethnic minorities.

In 2011, Ferdowsi University&#x27;s Department of Engineering in Mashhad said it would segregate students by gender in nearly 50 courses. One year before, a few general courses at Ferdowsi, such as general mathematics and physics, imposed separate classes for men and women. The disciplinary restrictions imposed on students, particularly female students, had been on the rise since June 2009, in many cases accompanied with insults and degradation of students.

== Professor&#x27;s Basij Organization (PBO) ==
The emergence of Mahmud Ahmadinejad in the 2005 presidential election brought a new force to Iran&#x27;s political power, namely, the Professor&#x27;s Basij Organization (PBO). PBO offices were established at a few large universities, including Ferdowsi University of Mashhad. The military, Basij, and IRGC veterans teaching at these universities welcomed the establishment and inauguration of the Basij bureaus at universities, as most of them were already enrolled in such bureaus in other settings.
The number of the registered members of the Professor&#x27;s Basij Organization in Razavi Khorasan is 2 thousand and 500, most of whom belong to the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad (it has 900 faculty members). According to the head of Razavi Khorasan&#x27;s PBO, the number of Basiji professors is much greater than the number of the registered PBO members.
4,000 students of Mashhad&#x27;s universities (mostly the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad) have registered in the Basij Organization.

<text>The University of Tehran (Tehran University or UT, , romanized &quot;Dāneshgāh-e Tehran&quot;) is a Collegiate university and the oldest and most prominent Iranian university located in Tehran, Iran. Based on its historical, socio-cultural, and political pedigree, as well as its research and teaching profile, UT has been nicknamed &quot;The Mother University [of Iran]&quot; (). It is also the premier knowledge producing institute among all OIC countries. The university offers more than 111 bachelor&#x27;s degree programs, 177 master&#x27;s degree programs, and 156 PhD. programs. Many of the departments were absorbed into the University of Tehran from the Dar al-Funun established in 1851 and the Tehran School of Political Sciences established in 1899.

The main campus of the university is located in the central part of the city. However, other campuses are spread across the city as well as in the suburbs such as the Baghe Negarestan Campus at the central eastern part of the city, the Northern Amirabad Campuses at the central western part of the city and the Abureyhan Campus in the suburb of the capital. The main gate of the university with its specific design and modern architecture (at Enghelab Street at the main campus) is the logo of the university. 

Admission to the university&#x27;s undergraduate and graduate programs is limited to the top one percent of students who pass the national entrance examination administered yearly by the Ministry of Science, Research and Technology.

==History==
The first official step for the establishment of the present form of University of Tehran in Iran occurred on 31 March 1931 when Minister of Court Abdolhossein Teymourtash wrote Isa Sedigh who was completing his doctoral dissertation at Columbia University in New York to inquire as to requirements for the establishment of a university in Tehran. Isa Sedigh regarded the letter as an invitation to outline a comprehensive scheme for the establishment of a new university.

In 1933, during the cabinet meeting, the subject was brought up. Ali Asghar Hekmat, the acting minister of the Ministry of Education stated the following words there:
&quot;Of course, there is no doubt on the thriving state and the glory of the capital, but the only obvious deficiency is that this city has no &#x27;university&#x27;. It is a pity that this city lags far behind other great countries of the world.&quot;
His words had a profound impact on everyone in the meeting, resulting in the acceptance of the proposal. Thus allocating an initial budget of 250,000 Tomans, the Ministry of Education was authorized to find a suitable land for the establishment of the university and take necessary measures to construct the building as soon as possible.
Ali Asghar Hekmat in collaboration and consultation with André Godard, a French architect – who was serving the Ministry of Education as an engineer, began looking for a location for the university grounds. By the orders of Rezā Shāh, the compound of Jalaliyeh garden was selected. Jalaliyeh garden was located in the north of the then Tehran between Amirabad village and the northern trench of Tehran. This garden was founded in the early 1900s during the final years of Nasir ad- Din Shah, by the order of Prince Jalal ad-dawlah.
The master plan of the campus buildings was drawn up by French architects Roland Dubrulle and Maxime Siroux, Swiss architect Alexandre Moser, as well as Andre Godard, Nicolai Markov and Mohsen Foroughi.
The University of Tehran officially inaugurated in 1934. The Amir-abad (North Karegar) campus was added in 1945 after American troops left the property as World War II was coming to an end.
The university admitted women as students for the first time in 1937.

In 1935, the formerly males-only university opened its doors to women as part of the country&#x27;s sweeping universal education policy.

UT played a central role in the overthrow of the Pahlavi government in the 1978-9 revolution. University curricula, staff, and student intake were subject to major revisions in the early 1980s, as part of Iran&#x27;s Cultural Revolution. UT continues to constitute a central part of Iran&#x27;s student movement. 

In 1986, the Iranian parliament, known as the Majlis of Iran, stipulated that the university&#x27;s overcrowded College of Medicine be separated into the independent Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS), and that TUMS be placed under the leadership of the new ministry of health and Medical Education.

This appointment is based on national standing based on research achievements and invested funding in the mentioned topics. Fifteen percent of the country&#x27;s Centers of Excellence, as recognized by the government, are located at the University of Tehran, which along with more than 40 research centers ensure UT&#x27;s commitment to research. Together, over 3,500 laboratories are active in these centers and in the faculties. In addition, the University of Tehran publishes more than 50 scientific journals, some of which have the ISI index.

The Central Library and Documentation Center of the University of Tehran has been a member of the International Federation of Library Associations and institutions (IFLA) since 1967. The library complements the 35 specialized libraries based at different faculties, all with the aim of advancing the research goals of the university. Currently the Central Library and Documentation Center is offering its services to more than 65 thousand members. It hosts more than 5,000 users daily. The library offers its resources under 13 main collections (most of which have been donated by distinguished professors of the university). The manuscript collection of the University of Tehran includes over 17,000 volumes of manuscripts in Persian, Arabic and Turkish. The library also hosts a state of the art center for the preservation of manuscripts. 
The University of Tehran Press (UTP), which focuses on publishing academic books, has published over 5,000 books up until today, and currently publishes on average more than one book per day. UTP has over 96 distribution agents throughout the country as well as one in Afghanistan.

==Endowment==

University of Tehran is a public university and its funding is provided by the government of Iran. For the top ranks of the national university entrance exam, education is free in all public universities. The people with ranks below the normal capacity of the universities will be required to pay part or all of the tuition. In 2011 University of Tehran with an amount equivalent to 70 million dollars got the highest budget among all universities in Iran.

==Emblems==
The emblem of the University of Tehran is based on an image which can be found in the stucco relief and seals of the Sasanid period. It is a copy from a stucco relief discovered in the city of Ctesiphon. The seal symbolized ownership. In the Sassanid period, these seals were used in stucco reliefs, coins, and silver utensils as a family symbol. Since the alphabet of Sasanid Pahlavi&#x27;s script was used in these badges, they have the nature of a monogram as well.

The motif is placed between two eagle wings. One can also find these motifs in other images of this period, such as in royal crowns, particularly at the end of the Sasanid period. Crowns with these seals have been called &quot;two-feather crowns&quot; in the Shahnameh. The motif between the wings was made by combining Pahlavi scripts. Some scholars have tried to read these images. The script is in the form of &quot;Afzoot&quot; (Amrood), which means plentiful and increasing.

==Colors==
University of Tehran&#x27;s official color is University of Tehran Blue (RGB: 29,160,196).

==Main entrance==

The University of Tehran main entrance was designed in 1965 by Korosh Farzami, one of the students of the faculty of Fine Arts of the University and built by Arme Construction Company.

The gates are depicted on the reverse of the Iranian 50,000 rials banknote.

==Political role==

University of Tehran&#x27;s central place in Iranian elite circles has made it the setting for many political events and cultural works. It was in front of the gates of this school that The Shah&#x27;s army opened fire on dissident students, killing many and further triggering the 1979 revolution of Iran. It was there and 20 years later in July 1999 that, albeit, a much smaller number of dissident students confronted the police.
University of Tehran (UT) has always been a bastion of political movement and ideology. Since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the main campus of the university and its surrounding streets have been the site for Tehran&#x27;s Friday prayers.

The political and social role of the University of Tehran in the Iranian domestic arena has continued to be so pronounced that in November 2005 (to February 2008) a senior Islamic scholar became chancellor(president) of the university, replacing Faraji-dana (professor of electrical engineering faculty). Ayatollah Abbasali Amid Zanjani (عباسعلی عميد زنجانی) is a professor in law, is known for his strong ties to Ayatollah Khomeini in the 1979 revolution, and had spent time in the Shah&#x27;s prisons before the Islamic Revolution. In February 2008, an economist, Farhad Rahbar, a former vice president of Iran and head of Management and Planning Organization of Iran, became the new (31st) chancellor of the university.

One hundred and nineteen faculty members of the University of Tehran are said to have resigned on 15 June 2009 to protest the attack on university dorms in the wake of contested 2009 presidential elections: although clear follow-up data is hard to establish, it seems that most or all resignations were not accepted.

<doc id="160000" wikidata="Q1046309" url="?curid=160000" title="Philharmonia Orchestra">
<text>The Philharmonia Orchestra is a British orchestra based in London. It was founded in 1945 by Walter Legge, a classical music record producer for EMI. Among the conductors who worked with the orchestra in its early years were Richard Strauss, Wilhelm Furtwängler and Arturo Toscanini; of the Philharmonia&#x27;s younger conductors, the most important to its development was Herbert von Karajan who, though never formally chief conductor, was closely associated with the orchestra in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The Philharmonia became widely regarded as the finest of London&#x27;s five symphony orchestras in its first two decades.

From the late 1950s to the early 1970s the orchestra&#x27;s chief conductor was Otto Klemperer, with whom the orchestra gave many concerts and made numerous recordings of the core orchestral repertoire. During Klemperer&#x27;s tenure Legge, citing the difficulty of maintaining the orchestra&#x27;s high standards, attempted to disband it in 1964, but the players, backed by Klemperer, formed themselves into a self-governing ensemble as the New Philharmonia Orchestra. After thirteen years under this title, they negotiated the rights to revert to the original name.

In Klemperer&#x27;s last years the orchestra suffered a decline, both financial and artistic, but recovered under his successor, Riccardo Muti, who revitalised the orchestra in his ten-year term from 1972 to 1982. The orchestra&#x27;s standards remained high throughout the controversial chief conductorship of Giuseppe Sinopoli from 1984 to 1994, and the more orthodox tenure of Christoph von Dohnányi between 1997 and 2008. Esa-Pekka Salonen, principal conductor from 2008 to 2021 was succeeded by Santtu-Matias Rouvali.

The Philharmonia has had many celebrated players in its ranks and has commissioned more than 100 compositions. It gives more than 160 concerts a year, tours widely, and from its inception has been known for its many recordings.

==History==
===Background===
The name &quot;Philharmonia&quot; was adopted by the impresario and recording producer Walter Legge for a string quartet he brought together in 1941, comprising Henry Holst, Jean Pougnet, Frederick Riddle and Anthony Pini. The name was taken from the title page of the published score Legge used for the first work they recorded. Temporarily augmented to a septet, the ensemble gave its first concert in the Wigmore Hall, the main item being Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Introduction and Allegro&quot;. With several changes of personnel the quartet continued to play in concert and in the recording studio during the Second World War. In 1942 the editor of &quot;The Gramophone&quot;, Compton Mackenzie, wrote that he had no hesitation in calling the Philharmonia the best string quartet in the country.

During the war, Legge was in charge of the music division of the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA), which provided entertainment for British and allied armed forces. In this role he was in close touch with many first-rate musicians in the armed services, from whom he intended to draw when creating a new orchestra after the end of the war. He later set out his guiding principles:
Before the war, Legge had been assistant to Sir Thomas Beecham at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Both men wrongly assumed that they would be able to resume their control of the opera house after the war, and Legge conceived of a new orchestra based there, operating on the lines of the Vienna Philharmonic – playing in the pit for the opera and also giving concerts and making records on its own account. The committee appointed by the British government to re-establish opera and ballet at Covent Garden abandoned the pre-war system of opera seasons, in favour of a permanent year-round company. Neither Beecham nor Legge was invited to run it. Legge nevertheless decided to go ahead with his plans to form an orchestra. Although London already had three permanent symphony orchestras – the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO), BBC Symphony Orchestra (BBC SO) and London Philharmonic (LPO), their personnel and standards had declined during the war and he was convinced he could do better.

===First concerts===

Legge secured the services of many talented young musicians still serving in the armed forces. He first assembled a &quot;Philharmonia String Orchestra&quot; for recordings in 1945, composed of musicians from the RAF orchestra. He then recruited wind and percussion players, including some of the country&#x27;s top instrumentalists who had been playing in other orchestras during the war. At the Philharmonia Orchestra&#x27;s first concert, on 27 October 1945, more than sixty per cent of the players were still officially in the services. Beecham conducted the concert (for the fee of one cigar), but as he refused to be Legge&#x27;s employee and Legge refused to cede control of the orchestra, they went their separate ways. Beecham founded the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO) the following year.

Unlike the existing London orchestras, but like Beecham&#x27;s Royal Philharmonic, the early Philharmonia was not a permanent ensemble: it was convened &quot;ad hoc&quot; from available players on Legge&#x27;s list. Several of those players were also on Beecham&#x27;s list, and were able to play for both orchestras, including the horn player, Dennis Brain, the clarinettist Reginald Kell and the timpanist James Bradshaw. Although this gave both orchestras access to the finest players, a review of the London orchestral scene of the late 1940s commented, &quot;The Philharmonia and Royal Philharmonic share a very serious disability: that neither is a permanently constituted orchestra. Both assemble and disperse more or less at random ... there is no style which is distinctively RPO or Philharmonia.&quot; It was widely felt in musical circles that the Philharmonia was essentially a recording orchestra that also gave concerts, although Legge firmly denied this. Nevertheless, the orchestra played far fewer concerts than the older London orchestras: in 1949–50 the Philharmonia gave 32 concerts compared with 55 by the BBC SO, 103 by the LSO, and 248 by the LPO.

From its early years the orchestra played under prominent conductors including Richard Strauss for a single concert in 1947, and from 1948 onwards, Wilhelm Furtwängler and Herbert von Karajan for concerts and recordings. Until the opening of the Royal Festival Hall in 1951, London lacked a suitable hall for symphony concerts. Filling the vast Royal Albert Hall was difficult, except for such sell-out performances as Strauss&#x27;s concert, a cycle of the Beethoven piano concertos with Artur Schnabel as soloist (1946), or the world premiere of Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Four Last Songs&quot; with Kirsten Flagstad as soloist and Furtwängler conducting (1950). For other, less popular, concerts in the orchestra&#x27;s early years Legge was partly dependent on financial support from a musical benefactor, the last Maharaja of Mysore.

===1950s: Karajan and Toscanini===
By the early 1950s the conductor most associated with the orchestra was Karajan, although he was not, officially or even unofficially, its chief conductor. He chose to work mainly with the Philharmonia and came to London for long spells twice or three times a year giving concerts and making recordings. Legge&#x27;s practice of tying concerts in with studio recordings ensured longer than usual rehearsal time, paid for by EMI. In the early years, Karajan&#x27;s concerts were criticised in the press for their unadventurous programming; but a financially hazardous tour of Europe in 1952 necessitated programmes that were box-office attractions. Karajan told the orchestra that he felt it his duty to show Europe &quot;the exceptional qualities of tone, aristocracy and vitality&quot; of the Philharmonia&#x27;s playing. The violinist Joseph Szigeti commented that the Philharmonia &quot;showed the Continent for the first time all the qualities of perfect chamber-music playing raised to the power of a great symphony orchestra.&quot;

While the orchestra was in Italy it so impressed Arturo Toscanini that he offered to come to London to conduct it. His two concerts at the Festival Hall in September 1952 (the four symphonies of Brahms) were a critical and commercial success. In the same year, Furtwängler conducted the orchestra and soloists headed by Flagstad in a recording of &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; that has remained in the catalogues ever since. Legge realised that Furtwängler was in declining health and that sooner or later Karajan would succeed him as chief conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic and Salzburg Festival and be lost to the Philharmonia. Legge began to seek out suitable successors.

===1950s: Karajan to Klemperer===
As Legge had expected, Karajan succeeded to the Berlin and Salzburg positions after Furtwängler died in 1954. Karajan remained under contract to EMI, but he quickly reduced his commitments to the Philharmonia. Among alternatives favoured by Legge and the orchestra was Guido Cantelli, who conducted some well-received recordings and concerts; his death in a plane crash in 1956 at the age of thirty-six deprived the Philharmonia of a potential replacement for Karajan. Another of Legge&#x27;s protégés, Carlo Maria Giulini, seemed promising, but had not at that point established himself with the orchestra or the public, and had a restricted repertory. Legge gradually built up a strong relationship with the veteran Otto Klemperer, who was admired by the players, the critics and the public.

The year after Cantelli&#x27;s death, the orchestra suffered a still worse blow with the death in a car crash of Dennis Brain, not only a supremely gifted player, but the most popular member of the orchestra among his colleagues. He was succeeded as principal horn by his deputy, Alan Civil.

In 1957 Legge launched the Philharmonia Chorus, an amateur body with a stiffening of professionals when needed. The chorus made its debut in Beethoven&#x27;s Choral Symphony conducted by Klemperer, and won extremely favourable reviews. In &quot;The Observer&quot; Peter Heyworth wrote that with so fine a choir and &quot;our best orchestra&quot; and a great conductor, Legge had given London &quot;a Beethoven cycle that any city in the world, be it Vienna or New York, would envy&quot;. In 1959 Legge abandoned his policy that the orchestra should have no permanent conductor, and appointed Klemperer &quot;conductor-for-life&quot;.

===1960–1964===
In the early 1960s the Philharmonia continued to be widely regarded as London&#x27;s best orchestra. The RPO went through difficult times after Beecham&#x27;s death in 1961; neither the BBC SO or the LPO had yet regained its pre-war excellence; and the LSO was only in the early stages of its return to eminence. The Philharmonia entered into a new three-year contract with EMI on advantageous terms in 1960; the number of players applying to join the orchestra was increasing; its records sold well; and its concerts under Klemperer, Giulini, Sir John Barbirolli and others (occasionally including Karajan, who made his last appearance with the orchestra in 1960) were well received by the public and the critics. Unknown to the public, and to a considerable extent the players, a combination of factors beyond the orchestra&#x27;s control was leading to a crisis. First, to avoid clashes of repertoire the Festival Hall management set up a committee to co-ordinate programming by the London orchestras. Secondly, at EMI a similar rationalisation was taking place, with an internal committee deciding which works producers, including Legge, could schedule. Legge, an autocrat by temperament, resented any curtailment of his personal control, and found committees intolerable. Finance also started to become a problem. The Philharmonia&#x27;s lucrative recording contract depended on regular work in the studio, and having by now recorded most of the standard repertoire first in mono and again in stereo the orchestra&#x27;s prospects for recording were diminishing. This meant that Legge&#x27;s scope for having concert rehearsals subsidised by EMI was also shrinking.

Although few agreed with him, Legge contended that the quality of the orchestra was declining. Looking back in 1975 at the heyday of his orchestra, he singled out for particular mention not only Brain and Civil, Kell and Bradshaw, but also Clement Lawton (tuba), Arthur Gleghorn (piccolo), Gareth Morris (flute), Sidney Sutcliffe (oboe), Frederick Thurston and Bernard Walton (clarinets), Gwydion Brooke (bassoon), and two leaders, Manoug Parikian and Hugh Bean. Legge maintained retrospectively that in the absence of enough recording work to attract the finest new orchestral players to follow such stars he had no alternative to disbanding the Philharmonia.

In March 1964, with no advance warning to the orchestra, Legge issued a press statement announcing that &quot;after the fulfilment of its present commitments the activities of the Philharmonia Orchestra will be suspended for an indefinite period.&quot; The historian of the orchestra Stephen Pettitt comments, &quot;If Legge thought that by suspending the Philharmonia Orchestra he was killing it, he had reckoned without the players&quot;. They formed themselves into a self-governing company, led by Bernard Walton, the principal clarinet, and adopted the name New Philharmonia Orchestra (NPO). Hitherto, the players had been technically freelance, paid by Legge for each performance, but they now became employees of the company they collectively owned, with security of employment.

Klemperer, Giulini and Barbirolli gave the new orchestra their strong backing, as did Sir Adrian Boult, who incensed Legge by addressing the audience at a Philharmonia concert a few days later: &quot;Do you want to see this great orchestra snuffed out like a candle? It must not be allowed to die!&quot; He urged the public to support the orchestra by going to all its concerts, whatever the programmes. The music critic of &quot;The Times&quot; commented that Boult&#x27;s point was underlined by &quot;the resplendent, intense sound he drew from choir and orchestra during the concert.&quot;

===1964–1977: New Philharmonia===
In its early years as an independent body the New Philharmonia flourished, in the concert hall and the recording studio. As well as its existing regular conductors, the orchestra worked with Ernest Ansermet, Pierre Boulez, Benjamin Britten and James Levine and many others. It reciprocated Klemperer&#x27;s loyalty and appointed him its president and chief conductor, but this led to a decline in orchestral discipline and standards as Klemperer grew older, frailer and less in command. Giulini became disillusioned and began to distance himself; Barbirolli remained firmly loyal until his death in 1970. Klemperer&#x27;s decline led to a diminution in recording sessions, and the orchestra&#x27;s finances became difficult by the late 1960s and early 1970s. There were serious but inconclusive discussions about a merger with the LPO, which was also in some difficulties at the time. The NPO was rescued from financial disaster by two musical philanthropists, one anonymous and the other Ian Stoutzker, a prominent banker, who offered either to buy the orchestra outright or, as occurred, to underwrite its finances.

Leading players of the early 1970s included Raymond Cohen, Desmond Bradley, Carlos Villa (violins), Herbert Downes (viola), Gareth Morris (flute), John McCaw (clarinet), Gwydion Brooke (bassoon) and Nicholas Busch (horn). The Philharmonia was ahead of some of its London rivals in admitting female players. By 1972, seventeen of the sixty-six string players were women, although the other three sections remained exclusively male, except for the veteran harpist, Sidonie Goossens.
In Klemperer&#x27;s later years the orchestra appointed Lorin Maazel, nominally as &quot;associate principal conductor&quot;, from 1970, although in practice his role was more like a chief conductorship, with Klemperer as a figurehead, albeit one still capable of inspiring magnificent performances on occasion. Maazel sought more control than the self-governing orchestra was willing to concede, and resigned from his post in early 1972, although he continued to accept invitations to conduct the orchestra. Shortly afterwards, Klemperer announced his retirement; he died, aged 88, the following year. The orchestra recognised that a strong chief conductor was needed to restore its standards and finances, but there was no immediately obvious candidate. Although Legge no longer had any stake in the orchestra he watched its progress benevolently, and having spotted the potential of Riccardo Muti he recommended him to the New Philharmonia&#x27;s general manager, Terence McDonald. Other potential candidates were considered, but Muti was appointed as the orchestra&#x27;s chief conductor from 1973.

Muti, although he disclaimed such a description, was a firm disciplinarian, and under his conductorship the orchestra restored its standards. Richard Morrison later wrote in &quot;The Times&quot; that in his ten years in charge, Muti turned a struggling orchestra into &quot;a great ensemble&quot;. Critics at the time commented on the orchestra&#x27;s &quot;superb performance&quot;, &quot;immense virtuosity&quot;, its &quot;astoundingly delicate&quot; string playing and &quot;woodwind phrasing even more magical than their Berlin colleagues&quot;. Muti was under contract to EMI, which brought the orchestra much valuable studio work. With Muti the orchestra recorded opera (&quot;Aida&quot;, 1974; &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot;, 1975; &quot;Nabucco&quot;, 1977; &quot;I puritani&quot;, 1979; &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;, 1979; &quot;La traviata&quot;, 1980; &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot;, 1981; and &quot;Don Pasquale&quot;, 1982); a wide range of the symphonic repertoire including Schumann and Tchaikovsky cycles; concertos with soloists including Sviatoslav Richter, Andrei Gavrilov, Anne-Sophie Mutter and Gidon Kremer; and choral music by Cherubini and Vivaldi. After Legge&#x27;s departure the orchestra was no longer exclusively tied to EMI, and made more than seventy recordings for Decca, starting in December 1964. Later Decca sessions were conducted by Boult, Britten, Giulini, Maazel, Claudio Abbado, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Charles Munch, Leopold Stokowski, and in 1967 Christoph von Dohnányi, who three decades later became the orchestra&#x27;s chief conductor.

During Muti&#x27;s tenure, the orchestra recovered its original title, after prolonged and complex negotiations. From September 1977 the &quot;New&quot; was dropped, and the orchestra has been the Philharmonia since then. Walter Legge died in 1979, and the orchestra dedicated a Tchaikovsky symphony cycle at the Festival Hall to his memory; reviewing one of the concerts in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Edward Greenfield commented that Muti had brought the orchestra&#x27;s playing &quot;within reach of that earlier peerless example&quot;.

===Late 20th century===
Leading members of the orchestra in the later years of Muti&#x27;s tenure included Raymond Ovens (leader), Gordon Hunt (oboe), Adrian Leaper (horn), John Wallace (trumpet) and David Corkhill (percussion). Clement Relf, singled out for praise by Legge in his memoirs, remained the orchestral librarian as he had been since 1945. In 1980 the orchestra received royal recognition when the Prince of Wales accepted an invitation to be the Philharmonia&#x27;s honorary patron.

Muti stepped down as chief conductor in 1982. Giuseppe Sinopoli succeeded him in 1984 and, like Muti, served for ten years. Although the orchestra&#x27;s standards remained high during Sinopoli&#x27;s tenure, the conductor had what David Nice has described in &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;a love-hate relationship&quot; with the public and critics, because of his &quot;slow speeds and mannered, sometimes lifeless phrasing&quot;. The same writer continues that the Philharmonia players did not take to &quot;Sinopoli&#x27;s peculiarly Italian brand of intellectualism; London musicians never like too much talk, let alone an analytic seminar on the work in question&quot;. By 1990 it was far from certain that Sinopoli&#x27;s appointment would last until 1994 as scheduled, but he brought to the orchestra a lucrative recording contract with Deutsche Grammophon and tours to countries including Japan and Germany where the conductor was held in very much higher regard than in Britain. Although Sinopoli&#x27;s Philharmonia performances of works such as Elgar&#x27;s Second Symphony attracted much disparaging criticism, he was felt to be more successful in opera. Nice comments that the Philharmonia players &quot;lent an unprecedented degree of tonal beauty&quot; to their opera recordings with Sinopoli; they included &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot;, 1983; &quot;La forza del destino&quot;, 1985; &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, 1987; &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;, 1990; and &quot;Tosca&quot;, 1992.

In 1995 the orchestra celebrated its 50th anniversary and launched its UK and international residency programme, with residencies at the Southbank Centre, London, and the Corn Exchange, Bedford. The orchestra developed further long-term partnerships, beginning with De Montfort Hall in Leicester (from 1997). Further partnerships followed in later decades.

It was three years before the Philharmonia recruited a chief conductor to replace Sinopoli: Christoph von Dohnányi took up the position in 1997. The music critic Andrew Clements commented that the Philharmonia&#x27;s players had &quot;maintained their coherence remarkably well through the long interregnum&quot;, but that securing &quot;a conductor of Dohnányi&#x27;s pedigree&quot; was a major achievement, and that the conductor&#x27;s skill as an orchestral trainer, combined with his excellence in interpretation augured well for the orchestra&#x27;s future. Dohnányi&#x27;s conducting was regarded as reliable and musically admirable, although sometimes rather cool. His commitment to modern music influenced the orchestra&#x27;s programming and won approval from the press. With Dohnányi the Philharmonia played in Vienna, Salzburg, Amsterdam, Lucerne and Paris. For several seasons they were in residence at the Théâtre du Châtelet, where they took part in new productions of six operas: &quot;Arabella&quot;, &quot;Die Frau ohne Schatten&quot;, &quot;Die schweigsame Frau&quot;, &quot;Moses und Aron&quot;, &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; and &quot;Hänsel und Gretel&quot;.

In 1999 the orchestra took part in what was described as a &quot;fly-on-the-wall&quot; television documentary, giving the public glimpses of day-to-day orchestral life. It showed the efforts to which individual players went to secure sponsorship for the orchestra, and the heavy workload they sustained. In 2000, under the direction of Gilbert Levine, the Philharmonia Orchestra and Chorus performed Haydn&#x27;s &quot;The Creation&quot; in a series of concerts in Baltimore, London, and Rome, including televised concerts in Baltimore and at the Vatican, as part of the &quot;Millennium Creation Series&quot;

===21st century===
In a survey of British orchestras in 2006, Morrison described the current Philharmonia as &quot;a serious, high-quality orchestra&quot;. He praised its &quot;astute and canny&quot; management, and commented that the orchestra had a large, loyal following in London, and had gained additional support elsewhere in Britain by extending its touring programme while the Festival Hall was closed for renovation between 2005 and 2007. Since 2000 the orchestra has established further residencies: at The Anvil, Basingstoke (from 2001), the Marlowe Theatre, Canterbury and the Three Choirs Festival. Dohnányi&#x27;s final tour with the orchestra as chief conductor was of the US, where they gave concerts in Miami, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Costa Mesa, California.
In 2008 Esa-Pekka Salonen became the Philharmonia&#x27;s fifth principal conductor. He first conducted the orchestra in 1983, when he was 25, and from 1985 to 1994 he was its principal guest conductor. Vladimir Ashkenazy is the orchestra&#x27;s conductor laureate; Dohnányi is its honorary conductor for life. From 2017 Jakub Hrůša and Santtu-Matias Rouvali have been the orchestra&#x27;s principal guest conductors. The orchestra&#x27;s website reported in 2018 that Salonen and the orchestra had experimented in &quot;groundbreaking ways to present music&quot;. The examples quoted were:
The Philharmonia performs more than 160 concerts a year, more than 35 of them at the Festival Hall. It has commissioned more than a hundred works. It also records music for films, computer games and commercial CD releases. Under Salonen the orchestra has taken part in a series of projects at the Festival Hall: &quot;City of Light: Paris 1900–1950&quot; (2015), &quot;City of Dreams: Vienna 1900–1935&quot; (2009), &quot;Bill Viola&#x27;s Tristan und Isolde&quot; (2010), &quot;Infernal Dance: Inside the World of Béla Bartók&quot; (2011), &quot;Woven Words&quot;, a centenary celebration of Witold Lutosławski (2013) and &quot;Myths and Rituals&quot;, a five-concert festival of music by Igor Stravinsky (2015–17). In recent years the Philharmonia&#x27;s extensive international touring schedule has included appearances in China, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Iceland, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. Since 2017, the Philharmonia has been a resident orchestra at the Garsington Opera festival.

Salonen concluded his principal conductorship after the 2020–2021 season, and Helen Sprott stood down as its managing director. Santtu-Matias Rouvali was appointed as the next principal conductor, effective with the 2021–2022 season, with an initial contract of 5 years. Salonen took the title of conductor emeritus and became an honorary member of the orchestra.

In 2023 members of the orchestra were selected to play at the coronation of Charles III and Camilla.

==Recordings==
The orchestra&#x27;s first recording, a sinfonia by J. C. Bach, made in July 1945, was never released. Wolf&#x27;s &quot;Italian Serenade&quot; recorded at the same sessions, was the Philharmonia&#x27;s first published record. It was conducted by Walter Susskind, who made many recordings with the orchestra over the next fifteen years. In the same period, others who worked regularly with the orchestra were Alceo Galliera and Paul Kletzki. For Viennese operettas, Lovro von Matačić and Otto Ackermann were Legge&#x27;s favoured conductors.

Many of the orchestra&#x27;s highest-profile releases were operas. Within days of its inauguration the Philharmonia played in a complete recording of Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot; conducted by Constant Lambert. Among the opera sets in which the orchestra played in the 1950s were the 1952 &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; mentioned above, and six sets conducted by Karajan: &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; (1953), &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; (1954), &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; (1954), &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; (1955), &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; (1956) and &quot;Falstaff&quot; (1956). Later sets from the 1950s were &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; (Galliera, 1957); &quot;Capriccio&quot; (Sawallisch, 1957); &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; (Serafin, 1959), &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot; and &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; (both Giulini, 1959).

Other recordings by the Philharmonia in the 1940s and 1950s include Leonard Bernstein as soloist and conductor in Ravel&#x27;s Piano Concerto in G, a series of Walton&#x27;s major works, conducted by the composer, Schumann&#x27;s Piano Concerto with Dinu Lipatti as soloist and Karajan conducting (his first recording with the orchestra), Mozart&#x27;s Horn Concertos with Brain as soloist and Karajan conducting, and cycles of Beethoven and Brahms symphonies conducted by Klemperer.

In the 1960s and 1970s the orchestra made many recordings. Of those made for EMI, the company later reissued many in the series &quot;Great Recordings of the Century&quot;. They include piano concertos by Beethoven with Emil Gilels and Daniel Barenboim as soloists, Chopin with Maurizio Pollini and Mozart with Annie Fischer; symphonies by Bruckner and Mahler conducted by Barbirolli and Klemperer; orchestral music by Debussy (conducted by Giulini) and Wagner (Klemperer); choral works including Bach&#x27;s Mass in B minor, &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot;, Beethoven&#x27;s &quot; Missa solemnis&quot; and Brahms&#x27;s &quot;German Requiem&quot; under Klemperer, and Verdi&#x27;s Requiem under Giulini; Mahler&#x27;s orchestral songs sung by Christa Ludwig and Janet Baker; and in the operatic repertoire &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; conducted by Karl Böhm and &quot;Fidelio&quot; and &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot; conducted by Klemperer.

In the 1980s, in addition to the recordings made with its chief conductors, mentioned above, the orchestra recorded extensively. Recordings from this decade include the symphonies of Elgar, Vaughan Williams and Walton, conducted by Bernard Haitink for EMI; a Sibelius symphony cycle conducted by Ashkenazy and the Mozart piano concertos with Ashkenazy directing from the keyboard, for Decca; &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; with Maazel (CBS) and Fauré&#x27;s Requiem with Giulini (DG). In the last decade of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st, the orchestra&#x27;s recordings included more discs conducted by Ashkenazy, including symphonies by Beethoven and Tchaikovsky for Decca; Beethoven and Schumann symphonies with Christian Thielemann for DG, and a series of recordings of the major works of Stravinsky, and another of those of Schoenberg, conducted by Robert Craft, released on the Naxos label.

Live recordings of some of the orchestra&#x27;s early concerts have been issued on CD, including Strauss conducting the &quot;Sinfonia Domestica&quot;, Furtwängler and Flagstad in the first performance of the &quot;Four Last Songs&quot;, and Toscanini&#x27;s Brahms cycle. A later live recording was the last concert conducted by Klemperer (September 1971: Beethoven Overture: &quot;King Stephen&quot;, and Fourth Piano Concerto with Daniel Adni; and Brahms&#x27;s Third Symphony).

In 2009 the orchestra began a collaboration with the record label Signum, with the release of a live recording of Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Gurrelieder&quot;; later recordings by the Philharmonia on Signum have ranged from the symphonic repertoire (including symphonies by Beethoven, Berlioz, Brahms, Elgar, Mahler, Rachmaninoff, Schubert and Tchaikovsky) to opera and ballet (Bartók&#x27;s &quot;Duke Bluebeard&#x27;s Castle&quot; and &quot;The Miraculous Mandarin&quot;).

===Film scores===
The British Film Institute lists more than a hundred films with soundtrack scores played by the Philharmonia. They include &quot;The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby&quot; (1946); &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; and &quot;Scott of the Antarctic&quot; (1948); &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; and &quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot; (1949); &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot; (1953); &quot;Battle of the Bulge&quot; (1965); &quot; Lady Caroline Lamb&quot; (1972); &quot;King David&quot; (1985); &quot;The King and I&quot; (1999); &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (2012); and &quot;The Lady in the Van&quot; (2015).

===Voyager Golden Record===
In 1977, a recording of the first movement of Beethoven&#x27;s 5th Symphony by the Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by Klemperer was selected by NASA to be included on the Voyager Golden Record, a gold-plated copper record that was sent into space on the Voyager space craft. The record contained sounds and images which had been selected as examples of the diversity of life and culture on Earth.

<text>Mutt and Jeff were two Norwegian spies who worked for the United Kingdom and MI5 and were members of the Double Cross System.

In April 1941 two Norwegians, John &quot;Helge&quot; Moe (Mutt) and Tor Glad (Jeff) fetched up on a remote Aberdeenshire beach in Scotland, having travelled by seaplane and rubber dinghy. They immediately turned themselves in to the local police as German spies. MI5 soon &#x27;turned&#x27; them, assigning them their codenames, which were the names of a pair of cartoon strip characters (see Mutt and Jeff). &#x27;Mutt and Jeff&#x27; is also rhyming slang for &#x27;deaf&#x27;.

Mutt and Jeff&#x27;s mission was supposed to be one of sabotage, as well as having a secondary intelligence role, reporting (via wireless) military locations, deployments and civilian morale. MI5 used Mutt and Jeff&#x27;s radio sets to relay false information, leading the Germans to believe that the United Kingdom intended to invade Norway (this activity was a component of Operation Fortitude). To ensure the German handlers did not suspect Mutt and Jeff of having sold out, MI5 arranged for fake sabotage operations - supposedly the work of the pair - to take place, in one case going so far as to set off a controlled explosion at a power plant which was widely reported in the local media as a genuine attack.

Doubts about Glad&#x27;s reliability led MI5 to eventually intern him in 1943, and his radio transmissions were carried on by Moe until February 1944. By then MI5 believed that the Germans may have learned of Glad&#x27;s detention, and so the operation was brought to a close.

<text>Michelle Renee Forbes Guajardo (born January 8, 1965) is an American actress who has appeared on television and in independent films. She is a Saturn Award winner with three nominations.

Forbes first garnered attention for her dual role in the daytime soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, for which she received a Daytime Emmy Award nomination. She is known for her recurring appearances on genre and drama shows, including Ensign Ro Laren in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation and Star Trek: Picard,&quot; and her regular role as medical examiner Julianna Cox on &quot;&quot; during the 1990s. She played recurring roles throughout the 2000s in &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, &quot;24&quot;, &quot;In Treatment&quot;, &quot;Durham County&quot;, &quot;Prison Break&quot; and her series regular role as Maryann Forrester on &quot;True Blood&quot;. She has appeared in significant roles in films such as &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot;, &quot;Kalifornia&quot;, &quot;Swimming with Sharks&quot; and &quot;Columbus&quot;.

She starred in the 2011–2012 AMC television series &quot;The Killing&quot;, for which she received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination. On June 18, 2019 it was announced that Forbes would join USA Network&#x27;s action drama series &quot;Treadstone&quot;, a prequel/sequel to the &quot;Bourne&quot; franchise.

== Early life ==
Forbes was born in Austin, Texas, of Mexican American heritage.

Forbes hoped to become a ballet dancer. She began receiving formal acting training at the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts in Houston. While on vacation in New York City at the age of 16, she found herself auditioning for a film; although she was not selected, she signed with the William Morris Agency and began her professional acting career.

== Career ==

In 1987, at age 22, Forbes landed the contract role of Sonni Carrera Lewis on the daytime soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. The role was expanded to a dual role, with a second character, Solita Carrera, added. Forbes was a cast member for three years and in 1990 earned a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for her performance. She then continued in theater and began appearing in small guest roles on television to raise her profile. She went on to make guest appearances on a few other TV shows before landing the recurring role of Ensign Ro Laren in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;.

The producers of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; invited Forbes to reprise Ro in the spin-off series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; but Forbes declined the offer and decided to focus on a career in films.
She received praise, as well as a Saturn Award nomination from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films, for her performance as photographer Carrie Laughlin in the 1993 thriller &quot;Kalifornia&quot;. This was followed with the lead female role in the 1994 black comedy &quot;Swimming with Sharks&quot; as well as supporting roles in films such as &quot;The Road Killers&quot;, &quot;Just Looking&quot; and John Carpenter&#x27;s 1996 science fiction/action sequel &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot;

She continued performing on television during this period, with guest spots on &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, to which she returned to tie up the Ro Laren storyline in the series&#x27; penultimate episode.

In 1995, she played one of the leads in J. S. Cardone&#x27;s crime thriller &quot;Black Day Blue Night&quot;, alongside Mia Sara and Gil Bellows. The reviews for &quot;Black Day Blue Night&quot; were positive. Without breaking new grounds, they highlighted its strengths as a well-executed, low-budget noir with engaging performances. Greg Evans of &quot;Variety&quot; liked the film and of Forbes performance he said that it was &quot;compellingly hard-bitten&quot; and &quot;outdistance the material.&quot;

In 1996, Forbes joined the cast of NBC&#x27;s popular police drama &quot;&quot;, playing chief medical examiner Julianna Cox. She remained with the show for two years then was let go as part of a major cast overhaul (the series was canceled after one more season). However, she reprised her role in the 2000 TV special &quot;Homicide: The Movie&quot;.

That same year, Forbes became a regular on the ABC series &quot;Wonderland&quot; but it was pulled from the air after only two episodes. Forbes was next seen in a recurring role on the police drama &quot;The District&quot;.

She was subsequently given roles in films such as 2001&#x27;s &quot;Perfume&quot; and 2002&#x27;s &quot;American Girl&quot; as well as the 2001 British television film &quot;Messiah&quot; (for which she studied British sign language for a week) and its sequel installments: &quot;Messiah 2: Vengeance is Mine&quot; in 2002 and &quot;Messiah III&quot; in 2003. During the 2002–2003 TV season, Forbes played the recurring character of presidential aide Lynne Kresge on the second season of the action series &quot;24&quot;.

She followed her role on &quot;24&quot; with a guest spot on &quot;Alias&quot; then went on to play Admiral Helena Cain in three episodes of the re-imagining of the classic sci-fi series &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; as well as appearing in the television film &quot;Battlestar Galactica: Razor&quot;. She followed this up with a recurring role as Agent Samantha Brinker on the drama &quot;Prison Break&quot; and guest starred on &quot;Boston Legal&quot; and &quot;Lost&quot;.

Forbes starred as the lead in the adaptation of the comic-book &quot;Global Frequency&quot;, the single produced episode of which leaked online the following year, eight months after the series failed to be picked up by Warner Bros. networks.

Forbes returned to British television screens with guest roles in both &quot;Holby City&quot; and as a Mossad agent in &quot;Waking the Dead&quot;. In 2008, Forbes starred in two HBO drama series; &quot;In Treatment&quot;, portraying the wife of the central character, and in &quot;True Blood&quot; as a Maenad named Maryann Forrester.

She reprised her semi-regular roles in both series in their respective second seasons in 2009 as well as joining the cast of the Canadian psychological drama series &quot;Durham County&quot; for its second season as Dr. Penelope Verity.

Forbes played the role of Mitch Larsen in the US television series &quot;The Killing&quot;, a 2011 remake of the Danish crime series &quot;Forbrydelsen&quot;. Forbes appeared as Retro Girl in the TV series &quot;Powers&quot;. She also landed a prominent supporting role in &quot;The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2&quot;.

Forbes subsequently played Valerie Edwards in the TV series &quot;Berlin Station&quot; that aired on Epix from 2016 to 2019. Her character was a no-nonsense administrator who serves as a Berlin Station Internal branch chief.

In January 2021, it was announced that she would join the cast of the ABC drama &quot;Big Sky&quot; as matriarch Margaret Kleinsasser.

<text>In mathematics, linear interpolation is a method of curve fitting using linear polynomials to construct new data points within the range of a discrete set of known data points.

==Linear interpolation between two known points==

If the two known points are given by the coordinates formula_1 and the linear interpolant is the straight line between these points. For a value formula_2 in the interval the value formula_3 along the straight line is given from the equation of slopes 
formula_4
which can be derived geometrically from the figure on the right. It is a special case of polynomial interpolation with 

Solving this equation for formula_3, which is the unknown value at formula_2, gives
formula_7
which is the formula for linear interpolation in the interval Outside this interval, the formula is identical to linear extrapolation.

This formula can also be understood as a weighted average. The weights are inversely related to the distance from the end points to the unknown point; the closer point has more influence than the farther point. Thus, the weights are formula_8 and formula_9, which are normalized distances between the unknown point and each of the end points. Because these sum to 1, 
formula_10
yielding the formula for linear interpolation given above.

==Interpolation of a data set==
Linear interpolation on a set of data points is defined as piecewise linear, resulting from the concatenation of linear segment interpolants between each pair of data points. This results in a continuous curve, with a discontinuous derivative (in general), thus of differentiability class 

==Linear interpolation as an approximation==

Linear interpolation is often used to approximate a value of some function using two known values of that function at other points. The &quot;error&quot; of this approximation is defined as
formula_11
where denotes the linear interpolation polynomial defined above:
formula_12

It can be proven using Rolle&#x27;s theorem that if has a continuous second derivative, then the error is bounded by
formula_13

That is, the approximation between two points on a given function gets worse with the second derivative of the function that is approximated. This is intuitively correct as well: the &quot;curvier&quot; the function is, the worse the approximations made with simple linear interpolation become.

==History and applications==
Linear interpolation has been used since antiquity for filling the gaps in tables. Suppose that one has a table listing the population of some country in 1970, 1980, 1990 and 2000, and that one wanted to estimate the population in 1994. Linear interpolation is an easy way to do this. It is believed that it was used in the Seleucid Empire (last three centuries BC) and by the Greek astronomer and mathematician Hipparchus (second century BC). A description of linear interpolation can be found in the ancient Chinese mathematical text called &quot;The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art&quot; (九章算術), dated from 200 BC to AD 100 and the &quot;Almagest&quot; (2nd century AD) by Ptolemy.

The basic operation of linear interpolation between two values is commonly used in computer graphics. In that field&#x27;s jargon it is sometimes called a lerp (from linear interpolation). The term can be used as a verb or noun for the operation. e.g. &quot;Bresenham&#x27;s algorithm lerps incrementally between the two endpoints of the line.&quot;

Lerp operations are built into the hardware of all modern computer graphics processors. They are often used as building blocks for more complex operations: for example, a bilinear interpolation can be accomplished in three lerps. Because this operation is cheap, it&#x27;s also a good way to implement accurate lookup tables with quick lookup for smooth functions without having too many table entries.

==Extensions==
===Accuracy===

If a  function is insufficient, for example if the process that has produced the data points is known to be smoother than , it is common to replace linear interpolation with spline interpolation or, in some cases, polynomial interpolation.

===Multivariate===

Linear interpolation as described here is for data points in one spatial dimension. For two spatial dimensions, the extension of linear interpolation is called bilinear interpolation, and in three dimensions, trilinear interpolation. Notice, though, that these interpolants are no longer linear functions of the spatial coordinates, rather products of linear functions; this is illustrated by the clearly non-linear example of bilinear interpolation in the figure below. Other extensions of linear interpolation can be applied to other kinds of mesh such as triangular and tetrahedral meshes, including Bézier surfaces. These may be defined as indeed higher-dimensional piecewise linear functions (see second figure below).


==Programming language support==
Many libraries and shading languages have a &quot;lerp&quot; helper-function (in GLSL known instead as mix), returning an interpolation between two inputs codice_1 for a parameter codice_2 in the closed unit interval [0, 1]. Signatures between lerp functions are variously implemented in both the forms codice_3 and codice_4.

// Imprecise method, which does not guarantee v = v1 when t = 1, due to floating-point arithmetic error.
// This method is monotonic. This form may be used when the hardware has a native fused multiply-add instruction.
float lerp(float v0, float v1, float t) {
 return v0 + t * (v1 - v0);

// Precise method, which guarantees v = v1 when t = 1. This method is monotonic only when v0 * v1 &lt; 0.
// Lerping between same values might not produce the same value
float lerp(float v0, float v1, float t) {
 return (1 - t) * v0 + t * v1;

This lerp function is commonly used for alpha blending (the parameter &quot;&quot; is the &quot;alpha value&quot;), and the formula may be extended to blend multiple components of a vector (such as spatial &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot; axes or &quot;r&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;b&quot; colour components) in parallel.
