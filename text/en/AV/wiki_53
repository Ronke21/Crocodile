<text>Francis Joseph Thompson (16 December 1859 – 13 November 1907) was an English poet and Catholic mystic. At the behest of his father, a doctor, he entered medical school at the age of 18, but at 26 left home to pursue his talent as a writer and poet. He spent three years on the streets of London, supporting himself with menial labour, becoming addicted to opium which he took to relieve a nervous problem.

In 1888 Wilfrid and Alice Meynell read his poetry and took the opium-addicted and homeless writer into their home for a time, later publishing his first volume, &quot;Poems&quot;, in 1893. In 1897, he began writing prose, drawing inspiration from life in the countryside, Wales and Storrington. His health, always fragile, continued to deteriorate and he died of tuberculosis in 1907. By that time he had published three books of poetry, along with other works and essays.

==Early life and study==
Thompson was born in Winckley Street, Preston, Lancashire and baptized four days later in St Ignatius Church. His father, Charles, was a doctor who had converted to Roman Catholicism, following his brother Edward Healy Thompson, a friend of Cardinal Manning. Edward Healy, along with John Costall Thompson, Francis&#x27; uncles, were both authors. Francis had a brother who died in infancy, and three younger sisters.

At the age of eleven, Thompson was sent to Ushaw College, a Catholic seminary near Durham. A frail, delicate and extremely shy boy, he was described by his school fellows in 1870 as &#x27;mooney&#x27; or abstracted but happy enough. He could be recognised from afar along an &#x27;ambulacrum&#x27; or corridor by his habit of sidling sheepishly along the wall with the collar of his coat turned up. Most of his leisure time was spent in the college library where he was fond of history and poetry books. It was noticed that despite the distractions in the library of catapult fights and general mayhem, he had the ability to shut himself off and continue to be absorbed in his reading.

As he advanced up the college he became more skilled at writing and his friends remembered that out of twenty examination essays he obtained first place on sixteen occasions. Once he was punished with a beating for being the last boy to be ready for PE drill. He had no interest in Mathematics and, in his final exam, he came last. The only sport in which he developed an interest was Handball and it is said he achieved a standard above the average. He became a connoisseur of cricket though he rarely participated. In preparation for Ushaw College&#x27;s centenary celebrations due to take place in 1908, Thompson, by then a celebrated poet, was approached to write a Jubilee Ode to mark the occasion. The poet was delighted that the assignment had been offered to him and it is said that he looked forward to seeing his &#x27;College home&#x27; once more. His death, however, in 1907 meant that the commission was never carried out.

Thompson studied medicine for nearly eight years at Owens College, now the University of Manchester. While excelling in essay writing, he took no interest in his medical studies; he had a passion for poetry and for watching cricket matches. He never practised as a doctor, and tried to enlist as a soldier but was rejected for his slightness of stature. Then in 1885 he fled, penniless, to London, where he tried to make a living as a writer, in the meantime taking odd jobs – working for a bootmaker (John McMaster of Panton Street) and booksellers, and selling matches. During this time, he became addicted to opium, which he had first taken as medicine for ill health, having experienced a nervous breakdown while still in Manchester. He lived on the streets of Charing Cross and slept by the River Thames, with the homeless and other addicts. He was turned down by Oxford University, not because he was unqualified, but because of his addiction. Thompson contemplated suicide in his nadir of despair, but was saved from completing the action through a vision which he believed to be that of a youthful poet Thomas Chatterton, who had committed suicide over a century earlier. A prostitute, whose identity Thompson never revealed, befriended him and gave him lodgings. Thompson later described her in his poetry as his saviour.

==Writing career==
In 1888, after three years on the streets, he was &#x27;discovered&#x27; after sending his poetry to the magazine &quot;Merrie England&quot;. He was sought out by the magazine&#x27;s editors, Wilfrid and Alice Meynell, who recognised the value of his work. They took him into their home and, concerned about his opium addiction which was at its height following his years on the streets, sent him to Our Lady of England Priory, Storrington, for a couple of years. He continued to take opium but in small doses at irregular intervals, to relieve nerve pain.

Francis wrote most of his poetry during this period from 1888 – 1897, after which he turned to writing prose. He struck up a good relationship with the Meynells who, parents and children, furnished inspiration for some of his poetry. They arranged for publication of his first book &quot;Poems&quot; in 1893. The book attracted the attention of sympathetic critics in the &quot;St James&#x27;s Gazette&quot; and other newspapers, and Coventry Patmore wrote a eulogistic notice in the &quot;Fortnightly Review&quot; of January 1894. Francis&#x27; poem &quot;The Hound of Heaven&quot; was called by the Bishop of London &quot;one of the most tremendous poems ever written,&quot; and by critics &quot;the most wonderful lyric in the language,&quot; while the &quot;Times&quot; of London declared that people will still be learning it 200 years hence. His verse continued to elicit high praise from critics right up to his last volume in 1897. His selected poems published in 1908 contains about 50 pieces in all. Notable among his prose works are an essay on Shelley, &quot;The Life of St. Ignatius&quot;, and &quot;Health and Holiness&quot;.

==Later life and death==
Thompson moved around frequently, subsequently living near Pantasaph, Flintshire, in Wales and at Storrington. A lifetime of poverty, ill-health, and opium addiction had taken their toll on him, even though he found success in his last years.

Thompson died from tuberculosis at the age of 47, in the Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth, and is buried in St. Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Cemetery in Kensal Green. His tomb bears the last line from a poem he wrote for his godson, a Meynell: &quot;Look for me in the nurseries of Heaven&quot;.

==Style and influence==

His most famous poem, &quot;The Hound of Heaven&quot;, describes the pursuit of the human person by God. The playwright Eugene O’Neill could recite it from memory.

In 2002, Katherine A. Powers, literary columnist for the &quot;Boston Globe,&quot; called &quot;Hound of Heaven&quot; &quot;perhaps the most beloved and ubiquitously taught poem among American Catholics for over half a century,&quot; adding that Thompson&#x27;s other poetry lost its popularity amidst anti-Modernism in the Catholic church during most of the twentieth century. However, she agrees that the dawning century is more akin to his spirit: &quot;His medical training and life on the streets gave him a gritty view of reality and a social conscience, and his governing idea that God is immanent in all things and in all experience, so vexatious to both Victorians and the Vatican alike, no longer strikes an alien or heretical note.&quot;

G. K. Chesterton said shortly after his death that &quot;with Francis Thompson we lost the greatest poetic energy since Browning.&quot; Among Thompson&#x27;s devotees was the young J. R. R. Tolkien, who purchased a volume of Thompson&#x27;s works in 1913–1914, and later said that it was an important influence on his own writing.

Phrases from his poetry have been lifted by others and made famous. The U.S. Supreme Court in Brown II used &quot;with all deliberate speed&quot; for the remedy sought in their famous decision on school desegregation. A phrase in &quot;The Kingdom of God&quot; is the source of the title of Han Suyin&#x27;s novel &quot;A Many-Splendoured Thing&quot;. In addition, Thompson wrote the most famous cricket poem, the nostalgic &quot;At Lord&#x27;s&quot;. He also wrote &quot; The Poppy &quot; (1893), &quot;Sister Songs&quot; (1895), &quot;New Poems&quot; (1897), and a posthumously published essay, &quot;Shelley&quot; (1909).

Halliday Sutherland borrowed the second line of &quot;The Hound of Heaven&quot; for the title of his 1933 autobiographical best-seller &quot;The Arches of the Years&quot;. The American novelist Madeleine L&#x27;Engle used a line from the poem &quot;The Mistress of Vision&quot; as the title of her last Vicki Austin novel, &quot;Troubling a Star&quot;. The self-realized poet-yogi, Paramahansa Yogananda, was fond of quoting Thompson&#x27;s &quot;The Hound of Heaven&quot; poem,

Bishop Fulton J. Sheen quoted lines from Ex Ore Infantium in his &quot;The True Meaning of Christmas&quot; episode in 1956.

In 2012, Chris Ward&#x27;s biographical filmscript, &quot;Hound: Visions in the Life of the Victorian poet Francis Thompson&quot; was staged at the Riverside Studios, Hammersmith and following that the stage version was taken on a tour of London&#x27;s churches including St Giles-in-the Fields and in St Olav&#x27;s (City of London) in May 2014. A film of &quot;Hound&quot; based on the life of Francis Thompson has been made into feature film with a cast including Wayne Sleep, Toyah Willcox and Hazel O&#x27;Connor, and with Francis Thompson played by Daniel Hutchinson.

==Legacy==
Thompson&#x27;s birthplace, in Winckley Street, Preston, is marked by a memorial plaque. The inscription reads: &quot;Francis Thompson poet was born in this house 16 Dec 1859. &quot;Ever and anon a trumpet sounds, From the hid battlements of eternity.&quot;&quot; The home in Ashton-under-Lyne where Thompson lived from 1864 to 1885 was also marked with a blue plaque. In 2014, however, the building collapsed.

<doc id="162163" wikidata="Q891252" url="?curid=162163" title="Boland Amendment">
<text>The Boland Amendment is a term describing a series of U.S. legislative amendments passed between 1982 and 1986, aimed at limiting U.S. government assistance to the Contras in Nicaragua. The Reagan Administration supplied funding and military training to the Contras until revelations of human rights abuses led Congress to cut off aid through the Boland Amendment. The Boland Amendment was passed over a series of five legislative amendments that increasingly restricted forms of aids and the source of the aid. 

The most significant effect of the Boland Amendment was the Iran–Contra affair, during which the Reagan Administration circumvented the Amendment in order to continue supplying arms to the Contras. This was achieved by funneling money to the Contras that was generated by secret arms sales to Iran. When revealed to the public, Congress attempted to prosecute Vice Admiral John M. Poindexter, U.S. Navy (USN), and his deputy, Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North, U.S. Marine Corps (USMC), for their direct role in the affair. President Ronald Reagan, while implicated, was not directly linked to the affair and avoided similar attempts at prosecution.

==Background==
During the early years of the Reagan administration, a civil war raged in Nicaragua, pitting the communist revolutionary Sandinista government against Contra rebel groups. The Reagan Administration and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), led by William Casey, covertly supported the Contras through funding and military training. Public knowledge of routine human rights abusees committed by the Contra rebels led to the passage of the Boland Amendment by Congress, which cut off any appropriated funding for the Contras that would be used for the purpose of overthrowing the Nicaraguan government. 

The Boland Amendment, proposed by Edward Boland, was a compromise because the Democrats did not have enough votes for a comprehensive ban. The Amendment gained traction due to widespread opposition among the American public to funding the Contras as opposition to funding the Contras hovered around two to one. It covered only appropriated funds spent by intelligence agencies (such as the CIA). Some of Reagan&#x27;s national security officials used non-appropriated money spent by the National Security Council (NSC) to circumvent the Amendment. No court ever made a determination whether the Amendment covered the NSC. Supporters of the NSC actions claimed that the Boland Amendment violated the Constitution by violating the separation of powers principle, while opponents claimed that the Amendment passed in the constitutionally proscribed manner and the principle of separation of powers was not a legal defense. Congress later resumed aid to the Contras, totaling over $300 million. The Sandinistas were voted out of power in 1990 with the election of opposition leader Violeta Chamorro over the Sandinista candidate, Daniel Ortega.

The Boland Amendment prohibited the federal government from providing military support that would be used to overthrow the Government of Nicaragua. It aimed to prevent CIA funding of rebels opposed to the revolutionary provisional junta. The Amendment sought to block Reagan administration support for the Contra rebels, but the amendment was narrowly interpreted by the Reagan administration to apply to only U.S. intelligence agencies, allowing the National Security Council (NSC), which is not labeled an intelligence agency, to channel funds to the Contra rebels. To block the funding through the NSC, the amendment was changed to prohibit any funds for military or paramilitary operations.

== The Boland Amendment ==
The first Boland Amendment outlawed U.S. assistance from the CIA and Department of Defense (DOD), to the Contras for the purpose of overthrowing the communist Nicaraguan government, while allowing assistance for other purposes. The Amendment was part of the House Appropriations Bill of 1982, which was attached as a rider to the Defense Appropriations Act of 1983, named for the Massachusetts Democrat, Representative Edward Boland, who authored it. The House of Representatives passed the Defense Appropriations Act 411–0 on December 8, 1982, and it was signed by President Ronald Reagan on December 21, 1982.

The four following legislative amendments adjusted the scope of the first Boland Amendment. The Intelligence Authorization Act, passed December 9, 1983, limited the existing obligations of the CIA and DOD to the Contras to $24 million and expanded the act to include direct or indirect support for any Nicaraguan group or individual. On October 3, 1984, aid was completely cut to the Contras and all entities of the United States government were prohibited from providing aid, expanding the prohibition from just the CIA and DOD. The fourth amendment, encompassing 1985-1986, provided $27 million in humanitarian aid to the Contras, and the fifth and final form of the amendment in June 1986, provided $100 million in aid to the Contras.

== Relationship to Iran-Contra Affair ==
Officials in the Reagan Administration argued that the Boland Amendment, or any act of Congress, could not interfere with the president&#x27;s conduct of foreign policy. This represented the culmination of an ongoing struggle between Congress and the President over the power of foreign policy. Since the end of World War II, Congress had taken steps to curtail unilateral foreign policy moves by the President. Two clear examples of this are the 1973 War Powers Act, which required Congressional approval of troop commitments lasting longer than thirty days, and the 1974 Hughes-Ryan Amendment, which required a Presidential report to Congress concerning the necessity of all covert operations. The Boland Amendment represented another attempt by Congress to restrict Presidential power. The resistance of the Reagan administration via its circumvention was the flip-side of this power struggle. 

In this spirit, administration officials argued that the Boland Amendment, or any act of Congress, could not interfere with the president&#x27;s conduct of foreign policy by restricting funds, as the president could seek funds from private entities or foreign governments. In this spirit, and despite the Boland Amendment, Vice Admiral John M. Poindexter, USN, and his deputy, Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North, USMC, secretly diverted to the Nicaraguan contras millions of dollars in funds received from a secret deal that some alleged had explicit presidential approvalthe sales of anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles to Iran in spite of Reagan&#x27;s public pledge not to deal with terrorists.

On Monday, November 3rd 1986, a pro-Syrian newspaper in Lebanon, Ash-Shiraa, revealed the secret deal to the world and The New York Times picked it up a day later on Tuesday, US election day. This came as Democrats won back control of the Senate in the 1986 elections. In public hearings of a joint House–Senate committee convened for purposes of investigating the affair, Democrats sought to prosecute North for his role. The final report published after the hearings blamed Reagan&#x27;s passive style of leadership for allowing the conduct of foreign policy without involvement of any elected official.

==Legislature chronology==
A chronology from John Negroponte.

In December 1982 H.J.RES.631 became public law 97-377 making further continuing appropriations for the fiscal year 1983. The amendment S.UP.AMDT.1542 by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, which aimed to prohibit the use of funds by the CIA or DOD to support military activities in Nicaragua, fell. Amendment S.UP.AMDT.1541 by Senator Christopher J. Dodd &quot;to declare Congressional support for restrictions on certain types of operations in Central America&quot; was tabled.

But H.R.7355 made appropriations for the Department of Defense and amendment H.AMDT.974 to it by Representative Edward P. Boland passed with a recorded vote of 411–0 to prohibit the CIA or Defense Department to use the funds of the bill for military purposes in Nicaragua.

In December 1983, for the fiscal year 1984, H.R.4185, sponsored by Representative Joseph P. Addabbo, which became public law 98-212, and H.R.2968, sponsored by Boland, which became public law 98-215, limited the amount to be spent for military purposes in Nicaragua. Amendment H.AMDT.461 by Boland to H.R. 2968 prohibited covert assistance for military operations in Nicaragua.

In December 1984, for fiscal year 1985, H.J.RES.648, became public law 98-473, and prohibited funds available to the CIA and the DOD from being used in Nicaragua for military purposes. This legislation read: &quot;During fiscal year 1985, no funds available to the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, or any other agency or entity of the United States involved in intelligence activities may be obligated or expended for the purpose or which would have the effect of supporting, directly or indirectly, military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua by any nation, group, organization, movement or individual.&quot; This legislation also provided that after February 28, 1985, if the President made a report to Congress specifying certain criteria, including the need to provide further assistance for &quot;military or paramilitary operations&quot; prohibited by this statute, he could expend $14 million in funds if Congress passed a joint resolution approving such action.&quot;

In December 1985, for fiscal year 1986, S.960 became public law 99-83 and also excluded military use for funds to be spent in Nicaragua.

<doc id="162165" wikidata="Q747489" url="?curid=162165" title="Cyrix">
<text>Cyrix Corporation was a microprocessor developer that was founded in 1988 in Richardson, Texas, as a specialist supplier of floating point units for 286 and 386 microprocessors. The company was founded by Tom Brightman and Jerry Rogers.

In 1992, Cyrix introduced its own i386 compatible processors, the 486SLC and 486DLC. These had higher performance than the Intel parts, but a lower price. They were primarily marketed to users looking to upgrade existing machines. Their release sparked a lengthy series of lawsuits with Intel while their foundry partner IBM was releasing the same designs under their own branding.

The combination of these events led Cyrix to begin losing money, and the company merged with National Semiconductor on 11 November 1997. National released Cyrix&#x27;s latest designs under the MediaGX name and then an updated version as Geode in 1999. National sold the line to AMD in August 2003 where it was known as Geode. The line was discontinued in 2019.

== History ==
At the end of March in 1992, the Cyrix Cx486SLC was released. It was a x86 microprocessor that was pin compatible with the 386SX and made for notebook computer applications. Following up shortly after in June 1992, the Cx486DLC was released, a desktop version of the SLC that was pin-compatible with the 386DX. 

== Products ==
=== Cyrix FasMath coprocessors ===
The first Cyrix product for the personal computer market was a x87 compatible FPU coprocessor. The Cyrix FasMath 83D87 and 83S87 were introduced in November 1989. The 83D87 was pin compatible with the Intel 80387, while the 83S87 was pin compatible with the 80387SX. Both provided up to 50% more performance, and additionally they had lower power consumption when idle, due to a low power operation. Upon release the 83S87 cost $506 for a 16-MHz version and $556 for a 20-MHz version. The Cyrix FasMath 82S87, a 80287-compatible chip, was developed from the Cyrix 83D87 and has been available since 1991.

=== 486 ===

Its early CPU products included the 486SLC and 486DLC, released in 1992, which, despite their names, were pin-compatible with the 386SX and DX, respectively. While they added an on-chip L1 cache and the 486 instruction set, performance-wise, they were somewhere between the 386 and the 486. The chips were mostly used as upgrades by end users looking to improve performance of an aging 386 and especially by dealers, who by changing the CPU could turn slow-selling 386 boards into budget 486 boards. The chips were widely criticized in product reviews for not offering the performance suggested by their names, and for the confusion caused by their naming similarity with Intel&#x27;s SL line and IBM&#x27;s SLC line of CPUs, neither of which was related to Cyrix&#x27;s SLC. The chips did see use in very low-cost PC clones and in laptops.

Cyrix would later release the Cyrix 486SRX2 and 486DRX2, which were essentially clock-doubled versions of the SLC and DLC, marketed exclusively to consumers as 386-to-486 upgrades. Unlike the SLC/DLC, these chips contained internal cache coherency circuitry which made the chips compatible with older 386 motherboards that did not have extra circuitry or BIOS routines to keep the cache current.

Eventually, Cyrix was able to release the Cyrix Cx486S and later Cyrix Cx486DX that was pin-compatible with its Intel 486 counterparts. However, the chips were later to market than AMD&#x27;s 486s and benchmarked slightly slower than AMD and Intel counterparts, which relegated them to the budget and upgrade market. While AMD had been able to sell some of its 486s to large OEMs, notably Acer and Compaq, Cyrix had not. The Cyrix chips did gain some following with upgraders, as their 50-, 66-, and 80 MHz 486 CPUs ran at 5 V, rather than the 3.3 V used by AMD, making the Cyrix chips usable as upgrades in early 486 motherboards.

=== Cyrix 5x86 ===

In 1995, with its Pentium clone not yet ready to ship, Cyrix repeated its own history and released the Cyrix Cx5x86 (M1sc), which plugged into a 3.3V 486 socket, ran at 80, 100, 120, or 133 MHz, and yielded performance comparable to that of a Pentium running at 75 MHz. Cyrix 5x86 (M1sc) was a cost-reduced version of the flagship 6x86 (M1). Like Intel&#x27;s Pentium Overdrive, the Cyrix 5x86 used a 32-bit external data bus. 
While AMD&#x27;s Am5x86 was little more than a clock-quadrupled 486 with a new name, Cyrix&#x27;s 5x86 implemented some Pentium-like features.

=== Cyrix 6x86 ===

Later in 1995, Cyrix released its best-known chip, the Cyrix 6x86 (M1). This processor continued the Cyrix tradition of making faster replacements for Intel designed sockets. However, the 6x86 was the star performer in the range, giving a claimed performance boost over the Intel &quot;equivalent&quot;. 6x86 processors were given names such as P166+ indicating a performance better than a Pentium 166 MHz processor. In fact, the 6x86 processor was clocked at a significantly lower speed than the Pentium counterpart it outperformed. Initially, Cyrix tried to charge a premium for the Cyrix-claimed extra performance, but the 6x86&#x27;s math coprocessor was not as fast as that in the Intel Pentium. The main difference was not one of actual computing performance on the coprocessor, but a lack of instruction pipelining. Due to the increasing popularity of first-person 3D games, Cyrix was forced to lower its prices. While the 6x86 quickly gained a following among computer enthusiasts and independent computer shops, unlike AMD, its chips had yet to be used by a major OEM customer. The game in question causing most problems for performance was Id Software&#x27;s &quot;Quake&quot;. Unlike previous 3D games, &quot;Quake&quot; used the pipelined Pentium FPU to do perspective correction calculations in the background while texture mapping, effectively doing two tasks at once. This would not have been a big problem for the 6x86 if, by that time, &quot;Quake&quot; had a fallback to do perspective correction without the FPU as in, for example, the game &quot;Descent&quot;. However, id Software chose not to include this. &quot;Quake&quot; also lacked the option to disable perspective correction, thus eliminating that potential speed boost for FPU-weak CPUs. This potential speed boost would have benefited not just Cyrix&#x27;s users, but also users of AMD&#x27;s K5 and especially of the 486. &quot;Quake&quot;s optimization for the Pentium went beyond FPU usage and catered to a number of other architectural quirks specific to the Pentium, further hindering performance of other CPUs even outside FPU operations. This bias in favor of the Pentium served to boost the popularity of Intel&#x27;s Pentium CPUs amongst the computer game community.

=== Cyrix 6x86L and 6x86MX ===

The later 6x86L was a revised 6x86 that consumed less power, and the 6x86MX (M2) added MMX instructions and a larger L1 cache. The Cyrix MII, based on the 6x86MX design, was little more than a name change intended to help the chip compete better with the Pentium II.

=== Cyrix MediaGX ===

In 1996, Cyrix released the MediaGX CPU, which integrated all of the major discrete components of a PC, including sound and video, onto one chip. Initially based on the old 5x86 technology and running at 120 or 133 MHz, its performance was widely criticized but its low price made it successful. The MediaGX led to Cyrix&#x27;s first big win, with Compaq using it in its lowest-priced Presario 2100 and 2200 computers. This led to further MediaGX sales to Packard Bell and also seemed to give Cyrix legitimacy, with 6x86 sales to both Packard Bell and eMachines following.

Later versions of the MediaGX ran at speeds of up to 333 MHz and added MMX support. A second chip was added to extend its video capabilities.

=== Cyrix Media GXi, Jedi, and Gobi Cayenne ===

Cyrix developed the Cayenne core as an evolution of the 6x86MX/MII processor, with dual issue FPU, support for 3DNow instructions and a 256 KB, 8-way associative, on-die L2 cache. This core was intended to be used in multiple products, including a successor to the MediaGX chip, a product codenamed Jedi which was to be a Socket 7 compatible processor which was later cancelled in favor of a Socket 370 compatible processor codenamed Gobi.

The Media GXi implementation was released in February 1997; intended for the mobile computing market, it had clock speeds of 120 Mhz to 180 Mhz, and had integrated graphics and audio controllers, making it useful for compact notebook computers. Later that year, Cyrix was acquired by National Semiconductor.

=== Cyrix M3 Jalapeno ===

This was a completely new core with a dual issue FPU, register renaming and out-of-order execution based on an 11-stage pipeline and 8-way associative, 8-way interleaved fully pipelined 256K L2 cache operating at core frequency.

Jalapeño&#x27;s new floating point unit had dual independent FPU/MMX units and included both a fully pipelined, independent x87 adder and x87 multiplier. The Jalapeño design facilitated close integration between the core and the advanced 3D graphics engine, which was one of the first graphics subsystems to utilize a dual-issue FPU. The dual FPUs supported execution of both MMX and 3DNow instructions.

Jalepeno had an on-die memory controller based on RAMBUS technology capable of 3.2 GB/s to reduce memory latency and an integrated on-board 3D graphics which purportedly could process up to 3 million polygons per second and 266 million pixels per second based on a 233 Mhz clock. The on-die graphics had access to the L2 cache of the CPU to store textures. The design&#x27;s initial clock speed target was 600-800 Mhz with headroom to scale to 1 Ghz and beyond. It was due to begin production in Q4 1999 and launch in the year 2000 on a 0.18 micron process with a die size of 110–120 mm2.

It is unclear how advanced development on this core was when Cyrix was acquired from National Semiconductor by VIA Technologies and the project discontinued. VIA did, however, continue producing late-generation Cyrix chips under the name VIA Cyrix III (also known as Cyrix 3).

=== PR system ===

Because the 6x86 was more efficient on an instructions-per-cycle basis than Intel&#x27;s Pentium, and because Cyrix sometimes used a faster bus speed than either Intel or AMD, Cyrix and competitor AMD co-developed the controversial Performance Rating (PR) system in an effort to compare their products more favorably with Intel&#x27;s. Since a 6x86 running at 133 MHz generally benchmarked slightly faster than a Pentium running at 166 MHz, the 133 MHz 6x86 was marketed as the 6x86-P166+. Legal action from Intel, who objected to the use of the strings &quot;P166&quot; and &quot;P200&quot; in non-Pentium products, led to Cyrix adding the letter &quot;R&quot; to its names.

The PR nomenclature was controversial because while Cyrix&#x27;s chips generally outperformed Intel&#x27;s when running productivity applications, on a clock-for-clock basis its chips were slower for floating point operations, so the PR system performed more poorly when running the newest games. Additionally, since the 6x86&#x27;s price encouraged its use in budget systems, performance could drop even further when compared with Pentium systems that were using faster hard drives, video cards, sound cards, and modems.

Although AMD also used the PR numbers for its early K5 chips, it soon abandoned that nomenclature with the introduction of the K6. However, it would use a similar concept in marketing its later CPUs, starting again with the Athlon XP.

== Manufacturing partners ==

Cyrix had always been a fabless company: Cyrix designed and sold their own chips, but contracted the actual semiconductor manufacturing to an outside foundry. In the early days, Cyrix mostly used Texas Instruments production facilities and SGS Thomson (now STMicroelectronics). The Richardson, Texas office of VLSI Technology was also instrumental, as they provided workstations, EDA tools and ASIC design expertise to Cyrix engineers for their early design work. In 1994, following a series of disagreements with TI, and production difficulties at SGS Thomson, Cyrix turned to IBM Microelectronics, whose production technology rivaled that of Intel.

As part of the manufacturing agreement between the two companies, IBM received the right to build and sell Cyrix-designed CPUs under the IBM name. While some in the industry speculated this would lead to IBM using 6x86 CPUs extensively in its product line and improve Cyrix&#x27;s reputation, IBM continued to mostly use Intel CPUs, and to a lesser extent, AMD CPUs, in the majority of its products and only used the Cyrix designs in a few budget models, mostly sold outside of the United States. IBM instead sold its 6x86 chips on the open market, competing directly against Cyrix and sometimes undercutting Cyrix&#x27;s prices.

== Legal troubles ==

Unlike AMD, Cyrix had never manufactured or sold Intel designs under a negotiated license. Cyrix&#x27;s designs were the result of meticulous in-house reverse engineering, and often made significant advances in the technology while still being socket compatible with Intel&#x27;s products. In Cyrix&#x27;s first product, the 8087 math co-processor, Cyrix used hardware math multipliers rather than the CORDIC algorithm, which allowed the chip to be faster and more accurate than Intel&#x27;s co-processor. Thus, while AMD&#x27;s 386s and even 486s had some Intel-written microcode software, Cyrix&#x27;s designs were completely independent. Focused on removing potential competitors, Intel spent many years in legal battles with Cyrix, consuming Cyrix financial resources, claiming that the Cyrix 486 violated Intel&#x27;s patents, when in reality the design was proven independent.

Intel lost the Cyrix case, which included multiple lawsuits in both federal and state courts in Texas. Some of the matters were settled out-of-court and some of the matters were settled by the court. In the end after all appeals, the courts ruled that Cyrix had the right to produce their own x86 designs in any foundry that held an Intel license. Cyrix was found to never have infringed any patent held by Intel. Intel feared having to face the antitrust claims made by Cyrix, so Intel paid Cyrix $12 million to settle the antitrust claims right before a federal jury in Sherman, Texas, was to hear and rule on the antitrust claims. As a part of the settlement of the antitrust claims against Intel, Cyrix also received a license to some of the patents that Intel had asserted that Cyrix infringed. Cyrix was free to have their products manufactured by any manufacturer that had a cross-license with Intel, which included SGS Thomson, IBM, and others. Intel had pursued IBM Microelectronics and SGS Thomson, both acting as foundries for Cyrix, with the rights of both IBM and SGS Thomson being upheld in separate legal judgements.

The follow-on 1997 Cyrix–Intel litigation was the reverse: instead of Intel claiming that Cyrix 486 chips violated their patents, now Cyrix claimed that Intel&#x27;s Pentium Pro and Pentium II violated Cyrix patents – in particular, the power-management and register-renaming techniques. The case was expected to drag on for years but was settled quite promptly, by another mutual cross-license agreement. Intel and Cyrix now had full and free access to each others&#x27; patents. The settlement did not say whether the Pentium Pro violated Cyrix patents or not; it simply allowed Intel to carry on making products under a license from Cyrix.

== Merger with National Semiconductor ==

In August 1997, while the litigation was still in progress, Cyrix merged with National Semiconductor (who also already held an Intel cross-license). This provided Cyrix with an extra marketing arm and access to National Semiconductor fabrication plants, which were originally constructed to produce RAM and high-speed telecommunications equipment. Since the manufacture of RAM and CPUs are similar, industry analysts at the time believed the marriage made sense. The IBM manufacturing agreement remained for a while longer, but Cyrix eventually switched all their production over to National&#x27;s plant. The merger improved Cyrix&#x27;s financial base and gave them much better access to development facilities.

The merger also resulted in a change of emphasis: National Semiconductor&#x27;s priority was single-chip budget devices like the MediaGX, rather than higher-performance chips like the 6x86 and MII. Whether National Semiconductor doubted Cyrix&#x27;s ability to produce high-performance chips or feared competing with Intel at the high end of the market is open to debate. The MediaGX, with no direct competition in the marketplace and with continual pressure on OEMs to release lower-cost PCs, looked like the safer bet.

National Semiconductor ran into financial trouble soon after the Cyrix merger, and these problems hurt Cyrix as well. By 1999, AMD and Intel were leapfrogging one another in clock speeds, reaching 450 MHz and beyond, while Cyrix took almost a year to push the MII from PR-300 to PR-333. Neither chip actually ran at 300+ MHz. A problem suffered by many of the MII models was that they used a non-standard 83 MHz bus. The vast majority of Socket 7 motherboards used a fixed 1/2 divider to clock the PCI bus, normally at 30 MHz or 33 MHz. With the MII&#x27;s 83 MHz bus, this resulted in the PCI bus running alarmingly out-of-spec at 41.5 MHz. At this speed, many PCI devices could become unstable or fail to operate. Some motherboards supported a 1/3 divider, which resulted in the Cyrix PCI bus running at 27.7 MHz. This was more stable, but adversely affected system performance. The problem was only fixed in the final few models, which supported a 100 MHz bus. Almost all of the 6x86 line produced a large amount of heat, and required quite large (for the time) heatsink/fan combinations to run properly. There was also a problem which made the 6x86 incompatible with the then-popular Sound Blaster AWE64 sound card. Only 32 of its potential 64-voice polyphony could be utilized, as the WaveSynth/WG software synthesizer relied on a Pentium-specific instruction which the 6x86 lacked. Meanwhile, the MediaGX faced pressure from Intel&#x27;s and AMD&#x27;s budget chips, which also continued to get less expensive while offering greater performance. Cyrix, whose processors had been considered a performance product in 1996, had fallen to the mid-range, then to the entry level, and then to the fringe of the entry level, and was in danger of completely losing its market.

The last Cyrix-badged microprocessor was the Cyrix MII-433GP which ran at 300 MHz (100 × 3) and performed faster than an AMD K6/2-300 on FPU calculations (as benched with Dr. Hardware). However, this chip was regularly pitted against actual 433 MHz processors from other manufacturers. Arguably this made the comparison unfair, even though it was directly invited by Cyrix&#x27;s own marketing.

National Semiconductor distanced itself from the CPU market, and without direction, the Cyrix engineers left one by one. By the time National Semiconductor sold Cyrix to VIA Technologies, the design team was no more and the market for the MII had disappeared. Via used the Cyrix name on a chip designed by Centaur Technology, since Via believed Cyrix had better name recognition than Centaur, or possibly even VIA.

Cyrix&#x27;s failure is described by Glenn Henry, CEO of Centaur Technology, thus: &quot;Cyrix had a good product, but they got bought by a &#x27;big smokestack&#x27; company and they got bloated. When VIA bought Cyrix, they had 400, and we had 60, and we were turning out more product.&quot;

National Semiconductor retained the MediaGX design for a few more years, renaming it the Geode and hoping to sell it as an integrated processor. They sold the Geode to AMD in 2003.

In June 2006, AMD unveiled the world&#x27;s lowest-power x86-compatible processor that consumed only 0.9 W of power. This processor was based on the Geode core, demonstrating that Cyrix&#x27;s architectural ingenuity still survived.

== Legacy ==
Although the company was short-lived and the brand name is no longer actively used by its current owner, Cyrix&#x27;s competition with Intel created the market for budget CPUs, which cut the average selling price of PCs and ultimately forced Intel to release its Celeron line of budget processors and cut the prices of its faster processors more quickly in order to compete.

Additionally, the acquisition of Cyrix&#x27;s intellectual property and agreements would be used by VIA Technologies to defend itself from its own legal troubles with Intel, even after VIA stopped using the Cyrix name.

==In popular media==
The film &quot;Eraser&quot; featured a defense corporation known as &quot;Cyrex&quot;. Cyrix became concerned about the potential name conflict, and contacted the film production company. The name was then retroactively digitally edited to become &quot;Cyrez&quot; to avoid any confusion.

In the machinima series &quot;Freeman&#x27;s Mind&quot;, Ross Scott as Gordon Freeman (of the &quot;Half-Life&quot; video game franchise) curses Cyrix processors as a computer breaks in Episode 3.

<text>Guglielmo Papaleo (Middletown - September 19, 1922 – November 23, 2006) was an American professional boxer, better known as Willie Pep, who held the World Featherweight championship twice between the years of 1942 and 1950.

Papaleo was born in an Italian family: his father, Salvatore, was from Rosolini, whereas his mother, Maria Marchese, was from Melilli.

Pep boxed a total of 1,956 rounds in the 241 bouts during his 26-year career, a considerable number of rounds and bouts even for a fighter of his era. His final record was 229–11–1 with 65 knockouts. Pep, known for his speed, finesse and elusiveness, is considered to be one of the best fighters of the 20th century; after his 199th win, Kid Campeche described his experience by saying, &quot;Fighting Willie Pep is like trying to stomp out a grass fire.&quot; Pep was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1990. Pep was voted as the No. 1 featherweight of the 20th century by the Associated Press and ranked the No. 1 featherweight of all time by the International Boxing Research Organization in 2005. He is currently ranked by BoxRec as the 28th greatest pound-for-pound fighter of all time.

==Boxing career==

===Amateur career===
Pep first fought as an amateur in 1937. At the time, amateur boxers from Connecticut were allowed to fight for money. It was during the Great Depression and Pep&#x27;s father was earning $15 per week at the Works Progress Administration. Pep worked as a shoeshine boy in downtown Hartford alongside Johnny Duke. Both boys joined a gym together and became sparring partners. Willie was soon earning more in one night of fighting each week. When his parents found out he was boxing, his mother was worried for him, but his father said that if he was making so much fighting on Fridays, maybe he should see about fighting on Tuesdays as well. &quot;My old man, he was a sports fan&quot; Pep later quipped.

In 1938 Pep fought Sugar Ray Robinson in the attic of a feed store in Norwich, Connecticut. According to Pep&#x27;s later telling, Robinson was an amateur champion in the state of New York, where amateurs were not paid, so he took a pseudonym to get bouts for money in Connecticut. Because of this, Pep did not know who he was fighting at the time. Before the fight he was told his unknown opponent was not good, but he recalls quickly learning otherwise once the bout began and Robinson was &quot;all over me&quot;.

===Professional career===
Pep started boxing professionally on July 10, 1940, beating James McGovern by a decision in four rounds in Hartford, Connecticut. Like many boxers of the first half of the 20th century, Pep concentrated his early fighting career on boxing in New England, and he split his first 25 contests between Connecticut and Massachusetts. He was undefeated during that span and for fight number 26, he finally headed west, beating Eddie Flores by a knockout in the first round at Thompsonville, Michigan. A couple of fights later, he travelled further west and made his California debut, beating Billy Spencer by a decision in four rounds at Los Angeles.

By the time Pep stepped up his quality of opposition he was undefeated at 41–0, and he met former world champion Joey Archibald in 1942. He beat Archibald by a decision in ten rounds and, in his next bout, challenged Abe Denner for the New England-area featherweight title. He won the fight by a decision in 12, and his status among the world&#x27;s top featherweights continued to climb. He won ten more bouts to reach 52–0, including a rematch win over Archibald, before he was given his first world championship try, in October. He became the World Featherweight Champion by outpointing the defending world champ Chalky Wright over the 15 round distance. He fought twice more to finish the year, winning both by knockout.

Pep began 1943 by winning six bouts in a row to find himself with a record of 62–0. But in his seventh bout of 1943, he suffered his first defeat, at the hands of Sammy Angott, another world champion boxer. Angott beat Pep over the ten round distance, by decision. Ten days later, Pep was back in the ring, beating Bobby McIntyre by a decision. He closed 1943 winning five fights in a row, including two over future world champion Sal Bartolo and one over Jackie Wilson. The second win over Bartolo was in a defense of the world title.

1944 was a very good year for Pep. He won all 16 of his bouts that year, including wins over bantamweight champions Willie Joyce and Manuel Ortiz. He fought and beat Wright two more times, with Pep&#x27;s featherweight title on the line once. He also made his first fight abroad, beating fringe contender Jackie Lemus in Canada.

On June 6, 1944, he fought near featherweight contender, and rated lightweight Julie Kogon before a record crowd of 7,751 in an extraordinary bout in Hartford, Connecticut, and won soundly in an eight-round decision. Pep was given eight rounds by one of the judges. One fascinating fact about this fight that is not well known, is that Kogon was threatened before the fight by two armed men. They stated that the Kogon would not win the fight and it would be thrown or else him and his family would not survive.

He had eight fights in 1945, winning seven and drawing one. He beat former world champion Phil Terranova to retain the title, and had a ten-round draw with Jimmy McAllister.

In 1946, Pep had 18 fights, and won all of them, including a 12-round knockout of Bartolo and a three-round knockout of Wright. He had a six-fight knockout win streak during a span that year.

Despite being severely injured in a plane crash on January 5, Pep fought 10 bouts in 1947, again going undefeated. Many thought he had lost something as a fighter, especially after unexpectedly struggling in fights against Archie Wilmer (Pep won a majority decision) and Pedro Biesca (Pep was floored in the fourth round). He defended the world featherweight belt once that year, knocking out Jock Leslie in twelve rounds at Flint, Michigan.

Nineteen forty-eight was a year that would become important in Pep&#x27;s life: He won 15 bouts before going into what would be the first fight of his four-fight series with Sandy Saddler. He retained the title by beating Humberto Sierra by a knockout in 10 and he beat former world champion Paddy DeMarco, also in ten, but by decision. Then, on October 29, he lost the world featherweight title to Saddler in a fourth-round knockout.

After two wins, he and Saddler met in 1949. On their rivalry&#x27;s second installment, Pep recovered the World Featherweight Championship by beating Saddler in a 15-round decision, and then he engaged in a series of exhibition and ten round bouts before defending the crown against Eddie Campo, winning by a knockout in the seventh. He finished that year beating former bantamweight champion Harold Dade by a decision in ten at St. Louis.

In 1950, he won nine fights before meeting Saddler for a third time. Those nine bouts included defenses against Charlie Riley, knocked out in five, and France&#x27;s Ray Famechon, beaten by decision in 15. Then came the third fight with Saddler. Pep once again lost his World Featherweight Championship to Saddler, being unable to come out for the eighth round due to a separated shoulder suffered at the end of the seventh round. Pep was ahead on all scorecards (5–2, 5–2, 4–2).

Nineteen fifty-one brought a hint of controversy to Pep&#x27;s life. He won eight bouts in a row to start the year, but his ninth bout, the last chapter of the rivalry with Saddler, was his most important bout that year. Pep quit because blood from his right eye was bothering him. According to Nat Fleischer in &quot;The Ring&quot;, December 1951, this was an extremely dirty fight, with &quot;wrestling, heeling, eye gouging, tripping, thumbing- in fact every dirty trick known to the old timers...&quot; Referee Ray Miller &quot;let the bout get out of hand...&quot; &quot;The pattern of the &#x27;contest&#x27; never varied. Pep wouldn&#x27;t make a fight of it and Sandy couldn&#x27;t. Pep too frequently backed around the ring and Saddler just as often missed as he kept boring in trying to corner his man. Then when he did, the rowdy tactics got under way and ended only when either both were sprawled on the canvas still wrestling each other, or the referee was outside the ring trying pull the boys apart or both fighters and official were entangled in a pretzel formation on the ring floor.&quot; Pep was ahead on the scorecards of the officials after eight rounds, but he quit after nine rounds, &quot;declaring he no longer could continue because of severe pains caused by a deep cut over the right eye.&quot;

In 1952, Pep had 12 fights, winning 11. He was knocked out in six by Tommy Collins, but also held two wins over Billy Lima that year.

Pep won all 11 fights in 1953, and entered 1954 on a 17-fight winning streak. After beating David Seabrooke by a decision, he lost to fringe contender Lulu Perez by TKO after a delayed reaction to a punch. Pep ended up winning three more bouts before the end of the year.

Pep went on boxing for five more years, retiring in 1960, and then he came back in 1964 and boxed for two more years. During that last period of his boxing career, he won 43 bouts and lost only five, but his only opponent of note during that time was Hogan Kid Bassey, a future World Featherweight Champion who knocked Pep out in nine rounds. Pep boxed in Caracas, Venezuela, losing to Sonny Leon by a decision in 10, and in his last fight, in 1966, he lost to Calvin Woodland by a decision in six.

Pep had a record of 229 wins, 11 losses and one draw, with 65 wins by knockout.

==Post-career==
After retiring, he and Saddler were involved in a series of exhibition bouts, and in 1980, Pep sued &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; for running a story suggesting that he threw his fight with Perez. Pep lost the lawsuit, the jury deliberating just 15 minutes.

Pep remained active in boxing after hanging up the gloves, serving as an inspector and referee.

In 1977, Pep was elected to the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame.

In March 2006, Pep resided at a nursing home in Connecticut, diagnosed with dementia pugilistica, before his death on November 23, 2006. He is buried in Rocky Hill, CT. He left four children, William &quot;Billy&quot; Papaleo, Mary Papaleo, Michael Papaleo and Melissa Papaleo, and three stepchildren, April, L.J., Holly Miller.

==Honors==
In 1945, Pep was voted Fighter of the Year by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine.

He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in its inaugural year of 1990.

Pep was ranked sixth on &quot;Ring&quot; Magazine&#x27;s list of the 80 Best Fighters of the Last 80 Years in 2002. Pep was also named the third greatest fighter of all time by Bert Sugar.

Pep was ranked 5th on ESPN&#x27;s 50 Greatest Boxers Of All Time list in 2007.

Willie Pep was voted as the Greatest Featherweight Ever by the Houston Boxing Hall Of Fame in 2014. The HBHOF is a voting body composed totally of current and former fighters.

In 2011, the city of Middletown, Connecticut constructed the Willie Pep Skatepark named in honor of Pep.

==Film==
In 2023, &quot;The Featherweight&quot;, a feature film based on Pep&#x27;s life, premiered at the 80th Venice International Film Festival. Directed by Robert Kolodny, the biographical film stars James Madio as Willie Pep and focuses primarily on the period before Pep&#x27;s 1965 comeback. Lawrence Gilliard Jr. portrays Sandy Saddler, Stephen Lang plays Pep&#x27;s trainer Bill Gore, Keir Gilchrist is Pep&#x27;s son Billy, Ron Livingston is Pep&#x27;s manager Bob Kaplan and Ruby Wolf portrays Pep&#x27;s young wife Linda.

==&quot;No-punch&quot; round==
There are claims that Pep won the third round in his fight against Jackie Graves in a fight on July 25, 1946, without throwing a punch. The &quot;no-punch&quot; winning round is disputed; several contemporary newspaper articles make no mention of it, and an account in &quot;The Minneapolis Star&quot; describes the third round as &quot;toe to toe slugging with Pep inflicting his best punishment with a right to the body&quot;. Pep supposedly tipped off a few ringside reporters before the bout and told them he would win the third round without throwing &quot;a punch of anger.&quot;

<text>Vanilla Fudge is an American rock band known predominantly for their slow extended heavy rock arrangements of contemporary hit songs, such as their hit cover of the Supremes&#x27; &quot;You Keep Me Hangin&#x27; On&quot;.

The band&#x27;s original line–up was vocalist/organist Mark Stein, bassist/vocalist Tim Bogert, guitarist/vocalist Vince Martell, and drummer/vocalist Carmine Appice. They recorded five albums during the years 1967–69, before disbanding in 1970. The band has toured as recently as 2022 with three of the four original members: Stein, Martell, and Appice, with Pete Bremy on bass. Bogert retired in 2009 and died in 2021.

The band has been cited as &quot;one of the few American links between psychedelia and what soon became heavy metal&quot; and as a proto-prog band.

==History==
Stein and Bogert had played in a local band called Rick Martin &amp; The Showmen. The pair were so impressed by the swinging, organ-heavy sound of The Rascals they decided to form their own band in 1965 with Martell and Rick Martin&#x27;s drummer, Mark Dolfen, who was quickly replaced by Joey Brennan. Originally calling themselves The Electric Pigeons, they soon shortened the name to The Pigeons. In December 1966, Brennan moved on to The Younger Brothers Band and Bogert became impressed with a young drummer named Carmine Appice he had heard playing at the Headliner Club on 43rd Street in a cover band called Thursday&#x27;s Children. Appice was asked to join The Pigeons and in his 2016 autobiography, &quot;Stick It!&quot;, Carmine explained the name change to &#x27;Vanilla Fudge&#x27;:

In April 1967 the Pigeons got signed to Atlantic Records. But there was one drawback, however: Atlantic didn&#x27;t want to sign a band called &quot;The Pigeons&quot;. Ahmet Ertegun, the label&#x27;s founder and president, didn&#x27;t like that name and told us we had to change it. We didn&#x27;t mind, in fact, I had always thought &quot;The Pigeons&quot; was a weird thing to be called but had just gone with it. We tried to think up a new name but were getting nowhere until we played a gig at the Page 2 club on Long Island and ended up talking to a chick named Dee Dee who worked there. She told us how her grandfather used to call her Vanilla Fudge. Then she looked at us and added &quot;Maybe you guys should call yourselves that—you&#x27;re like white soul music&quot;. We liked it. We told our manager, Phil Basile. He liked it. We told Atlantic and they liked it, too. So Vanilla Fudge it was.

A recording of The Pigeons, &quot;While the World Was Eating Vanilla Fudge&quot;, was released by Scepter/Wand in 1970.

Vanilla Fudge was managed by Phillip Basile, a reputed Lucchese crime family member, who operated several popular clubs in New York. Their first three albums (&quot;Vanilla Fudge&quot;, &quot;The Beat Goes On&quot;, and &quot;Renaissance&quot;) were produced by Shadow Morton, whom the band met through The Rascals. When Led Zeppelin first toured the United States in early 1969, they opened for Vanilla Fudge on some shows.

The band&#x27;s biggest hit was its cover of &quot;You Keep Me Hangin&#x27; On,&quot; a slowed-down, hard rocking version of a song originally recorded by the Supremes. This version featured Stein&#x27;s psychedelic-baroque organ intro and Appice&#x27;s energetic drumming. It was a Top 10 hit in Canada, the United States, and Australia, and a Top 20 hit in the UK in 1967.

The members of Vanilla Fudge were great admirers of the Beatles, and covered several of their songs including &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot;, &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That&quot;. The eponymous debut album quotes &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; at the end, with the lines &quot;Nothing is real; Nothing to get hung about&quot;.

According to Ritchie Blackmore and Jon Lord, Vanilla Fudge&#x27;s organ-heavy sound was a large influence on the British band Deep Purple, with Blackmore even stating that his band wanted to be a &quot;Vanilla Fudge clone&quot; in its early years.

===Breakup and reunions===
Vanilla Fudge played a farewell concert at the Phil Basile&#x27;s Action House on March 14, 1970. After that, Bogert and Appice departed to form another group, Cactus, that they had been planning since late 1969. They ended up leaving Cactus and formed Beck, Bogert &amp; Appice with guitarist Jeff Beck in 1972. Stein, left on his own, tried to keep Vanilla Fudge afloat with two new players, Sal D&#x27;Nofrio (bass) and Jimmy Galluzi (drums), both of whom had been members of a Poughkeepsie, New York, group known as The Dirty Elbows. But when nothing came from this, Stein ended up forming a new group, Boomerang, with Galluzi.

Since the band&#x27;s breakup in 1970, Vanilla Fudge has reunited several times. They reunited in support of the Atco Records release &quot;Best of Vanilla Fudge&quot; in 1982. This resulted in &quot;Mystery&quot;, another album of new material, released in 1984. Martell was not included in this initial reunion and Ron Mancuso played guitar on &quot;Mystery&quot; instead, along with Jeff Beck, who guested under the moniker &quot;J. Toad&quot;. Two reunion tours followed in 1987/1988, with Paul Hanson on guitar. Lanny Cordola was guitarist when the band took the stage on May 14, 1988, for Atlantic Records&#x27; 40th anniversary celebration. After that, band members went their own ways once again to pursue separate projects.

In 1991, Appice revived the Vanilla Fudge name for a tour with Ted Nugent&#x27;s former band members Derek St. Holmes (guitar, vocals), Martin Gerschwitz (keyboards, vocals), and Tom Croucier (bass, vocals), which resulted in the album &quot;The Best of Vanilla Fudge – Live&quot;.

Three of the original members, Appice, Bogert, and Martell, reunited in 1999 with vocalist/organist Bill Pascali replacing Mark Stein to record a &quot;greatest hits&quot; album, &quot;The Return / Then And Now &quot; (2001), with new recordings of previous songs and three new songs. 2002 had Pete Bremy and T. M. Stevens subbing on bass for an ill Bogert and 2003 saw a release of Vanilla Fudge&#x27;s live album, &quot;The Real Deal – Vanilla Fudge Live&quot;, recorded on tour in 1987 with Paul Hanson on guitar. Martell overdubbed his guitar and vocals later. In 2003–2005, the group toured with Teddy Rondinelli standing in on guitar for Martell.

In 2005, all four original Vanilla Fudge members reunited for a tour with members of The Doors (touring as Riders on the Storm) and Steppenwolf. Pascali returned in place of Stein for some 2005 and 2006 shows before leaving to join the New Rascals. Vanilla Fudge was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame on October 15, 2006, with Billy Joel, Joan Jett, and producer Shadow Morton. Fellow Long Islander Felix Cavaliere of The Rascals inducted them.

In the summer of 2007, HBO&#x27;s final episode of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; featured &quot;You Keep Me Hangin&#x27; On&quot; (with Pascali&#x27;s lead vocals) as a theme for their cliffhanger. The band also went back into the studio to record &quot;Out Through the In Door&quot;, a Led Zeppelin cover album released in 2007 only in Europe. Also, the band (Stein &amp; Martell with Steve Argy on bass and Jimmyjack Tamburo on drums) performed &quot;You Keep Me Hangin&#x27; On&quot; for the PBS fundraising program &quot;My Music: My Generation – The &#x27;60s&quot; for the March 2008 pledge drive.

In March 2008, the original lineup of Vanilla Fudge embarked on a tour of the United States (mostly in New England). But in the summer of that year, Bogert and Appice left to concentrate on Cactus, which they had reformed in 2006. Stein and Martell continued on in 2008 and 2009 as Mark Stein and Vince Martell of Vanilla Fudge with a tour that was called &quot;Let&#x27;s Pray For Peace,&quot; with Jimmyjack Tamburo on drums and Pete Bremy returning on bass. &quot;Out Through the In Door&quot; was released in the US in 2008. Stein and Martell also performed shows during this period with Steve Argy and Jimmyjack Tamburo again as the rhythm section.

In 2009 Tim Bogert announced his retirement from touring and was replaced later by Pete Bremy.

In early 2011, Vanilla Fudge embarked on what was announced as their farewell tour. The lineup for the tour included Carmine Appice, Mark Stein, Vince Martell, and Pete Bremy (bass). On March 29, 2011, the band appeared on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; and performed &quot;You Keep Me Hangin&#x27; On&quot;. This lineup has continued to tour since.

In 2015 Vanilla Fudge released its first album in ten years, &quot;Spirit of &#x27;67&quot;.

As of 2021, Vanilla Fudge was still performing concerts regularly. On January 13, 2021, Tim Bogert died at the age of 76 after a long battle with cancer. The band did release (on September 6, 2021) a cover version of &quot;Stop! in the Name of Love&quot; as digital streaming content and with an official music video on YouTube, dedicated to Tim Bogert.

<text>Baghdad International Airport , previously Saddam International Airport from 1982 to 2003, () is Iraq&#x27;s largest international airport, located in a suburb about west of downtown Baghdad in the Baghdad Governorate. It is the home base for Iraq&#x27;s national airline, Iraqi Airways.

==History==
=== Interwar ===
The Baghdad West Aerodrome was made available for civilian flights of Imperial Airways on April 1, 1929.

===Construction and operation===
The airport was developed under a consortium led by French company Spie Batignolles under an agreement made in 1979. The Iran–Iraq War delayed full opening of the airport until 1982. It opened as Saddam International Airport, bearing the name of then-Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.

Most of Baghdad&#x27;s civilian flights stopped in 1991, when the United Nations imposed restrictions on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait. After the Persian Gulf War, a no-fly zone imposed on Iraq by the United States and the United Kingdom meant that Iraqi Airways was only able to continue domestic flights for limited periods. Occasional international charter flights carrying medicine, aid workers, and government officials were allowed into Baghdad. Royal Jordanian Airlines operated regular flights from Amman to Baghdad.

On August 17, 2000, the airport was officially opened to civilian flights. Minister of Transport Ahmad Murtada said that:

===2003–2005 (U.S. occupation)===

In 2003, United States-led Coalition forces invaded Iraq. In early April, they moved into Baghdad, took control of the airport, and changed its name to Baghdad International Airport. The ICAO code for the airport consequently changed from ORBS to ORBI. The IATA code also changed from SDA to BGW, which had previously referred to all Baghdad airports, and before that to Al Muthana Airport when Saddam Hussein was in power.

In July 2003, the airport resumed civilian flights for the first time since 1991.

Civilian control of the airport was returned to the Iraqi Government from the Coalition Provisional Authority in 2004.

===2005–2011===
Sather Air Base – the American base on the west side of the airport – came under periodic rocket fire from Baghdad. On 6 December 2006, a 107mm rocket attack landed from a parked C-5A aircraft, puncturing it with scores of shrapnel holes.

Terminal C was refreshed with three active gate areas for carriers operating from the airport.

=== 2012-Present ===
Baghdad Airport Road, connecting the airport to the Green Zone, once a dangerous route full of IEDs, was refurbished in 2014 with palm trees, manicured lawns, and a fountain, with Turkish assistance.

On 1 May 2023, the Iraqi government under Mohammed Shia&#x27; Al Sudani approved plans to enhance services with the intention of launching an expansion project in the development of Baghdad Airport in the second half of 2023. In 2024, the airport reached the final stage of its expansion plan, according to the International Finance Corporation.

==Military use==
A separate enclave within the airport houses the New Al Muthana Air Base, where the Iraqi Air Force&#x27;s 23rd Squadron is based, operating three Lockheed C-130E Hercules transport aircraft. The base is also home to a number of Sukhoi Su-25 attack aircraft.

Sather Air Base, or Camp Sather, was a United States Air Force base on the west side of the airport from 2003 to 2011. It was named in memory of Combat Controller Staff Sergeant Scott Sather, the first enlisted airman to die in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Sather was awarded the Bronze Star Medal with Valor for his leadership of a 24th Special Tactics Squadron reconnaissance task force during the initial stages of the 2003 U.S. invasion.

==Airport developments==
On 18 May 2010, plans were unveiled for an expansion of Baghdad International Airport, doubling its capacity to 15 million passengers per year. The expansion, to be funded by foreign investors, was to include construction of three new terminals and refurbishment of the existing three, each of which would accommodate 2.5 million passengers annually.

==Incidents and accidents==
*In February 1991, five aircraft, comprising three Iraqi Government executive jets, plus two Iraqi Airways Tupolev Tu-124Vs (YI-AEL and YI-AEY), were destroyed on the ground at Saddam International Airport by US or allied bombs during the Gulf War.
*In June 2000, two Saudi former military officers boarded a plane bound for London and diverted it to Baghdad. They wanted to claim asylum in Iraq, but Iraqi authorities later deported them to Saudi Arabia.
* On 22 November 2003, a European Air Transport Airbus A300B4 freighter, registered OO-DLL, operating on behalf of DHL Aviation, was hit by an SA-14 &#x27;Grail&#x27; missile shortly after takeoff. The airplane lost hydraulic pressure, causing a loss of control. After extending the landing gear to create more drag, the crew piloted the plane using differences in engine thrust and landed the plane with minimal further damage. All three crew survived. After the incident, civilian planes took to routinely performing corkscrew landings to minimise the risk of being hit by surface weapons.
*On 26 January 2015, a Flydubai Boeing 737-800 flying from Dubai to Baghdad with 154 passengers on board was hit by small-arms fire on approach to Baghdad International Airport. The plane landed safely. One passenger was injured when at least three bullets struck the plane. After the incident, UAE carriers FlyDubai and Emirates suspended their flights from Dubai to Baghdad. Flights by Turkish Airlines and Royal Jordanian were also temporarily suspended.
*On 3 January 2020, a U.S. drone strike killed Qasem Soleimani, leader of Iran&#x27;s Quds Force, and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, deputy commander of the Popular Mobilization Forces, as their convoy left the airport on or near Baghdad Airport Road.

<doc id="162173" wikidata="Q486296" url="?curid=162173" title="Islamophobia">
<text>Islamophobia is the irrational fear of, hostility towards, or hatred against the religion of Islam or Muslims in general. Islamophobia is primarily a form of religious or cultural bigotry; and people who harbour such sentiments often stereotype Muslims as a geopolitical threat or a source of terrorism. Muslims, with diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds, are often inaccurately portrayed by Islamophobes as a single homogenous racial group.

The causes of increase in Islamophobia across the world since the end of the Cold War are many. These include the quasi-racialist stereotypes against Muslims that proliferated through the Western media since the 1990s, the &quot;war on terror&quot; campaign launched by the United States after the September 11 attacks, the rise of the Islamic State in the aftermath of the Iraq War, terrorist attacks carried out by Islamist militants in the United States and Europe, anti-Muslim rhetoric disseminated by white nationalist organizations through the internet, and the radicalization of Christian nationalist and far-right groups with growing hostility towards Muslims in the United States and the European Union.

A study conducted in 2013 revealed that Muslim women, especially those wearing headscarves or face veils, are more vulnerable to suffer from Islamophobic attacks than Muslim men. Due to the racialized nature of Islamophobic discrimination and attacks suffered by numerous Muslims in their daily lives, several scholars have asserted that Islamophobia has explicit racist dimensions. On 15 March 2022, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution by consensus which was introduced by Pakistan on behalf of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation that proclaimed March 15 as &#x27;International Day To Combat Islamophobia&#x27;.

The exact definition of the term &quot;Islamophobia&quot; has been a subject of debate amongst Western analysts. Detractors of the term have proposed alternative terms, such as &quot;anti-Muslim&quot;, to denote prejudice or discrimination against Muslims. It has been alleged, often by right-wing commentators, that the term is sometimes used to avoid criticism of Islam, by removing the distinction between racism and criticism of religious doctrine or practice. However, academics, activists and experts who support the terminology have denounced such characterizations as attempts to deny the existence of Islamophobia.

==Terms==
There are a number of other possible terms which are also used in order to refer to negative feelings and attitudes towards Islam and Muslims, such as anti-Muslimism, intolerance against Muslims, anti-Muslim prejudice, anti-Muslim bigotry, hatred of Muslims, anti-Islamism, Muslimophobia, demonisation of Islam, or demonisation of Muslims. In German, &quot;Islamophobie&quot; (fear) and &quot;Islamfeindlichkeit&quot; (hostility) are used. The Scandinavian term &quot;Muslimhat&quot; literally means &quot;hatred of Muslims&quot;.

When discrimination towards Muslims has placed an emphasis on their religious affiliation and adherence, it has been termed Muslimphobia, the alternative form of Muslimophobia, Islamophobism, antimuslimness and antimuslimism. Individuals who discriminate against Muslims in general have been termed &quot;Islamophobes&quot;, &quot;Islamophobists&quot;, &quot;anti-Muslimists&quot;, &quot;antimuslimists&quot;, &quot;islamophobiacs&quot;, &quot;anti-Muhammadan&quot;, &quot;Muslimphobes&quot; or its alternative spelling of &quot;Muslimophobes&quot;, while individuals motivated by a specific anti-Muslim agenda or bigotry have been described as being &quot;anti-mosque&quot;, &quot;anti-Shiites&quot; (or &quot;Shiaphobes&quot;), &quot;anti-Sufism&quot; (or &quot;Sufi-phobia&quot;) and &quot;anti-Sunni&quot; (or &quot;Sunniphobes&quot;).

== Etymology and definitions ==
The word &quot;Islamophobia&quot; is a neologism formed from &quot;Islam&quot; and &quot;-phobia&quot;, a Greek suffix used in English to form &quot;nouns with the sense &#x27;fear , &#x27;aversion 

According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the word means &quot;Intense dislike or fear of Islam, esp. as a political force; hostility or prejudice towards Muslims&quot;. It is attested in English as early as 1923 to quote the French word &quot;islamophobie&quot;, found in a thesis published by Alain Quellien in 1910 to describe &quot;a prejudice against Islam that is widespread among the peoples of Western and Christian civilization&quot;. The expression did not immediately turn into the vocabulary of the English-speaking world though, which preferred the expression &quot;feelings inimical to Islam&quot;, until its re-appearance in an article by Georges Chahati Anawati in 1976. The term did not exist in the Muslim world, and was later translated in the 1990s as &quot;ruhāb al-islām&quot; (رُهاب الإسلام) in Arabic, literally &quot;phobia of Islam&quot;.

The University of California at Berkeley&#x27;s Islamophobia Research &amp; Documentation Project suggested this working definition: &quot;Islamophobia is a contrived fear or prejudice fomented by the existing Eurocentric and Orientalist global power structure. It is directed at a perceived or real Muslim threat through the maintenance and extension of existing disparities in economic, political, social and cultural relations, while rationalizing the necessity to deploy violence as a tool to achieve &#x27;civilizational rehab&#x27; of the target communities (Muslim or otherwise). Islamophobia reintroduces and reaffirms a global racial structure through which resource distribution disparities are maintained and extended.&quot;

===Debate on the term and its limitations===
In 1996, the Runnymede Trust established the Commission on British Muslims and Islamophobia (CBMI), chaired by Gordon Conway, the vice-chancellor of the University of Sussex. The Commission&#x27;s report, &quot;Islamophobia: A Challenge for Us All&quot;, was published in November 1997 by the Home Secretary, Jack Straw. In the Runnymede report, Islamophobia was defined as &quot;an outlook or world-view involving an unfounded dread and dislike of Muslims, which results in practices of exclusion and discrimination.&quot; The introduction of the term was justified by the report&#x27;s assessment that &quot;anti-Muslim prejudice has grown so considerably and so rapidly in recent years that a new item in the vocabulary is needed&quot;.

In 2008, a workshop on &#x27;Thinking Through Islamophobia&#x27; was held at the University of Leeds, organized by the Centre for Ethnicity and Racism Studies, the participants included S. Sayyid, Abdoolkarim Vakil, Liz Fekete, and Gabrielle Maranci among others. The symposium proposed a definition of Islamophobia which rejected the idea of Islamophobia as being the product of closed and open views of Islam and focused on Islamophobia as performative which problematized Muslim agency and identity. The symposium was an early attempt to bring insights from critical race theory, postcolonial and decolonial thought to bear on the question of Islamophobia.

At a 2009 symposium on &quot;Islamophobia and Religious Discrimination&quot;, Robin Richardson, a former director of the Runnymede Trust and the editor of &quot;Islamophobia: a challenge for us all&quot;, said that &quot;the disadvantages of the term Islamophobia are significant&quot; on seven different grounds, including that it implies it is merely a &quot;severe mental illness&quot; affecting &quot;only a tiny minority of people&quot;; that use of the term makes those to whom it is applied &quot;defensive and defiant&quot; and absolves the user of &quot;the responsibility of trying to understand them&quot; or trying to change their views; that it implies that hostility to Muslims is divorced from factors such as skin color, immigrant status, fear of fundamentalism, or political or economic conflicts; that it conflates prejudice against Muslims in one&#x27;s own country with dislike of Muslims in countries with which the West is in conflict; that it fails to distinguish between people who are against all religion from people who dislike Islam specifically; and that the actual issue being described is hostility to Muslims, &quot;an ethno-religious identity within European countries&quot;, rather than hostility to Islam. Nonetheless, he argued that the term is here to stay, and that it is important to define it precisely.

The exact definition of Islamophobia continues to be discussed, with academics such as Chris Allen saying that it lacks a clear definition. According to Erik Bleich, in his article &quot;Defining and Researching Islamophobia&quot;, even when definitions are more specific, there is still significant variation in the precise formulations of Islamophobia. As with parallel concepts like homophobia or xenophobia, Islamophobia connotes a broader set of negative attitudes or emotions directed at individuals of groups because of perceived membership in a defined category. Mattias Gardell defined Islamophobia as &quot;socially reproduced prejudices and aversion to Islam and Muslims, as well as actions and practices that attack, exclude or discriminate against persons on the basis that they are or perceived to be Muslim and be associated with Islam&quot;.

===Irrational fear===

As opposed to being a psychological or individualistic phobia, according to professors of religion Peter Gottschalk and Gabriel Greenberg, &quot;Islamophobia&quot; connotes a social anxiety about Islam and Muslims. Some social scientists have adopted this definition and developed instruments to measure Islamophobia in form of fearful attitudes towards, and avoidance of, Muslims and Islam, arguing that Islamophobia should &quot;essentially be understood as an affective part of social stigma towards Islam and Muslims, namely fear&quot;.

===Racism===

Several scholars consider Islamophobia to be a form of xenophobia or racism. A 2007 article in &quot;Journal of Sociology&quot; defines Islamophobia as anti-Muslim racism and a continuation of anti-Asian, anti-Turkic and anti-Arab racism. In their books, Deepa Kumar and Junaid Rana have argued that formation of Islamophobic discourses has paralleled the development of other forms of racial bigotry. Similarly, John Denham has drawn parallels between modern Islamophobia and the antisemitism of the 1930s, as have Maud Olofsson and Jan Hjärpe, among others.

Others have questioned the relationship between Islamophobia and racism. Jocelyne Cesari writes that &quot;academics are still debating the legitimacy of the term and questioning how it differs from other terms such as racism, anti-Islamism, anti-Muslimness, and anti-Semitism.&quot; Erdenir finds that &quot;there is no consensus on the scope and content of the term and its relationship with concepts such as racism ...&quot; and Shryock, reviewing the use of the term across national boundaries, comes to the same conclusion.

Some scholars view Islamophobia and racism as partially overlapping phenomena. Diane Frost defines Islamophobia as anti-Muslim feeling and violence based on &quot;race&quot; or religion. Islamophobia may also target people who have Muslim names, or have a look that is associated with Muslims. According to Alan Johnson, Islamophobia sometimes can be nothing more than xenophobia or racism &quot;wrapped in religious terms&quot;. Sociologists Yasmin Hussain and Paul Bagguley stated that racism and Islamophobia are &quot;analytically distinct&quot;, but &quot;empirically inter-related&quot;.

The European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) defines Islamophobia as &quot;the fear of or prejudiced viewpoint towards Islam, Muslims and matters pertaining to them&quot;, adding that whether &quot;it takes the shape of daily forms of racism and discrimination or more violent forms, Islamophobia is a violation of human rights and a threat to social cohesion&quot;.

==Origins and causes==
===History of the term===

One early use cited as the term&#x27;s first use is by the painter Alphonse Étienne Dinet and Algerian intellectual Sliman ben Ibrahim in their 1918 biography of Islam&#x27;s prophet Muhammad. Writing in French, they used the term &quot;&quot;. Robin Richardson writes that in the English version of the book the word was not translated as &quot;Islamophobia&quot; but rather as &quot;feelings inimical to Islam&quot;. Dahou Ezzerhouni has cited several other uses in French as early as 1910, and from 1912 to 1918. These early uses of the term did not, according to Christopher Allen, have the same meaning as in contemporary usage, as they described a fear of Islam by liberal Muslims and Muslim feminists, rather than a fear or dislike/hatred of Muslims by non-Muslims. On the other hand, Fernando Bravo López argues that Dinet and ibn Sliman&#x27;s use of the term was as a criticism of overly hostile attitudes to Islam by a Belgian orientalist, Henri Lammens, whose project they saw as a &quot;&#x27;pseudo-scientific crusade in the hope of bringing Islam down once and for all. He also notes that an early definition of Islamophobia appears in the 1910 Ph.D. thesis of Alain Quellien, a French colonial bureaucrat:
For some, the Muslim is the natural and irreconcilable enemy of the Christian and the European; Islam is the negation of civilization, and barbarism, bad faith and cruelty are the best one can expect from the Mohammedans.
Furthermore, he notes that Quellien&#x27;s work draws heavily on the work of the French colonial department&#x27;s 1902–06 administrator, who published a work in 1906, which to a great extent mirrors John Esposito&#x27;s &quot;The Islamic Threat: Myth or Reality?&quot;.

The first recorded use of the term in English, according to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, was in 1923 in an article in &quot;The Journal of Theological Studies&quot;. The term entered into common usage with the publication of the Runnymede Trust&#x27;s report in 1997. &quot;Kofi Annan asserted at a 2004 conference entitled &quot;Confronting Islamophobia&quot; that the word Islamophobia had to be coined in order to &quot;take account of increasingly widespread bigotry&quot;.

=== Increase in Islamophobia during 1990s ===

During the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s, far-right Serbian Orthodox Christian militants who were heavily indoctrinated with Islamophobic sentiments, perpetrated a genocide against Bosniak Muslims. Since 1989, Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević publicly disseminated Islamophobic rhetoric throughout Yugoslavia, inciting Serbian far-right militants to massacre Bosniak Muslims.

The stereotyping of Bosniak Muslims as a hostile force threatening Europe with &quot;terrorism&quot; in Serbian propaganda was closely linked to the rise of Islamophobic narratives in Western media and European political discourse.

===Contrasting views on Islam===
The Runnymede report contrasted &quot;open&quot; and &quot;closed&quot; views of Islam, and stated that the following &quot;closed&quot; views are equated with Islamophobia:

:#Islam is seen as a monolithic bloc, static and unresponsive to change.
:#It is seen as separate and &quot;other&quot;. It does not have values in common with other cultures, is not affected by them and does not influence them.
:#It is seen as inferior to the West. It is seen as barbaric, irrational, primitive, and sexist.
:#It is seen as violent, aggressive, threatening, supportive of terrorism, and engaged in a clash of civilizations.
:#It is seen as a political ideology, used for political or military advantage.
:#Criticisms made of &quot;the West&quot; by Muslims are rejected out of hand.
:#Hostility towards Islam is used to justify discriminatory practices towards Muslims and exclusion of Muslims from mainstream society.
:#Anti-Muslim hostility is seen as natural and normal.

These &quot;closed&quot; views are contrasted, in the report, with &quot;open&quot; views on Islam which, while founded on respect for Islam, permit legitimate disagreement, dialogue and critique. According to Benn and Jawad, The Runnymede Trust notes that anti-Muslim discourse is increasingly seen as respectable, providing examples on how hostility towards Islam and Muslims is accepted as normal, even among those who may actively challenge other prevalent forms of discrimination.

===Identity politics===
It has been suggested that Islamophobia is closely related to identity politics, and gives its adherents the perceived benefit of constructing their identity in opposition to a negative, essentialized image of Muslims. This occurs in the form of self-righteousness, assignment of blame and key identity markers. Davina Bhandar writes that:

She views this as an ontological trap that hinders the perception of culture as something &quot;materially situated in the living practices of the everyday, situated in time-space and not based in abstract projections of what constitutes either a particular tradition or culture.&quot;

In some societies, Islamophobia has materialized due to the portrayal of Islam and Muslims as the national &quot;Other&quot;, where exclusion and discrimination occurs on the basis of their religion and civilization which differs with national tradition and identity. Examples include Pakistani and Algerian migrants in Britain and France respectively. This sentiment, according to Malcolm Brown and Robert Miles, significantly interacts with racism, although Islamophobia itself is not racism. Author Doug Saunders has drawn parallels between Islamophobia in the United States and its older discrimination and hate against Roman Catholics, saying that Catholicism was seen as backwards and imperial, while Catholic immigrants had poorer education and some were responsible for crime and terrorism.

Brown and Miles write that another feature of Islamophobic discourse is to amalgamate nationality (e.g. Saudi), religion (Islam), and politics (terrorism, fundamentalism) – while most other religions are not associated with terrorism, or even &quot;ethnic or national distinctiveness&quot;. They feel that &quot;many of the stereotypes and misinformation that contribute to the articulation of Islamophobia are rooted in a particular perception of Islam&quot;, such as the notion that Islam promotes terrorism – especially prevalent after the September 11, 2001 attacks.

The two-way stereotyping resulting from Islamophobia has in some instances resulted in mainstreaming of earlier controversial discourses, such as liberal attitudes towards gender equality and homosexuals. Christina Ho has warned against framing of such mainstreaming of gender equality in a colonial, paternal discourse, arguing that this may undermine minority women&#x27;s ability to speak out about their concerns.

Steven Salaita contends that, since 9/11, Arab Americans have evolved from what Nadine Naber described as an invisible group in the United States into a highly visible community that directly or indirectly has an effect on the United States&#x27; culture wars, foreign policy, presidential elections and legislative tradition.

The academics S. Sayyid and Abdoolkarim Vakil maintain that Islamophobia is a response to the emergence of a distinct Muslim public identity globally, the presence of Muslims in itself not being an indicator of the degree of Islamophobia in a society. Sayyid and Vakil maintain that there are societies where virtually no Muslims live but many institutionalized forms of Islamophobia still exist in them.

===Links to ideologies===

Cora Alexa Døving, a senior scientist at the Norwegian Center for Studies of the Holocaust and Religious Minorities, argues that there are significant similarities between Islamophobic discourse and European pre-Nazi antisemitism. Among the concerns are imagined threats of minority growth and domination, threats to traditional institutions and customs, skepticism of integration, threats to secularism, fears of sexual crimes, fears of misogyny, fears based on historical cultural inferiority, hostility to modern Western Enlightenment values, etc.

 has argued that there are important differences between Islamophobia and antisemitism. While antisemitism was a phenomenon closely connected to European nation-building processes, he sees Islamophobia as having the concern of European civilization as its focal point. Døving, on the other hand, maintains that, at least in Norway, the Islamophobic discourse has a clear national element. In a reply to Bunzl, French scholar of Jewish history, Esther Benbassa, agrees with him in that he draws a clear connection between modern hostile and essentializing sentiments towards Muslims and historical antisemitism. However, she argues against the use of the term &quot;Islamophobia&quot;, since, in her opinion, it attracts unwarranted attention to an underlying racist current.

The head of the Media Responsibility Institute in Erlangen, Sabine Schiffer, and researcher Constantin Wagner, who also define Islamophobia as anti-Muslim racism, outline additional similarities and differences between Islamophobia and antisemitism. They point out the existence of equivalent notions such as &quot;Judaisation/Islamisation&quot;, and metaphors such as &quot;a state within a state&quot; are used in relation to both Jews and Muslims. In addition, both discourses make use of, among other rhetorical instruments, &quot;religious imperatives&quot; supposedly &quot;proven&quot; by religious sources, and conspiracy theories.

The differences between Islamophobia and antisemitism consist of the nature of the perceived threats to the &quot;Christian West&quot;. Muslims are perceived as &quot;inferior&quot; and as a visible &quot;external threat&quot;, while on the other hand, Jews are perceived as &quot;omnipotent&quot; and as an invisible &quot;internal threat&quot;. However, Schiffer and Wagner also note that there is a growing tendency to view Muslims as a privileged group that constitute an &quot;internal threat&quot; and that this convergence between the two discources makes &quot;it more and more necessary to use findings from the study of anti-Semitism to analyse Islamophobia&quot;. Schiffer and Wagner conclude,

The publication &quot;Social Work and Minorities: European Perspectives&quot; describes Islamophobia as the new form of racism in Europe, arguing that &quot;Islamophobia is as much a form of racism as anti-semitism, a term more commonly encountered in Europe as a sibling of racism, xenophobia and intolerance.&quot; Edward Said considers Islamophobia as it is evinced in Orientalism to be a trend in a more general antisemitic Western tradition. Others note that there has been a transition from anti-Asian and anti-Arab racism to anti-Muslim racism, while some note a racialization of religion.

According to a 2012 report by a UK anti-racism group, counter-jihadist outfits in Europe and North America are becoming more cohesive by forging alliances, with 190 groups now identified as promoting an Islamophobic agenda. In &quot;Islamophobia and its consequences on young people&quot; (p. 6) Ingrid Ramberg writes &quot;Whether it takes the shape of daily forms of racism and discrimination or more violent forms, Islamophobia is a violation of human rights and a threat to social cohesion.&quot; Professor John Esposito of Georgetown University calls Islamophobia &quot;the new anti-Semitism&quot;.

In their 2018 American Muslim Poll, the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding found that when it came to their Islamophobia index (see Public Opinion), they found that those who scored higher on the index, (i.e. more islamophobic) were, &quot;associated with 1) greater acceptance of targeting civilians, whether it is a military or individual/small group that is doling out the violence, 2) greater acquiescence to limiting both press freedoms and institutional checks following a hypothetical terror attack, and 3) greater support for the so-called &quot;Muslim ban&quot; and the surveillance of American mosques (or their outright building prohibition).&quot;

Mohamed Nimer compares Islamophobia with anti-Americanism. He argues that while both Islam and America can be subject to legitimate criticisms without detesting a people as a whole, bigotry against both are on the rise.

Gideon Rachman wrote in 2019 of a &quot;clash of civilizations&quot; between Muslim and non-Muslim nations, linking anti-Islam radicalisation outside the Muslim world to the rise of intolerant Islamism in some Muslim countries that used to be relatively free from that ideology.

Blasphemy of Islam has been described as Islamophobia, while some countries consider blasphemy legal as freedom of speech.

===Opposition to multiculturalism===
According to Gabrielle Maranci, the increasing Islamophobia in the West is related to a rising repudiation of multiculturalism. Maranci concludes that &quot;Islamophobia is a &#x27;phobia&#x27; of multiculturalism and the transruptive effect that Islam can have in Europe and the West through transcultural processes.&quot;

==Manifestations==
===Media===
According to Elizabeth Poole in the &quot;Encyclopedia of Race and Ethnic Studies&quot;, the media have been criticized for perpetrating Islamophobia. She cites a case study examining a sample of articles in the British press from between 1994 and 2004, which concluded that Muslim viewpoints were underrepresented and that issues involving Muslims usually depicted them in a negative light. Such portrayals, according to Poole, include the depiction of Islam and Muslims as a threat to Western security and values. Benn and Jawad write that hostility towards Islam and Muslims are &quot;closely linked to media portrayals of Islam as barbaric, irrational, primitive and sexist.&quot; Egorova and Tudor cite European researchers in suggesting that expressions used in the media such as &quot;Islamic terrorism&quot;, &quot;Islamic bombs&quot; and &quot;violent Islam&quot; have resulted in a negative perception of Islam. John E. Richardson&#x27;s 2004 book &quot;(Mis)representing Islam: the racism and rhetoric of British broadsheet newspapers&quot;, criticized the British media for propagating negative stereotypes of Muslims and fueling anti-Muslim prejudice. In another study conducted by John E. Richardson, he found that 85% of mainstream newspaper articles treated Muslims as a homogeneous mass and portrayed them as a threat to British society.

The Universities of Georgia and Alabama in the United States conducted a study comparing media coverage of &quot;terrorist attacks&quot; committed by Islamist militants with those of non-Muslims in the United States.  Researchers found that &quot;terrorist attacks&quot; by Islamist militants receive 357% more media attention than attacks committed by non-Muslims or whites. Terrorist attacks committed by non-Muslims (or where the religion was unknown) received an average of 15 headlines, while those committed by Muslim extremists received 105 headlines. The study was based on an analysis of news reports covering terrorist attacks in the United States between 2005 and 2015. This was despite the fact that far-right extremists were responsible for almost double the number of terrorist acts in US attributed to Muslim individuals between 2008 and 2016. In spite of this disparity, US and UK governments have been negligent in confronting far-right terrorists, instead focusing almost all their counter-terrorism resources on imposing surveillance measures on Muslim population and censoring Muslim activists. Many right-wing politicians have also engaged in anti-Muslim rhetoric, indirectly motivating far-right groups to intensify violent hate crimes against Muslims.

In 2009, Mehdi Hasan in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; criticized Western media for over-reporting a few Islamist terrorist incidents but under-reporting the much larger number of planned non-Islamist terrorist attacks carried out by &quot;non-Irish white folks&quot;. A 2012 study indicates that Muslims across different European countries, such as France, Germany and the United Kingdom, experience the highest degree of Islamophobia in the media. Media personalities have been accused of Islamophobia. The obituary in &quot;The Guardian&quot; for the Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci described her as &quot;notorious for her Islamaphobia&quot; . The Institute for Social Policy and Understanding published a report in 2018 where they stated, &quot;In terms of print media coverage, Muslim-perceived perpetrators received twice the absolute quantity of media coverage as their non-Muslim counterparts in the cases of violent completed acts. For &quot;foiled&quot; plots, they received seven and half times the media coverage as their counterparts.&quot;

Nathan Lean used the term &quot;Islamophobia industry&quot; in the 2012 book &quot;The Islamophobia Industry: How the Right Manufactures Fear of Muslims&quot; to describe how certain ideologies and political proclivities have converged to advance the same agenda. The &quot;Islamophobia industry&quot; has since been discussed by other scholars including Joseph Kaminski, Hatem Bazian, Arlene Stein, Zakia Salime, Reza Aslan, Erdoan A. Shipoli, and Deepa Kumar, the latter drawing a comparison between the &quot;Islamophobia industry&quot; and Cold War era McCarthyism.

Some media outlets are working explicitly against Islamophobia. In 2008 Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (&quot;FAIR&quot;) published a study &quot;Smearcasting, How Islamophobes Spread Bigotry, Fear and Misinformation&quot;. The report cites several instances where mainstream or close to mainstream journalists, authors and academics have made analyses that essentialize negative traits as an inherent part of Muslims&#x27; moral makeup. FAIR also established the &quot;Forum Against Islamophobia and Racism&quot;, designed to monitor coverage in the media and establish dialogue with media organizations. Following the attacks of 11 September 2001, the Islamic Society of Britain&#x27;s &quot;Islam Awareness Week&quot; and the &quot;Best of British Islam Festival&quot; were introduced to improve community relations and raise awareness about Islam.

Silva and Meaux et al both theorized that one of the main causes of negative interactions, stigma, and marginalization toward the Arabic community is due to the fact that many media framing from news outlets tend to associate Arab-Muslims with terrorism and jihadist-inspired motivations when it came to mass violence incidents. Silva noted in their research looking through New York Times articles about gun violence and noted that over the sixteen-year period of 2000 until 2016 this media framing would only increase through the time period. Silva compared his results to find out that Arabic perpetrators were significantly more like to be framed as terrorists than their White counterparts. Meaux et al note back to research conducted by Park et al that indicated that the most salient association that Americans held on to was Arab-Muslims to terrorism with the notion that people that believed in this association the strongest were more likely to hold implicit bias.

=== Movies ===

Throughout the twentieth century, Muslim characters were portrayed in Hollywood often negatively and with Orientalist stereotypes visualising them as being &quot;uncivilised&quot;. Since the Post-9/11 era, in addition to these tropes, a securitization of Muslims; portraying them as a threat to the Western world, have drastically increased in movie depictions.

There are growing instances of Islamophobia in Hindi cinema, or Bollywood, in films such as &quot;Aamir&quot; (2008), &quot;New York&quot; (2009) and &quot;My Name is Khan&quot; (2010), which corresponds to a growing anti-minorities sentiment that followed the resurgence of the Hindu right.

===Organizations===
A report from the University of California Berkeley and the Council on American–Islamic Relations estimated that was funded to 33 groups whose primary purpose was &quot;to promote prejudice against, or hatred of, Islam and Muslims&quot; in the United States between 2008 and 2013, with a total of 74 groups contributing to Islamophobia in the United States during that period.

Stop Islamization of America (SIOA) and the &quot;Freedom Defense Initiative&quot; are designated as hate groups by the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center. In August 2012 SIOA generated media publicity by sponsoring billboards in New York City Subway stations claiming there had been 19,250 terrorist attacks by Muslims since 9/11 and stating &quot;it&#x27;s not Islamophobia, it&#x27;s Islamorealism.&quot; It later ran advertisements reading &quot;In any war between the civilized man and the savage, support the civilized man. Support Israel. Defeat Jihad.&quot; Several groups condemned the advertisements as &quot;hate speech&quot; about all Muslims. In early January 2013 the Freedom Defense Initiative put up advertisements next to 228 clocks in 39 New York subway stations showing the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center with a quote attributed to the 151st verse of chapter 3 of the Quran: &quot;Soon shall we cast terror into the hearts of the unbelievers.&quot; The New York City Transit Authority, which said it would have to carry the advertisements on First Amendment grounds, insisted that 25% of the ad contain a Transit Authority disclaimer. These advertisements also were criticized.

The English Defence League (EDL), an organization in the United Kingdom, has been described as anti-Muslim. It was formed in 2009 to oppose what it considers to be a spread of Islamism, Sharia law and Islamic extremism in the UK. The EDL&#x27;s former leader, Tommy Robinson, left the group in 2013 saying it had become too extreme and that street protests were ineffective.

Furthermore, the 7 July 2005 London bombings and the resulting efforts of the British civil and law enforcement authorities to help seek British Muslims&#x27; help in identifying potential threats to create prevention is observed by Michael Lavalette as institutionalized Islamophobia. Lavalette alleges that there is a continuity between the former two British governments over prevention that aims to stop young Muslim people from being misled, misdirected and recruited by extremists who exploit grievances for their own &quot;jihadist&quot; endeavors. Asking and concentrating on Muslim communities and young Muslims to prevent future instances, by the authorities, is in itself Islamophobia as such since involvement of Muslim communities will highlight and endorse their compassion for Britain and negate the perceived threats from within their communities.

===Public opinion===
The extent of negative attitudes towards Muslims varies across different parts of Europe. Polls in Germany and the Czech Republic (as well as South Korea) have suggested that most respondents do not welcome Muslim refugees in those countries.

A 2017 Chatham House poll of more than 10,000 people in 10 European countries had on average 55% agreeing that all further migration from Muslim-majority countries should be stopped, with 20% disagreeing and 25% offered no opinion. By country, majority opposition was found in Poland (71%), Austria (65%), Belgium (64%), Hungary (64%), France (61%), Greece (58%), Germany (53%), and Italy (51%).

In Canada, surveys have suggested that 55% of respondents think the problem of Islamophobia is &quot;overblown&quot; by politicians and media, 42% think discrimination against Muslims is &#x27;mainly their fault&#x27;, and 47% support banning headscarves in public.

In the United States, a 2011 YouGov poll found that 50% of respondents expressed an unfavourable view of Islam, compared to 23% expressing a favourable view. Another YouGov poll done in 2015 had 55% of respondents expressing an unfavourable view. However, according to a 2018 Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, 86% of American respondents said they wanted to &quot;live in a country where no one is targeted for their religious identity&quot;, 83% told ISPU they supported &quot;protecting the civil rights of American Muslims&quot;, 66% believed negative political rhetoric toward Muslims was harmful to U.S., and 65% agreed that Islamophobia produced discriminatory consequences for Muslims in America.

The chart below displays collected data from the ISPU 2018 American Muslim Poll which surveyed six different faith populations in the United States. The statements featured in this chart were asked to participants who then responded on a scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree. The total percentage of those who answered agree and strongly agree are depicted as follows:

Question 1: &quot;I want to live in a country where no one is targeted for their religious identity.&quot;

Question 2: &quot;The negative things politicians say regarding Muslims is harmful to our country.&quot;

Question 3: &quot;Most Muslims living in the United States are no more responsible for violence carried out by a Muslim than anyone else.&quot;

Question 4: &quot;Most Muslims living in the United States are victims of discrimination because of their faith.&quot;

The table below represents the Islamophobia Index, also from the 2018 ISPU poll. This data displays an index of Islamophobia among faith populations in the United States.
=== Internalized Islamophobia ===
ISPU also highlighted a particular trend in relation to anti-Muslim sentiment in the U.S. – internalized Islamophobia among Muslim populations themselves. When asked if they felt most people want them to be ashamed of their faith identity, 30% of Muslims agreed (a higher percentage than any other faith group). When asked if they believed that their faith community was more prone to negative behavior than other faith communities, 30% of Muslims agreed, again, a higher percentage than other faith groups.

==Trends==

Islamophobia has become a topic of increasing sociological and political importance. According to Benn and Jawad, Islamophobia has increased since Ayatollah Khomeini&#x27;s 1989 fatwa inciting Muslims to attempt to murder Salman Rushdie, the author of &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;, and since the 11 September attacks (in 2001). Anthropologist Steven Vertovec writes that the purported growth in Islamophobia may be associated with increased Muslim presence in society and successes. He suggests a circular model, where increased hostility towards Islam and Muslims results in governmental countermeasures such as institutional guidelines and changes to legislation, which itself may fuel further Islamophobia due to increased accommodation for Muslims in public life. Vertovec concludes: &quot;As the public sphere shifts to provide a more prominent place for Muslims, Islamophobic tendencies may amplify.&quot;
Patel, Humphries, and Naik (1998) claim that &quot;Islamophobia has always been present in Western countries and cultures. In the last two decades, it has become accentuated, explicit and extreme.&quot; However, Vertovec states that some have observed that Islamophobia has not necessarily escalated in the past decades, but that there has been increased public scrutiny of it. According to Abduljalil Sajid, one of the members of the Runnymede Trust&#x27;s Commission on British Muslims and Islamophobia, &quot;Islamophobias&quot; have existed in varying strains throughout history, with each version possessing its own distinct features as well as similarities or adaptations from others.

In 2005 Ziauddin Sardar, an Islamic scholar, wrote in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; that Islamophobia is a widespread European phenomenon. He noted that each country has anti-Muslim political figures, citing Jean-Marie Le Pen in France; Pim Fortuyn in the Netherlands; and Philippe van der Sande of Vlaams Blok, a Flemish nationalist party in Belgium. Sardar argued that Europe is &quot;post-colonial, but ambivalent&quot;. Minorities are regarded as acceptable as an underclass of menial workers, but if they want to be upwardly mobile anti-Muslim prejudice rises to the surface. Wolfram Richter, professor of economics at Technical University of Dortmund, told Sardar: &quot;I am afraid we have not learned from our history. My main fear is that what we did to Jews we may now do to Muslims. The next holocaust would be against Muslims.&quot; Similar fears, as noted by Kenan Malik in his book &quot;From Fatwa to Jihad&quot;, had been previously expressed in the UK by Muslim philosopher Shabbir Akhtar in 1989, and Massoud Shadjareh, chair of the Islamic Human Rights Commission in 2000. In 2006 Salma Yaqoob, a Respect Party Councillor, claimed that Muslims in Britain were &quot;subject to attacks reminiscent of the gathering storm of anti-Semitism in the first decades of the last century.&quot; Malik, a senior visiting fellow in the Department of Political, International and Policy Studies at the University of Surrey, has described these claims of a brewing holocaust as &quot;hysterical to the point of delusion&quot;; whereas Jews in Hitler&#x27;s Germany were given the official designation of &quot;Untermenschen&quot;, and were subject to escalating legislation which diminished and ultimately removed their rights as citizens, Malik noted that in cases where &quot;Muslims are singled out in Britain, it is often for privileged treatment&quot; such as the 2005 legislation banning &quot;incitement to religious hatred&quot;, the special funding Muslim organizations and bodies receive from local and national government, the special provisions made by workplaces, school and leisure centres for Muslims, and even suggestions by the Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams and the former Lord Chief Justice, Lord Phillips, that sharia law should be introduced into Britain. The fact is, wrote Malik, that such well-respected public figures as Akhtar, Shadjareh and Yaqoob need &quot;a history lesson about the real Holocaust reveals how warped the Muslim grievance culture has become.&quot;

In 2006 ABC News reported that &quot;public views of Islam are one casualty of the post-September 11, 2001 conflict: Nearly six in 10 Americans think the religion is prone to violent extremism, nearly half regard it unfavourably, and a remarkable one in four admits to prejudicial feelings against Muslims and Arabs alike.&quot; They also report that 27 percent of Americans admit feelings of prejudice against Muslims. Gallup polls in 2006 found that 40 percent of Americans admit to prejudice against Muslims, and 39 percent believe Muslims should carry special identification. These trends have only worsened with the use of Islamophobia as a campaign tactic during the 2008 American presidential election (with several Republican politicians and pundits, including Donald Trump, asserting that Democratic candidate Barack Obama is secretly a Muslim), during the 2010 mid-term elections (during which a proposed Islamic community center was dubbed the &quot;Ground Zero Mosque&quot;), and the 2016 presidential election, during which Republican nominee Donald Trump proposed banning the entrance into the country of all Muslims. Associate Professor Deepa Kumar writes that &quot;Islamophobia is about politics rather than religion per se&quot; and that modern-day demonization of Arabs and Muslims by US politicians and others is racist and Islamophobic, and employed in support of what she describes as an unjust war. About the public impact of this rhetoric, she says that &quot;One of the consequences of the relentless attacks on Islam and Muslims by politicians and the media is that Islamophobic sentiment is on the rise.&quot; She also chides some &quot;people on the left&quot; for using the same &quot;Islamophobic logic as the Bush regime&quot;. In this regard, Kumar confirms the assertions of Stephen Sheehi, who &quot;conceptualises Islamophobia as an ideological formation within the context of the American empire. Doing so &quot;allows us to remove it from the hands of &#x27;culture&#x27; or from the myth of a single creator or progenitor, whether it be a person, organisation or community.&quot; An ideological formation, in this telling, is a constellation of networks that produce, proliferate, benefit from, and traffic in Islamophobic discourses.&quot;

The writer and scholar on religion Reza Aslan has said that &quot;Islamophobia has become so mainstream in this country that Americans have been trained to expect violence against Muslims – not excuse it, but expect it&quot;.

A January 2010 British Social Attitudes Survey found that the British public &quot;is far more likely to hold negative views of Muslims than of any other religious group,&quot; with &quot;just one in four&quot; feeling &quot;positively about Islam&quot;, and a &quot;majority of the country would be concerned if a mosque was built in their area, while only 15 per cent expressed similar qualms about the opening of a church.&quot;

A 2016 report by CAIR and University of California, Berkeley&#x27;s Center for Race and Gender said that groups promoting islamophobia in the US had access to US$206 million between 2008 and 2013. The author of the report said that &quot;The hate that these groups are funding and inciting is having real consequences like attacks on mosques all over the country and new laws discriminating against Muslims in America.&quot;

In the United States, religious discrimination against Muslims has become a significant issue of concern. In 2018, The Institute for Social Policy and Understanding found that out of the groups studied, Muslims are the most likely faith community to experience religious discrimination, the data having been that way since 2015. Despite 61% of Muslims reporting experiencing religious discrimination at some level and 62% reporting that most Americans held negative stereotypes about their community,  23% reported that their faith made them feel &quot;out of place in the world&quot;. There are intersections with racial identity and gender identity, with 73% of Arabs surveyed being more likely to experience religious discrimination, and Muslim women (75%) and youth (75%) being the most likely to report experiencing racial discrimination. The study also found that, although, &quot;most Muslims (86%) express pride in their faith identity, they are the most likely group studied to agree that others want them to feel shame for that identity (30% of Muslims vs. 12% of Jews, 16% of non-affiliated, and 4–6% of Christian groups).&quot;

A 2021 survey affiliated with Newcastle University found that 83% of Muslims in Scotland said they experienced Islamophobia such as verbal or physical attacks. 75% of them said Islamophobia is a regular or everyday issue in Scottish society and 78% believed it was getting worse.

===Anti-Islamic hate crimes data in the United States===


Data on types of hate crimes have been collected by the U.S. FBI since 1992, to carry out the dictates of the 1990 Hate Crime Statistics Act. Hate crime offenses include crimes against persons (such as assaults) and against property (such as arson), and are classified by various race-based, religion-based, and other motivations.

The data show that recorded anti-Islamic hate crimes in the United States jumped dramatically in 2001. Anti-Islamic hate crimes then subsided, but continued at a significantly higher pace than in pre-2001 years. The step up is in contrast to decreases in total hate crimes and to the decline in overall crime in the U.S. since the 1990s.

Specifically, the FBI&#x27;s annual hate crimes statistics reports from 1996 to 2013 document average numbers of anti-Islamic offenses at 31 per year before 2001, then a leap to 546 in 2001 (the year of 9-11 attacks), and averaging 159 per since. Among those offenses are anti-Islamic arson incidents which have a similar pattern: arson incidents averaged 0.4 per year pre-2001, jumped to 18 in 2001, and averaged 1.5 annually since.

Year-by-year anti-Islamic hate crimes, all hate crimes, and arson subtotals are as follows:

In contrast, the overall numbers of arson and total offenses declined from pre-2001 to post-2001.

===Anti-Islamic hate crimes in the European countries===

There have also been reports of hate crimes targeting Muslims across Europe. These incidents have increased after terrorist attacks by extremist groups such as ISIL. Far-right and right-wing populist political parties and organizations have also been accused of fueling fear and hatred towards Muslims. Hate crimes such as arson and physical violence have been attempted or have occurred in Norway, Poland, Sweden, France, Spain, Denmark, Germany and Great Britain. Politicians have also made anti-Muslim comments when discussing the European migrant crisis.

According to Yvonne Haddad: The Islamophobia Industry in America is &quot;driven by neocon stars: Daniel Pipes, Robert Spencer, David Yerushalmi, Glenn Beck, Pamela Gellner, Paul Wolfowitz, David Horowitz, and Frank Gaffney as well as native informers Walid Shoebat, Walid Phares, Wafa Sultan, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Ibn Warraq, Brigitte Gabriel, Tawfik Hamid, and Zuhdi Jasser. They have been prolific, producing and re-circulating false or exaggerated information about Islam and Muslims in order to gain lucrative speaking engagements and increase their influence among neocons in government.&quot;

===Research on Islamophobia and its correlates===

Various studies have been conducted to investigate Islamophobia and its correlates among majority populations and among Muslim minorities themselves. To start with, an experimental study showed that anti-Muslim attitudes may be stronger than more general xenophobic attitudes. Moreover, studies indicate that anti-Muslim prejudice among majority populations is primarily explained by the perception of Muslims as a cultural threat, rather than as a threat towards the respective nation&#x27;s economy.

Studies focusing on the experience of Islamophobia among Muslims have shown that the experience of religious discrimination is associated with lower national identification and higher religious identification. In other words, religious discrimination seems to lead Muslims to increase their identification with their religion and to decrease their identification with their nation of residence. Some studies further indicate that societal Islamophobia negatively influences Muslim minorities&#x27; health. One of the studies showed that the perception of an Islamophobic society is associated with more psychological problems, such as depression and nervousness, regardless whether the respective individual had personally experienced religious discrimination. As the authors of the study suggest, anti-discrimination laws may therefore be insufficient to fully protect Muslim minorities from an environment which is hostile towards their religious group.

Farid Hafez and Enes Bayrakli publish an annual European Islamophobia Report since 2015. The European Islamophobie Report aims to enable policymakers as well as the public to discuss the issue of Islamophobia with the help of qualitative data. It is the first report to cover a wide range of Eastern European countries like Serbia, Croatia, Hungary, Lithuania, and Latvia. Farid Hafez is also editor of the German-English Islamophobia Studies Yearbook.

===Regional trends===
====Anti-Muslim sentiment in Europe====

Muslim immigration into Europe has led some critics to label Islam incompatible with secular Western society. This criticism has been partly influenced by a stance against multiculturalism advocated by recent philosophers, closely linked to the heritage of New Philosophers, including the likes of Pascal Bruckner. Jocelyne Cesari, in her study of discrimination against Muslims in Europe, finds that anti-Islamic sentiment may be difficult to separate from other drivers of discrimination. Because Muslims are mainly from immigrant backgrounds and the largest group of immigrants in many Western European countries, xenophobia overlaps with Islamophobia, and a person may have one, the other, or both. So, for example, some people who have a negative perception of and attitude toward Muslims may also show this toward non-Muslim immigrants, either as a whole or certain group (such as, for example, Eastern Europeans, sub-Saharan Africans, or Roma), whereas others would not.

The European Network Against Racism (ENAR) reports that Islamophobic crimes are on the increase in France, England and Wales. In Sweden crimes with an Islamophobic motive increased by 69% from 2009 to 2013.

An increase of Islamophobia in Russia follows the growing influence of the strongly conservative sect of Wahhabism, according to Nikolai Sintsov of the National Anti-Terrorist Committee.

Various translations of the Qur&#x27;an have been banned by the Russian government for promoting extremism and Muslim supremacy. Akhmed Yarlikapov, an expert on Islam, said the Bible too could be banned just as easily for identical motives.

Anti-Muslim rhetoric is on the rise in Georgia. In Greece, Islamophobia accompanies anti-immigrant sentiment, as immigrants are now 15% of the country&#x27;s population and 90% of the EU&#x27;s illegal entries are through Greece. In France Islamophobia is tied, in part, to the nation&#x27;s long-standing tradition of secularism. With the popularization of the Bulgarian nationalist party ATAKA, Islamophobia in Bulgaria also showed an increase. The party itself participated in the 2011 Banya Bashi Mosque clashes. In Myanmar (Burma) the 969 Movement has been accused of events such as the 2012 Rakhine State riots.

====Anti-Muslim sentiment elsewhere====

A report from Australia has found that &quot;except for Anglicans, all Christian groups have Islamophobia scores higher than the national average&quot; and that &quot;among the followers of non-Christian religious affiliations, Buddhists and Hindus [also] have significantly higher Islamophobia scores.&quot;

Following the San Bernardino attack in 2015, Donald Trump, then a candidate for President, proposed &quot;a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States, until we can figure out what the hell is going on&quot;. Throughout the campaign, Trump repeatedly described Islam and Muslim immigrants and refugees as a threat to the West, and condemned current President Barack Obama for not referring to Islamic State militants as &quot;Islamic terrorists&quot; or &quot;radical Muslims&quot;, accusing Obama of cowardice in the face of radical Islam and claiming that Obama had &quot;founded ISIS&quot; through his foreign policy. Trump&#x27;s rhetoric was condemned by his opponent, Hillary Clinton, as well as numerous Muslim advocacy groups and activists, and became a focal issue in the 2016 United States presidential election.

In 2016, the South Thailand Insurgency, having caused more than 6,500 deaths and purportedly fuelled in part by the Thai military&#x27;s harsh tactics, was reported to be increasing Islamophobia in the country. The Mindanao conflict in the Philippines has also fuelled discrimination against Muslims by some Christian Filipinos.

The 2018 anti-Muslim riots in Sri Lanka was suggested to have been a possible trigger for the 2019 Easter bombings. Muslims in the country have reportedly faced increased harassment after the bombings, with some Sinhala Buddhist groups calling for boycotts of Muslim businesses and trade.

In July 2019, the UN ambassadors from 22 nations, including Canada, Germany and France, signed a joint letter to the UNHRC condemning China&#x27;s mistreatment of the Uyghurs as well as its mistreatment of other Muslim minority groups, urging the Chinese government to close the Xinjiang internment camps, though ambassadors from 53 others, not including China, rejected said allegations. According to a 2020 report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, since 2017, Chinese authorities have destroyed or damaged 16,000 mosques in Xinjiang – 65% of the region&#x27;s total.

Emigrants from nearly every predominantly Muslim country have immigrated to Canada. According to a 2013 poll, 54% of Canadians had an unfavourable view of Islam, which was higher than for any other religion (Hinduism, Sikhism etc.).

The 2020 Delhi riots, which left more than 50 dead and hundreds injured, were triggered by protests against a citizenship law seen by many critics as anti-Muslim and part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#x27;s Hindu nationalist agenda.

==Countering Islamophobia==
===International===
The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, in its 5th report to Islamophobia Observatory of 2012, found an &quot;institutionalization and legitimization of the phenomenon of Islamophobia&quot; in the West over the previous five years.

On 16 March 2022, UN designated March 15 as International Day To Combat Islamophobia.

===European Union===
The largest project monitoring Islamophobia was undertaken following 9/11 by the EU watchdog, European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC). Their May 2002 report &quot;Summary report on Islamophobia in the EU after 11 September 2001&quot;, written by Chris Allen and Jorgen S. Nielsen of the University of Birmingham, was based on 75 reports  – 15 from each EU member nation. The report highlighted the regularity with which ordinary Muslims became targets for abusive and sometimes violent retaliatory attacks after 9/11. Despite localized differences within each member nation, the recurrence of attacks on recognizable and visible traits of Islam and Muslims was the report&#x27;s most significant finding. Incidents consisted of verbal abuse, blaming all Muslims for terrorism, forcibly removing women&#x27;s hijabs, spitting on Muslims, calling children &quot;Osama&quot;, and random assaults. A number of Muslims were hospitalized and in one instance paralyzed. The report also discussed the portrayal of Muslims in the media. Inherent negativity, stereotypical images, fantastical representations, and exaggerated caricatures were all identified. The report concluded that &quot;a greater receptivity towards anti-Muslim and other xenophobic ideas and sentiments has, and may well continue, to become more tolerated.&quot; The European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia has since released a number of publications related to Islamophobia, including &quot;The Fight against Antisemitism and Islamophobia: Bringing Communities together (European Round Tables Meetings)&quot; (2003) and &quot;Muslims in the European Union: Discrimination and Islamophobia&quot; (2006).

In 2016, the European Islamophobia Report (EIR) presented the &quot;European Islamophobia Report 2015&quot; at European Parliament which analyzes the &quot;trends in the spread of Islamophobia&quot; in 25 European states in 2015. The EIR defines Islamophobia as anti-Muslim racism. While not every criticism of Muslims or Islam is necessarily Islamophobic, anti-Muslim sentiments expressed through the dominant group scapegoating and excluding Muslims for the sake of power is.

On 26 September 2018, the European Parliament in Brussels launched the &quot;Counter-Islamophobia Toolkit&quot; (CIK), with the goal of combatting the growing Islamophobia across the EU and to be distributed to national governments and other policy makers, civil society and the media. Based on the most comprehensive research in Europe, it examines patterns of Islamophobia and effective strategies against it in eight member states. It lists ten dominant narratives and ten effective counter-narratives.

One of the authors of the CIK, Amina Easat-Daas, says that Muslim women are disproportionately affected by Islamophobia, based on both the &quot;threat to the west&quot; and &quot;victims of...Islamic sexism&quot; narratives. The approach taken in the CIK is a four-step one: defining the misinformed narratives based on flawed logic; documenting them; deconstructing these ideas to expose the flaws; and finally, reconstruction of mainstream ideas about Islam and Muslims, one closer to reality. The dominant ideas circulating in popular culture should reflect the diverse everyday experiences of Muslims and their faith.

====Sweden====
Anne Sophie Roald stated that Islamophobia was recognized as a form of intolerance alongside xenophobia and antisemitism at the &quot;Stockholm International Forum on Combating Intolerance&quot;, held in January 2001. The conference adopted a declaration to combat &quot;genocide, ethnic cleansing, racism, antisemitism, Islamophobia and xenophobia, and to combat all forms of racial discrimination and intolerance related to it.&quot;

In 2014 Integrationsverket (the Swedish National Integration Board) defined Islamophobia as &quot;racism and discrimination expressed towards Muslims.&quot;

==Tropes==

=== 72 virgins ===

&quot;72 virgins&quot; is a reference to the heavenly angels in Islamic depictions of heaven, specifically a fairly obscure Hadith describing them as dark-eyed virgin brides waiting for fallen soldiers in heaven.

* &quot;72 Virgins – Uncensored&quot; – The most notable use of this trope was an Israeli militarily psychological warfare unit&#x27;s covert Telegram channel named &quot;72 Virgins – Uncensored&quot;. The channel shared graphic images and videos of Palestinians taken in Gaza.

* &quot;Seventy-Two Virgins&quot; – was the title of a novel by UK Conservative Party politician Boris Johnson.

==Criticism==
Although the term &quot;Islamophobia&quot; is widely recognized and used, its use, construction, and the concept itself, have been criticized. Additionally, the exact meaning of Islamophobia continues to be debated amongst academics and policymakers alike. The term has proven problematic and is viewed by some as an obstacle to constructive criticism of Islam. Its detractors fear that it can be applied to any critique of Islamic practices and beliefs, suggesting terms such as &quot;anti-Muslim&quot; instead.

The classification of &quot;closed&quot; and &quot;open&quot; views set out in the &quot;Runnymede report&quot; has been criticized as an oversimplification of a complex issue by scholars like Chris Allen, Fred Halliday, and Kenan Malik. Professor Mohammad H. Tamdgidi of the University of Massachusetts, Boston, has generally endorsed the definition of Islamophobia as defined by the Runnymede Trust&#x27;s &quot;Islamophobia: A Challenge for Us All&quot;. However, he notes that the report&#x27;s list of &quot;open&quot; views of Islam itself presents &quot;an inadvertent definitional framework for Islamophilia&quot;: that is, it &quot;falls in the trap of regarding Islam monolithically, in turn as being characterized by one or another trait, and does not adequately express the complex heterogeneity of a historical phenomenon whose contradictory interpretations, traditions, and sociopolitical trends have been shaped and has in turn been shaped, as in the case of any world tradition, by other world-historical forces.&quot;

Although a range of Western commentators have expressed objections to the term &quot;Islamophobia&quot;, in his paper &quot;A Measure of Islamophobia&quot;, British academic Salman Sayyid (2014) argues that these criticisms are a form of etymological fundamentalism and echo earlier comments on racism and antisemitism. Racism and antisemitism were also accused of blocking free speech, of being conceptually weak and too nebulous for practical purposes.

The French philosopher Pascal Bruckner calls the term &quot;a clever invention because it amounts to making Islam a subject that one cannot touch without being accused of racism.&quot;

The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation has been criticized for restricting freedom of speech and freedom of religion by describing apostasy and heresy as Islamophobia.

The concept of Islamophobia as formulated by Runnymede was criticized by Fred Halliday. He writes that the target of hostility in the modern era is not Islam and its tenets as much as it is Muslims, suggesting that a more accurate term would be &quot;Anti-Muslimism&quot;. He also states that strains and types of prejudice against Islam and Muslims vary across different nations and cultures, which is not recognized in the Runnymede analysis, as it was specifically about Muslims in Britain. Poole responds that many Islamophobic discourses attack what they perceive to be Islam&#x27;s tenets, while Miles and Brown write that Islamophobia is usually based upon negative stereotypes about Islam which are then translated into attacks on Muslims. They also argue that &quot;the existence of different &#x27;Islamophobias&#x27; does not invalidate the concept of Islamophobia any more than the existence of different racisms invalidates the concept of racism.&quot; In a 2011 paper in &quot;American Behavioral Scientist&quot;, Erik Bleich stated &quot;there is no widely accepted definition of Islamophobia that permits systematic comparative and causal analysis&quot;, and advances &quot;indiscriminate negative attitudes or emotions directed at Islam or Muslims&quot; as a possible solution to this issue.

In order to differentiate between prejudiced views of Islam and secularly motivated criticism of Islam, Roland Imhoff and Julia Recker formulated the concept &quot;Islamoprejudice&quot;, which they subsequently operationalised in an experiment. The experiment showed that their definition provided a tool for accurate differentiation. Nevertheless, other researchers&#x27; experimental work indicates that, even when Westerners seem to make an effort to distinguish between criticizing (Muslim) ideas and values and respecting Muslims as persons, they still show prejudice and discrimination of Muslims—compared to non-Muslims—when these targets defend illiberal causes.

<text>Rogue (also known as Rogue: Exploring the Dungeons of Doom) is a dungeon crawling video game by Michael Toy and Glenn Wichman with later contributions by Ken Arnold. &quot;Rogue&quot; was originally developed around 1980 for Unix-based minicomputer systems as a freely distributed executable. It was later included in the Berkeley Software Distribution 4.2 operating system (4.2BSD). Commercial ports of the game for a range of personal computers were made by Toy, Wichman, and Jon Lane under the company A.I. Design and financially supported by the Epyx software publishers. Additional ports to modern systems have been made since by other parties using the game&#x27;s now-open source code.

In &quot;Rogue&quot;, players control a character as they explore several levels of a dungeon seeking the Amulet of Yendor located in the dungeon&#x27;s lowest level. The player character must fend off an array of monsters that roam the dungeons. Along the way, players can collect treasures that can help them offensively or defensively, such as weapons, armor, potions, scrolls, and other magical items. &quot;Rogue&quot; is turn-based, taking place on a square grid represented in ASCII or other fixed character set, allowing players to have time to determine the best move to survive. &quot;Rogue&quot; implements permadeath as a design choice to make each action by the player meaningfulshould the player-character lose all their health via combat or other means, that player character is dead. The player must restart with a fresh character as the dead character cannot respawn, or be brought back by reloading from a saved state. Moreover, no game is the same as any previous one, as the dungeon levels, monster encounters, and treasures are procedurally generated for each playthrough.

&quot;Rogue&quot; was inspired by text-based computer games such as the 1971 &quot;Star Trek&quot; game and &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot; released in 1976, along with the high fantasy setting from &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. Toy and Wichman, both students at University of California, Santa Cruz, worked together to create their own text-based game but looked to incorporate elements of procedural generation to create a new experience each time the user played the game. Toy later worked at University of California, Berkeley where he met Arnold, the lead developer of the &quot;curses&quot; programming library that &quot;Rogue&quot; was dependent on to mimic a graphical display. Arnold helped Toy to optimize the code and incorporate additional features to the game. The commercial ports were inspired when Toy met Lane while working for the Olivetti company, and Toy engaged with Wichman again to help with designing graphics and various ports.

&quot;Rogue&quot; became popular in the 1980s among college students and other computer-savvy users in part due to its inclusion in 4.2BSD. It inspired programmers to develop a number of similar titles such as &quot;Hack&quot; (1982/1984) and &quot;Moria&quot; (1983), though as Toy, Wichman, and Arnold had not released the source code at this time, these new games introduced different variations atop &quot;Rogue&quot;. A long lineage of games grew out from these titles. While &quot;Rogue&quot; was not the first dungeon-crawling game with procedural generation and permadeath features, it led to the naming of the roguelike genre.

==Gameplay==
The player character is an adventurer. The game starts at the uppermost level of an unmapped dungeon with myriad monsters and treasures. The goal is to fight a way to the bottom level, retrieve the Amulet of Yendor (&quot;Rodney&quot; spelled backwards), then ascend to the surface. Monsters in the levels become progressively more difficult to defeat. Until the Amulet is retrieved, the player cannot return to earlier levels.

===User interface===
In the original text-based versions, all aspects of the game, including the dungeon, the player character, and monsters, are represented by letters and symbols within the ASCII character set. Monsters are represented by capital letters (such as codice_1 for zombie), and accordingly there are twenty-six varieties. This type of display makes it appropriate for a non-graphical terminal. Later ports of &quot;Rogue&quot; apply extended character sets to the text user interface or replace it with graphical tiles.

The basic movement keys (&quot;h&quot;, left; &quot;j&quot;, down; &quot;k&quot;, up; and &quot;l&quot;, right) are the same as the cursor control keys in the vi editor. Other game actions also use single keystrokes—&quot;q&quot; to quaff a potion, &quot;w&quot; to wield a weapon, &quot;e&quot; to eat some food, etc. In the DOS version, the cursor keys specify movement, and the fast-move keys (&quot;H&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, and &quot;L&quot;) are supplanted by use of the scroll lock key.

Each dungeon level consists of a grid of three rooms by three rooms (potentially); dead-end hallways, T-forks, or bending passageways sometimes appear where rooms would be expected. Lower levels can include a maze in place of a room. Unlike most adventure games of the time of the original design, the dungeon layout and the placement of objects within are randomly generated.

==Development==
===At UC Santa Cruz===
The concept of &quot;Rogue&quot; originated with Michael Toy and Glenn Wichman. Toy grew up in Livermore, California, where his father was a nuclear scientist. Once a year, his father&#x27;s workplace allowed employees&#x27; families to visit, which included allowing them to use the facility&#x27;s mainframe system to play games. Toy took interest in the text-based &quot;Star Trek&quot; game (1971), which represented space combat through characters on screen, and required players to make strategic decisions each turn. Toy took to learn programming and recreate this game on other computer systems that he could access, including the Processor Technology Sol-20 and the Atari 400.

Toy subsequently enrolled in computer science at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) in the late 1970s. Working first on UCSC&#x27;s PDP-11 and then its VAX-11, Toy began exploring what games were available over ARPANET, the predecessor of the current Internet. One game that intrigued him was &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot; (also known as &quot;Adventure&quot;) (1976) by William Crowther and Don Woods. &quot;Adventure&quot;, considered the first text-based adventure game, challenged the player to explore a cave system through descriptions given by the computer and commands issued by the player. Toy was impressed by the game and started writing his own.

Toy met Wichman, another student at UCSC who was also writing his own adventure game. Wichman had created his own variations on traditional role-playing games such as &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; while growing up. Wichman had chosen UCSC specifically to study game design to become a board-game developer, and this led him into the computer sciences to get the opportunity to play and develop games. The two became friends, shared an apartment, and challenged each other with their own adventure game creations. Of the two, Toy was more proficient at coding, while Wichman had a better sense of the design of these games. Toy and Wichman soon found that most adventure games suffered from a lack of replayability, in that the game did not change on separate playthroughs.

Around this time, ca. 1980, BSD Unix had started to gain a foothold as the operating system for many of the University of California&#x27;s campuses. One element of the BSD distribution at this point included the &quot;curses&quot; programming library by Ken Arnold. &quot;curses&quot; enabled a programmer to place characters at any point on a terminal, effectively allowing for &quot;graphical&quot; interfaces. When Toy saw this library, he and Wichman quickly realized the potential for it. After crafting a few games using &quot;curses&quot; to learn the library, they came up with the idea of an adventure game in the flavor of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, but, to address their concerns with the static nature of adventure games, wanted to include elements that would change every time the game was played. The two came up with a narrative, that of an adventurer setting out to explore and find treasures in the Dungeons of Doom, specifically the Amulet of Yendor (a renowned wizard in the game whose name is derived from &quot;Rodney&quot; spelled backwards). Wichman came up with the name &quot;Rogue&quot;, based on the idea that unlike the party-based systems of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, the player&#x27;s character was going at this alone. They also wanted to make sure the name was short to make it simple to type on command lines.

As Toy was more proficient at programming, he led the development of the game in the C language, which generally produced fast, effective code.
Wichman learned the language from Toy as they went along while providing significant input on the design of the game.
The first two major aspects of the game that they developed were the method of displaying the dungeon on-screen to the player, and how to generate the dungeon in a random manner.
Limited by choices of what a terminal could display, they stuck to ASCII characters, such as codice_2 for empty floor space, codice_3 for doors, and codice_4 and codice_5 for walls of the dungeon. They also used the &quot;at&quot; symbol (codice_6) to represent the player, considering this showed the player &quot;where they&#x27;re at&quot;. For the dungeon, they found initial attempts at purely random generation to be weak, in some cases having a stairway ending up in a room inaccessible to players. They found a solution through procedural generation, where each level would start on the idea of a 3x3 tic-tac-toe grid, with each room of various size occupying one space in this grid, and then creating the hallways to connect the rooms. Once they could have their character move about these randomly created dungeons, they added equipment, magic items, and monsters. With magic items, they wanted the effects of these items to be a mystery on each run-through, and thus would initially present the items to the player only by a descriptor such as color, and only later in the game give the true name of the item once the player experimented or used another means to identify the item. For monsters, they wanted to have more advanced intelligence routines as the player got deeper in the dungeons, but had started running into memory limits on the VAX-11, and simply made the monsters stronger with more health to pose more of a challenge.

The two started testing the game with other students at UCSC, finding that despite the limited graphics, players were filling the gaps with their own imagination.
Playtester feedback helped them to improve the procedural generation routines to balance the game&#x27;s challenge.
One element that fell out from playtesting was the use of permadeath.
Toy wanted to move away from the notion of simply learning the right sequence of steps to complete the game, which was usual in adventure games, and instead make the player focus on finding the right moves to avoid the character&#x27;s death at that moment;
Wichman later called this idea &quot;consequence persistence&quot;. Initially, a &quot;Rogue&quot; game had to be completed in one sitting, but by demand of playtesters, Toy and Wichman added the ability to save the state of the game, so that players could continue a game across sessions.
They soon found players were &quot;save scumming&quot;, reloading the game from the save file, an approach counter to their design goals. They changed this so that the save file was erased upon reloading the game, thus making a character&#x27;s death effectively permanent. They subsequently added a scoreboard feature that let players rank their progress with others, rewarding players with more points for surviving as deep as possible into the dungeons and making the Amulet of Yendor a lucrative goal.

Around 1982, Toy&#x27;s attention to &quot;Rogue&quot; and computer games caused him to suffer poor academic performance, and he was kicked out of the school, shortly finding employment at University of California, Berkeley (UCB) in their computer lab. Toy took the &quot;Rogue&quot; code with him to continue its development. Wichman, still enrolled at UCSC, continued to help develop &quot;Rogue&quot; for a time, such as adding armor elements, but the logistics of working over the distance made it difficult for him to keep up, and he let Toy fully take over development.

===At UC Berkeley===
Prior to Toy&#x27;s arrival at UCB, Ken Arnold had gotten to play &quot;Rogue&quot;, which had been distributed as an executable across many of the UC campuses. Though impressed with the game, he expressed frustration at the inefficient means the game updated the screen via his &quot;curses&quot; library over a modem line. He had ideas for how to fix it, but at this point Toy and Wichman had opted not to release the code.

When Toy arrived at UCB in 1982, he sought out Arnold to get insight into the nature of how the &quot;curses&quot; library worked. After the two had gotten to know each other, Toy allowed him access to &quot;Rogue&quot;″s source code. In addition to helping to improve the interface and rendering of the game, Arnold helped to improve the procedural generation aspects of the game.

With its popularity on the UCB servers, &quot;Rogue&quot; was selected as one of the game titles included in the 1983 distribution of 4.2 BSD, which spread across ARPANET and quickly gained popularity among colleges and facilities with access to this hardware. Among its fans included UNIX&#x27;s co-developer Ken Thompson working at Bell Labs; Dennis Ritchie had joked at the time that &quot;Rogue&quot; was &quot;the biggest waste of CPU cycles in history&quot;. &quot;Rogue&quot;″s distribution in 4.2 BSD did not include its source code, so after Toy and Arnold separately left UCB, they took the code with them, making it difficult for anyone to build off it. &quot;Rogue&quot;″s source was eventually added under a BSD software license within 4.3 BSD in 1986, putting it into the open source.

===At &quot;A.I. Design&quot;===
Toy left UCB sometime before 1984 and took a consulting position with Olivetti, an Italian typewriter company that at the time were starting development of their own computer based on the IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC) operating system. There, he met one of Olivetti&#x27;s computer system administrators, Jon Lane.
Lane had previously seen the popularity of &quot;Rogue&quot; among the United States location he managed, had played the game himself, and was familiar with Ritchie&#x27;s observations on &quot;Rogue&quot;.
Upon meeting Toy, Lane proposed the idea of porting &quot;Rogue&quot; to the IBM PC as a commercial product, and Toy agreed.
They founded the company &quot;A.I. Design&quot; to port and market the game. Though Toy&#x27;s source code was necessary for the porting, Lane had to redevelop many of the routines for the game&#x27;s interface. Lane took advantage of the more graphical Code page 437 character set on PC to expand the number of symbols to represent the dungeon, such as using a happy-face codice_7 for the player-character. They also took steps to avoid potential copyright issues with TSR, the company that owned &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; at that time, by changing the names of monsters like kobolds that were unique to that game.

Toy and Lane initially funded the publishing, distribution, and promotion of the IBM PC version themselves, and though they continued to gain sales, they were only able to break even as they lacked the power of a larger distributor.
Around 1984, Robert Borch, the vice president of publishing at Epyx discovered that &quot;Rogue&quot; had become popular with several of Epyx&#x27;s employees, who suggested that Epyx should help fund ports to other systems.
Though Borch felt there was niche appeal to the game, he followed this advice and contracted &quot;A.I. Design&quot; to port the game to the Macintosh and Amiga upon which Epyx would take over distribution and marketing.

Toy obtained a Macintosh and took the lead in porting the game to that system. Toy and Lane recognized that they could implement improved graphics with the Macintosh version, but neither had art skills to make the icons. Toy reached out to Wichman to help with these graphics. Wichman was initially cautious due to the fact that his credit for &quot;Rogue&quot; in the PC version had been cast as a &quot;contribution&quot; equal to the UCSC playtesters rather than as equal to Toy, Arnold, or Lane, but ultimately agreed to help and joined &quot;A.I. Design&quot;. Much of the Macintosh version was developed in concert by Toy, Wichman, and Lane in a cabin at the Squaw Valley Ski Resort. Following this, Epyx requested that Wichman lead the development of the Atari ST version, with the company providing Wichman a system to work on. This work occurred alongside Toy&#x27;s work on the Amiga version. Wichman enlisted help from an Epyx in-house artist, Michael Kosaka, to create the art on the Atari ST version. Epyx would also fund &quot;A.I. Design&quot; to port the game to other systems including the TRS-80 Color Computer.

Borch recognized the difficulty in marketing &quot;Rogue&quot; through traditional methods compared to other games on the market at that time, and opted to push the title through software catalogs rather than retail channels. Though it sold well initially, &quot;Rogue&quot;″s sales quickly declined, and it was considered a commercial flop. Besides the competition from more graphically interesting games, Wichman attributed the failure to the fact that the commercial version of &quot;Rogue&quot; was essentially the same game previously offered for free via BSD and did not pose a new challenge. Epyx eventually went bankrupt in 1989, and &quot;A.I. Design&quot; disbanded. None of Toy, Wichman, Arnold, or Lane profited greatly from &quot;Rogue&quot;, though they became renowned in the industry for their participation on the game.

===Other ports===
In 1988, the budget software publisher Mastertronic released a commercial port of &quot;Rogue&quot; for the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, Atari 8-bit computers, and ZX Spectrum.

Numerous clones exist for modern operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Palm OS, Linux, BSD OSs, and iOS. It is even included in the base distribution of NetBSD and DragonFly BSD.
In July 2024, the Amiga version of the game was re-released for the Nintendo Switch. This version includes modern features, such as display filters, leaderboards, a choice of soundtracks, new achievements, and a save function.

==Automated play==
Because the input and output of the original game is over a terminal interface, it is relatively easy in Unix to redirect input and output to another program. One such program, Rog-O-Matic, was developed in 1981 to play and win the game, by four graduate students in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh: Andrew Appel, Leonard Harney, Guy Jacobson and Michael Loren Mauldin.

Ken Arnold said that he liked to make &quot;sure that every subsequent version of &quot;Rogue&quot; had a new feature in it that broke Rogue-O-Matic&quot;. Nevertheless, it remains a noted study in expert system design and led to the development of other game-playing programs, typically called &quot;bots&quot;. Some of these bots target other roguelikes, in particular &quot;Angband&quot;.

==Reception==
In March 1984, Jerry Pournelle named the version of &quot;Rogue&quot; for the IBM PC his &quot;game of the month&quot;, describing it as &quot;a real time trap. I found myself thinking &#x27;just one more try&#x27; far too often&quot;. The game was reviewed in 1986 in &quot;Dragon&quot; #112 by Hartley and Pattie Lesser in the &quot;Role of Computers&quot; column. In a subsequent column, the reviewers gave the IBM and Mac versions of the game 3½ out of 5 stars. &quot;Compute!&quot; favorably reviewed Epyx&#x27;s Amiga version as improving on the text-based original, stating that &quot;the game will give you many hours of gaming fun&quot;. In 2009, &quot;Rogue&quot; was named #6 on the &quot;Ten Greatest PC Games Ever&quot; list by &quot;PC World&quot;.

==Legacy==

Because of &quot;Rogue&quot;″s popularity at colleges in the early 1980s, other users sought to expand or create similar games. However, as neither Toy, Wichman, nor Arnold released the source code of the game, these efforts generally required the programmers to craft the core game elements from scratch to mimic &quot;Rogue&quot;. Though there were multiple titles that tried this, the two most significant ones were &quot;Moria&quot; (1983) and &quot;Hack&quot; (1982). Both games spawned a family of improved versions and clones over the next several years, leading to a wide number of games in a similar flavor. These games, which generally feature turn-based exploration and combat in a high fantasy setting in a procedurally generated dungeon and employing permadeath, are named roguelike games in honor of &quot;Rogue&quot;″s impact. Most of the graphical interface conventions used in &quot;Rogue&quot; were reused within these other roguelikes, such as the use of codice_6 to represent the player-character.

Toy, Wichman, and Arnold reunited onstage for the first time in 30 years in an event called &quot;Roguelike Celebration&quot; at San Francisco in 2016.

<text>Rogue is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with the X-Men. Created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Michael Golden, she first appeared in &quot;Avengers Annual&quot; #10 (1981). In her comic book appearances, Rogue is depicted as a mutant, a subspecies of humans born with an &quot;X-gene&quot; that grants superhuman abilities. She is capable of absorbing the life force, attributes, memories, and superpowers of anyone through physical touch. Rogue is initially portrayed as a reluctant supervillain, but she soon joins the X-Men as a superhero and has since endured as one of its most prominent members.

Rogue&#x27;s early history was only revealed over twenty years after her introduction in her self-titled solo series. The backstory written by Robert Rodi established her real name as Anna Marie, though her surname remains unknown. A runaway from the fictional Caldecott County, Mississippi, Rogue is adopted by Mystique and Destiny and inducted into the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. She permanently absorbs Ms. Marvel&#x27;s psyche and Kree powers and, fearing for her sanity, defects from the Brotherhood to join the X-Men to use her powers for good. Although she would later gain full control of her mutant abilities, Rogue considers them a curse for many years as they prevent her from getting close to others, including her on-off love interest and eventual husband, Gambit, with whom she stars in the team series &quot;Rogue &amp; Gambit&quot; and &quot;Mr. and Mrs. X&quot;. A white streak that runs through her hair and gloves that enable her to regulate her powers serve as Rogue&#x27;s visual motif.

Often listed as one of the most notable and powerful female characters in Marvel Comics, Rogue has been adapted in various media incarnations. Anna Paquin portrayed the character in 20th Century Fox&#x27;s &quot;X-Men&quot; film series, while Lenore Zann, Meghan Black and Kieren van den Blink have provided her voice in animation.

==Publication history==
Rogue was first slated to appear in &quot;Ms. Marvel&quot; #25 in 1979 (and artwork for the first half of the story was completed), but the book&#x27;s abrupt cancellation left her original introduction story unpublished for over a decade until it was printed in &quot;Marvel Super Heroes&quot; #11 in 1992, where she absorbed her current powers permanently from Ms. Marvel. Rogue&#x27;s first published appearance was in &quot;Avengers Annual&quot; #10 (1981). Her second appearance and first cover appearance was &quot;Rom&quot; #31 (Jun 1982) tied with &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #158 (Jun 1982), but #158 is also her first X-Book appearance. She next appeared as an antagonist in &quot;Dazzler&quot; #22-24 (Aug-Oct 1982) before joining the X-Men in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #171 (1983). Rogue has also had two miniseries and one ongoing title.

Rogue&#x27;s real name and early history were not revealed until more than 20 years after her introduction. Until the backstory provided by Robert Rodi in the ongoing &quot;Rogue&quot; series, begun in September 2004, her background was only hinted at. This resulted in Rodi&#x27;s version of Rogue&#x27;s origins inadvertently conflicting with earlier information. In &quot;X-Men Unlimited&quot; #4, Scott Lobdell indicates that Rogue ran away from her father after her mutant powers manifested, but in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #182, Rogue reflects that she never knew her father because he had left before she was born, and several issues, including &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #178 and &quot;X-Men&quot; #93, indicate that Rogue was taken in by Mystique and Destiny before her mutation became active.

Chris Claremont said in June 2016 that, had he not left Marvel in 1991, Mystique would have been Rogue&#x27;s real mother. It is a storyline that appeared in a 2009 run of the series &quot;X-Men Forever&quot;. Claremont also revealed that the only advice he gave to artist Michael Golden was that Rogue should be inspired by Grace Jones and that she should have streaks of white in her hair. However, Michael Golden did not know what Jones looked like so the visual he submitted did not resemble Jones at all. Still, Claremont immediately approved, telling Golden he &quot;nailed it.&quot;

Rogue was a regular character in &quot;Uncanny Avengers&quot; (2012), beginning with issue #1.
==Fictional character biography==

===Early life===
Her parents, Owen and Priscilla, were married early in their relationship and lived in a back-to-nature hippie commune in Caldecott County, Mississippi. Born as Anna Marie, she enjoyed the attentions of her Aunt Carrie, on her mother&#x27;s side. Anna Marie was raised speaking colloquial English and French, common to the Mississippi bayou area. The commune&#x27;s failed attempt to use Native American mysticism to reach the &quot;Far Banks&quot; results in Priscilla&#x27;s disappearance. Carrie takes over Anna&#x27;s care, and in her grief at the loss of her sister, is a strict and authoritarian guardian. Anna Marie was a rebellious child and, at some point, the exact event or reasons still unclear, she ran away from home as a young teenager.

At some point, Rogue grows close to a boy named Cody Robbins. During their flirtation, Cody impulsively kisses her, at which point her latent mutant power to absorb the life energy and psyche of others with skin-to-skin contact emerges. Rogue is traumatized by the experience, and Cody is left in a permanent coma. Hence, Rogue wears body-concealing clothing that eliminates the possibility of accidental skin contact. She wishes she &quot;did not have to cover up so much around folks&quot; to protect them from her. She thinks of her power as a curse.

Not long after, she is approached by Mystique, who seeks her out on the advice of her precognitive partner Destiny. Mystique ultimately takes Rogue in as a daughter. In time, however, Mystique turns Rogue&#x27;s loneliness, envy, bitterness, and despair into anger, thus recruiting her into the Brotherhood of Mutants.

===Brotherhood of Evil Mutants===
After Rogue&#x27;s mutation had emerged, Mystique begins coaxing her into taking part in terrorist activities as a member of the Brotherhood of Mutants. Rogue initially wanted only a normal life, but after she kissed a boy named Cody Robbins, unintentionally rendering him permanently unconscious with her power, she gave up on normality and begins taking part in Mystique&#x27;s plans.

Rogue and Mystique associated briefly with a mutant named Blindspot, whose power to erase the memories of others by touch somehow counteracts Rogue&#x27;s mutation enough to allow them to make physical contact safely. Blindspot and Rogue became good friends, but when Mystique decides to sever professional ties with Blindspot, Blindspot erased all memory of her from both Mystique and Rogue.

When Mystique debuts her Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, Destiny advises her to keep Rogue out of the action, advice which proves important when several members of the new Brotherhood are arrested and imprisoned. Mystique concocts a plan to free the other members of the Brotherhood by having Rogue absorb Ms. Marvel&#x27;s formidable powers. Rogue attacks Ms. Marvel in San Francisco on her front doorstep as she is returning home from grocery shopping. Due to Ms. Marvel&#x27;s formidable persona, Rogue&#x27;s struggle to absorb her powers is prolonged, and the transfer of Ms. Marvel&#x27;s psyche and powers is permanent. Rogue then throws her off the Golden Gate Bridge. She battles the Avengers using her newly acquired powers.

Much later, while at the Pentagon, she literally bumps into Carol Danvers, leading into a fight with Storm, Wolverine and Nightcrawler of the X-Men. Though Rogue proves more than a match for them, the four of them escape the Pentagon. Later, with Mystique and Destiny, Rogue attacks Angel and Dazzler, but is overpowered by Dazzler. Rogue develops a grudge against Dazzler for her controllable mutation and her relationship with Angel of the X-Men. Rogue is defeated by Dazzler a few times before Dazzler is publicly revealed to be a mutant and goes into hiding. Sometime after this, Rogue, Mystique and Destiny encounter the half-human, half-Dire Wraith entity called Hybrid, with whom the three form an alliance against the Spaceknight, Rom. However, when Rogue seizes an opportunity to use her power on him, she experiences both his loneliness and his nobility. This moment has a profound effect on her and serves as a crucial turning point in her life.

===X-Men===
The more Rogue uses her mutant power, the more her mind becomes filled with fragmentary psychic echoes of the people she absorbs. The permanently absorbed Carol Danvers (Ms. Marvel) is a completely distinct, albeit dormant, personality in her head, and Mastermind subtly exacerbates Rogue&#x27;s psychological distress as a means of revenge against Mystique. Desperate, Rogue turns to Professor Charles Xavier and the X-Men for help. The Professor is unable to do a psychic scan of her, due to the clashing human and Kree portions of her psyche, but nonetheless decides to not only welcome her into the school, but make her a probationary member of the X-Men. The X-Men threaten to leave the school should Rogue be accepted, even though none of the active members aside from Storm and Nightcrawler had even met Rogue before. However, Xavier is adamant and convinces the X-Men to stay.

The team meets up with Wolverine in Tokyo, where his betrothed, Mariko Yashida, greets Rogue with greater warmth than she had received from her own teammates. This kindness later motivates Rogue to take a fatal laser blast to shield Mariko. Feeling indebted to her for saving his fiancée, Wolverine offers to transfer his healing power to her to save her life. She refuses, arguing that it might kill him, but this only serves to gain his trust, and Wolverine touches her to transfer his power anyway. Soon after, she gains the full trust of the rest of the team by using her power on a severely injured Colossus, willingly leaving herself in the same rigid, melted form as he was to allow Healer to heal his wounds.

Overhearing a frantic message from Carol Danvers&#x27; former lover Michael Rossi causes the Danvers persona to become active. Under Danvers&#x27; control, Rogue invades a S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier to rescue Rossi. Her natural persona fights to regain control, rapidly switching back and forth between the two personalities. Though Rogue ultimately regains control, the incident leaves her wracked with guilt over what she did to Carol Danvers.

To defeat Adversary, the X-Men&#x27;s physical and spiritual essences are used as fuel for Forge&#x27;s energy star, which closes the doorway to Adversary&#x27;s plane of existence. Roma, a prisoner of Adversary and guardian of the Multiverse, recreates the fallen X-Men from scratch, making her own minor alterations. Now, invisible to cameras and all forms of detection equipment, the X-Men resettle to Australia, defeating the Reavers and claiming their base in the Outback as a new base of operations.

The X-Men use their new status to attack anti-mutant threats around the world. The island nation of Genosha&#x27;s superpowered agents, the Press Gang, capture Rogue and Wolverine, and Wipeout fully cancels their abilities. Rogue is then sexually molested by her guards. She withdraws into her subconscious, and the Carol Danvers persona takes advantage of her distress by assuming control.

The Danvers personality eventually grows so strong that Carol replaces Rogue&#x27;s standard X-Men costume with Ms. Marvel&#x27;s uniform during battle, as well as redecorating Rogue&#x27;s room to her own tastes without her permission.

===Return===
Sacrificing herself to stop Master Mold, Rogue is pulled through the Siege Perilous, where she is judged by other-dimensional forces with the promise of a &quot;new life&quot;. Rogue is purged of the remaining portions of Carol Danvers&#x27;s personality, as well as Carol&#x27;s powers, and teleported back to the X-Men&#x27;s Outback base. She finds it has been taken over by the Reavers in her absence, and the now-physically separate Danvers persona attacks her. Rogue flees, absorbing the powers of the mutant Gateway to teleport herself to safety. She ends up in the Savage Land, and spends the ensuing days learning how to survive in the inhospitable land. She is eventually attacked again by Danvers, who is now under the mental enslavement of Shadow King. There is not enough life force between the two to sustain both Rogue and Danvers physically as a result of the separation, and Rogue is unwilling to kill Danvers. With Danvers on the verge of draining Rogue&#x27;s life completely, Magneto intervenes and kills the Ms. Marvel persona.

Rogue and Magneto join forces with Ka-zar and Nick Fury to battle Zaladane, who is trying to conquer the Savage Land. Once Zaladane is defeated and helpless, Magneto kills her, against Rogue and Fury&#x27;s protests, parting ways with the X-Men&#x27;s ideals and methods before flying away. Rogue then flies to Muir Island to rejoin the rest of the X-Men, the powers she absorbed from Ms. Marvel now returned.

The X-Men later divide into two teams to make better use of their large number of active members; Rogue is assigned to the Blue Team, under the leadership of Cyclops and alongside new X-Man Gambit. Upon his arrival, Gambit flirts with each of the female members of the team; however, Rogue immediately catches his eye, and he makes no secret of his romantic desire for her. The development of Rogue and Gambit&#x27;s relationship is slow and rocky, partly as a result of her inability to control her powers and partly as a result of long-term issues with previous relationships on Gambit&#x27;s part.

As an act of penance, Rogue continues to visit Cody Robbins at a hospice run by a religious order. He is later abducted by assassins sent by Gambit&#x27;s ex-wife, Bella Donna Boudreaux, as part of a revenge plot against Rogue. Cody is used as a pawn in the ensuing fight between Rogue and Candra and eventually dies. Through a spiritual healer of Bella Donna, Tante Mattie, Rogue is able to make amends with Cody&#x27;s spirit. He holds no hard feelings against her, knowing what happened was an accident, and urges her to move on.

It is eventually revealed that Mystique had two sons: the now-deceased anti-mutant politician Graydon Creed and Rogue&#x27;s long-time teammate, Nightcrawler. Rogue and Nightcrawler consider themselves to be siblings, although the revelation has not particularly altered their friendship.

Following the supposed &quot;death&quot; of Cyclops, the X-Men team undergoes major changes, among them Rogue being made the team&#x27;s new field commander. Her even temper and years of X-Men service make her an ideal leader and she continues to lead the team until Storm returns.

When the Galactic Council transforms Earth into a maximum-security penal colony for hundreds of extraterrestrial criminals, Rogue absorbs the attributes of Z&#x27;Cann; a mutant, telepathic Skrull who had joined Cadre K, Xavier&#x27;s Skrull equivalent to the X-Men. Z&#x27;Cann purposely touches Rogue to activate her mutant abilities, as the two evade bounty hunters. Z&#x27;Cann uses her telepathy to amplify Rogue&#x27;s capacity to assimilate memories, causing her powers to mutate. Henceforth, Rogue is able to &quot;recall&quot; previously absorbed powers, but also finds it increasingly difficult to control which powers manifest and when, typically possessing Wolverine&#x27;s healing factor and claws, Cyclops&#x27; optic blasts and her natural strength.

===X-Treme X-Men team===
Rogue is part of the X-Treme X-Men team led by Storm. The team&#x27;s first mission is in search of Destiny&#x27;s diaries (which prophesy future events). During an invasion of Khan (an alien conqueror from another dimension) of the island nation of Madripoor, Rogue requests that Sage use her power of jump-starting abilities to evolve her to a point where she can control all of the various powers that she has ever absorbed. Sage agrees, and Rogue becomes a one-woman army, able to use the powers of anyone she absorbed in the past all at once.

During Khan&#x27;s invasion, Rogue is also confronted by Vargas who is said to be &quot;a new species altogether&quot;. Vargas foresees himself being killed by Rogue in Destiny&#x27;s diaries and, despite his belief in the prophecies, attempts to stop this occurrence from happening. Thus, in the midst of the invasion battle, Vargas ambushes Rogue as she is trying to rescue Gambit (see &quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot;), spearing both Rogue and Gambit with his blade before escaping. Rogue survives due to possessing both Wolverine and the Hulk&#x27;s powers. Returning to the city shortly after the battle to recover his sword, Vargas is surprised in turn by Rogue dressed in Psylocke&#x27;s costume (Vargas having killed Psylocke earlier for sport). After a lengthy battle, Rogue fulfills &quot;her destiny&quot; by seemingly finishing Vargas off with his own weapon. Returning to Gambit, Rogue, with the help of Jean Grey, forces him from near death in the astral plane.

Following the repulsion of the invasion, Rogue realizes that Destiny&#x27;s prophecies are only possibilities and that trying to follow them is more dangerous than ignoring them. She also learns that she inherited a mansion in New Orleans from Destiny, as well as a sizable fortune, and the X-Treme X-Men team retire there to recuperate. Rogue soon leaves the team with Gambit. After emerging powerless from their ordeals, the two want to explore their relationship further.

After life on the road, the couple ends up living in a beach house in Valle Soleada, a town where mutants and humans coexist peacefully. She works as a motorcycle mechanic, while Gambit is often &quot;on the road&quot; (implying he is thieving or on missions with Storm). She subsequently receives a visit from Bishop and Sage and, after a series of events involving an investigation into the murder of a human girl&#x27;s family, Rogue and Gambit sign up with Bishop and Sage to help Storm&#x27;s X-Treme X-Men stop Sage&#x27;s enemy and former boss Elias Bogan. After the battle, Rogue asks Sage to restore Gambit&#x27;s abilities, which she does. Gambit asks if the same can be done for Rogue, but it is never revisited after Rogue quickly dismisses his comment.

===Back to the X-Men===
Rogue and Gambit return to the X-Men as part of Marvel&#x27;s X-Men Reload. Over time, Rogue&#x27;s own abilities return, although exactly how and when is never revealed or discussed. However, she no longer possesses the abilities she absorbed from Ms. Marvel. Rogue and Gambit are both put on Havok&#x27;s team and participated in various missions.

As described in her own miniseries, Rogue then travels down south to save a young mutant girl from her powers. While there, she meets Campbell St. Ange, a young man immune to Rogue&#x27;s lethal touch. Also while there, Rogue forcibly absorbs knowledge from her Aunt Carrie that explains that Rogue&#x27;s mother traveled to the Far Banks, a dream-realm, to stop her father from getting there. Rogue encounters the incorporeal spirit of her mother therein and absorbs her memories. After the reunion, her mother&#x27;s trapped spirit can finally move on. Rogue subsequently goes back to her Aunt Carrie and makes amends with her.

Rogue then returns to the X-Men and confronts the monstrous Golgotha (large space creatures with telepathic abilities that induce insanity in some by bringing out and, to some extent, amplifying people&#x27;s emotions). As the result of Golgotha influence, Rogue and Gambit get into a fight about the reality of their relationship with Rogue&#x27;s uncontrollable powers. He claims if they were always able to touch, Rogue would have been &quot;just another one-night stand,&quot; that they would have parted much sooner, before leaving. Amplified under the influence of Golgotha, Wolverine&#x27;s hidden emotions come out, revealing to Rogue he desires her in a romantic/sexual way and, in fact, always had. He and Rogue passionately kiss, until both her power affect him, and Emma Frost telepathically interrupts.

While on a trip to Japan to investigate an incriminating photo of her and Sunfire engaged in criminal activities, Rogue and Sunfire learn that Rogue&#x27;s former friend and Brotherhood teammate, Blindspot, erased their memories of the event. In this storyline, Rogue accidentally and permanently absorbs Sunfire&#x27;s fire abilities (who lost his legs to Lady Deathstrike and does not want to live).

Later, back at the X-Mansion, Emma Frost tries to help Rogue and Gambit by providing telepathic relationship counseling, but their relationship continues to be problematic. Rogue then discovers Gambit is being seduced by the student called Foxx. It is later revealed, however, that Mystique, displeased with Rogue&#x27;s choice of lovers, infiltrated the Xavier Institute by shapeshifting into Foxx and joined Gambit&#x27;s squad in an attempt to ruin his relationship with Rogue. After Gambit resists her charms, Mystique reverts to her true form and makes an offer to Gambit; she transforms into Rogue and offers Gambit a Rogue with whom he can have a physical relationship. Gambit later denies to having slept with Mystique. Rogue eventually discovers her foster mother&#x27;s presence in the school and her attempts to seduce Gambit, becoming furious with both parties. Because Gambit fails to tell Rogue of Mystique&#x27;s presence in the institute, their relationship develops the exact rift Mystique is hoping for, allowing her to set up her daughter with her accomplice, Pulse. After being discovered, Mystique asks the X-Men for permission to stay at the mansion. The X-Men vote, and Mystique is allowed to be a probationary member, a decision with which neither Rogue nor Gambit are happy.

===Blood of Apocalypse===
In the events that followed M-Day, the mutant Apocalypse is reawakened. Gambit, seeking redemption from Rogue and his fellow X-Men, volunteers to be transformed into Apocalypse&#x27;s horseman Death. Gambit believes he can control whatever Apocalypse will do to him, in hopes of gaining more power to protect Rogue and the X-Men from the villain. However, having been brainwashed, Gambit tries to kill Rogue (the only part of Gambit&#x27;s past life that remains). After Apocalypse&#x27;s defeat, Sunfire (who is granted new legs and transformed into the horseman Famine) and Gambit leaves the X-Men.

===Endangered Species: Rogue&#x27;s X-Men===
As Professor Xavier goes into space with Havok and several other X-Men to pursue the villain Vulcan, Cyclops gives Rogue the authority to form her own team, complimenting her inspired improvisation in battle situations. She is hesitant at first, because of Gambit&#x27;s recent disappearance with Sunfire, but accepts the position, saying that when he comes back, she will still be at the school. She chooses Iceman, Cannonball, Cable, Sabretooth, Lady Mastermind, Karima Shapandar (Omega Sentinel), and Mystique, a line-up with which Cyclops does not agree.

Mystique seemingly tries to repair her relationship with Rogue, but is rebuffed. Rogue&#x27;s team defeats the group known as the Children of the Vault. Afterward, Rogue declares that her team will leave the X-Mansion.

Rogue is hospitalized after a battle with Pandemic. Cable, desiring Rogue&#x27;s help in defeating the Hecatomb, forces her awake. Pandemic infects Rogue with a virus, Strain 88, altering her powers by amplifying them into an instantaneous death-touch. In defeating Hecatomb, Rogue absorbs psyches of eight billion entities that were stored inside it.

The team moves to Rogue&#x27;s hometown of Caldecott for Rogue to recover. As Cyclops and Emma Frost arrive to help Rogue cope with the immensity of the voices in her mind. Marauders arrive, seeking Destiny&#x27;s diaries. As part of the attack, it is revealed that Mystique is working with the Marauders and for Mister Sinister. Mystique shoots Rogue and takes her back to Mister Sinister&#x27;s base, who only keeps Rogue alive because she holds all the information of Destiny&#x27;s diaries within her mind. Gambit, who joined the Marauders and Mister Sinister again, is protective of Rogue, accusing Mystique of being too careless in how she captured her. Standing over Rogue, trying to get her to wake up (after she fell into a trance, overcome by the minds she absorbed), Gambit expresses his apologies for what he did before rejoining Sinister. While in her coma-like state, Rogue has dream-like flashes of memories, seeing her relationship with Gambit, and the millions of minds she absorbed, before briefly waking up and recognizing Gambit. She tells him she had a nightmare, before spouting incoherent words and mysterious coordinates.

===Messiah Complex===

The X-Men attacks the Marauders&#x27; Antarctic base to rescue Rogue and the mysterious mutant baby who is at the center of Messiah Complex. However, the baby eventually takes precedence and the X-Men do not recover (or even see) Rogue.

Mister Sinister, now in possession of the mutant baby, relocates the Marauders to Muir Island. While standing by Rogue&#x27;s bedside, Mystique is visited by Mister Sinister, who tells her that there will be no cure for Rogue and she will eventually die. Without warning, Mystique ambushes Sinister and shoves his face onto Rogue&#x27;s. The instant contact seemingly kills Sinister.

Mystique, in keeping with the words of Destiny&#x27;s diaries, places the baby&#x27;s face in direct contact with Rogue&#x27;s, with the understanding that Rogue will awaken from her comatose state. The baby is not affected by Rogue, who awakens shortly after. Realizing what Mystique did at the risk of killing the baby, Rogue says she is tired of people&#x27;s lives being destroyed by Mystique and grabs Mystique&#x27;s face barehanded, fully absorbing her powers and consciousness and incapacitating her. However, she immediately regrets her action after realizing that the baby deleted all the consciousnesses she had previously absorbed, along with Strain 88, so that now Mystique is the only one in her head. She says she needs to be alone and tells Gambit not to follow her.

===Being cured===
Rogue takes some time off from the X-Men and travels around the Australian Outback on a motorcycle. She returns to the X-Men&#x27;s former headquarters in Maynards Plains, Australia. Once there, she has a conversation with Mystique (a part of Rogue&#x27;s psyche), telling her that no one else can help her with her powers and that it was down to her to figure out how to control them.

One day, a woman appears in town, claiming to be an anthropologist from Melbourne University. Rogue made it clear she could stay as long as she wants, but to keep out of her way. The anthropologist approached Rogue with questions about some of the items she found in the ghost town. Rogue said she does not know anything about these and to leave her alone. The anthropologist follows Rogue and eventually confesses that she has a different identity. The anthropologist was then targeted by a low flying Shi&#x27;ar spaceship and revealed that she was actually Danger in disguise. She informs Rogue she planned to get revenge on Professor Xavier by using her as a conduit. Danger created an amalgamation of several past events in the X-Men&#x27;s history prominently involving Rogue in the town using her hard light capabilities. As Professor Xavier and Gambit searched for her, Rogue evaded old versions of the X-Men and the Marauders that were part of Danger&#x27;s creation. She was finally cornered by the Marauders and refused to let Mystique&#x27;s psyche take control of Rogue&#x27;s body and save her as the fake Marauder Scalphunter shot at her. Mystique then forcibly took over Rogue&#x27;s body to save her and fought off the Marauders, then returned control of Rogue&#x27;s body to her.

Rogue then wandered to the fake Tokyo Tower and tried to find the institute, deducing that the projections around her were changing at 10-minute intervals, altering the environment around her. However, Rogue did not get far as she ended up in Antarctica, witnessing the moment she abandoned Gambit after his trial. She regretted her decisions there, telling Mystique that she really had not moved on. It was at that point that Cody Robbins appeared before Rogue, repeating his greeting from the night her powers manifested. Rogue just stared at him in shock.

Eventually, the Professor, Gambit, and a group of Shi&#x27;ar pirates managed to shut down Danger. The pirates, in turn, attacked the Professor, as their intent was to kidnap him and Danger for bounty. In the meantime, Rogue enters the scene and attacks the pirates, but is defeated. However, the Professor reactivates Danger and she defeats the pirates in turn. After this, it was revealed that Rogue&#x27;s powers never truly developed past their initial &quot;nascent&quot; stage, which was the reason why her powers never functioned properly. The Professor, now aware of this fact, used his telepathy to tear down the mental walls that kept Rogue&#x27;s powers from developing (the walls were created as a side effect every time she absorbed other people, starting with Cody and even more so with Ms. Marvel) and removed the persistent mental echo of Mystique. Finally, Rogue kissed Gambit, with no ill side effect, revealing that she was finally in control of her absorption power.

===Utopia===
Rogue, Gambit, and Danger decide to go to San Francisco to regroup with the other X-Men. On their way there they are intercepted by Pixie, who teleports them into the city, which is in a state of chaos due to the anti-mutant and pro-mutant movements. Cyclops admonishes Rogue for her disappearance and sends all three out to locate several missing students and bring them home. During their mission, Rogue faces off against the new Ms. Marvel; finding that she cannot touch her opponent, Rogue resorts to a trick and flees the site.

Later on she joins Gambit, who has been injured by Ares, along with Danger. Ares does not take her seriously and dismisses her both as an opponent and her attempts to calm things down. This results in Rogue grabbing Ares and absorbing his powers. Ares is dismissive of her attempt and claims that she cannot absorb him, a boast that proves wrong as she weakens him enough for Gambit to blast him, leaving him bloody and stunned. Having for the moment absorbed some of Ares&#x27; power, she easily dispatches a small group of H.A.M.M.E.R. agents with superhuman strength and proceeds to steal their tank, along with Gambit and Danger, to find the rest of the students.

Rogue finds Trance as her powers are flaring out of control, creating powerful and uncontrollable bio-electric blasts. Rogue tries to help calm Trance and help her gain control when Ms. Marvel appears to fight against Rogue. After taking out Gambit and Danger, Rogue and Ms. Marvel fight; Rogue is losing until Trance regains control and jumps in to help Rogue. Trance learns that her astral form is able to punch Ms. Marvel when they are both intangible. After Gambit stuns Ms. Marvel, they teleport back to base, where Trance receives medical attention.

===Nation-X===
As Utopia has become a safe haven for mutants, the entire population were on high alert following an attack on the X-Men by Emplate, who feeds on mutant bone marrow for sustenance. The X-Men instruct everyone to stay close to each other and report anything out of the ordinary. Bling goes to check out an old amphitheater on her own when Emplate captures her to use as a food source.

Unable to enter Emplate&#x27;s cross-dimensional base, Rogue absorbs Trance&#x27;s astral projection ability to enter the dimension and save Bling. As she investigates his lighthouse home for clues to Bling&#x27;s whereabouts, Rogue was attacked by psychoplasmic ghosts. After fighting them off, she rescues Bling from Emplate.

Rogue also protects the students during an attack by a Predator X herd by absorbing the powers of multiple students.

===Necrosha===
In an attempt to finally achieve godhood, Selene, along with her servant Eli Bard, resurrected many of the X-Men&#x27;s greatest deceased allies and villains under her control. Among the resurrected is Rogue&#x27;s foster mother, Destiny, who attempts to contact Rogue but instead contacts Blindfold. However, Proteus had possessed Destiny when she came back. When she makes contact, he leaves her to possess the body of Blindfold, so he can trick her into convincing a team of X-Men to go to Muir Island, where he hopes to kill them. Eventually, Rogue and a team of X-Men manage to defeat Proteus and Rogue tearfully says good-bye to her foster mother as Destiny once more dies.

===Post-Siege===
Following the &quot;Siege of Asgard&quot;, Rogue was present at the funeral of Robert Reynolds, the Sentry. She stated that Reynolds was immune to the ill effects of her power and that, in a time in her past when she could touch no one else, she had at least one intimate encounter with him. However, between two episodes of psychic blocks that caused Reynolds to completely forget his life as the Sentry, when he regained those memories for a few days, he contacted Charles Xavier telepathically and did not recognize Rogue when he &quot;saw&quot; her through that telepathic bond.

===Second Coming===
During the event in which Cable and Hope return to the present timeline, Rogue is able to sense Hope&#x27;s presence, like Destiny prophesied, although neither she nor Emma Frost can explain it. After a short confrontation with some of Bastion&#x27;s men, the X-Men and Cable decide for a diversionary tactic. Cable, along with some of the X-Men, stays behind (since it was him they were tracking), while Rogue, Nightcrawler, and Hope leave so that their enemies do not capture Hope. To that end, Rogue absorbs the power sets of Colossus, Wolverine, X-23, the Archangel, and Psylocke.

For a while their tactic works, leaving Cable, along with some of the X-Men, to fend off Bastion&#x27;s troops. In the meantime, Kurt, along with Rogue and Hope, teleports across the United States towards Utopia. This, however, exerts him to such a degree that he has to rest for a moment; they are soon confronted by Bastion himself. Seeing no alternative, Rogue attacks him, hoping to buy enough time for Kurt and Hope to flee, but Bastion is able to hit Kurt with an energy blast that knocks him out. Channeling Colossus&#x27;s strength, further enhancing it with Betsy&#x27;s telekinesis and using the individual claw sets of Logan and X-23 along with their healing factors, Rogue is able to inflict massive damage to Bastion. However, Bastion is able to repair himself and overpower Rogue with an energy discharge which briefly incapacitates her. Unable to do anything, she watches with horror as Bastion fatally impales Kurt with his arm.

Rogue is appointed Hope&#x27;s protector while on Utopia and allows her to participate in the final battle, where Hope eventually destroys Bastion. Her actions and choices put Hope in danger and ultimately results in Cyclops suspending Rogue from active duty. She, however, remain as Hope&#x27;s protector and accompanies her to Alaska in search of her real family.

===Collision===
Rogue, along with Magneto, Alani Ryan, and Anole, accompany Indra to India: Indra because his wealthy parents informed him of his brother being ill; Magneto because he wanted to investigate strange anomalies in electromagnetic fields over Mumbai. They are attacked by giant Servidores who are chasing Luz, a young woman who claims to be a mutant, but later turns out to be from Quitado, an alien city populated by lab-created superhumans. Her &quot;family&quot;, the Children of the Vault, tracks her to Indra&#x27;s house where she, Rogue, and Magneto are defeated and taken prisoner. Rogue is sentenced for execution, as the city&#x27;s occupants have a particular anger towards her because she had fought against them and killed many of them when they tried to wipe out all inhabitants of Earth, whom they consider as pests. In the meantime, Luz&#x27;s trick results in the alien city crash landing in Mumbai, which gives Rogue time to knock out her would-have-been executioner.

===Post &quot;Age of X&quot;===
After the events of the &quot;Age of X&quot; storyline, Rogue decides not to wipe her memories. Gambit admits the extent of his feelings for her, but is also frustrated by her indecisiveness. He tells her that it is better they are apart until she decides to be with him for good and that he would be waiting for her when she is ready. She becomes torn between her feelings for Gambit and Magneto. After Rogue confronts Magneto about his past, she spends a night with him, promising nothing else. Afterwards, Rogue joins Professor X, Frenzy, Legion, Magneto, and Gambit on a mission to capture several of Legion&#x27;s personalities that escaped after Age of X. The final battle with Legion&#x27;s personality Styx results in Rogue temporarily absorbing many of Legion&#x27;s powers, which led her to finding the location of Havok, Polaris, and Marvel Girl; the mutants that were left in space after the X-Men&#x27;s mission to stop Vulcan.

After the events of &quot;Schism&quot;, Rogue chooses to be on Wolverine&#x27;s team, noting to Cyclops that he has reached a point where his previous willingness to question his decisions has been replaced by an inability to accept when he might be wrong. She returns to Westchester, New York with Wolverine&#x27;s team to start the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning.

===Avengers vs. X-Men===
Although Rogue was initially neutral in the war between the Avengers and the X-Men, when the Jean Grey School was surrounded by the She-Hulk, the Moon Knight, and the Falcon to stop other X-Men from joining Cyclops&#x27; team, Rogue was forced into action when some students attacked the She-Hulk, declaring her allegiance to Cyclops after Iron Man sent a remote-controlled armor to attack the school. However, Rogue swiftly changed sides again when she witnessed Magik — now empowered by one-fifth of the Phoenix Force — imprison Ms. Marvel in a portion of Limbo that she had brought to Earth. Magik briefly banished Rogue to another world for her defiance, but Rogue was able to return home after helping to resolve a conflict between two alien races, having learned that the leaders of both sides were prolonging the war to keep their populations down to a manageable level. Having returned to Earth, Rogue served as the X-Men&#x27;s representative when appealing to the Avengers for asylum from the increasingly dictatorial Cyclops. In the aftermath, she helped rescue civilians caught in the crossfire, but finally ended her relationship with Magneto.

===Uncanny Avengers===
Rogue attends Xavier&#x27;s funeral alongside Wolverine. Later, after seeing the Scarlet Witch placing flowers on Xavier&#x27;s grave, Rogue confronts her and orders her to leave, blaming her for his death; the two begin a verbal conflict that results in Rogue punching her in the face, though the Scarlet Witch refuses to fight back. Rogue intends to absorb her powers, but it fails. They are then attacked by five mysterious assailants. During this conflict, the Scarlet Witch is impaled while defending Rogue, and the two are both seemingly defeated.

It is later revealed that the instigator behind the attack on Rogue and the Scarlet Witch was the Red Skull, who has since fused his and Xavier&#x27;s brains to give him access to his tremendous mental powers. Despite the Skull&#x27;s attempts to control them, he is eventually defeated by the &#x27;Avengers Unity&#x27; team — including Captain America, Thor, Wolverine and Havok — but manages to escape. In the aftermath, Rogue accepts membership of the team, seeing it as the best way to continue Xavier&#x27;s dream, but notes that she will still not forgive the Scarlet Witch for her actions.

The team makes their debut as the Avengers Unity Squad (which also contains Sunfire, the Wasp, and Wonder Man as the team&#x27;s latest recruits) during a press conference that debuts them. The press conference is then crashed by a resurrected Grim Reaper, who attacks the Avengers Unity Squad while claiming that he is now unable to die. During the fight, Rogue absorbs some of Wonder Man&#x27;s powers and seemingly punches the Grim Reaper harder than normal, which apparently kills the Grim Reaper again.

She was later seen fighting alongside Captain America with the Avengers A.I.

Rogue absorbs Wolverine&#x27;s powers and is told to stop the Scarlet Witch, who is seemingly helping the Apocalypse Twins, but in reality, she plans to use her powers to bring as many of Earth&#x27;s heroes as she possibly can to defeat the Twins. Wolverine tells her that no one is to be killed if it can be helped, but upon seeing Wanda, Rogue goes into a berserker rage and murders her. Rogue is then killed by the recently re-resurrected Grim Reaper, who had been revived once again by the Apocalypse Twins to be one of their four horsemen of death. Her death was undone when Havok and the surviving members of the Unity Squad were sent from the future by Kang to stop the Twins from destroying Earth, their minds projected back into their past selves so that they could not only warn Rogue what was to come, but then arranged for her to absorb the powers of numerous superheroes to give her the strength to hold the Celestial back. Rogue also finally made peace with Wanda and forgave her. After the crisis was over, Rogue was in the process of being driven mad by all the heroes Rogue had absorbed (all of the Avengers and the X-Men). The Scarlet Witch cast a spell to return those powers to their owners, although Rogue still retained the powers and the very essence that she absorbed from Wonder Man. She has also lost her ability to freely touch others.

===&quot;X-Men&quot; (vol. 4)===
In 2013, Marvel revealed a new comic book simply named &quot;X-Men&quot;. Written by Brian Wood, &quot;X-Men&quot; features an all-female cast including Storm, Jubilee, Rogue, Kitty Pryde, Rachel Grey, and Psylocke. Rogue was removed from this series&#x27; cast after the &quot;Battle of the Atom&quot; crossover, to avoid contradicting her death in &quot;Uncanny Avengers&quot;.

===AXIS and return to the Uncanny Avengers===
After her resurrection, Rogue took part in AXIS with the X-Men, her powers allowing her to sense the aspect of Professor X that remained within the Red Skull. During this time, the AUD was disbanded when various heroes underwent a moral inversion due to a spell cast by Doctor Doom and the Scarlet Witch to stop the telepathic Red Skull. In the aftermath, the Unity Division was reformed, with Rogue as leader of the team.

===All-New, All-Different Marvel===
Following the Incursions, Rogue remains as the field leader of the Avengers Unity Squad, although she accepts Steve Rogers&#x27; official oversight and recommendations for membership, such as Deadpool. She is also depicted as suffering side-effects from the mass terrigenesis, requiring regular injections to stop herself from becoming ill or dying. When various Avengers are brainwashed into civilian lives in the community of Pleasant Hill – a S.H.I.E.L.D. project to &#x27;reprogram&#x27; supervillains into regular civilians using fragments of a Cosmic Cube that has since gained sentience – Rogue&#x27;s new identity of Claire sees through the deception thanks to telepathic training provided by Professor X, allowing her mind to plant various clues that lead her to the rest of the team. The same training helps her to resist telepathic attacks by the Red Skull who is keen to use her powers. Later on, the Red Skull attempts to mount a new attack on the team and Rogue succumbs, but Deadpool is able to resist the telepathic attack long enough to get Magneto&#x27;s old helmet on Rogue so that she can resist the Skull&#x27;s telepathy. Rogue subsequently takes the Skull to a new facility where Beast is able to extract the uniquely Xavier elements from the Skull&#x27;s brain, depriving him of Xavier&#x27;s telepathy. Rogue and Johnny Storm incinerate the brain, rebelling against the orders of the HYDRA Captain America. Absorbing Deadpool results in the return of Wonder Man (whom she had previously absorbed). She seems to have at least partially gained control of her powers, as seen when she touches Johnny Storm and is held by Wonder Man. She fights against the HYDRA forces in Washington D.C. during the dictatorship of HYDRA Captain America. She resumes her relationship with Johnny Storm and avenges his apparent death by killing Corvus Glaive.

===Return to the X-Men===
Rogue returns to the Xavier Institute for Mutant Outreach and Education in New York after the incarceration of Kitty Pryde and forms a secondary team with the Iceman, Armor, Ink, Magma, and Magik. Later, Kitty Pryde sends her on an undercover mission with her ex-boyfriend Gambit to the island of Paraiso. Their mission, as an estranged couple requiring relationship therapy, was to investigate the disappearance of mutants. This results not only in them confronting their emotions and relationship challenges, but also finding that their memories and powers (as well as those of the missing mutants) are drained into their clones by a mutant called Lavish. Although they are severely weak, they fight against Lavish and the clones, restoring their memories and powers. The couple decide to reunite and Rogue thanks Kitty for having sent them on the mission. A conversation with Storm and Nightcrawler spurs Gambit into proposing to her at Kitty and Colossus&#x27; cancelled wedding and the couple decide to take advantage of all their friends being present. They are married by the rabbi who was present for officiating Kitty&#x27;s wedding, with Nightcrawler and the Iceman as Rogue&#x27;s bridal party and with Storm and X-23 as Gambit&#x27;s best women.

While in space, their honeymoon is interrupted when they receive a message from Kitty Pryde about a secret package that they must find; however, the unknown package involves the Shi&#x27;ar Empire and several others are after it as well. They soon discover that the package is actually Xandra, who is the bio-engineered daughter of Xavier and Lilandra who can take any form at will. The newlyweds are soon caught by the Shi&#x27;ar but are able to free themselves; with the help of Cerise and the Starjammers, they escape. Having read Rogue&#x27;s mind, Xandra offers to fix her abilities so she can touch anyone; however, Rogue refuses; when Gambit questions her, she explains that the last time it happened, she never learned to control it herself. The ground is interrupted by the Imperial Guard and by Deathbird and a fight ensues. Realizing they are losing the fight, Xandra uses her abilities to make everyone think she and Rogue were killed; after the Imperial Guard and Deathbird leave, they return, only to have Rogue&#x27;s ability become uncontrollable, as she can now absorb memories without touching anyone. Xandra explains that her powers have evolved, Rogue will have to learn to control it on her own; Gambit and Rogue return to Earth.

During the holiday season, Gambit and Rogue are pulled into the Mojoverse. They are, at first, unaware of what is going on due to their minds being wiped and living in a Noir setting until Rogue&#x27;s ability becomes unstable, killing Remy in the process, forcing Mojo to constantly reset their lives to Fantasy, Western, Horror, Romance, Sci-Fi and Comedy. During a reality talk show, Gambit walks off and into a bar, where he meets a mysterious brunette who turns out to be Spiral. She restores his memory and makes Gambit an offer that if he steals something for her, she will help Rogue with her powers and help them escape. Spiral meets Rogue in her mind and explains to her that, until she became self-aware of what her abilities should be doing, she was subconsciously blocking control over her powers.

== Characterization ==
===Mutant powers===

Rogue possesses the mutant ability to absorb the psyche and abilities of another human being or members of some sapient alien races through skin contact. Rogue can absorb the memories, knowledge, talents, personality and physical abilities (whether superhuman or not) of the person she touches, as well as occasionally duplicating in herself physical characteristics of her victim. As a young woman, Rogue permanently absorbs the superhuman powers and the psyche of Carol Danvers, the original Ms. Marvel. This provides her with superhuman strength, stamina, durability, reflexes, speed and a seventh sense. In the ongoing comics, Rogue possesses Wonder Man&#x27;s essence, including his powers and psyche. Her organic tissues are permeated with ionic energy, granting her an array of superhuman abilities. She possesses superhuman strength sufficient to lift well over 100 tons, as well as some degree of superhuman speed, agility and reflexes. In addition, Rogue is virtually invulnerable to damage and is capable of flying at high speeds. Rogue&#x27;s eyes glow in the dark and her vision extends somewhat into the infrared spectrum, allowing her to see in the dark. Her new ionic physiology also grants her a form of immortality, protecting her from age and disease.

Following the conclusion of &quot;Messiah Complex&quot;, Rogue&#x27;s slate is wiped clean. The touch of mutant baby Hope erases all of the previous memories and abilities Rogue has absorbed, including those of the Hecatomb. It also cures her of the Strain 88 virus. Rogue&#x27;s touch now simply steals the memories and abilities of individuals with whom she comes in direct skin-to-skin contact. She controls her powers, making her touch lethal — or non-lethal — at will.

Following the events of &quot;X-Men: Legacy&quot;, Rogue appears to be able to activate her powers at will, as opposed to them being constantly active, as demonstrated when she kisses Gambit without incident. Professor Xavier hypothesizes that her inability to control her powers stem from mental blocks which separate her psyche from those she had absorbed, crippling the development of her powers in their nascent stage. When Xavier removes the blocks, her powers are allowed to develop normally. With this new control, Rogue absorbs all the powers of the New X-Men to defeat a rogue Predator X, with no apparent harm to either them or herself. She uses this new control during her fight with the Avengers, making the Falcon and the She-Hulk immediately unconscious and absorbing their powers without any negative feedback (although she does acquire She-Hulk&#x27;s green skin).

=== Real name ===
For the first two decades of the character&#x27;s existence, Rogue&#x27;s real name was unrevealed; in &quot;X-Men&quot; #24 (Sept. 1993), she tries to reveal it to Gambit while on a date, but he stops her. The first media to give Rogue a real name was the 20th Century Fox film &quot;X-Men&quot;, released in the year 2000, in which her first name was &quot;Marie&quot; (with the official novelization of the film giving her surname as &quot;D&#x27;Ancanto&quot;). &quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot; #31 (Nov. 2003) has Rogue use the name &quot;Anna Raven&quot; while living a civilian life, a joint reference to actress Anna Paquin, who played Rogue in the film series, and to her foster mother Mystique, whose real name is Raven Darkholme.

These two names were combined to create Rogue&#x27;s real name, which was finally established as &quot;Anna Marie&quot; in issue #2 of her 2004 ongoing series. The name was subsequently listed in Rogue&#x27;s profile in the &quot;X-Men 2005&quot; issue of the &quot;Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe&quot; and has been consistently used to refer Rogue both by other characters and by Rogue herself ever since.

Rogue&#x27;s surname remains unknown; alternate-universe versions of the character have used the name &quot;Anna Raven&quot; (&quot;Exiles&quot; #99, Oct. 2007) and &quot;Anna Marie Darkholme&quot; (&quot;Secrets of the House of M&quot;, Jul. 2005). Chris Claremont used the name &quot;Anna Marie Raven&quot; in reference to Rogue in non-diegetic establishing text in &quot;X-Men Forever: Alpha&quot; (May, 2009).

== Cultural impact and legacy ==

=== Critical reception ===
Martyn Warren of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; referred to Rogue as &quot;one of the greatest X-Men of all,&quot; writing, &quot;Rogue made her first appearance in &quot;Avengers Annual&quot; #10 in 1981 and since her debut, she has become one of the most recognizable super-powered mutant members of the X-Men. Her power to absorb the life force of humans and the powers of mutants with physical contact does make her a potentially dangerous ally. But with such a caring heart and an upbeat personality, she always takes a challenge head-on, no matter how difficult it is. With multiple appearances in comics, television shows, and films, she has gained a huge fan base who treasure the many quotes she has delivered over the past 40 years.&quot; Michael Austin of &quot;CBR.com&quot; called Rogue &quot;one of X-Men&#x27;s most popular women,&quot; saying, &quot;One of the most popular superhero teams of all time, the X-Men&#x27;s roster is made up of many different iconic characters. Marvel has also used those characters to craft some of the best stories in comic book history. One of the most important of these characters is Rogue. Although initially a villain, Rogue quickly rose to become one of the most popular X-Men. She has come a long way since her villainous beginnings and has been a part in some of the best X-Men teams and stories ever.&quot; Darren Franich of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described Rogue as one of the characters &quot;who left a significant footprint on X-history,&quot; asserting, &quot;She&#x27;s been a young villain-ingenue and a flowing-hair babe with a Gambit fixation, but there&#x27;s always something fundamentally sad and fascinating about Rogue. Her superpower is tragic at the level of great science fiction: If she touches anyone, she absorbs their powers, their memories, and their whole life. (Touch them too long and they die.) Rogue is how you teach kids about melancholy.&quot; Jacob Threadgill of &quot;The Clarion-Ledger&quot; stated, &quot;Hailing from fictional Caldecott County, Mississippi, the character Rogue has gone from misunderstood villain to one of the most beloved female characters in comic book history as a member of the X-Men. In popular culture, Rogue&#x27;s backstory of isolation as a confused teen who has the ability to absorb fellow mutants&#x27; powers, memory and personality has struck a chord with fans worldwide.&quot;

George Marston of &quot;Newsarama&quot; referred to Rogue as one of the &quot;best X-Men members of all time,&quot; asserting, &quot;Rogue started out as a villain, but for the Avengers rather than the X-Men. Since reforming to heroism, Rogue has become one of the most long running and powerful members of the X-Men.&quot; Matthew Aguilar of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; asserted, &quot;Over the years the X-Man known as Rogue has seen many changes to her powers, costume, and even personality. Those are interesting in their own right, but today the focus is squarely on the many looks she&#x27;s adopted over the years, each of which has its own cadre of fans. The character left quite the impression on the Avengers in her first appearance (1981&#x27;s &quot;Avengers Annual&quot; #10), and ever since she&#x27;s been a stalwart of the X-Men universe. Granted she started out on the wrong side of things, but hey, it doesn&#x27;t matter where you start, only where you finish. Fortune cookie psychology aside, Rogue appeals to fans because of her unyielding charisma, her southern charm, and an intriguing powerset that comes with its own struggles. She can fly, lift a tank, and punch through a wall, but being cut off from physical contact with others has always been a fly in the ointment, and that struggle is an essential part of the character.&quot; Matthew Perpetua of &quot;BuzzFeed&quot; stated, &quot;She&#x27;s easily one of the best characters on a purely thematic level. She&#x27;s a walking, talking metaphor for sexual anxiety, particularly during the AIDS epidemic of the &#x27;80s – she can&#x27;t touch ANYONE without absorbing part of them and potentially killing them. The character has suffered a bit in recent years thanks to writers insisting on giving her control over her powers and reversing a lot of what makes her special, but Rick Remender has done a good job of reconnecting Rogue with her impulsive, surly roots over in &quot;Uncanny Avengers&quot;.&quot; Sara Century of &quot;Syfy&quot; said, &quot;Gambit and Rogue are a couple that becomes infinitely more intriguing due to their ability to find stability with one another. The easier and more lighthearted the dynamic, the sexier it becomes. In more recent days, Rogue and Gambit have gone from being a hopelessly melodramatic and toxic pairing to being the X-Men&#x27;s most endearing couple. They worked through their issues together in therapy and reunited in a surprisingly healthy way. When Kitty Pryde left Colossus at the altar, Gambit took the opportunity to propose to Rogue, and they turned attention from an exhausted relationship to a promising new future together. Without question, Gambit and Rogue are at their very best now, and it&#x27;s refreshing to read a couple who are just flat-out good for one another in a mythos mired so often in frustration and personal tragedy.&quot;

=== Volumes ===
==== &quot;Rogue&quot; - 2004 ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Rogue&quot; #1 was the 26th best selling comic book in July 2004.

==== &quot;Rogue &amp; Gambit&quot; - 2018 ====

According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Rogue &amp; Gambit&quot; #1 was the 38th best selling comic book in January 2018. &quot;Rogue &amp; Gambit&quot; #1 was the 478th best selling comic book in 2018.

CBR Staff of &quot;CBR.com&quot; called &quot;Rogue &amp; Gambit&quot; #1 a &quot;promising first issue,&quot; saying, &quot;I know Rogue and Gambit are one of the canonical Big Romances of superhero comics, but I couldn&#x27;t say for sure that I&#x27;ve ever actually read a comic with the two of them together as a couple. Not that this presents any real barrier to reading &quot;Rogue &amp; Gambit&quot; #1. The issue does a great job of positioning them and their relationship in simple, understandable terms. [...] Given it&#x27;s a story about a couple reconnecting, or failing to, a little awkwardness between the two leads is actually quite appropriate. Whether the art is able to turn up the heat -- and indeed whether the developing relationship of Rogue and Gambit will require it to -- remains to be seen, but this first issue certainly has me crossing my fingers.&quot; Joshua Davison of &quot;Bleeding Cool&quot; stated, &quot;&quot;Rogue and Gambit #1&quot; is an entertaining comic, and I do get what fellow reviewer Joe Glass sees in it. However, it tries to have its cake and eat it too. It&#x27;s not action-heavy enough to feel like a good superhero tale, but it&#x27;s not calm enough to shoot for slice-of-life. While comics like &quot;Hawkeye, Astonishing Ant-Man&quot;, and &quot;Spider Woman&quot; have managed to make that balance work in the past, this one doesn&#x27;t. If you really do like these two X-Men as a couple, then you should definitely check it out. It will likely give you exactly what you want. However, if you&#x27;re looking to be sold on them as a couple, then, like myself, you probably won&#x27;t get much out of it.&quot;

==== &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. X&quot; - 2018 ====

According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. X&quot; #1 was the 15th best selling comic book in July 2018. &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. X&quot; #1 was the 141st best selling comic book in 2018.

Jamie Lovett of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; asserted, &quot;In a very real way, Thompson, Bazaldua, and D&#x27;Armata have with &quot;Mr. and Mrs. X&quot; #1 delivered the comic book that many fans have been waiting their entire comics-reading lives to read. People have been following Rogue and Gambit&#x27;s ups and downs for decades waiting for a series that does the couple justice by celebrating their love rather than leaning on their heartbreak. With Thompson&#x27;s delightful dialogue and characterizations, Bazaldua&#x27;s balance of the intimate and the exciting, and D&#x27;Armata&#x27;s tone-setting, &quot;Mr. and Mrs. X&quot; seems set to deliver equal parts overdue emotional payoff and endearing adventure.&quot; Joshua Davison of &quot;Bleeding Cool&quot; said, &quot;Gambit and Rogue are frigging adorable in this and seeing the excited assistance from the likes of Storm, Jubilee, Bishop, and a mystery guest I won&#x27;t spoil makes this comic click so well. [...] &quot;Mr. and Mrs. X&quot; (not crazy about that name, though) &quot;#1&quot; is a delightfully upbeat comic that brings an endearing and dare-I-say heartwarming wedding issue (that &quot;Batman #50&quot; cheated me on and dammit I&#x27;m still so mad) between two classic and charming X-Men characters. The dialogue is great, the story is fun, and the artwork is great. This one earns a recommendation. Give it a read.&quot;

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; reality, Rogue is brought to Magneto and his X-Men for education in her powers by Mystique. Soon after this, Rogue would battle against Apocalypse&#x27;s son Nemesis (who later became Holocaust) alongside the Scarlet Witch, and would witness the death of the latter. During the next few years, Rogue would express an attraction to both Gambit and the leader of the X-Men, Magneto. She would ultimately become romantically involved with Magneto after he worked out a way for them to touch by surrounding his body in a tight electromagnetic &#x27;sheath&#x27; that prevented her from &quot;actually&quot; making contact with his skin, while still feeling as though she was. The two would later conceive a son named Charles, after Charles Xavier, who was slain by Legion whose target had actually been Magneto himself. The Age of Apocalypse universe was later revealed to have been preserved due to the actions of Jean Grey. Rogue and Magneto, along with that reality&#x27;s X-Men continue their lives. This reality&#x27;s version of Rogue had her uncontrollable absorption abilities and permanently possessed around half of Polaris&#x27; magnetic abilities. Unlike her husband Magneto and Polaris herself, Rogue appeared to prefer to use these abilities to fly and augment her physical strength and durability to superhuman levels.

===Age of Ultron===
In the &quot;Age of Ultron&quot; storyline, Rogue and Havok are a married couple, leading the Morlocks. Captain America approaches them in the tunnels with the intent of escorting Caliban for a trial. However, the meeting is interrupted by the Apocalypse Twins, who are on a mission to kill Captain America. In the end, they kill Havok (when he defends Captain America) and Rogue (when she retaliates for Havok&#x27;s death).

===Age of X===
Rogue appears in the &quot;Age of X&quot; continuity going by the name Legacy (also known as the Reaper). She is not allowed to be in the forefront of battles, but has the sole purpose of using her powers to absorb the memories and powers of dying mutants, as well as those of Captain America after he sacrificed himself to save Fortress X from the Hulk. She becomes curious when Kitty Pryde is caught getting back into the grounds and finds a camera - which, suspiciously, has hundreds of blank photos. This results in her questioning everything and figures that she can get answers only from Kitty, who is imprisoned. She goes against orders and infiltrates the prison, coming across Blindfold and, later, Professor Xavier. After absorbing the Professor&#x27;s powers, she realizes that everything is not what it seems to be. However, she cannot control his powers and unleashes a psychic attack on all mutants in the Fortress. Considered as a traitor, she is hunted by Moonstar and her team. She flees to Logan, who dresses her wounds. She confesses that she is puzzled by how she seems to know Charles Xavier but cannot figure out how; at the same time, his memories paint a different picture of everything. Moonstar tracks her and she is shot down when fleeing. Gambit rescues her, but Magneto seemingly buries them under a pile of rubble for their &quot;traitorous&quot; actions. This was a ruse, as Magneto himself was suspicious and was the individual who dispatched Kitty to take the photos. Following information from Magneto, Rogue and Gambit break into a secret chamber and find that the culprit behind the alternative reality is Moira, an alternate persona of Legion.

===Amalgam Comics===
In the Amalgam Comics limited run, Rogue is combined with the DC Comics character Gypsy to form the new character Runaway.

===&quot;Exiles&quot;===
In the &quot;New Exiles&quot; series, Rogue is from Earth-1009 and comes from a life of &quot;wealth, privilege and sophistication.&quot; Apparently a master thief, she has a different personality from her Earth-616 version. She can absorb others&#x27; abilities and memories through her hands, but unlike the original Rogue, the rest of her body can be touched without ill effects. Moreover, she can keep the borrowed powers and use them at will. In addition, she possesses super strength, durability, the ability to fly, the ability to disintegrate matter with a touch and the ability to heal others&#x27; wounds. Her bodysuit hides mysterious tattoos.

===&quot;House of M&quot;===
The &quot;House of M&quot; Rogue is an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. and part of the Red Guard, working with Wolverine, Mystique, the Toad, Nightcrawler, and Jessica Drew. She plays an important role in the resistance to Magneto. After being contacted by the resistance movement, Rogue briefly touches Layla Miller and appears overwhelmed, as the acquired power emanated from her and awakened others in the vicinity to the reality of the House. In the final battle, Rogue, finally able to unleash her powers to their full extent, tackles both Namor and Princess Ororo and absorbs their abilities, causing her to overflow with power. She even absorbed the powers of Genis-Vell. Due to the nature of Genis&#x27; genetics and powers, half of Rogue&#x27;s body transforms into a seemingly window to a cosmic landscape of black void dotted with stars. During the final battle, Quicksilver finds the cosmically powered Rogue waiting up top. Pietro slams into Rogue and is sent flying back.

===Marvel 1602===
A version of Rogue appears in the Marvel 1602 spin-off &quot;Angela: Witchunter&quot;.

===&quot;Marvel Noir&quot;===
Rogue appears in &quot;X-Men Noir&quot; as Anne-Marie Rankin, one of Professor Xavier&#x27;s students. She has a talent for imitating the personality traits and mannerisms of any person, allowing her to fit into any situation. Professor Xavier considered her a missing link or patient zero in his theories about sociopathy as the next stage of human behavioral evolution.

===&quot;Marvel Zombies&quot;===
During the &quot;Ultimate Fantastic Four&quot; crossover where the Ultimate Universe&#x27;s Fantastic Four visit the Marvel Zombies Universe, Rogue is seen as a zombified hero in one of the panels before the infection spread out.

===Mutant X===
In this darker reality, Rogue operates with a smaller X-Team consisting of Magneto, Nightcrawler, Polaris, Quicksilver, Cerebo, and a metallic-looking Mystique. Rogue herself maintains the steel and ridged skin of Colossus, having unintentionally absorbed his power when her glove disintegrated while she was trying to carry him to safety, and wears a version of Ms. Marvel&#x27;s lightning bolt uniform.

===&quot;Prelude to Deadpool Corps&quot;===
In issue #2, Deadpool visits a world where Rogue and Jean Grey are orphaned kids at an orphanage run by Emma Frost. At a dance where Professor X and Emma&#x27;s orphans can have fun, Rogue can be seen calling Kidpool (a kid version of Deadpool who attends the Professor X Orphanage for Troubled Kids) a dork.

===Professor W&#x27;s X-Men===
Rogue has defected from the X-Men in this series to join Cyclops&#x27; new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. This drastic change in alliance can be partially attributed to the fact Rogue has fully absorbed the powers and life force of the Super-Skrull, gaining his Skrull alien traits, the powers of all the members of the Fantastic Four, as well as Kl&#x27;rt&#x27;s personality and memories. As a result of this absorption, Rogue&#x27;s own personality has become warped, even regarded by her own teammates as acting villainous.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the Ultimate Marvel continuity, Rogue is first introduced in the story arc &quot;Return to Weapon X&quot; as a prisoner of Weapon X and she worked with the Juggernaut and Nightcrawler. In this version, her name appears to be Marian Carlyle. Her powers are exploited to steal sensitive information on the location and layout of the Xavier Institute for Gifted Children. Using this information, agents of Weapon X storm the school and capture the X-Men. Rogue is released along with the X-Men, the Juggernaut, and Nightcrawler, when a combination of the Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy and S.H.I.E.L.D rescues them and destroys Weapon X&#x27;s facility. Though offered a place on the X-Men, she joins the Brotherhood. She later joins the X-Men in the &quot;Return of the King&quot; arc.

In the &quot;Cry Wolf&quot; story arc, the X-Men are attacked by Gambit who kidnaps Rogue and takes her to his employers, Andreas and Andrea von Strucker. They hope to use her powers for &quot;corporate espionage&quot;. In exchange for her help, they promise her they will help her control her powers through a power-dampening material they had developed. She turns them down, feeling that her powers are her penance. Rebuked, they attack Rogue and Gambit. She touches both of them and uses their powers to fend off their guards. The X-Men arrive to take her back, but she turns them down and leaves with Gambit.

Rogue does not appear again until &quot;Ultimate X-Men Annual&quot; #1, in which she and Gambit fight the Juggernaut. Gambit sacrifices himself to save Rogue and she kisses him as he dies at his request. With this kiss, she takes his powers that seemingly override her own, ridding her of her &#x27;death touch&#x27; through several of the books (this also affects Rogue&#x27;s appearance, as she acquires black eyes with red irises). In the subsequent story arc &quot;Date Night&quot;, Rogue decides to rekindle her relationship with the Iceman after she loses her virginity to him (something possible due to her being able to touch him now).

During &quot;Ultimate X-Men Annual&quot; #2, Rogue speaks to Professor Xavier about her concerns regarding Gambit&#x27;s powers still remaining. Xavier theorizes this is only a temporary change and her powers will return within time. Towards the end of the &quot;Annual&quot;, Rogue touches a delusional Nightcrawler and her old powers re-emerge, causing her to start teleporting randomly, and she loses Gambit&#x27;s power, sending her back into the shell of hiding her skin, much to her and the Iceman&#x27;s dismay.

During &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; #77, she loses her arm during a fight with Cable. However, after absorbing some of Wolverine&#x27;s healing power, her arm appears to grow back.

In &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; #80, Cyclops disbands the X-Men following Xavier&#x27;s death. Rogue stays with the Iceman at the Xavier Institute as a student. Xavier later returns and reveals himself to be alive. Rogue once again becomes an X-Man. At the end of &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot;, a Banshee-enhanced Rogue is seen to be a member of Colossus&#x27; team. Her appearance heavily altered, it seems her abilities have been enhanced such that she can call on absorbed abilities, as she has Colossus&#x27; armored flesh and the Angel&#x27;s feathered wings extending from her arms. While telling Cyclops the benefits of Banshee she kisses him. When asked why, she replies &quot;&#x27;Cause I can.&quot;

In &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; #95, she reveals that when her father got drunk he would molest her. Once when he tried to touch her, she took his life. She also appears to have found out who Vindicator was, but before she could elaborate, Vindicator took her out.

Addicted to Banshee, Colossus&#x27; X-Men began to acquire more Banshee from the Acolytes. When they were discovered by the others, a battle raged. She absorbed the Iceman&#x27;s power and kissed him to show what Banshee could allow her, but the kiss was broken off by Firestar. Hostilities ceased when Northstar turns up — alive, but crippled.

After the Ultimatum Wave hits Manhattan, Jean Grey refuses to allow Rogue to join her as she cannot be trusted. Rogue then attacks Department H, absorbing Sasquatch&#x27;s power and attacked Jubilee. It is then revealed that Vindicator is, in fact, John Wraith, whom she blames for ruining her life. She threatens him for help in killing Magneto. They travel to Montreal, where Rogue poses as a stripper to get close to Sabretooth and the Juggernaut. The Purifiers soon attack the X-Mansion and the Juggernaut dies fighting alongside Rogue. Rogue absorbs his powers just before he dies and now permanently possesses them. She then helps the X-Men in their effort to defeat Magneto and his Brotherhood. They do so, but suffer many casualties. Rogue is one of the few X-Men to survive to battle alongside Jean Grey, the Iceman, Shadowcat, Storm, and Colossus. She is last seen helping Jean Grey and the Iceman tear down the Xavier Institute and everything on the estate. They bury the remains of the deceased X-Men in its place.

===&quot;What If?&quot;===
In &quot;What If the X-Men Stayed in Asgard&quot;, Rogue is one of the X-Men and New Mutants to remain in Asgard when she finds that her powers does not affect the Asgardians. She finally ends up falling in love with and marrying Fandral of the Warriors Three, whose place is subsequently taken by Nightcrawler.

In &quot;What If Rogue possessed the power of Thor?&quot;, Rogue accidentally permanently absorbed Thor when she and Mystique attempted to break the Brotherhood out of prison, resulting in her killing most of the Avengers and the Brotherhood when she was unable to cope with Thor&#x27;s power. Although Loki attempted to manipulate her into waging war on Asgard after she was able to lift Thor&#x27;s hammer, the sight of Odin&#x27;s genuine sense of loss allowed Thor&#x27;s remnants to manifest in her subconscious, affirming that he was an ideal as well as a person, allowing Rogue to inherit his power and position as she became the new Thor.

In &quot;What If Mystique had raised Nightcrawler?&quot;, Rogue&#x27;s attempt to free Nightcrawler from the attic where Mystique had kept him to &#x27;protect&#x27; him resulted in him being mortally injured by the Brotherhood when they mistook him for an X-Man; Rogue&#x27;s attempt to use his power to escape resulted in her permanently absorbing Nightcrawler&#x27;s powers and appearance due to the prolonged contact she maintained.

In &quot;What If?&quot; (vol. 2) #114, the heroes taken to the Beyonder&#x27;s Battleworld never returned to Earth. In this reality, Rogue is called Carol, implying that the absorbed Ms. Marvel persona is the dominant consciousness. Because Carol is in control, Rogue&#x27;s absorption powers are under control and she is married to Captain America. They also have a daughter together named Sarah, who inherited some of her mother&#x27;s abilities and is known as the Crusader. This version of Rogue appears to have her original mutant powers, as well as Ms. Marvel&#x27;s powers. It was also shown that she wears Ms. Marvel&#x27;s costume into battle.

In the &quot;What If?&quot; story &quot;Bullet Points&quot;, in which a single bullet changed the history of Bruce Banner, Peter Parker, Anthony Stark, and Steven Rogers, Rogue is seen alongside the X-Men of this reality, and appears in her iconic costume. She presumably has the same history as her mainstream counterpart and possesses both her own mutant abilities and the powers of Ms. Marvel. She later assists her teammates and many other heroes and villains against Galactus and watches as the Silver Surfer dies to prevent Earth from being devoured.

In the &quot;What If Xavier&#x27;s Secret Second Team had Survived Krakoa?&quot; storyline, Rogue is seen as a member of Vulcan&#x27;s X-Men. She seems to possess both her own mutant abilities as well as the powers of Ms. Marvel, as she is seen flying and wearing gloves. Her history is presumably the same as her mainstream counterpart, though she wears a blue uniform and yellow gloves rather than her iconic costume.

===&quot;X-Men: The End&quot;===
In an alternative future featured in the series &quot;X-Men: The End&quot;, Rogue and Gambit are married and have two children named Olivier and Rebecca &quot;Becca&quot; LeBeau. Rogue has also gained complete control over her abilities in this timeline. This Rogue defeats Shaitan and rescues her children from the Neverland Camp, but was ultimately killed by Mister Sinister when he was disguised as Gambit.

===&quot;X-Men Forever&quot;===
In this reality, Rogue has absorbed Nightcrawler&#x27;s abilities when he gave her mouth-to-mouth, granting her Nightcrawler&#x27;s skin and tail as well as exceptional athletic abilities, although this has also left Nightcrawler with Rogue&#x27;s powers and looking like a normal human. Claremont has kept the plot thread from &quot;Fall of the Mutants&quot; concerning the X-Men&#x27;s encounter with Roma intact, and so Rogue is still rendered undetectable to cameras, appearing only as a blur on screen or film. While exploring her new powers, Rogue runs into Spider-Man and spends the night fighting crime alongside him; she suggests that they kiss to see if her original abilities have been affected by her transformation, but they are interrupted by a Sentinel attack before they can actually make contact.

<doc id="162180" wikidata="Q268733" url="?curid=162180" title="Telemarketing">
<text>Telemarketing (sometimes known as [[inside sales]], or telesales in the UK and Ireland) is a method of direct marketing in which a salesperson solicits prospective customers to buy products, subscriptions or services, either over the phone or through a subsequent face to face or web conferencing appointment scheduled during the call. Telemarketing can also include recorded sales pitches programmed to be played over the phone via automatic dialing.

Telemarketing is defined as contacting, qualifying, and canvassing prospective customers using telecommunications devices such as telephone, fax, and internet. It does not include direct mail marketing.

== Categories ==
The two major categories of telemarketing are business-to-business and business-to-consumer.

===Subcategories===
* Lead generation, the gathering of information and contacts.
* Sales, using persuasion to sell a product or service.
* Outbound, proactive marketing in which prospective and preexisting customers are contacted directly,
* Inbound, reception of incoming orders and requests for information. Demand is generally created by advertising, publicity, or the efforts of outside salespeople.

===Service Styles===
* Call to Action, the implementation of outbound telemarketing to &quot;activate&quot; or elicit an action or response from prospects (i.e., entice prospects to visit a client&#x27;s website).
* Appointment Setting, utilizing inbound or outbound telemarketing to create face-to-face or telephone appointments for sales purposes.
* Database Cleansing, the outbound calling of databases with the particular purpose to clean and prepare data (i.e. removing outdated and incorrect data) and contact details for future telemarketing campaigns.
* Surveys, the implementation of telemarketing (can be inbound or outbound) with the particular purpose of collecting data and information from specific target markets for qualitative research purposes.
* Telesales, telemarketing (inbound or outbound) with the specific intention of making an actual sale/transaction over the phone. Often includes the collection of credit card details over the phone for payment purposes, which allows for faster sales cycles and payment confirmation.

==Procedure==
Telemarketing may be done from a company office, from a call center, or from home. It may involve a live operator voice broadcasting which is most frequently associated with political messages.

An effective telemarketing campaign often involves two or more calls. The first call (or series of calls) determines the customer&#x27;s needs. The final call (or series of calls) motivates the customer to make a purchase. Prospective customers are identified by various means, including past purchase history, previous requests for information, credit limit, competition entry forms, and application forms. Names may also be purchased from another company&#x27;s consumer database or obtained from a telephone directory or another public list. The qualification process is intended to determine which customers are most likely to purchase the product or service.

In business-to-business lead generation scenarios, telemarketing often targets perceived decision-makers who might be good prospects for a business product or service. The telemarketing approach is often combined with outreach via email or social media, typically referred to as a cadence. Calls are usually made by sales development representatives with the goal of this outreach being a subsequent meeting—often with an account executive at the vendor organization.

Charitable organizations, alumni associations, and political parties often use telemarketing to solicit donations. Marketing research companies use telemarketing techniques to survey the prospective or past customers of a client&#x27;s business to assess market acceptance of or satisfaction with a particular product, service, brand, or company. Public opinion polls are conducted similarly.

Telemarketing techniques are also applied to other forms of electronic marketing using e-mail or fax messages, in which case they are frequently considered spam by receivers.

==Negative perceptions and criticism==
Telemarketing has been negatively associated with various scams and frauds, such as pyramid schemes, and with deceptively overpriced products and services. Fraudulent telemarketing companies are frequently referred to as &quot;telemarketing boiler rooms&quot; or simply &quot;boiler rooms&quot;. Telemarketing is often criticized as an unethical business practice due to the perception of high-pressure sales techniques during unsolicited calls. Telemarketers marketing telephone companies may participate in telephone slamming, the practice of switching a customer&#x27;s telephone service without their knowledge or authorization.

Telemarketing calls are often considered an annoyance, especially when they occur during the dinner hour, early in the morning, or late in the evening. A common complaint about telemarketing has been that the calls are a nuisance and a distraction. In 1909, one target of the unwelcome calls declared &quot;My telephone is far more of a nuisance to me than it is a convenience&quot;. However, some companies have capitalized on these negative emotions. Since 2007 several forums have sprouted and act as complaint boards where consumers can voice their concerns and criticism. In response, some telemarketing companies have filed lawsuits against these portals. The current legal system in the U.S grants such forums a certain degree of protection through &quot;Communications Decency Act, 47 U.S.C 230&quot; and California&#x27;s Anti-SLAPP law.

===Robotic telemarketing and ringless voicemail===
A recent trend in telemarketing is to use robocalls: automated telephone calls that use both computerized autodialers and computer-delivered pre-recorded messages in a sales pitch. Some can simulate a personalized phone call through personalized pre-recorded messages.

Telemarketing has recently been advanced to implement a programmed women&#x27;s voice as the operator instead of hiring a real woman to perform the task (see example of Samantha West).
This attempt is unsuccessful. However, some scholars argue that such technological advancements reinforce commoditization of a woman&#x27;s speech as a marketable entity and lead to &quot;gendered hierarchy of communication&quot;.

Other tactics, such as ringless voicemail, can directly deliver a voice message directly to a landline&#x27;s or cellphone&#x27;s voicemail. Its original purpose was to provide a nonintrusive method of delivering valuable messages. There has been debate on ringless voicemail causing issues relating to &quot;hijacking&quot; of the voicemail by companies, which would disallow family and friends to access the voicemail.

==Regulations==

In some countries telemarketing is subject to regulatory and legislative controls related to consumer privacy and protection.

=== United States ===
Telemarketing in the United States of America is restricted at the federal level by the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA) () and the FTC&#x27;s Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR). The FCC derives regulatory authority from the TCPA, adopted as CFR 64.1200 and the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act, 15 U.S.C. 6101–6108. Many professional associations of telemarketers have codes of ethics and standards that member businesses follow to encourage public confidence.

Some jurisdictions have implemented &quot;Do Not Call&quot; lists through industry organizations or legislation; telemarketers are restricted from initiating contact with participating consumers. Legislative versions often provide for heavy penalties on companies which call individuals on these listings. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has implemented a National Do Not Call Registry in an attempt to reduce intrusive telemarketing nationwide. Telemarketing corporations and trade groups challenged this as a violation of commercial speech rights. However, the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the National Do Not Call Registry on February 17, 2004.

Companies that use telemarketing as a sales tool are governed by the United States Federal regulations outlined in the TSR (amended on January 29, 2003 originally issued in 1995) and the TCPA. In addition to these Federal regulations, telemarketers calling nationally must also adhere to separate state regulations. Most states have adapted &quot;do not call&quot; files of their own, of which only some states share with the U.S. Federal Do Not Call registry. Each U.S. state also has its own regulations concerning: permission to record, permission to continue, no rebuttaling statutes, Sunday and Holiday calls; as well as the fines and punishments exacted for violations.

September 1, 2009, FTC regulations banning most robocalls went into effect.

Since many telemarketing calls now originate offshore, beyond the reach of US legal or regulatory agencies, the National Do Not Call Registry is usually ignored, as well as FTC regulations, and every possible number is called in an area code block. Some automated services are sophisticated enough to analyze the audio from the answering party, and if it determines that a human did not respond, will call repeatedly until one does or a limit is reached. This may be coupled with a fake Caller ID display (&quot;spoofing&quot;) to mislead the call recipient into answering, or even thinking it is a local number calling. These are not actions of legitimate businesses.

Telemarketing techniques are increasingly used in political campaigns. Because of free-speech issues, the laws governing political phone calls are much lesser stringent than those applying to commercial messages. Even so, a number of states have barred or restricted political robocalls.

The National Do Not Call Registry has helped to substantially curb telemarketing calls to landlines and has also helped with the increasing trend for telemarketers to target mobile phones. As a result, there has been a greater push for mobile applications to help with unwanted calls from telemarketers, like PrivacyStar. These companies have helped to log thousands of complaints to the DNC Registry, since the inception of the registry itself.

=== Canada ===
Telemarketing in Canada is regulated by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), an agency of the federal department Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada. Canadians can register with the National Do Not Call List (DNCL) to reduce the number of telemarketing calls received. Anyone who has received a telemarketing call which is in violation of one or more of the Unsolicited Telecommunications Rules may file a complaint to the national DNCL. The national DNCL operator then forwards all complaints to the CRTC, which determines whether a complaint warrants further investigation, based on their initial assessment.

=== Australia ===
Telemarketing in Australia is restricted by the Australian Federal Government and policed by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). Australian Federal legislation provides for a restriction in calling hours for both Research and Marketing calls.

In 2007 a Do Not Call Register was established for Australian inbound telephone numbers. The register allows a user to register private use telephone numbers. Australian Federal Legislation limits the types of marketing calls that can be made to these registered telephone numbers; however, research calls are allowed. Other exemptions include calls made by charities and political members, parties and candidates however any organisation that is instructed by the recipient of a telemarketing call, not to call that number again, is legally obliged to comply, and must remove the phone number from the organisations calling list(s).

Inbound telemarketing is another major industry. It involves both live operators and IVR—Interactive Voice Response. IVR is also known as audio text or automated call processing. Usually, major television campaigns and advertisers use toll-free telephone number that are answered by IVR service bureaus. Such service bureaus have the technology and call capacity to process the large amounts of simultaneous calls that occur when a toll-free telephone number is advertised on television.

===England/UK===
British police, after noting the high rate of pensioners affected, recommended use of do-not-call registry enrollment to enhance &quot;phone security.&quot; Specific mention was also made of calls from &quot;overseas companies.&quot;

==== Restrictions ====
Telemarketing restrictions in the UK are in place to protect consumers from unwanted and intrusive marketing calls. The use of predictive dialers, which are computer programs that dial telephone numbers automatically and connect the calls to an available agent, can make compliance with these restrictions more challenging. The Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office (ICO), the UK&#x27;s independent regulator for data protection and privacy, has issued guidelines on the use of predictive dialers for telemarketing, which require explicit consent from individuals, clear information about the purpose of the call and the business making the call, an option for individuals to opt-out of future calls, and an accurate and up-to-date call list. Additionally, businesses must ensure that their predictive dialer does not generate abandoned calls at a rate higher than 3% of live calls and must comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) when processing personal data for marketing purposes. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in severe penalties, including fines and damage to a business&#x27;s reputation.

===Finland===
In Finland, call centers employ an estimated 100,000 people, but most work with customer relations in larger companies. 10,000 people are working for companies involved with telemarketing. Telemarketing often is the first job young people get. But it is also a way out or back to the labour market for handicapped, immigrants and pensioners, In Finland, the profession has had a bad reputation because of work-related injuries. The strain on neck, shoulders, eyes and ears can be considerable. Health problems have however been reduced considerably thanks to lightweight headsets, ergonomic working stations and more tasks, like documentation, done automatically by computers.

===France===
The ability to cause a French phone number to appear on a Caller ID display, when the call originates outside of France was removed by a law passed in July 2018; implementation was delayed until August 1 of the following year.
== History ==
The term &quot;telemarketing&quot; was first used extensively in the late 1970s to describe Bell System communications which related to new uses for the outbound WATS and inbound Toll-free services. However, the practice of contacting potential customers by telephone originated in the late 19th century.

A 1903 report documented using the telephone for local marketing by a dry goods store, which reported that it was more effective than &quot;sending clerks or errand boys&quot; to inform potential clients about buying opportunities. In 1909, a department store&#x27;s &quot;general solicitation&quot;, made by telephone to over 1,000 prospective customers, promoted &quot;a carnival of values... an offering of exceptional qualities at prices we have never before been able to make&quot;. A year later, an electric power company&#x27;s practice of calling potential customers at home, noted that &quot;Regarding time of calling it is suggested that between 8 and 9 is preferable, owing to the fact that the head of the house is generally in at that time and a sufficient length of time has elapsed after the evening meal&quot;. By 1912, the practice was established to the degree that a reviewer outlined fourteen specific ideas for soliciting and securing orders by telephone. Telephone solicitation also developed political uses, including in 1908 &quot;get out the vote&quot; calls, and recorded political speeches played for prospective voters. 

=== Telephonists ===
Telephonists, or switchboard operators, were a trans-cultural hiring of switchboard operators (mostly women) which became especially popular in North America throughout the 20th century, partially due to popularity gained through advertising. After the shift from public switched telephone network to computer-based electronic switching system, the job of switchboard operators gradually diminished. However, with the rise of advertising and with the popularity of the telephone use, new jobs, including telemarketing jobs, were created.

=== Women in telemarketing ===
Telemarketing, as was the case with telephone operators, is one of the fields known to be occupied mostly by women. The central reason for hiring women operators lay in the fact that women&#x27;s work was considered a form of cheap labor: female telemarketers earned about one-half to one-quarter of men&#x27;s wages. Women were also considered as more polite and well mannered than male operators. Moreover, the calming, more delicate nature of a woman&#x27;s voice was considered to be women&#x27;s natural quality, although no scientific evidence supports this statement. This naturalization led to normalizing the perception of women as telephone operators and consultants, which is currently reflected in the telemarketing industry.

<doc id="162181" wikidata="Q1756631" url="?curid=162181" title="Hack (video game)">
<text>Hack is a 1984 roguelike video game that introduced shops as gameplay elements and expanded available monsters, items, and spells. It later became the basis for &quot;NetHack&quot;.

==History and development==
&quot;Hack&quot; was created in 1982 by Jay Fenlason with the assistance of Kenny Woodland, Mike Thome, and Jonathan Payne, while students at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School. A greatly extended version was first released on Usenet in 1984 by Andries Brouwer. Brouwer continued to work on &quot;Hack&quot; until July 1985. Don Kneller ported the game to MS-DOS and continued development there. Development on all &quot;Hack&quot; versions ended within a few years. &quot;Hack&quot; descendant &quot;NetHack&quot; was released in 1987.

&quot;Hack&quot; is still available for Unix, and is distributed alongside many modern Unix-like OSes, including Debian, Ubuntu, the BSDs, Fedora, and others. &quot;Hack&quot; has also been ported to a variety of non-Unix-based platforms. &quot;NetHack&quot; is available for almost all platforms which run &quot;Hack&quot;. There is one exception: &quot;Hack&quot; is available, but &quot;NetHack&quot; is unavailable, for the Game Boy Advance.

==Gameplay==

This describes Brouwer&#x27;s version 1.0.3, which is the most canonical version, being the one installed by package managers on Linux systems.

Being developed by one man means the game is more balanced. Even when the player has discovered all properties of monsters, wands, potions, and has fathomed the role of &quot;luck&quot;, the game remains as playable as ever. It may take ages before the player reaches that stage. The player will be helped by rumors: cryptic hints, hidden in fortune cookies.

The object of the game is to delve into a dungeon to retrieve the Amulet of Yendor, and perish with as many game points as possible. The player can start out with a different ability set, such as Wizard or Cave(wo)man. The player confronts various monsters: hobgoblins, leprechauns, acid blobs, bats, centaurs, chameleons, dragons, ghosts, imps, trolls, and has weapons, armor, potions, wands, rings and special items to aid in this, e.g. related to fire there is a scroll, a ring, a monster and a wand, and their interplay is to be discovered.

There is time pressure because the player dies if their food runs out, though food is scattered around the dungeon. There is a limit to how much the player can carry, forcing them to leave valuable items behind. The amount of gold and gems the player possesses when they die increases their score, but holding them comes with a burden of more weight.

The player must enter Hell to recover the Amulet. Entering Hell for the uninitiated just means that &quot;you burn to a crisp&quot;. In &quot;NetHack&quot;, Hell is renamed.

The player encounters special rooms such as shops, crypts, and vaults. Other spatial elements in the game are traps and swamps. As the player&#x27;s experience grows, so do their abilities, score and the need for food.

==Interface==
&quot;Hack&quot; implements a graphical user interface using arrangements of ASCII or Extended ASCII glyphs to represent game elements. Some later ports of &quot;Hack&quot;, on AmigaOS for example, use graphical tiles in place of these letters and symbols.

<doc id="162182" wikidata="Q298827" url="?curid=162182" title="Gaston Leroux">
<text>Gaston Louis Alfred Leroux (; 6 May 186815 April 1927) was a French journalist and author of detective fiction.

In the English-speaking world, he is best known for writing the novel &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; (, 1909), which has been made into several film and stage productions of the same name, notably the 1925 film starring Lon Chaney and Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s 1986 musical. His 1907 novel &quot;The Mystery of the Yellow Room&quot; is one of the most celebrated locked room mysteries.

== Life and career ==
Leroux was born in Paris in 1868, the illegitimate child of Marie Bidaut and Dominique Leroux, who married a month after his birth. He claimed an illustrious pedigree, including descent from William II of England (in French, Guillaume le Roux), son of William the Conqueror, and social connections such as having been the official playmate of Prince Philippe, Count of Paris at the College d&#x27;Eu in Normandy. After schooling in Normandy and studying as a lawyer in Caen (graduating in 1889), He inherited millions of francs and lived wildly until he nearly reached bankruptcy. In 1890, he began working as a court reporter and theater critic for &quot;L&#x27;Écho de Paris&quot;. His most important journalism came when he began working as an international correspondent for the Paris newspaper &quot;Le Matin&quot; in 1893. He was present at, and covered, the 1905 Russian Revolution. 

He left journalism in 1907, after returning from covering a volcanic eruption and being immediately sent on another assignment without vacation time, and began writing fiction. In 1919, he and Arthur Bernède formed their own film company, Société des Cinéromans, publishing novels and turning them into films. He first wrote a mystery novel titled &quot;Le mystère de la chambre jaune&quot; (1907; English title: &quot;The Mystery of the Yellow Room&quot;), starring the amateur detective Joseph Rouletabille. Leroux&#x27;s contribution to French detective fiction is considered a parallel to those of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in the United Kingdom and Edgar Allan Poe in the United States.

Leroux published his most famous work, &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, as a serial in 1909 and 1910, and as a book in 1910 (with an English translation appearing in 1911). &quot;Balaoo&quot; followed in 1911, which was made into a film several times (in 1913, 1927 and 1942).

Leroux was made a Chevalier de la Legion d&#x27;honneur in 1909. He died at age 58 in Nice, France, in 1927.

== Personal life ==
Leroux married twice, first to Marie Lefranc from whom he separated in 1902. Following his separation, he then lived with Jeanne Cayatte from Lorraine, with whom he had a son, Gaston, nicknamed Milinkij, and daughter Madeleine; they married in 1917 after Lefranc&#x27;s death. In 1918, he founded a film production company, Société des Cinéromans with René Navarre and debuted two films &quot;Tue-la-Mort&quot; and &quot;Il etait deux petits enfants&quot;, in which his daughter played the lead role.

&quot;The Gaston Leroux Bedside Companion&quot;, an anthology published in 1980 and edited by Peter Haining, as well as the Haining-edited &quot;The Real Opera Ghost and Other Tales By Gaston Leroux&quot; (Sutton, 1994), include a story attributed to Leroux entitled &quot;The Waxwork Museum&quot;. A foreword alleges that the translation by Alexander Peters first appeared in &quot;Fantasy Book&quot; in 1969 (but no original French publication date is given). Neither &quot;Alexander Peters&quot; nor &quot;Fantasy Book&quot; appear to exist, and the text of the story is, in fact, a word-for-word copy of the story &quot;Figures de cire&quot; by Andre de Lorde which was published as &quot;Waxworks&quot; in the 1933 anthology &quot;Terrors: A Collection of Uneasy Tales,&quot; edited (anonymously) by Charles Birkin. The confusion has sometimes caused Leroux to be erroneously credited with the stories from the 1933 film &quot;Mystery of the Wax Museum&quot;, the 1953 film &quot;House of Wax&quot; (both of which were based on a story by Charles S. Belden) or, particularly, the 1997 Italian film &quot;Wax Mask&quot; (for example, in Troy Howarth&#x27;s &quot;Splintered Visions: Lucio Fulci and His Films&quot;). No such story by Leroux exists, though some confusion may have been the result of chapter IX in Leroux&#x27;s novel &quot;La double vie de Théophraste Longuet,&quot; which is entitled, &quot;Le masque de cire&quot; (translated as &quot;The Wax Mask&quot;).

<text>IEEE 488, also known as HP-IB (Hewlett-Packard Interface Bus) and generically as GPIB (General Purpose Interface Bus), is a short-range digital communications 8-bit parallel multi-master interface bus specification developed by Hewlett-Packard. It subsequently became the subject of several standards. Although the bus was originally created to connect together automated test equipment, it also had some success as a peripheral bus for early microcomputers, notably the Commodore PET. Newer standards have largely replaced IEEE 488 for computer use, but it is still used by test equipment.

== History ==

In the 1960s, Hewlett-Packard (HP) manufactured various automated test and measurement instruments, such as digital multimeters and logic analyzers. They developed the &quot;HP Interface Bus (HP-IB)&quot; to enable easier interconnection between instruments and controllers (computers and other instruments). This part of HP was later (c. 1999) spun off as Agilent Technologies, and in 2014 Agilent&#x27;s test and measurement division was spun off as Keysight Technologies.

The bus was relatively easy to implement using the technology at the time, using a simple parallel bus and several individual control lines. For example, the HP 59501 Power Supply Programmer and HP 59306A Relay Actuator were both relatively simple HP-IB peripherals implemented in TTL, without the need for a microprocessor.

HP licensed the HP-IB patents for a nominal fee to other manufacturers. It became known as the General Purpose Interface Bus (GPIB), and became a de facto standard for automated and industrial instrument control. As GPIB became popular, it was formalized by various standards organizations.

In 1975, the IEEE standardized the bus as &quot;Standard Digital Interface for Programmable Instrumentation&quot;, IEEE 488; it was revised in 1978 (producing IEEE 488-1978). The standard was revised in 1987, and redesignated as IEEE 488.1 (IEEE 488.1-1987). These standards formalized the mechanical, electrical, and basic protocol parameters of GPIB, but said nothing about the format of commands or data.

In 1987, IEEE introduced &quot;Standard Codes, Formats, Protocols, and Common Commands&quot;, IEEE 488.2. It was revised in 1992. IEEE 488.2 provided for basic syntax and format conventions, as well as device-independent commands, data structures, error protocols, and the like. IEEE 488.2 built on IEEE 488.1 without superseding it; equipment can conform to IEEE 488.1 without following IEEE 488.2.

While IEEE 488.1 defined the hardware and IEEE 488.2 defined the protocol, there was still no standard for instrument-specific commands. Commands to control the same class of instrument, &quot;e.g.&quot;, multimeters, varied between manufacturers and even models.

The United States Air Force, and later Hewlett-Packard, recognized this as a problem. In 1989, HP developed their Test Measurement Language (TML) or Test and Measurement Systems Language (TMSL) which was the forerunner to Standard Commands for Programmable Instrumentation (SCPI), introduced as an industry standard in 1990. SCPI added standard generic commands, and a series of instrument classes with corresponding class-specific commands. SCPI mandated the IEEE 488.2 syntax, but allowed other (non-IEEE 488.1) physical transports.

The IEC developed their own standards in parallel with the IEEE, with IEC 60625-1 and IEC 60625-2 (IEC 625), later replaced by IEC 60488-2.

National Instruments introduced a backward-compatible extension to IEEE 488.1, originally known as HS-488. It increased the maximum data rate to 8 Mbyte/s, although the rate decreases as more devices are connected to the bus. This was incorporated into the standard in 2003 (IEEE 488.1-2003), over HP&#x27;s objections.

In 2004, the IEEE and IEC combined their respective standards into a &quot;Dual Logo&quot; IEEE/IEC standard IEC 60488-1, &quot;Standard for Higher Performance Protocol for the Standard Digital Interface for Programmable Instrumentation - Part 1: General&quot;, replaces IEEE 488.1/IEC 60625-1, and IEC 60488-2,&quot;Part 2: Codes, Formats, Protocols and Common Commands&quot;, replaces IEEE 488.2/IEC 60625-2.

== Characteristics ==

IEEE 488 is an 8-bit, electrically parallel bus which employs sixteen signal lines — eight used for bi-directional data transfer, three for handshake, and five for bus management — plus eight ground return lines.

The bus supports 31 five-bit primary device addresses numbered from 0 to 30, allocating a unique address to each device on the bus.

The standard allows up to 15 devices to share a single physical bus of up to total cable length. The physical topology can be linear or star (forked). Active extenders allow longer buses, with up to 31 devices theoretically possible on a logical bus.

Control and data transfer functions are logically separated; a controller can address one device as a &quot;talker&quot; and one or more devices as &quot;listeners&quot; without having to participate in the data transfer. It is possible for multiple controllers to share the same bus, but only one can be the &quot;Controller In Charge&quot; at a time.

In the original protocol, transfers use an interlocked, three-wire &quot;ready–valid–accepted&quot; handshake. The maximum data rate is about one megabyte per second. The later HS-488 extension relaxes the handshake requirements, allowing up to 8 Mbyte/s. The slowest participating device determines the speed of the bus.

== Connectors ==
IEEE 488 specifies a 24-pin Amphenol-designed micro ribbon connector. Micro ribbon connectors have a D-shaped metal shell, but are larger than D-subminiature connectors. They are sometimes called &quot;Centronics connectors&quot; after the 36-pin micro ribbon connector Centronics used for their printers.

One unusual feature of IEEE 488 connectors is they commonly use a &quot;double-headed&quot; design, with male on one side, and female on the other. This allows stacking connectors for easy daisy-chaining. Mechanical considerations limit the number of stacked connectors to four or fewer, although a workaround involving physically supporting the connectors may be able to get around this.

They are held in place by screws, either 6-32 UNK (now largely obsolete) or metric M3.5×0.6 threads. Early versions of the standard suggested that metric screws should be blackened to avoid confusion with the incompatible UTS threads. However, by the 1987 revision this was no longer considered necessary because of the prevalence of metric threads.

The IEC 60625 standard prescribes the use of 25-pin D-subminiature connectors (the same as used for the parallel port on IBM PC compatibles). This connector did not gain significant market acceptance against the established 24-pin connector.

== Capabilities ==


== Use as a computer interface ==
HP&#x27;s designers did not specifically plan for IEEE 488 to be a peripheral interface for general-purpose computers; the focus was on instrumentation. But when HP&#x27;s early microcomputers needed an interface for peripherals (disk drives, tape drives, printers, plotters, etc.), HP-IB was readily available and easily adapted to the purpose.

HP computer products which used HP-IB included the HP Series 80, HP 9800 series, the HP 2100 series, and the HP 3000 series. HP computer peripherals which did not utilize the RS-232 communication interface often used HP-IB including disc systems like the HP 7935. Some of HP&#x27;s advanced pocket calculators of the 1980s, such as the HP-41 and HP-71B series, also had IEEE 488 capabilities, via an optional HP-IL/HP-IB interface module.

Other manufacturers adopted GPIB for their computers as well, such as with the Tektronix 405x line.

The Commodore PET (introduced 1977) range of personal computers connected their peripherals using the IEEE 488 bus, but with a non-standard card edge connector. Commodore&#x27;s following 8-bit machines utilized a serial bus whose protocol was based on IEEE 488. Commodore marketed an IEEE 488 cartridge for the VIC-20 and the Commodore 64. Several third party suppliers of Commodore 64 peripherals made a cartridge for the C64 that provided an IEEE 488-derived interface on a card edge connector similar to that of the PET series.

Eventually, faster, more complete standards such as SCSI superseded IEEE 488 for peripheral access.

== Comparison with other interface standards ==
Electrically, IEEE 488 used a hardware interface that could be implemented with some discrete logic or with a microcontroller. The hardware interface enabled devices made by different manufacturers to communicate with a single host. Since each device generated the asynchronous handshaking signals required by the bus protocol, slow and fast devices could be mixed on one bus. The data transfer is relatively slow, so transmission line issues such as impedance matching and line termination are ignored. There was no requirement for galvanic isolation between the bus and devices, which created the possibility of ground loops causing extra noise and loss of data.

Physically, the IEEE 488 connectors and cabling were rugged and held in place by screws. While physically large and sturdy connectors were an advantage in industrial or laboratory set ups, the size and cost of the connectors was a liability in applications such as personal computers.

Although the electrical and physical interfaces were well defined, there was not an initial standard command set. Devices from different manufacturers might use different commands for the same function. Some aspects of the command protocol standards were not standardized until Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments (SCPI) in 1990. Implementation options (e.g. end of transmission handling) can complicate interoperability in pre-IEEE 488.2 devices.

More recent standards such as USB, FireWire, and Ethernet take advantage of declining costs of interface electronics to implement more complex standards providing higher bandwidth. The multi-conductor (parallel data) connectors and shielded cable were inherently more costly than the connectors and cabling that could be used with serial data transfer standards such as RS-232, RS-485, USB, FireWire or Ethernet. Very few mass-market personal computers or peripherals (such as printers or scanners) implemented IEEE 488.

<text>Interactive voice response (IVR) is a technology that allows telephone users to interact with a computer-operated telephone system through the use of voice and DTMF tones input with a keypad. In telephony, IVR allows customers to interact with a company&#x27;s host system via a telephone keypad or by speech recognition, after which services can be inquired about through the IVR dialogue. IVR systems can respond with pre-recorded or dynamically generated audio to further direct users on how to proceed. IVR systems deployed in the network are sized to handle large call volumes and also used for outbound calling as IVR systems are more intelligent than many predictive dialer systems.

IVR systems can be used to create self-service solutions for mobile purchases, banking payments, services, retail orders, utilities, travel information and weather conditions. In combination with systems such an automated attendant and automatic call distributor (ACD), call routing can be optimized for a better caller experience and workforce efficiency. IVR systems are often combined with automated attendant functionality. The term voice response unit (VRU) is sometimes used as well.

== History ==
Despite the increase in IVR technology during the 1970s, the technology was considered complex and expensive for automating tasks in call centers. Early voice response systems were digital signal processing (DSP) technology based and limited to small vocabularies. In the early 1980s, Leon Ferber&#x27;s Perception Technology became the first mainstream market competitor, after hard drive technology (read/write random-access to digitized voice data) had reached a cost-effective price point. At that time, a system could store digitized speech on disk, play the appropriate spoken message, and process the human&#x27;s DTMF response.

As call centers began to migrate to multimedia in the late 1990s, companies started to invest in computer telephony integration (CTI) with IVR systems. IVR became vital for call centers deploying universal queuing and routing solutions and acted as an agent which collected customer data to enable intelligent routing decisions. With improvements in technology, systems could use speaker-independent voice recognition of a limited vocabulary instead of requiring the person to use DTMF signaling.

Starting in the 2000s, voice response became more common and cheaper to deploy. This was due to increased CPU power and the migration of speech applications from proprietary code to the VXML standard.

== Technology ==
DTMF decoding and speech recognition are used to interpret the caller&#x27;s response to voice prompts. DTMF tones are entered via the telephone keypad.

Other technologies include using text-to-speech (TTS) to speak complex and dynamic information, such as e-mails, news reports or weather information. IVR technology is also being introduced into automobile systems for hands-free operation. TTS is computer generated synthesized speech that is no longer the robotic voice traditionally associated with computers. Real voices create the speech in fragments that are spliced together (concatenated) and smoothed before being played to the caller.

An IVR can be deployed in several ways:

* Equipment installed on the customer premises
* Equipment installed in the PSTN (public switched telephone network)
* Application service provider (ASP) / hosted IVR

An automatic call distributor (ACD) is often the second point of contact when calling many larger businesses. An ACD uses digital storage devices to play greetings or announcements, but typically routes a caller without prompting for input. An IVR can play announcements and request an input from the caller. This information can be used to profile the caller and used by an ACD to route the call to an agent with a particular skill set.

Interactive voice response can be used to front-end a call center operation by identifying the needs of the caller. Information can be obtained from the caller such as an account number. Answers to simple questions such as account balances or pre-recorded information can be provided without operator intervention. Account numbers from the IVR are often compared to caller ID data for security reasons and additional IVR responses are required if the caller ID does not match the account record.

IVR call flows are created in a variety of ways. A traditional IVR depended upon proprietary programming or scripting languages, whereas modern IVR applications are generated in a similar way to Web pages, using standards such as VoiceXML, CCXML, SRGS and SSML. The ability to use XML-driven applications allows a web server to act as the application server, freeing the IVR developer to focus on the call flow.

IVR speech recognition interactions (call flows) are designed using 3 approaches to prompt for and recognize user input: directed, open-ended, and mixed dialogue.

A directed dialogue prompt communicates a set of valid responses to the user (e.g. &quot;How can I help you? ... Say something like, &quot;account balance, order status,&quot; or &quot;more options&quot;&quot;). An open-ended prompt does not communicate a set of valid responses (e.g. &quot;How can I help you?&quot;). In both cases, the goal is to glean a valid spoken response from the user. The key difference is that with directed dialogue, the user is more likely to speak an option exactly as was communicated by the prompt (e.g. &quot;account balance&quot;). With an open-ended prompt, however, the user is likely to include extraneous words or phrases (e.g. &quot;I was just looking at my bill and saw that my balance was wrong.&quot;). The open-ended prompt requires a greater degree of natural language processing to extract the relevant information from the phrase (i.e. &quot;balance&quot;). Open-ended recognition also requires a larger grammar set, which accounts for a wider array of permutations of a given response (e.g. &quot;balance was wrong&quot;, &quot;wrong balance&quot;, &quot;balance is high&quot;, &quot;high balance&quot;). Despite the greater amount of data and processing required for open-ended prompts, they are more interactively efficient, as the prompts themselves are typically much shorter.

A mixed dialogue approach involves shifting from open-ended to directed dialogue or vice versa within the same interaction, as one type of prompt may be more effective in a given situation. Mixed dialog prompts must also be able to recognize responses that are not relevant to the immediate prompt, for instance in the case of a user deciding to shift to a function different from the current one.

Higher level IVR development tools are available to further simplify the application development process. A call flow diagram can be drawn with a GUI tool and the presentation layer (typically VoiceXML) can be automatically generated. In addition, these tools normally provide extension mechanisms for software integration, such as an HTTP interface to a website and a Java interface for connecting to a database.

In telecommunications, an audio response unit (ARU) (often included in IVR systems) is a device that provides synthesized voice responses to DTMF keypresses by processing calls based on (a) the call-originator input, (b) information received from a database, and (c) information in the incoming call, such as the time of day. ARUs increase the number of information calls handled and provide consistent quality in information retrieval.

== Usage ==
IVR systems are used to service high call volumes at lower cost. The use of IVR allows callers&#x27; queries to be resolved without a live agent. If callers do not find the information they need, the calls may be transferred to a live agent. The approach allows live agents to have more time to deal with complex interactions. When an IVR system answers multiple phone numbers, the use of DNIS ensures that the correct application and language is executed. A single large IVR system can handle calls for thousands of applications, each with its own phone numbers and script.

Call centers use IVR systems to identify and segment callers. The ability to identify customers allows services to be tailored according to the customer profile. The caller can be given the option to wait in the queue, choose an automated service, or request a callback. The system may obtain caller line identification (CLI) data from the network to help identify or authenticate the caller. Additional caller authentication data could include account number, personal information, password and biometrics (such as voice print). IVR also enables customer prioritization. In a system wherein individual customers may have a different status, the service will automatically prioritize the individual&#x27;s call and move customers to the front of a specific queue.

IVRs will also log call detail information into its own database for auditing, performance report, and future IVR system enhancements. CTI allows a contact center or organization to gather information about the caller as a means of directing the inquiry to the appropriate agent. CTI can transfer relevant information about the individual customer and the IVR dialog from the IVR to the agent desktop using a screen-pop, making for a more effective and efficient service. Voice-activated dialing (VAD) IVR systems are used to automate routine inquiries to a switchboard or PABX (Private Automatic Branch exchange) operators, and are used in many hospitals and large businesses to reduce the caller waiting time. An additional function is the ability to allow external callers to page staff and transfer the inbound call to the paged person. IVR can be used to provide a more sophisticated voice mail experience to the caller.

===Banking===
Banking institutions are reliant on IVR systems for customer engagement and to extend business hours to a 24/7 operation. Telephone banking allows customers to check balances and transaction histories as well as to make payments and transfers. As online channels have emerged, banking customer satisfaction has decreased.

=== Medical ===
IVR systems are used by pharmaceutical companies and contract research organizations to conduct clinical trials and manage the large volumes of data generated. The caller will respond to questions in their preferred language and their responses will be logged into a database and possibly recorded at the same time to confirm authenticity. Applications include patient randomization and drug supply management. They are also used in recording patient diaries and questionnaires.

IVR systems allow callers to obtain data relatively anonymously. Hospitals and clinics have used IVR systems to allow callers to receive anonymous access to test results. This is information that could easily be handled by a person but the IVR system is used to preserve privacy and avoid potential embarrassment of sensitive information or test results. Users are given a passcode to access their results.

=== Surveying ===
Some of the largest installed IVR platforms are used for televoting on television game shows, such as &quot;Pop Idol&quot; and &quot;Big Brother&quot;, which can generate enormous call spikes. The network provider will often deploy &quot;call gapping&quot; in the PSTN to prevent network overload. IVR may also be used by survey organizations to ask more sensitive questions where the investigators are concerned that a respondent might feel less comfortable providing these answers to a human interlocutor (such as questions about drug use or sexual behavior). In some cases, an IVR system can be used in the same survey in conjunction with a human interviewer.

==Social Impact ==
By allowing low-literacy populations to interact with technology, IVR systems form an avenue to build technological skills in developing countries. Developing countries have a prevalence of mobile phones even in rural areas, which allows room for IVR technology to support social good projects. However, most IVR technology is designed in resource-rich domains hence research is necessary to contextualize and adapt this technology for developing countries. Research in ICTD has helped tailor IVR towards social impact has created innovative applications in health, agricultural, entertainment and citizen journalism.

=== Healthcare ===
In the context of tuberculosis, patients need to adhere to the medicine daily basis for a period of few months to completely heal. In public sector, there is a scheme called DOTS (Directly Observed Therapy Short Course) which was the most effective source for poor population. However, this method requires the patient to commute to the clinic everyday which adds financial and time constraints to the patient.

99DOTS is a project that uses good ICTD principles to use IVR technology to benefit TB patients. Patients have a customized packet of tablets that they receive from the healthcare official who trains them to take the medicine in the sequence daily. Opening the packet in a sequence reveals a phone number that the patient needs to dial to acknowledge that they have taken the medicine. This research project was based out of Microsoft Research India by Bill Theis and who received MacArthur Fellowship for the project. The project has spun off as Everwell Technologies which now works closely with the Government of India to scale this technology to patients throughout India.

=== Community-based entertainment ===
Although radio is a very popular means of entertainment, IVR provides interactivity, which can help listeners engage in novel ways using their phones. ICTD research has used IVR entertainment as a mechanism to support communities and provide information to populations that are hard to reach by traditional methods.

* Sangeet Swara: voice-based singing platform for low literate users in India. Although this platform was for a broader audience, it saw large participation from visually impaired people.
* Gurgaon Idol: was a singing competition used voice system, where users could vote and sing to a number presented on radio.
* Polly: A voiced based viral entertainment system that allowed users to modify their voice and share it with their contacts. The authors used the virality to play relevant job advertisements for literate population. Polly&#x27;s model for entertainment has been adapted to spread information about maternal health for fathers, agriculture and community generated content.

=== Civic engagement ===
IVR has been used for community generated content which NGOs and social organizations can tailor to spread relevant content to hard to reach population.

* Graam Vanni: meaning &#x27;voice of the village&#x27;, is a social technology company incubated out of IIT Delhi which uses IVR as the main medium. Mobile Vaani is a product of this company which connects to hard to reach in northern India with development messages, employment alerts, entrepreneurial activities, and also conduct market research studies. Mobile Vaani network caters to 500,000 households in northern India. Graam Vaani has impacted 2.5 million house holds since it started. 
* CGnet swara: A community-generated journalism platform that provided rural populations of people in the forests of Central Tribal India to broadcast their grievances. The system was moderated by editors who listened to these messages and later transcribed these messages onto a blog.

== Developments ==
=== Video ===
The introduction of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) means that point-to-point communications are no longer restricted to voice calls but can now be extended to multimedia technologies such as video. IVR manufacturers have extended their systems into IVVR (interactive voice and video response), especially for the mobile phone networks. The use of video gives IVR systems the ability to implement multimodal interaction with the caller.

The introduction of full-duplex video IVR in the future will allow systems the ability to read emotions and facial expressions. It may also be used to identify the caller, using technology such as Iris scan or other biometric means. Recordings of the caller may be stored to monitor certain transactions and can be used to reduce identity fraud.

=== SIP contact center ===
With the introduction of SIP contact centers, call control in a SIP contact center can be implemented by CCXML scripting, which is an adjunct to the VXML language used to generate modern IVR dialogues. As calls are queued in the SIP contact center, the IVR system can provide treatment or automation, wait for a fixed period, or play music. Inbound calls to a SIP contact center must be queued or terminated against a SIP end point; SIP IVR systems can be used to replace agents directly by the use of applications deployed using BBUA (back-to-back user agents).

=== Interactive messaging response (IMR) ===
Due to the introduction of instant messaging (IM) in contact centers, agents can handle up to 6 different IM conversations at the same time, which increases agent productivity. IVR technology is being used to automate IM conversations using existing natural language processing software. This differs from email handling as email automated response is based on key word spotting and IM conversations are conversational. The use of text messaging abbreviations and smilies requires different grammars to those currently used for speech recognition. IM is also starting to replace text messaging on multimedia mobile handsets.

=== Hosted vs. on-premises IVR ===
With the introduction of web services into the contact center, host integration has been simplified, allowing IVR applications to be hosted remotely from the contact center. This has meant hosted IVR applications using speech are now available to smaller contact centers across the globe and has led to an expansion of ASP (application service providers).

IVR applications can also be hosted on the public network, without contact center integration. Services include public announcement messages and message services for small business. It is also possible to deploy two-prong IVR services where the initial IVR application is used to route the call to the appropriate contact center. This can be used to balance loading across multiple contact centers or provide business continuity in the event of a system outage.

==Criticism==
Surveys show IVR is generally unpopular with customers. It is difficult to use and unresponsive to the caller. Many customers object to talking to an automated system. There is a perception that IVR is adopted because it allows companies to save money and allow the hiring of fewer employees to answer the phone. Additionally, as basic information is now available online, the calls coming into a call center are more likely to be complex problems and not ones that can be resolved in an automated fashion, thus requiring the attention of a live agent.

<doc id="162189" wikidata="Q272506" url="?curid=162189" title="The Phantom of the Opera (novel)">
<text>The Phantom of the Opera (, ) is a novel by French author Gaston Leroux. It was first published as a serial in from 23 September 1909 to 8 January 1910, and was released in volume form in late March 1910 by Pierre Lafitte. The novel is partly inspired by historical events at the Paris Opera during the nineteenth century, and by an apocryphal tale concerning the use of a former ballet pupil&#x27;s skeleton in an 1841 production of Carl Maria von Weber&#x27;s . It has been successfully adapted into various stage and film adaptations, most notable of which are the 1925 film depiction featuring Lon Chaney, and Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s 1986 musical.

== History behind the novel ==
Leroux initially was going to be a lawyer, but after spending his inheritance gambling he became a reporter for . At the paper, he wrote about and critiqued dramas, as well as being a courtroom reporter. With his job, he was able to travel frequently, but he returned to Paris where he became a writer. Because of his fascination with both Edgar Allan Poe and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, he wrote a detective mystery entitled &quot;The Mystery of the Yellow Room&quot; in 1907, and four years later he published . The novel was first published in newspapers before finally being published as a book. 

The setting of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; is the actual Paris opera house, the Palais Garnier. Leroux had heard the rumours about the time the opera house was finished, and these rumours became closely linked with the novel: Act One of the opera &quot;Hellé&quot; had just finished when a fire in the roof of the opera house melted through a wire holding a counterweight for the chandelier, causing a crash that injured several and killed one. Using this accident paired with rumours of a ghost in that same opera house, Leroux wrote and published it in 1910, which was later published in English as &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;. The underground &quot;lake&quot; that he wrote about, in reality an enormous cistern, does exist beneath the opera house, and it is still used for training firefighters to swim in the dark.

The serialized version contains an entire chapter () that does not appear in the novel version—though much of its content was added in other chapters—and was not reprinted in English until 2014.

== Plot summary == 
In the 1880s, in Paris, the Palais Garnier Opera House is believed to be haunted by an entity known as the &#x27;Phantom of the Opera&#x27;, or simply the &#x27;Opera Ghost&#x27;, after stagehand Joseph Buquet is found hanged, the noose around his neck missing. 

At a gala performance for the retirement of the opera house&#x27;s managers, a young, little-known Swedish soprano, Christine Daaé, is called upon to sing in place of the opera&#x27;s leading soprano, Carlotta, who is ill. Christine&#x27;s performance is a success. Among the audience is the Vicomte Raoul de Chagny, who recognizes her as his childhood playmate and recalls his love for her. He attempts to visit her backstage, where he hears a man complimenting her from inside her dressing room. He investigates the room once Christine leaves, only to find it empty.

At Perros-Guirec, Christine meets with Raoul, who confronts her about the voice he heard in her room. Christine says she has been tutored by the &quot;Angel of Music&quot;, whom her father used to tell her and Raoul about. When Raoul suggests that she might be the victim of a prank, she storms off. Christine visits her father&#x27;s grave one night, where a mysterious figure appears and plays the violin for her. Raoul attempts to confront the figure but is struck and knocked out in the process.

Back at the Palais Garnier, the new managers receive a letter from the Phantom demanding that they allow Christine to perform the lead role of Marguerite in &quot;Faust&quot; and that box 5 be left empty for his use, lest they perform in a house with a curse on it. The managers assume his demands are a prank and ignore them. Soon after, Carlotta ends up croaking like a toad, and a chandelier drops into the audience, killing a spectator. The Phantom, having abducted Christine from her dressing room, reveals himself as a deformed man called Erik.

Erik intends to hold her prisoner in his lair with him for a few days. Still, she causes him to change his plans when she unmasks him and, to the horror of both, beholds his skull-like face. Fearing that she will leave him, he decides to hold her permanently. However, when Christine requests release after two weeks, he agrees on the condition that she wear his ring and be faithful to him.

On the roof of the Opera House, Christine tells Raoul about her abduction and makes Raoul promise to take her away to where Erik can never find her, even if she resists. Raoul says he will act on his promise the next day. Unbeknownst to Christine and Raoul, Erik is watching them and overheard their whole conversation.

The following night, the enraged and jealous Erik abducts Christine during a production of &quot;Faust&quot; and tries to force her to marry him. Raoul is led by a mysterious Opera House regular, &#x27;the Persian&#x27;, into Erik&#x27;s secret lair in the bowels of the building. Still, they end up trapped in a mirrored room by Erik, who threatens that unless Christine agrees to marry him, he will kill them and everyone in the Opera House by using explosives.

Under duress, Christine agrees to marry Erik. Erik initially tries to drown Raoul and the Persian, using the water which would have been used to douse the explosives. Still, Christine begs, promising him not to kill herself after becoming his bride. Erik releases Raoul and &#x27;the Persian&#x27; from his torture chamber.

When Erik is alone with Christine, he lifts his mask to kiss her on her forehead and is eventually given a kiss back. Erik reveals he has never kissed anyone, including his own mother, who would run away if he ever tried to kiss her. Moved, he and Christine cry together. She also holds his hand and says, &quot;Poor, unhappy Erik&quot;, which reduces him to &quot;a dog ready to die for her&quot;.

He allows &#x27;the Persian&#x27; and Raoul to escape, though not before making Christine promise that she will visit him on his death day and return the ring he gave her. He also makes &#x27;the Persian&#x27; promise that afterward, he will go to the newspaper and report his death, as he will die soon &quot;of love.&quot;

Later, Christine returns to Erik&#x27;s lair, and per his request returns the ring and buries him &#x27;somewhere he will never be found&#x27;. Afterward, a local newspaper runs the note: &quot;Erik is dead&quot;.

Christine and Raoul then elope together, never to return.

=== Epilogue ===
The epilogue reveals that Erik was born deformed, and the son of a construction business owner. He ran away from his native Normandy to work in fairs and caravans, schooling himself in the circus arts across Europe and Asia, and eventually building trick palaces in Persia and Turkey.

Returning to France, he started his own construction business. After being subcontracted to work on the Palais Garnier&#x27;s foundations, Erik discreetly built his secret lair, complete with hidden passages and other tricks that allowed him to spy on the managers.

==Themes==
===Music=== 
Leroux uses the operatic setting in &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; to use music as a device for foreshadowing. Ribière makes note that Leroux was once a theatre critic and his brother was a musician, so he was knowledgeable about music and how to use it as a framing device. She uses the example of how Leroux introduces &quot;Danse macabre&quot; which means &quot;dance of death&quot; in the gala scene which foreshadows the graveyard scene that comes later where the Phantom plays the fiddle for Christine and attacks Raoul when he tries to intervene.

Drumright points out that music is evident throughout the novel in that it is the basis for Christine and Erik&#x27;s relationship. Christine sees Erik as her Angel of Music that her father promised would come to her one day. The Phantom sees Christine as his musical protégé, and he uses his passion for music to teach her everything he knows.

===Mystery===
The novel is styled as a mystery novel, as its frame is narrated by a detective acquiring his information through various investigations. The mystery under investigation is the identity and motive of &#x27;the Phantom&#x27; who lurks through the opera house, seemingly appearing out of nowhere as if by magic in inaccessible places. But, it seems that the mystery novel frame story is a façade for the genre being more a Gothic romance.

===Gothic horror===
In his article, Fitzpatrick compares the Phantom to other monsters featured in Gothic novels such as Frankenstein&#x27;s monster, Dr. Jekyll, Dorian Gray, and Count Dracula. The Phantom has a torture chamber where he kidnaps and kills people, and the walls of the chapel in the graveyard are lined with human bones. Drumright notes that &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; checks off every trope necessary to have a Gothic novel according to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Literature&#x27;s&quot; description which says, &quot;Such novels were expected to be dark and tempestuous and full of ghosts, madness, outrage,
superstition, and revenge.&quot; Although the Phantom is really just a deformed man, he has ghost-like qualities in that no one can ever find him or his lair and he is seen as a monster. People are frightened by him because of his deformities and the acts of violence he commits.

===Romance===
The novel features a love triangle between the Phantom, Christine, and Raoul. Raoul is seen as Christine&#x27;s childhood love whom she is familiar with and has affection for. He is rich and therefore offers her security as well as a wholesome, Christian marriage. The Phantom, on the other hand, is not familiar. He is dark, ugly and dangerous, and therefore represents the forbidden love. However, Christine is drawn to him because she sees him as her Angel of Music, and she pities his existence of loneliness and darkness.

== Critical reception ==

By the time Leroux published &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, he had already gained credibility as a crime mystery author in both French- and English-speaking countries. He had written six novels prior, two of which had garnered substantial popularity within their first year of publication: &quot;The Mystery of the Yellow Room&quot; and &quot;The Perfume of the Lady in Black&quot;. Although previous commentators have asserted that &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; did not attain as much success as these previous novels, being particularly unpopular in France where it was first published, recent research into the novel&#x27;s early reception and sales has indicated the contrary. One book review from the &quot;New York Times&quot; expressed disappointment in the way the phantom was portrayed, saying that the feeling of suspense and horror is lost once it is found out that the phantom is just a man. The majority of the notability that the novel acquired early on was due to its publication in a series of installments in French, American, and English newspapers. This serialized version of the story became important when it was read and sought out by Universal Pictures to be adapted into a movie in 1925. Leroux did not live to see all the success from his novel and its subsequent critical re-evaluation; he died in April 1927.

== Adaptations ==

There have been many literary and other dramatic works based on Leroux&#x27;s novel, ranging from stage musicals to films to children&#x27;s books. Some well-known stage and screen adaptations of the novel are the 1925 film and the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical.
Leroux&#x27;s novel was made into two silent films. The first film version, a German adaptation called , is now a lost film. It was made in 1916 and was directed by Ernest Matray.

The next adaptation, a 1925 Universal Studios silent film, stars Lon Chaney as the Phantom. Due to tensions on the set, there was a switch in directors and Edward Sedgwick finished the film while changing the direction of the movie. His take on the novel, making it a dark romantic movie with comedy, was not popular with audiences. Finally, the film was reworked one last time by Maurice Pivar and Lois Weber. They removed most of Sedgwick&#x27;s contributions and returned to the original focus. This time, the movie was a success with audiences.
The most famous adaptation of the novel was Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s 1986 musical of the same name. With his second-hand copy of the novel and his artistic goals set on creating a major romantic piece, Lloyd Webber and his team wrote a musical that honored the original text while crafting a story that resonated deeply with audiences at the time. During the show&#x27;s development, however, there were disagreements over whether it was &quot;inspired by&quot; or &quot;based on&quot; Gaston Leroux&#x27;s novel. Bill O&#x27;Connell, an assistant to film producers in New York at the time, contended for the show to appear as &quot;based on&quot; rather than &quot;inspired by&quot;, as he viewed the latter as a minimization of Gaston Leroux&#x27;s original involvement with the story.

Lawyers for producer Cameron Mackintosh and Webber&#x27;s Really Useful Theatre Company responded, saying that it was never their intention &quot;to fail to give appropriate prominence to the contribution of M. Leroux&quot;. They didn&#x27;t, however, use the &quot;based on&quot; wording and instead used &quot;inspired by&quot; in the show&#x27;s Playbill, much to O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s dismay. This musical adaptation, which won some of the most prestigious theatre awards in the UK and the US, first premiered in London in 1986 and on Broadway in 1988. &quot;Phantom&quot; has since become the longest-running musical on Broadway (it ran for 35 years before closing in 2023) and is still running in London (the second longest-running West End musical behind &quot;Les Misérables&quot;). The show has also received multiple international productions and translations, yet has never been performed professionally in France.

<text>Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, also known as Clinton, or Midtown West on real estate listings is a neighborhood on the West Side of Midtown Manhattan in New York City, United States. It is considered to be bordered by 34th Street (or 41st Street) to the south, 59th Street to the north, Eighth Avenue to the east, and the Hudson River to the west.

Hell&#x27;s Kitchen has long been a bastion of poor and working-class Irish Americans, and its gritty reputation has long held real-estate prices below those of most other areas of Manhattan. But by 1969, the City Planning Commission&#x27;s &quot;Plan for New York City&quot; reported that development pressures related to its Midtown location were driving people of modest means from the area. Gentrification has accelerated since the early 1980s, and rents have risen rapidly.

In addition to its long-established Irish-American and Hispanic-American populations, Hell&#x27;s Kitchen has a large LGBTQ population and is home to many LGBTQ bars and businesses. The neighborhood has long been a home to fledgling and working actors; it is the home of the Actors Studio training school and sits near Broadway theatres.

Hell&#x27;s Kitchen is part of Manhattan Community District 4. It is patrolled by the 10th and Midtown North Precincts of the New York City Police Department. The area provides transport, medical, and warehouse-infrastructure support to the business district of Manhattan. It is known for its extensive selection of multiethnic, small, and relatively inexpensive restaurants, delicatessens, bodegas, bars, and associated nightlife.

==Boundaries==

The name &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; generally refers to the area between 34th to the south and 59th Street to the north. Starting west of Eighth Avenue and the north side of 43rd Street, city zoning regulations generally limit buildings to six stories. As a result, most of the buildings are older, and are often apartments. For the most part, the neighborhood encompasses the ZIP Codes 10019 and 10036. The post office for 10019 is called Radio City Station, the original name for Rockefeller Center on Sixth Avenue.

The neighborhood overlaps Times Square and the Theater District to the east at Eighth Avenue. On its southeast border, it overlaps the Garment District also on Eighth Avenue. Two landmarks are located here – the New Yorker Hotel at 481 Eighth Avenue, and the Manhattan Center building at the northwest corner of 34th Street and Eighth Avenue. Included in the transition area on Eighth Avenue are the Port Authority Bus Terminal at 42nd Street, the Pride of Midtown fire station (from which an entire shift, 15 firefighters, died at the World Trade Center), several theatres including Studio 54, the original soup stand of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;s &quot;The Soup Nazi&quot;, and the Hearst Tower.

The northern edge of Hell&#x27;s Kitchen borders the southern edge of the Upper West Side, though the section west of Ninth Avenue and south of 57th Street is also part of the Columbus Circle neighborhood. 57th Street was traditionally the boundary between the Upper West Side and Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, but another interpretation puts the northern border at 59th Street, where the names of the north–south avenues change. Included between 57th and 59th Streets the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle; Hudson Hotel; Mount Sinai West, where John Lennon died in 1980 after being shot; and John Jay College.

Beyond the southern boundary is Chelsea. The Hudson Yards neighborhood overlaps with Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, and the areas are often lumped together as &quot;West Midtown&quot;, given their proximity to the Midtown Manhattan business district. The traditional dividing line with Chelsea is 34th Street. The area between the rail corridor at Pennsylvania Station and the West Side Yard and 42nd Street, and east of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, is also known as Hell&#x27;s Kitchen South.

The western border of the neighborhood is the Hudson River at the Hudson River Park and West Side Highway.

== Name ==
Several explanations exist for the origin of the neighborhood&#x27;s current name. An early use of the phrase appears in a comment Davy Crockett made about another notorious Irish slum in Manhattan, Five Points. According to the Irish Cultural Society of the Garden City Area:
According to an article by Kirkley Greenwell, published online by the Hell&#x27;s Kitchen Neighborhood Association:
Local historian Mary Clark explained the name thus:
The 1929 book &quot;Manna-Hatin: The Story of New York&quot; states that the Panic of 1857 led to the formation of gangs &quot;in the notorious &#x27;Gas House District&#x27; at Twenty-First Street and the East River, or in &#x27;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&#x27;, in the West Thirties.&quot;

Hell&#x27;s Kitchen is frequently used to name the neighborhood, although real estate developers designate the area as &#x27;Clinton&#x27; and &#x27;Midtown West&#x27;. The &#x27;Clinton name&#x27;, used by the municipality of New York City, originated in 1959 in an attempt to change the image of the neighborhood by linking the area to DeWitt Clinton Park at 52nd and Eleventh Avenue, named after the 19th century New York governor, though &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that those who live in the area &quot;prefer Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; as the name for the neighborhood.

==History==

===Early history and development===

On the island of Manhattan when Europeans first saw it, the Great Kill formed from three small streams that united near present-day Tenth Avenue and 40th Street, and then wound through the low-lying Reed Valley, renowned for fish and waterfowl, emptying into the Hudson River at a deep bay on the river at the present 42nd Street. The name was retained in a tiny hamlet called Great Kill, which became a center for carriage-making. The upland to the south and east became known as Longacre, the predecessor of Longacre Square, now Times Square.

One of the large farms of the colonial era in this neighborhood was that of Andreas Hopper and his descendants, extending from today&#x27;s 48th Street nearly to 59th Street and from the river east to what is now Sixth Avenue. One of the Hopper farmhouses, built in 1752 for John Hopper the younger, stood near 53rd Street and Eleventh Avenue. Christened &quot;Rosevale&quot; for its extensive gardens, it was the home of the War of 1812 veteran, Gen. Garrit Hopper Striker, and lasted until 1896, when it was demolished.

The site was purchased for the city and naturalistically landscaped by Samuel Parsons Jr. as DeWitt Clinton Park. In 1911, New York Hospital bought a full city block largely of the Hopper property, between 54th and 55th Streets, Eleventh and Twelfth Avenues. Beyond the railroad track, projecting into the river at 54th Street, was Mott&#x27;s Point, with an 18th-century Mott family house surrounded by gardens, that was inhabited by members of the family until 1884 and survived until 1895.

A lone surviving structure from the time this area was open farmland and suburban villas is a pre-1800s carriage house that once belonged to a villa owned by former Vice President and New York State governor George Clinton, now in a narrow court behind 422 West 46th Street. From 1811 until it was officially de-mapped in 1857, the diminutive Bloomingdale Square was part of the city&#x27;s intended future. It extended from 53rd to 57th Streets between Eighth and Ninth Avenues. It was eliminated after the establishment of Central Park, and the name shifted to the junction of Broadway, West End Avenue, and 106th Street, now Straus Park.

In 1825, the City purchased for $10 clear title to a right-of-way through John Leake Norton&#x27;s farm, &quot;The Hermitage&quot;, to lay out 42nd Street clear to the river. Before long, cattle ferried from Weehawken were being driven along the unpaved route to slaughterhouses on the East Side. Seventy acres of the Leakes&#x27;, later the Nortons&#x27; property, extending north from 42nd to 46th Street and from Broadway to the river, were purchased before 1807 by John Jacob Astor and William Cutting, who held it before dividing it into building lots as the district became more suburban.

The West Side later had its own slaughterhouses, which went out of business in the middle 20th century.

===Unity with the city and deterioration===
There were multiple changes that helped Hell&#x27;s Kitchen integrate with New York City proper. The first was construction of the Hudson River Railroad, whose initial leg – the to Peekskill – was completed on September 29, 1849, By the end of 1849, it stretched to Poughkeepsie and in 1851 it extended to Albany. The track ran at a steep grade up Eleventh Avenue, as far as 60th Street.

The formerly rural riverfront was industrialized by businesses, such as tanneries, that used the river for shipping products and dumping waste.
The neighborhood that would later be known as Hell&#x27;s Kitchen started forming in the southern part of the 22nd Ward in the mid-19th century. Irish immigrants – mostly refugees from the Great Famine – found work on the docks and railroad along the Hudson River and established shantytowns there.

After the American Civil War, there was an influx of people who moved to New York City. The tenements that were built became overcrowded quickly. Many who lived in this congested, poverty-stricken area turned to gang life. Following Prohibition, implemented in 1919, the district&#x27;s many warehouses were ideal locations for bootleg distilleries for the rumrunners who controlled illicit liquor. At the start of the 20th century, the neighborhood was controlled by gangs, including the violent Gopher Gang led by One Lung Curran and later by Owney Madden.

Early gangs, like the Hell&#x27;s Kitchen Gang, transformed into organized crime entities, around the same time that Owney Madden became one of the most powerful mobsters in New York. It became known as the &quot;most dangerous area on the American Continent&quot;.

By the 1930s, when the McGraw-Hill Building was constructed in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, the surrounding area was still largely tenements. After the repeal of Prohibition, many of the organized crime elements moved into other rackets, such as illegal gambling and union shakedowns. The postwar era was characterized by a flourishing waterfront, and longshoreman work was plentiful.

By the end of the 1970s, the implementation of containerized shipping led to the decline of the West Side piers and many longshoremen found themselves out of work. In addition, construction of the Lincoln Tunnel in the 1930s, Lincoln Tunnel access roads, and the Port Authority Bus Terminal and ramps starting in 1950 destroyed much of Hell&#x27;s Kitchen south of 41st Street.

In 1959, an aborted rumble between rival Irish and Puerto Rican gangs led to the notorious &quot;Capeman&quot; murders in which two innocent teenagers, mistaken for rival gang members, were killed. By 1965, Hell&#x27;s Kitchen was the home base of the Westies, an Irish mob aligned with the Gambino crime family. In the early 1980s widespread gentrification began to alter the demographics of the longtime working-class Irish American neighborhood. The 1980s saw an end to the Westies&#x27; reign of terror, when the gang lost all of its power after the RICO convictions of most of its principals in 1986.

===First wave of gentrification===

====Special Clinton zoning district====

Although the neighborhood is immediately west of New York&#x27;s main business district, large-scale redevelopment has been kept in check for more than 40 years by strict zoning rules in a Special Clinton District designed to protect the neighborhood&#x27;s residents and its low-rise character.

In part to qualify for federal aid, New York developed a comprehensive &quot;Plan for New York City&quot; in 1969–70. While for almost all neighborhoods, the master plan contained few proposals, it was very explicit about the bright future of Hell&#x27;s Kitchen. The plan called for 2,000 to 3,000 new hotel rooms, 25,000 apartments, of office space, a new super liner terminal, a subway along 48th Street, and a convention center to replace what the plan described as &quot;blocks of antiquated and deteriorating structures of every sort.&quot; However, outrage at the massive residential displacement that this development project would have caused, and the failure of the City to complete any replacement housing, led to opposition to the first project – a new convention center to replace the New York Coliseum.

To prevent the convention center from sparking a development boom that would beget the rest of the master plan with its consequent displacement, the Clinton Planning Council and Daniel Gutman, their environmental planner, proposed that the convention center and all major development be located south of 42nd Street, where public policy had already left tracts of vacant land.

Nevertheless, in 1973, the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center was approved for a 44th Street site that would replace piers 84 and 86. But in exchange, and after the defeat of a bond issue that would have funded a 48th Street &quot;people mover&quot;, the City first abandoned the rest of the 1969–70 master plan and then gave the neighborhood a special zoning district to restrict further redevelopment. Since then, limited new development has filled in the many empty lots and rejuvenated existing buildings. Later, in 1978, when the city could not afford the higher cost of constructing the 44th Street convention center over water, the Mayor and Governor chose the rail yard site originally proposed by the local community.

The SCD was originally split into four areas:
*Preservation Area: 43rd to 56th Streets between Eighth and Tenth Avenues. R-7 density, 6-story height limit on new buildings, suggested average apartment size of two bedrooms. This was a response to the fact that between 1960 and 1970 developers had torn down 2,300 family-sized units and replaced them with 1,500 smaller units.
*Perimeter Area: Eighth Avenue, 42nd and 57th Streets. Bulkier development permitted to counterbalance the downzoning in the preservation area.
*Mixed Use Area: Tenth and Eleventh Avenues between 43rd and 50th Streets. Mixed residential and manufacturing. New residential development only permitted in conjunction with manufacturing areas. Later combined into &quot;Other Areas&quot;.
*Other Areas: West of Eleventh Avenue. Industrial and waterfront uses. Later combined with &quot;Mixed Use Area&quot;

Special permits are required for all demolition and construction in the SCD, including demolition of &quot;any sound housing in the District&quot; and any rehabilitation that increases the number of dwellings in a structure. In the original provisions, no building could be demolished unless it was unsound. New developments, conversions, or alterations that create new units or zero bedroom units must contain at least 20% two bedroom apartments with a minimum room size of .

Alterations that reduce the percentage of two-bedroom units are not permitted unless the resulting building meets the 20% two-bedroom requirement. Building height in the Preservation Area cannot exceed or seven stories, whichever is less.

====Windermere====

As the gentrification pace increased, there were numerous reports of problems between landlords and tenants. The most extreme example was the eight-story Windermere Apartments complex at the southwest corner of Ninth Avenue and 57th Street. Built in 1881, it is the second-oldest large apartment house in Manhattan.

In 1980, the owner, Alan B. Weissman, tried to empty the building of its tenants. According to former tenants and court papers, rooms were ransacked, doors were ripped out, prostitutes were moved in, and tenants received death threats in the campaign to empty the building. All the major New York newspapers covered the trials that sent the Windermere&#x27;s managers to jail. Although Weissman was never linked to the harassment, he and his wife made top billing in the 1985 edition of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; annual list, &quot;The Dirty Dozen: New York&#x27;s Worst Landlords.&quot;

Most of the tenants eventually settled and moved out of the building. In May 2006, seven tenants remained and court orders protecting the tenants and the building allowed it to remain in a derelict condition even as the surrounding neighborhood was experiencing a dramatic burst of demolition and redevelopment. In September 2007, the fire department evacuated the remaining seven residents from the building, citing dangerous conditions, and padlocked the front door. In 2008, the New York Supreme Court ruled that the owners of the building, who include the TOA Construction Corporation of Japan, must repair it.
====Failed rezoning attempts====
By the 1980s, the area south of 42nd Street was in decline. Both the state and the city hoped that the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center would renew the area. Hotels, restaurants, apartment buildings, and television studios were proposed. One proposal included apartments and hotels on a pier jutting out onto Hudson River, which included a marina, ferry slip, stores, restaurants, and a performing arts center. At Ninth Avenue and 33rd Street, a 32-story office tower would be built. Hotels, apartment buildings, and a Madison Square Garden would be built over the tracks west of Pennsylvania Station. North of the Javits Center, a &quot;Television City&quot; would be developed by Larry Silverstein in conjunction with NBC.

One impediment to development was the lack of mass transit in the area, which is far from Penn Station, and none of the proposals for a link to Penn Station was pursued successfully, for example, the ill-fated West Side Transitway. No changes to the zoning policy happened until 1990, when the city rezoned a small segment of 11th Avenue near the Javits Center. In 1993, part of 9th Avenue between 35th and 41st Streets was also rezoned. However, neither of these rezonings was particularly significant, as most of the area was still zoned as a manufacturing district with low-rise apartment buildings.

By the early 1990s, there was a recession, which scuttled plans for rezoning and severely reduced the amount of development in the area. After the recession was over, developers invested in areas like Times Square, eastern Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, and Chelsea, but mostly skipped the Far West Side.

===September 11, 2001===

While most fire stations in Manhattan lost firefighters in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the station with the greatest loss of firefighters was Engine Co. 54/Ladder Co. 4/Battalion 9 at 48th Street and Eighth Avenue, which lost 15 firefighters, an entire shift on duty. Given its proximity to Midtown, the station specializes in skyscraper fires and rescues. In 2007, it was the second-busiest firehouse in New York City, with 9,685 runs between the two companies.

Its patch reads &quot;Pride of Midtown&quot; and &quot;Never Missed a Performance&quot;. Memorials dot the station&#x27;s exterior walls and a granite memorial is in a park to its north. Ladder 21, the &quot;Pride of Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;, located on 38th Street between Ninth and Tenth Avenues, and stationed with Engine Co. 34, lost seven firefighters on September 11. In addition, on September 11, Engine Co. 26 was temporarily stationed with Engine Co. 34/Ladder Co. 21 and lost many firefighters themselves.
===Redevelopment and second wave of gentrification===

Hell&#x27;s Kitchen has become an increasingly upscale neighborhood of affluent young professionals as well as residents from the &quot;old days&quot;, with rents in the neighborhood having increased dramatically above the average in Manhattan. It has also acquired a large and diverse community as residents have moved north from Chelsea. Zoning has long restricted the extension of Midtown Manhattan&#x27;s skyscraper development into Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, at least north of 42nd Street.

In 1989, the David Childs- and Frank Williams-designed Worldwide Plaza established a beachhead when it was built at the former Madison Square Garden site, a full city block between 49th and 50th Streets and between Eighth and Ninth Avenues that was exempt from special district zoning rules. This project led a real-estate building boom on Eighth Avenue, including the Hearst Tower at 56th Street and Eighth Avenue.

An indication of how fast real estate prices rose in the neighborhood was a 2004 transaction involving the Howard Johnson&#x27;s Motel at 52nd Street and Eighth Avenue. In June, Vikram Chatwal&#x27;s Hampshire Hotel Group bought the motel and adjoining Studio Instrument Rental building for $9 million. In August, they sold the property to Elad Properties for about $43 million. Elad, which formerly owned the Plaza Hotel, built The Link, a luxury 44-story building, at that location.

Silverstein Properties and Greenwood Gaming &amp; Entertainment are bidding for a downstate New York casino license and hope to develop a resort and casino in the neighborhood if they secure a license. They have proposed The Avenir, which would be a resort with 1,000 hotel rooms, an eight story casino and a 1,000 seat performance venue. 100 affordable housing units would also be built.

====Hudson Yards====
In 2003, the New York City Department of City Planning issued a master plan that envisioned the creation of of commercial and residential development, two corridors of open space. Dubbed the Hudson Yards Master Plan, the area covered is bordered on the east by Seventh and Eighth Avenues, on the south by West 28th and 30th Streets, on the north by West 43rd Street, and on the west by Hudson River Park and the Hudson River. The City&#x27;s plan was similar to a neighborhood plan produced by architect Meta Brunzema and environmental planner Daniel Gutman for the Hell&#x27;s Kitchen Neighborhood Association (HKNA). The main concept of the HKNA plan was to allow major new development while protecting the existing residential core area between Ninth and Tenth avenues.

As plans developed, they included a mixed-use real estate development by Related Companies and Oxford Properties over the MTA&#x27;s West Side Yard; a renovation of the Javits Convention Center; and the 7 Subway Extension to the 34th Street–Hudson Yards station at 34th Street and 11th Avenue, which opened on September 13, 2015. The first phase of the Related project, completed in March 2019, comprises The Shops &amp; Restaurants at Hudson Yards, a public space centered around the &quot;Vessel&quot; structure, the Shed arts center, and several skyscrapers. By the 2010s, the neighborhood had become home to young Wall Street financiers.

==Demographics==

Based on data from the 2020 United States census, the population of Hell&#x27;s Kitchen (Clinton) was 49,758, an increase of 3,874 (8.4%) from the 45,884 counted in 2010. Covering an area of 0.841 sq mi (2.18 km2), the neighborhood had a population density of 59,165/sq. mi (22,825/sq. km). The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 52.8% White, 5.5% African American, 21.1% Hispanic or Latino, 17.5% Asian, and 3.2% from other races.

The entirety of Community District 4, which comprises Hell&#x27;s Kitchen and Chelsea, had 122,119 inhabitants as of NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 83.1 years. This was higher than the 2016 median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. In 2018, most inhabitants were adults: a plurality (45%) were between the ages of 25–44. 26% were aged between 45–64, and 13% were 65 or older. The ratio of youth and college-aged residents was lower, at 9% and 8% respectively.

In 2017, the median household income in Community Districts 4 and 5 was $101,981. In 2018, an estimated 11% of Hell&#x27;s Kitchen and Chelsea residents lived in poverty, compared to 14% in all of Manhattan and 20% in all of New York City. One in twenty residents (5%) was unemployed, compared to 7% in Manhattan and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 41% in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen and Chelsea, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 45% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Hell&#x27;s Kitchen and Chelsea are considered to be high-income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying.
==Culture==

===Entertainment industry===

Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&#x27;s gritty reputation had made its housing prices lower than elsewhere in Manhattan. Given the lower costs in the past and its proximity to Broadway theatres, the neighborhood is a haven for aspiring actors. Many famous actors and entertainers have resided there, including Burt Reynolds, Rip Torn, Bob Hope, Charlton Heston, James Dean, Madonna, Jerry Seinfeld, Larry David, Alicia Keys, and Sylvester Stallone. This is due in large part to the Actors Studio on West 44th at which Lee Strasberg taught and developed method acting.

With the opening of the original Improv by Budd Friedman in 1963, the club became a hangout for singers to perform and quickly attracted comedians as well, turning it into the reigning comedy club of its time. Once located at 358 West 44th Street and Ninth Avenue, it has since closed.

Manhattan Plaza at 43rd Street between Ninth and Tenth Avenues was built in the 1970s to house artists. It consists of two 46-story towers with 70% of the apartments set aside for rent discounts for those who work in the arts. The Actors&#x27; Temple and St. Malachy Roman Catholic Church with its Actors&#x27; Chapel also testify to the long-time presence of show business people.

The neighborhood is also home to a number of broadcast and music-recording studios, including the CBS Broadcast Center at 524 West 57th Street, where the CBS television network records many of its news and sports programs such as &quot;60 Minutes&quot; and &quot;The NFL Today&quot;; the former Sony Music Studios at 460 West 54th Street, which closed in 2007; Manhattan Center Studios at 311 West 34th Street; and Right Track Recording&#x27;s Studio A509 orchestral recording facility at West 38th Street and Tenth Avenue.

The syndicated &quot;Montel Williams Show&quot; was taped at the Unitel Studios, 433 West 53rd Street, between Ninth and Tenth Avenues. The Power Station recording studios are located near the intersection of 57th Street and Ninth Avenue in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen. In 2016, singer and songwriter Sting recorded his album entitled &quot;57th &amp; 9th&quot; there. The progressive metal band Dream Theater recorded their fourth studio album Falling into Infinity at the studio. Their song &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; is named after this area.

The Comedy Central satirical news program &quot;The Daily Show&quot; was taped in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen since its debut until late 2021 when it moved to Times Square. In 2005, it moved from its quarters at 54th Street and Tenth Avenue to a new studio in the neighborhood, at 733 Eleventh Avenue, between 51st and 52nd Streets. The 54th and 10th location was used for &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; throughout its entire run from 2005 until 2014. Until its cancellation, the studio was used for &quot;The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore&quot;, following Stephen Colbert&#x27;s departure from Comedy Central. The studio was later used for &quot;Tha God&#x27;s Honest Truth&quot;, produced by Colbert. Next door at 511 West 54th Street is Ars Nova theater, home to emerging artists Joe Iconis and breakout star Jesse Eisenberg, among others.

The headquarters of Troma studios was located in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen before their move to Long Island City in Queens. The Baryshnikov Arts Center opened at 37 Arts on 37th Street in 2005, the Orchestra of St. Luke&#x27;s opened the DiMenna Center for Classical Music in the same building in 2011. The Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater opened at 55th Street and Ninth Avenue in 2006. The Metropolitan Community Church of New York, geared toward an LGBTQ membership, is located in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen.

===Food===

Ninth Avenue is noted for its many ethnic restaurants.

One such park is DeWitt Clinton Park on Eleventh Avenue between 52nd and 54th Streets. It is across the West Side Highway from Clinton Cove Park. Another is Hell&#x27;s Kitchen Park, built in the 1970s on a former parking lot on 10th Avenue between 47th and 48th Streets.

A newer park in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen is the Hudson Park and Boulevard, which is part of the Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project.

When the city put it up for auction in 1981, residents formed the Committee to Save Clinton Community Garden, through appeals to Mayor Ed Koch and unsuccessful efforts to purchase the site.

In 1984, one month before the auction, the garden was transferred to the city&#x27;s Parks Department, making it the first community garden to become parkland. It is open from dawn to dusk. Over 2,000 residents have keys to the park, which is used by an average of 500–600 people, including over 100 children, during the warm months. Recreational events include an annual Summer Solstice event, art shows, chamber music picnics, gardening seminars, and dance recitals. Residents have held weddings in the park, and photographers have used it for photo shoots.

Born in Berlin, Bekker completed his classical education at the University of Halle under Friedrich August Wolf, who considered him as his most promising pupil. In 1810 he was appointed professor of philosophy in the University of Berlin. For several years, between 1810 and 1821, he travelled in France, Italy, England and parts of Germany, examining classical manuscripts and gathering materials for his great editorial labours. 

Some of the fruits of his researches were published in the &quot;Anecdota Graeca&quot; (3 vols, 1814–1821), but the major results are to be found in the enormous array of classical authors edited by him. His industry extended to nearly the whole of Greek literature with the exception of the tragedians and lyric poets. His best known editions are those of Plato (1816–1823), &quot;Oratores Attici&quot; (1823–1824), Aristotle (1831–1836), Aristophanes (1829), and twenty-five volumes of the &quot;Corpus Scriptorum Historiae Byzantinae&quot;. The only Latin authors edited by him were Livy (1829–1830) and Tacitus (1831).

Bekker confined himself entirely to manuscript investigations and textual criticism; he contributed little to the extension of other types of scholarship. Bekker numbers have become the standard way of referring to the works of Aristotle and the Corpus Aristotelicum. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1861. He died in Berlin aged 86.

<text>Friedrich August Wolf (; ; 15 February 1759 – 8 August 1824) was a German classicist who is considered the founder of classical and modern philology.

==Biography==

Wolf was born in Hainrode, near Nordhausen. His father was the village schoolmaster and organist. In grammar school, he studied Latin and Greek as well as French, Italian, Spanish, and music.

In 1777, after two years of independent study, at the age of eighteen, Wolf went to the University of Göttingen. Legend has it that he chose to enroll in the department of &quot;philology&quot;, despite the fact that the university had none. His enrollment was nonetheless accepted as submitted. At the time Christian Gottlob Heyne was a member of the faculty. Heyne excluded Wolf from his lectures, and criticized Wolf&#x27;s views on Homer. Wolf was undeterred and pursued his studies through the university&#x27;s library.

From 1779 to 1783, he taught at Ilfeld and Osterode. He published an edition of &quot;Plato&#x27;s Symposium&quot;, and in 1783, he was awarded a chair at the University of Halle in Prussia.

It was in Halle (1783–1807), with the support of ministers serving under Frederick the Great, that Wolf first laid down the principles of the field he would call &quot;Philology&quot;. He defined philology as the study of human nature as exhibited in antiquity. Its methods include the examination of the history, writing, art and other examples of ancient cultures. It combines the study of history and language, through interpretation, in which history and linguistics coalesce into an organic whole. This was the ideal of Wolf&#x27;s philological &quot;seminarium&quot; at Halle.

During Wolf&#x27;s time at Halle he published his commentary on the &quot;Leptines&quot; of Demosthenes (1789), which influenced his student Philipp August Böckh. He also published the &quot;Prolegomena ad Homerum&quot; (1795), which led to accusations of plagiarism by Heyne.

The Halle professorship ended after the French invasion of 1806. He relocated to Berlin, where he received assistance from Wilhelm von Humboldt. Later he once more took a professorship, but he no longer taught with his old success, and he wrote very little. His most finished work, the &quot;Darstellung der Alterthumswissenschaft&quot;, though published
at Berlin (1807), belongs essentially to the Halle time.

Taking medical advice, Wolf travelled to the south but died on the road to Marseille, and was buried there. In 1840 a medal was struck in his honor.

<text>Duralumin (also called duraluminum, duraluminium, duralum, dural(l)ium, or dural) is a trade name for one of the earliest types of age-hardenable aluminium–copper alloys. The term is a combination of &quot;Düren&quot; and &quot;aluminium&quot;. Its use as a trade name is obsolete. Today the term mainly refers to aluminium-copper alloys, designated as the 2000 series by the international alloy designation system (IADS), as with 2014 and 2024 alloys used in airframe fabrication.

Duralumin was developed in 1909 in Germany.
Duralumin is known for its strength and hardness, making it suitable for various applications, especially in the aviation and aerospace industry. However, it is susceptible to corrosion, which can be mitigated by using alclad-duralum materials.

== History ==
Duralumin was developed by the German metallurgist Alfred Wilm at private military-industrial laboratory (Center for Scientific-Technical Research) in Neubabelsberg. In 1903, Wilm discovered that after quenching, an aluminium alloy containing 4% copper would harden when left at room temperature for several days. Further improvements led to the introduction of duralumin in 1909. The name, originally a trade mark of Dürener Metallwerke AG which acquired Wilm&#x27;s patents and commercialized the material, is mainly used in pop-science to describe all Al-Cu alloys system, or &#x27;2000&#x27; series, as designated through the international alloy designation system originally created in 1970 by the Aluminum Association.

== Composition ==

In addition to aluminium, the main materials in duralumin are copper, manganese and magnesium. For instance, Duraluminium 2024 consists of 91-95% aluminium, 3.8-4.9% copper, 1.2-1.8% magnesium, 0.3-0.9% manganese, &lt;0.5% iron, &lt;0.5% silicon, &lt;0.25% zinc, &lt;0.15% titanium, &lt;0.10% chromium and no more than 0.15% of other elements together. Although the addition of copper improves strength, it also makes these alloys susceptible to corrosion. Corrosion resistance can be greatly enhanced by the metallurgical bonding of a high-purity aluminium surface layer, referred to as alclad-duralum. Alclad materials are commonly used in the aircraft industry to this day.

== Microstructure ==
Duralumin&#x27;s remarkable strength and durability stem from its unique microstructure, which is significantly influenced by heat treatment processes.

=== Initial Microstructure ===
Solid Solution: After initial solidification, duralumin exists as a single-phase solid solution, primarily composed of aluminium atoms with dispersed copper, magnesium, and other alloying elements. This initial state is relatively soft and ductile.

=== Heat Treatment and Microstructural Changes ===
Solution Annealing: Duralumin undergoes solution annealing, a high-temperature heat treatment process that dissolves the alloying elements into the aluminium matrix, creating a homogeneous solid solution.

Quenching: Rapid cooling (quenching) after solution annealing freezes the high-temperature solid solution, preventing the precipitation of strengthening phases.

Aging (Precipitation Hardening): During aging, the supersaturated solid solution becomes unstable. Fine precipitates, such as CuAl2 and Mg2Si, form within the aluminum matrix. These precipitates act as obstacles to dislocation movement, significantly increasing the alloy&#x27;s strength and hardness.

=== Final Microstructure ===
The final microstructure of duralumin consists of a predominantly aluminium matrix dispersed fine precipitates (CuAl2, Mg2Si)
Grain boundaries. The size, distribution, and type of precipitates play a crucial role in determining the mechanical properties of duralumin. Optimal aging conditions lead to the formation of finely dispersed precipitates, resulting in peak strength and hardness.

== Applications ==

Aluminium alloyed with copper (Al-Cu alloys), which can be precipitation hardened, are designated by the International Alloy Designation System as the 2000 series. Typical uses for wrought Al-Cu alloys include:

* 2011: Wire, rod, and bar for screw machine products. Applications where good machinability and good strength are required.
* 2014: Heavy-duty forgings, plate, and extrusions for aircraft fittings, wheels, and major structural components, space booster tankage and structure, truck frame and suspension components. Applications requiring high strength and hardness including service at elevated temperatures.
* 2017 or Avional (France): Around 1% Si. Good machinability. Acceptable resistance to corrosion in air and mechanical properties. Also called AU4G in France. Used for aircraft applications between the wars in France and Italy. Also saw some use in motor-racing applications from the 1960s, as it is a tolerant alloy that could be press-formed with relatively unsophisticated equipment.
* 2024: Aircraft structures, rivets, hardware, truck wheels, screw machine products, and other structural applications.
* 2036: Sheet for auto body panels
* 2048: Sheet and plate in structural components for aerospace application and military equipment

=== Aviation ===
German scientific literature openly published information about duralumin, its composition and heat treatment, before the outbreak of World War I in 1914. Despite this, use of the alloy outside Germany did not occur until after fighting ended in 1918. Reports of German use during World War I, even in technical journals such as &quot;Flight&quot;, could still mis-identify its key alloying component as magnesium rather than copper. Engineers in the UK showed little interest in duralumin until after the war.
The earliest known attempt to use duralumin for a heavier-than-air aircraft structure occurred in 1916, when Hugo Junkers first introduced its use in the airframe of the Junkers J 3, a single-engined monoplane &quot;technology demonstrator&quot; that marked the first use of the Junkers trademark duralumin corrugated skinning. The Junkers company completed only the covered wings and tubular fuselage framework of the J 3 before abandoning its development. The slightly later, solely &quot;IdFlieg&quot;-designated Junkers J.I armoured sesquiplane of 1917, known to the factory as the Junkers J 4, had its all-metal wings and horizontal stabilizer made in the same manner as the J 3&#x27;s wings had been, like the experimental and airworthy all-duralumin Junkers J 7 single-seat fighter design, which led to the Junkers D.I low-wing monoplane fighter, introducing all-duralumin aircraft structural technology to German military aviation in 1918.

Its first use in aerostatic airframes came in rigid airship frames, eventually including all those of the &quot;Great Airship&quot; era of the 1920s and 1930s: the British-built R100, the German passenger Zeppelins LZ 127 &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;, LZ 129 &quot;Hindenburg&quot;, LZ 130 &quot;Graf Zeppelin II&quot;, and the U.S. Navy airships USS &quot;Los Angeles&quot; (ZR-3, ex-LZ 126), USS &quot;Akron&quot; (ZRS-4) and USS &quot;Macon&quot; (ZRS-5).

=== Bicycles ===

Duralumin was used to manufacture bicycle components and framesets from the 1930s to 1990s. Several companies in Saint-Étienne, France stood out for their early, innovative adoption of duralumin: in 1932, Verot et Perrin developed the first light alloy crank arms; in 1934, Haubtmann released a complete crankset; from 1935 on, Duralumin freewheels, derailleurs, pedals, brakes and handlebars were manufactured by several companies.

Complete framesets followed quickly, including those manufactured by: Mercier (and Aviac and other licensees) with their popular Meca Dural family of models, the Pelissier brothers and their race-worthy La Perle models, and Nicolas Barra and his exquisite mid-twentieth century “Barralumin” creations. Other names that come up here also included: Pierre Caminade, with his beautiful Caminargent creations and their exotic octagonal tubing, and also Gnome et Rhône, with its deep heritage as an aircraft engine manufacturer that also diversified into motorcycles, velomotors and bicycles after World War Two.

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which was prohibited from producing aircraft during the American occupation of Japan, manufactured the “cross” bicycle out of surplus wartime duralumin in 1946. The “cross” was designed by Kiro Honjo, a former aircraft designer responsible for the Mitsubishi G4M.

Duralumin use in bicycle manufacturing faded in the 1970s and 1980s. Vitus nonetheless released the venerable “979” frameset in 1979, a “Duralinox” model that became an instant classic among cyclists. The Vitus 979 was the first production aluminium frameset whose thin-wall 5083/5086 tubing was slip-fit and then glued together using a dry heat-activated epoxy. The result was an extremely lightweight but very durable frameset. Production of the Vitus 979 continued until 1992.

=== Automotive ===
In 2011, BBS Automotive made the RI-D, the world&#x27;s first production automobile wheel made of duralumin. The company has since made other wheels of duralumin also, such as the RZ-D.

<text>Maurice Polydore Marie Bernard Maeterlinck (29 August 1862 – 6 May 1949), also known as Count/Comte Maeterlinck from 1932, was a Belgian playwright, poet, and essayist who was Flemish but wrote in French. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1911 &quot;in appreciation of his many-sided literary activities, and especially of his dramatic works, which are distinguished by a wealth of imagination and by a poetic fancy, which reveals, sometimes in the guise of a fairy tale, a deep inspiration, while in a mysterious way they appeal to the readers&#x27; own feelings and stimulate their imaginations&quot;. The main themes in his work are death and the meaning of life. He was a leading member of La Jeune Belgique group, and his plays form an important part of the Symbolist movement. In later life, Maeterlinck faced credible accusations of plagiarism.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Maeterlinck was born in Ghent, Belgium, to a wealthy, French-speaking family. His mother, Mathilde Colette Françoise (née Van den Bossche), came from a wealthy family. His father, Polydore, was a notary who enjoyed tending the greenhouses on their property.

In September 1874, he was sent to the Jesuit College of Sainte-Barbe, where works of the French Romantics were scorned and only plays on religious subjects were permitted. His experiences at this school influenced his distaste for the Catholic Church and organized religion. One of his companions at that time was the writer Charles van Lerberghe, the poems and plays of whom went on to act as mutual influences on each other at the start of the Symbolist period.

Maeterlinck had written poems and short novels while still studying, but his father wanted him to go into law. After gaining a law degree at the University of Ghent in 1885, he spent a few months in Paris, France. He met members of the new Symbolist movement; Villiers de l&#x27;Isle Adam in particular, who would have a great influence on Maeterlinck&#x27;s subsequent work.

===Career===

Maeterlinck instantly became a public figure when his first play, &quot;Princess Maleine&quot;, received enthusiastic praise from Octave Mirbeau, the literary critic of &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, in August 1890. In the following years he wrote a series of symbolist plays characterized by fatalism and mysticism, most importantly &quot;Intruder&quot; (1890), &quot;The Blind&quot; (1890) and &quot;Pelléas and Mélisande&quot; (1892).

He had a relationship with the singer and actress Georgette Leblanc from 1895 until 1918. Leblanc influenced his work for the following two decades. With the play &quot;Aglavaine and Sélysette&quot; (1896) Maeterlinck began to create characters, especially female characters, who were more in control of their destinies. Leblanc performed these female characters on stage. Even though mysticism and metaphysics influenced his work throughout his career, Maeterlinck slowly replaced his Symbolism with a more existential style.

In 1895, with his parents frowning upon his open relationship with an actress, Maeterlinck and Leblanc moved to the district of Passy in Paris. The Catholic Church was unwilling to grant her a divorce from her Spanish husband. The couple frequently entertained guests, including Mirbeau, Jean Lorrain, and Paul Fort. They spent their summers in Normandy. During this period, Maeterlinck published his &quot;Twelve Songs&quot; (1896), &quot;The Treasure of the Humble&quot; (1896), &quot;The Life of the Bee&quot; (1901), and &quot;Ariadne and Bluebeard&quot; (1902).
In 1903, Maeterlinck received the Triennial Prize for Dramatic Literature from the Belgian government. During this period, and up until the Great War of 1914–1918, he was widely looked up to, throughout Europe, as a great sage, and the embodiment of the higher thought of the time.

In 1906, Maeterlinck and Leblanc moved to a villa in Grasse in the south of France. He spent his hours meditating and walking. As he emotionally pulled away from Leblanc, he entered a state of depression. Diagnosed with neurasthenia, he rented the Benedictine Abbey of St. Wandrille in Normandy to help him relax. By renting the abbey he rescued it from the desecration of being sold and used as a chemical factory and thus he received a blessing from the Pope. Leblanc would often walk around in the garb of an abbess; he would wear roller skates as he moved about the house. During this time, he wrote his essay &quot;The Intelligence of Flowers&quot; (1906), in which he expressed sympathy with socialist ideas. He donated money to many workers&#x27; unions and socialist groups. At this time he conceived his greatest contemporary success: the fairy play &quot;The Blue Bird&quot; (1908, but largely written in 1906).

Stanislavsky&#x27;s 1908 Moscow production, of extraordinary visual beauty, is still over a century later regularly performed in Moscow, in a shortened version as a children&#x27;s matinee. After the writing of &quot;The Intelligence of Flowers&quot;, he suffered from a period of depression and writer&#x27;s block. Although he recovered from this after a year or two, he never became so inventive as a writer again. His later plays, such as &quot;Marie-Victoire&quot; (1907) and &quot;Mary Magdalene&quot; (1910), provided with lead roles for Leblanc, were notably inferior to their predecessors, and sometimes merely repeat an earlier formula. Even though alfresco performances of some of his plays at St. Wandrille had been successful, Maeterlinck felt that he was losing his privacy. The death of his mother on 11 June 1910 added to his depression.

In 1910 he met the 18-year-old actress Renée Dahon during a rehearsal of &quot;The Blue Bird&quot;. She became his lighthearted companion. After having been nominated by Carl Bildt, a member of the Swedish Academy, he received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1911, which served to lighten his spirits. By 1913, he had become more openly socialist and sided with the Belgian trade unions against the Catholic party during a strike. He began to study mysticism and lambasted the Catholic Church in his essays for misconstruing the history of the universe. By a decree of 26 January 1914, the Roman Catholic Church placed his &quot;opera omnia&quot; on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum.

When Germany invaded Belgium in 1914, Maeterlinck wished to join the French Foreign Legion, but his application was denied due to his age. He and Leblanc decided to leave Grasse for a villa near Nice, where he spent the next decade of his life. He gave speeches on the bravery of the Belgian people and placed the blame upon all Germans for the war. Although his patriotism and his indifference to the harm he was doing to his standing in Germany do him credit, his reputation as a great sage who stood above current affairs was damaged by his political involvement.

While in Nice, he wrote &quot;The Mayor of Stilmonde&quot; (1918), which the American press quickly labeled a &quot;Great War Play&quot;, and which became a British film in 1929. He also wrote &quot;The Betrothal&quot; (, 1922), a sequel to &quot;The Blue Bird&quot;, in which the heroine of the play is clearly not a Leblanc archetype.

On 15 February 1919, Maeterlinck married Dahon. He accepted an invitation to the United States, where Samuel Goldwyn asked him to produce a few scenarios for film. Only two of Maeterlinck&#x27;s submissions still exist; Goldwyn didn&#x27;t use any of them. Maeterlinck had prepared one based on his &quot;The Life of the Bee&quot;. After reading the first few pages Goldwyn burst out of his office, exclaiming: &quot;My God! The hero is a bee!&quot;

After 1920, Maeterlinck ceased to contribute significantly to the theatre, but continued to produce essays on his favourite themes of occultism, ethics and natural history. The international demand for these fell off sharply after the early 1920s, but his sales in France remained substantial until the late 1930s. Dahon gave birth to a stillborn child in 1925.

===Plagiarism===
In 1926, Maeterlinck published &quot;La Vie des Termites&quot; (translated into English as &quot;The Life of Termites&quot; or &quot;The Life of White Ants&quot;), an entomological book that plagiarised the book &quot;The Soul of the (White) Ant&quot;, by the Afrikaner poet and scientist Eugène Marais, David Bignell, in his inaugural address as Professor of Zoology at the University of London (2003), called Maeterlinck&#x27;s work &quot;a classic example of academic plagiarism&quot;.
Marais accused Maeterlinck of having appropriated Marais&#x27; concept of the &quot;organic unity&quot; of the termite nest in his book. Marais had published his ideas on termite nests in the South African Afrikaans-language press, in &quot;Die Burger&quot; (January 1923) and in &quot;Huisgenoot&quot;, which featured a series of articles on termites under the title &quot;Die Siel van die Mier&quot; (The Soul of the (White) Ant) from 1925 to 1926. Maeterlinck&#x27;s book, with almost identical content, was published in 1926. It is conjectured that Maeterlinck had come across Marais&#x27; articles while writing his book, and that it would have been easy for him to translate Afrikaans into French, since Maeterlinck knew Dutch and had already made several translations from Dutch into French. It was common at the time, moreover, for worthy articles published in Afrikaans to be reproduced in Flemish and Dutch magazines and journals.

Marais wrote in a letter to Dr. Winifred de Kock in London about Maeterlinck that

The famous author had paid me the left-handed compliment of cribbing the most important part of my work ... He clearly desired his readers to infer that he had arrived at certain of my theories (the result of ten years of hard labour in the veld) by his own unaided reason, although he admits that he never saw a termite in his life. You must understand that it was not merely plagiarism of the spirit of a thing, so to speak. He has copied page after page verbally.

Supported by a coterie of Afrikaner Nationalist friends, Marais sought justice through the South African press and attempted an international lawsuit. This was to prove financially impossible and the case was not pursued. All the same, he gained a measure of renown as the aggrieved party and as an Afrikaner researcher who had opened himself up to plagiarism because he published in Afrikaans out of nationalistic loyalty. Marais brooded at the time of the scandal: &quot;I wonder whether Maeterlinck blushes when he reads such things [critical acclaim], and whether he gives a thought to the injustice he does to the unknown Boer worker?&quot;

Maeterlinck&#x27;s own words in &quot;The Life of Termites&quot; indicate that the possible discovery or accusation of plagiarism worried him:
It would have been easy, in regard to every statement, to allow the text to bristle with footnotes and references. In some chapters there is not a sentence but would have clamoured for these; and the letterpress would have been swallowed up by vast masses of comment, like one of those dreadful books we hated so much at school. There is a short bibliography at the end of the volume which will no doubt serve the same purpose.

Whatever Maeterlinck&#x27;s misgivings at the time of writing, the bibliography he refers to does not include Eugène Marais.

Professor V. E. d&#x27;Assonville referred to Maeterlinck as &quot;the Nobel Prize winner who had never seen a termite in his whole life and had never put a foot on the soil of Africa, least of all in the Waterberg&quot;.

Robert Ardrey, an admirer of Eugène Marais, attributed Marais&#x27; later suicide to this act of plagiarism and theft of intellectual property by Maeterlinck, although Marais&#x27; biographer, Leon Rousseau, suggested that Marais had enjoyed and even thrived on the controversy and the attention it generated.

Another allegation of plagiarism concerned Maeterlinck&#x27;s play &quot;Monna Vanna&quot;, which was said to have been based on Robert Browning&#x27;s little-known play &quot;Luria&quot;.

===Later life===
In 1930, he bought a château in Nice, France, and named it &quot;Orlamonde&quot;, a name occurring in his work &quot;Quinze Chansons&quot;.

He was made a count by Albert I, King of the Belgians in 1932.

According to an article published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1940, he arrived in the United States from Lisbon on the Greek Liner &quot;Nea Hellas&quot;. He had fled to Lisbon in order to escape the Nazi invasion of both Belgium and France. While in Portugal, he stayed in Monte Estoril, at the Grande Hotel, between 27 July and 17 August 1939. The &quot;Times&quot; quoted him as saying, &quot;I knew that if I was captured by the Germans I would be shot at once, since I have always been counted as an enemy of Germany because of my play, &quot;The Mayor of Stilmonde,&quot; which dealt with the conditions in Belgium during the German Occupation of 1918.&quot; As with his earlier visit to America, he still found Americans too casual, friendly and Francophilic for his taste.

He returned to Nice after the war on 10 August 1947. He was President of PEN International, the worldwide association of writers, from 1947 until 1949. In 1948, the French Academy awarded him the Medal for the French Language. He died in Nice on 6 May 1949 after suffering a heart attack.

== Honours ==
* 1920: Grand Cordon of the Order of Leopold.
* 1932: Admitted by Royal Decree to start the procedure to join the Belgian nobility with the title of count. However, he never fulfilled the obligations to lift the patent letters (including the obligation to create a coat of arms). Since the necessary registrations and tax payments were never fulfilled, he as well as his family were never incorporated into the Belgian nobility.

==Static drama==

Maeterlinck&#x27;s posthumous reputation depends entirely on his early plays (published between 1889 and 1894), which created a new style of dialogue, extremely lean and spare, where what is suggested is more important than what is said. The characters have no foresight, and only a limited understanding of themselves or the world around them. That the characters stumble into tragedy without realizing where they are going may suggest that Maeterlinck thought of man as powerless against the forces of fate, but the kinship is not with ancient Greek tragedy but with modern dramatists such as Beckett and Pinter who bring out human vulnerability in a world beyond our comprehension.

Maeterlinck believed that any actor, due to the hindrance of physical mannerisms and expressions, would inadequately portray the symbolic figures of his plays. He concluded that marionettes were an excellent alternative. Guided by strings operated by a puppeteer, Maeterlinck considered marionettes an excellent representation of fate&#x27;s complete control over man. He wrote &quot;Interior&quot;, &quot;The Death of Tintagiles&quot;, and &quot;Alladine and Palomides&quot; for marionette theatre.

From this, he gradually developed his notion of the &quot;static drama.&quot; He felt that it was the artist&#x27;s responsibility to create something that did not express human emotions but rather the external forces that compel people. Maeterlinck once wrote that &quot;the stage is a place where works of art are extinguished. ... Poems die when living people get into them.&quot;

He explained his ideas on the static drama in his essay &quot;The Tragic in Daily Life&quot; (1896), which appeared in &quot;The Treasure of the Humble&quot;. The actors were to speak and move as if pushed and pulled by an external force, fate as puppeteer. They were not to allow the stress of their inner emotions to compel their movements. Maeterlinck would often continue to refer to his cast of characters as &quot;marionettes.&quot;

Maeterlinck&#x27;s conception of modern tragedy rejects the intrigue and vivid external action of traditional drama in favour of a dramatisation of different aspects of life:

He cites a number of classical Athenian tragedies—which, he argues, are almost motionless and which diminish psychological action to pursue an interest in &quot;the individual, face to face with the universe&quot;—as precedents for his conception of static drama; these include most of the works of Aeschylus and Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Ajax&quot;, &quot;Antigone&quot;, &quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot;, and &quot;Philoctetes&quot;. With these plays, he claims:

<text>Eastbourne () is a suburb of Lower Hutt, a part of Wellington, New Zealand. Lying beside the sea, it is a popular local tourist destination via car from Petone or from ferry crossings from central Wellington. An outer suburb, it lies on the eastern shore of Wellington Harbour, five kilometres south of the main Lower Hutt urban area and directly across the harbour from the Miramar Peninsula in Wellington city. A narrow exposed coastal road connects it with the rest of Lower Hutt via the Eastern Bays and the industrial suburb of Seaview. It is named for Eastbourne in England, another seaside town known as a destination for day-trips.

In the hills bordering Eastbourne there is mainly native bush and trees. With a locally administered possum-eradication programme, much of the native bush has regenerated, including red-flowering northern rātā trees. The bush has numerous tracks running to and from them, including a track along the entire bays hills ridge. With many settlers originating from Stromboli, an island near Sicily, the suburb has an Italian heritage similar to several other suburbs in Wellington; this is expressed particularly in its architecture.

== History ==
The suburb&#x27;s origins lie in pre-colonial times, with local Māori Iwi having several Kāinga and Pā in the area for hundreds of years, in the bays and the raised headlands respectively. These settlements were located in the bays north of the suburb&#x27;s centre, such as Point Howard and the Lowry, Rona and Days Bays. These settlements were essential, as they blocked out invasion from the neighbouring iwi in the Wairarapa, Ngāti Kahungunu. Raids were a common affair, and forced local Māori to always be vigilant.

European settlement increased after the devastating 1855 Wairarapa earthquake, because the Waiwhetu river in Seaview was lowered, along with the raising of the shore of Wellington Harbour by 2 metres. Eastbourne&#x27;s Italian heritage began with the settlement of Rona Bay (originally known as Brown&#x27;s Bay) by Italians Bartolo and Italia Russo 1892. Renaming it after themselves as Russo Bay, the Russos, originally from Stromboli, they established a hotel and began horticultural and fishing industries. They prompted many relatives and friends to also emigrate, propelling Eastbourne into an elaborate little Italian New Zealander stronghold. 

Prior to its amalgamation into Lower Hutt, the Borough of Eastbourne comprised a separate town, with its own council and civic administration. The &quot;Eastbourne Community Board&quot;, a remnant of the former town council, remains vocal on local issues. A local bus station still bears the &quot;Borough of Eastbourne&quot; name.

The Wahine disaster was New Zealand&#x27;s worst modern maritime disaster, occurring on 10 April 1968, when the ferry Wahine struck Barrett Reef in Wellington Harbour during a storm and capsized. 734 people were on board, and 53 died from drowning, injuries, or exposure to the elements. Eastbourne was cut off from the city by heavy seas which washed over Marine Drive. Passengers from the sinking vessel began to go towards Eastbourne and Seatoun. Residents took in survivors, Eastbourne&#x27;s two hair-dressing salons emptied their establishments of towels and the local bakery delivered sandwiches, soup and trays piled with buns, scones, muffins, pies and cakes to the RSA. Installed in 2010, there now lies a memorial opposite the bus barn for those who died in the disaster.

== Culture and features today ==
Eastbourne constitutes Point Howard, Sorrento Bay, Whiorau/Lowry Bay, York Bay, Mahina Bay, Sunshine Bay, Days Bay, Rona Bay, Robinson bay, and Camp Bay.

Eastbourne&#x27;s culture involves its laid-back, sunny atmosphere, small restaurants, heritage homes and remoteness that invokes a curiosity among other Wellingtonians, who have flocked there for summer day trips since the 19th century.

A regular trans-harbour ferry service connects Wellington&#x27;s CBD and Eastbourne, docking at the Days Bay wharf in Eastbourne and at Queen&#x27;s Wharf close to down-town Wellington. The ferry started in 1886, became daily in 1901, was bought by Eastbourne Borough Council in 1913 and stopped between 1948 and 1989. The ferry service is now owned and operated by East by West Ferries who added services between Eastbourne and Seatoun (which ceased in 2021 due to the Seaton Wharf undergoing substantial repairs to maintain safety and preserve its heritage. However after its reopening in 2022, the company chose not to resume services) and services between Eastbourne and Mātiu / Somes Island.

The southern terminus of buses in Eastbourne is the Bus Barn, or Eastbourne Borough Council Omnibus Service Garage, which was formally opened on 24 May 1939. It has had a Historic Place Category 2 listing (Number 7644) since 8 February 2006. It was in the news in March 2022 when a double-deck bus tried to enter its low doorway.

Eastbourne has two currently operational local primary schools: Muritai School and (in Days Bay) Wellesley College.

At the end of Eastbourne beyond Burdan&#x27;s gate there is a pedestrian-only coastal road (unsealed) which extends out to the Wellington Harbour entrance heads, where there are three lighthouses including both the upper and lower now decommissioned Pencarrow Head Lighthouse which were then replaced in 1935 by the Baring Head Lighthouse. This area, popular with cyclists, provides access to East Harbour Regional Park.

The hills surrounding Eastbourne provide an important habitat for indigenous biodiversity and contain some of New Zealand&#x27;s rarest and most-endangered plant species.

The banded dotterel (tūturiwhatu) is a nationally vulnerable bird that nests in the Eastbourne foreshore (Robinson Bay), Baring Head, and Parangarahu Lakes. Predator Free NZ has said that the banded dotterel is more endangered than the whio and great spotted kiwi. MIRO, Greater Wellington, Hutt City Council, and Taranaki Whānui ki Te Upoko o Te Ika have worked together since 2013 to manage the coastal-breeding populations of these birds.

The Eastbourne banded dotterel colony is located along the eastern shores of Wellington Harbour in Lower Hutt, and is the only breeding site for this species inside Wellington Harbour. In 2020, volunteers monitoring the site noted that a lone cat had eaten eggs and killed chicks, decimating seven nests in one season.

Eastbourne has two ANZAC war memorials, one is located along the fencing of Muritai School installed in 1986, and the second is a Pōhutukawa (planted on 14 July 1915 by Eastbourne Mayor J P Kelly) together with its plaque forming the first ANZAC memorial erected in New Zealand.

<text>Christian Gottlob Heyne (; 25 September 1729 – 14 July 1812) was a German classical scholar and archaeologist as well as long-time director of the Göttingen State and University Library. He was a member of the Göttingen school of history.

==Biography==
Heyne was born in Chemnitz, Saxony. His father was a poor weaver who had left Silesia and moved to Saxony to maintain his Protestant faith; Christian&#x27;s education was paid for by his godfather. In 1748 he entered the University of Leipzig, where he was often short of the necessaries of life. He was helped by the classicist , who encouraged him and loaned him Greek and Latin texts. He obtained a position as tutor in the family of a French merchant in Leipzig, which enabled him to continue his studies. In 1752 law professor Johann August Bach awarded Heyne a master&#x27;s degree, but he was for many years in very straitened circumstances.

An elegy written by Heyne in Latin on the death of a friend attracted the attention of Count von Brühl, the prime minister, who expressed a desire to see the author. Accordingly, in April 1752, Heyne journeyed to Dresden, believing that his fortune was made. He was well received and promised a secretaryship and a good salary, but nothing came of it. Another period of poverty followed, and only by persistent solicitation was Heyne able to obtain the post of under-clerk in the count&#x27;s library, with a salary of less than twenty pounds sterling.

Heyne increased this pittance by translation: in addition to some French novels, he rendered into German &quot;The Loves of Chaereas and Callirrhoe&quot; of Chariton, the Greek romance writer. He published his first edition of Tibullus in 1755, and in 1756 his Epictetus. In the latter year the Seven Years&#x27; War broke out and the library was destroyed, and Heyne was once more in a state of destitution. In 1757 he was offered a tutorship in the household of Frau von Schönberg, where he met his future wife.

In January 1758 Heyne accompanied his pupil to the University of Wittenberg, but the Prussian invasion drove him out in 1760. The bombardment of Dresden, on 18 July 1760, destroyed all his possessions, including an almost finished edition of Lucian, based on a valuable codex of the Dresden Library. In the summer of 1761, still without any fixed income, he married, and became land-steward to the Baron von Löben in Lusatia. At the end of 1762, however, he was able to return to Dresden, where he was commissioned by P. D. Lippert to prepare the Latin text of the third volume of his &quot;Dactyliotheca&quot; (art account of a collection of gems).

On the death of Johann Matthias Gesner at the University of Göttingen in 1761, the vacant chair was refused first by Ernesti and then by Ruhnken, who persuaded Münchhausen, the Hanoverian minister and principal curator of the university to bestow it on Heyne (1763). His emoluments were gradually augmented, and his growing celebrity brought him most advantageous offers from other German governments, which he persistently refused. Heyne was simultaneously given the post of director of the university library, a position he held until his death in 1812. Under his directorship, the library, today known as the Göttingen State and University Library, grew in size and reputation to be one of the leading academic libraries of the world, due to Heyne&#x27;s innovative cataloguing methods and aggressive international acquisitions policy.

Unlike Gottfried Hermann, Heyne regarded the study of grammar and language only as the means to an end, not as the chief object of philology. But, although not a critical scholar, he was the first to attempt a scientific treatment of Greek mythology, and he gave an undoubted impulse to philological studies. He taught both Wilhelm and Alexander Humboldt in classical philology and managed to harness both brothers&#x27; interest in linguistic questions.

Of Heyne&#x27;s numerous writings, the following may be mentioned: editions, with copious commentaries, of Tibullus (ed. SC Wunderlich, 1817), Virgil (ed. GP Wagner, 1830–1841), Pindar (3rd ed. by GH Schafer, 1817), Apollodorus, &quot;Bibliotheca Graeca&quot; (1803), Homer, &quot;Iliad&quot; (1802); and &quot;Opuscula academica&quot; (1785–1812), containing more than a hundred academic dissertations, of which the most valuable are those relating to the colonies of Greece and the antiquities of Etruscan art and history. His &quot;Antiquarische Aufsätze&quot; (1778–1779) is a valuable collection of essays connected with the history of ancient art. His contributions to the &quot;Göttingische gelehrte Anzeigen&quot; are said to have been between 7,000 and 8,000 in number.

For further details on Heyne&#x27;s life, see the biography by Heeren (1813) which forms the basis of the essay by Thomas Carlyle (&quot;Misc. Essays&quot;, ii.); Hermann Sauppe, &quot;Göttinger Professoren&quot; (1872); Conrad Bursian in &quot;Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie&quot; xii.; JE Sandys, &quot;Hist. Class. Schol&quot; iii. 36–44; and Friedrich Klingner, &quot;Christian Gottlob Heyne&quot; (Leipzig: Poeschel &amp; Trepte, 1937, 25 pages).

Heyne was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in April 1789.

He died in Göttingen.

== Personal life ==
In 1761, Heyne married his first wife Therese, the daughter of lutenist Silvius Leopold Weiss. They had four surviving children, including Benjamin Heyne, botanist, naturalist, and surgeon who worked in British India as a Botanist to Samalkot in the Madras Presidency under the British East India Company, and Therese Huber, who became one of the first well-known journalists in Germany as editor of the . After the 1775 death of his first wife, Heyne married Georgine Brandes in 1777. The couple had six children.

<doc id="162203" wikidata="Q434567" url="?curid=162203" title="Chariton">
<text>Chariton of [[Aphrodisias]] () was the author of an ancient Greek novel probably titled &quot;Callirhoe&quot; (based on the subscription in the sole surviving manuscript). However, it is regularly referred to as &quot;Chaereas and Callirhoe&quot; (which more closely aligns with the title given at the head of the manuscript). Evidence of fragments of the text on papyri suggests that the novel may have been written in the mid-1st century AD, making it the oldest surviving complete ancient prose romance and the only one to make use of apparent historiographical features for background verisimilitude and structure, in conjunction with elements of Greek mythology, as Callirhoe is frequently compared to Aphrodite and Ariadne and Chaereas to numerous heroes, both implicitly and explicitly. As the fiction takes place in the past, and historical figures interact with the plot, &quot;Callirhoe&quot; may be understood as the first historical novel; it was later imitated by Xenophon of Ephesus and Heliodorus of Emesa, among others.

== Dating ==
Nothing is securely known of Chariton beyond what he states in his novel, which introduces him as &quot;Chariton of Aphrodisias, secretary of the &quot;rhetor&quot; Athenagoras&quot;. The name &quot;Chariton&quot;, which means &quot;man of graces&quot;, has been considered a pseudonym chosen to suit the romantic content of his writing, but both &quot;Chariton&quot; and &quot;Athenagoras&quot; occur as names on inscriptions from Aphrodisias.

The latest possible date at which Chariton could have written is attested in papyri that contain fragments of his work, which can be dated paleographically to about AD 200. A variety of dating suggestions have been generated by analyzing Chariton&#x27;s words. A date as late as the sixth century AD was suggested in the 19th century, before the discovery of the papyri, based on stylistic considerations, while A. D. Papanikolaou argued for the second half of the first century BC in 1979. One study of Chariton&#x27;s vocabulary favours a date in the late 1st century or early 2nd century AD.

Edmund Cueva has argued that Chariton also depended on Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;vita&quot; of Theseus for thematic material, or perhaps directly on one of Plutarch&#x27;s sources, an obscure mythographer, Paion of Amathus. If the source is Plutarch, then a date after the first quarter of the 2nd century is indicated. There is a dismissive reference, however, to a work called &quot;Callirhoe&quot; in the &quot;Satires&quot; of Persius, who died in AD 62; if this is Chariton&#x27;s novel, then a relatively early date would be indicated. Regardless, Chariton probably wrote before the other Greek novelists whose works survive, making either his work or Petronius&#x27; &quot;Satyricon&quot; the earliest extant European novel.

== &quot;Callirhoe&quot; ==
Chariton&#x27;s novel exists in only one (somewhat unreliable) manuscript, from the 13th century. It was not published until the 18th century, and remained dismissed until the twentieth. It nevertheless gives insight into the development of ancient prose fiction.

The story is set against a historical background of c. 400 BC. In Syracuse, Chaereas falls madly in love with the supernaturally beautiful Callirhoe. She is the daughter of Hermocrates, a hero of the Peloponnesian War and the most important political figure of Syracuse, thus setting the narrative in time and social milieu. Her beauty (&quot;kallos&quot;) overawes crowds, like an earthly counterpart of Aphrodite&#x27;s, as noted by Douglas Edwards. They are married, but when her many disappointed suitors successfully conspire to trick Chaereas into thinking she is unfaithful, he kicks her so hard that she falls over as if dead. There is a funeral, and she is shut up in a tomb, but then it turns out she was only in a coma, and wakes up in time to scare the pirates who have opened the tomb to rob it; they recover quickly and take her to sell as a slave in Miletus, where her new master, Dionysius, falls in love with her and marries her, she being afraid to mention that she is already married (and pregnant by Chaereas). As a result, Dionysius believes Callirhoe&#x27;s son to be his own.

Despite the liberties Chariton took with historical fact, he clearly aimed to place his story in a period well before his own lifetime. Tomas Hägg has argued that this choice of setting makes the work an important forerunner of the modern historical novel.

The discovery of five separate fragments of Chariton&#x27;s novel at Oxyrhynchus and Karanis in Egypt attest to the popularity of &quot;Callirhoe&quot;. One fragment, carefully written on expensive parchment, suggests that some, at least, of Chariton&#x27;s public were members of local elites.

<doc id="162217" wikidata="Q109598" url="?curid=162217" title="Tibullus">
<text>Albius Tibullus ( BC BC) was a Latin poet and writer of elegies. His first and second books of poetry are extant; many other texts attributed to him are of questionable origins.

Little is known about the life of Tibullus. There are only a few references to him by later writers and a short &quot;Life&quot; of doubtful authority. Neither his &quot;praenomen&quot; nor his birthplace is known, and his gentile name has been questioned. His status was probably that of a Roman &quot;eques&quot; (so the &quot;Life&quot; affirms), and he had inherited a considerable estate. Like Virgil and Propertius, he seems to have lost most of it in 41 BC in the confiscations of Mark Antony and Octavian.

== Life ==
Tibullus&#x27;s chief friend and patron was Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus, himself an orator and poet as well as a statesman and a commander. Messalla, like Gaius Maecenas, was at the centre of a literary circle in Rome. This circle had no relationship with the court, and the name of Augustus is found nowhere in the writings of Tibullus. About 30 BC Messalla was dispatched by Augustus to Gaul to quell a rising in Aquitania and restore order in the country, and Tibullus may have been in his retinue. On a later occasion, probably in 28, he would have accompanied his friend who had been sent on a mission to the East, but he fell sick and had to stay behind in Corcyra. Tibullus had no liking for war, and though his life seems to have been divided between Rome and his country estate, his own preferences were wholly for the country life.

The loss of Tibullus&#x27;s landed property is attested by himself (i.1, 19), as a farmer (&quot;of a once fruitful, now impoverished field&quot;; cf. 41, 42). Its cause is only an inference, though a very probable one. That he was allowed to retain a portion of his estate with the family mansion is clear from ii.4, 53. Tibullus may have been Messalla&#x27;s in the Aquitanian War (&quot;Vita Tib.&quot; and Tib. i.7, 9 seq., a poem composed for Messalla&#x27;s triumph), and may have received &quot;dona militaria&quot; (&quot;Vita Tib.&quot;).

Tibullus died prematurely, probably in 19, around the same time as Virgil or not long afterwards. His death made a deep impression in Rome, as is clear from his contemporary, Domitius Marsus, and from the elegy in which Ovid enshrined the memory of his predecessor.

==Horace and Tibullus==
Two short poems by Horace, addressed to a certain Albius (&quot;Odes&quot; 1.33 and &quot;Epistles&quot; 1.4), are believed to refer to Tibullus. In the first of these poems Horace advises Albius not to be excessive in singing sad elegies in memory of the cruel &quot;Glycera&quot; (assumed to be the same as Nemesis).

In the second poem, Horace imagines Albius, when he receives the letter, either writing poetry or wandering in the woods near Pedum. He goes on: &quot;You were not (born as) a body without a heart; the gods gave you beauty, riches, and the art of enjoying them. What more could a nurse wish for in her charge than that he should be intelligent, able to speak what he feels, and have style, fame, and health in abundance?&quot; Horace advises his friend, whatever hopes and fears and angers he has, to live each day as if it was his last. At the end he makes a joke to cheer his friend up, comparing himself to a &quot;pig from Epicurus&#x27;s herd&quot;.

Although J. P. Postgate challenged the identification of Albius with Tibullus, more recent scholars such as Ullman, Putnam, and Ball have argued that they are the same. In Putnam&#x27;s analysis, Tibullus, in Horace&#x27;s view, is too much given to self-pity, and would benefit from taking a more philosophical view of life&#x27;s foibles.

The first book of Horace&#x27;s &quot;Odes&quot; was published in 23 BC, and the first book of the &quot;Epistles&quot; in 20 BC, making the time-frame plausible, if Albius is Tibullus.

== First book of poetry ==

Tibullus&#x27;s first book consists of poems written at various times between 30 and 26. His first love, the subject of book i., is called Delia in the poems, but Apuleius reveals that her real name was Plania. It appears that she was not entitled to wear the &quot;stola&quot;, the dress of Roman matrons (i. 6, 68), and so was doubtless a courtesan. Her husband is mentioned as absent (i. 2, 67 seq.). She eludes the guards placed over her (i. 2, 15 and 6, 7). Tibullus&#x27;s suit was favoured by Delia&#x27;s mother, of whom he speaks in very affectionate terms (i. 6, 57 seq.). For Tibullus&#x27;s illness at Corcyra, see i. 3, I seq., 55 seq. The fifth elegy was written during an estrangement (), and the sixth after the return of the husband and during Delia&#x27;s double infidelity. It is impossible to give an exact account of the intimacy. The poems which refer to her are arranged in no chronological order. Sometimes she appears as single, sometimes as married; but we hear nothing either of her marriage or of her husband&#x27;s death. Yet it is clear that it was the absence of her husband on military service in Cilicia which gave Tibullus the opportunity to see her, and he continued to do so when the husband returned. Delia was clever in deception — too clever, as Tibullus saw when he found that he was not the only lover. His entreaties and appeals were of no avail; and after the first book no more is heard of Delia.

=== The Marathus cycle ===
In addition, three elegies in Book I (1.4, 1.8, and 1.9) concern themselves with Tibullus&#x27;s love for a boy, who is named Marathus. The three poems constitute the longest poetic project in Roman literature having homosexual love as theme. The first of these poems, 1.4, begins with an imprecation of the poet to the god Priapus, asking for advice on how to win over beautiful boys. The god advises patience and that the man in love yield to the beloved boy&#x27;s every whim and perform a series of services if the boy demands it (1.4.15–53). At first the narrator of the poem presents himself as someone who is simply asking for advice from the god on behalf of a friend Titius who has fallen in love with a boy but whose wife forbids such affairs (1.4.73). He later portrays himself as a teacher in the affairs of love, declaring that the doors of his house are open for other men in love with boys to ask his advice (1.4.78). In the last four lines, however, he confesses to loving a boy named Marathus, who tortures him with &quot;love&#x27;s delay&quot; (1.4.81) and whom the narrator cannot conquer with his arts, causing other men to laugh at his lessons (1.4.83).

The cycle is resumed in poem 1.8, in which the narrator learns that Marathus is in love with a girl. The narrator advises the girl to treat Marathus with more leniency than Marathus treated the narrator himself (1.8.49). The narrator accompanies Marathus to the girl&#x27;s house, carrying a torch to light the path at night, bribes her so that she meets Marathus, and talks the boy up to the girl (this is described in more detail the next poem, 1.9, lines 41–44). This poem can be seen as part of the narrator&#x27;s efforts to win Marathus&#x27; goodwill by performing a series of humiliating tasks for him, exceeding the god&#x27;s counsel to perform hard physical labors for the lad, by also helping him carry on an affair with someone else.

In the poem that ends the cycle, 1.9, Marathus is not named, but it is usually assumed that it is about the same boy. In this poem the narrator reveals that Marathus is in a relationship with a much older married man who buys the young man&#x27;s affections through expensive gifts. Initially, the narrator asks the gods for compassion towards Marathus (1.9.5–6), who betrayed a promise he had made to the narrator, but soon love yields to bitterness, and he begins to express the desire that the gifts of the rival lover turn to ashes (1.9.11–12) and that the same happen to the poems that the narrator wrote to Marathus to win him over (1.9.48–49), of which he is now ashamed. He turns to the rival, taking revenge on him for having stolen his boyfriend by taunting him with the affair that the rival&#x27;s wife is herself having with another young man (1.9.54–58 and 65–74). Finally, the poet addresses the boy himself, telling him that he will cry when he sees the poet fall in love with another capricious lad (1.9.79–80), but declaring himself, for the time being, finally released from unfaithful love.

== Second book of poetry ==

About the second book, scholars can only say that in all likelihood it was published before the poet&#x27;s death in 19 BC. It is very short, containing only 6 poems (428 verses), but apparently complete. 

The first poem, of 90 lines, describes an idealised life in the country; the second, of 22 lines, celebrates the birthday of a certain Cornutus. The fifth poem is a hymn to Apollo celebrating the installation of Messalla&#x27;s son as one of the fifteen priests who were guardians of the Sibylline Books (the ).

In poems 3–6 of the second book the place of Delia is taken by &quot;Nemesis&quot;, which is also a fictitious name. Nemesis (like the Cynthia of Propertius) was probably a courtesan of the higher class; and she had other admirers besides Tibullus. He complains bitterly of his bondage, and of her rapacity and hard-heartedness. In spite of all, however, she seems to have retained her hold on him until his death.

Ovid, writing at the time of Tibullus&#x27;s death, says: &quot;&quot; (&quot;Thus Nemesis and Delia will be long remembered: one Tibullus&#x27; recent love, the other his first&quot;). Nemesis is the subject of the last four poems of book 2. The connection had lasted a year when 2.5 was written (see ver. 109). It is worth noticing that Martial selects Nemesis as the source of Tibullus&#x27;s reputation.

== Third book of poetry ==
The third book of the collection contains a miscellaneous collection of poems, and most scholars today believe that none of them are by Tibullus (even though one of them 3.19, seems to claim Tibullus as author). Sometime in the 15th century the book was split into two parts, so that poems 3.8 to 3.20 are sometimes referred to as 4.1 to 4.14.

===Lygdamus elegies===

The third book opens with a set of six poems in elegiac couplets (290 verses) by a poet who calls himself &quot;Lygdamus&quot;, all but the fifth celebrating his love for a woman called Neaera, whom he describes as &quot;unfaithful, but all the same beloved&quot; (3.6.56). In one line (3.5.18) he gives his own birthdate as the equivalent of 43 BC, using the same words as Ovid used in &quot;Tristia&quot; 4.10.6 to describe his own birthdate (&quot;the year when both consuls fell by equal fate&quot;). There are a number of other similarities between Lygdamus and Ovid, which are examined in an article by A. G. Lee. Lee comes to the conclusion that Lygdamus must have copied Ovid, not the reverse, and that his date may have been in the late 1st century AD. F. Navarro Antolín comes to the same conclusion, citing among other reasons certain words that were not generally used in poetry of the time of Tibullus.

Other scholars, however, noting the great overlap in vocabulary and stylistic features between Lygdamus and Ovid, have argued that the Lygdamus poems were written anonymously by the youthful Ovid himself.

Unlike Tibullus&#x27;s Delia and Nemesis, or Propertius&#x27;s Cynthia, Lygdamus&#x27;s Neaera appears not to have been a prostitute but is described as Lygdamus&#x27;s &quot;wife&quot; () with respectable parents whom the poet knows. Radford and others take this as representing the situation of Ovid himself, whose second wife apparently divorced him.

According to one theory, the six poems of Lygdamus were originally added by booksellers to book 2, to make up the very short length of that book, and only later transferred to book 3. This would have made book 1 and 2 of almost equal length (820 lines + 718 lines).

===&quot;Panegyricus Messallae&quot;===

Poem 3.7, unlike all the other poems in the Tibullan collection, is written in dactylic hexameters. It is a panegyric of Messalla (consul 31 BC), 212 lines long. There is no indication of the author, although, like Tibullus (1.1.41–43), the author complains that his family was once very wealthy but that their estate has been reduced to a small farm (3.7.181–191). It is thought by some scholars that the poem itself was probably written in 31, the year of Messalla&#x27;s consulship, or soon afterwards. Other scholars, however, view it as a pseudepigraphical work written many years later.

Although many scholars have criticised the style of the poem, it has also been called &quot;brilliant, though excessively rhetorical&quot;. Among its features are two long digressions, one (lines 48–81) detailing all the wanderings of Ulysses (Odysseus) up to his arrival on the island of Phaeacia, and the other (lines 151–176) describing the five climatic zones of the world. F. S. Bright demonstrates how these two digressions are in fact related and how both have relevance to Messalla.

===Garland of Sulpicia===

There follow five short elegiac poems (94 lines in all) concerning the love of Sulpicia for a certain Cerinthus. These are often known as the Garland of Sulpicia or the Cerinthus-Sulpicia cycle. Three of them (3.8, 3.10, 3.12) are composed in the voice of the poet; the other two (3.9 and 3.11) are replies by Sulpicia. The style of all them is similar and most scholars believe they are the work of a single author. Some scholars attribute them to Tibullus himself; but the validity of this attribution is uncertain. Cerinthus is thought to be a pseudonym, and is sometimes identified with Tibullus&#x27;s friend Cornutus, who is addressed in 2.2.

===Sulpicia epigrams===

The next group (3.13–3.18) is a set of six very short elegiac poems (40 lines in all) apparently written to or about Cerinthus by Sulpicia herself. The style of these is markedly different from the preceding group of poems. Her syntax has been described as &quot;convoluted&quot; and in some parts (e.g. 3.16) the meaning is not clear. Although there are some dissenting voices, most scholars accept that these six poems are genuinely written by a female poet, Sulpicia, the only Roman female poet whose work has survived. Their frank and passionate outpourings are reminiscent of Catullus. The style and metrical handling was originally understood to be that of a novice, or a male poet appropriating female form. Later analysis has concluded that Sulpicia is an adept poet with a very high level of skill, playing upon gender norms in the celebration of her erotic relationship and play upon her as a poet and a woman of high status.

===Poem 3.19===
Poem 3.19 (24 lines) claims to be by Tibullus, but its authorship has been doubted. Radford (1923) believed it to be by Ovid, calling it an &quot;exquisite &#x27;imitation&#x27; of Tibullus which has itself been imitated and admired by so many English poets.&quot; However, in a recent assessment of the poem, Stephen Heyworth (2021) believes that Tibullan authorship cannot be ruled out, and that it may even be a fragment from the lost ending of book 2.

In this poem the poet promises his (unnamed) girlfriend that no other girl will ever take her place. He swears this by Juno, the goddess he reveres most. He will never cease to be a slave at the altar of Venus, the goddess of love.

The poem appears twice in the main manuscript, the 14th-century Ambrosianus, once after 3.6 and again after 3.18.

===Poem 3.20===
3.20 is a four-line epigram with nothing to determine its authorship. It complains about a rumour that the author&#x27;s girlfriend has been unfaithful, but he tells the rumour to be quiet. The word &quot;be quiet!&quot; appropriately brings the collection of poems to a close.

===Epitaph===
At the end of the book comes the epigram of the poet Domitius Marsus, a contemporary of Tibullus, commemorating the fact that both Tibullus and Virgil died about the same time (19 BC), Tibullus being only a young man at the time.

To sum up: the third and fourth books appear in the oldest tradition as a single book, and they comprise pieces by different authors in different styles, none of which can be assigned to Tibullus with any certainty. The natural conclusion is that a collection of scattered compositions, relating to Messalla and the members of his circle, was added as an appendix to the genuine relics of Tibullus. When this &quot;Messalla collection&quot; was made cannot be exactly determined; but it was definitely not till after the death of Tibullus, 19 BC, and perhaps as late as the late 1st century AD. Besides the foregoing, two pieces in the collection called &quot;Priapea&quot; (one an epigram and the other a longer piece in iambics) have been attributed to Tibullus; but there is little external and no internal evidence of his authorship.

== Style of writing ==
Though the character of Tibullus the historical man is unclear, the character of his poetic persona is reflected in his works. In Postgate&#x27;s view, he was an amiable man of generous impulses and unselfish disposition, loyal to his friends to the verge of self-sacrifice (as is shown by his leaving Delia to accompany Messalla to Asia), and apparently constant to his mistresses. His tenderness towards them is enhanced by a refinement and delicacy which are rare among the ancients. When treated cruelly by his love, he does not invoke curses upon her head. Instead he goes to her little sister&#x27;s grave, hung so often with his garlands and wet with his tears, to bemoan his fate. His ideal is a quiet retirement in the country with the loved one at his side. He has no ambition and not even a poet&#x27;s yearning for immortality. In an age of crude materialism and gross superstition, he was religious in the old Roman way. His clear, finished and yet unaffected style made him a great favourite and placed him, in the judgment of Quintilian, ahead of other elegiac writers. For natural grace and tenderness, for exquisiteness of feeling and expression, he stands alone. He rarely overloads his lines with Alexandrian learning. However, his range is limited. Tibullus is smoother and more musical, but liable to become monotonous; Propertius, with occasional harshnesses, is more vigorous and varied. In many of Tibullus&#x27;s poems a symmetrical composition can be traced.

== The &quot;Vita Tibulli&quot; ==
A short (Life of Tibullus) is found at the end of the Ambrosian, Vatican and inferior manuscripts. It has been much discussed. There is little in it that cannot be inferred from Tibullus himself and from what Horace says about Albius, though it is possible that its compiler may have taken some of his statements from Suetonius&#x27;s book .

== Manuscripts ==
The best manuscript of Tibullus is the (A), which has been dated , whose earliest known owner was the humanist Coluccio Salutati. Two early 15th-century manuscripts are Paris lat. 7989 (written in Florence in 1423) and the Vatican MS. Ottob. lat. 1202 (also written in Florence, 1426). These form only a small share of the over 100 Renaissance manuscripts. There are also a number of extracts from Tibullus in , an anthology from various Latin writers collected in the mid-twelfth century, and a few extracts in the , preserved in a manuscript now at Munich. Also excerpts from the lost , made by Scaliger, and now in the library at Leiden are of importance for their independence of A. It contained the part from 3.4.65 to the end, useful as fragments go as the other manuscripts lack 3.4.65. The , a late manuscript containing the works of Catullus, Tibullus and Propertius, is still extant.

== Editions ==
Tibullus was first printed with Catullus, Propertius, and the of Statius by Vindelinus de Spira (Venice, 1472), and separately by Florentius de Argentina, probably in the same year. Amongst other editions are those by Scaliger (with Catullus and Propertius, 1577, etc.), Broukhusius (1708), Vulpius (1749), Heyne (1817, 4th ed. by Wunderlich, with supplement by Dissen, 1819), Huschke (1819), Lachmann (1829), Dissen (1835), Lucian Müller (1870), Emil Baehrens (1878), Heinrich Dittrich (1881), Edward Hiller (1885) and John Percival Postgate (1905). 

Among more recent commentaries are those by Kirby Flower Smith (1913), Paul Murgatroyd (1980/1994), and Robert Maltby (2002/2021). Guy Lee&#x27;s edition and translation of books 1-2 (Cambridge, 1975) is based on a fresh collation of A.

==Critiques==
Francis Cairns regards Tibullus as &quot;a good poet but not a great one&quot;; Dorothea Wender similarly calls him a minor poet but argues there is &quot;grace and polish and symmetry&quot; to his work.

<doc id="162228" wikidata="Q17118945" url="?curid=162228" title="Dial tone">
<text>A dial tone (dialling tone in the UK) is a telephony signal sent by a telephone exchange or private branch exchange (PBX) to a terminating device, such as a telephone, when an off-hook condition is detected. It indicates that the exchange is working and is ready to initiate a telephone call. The tone stops when the first dialed digit is recognized. If no digits are forthcoming, the partial dial procedure is invoked, often eliciting a special information tone and an intercept message, followed by the off-hook tone, requiring the caller to hang up and redial.

==History==
Early telephone exchanges signaled the switchboard operator when a subscriber picked up the telephone handset to make a call. The operator answered requesting the destination of the call. When manual exchanges were replaced with automated switching systems, the exchange generated a tone to the caller when the telephone set was picked up, indicating that the system was ready to accept dialed digits. Each digit was transmitted as it was dialed which caused the switching system to select the desired destination circuit. Modern electronic telephones may store the digits as they are entered, and only switch off-hook to complete the dialing when the subscriber presses a button.

Invented by engineer August Kruckow, the dial tone was first used in 1908 in Hildesheim, Germany.

The Bell Telephone Manufacturing Company (BTMC) in Antwerp, Belgium, Western Electric&#x27;s international subsidiary, first introduced dial tone as a standard facility with the cutover of the 7A Rotary Automatic Machine Switching System at Darlington, England, on 10 October 1914. Dial tone was an essential feature, because the 7A Rotary system was a common control switching system. It used the dial tone to indicate to the user that the switching system was ready to accept digits.

In the United States, dial tone was introduced in the 1920s. By the time President Dwight D. Eisenhower retired in 1961 it was nearly universal, but the president himself had never encountered a dial tone. When he picked up his own household phone, his assistant had to explain what the strange noise was, as well as show Eisenhower how to use a rotary dial phone.

Before modern electronic telephone switching systems came into use, dial tones were usually generated by electromechanical devices such as motor-generators or vibrators. In the United States, the standard &quot;city&quot; dial tone was a 600 Hz tone that was amplitude-modulated at 120 Hz. Some dial tones were simply adapted from 60 Hz AC line current. In the UK, the standard Post Office dialing tone was 33 Hz; it was generated by a motor-driven ringing machine in most exchanges and by a vibrating-reed generator in the smaller ones. Some later ringing machines also generated a 50 Hz dial tone.

The modern dial tone varies between countries. The Precise Tone Plan for the North American Numbering Plan of the US, Canada, and various Caribbean nations specifies a combination of two tones (350 Hz and 440 Hz) which, when mixed, creates a beat frequency of 90 Hz. The UK dial tone is similar, but combines 350 Hz and 450 Hz tones instead, creating a 100 Hz beat frequency. Most of Europe, as well as much of Latin America and Africa, uses a constant single tone of 425 Hz. France currently uses a single 440 Hz tone and Japan uses a single 400 Hz tone.

Cellular telephone services do not generate dial tones as no connection is made until the entire number has been specified and transmitted.

==Variants==
===Second dial tone===
Private branch exchanges (PBXs) or key telephone systems also play a dial tone to station users. It may be the same type as used by the public switched telephone network (PSTN), or it may be a different tone to remind users to dial a prefix or select by another method an outside line.

===Secondary dial tone===
A secondary dial tone is a dial tone-like sound presented to the caller after a call has been set up to prompt for additional digits to be dialed. Secondary dial tones are often used in call queuing and call forwarding systems.

===Stutter dial tone===
A stutter dial tone is a rapidly interrupted tone used to indicate special service conditions. It may serve as a message-waiting indicator for voice mail, or indicate that a calling feature, such as call forwarding has been activated.

===Soft dial tones===
A soft dial tone or express dial tone may be used when no actual service is active on a line, and normal calls cannot be made. It is maintained only so that an attached phone can dial the emergency telephone number (such as 911, 112 or 999), in compliance with the law in most places. It can sometimes also call the business office of the local exchange carrier which owns or last leased the line, such as via 6-1-1. Other functions such as ringback or ANAC may also be accessed by technicians in order to facilitate installation or activation.

<doc id="162231" wikidata="Q675705" url="?curid=162231" title="Igraine">
<text>In the Matter of Britain, Igraine () is the mother of King Arthur. Igraine is also known in Latin as Igerna, in Welsh as Eigr (Middle Welsh Eigyr), in French as Ygraine (Old French Ygerne or Igerne), in &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; as Ygrayne—often modernised as Igraine or Igreine—and in &quot;Parzival&quot; as Arnive. She becomes the wife of Uther Pendragon, after the death of her first husband, Gorlois.

== Legend ==
In Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, Igerna enters the story as the wife of Gorlois, Duke of Cornwall. In Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, her daughters by Gorlois are Elaine, Morgause and Morgan le Fay. In other works, the names, roles and even number of Arthur&#x27;s half-sisters vary depending on the text (including none in the &quot;Historia&quot;, in which Arthur has only a younger sister). In the &quot;Brut Tysilio&quot;, Cador of Cornwall is their son. John Hardyng&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle&quot; calls Cador Arthur&#x27;s brother &quot;of his mother&#x27;s syde&quot;.

Geoffrey describes her as one &quot;whose beauty surpassed that of all the women of Britain.&quot; High King Uther Pendragon falls in love with her and attempts to force his attentions on her at his court. She informs her husband, who departs with her to Cornwall without asking leave. This sudden departure gives Uther Pendragon an excuse to make war on Gorlois. In Layamon&#x27;s &quot;Brut&quot;, Igraine &quot;was sorry and sorrowful at heart / that so many men should be lost for her&quot;.

Gorlois conducts the war from the castle of Dimilioc but places his wife in safety in Tintagel Castle. Disguised as Gorlois by Merlin, Uther Pendragon is able to enter Tintagel to satisfy his lust. He manages to rape Igraine by deceit – she believes that she is lying with her husband and becomes pregnant with Arthur. Her husband Gorlois dies in battle that same night. Geoffrey does not say, and later accounts disagree, as to whether Gorlois died before or after Arthur was begotten. Uther Pendragon later marries Igraine. Geoffrey says &quot;from that day on they lived together as equals, united by their great love for each other&quot;. Geoffrey does not indicate whether Igraine ever learned of Uther&#x27;s deception. Layamon says &quot;Uther greeted Ygaerne, noblest of wives, and sent her token what they had spoken in bed; he commanded her that she should give up the castle quickly – there was no other way, for her lord was dead.&quot;

Malory has Arthur, who had been raised by Sir Ector, meet his mother for the first time after he had grown to manhood and become king. According to Geoffrey, Igraine also bore a daughter to Uther Pendragon: Arthur&#x27;s full sister Anna, the future mother of Gawain and Mordred.
Igraine is indirectly mentioned several times in the 11th/12th-century Welsh text &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot; as the unnamed mother of Arthur. Culhwch is given as Arthur&#x27;s cousin, though it is not said whether this is through his father Cilydd (son of Celyddon) or his mother Goleuddydd (daughter of Amlawdd Wledig), nor whether through Igraine or Arthur&#x27;s father. &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot; lists several brothers of Arthur&#x27;s mother: Llysgadrudd Emys, Gwrbothu Hen, Gweir Gwrhyd Ennwir, and Gweir Paladyr Hir. It also says she had another son, Gormant, to Ricca, the chief elder of Cornwall. The 12th-century &quot;Life of St Illtud&quot; says Illtud was the son of Rieingulid (daughter of Amlawdd Wledig), and cousin to Arthur, reinforcing the connection between Igraine, Rieingulid, and Goleuddydd as three of the many children of Amlawdd Wledig, which was set out in later genealogies. When combined with the two previous sources, the &quot;Brut Dingestow&quot; suggests that Arthur&#x27;s mother was named Eigyr. Welsh genealogies list Eigyr&#x27;s mother as Gwen (daughter of Cunedda Wledig), and her father Amlawdd Wledig is made a descendant of Joseph of Arimathea&#x27;s sister Enigeus. Around 1400, Glastonbury monks modified the genealogies to make the Maimed King either Igraine&#x27;s grandfather or great-grandfather through Amlawdd Wledig.

In Robert de Boron&#x27;s poem &quot;Merlin&quot;, Igraine&#x27;s previous husband is an unnamed Duke of Tintagel and it is by him that she becomes the mother of two unnamed daughters. One marries King Lot and by him becomes the mother of Gawain, Mordred, Gaheriet, and Guerrehet. A second daughter, also unnamed in some variants but in some named Morgaine, is married to King Nentres of Garlot. According to Robert de Boron, Igraine died before her second husband. A third illegitimate daughter of the Duke of Tintagel is sent to a school and there learns so much, she becomes the great sorceress Morgan the Fairy (no other medieval accounts state that Morgan is illegitimate and therefore, as in this version, Arthur&#x27;s stepsister).

In the &quot;Lancelot-Grail&quot; cycle&#x27;s Vulgate &quot;Merlin&quot;, Igraine is provided with two earlier husbands, one named Hoel (Gorlois) who is the father of two daughters: Gawain&#x27;s mother and a daughter named Blasine who marries King Nentres of Garlot. After Hoel&#x27;s death, Ygraine marries the Duke of Tintagel and by him becomes mother of three more daughters: a third daughter who marries a King Briadas and becomes mother of King Angusel of Scotland (in no other extant text made Arthur&#x27;s nephew), a fourth daughter named Hermesent who marries King Urien of Rheged and becomes mother of Ywain the Great, and a fifth daughter, Morgan. In other accounts, Ywain is not Arthur&#x27;s nephew, although sometimes, he is Gawain&#x27;s cousin when their respective fathers are presented as brothers.

&quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; names the first daughter Margawse, the second Elayne and the third Morgan. Lancelot is the son of Arthur&#x27;s sister Clarine in Ulrich von Zatzikhoven&#x27;s &quot;Lanzelet&quot;, Caradoc is Arthur&#x27;s sister&#x27;s son in the Prose &quot;Lancelot&quot;, Percival is son of Arthur&#x27;s sister Acheflour in the English romance &quot;Syr Percyvelle&quot;. Arthurian tales are not consistent with one another and sisters of Arthur seem to have been created at desire by any storyteller who wished to make a hero into Arthur&#x27;s nephew. Richard Carew&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Cornwall&quot; (1602), drawing on earlier sources, mentions a sister of Arthur called Amy born to Igerna and Uther.

Some romances show her alive after Uther&#x27;s death. In Chrétien de Troyes&#x27; &quot;Perceval, the Story of the Grail&quot; she and her daughter, Gawain&#x27;s mother, are discovered by Gawain in an enchanted castle named the Castle of Marvels, after he had thought both his mother and grandmother to be long dead. This same account appears in Wolfram von Eschenbach&#x27;s &quot;Parzival&quot; and in Heinrich von dem Türlin&#x27;s &quot;Diu Crône&quot;. In both of these, it is explained that Igraine was abducted (and it is hinted that she was &quot;willingly&quot; abducted) by the magician who has enchanted the castle. In the French &quot;Livre d&#x27;Artus&quot;, an incomplete alternate conclusion to the French Vulgate &quot;Merlin&quot;, it is mentioned that Ygraine dwells hidden in Corbenic, the castle of the Holy Grail. This is apparently a version of the same tradition since in the late Lancelot-Grail, the enchantments of the Grail castle are very similar to and seem to be based on the enchantments found in Chrétien&#x27;s Castle of Marvels.

Bosigran promontory fort in Zennor parish, Cornwall, was suggested by Henry Jenner to mean . Jenner also noted the proximity of Bosigran to Bosworlas (in St Just parish) , who he believed was a real petty-chief in fifth or sixth-century Dumnonia.

==Modern fiction==
*Jack Whyte&#x27;s &quot;A Dream of Eagles&quot; portrays Igraine as the daughter of Athol, a ruler from Ireland. She is married off to Lot, the Duke of Cornwall and flees the cruel Lot for his arch enemy, Uther Pendragon. 
*In the BBC series &quot;Merlin&quot; (S02 E08: &quot;The Sins of the Father&quot;), Ygraine is the wife of Uther, but dead for many years by the time the events of the series begins. She could not conceive, and so Uther asked for the help of the sorceress Nimueh so that they could have a child. Igraine gives birth to Arthur, but because magic was invoked in his conception, Uther had to pay the price of asking for a life from magic—that of losing the life of someone he treasured equally, his wife. It is Igraine&#x27;s death that sparks Uther&#x27;s hatred and persecution of all magic users within his kingdom.
*In Guy Ritchie&#x27;s 2017 film &quot;King Arthur: Legend of the Sword&quot;, Poppy Delevingne plays Igraine, Uther&#x27;s wife.

<text>The Thuringian Forest (&quot;Thüringer Wald&quot; in German ) is a mountain range in the southern parts of the German state of Thuringia, running northwest to southeast. Skirting from its southerly source in foothills to a gorge on its north-west side is the Werra valley. On the other side of the Forest is an upper outcrop of the North German Plain, the Thuringian Basin, which includes the city Erfurt. The south and south-east continuation of the range is the highland often called the Thuringian-Vogtlandian Slate Mountains.

Among scattered foothills at its northern foot are the towns Eisenach, Gotha and Arnstadt. The towns of Ilmenau and Suhl sit in slight dips on the range itself to the north and south respectively.

== Geography and communications ==
The Thuringian Forest forms a continuous chain of ancient rounded mountains with steep slopes to both sides and poses ample difficulties in transit routing save through a few navigable passes. It is about long and wide. The highest elevation is &quot;Großer Beerberg&quot; at above sea level.

The &quot;Rennsteig&quot; (sometimes called &quot;Rennweg&quot;) is an ancient path following the main ridge and connecting the summits. It is now a famous hiking path and marks the traditional boundary between the hills-dominated terrain of central Germany and the more rugged terrain characteristic of southern Germany, and also the boundary between the cultural regions of central and north Thuringia and Franconia. Dialects and traditional customs and costumes are different on either side of the Rennsteig. The Rennsteig is the subject of the song &quot;Rennsteiglied (de)&quot;, the unofficial hymn of Thuringia.

Motorway A 4 passes north of the Thuringian Forest, while A 71, intersecting the former south of Erfurt, crosses the range from the northeast to the southwest, passes under the ridge in the Rennsteig Tunnel near Oberhof, and is joined near Suhl by A 73. Two more long-distance roads, &quot;Bundesstraßen&quot; 19 and 84, pass over the western parts of the range, while &quot;Bundesstraße&quot; 88 skirts the northern foothills between Eisenach and Geraberg.

The Neudietendorf–Ritschenhausen railway crosses the Thuringian Forest in Brandleite Tunnel between Gehlberg and Oberhof, the Werra Railway between Eisenach and Eisfeld does so in a tunnel near Förtha. Both are in daily operation. A third line, the southern section of the Plaue–Themar railway, does not use a tunnel, but crosses the mountain ridge at Rennsteig switchback station. It has only been used by museum trains since 1998. The Nuremberg–Erfurt high-speed railway, due to be commissioned in December 2017, crosses the Thuringian Forest with the help of several tunnels and bridges.

Thüringerwaldbahn, a cross-country line of the Gotha tramway network, serves the northern foothills of the Thuringian Forest between Gotha and Bad Tabarz, including a branch to Waltershausen.

== Geology ==
=== Overview ===

Geologically, the Thuringian Forest is defined by a belt of strongly uplifted and deformed metamorphic and igneous rock that divides the relatively flat sedimentary plains of the &quot;Thüringer Becken&quot; (to the northeast) from similar rock formations in the valley of the Werra (to the southwest). It consists of a large fault block in hercynian orientation, which consists from sandstones and conglomerates of Rotliegend age in its western parts (Eisenach trough), followed by granites and gneisses of the &quot;Ruhlaer Kristallin&quot; formation of early paleozoic origin which were uplifted in the Rotliegend era, and the conglomerates, sandstones, and abundant volcanic rocks (rhyolites and andesites) of the Oberhof trough. Ore deposits associated with the upthrust of the range have been of significant historical importance in the development of the region, for example, the metalworking tradition in Suhl and the mining history of Ilmenau.

The uplift of the horst-like fault block was part of the Saxonian tectonic processes and is understood as a long range effect of the Alpine orogeny. It began in the upper Cretaceous era and ended in the late Tertiary after about 40 million years.

Thuringian forest is surrounded on three sides by triassic rocks: the Thuringian Basin in the northeast, the Hesse Highlands in the west, and the northeastern parts of the South German Scarplands in the south, and by the Variscan rocks of the Thuringian Highland towards the east. The geological borders differ from the geographical ones insofar, as the Rotliegend rock of the Thuringian forest finds its continuation in the Masserberg and Crock block in Hildburghausen district, southeast of the main range, and the rock types of the Thuringian Highland are also found in the Schleuse horst between Schönbrunn reservoir and Schönau, and in the Vesser complex near Schmiedefeld, an island of Variscan rocks embedded in Rotliegend. While the near-surface rocks of the Thuringian Highland comprise mostly the folded Variscan basement, the oldest unfolded overlying strata (dating from the Permosilesian age) of this basement are exposed in the Thuringian forest. Common to both ranges, but also to other low mountain ranges in Central Europe uplifted at the same time, are the bordering Zechstein deposits which contain Bryozoa reefs. These stretch especially wide on the northwestern edge of the Thuringian forest, where the landscape park of Altenstein Palace is located on one of the largest Zechstein reefs in Germany.

=== Eisenach trough ===
The Eisenach trough is part of the much larger Werra basin, which in turn is part of the Saar-Unstrut depression of early Permian origin. It was uplifted as one of the fault blocks in the Saxonian tectonic era and is filled with Variscan molasses, named &quot;Eisenach formation&quot; after the location. It consists mostly of monotonous sequences of reddish conglomerates representing a proximal alluvial fan which originated in debris flows from the Ruhla anticline. Dated in the upper Rotliegend, the Eisenach formation consists of some of the youngest geological units in the Thuringian forest. The lack of volcanic rocks suggests that at the time of the deposition of the Eisenach formation, no significant tectonic processes took place in the Werra basin which was by then a mostly consolidated depositional environment.

=== Ruhla anticline ===

In the Ruhla anticline the basement rocks, folded in the Variscan era, are exposed. They are named &quot;Ruhlaer Kristallin&quot; after the location and are according to Franz Kossmat considered part of the Central German Crystalline Zone, of which Odenwald and Spessart are also constituents. In the Rotliegend era the region formed the crest of a mountain range where the debris originated that was deposited in the Eisenach trough and the northwestern part of the Oberhof trough.

The sedimentary, volcano-sedimentary, and magmatic rocks which were deposited or formed in the area from the Cambrian until the upper Devonian were subjected to intense metamorphosis during the Variscan uplift and are now mostly present in the form of gneiss or schist.

=== Oberhof trough ===

The Oberhof trough is by far the largest of the main geologic parts of the Thuringian Forest. It consists of the uplifted part of the so-called &quot;Thuringian Forest Basin&quot; whose contents can be further subdivided into several formations. Their relative ages have not been fully resolved yet, partly because the Oberhof trough had been a rift zone with intense tectonics and continual changes of the internal relief and of the main areas of deposition. The tectonic processes were accompanied by an intense felsitic volcanism which was the origin of many volcanic rock formations, predominantly rhyolites of porphyric structure with accompanying tuff deposits. These volcanic rocks alternate in sequence with the typical reddish molasse sediments (conglomerates, sandstones, siltstones, and claystones) of the Rotliegend.

=== Little Thuringian Forest ===

The Little Thuringian Forest (German: &quot;Kleiner Thüringer Wald&quot;) is a narrow horst south of Suhl and northwest of Schleusingen, northwest of Schleuse river, embedded in the Triassic foothills of Southern Thuringia. It is oriented roughly parallel to the Thuringian Forest and, while a separate structure, is geologically very similar to the latter, as it consists of the same rock types such as granite, hornfels, porphyrites, Rotliegend and Zechstein sediments, and thus forms part of the Variscan chain. It is about long and to wide, with an average altitude of 460 m. Mining for fluorite, baryte, and limonite has been attempted there on several occasions, but was given up as unprofitable due to difficult drainage. Large baryte deposits prospected in the 1950s have remained untouched.

=== Waltershausen Foothills ===

The Waltershausen foothills (German: &quot;Waltershäuser Vorberge&quot;) are a wooded chain of Buntsandstein hills immediately north of and parallel to the Thuringian Forest between Eisenach, Waltershausen, Friedrichroda, and Georgenthal. An outcrop of Muschelkalk rock can be found in their northern part, south of Waltershausen. They are generally regarded a part of the Thuringian Basin, but with numerous deeply eroded river valleys and the dense forestation they resemble very much the Thuringian Forest.

== Climate ==
The Thuringian Forest is located in the Central European transition zone between the Atlantic oceanic climate and the continental climate of Eastern Europe. Humid air arrives mainly from the west, so that the western slopes and the crest of the chain experience the highest levels of precipitation. While the exception of the northwestern part with its lower altitudes (650 mm), the yearly precipitation reaches about 1000 mm, in the higher parts up to about 1300 mm. In contrast, the leeward Thuringian Basin is one of the driest regions in Germany with only around 460 mm to 590 mm of precipitation per year. As the Thuringian Forest forms a barrier to the main weather currents, erosion is strong and has led to a more pronounced relief than in many other of the European low mountain chains.

The mean temperatures decrease with altitude:
While the Thuringian Basin experiences less than 100 days per year with temperatures below 0 °C, this number rises to more than 150 in the upper altitudes of the Thuringian Forest.

== Natural regions ==
=== Northwest Thuringian Forest ===

The Northwest Thuringian Forest comprises an area of about 70 km2 reaching heights up to , hardly exceeding those of the adjacent Buntsandstein forelands to the southwest, but exhibiting a much more pronounced relief. It stretches until &quot;Moosbach&quot; stream, a tributary or Erbstrom river, in the north east, and to Bundesstraße 19 in the east and south, which follows the upper reaches of Elte river between the villages of Wilhelmsthal and Etterwinden. The predominant rock species is &quot;Eisenacher Rotliegend&quot;, namely conglomerates and sandstones. The area is known for the so-called &quot;Drachenschlucht&quot;, a narrow gorge near Eisenach, and the Wartburg castle. The northern part of the area is drained by several streams into the Hörsel, the southern part into the Elte. Hence, the ridge of the Northwestern Thuringian Forest only forms the watershed between Hörsel and the middle course of the Werra.

Notable summits include:
* Großer Drachenstein (470 m)
* Wartberg (about 390 m, north of the main ridge), site of Wartburg castle

The much larger natural region of Central Thuringian Forest with an area of about 850 km2, whose ridge rises mostly above , is subdivided into several parts described below in their sequence from the north-west to the south-east.

=== Ruhla Thuringian Forest ===

This part, situated around the town of Ruhla north of the &quot;Rennsteig&quot;, is geologically formed by the basement rocks of the &quot;Ruhlaer Kristallin&quot;, consisting of granites, gneiss, and schist. There is no pronounced ridge, summits on both sides of the watershed reach heights of or more. Its northeastern parts drain towards the Hörsel, the southwestern parts towards the middle course of the Werra. The area is limited towards the south-east by state road 1027 between Schwarzhausen and Bad Liebenstein.

Notable summits include:
* Birkenheide (717 m, immediately south of Rennsteig)
* Glöckner (702 m)
* Windsberg (671 m), foothill of Birkenheide and site of Altenstein castle
* Ringberg (639 m) with &quot;Alexanderturm&quot; (observation tower)

=== Brotterode Thuringian Forest ===

Reaching until Tambach-Dietharz, the part of Thuringian forest around the town of Brotterode is geologically more heterogeneous than the region around Ruhla. State road 1026 between Friedrichroda and Floh-Seligenthal which follows the valleys of the rivers Schilfwasser and Schmalkalde and passes through Kleinschmalkalden and state road 1028 between Georgenthal and Floh-Seligenthal which follows the valleys of the rivers Apfelstädt and Flohbach divide the area into segments. In this area the mountain ridge becomes more pronounced. The summit of Großer Inselsberg of volcanic origin causes a marked shift of the ridge towards the north. South of Georgenthal, the mountain range becomes the watershed between Elbe and Weser.

Notable summits include:

* Großer Inselsberg (916.5 m) between Brotterode and Tabarz, popular tourist destination
* Großer Weißenberg (747 m), location of a tripoint between the former countries of Saxe-Meiningen, Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and Kurhessen and of today&#x27;s districts Gotha, Schmalkalden-Meiningen, and Wartburgkreis.
* Gerberstein (728 m) with an outlook platform

=== Tambach-Oberhof Thuringian Forest ===

The B 247 from Luisenthal via Oberhof and Zella-Mehlis to Suhl, which follows the Ohra to the north, a section along the Lichtenau to the south and finally the lower reaches of the Mühlwasser, together with the slightly more than 10 km long L 1028 road that runs parallel to it to the northwest separates this natural sub-division of the Thuringian Forest from the rest. Apart from the south, this region is traversed by very few public roads and is only populated in the south – in the villages of Schnellbach and Struth-Helmershof in the municipality of Floh-Seligenthal, the Rotterode, Unterschönau and Oberschönau suburbs of Steinbach-Hallenberg and the town of Zella-Mehlis.

The Elbe-Weser watershed, accompanied by the &quot;Rennsteig&quot;, reaches heights of around 900 m at several places southwest to west of Oberhof, but does not really form any individual mountains and has very much the character of a mountain crest. By contrast, the Großer Hermannsberg and Ruppberg (see below) that rise to the southwest of the ridge are better known and popular tourist destinations. To the northeast, where the terrain gradually flattens out, are two of the 3 largest reservoirs in the Thuringian Forest (see below). The best known rock formation in the mountain range, the Falkenstein, is also found in this area.

Notable summits include:

* Schützenberg (904 m, main crest southwest of Oberhof)
* Greifenberg (901 m, main crest west of Oberhof)
* Gebrannter Stein (897 m, south of the Rennsteig, north of Zella-Mehlis) with remarkable cliffs
* Großer Hermannsberg (867 m, southwest flank) - local mountain for Steinbach-Hallenberg, with observation tower
* Ruppberg (866 m, southwest flank) - local mountain (northwest) for Zella-Mehlis, with observation tower

==== Rivers and lakes ====

The northeastern flank of the mountains is drained by right tributaries of the Apfelstädt, especially the Schmalwasser, and left tributaries of the Ohra, notably the Kernwasser, via the (Apfelstädt,) Gera and Unstrut into the Saale. The Apfelstädt is impounded by the Tambach-Dietharz Dam into a small lake and the Schmalwasser and Ohra by the Schmalwasser and Ohra Dams into larger reservoirs.

The south is drained by the Asbach which flows via the Stille into the Schmalkalde and by rivers and streams belonging to the fan-like system of tributaries of Hasel (Werra), in particular the Schwarza, &quot;Häselbach&quot;, Lichtenau and a stream from Albrechts, feeding into the Werra.

=== Gehlberg Thuringian Forest ===

This region between federal roads B 4 between Ilmenau and Stützerbach, following the rivers Ilm, Lengwitz, and Nahe, and B 247 between Luisenthal and Suhl contains the three highest summits as well as the fifth highest summit of the whole range. The only settlements wholly within this region are Gehlberg north of Rennsteig and Vesser south of it. Parts of Schmiedefeld and Goldlauter-Heidersbach (part of Suhl) also extend into this part of the Forest. The highest summits crowning the mountain ridge are of volcanic origin. The terrain dips rapidly down to heights below 800 m towards the north-east, while heights remain above this altitude south-west of Rennsteig for some distance in the horseshoe-shaped Adlersberg massif.

Motorway A 71 and the Neudietendorf–Ritschenhausen railway pass under the Brandleite Massif between Gehlberg and Oberhof in Rennsteig road tunnel and Brandleite Tunnel.

The area is drained towards the north by the river Lütsche which feeds the Lütsche reservoir and by Wilde Gera and Zahme Gera towards Gera river and Unstrut, and by Freibach stream, a tributary of Ilm river, and towards the south by Lauter, a tributary of Hasel, and mainly by Erle, feeding the Erle reservoir, Breitenbach, Vesser, and Nahe into Schleuse.

Notable summits include:
* Großer Beerberg (984 m, main crest 3,4 km east of Zella-Mehlis, highest elevation in the Thuringian Forest)
* Schneekopf (978 m), transmitter site and observation tower
* Großer Finsterberg (944 m), with observation tower
* Großer Eisenberg (907 m), whose name bears witness to ore mining activities in the past
* Adlersberg massive (up to 892 m) with Ringberghaus hotel on Ringberg (746 m), a northwestern foothill

=== Frauenwald-Neustadt Thuringian Forest ===
The region around Frauenwald and Neustadt forms the most south-eastern part of the Thuringian forest proper. It is limited by state road B 4 in the northwest, and by a line along the rivers Talwasser (with Ilmsenbach), Neubrunn, and Schleuse. The adjacent Thuringian Slate Mountains form a geographically and geologically separate natural region, although they are often popularly referred to as a continuation of the former range. Populated places wholly within the region are Frauenwald, Allzunah, Neustadt am Rennsteig, and Oehrenstock. Parts of Stützerbach also reach into this area. Roads follow the &quot;Rennsteig&quot;, the mountain crests, or the valleys of the rivers.

The main ridge of the mountain range exceeds altitudes of 800 m in several places. The highest and best known summit is Kickelhahn (861 metres above sea level) southwest of Ilmenau. As seen from there, all secondary crests towards the northeast and the southwest clearly originate from the main one and show even and gentle slopes, not counting the steep descent into the foreland. The southwestern crests reach altitudes of about 800 m. The dividing valleys are often narrow gorges.

The zone drains:
*Northeast by the fan of the Ilm&#x27;s tributaries, towards the Saale
*Southwest by the Nahe, Trenkbach, Schleuse, Gabel, Tanne, and tributaries of the Neubrunn towards the Werra.

The Schleuse, Gabel and Tanne feed the Schönbrunn reservoir.

Notable summits include:
* Kickelhahn (861 m) with observation tower, &quot;backyard mountain&quot; of Ilmenau
* Großer Dreiherrnstein (838 m), 500 m from the tripoint of the former countries Schwarzburg-Arnstadt, Saxe-Eisenach, and Henneberg
* Großer Hundskopf (824 m) with a transmitter site on its foothill Kalter Staudenkopf (768 m)

== Tourism and sights ==
Due to its geographical characteristics and the favourable climate, the Thuringian Forest is an important year-round tourist destination. Winter sports play an important role, facilities of international significance are concentrated around Oberhof. Famous sights include Wartburg Castle outside Eisenach where Martin Luther lived in exile, the selenite cave (&quot;Marienglashöhle&quot;, a former mine) near Friedrichroda, the firearms museum in Suhl, and the historic town centres of Eisenach and Ilmenau.

The Rennsteig trail is the most popular long-distance hiking trail in Germany. It is part of:
*the mountainous path from Eisenach to Budapest
*the E3 European long distance path
*the &quot;Thüringen-Rhein-Wanderweg&quot;
*(partly) the pilgrims&#x27; way &quot;or Via Porta&quot;. The latter links the abbeys of Volkenroda and Waldsassen.

<text>Salzwedel (, officially known as Hansestadt Salzwedel; Low German: &quot;Soltwedel&quot;) is a town in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. It is the capital of the district (&quot;Kreis&quot;) of Altmarkkreis Salzwedel, and has a population of approximately 21,500. Salzwedel is located on the German Timber-Frame Road.

==Geography==
Salzwedel is situated at the river Jeetze in the northwestern part of the Altmark. It is located between Hamburg and Magdeburg. Distances from Uelzen are E, S of Lüchow, N of Gardelegen and W of Arendsee. In 1968 test drillings revealed a significant reservoir of natural gas near the city.

=== Divisions ===
The town Salzwedel consists of Salzwedel proper and the following &quot;Ortschaften&quot; or municipal divisions:

*Andorf
*Barnebeck
*Brietz
*Chüden
*Dambeck
*Henningen
*Klein Gartz
*Langenapel
*Liesten
*Mahlsdorf
*Osterwohle
*Pretzier
*Riebau
*Seebenau
*Stappenbeck
*Steinitz
*Tylsen
==History==
The castle of Salzwedel in the Altmark was first documented in 1112. As part of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, the settlement was first mentioned as a town in 1233. To the northeast of the old town (&quot;Altstadt&quot;), a new town (&quot;Neustadt&quot;) began development in 1247. In the Middle Ages Salzwedel belonged to the Hanseatic League from 1263 to 1518. As to religion Salzwedel belonged to the Diocese of Verden (till 1648).

The city from 1247 began developing as a reestablishment from the old part of the town. In 1701 it became part of the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1713, the two towns Altstadt and Neustadt became one. Salzwedel became part of the Prussian Province of Saxony in 1815 after the Napoleonic Wars. In 1870 it received a railroad connection. The medieval part of the town remains the commercial and administrative center of the town until today.

As in other German cities and towns during the time of Nazi Germany, the Jewish residents of the city were systematically deprived of their rights, then expelled from the city. Salzwedel was hit by five air raids from 1942-1945, and more than 300 people lost their lives, especially on 22 February 1945.

In 1943, the Neuengamme concentration camp built a female subcamp in Salzwedel, capable of holding more than 1,000 female prisoners. Eventually more than 3,000 women were held there, both Jews and non-Jews. The guard staff at the camp included sixty SS men and women. One Aufseherin is known today by name, Lieselotte Darnstaedt, who was born in 1908. Darnstaedt also served at Ravensbrück before coming to Salzwedel. On April 14, 1945, the US Army liberated the Salzwedel women&#x27;s subcamp, and also a men&#x27;s camp nearby for male non-German political prisoners. They were shocked to find more than ninety corpses of women who had died of typhus, dysentery and malaria. At the beginning of 1945, prior to the arrival of American ground forces, Allied war planes attacked the main train station of Salzwedel, killing 300 people. The US Army eventually turned over control of the city to the Soviet Red Army, causing Salzwedel to become part of the German Democratic Republic.

On November 9, 1989 the East-West German border crossing near Salzwedel was opened, along with East-West border crossings in the rest of the country, allowing East Germans residing in Salzwedel and elsewhere to travel freely to West Germany for the first time since the building of the Berlin Wall. In 1990 Salzwedel received its first democratically elected city government.

The official name of the city was changed into &quot;Hansestadt Salzwedel&quot; on 1 April 2008, in reference to its history as a member of the Hanseatic League.

In January 2003 the town incorporated the former municipalities Brietz, Dambeck and Mahlsdorf, in January 2009 Benkendorf, in January 2010 Chüden, Klein Gartz, Langenapel, Liesten, Osterwohle, Pretzier, Riebau, Seebenau and Tylsen, and in January 2011 Steinitz and Wieblitz-Eversdorf.

<text>Altmarkkreis Salzwedel is a district in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. It is bounded by (from the west and clockwise) the districts Gifhorn, Uelzen, Lüchow-Dannenberg in Lower Saxony, and the districts of Stendal and Börde (district).

== History ==
The Altmark is a historical region that covers the territory of this district as well as parts of the neighbouring district of Stendal. In the 10th century AD, it was the eastern border province of the Holy Roman Empire; castles were built here in order to move the borders eastwards. The Altmark was a swampy and heavily contested region for centuries. In the 12th century, many swamps were drained, and the strongholds became small towns. In the Late Middle Ages, many towns were members of the Hanseatic League. Due to the Thirty Years&#x27; War the Altmark was completely devastated in the 17th century. It never regained its importance and remains sparsely populated to date.

The district was established in 1994 by merging the former districts of Gardelegen, Klötze, Salzwedel and (partially) Osterburg.

== Geography ==
The area of the district is . The Altmark is a plain countryside, which once was full of fens and ponds. Today it is mainly covered with forests and heaths. It is generally dry, although some swampy regions survived. The largest of those is the Drömling, a large wetland in the southwest, which is a nature park shared with the neighbouring Börde (district).

The largest lake of the district is the Arendsee (5.54 km2); the town of Arendsee is named after this lake.

== Coat of arms ==
The coat of arms displays:
* The heraldic eagle of Brandenburg, which was also part of the arms of Salzwedel
* The lion of Lüneburg, since the town of Klötze belonged to the duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg in medieval times
* The symbol of the Altmark, that was used during the 11th and 12th centuries

==Towns and municipalities==

The district Altmarkkreis Salzwedel consists of the following subdivisions:

<text>Domitius Marsus (; died 15 BC) was a Latin poet, friend of Virgil and Tibullus, and contemporary of Horace.

He survived Tibullus (died 19 BC), but was no longer alive when Ovid wrote (&quot;c&quot;. 12 AD) the epistle from Pontus (&quot;Ex Ponto&quot;, iv. 16) containing a list of poets. He was the author of a collection of epigrams called &quot;Cicuta&quot; (&quot;hemlock&quot;) for their bitter sarcasm, and of a beautiful epitaph on the death of Tibullus; of elegiac poems, probably of an erotic character; of an epic poem &quot;Amazonis&quot;; and of a prose work on wit (&quot;De urbanitate&quot;).

Martial often alluded to Marsus as one of his predecessors, but he was never mentioned by Horace, although a passage in the &quot;Odes&quot; (iv. 4, 19) is supposed to be an indirect allusion to the &quot;Amazonis&quot;.

<text>Bothel is a municipality in the district of Rotenburg, Germany in the Stade Geest region of central Lower Saxony. It has 2,500 inhabitants. Bothel was founded by workers of the nearby &quot;Trochel Forest&quot;. The name developed from &quot;Borstel&quot; which is Old Saxon and means &quot;little woods&quot;.

Bothel belonged to the Prince-Bishopric of Verden, established in 1180. In 1648 the Prince-Bishopric was transformed into the Principality of Verden, which was first ruled in personal union by the Swedish Crown – interrupted by a Danish occupation (1712–1715) – and from 1715 on by the Hanoverian Crown. In 1807 the ephemeric Kingdom of Westphalia annexed the Principality, before France annexed it in 1810. In 1813 the Principality was restored to the Electorate of Hanover, which – after its upgrade to the Kingdom of Hanover in 1814 – incorporated the Principality in a real union and the Princely territory, including Bothel, became part of the new Stade Region, established in 1823.

Today the community has an old town part with typical Low Saxon farm houses and a modern center with town hall, schools and shopping facilities. So Bothel is important for the surrounding villages.

Bothel is also the seat of the &quot;Samtgemeinde&quot; (&quot;collective municipality&quot;) Bothel.

<text>:&quot;See German tanker Altmark for the ship named after Altmark and Stary Targ for the Polish village named Altmark in German.&quot;

The Altmark (; English: Old March) is a historic region in Germany, comprising the northern third of Saxony-Anhalt. As the initial territory of the March of Brandenburg, it is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Cradle of Prussia&quot;, as by Otto von Bismarck, a native of Schönhausen near Stendal.

== Geography ==

The Altmark is located west of the Elbe river between the cities of Hamburg and Magdeburg, mostly included in the districts of Altmarkkreis Salzwedel and Stendal. In the west, the Drawehn hill range and the Drömling depression separate it from the Lüneburg Heath in Lower Saxony; the Altmark also borders the Wendland region in the north and the Magdeburg Börde in the south. Adjacent east of the Elbe is the historical Prignitz region.

The population is small. The cultural landscape within the North European Plain is rural and widely covered with forests and heathlands. The largest towns are Stendal, with a population of 39,000, and Salzwedel (21,500).

== History ==
Before the Migration Period of 300 to 700 AD, the Lombards had settled the future Altmark. Subsequently, Old Germanic Saxon tribes lived in the northwest and Polabian Slavs in the eastern territories along the Elbe. After the Saxon Wars, waged by Charlemagne from 772 to 804, the lands became part of the Carolingian Empire. They formed part of the Eastphalian territory of the Duchy of Saxony, which, from 843 onwards, constituted the eastern borderlands of East Francia under Louis the German. The bishops of Verden and of Halberstadt promoted the Christianisation of the Saxon population.

In 936 the German king Otto I allotted the territory of the later Altmark to the Saxon Count Gero, in order to subdue the West Slavic Wends settling on the Elbe. Gero thereafter campaigned in the Slavic lands far beyond the river Elbe and thereafter established the Saxon stretching up to the Oder in the east. Upon Gero&#x27;s death in 965, his was split and the Northern March was granted to Dietrich of Haldensleben, who nevertheless turned out to be an incapable ruler and lost all the territories east of the Elbe in the Slavic Lutici uprising of 983. He retained only his margravial title and the initial land basis of his predecessor Gero&#x27;s conquests west of the river.

For more than one and a half centuries, the lands east of the Elbe defied German control, until in 1134 Emperor Lothair of Supplinburg bestowed the Northern March on the Ascanian count Albert the Bear. Albert signed an inheritance contract with the Slavic Hevelli prince Pribislav and in 1150 succeeded him in his eastern territory around the fortress of Brandenburg an der Havel, which became the nucleus of his newly established Margraviate of Brandenburg in 1157. 

As the Brandenburg margraves expanded their territory during the course of the , the original western territory of the Northern March became known as the Altmark (literally &quot;Old March&quot;) in contrast to the (Middle March) and (New March) beyond the Oder river; the written record first mentions it in 1304 as .

As part of Brandenburg, from 1415 held by the House of Hohenzollern, the Altmark became part of Brandenburg-Prussia and (from 1701) of the Kingdom of Prussia. After Prussia&#x27;s defeat at the hands of Napoleon in 1806, the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit (1807) assigned the territory of the Altmark to the new Kingdom of Westphalia. Prussia regained the area upon Napoleon&#x27;s defeat (per Article XXIII of the Final Act of the Congress of Vienna, 1815); however, it was incorporated into the new Prussian Province of Saxony rather than being attached to the Province of Brandenburg. Within Prussian Saxony, the Altmark was subdivided into the districts of Salzwedel, Gardelegen, Osterburg, and Stendal, all administered within the of Magdeburg.

After World War II the Altmark, lying to the east of the inner German border, became part of the new state of Saxony-Anhalt in the Soviet occupation zone. The regional administration of East Germany saw it administered within from 1952 to 1990. With German reunification in 1990, the Altmark became part of a reconstituted Saxony-Anhalt.

== Rivers and lakes ==

The region is drained by the Elbe, joined by the Havel at Havelberg, and its left tributaries of the Milde-Biese-Aland system and the Jeetzel river.

The largest natural lake of the Altmark is the Arendsee.

== Transport ==

=== Road ===
The Altmark is located off the main traffic routes. The Bundesautobahn 14 leads to the Bundesautobahn 2 from Hanover to Berlin, it however ends north of Magdeburg. A continuation through the Altmark towards Schwerin is planned. Beside which the Federal roads B71, B107, B188, B189, B190, B248 run through the region.

<doc id="162243" wikidata="Q140147" url="?curid=162243" title="Brest, Belarus">
<text>Brest, formerly Brest-Litovsk and Brest-on-the-Bug, Berestia, is a city in south-western Belarus at the border with Poland opposite the Polish town of Terespol, where the Bug and Mukhavets rivers meet, making it a border town. It serves as the administrative center of Brest Region and Brest District, though it is administratively separated from the district. it has a population of 344,470.

Brest is one of the oldest cities in Belarus and a historical site for many cultures, as it hosted important historical events, such as the Union of Brest and Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Furthermore, the Brest Fortress was recognized by the Soviet Union as a Hero Fortress in honour of the defense of Brest Fortress in June 1941.

In the High Middle Ages, the city often passed between Poland, the principalities of Kievan Rus&#x27;, and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. From the Late Middle Ages, the city was part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which later became a part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from 1569. In 1795, it was incorporated into the Russian Empire with the Third Partition of Poland. After the Polish-Soviet War, the city became part of the Second Polish Republic. In 1939, the city was captured by Nazi Germany during the invasion of Poland and then transferred to the Soviet Union per the German–Soviet Frontier Treaty. In 1941, it was retaken by the Germans during Operation Barbarossa. In 1944, it was retaken by the Soviet Red Army during the Lublin–Brest offensive. The city was part of the Byelorussian SSR until the breakup of the USSR in 1991. Since then, Brest has been part of independent Belarus.

==Etymology==
Several theories attempt to explain the origin of the city&#x27;s name. The name could originate from Slavic root &quot;berest&quot; &#x27;elm&#x27;. It could likewise have come from the Lithuanian word &quot;brasta&quot; &#x27;ford&#x27;.

Traditionally, Belarusian speakers called the city (), similar to the Ukrainian name ().

Once a center of Jewish scholarship, the city has the Yiddish name (), hence the term &quot;Brisker&quot; used to describe followers of the influential Soloveitchik family of rabbis.

Brest became a part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1319. In the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth formed in 1569, the town became known in Polish as , historically (literally: &quot;Lithuanian Brest&quot;, in contradistinction to Brześć Kujawski). became part of the Russian Empire under the name or (, , literally &quot;Lithuanian Brest&quot;) in the course of the Third Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795. After World War I, and the rebirth of Poland in 1918, the government of the Second Polish Republic renamed the city as (&quot;Brest on the Bug&quot;) on 20 March 1923. After World War II, the city became part of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic with the name simplified as Brest.

Brest&#x27;s coat of arms, adopted on 26 January 1991, features an arrow pointed upwards and a bow (both silver) on a sky-blue shield. An alternative coat of arms has a red shield. Sigismund II Augustus, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, first granted Brest a coat of arms in 1554.

==History==

As a town, Brest – &quot;Berestij&quot; in Kievan Rus – was first mentioned in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; in 1019 when the Kievan Rus&#x27; took the stronghold from the Poles. It is one of the oldest cities in Belarus. It was hotly contested between the Polish rulers (kings, principal dukes and dukes of Masovia) and Kievan Rus princes. It was recaptured by Poland in 1020, and unsuccessfully besieged by Prince Yaroslav the Wise of Kiev in 1022. It was captured by Yaroslav the Wise, according to various sources, either in 1042 or 1044, then by 1076 recaptured by King Bolesław II the Bold of Poland, but then lost again by his successor Władysław I Herman. Afterwards, it often passed between the principalities of Turov and Volhynia. In 1164, it was briefly captured by Lithuanians. In 1178, it was captured by Casimir II the Just of Poland, and made the seat of his fraternal nephew Leszek, Duke of Masovia, who, however, soon lost it to the Principality of Minsk. In 1182, Casimir II the Just captured the city once again, and built a castle there, and then granted it as a fief to his sororal nephew Roman the Great the following year. From 1199 it was ruled by the Principality of Galicia–Volhynia, remaining under Polish suzerainty until 1205, when Roman the Great rebelled against Poland, but was killed in action in the Battle of Zawichost. Passing under Polish suzerainty again, in 1207, it was granted by Leszek the White as a fief to Princess Anna-Euphrosyne and her children. From 1210, it was directly part of Poland, until it passed to Galicia–Volhynia either in 1215 or 1217. In 1220, it passed to the Principality of Pinsk as a fief of Galicia–Volhynia. It was laid waste by the Mongols in 1241, and was not rebuilt until 1275. Possibly since the 1270s, the city was contested by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia.

===Grand Duchy of Lithuania===
In 1319, the city became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and Grand Duke Gediminas stayed in the city in the winter of 1319–1320, preparing to capture Kyiv. In 1349, it was captured by King Casimir III of Poland, however, it was restored to Lithuania in 1352. Its suburbs were burned by the Teutonic Order in 1379. In 1385, it became part of the Polish–Lithuanian union. During the Lithuanian Civil War (1389–1392), in 1390, the city was captured by Polish forces of Władysław II Jagiełło.

In 1390, Brześć became the second city in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (after the capital Vilnius), and the first in the lands that now are Belarus, to receive Magdeburg rights. Given its proximity to Poland, it was a significant centre for trade with Poland.

In 1409 it was a meeting place of King Władysław II Jagiełło, Grand Duke Vytautas the Great and Khan Jalal al-Din Khan ibn Tokhtamysh under the Polish Deputy Chancellor Mikołaj Trąba&#x27;s initiative, to prepare for war with the Teutonic Knights, which resulted in the Tatars aiding Poland and Lithuania in the Battle of Grunwald the following year. In 1410 the city mustered a cavalry banner that participated in the Polish-Lithuanian military victory at Grunwald.

In 1419 it became a seat of the starost in the newly created Trakai Voivodeship. Under Władysław II and Vytautas the city was significantly developed and granted privileges similar to those of the Polish city of Lublin. In 1425, the city hosted a congress attended by Władysław II, Vytautas, dukes of Masovia and Polish and Lithuanian nobles. In 1440, a Sejm of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was held in the city, at which Casimir IV Jagiellon was chosen Grand Duke of Lithuania. In 1446, a meeting of Casimir IV, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, and Polish senators regarding the political affiliation of Volhynia took place in the city, and in 1454 Casimir IV met with Lithuanian nobility to convince them to participate in the Polish–Teutonic War on the side of Poland.

===Polish—Lithuanian Commonwealth===

In 1500, it was burned again by Crimean Tatars. From 1513, the city was administratively located in the Podlaskie Voivodeship. In 1563, the Brest Bible, the second complete Bible translation into Polish and the first such Protestant translation, was published in the city. In 1566, following the decree of Sigismund II Augustus, a new voivodeship was created – Brest Litovsk Voivodeship.

During the union of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Swedish Empire under king Sigismund III Vasa (Polish–Swedish union), diets were held there. In 1594 and 1596, it was the meeting-place of two remarkable councils of regional bishops of the Roman-Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church. The 1596 council established the Uniate Church (also known as the Belarusian Greek Catholic Church in Belarus and Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in Ukraine). A Sejm of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was held in the city in 1653. A royal mint was founded in the city by King John II Casimir Vasa in 1665.

In 1657, and again in 1706, the town and castle were captured by the Swedish Army during its invasions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Then, in an attack from the other direction, on 13 January 1660, the invading Streltsy of the Tsardom of Russia under Ivan Andreyevich Khovansky took the Brest Castle in an early morning surprise attack, the town having been captured earlier, and massacred the 1,700 defenders and their families (according to an Austrian observer, Captain Rosestein).

====Partitions====
On 23 July 1792, the defending Grand Ducal Lithuanian Army, under the leadership of Szymon Zabiełło, and the invading Imperial Russian Army fought a battle near Brześć. On 19 September 1794, the area between Brest and Terespol was the site of another battle won by the Russian invaders led by Alexander Suvorov over a Polish-Lithuanian division under General Karol Sierakowski. Thereafter, Brest was annexed by Russia when the Poland-Lithuania Commonwealth was partitioned for the third time in 1795.

===19th century to World War I===

During Russian rule in the 19th century, Brest Fortress was built in and around the city. The Russians demolished the Polish Royal Castle and most Old Town &quot;to make room&quot; for the fortress. The main Jewish synagogue in the city, the Choral Synagogue, was completed c. 1862. In 1895, a massive fire rendered 15,000 people homeless, and dozens were killed.

During World War I, the town was captured by the Imperial German Army under August von Mackensen on 25 August 1915, during the Great Retreat of 1915. Shortly after Brest fell into German hands, war poet August Stramm, who has been called &quot;the first of the Expressionists&quot; and one of &quot;the most innovative poets of the First World War,&quot; was shot in the head during an attack on nearby Russian positions on 1 September 1915.
In March 1918, in the Brest Fortress at the confluence of the Bug and Mukhavets rivers on the city&#x27; western outskirts, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed, ending the war between Soviet Russia and the Central Powers and transferring the city and its surrounding region to the sphere of influence of the German Empire. This treaty was subsequently annulled by the Paris Peace Conference treaties which ended the war and even more so by events and developments in Central and Eastern Europe. During 1918, the city became a part of the Volhynia Governorate of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic as a result of negotiations and own treaty between the delegation of the Ukrainian Central Rada and Central Powers.

===Interwar Poland===
On 9 February 1919, Polish troops entered the city, and it returned to Poland, which regained independence three months earlier. During the Polish–Soviet War it was occupied by the Soviet Russians on 1 August 1920, and recaptured by the Poles on 20 August, with borders formally recognized by the Treaty of Riga of 1921. In 1921, it became the temporary capital of the Polesie Voivodeship instead of Pińsk. It was renamed Brześć nad Bugiem (&quot;Brest on the Bug&quot;) on 20 March 1923.
The city was developed significantly and a number of representative public buildings were erected in Neoclassical and Modernist styles, especially at &quot;Ulica Unii Lubelskiej&quot; (Union of Lublin Street, now Lenin Street), including the Bank of Poland, Tax Chamber, Regional Chamber of the State Control, Healthcare Fund and Voivodeship Office. Other notable projects include the officials&#x27; housing estate, stylistically inspired by historic manor houses of Polish nobility and the garden city movement, and the Warburg Residential Colony, dedicated to poor Jews who had lost their homes in World War I, founded by Felix M. Warburg, chairman of the Joint Distribution Committee of American Funds for Jewish War Sufferers. In 1929, city limits were greatly expanded.

In the twenty years of Poland&#x27;s sovereignty, of the total of 36 brand new schools established in the city, there were ten public, and five private Jewish schools inaugurated, with Yiddish and Hebrew as the language of instruction. The first-ever Jewish school in Brześć history opened in 1920, almost immediately after Poland&#x27;s return to independence. In 1936 Jews constituted 41.3% of the Brześć population or 21,518 citizens. Some 80.3% of private enterprises were run by Jews. The Polish Army troops of the 9th Military District along with its headquarters were stationed in Brześć Fortress.

The city had an overwhelmingly Jewish population in the Russian Partition: 30,000 out of 45,000 total population according to Russian 1897 census, which fell to 21,000 out of 50,000 according to the Polish census of 1931.

===World War II===
In early September 1939, the Polish government evacuated a portion of the Polish gold reserve from Warsaw to Brześć, and then further southeast to Śniatyn at the Poland-Romania border, from where it was transported via Romania and Turkey to territory controlled by Polish-allied France.

During the German Invasion of Poland in 1939, the city was defended by a small garrison of four infantry battalions under General Konstanty Plisowski against General Heinz Guderian&#x27;s XIX Panzer Corps. After four days of heavy fighting, the Polish forces withdrew southwards on 17 September. The Soviet invasion of Poland began on the same day. As a result, the Soviet Red Army entered the city at the end of September 1939 following the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact&#x27;s Secret Protocol, and a joint Nazi-Soviet military parade took place on 22 September 1939. While Belarusians consider it a reunification of the Belarusian nation under one constituency (the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic at that time), Poles consider it the date when the city was lost.

During the Soviet occupation (1939–41), the Polish population was subject to arrests, executions and mass deportations to Siberia and the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic. The largest Soviet prison in the Byelorussian SSR was located in the city, and its prisoners were mostly Poles, including politicians, landowners, officers, educators, priests, both locals, including pre-war Polish mayor Franciszek Kolbusz, and people arrested in other places, including former Prime Minister of Poland Leopold Skulski, and Jews fleeing the Germans from western and central Poland. The prison had poor conditions, causing the spread of lice and bed bugs, and brutal interrogations, even resulting in two confirmed cases of suicide. In February 1940, there was a mass prison escape in which first 28 people managed to escape, and then Soviet soldiers opened fire on further escapees. Many prisoners were eventually moved to a prison in Minsk. It is suspected that they were murdered by the Soviets in the Katyn massacre in 1940.

On 22 June 1941, Brest Fortress and the city were attacked by Nazi Germany on the first day of Operation Barbarossa, Nazi Germany&#x27;s invasion of the Soviet Union. The fortress held out for six days. Nearly all its Soviet army defenders perished. The Germans placed Brest under the administration of the &quot;Reichskommissariat Ukraine&quot;. The remaining municipal Jewish population (about 20,000) was sequestered in the Brześć Ghetto established by the German authorities in December 1941 and later murdered in October 1942. Only seven Jews survived the Nazi executions.

The Germans also operated a Nazi prison, a forced labour &quot;education&quot; camp for men and women, a forced labour camp for Jews, the AGSSt 3 prisoner-of-war assembly center, the Dulag 314 transit POW camp for Italians, the Stalag 397 POW camp for Soviet POWs and a subcamp of the Stalag 360 POW camp in the city.

The Polish resistance movement, including the Polesie District of the Home Army, was active in the city.

The city was re-occupied by the Red Army on 28 July 1944, and eventually annexed from Poland the following year.

===Post-war period===
In 1945, the &quot;Związek Obrońców Wolności&quot; (&quot;Freedom Defenders Association&quot;) Polish resistance organization was founded in the city, with its activities including secret Polish schooling, rescuing historical Polish monuments from devastation and organising aid for repressed people and those in a difficult material situation. The organization was crushed by the NKVD in 1948, and its members were deported to Gulag forced labour camps for 25 years.

In early 2019, a mass grave containing the remains of 1,214 people were found in the Brest Ghetto area during a construction project. Most are believed to have been Jews murdered by Nazis.

==Geography==
Brest lies astride the Mukhavets River which flows west through the city, dividing it into north and south, and meets the Bug River in the Brest Fortress. The river flows slowly and gently. Today the river looks quite broad in Brest. The terrain is fairly flat around Brest. The river has an extremely broad floodplain, that is about across. Brest was subject to flooding in the past. One of the worst floods in recorded history occurred in 1974.

Part of the floodplain was reclaimed with hydraulic mining. In the 1980s, big cutter-suction dredgers mined sand and clay from the riverbed to build up the banks.

In the 2000s, two new residential areas were developed in the southwest of Brest.

To the east of Brest, the Dnieper–Bug Canal was built in the mid-nineteenth century to join the river to Pina, a tributary of the Pripyat River which in turn drains into the Dnieper. Thus Brest has a shipping route all the way to the Black Sea. If not for a dam and neglected weirs west of Brest, north-western European shipping would be connected with the Black Sea also.

==Climate==
Brest has a humid continental climate but slightly leans towards oceanic due to the irregular winter temperatures that mostly hover around the freezing point. However, summers are warm and influenced by its inland position compared to areas nearer the Baltic Sea.

==Demographics==

==Points of interest==

A majestic Soviet-era war memorial was constructed on the site of the 1941 battle to commemorate the known and unknown defenders of the Brest Fortress. This war memorial is the largest tourist attraction in the city. The Berestye Archeological Museum of the old city is located on the southern island of the Hero-Fortress. It has objects and huts dating from the 11th – 13th century that were unearthed during the 1970s.

The Museum of Rescued Art Treasures has a collection of paintings and icons. Brest City Park is over 100 years old and underwent renovations from 2004 to 2006 as part of a ceremony marking the park&#x27;s centennial. In July 2009, the Millennium Monument of Brest was unveiled. Sovetskaya Street is a popular tourist destination in Brest; it was dramatically reconstructed in 2007–2009. Other important landmarks include the Brest Railway Museum.

==Education==
Brest is home to two Universities: A.S. Pushkin Brest State University and Brest State Technical University. There is also a branch of Belarusian National Technical University.

Among the secondary specialized educational institutions of the city:

* Brest State Railway College
* Brest State Medical College

==Transport==

Being situated on the main railway line connecting Berlin and Moscow, and a transcontinental highway (the M1 highway is part of the European route E30 running from Cork to Omsk, where it links with Asian Highway 6 leading to Busan), Brest became a principal border crossing out of the Soviet Union in the postwar era. Today it links the European Union and the Commonwealth of Independent States.

The city of Brest is served by Brest-Tsentralny railway station. Because of the break-of-gauge at Brest, where the Russian broad gauge meets the European standard gauge, all passenger trains, coming from Poland, must have their bogies replaced here, to travel on across Belarus. The freight must be transloaded from cars of one gauge to cars of another. Some of the land in the Brest rail yards remains contaminated due to the transhipment of radioactive materials here since Soviet days. However, cleanup operations have been taking place.

The local airport, Brest Airport (code BQT), operates flights on a seasonal schedule to Kaliningrad in the Russian Federation and seasonal charter flights to Burgas and Antalya.

==Sport==

HC Meshkov Brest is the most successful team of the Belarusian Men&#x27;s Handball Championship, as well as the 2018–19 champions. Also, there is a women&#x27;s handball club in Brest – HC Victoria-Berestie.

HK Brest of the Belarusian Extraleague are the local pro hockey team.

Another popular sport in Brest is football. FC Dynamo Brest is a local club playing in Belarusian Premier League. 

The sports venues are located on the northern riverside on the hydraulic fill, consisting of an indoor track-and-field centre, the Brest Ice Rink, and Belarus&#x27; first outdoor baseball stadium. On the opposite riverside is a large rowing course opened in 2007, home of the National Center for Olympic Training in Rowing. It meets international requirements and can host international competitions. Moreover, it has accommodation and training facilities, favourable location, away from the border crossing along Warsaw Highway (the European route E30).

==Media==
There are some newspapers in Brest: Brestskaya Gazeta, Brestskiy Kurier, Vecherniy Brest.

<text>Radio 4 were an American punk band based in Brooklyn, New York. Formed in 1999, they claimed their music is &quot;made in New York, is about New York, and sounds like New York&quot;.

== History ==

=== Early years ===
The band was formed in 1999 as a trio comprising Anthony Roman (vocals/bass), Tommy Williams (guitar/vocals) and Greg Collins (drums). The three had been friends growing up in Long Island, where they had been involved in the hardcore scene, appearing in bands such as Garden Variety (Roman) and Sleepasaurus. They initially formed the band under the influence of late 1970s/early 1980s punk and post-punk, recording a three-track EP which was released on New Jersey&#x27;s Gern Blandsten label.

Their first album &quot;The New Song &amp; Dance&quot; was released in 2000, produced by Tim O&#x27;Heir. This record was a low-budget, gritty rock album with a slightly retro sound, drawing comparisons to The Clash in particular. Around this time Anthony Roman opened a record store in Brooklyn which became a focus for the emerging scene, and the first album was followed by the &quot;Dance to the Underground&quot; EP, also produced by O&#x27;Heir. A dance remix of the title track became a club hit and was used in a Mitsubishi advert, indicating a new direction for the band&#x27;s sound.

=== &quot;Gotham!&quot; and mainstream success ===
The band subsequently became a five-piece, comprising Roman, Collins, David Milone (Vocals/Guitar) (who replaced original guitarist/singer Tommy Williams in 2005), Gerard Garone (Keyboards), and P.J. O&#x27;Connor (Percussion), and teamed up with James Murphy and Tim Goldsworthy&#x27;s DFA Productions to produce their second album. This collaboration signalled a new direction for the band, merging the guitar punk of their first album with electronic and dance music influences to create a dance-punk sound similar to other DFA-affiliated artists such as The Rapture. &quot;Gotham!&quot; was released in 2002 on Gern Blandsten, described as &quot;half dance party, half political rally&quot;, leading the band to mainstream recognition and international success.

The band recorded their third album, &quot;Stealing of a Nation&quot;, in a basement studio in Brooklyn with Max Heyes, and it was released in September 2004, to a poor critical reception. A fourth album entitled &quot;Enemies Like This&quot; followed in 2006.

Gerard Garone left the band in April 2008. They last appeared together as a full band at the CBGB Festival in New York in 2012. Roman and Milone still occasionally perform together as Orange Cassettes along with former members of Elefant.

== Influences ==
They cite a variety of influences, including Gang of Four, Mission of Burma, Primal Scream and Zero Zero, though their lively punk sound combined with their militant political stance has drawn a strong comparison with The Clash.

Their name comes from a Public Image Ltd. song from that group&#x27;s second album, which is itself a reference to BBC Radio 4.

<doc id="162248" wikidata="Q9443" url="?curid=162248" title="Lothal">
<text>Lothal () was one of the southernmost sites of the ancient Indus Valley civilisation, located in the Bhal region of the Indian state of Gujarat. Construction of the city is believed to have begun around 2200 BCE.

==Discovery==
The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), the official Indian government agency for the preservation of ancient monuments, discovered Lothal in 1954. Excavation work in Lothal commenced on 13 February 1955 and continued till 19 May 1960.

According to the ASI, arguably Lothal had the world&#x27;s earliest known dock, which connected the city to an ancient course of the Sabarmati River on the trade route. This trade route stretched between Harappan cities in Sindh (Pakistan) and the peninsula of Saurashtra where the surrounding Kutch desert of today was a part of the Arabian Sea. However, this interpretation has been challenged by other archaeologists, who argue Khufu&#x27;s Red Sea harbour at Wadi al-Jarf (Egypt) is older, dating its construction to between 2580 to 2550 BCE and that Lothal was a comparatively small town, and that the &quot;dock&quot; was primarily an irrigation tank.

The National Institute of Oceanography in Goa discovered foraminifera (marine microfossils) and salt, gypsum crystals in the rectangular structure clearly indicating that sea water once filled the structure and it was definitely a dockyard.

Lothal was a vital and thriving trade centre in ancient times, with its trade of beads, gems and valuable ornaments reaching the far corners of West Asia and Africa. The techniques and tools they pioneered for bead-making and in metallurgy have stood the test of time for over 4000 years.

Lothal is situated near the village of Saragwala in the Dholka Taluka of Ahmedabad district. It is six kilometres south-east of the Lothal-Bhurkhi railway station on the Ahmedabad-Bhavnagar railway line. It is also connected by all-weather roads to the cities of Ahmedabad (85 km/53 mi), Bhavnagar, Rajkot and Dholka. The nearest cities are Dholka and Bagodara. Resuming excavation in 1961, archaeologists unearthed trenches sunk on the northern, eastern and western flanks of the mound, bringing to light the inlet channels and &quot;nullah&quot; (&quot;ravine&quot;, or &quot;gully&quot;) connecting the dock with the river. The findings consist of a mound, a township, a marketplace, and the &#x27;dock&#x27;. Adjacent to the excavated areas stands the Archaeological Museum, where some of the most prominent collections of Harappa-era antiquities in India are displayed.

The Lothal site was nominated, in April 2014, as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and its application is pending on the tentative list of UNESCO.

==Archaeology==
When British India was partitioned in 1947, most Indus sites, including Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, became part of Pakistan. The Archaeological Survey of India undertook a new program of exploration, and excavation. Many sites were discovered across northwestern India. Between 1954 and 1958, more than 50 sites were excavated in the Kutch (notably Dholavira), and Saurashtra peninsulas, extending the limits of Harappan civilisation by to the river Kim, where the Bhagatrav site accesses the valley of the rivers Narmada and Tapti. Lothal stands from Mohenjo-daro, which is in Sindh.

The meaning of Lothal (a combination of &quot;Loth&quot; and &quot;(s) thal&quot;) in Gujarati is &quot;the mound of the dead&quot;. This is not unusual, as the name of the city of Mohenjo-daro in Sindhi translates to the same. People in villages neighbouring to Lothal had known of the presence of an ancient town and human remains. As recently as 1850, boats could sail up to the mound. In 1942, timber was shipped from Broach to Saragwala via the mound. A silted creek connecting modern Bholad with Lothal and Saragwala represents the ancient flow channel of a river or creek.

Speculation suggests that owing to the comparatively small dimensions of the main city (), Lothal was not a large settlement at all, and its &quot;dock&quot; was perhaps an irrigation tank. However, the ASI and other contemporary archaeologists assert that the city was a part of a major river system on the trade route of the ancient peoples from Sindh to Saurashtra in Gujarat. Lothal provides with the largest collection of antiquities in the archaeology of modern India. It is essentially a single culture site—the Harappan culture in all its variances is evidenced. An indigenous micaceous Red Ware culture also existed, which is believed to be autochthonous and pre-Harappan. Two sub-periods of Harappan culture are distinguished: the same period (between 2400 and 1900 BCE) is identical to the exuberant culture of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro.

After the core of the Indus civilisation had decayed in Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, Lothal seems not only to have survived but to have thrived for many years. Its constant threats – tropical storms and floods – caused immense destruction, which destabilised the culture and ultimately caused its end. Topographical analysis also shows signs that at about the time of its demise, the region suffered from aridity or weakened monsoon rainfall. Thus the cause for the abandonment of the city may have been changes in the climate as well as natural disasters, as suggested by environmental magnetic records. Lothal is based upon a mound that was a salt marsh inundated by tide. Remote sensing and topographical studies published by Indian scientists in the &quot;Journal of the Indian Geophysicists Union&quot; in 2004 revealed an ancient, meandering river adjacent to Lothal, in length according to satellite imagery— an ancient extension of the northern river channel bed of a tributary of the Bhogavo river. Small channel widths () when compared to the lower reaches () suggest the presence of a strong tidal influence upon the city—tidal waters ingressed up to and beyond the city. Upstream elements of this river provided a suitable source of fresh water for the inhabitants.

==History==

Before the arrival of Harappan people (c. 3000 BCE), Lothal was a small village next to the river providing access to the mainland from the Gulf of Khambhat. The indigenous people maintained a prosperous economy, attested by the discovery of copper objects, beads and semi-precious stones. Ceramic wares were of fine clay and smooth, micaceous red surface. A new technique of firing pottery under partly oxidising and reducing conditions was improved by them—designated black-and-red ware, to the micaceous Red Ware. Harappans were attracted to Lothal for its sheltered harbour, rich cotton and rice-growing environment and bead-making industry. The beads and gems of Lothal were in great demand in the west. The settlers lived peacefully with the Red Ware people, who adopted their lifestyle, evidenced from the flourishing trade and changing working techniques. Harappans began producing the indigenous ceramic goods, adopting the manner from the natives.

===Town planning===
A flood destroyed village foundations and settlements (). Harappans based around Lothal and from Sindh took this opportunity to expand their settlement and create a planned township on the lines of greater cities in the Indus valley. Lothal planners engaged themselves to protect the area from consistent floods. The town was divided into blocks of 1- 2m high (3–6 ft) platforms of sun-dried bricks, each serving 20–30 houses of thick mud and brick walls. The city was divided into a citadel, or acropolis and a lower town. The rulers of the town lived in the acropolis, which featured houses with paved bathing platforms, underground and surface drains (built of kiln-fired bricks) and potable water well. The acropolis also housed the towns warehouse, with a ramp down to the basin, on the towns eastern flank. The lower town was subdivided into two sectors. A north–south arterial street was the main commercial area. It was flanked by shops of rich and ordinary merchants and craftsmen. The residential area was located to either side of the marketplace. The lower town was also periodically enlarged during Lothal&#x27;s years of prosperity.
All the construction were made of fire dried bricks, lime and sand mortar and not by sun-dried bricks as bricks are still intact after 4000 years and still bonded together with each other with the mortar bond.

===Economy and urban culture===
The uniform organization of the town and its institutions make it evident that the Harappans were very disciplined people. Commerce and administrative duties were performed according to standards laid out. Municipal administration was strict – the width of most streets remained the same over a long time, and no encroached structures were built. Householders possessed a sump, or collection chamber to deposit solid waste in order to prevent the clogging of city drains. Drains, manholes, and cesspools deposited the waste in the river which was washed out during high tide maintaining the cleanliness of the city. A new provincial style of Harappan art and painting was pioneered. The new approaches included realistic portrayals of animals in their natural surroundings. Metalware, gold and jewellery and tastefully decorated ornaments attest to the culture and prosperity of the people of Lothal.

Most of their equipment: metal tools, weights, measures, seals, earthenware and ornaments were of the uniform standard and quality found across the Indus civilization. Lothal was a major trade centre, importing &quot;en masse&quot; raw materials like copper, chert and semi-precious stones from Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, and mass distributing to inner villages and towns. It also produced large quantities of bronze celts, fish-hooks, chisels, spears and ornaments. Lothal exported its beads, gemstones, ivory and shells. The stone blade industry catered to domestic needs—fine chert was imported from the Larkana valley or from Bijapur in modern Karnataka. Bhagatrav supplied semi-precious stones while &quot;chank&quot; shell came from Dholavira and Bet Dwarka. An intensive trade network gave the inhabitants great prosperity. The network stretched across the frontiers to Egypt, Bahrain and Sumer. One of the evidence of trade in Lothal is the discovery of typical Persian gulf seals, a circular button seal

===Architectural development===

While the wider debate over the end of Indus civilisation continues, archaeological evidence gathered by the ASI appears to point to natural catastrophes, specifically floods and storms as the source of Lothal&#x27;s downfall. A powerful flood submerged the town and destroyed most of the houses, with the walls and platforms heavily damaged. The acropolis was levelled (2000–1900 BCE), and inhabited by common tradesmen and newly built makeshift houses. The worst consequence was the shift in the course of the river, cutting off access to the ships and dock. The people built a new but shallow inlet to connect the flow channel to the dock for sluicing small ships into the basin. Large ships were moored away. Houses were rebuilt, yet without removal of flood debris, which made them poor-quality and susceptible to further damage. Public drains were replaced by soakage jars. The citizens did not undertake encroachments, and rebuilt public baths. However, with a poorly organised government, and no outside agency or central government, the public works could not be properly repaired or maintained. The heavily damaged warehouse was never repaired properly, and stocks were stored in wooden canopies, exposed to floods and fire. The economy of the city was transformed. Trade volumes reduced greatly, though not catastrophically, and resources were available in lesser quantities. Independent businesses caved, allowing a merchant-centric system of factories to develop where hundreds of craftsmen worked for the same supplier and financier. The bead factory had ten living rooms and a large workplace courtyard. The coppersmith&#x27;s workshop had five furnaces and paved sinks to enable multiple artisans to work.

The declining prosperity of the town, paucity of resources and poor administration increased the woes of a people pressured by consistent floods and storms. Increased salinity of soil made the land inhospitable to life, including crops. This is evidenced in adjacent cities of Rangpur, Rojdi, Rupar and Harappa in Punjab, Mohenjo-daro and Chanhudaro in Sindh. A massive flood () completely destroyed the flagging township in a single stroke. Archaeological analysis shows that the basin and dock were sealed with silt and debris, and the buildings razed to the ground. The flood affected the entire region of Saurashtra, Sindh and south Gujarat, and affected the upper reaches of the Indus and Sutlej, where scores of villages and townships were washed away. The population fled to inner regions.
===Later Harappan culture===

Archaeological evidence shows that the site continued to be inhabited, albeit by a much smaller population devoid of urban influences. The few people who returned to Lothal could not reconstruct and repair their city, but surprisingly continued to stay and preserved religious traditions, living in poorly built houses and reed huts. That they were the Harappan peoples is evidenced by the analyses of their remains in the cemetery. While the trade and resources of the city were almost entirely gone, the people retained several Harappan ways in writing, pottery, and utensils. About this time ASI archaeologists record a mass movement of refugees from Punjab and Sindh into Saurashtra and to the valley of Sarasvati (1900–1700 BCE). Hundreds of ill-equipped settlements have been attributed to this people as &quot;Late Harappans&quot; a completely de-urbanised culture characterised by rising illiteracy, less complex economy, unsophisticated administration and poverty. Though Indus seals went out of use, the system of weights with an 8.573 gram (0.3024 oz avoirdupois) unit was retained. Between 1700 and 1600 BCE, trade would revive again. In Lothal, Harappan ceramic works of bowls, dishes and jars were mass-produced. Merchants used local materials such as chalcedony instead of chert for stone blades. Truncated sandstone weights replaced hexahedron chert weights. The sophisticated painting style reduced itself to wavy lines, loops and fronds.

==Science and engineering==
A thick ring-like shell object found with four slits each in two margins served as a compass to measure angles on plane surfaces such as housing alignments, roads or land surveys. S.R. Rao also suggested that it could have functioned as an instrument for measuring angles and perhaps the position of stars and thus for navigation like a sextant. Lothal contributes one of three measurement scales that are integrated and linear (others found in Harappa and Mohenjodaro). An ivory scale from Lothal has the smallest-known decimal divisions in Indus civilisation. The scale is 6 millimetres (0.2 inches) thick, broad and the available length is , but only 27 graduations are visible over , the distance between graduation lines being (the small size indicates use for fine purposes). The sum total of ten graduations from Lothal is approximate to the &quot;angula&quot; in the &quot;Arthashastra&quot;. The Lothal craftsmen took care to ensure durability and accuracy of stone weights by blunting edges before polishing.

For their renowned draining system, Lothal engineers provided corbelled roofs, and an apron of kiln-fired bricks over the brick face of the platform where the sewerage entered the cesspool. Wooden screens inserted in grooves in the side drain walls held back solid waste. The well is built of radial bricks, in diameter and deep. It had an immaculate network of underground drains, silting chambers and cesspools, and inspection chambers for solid waste. The extent of drains provided archaeologists with many clues regarding the layout of streets, organisation of housing and baths. On average, the main sewer is in depth, with outer dimensions of 86 × 68 × 33 cm (34 × 27 × 13 in). Lothal brick-makers used a logical approach in manufacture of bricks, designed with care in regards to thickness of structures. They were used as headers and stretchers in same and alternate layers. Archaeologists estimate that in most cases, the bricks were in ratio 1:0.5:0.25 on three sides, in dimensions which were integral multiples of large graduations of Lothal scale of .

==Religion==

The people of Lothal worshipped a fire god who is speculated to be the horned deity depicted on seals. The presence of private and public fire-altars where religious ceremonies were hosted further testifies to their spiritual beliefs. Archaeologists have discovered gold pendants, charred ashes of terra-cotta cakes and pottery, bovine remains, beads and other signs that may indicate the practice of the Gavamayana sacrifice, associated with the ancient Vedic religion. Animal worship is also evidenced, but not the worship of the Mother Goddess that is evidenced in other Harappan cities—experts consider this a sign of the existence of diversity in religious traditions. However, it is believed that a sea goddess, perhaps cognate with the general Indus-era Mother Goddess, was worshipped. Today, the local villagers likewise worship a sea goddess, &quot;Vanuvati Sikotarimata&quot;, suggesting a connection with the ancient port&#x27;s traditions and historical past as an access to the sea. But the archaeologists also discovered that the practice had been given up by 2000 BCE (determined by the difference in burial times of the carbon-dated remains). It is suggested that the practice occurred only on occasion. It is also considered that given the small number of graves discovered—only 17 in an estimated population of 15,000—the citizens of Lothal also practised cremation of the dead. Post-cremation burials have been noted in other Indus sites like Harappa, Mehi and Damb-Bhuti.

===Metallurgy and jewellery===

Lothal copper is unusually pure, lacking the arsenic typically used by coppersmiths across the rest of the Indus valley. The city imported ingots from probable sources in the Arabian peninsula. Workers mixed tin with copper for the manufacture of celts, arrowheads, fishhooks, chisels, bangles, rings, drills, and spearheads, although weapon manufacturing was minor. They also employed advanced metallurgy in following the &quot;cire perdue&quot; technique of casting, and used more than one-piece moulds for casting birds and animals. They also invented new tools such as curved saws and twisted drills unknown to other civilisations at the time.

Lothal was one of the most important centres of production for shell-working, owing to the abundance of chank shell of high quality found in the Gulf of Kutch and near the Kathiawar coast. Gamesmen, beads, unguent vessels, chank shells, ladles and inlays were made for export and local consumption. Components of stringed musical instruments like the plectrum and the bridge were made of shell. An ivory workshop was operated under strict official supervision, and the domestication of elephants has been suggested. An ivory seal, and sawn pieces for boxes, combs, rods, inlays and ear-studs were found during excavations. Lothal produced a large quantity of gold ornaments—the most attractive item being microbeads of gold in five strands in necklaces, unique for being less than 0.25 millimetres (0.010 inches) in diameter. Cylindrical, globular and jasper beads of gold with edges at right angles resemble modern pendants used by women in Gujarat in plaits of hair. A large disc with holes recovered from a sacrificial altar is compared to the &quot;rukma&quot; worn by Vedic priests. Studs, cogwheel and heart-shaped ornaments of faience and steatite were popular in Lothal. A ring of thin copper wire turned into double spirals resembles the gold-wire rings used by modern Hindus for weddings.

===Art===
The discovery of etched carnelian beads and non-etched barrel beads in Kish and Ur (modern Iraq), Jalalabad (Afghanistan) and Susa (Iran) attest to the popularity of the Indus bead industry across West Asia. The lapidaries select stones of variegated colours, producing beads of different shapes and sizes. The methods of Lothal bead-makers were so advanced that no improvements have been noted over 4,000 years—modern makers in the Khambhat area follow the same technique. Double-eye beads of agate and collared or gold-capped beads of jasper and carnelian beads are among those attributed as uniquely from Lothal. It was very famous for micro-cylindrical beads of steatite (chlorite).
The Lothal excavation yielded 213 seals, third in volume amongst all Indus sites. Seal-cutters preferred short-horned bulls, mountain goats, tigers and composite animals like the elephant-bull for engravings. There is a short inscription of intaglio in almost every seal. Stamp seals with inserted copper rings in a perforated button were used to seal the cargo with impressions of packing materials like mats, twisted cloth, and cords. These seals were only verified at Lothal. Quantitative descriptions along with seals of rulers and owners were stamped on goods. A unique seal found here is from Bahrain—circular, with motif of a dragon flanked by jumping gazelles.

Lothal offers two new types of pottery, a convex bowl with or without stud handle and a small jar with flaring rim, both of which were found in the micaceous Red Ware period and not in contemporary Indus cultures. Lothal artists introduced a new form of realistic painting. Paintings depict animals in their natural surroundings. On one large vessel, the artist depicts birds with fish in their beaks, resting in a tree, while a fox-like animal stands below. This scene bears resemblance to the story of The Fox and the Crow in the &quot;Panchatantra&quot;. Artistic imagination is also suggested via careful portrayals—for example, several birds with legs aloft in the sky suggest flight, while half-opened wings suggest imminent flight. On a miniature jar, the story of the thirsty crow and deer is depicted – of how the deer could not drink from the narrow-mouth of the jar, while the crow succeeded by dropping stones in the jar. The features of the animals are clear and graceful. Movements and emotions are suggested by the positioning of limbs and facial features—in a jar without overcrowding.

A complete set of terra-cotta gamesmen, has been found in Lothal—animal figures, pyramids with ivory handles and castle-like objects (similar to the chess set of Queen Hatshepsut in Egypt). The realistic portrayal of human beings and animals suggests a careful study of anatomical and natural features. The bust of a male with slit eyes, sharp nose, and square-cut beard is reminiscent of Sumerian figures, especially stone sculptures from Mari. In images of men and women, muscular and physical features are sharp, prominently marked. Terra-cotta models also identify the differences between species of dogs and bulls, including those of horses. Animal figures with wheels and a movable head may have been utilised as toys.

===Cultivation and Diet===

Rice was the major food crop but Ragi, jowar was also popular in lothal. Various types of lentils were also part of the diet. The bones of many animals including domesticated and wild give the indication of a wide food culture.

==Excavated Lothal==

On plan, Lothal stands north-to-south and east-to-west. At the height of its habitation, it covered a wider area since remains have been found south of the mound. Due to the fragile nature of unbaked bricks and frequent floods, the superstructures of all buildings have receded. However, the dwarfed walls, platforms, two wells, drains, and paved bathing platforms are visible. The dock walls were also preserved beyond the great deluge (c.1900 BCE) due to the loam that was deposited by persistent floods. Erosion and brick robbery are responsible for the absence of high standing walls as well as the ancient nullah, inlet channel, and riverbed. The flood-damaged peripheral wall of mud-bricks is visible near the warehouse area. The remnants of the north–south sewer are burnt bricks in the cesspool. Cubical blocks of the warehouse on a high platform are also visible.

The ASI has covered the peripheral walls, the wharf, and many houses of the early phase with earth to protect from natural phenomena, but the entire archaeological site is nevertheless facing grave concerns about necessary preservation. Salinity ingress and prolonged exposure to the rain and sun are gradually eating away the remains of the site. Heavy rain in the region has damaged the remains of the sun-dried mud brick constructions. Stagnant rain water has lathered the brick and mud work with layers of moss. Due to siltation, the dockyard&#x27;s draft has been reduced by and saline deposits are decaying the bricks. Officials blame the salinity on capillary action and point out that cracks are emerging and foundations weakening even as restoration work slowly progresses.

==Dockyard==
The trapezoidal, burn brick, structure is located on the east of the town and away from the main river channel, to possibly avoid deposition of silt. The north–south length averages , and east–west width of . An inlet approximately wide and in depth survives in the north of the structure, and a square sluice gate or spillway, that appears could have been dammed by a wooden gate, exists in the south face of the structure. 
When the river changed its course in 2000 BCE, a canal approximately wide and long, was dug to the new river course.

Facilitating the movement of cargo was a mudbrick wharf, long, built on the western arm of the dock, with a ramp leading to the warehouse and acropolis, built on a packed mud platform, original in height (Now it is .) on the south western flank of the basin. The warehouse was originally built on sixty-four cubical blocks, square, with passages, and based on a mud-brick podium. The pedestal was very high to provide maximum protection from floods. Brick-paved passages between blocks served as vents, and a direct ramp led to the dock to facilitate loading. The warehouse was located close to the acropolis, to allow tight supervision by ruling authorities. Despite elaborate precautions, the major floods that brought the city&#x27;s decline destroyed all but twelve blocks, which became the makeshift storehouse.

Rao&#x27;s identification of basin as a dock was challenged by Leshnik in 1968 and later Yule in 1982, 
who offered an alternative assessment of the feature as primarily an irrigation tank. In their assessment the dimensions of the &quot;inlet&quot; are not large enough to accommodate the draft of ocean going vessels, with inland craft having to be used to ferry goods to ocean going vessels birthed elsewhere. The identification of just two wells in the town, one on the southern edge of the dock and the other on the acropolis, were also offered to support the alternative primary purpose, as a tank to irrigate vegetables in the adjoining fields, a place to bathe, and a quay to unload river boats.

The National Institute of Oceanography, Goa discovered foraminifera (marine microfossils) and salt, gypsum crystals (due to evapouration of seawater) in the rectangular structure clearly indicating that sea water once filled the structure, though Leshnik argued these could have been left through flood events.

The purpose of the 5 stone weights found around the basin, as to whether they were anchors or Shadoof weights has also been debated, as have the source of the estuarine shells from the dock, 5 terracotta models of boats and a circular Persian Gulf seal from Bahrain.

It is speculated that Lothal engineers studied tidal movements, and their effects on brick-built structures, since the walls are of kiln-burnt bricks. This knowledge also enabled them to select Lothal&#x27;s location in the first place, as the Gulf of Khambhat has the highest tidal amplitude and ships can be sluiced through flow tides in the river estuary.

The main inlet is wide, and another is provided on the opposite side. To counter the thrust of water, offsets were provided on the outer wall faces. 
At high tide flow of of water would have allowed ships to enter. Provision was made for the escape of excess water through the outlet channel, wide and high in the southern arm.

There was an important public building opposite to the warehouse whose superstructure has completely disappeared. Throughout their time, the city had to brace itself through multiple floods and storms. Dock and city peripheral walls were maintained efficiently. The town&#x27;s zealous rebuilding ensured the growth and prosperity of the trade. However, with rising prosperity, Lothal&#x27;s people failed to upkeep their walls and dock facilities, possibly as a result of over-confidence in their systems. A flood of moderate intensity in 2050 BCE exposed some serious weaknesses in the structure, but the problems were not addressed properly.

==Acropolis and lower town==

The town center of Acropolis was the political and commercial heart of Lothal measuring at east-to-west by north-to-south. There were three streets and two lanes running east–west, and two streets running north–south. The four sides of the rectangular platform on which houses were built are formed by mud-brick structures of thickness and high. The identified bathing platforms are located in the acropolis, and part of mostly two-roomed houses with open courtyards. The bricks used for paving the bathing platforms were polished to prevent seepage. The pavements were lime-plastered, and edges were wainscoted (wooden panels) by thin walls. The ruler&#x27;s residence was and hosted a bathing platform with contiguous squat latrine which was also connected to an outside drain that discharged into the dock. The lower town marketplace was on the main north–south street wide. Built in straight rows on either side of the street are residences and workshops, although brick-built drains and early period housing has now disappeared. The street maintained a uniform width and did not undergo encroachment during the reconstructive periods after deluges. There are multiple two-roomed shops and workplaces of coppersmiths and blacksmiths.

The bead factory, which performs a very important economic function, possesses a central courtyard and eleven rooms, a store, and a guardhouse. There is a cinder dump as well as a double-chambered circular kiln with stoke-holes for fuel supply. Four flues are connected with each other, the upper chamber and the stokehold. The mud plaster of the floors and walls are vitrified owing to intense heat during work. The remnants of raw materials such as reed, cow dung, sawdust, and agate are found, giving archaeologists hints of how the kiln was operated. A large mud-brick building faces the factory, and its significance is noted by its plan. Four large rooms and a hall, with an overall measurement of . The hall has a large doorway and a raised floor in the southern corner of the building.

==Trade==
A coastal route may have existed linking sites such as Lothal and Dholavira to Sutkagan Dor on the Makran coast. Lothal also had trade relations with the Sumerian civilization.
