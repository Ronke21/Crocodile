<text>Hans Florian Zimmer (; born 12 September 1957) is a German film score composer and music producer. He has won two Academy Awards, a BAFTA Award, five Grammy Awards, and has been nominated for three Emmy Awards and a Tony Award. Zimmer was also named on the list of Top 100 Living Geniuses, published by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2007.

His works are notable for integrating electronic music sounds with traditional orchestral arrangements. Since the 1980s, Zimmer has composed music for over 150 films. He has won two Academy Awards for Best Original Score for &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994), and for &quot;Dune&quot; (2021). His works include &quot;Gladiator&quot; (2000), &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; (2003), the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; series (2003–2011), &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; trilogy (2005–2012), &quot;Inception&quot; (2010), &quot;Man of Steel&quot; (2013), &quot;Interstellar&quot; (2014), &quot;Dunkirk&quot; (2017), &quot;No Time to Die&quot; (2021), and the &quot;Dune&quot; series (2021–).

Zimmer spent the early part of his career in the United Kingdom before moving to the United States. He is the head of the film music division at DreamWorks Pictures and DreamWorks Animation studios and works with other composers through the company that he founded, Remote Control Productions, formerly known as Media Ventures. His studio in Santa Monica, California, has an extensive range of computer equipment and keyboards, allowing demo versions of film scores to be created quickly.

Zimmer has collaborated with Christopher Nolan on six films starting with &quot;Batman Begins&quot; (2005). He has also worked on multiple projects with directors including Ridley Scott, Ron Howard, Gore Verbinski, Michael Bay, Guy Ritchie, Denis Villeneuve and Tony Scott.

== Early life ==
Zimmer was born in Frankfurt, West Germany. As a young child, he lived in Königstein-Falkenstein, where he played the piano at home but had piano lessons only briefly, as he disliked the discipline of formal lessons. In one of his Reddit AMAs, he said: &quot;My formal training was two weeks of piano lessons. I was thrown out of eight schools. But I joined a band. I am self-taught. But I&#x27;ve always heard music in my head. And I&#x27;m a child of the 20th century; computers came in very handy.&quot; Zimmer attended the Ecole d&#x27;Humanité, an international boarding school in the Canton of Bern, Switzerland.

He moved to London as a teenager and attended Hurtwood House school. During his childhood, he was strongly influenced by the film scores of Ennio Morricone and has cited &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; as the score that inspired him to become a film composer.

In a speech at the 1999 Berlin Film Festival, Zimmer stated that he is Jewish, and talked about his mother surviving World War II thanks to her escape from Germany to the UK in 1939. In an interview in May 2014, Zimmer revealed that it was difficult growing up in post-War Germany being Jewish and said, &quot;I think my parents were always wary of me telling the neighbors&quot; that they were Jewish. 

In an interview with Mashable in February 2013, he said of his parents: &quot;My mother was very musical, basically a musician and my father was an engineer and an inventor. So I grew up modifying the piano, shall we say, which made my mother gasp in horror, and my father would think it was fantastic when I would attach chainsaws and stuff like that to the piano because he thought it was an evolution in technology.&quot; In an interview with the German television station ZDF in 2006, he said: &quot;My father died when I was just a child, and I escaped somehow into the music and music has been my best friend.&quot;

== Career ==
=== 1977–1988 ===
Zimmer began his career playing keyboards and synthesizers in the 1970s, with the band Krakatoa. He worked with the Buggles, a new wave band formed in London in 1977 with Trevor Horn, Geoff Downes and Bruce Woolley. Zimmer can be seen briefly in the Buggles&#x27; music video for the 1979 song &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot;. After working with the Buggles, he started to work for the Italian group Krisma, a new wave band formed in 1976 with Maurizio Arcieri and Christina Moser. He was a featured synthesist for Krisma&#x27;s third album, &quot;Cathode Mamma&quot;. He has also worked with the band Helden (with Warren Cann from Ultravox). 

In 1984, both Zimmer (on keyboards) and Cann (on drums), were invited to be part of the Spanish group Mecano for a live performance in Segovia (Spain). Two songs from this concert were included in the &quot;&quot; album released in 1985 only in Spain. In 1985, he contributed to the Shriekback album &quot;Oil and Gold&quot;. In 1980, Zimmer co-produced a single, &quot;History of the World, Part 1&quot;, with, and for, UK punk band The Damned, which was also included on their 1980 LP release, &quot;The Black Album&quot;, and carried the description of his efforts as &quot;Over-Produced by Hans Zimmer.&quot;

While living in London, Zimmer wrote advertising jingles for Air-Edel Associates. In the 1980s, Zimmer partnered with Stanley Myers, a prolific film composer who wrote the scores for over sixty films. Zimmer and Myers co–founded the London–based Lillie Yard recording studio. Together, Myers and Zimmer worked on fusing the traditional orchestral sound with electronic instruments. Some of the films on which Zimmer and Myers worked are &quot;Moonlighting&quot; (1982), &quot;Success Is the Best Revenge&quot; (1984), &quot;Insignificance&quot; (1985), and &quot;My Beautiful Laundrette&quot; (1985). Zimmer&#x27;s first solo score was &quot;Terminal Exposure&quot; for director Nico Mastorakis in 1987, for which he also wrote the songs. Zimmer acted as score producer for the 1987 film &quot;The Last Emperor&quot;, which won the Academy Award for Best Original Score.

One of Zimmer&#x27;s most durable works from his time in the United Kingdom was the theme song for the television game show &quot;Going for Gold&quot;, which he composed with Sandy McClelland in 1987. In an interview with the BBC, Zimmer said: &quot;&quot;Going for Gold&quot; was a lot of fun. It&#x27;s the sort of stuff you do when you don&#x27;t have a career yet. God, I just felt so lucky because this thing paid my rent for the longest time.&quot;

=== 1988–2000 ===
A turning point in Zimmer&#x27;s career occurred with the 1988 film &quot;Rain Man&quot;. Hollywood director Barry Levinson was looking for someone to score &quot;Rain Man&quot;, and his wife heard the soundtrack CD of the anti-apartheid drama &quot;A World Apart&quot;, for which Zimmer had composed the music. Levinson was impressed by Zimmer&#x27;s work and hired him to score &quot;Rain Man&quot;. In the score, Zimmer uses synthesizers, mostly a Fairlight CMI, mixed with steel drums. Zimmer explained that &quot;It was a road movie, and road movies usually have jangly guitars or a bunch of strings. I kept thinking don&#x27;t be bigger than the characters. Try to keep it contained. The Raymond character doesn&#x27;t actually know where he is. The world is so different to him. He might as well be on Mars. So, why don&#x27;t we just invent our own world music for a world that doesn&#x27;t really exist?&quot; Zimmer&#x27;s score for &quot;Rain Man&quot; was nominated for an Academy Award in 1989, and the film won four Academy Awards including Best Picture.

A year after &quot;Rain Man&quot;, Zimmer was asked to compose the score for Bruce Beresford&#x27;s &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; which, like &quot;Rain Man&quot;, won an Academy Award for Best Picture. &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot;&#x27;s instrumentation consisted entirely of synthesizers and samplers, played by Zimmer. According to an interview with &quot;Sound on Sound&quot; magazine in 2002, the piano sounds heard within the score come from the Roland MKS–20, a rackmount synthesizer. Zimmer joked: &quot;It didn&#x27;t sound anything like a piano, but it behaved like a piano.&quot;
The soundtrack to Ridley Scott&#x27;s 1991 film &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot; by Zimmer featured the trademark slide guitar performance by Pete Haycock on the &quot;Thunderbird&quot; theme in the film. As a teenager, Zimmer was a fan of Haycock, and their collaboration on film scores includes &quot;K2&quot; and &quot;Drop Zone&quot;.
Zimmer wrote the theme for Tony Scott&#x27;s 1993 film &quot;True Romance&quot;, which he based on Carl Orff&#x27;s &quot;Gassenhauer&quot;. &quot;Gassenhauer&quot; had previously been used in the 1973 film &quot;Badlands&quot;, which had a similar story of a young man and a girl on the run following a violent crime. The catchy theme, played on nine marimbas, contrasts starkly with the violence of the film.

For the 1992 film &quot;The Power of One&quot;, Zimmer travelled to Africa in order to use African choirs and drums in the recording of the score. On the strength of this work, Walt Disney Feature Animation approached Zimmer to compose the score for the 1994 film &quot;The Lion King&quot;. This was to be his first score for an animated film. Zimmer said that he had wanted to go to South Africa to record parts of the soundtrack, but was unable to visit the country as he had a police record there &quot;for doing &#x27;subversive&#x27; movies&quot; after his work on &quot;The Power of One&quot;. Disney studio bosses expressed fears that Zimmer would be killed if he went to South Africa, so the recording of the choirs was organised during a visit by Lebo M. Zimmer won numerous awards for his work on &quot;The Lion King&quot;, including an Academy Award for Best Original Score, a Golden Globe, and two Grammys. In 1997, the score was adapted into a Broadway musical version which won the Tony Award for Best Musical in 1998.
, the musical version of &quot;The Lion King&quot; is the highest grossing Broadway show of all time, having grossed $853.8 million.

Zimmer&#x27;s score for Tony Scott&#x27;s 1995 film &quot;Crimson Tide&quot; won a Grammy Award for the main theme, which makes heavy use of synthesizers in place of traditional orchestral instruments. For &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; (1998), Zimmer said that the director Terrence Malick wanted the music before he started filming, so he recorded six and a half hours of music. Zimmer&#x27;s next project was &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; (1998), which was produced by DreamWorks Animation. He introduced Ofra Haza, an Israeli Yemenite singer, to the directors, and they thought she was so beautiful that they designed one of the characters in the film to look like her.

Zimmer&#x27;s score for the 1998 film &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; is regarded as one of his most important works. The nine-minute cue at the climax of the film, &quot;The Journey to the Line&quot;, uses a recurring theme based on four chords, combined with a &quot;ticking clock&quot; motif that has been featured in a range of subsequent scores composed by Zimmer. The piece has been used in numerous trailers and video games, and has earned the nickname &quot;the forbidden cue&quot; due to the tendency of film makers to use it as a temp track for dramatic scenes.

=== 2000–2012 ===
In the 2000s, Zimmer composed scores for Hollywood blockbuster films including three Ridley Scott films, &quot;Gladiator&quot; (2000), &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; and &quot;Hannibal&quot; (2001), followed by &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; (2003), &quot;Madagascar&quot; (2005), &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; (2006), &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot; (2007), &quot;Kung Fu Panda&quot; (2008), which he co-composed with John Powell, &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot; (2009), and &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; (2009). Other work in the 2000s included the Spanish language film &quot;Casi Divas&quot;, and &quot;The Burning Plain&quot; (2009). He composed the theme for the television boxing series &quot;The Contender&quot; and worked with Lorne Balfe on the music for &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&quot;, which was his first video game project. Zimmer also collaborated with composers Borislav Slavov and Tilman Sillescu to create the score for the video game &quot;Crysis 2&quot;.

In October 2000, Zimmer performed live in concert for the first time with an orchestra and choir at the 27th Annual Flanders International Film Festival in Ghent. While writing the score for &quot;The Last Samurai&quot;, Zimmer felt that his knowledge of Japanese music was extremely limited. He began doing extensive research, but the more he studied, the less he felt he knew. Zimmer took what he had written to Japan for feedback and was shocked when he was asked how he knew so much about Japanese music.

During the scoring of &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; in early 2003, Zimmer was approached by the producer Jerry Bruckheimer, with whom he had worked previously on &quot;Crimson Tide&quot;, &quot;Days of Thunder&quot;, &quot;The Rock,&quot; and &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;. Bruckheimer had finished shooting &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; but was unhappy with the music composed for the film by Alan Silvestri and wanted a replacement score. 

Bruckheimer wanted Zimmer to rescore the film, but due to his commitments on &quot;The Last Samurai&quot;, the task of composing and supervising music for &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; was given to Klaus Badelt, one of Zimmer&#x27;s colleagues at Media Ventures. Zimmer provided some themes that were used in the film, although he is not credited on screen. Zimmer was hired as the composer for the three subsequent films in the series, &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; (2006), &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot; (2007), and &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides&quot; (2011), collaborating with Rodrigo y Gabriela for the last.

Zimmer is noted for his work on the scores of Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;Batman Begins&quot; (2005) and &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; (2008), which he co-composed with James Newton Howard. For the soundtrack of &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, Zimmer decided to represent the villain of the Joker by a single note played on the cello by his long-time colleague Martin Tillman. Zimmer said: &quot;I wanted to write something people would truly hate.&quot; The scores for these films were disqualified from receiving Academy Award nominations for Best Original Score due to too many composers being listed on the cue sheet. Zimmer succeeded in reversing the decision not to nominate &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; in December 2008, arguing that the process of creating a modern film score was collaborative and that it was important to credit a range of people who had played a part in its production. Zimmer explained his approach to scoring with other musicians in an interview with &quot;Soundtrack.net&quot; in 2006:

Originally I had this idea that it should be possible to create some kind of community around this kind of work, and I think by muddying the titles – not having &quot;you are the composer, you are the arranger, you are the orchestrator&quot; – it just sort of helped us to work more collaboratively. It wasn&#x27;t that important to me that I had &quot;score by Hans Zimmer&quot; and took sole credit on these things. It&#x27;s like &quot;Gladiator&quot;: I gave Lisa Gerrard the co-credit because, even though she didn&#x27;t write the main theme, her presence and contributions were very influential. She was more than just a soloist, and this is why I have such a problem with specific credits.

For the 2009 film &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, &quot; Daily Variety&quot; reported that Zimmer purchased an out-of-tune piano for 200 dollars and used it throughout the scoring process because of its &quot;quirkiness&quot;. For the 2011 sequel, &quot;Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows&quot;, Zimmer and director Guy Ritchie incorporated authentic Romani music, which they researched by visiting Slovakia, Italy, and France. The music in the film is played by Romani musicians.

For the 2010 film &quot;Inception&quot;, Zimmer used electronic manipulation of the song &quot;Non, je ne regrette rien&quot;. The horn sound in the score, described by Zimmer as &quot;like huge foghorns over a city&quot; became a popular feature in film trailers. &quot;It&#x27;s funny how that sort of thing becomes part of the zeitgeist&quot;, he said. &quot;But I suppose that&#x27;s exactly what trailers are looking for: something iconic, lasts less than a second, and shakes the seats in the theater.&quot;

In 2012, Zimmer composed and produced the music for the 84th Academy Awards with Pharrell Williams of The Neptunes. He also composed a new version of the theme music for &quot;ABC World News&quot;. Zimmer composed the score for &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;, the final instalment of Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; Trilogy. The film was released in July 2012. Zimmer described himself as &quot;devastated&quot; in the aftermath of the 2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting, which occurred at a screening of &quot;The Dark Knight Rises:&quot; &quot;I just feel so incredibly sad for these people.&quot; He recorded a track entitled &quot;Aurora&quot;, a choral arrangement of a theme from the &quot;Dark Knight Rises&quot; soundtrack, to raise money for the victims of the shooting.

=== 2012–present ===
Zimmer co-composed the music for the television series &quot;The Bible&quot;, which was broadcast in March 2013, with Lorne Balfe and Lisa Gerrard, and the score for &quot;12 Years a Slave&quot;, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture in March 2014. Zimmer composed the &quot;Tomorrowland Hymn&quot; for the Tomorrowland festival to celebrate its tenth anniversary in July 2014.

Zimmer composed the music for the 2014 film &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&quot; alongside &quot;The Magnificent Six&quot;, which consisted of Pharrell Williams, Johnny Marr, Michael Einziger, Junkie XL, Andrew Kawczynski, and Steve Mazzaro.
Zimmer composed the music for Christopher Nolan&#x27;s 2014 film &quot;Interstellar&quot;, which earned him another Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score. He partnered with Junkie XL to compose the music for the 2016 film &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot;. In an interview with BBC News in March 2016, Zimmer said that he was retiring from composing the music for superhero films, saying of &quot;Batman v Superman&quot;: &quot;This one was very hard for me to do, to try to find new language&quot;.

Zimmer composed the main theme for the 2016 BBC nature documentary &quot;Planet Earth II&quot;, presented by David Attenborough. He later composed the score for the 2017 BBC nature documentary &quot;Blue Planet II&quot; alongside Jacob Shea and David Fleming, also presented by David Attenborough. In an interview with Kirsty Wark on BBC Radio, Zimmer said in October 2022: &quot;I think the only work that I&#x27;ve done that&#x27;s worth anything is working for Sir David Attenborough on those programmes, because it&#x27;s the only thing that actually means something to this world and ultimately might have an impact on how we approach this world.&quot;

Zimmer composed the main theme for the 2016 Netflix production &quot;The Crown&quot;. Also in 2016 Zimmer released an online course teaching the basics of film scoring. He next composed the score for Christopher Nolan&#x27;s 2017 film &quot;Dunkirk&quot;, basing part of the score on a recording of a ticking watch that he had been given by Nolan. Zimmer also worked on the score for Denis Villeneuve&#x27;s &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot;. Hans Zimmer and co-composer Benjamin Wallfisch took over scoring duties after Jóhann Jóhannsson left the project.

In 2018, Zimmer composed the score for the new FIFA Anthem, called &quot;Living Football&quot; in reference to the new motto of FIFA, &quot;Living Football&quot; was also used as television intro theme for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. Also in 2018, Zimmer remixed the UEFA Champions League Anthem with rapper Vince Staples for EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; video game &quot;FIFA 19&quot;, with it also featuring in the game&#x27;s reveal trailer. Zimmer composed the score for &quot;Dark Phoenix&quot;, directed by Simon Kinberg, contrary to his 2016 statements of not scoring another superhero film following his experience working on &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot;. In 2019, he scored the photorealistic animated remake of Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Lion King&quot;, directed by Jon Favreau.

In August 2018, Zimmer was announced as the composer for &quot;Wonder Woman 1984&quot;. In March 2019, it was announced that Zimmer would be scoring Denis Villeneuve&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot;.

In June 2019, Zimmer was hired to create sounds for BMW&#x27;s concept vehicle, the Vision M Next. He produced and composed warning sounds for the electric car line. These sounds are both for those on the interior and on the exterior, and could help warn pedestrians that an electric car is approaching.
On 6 January 2020, took over as composer for the &quot;James Bond&quot; film &quot;No Time to Die&quot; after previous composer Dan Romer left the project. Speaking on scoring for &quot;No Time to Die&quot;, Zimmer told &quot;The Hindu&quot;, &quot;Having done the three &quot;Batman&quot; movies—which are three movies to you but are 12 years of my life to me—I really understand where Daniel [Craig] was with this; he dedicated 16 years of his life to Bond... I wanted to not only do a good score but dig a little deeper and honour the man, the work and all the people who&#x27;ve been working on this for so long&quot;.

On 26 February 2020, Major League Soccer released an anthem for its 25th season, which was composed by Zimmer. In March 2020, Zimmer composed the score for &quot;Hillbilly Elegy&quot;.

In 2022, he collaborated with Camila Cabello on the song &quot;Take Me Back Home&quot; for the documentary series &quot;Frozen Planet II&quot;. Zimmer worked on the 2022 film &quot;Top Gun: Maverick&quot;, contributing to the main title credits and other tracks.

<text>Corfe Castle is a village and civil parish in the English county of Dorset. It is the site of a ruined castle of the same name. The village and castle stand over a gap in the Purbeck Hills on the route between Wareham and Swanage. The village lies in the gap below the castle and is around south-east of Wareham, and north-northwest of Swanage. Both the main A351 road from Lytchett Minster to Swanage and the Swanage Railway thread their way through the gap and the village.

The civil parish of Corfe Castle stretches across the width of the Isle of Purbeck, with coasts facing both the English Channel and Poole Harbour. It, therefore, includes sections of both the low-lying sandy heathland that lies to the north of the castle and the rugged Jurassic Coast upland to the south.

==Toponymy==
The name &quot;Corfe&quot; is derived from the Old English word, ceorfan, meaning to cut or carve, referring to the gap in the Purbeck hills where Corfe Castle is situated.

==History==

Burial mounds around Corfe Common to the south of Corfe Castle suggest that the area was occupied from 6000 BC. The common also points to a later Celtic field system worked by the Durotriges tribe. Evidence suggests that the tribe co-existed with the Romans in a trading relationship following the Roman invasion c. 50 AD.

King Edward the Martyr was murdered in Corfe on the evening of 18 March 978.

In the Middle Ages there was a considerable marble carving and stone cutting industry in the village. Purbeck stone was shipped all round the country from Ower Quay in Poole harbour.

In the 18th century, ball clay quarrying developed as an industry in the village. By the middle of the century, with the arrival of William Pike – a merchant from Devon, activity expanded significantly. In 1791 Pike signed a five-year contract with Josiah Wedgwood to supply 1,200 tons of clay and search for further deposits. From the 1796 Corfe Castle Census of the 96 men involved in local industries and living in the town, 55 were clay cutters. Clay extraction continued to provide major employment for the local population until the 20th century.

The village had two watermills, West Mill on the River Wicken ceased operating in 1792 but the building was used for poor housing until 1915. Stone from the building was used to construct the World War 1 war memorial. The other mill was Boar Mill on the Byle Brook. The mill cottage was later used as a bakery. The Grade II listed mill and cottage are now owned by the National Trust.

==Geography==
The parish of Corfe Castle encompasses a broad swathe of the Isle of Purbeck and has an area of . To the south, it includes the smaller village of Kingston and a section of the Jurassic Coast facing the English Channel. To the north, it includes a large area of heathland stretching as far as the southern shore of Poole Harbour, where Furzey, Green, Long and Round little islands also form part of the parish. To the north west on a clear day, the Mendip Hills in Somerset can be seen in the distance from the castle. The village is constructed almost entirely from the local grey Purbeck limestone and comprises two main streets, East Street and West Street, linked at their north end at the Square.

==Landmarks==

The National Trust runs a shop and a tearoom in the village, both are Grade II listed buildings. The Corfe Model Village, located on the village square, is a scale model that shows what the castle and village would have looked like in 1646 before the castle was slighted. Within the Church of St. Edward is an alabaster reredos inset with carvings in white marble, designed by the famous Victorian architect George Edmund Street R.A., which was presented by Lord Eldon in 1876. A cross in the square commemorates Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee of 1897. Next to the cross is a defunct village pump, bearing the village&#x27;s arms. Mortons House Hotel, a Grade II* listed building, was built in 1590 and is one of the most notable buildings in the village. Corfe Castle Town Hall, also Grade II listed, in West Street, was built in around 1774.

==Corfe Castle==

The castle stands above the village and dates back in some form to the 10th century. It was the site of the murder of Edward the Martyr in 978.
During the English Civil War it was a Royalist stronghold and was besieged twice, in 1643 and again in 1646.
It is currently owned by the National Trust and is open to the public.

==Governance==

The former royal status of Corfe meant that it existed as a borough electing two Members of Parliament (MPs). In the 17th and 18th centuries, with the Bankes&#x27;s owning much of the property and thereby controlling most of the votes, the town was a rotten borough. The Bankes family was able to ensure that at least one of the MPs returned to the House of Commons was a member of the family or a Bankes nominee. The Reform Act 1832 abolished the rotten boroughs, and Corfe lost its direct representation. The village and castle were part of Corfe Castle hundred.

The parish later formed part of the District of Purbeck. It is within the South Dorset constituency of the House of Commons. Prior to Brexit in 2020 it was in the South West England constituency of the European Parliament. There is an electoral ward called Castle which is based on the village, but this includes Studland and the intermediate areas. The total population of Castle ward is 1,780.

After 2019 structural changes to local government in England, Corfe Castle is part of the South East Purbeck ward which elects 1 member to Dorset Council.

==Demography==
In the 2011 census Corfe Castle civil parish had 738 dwellings, 612 households and a population of 1,355.

==Transport==

The main route through the village is East Street which forms part of the A351 main road taking traffic to Wareham in the north and Swanage in the south. Separating the two streets is an area of common land called &quot;the Halves&quot;.

Corfe Castle railway station lies to the east of East Street, adjacent to the village centre. Originally the only intermediate station on the London and South Western Railway&#x27;s branch line from Wareham to Swanage, the station is now a stop on the Swanage Railway, a steam locomotive operated heritage railway. The railway links the tourist centres of Corfe Castle and Swanage with each other, and with a Park and Ride site at Norden station just to the north of Corfe Castle. On some days, diesel trains also run to Wareham, where they connect with National Rail services to London, Southampton, Bournemouth and Weymouth.

==Notable residents==
The village was for many years the residence of composer Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji.

==Cultural references==

Keith Roberts, an English science fiction writer who lived nearby, set his alternative history novel &quot;Pavane&quot; partly around the castle.

The children&#x27;s author Enid Blyton spent time in the area, and some of her adventure stories like The Famous Five (Kirrin Island) featured castles that were said to be based on Corfe Castle.
In 1957 the Children&#x27;s Film Foundation (CFF) film &quot;Five on a Treasure Island&quot; was filmed in and around Corfe Castle, Corfe Castle Village and the Jurassic Coast (Durdle Door and Stairhole at Lulworth Cove).

Corfe was featured in the 1971 film &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot; released by The Walt Disney Company, doubling as the fictional village of Pepperinge Eye.

The Castle itself and the Greyhound Inn feature prominently in Mike Leigh&#x27;s 1976 TV play &quot;Nuts in May&quot;. The two main characters, Keith and Candice-Marie, pay a visit to the castle during their camping holiday.

The back of Corfe Castle plus Oliver&#x27;s Bistro in Corfe Castle Village are featured in the German TV thriller &quot;&quot; based on the novel by Charlotte Link.

An episode of &quot;Mary Queen of Shops&quot; centred on Mary Portas revamping the village&#x27;s convenience store.

Featured in the time-slip novel, &quot;The Lady of Hay&quot; by Barbara Erskine.

<text>Dionysius of Halicarnassus (, 
; – after 7 BC) was a Greek historian and teacher of rhetoric, who flourished during the reign of Emperor Augustus. His literary style was &quot;atticistic&quot; – imitating Classical Attic Greek in its prime.

He is known for his work &quot;Rhōmaikē Archaiologia&quot; (Roman Antiquities), which describes the history of Rome from its beginnings until the outbreak of the First Punic War in 264 BC. Out of twenty books, only the first nine have survived. Dionysius&#x27; opinion of the necessity of a promotion of paideia within education, from true knowledge of classical sources, endured for centuries in a form integral to the identity of the Greek elite.

==Life==
He was a Halicarnassian. At some time after the end of the civil wars he moved to Rome, and spent twenty-two years studying Latin and literature and preparing materials for his history. During this period, he gave lessons in rhetoric, and enjoyed the society of many distinguished men. The date of his death is unknown. In the 19th century, it was commonly supposed that he was the ancestor of Aelius Dionysius of Halicarnassus.

==Works==
===Roman Antiquities===
His major work, entitled Roman Antiquities (, &quot;Rhōmaikē Archaiologia&quot;), frequently abbreviated Ant. Rom. (), narrates the history of Rome from the mythical period to the beginning of the First Punic War in twenty books, of which the first nine remain extant while the remaining books only exist as fragments, in the excerpts of the Roman emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus and an epitome discovered by Angelo Mai in a Milan manuscript. Dionysius is the first major historian of early Roman history whose work is now extant. Several other ancient historians who wrote of this period, almost certainly used Dionysius as a source for their material. The works of Appian, Plutarch and Livy all describe similar people and events of Early Rome as Dionysius.

In the preamble to Book I, Dionysius states that the Greek people lack basic information on Roman history, a deficiency he hopes to fix with the present work.

:;Book I   (1300?)–753 BC: Mythic early history of Italy and its people. Book I also narrates the history of Aeneas and his progeny as well as Dionysius&#x27; telling of the Romulus and Remus myth, ending with the death of Remus.

:;Book II   753–673 BC: The Roman monarchy&#x27;s first two Kings, Romulus and Numa Pompilius. Romulus formulates customs and laws for Rome. Sabine war- as in subsequent parts of the history, this early conflict is described as involving numerous categories of officer, thousands of infantry, and cavalry combatants. This is highly unlikely, but is a common anachronism found in ancient historians.

:;Book III   673–575 BC: Kings Tullus Hostilius through Lucius Tarquinius Priscus.

:;Book IV   575–509 BC: Last of the Roman kings and end of the monarchy with overthrow of Lucius Tarquinius Superbus.

:;Book V   509-497 BC: Start of Roman Republic and Consular years.

:;Book VI   496–493 BC: Includes the first instance of Plebeian secession.

:;Book VII   492–490 BC: This book describes at length the background leading to the Roman Coriolanus&#x27; trial, ending in his exile. Much of the book is a debate between supporters of the oligarchy and the plebeians.

:;Book VIII   489–482 BC: Coriolanus, now exiled, allies with Rome&#x27;s current primary enemy, the Volscians. Coriolanus leads the Volscian army on a successful campaign against Roman allies and finally is near to capturing Rome itself. Coriolanus&#x27; mother intercedes for the Roman state and manages to end the military campaign. Coriolanus then is treacherously murdered by the Volscians. The remaining part of the book covers the military campaigns to recover land from the Volscians.

:;Book IX   481–462 BC: Various military campaigns of mixed fortune in foreign matters. Domestically the plebeians and patricians argue and the conflict of the orders continues. The number of Tribunes is raised from 5 to 10. Book IX ends with the first two years of the decemvirate and the creation of the first Roman Law Tables.

:;Book X   461–449 BC: The decemvirate continued.

::;&quot;Note&quot;: The last ten books are fragmentary, based on excerpts from medieval Byzantine history compilations. Book XI is mostly extant at around 50 pages (Aeterna Press, 2015 edition), while the remaining books, have only 12–14 pages per book.

:;Book XI   449–443 BC: &quot;fragments&quot;

:;Book XII   442–396 BC: &quot;fragments&quot;

:;Book XIII   394–390 BC: &quot;fragments&quot;

:;Book XIV   390 BC: Gauls sack of Rome.

:;Book XV: First and Second Samnite War.

:;Book XVI–XVII: Third Samnite War.

:;Book XIX: The beginnings of conflicts between Rome and the warlord Pyrrhus of Epirus. Threatened by Roman expansion into southern Italy, the city of Tarentum asks Pyrrhus to protect them.

:;Book XX: Roman-Pyrrhic war, with Pyrrhus&#x27;s second invasion of Italy.

Because his prime objective was to reconcile the Greeks to Roman rule, Dionysius focused on the good qualities of their conquerors, and also argued that – based on sources ancient in his own time – the Romans were genuine descendants of the older Greeks. According to him, history is philosophy teaching by examples, and this idea he has carried out from the point of view of a Greek rhetorician. But he carefully consulted the best authorities, and his work and that of Livy are the only connected and detailed extant accounts of early Roman history.

===Other works===
Dionysius was also the author of several rhetorical treatises, in which he shows that he had thoroughly studied the best Attic models:
:The Art of Rhetoric (: a collection of essays on the theory of rhetoric, incomplete, and certainly not all his work;
:The Arrangement of Words (, ): on the combination of words according to the different styles of oratory;
:On Imitation (): on the best models in the different kinds of literature and the way in which they are to be imitated—a fragmentary work;
:Commentaries on the Attic Orators (: which covers Lysias, Isaeus, Isocrates, and by way of supplement, Dinarchus;
:On the Admirable Style of Demosthenes ()
:On the Character of Thucydides ()

The last two treatises are supplemented by letters to Gn. Pompeius and Ammaeus (two, one of which is about Thucydides).

===Dionysian &quot;imitatio&quot;===

&quot;Dionysian imitatio&quot; is the literary method of imitation as formulated by Dionysius, who conceived it as the rhetorical practice of emulating, adapting, reworking, and enriching a source text by an earlier author. It shows marked similarities with Quintilian&#x27;s view of imitation, and both may derive from a common source.

Dionysius&#x27; concept marked a significant departure from the concept of &quot;mimesis&quot; formulated by Aristotle in the 4th century BC, which was only concerned with &quot;imitation of nature&quot; and not &quot;imitation of other authors.&quot; Latin orators and rhetoricians adopted Dionysius&#x27; method of &quot;imitatio&quot; and discarded Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;mimesis&quot;.

==History in the Roman Antiquities, and the Foundation Myth==
Dionysius carried out extensive research for his Roman history, selecting among authorities, and preserving (for example) details of the Servian Census.

His first two books present a unified account of the supposed Greek origin for Rome, merging a variety of sources into a firm narrative: his success, however, was at the expense of concealing the primitive Roman actuality (as revealed by archaeology). Along with Livy, Dionysius is thus one of the primary sources for the accounts of the Roman foundation myth, and that of Romulus and Remus, and was relied on in the later publications of Plutarch, for example. He writes extensively on the myth, sometimes attributing direct quotations to its figures. The myth spans the first 2 volumes of his &quot;Roman Antiquities&quot;, beginning with Book I chapter 73 and concluding in Book II chapter 56.

===Romulus and Remus===

====Origins and survival in the wild====
Dionysius claims that the twins, Romulus and Remus, were born to a vestal named Ilia Silvia (sometimes called Rea), descended from Aeneas of Troy and the daughter of King Latinus of the Original Latin tribes, thus linking Rome to Trojans and Latins both. Dionysius lays out the different accounts of her pregnancy and the twins&#x27; conception, but declines to choose one over the others.

Citing Fabius, Cincius, Porcius Cato, and Piso, Dionysius recounts the most common tale, whereby the twins are to be tossed into the Tiber; are left at the site of the ficus Ruminalis; and rescued by a she-wolf who nurses them in front of her lair (the &quot;Lupercal&quot;) before being adopted by Faustulus. Dionysius relates an alternate, &quot;non-fantastical&quot; version of Romulus and Remus&#x27; birth, survival and youth. In this version, Numitor managed to switch the twins at birth with two other infants. The twins were delivered by their grandfather to Faustulus to be fostered by him and his wife, Laurentia, a former prostitute. According to Plutarch, &quot;lupa&quot; (Latin for &quot;wolf&quot;) was a common term for members of her profession and this gave rise to the she-wolf legend.

====Falling out and Foundation of Rome====
The twins receive a proper education in the city of Gabii, before eventually winning control of the area around where Rome would be founded. Dispute over the particular hill upon which Rome should be built, the Palatine Hill or the Aventine Hill for its strategic advantages saw the brothers fall out and Remus killed.

When the time came to actually construct the city of Rome, the two brothers disputed over the particular hill upon which Rome should be built, Romulus favoring the Palatine Hill and Remus favoring what later came to be known as Remoria (possibly the Aventine Hill). Eventually, the two deferred their decision to the gods at the advice of their grandfather. Using the birds as omens, the two brothers decided &quot;he to whom the more favourable birds first appeared should rule the colony and be its leader.&quot; Since Remus saw nine vultures first, he claimed that the gods chose him and Romulus claimed that since he saw a greater (the &quot;more favorable&quot;) number of vultures, the gods chose him. Unable to reach a conclusion, the two brothers and their followers fought, ultimately resulting in the death of Remus. After his brother&#x27;s death, a saddened Romulus buried Remus at the site of Remoria, giving the location its namesake.

Before the actual construction of the city began, Romulus made sacrifices and received good omens, and he then ordered the populace to ritually atone for their guilt. The city&#x27;s fortifications were first and then housing for the populace. He assembled the people and gave them the choice as to what type of government they wanted - monarchy, democracy, or oligarchy - for its constitution. After his address, which extolled bravery in war abroad and moderation at home, and in which Romulus denied any need to remain in power, the people decided to remain a kingdom and asked him to remain its king. Before accepting he looked for a sign of the approval of the gods. He prayed and witnessed an auspicious lightning bolt, after which he declared that no king shall take the throne without receiving approval from the gods.

====Institutions====

Dionysus then provided a detailed account of the &#x27;Romulus&#x27; constitution, most probably based on the work of Terentius Varro. Romulus supposedly divides Rome into 3 tribes, each with a Tribune in charge. Each tribe was divided into 10 Curia, and each of those into smaller units. He divided the kingdom&#x27;s land holdings between them, and Dionysus alone among our authorities insists that this was done in equal lots. The Patrician class was separated from the Plebeian class; while each curiae was responsible for providing soldiers in the event of war.

A system of patronage (&quot;clientela&quot;), a senate (attributed by Dionysius to Greek influence) and a personal bodyguard of 300 of the strongest and fittest among the nobles were also established: the latter, the &quot;celeres&quot;, were so-named either for their quickness, or, according to Valerius Antias, for their commander.

A separation of power and measures to increase manpower were also instituted, as were Rome&#x27;s religious customs and practices, and a variety of legal measures praised by Dionysius.

Again, Dionysius thoroughly describes the laws of other nations before contrasting the approach of Romulus and lauding his work. The Roman law governing marriage is, according to his &quot;Antiquities&quot;, an elegant yet simple improvement over that of other nations, most of which he harshly derides. By declaring that wives would share equally in the possessions and conduct of their husband, Romulus promoted virtue in the former and deterred mistreatment by the latter. Wives could inherit upon their husband&#x27;s death. A wife&#x27;s adultery was a serious crime, however, drunkenness could be a mitigating factor in determining the appropriate punishment. Because of Romulus&#x27; laws, Dionysius claims that not a single Roman couple divorced over the following five centuries.

Romulus&#x27; laws governing parental rights, in particular, those that allow fathers to maintain power over their adult children were also considered an improvement over those of others; while Dionysius further approved of how, under the laws of Romulus, native-born free Romans were limited to two forms of employment: farming and the army. All other occupations were filled by slaves or non-Roman labor.

Romulus used the trappings of his office to encourage compliance with the law. His court was imposing and filled with loyal soldiers and he was always accompanied by the 12 lictors appointed to be his attendants.

====The Rape of the Sabine Women and death of Romulus====

Following his institutional account, Dionysus described the famous abducting of the Sabine women and suggesting thereby that the abduction was a pretext for alliance with the Sabines. Romulus wished to cement relations with neighboring cities through intermarriage, but none of them found the fledgling city of Rome worthy of their daughters. To overcome this, Romulus arranged a festival in honor of Neptune (the Consualia) and invited the surrounding cities to attend. At the end of the festival, Romulus and the young men seized all the virgins at the festival and planned to marry them according to their customs. In his narrative, however, the cities of Caecina, Crustumerium, and Antemnae petition for Tatius, king of the Sabines to lead them to war; and it is only after the famous intervention of the Sabine women that the nations agreed to become a single kingdom under the joint rule of Romulus and Tatius, both declared &quot;Quirites&quot;.

After the death of Tatius, however, Romulus became more dictatorial, until he met his end, either through actions divine or earthly. One tale tells of a &quot;darkness&quot; that took Romulus from his war camp to his father in heaven. Another source claims that Romulus was killed by his Roman countrymen after releasing hostages, showing favoritism, and excessive cruelty in his punishments.

== Impact ==
It is widely accepted that Josephus&#x27; &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; was influenced by Dionysius&#x27; &quot;Roman Antiquities&quot;. In recent years, this view has been contested by several scholars.

<text>Hegesias of Magnesia (, &quot;Hēgēsias ho Magnēs&quot;), Greek rhetorician, and historian, flourished about 300 BC. Strabo (xiv. 648), speaks of him as the founder of the florid Asiatic style of composition.

Agatharchides, Dionysius of Halicarnassus (&quot;De compositione verborum&quot; 18) and Cicero all speak of him in disparaging terms, although Varro seems to have approved of his work. He professed to imitate the simplest style of Lysias, avoiding long periods, and expressing himself in short, jerky sentences, without modulation or finish. His vulgar affectation and bombast made his writings a mere caricature of the old Attic. Dionysius describes his composition as tinselled, ignoble and effeminate. According to Gualtiero Calboli, Hegesias and his fellow Asiatics rejected Attic examples (and in particular the example of Thucydides) in favor of a return to &quot;the models of Ionic and sophistic prose.&quot;

It is generally supposed, from the fragment quoted as a specimen by Dionysius (and cf. Plutarch, &quot;Life of Alexander&quot; 3), that Hegesias is to be classed among the writers of lives of Alexander the Great. This fragment describes the treatment of Gaza and its inhabitants by Alexander after its conquest, but it is possible that it is only part of an epideictic or show speech, not of an historical work. This view is supported by a remark of Agatharchides in Photius (cod. 250) that the only aim of Hegesias was to exhibit his skill in describing sensational events.

<doc id="159405" wikidata="Q1000032" url="?curid=159405" title="Unschooling">
<text>Unschooling is a practice of self-driven informal learning characterized by a lesson-free and curriculum-free implementation of homeschooling. Unschooling encourages exploration of activities initiated by the children themselves, under the belief that the more personal learning is, the more meaningful, well-understood, and therefore useful it is to the child. 

The term &quot;unschooling&quot; was coined in the 1970s and used by educator John Holt, who is widely regarded as the father of unschooling. Unschooling is often seen as a subset of homeschooling, the key difference lying in the use of an external or individual curriculum. Homeschooling, in its many variations, has been the subject of widespread public debate. 

Critics of unschooling see it as extreme, and express concerns that unschooled children will be neglected by parents whom might not be capable of sustaining a proper educational environment, and the child might lack the social skills, structure, discipline, and motivation of their schooled peers. Critics also worry that unschooled children will be unable to cope with uncomfortable or challenging situations. Proponents of unschooling disagree, asserting that self-directed education in a non-academic, often natural and diversified environment is a far more efficient, sustainable, and child-friendly form of education than traditional schooling, as it preserves innate curiosity, pleasure, and willingness to discover and learn new things. However, some studies suggest that children who have participated in unschooling may experience academic underdevelopment.

==History==

The term &quot;unschooling&quot; probably derives from Ivan Illich&#x27;s term &quot;deschooling&quot;. It was popularized through John Holt&#x27;s newsletter &quot;Growing Without Schooling&quot; (&quot;GWS&quot;). Holt is also widely regarded as the father of unschooling. In an early essay, Holt contrasted the two terms:

GWS will say &quot;unschooling&quot; when we mean taking children out of school, and &quot;deschooling&quot; when we mean changing the laws to make schools non-compulsory...

At the time, the term was equivalent to &quot;home schooling&quot;. Subsequently, home-schoolers began to differentiate between various educational philosophies within home schooling. The term &quot;unschooling&quot; became used to contrast versions of home schooling that were perceived as politically and pedagogically &quot;school-like,&quot; in that they used textbooks and exercises at home in the same way they would be used at school.

In 2003, in Holt&#x27;s book &quot;Teach Your Own&quot; (originally published in 1981), Pat Farenga, co-author of the new edition, provided a definition:

When pressed, I define unschooling as allowing children as much freedom to learn in the world as their parents can comfortably bear. It allows children to develop knowledge and skills based on their own personal passions and life situations.

In the same passage Holt stated that he was not entirely comfortable with this term, and would have preferred the term &quot;living&quot;. Holt&#x27;s use of the term emphasizes learning as a natural process, integrated into the spaces and activities of everyday life, and not benefiting from adult manipulation. It follows closely on the themes of educational philosophies proposed by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Jiddu Krishnamurti, Paul Goodman, and A.S. Neill.

After Holt&#x27;s death a range of unschooling practitioners and observers defined the term in various ways. For instance, the Freechild Project defines unschooling as:

[T]he process of learning through life, without formalized or institutionalized classrooms or schoolwork.

American homeschooling parent Sandra Dodd proposed the term &quot;radical&quot; &quot;unschooling&quot; to emphasize the complete rejection of any distinction between educational and non-educational activities. Radical unschooling emphasizes that unschooling is a non-coercive, cooperative practice, and seeks to promote those values in all areas of life. These philosophies share an opposition to traditional schooling techniques and the social structure of schools. Most emphasize the integration of learning into the everyday life of the family and wider community. Points of disagreement include whether unschooling is primarily defined by the initiative of the learner and their control over the curriculum, or by the techniques, methods, and spaces used. Peter Gray suggested the term &quot;self-directed education&quot;, which has fewer negative connotations.

== Motivations ==

Parents choose to unschool their children for a variety of reasons, many of which overlap with reasons for homeschooling.

Unschoolers criticize schools for lessening the parent–child bond, reducing family time, and for creating atmospheres that are fearful. Some unschoolers argue that schools teach children facts and skills that will not be useful to them, whereas, with unschooling, children learn how to learn, which is of more enduring use. Some assert that schools teach children only how to follow instructions, which does not prepare them to confront novel tasks. Another argument is that the structure of school is not suitable for people who want to make their own decisions about what, when, how, and with whom they learn because many things are predetermined in the school setting, while unschooled students are more free to make such decisions.

In school, a student&#x27;s community may consist mainly of a peer group, that the parent has little influence over or even knowledge of. Unschoolers may have more opportunity to share a role in their community—including with older and younger people—and can therefore learn to find their place within more diverse groups of people. Parents of school children also have little say regarding instructors and teachers, whereas parents of unschoolers may be more involved in the selection of the coaches or mentors their children work and build relationships with.

According to unschooling pioneer John Holt, child-led learning is more efficient and respectful of children&#x27;s time, takes advantage of their interests, and allows deeper exploration of subjects than what is possible in conventional education.
...the anxiety children feel at constantly being tested, their fear of failure, punishment, and disgrace, severely reduces their ability both to perceive and to remember, and drives them away from the material being studied into strategies for fooling teachers into thinking they know what they really don&#x27;t know.

Some schools have adopted relatively non-coercive and cooperative techniques in a manner that harmonizes with the philosophies behind unschooling. For example, Sudbury model schools are non-coercive, non-indoctrinative, cooperative, democratically run partnerships between children and adults—including full partnership with parents—in which learning is individualized and child-led, in a way that complements home education.

Concerns about socialization can also be a factor in the decision to unschool. Some unschoolers believe that conditions in conventional schools, such as age segregation, the ratio of children to adults, or the amount of time spent sitting and obeying orders of one authority figure, are not conducive to proper education.

Unschooling may broaden the diversity of people or places an unschooler is exposed to. Unschoolers may be more mature than their schooled peers on average, and some believe this is a result of the wide range of people they have the opportunity to interact with, although it may also be &quot;difficult to find children [...] for, well, socialization&quot;. Opportunities for unschoolers to meet and interact with other unschoolers has increased in recent years, allowing unschoolers to have interactions with other children with similar experiences.

==Methods and philosophy==

===Natural learning===

Unschooling is based on the belief that learning is a natural and ongoing process, and that curiosity is an intrinsic part of human development. Proponents argue that children have an inherent desire to learn, and that traditional educational systems, with their standardized curricula and structured schedules, may not always align with individual needs, interests, or abilities. Critics of conventional schooling suggest that a rigid, one-size-fits-all approach can limit children&#x27;s potential by requiring them to engage with specific subject matter in a uniform way, without considering their personal pace, prior knowledge, or future goals. However, this perspective is debated, and many believe that structured education can provide valuable support for diverse learning styles and needs.

==== Create an environment ====
Create an environment that nurtures growth by treating the home like a garden—one that you water and care for, rather than focusing on direct instruction. Simple actions, like placing a pile of paper with a cup of colored markers in the center of the table, bringing a piano into the home, or filling the space with books, are easy ways to cultivate this atmosphere.

===Learning styles===
Psychologists have documented many differences between children in the way they learn. Standardized testing, which is required in traditional American schooling (a study conducted by the Council of Great City Schools has shown that students in U.S public schools will take, on average, 112 standardized tests throughout their school careers ), is widely regarded as a poor gauge of intelligence. Its formulaic and rigid way of questioning does not allow for any creative thought or new ways of thinking. Unschoolers assert that unschooling is better equipped to adapt to such differences in thought processes, measuring intelligence through observation, rather than testing.

People vary in their learning styles, that is, how they prefer to acquire new information. However, research in 2008 found &quot;virtually no evidence&quot; that learning styles increased learning or improved performance, as opposed to being a matter of preference. Students have different learning needs, but in a traditional school setting, teachers seldom customize their evaluation method for an individual student. While teaching methods often vary between teachers, and any teacher may use multiple methods, this is sometimes haphazard and not always individualized.

====Project managing skills for kids====
Encourage a child to choose a personal project they can work on while their parents focus on their own tasks. Ask questions like, &quot;What is your project?&quot; or &quot;What are you working on?&quot; to teach time management and project skills, such as setting deadlines, holding meetings, and managing budgets—even if the project is something as simple as a lemonade stand.

====Developmental differences====
Developmental psychologists note that just as children reach growth milestones at different ages, children are also prepared to learn different things at different ages. Just as most children learn to walk during a normal range of eight to fifteen months, and begin to talk across an even larger range, unschoolers assert that they are also ready and able to read, for example, at different ages. Natural learning produces greater changes in behavior (e.g. changing job skills) than traditional learning methods, although not necessarily a change in the amount of information learned. Traditional education systems typically require all students to begin reading and learning mathematical concepts like multiplication at the same age. Unschooling proponents believe that this one-size-fits-all approach can cause some children to become disengaged if they have already mastered a topic, while others may struggle if they are not yet ready to learn it.

==== Music and Unschooling ====
While not necessarily an essential part of a formal education, most students in America take part in some form of music making. 97% of American public schools offer some form of music at the elementary level. The traditional approach to teaching music theory involves learning how to read music and play it exactly as written. The unschooling approach follows the &quot;Garage Band Theory,&quot; created by Duke Sharp. This method is a take on &quot;playing songs by ear&quot;- it draws on a person&#x27;s natural ability to recognize music and pick up on the same sounds in different songs. Unschooling parents believe it is a more effective way to learn music compared to sight reading.

===Essential body of knowledge===
Unschoolers sometimes state that learning any specific subject is less important than learning &quot;how&quot; to learn. In the words of Holt:

Since we can&#x27;t know what knowledge will be most needed in the future, it is senseless to try to teach it in advance. Instead, we should try to turn out people who love learning so much and learn so well that they will be able to learn whatever must be learned.

Unschoolers suggest that this ability for children to learn on their own makes it more likely that later, when these children are adults, they can continue to learn in order to meet newly emerging needs, interests, and goals; and that they can return to any subject that they feel was not sufficiently covered or learn a completely new subject.

Many unschoolers disagree that there is a particular body of knowledge that everyone, regardless of the life they lead, needs to possess. In the words of John Holt, &quot;If children are given access to enough of the world, they will see clearly enough what things are truly important to themselves and to others, and they will make for themselves a better path into that world than anyone else could make for them.&quot;

===The role of parents===
Parents of unschoolers provide resources, support, guidance, information, and advice to facilitate experiences that aid their children in accessing, navigating, and making sense of the world. Common parental activities include sharing interesting books, articles, and activities with their children, helping them find knowledgeable people to explore an interest with (for example physics professors or automotive mechanics), and helping them set goals and figure out what they need to do to meet their goals. Unschooling&#x27;s interest-based nature does not mean that it is a &quot;hands-off&quot; approach to education; parents tend to be involved, especially with younger children (older children, unless new to unschooling, often need less help in finding resources and in making and carrying out plans).

=== Paradigm shift ===
Because unschooling contradicts assumptions of the dominant culture, advocates suggest that a paradigm shift in regards to education and child rearing is required before engaging with unschooling. New unschoolers are advised that they should not expect to understand the unschooling philosophy at first, as many commonplace assumptions about education are unspoken and unwritten. One step towards this paradigm shift is accepting that &quot;what we do is nowhere near as important as why we do it.&quot;

==Compared with other homeschooling models==

Unschooling is a form of homeschooling, which is the education of children at home or places other than in a school. Unschooling teaches children based on their interests rather than according to a set curriculum.

Unschooling contrasts with other forms of homeschooling in that the student&#x27;s education is not directed by a teacher and curriculum. Unschooling is a real-world implementation of the open classroom methods promoted in the late 1960s and early 1970s, without the school, classrooms, or grades. Parents who unschool their children act as facilitators, providing a range of resources, helping their children access, navigate, and make sense of the world; they aid their children in making and implementing goals and plans for both the distant and immediate future. Unschooling expands from children&#x27;s natural curiosity as an extension of their interests, concerns, needs, and goals.

Unschooling differs from discovery learning, minimally invasive education, purpose-guided education, academic advising, phenomenon-based learning, and thematic learning.

==Branches==
There are a variety of approaches to designing and practicing unschooling. Some of the most popular include:
* Worldschooling, in which families travel around the world and learn through experiencing other places, people, cultures, and activities typical for these locations.
* Project-based unschooling, which holds that students acquire a deeper knowledge through active exploration of real-world challenges, problems, and projects that they can do in their own way and at their own pace.
* Gameschooling, employs various games like board and card games to facilitate learning. In addition to developing skills in math, language, and history, board games also develop social skills such as interpersonal communication, negotiation, persuasion, diplomacy, and virtues like good sportsmanship.

==Complementary philosophies==

Unschooling families may adopt the following philosophies: 
*&quot;Unconditional Parenting&quot; and &quot;Punished by Rewards&quot;—parenting and education books by Alfie Kohn.
*The continuum concept, attachment parenting, and attachment theory—theories and practices attempting to encourage the child&#x27;s development.
*Voluntaryism—the idea that all forms of human association should be voluntary, as far as possible (voluntaryism opposes the initiation of aggressive force or coercion).

== Other forms of alternative education ==
Many other forms of alternative education also prioritize student control of learning, albeit not necessarily by the individual learner. These include free democratic schools, like the Sudbury school, Stonesoup School, and open-learning virtual universities. Democratic schools gives students the ability to take classes as they please, as well as befriend children from all age groups (as the schools do not separate students into grades). Students can also practice the idea of democracy in many ways, as voting is a large part of their school experience.

== Criticism ==

As a form of homeschooling, unschooling faces many of the same critiques as homeschooling. Criticisms of unschooling in particular tend to focus on whether students can receive sufficient education in a context with so little structure compared to standard schooling practices. Some critics maintain that it can be difficult to build sufficient motivation in students to allow them to learn without guardrails, and that some students might be left behind as a result, and that they might fare poorly compared with their peers.

Opponents of unschooling fear that children may be at the mercy of bad parents, like those who withdraw their children from school without taking on the role of &quot;teacher.&quot; This leaves children directionless, which can affect them later in life if they have no practice expanding their curiosity and integrating into society.

In a 2006 study of children aged five to ten, unschooled children scored below traditionally schooled children in four of seven studied categories, and significantly below structured homeschoolers in all seven studied categories.

<doc id="159411" wikidata="Q910375" url="?curid=159411" title="Missiology">
<text>Missiology is the academic study of the Christian mission history and methodology. It began to be developed as an academic discipline in the 19th century.

== Definition ==
Broadly speaking, missiology is &quot;an interdisciplinary field of inquiry into Christian mission or missions that utilizes theological, historical, and various social scientific methods.&quot; It has historically focused on the missionary and evangelistic work of Protestant and Catholic denominations from Europe and North America into other continents. But the decline in Christian numbers in the West has been met by the rise of Evangelical and Pentecostal Christians in the Majority World &quot;for which mission and evangelism are their raison d&#x27;être.&quot;

Through missionary work in new contexts and the gradual shift in the World Christian population from the West to the non-Western world, Christians have had to grapple with new questions. While biblical and theologically rooted, missiology has therefore sought a deep engagement in the social sciences, in disciplines such as anthropology, history, geography, communication theory, comparative religious studies, social studies, education, psychology, and inter-religious relations. Missiology has thus included topics like inculturation, contextualization, interfaith relations, and reverse mission. 

== History ==
Missiology as an academic discipline appeared only in the 19th century. It was the Scottish missionary Alexander Duff who first developed a systematic theory of mission and was appointed in 1867 to the first chair in missiology in the world, the new chair of Evangelistic Theology in New College, Edinburgh. The chair was short-lived and closed after Duff&#x27;s departure.

Gustav Warneck is often recognized as the founder of Protestant missiology as a discipline. He founded the first scientific missionary periodical in 1874, &quot;Allgemeine Missions-Zeitschrift&quot;, and was appointed the chair of missionary science at the University of Halle in Germany in 1897. His three-volume work on Protestant mission theory &quot;Evangelische Missionlehre&quot; and his survey of the history of Protestant missionary work were extremely important for the young discipline.

Influenced by Warneck&#x27;s work, Catholic church historian began lecturing in missiology in 1910 at the University of Munster and was appointed to the first chair of Catholic missiology at the same university in 1914.

Since the 1950s, missiology has generally been discussed within the theological framework of the &quot;missio Dei&quot;, the &quot;Mission of God.&quot; This has shifted the discussion away from &quot;missions&quot; in the plural, an exclusive focus on the evangelizing of the non-Christian in overseas contexts, to &quot;mission&quot; in the singular, a broader topic including a multiplicity of God&#x27;s activities in the world. Hence, &quot;&quot;Mission is the participation of the people of God in God&#x27;s action in the world.&quot; The theological and critical reflection about mission is called &quot;missiology&quot;.&quot; 

== Current developments ==
Today missiology is taught at many Christian theological schools and its scope of study and relations with the other theological and social sciences differ to a great extent. While it continues to be considered a Christian theological discipline, some have contested whether missiology is a strictly church discipline or academic one.

There are several academic societies for missiology, such as the North American organizations the American Society of Missiology (ASM) and Evangelical Missiological Society (EMS), and the International Association for Mission Studies (IAMS). In European academia, especially in German-speaking contexts, there is the growing dominance of the term &quot;intercultural theology.&quot;

The close interaction between missiology, social sciences and culture made scholars to shape the discipline within the framework of history and sociology and remind about the &quot;colonial past of missions&quot; when Christians often attempted to use their political and economic power in evangelism. Many missiologists are now disavowing these methods and attempt to construct a new paradigm that does not employ such imperialistic approaches which lead to language and cultural imposition.

<text>James Michael Palosaari (January 12, 1939 – May 25, 2011) was an American evangelist and performer, one of the leaders in the Jesus Movement of the late 1960s and 1970s.

==Early life==
Palosaari was a first-generation American whose Finnish father emigrated through Ellis Island, New York. Born to John Palosaari (1901–1985) and Sara (née Leveck, 1905–1982) in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, he grew up on a goat farm near Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, where he attended Oconomowoc High School.

==Jesus Movement==

Palosaari became a Christian in Seattle, Washington during the Jesus Movement of the late 1960s. Trained in the faith by Linda Meissner, Palosaari and his wife Sue helped to form the nucleus of the Jesus People Army, establishing outposts in Yakima and Spokane, Washington; Boise, Idaho; and Vancouver, B.C. with Russell Griggs.

In Milwaukee, the Palosaaris began a coffeehouse, &quot;The Jesus Christ Power House,&quot; Sue started a newspaper, &quot;Street Level,&quot; Jim developed a new band, &quot;Sheep,&quot; and they began a communal school called &quot;Jesus People Discipleship Training Center&quot; which grew to 200 members. At this time Meissner and Griggs joined the Jesus People Army to the Children of God (later called the Family International), although Palosaari unsuccessfully tried to dissuade them. In 1972, 60 members were sent to join Bill Lowery&#x27;s tent ministry, &quot;Christ is the Answer&quot; (CITA), and a team of 30, including the band Charity, were sent out, later to reemerge in Chicago as Jesus People USA and &quot;Rez Band&quot;. Earlier revivals in Racine, Wisconsin, and Duluth, Minnesota, now became autonomous communes.

The Palosaaris and thirty members flew to Sweden as guests of the Full Gospel Business Men, in order to provide a foil for the Children of God in England. Upon arrival, the group spent substantial time in Finland, where Palosaari preached in Temppeliaukion Kirkko, the Stone Church in Helsinki. Sheep produced its first record, &quot;Karitsat Jeesus-rock&quot;, in Helsinki, Finland, sung partly in Finnish. From there the group toured for the next six months through Western Europe, including Germany and the Netherlands. The Jesus People entered Great Britain in the fall of 1972 to participate with Russell Griggs and David Hoyt in an exposé of the Children of God, at the invitation of financier Kenneth Frampton. With Frampton&#x27;s backing Palosaari, Hoyt and the group now calling itself the &quot;Jesus Family&quot;, enlarged by half, created the rock musical, &quot;Lonesome Stone,&quot; a musical history of the early &quot;Jesus Freaks.&quot; The musical opened at London&#x27;s Rainbow Theatre, eventually touring American air force bases throughout Germany, Great Britain, Canada, and the American Midwest, before closing four years later. While in England, Palosaari, Kenneth Frampton and British national, James Holloway, started what was for many years the largest Christian music festival in the world, Greenbelt.

A year later, the Palosaaris, Owen and Sandie Brock, and Paul and Lydia Jenkinson met to form another commune on Vancouver Island, B.C., Canada calling themselves &quot;Highway Missionary Society.&quot; Palosaari was the head elder of a council made up of men and women, developing their ideals of community, missionary work, and evangelism. The new group traveled constantly, and quickly formed a nucleus of followers. Palosaari put together the rock band Servant, which became the first Christian rock band to use lasers and an extensive light show. Servant produced six records and traveled throughout the U.S., Canada, and Great Britain, giving Petra their start when Petra opened for them. Community work also involved extensive showing of the movie &quot;Brother Sun, Sister Moon&quot;, about the life of Saint Francis of Assisi. Eventually the now enlarged communal group settled in Grants Pass, Oregon on land next to the Applegate River, where their interest in Christian community was supported through farming, work in town, and tree-planting. With Sue&#x27;s effort, the community now formed a children&#x27;s school. HMS sponsored Vietnamese and Laotian refugees coming into the country in the early 1980s. At this time Palosaari began Rooftop Records, producing one Servant album and sponsoring two other artists.

==Other work==

Palosaari spent his early adult years in the Chicago and the Detroit theater, including The Unstabled Theater run by Edith Carroll Canter and Woodie King, Jr. (Actress Lily Tomlin got her start in the same theater company the year Jim joined).

After leaving HMS, the Palosaaris left to study and work with YWAM on the Big Island of Hawaii, and Oahu. Jim Palosaari went to work in Texas with CITA, which he would continue to return to periodically over the next decade. During this time he also promoted new Christian rock groups, including Newsboys, PID, and Whitecross.

In his later years Palosaari worked extensively in charitable fundraising. He narrated the movie &quot;Frisbee: The Life and Death of a Hippie Preacher&quot;, the story of one of the earliest and most well-known Jesus Freak leaders, Lonnie Frisbee, released in DVD form in January, 2007.

==Personal life==

Palosaari was married four times. He married Joyce Warner in Detroit, in 1962, and moved to New York (Long Island) with his wife and stepson, Michael, about a year later. This union produced one son, Kent. Jim and Joyce were divorced in 1967. Jim and Jeanette Palosaari (not married) met in Wisconsin and became parents of a daughter, Sonja, in 1967. They moved together to southern California shortly after her birth. Shortly after his arrival in southern California Jim moved to northern California. In 1970, Jim married Susan Cowper, and had four children: Jedidiah, Seth, Cody, and Sophia. In 1981 Jim and Sue&#x27;s second oldest son, Seth, died in an automobile accident with two other members of the community. The couple was divorced in 1992.

Five years later, Palosaari married Susan Mattson, who died in 2008. In March 2011 Palosaari married Jo Sappenfield. They lived in Palosaari&#x27;s native state of Wisconsin until his death on May 25, 2011.

Palosaari was a self-described Democrat and socialist, committed less to party and politics than to the ideals of social justice, living in poverty, communal living, and a religious lifestyle in which everything is given up for God. He considered himself a Christian Primitivist, trying to live in the 20th century with the ideals of the 1st century Christians.

<text>Greenbelt Festival is a festival of arts, faith and justice held annually in England since 1974. Greenbelt has grown out of an evangelical Christian music festival with an audience of 1,500 young people into its current form, a more inclusive festival attended at its peak around 2010 by around 20,000, including Christians and those from other faiths.

The festival regularly attracts the biggest names of Christian music and many mainstream musicians. Those that have played the festival in the past include both new and established musicians, mostly playing rock, folk and pop music. This list includes The Alarm, U2, Moby, Cliff Richard, Ed Sheeran, Martyn Joseph, Steve Taylor, Midnight Oil, Amy Grant, Kevin Max, Lambchop, Goldie, Jamelia, After the Fire, The Proclaimers, Daniel Bedingfield, Eden Burning, Duke Special, Athlete and Sixpence None the Richer.

Greenbelt is also a venue for teaching and discussion about (but not exclusively within) the Christian faith, and has attracted number of Christian speakers, including Rowan Williams (the former archbishop of Canterbury) who is currently the festival&#x27;s patron. However, the festival also welcomes anyone who the organisers believe &#x27;speaks for justice&#x27;, and has had Anita Roddick, Peter Tatchell, Bill Drummond, and Billy Bragg sharing their thoughts.

More recently with its links to the NGO Christian Aid, Greenbelt has become heavily involved in campaigns for trade justice. The festival was one of the main catalysts for the huge Jubilee 2000 movement. Greenbelt is also a Christian showcase for performing arts, visual arts and alternative worship.

==History==
Greenbelt is a nomadic festival which has so far been held at seven different locations in England. While the venue has changed, the core event has remained the same: a celebration of faith, justice and arts with a particular Christian perspective.

The first Greenbelt Festival was held on a pig farm just outside the village of Charsfield near Woodbridge, Suffolk over the August 1974 bank holiday weekend, begun by Jim Palosaari, Kenneth Frampton, and James Holloway. Local fears concerning the festival in the weeks running up to it proved to be unfounded, but the festival did not return to the venue.

Between 1975 and 1981 the festival was held in the grounds of Odell Castle in Bedfordshire. The largest audiences for Greenbelt were during its two-year stay at Knebworth Park in Hertfordshire, 1982 and 1983.

1984 saw Greenbelt move to one of its longest-serving homes, Castle Ashby, Northamptonshire. While at Castle Ashby, Greenbelt began the practice of adopting an annual theme for the festival. Artists are encouraged to draw from the theme where possible.

Originally the 1992 festival was expected to be held at a new, permanent home on a farm a few miles away in Church Stowe. Greenbelt had finances in place to purchase the site, but met strong resistance from local residents. The plans collapsed and the festival returned to Castle Ashby one last time.

From 1993 to 1998 Greenbelt&#x27;s home was the grounds of Deene Park, Northamptonshire. Putting the plan to purchase a permanent site on hold, Greenbelt instead negotiated with Deene Park&#x27;s owner and invested in infrastructure improvements to this temporary site instead.

Following a downturn in audience figures and rising production costs, Greenbelt faced up to the inevitable in 1998: it was no longer financially viable to continue using the Deene Park site. A bold plan was devised. The 1998 event was pitched as the &quot;last Greenbelt of its kind&quot;, with two festivals planned for 1999: a youth-oriented event &quot;Freestate&quot; in partnership with Spring Harvest to be held the August Bank Holiday weekend and a more family-oriented &quot;Greenbelt&quot; to be held over the last weekend in July at Cheltenham Racecourse.

In early 1999 plans for Freestate collapsed and its embryonic programme was hastily rolled into the Greenbelt planned for Cheltenham. The 1999 Greenbelt Festival took place at Cheltenham but saw the lowest audiences since the 1970s. It remains the only Greenbelt to have taken place other than on an August Bank Holiday weekend.

Greenbelt emerged from its financial difficulties in the early 2000s with ever-increasing audiences for festivals held at Cheltenham. In its last years at Cheltenham, although audiences were beginning to fall, they were over 20,000, comparable in numbers to those of its &quot;glory days&quot; in the early 1980s. In 2014 Greenbelt moved to Boughton House, Northamptonshire, due to the planned redevelopment of Cheltenham Racecourse, as well as part of the site being unusable after severe weather during the 2012 festival caused flash flooding across parts of the racecourse. Since the move the festival has been scaled back after a drop in numbers and possibly due to the related loss of finances.

At the 2022 festival, Greenbelt announced that from 2023 they would bring the start and end dates forward to coincide with the festival&#x27;s 50th anniversary. Greenbelt 2023 began with festivalgoers gathering on Thursday 24th and programming running from the morning of Friday 25th to Sunday 27th, instead of Friday evening to Monday evening. The 2024 festival will follow the same pattern of dates running from 22 to 25 August 2024.

Although there is constant tension between its faith-based origins and a more exploratory attitude to engaging with the world, the perspective of the festival remains one rooted in the Christian tradition, and drawing Christian music lovers.

==Organisation==
Greenbelt is a registered charity and incorporated at Companies House. It is overseen by a board of trustees/directors who are responsible for its governance. A small staff team is supplemented by a large base of volunteers and a number of subcontractors.

==Reactions==
&quot;The Guardian&quot; sent Jessica Reed, a self-proclaimed atheist, to see the 2009 festival. Expecting to be turned off from the outset she mellowed to the point of admitting she became almost but finally finding that the evangelism &quot;lurked&quot; under the surface, she left.

A &quot;Huffington Post&quot; report said, &quot;How progressive politics, music and religion combine to make a festival where the loos are lovely and the people properly nice&quot;. The mix of Christians, environmental campaigners, Muslim clerics and atheists make this a heady mix, &quot;The 700 Club at play it ain&#x27;t.&quot;

<text>Urination is the release of urine from the bladder to the outside of the body. Urine is released through the urethra and exits the penis or vulva through the urinary meatus in placental mammals, but is released through the cloaca in other vertebrates. It is the urinary system&#x27;s form of excretion. It is also known medically as micturition, voiding, uresis, or, rarely, emiction, and known colloquially by various names including peeing, weeing, pissing, and euphemistically number one. The process of urination is under voluntary control in healthy humans and other animals, but may occur as a reflex in infants, some elderly individuals, and those with neurological injury. It is normal for adult humans to urinate up to seven times during the day.

In some animals, in addition to expelling waste material, urination can mark territory or express submissiveness. Physiologically, urination involves coordination between the central, autonomic, and somatic nervous systems. Brain centres that regulate urination include the pontine micturition center, periaqueductal gray, and the cerebral cortex.

==Anatomy and physiology==

===Anatomy of the bladder and outlet===

The main organs involved in urination are the urinary bladder and the urethra. The smooth muscle of the bladder, known as the detrusor, is innervated by sympathetic nervous system fibers from the lumbar spinal cord and parasympathetic fibers from the sacral spinal cord. Fibers in the pelvic nerves constitute the main afferent limb of the voiding reflex; the parasympathetic fibers to the bladder that constitute the excitatory efferent limb also travel in these nerves. Part of the urethra is surrounded by the male or female external urethral sphincter, which is innervated by the somatic pudendal nerve originating in the cord, in an area termed Onuf&#x27;s nucleus.

Smooth muscle bundles pass on either side of the urethra, and these fibers are sometimes called the internal urethral sphincter, although they do not encircle the urethra. Further along the urethra is a sphincter of skeletal muscle, the sphincter of the membranous urethra (external urethral sphincter). The bladder&#x27;s epithelium is termed transitional epithelium which contains a superficial layer of dome-like cells and multiple layers of stratified cuboidal cells underneath when evacuated. When the bladder is fully distended the superficial cells become squamous (flat) and the stratification of the cuboidal cells is reduced in order to provide lateral stretching.

===Physiology===
The physiology of micturition and the physiologic basis of its disorders are subjects about which there is much confusion, especially at the supraspinal level. Micturition is fundamentally a spinobulbospinal reflex facilitated and inhibited by higher brain centers such as the pontine micturition center and, like defecation, subject to voluntary facilitation and inhibition.

In healthy individuals, the lower urinary tract has two discrete phases of activity: the storage (or guarding) phase, when urine is stored in the bladder; and the voiding phase, when urine is released through the urethra. The state of the reflex system is dependent on both a conscious signal from the brain and the firing rate of sensory fibers from the bladder and urethra. At low bladder volumes, afferent firing is low, resulting in excitation of the outlet (the sphincter and urethra), and relaxation of the bladder. At high bladder volumes, afferent firing increases, causing a conscious sensation of urinary urge. Individual ready to urinate consciously initiates voiding, causing the bladder to contract and the outlet to relax. Voiding continues until the bladder empties completely, at which point the bladder relaxes and the outlet contracts to re-initiate storage. The muscles controlling micturition are controlled by the autonomic and somatic nervous systems. During the storage phase, the internal urethral sphincter remains tense and the detrusor muscle relaxed by sympathetic stimulation. During micturition, parasympathetic stimulation causes the detrusor muscle to contract and the internal urethral sphincter to relax. The external urethral sphincter (sphincter urethrae) is under somatic control and is consciously relaxed during micturition.

In infants, voiding occurs involuntarily (as a reflex). The ability to voluntarily inhibit micturition develops by the age of two–three years, as control at higher levels of the central nervous system develops. In the adult, the volume of urine in the bladder that normally initiates a reflex contraction is about .

====Storage phase====
During storage, bladder pressure stays low, because of the bladder&#x27;s highly compliant nature. A plot of bladder (intravesical) pressure against the depressant of fluid in the bladder (called a cystometrogram), will show a very slight rise as the bladder is filled. This phenomenon is a manifestation of the law of Laplace, which states that the pressure in a spherical viscus is equal to twice the wall tension divided by the radius. In the case of the bladder, the tension increases as the organ fills, but so does the radius. Therefore, the pressure increase is slight until the organ is relatively full. The bladder&#x27;s smooth muscle has some inherent contractile activity; however, when its nerve supply is intact, stretch receptors in the bladder wall initiate a reflex contraction that has a lower threshold than the inherent contractile response of the muscle.

Action potentials carried by sensory neurons from stretch receptors in the urinary bladder wall travel to the sacral segments of the spinal cord through the pelvic nerves. Since bladder wall stretch is low during the storage phase, these afferent neurons fire at low frequencies. Low-frequency afferent signals cause relaxation of the bladder by inhibiting sacral parasympathetic preganglionic neurons and exciting lumbar sympathetic preganglionic neurons. Conversely, afferent input causes contraction of the sphincter through excitation of Onuf&#x27;s nucleus, and contraction of the bladder neck and urethra through excitation of the sympathetic preganglionic neurons.

Diuresis (production of urine by the kidney) occurs constantly, and as the bladder becomes full, afferent firing increases, yet the micturition reflex can be voluntarily inhibited until it is appropriate to begin voiding.

====Voiding phase====

Voiding begins when a voluntary signal is sent from the brain to begin urination, and continues until the bladder is empty.

Bladder afferent signals ascend the spinal cord to the periaqueductal gray, where they project both to the pontine micturition center and to the cerebrum. At a certain level of afferent activity, the conscious urge to void or urination urgency, becomes difficult to ignore. Once the voluntary signal to begin voiding has been issued, neurons in the pontine micturition center fire maximally, causing excitation of sacral preganglionic neurons. The firing of these neurons causes the wall of the bladder to contract; as a result, a sudden, sharp rise in intravesical pressure occurs. The pontine micturition center also causes inhibition of Onuf&#x27;s nucleus, resulting in relaxation of the external urinary sphincter. When the external urinary sphincter is relaxed urine is released from the urinary bladder when the pressure there is great enough to force urine to flow out of the urethra. The micturition reflex normally produces a series of contractions of the urinary bladder.

The flow of urine through the urethra has an overall excitatory role in micturition, which helps sustain voiding until the bladder is empty.

Many men, and some women, may sometimes briefly shiver after or during urination.

After urination, the female urethra empties partially by gravity, with assistance from muscles. Urine remaining in the male urethra is expelled by several contractions of the bulbospongiosus muscle, and, by some men, manual squeezing along the length of the penis to expel the rest of the urine.

For land mammals over 1 kilogram, the duration of urination does not vary with body mass, being dispersed around an average of 21 seconds (standard deviation 13 seconds), despite a 4 order of magnitude (1000×) difference in bladder volume. This is due to increased urethra length of large animals, which amplifies gravitational force (hence flow rate), and increased urethra width, which increases flow rate. For smaller mammals a different phenomenon occurs, where urine is discharged as droplets, and urination in smaller mammals, such as mice and rats, can occur in less than a second. The posited benefits of faster voiding are decreased risk of predation (while voiding) and decreased risk of urinary tract infection.

====Voluntary control====
The mechanism by which voluntary urination is initiated remains unsettled. One possibility is that the voluntary relaxation of the muscles of the pelvic floor causes a sufficient downward tug on the detrusor muscle to initiate its contraction. Another possibility is the excitation or disinhibition of neurons in the pontine micturition center, which causes concurrent contraction of the bladder and relaxation of the sphincter.

There is an inhibitory area for micturition in the midbrain. After transection of the brain stem just above the pons, the threshold is lowered and less bladder filling is required to trigger it, whereas after transection at the top of the midbrain, the threshold for the reflex is essentially normal. There is another facilitatory area in the posterior hypothalamus. In humans with lesions in the superior frontal gyrus, the desire to urinate is reduced and there is also difficulty in stopping micturition once it has commenced. However, stimulation experiments in animals indicate that other cortical areas also affect the process.

The bladder can be made to contract by voluntary facilitation of the spinal voiding reflex when it contains only a few milliliters of urine. Voluntary contraction of the abdominal muscles aids the expulsion of urine by increasing the pressure applied to the urinary bladder wall, but voiding can be initiated without straining even when the bladder is nearly empty.
Voiding can also be consciously interrupted once it has begun, through a contraction of the perineal muscles. The external sphincter can be contracted voluntarily, which will prevent urine from passing down the urethra.

====Experience of urination====
The need to urinate is experienced as an uncomfortable, full feeling. It is highly correlated with the fullness of the bladder. In many males the feeling of the need to urinate can be sensed at the base of the penis as well as the bladder, even though the neural activity associated with a full bladder comes from the bladder itself, and can be felt there as well. In females the need to urinate is felt in the lower abdomen region when the bladder is full. When the bladder becomes too full, the sphincter muscles will involuntarily relax, allowing urine to pass from the bladder. Release of urine is experienced as a lessening of the discomfort.

===Disorders===

====Clinical conditions====
Many clinical conditions can cause disturbances to normal urination, including:

* Urinary incontinence, the inability to hold urine
** Stress incontinence, incontinence as a result of external mechanical disturbances
** Urge incontinence, incontinence that occurs as a result of the uncontrollable urge to urinate
** Mixed incontinence, a combination of the two types of incontinence
* Urinary retention, the inability to initiate urination
* Overactive bladder, a strong urge to urinate, usually accompanied by detrusor overactivity
* Interstitial cystitis, a condition characterized by urinary frequency, urgency, and pain
* Prostatitis, an inflammation of the prostate gland that can cause urinary frequency, urgency, and pain
* Benign prostatic hyperplasia, an enlargement of the prostate that can cause urinary frequency, urgency, retention, and the dribbling of urine
* Urinary tract infection, which can cause urinary frequency and dysuria
* Polyuria, abnormally large production of urine, associated with, in particular, diabetes mellitus (types 1 and 2), and diabetes insipidus
* Oliguria, low urine output, usually due to a problem with the upper urinary tract
* Anuria refers to absent or almost absent urine output.
* Micturition syncope, a vasovagal response which may cause fainting.
* Paruresis, the inability to urinate in the presence of others, such as in a public toilet.
* Bladder sphincter dyssynergia, a discoordination between the bladder and external urethral sphincter as a result of brain or spinal cord injury
A drug that increases urination is called a diuretic, whereas antidiuretics decrease the production of urine by the kidneys.

====Experimentally induced disorders====

There are three major types of bladder dysfunction due to neural lesions: (1) the type due to interruption of the afferent nerves from the bladder; (2) the type due to interruption of both afferent and efferent nerves; and (3) the type due to interruption of facilitatory and inhibitory pathways descending from the brain. In all three types the bladder contracts, but the contractions are generally not sufficient to empty the viscus completely, and residual urine is left in the bladder. Paruresis, also known as shy bladder syndrome, is an example of a bladder interruption from the brain that often causes total interruption until the person has left a public area. These people (males) may have difficulty urinating in the presence of others and will consequently avoid using urinals without dividers or those directly adjacent to another person. Alternatively, they may opt for the privacy of a stall or simply avoid public toilets altogether.

=====Deafferentation=====
When the sacral dorsal roots are cut in experimental animals or interrupted by diseases of the dorsal roots such as tabes dorsalis in humans, all reflex contractions of the bladder are abolished. The bladder becomes distended, thin-walled, and hypotonic, but there are some contractions because of the intrinsic response of the smooth muscle to stretch.

=====Denervation=====
When the afferent and efferent nerves are both destroyed, as they may be by tumors of the cauda equina or filum terminale, the bladder is flaccid and distended for a while. Gradually, however, the muscle of the &quot;decentralized bladder&quot; becomes active, with many contraction waves that expel dribbles of urine out of the urethra. The bladder becomes shrunken and the bladder wall hypertrophied. The reason for the difference between the small, hypertrophic bladder seen in this condition and the distended, hypotonic bladder seen when only the afferent nerves are interrupted is not known. The hyperactive state in the former condition suggests the development of denervation hypersensitization even though the neurons interrupted are preganglionic rather than postganglionic.

=====Spinal cord injury=====
During spinal shock, the bladder is flaccid and unresponsive. It becomes overfilled, and urine dribbles through the sphincters (overflow incontinence). After spinal shock has passed, a spinally mediated voiding reflex ensues, although there is no voluntary control and no inhibition or facilitation from higher centers. Some paraplegic patients train themselves to initiate voiding by pinching or stroking their thighs, provoking a mild mass reflex. In some instances, the voiding reflex becomes hyperactive. Bladder capacity is reduced and the wall becomes hypertrophied. This type of bladder is sometimes called the spastic neurogenic bladder. The reflex hyperactivity is made worse, and may be caused, by infection in the bladder wall.

==Techniques==

===Young children===

A common technique used in many developing nations involves holding the child by the backs of the thighs, above the ground, facing outward, in order to urinate.

===Fetal urination===

The fetus urinates hourly and produces most of the amniotic fluid in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. The amniotic fluid is then recycled by fetal swallowing.

===Urination after injury===
Occasionally, if a male&#x27;s penis is damaged or removed, or a female&#x27;s genitals/urinary tract is damaged, other urination techniques must be used. Most often in such cases, doctors will reposition the urethra to a location where urination can still be accomplished, usually in a position that would promote urination only while seated/squatting, though a permanent urinary catheter may be used in rare cases.

===Alternative urination tools===

Sometimes urination is done in a container such as a bottle, urinal, bedpan, or chamber pot (also known as a ). A container or wearable urine collection device may be used so that the urine can be examined for medical reasons or for a drug test, for a bedridden patient, when no toilet is available, or there is no other possibility to dispose of the urine immediately.

An alternative solution (for traveling, stakeouts, etc.) is a special disposable bag containing absorbent material that solidifies the urine within seconds, making it convenient and safe to store and dispose of later.

It is possible for both sexes to urinate into bottles in case of emergencies. The technique can help children to urinate discreetly inside cars and in other places without being seen by others. A female urination device can assist women and girls in urinating while standing or into a bottle.

In microgravity, excrement tends to float freely, so astronauts use a specially designed space toilet, which uses suction to collect and recycle urine; the space toilet also has a receptacle for defecation.

==Social and cultural aspects==
===Art===
A puer mingens is a figure in a work of art depicted as a prepubescent boy in the act of urinating, either actual or simulated. The puer mingens could represent anything from whimsy and boyish innocence to erotic symbols of virility and masculine bravado.

===Toilet training===
Babies have little socialized control over urination within traditions or families that do not practice elimination communication and instead use diapers. Toilet training is the process of learning to restrict urination to socially approved times and situations. Consequently, young children sometimes develop nocturnal enuresis.

===Facilities===
It is socially more accepted and more environmentally hygienic for those who are able, especially when indoors and in outdoor urban or suburban areas, to urinate in a toilet. Public toilets may have urinals, usually for males, although female urinals exist, designed to be used in various ways.

===Urination without facilities===
Acceptability of outdoor urination in a public place other than at a public urinal varies with the situation and with customs. Potential disadvantages include a dislike of the smell of urine, and exposure of genitals. It can be avoided or mitigated by going to a quiet place and/or facing a tree or wall if urinating standing up, or while squatting, hiding the back behind walls, bushes, or a tree.

Portable toilets (port-a-potties) are frequently placed in outdoor situations where no immediate facility is available. These need to be serviced (cleaned out) on a regular basis. Urination in a heavily wooded area is generally harmless, actually saves water, and may be condoned for males (and less commonly, females) in certain situations as long as common sense is used. Examples (depending on circumstances) include activities such as camping, hiking, delivery driving, cross country running, rural fishing, amateur baseball, golf, etc.

The more developed and crowded a place is, the more public urination tends to be objectionable. In the countryside, it is more acceptable than in a street in a town, where it may be a common transgression. Often this is done after the consumption of alcoholic beverages, which causes production of additional urine as well as a reduction of inhibitions. One proposed way to inhibit public urination due to drunkenness is the Urilift, which is disguised as a normal manhole by day but raises out of the ground at night to provide a public restroom for bar-goers.

In many places, public urination is punishable by fines, though attitudes vary widely by country. In general, females are less likely to urinate in public than males. Women and girls, unlike men and boys, are restricted in where they can urinate conveniently and discreetly.

The 5th-century BC historian Herodotus, writing on the culture of the ancient Persians and highlighting the differences with those of the Greeks, noted that to urinate in the presence of others was prohibited among Persians.

There was a popular belief in the UK, that it was legal for a man to urinate in public so long as it occurred on the rear wheel of his vehicle and he had his right hand on the vehicle, but this is not true. Public urination still remains more accepted by males in the UK, although British cultural tradition itself seems to find such practices objectionable.
In Islamic toilet etiquette, it is haram to urinate while facing the Qibla, or to turn one&#x27;s back to it when urinating or relieving bowels, but modesty requirements for females make it impossible for girls to relieve themselves without facilities. When toilets are unavailable, females can relieve themselves in Laos, Russia and Mongolia in emergency, but it remains less accepted for females in India even when circumstances make this a highly desirable option.

Women generally need to urinate more frequently than men, but as opposed to the common misconception, it is not due to having smaller bladders. Resisting the urge to urinate because of lack of facilities can promote urinary tract infections which can lead to more serious infections and, in rare situations, can cause renal damage in women. Female urination devices are available to help women to urinate discreetly, as well to help them urinate while standing.

===Sitting, standing, or squatting===
Techniques and body postures while urinating vary across cultures. Different anatomical conditions in men and women may presume different postures, yet these are largely shaped by cultural norms, types of clothing, and the sanitary facilities available. While sitting toilets are the most common form in Western countries, squat toilets are common in Asia, Africa, and the Arab world. Urinals for men are widespread worldwide, although women&#x27;s urinals are available in some countries, recently becoming more common in Western countries. With the spread of pants among women, a standing posture became impractical, but in some regions where women wear traditional skirts or robes, an upright posture is common.

====Males====

Cultures around the world differ regarding socially accepted voiding positions and preferences: in the Middle-East and Asia, the squatting position was more prevalent, while in the Western world the standing and sitting positions were more common. For practising Muslim men, the genital modesty of squatting is also associated with proper cleanliness requirements or awrah. In Western culture, the standing position is regarded as the more efficient option among healthy males. In restrooms without urinals, and sometimes at home, men may be urged to use the sitting position as to diminish spattering of urine.

Elderly males with prostate gland enlargement may benefit from sitting down to urinate, with the seated voiding position found superior as compared with standing in elderly males with benign prostate hyperplasia.

====Females====
In Western culture, females usually sit or squat for urination, depending on what type of toilet they use; a squat toilet is used for urination in a squatting position. Women averting contact with a toilet seat may employ a partial squatting position (or &quot;hovering&quot;), similar to using a female urinal. However, this may not completely void the bladder.

Females may also urinate while standing, and while clothed. It is common for women in various regions of Africa to use this position when they urinate, as do women in Laos. Herodotus described a similar custom in ancient Egypt. An alternative method for women voiding while standing is to use a female urination device to assist.

===Talking about urination===

In many societies and in many social classes, even mentioning the need to urinate is seen as a social transgression, despite it being a universal need. Many adults avoid stating that they need to urinate.

Many expressions exist, some euphemistic and some vulgar. For example, centuries ago the standard English word (both noun and verb, for the product and the activity) was &quot;&quot;, but subsequently &quot;pee&quot;, formerly associated with children, has become more common in general public speech. Since elimination of bodily wastes is, of necessity, a subject talked about with toddlers during toilet training, other expressions considered suitable for use by and with children exist, and some continue to be used by adults, e.g. &quot;weeing&quot;, &quot;doing/having a wee-wee&quot;, &quot;to tinkle&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;go pee pee&quot;.

Other expressions include &quot;squirting&quot; and &quot;taking a leak&quot;, and, predominantly by younger persons for outdoor female urination, &quot;popping a squat&quot;, referring to the position many women adopt in such circumstances. National varieties of English show creativity. American English uses &quot;to whiz&quot;. Australian English has coined &quot;I am off to take a Chinese singing lesson&quot;, derived from the tinkling sound of urination against the China porcelain of a toilet bowl. British English uses &quot;going to see my aunt&quot;, &quot;going to see a man about a dog&quot;, &quot;to piddle&quot;, &quot;to splash (one&#x27;s) boots&quot;, as well as &quot;to have a slash&quot;, which originates from the Scottish term for a large splash of liquid. One of the most common, albeit old-fashioned, euphemisms in British English is &quot;to spend a penny&quot;, a reference to coin-operated pay toilets, which used (pre-decimalisation) to charge that sum.

====Use in language====
References to urination are commonly used in slang. Usage in English includes:
* (to anger someone; alternatively, to leave somewhere in a hurry)
*&quot;Piss off!&quot; (to express contempt; see above)
*&quot;Pissing&quot; down (to refer to heavy rain)
*Pissing contest (an unproductive ego-driven battle)
*&quot;&quot; (vulgar way to refer to someone who drinks too much alcohol)
*&quot;Piss ant&quot; (a worthless person; in non-slang usage the term refers to several species of ant whose colonies have a urine-like odor)
*&quot;Pissing&quot; up a flagpole (to partake in a futile activity)
*&quot;Pissing&quot; into the wind (to act in ways that cause self-harm)
*&quot;&quot; (to squander or use wastefully)
*Taking the piss (to take liberties, be unreasonable, or to mock another person)
*&quot;Full of piss and vinegar&quot; (energetic or ambitious late adolescent or young adult male)
*&quot;Piss up&quot; (British expression for drinking to get drunk)
* &quot;Pissed&quot; (drunk in British English or angry in American English)

===Urination and sexual activity===

==== In humans ====
Urolagnia is a paraphilia related to the act, sight, or smell of urine or urination . Urine may be consumed, or the person may bathe in it; this is known colloquially as a golden shower. Involuntary urination during sexual intercourse is common, but rarely acknowledged. In one survey, 24% of women reported involuntary urination during sexual intercourse; in 66% of patients urination occurred on penetration, while in 33% urine leakage was restricted to orgasm.

==== In other animals ====
Female kob may exhibit urolagnia during sex; one female will urinate while the other sticks her nose in the stream. 

Some mammals urinate on themselves in order to attract mates during the rut or urinate on other individuals before mating with them. A male Patagonian mara, a type of rodent, will stand on his hind legs and urinate on a female&#x27;s rump, to which the female may respond by spraying a jet of urine backwards into the face of the male. The male&#x27;s urination is meant to repel other males from his partner while the female&#x27;s urination is a rejection of any approaching male when she is not receptive. Both anal digging and urination are more frequent during the breeding season and are more commonly done by males.

A male porcupine urinates on a female porcupine prior to mating, spraying the urine at high velocity.
== Electric shock injuries and deaths ==

In 2008 in London, a person died when they were urinating alongside a railway track at a train station and they received an electric shock. The person received the electric shock when their stream of urine connected with the electric current from the live third rail.

In 2010 in Washington state, a person who had died had received burns injuries on their body that were related to receiving an electric shock. It is thought that an electric current had traveled through their stream of urine and into their body. It is thought that the person had urinated into a roadside ditch and a live wire that was lying in the ditch gave the person an electric shock.

In 2014 in Spain, a person died while urinating on a lamp post when he received an electric shock, which may have traveled through the stream of urine and into his body.

==Other species==

While the primary purpose of urination is the same across the animal kingdom, urination often serves a social purpose beyond the expulsion of waste material. In dogs and other animals, urination can mark territory or express submissiveness. In small rodents such as rats and mice, it marks familiar paths.

The urine of animals of differing physiology or sex sometimes has different characteristics. For example, the urine of birds and reptiles is whitish, consisting of a pastelike suspension of uric acid crystals, and discharged with the feces of the animal via the cloaca, whereas mammals&#x27; urine is a yellowish colour, with mostly urea instead of uric acid, and is discharged via the urethra, separately from the feces. Some animals&#x27; (example: carnivores&#x27;) urine possesses a strong odour, especially when it is used to mark territory or 
Felids and canids scent-mark their territories using urine. Wolves mark their territories by urinating in a raised-leg posture and release preputial gland secretions in their urine. Male dogs mark their territories with urine more frequently than females.

Young cattle can be toilet-trained to urinate in a &quot;latrine&quot; where their urine can be collected for wastewater treatment, which could be used to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the animals&#x27; urine in countries such as the Netherlands, the United States, and New Zealand.

<text>Arab Americans ( or ) are Americans who trace ancestry to any of the various waves of immigrants from the Arabic-speaking countries. In the United States census, Arabs are racially classified as White Americans because &quot;White&quot; is defined as &quot;A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa&quot;.

According to the 2010 United States census, there are 1,698,570 Arab Americans in the United States. 290,893 persons defined themselves as simply &quot;Arab&quot;, and a further 224,241 as &quot;Other Arab&quot;. Other groups on the 2010 census are listed by nation of origin, and some may or may not be Arabs, or regard themselves as Arabs. The largest subgroup is by far the Lebanese Americans, with 501,907, followed by; Egyptian Americans with 190,078, Syrian Americans with 187,331, Iraqi Americans with 105,981, Moroccan Americans with 101,211, Palestinian Americans with 85,186, and Jordanian Americans with 61,664. Approximately 1/4 of all Arab Americans claimed two ancestries. A number of these ancestries are considered undercounted, given the nature of Ottoman immigration to the US during the 19th and early 20th centuries.

A number of ethnic and ethnoreligious groups in West Asia and North Africa that lived in majority Arab countries and are now resident in the United States are &quot;not&quot; always classified as Arabs but some may claim an Arab identity or a dual Arab/non-Arab identity; they include Assyrians, Jews (in particular Mizrahi Jews, some Sephardi Jews), Copts, Kurds, Iraqi Turkmens, Mandeans, Circassians, Shabaki, Armenians, Greeks, Italians, Yazidis, Persians, Kawliya/Romani, Syrian Turkmens, Berbers, and Nubians.

==Population==


The majority of Arab Americans, around 62%, originate from the region of the Levant, which includes Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, and Jordan, although overwhelmingly from Lebanon. The remainder are made up of those from Egypt, Morocco, Algeria, Iraq, Libya, the Gulf Cooperation Council, and other Arab nations.

There are nearly 3.5 million Arab Americans in the United States according to The Arab American Institute. Arab Americans live in all 50 states and in Washington, D.C., and 94% reside in the metropolitan areas of major cities. According to the 2010 US census, the city with the largest percentage of Arab Americans is Dearborn, Michigan, a southwestern suburb of Detroit, at nearly 40%. The Detroit metropolitan area is home to the largest concentration of Arab Americans (403,445), followed by the New York City Combined Statistical Area (371,233), Los Angeles (308,295), San Francisco Bay Area (250,000), Chicago (176,208), and the Washington, D.C., area (168,208). This information is reportedly based upon survey findings but is contradicted by information posted on the Arab American Institute website itself, which states that California as a whole only has 272,485, and Michigan as a whole only 191,607. The 2010 American Community Survey information, from the American Factfinder website, gives a figure of about 168,000 for Michigan.

Sorting by American states, according to the 2000 US census, 48% of the Arab American population, 576,000, reside in California, Michigan, New York, Florida, and New Jersey, respectively; these 5 states collectively have 31% of the net US population. Five other states – Illinois, Texas, Ohio, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania – report Arab American populations of more than 40,000 each. Also, the counties which contained the greatest proportions of Arab Americans were in California, Michigan, New York, Florida, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.

The cities with 100,000 or more in population with the highest percentages of Arabs are Sterling Heights, Michigan 3.69%; Jersey City, New Jersey 2.81%; Warren, Michigan 2.51%; Allentown, Pennsylvania 2.45%; Burbank, California 2.39% and nearby Glendale, California 2.07%; Livonia, Michigan 1.94%; Arlington County, Virginia 1.77%; Paterson, New Jersey 1.77%; and Daly City, California 1.69%. 

Bayonne, New Jersey, a city of 73,000, reported an Arab American population of 17.0% in the 2020 US census.

The US Census Bureau calculates the number of Arab Americans based on the number of people who claimed at least one Arab ancestry as one of their two ancestries. The Arab American Institute surveys the number of people of Arab descent in the US, regardless of the number of people who claimed Arab descent in the census. 
==Religious background==
According to the Arab American Institute based on the Zogby International Survey in 2002, the breakdown of religious affiliation among persons originating from Arab countries is as follows:

* 63% Christian
** 35% Roman/Eastern Catholic, including Roman Catholic, Maronite and Melkite
** 18% Orthodox, including Antiochian, Syrian, Greek, and Coptic 
** 10% Protestant
* 24% Muslim, including Sunni, Shia, and Druze
* 13% other or no affiliation

The percentage of Arab Americans who are Muslim has increased in recent years because most new Arab immigrants tend to be Muslim. In the past 10 years, most Arab immigrants were Muslim as compared to 15 to 30 years ago when they were mostly Christian. This stands in contrast to the first wave of Arab immigration to the US between the late 19th and early 20th centuries when almost all immigrants were Christians. Those Palestinians often Eastern Orthodox, otherwise Catholic and a few Episcopalians. A small number are Protestant adherents, either having joined a Protestant denomination after immigrating to the US or being from a family that converted to Protestantism while still living in the Eastern Mediterranean (European and American Protestant missionaries were fairly commonplace in the Levant in the late 19th and early 20th centuries).

Arab Christians, especially from Lebanon, Iraq, Palestine, Jordan, Syria, and Egypt, continued to immigrate to the US in the 2000s and form new enclaves and communities across the country.

The US is the second largest home of Druze communities outside the Middle East after Venezuela (60,000). According to some estimates there are about 30,000 to 50,000 Druzes in the US, with the largest concentration in Southern California. Most Druze immigrated to the US from Lebanon and Syria.

The New York City metropolitan area has a large population of Arab Jews and Mizrahi Jews. New York City and its suburbs in New Jersey have sizable Syrian Sephardi populations. Syrian Jews and other Jews from Arab countries may or may not identify as Arab Americans. When Syrian Jews first began to arrive in New York City during the late 1800s and early 1900s, Eastern European Ashkenazi Jews on the Lower East Side sometimes disdained their Syrian co-coreligionists as &quot;Arabische Yidden&quot;, Yiddish for &quot;Arab Jews&quot;. Some Ashkenazim doubted whether Sephardi or Mizrahi Jews from the Middle East were Jewish at all. In response, some Syrian Jews who were deeply proud of their ancient Jewish heritage, derogatorily dubbed Ashkenazi Jews as &quot;J-Dubs&quot;, a reference to the first and third letters of the English word &quot;Jew&quot;. In the 1990 US census, there were 11,610 Arab Jews in New York City, comprising 23 percent of the total Arab population of the city. Arab Jews in the city sometimes face anti-Arab racism. After the September 11 attacks, some Arab Jews in New York City were subjected to arrest and detention because they were suspected to be Islamist terrorists.

==Arab American identity==

In 2012, prompted in part by post-9/11 discrimination, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee petitioned the Department of Commerce&#x27;s Minority Business Development Agency to designate the MENA populations as a minority/disadvantaged community. Following consultations with MENA organizations, the Census Bureau announced in 2014 that it would establish a new MENA ethnic category for populations from West Asia, North Africa or the Arab world, separate from the white classification that these populations had previously sought in 1909. The expert groups, including some Jewish organizations, felt that the earlier white designation no longer accurately represents MENA identity, so they lobbied for a distinct categorization. The 2020 census did not include a separate MENA race category and collected detailed ethnicity information.

In the 2015 National Content Test (NCT) for the 2020 Census, the sampling strata for the new MENA category includes the Census Bureau&#x27;s working classification of 19 MENA groups, as well as Sudanese, Djiboutian, Somali, Mauritanian, Armenian, Cypriot, Afghan, Iranian, Azerbaijani, and Georgian groups.

On 28 March 2024, the Office of Management and Budget published revisions to Statistical Policy Directive No. 15: Standards for Maintaining, Collecting, and Presenting Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity that included the addition of &quot;Middle Eastern or North African&quot; to the race and/or ethnicity categories.

The Arab American Institute and other groups have noted that there was a rise in hate crimes targeting the Arab American community as well as people perceived as Arab/Muslim after the September 11 attacks and the US-led 2003 invasion of Iraq.

A new Zogby Poll International found that there are 3.5 million Americans who were identified as &quot;Arab-Americans&quot;, or Americans of ancestry belonging to one of the 23 UN member countries of the Arab World (these are not necessarily therefore Arabs). Poll finds that, overall, a majority of those identifying as Arab Americans are Lebanese Americans (largely as a result of being the most numerous group). The Paterson, New Jersey-based Arab American Civic Association runs an Arabic language program in the Paterson school district. Paterson, New Jersey has been nicknamed &quot;Little Ramallah&quot; and contains a neighborhood with the same name, with an Arab American population estimated as high as 20,000 in 2015. Neighboring Clifton, New Jersey, is following in Paterson&#x27;s footsteps, with rapidly growing Arab, Muslim, and Palestinian American populations.

==Politics==
In a 2007 Zogby poll, 62% of Arab Americans voted Democratic, while only 25% voted Republican. The percentage of Arabs voting Democratic increased sharply during the Iraq War. However, a number of prominent Arab American politicians are Republicans, including former Oregon Governor Victor Atiyeh, former New Hampshire Senator John E. Sununu, and California Congressman Darrell Issa, who was the driving force behind the state&#x27;s 2003 recall election that removed Democratic Governor Gray Davis from office. The first woman Supreme Court Chief Justice in Florida, Rosemary Barkett, who is of Syrian descent, is known for her dedication to progressive values.

Arab Americans gave George W. Bush a majority of their votes in 2000. However, they backed John Kerry in 2004 and Barack Obama in both 2008 and 2012. They also backed Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020.

According to a 2000 Zogby poll, 52% of Arab Americans were anti-abortion, 74% support the death penalty, 76% were in favor of stricter gun control, and 86% wanted to see an independent Palestinian state.

In a study, first-generation Arab Americans living in Detroit were found to have values more similar to that of the Arab world than those of the general population living in Detroit, on average, being more closely aligned to the strong traditional values and survival values. This was less the case when participants were secular or belonged to second and subsequent generations.

An 30 October 2023 poll by the Arab American Institute found that support for Biden among Arab Americans dropped from 59% in 2020 to 17%. The drop in support has been attributed to the administration&#x27;s handling of the 2023 Israel-Hamas War and Gaza genocide.

==Non-Arab Americans from Arab countries==
There are many US immigrants from the Arab world who are not always classified as Arabs because through much of the Arabized world, Arabs were considered a colonizing force and many ethnic groups maintained their ethnic cultural and religious heritage, oftentimes through syncretism. Among these are Armenian Americans, Assyrian Americans, Kurdish Americans, Jewish Americans of Mizrahi origin. Some of these groups, such as Assyrians, are Semitic language speakers, while the vast majority of the rest are not Semitic language speakers. It is very difficult to estimate the size of these communities. For example, some Armenians immigrated to the US from Lebanon, Syria, or Iraq. Estimates place these communities at least in the tens of thousands. Other smaller communities include Assyrians, Amazigh/Berber, Turks, Mandeans, Circassians, Shabaks, Georgians, Yazidis, Balochs, Iranians, Azerbaijanis, and Kawliya/Roma.

Most of these ethnic groups speak their own native languages (usually another Semitic language related to Arabic) and have their own customs, along with the Arabic dialect from the Arab country they originate from.

==Arab American Heritage Month==
In 2014, Montgomery County, Maryland, designated April as Arab American Heritage Month in recognition of the contributions that Arab Americans have made to the nation. Arab America and the Arab America Foundation launched the National Arab American Heritage Month initiative in 2017, with just a handful of states recognizing the initiative. Each year, the Arab America Foundation activates a grass-roots network of over 250 Arab American volunteers in 26 states. It gathers hundreds of proclamations from state governments, counties, municipalities, and local school districts. The first documentary on Arab Americans premiered on PBS in August 2017, &quot;The Arab Americans&quot; features the Arab American immigrant story as told through the lens of American History and the stories of prominent Arab Americans such as actor Jamie Farr, Ralph Nader, Senator George Mitchell, White House Reporter Helen Thomas, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Anthony Shadid, Danny Thomas actor and Founder of St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital, pollster and author John Zogby, Congressman Nick Rahall, racing legend Bobby Rahal. The documentary is produced and directed by Abe Kasbo.

The US Department of State has recognized April as the National Arab American Heritage Month, making it the highest level of federal recognition, yet. Stating in a public announcement on 1 April 2021, through their official social media channels: &quot;Americans of Arab heritage are very much a part of the fabric of this nation, and Arab Americans have contributed in every field and profession.&quot;

The recognition of the month of April as the National Arab American Heritage Month by the US Department of State was mainly influenced by independent advocate efforts across the United States calling for inclusivity. Most notably the petition and social change campaign by Pierre Subeh, who is a Middle-Eastern American business expert, executive producer, and author. He orchestrated a self-funded social awareness campaign with over 250 billboards across the country asking the Federal government to recognize the month of April as the National Arab American Heritage Month and issue an official proclamation. His social change campaign called the recognition to be critical as it celebrates Middle Eastern heritage in combating post-9/11 anti-Arab sentiments and recognizing the social difficulties that Arab Americans face every day in their communities.

In 2023, President Joe Biden issued an official proclamation on the Arab American Heritage Month.

==Festivals==
While the spectrum of Arab heritage includes 22 countries, their combined heritage is often celebrated in cultural festivals around the United States.

;New York City
The Annual Arab-American &amp; North African Street Festival was founded in 2002 by the Network of Arab-American Professionals of NY (NAAP-NY). Located in downtown Manhattan, on Great Jones Street between Lafayette &amp; Broadway, the Festival attracts an estimated 15,000 people, in addition to over 30 Arab and North African vendors along with an all-day live cultural performance program representing performers from across the Arab world.

The New York Arab American Comedy Festival was founded in 2003 by comedian Dean Obeidallah and comedian Maysoon Zayid. Held annually each fall, the festival showcases the talents of Arab American actors, comics, playwrights, and filmmakers, and challenges as well as inspires fellow Arab Americans to create outstanding works of comedy. Participants include actors, directors, writers and comedians.

<text>The Arab world, formally the Arab homeland, also known as the Arab nation, the Arabsphere, or the Arab states, comprises a large group of countries, mainly located in West Asia and North Africa. While the majority of people in the Arab world are ethnically Arab, there are also significant populations of other ethnic groups such as Berbers, Kurds, Somalis and Nubians, among other groups. Arabic is used as the lingua franca throughout the Arab world.

The Arab world is at its minimum defined as the 19 states where Arabs form at least a of the population. At its maximum it consists of the 22 members of the Arab League, an international organization, which on top of the 19 plurality Arab states also includes the Bantu-speaking Comoros, and the Cushitic-speaking Djibouti and Somalia. The region stretches from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to the Arabian Sea in the east, and from the Mediterranean Sea in the north to the Indian Ocean in the southeast. The eastern part of the Arab world is known as the Mashriq, and the western part as the Maghreb.

According to the World Bank, the Arab world has a total population of 456 million inhabitants and a gross domestic product of $2.85 trillion, as of 2021. The region is nevertheless diverse in many ways, and economically includes some of the wealthiest as well as poorest populations. The region mostly corresponds with the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) definition.

In post-classical history, the Arab world was synonymous with the historic Arab empires and caliphates. Arab nationalism arose in the second half of the 19th century along with other nationalist movements within the Ottoman Empire. The Arab League was formed in 1945 to represent the interests of Arab people and especially to pursue the political unification of the Arab countries, a project known as Pan-Arabism.

== Terminology ==
In page 9 of &quot;Best Divisions for Knowledge of the Regions&quot;, 10th century Arab geographer Al Maqdisi used the term &quot;Arab regions&quot; to refer to the lands of the Arabian Peninsula (Bahrain, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen). He also considered Iraq, alongside Upper Mesopotamia (Iraq, Syria and Turkey), Ash-Sham (Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Syria and Turkey), Egypt and the Maghreb (Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia and Western Sahara Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic) to be part of the Arab regions.

Malta, an island country in Southern Europe whose national language derives from Arabic (through Sicilian Arabic), is not included in the region. Similarly, Chad, Eritrea and Israel recognize Arabic as one of their official or working languages but are not included in the region because they are not members of the Arab League.

==Definition==
The linguistic and political denotation inherent in the term &quot;Arab&quot; is generally dominant over genealogical considerations. In Arab states, Standard Arabic is used by the government. Local vernacular languages are referred to as &quot;Darija&quot; ( &quot;everyday/colloquial language&quot;) in the Maghreb or &quot;Aammiyya&quot; ( &quot;common language&quot;) in the Mashreq. The majority of the vocabulary in these vernaculars is shared with Standard Arabic, but some of them also significantly borrow from other languages, such as Berber, French, Spanish and Italian in the Maghreb.

===Standard territorial===

Although no globally accepted definition of the Arab world exists, all countries that are members of the Arab League are generally acknowledged as being part of the Arab world.

The Arab League is a regional organisation that aims, among other things, to consider in a general way the affairs and interests of the Arab countries and sets out the following definition of an Arab:
This standard territorial definition is sometimes seen to be inappropriate or problematic, and may be supplemented with certain additional elements (see ancillary linguistic definition below).

====Member states of the Arab League====

===Ancillary linguistic===

As an alternative to, or in combination with, the standard territorial definition, the Arab world may be defined as consisting of peoples and states united to at least some degree by Arabic language, culture or geographic contiguity, or those states or territories in which the majority of the population speaks Arabic, and thus may also include populations of the Arab diaspora.

When an ancillary linguistic definition is used in combination with the standard territorial definition, various parameters may be applied to determine whether a state or territory should be included in this alternative definition of the Arab world. These parameters may be applied to the states and territories of the Arab League (which constitute the Arab world under the standard definition) and to other states and territories. Typical parameters that may be applied include: whether Arabic is widely spoken; whether Arabic is an official or national language; or whether an Arabic cognate language is widely spoken.

While Arabic dialects are spoken in a number of Arab League states, Literary Arabic is official in all of them. Several states have declared Arabic to be an official or national language, although Arabic is not as widely spoken there. As members of the Arab League, however, they are considered part of the Arab world under the standard territorial definition.

Somalia has two official languages, Arabic and Somali, while Somaliland has three, Arabic, Somali and English. Both Arabic and Somali belong to the larger Afro-Asiatic language family. Although Arabic is widely spoken by many people in the north and urban areas in the south, Somali is the most widely used language, and contains many Arabic loan words.

Similarly, Djibouti has two official languages, Arabic and French. It also has several formally recognized national languages; besides Somali, many people speak Afar, which is also an Afro-Asiatic language. The majority of the population speaks Somali and Afar, although Arabic is also widely used for trade and other activities.

The Comoros has three official languages: Arabic, Comorian and French. Comorian is the most widely spoken language, with Arabic having a religious significance, and French being associated with the educational system.

Chad, Eritrea and Israel all recognize Arabic as an official or working language, but none of them is a member-state of the Arab League, although both Chad and Eritrea are observer states of the League (with possible future membership) and have large populations of Arabic speakers.

Israel is not a part of the Arab world. By some definitions, Arab citizens of Israel may concurrently be considered a constituent part of the Arab world.

Iran has about 1.5 million Arabic speakers. Iranian Arabs are mainly found in Ahvaz, a southwestern region in the Khuzestan Province; others inhabit the Bushehr and Hormozgan provinces and the city of Qom. Mali and Senegal recognize Hassaniya, the Arabic dialect of the Moorish ethnic minority, as a national language. Greece and Cyprus also recognize Cypriot Maronite Arabic under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Additionally, Malta, though not part of the Arab world, has as its official language Maltese. The language is grammatically akin to Maghrebi Arabic.

==Demographics==

In the Arab world, Modern Standard Arabic, derived from Classical Arabic (symptomatic of Arabic diglossia), serves as an official language in the Arab League states, and Arabic dialects are used as lingua franca. Various indigenous languages are also spoken, which predate the spread of the Arabic language. This contrasts with the situation in the wider Islamic world, where, in contiguous Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan, the Perso-Arabic script is used and Arabic is the primary liturgical language, but the tongue is not official at the state level or spoken as a vernacular. Arabs constitute around one quarter of the 1.5 billion Muslims in the Islamic world.

===Religion===

The majority of people in the Arab world adhere to Islam, and the religion has official status in most countries. Shariah law exists partially in the legal system in some countries (especially in the Arabian Peninsula), while others are legislatively secular. The majority of the Arab countries adhere to Sunni Islam. Iraq and Bahrain, however, are Shia majority countries, while Lebanon, Yemen, and Kuwait have large Shia minorities. In Saudi Arabia, Ismailite pockets are also found in the eastern Al-Hasa region and the southern city of Najran. Ibadi Islam is practiced in Oman, where Ibadis constitute around 75% of Muslims.

There are also Christian adherents in the Arab world, particularly in Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Jordan, and Palestine. Small native Christian communities can be found also throughout the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa. Coptic, Maronite and Assyrian Christian enclaves exist in the Nile Valley, Levant and northern Iraq respectively. There are also Assyrian, Armenian and Arab Christians throughout Iraq, Syria, Palestine, Lebanon and Jordan, with Aramean communities in Maaloula and Jubb&#x27;adin in Syria. There are also native Arab Christian communities in Algeria, Bahrain, Morocco, Kuwait and Tunisia.

Smaller ethno-religious minorities across the Arab League include the Yezidis, Yarsan and Shabaks (mainly in Iraq), the Druzes (mainly in Syria and also in Lebanon, Jordan) and Mandaeans (in Iraq). Formerly, there were significant minorities of Jews throughout the Arab World. However, the Arab–Israeli conflict prompted their mass exodus between 1948 and 1972. Today small Jewish communities remain, ranging anywhere from just 10 in Bahrain, to more than 400 in Iraq and Syria, 1,000 in Tunisia and some 3,000 in Morocco.

===Education===
According to UNESCO, the average rate of adult literacy (ages 15 and older) in this region is 78%. In Mauritania the rate is lower than the average, at less than 50%. Bahrain, Palestine, Kuwait, Qatar, and Jordan record a high adult literacy rate of over 95%. The average rate of adult literacy shows steady improvement, and the absolute number of adult illiterates fell from 64 million to around 58 million between 1990 and 2000–2004.

Overall, the gender disparity in adult literacy is high in this region, and of the illiteracy rate, women account for two-thirds, with only 69 literate women for every 100 literate men. The average GPI (Gender Parity Index) for adult literacy is 0.72, and gender disparity can be observed in Egypt, Morocco, and Yemen. Above all, the GPI of Yemen is only 0.46 in a 53% adult literacy rate.

Literacy rate is higher among the youth than adults. Youth literacy rate (ages 15–24) in the Arab region increased from 63.9 to 76.3% from 1990 to 2002. The average rate of GCC States *Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC)

Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC) was 94%, followed by the Maghreb at 83.2% and the Mashriq at 73.6%.

The United Nations published an Arab human development report in 2002, 2003 and 2004. These reports, written by researchers from the Arab world, address some sensitive issues in the development of Arab countries: women empowerment, availability of education and information among others.

===Film industry===

There is no single description of Arab cinema since it includes films from various countries and cultures of the Arab world and therefore does not have one form, structure, or style. In its inception, Arab cinema was mostly an imitation of Western cinema. However, it has and continues to constantly change and evolve. It mostly includes films made in Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Kuwait, Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia. Egypt is a pioneer in the field, but each country in the region has its own unique cinema.

Elsewhere in North Africa and the Middle East, film production was scarce until the late 1960s and early 1970s when filmmakers began to receive funding and financial assistance from state organizations. This was during the post-independence and is when most Arab cinema took root. Most films produced at that time were funded by the state and contained a nationalistic dimension. These films helped to advance certain social causes such as independence, and other social, economic and political agendas.

A sustained film industry was able to emerge in Egypt when other parts of the Arab world had only been able to sporadically produce feature-length films due to limited financing.

Arabic cinema is dominated by films from Egypt. Three quarters of all Arab movies are produced in Egypt. According to film critic and historian Roy Armes, the cinema of Lebanon is the only other in the Arabic-speaking region, beside Egypt&#x27;s, that could amount to a national cinema.

While Egyptian and Lebanese cinema have a long history of production, most other Arab countries did not witness film production until after independence, and even today, the majority of film production in countries like Bahrain, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and the United Arab Emirates is limited to television or short films.

There is increased interest in films originating in the Arab world. For example, films from Algeria, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine, Syria and Tunisia are making wider and more frequent rounds than ever before in local film festivals and repertoire theaters.

Arab cinema has explored many topics from politics, colonialism, tradition, modernity and social taboos. It has also attempted to escape from its earlier tendency to mimic and rely on Western film devices. In fact, colonization did not only influence Arab films, but it also had an impact on Arab movies theaters. Apart from the history of Arab cinema, recently the portrayal of women became an important aspect in the production of Arab cinema. Arab women shaped a great portion of the film industry in the Arab world by employing their cinematic talents in improving the production of Arab films.

The production of Arab cinema has declined in the last decades and many filmmakers in the Middle East gathered to hold a meeting and discuss the current state of Arab cinema.

===Gender equality and women&#x27;s rights===

Women in the Arab world are still denied equality of opportunity, although their disenfranchisement is a critical factor crippling the Arab nations&#x27; quest to return to the first rank of global leaders in commerce, learning and culture, according to a United Nations-sponsored report in 2008.

==History==
===Early history===

The Arabs historically originate as a Central Semitic group in southern Levant and northern Arabian peninsula. Arab tribes and federations such as Nabataeans, Tanukhids, Salihids, Ghassanids, and numerous other groups were prevalent in southern Levant (Syrian Desert) and northern Arabia. Their expansion beyond Arabia and the Syrian desert is due to the Muslim conquests of the 7th and 8th centuries. Iraq was conquered in 633, Levant (modern Syria, Israel, Palestine, Jordan and Lebanon ) between 636 and 640 CE.

Egypt was conquered in 639, and gradually Arabized during the medieval period. A distinctively Egyptian Arabic language emerged by the 16th century.

The Maghreb was also conquered in the 7th century, and gradually Arabized under the Fatimids.
Islam was brought to Sudan from Egypt during the 8th to 11th centuries.

The culture of Sudan today depends on the tribe, some have a pure Nubian, Beja, or Arabic culture and some have a mixture of Arab and Nubian elements.

===Ottoman and colonial rule===
The Arab Abbasid Caliphate fell to the Mongol invasions in the 13th century. Egypt, the Levant and Hejaz also came under the Turkish Mamluk Sultanate.

By 1570, the Turkish Ottoman Empire controlled most of the Arab world. However, Morocco remained under the rule of the Zenata Wattasid dynasty, which was succeeded by the Saadi dynasty in the 16th to 17th centuries. The Ajuran Sultanate also held sway in the southern part of the Horn region.

The sentiment of Arab nationalism arose in the second half of the 19th century along with other nationalisms within the declining Ottoman Empire.

When the Ottoman Empire collapsed as a result of World War I, much of the Arab world came to be controlled by the European colonial empires: Mandatory Palestine, Mandatory Iraq, British protectorate of Egypt, French protectorate of Morocco, Italian Libya, French Tunisia, French Algeria, Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon and the so-called Trucial States, a British protectorate formed by the sheikhdoms on the former &quot;Pirate Coast&quot;.

These Arab states only gained their independence during or after World War II: the Republic of Lebanon in 1943, the Syrian Arab Republic and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in 1946, the Kingdom of Libya in 1951, the Kingdom of Egypt in 1952, the Kingdom of Morocco and Tunisia in 1956, the Republic of Iraq in 1958, the Somali Republic in 1960, Algeria in 1962, and the United Arab Emirates in 1971.

By contrast, Saudi Arabia had fragmented with the fall of the Ottoman Empire, and was unified under Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia by 1932.

The Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen also seceded directly from the Ottoman Empire in 1918. Oman, apart from brief intermittent Persian and Portuguese rule, has been self-governing since the 8th century.

===Rise of Arab nationalism===
The Arab League was formed in 1945 to represent the interests of the Arabs, and especially to pursue the political unification of the Arab world, a project known as Pan-Arabism.
There were some short-lived attempts at such unification in the mid-20th century, notably the United Arab Republic of 1958 to 1961.
The Arab League&#x27;s main goal is to unify politically the Arab populations so defined. Its permanent headquarters are located in Cairo. However, it was moved temporarily to Tunis during the 1980s, after Egypt was expelled for signing the Camp David Accords (1978).

Pan-Arabism has mostly been abandoned as an ideology since the 1980s, and was replaced by Pan-Islamism on one hand, and individual nationalisms on the other.

===Modern conflicts===
====Unification of Saudi Arabia====
The unification of Saudi Arabia was a 30-year-long military and political campaign, by which the various tribes, sheikhdoms, and emirates of most of the Arabian Peninsula were conquered by the House of Saud, or &quot;Al Saud&quot;, between 1902 and 1932, when the modern-day Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was proclaimed. Carried out under the charismatic Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud, this process created what is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Third Saudi State&quot;, to differentiate it from the first and second states that existed under the Al Saud clan.

The Al-Saud had been in exile in Ottoman Iraq since 1893 following the disintegration of the Second Saudi State and the rise of Jebel Shammar under the Al Rashid clan. In 1902, Ibn Saud recaptured Riyadh, the Al Saud dynasty&#x27;s former capital. He went on to subdue the rest of Nejd, Al-Hasa, Jebel Shammar, Asir, and Hejaz (location of the Muslim holy cities of Mecca and Medina) between 1913 and 1926. The resultant polity was named the Kingdom of Nejd and Hejaz from 1927 until it was further consolidated with Al-Hasa and Qatif into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932.

====Arab–Israeli conflict====
The establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 has given rise to the Arab–Israeli conflict, one of the major unresolved geopolitical conflicts.

The Arab states in changing alliances were involved in a number of wars with Israel and its western allies between 1948 and 1973, including the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the 1956 Suez Crisis, the Six-Day War of 1967, and the Yom Kippur War of 1973.
An Egypt–Israel peace treaty was signed in 1979.

====Iran–Iraq War====
The Iran–Iraq War (also known as the First Gulf War and by various other names) was an armed conflict between the armed forces of Iraq and Iran, lasting from September 1980 to August 1988, making it the second longest conventional war of the 20th century. It was initially referred to in English as the &quot;Gulf War&quot; prior to the &quot;Gulf War&quot; of 1990.

The war began when Iraq invaded Iran, launching a simultaneous invasion by air and land into Iranian territory on 22 September 1980 following a long history of border disputes, and fears of Shia Islam insurgency among Iraq&#x27;s long-suppressed Shia majority influenced by the Iranian Revolution. Iraq was also aiming to replace Iran as the dominant Persian Gulf state. Although Iraq hoped to take advantage of the revolutionary chaos in Iran (see Iranian Revolution, 1979) and attacked without formal warning, they made only limited progress into Iran and were quickly repelled by the Iranians who regained virtually all lost territory by June 1982. For the next six years, Iran was on the offensive.

====Lebanese Civil War====

The Lebanese Civil War was a multifaceted civil war in Lebanon, lasting from 1975 to 1990 and resulting in an estimated 120,000 fatalities. Another one million people (a quarter of the population) were wounded, and today approximately 76,000 people remain displaced within Lebanon. There was also a mass exodus of almost one million people from Lebanon.

====Western Sahara conflict====

The Western Sahara War was an armed struggle between the Sahrawi Polisario Front and Morocco between 1975 and 1991, being the most significant phase of the Western Sahara conflict. The conflict erupted after the withdrawal of Spain from the Spanish Sahara in accordance with the Madrid Accords, by which it transferred administrative control of the territory to Morocco and Mauritania, but not the sovereignty. In 1975, Moroccan government organized the Green March of some 350,000 Moroccan citizens, escorted by around 20,000 troops, who entered Western Sahara, trying to establish Moroccan presence.

While at first met with just minor resistance by the Polisario, Morocco later engaged a long period of guerilla warfare with the Sahrawi nationalists. During the late 1970s, the Polisario Front, desiring to establish an independent state in the territory, successively fought both Mauritania and Morocco. In 1979, Mauritania withdrew from the conflict after signing a peace treaty with the Polisario. The war continued in low intensity throughout the 1980s, though Morocco made several attempts to take the upper hand in 1989–1991. A cease-fire agreement was finally reached between the Polisario Front and Morocco in September 1991.

====North Yemen Civil War====

The North Yemen Civil War was fought in North Yemen between royalists of the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen and factions of the Yemen Arab Republic from 1962 to 1970. The war began with a coup d&#x27;état carried out by the republican leader, Abdullah as-Sallal, which dethroned the newly crowned Imam al-Badr and declared Yemen a republic under his presidency. The Imam escaped to the Saudi Arabian border and rallied popular support.

====Somali Civil War====

The Somali Civil War is an ongoing civil war taking place in Somalia. It began in 1991, when a coalition of clan-based armed opposition groups ousted the nation&#x27;s long-standing military government.

Various factions began competing for influence in the power vacuum that followed, which precipitated an aborted UN peacekeeping attempt in the mid-1990s. A period of decentralization ensued, characterized by a return to customary and religious law in many areas as well as the establishment of autonomous regional governments in the northern part of the country. The early 2000s saw the creation of fledgling interim federal administrations, culminating in the establishment of the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) in 2004.

In 2006, the TFG, assisted by Ethiopian troops, assumed control of most of the nation&#x27;s southern conflict zones from the newly formed Islamic Courts Union (ICU). The ICU splintered into more radical groups, notably Al-Shabaab, which have since been fighting the Somali government and its AMISOM allies for control of the region. In 2011, a coordinated military operation between the Somali military and multinational forces began, which is believed to represent one of the final stages in the war&#x27;s Islamist insurgency.

====Arab Spring====
The popular protests throughout the Arab world of late 2010 to the present have been directed against authoritarian leadership and associated political corruption, paired with demands for more democratic rights. The two most violent and prolonged conflicts in the aftermath of the Arab Spring are the Libyan Civil War and Syrian Civil War.

===Petroleum===

While the Arab world had been of limited interest to the European colonial powers, the British Empire being mostly interested in the Suez Canal as a route to British India, the economic and geopolitical situation changed dramatically after the discovery of large petroleum deposits in the 1930s, coupled with the vastly increased demand for petroleum in the west as a result of the Second Industrial Revolution.

The Persian Gulf is particularly well-endowed with this strategic raw material: five Persian Gulf states, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the UAE, Kuwait, and Qatar, are among the top ten petroleum or gas exporters worldwide. In Africa, Algeria (10th world) and Libya are important gas exporters. Bahrain, Egypt, Tunisia, and Sudan all have smaller but significant reserves. Where present, these have had significant effects on regional politics, often enabling rentier states, leading to economic disparities between oil-rich and oil-poor countries, and, particularly in the more sparsely populated states of the Persian Gulf and Libya, triggering extensive labor immigration. It is believed that the Arab world holds approximately 46% of the world&#x27;s total proven oil reserves and a quarter of the world&#x27;s natural-gas reserves.

Islamism and Pan-Islamism were on the rise during the 1980s. The Hezbollah, a militant Islamic party in Lebanon, was founded in 1982.
Islamic terrorism became a problem in the Arab world in the 1970s to 1980s. While the Muslim Brotherhood had been active in Egypt since 1928, their militant actions were limited to assassination attempts on political leaders.

===Recent history===
Today, Arab states are characterized by their autocratic rulers and lack of democratic control. The 2016 &quot;Democracy Index&quot; classifies Lebanon, Iraq and Palestine as &quot;hybrid regimes&quot;, Tunisia as a &quot;flawed democracy&quot; and all other Arab states as &quot;authoritarian regimes&quot;. Similarly, the 2011 Freedom House report classifies the Comoros and Mauritania as &quot;electoral democracies&quot;, Lebanon, Kuwait and Morocco as &quot;partly free&quot;, and all other Arab states as &quot;not free&quot;.

The invasion of Kuwait by Iraq forces, led to the 1990–91 Persian Gulf War. Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia joined a multinational coalition that opposed Iraq. Displays of support for Iraq by Jordan and Palestine resulted in strained relations between many of the Arab states. After the war, a so-called &quot;Damascus Declaration&quot; formalized an alliance for future joint Arab defensive actions between Egypt, Syria, and the GCC states.

A chain of events leading to the destabilization of the authoritarian regimes established during the 1950s throughout the Arab world became apparent during the early years of the 21st century. The 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq led to the collapse of the Baathist regime and ultimate execution of Saddam Hussein.

A growing class of young, educated, secular citizens with access to modern media such as Al Jazeera (since 1996) and communicating via the internet began to form a third force besides the classical dichotomy of Pan-Arabism vs. Pan-Islamism that had dominated the second half of the 20th century. These citizens wish for reform in their country&#x27;s religious institutions.

In Syria, the Damascus Spring of 2000 to 2001 heralded the possibility of democratic change, but the Baathist regime managed to suppress the movement.

In 2003, the Egyptian Movement for Change, popularly known as &quot;Kefaya&quot;, was launched to oppose the Mubarak regime and to establish democratic reforms and greater civil liberties in Egypt.

==States and territories==
For the states and territories constituting the Arab world, see definition above.

===Forms of government===

Different forms of government are represented in the Arab World: Some of the countries are monarchies: Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The other Arab countries are all republics. With the exception of Lebanon, Tunisia, Iraq, Palestine, and recently Mauritania, democratic elections throughout the Arab World are generally viewed as compromised, due to outright vote rigging, intimidation of opposition parties, and severe restraints on civil liberties and political dissent.

After World War II, Pan-Arabism sought to unite all Arabic-speaking countries into one political entity. Only Syria, Iraq, Egypt, Sudan, Tunisia, Libya and North Yemen considered the short-lived unification of the United Arab Republic. Historical divisions, competing local nationalisms, and geographical sprawl were major reasons for the failure of Pan-Arabism. Arab Nationalism was another strong force in the region which peaked during the mid-20th century and was professed by many leaders in Egypt, Algeria, Libya, Syria, and Iraq. Arab Nationalist leaders of this period included Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, Ahmed Ben Bella of Algeria, Michel Aflaq, Salah al-Din al-Bitar, Zaki al-Arsuzi, Constantin Zureiq and Shukri al-Kuwatli of Syria, Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr of Iraq, Habib Bourguiba of Tunisia, Mehdi Ben Barka of Morocco, and Shakib Arslan of Lebanon.

Later and current Arab Nationalist leaders include Muammar al-Gaddafi of Libya, Hafez al-Assad and Bashar al-Assad of Syria. The diverse Arab states generally maintained close ties but distinct national identities developed and strengthened with the social, historical and political realities of the past 60 years. This has made the idea of a pan-Arab nation-state increasingly less feasible and likely. Additionally, an upsurge in political Islam has since led to a greater emphasis on pan-Islamic rather than pan-Arab identity amongst some Arab Muslims. Arab nationalists who once opposed Islamic movements as a threat to their power, now deal with them differently for reasons of political reality.

===Modern boundaries===
Many of the modern borders of the Arab World were drawn by European imperial powers during the 19th and early 20th century. However, some of the larger states (in particular Egypt and Syria) have historically maintained geographically definable boundaries, on which some of the modern states are roughly based. The 14th-century Egyptian historian Al-Maqrizi, for instance, defines Egypt&#x27;s boundaries as extending from the Mediterranean in the north to lower Nubia in the south; and between the Red Sea in the east and the oases of the Western/Libyan desert. The modern borders of Egypt, therefore, are not a creation of European powers, and are at least in part based on historically definable entities which are in turn based on certain cultural and ethnic identifications.

At other times, kings, emirs or sheikhs were placed as semi-autonomous rulers over the newly created nation states, usually chosen by the same imperial powers that for some drew the new borders, for services rendered to European powers like the British Empire, e.g. Sherif Hussein ibn Ali. Many African states did not attain independence until the 1960s from France after bloody insurgencies for their freedom. These struggles were settled by the imperial powers approving the form of independence given, so as a consequence almost all of these borders have remained. Some of these borders were agreed upon without consultation of those individuals that had served the colonial interests of Britain or France. One such agreement solely between Britain and France (to the exclusion of Sherif Hussein ibn Ali), signed in total secrecy until Lenin released the full text, was the Sykes-Picot Agreement. Another influential document written without the consensus of the local population was the Balfour Declaration.

As former director of the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, Efraim Halevy, now a director at the Hebrew University said,

He went on to give an example,
Historian Jim Crow, of Newcastle University, has said:

===Modern economies===

As of 2006, the Arab world accounts for two-fifths of the gross domestic product and three-fifths of the trade of the wider Muslim world.

The Arab states are mostly, although not exclusively, developing economies and derive their export revenues from oil and gas, or the sale of other raw materials. Recent years have seen significant economic growth in the Arab World, due largely to an increase in oil and gas prices, which tripled between 2001 and 2006, but also due to efforts by some states to diversify their economic base. Industrial production has risen, for example the amount of steel produced between 2004 and 2005 rose from 8.4 to 19 million tonnes. (Source: Opening speech of Mahmoud Khoudri, Algeria&#x27;s Industry Minister, at the 37th General Assembly of the Iron &amp; Steel Arab Union, Algiers, May 2006). However even 19 million tons pa still only represents 1.7% of global steel production, and remains inferior to the production of countries like Brazil.

The main economic organisations in the Arab World are the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), comprising the states in the Persian Gulf, and the Union of the Arab Maghreb (UMA), made up of North African States. The GCC has achieved some success in financial and monetary terms, including plans to establish a common currency in the Persian Gulf region. Since its foundation in 1989, the UMA&#x27;s most significant accomplishment has been the establishment of a 7,000 km highway crossing North Africa from Mauritania to Libya&#x27;s border with Egypt. The central stretch of the highway, expected to be completed in 2010, will cross Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. In recent years a new term has been coined to define a greater economic region: the MENA region, standing for &quot;Middle East and North Africa&quot;, is becoming increasingly popular, especially with support from the current US administration.As of August 2009 it was reported that Saudi Arabia is the strongest Arab economy according to World Bank.

Saudi Arabia remains the top Arab economy in terms of total GDP. It is Asia&#x27;s eleventh largest economy, followed by Egypt and Algeria, which were the second and third largest economies in Africa, after South Africa, in 2006. In terms of GDP per capita, Qatar is the richest developing country in the world.

The total GDP of all Arab countries in 1999 was US$531.2 billion. The total Arab world GDP was estimated to be worth at least $2.8 trillion in 2011. This is only smaller than the GDP of the US, China, Japan and Germany.

==Geography==

The Arab World stretches across more than of North Africa and the part of North-East Africa and South-West Asia. The eastern part of the Arab world is called the &quot;Mashriq&quot;. Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Libya and Mauritania are the &quot;Maghreb&quot; or &quot;Maghrib&quot;.

The term &quot;Arab&quot; often connotes the Arabian Peninsula, but the larger (and more populous) part of the Arab World is North Africa. Its eight million square kilometers include two of the largest countries of the African continent, Algeria (2.4 million km2) in the center of the region and Sudan (1.9 million km2) in the southeast. Algeria is about three-quarters the size of India, or about one-and-a-half times the size of Alaska, the largest state in the United States. The largest country in the Arab West Asia is Saudi Arabia (2 million km2).

At the other extreme, the smallest autonomous mainland Arab country is Lebanon (10,452 km2), and the smallest island Arab country is Bahrain (665 km2).

Every Arab country borders a sea or ocean, with the exception of the Arab region of northern Chad, which is completely landlocked. Iraq is actually nearly landlocked, as it has only a very narrow access to the Persian Gulf.

===Historical boundaries===
The political borders of the Arab world have wandered, leaving Arab minorities in non-Arab countries of the Sahel and the Horn of Africa as well as in the Middle Eastern countries of Cyprus, Turkey and Iran, and also leaving non-Arab minorities in Arab countries. However, the basic geography of sea, desert and mountain provides the enduring natural boundaries for this region.

The Arab world straddles two continents, Africa and Asia. It is mainly oriented along an east–west axis.

The West Asian Arab region comprises the Arabian Peninsula, most of the Levant (excluding Cyprus and Israel), most of Mesopotamia (excluding parts of Turkey and Iran) and the Persian Gulf region. The peninsula is roughly a tilted rectangle that leans back against the slope of northeast Africa, the long axis pointing toward Turkey and Europe.

Arab North Africa comprises the entire northern third of the continent. It is surrounded by water on three sides (west, north, and east) and desert or desert scrubland on the fourth (south).

In the west, it is bounded by the shores of the Atlantic Ocean. From northeast to southwest, Morocco, Western Sahara (mostly unilaterally annexed by Morocco), and Mauritania make up the roughly 2,000 kilometers of Arab Atlantic coastline. The southwestern sweep of the coast is gentle but substantial, such that Mauritania&#x27;s capital, Nouakchott (18°N, 16°W), is far enough west to share longitude with Iceland (13–22°W). Nouakchott is the westernmost capital of the Arab World and the third-westernmost in Africa, and sits on the Atlantic fringe of the southwestern Sahara. Next south along the coast from Mauritania is Senegal, whose abrupt border belies the gradient in culture from Arab to indigenous African that historically characterizes this part of West Africa.

Arab Africa&#x27;s boundary to the north is again a continental boundary, the Mediterranean Sea. This boundary begins in the west with the narrow Strait of Gibraltar, the thirteen kilometer wide channel that connects the Mediterranean with the Atlantic to the west, and separates Morocco from Spain to the north. East along the coast from Morocco are Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya, followed by Egypt, which forms the region&#x27;s, and the continent&#x27;s, northeastern corner. The coast turns briefly but sharply south at Tunisia, slopes more gently southeastward through the Libyan capital of Tripoli, and bumps north through Libya&#x27;s second city, Benghazi, before turning straight east again through Egypt&#x27;s second city, Alexandria, at the mouth of the Nile. Along with the spine of Italy to its north, Tunisia marks the junction of western and eastern Mediterranean, and a cultural transition as well: west of Egypt begins the region of the Arab World known as the Maghreb include (Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Mauritania).

Historically the 4,000-kilometer Mediterranean boundary has fluttered. Population centers north of it in Europe have invited contact and Arab exploration—mostly friendly, though sometimes not. Islands and peninsulas near the Arab coast have changed hands. The islands of Sicily and Malta lie just a hundred kilometers east of the Tunisian city of Carthage, which has been a point of contact with Europe since its founding in the first millennium BCE; both Sicily and Malta at times have been part of the Arab World. Just across the Strait of Gibraltar from Morocco, regions of the Iberian peninsula were part of the Arab World throughout the Middle Ages, extending the northern boundary at times to the foothills of the Pyrenees and leaving a substantial mark on local and wider European and Western culture.

The northern boundary of the African Arab world has also fluttered briefly in the other direction, first through the Crusades and later through the imperial involvement of France, Britain, Spain, and Italy. Another visitor from northern shores, Turkey, controlled the east of the region for centuries, though not as a colonizer. Spain still maintains two small enclaves, Ceuta and Melilla (called &quot;Morocco Espanol&quot;), along the otherwise Moroccan coast. Overall this wave has ebbed, though like the Arab expansion north it has left its mark. The proximity of North Africa to Europe has always encouraged interaction, and this continues with Arab immigration to Europe and European interest in the Arab countries today. However, population centers and the physical fact of the sea keeps this boundary of the Arab World settled on the Mediterranean coastline.

To the east, the Red Sea defines the boundary between Africa and Asia, and thus also between Arab Africa and Arab West Asia. This sea is a long and narrow waterway with a northwest tilt, stretching 2,300 kilometers from Egypt&#x27;s Sinai peninsula southeast to the Bab-el-Mandeb strait between Djibouti in Africa and Yemen in Arabia but on average just 150 kilometers wide. Though the sea is navigable along its length, historically much contact between Arab Africa and Arab West Asia has been either overland across the Sinai or by sea across the Mediterranean or the narrow Bab al Mendeb strait. From northwest to southeast, Egypt, Sudan, and Eritrea form the African coastline, with Djibouti marking Bab al Mendeb&#x27;s African shore.

Southeast along the coast from Djibouti is Somalia, but the Somali coast soon makes a 90-degree turn and heads northeast, mirroring a bend in the coast of Yemen across the water to the north and defining the south coast of the Gulf of Aden. The Somali coast then takes a hairpin turn back southwest to complete the horn of Africa. For six months of the year the monsoon winds blow from up equatorial Somalia, past Arabia and over the small Yemeni archipelago of Socotra, to rain on India. They then switch directions and blow back.

The east- and especially southeast-coast boundary of Arab Africa has historically been a gateway for maritime trade and cultural exchange with both East Africa and the subcontinent. The trade winds help explain the presence of the Comoros islands, an Arab-African country, off the coast of Mozambique, near Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, the southernmost part of the Arab World.

The southern boundary of Arab North Africa is the strip of scrubland known as the Sahel that crosses the continent south of the Sahara.

<text>Mordred or Modred ( or ; Welsh: Medraut or Medrawt) is a major figure in the legend of King Arthur. The earliest known mention of a possibly historical Medraut is in the Welsh chronicle &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot;, wherein he and Arthur are ambiguously associated with the Battle of Camlann in a brief entry for the year 537. Medraut&#x27;s figure seemed to have been regarded positively in the early Welsh tradition and may have been related to that of Arthur&#x27;s son. As Modredus, Mordred was depicted as Arthur&#x27;s traitorous nephew and a legitimate son of King Lot in the pseudo-historical work &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, which then served as the basis for the subsequent evolution of the legend from the 12th century. Later variants most often characterised Mordred as Arthur&#x27;s villainous bastard son, born of an incestuous relationship with his half-sister, the queen of Lothian or Orkney named either Anna, Orcades, or Morgause. The accounts presented in the &quot;Historia&quot; and most other versions include Mordred&#x27;s death at Camlann, typically in a final duel, during which he manages to mortally wound his own slayer, Arthur. Mordred is usually a brother or half-brother to Gawain; however, his other family relations, as well as his relationships with Arthur&#x27;s wife Guinevere, vary greatly.

In a popular telling, originating from the French chivalric romances of the 13th century and made prominent today through its inclusion in &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, Mordred is a power-hungry son of Arthur from the incest with Morgause, prophesied by Merlin and destined to bring Britain to ruin. He survives Arthur&#x27;s attempt to get rid of him soon after his birth and, years later, joins his half-brothers Gawain, Agravain, Gaheris and Gareth in Arthur&#x27;s fellowship of the Round Table as a young and immoral knight. Eventually, Mordred learns of his true parentage and becomes the main actor in Arthur&#x27;s downfall as he helps Agravain to expose the illicit love affair between Guinevere and Lancelot and then takes advantage of the resulting civil war to make himself the high king of Britain, ultimately leading to both his own and Arthur&#x27;s deaths in their battle. Today, he remains an iconic character in many modern adaptations of Arthurian legend, in which he usually appears as a villain and often as the archenemy of Arthur.

==Name==
The name &quot;Mordred&quot;, found as the Latinised &quot;Modredus&quot; in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, comes from Old Welsh &quot;Medraut&quot; (comparable to Old Cornish &quot;Modred&quot; and Old Breton &quot;Modrot&quot;). It may be ultimately derived from Latin &quot;Moderātus&quot;, meaning &quot;within bounds, observing moderation, moderate&quot; with some influence from Latin &quot;mors&quot;, &quot;death&quot;.

==Early Welsh sources==
The earliest surviving mention of Mordred (referred to as Medraut) is found in an entry for the year 537 in the chronicle &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot; (&quot;The Annals of Wales&quot;), which references his name in an association with the Battle of Camlann.

This brief entry gives no information as to whether Mordred killed Arthur or was killed by Arthur, if they were fighting against one another at all, if they were fighting on the same side, or even if they died in the battle or were just defeated. As noted by Leslie Alcock, the reader assumes conflict between the two in the light of later tradition. The &quot;Annales&quot; themselves were completed between 960 and 970, meaning that (although their authors likely drew from older material) they cannot be considered a contemporary source, having been compiled 400 years after the events they describe.

Meilyr Brydydd, writing at the same time as Geoffrey of Monmouth, mentions Mordred in his lament for the death of Gruffudd ap Cynan (d. 1137). He describes Gruffudd as having &quot;eissor Medrawd&quot; (&quot;the nature of Medrawd&quot;), as to have valour in battle. Similarly, Gwalchmai ap Meilyr praised Madog ap Maredudd, king of Powys (d. 1160) as having &quot;Arthur gerdernyd, menwyd Medrawd&quot; (&quot;Arthur&#x27;s strength, the good nature of Medrawd&quot;). This would support the idea that early perceptions of Mordred were largely positive.

However, Mordred&#x27;s later characterisation as the king&#x27;s villainous son has a precedent in the figure of Amr (or Amhar), a son of Arthur&#x27;s known from only two references. The more important of these, found in an appendix to the 9th-century chronicle &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; (&quot;The History of the Britons&quot;), describes his marvelous grave beside the Herefordshire spring where he had been slain by his own father in some unchronicled tragedy. What connection exists between the stories of Amr and Mordred, if there is one, has never been satisfactorily explained.

An early 12th-century Italian high relief known as the Modena Archivolt seems to show a scene of abduction of Guinevere inspired by an original Welsh Arthurian tradition, perhaps as retold by Breton and other continental bards in their otherwise unrecorded oral stories. While often interpreted as that of Melwas, a mysterious figure identified as Mardoc may instead represent Mordred.

==Depictions in legend==
In Geoffrey&#x27;s influential &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (&quot;The History of the Kings of Britain&quot;), written around 1136, Modredus (Mordred) is portrayed as the nephew of and traitor to King Arthur. Geoffrey might have based his Modredus on the early 6th-century &quot;high king&quot; of Gwynedd, Maglocunus (Maelgwn), whom the 6th-century writer Gildas had described as an usurper, or on Mandubracius, a 1st-century BC king of the Trinovantes. The unhistorical account presented by Geoffrey narrates Arthur leaving Modredus in charge of his throne as he crosses the English Channel to wage war on Lucius Tiberius of Rome. During Arthur&#x27;s absence, Modredus crowns himself as King of the Britons and lives in an adulterous union with Arthur&#x27;s wife, Guenhuvara (Guinevere). Geoffrey does not make it clear how complicit Guenhuvara is with his actions, simply stating that the Queen had &quot;broken her vows&quot; and &quot;about this matter... [he] prefers to say nothing.&quot; Arthur returns to Britain and they fight at the Battle of Camlann, where Modredus is ultimately slain. Arthur, having been gravely wounded in battle, is sent off to be healed by Morgen in Avalon.

A number of other Welsh sources also refer to Medraut, usually in relation to Camlann. One Welsh Triad, based on Geoffrey&#x27;s &quot;Historia&quot;, provides an account of his betrayal of Arthur; in another, he is described as the author of one of the &quot;Three Unrestrained Ravagings of the Isle of Britain&quot; – he came to Arthur&#x27;s court at Kelliwic in Cornwall, devoured all of the food and drink, and even dragged Gwenhwyfar (Guinevere) from her throne and beat her. In another Triad, however, he is described as one of &quot;men of such gentle, kindly, and fair words that anyone would be sorry to refuse them anything.&quot; The &quot;Mabinogion&quot; also describes him in terms of courtliness, calmness, and purity.

===Life in romances===
The 12th-century poems of the emerging chivalric romance genre such as those by Chrétien de Troyes, dealing with the adventures of various knights during Arthur&#x27;s reign, would typically not mention Mordred at all. This changed through the 13th century, as the Old French cyclical prose romance literature greatly expanded on the history of Mordred prior to the war against Arthur. In the Prose &quot;Merlin&quot; part of the Vulgate Cycle (in which his name is sometimes written as &quot;Mordret&quot;), Mordred&#x27;s elder half-brother Gawain saves the infant Mordred and their mother Morgause from being taken away as prisoners by the Saxon king Taurus. In the revision known as the Post-Vulgate Cycle, and consequently in Thomas Malory&#x27;s English compilation &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; (&quot;The Death of Arthur&quot;), Arthur is told a cryptic (and, apparently, self-fulfilling) prophecy by Merlin about a newly-born child that is to be his undoing, and so he tries to avert his fate by ordering to get rid of all May Day newborns. Whether they were intended to be killed or merely sent off to a distant land (the texts are vague about this), the ship on which the children were placed sinks and they drown. This episode, sometimes dubbed the &quot;May Day massacre&quot;, leads to a war between Arthur and the furious King Lot, acting on his belief that he is the biological father of Mordred. Lot dies in a battle at the hands of Arthur&#x27;s vassal king Pellinore, beginning a long and deadly blood feud between the two royal families. Meanwhile, however, and unknown to both Lot and Arthur, the baby miraculously survives. It turns out Mordred was found and rescued by a fisherman and his wife, who then raise him as their own son until he is 14. In this branch of the legend, following his early life as a commoner, the young Mordred is later reunited with his mother, which happens long after Merlin&#x27;s downfall caused by the Lady of the Lake.

In any case, the grown-up Mordred becomes involved in the adventures of his brothers (having grown to become the tallest among them), first as a squire and then as a knight, as well as others such as Brunor. Eventually, he joins King Arthur&#x27;s elite fellowship of the Knights of the Round Table. Since the Post-Vulgate, however, Mordred tends to be depicted as murderously violent and known for his unchivalrious and lustful habits, including engaging in rape (as in an incident in the Post-Vulgate &quot;Queste&quot;, when he brutally kills a maiden and is injured for his actions by King Bagdemagus, who is then in turn mortally wounded by Gawain; there is also an attempted rape in the standalone romance &quot;Claris et Laris&quot;). Notably, it is Mordred who fatally stabs Pellinore&#x27;s son in the back, later doing the same to one of the best Knights of the Round Table, Lamorak, in an unfair fight involving most of his brothers (one of whom had even murdered their own mother for being Lamorak&#x27;s lover). Mordred displays stronger knightly values in the Vulgate Cycle (as does Gawain too in comparison to his later Post-Vulgate portrayal), where he is also shown as womanising and murderous, but to a significantly lesser degree. In the Prose &quot;Lancelot&quot;, he becomes a protege and companion of the eponymous great knight Lancelot. The older knight comes to the young Mordred&#x27;s rescue on multiple occasions, such as helping to save his life at the Castle of the White Thorn (&quot;Castel de la Blanche Espine&quot;), and Mordred in turn treats the much older Lancelot as his personal hero. In this version, his turning point toward villainy happens after they meet an old hermit monk who begins to tell his own prophecy for the two &quot;most unfortunate knights&quot;, revealing Mordred&#x27;s true parentage by Arthur and predicting Mordred&#x27;s and Lancelot&#x27;s respective roles in the coming ruin of Arthur&#x27;s kingdom. However, the angry Mordred kills the monk before he can finish. While Lancelot tells his secret lover Guinevere (but not Arthur), she refuses to believe in the story of the prophecy and does not banish Mordred. The young knight, on his part, tries to get himself killed before accepting his destiny. The Prose &quot;Lancelot&quot; indicates Mordred was about 22 years old at the time, as well as just two years into his knighthood.

Eventually, Mordred overthrows Arthur&#x27;s rule when the latter is engaged in the war against Lancelot (or during the second Roman War that followed it, depending on the version). In the Vulgate &quot;Mort Artu&quot;, Mordred achieves his coup with the help of a letter supposedly sent by the dying Arthur but actually forged by Mordred. The &quot;Mort Artu&quot; narration adds that &quot;there was much good in Mordred, and as soon as he made himself elevated to the throne, he made himself well beloved by all,&quot; and so they were &quot;ready to die to defend [his] honor&quot; once Arthur did return with his army. Mordred&#x27;s few opponents during his brief rule included Kay, who was gravely wounded by Mordred&#x27;s supporters and died after fleeing to Brittany. In the Vulgate &quot;Mort Artu&quot;, Arthur proposes himself as a regent, while in the French-influenced English poem Stanzaic &quot;Morte Arthur&quot;, the council of Britain&#x27;s knights first elects Mordred for the position in Arthur&#x27;s absence as the most worthy candidate. The Alliterative &quot;Morte Arthure&quot; is a unique text in which Mordred is presented as not only a possibly better ruler than Arthur but also as reluctant to be left by Arthur in charge of Britain. In the later romances, as in the chronicles, the returning Arthur&#x27;s veteran army is ambushed and nearly destroyed by Mordred&#x27;s supporters and foreign allies during their sea landing at Dover, where Gawain is mortally wounded while fighting as Arthur&#x27;s loyalist. Afterwards, a series of inconclusive engagements follows, until both sides agree to all meet each other at the one final battle, in which Mordred typically fights exceptionally well while commanding the loyalty of thousands of men willing to lay down their lives for him against Arthur.

===Death===
In Henry of Huntingdon&#x27;s retelling of Geoffrey&#x27;s &quot;Historia&quot;, Mordred is beheaded at Camlann in a lone charge against him and his entire host by Arthur himself, who suffers many injuries in the process. In the Alliterative &quot;Morte Arthure&quot;, Mordred first kills Gawain by his own hand in an early battle against Arthur&#x27;s landing forces and then deeply grieves after him. In the Vulgate &quot;Mort Artu&quot; (and consequently in Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;), the terrible final battle begins by accident during a last-effort peace meeting between him and Arthur. In the ensuing fighting, Mordred personally slays his cousin Ywain after the latter&#x27;s rescue of the unhorsed Arthur, and decapitates the already badly wounded Sagramore. He also kills Sagramore in addition to six other Round Table knights loyal to Arthur in the Post-Vulgate depiction of the battle, which presents this as an incredible and unprecedented feat. These and many other versions of the legend feature the motif of Arthur and Mordred striking down each other in a duel after most of the others on both sides have died. Furthermore, the Post-Vulgate says it was only the death of Sagramore, here depicted as Mordred&#x27;s own foster brother, that finally motivates Arthur to kill his son immediately afterwards.

&quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; features the now-iconic scene where the two meet on foot as Arthur charges Mordred and runs a spear through him. With the last of his strength, Mordred impales himself even further to come within striking distance, and lands a mortal blow with his sword to King Arthur&#x27;s head. Malory&#x27;s telling is a variant of the original account from the Vulgate &quot;Mort Artu&quot;, in which Arthur and Mordred both charge at each other on horses three times until Arthur drives his lance through Mordred&#x27;s body, but then fully withdraws it (a ray of sunlight even shines through the hole) before Mordred&#x27;s sword powerfully strikes his head and they both fall from their saddles. The Alliterative &quot;Morte Arthure&quot; has Mordred grievously wound Arthur with the ceremonial sword Clarent, stolen for him from Arthur by his co-conspirator Guinevere, but then Arthur slashes off Mordred&#x27;s sword arm and brutally skewers him up on the sword Caliburn (Excalibur). One copy of the Welsh text &quot;Ymddiddan Arthur a&#x27;r Eryr&quot; has the dying Arthur tell Guinevere how he struck Mordred nine times with Caledfwlch (another name variant of Excalibur).

The Post-Vulgate retelling of &quot;Mort Artu&quot; deals with the aftermath of Mordred&#x27;s death in more detail than the earlier works. In it, Arthur says before being taken away: &quot;Mordred, in an evil hour did I beget you. You have ruined me and the kingdom of Logres, and you have died for it. Cursed be the hour in which you were born.&quot; One of the few survivors of Arthur&#x27;s army, Bleoberis, then drags Mordred&#x27;s corpse behind a horse around the battlefield of Salisbury Plain until it is torn to pieces. Later, as it had been commanded by the dying Arthur, the Archbishop of Canterbury constructs the Tower of the Dead tomb memorial, from which Bleoberis hangs Mordred&#x27;s head as a warning against treason. It remains there for centuries until it is removed by the visiting Ganelon. Conversely, Margam Abbey&#x27;s chronicle &quot;Annales de Margan&quot; claims Arthur is buried alongside Mordred, here described as his nephew, in another tomb purportedly exhumed in the &quot;real Avalon&quot; at Glastonbury Abbey.

There have also been alternative stories of Mordred&#x27;s demise. Thomas Grey&#x27;s &quot;Scalacronica&quot; attributes the killing of Mordred to Ywan (Ywain) at Camlann. In the Italian &quot;La Tavola Ritonda&quot; (&quot;The Round Table&quot;), it is Lancelot who kills Mordred at the castle of Urbano where Mordred has besieged Guinevere after Arthur&#x27;s death. In &quot;Ly Myreur des Histors&quot; (&quot;The Mirror of History&quot;) by writer Jean d&#x27;Outremeuse, Mordred survives the great battle and rules with the traitorous Guinevere until they are defeated and captured by Lancelot and King Carados in London. Guinevere is then executed by Lancelot, and Mordred is entombed alive with her body, which he consumes before dying of starvation.

==Family relations==


Traditions vary regarding Mordred&#x27;s relationship to Arthur. Medraut is never considered Arthur&#x27;s son in Welsh texts, only his nephew, though &quot;The Dream of Rhonabwy&quot; mentions that the king had been his foster father. In early literature derived from Geoffrey&#x27;s &quot;Historia&quot;, Mordred was considered the legitimate son of Arthur&#x27;s sister or half-sister queen named Anna or Gwyar and her husband Lot, the king of either Lothian or Orkney. Today, however, he is best known as Arthur&#x27;s own illegitimate son by his beautiful half-sister and Lot&#x27;s wife, known as Morgause (Orcades / Morcades / Morgawse / Margawse), the Queen of Orkney. This motif was introduced in the Vulgate Cycle, in which their union happens at the time when neither of them have yet known of their blood relation and she was not married yet. Accounts of Mordred&#x27;s incestuous origin story (including two different variants in just the different parts of the main version of the Vulgate Cycle) present the circumstances of it variably, attributing various degrees of blame or innocence to either party of the teenage (usually aged 15) Arthur&#x27;s tryst with his much older (mother to children almost his age) half-sister.

Her eldest son Gawain has been Mordred&#x27;s brother already in the &quot;Historia&quot; as well as in Layamon&#x27;s &quot;Brut&quot;. Besides him, Mordred&#x27;s other brothers or half-brothers often appearing in literature include Agravain and Gaheris in the tradition derived from the French romances, beginning with the prose versions of Robert de Boron&#x27;s poems &quot;Merlin&quot; and &quot;Perceval&quot;. Another of the brothers, Gareth, joined them in the later versions. In the Vulgate &quot;Lancelot&quot;, Mordred is the youngest of the siblings who begins his knightly career as Agravain&#x27;s own squire, and the two of them later conspire to reveal Lancelot&#x27;s affair with Guinevere, resulting in Agravain&#x27;s death and consequently the civil war between Arthur&#x27;s and Lancelot&#x27;s factions. In stark contrast to many modern works, Mordred&#x27;s only interaction with Arthur&#x27;s other sister Morgan in any medieval text occurs in the Post-Vulgate &quot;Queste&quot;, when all the Orkney brothers visit Morgan&#x27;s castle and are informed by her about Guinevere&#x27;s infidelity.

In the &quot;Historia&quot; and certain other texts, such as the Alliterative &quot;Morte Arthure&quot; reimagination of the &quot;Historia&quot; where Mordred is portrayed sympathetically, Mordred marries Guinevere (usually his aunt) consensually after he takes over the throne. However, in later writings like the &quot;Lancelot-Grail&quot; cycle and &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, Guinevere (now the wife of Mordred&#x27;s real father) is not treated as a traitor and instead flees Mordred&#x27;s proposal and hides in the Tower of London. Willing adultery is still tied to her role in these later romances, but Mordred has been replaced as her lover by Lancelot. Related to this motif, the Galician-Portuguese Post-Vulgate &quot;Demanda&quot; makes Mordred hate Lancelot due to Mordred&#x27;s own love for Guinevere.

The 14th-century Scottish chronicler John of Fordun claimed that Mordred was the rightful heir to the throne of Britain, as Arthur was an illegitimate child (in his account, Mordred was the legitimate son of Lot and Anna, who here is Uther&#x27;s sister). This sentiment was elaborated upon by Walter Bower and by Hector Boece, who in his &quot;Historia Gentis Scotorum&quot; goes so far as to say Arthur and Mordred&#x27;s brother Gawain were traitors and villains, and Arthur usurped the throne from Mordred. According to Boece, Arthur agreed to make Mordred his heir, but on the advice of the Britons who did not want Mordred to rule, he later made Constantine his heir; this led to the war in which Arthur and Mordred died. In John Mair&#x27;s Scottish &quot;Historia Maioris Britanniae&quot;, Arthurus, Modred and Valvanus (Gawain) were all said to be underage and thus unfit to rule, with Arthur described as a bastard, though Mordred is also not depicted heroically when he uses mercenaries to seize both the throne and Guanora (Guinevere).

The 18th-century Welsh antiquarian Lewis Morris, based on statements made by Boece, suggested that Medrawd had a wife named Cwyllog, daughter of Caw. Another late Welsh tradition tells of Medrawd&#x27;s marriage with Guinevere&#x27;s sister, Gwenhwy(f)ach.

===Offspring===
Mordred has been often said to be succeeded by his sons. They are always being numbered as two, though they are usually not named, nor is their mother. In Geoffrey&#x27;s version, after the Battle of Camlann, Constantine is appointed Arthur&#x27;s successor. However, Mordred&#x27;s sons and their Saxon allies rise against him. After they are defeated, one of them flees to sanctuary in the Church of Amphibalus in Winchester while the other hides in a London friary. Constantine tracks them down and kills them before the altars of their respective hiding places. This act invokes the vengeance of God, and three years later Constantine is killed by his nephew Aurelius Conanus. Geoffrey&#x27;s account of the episode may be based on Constantine&#x27;s murder of two &quot;royal youths&quot; as mentioned by Gildas.

In the Alliterative &quot;Morte Arthure&quot;, the dying Arthur personally orders Constantine to kill Mordred&#x27;s infant sons. Guinevere had been asked by Mordred to flee with them to Ireland, but she instead returns to Arthur&#x27;s Caerleon without care or concern for their children&#x27;s safety. The perhaps 15th-century Spanish chivalric romance &quot;Florambel de Lucea&quot; tells of the surviving Arthur having been saved by his sister Morgaina (Morgan) in a later battle against the sons of Morderec (Mordred).

The elder of Mordred&#x27;s sons is named Melehan or Melian (possibly the same as Melou from Layamon&#x27;s &quot;Brut&quot;), but he was the younger one in the &quot;Lancelot-Grail&quot; and the Post-Vulgate Cycle. Years later (just after Guinevere&#x27;s death), in a battle near Winchester, Melehan mortally wounds Lionel, brother to Bors the Younger and a cousin of Lancelot. Bors then splits Melehan&#x27;s head, avenging his brother&#x27;s death, while the angry Lancelot chases after and decapitates the unnamed other brother who tried to escape deep into a forest.

==Modern portrayals==
Mordred is especially prominent in popular modern era Arthurian literature, as well as in other media such as film, television, and comics. He has been played on screen by Leonard Penn (&quot;The Adventures of Sir Galahad&quot;, 1949), Brian Worth (&quot;The Adventures of Sir Lancelot&quot;, 1956–1957), David Hemmings (&quot;Camelot&quot;, 1967), Robert Addie (&quot;Excalibur&quot;, 1981), Nickolas Grace (&quot;Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, 1984), Simon Templeman (voice in &quot;The Legend of Prince Valiant&quot;, 1991–1993), Jason Done (&quot;Merlin&quot;, 1998), Craig Sheffer (&quot;&quot;, 2000), Hans Matheson (&quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot;, 2001), Asa Butterfield and Alexander Vlahos (&quot;Merlin&quot;, 2008–2012), Rob Knighton (&quot;King Arthur: Legend of the Sword&quot;, 2017), and Miyuki Sawashiro (voice in &quot;Fate/Apocrypha&quot;, 2017), among others. In modern adaptations, the character of Morgause is usually conflated with that of Morgan, typically cast as Mordred&#x27;s villainous mother (or alternatively his lover or wife), often manipulative and sometimes abusive. Some modern books and other media even feature Mordred as protagonist.

Virtually everywhere Mordred appears, his name is synonymous with treason. In Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;, he is found in the lowest circle of Hell, set apart for traitors: &quot;him who, at one blow, had chest and shadow / shattered by Arthur&#x27;s hand&quot; (Canto XXXII). A few works from the Middle Ages and today, however, portray Mordred as less a traitor and more a conflicted opportunist, or even a victim of fate. Even Malory, who depicts Mordred as a villain, notes that the people rallied to him because, &quot;with Arthur was none other life but war and strife, and with Sir Mordred was great joy and bliss.&quot;

<text>Comb sort is a relatively simple sorting algorithm originally designed by Włodzimierz Dobosiewicz and Artur Borowy in 1980, later rediscovered (and given the name &quot;Combsort&quot;) by Stephen Lacey and Richard Box in 1991. Comb sort improves on bubble sort in the same way that Shellsort improves on insertion sort, in that they both allow elements that start far away from their intended position to move more than one space per swap.

&quot;nist.gov&quot;&#x27;s &quot;diminishing increment sort&quot; definition mentions the term &#x27;comb sort&#x27; as visualizing iterative passes of the data, &quot;where the teeth of a comb touch;&quot; the former term is linked to Don Knuth.

==Algorithm==
The basic idea is to eliminate &quot;turtles&quot;, or small values near the end of the list, since in a bubble sort these slow the sorting down tremendously. &quot;Rabbits&quot;, large values around the beginning of the list, do not pose a problem in bubble sort.

In bubble sort, when any two elements are compared, they always have a &quot;gap&quot; (distance from each other) of 1. The basic idea of comb sort is that the gap can be much larger than 1. The inner loop of bubble sort, which does the actual &quot;swap&quot;, is modified such that the gap between swapped elements goes down (for each iteration of outer loop) in steps of a &quot;shrink factor&quot; &quot;k&quot;: .

The gap starts out as the length of the list &quot;n&quot; being sorted divided by the shrink factor &quot;k&quot; (generally 1.3; see below) and one pass of the aforementioned modified bubble sort is applied with that gap. Then the gap is divided by the shrink factor again, the list is sorted with this new gap, and the process repeats until the gap is 1. At this point, comb sort continues using a gap of 1 until the list is fully sorted. The final stage of the sort is thus equivalent to a bubble sort, but by this time most turtles have been dealt with, so a bubble sort will be efficient.

The shrink factor has a great effect on the efficiency of comb sort. Dobosiewicz suggested &quot;k&quot; = 4/3 = 1.333…, while Lacey and Box suggest 1.3 as an ideal shrink factor after empirical testing on over 200,000 random lists of length approximately 1000. A value too small slows the algorithm down by making unnecessarily many comparisons, whereas a value too large fails to effectively deal with turtles, making it require many passes with a gap of 1.

The pattern of repeated sorting passes with decreasing gaps is similar to Shellsort, but in Shellsort the array is sorted completely each pass before going on to the next-smallest gap. Comb sort&#x27;s passes do not completely sort the elements. This is the reason that Shellsort gap sequences have a larger optimal shrink factor of about 2.25.

One additional refinement suggested by Lacey and Box is the &quot;rule of 11&quot;: always use a gap size of 11, rounding up gap sizes of 9 or 10 (reached by dividing gaps of 12, 13 or 14 by 1.3) to 11. This eliminates turtles surviving until the final gap-1 pass.

===Pseudocode===
 function combsort(array input) is
 gap := input.size // Initialize gap size
 shrink := 1.3 // Set the gap shrink factor
 sorted := false
 loop while sorted = false
 // Update the gap value for a next comb
 gap := floor(gap / shrink)
 if gap ≤ 1 then
 gap := 1
 sorted := true // If there are no swaps this pass, we are done
 else if gap = 9 or gap = 10 then
 gap := 11 // The &quot;rule of 11&quot;
 end if
 // A single &quot;comb&quot; over the input list
 i := 0
 loop while i + gap &lt; input.size // See Shell sort for a similar idea
 if input[i] &gt; input[i+gap] then
 swap(input[i], input[i+gap])
 sorted := false
 // If this assignment never happens within the loop,
 // then there have been no swaps and the list is sorted.
 end if
 i := i + 1
 end loop
 end loop
 end function

<text>In printing, type metal refers to the metal alloys used in traditional typefounding and hot metal typesetting. Historically, type metal was an alloy of lead, tin and antimony in different proportions depending on the application, be it individual character mechanical casting for hand setting, mechanical line casting or individual character mechanical typesetting and stereo plate casting. The proportions used are in the range: lead 50‒86%, antimony 11‒30% and tin 3‒20%. Antimony and tin are added to lead for durability while reducing the difference between the coefficients of expansion of the matrix and the alloy. Apart from durability, the general requirements for type-metal are that it should produce a true and sharp cast, and retain correct dimensions and form after cooling down. It should also be easy to cast, at reasonable low melting temperature, iron should not dissolve in the molten metal, and mould and nozzles should stay clean and easy to maintain. Today, Monotype machines can utilize a wide range of different alloys. Mechanical linecasting equipment uses alloys that are close to eutectic.

== History ==

Although the knowledge of casting soft metals in moulds was well established before Johannes Gutenberg&#x27;s time, his discovery of an alloy that was hard, durable, and would take a clear impression from the mould represents a fundamental aspect of his solution to the problem of printing with movable type. This alloy did not shrink as much as lead alone when cooled. Gutenberg&#x27;s other contributions were the creation of inks that would adhere to metal type and a method of softening handmade printing paper so that it would take the impression well.

== Required characteristics ==
Cheap, plentifully available as galena and easily workable, lead has many of the ideal characteristics, but on its own it lacks the necessary hardness and does not make castings with sharp details because molten lead shrinks and sags when it cools to a solid.

After much experimentation it was found that adding pewterer&#x27;s tin, obtained from cassiterite, improved the ability of the cast type to withstand the wear and tear of the printing process, making it tougher but not more brittle.

Despite patiently trying different proportions of both metals, solving the second part of the type metal problem proved very difficult without the addition of yet a third metal, antimony.

Alchemists had shown that when stibnite, an antimony sulfide ore, was heated with scrap iron, metallic antimony was produced. The typefounder would typically introduce powdered stibnite and horseshoe nails into his crucible to melt lead, tin and antimony into type metal. Both the iron and the sulfides would be rejected in the process.

The addition of antimony conferred the much needed improvements in the properties of hardness, wear resistance and especially, the sharpness of reproduction of the type design, given that it has the curious property of diminishing the shrinkage of the alloy upon solidification.

== Composition of type metal ==
Type metal is an alloy of lead, tin and antimony in different proportions depending on the application, be it individual character mechanical casting for hand setting, mechanical line casting or individual character mechanical typesetting and stereo plate casting.

The proportions used are in the range: lead 50‒86%, antimony 11‒30% and tin 3‒20%. The basic characteristics of these metals are as follows:

=== Lead ===
Type metal is an alloy of lead (Pb). Pure lead is a relatively cheap metal, is soft thus easy to work, and it is easy to cast since it melts at . However, it shrinks when it solidifies making letters that are not sharp enough for printing. In addition pure lead letters will quickly deform during use; a direct result of the easy workability of lead.

Lead is exceptionally soft, malleable, and ductile but with little tensile strength.

Lead oxide is a poison, that primarily damages brain function. Metallic lead is more stable and less toxic than its oxidized form. Metallic lead cannot be absorbed through contact with skin, so may be handled, carefully, with far less risk than lead oxide.

=== Tin ===
Tin (Sn) promotes the fluidity of the molten alloy and makes the type tough, giving the alloy resistance to wear. It is harder, stiffer and tougher than lead.

=== Antimony ===
Antimony (Sb) is a metalloid element, which melts at . Antimony has a crystalline appearance while being both brittle and fusible.

When alloyed with lead to produce type metal, antimony gives it the hardness it needs to resist deformation during printing, and gives it sharper castings from the mould to produce clear, easily read printed text on the page.

=== Typical type metal proportions ===
The actual compositions differed over time, different machines were adjusted to different alloys depending on the intended uses of the type. Printers had sometimes their own preferences about the quality of particular alloys. The Lanston Monotype Corporation in the United Kingdom had a whole range of alloys listed in their manuals.

== Alloys for mechanical composition ==
Most mechanical typesetting is divided basically into two different competing technologies: line casting (Linotype and Intertype) and single character casting (Monotype).

The manuals for the Monotype composition caster (1952 and later editions) mention at least five different alloys to be used for casting, depending the purpose of the type and the work to be done with it.

Although in general Monotype cast type characters can be visually identified as having a square nick (as opposed to the round nicks used on foundry type), there is no easy way to identify the alloy aside from an expensive chemical assay in a laboratory.

Apart from this the two Monotype companies in the United States and the UK also made moulds with &#x27;round&#x27; nicks. Typefounders and printers could and did order specially designed moulds to their own specifications: height, size, kind of nick, even the number of nicks could be changed.

Type produced with these special moulds can only be identified if the foundry or printer is known.

In Switzerland the company &quot;Metallum Pratteln AG&quot;, in Basel had yet another list of type-metal alloys. If needed, any alloy according to customer specifications could be produced.

=== Dross ===
Regeneration-metal was melted into the crucible to replace lost tin and antimony through the dross.

Every time type metal is remelted, tin and antimony oxidise. These oxides form on the surface of the crucible and must be removed. After stirring the molten metal, grey powder forms on the surface, the dross, needing to be skimmed. Dross contains recoverable amounts of tin and antimony.

Dross must be processed at specialized companies, in order to extract the pure metals in conditions that would prevent environmental pollution and remain economically feasible.

=== Behaviour of bipolar alloys ===
Pure metal melts and solidifies in a simple manner at a specific temperature. This is not the case with alloys. There we find a range of temperatures with all kinds of different events. The melting temperature of all mixtures is considerably lower than the pure components.

==== Antimony/Lead mixture examples ====
The addition of a small amount of antimony (5% to 6%) to lead will significantly alter the alloy&#x27;s behavior compared to pure lead: although the melting point of pure antimony is 630 °C, this mixture will be completely molten and a homogeneous fluid even at temperatures as low as 371 °C. Letting this mixture cool the alloy will remain liquid even through 355 °C, the melting point of pure lead. Once the temperature reaches 291 °C, lead crystals will start to form, increasing the cohesion of the liquid alloy. At 252 °C, the mixture will start to fully solidify, during which the temperature will remain constant. Only when the mixture has fully solidified will the temperature start to decrease again.

Using a 10% antimony, 90% lead mixture delays lead crystal formation until approximately 260 °C.

Using a 12% antimony, 88% lead mixture prevents crystal formation entirely, becoming a &quot;eutectic&quot;. This alloy has a clear melting point, at 252 °C.

Increasing the antimony content beyond 12% will lead to predominantly antimony crystallization.

=== Tri-polar mixtures ===
Adding tin to this bipolar-system complicates the behaviour even further. Some tin enters into the eutectic. A mixture of 4% tin, 12% antimony, and 84% lead solidifies at 240 °C.

Depending from the metals in excess, compared with the eutectic, crystals are formed, depleting the liquid, until the eutectic 4/12 mixture is formed once more.

The 12/20 alloy contains many mixed crystals of tin and antimony, these crystals constitute the hardness of the alloy and the resistance against wear.

Raising the content of antimony cannot be done without adding some tin too. Because the fluidity of the mixture will dramatically diminish when the temperature goes down somewhere in the channels of the machine. Nozzles can be blocked by antimony crystals.

=== Metals used on typecasting machines ===
Eutectic alloys are used on Linotype-machines and Ludlow-casters to prevent blockage of the mould and to ensure continuous trouble-free casting.

Alloys used on Monotype machines tend to contain higher contents of tin, to obtain tougher character. All characters should be able to resist the pressure during printing. This meant an extra investment, but Monotype was an expensive system all the way.

=== Present usage of type metal ===
The fierce competition between the different mechanical typecasting systems like Linotype and Monotype has given rise to some lasting fairy tales about typemetal. Linotype users looked down on Monotype and vice versa.

Monotype machines however can utilize a wide range of different alloys; maintaining a constant and a high production meant a strict standardization of the typemetal in the company, so as to reduce by all means any interruption of the production. Repeated assays were done at regular intervals to monitor the alloy used, since every time the metal is recycled, roughly half a per cent of tin content is lost through oxidation. These oxides are removed with the dross while cleaning the surface of the molten metal.

Nowadays this &quot;battle&quot; has lost its importance, at least for Monotype. The quality of the produced type is far more important. Alloys with a high-content of antimony, and subsequently a high content of tin, can be cast at a higher temperature, and at a lower speed and with more cooling at a Monotype composition or supercaster.

Although care was taken to avoid mixing different types of type metal in shops with different type casting systems, in actual practice this often occurred. Since a Monotype composition caster can cope with a variety of different metal alloys, occasional mixing of Linotype alloy with discarded typefounders alloy has proven its usefulness.

Mechanical linecasting equipment use alloys that are close to eutectic.

== Contamination of type metals ==
=== Copper ===
Copper has been used for hardening type metal; this metal easily forms mixed crystals with tin when the alloy cools down. These crystals will grow just below the exit opening of the nozzle in Monotype machines, resulting in a total blockage after some time. These nozzles are very difficult to clean, because the hard crystals will resist drilling.

=== Zinc ===
Brass spaces contain zinc, which is extremely counterproductive in type metal. Even a tiny amount — less than 1% — will form a dusty surface on the molten metal surface that is difficult to remove. Characters cast from contaminated type metal such as this are of inferior quality, the solution being to discard and replace with fresh alloy.

Brass and zinc should therefore be removed before remelting. The same applies to aluminium, although this metal will float on top of the melt, and will be easily discovered and removed, before it is dissolved into the lead.

=== Magnesium ===
Magnesium plates are very dangerous in molten lead, because this metal can easily burn and will ignite in the molten lead.

=== Iron ===
Iron is hardly dissolved into type metal, although the molten metal is always in contact with the cast iron surface of the melting pot.

== Historic references to type metals ==
Joseph Moxon, in his &quot;Mechanick Exercises&quot;, mentions a mix of equal amounts of &quot;antimony&quot; and iron nails.

The &quot;antimony&quot; here was in fact stibnite, antimony-sulfide (Sb2S3). The iron was burned away in this process, reducing the antimony and at the same time removing the unwanted sulfur. In this way ferro-sulfide was formed, that would evaporate with all the fumes.

The mixture of stibnite and nails was heated red hot in an open-air furnace, until all is molten and finished. The resulting metal can contain up to 9% of iron. Further purification can be done by mixing the hot melt with kitchen-salt, NaCl. After this red hot lead from another melting pot is added and stirred thoroughly.

Some tin was added to the alloy for casting small characters and narrow spaces, to better fill narrow areas of the mould. The good properties of tin were well known. The use of tin was sometime minimized to save expenses.

Much of this toxic work was done by child labour, a labor force that includes children.

As a supposed antidote to the inhaled toxic metal fumes, the workers were given a mixture of red wine and salad oil:

<text>Drusilla, or Dru for short, is a fictional character on the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot;, portrayed by Juliet Landau. Created by Joss Whedon and David Greenwalt, she is introduced as a main antagonist alongside her lover Spike in the second season of &quot;Buffy&quot;. In addition to returning in subsequent seasons, the character is featured as a villain on the spin-off show &quot;Angel&quot; as well. Flashbacks in both series reveal Drusilla&#x27;s past as a young psychic in Victorian London who was driven insane by Angel before he ultimately turned her into a vampire. Spike and Dru are notably more subversive compared to other &quot;Big Bads&quot; that have opposed Buffy Summers. The duo was conceived as a &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot;-inspired vampiric pair so Landau chose to portray Drusilla with a Cockney accent, while the character&#x27;s physical appearance drew from sources such as supermodel Kate Moss and the 1990s heroin chic aesthetic.

Following the conclusion of both series, Drusilla continued to appear in Expanded Universe materials in other media. Landau went on to co-write a two-issue &quot;Drusilla&quot; story arc for IDW Publishing&#x27;s in 2009, which continued her character&#x27;s storyline.

==Character history==
Drusilla&#x27;s history unfolds in flashbacks scattered among numerous episodes of both &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot;; they are not presented in chronological order. In &quot;Lie to Me&quot;, Angel explains that, in 1860 when he was still Angelus, he became obsessed with Drusilla, a beautiful young Catholic woman who lived with her parents and two sisters in London. Angelus&#x27;s sire Darla first discovered Drusilla, and presented her to Angelus as a new possible victim to torment. At first, Angelus suspected Drusilla of being a burgeoning saint, but he learned that she instead had psychic abilities (an uncommon but confirmed power of random humans in the Buffyverse), and was capable of occasionally foretelling the future, especially tragic situations. However, she believed this to be an evil affliction and wished to enter a nunnery to cleanse herself. Angelus sensed her purity and became obsessed with destroying her, as Drusilla had the potential for sainthood. Angelus first made contact with her by murdering Drusilla&#x27;s priest, and impersonating him when she went to confession. When she confessed that she believed her abilities were evil, Angelus toyed with her by suggesting she embrace the evil instead of rejecting it. At some later point Angelus tortured and killed Drusilla&#x27;s entire family, causing her to flee to a convent in Prague. On the day she was to take her holy vows, Angelus made her watch as he killed every person in the convent and engaged in sexual relations with Darla. The trauma of Angelus&#x27;s atrocities drove Drusilla insane, and Angelus chose to turn her into a vampire, as he considered her a masterpiece, a testament to his talent. Believing death to be a mercy to her at this point, he chose to sire her to make her pain eternal as an immortal.

After being sired, Drusilla, now a predator, joined Angelus and Darla on their murderous travels. In 1880, Drusilla sired the young poet William, who joined the group. She and William, later known as &quot;Spike&quot;, shared an intimate relationship, though Angelus continued to engage in sexual relations with Dru as well.

Shortly after Angelus is cursed with a soul, Spike and Drusilla (unaware of the ensoulment) go their separate ways from Darla and Angel. At some point before their arrival in Sunnydale in late 1997, Drusilla is attacked and severely injured by an angry mob in Prague, leaving her in a weakened and frail condition. Spike cares for her, and the couple decide to travel to the Hellmouth in hopes that its energy will help to restore Drusilla&#x27;s strength and health.

They arrive in Sunnydale in the episode &quot;School Hard&quot;, and Spike plots the downfall of the current Slayer, Buffy Summers. When he discovers that Drusilla can be cured by the blood of her sire, Spike captures Angel and allows Drusilla to torture him until it is time to perform the ritual. Although Buffy and her friends save Angel, the ritual is successful. Drusilla, fully restored, now takes care of Spike, who has been temporarily paralyzed by Buffy&#x27;s attack. When Angel reverts to Angelus, he re-joins the couple. Drusilla soon kills Kendra, another Slayer, by hypnotizing her and cutting her throat with a fingernail (which impresses Spike when he learns of it).

Drusilla is delighted by Angelus&#x27;s determination to destroy the world and encourages his ongoing sexual attention; both dynamics strongly disturb Spike, who wants Drusilla to himself again and does not particularly want the world to end. Spike decides to help Buffy save the world in exchange for his and Drusilla&#x27;s safe passage from Sunnydale. Drusilla resists Spike&#x27;s betrayal of Angelus, and he attacks her, ultimately carrying her unconscious body from the fray.

Drusilla and Spike flee to Brazil, where Drusilla becomes disillusioned with their relationship. Spike&#x27;s alliance with the Slayer, combined with Dru&#x27;s skills of foresight and perception, prove to her that Spike is now tainted (not &quot;demon enough&quot; for her) and that he is developing feelings for Buffy. Drusilla breaks up with Spike, and he rejects her offer to remain friends.

Drusilla reappears on &quot;Angel&quot; in 2000, when Wolfram &amp; Hart brings her to Los Angeles to re-sire Darla, who had been resurrected as a human dying of syphilis. Drusilla, who loves Darla like a &quot;grandmum&quot;, and also more than that, over their 150-year-old complicated relationship, genuinely believes she is doing Darla a favor by siring her and is puzzled by Darla&#x27;s brief rage before her renewed vampire nature kicks in. Reconciled, the two wreak havoc in the city until Angel sets them on fire. The two go underground to heal, but Drusilla leaves Darla, who is then protected by Lindsey McDonald.

Drusilla returns to Sunnydale in the episode &quot;Crush&quot; to persuade Spike to join Darla and herself in reforming their &quot;family&quot; unit, but instead, Spike seizes the opportunity to try to prove his love for Buffy by offering to stake Drusilla. Heartbroken by the actions of her former lover, Drusilla departs Sunnydale and remains at large. However, in season 7 of &quot;Buffy&quot;, the First Evil impersonates Drusilla in an unsuccessful attempt to break Spike&#x27;s spirit. Spike claims that the First Evil&#x27;s impersonation is not crazy enough to be Drusilla.

In comics by IDW Publishing set after the television series ended, Drusilla reappears, breaking out of a psychiatric institution, in the story arc &quot;Drusilla&quot; (2009). Still mentally ill, her whereabouts since her last appearance in &quot;Angel&quot; remain unexplained. After assault by a crowd, she awakens, still pallid-skinned, in what appears to be Georgian London, in broad daylight and enters what seems to be her parents’ home. She encounters a doll (which may or may not be &quot;Miss Edith&quot;) and is called by a third party, possibly her parents. It is uncertain whether this is an elaborate hallucination, time travel to her personal past or an alternate universe where she was never turned by Angelus. It is strongly implied, however, that the story actually takes place before Drusilla is sired, and the parts of it set in the modern day are actually a premonition in the human, 19th-century Drusilla&#x27;s mind. She later reappears in the &quot;Spike&quot; mini-series (2010–11) by IDW, where she encounters Spike in Las Vegas, having allied herself with a human who believes Spike stole his soul. Spike has Buffy&#x27;s friend Willow magically transfer his soul to Drusilla to give her a shot at redemption, but they are forced to reverse the spell when it drives her even madder than she already is.

The character next appears in &quot;Angel &amp; Faith&quot; by Dark Horse Comics in the story arc &quot;Daddy Issues&quot; (2012), in which Drusilla has become sane thanks to the Lorophage demon, popularly referred to as the Highgate vampire, which ate her trauma and pain. In her new role as &quot;Mother Superior&quot;, she sought to perform similar treatments on the citizens of London, which Angel likened to lobotomies. When Angel killed the Lorophage, Drusilla becomes insane once more, and is free. Dark Horse intended to release the 5-issue miniseries &quot;Drusilla: Run and Catch&quot;, examining what happened next for her, but it was delayed until the conclusion of &quot;Season Nine&quot;. Later in the &quot;Angel &amp; Faith&quot; series, it transpires she went on to kill one of the London Slayers affiliated with Faith. She returns in the second series, in which she helps the demon Archaeus (the Master&#x27;s sire) build an army of vampires to take over Magic Town. However she flees in the finale when Angel, Faith and their allies defeat Archaeus and his army in a battle.

==Powers and abilities==
Drusilla has all the standard powers and vulnerabilities of a vampire, plus minor psychic abilities. She is immortal, regenerates damage, drains human blood to survive, and is stronger than most humans. Drusilla&#x27;s technique in combat, although awkward-looking, has allowed her to briefly hold her own in a fight against Angel (in &quot;Reunion&quot;) and Spike (in &quot;Becoming, Part Two&quot;), along with besting Kendra the Vampire Slayer (in &quot;Becoming, Part One&quot;) before using the hypnosis technique and then killing her. It was also in this fight with Kendra that Drusilla showed that her fingernails are sharper than one would normally expect, as she uses them to slit Kendra&#x27;s throat. Darla had demonstrated a similar technique when she sired Angel; whether this is due to vampiric abilities or physical manipulation of nails is unclear.

Drusilla is also a seer with minor psychic abilities. However, since she had these before becoming a vampire their source and cause are unknown. She receives vivid visions that contain possible glimpses of the future, and can also see into people&#x27;s minds and project false imagery into them (e.g. in &quot;Becoming, Part Two&quot;, when she convinces Giles that she is really Jenny Calendar). She is also capable of hypnotizing people, which she does by catching their gazes, pointing her fingers towards her victim&#x27;s eyes and then to her own, whispering to them (&quot;Be in my eyes, Be in me&quot;). Drusilla uses this technique to murder Kendra in the episode &quot;Becoming, Part One&quot;. The Master uses a similar skill to paralyze Buffy in &quot;Prophecy Girl&quot;.

Like all vampires, she is vulnerable to holy items and sunlight, can be killed by decapitation or a stake to the heart, and cannot enter the home of a living human without first being invited by someone who lives there.

==Personality and appearance==
Actress Juliet Landau said that when she first received the script, it indicated that Drusilla&#x27;s accent could be British or American. Landau felt Drusilla &quot;should really be Cockney, especially with the whole &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot; analogy.&quot; Though she never considered portraying Drusilla with a Southern American accent, as James Marsters had considered for Spike, she notes that invited comparisons with Blanche DuBois would also have been interesting.

Drusilla&#x27;s madness is exhibited in her often-strange dialogue, which is peppered with non sequiturs like &quot;Spike, do you love my insides? The parts you can&#x27;t see?&quot; Her behavior is girlish, accompanied by a dark, ironic twist. For instance, when she is happy, she will squeal and laugh like a young child, but she is happiest when committing torture, hunting humans, or witnessing mass destruction. She has a fondness for china dolls but keeps them blindfolded or gagged. She also loves flowers and cute animals, but is not sane enough to care for them; as she says, &quot;Do you like daisies? I plant them but they always die. Everything I put in the ground withers and dies.&quot; She even goes so far as to own a Pekingese puppy. She speaks in a soft, mellow voice which contrasts with her dialogue.

Drusilla&#x27;s costumes were initially intended to be a &quot;cross between a Victorian period look and the Kate Moss heroin chic fashion look,&quot; says Landau.

<text>The Negotiator is a 1998 American crime thriller film directed by F. Gary Gray. It stars Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey as Chicago Police Department lieutenants who are expert hostage negotiators. The film was released in the United States on July 29, 1998, receiving generally positive reviews from critics and grossing $88 million worldwide. The film is considered by many to be one of Jackson&#x27;s most underrated films and one of F. Gary Gray’s best films.

==Plot==
Chicago Police Lieutenant Danny Roman is a top hostage negotiator for the east precinct. His partner, Nate Roenick, warns him that an informant inside the department suspects members of their own unit have embezzled millions from the police disability fund. Roenick is shot dead, and Roman is lured to the scene and discovered by the police, but is unable to corroborate Roenick&#x27;s story or identify the informant.

Roman is targeted by Internal Affairs Inspector Terence Niebaum, whom Roenick&#x27;s informant believed was involved in the embezzlement. The murder weapon is recovered and linked to one of Roman&#x27;s cases, and a search of his home produces evidence of an incriminating offshore bank account, making him the prime suspect in the embezzlement and Roenick&#x27;s death. Forced to surrender his gun and badge, ostracized by his colleagues, and with charges against him pending, Roman storms into Niebaum&#x27;s office to confront him, and takes Niebaum, his administrative assistant Maggie, Roman&#x27;s commander and friend Grant Frost, and con man Rudy Timmons as hostages.

With the building evacuated and placed under siege by his own unit and the FBI, Roman will only speak to fellow negotiator Lieutenant Chris Sabian of the west precinct, and issues his demands: the return of his badge; a department funeral if killed; the identity of Roenick&#x27;s informant; and the truth about his killer. Sabian, who sees tactical action as a last resort, clashes with Roman&#x27;s unit, particularly commander Adam Beck. A breach of Niebaum&#x27;s office backfires when a SWAT marksman refuses to shoot Roman, who captures officers Scott and Markus. Sabian takes command of the scene, but Roman seemingly executes Scott to reestablish control.

Roman releases Frost to Sabian in exchange for restoring the building&#x27;s electricity, allowing him to access Niebaum&#x27;s computer. With help from Rudy and Maggie, Roman discovers the embezzlement scheme: Corrupt officers submitted false disability claims that were processed by an unknown insider on the disability fund&#x27;s board. Niebaum also has wiretap recordings of Roenick, and Sabian claims to have located the informant in an attempt to end the standoff, but Roman realizes he is bluffing when Niebaum&#x27;s files reveal that Roenick himself was the informant.

When Roman threatens to expose Niebaum to sniper fire, Niebaum admits that Roenick gave him wiretaps implicating his squadmates in the scheme; Niebaum was bribed by the guilty officers to cover up their crimes, but Roenick refused and was killed. Niebaum has safely hidden the wiretaps, but the corrupt officers infiltrate the air vents and open fire, killing Niebaum. Roman fends them off with flashbangs taken from the captured officers, and Niebaum&#x27;s murder convinces the remaining hostages that Roman is being set up.

The FBI assume jurisdiction, relieving Sabian of command and ordering a full breach. Maggie tells Roman that Niebaum likely kept Roenick&#x27;s wiretaps at home, while Sabian reenters the building to warn Roman, who reveals that Scott is unharmed. Sabian agrees to help Roman prove his innocence, and as the building is raided and the hostages are rescued, Roman disguises himself in Scott&#x27;s uniform and escapes. He and Sabian are unable to locate the wiretaps at Niebaum&#x27;s home, where the corrupt officers prepare to kill Roman, but Frost arrives to negotiate with Roman alone.

Sabian shoots Roman, offering to destroy Roenick&#x27;s evidence in exchange for a cut of the embezzled funds. Frost agrees, effectively revealing himself as the ringleader of the conspiracy, the insider on the disability fund&#x27;s board, and Roenick&#x27;s killer. Crushing the floppy disks Sabian gives him and shooting Niebaum&#x27;s computer, Frost exits the house to discover that Sabian deliberately only wounded Roman, who broadcast Frost&#x27;s confession to the police outside. Frost attempts suicide, but is shot in the shoulder by Beck and arrested with the other corrupt officers, and Roman narrowly refrains from shooting Frost to avenge Roenick. As Roman is loaded into an ambulance with his wife, Sabian returns his badge.

==Cast==

Tom Bower also appears uncredited as Omar, an unhinged man whom Danny negotiates with at the beginning of the film.

==Production==
The script was originally pitched to Disney subsidiary Hollywood Pictures, with David Hoberman attached as producer, but Disney placed the film into turnaround, and sold the project to New Regency Productions, who at that time had a distribution deal with Warner Bros., with Sylvester Stallone in mind to star. Stallone turned the project down and offered the role to Samuel L. Jackson, who had accepted the role.

===Music===
The original score was composed by Graeme Revell. Revell described the &quot;The Negotiator&quot; score as difficult due to [F. Gary Gray] who frequently changed his mind. It took about 2–3 months to complete, but ultimately, Revell went with his original compositions, which he felt were the right fit for the film. While he didn’t consider the score experimental, he was proud of it as a solid example of the genre, believing it effectively drove the film&#x27;s rhythm.

=== Notes ===
The film is dedicated to J. T. Walsh, who died several months before the film&#x27;s release.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;The Negotiator&quot; made $10.2 million in its opening weekend, finishing fourth at the box office, behind &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot;. It went on to finish with a worldwide gross of $88 million. Warner Bros. spent $40.3 million promoting the film, and lost an estimated $13 million after all revenues and expenses were factored together.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Negotiator&quot; holds an approval rating of 74%, based on 58 reviews, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;The Negotiator&quot;″s battle of wits doesn&#x27;t wholly justify its excessive length, but confident direction by F. Gary Gray and formidable performances makes this a situation audiences won&#x27;t mind being hostage to.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score 62 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Emanuel Levy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;Teaming for the first time Kevin Spacey and Samuel L. Jackson, arguably the two best actors of their generation, in perfectly fitting roles is a shrewd move and the best element of this fact-inspired but thriller.&quot; Roger Ebert, in his &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; review, calls &quot;The Negotiator&quot; &quot;a triumph of style over story, and of acting over characters...Much of the movie simply consists of closeups of the two of them talking, but it&#x27;s not simply dialogue because the actors make it more—invest it with conviction and urgency...&quot;

Mick LaSalle, in his less-than-enthusiastic review for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, had the most praise for Spacey&#x27;s performance: &quot;Kevin Spacey is the main reason to see &quot;The Negotiator&quot;...Spacey&#x27;s special gift is his ability to make sanity look radiant...In &quot;The Negotiator&quot;, as in &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot;, he gives us a man uniquely able to accept, face and deal with the truth.&quot;

===Accolades===
== Adaptation ==
The film was remade into &quot;Crisis Negotiators&quot;, a 2024 Hong Kong film directed by Herman Yau and produced by Andy Lau, starring Sean Lau and Francis Ng in the lead roles, who played the counterparts of Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey&#x27;s characters respectively.

<doc id="159450" wikidata="Q691912" url="?curid=159450" title="Nebraska Cornhuskers">
<text>The Nebraska Cornhuskers (often abbreviated to Huskers) are the intercollegiate athletic teams that represent the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. The university is a member of the Big Ten Conference and competes in NCAA Division I, fielding twenty-four varsity teams (ten men&#x27;s, fourteen women&#x27;s) in fifteen sports. Nineteen of these teams participate in the Big Ten, while rifle is a member of the single-sport Patriot Rifle Conference and beach volleyball and bowling compete as independents. The Cornhuskers have two official mascots, Herbie Husker and Lil&#x27; Red.

Early nicknames for the university&#x27;s athletic teams included &quot;Antelopes&quot; (later adopted by the University of Nebraska at Kearney), &quot;Old Gold Knights&quot;, and &quot;Bugeaters&quot;. &quot;Cornhuskers&quot; first appeared in a school newspaper headline (&quot;We Have Met The Cornhuskers And They Are Ours&quot;) after an 1893 victory over Iowa, though in this instance the term referred to Iowa. It was first applied to Nebraska in 1899 by Nebraska State Journal writer Cy Sherman and was officially adopted by the school the following year – and later by the state of Nebraska itself, which became &quot;The Cornhusker State&quot; in 1945.

Nebraska was a founding member of the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association in 1907 (later known as the Big Six, Big Seven, and Big Eight Conference) and competed in it for the next eighty-nine years, with a brief hiatus during World War I. In 1996, NU and the seven other members of the Big Eight merged with four Texas schools from the Southwest Conference to form the Big 12 Conference. Nebraska joined the Big Ten in 2011.

Nebraska&#x27;s athletic programs have won thirty-two national championships: eleven in bowling, eight in men&#x27;s gymnastics, five each in football and volleyball, and three in women&#x27;s track and field. Twenty-one of these were bestowed as NCAA championships.

==Varsity sports==
===Baseball===

Nebraska&#x27;s baseball team was founded in 1889, making it the oldest athletic program at the school. It was disjointed in its first decades, frequently disbanding for years at a time. The hiring of Tony Sharpe in 1947 brought stability to the program, but success was limited. Sharpe and his successor John Sanders combined to lead NU for fifty-one seasons, making just three NCAA Division I tournament appearances between them. Nebraska hired Dave Van Horn in 1998 and he quickly turned the Huskers into a national power, reaching the College World Series in 2001 and 2002. Mike Anderson took over for Van Horn and in 2005 led NU to a school-record fifty-seven wins and another College World Series berth. Anderson could not sustain this success, and since his departure in 2011 Nebraska has experienced modest success under head coaches Darin Erstad and Will Bolt.

In 2002, the Huskers moved from the aging Buck Beltzer Stadium to Hawks Field at Haymarket Park, considered among the best collegiate baseball facilities in the country at the time. Nebraska has ranked in the top thirty nationally in average attendance each year since moving to Hawks Field.

===Basketball===
Men

Nebraska&#x27;s men&#x27;s basketball program has accomplished little of note since the establishment of the NCAA Division I tournament in 1939. Nebraska has not won a regular-season conference championship since sharing the Big Seven title in 1950 and has not won an outright title since 1916. Nebraska&#x27;s lengthiest period of success came in the first years of the sport&#x27;s existence; the retroactive Premo-Porretta Power Poll ranked the Cornhuskers in the top ten three times between 1897 and 1903.

Nebraska did not make an NCAA tournament appearance until 1986, forty-six years after its establishment, and is the only power-conference program without a tournament victory. Much of the team&#x27;s modest recent success came under Danny Nee, who coached the Huskers from 1987 to 2000. Nee is the team&#x27;s all-time winningest head coach and led Nebraska to five of its eight NCAA tournament appearances, the 1996 NIT championship, and the 1994 Big Eight tournament championship (NU&#x27;s only conference championship of any kind since 1950). Nebraska has made just two NCAA tournament appearances since the departure of Nee in 2000. The program has been led by former Chicago Bulls and Iowa State head coach Fred Hoiberg since 2019.

*NIT championships (1): 1996

Women
Nebraska&#x27;s women&#x27;s basketball program began as a club sport in 1970 and became a varsity sport five years later. George Nicodemus led the Huskers to a 22–9 record and the second round of the AIAW Tournament in its first varsity season. Nicodemus left the program in 1977 and the school cycled through several head coaches before hiring Angela Beck in 1986. Beck led the Huskers to the Big Eight championship and the school&#x27;s first NCAA Division I tournament appearance in 1988. She left the program in 1997 and was succeeded by Paul Sanderford, who took Nebraska to the tournament in each of his first three seasons. When Sanderford resigned in 2002 due to health issues, the school hired Creighton head coach Connie Yori.

Under Yori&#x27;s guidance, Nebraska became a fixture in the national top 25 and NCAA tournament. In 2009–10 the Cornhuskers went 32–2, earned a number-one seed in the NCAA tournament, and reached the Sweet Sixteen for the first time in school history. Yori resigned in 2016 following an athletic department investigation into reports that she mistreated her players and assistant coaches. Former Huskers point guard Amy Williams was named Yori&#x27;s replacement.

===Bowling===

Bowling has been a varsity sport at Nebraska since 1996. Bill Straub, who led the bowling club program to national championships in 1991 and 1995, was hired to lead the varsity program and won three more WIBC titles. The inaugural NCAA Bowling Championship was held in 2003 and Nebraska won the first two national titles. Nebraska has won four more titles since, and has never ranked outside the top ten since national collegiate rankings debuted in 1990. In 2019, Straub retired and longtime assistant Paul Klempa was named head coach.

Bowling competes as an independent, making it one of only three programs at Nebraska not affiliated with the Big Ten.

===Football===

Nebraska competes as part of the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision, representing the University of Nebraska–Lincoln in the Big Ten Conference. Nebraska has played its home games at Memorial Stadium since 1923 and sold out every game at the venue since 1962.

Nebraska is among the most storied programs in college football history and has the eighth-most all-time victories among FBS teams. NU has won forty-six conference championships and five national championships (1970, 1971, 1994, 1995, and 1997), along with seven other national titles the school does not claim. Its 1971 and 1995 title-winning teams are considered among the best ever. Nebraska&#x27;s three Heisman Trophy winners – Johnny Rodgers, Mike Rozier, and Eric Crouch – join twenty-four other Cornhuskers in the College Football Hall of Fame.

The program&#x27;s first extended period of success came just after the turn of the twentieth century. Between 1900 and 1916, Nebraska had five undefeated seasons and completed a stretch of thirty-four games without a loss, still a program record. Despite a span of twenty-one conference championships in thirty-three seasons, the Cornhuskers did not experience major national success until Bob Devaney was hired in 1962. Devaney won two national championships and eight conference titles in eleven seasons as head coach, but perhaps his most lasting achievement was the hiring of Tom Osborne as offensive coordinator in 1969. Osborne was named Devaney&#x27;s successor in 1973, and over the next twenty-five years established himself as one of the best coaches in college football history with his trademark I-formation offense and revolutionary strength, conditioning, and nutrition programs. Following Osborne&#x27;s retirement in 1997, Nebraska cycled through five head coaches before hiring Matt Rhule in 2022.

===Golf===
Men

Nebraska&#x27;s golf program began in 1935, led by College Football Hall of Famer Dana X. Bible. The team&#x27;s greatest successes came under longtime head coach Larry Romjue, who took NU to all four of its NCAA Division I Championship appearances. The program has been coached by Judd Cornell since 2022.

*Conference championships (2): 1936, 1937
*NCAA Division I Championship appearances (4): 1973, 1978, 1998, 1999

The Cornhuskers have made the NCAA Division I Championship three times. The program has been coached by Jeanne Sutherland since 2022.

*Conference championships (2): 1976, 1983
*NCAA Division I Championship appearances (3): 2000, 2003, 2006

===Gymnastics===
Men

Nebraska&#x27;s men&#x27;s gymnastics program is one of the most successful in the nation, with eight team national championships and forty-one NCAA event titles. Ten Huskers have represented the United States in the Olympics. Nebraska is one of only five Big Ten schools to sanction a men&#x27;s gymnastics program.

*Individual all-around national championships (9): Jim Hartung (1980, 1981), Wes Suter (1985), Tom Schlesinger (1987), Kevin Davis (1988), Patrick Kirksey (1989), Dennis Harrison (1994), Richard Grace (1995), Jason Hardabura (1999)

Women

Nebraska&#x27;s women&#x27;s gymnastics program was established in 1975. The school&#x27;s first team, led by head coach Karen Balke, was made up entirely of freshmen and sophomores. Judy Schalk replaced Balke after two seasons and led the Huskers to five conference titles and a national tournament bid. Rick Walton became head coach in 1984 and soon won four straight Big Eight championships, each resulting in an NCAA tournament appearance. Michele Bryant won NU&#x27;s first individual NCAA event title in vault in 1990. Dan Kendig was named head coach in 1993 and under him, Nebraska upset No. 1 Utah to reach the 1997 Super Six Finals, a first in school history. Kendig won his sixth consecutive conference championship in 1999 and was named national coach of the year. Kendig&#x27;s teams won four individual event titles; Heather Brink won the all-around and vault in 2000 and Richelle Simpson won the all-around and floor exercise in 2003. Brink was named Kendig&#x27;s replacement in 2019 when he resigned in the midst of an NCAA investigation.

===Rifle===
Rifle became an official sport at the university in 1998. The team practices and hosts meets at the ten-point indoor firing range in NU&#x27;s Military and Naval Sciences Building (ROTC). The team has been coached by Richard Clark since 2024.

Although rifle is classified as a coeducational sport by the NCAA, Nebraska fields an all-female team. The program competed as an independent for six years before joining the Great America Rifle Conference in 2004. NU left the GARC for the Patriot Rifle Conference in 2021, making it one of only three programs at Nebraska not affiliated with the Big Ten.

*Conference championships (1): 2006
*Conference tournament championships (2): 2005, 2006
*NCAA Championship appearances (17): 2000, 2001, 2004–2008, 2010, 2013–2018, 2020, 2021, 2023

===Soccer===

In 1995, Nebraska became the first Big Eight school to sponsor a varsity women&#x27;s soccer program. John Walker was hired lead the new program and took his team to the NCAA Division I Championship in his third year, the first of eight consecutive tournament appearances. This streak ended in 2005, and the Cornhuskers have reached the tournament just three times since. The team has reached the round of 16 eight times and the national quarterfinals three times. Walker, the only coach in program history, has earned NSCAA National Coach of the Year, NSCAA Central Region Coach of the Year, and Big 12 Conference Coach of the Year during his tenure in Lincoln.

===Softball===

Nebraska&#x27;s softball program started in 1970, before it was an official NCAA sport. Since the NCAA sanctioned softball in 1983, the Cornhuskers have made eight appearances in the Women&#x27;s College World Series and won the tenth-most games of any program. The program&#x27;s greatest successes came under head coach Wayne Daigle shortly after the tournament&#x27;s creation, culminating in a national runner-up finish in 1985 (though it was quickly vacated by the NCAA Committee on Infractions). Rhonda Revelle became the program&#x27;s head coach in 1992, and has since won more games than any coach in Nebraska athletics history. Revelle has won seven conference titles and was inducted into the National Fastpitch Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 2010.

*Conference championships (10): 1982, 1984–1988, 1998, 2001, 2004, 2014

===Tennis===
Men
Nebraska&#x27;s men&#x27;s tennis team was established in 1928 and has reached the NCAA Championship twice, most recently in 2011 under longtime head coach Kerry McDermott. Five Cornhuskers have won conference championships and seventeen have been named all-conference selections. In 1989, Steven Jung was the NCAA Singles runner-up and was named NU&#x27;s first All-American. Jung is the only men&#x27;s tennis player in the Nebraska Athletic Hall of Fame. Peter Kobelt has led the program since 2024.

*NCAA Division I Championship appearances (2): 2010, 2011

Women
NU&#x27;s women&#x27;s tennis program was established in 1976 and has made the NCAA Division I Championship six times since 2000, most recently in 2013. Fourteen Cornhuskers have won conference championships, and twenty have been named all-conference selections. The team was coached by Scott Jacobson from 1992 until his retirement in 2022.

*Conference championships (4): 1977, 1978, 2013, 2020
*NCAA Division I Championship appearances (6): 2005, 2006, 2010–2013

===Track and field===
Men

Nebraska&#x27;s men&#x27;s track and field team started in 1922 under coach Henry Schulte, who led the Huskers to nine conference titles before his retirement. His assistant, College Football Hall of Famer Ed Weir, replaced Schulte. NU won eleven individual national championships under Weir&#x27;s successor Frank Sevigne, with forty-two All-American selections and 103 individual conference champions in combined indoor and outdoor events. Gary Pepin coached both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams from Sevigne&#x27;s retirement in 1983 until his own retirement in 2022.

*Indoor conference championships (38): 1930–1933, 1936–1938, 1940–1942, 1949, 1951, 1963, 1972, 1973, 1978, 1985, 1987–1989, 1992, 1994–1998, 2000–2005, 2007, 2015, 2016, 2019
*Outdoor conference championships (29): 1921–1924, 1926, 1929, 1932, 1933, 1936, 1937, 1939–1942, 1950, 1966, 1987, 1989, 1990, 1995, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2009, 2010, 2013, 2016

Women

Nebraska&#x27;s women&#x27;s track and field program began competition in 1976. Carol Frost, whose son Scott would later quarterback the Cornhuskers to a national championship, took over the program in its second year. Frost left Nebraska after the 1980 season, and Gary Pepin took over the program. Two years later Pepin assumed control of the men&#x27;s program as well, a dual role he held until his retirement in 2022.

*Indoor conference championships (24): 1980–1997, 2000, 2001, 2004, 2005, 2011, 2012

*Outdoor conference championships (18): 1980–1995, 2000, 2005

===Volleyball===
Nebraska&#x27;s volleyball program is among the best in the history of the sport. The Cornhuskers have won five national championships (1995, 2000, 2006, 2015, 2017) and reached the national semifinal on twelve other occasions. NU has won more games than any other program and ranks second in national semifinal appearances, tournament wins, and tournament winning percentage. Nebraska has made the NCAA tournament for forty-two consecutive seasons and has never been ranked outside of the national top twenty. The Cornhuskers have featured more AVCA All-Americans than any other program, including four National Player of the Year award winners.

Nebraska volleyball is one of the most popular spectator attractions in women&#x27;s sports. It has led the country in attendance each year since moving to the Bob Devaney Sports Center in 2013 and has sold out over 300 consecutive home matches, an NCAA record for any women&#x27;s sport. Before moving to the larger Devaney Center, Nebraska played at the historic NU Coliseum; the Cornhuskers had fifteen undefeated seasons and a record of 454–30 at the Coliseum, including a then-NCAA-record ninety consecutive home victories from 2005 to 2009. On August 30, 2023, NU hosted Omaha at Memorial Stadium – the event&#x27;s official attendance was 92,003, the highest ever for a women&#x27;s sporting event.

*Conference championships (35): 1976–1992, 1994–1996, 1998–2002, 2004–2008, 2010, 2011, 2016, 2017, 2023

*NCAA Division I championships (5): 1995, 2000, 2006, 2015, 2017

Beach volleyball

Nebraska added beach volleyball as the school&#x27;s twenty-second intercollegiate varsity sport in 2013. In 2016, the NCAA began sponsoring a beach volleyball tournament (previously the sport was run by the AVCA), but Nebraska did not attempt to qualify. Nebraska runs one of the only beach volleyball programs in the Midwest and plays the bulk of its season during a spring break trip to California or Hawaii. NU&#x27;s beach roster is made up entirely of players from its indoor program, and head coach John Cook has said the school views beach volleyball primarily as a training and recruiting tool for its indoor team. Beach volleyball competes as an independent, making it one of only three programs at Nebraska not affiliated with the Big Ten.

On March 8, 2017, Nebraska hosted Missouri Baptist at the Hawks Championship Center. The match was closed to the public due to space limitations, but was noteworthy as the first collegiate beach volleyball match to take place in the state of Nebraska.

In 2007, Jordan Larson and Sarah Pavan defeated student-athletes from seven other schools to win the Collegiate Beach Volleyball Championship, an invitational tournament featuring two players per school.

===Wrestling===
Nebraska&#x27;s wrestling program began in 1910 under the guidance of head coach R. G. Clapp. Despite modest success in the program&#x27;s early years, NU has been a mainstay in the national top ten since Tim Neumann was hired in 1985. Mark Manning has led the Huskers since 2000 and twice won conference coach of the year. Former Nebraska standouts include 2000 Olympic gold medalist and 2004 bronze medalist Rulon Gardner, and two-time NCAA champion and 2012 Olympic gold medalist Jordan Burroughs.

==Club sports==

The University of Nebraska–Lincoln sponsors club programs in badminton, baseball, women&#x27;s basketball, bowling, broomball, climbing, cricket, curling, cycling, dodgeball, golf, men&#x27;s hockey, women&#x27;s hockey, judo, women&#x27;s lacrosse, pickleball, rifle, rowing, men&#x27;s rugby, running, sailing, shotgun, women&#x27;s soccer, fast-pitch softball, swimming, table tennis, taekwondo, tennis, men&#x27;s ultimate Frisbee, men&#x27;s volleyball, women&#x27;s volleyball, and water ski.

==Athletic directors==

In its earliest days, the Nebraska Department of Athletics had no central figure serving as the head of the department, and the history of how this position developed is unclear. Early on, the head of the athletics department often had only a partial or part-time role and held other titles and responsibilities. The first six heads of the Athletics Department held the title &quot;Athletics Manager,&quot; first held by Raymond G. Clapp, NU&#x27;s basketball coach and a professor of physical education. The first individual to hold the title &quot;athletic director&quot; was E. J. Stewart, who served from 1916 to 1919, while also coaching men&#x27;s basketball and football during parts of his tenure. However, he is not considered Nebraska&#x27;s first athletic director because it was not considered a full-time administrative position by the Board of Regents; this designation belong to Fred Luehring, who held the position from 1920 to 1922.

Many of Nebraska&#x27;s athletic directors simultaneously coached one of the university&#x27;s varsity programs. These included basketball, baseball, and swimming, but the majority of dual-role administrators were football coaches: Stewart, Fred Dawson, Dana X. Bible, Biff Jones, Glenn Presnell, Adolph J. Lewandowski, George Clark, and Bob Devaney. NU&#x27;s longest-serving athletic director was Devaney, who led the department from 1967 to 1992. Troy Dannen was appointed Nebraska&#x27;s seventeenth full-time athletic director on March 21, 2024.

==Facilities==

==Nebraska Athletic Hall of Fame==
The University of Nebraska Athletic Hall of Fame was established in 2015, located just northeast of Memorial Stadium. Twenty-two former student-athletes were honored in the inaugural class. At least one student-athlete from each of Nebraska&#x27;s varsity sports has been inducted into the Hall of Fame. Football is the most-represented sport with sixteen student-athletes and coaches inducted.

==Olympians==
A total of 120 Nebraska athletes have combined to make in 176 appearances in the Olympic Games. Nebraska athletes and coaches have won sixty-two medals, including nineteen gold medals, while representing thirty-one countries. Merlene Ottey is Nebraska&#x27;s most decorated Olympian in terms of medals won, winning three silver and seven six bronze across seven Olympic Games, a record for track and field competitors. South African swimmer Penelope Heyns – the only Cornhusker with multiple gold medals – is the only woman to ever win the 100- and 200-meter breaststroke events at the same Olympic Games.

==Mascots==

Nebraska cycled through several official mascots before settling on the now-familiar Herbie Husker and Lil&#x27; Red. The first of these was Corncob Man, a man in green overalls with an ear of corn for a head. After just a few years, the university sought a more &quot;representative&quot; mascot and debuted Huskie the Husker, a farmer who stood ten feet tall and wore overalls with a straw hat on top of a fiberglass head. Huskie soon gave way to Mr. Big Red (more commonly known as Harry Husker); Harry was equally tall but dressed in a blazer and red wide-brim hat. Harry&#x27;s head was so large it couldn&#x27;t fit on the team&#x27;s traveling bus and was so heavy the student wearing the costume had to be switched every forty-five minutes.

The physical demands of the Harry costume meant the university was soon looking for another mascot, and in 1974 NU acquired the rights to Herbie Husker, based on the design of Lubbock, Texas artist Dirk West. Nebraska hired Disney cartoonist Bob Johnson to refine West&#x27;s design into a costume and Herbie made his first appearance at a Nebraska football game at the 1974 Cotton Bowl Classic, a 19–3 Cornhuskers victory over Texas. Mr. Big Red wasn&#x27;t officially retired until 1988, but was infrequently seen while coexisting with Herbie.

Historically, Herbie had blond hair and dressed in denim overalls (with an ear of corn in the pocket), a white undershirt, and a red cowboy hat. Prior to the 2003 season, Herbie&#x27;s appearance was altered to include a red workshirt, blue jeans, and workboots in an effort to update the overall appearance of the state&#x27;s agricultural workers and general public; however, the new design was not well-received and many of the modifications were reverted in 2023.

Since 1994, Herbie has often been joined on the sideline by the inflatable Lil&#x27; Red. Initially, Lil&#x27; Red was created to appeal to younger fans and to primarily represent the school&#x27;s volleyball team, which occasionally played at the same time as Nebraska&#x27;s football team. Lil&#x27; Red was so popular that then-athletic director Bill Byrne considered discontinuing Herbie entirely, but later decided the mascots would coexist. The mascots are now frequently seen together across all sports.

Herbie was named the 2005 National Mascot of the year at halftime of the 2006 Capital One Bowl. Lil&#x27; Red won the NCA National Mascot Competition in 1999 and was inducted into the Mascot Hall of Fame in 2007.

==Fan support==

Decades of high attendance and well-traveling crowds across all sports have earned Nebraska fans a reputation for being fiercely loyal and dedicated. The school&#x27;s athletic department proclaimed their fans &quot;the greatest fans in college football&quot; in an inscription above each of the twenty-four gates at Memorial Stadium. In 2001, President George W. Bush stated that he &quot;can&#x27;t go without saying how impressed I am by the Nebraska fan base. Whether it be for women&#x27;s volleyball or football, there&#x27;s nothing like the Big Red.&quot;

Memorial Stadium is sometimes referred to as &quot;The Sea of Red&quot; due to the home crowd&#x27;s propensity to wear the color. Nebraska has sold out every home football game since November 3, 1962; at 389 it is the longest sellout streak in college athletics history. The streak, historically a source of pride for the school and its fans, has been scrutinized in the decades following Tom Osborne&#x27;s retirement as NU&#x27;s athletic department has occasionally been forced to sell a large number of tickets at a discounted rate to keep the streak alive. Cornhuskers fans are noted for often applauding the visiting team as they leave the field at the end of the game. Nebraska is considered to have one of the best-traveling fanbases in the country – the most famous example of this occurred in 2000, when an estimated 35,000 Nebraska fans watched No. 1 Nebraska defeat No. 25 Notre Dame at Notre Dame Stadium.

Nebraska&#x27;s volleyball program has sold out 303 consecutive matches between the Nebraska Coliseum and Devaney Center, the longest streak of its kind in women&#x27;s college sports. The Cornhuskers have led the country in attendance for nine straight seasons, and have played in nine of the ten highest-attended college volleyball matches ever played. Nebraska&#x27;s five-set loss to Wisconsin in the 2021 national championship match broke college volleyball records for both attendance and viewership.

==Academic success==

Nebraska has produced 347 Academic All-Americans, more than any other Division I school and second only to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology among all universities. Nebraska&#x27;s 108 Academic All-Americans in football is forty-one more than second-place Penn State; the school also leads all volleyball programs in Academic All-Americans with thirty-eight.

<text>George Ivanovich Gurdjieff ( – 29 October 1949) was a Greek–Armenian philosopher, mystic, spiritual teacher, composer, and movements teacher. Gurdjieff taught that people are not conscious of themselves and thus live their lives in a state of hypnotic &quot;waking sleep&quot;, but that it is possible to awaken to a higher state of consciousness and serve our purpose as human beings. The practice of his teaching has become known as &quot;The Work&quot; (connoting work on oneself) and is additional to the ways of the Fakirs (Sufis), Monks and Yogis, so that his student P. D. Ouspensky referred to it as the &quot;Fourth Way&quot;.

Gurdjieff&#x27;s teaching has inspired the formation of many groups around the world. After his death in 1949, the Gurdjieff Foundation in Paris was established and led by his close pupil Jeanne de Salzmann in cooperation with other direct pupils of Gurdjieff, until her death in 1990; and then by her son Michel de Salzmann, until his death in 2001.

The International Association of the Gurdjieff Foundations comprises the Institut Gurdjieff in France; The Gurdjieff Foundation in the USA; The Gurdjieff Society in the UK; and the Gurdjieff Foundation in Venezuela.

== Early life ==
Gurdjieff was born in Alexandropol, Yerevan Governorate, Russian Empire (now Gyumri, Armenia). His father Ivan Ivanovich Gurdjieff was Greek, and a renowned ashugh under the pseudonym of &quot;Adash&quot;, who in the 1870s managed large herds of cattle and sheep. The long-held view is that Gurdjieff&#x27;s mother was Armenian, although some scholars have recently speculated that she too was Greek. According to Gurdjieff himself, his father came of a Greek family whose ancestors had emigrated from Byzantium after the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, with his family initially moving to central Anatolia, and from there eventually to Georgia in the Caucasus.

There are conflicting views regarding Gurdjieff&#x27;s birth date, ranging from 1866 to 1877. The bulk of extant records weigh heavily toward 1877, but Gurdjieff in reported conversations with students gave the year of his birth as , which is corroborated by the account of his niece Luba Gurdjieff Everitt and accords with photographs and videos taken of him in 1949. George Kiourtzidis, great-grandson of Gurdjieff&#x27;s paternal uncle Vasilii (through Vasilii&#x27;s son Alexander), recalled that his grandfather Alexander, born in 1875, said that Gurdjieff was about three years older than him, which would point to a birth date . Although official documents consistently record the day of his birth as 28 December, Gurdjieff himself celebrated his birthday either on the Old Orthodox Julian calendar date of 1 January, or according to the Gregorian calendar date for New Year of 13 January (up to 1899; 14 January after 1900). The year of 1872 is inscribed in a plate on the grave-marker in the cemetery of Avon, Seine-et-Marne, France, where his body was buried.

Gurdjieff spent his childhood in Kars, which, from 1878 to 1918, was the administrative capital of the Russian-ruled Transcaucasus province of Kars Oblast, a border region recently acquired following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire. It contained extensive grassy plateau-steppe and high mountains, and was inhabited by a multi-ethnic and multi-confessional population that had a history of respect for travelling mystics and holy men, and for religious syncretism and conversion. Both the city of Kars and the surrounding territory were home to an extremely diverse population: although part of the Armenian Plateau, the Russian-ruled Transcaucasus province of Kars Oblast was home to Armenians, Caucasus Greeks, Pontic Greeks, Georgians, Russians, Kurds, Turks, and smaller numbers of Christian communities from eastern and central Europe such as Caucasus Germans, Estonians, and Russian Orthodox sectarian communities like the Molokans, Doukhobors, Pryguny, and Subbotniks.

Gurdjieff makes particular mention of the Yazidi community. Growing up in a multi-ethnic society, Gurdjieff became fluent in Armenian, Pontic Greek, Russian, and Turkish, speaking the last in a mixture of elegant Ottoman Turkish with some dialect. He later acquired &quot;a working facility with several European languages&quot;.

Early influences on him included his father, a carpenter and amateur &quot;ashik&quot; or bardic poet, and the priest of the town&#x27;s cathedral, Dean Borsh, a family friend. The young Gurdjieff avidly read literature from many sources and influenced by these writings and witnessing a number of phenomena that he could not explain, he formed the conviction that there existed a hidden truth known to mankind in the past, which could not be ascertained from science or mainstream religion.

===Travels===
In early adulthood, according to his own account, Gurdjieff&#x27;s search for such knowledge led him to travel widely to Central Asia, Egypt, Iran, India, Tibet and other places before he returned to Russia for a few years in 1912. He was never forthcoming about the source of his teaching, which he once labelled as esoteric Christianity, in that it ascribes a psychological rather than a literal meaning to various parables and statements found in the Bible. The only account of his wanderings appears in his book &quot;Meetings with Remarkable Men&quot;, which is not generally considered to be a reliable autobiography. One example is of the adventure of walking across the Gobi desert on stilts, where Gurdjieff said he was able to look down on the contours of the sand dunes while the sand storm whirled around below him. Each chapter is named after a &quot;remarkable man&quot;, some of whom were putative members of a society called &quot;The Seekers of Truth&quot;.

After Gurdjieff&#x27;s death, J. G. Bennett researched his potential sources and suggested that the men were symbolic of the three types of people to whom Gurdjieff referred: No. 1 centred in their physical body; No. 2 centred in their emotions and No. 3 centred in their mind. Gurdjieff describes how he encountered dervishes, fakirs and descendants of the Essenes, whose teaching he said had been conserved at a monastery in Sarmoung. The book also has an overarching quest involving a map of &quot;pre-sand Egypt&quot; and culminates in an encounter with the &quot;Sarmoung Brotherhood&quot;.

Gurdjieff wrote that he supported himself during his travels by engaging in various enterprises such as running a travelling repair shop and making paper flowers; and on one occasion while thinking about what he could do, he described catching sparrows in the park and then dyeing them yellow to be sold as canaries; It is also speculated by commentators that during his travels he was engaged in a certain amount of political activity, as part of The Great Game.

==Career==
From 1913 to 1949, the chronology appears to be based on material that can be confirmed by primary documents, independent witnesses, cross-references and reasonable inference. On New Year&#x27;s Day in 1912, Gurdjieff arrived in Moscow and attracted his first students, including his cousin, the sculptor Sergey Merkurov, and the eccentric Rachmilievitch. In the same year, he married the Polish Julia Ostrowska in Saint Petersburg. In 1914, Gurdjieff advertised his ballet, &quot;The Struggle of the Magicians,&quot; and he supervised his pupils&#x27; writing of the sketch &quot;Glimpses of Truth.&quot;

===Gurdjieff and Ouspensky===
In 1915, Gurdjieff accepted P. D. Ouspensky as a pupil, and in 1916, he accepted the composer Thomas de Hartmann and his wife, Olga, as students. He then had about 30 pupils. Ouspensky already had a reputation as a writer on mystical subjects and had conducted his own, ultimately disappointing, search for wisdom in the East. The Fourth Way &quot;system&quot; taught during this period was complex and metaphysical, partly expressed in scientific terminology.

During the revolutionary upheaval in Russia, Gurdjieff left Petrograd in 1917 to return to his family home in Alexandropol (present-day Gyumri in Armenia). During the October Revolution, he set up a temporary study community in Essentuki in the Caucasus, where he worked intensively with a small group of Russian pupils. Gurdjieff&#x27;s eldest sister Anna and her family later arrived there as refugees, informing him that Turks had shot his father in Alexandropol on 15 May. As the area became increasingly threatened by civil war, Gurdjieff fabricated a newspaper story announcing his forthcoming &quot;scientific expedition&quot; to &quot;Mount Induc&quot;. Posing as a scientist and wearing a red fireman&#x27;s belt with brass rings Gurdjieff left Essentuki with fourteen companions (excluding Gurdjieff&#x27;s family and Ouspensky). They travelled by train to Maikop, where hostilities delayed them for three weeks. In the spring of 1919, Gurdjieff met the artist Alexandre de Salzmann and his wife Jeanne and accepted them as pupils. Assisted by Jeanne de Salzmann, Gurdjieff gave the first public demonstration of his Sacred Dances (Movements at the Tbilisi Opera House, 22 June).

In March 1918, Ouspensky separated from Gurdjieff, settling in England and teaching the Fourth Way in his own right. The two men were to have a very ambivalent relationship for decades to come.

===Georgia and Turkey===
In 1919, Gurdjieff and his closest pupils moved to Tbilisi, Georgia, where Gurdjieff&#x27;s wife Julia Ostrowska, the Stjoernvals, the Hartmanns, and the de Salzmanns continued to assimilate his teaching. Gurdjieff concentrated on his still unstaged ballet, &quot;The Struggle of the Magicians&quot;. Thomas de Hartmann (who had made his debut years ago, before Tsar Nicholas II of Russia), worked on the music for the ballet, and Olga Ivanovna Hinzenberg (who years later wed the American architect Frank Lloyd Wright), practiced the dances. It was here that Gurdjieff opened his first Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man.

In late May 1920, when political and social conditions in Georgia deteriorated, his party travelled to Batumi on the Black Sea coast and then by ship to Constantinople (today Istanbul). Gurdjieff rented an apartment on Kumbaracı Street in Péra and later at 13 Abdullatif Yemeneci Sokak near the Galata Tower. The apartment is near the Khanqah (Sufi lodge) of the Mevlevi Order (a Sufi order following the teachings of Jalal al-Din Muhammad Rumi), where Gurdjieff, Ouspensky and Thomas de Hartmann witnessed the &quot;Sama&quot; ceremony of the Whirling Dervishes. In Istanbul, Gurdjieff also met his future pupil, Capt. John G. Bennett, then head of the British Directorate of Military Intelligence in Ottoman Turkey, who described his impression of Gurdjieff as follows:
It was there that I first met Gurdjieff in the autumn of 1920, and no surroundings could have been more appropriate. In Gurdjieff, East and West do not just meet. Their difference is annihilated in a world outlook which knows no distinctions of race or creed. This was my first, and has remained one of my strongest impressions. A Greek from the Caucasus, he spoke Turkish with an accent of unexpected purity, the accent that one associates with those born and bred in the narrow circle of the Imperial Court. His appearance was striking enough even in Turkey, where one saw many unusual types. His head was shaven, immense black moustache, eyes which at one moment seemed very pale and at another almost black. Below average height, he gave nevertheless an impression of great physical strength.
===&quot;Prieuré&quot; at Avon===
In August 1921 and 1922, Gurdjieff travelled around western Europe, lecturing and giving demonstrations of his work in various cities, such as Berlin and London. He attracted the allegiance of Ouspensky&#x27;s many prominent pupils (notably the editor A. R. Orage). After an unsuccessful attempt to gain British citizenship, Gurdjieff established the Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man south of Paris at the &quot;Prieuré des Basses Loges&quot; in Avon near the famous &quot;Château de Fontainebleau.&quot; The once-impressive but somewhat crumbling mansion set in extensive grounds housed an entourage of several dozen, including some of Gurdjieff&#x27;s remaining relatives and some White Russian refugees. Gurdjieff is quoted by his students in &quot;Views from the Real World&quot; as saying: &quot;The Institute can help one to be able to be a Christian.&quot; An aphorism was displayed which stated: &quot;Here there are neither Russians nor English, Jews nor Christians, but only those who pursue one aimto be able to be.&quot;

New pupils included C. S. Nott, , Margaret Anderson and her ward Fritz Peters. The intellectual and middle-class types who were attracted to Gurdjieff&#x27;s teaching often found the Prieuré&#x27;s spartan accommodation and emphasis on hard labour on the grounds disconcerting. Gurdjieff was putting into practice his teaching that people need to develop physically, emotionally and intellectually, so lectures, music, dance, and manual work were organised. Older pupils noticed how the Prieuré teaching differed from the complex metaphysical &quot;system&quot; that had been taught in Russia. In addition to the physical hardships, his personal behaviour towards pupils could be ferocious:
Gurdjieff was standing by his bed in a state of what seemed to me to be completely uncontrolled fury. He was raging at Orage, who stood impassively and very pale, framed in one of the windows... Suddenly, in the space of an instant, Gurdjieff&#x27;s voice stopped, his whole personality changed and he gave me a broad smile—and looking incredibly peaceful and inwardly quiet, motioned me to leave. He then resumed his tirade with undiminished force. This happened so quickly that I do not believe that Mr. Orage even noticed the break in the rhythm.
During this period, Gurdjieff acquired notoriety as &quot;the man who killed Katherine Mansfield&quot; after Katherine Mansfield died there of tuberculosis on 9 January 1923. However, James Moore and Ouspensky argue that Mansfield knew she would soon die and that Gurdjieff made her last days happy and fulfilling.

===First car accident, writing and visits to North America===

Starting in 1924, Gurdjieff made visits to North America, where he eventually received the pupils taught previously by A. R. Orage. In 1924, while driving alone from Paris to Fontainebleau, he had a near-fatal car accident. Nursed by his wife and mother, he made a slow and painful recovery against all medical expectations. Still convalescent, he formally &quot;disbanded&quot; his institute on 26 August (in fact he dispersed only his &quot;less dedicated&quot; pupils) which he expressed was a personal undertaking: &quot;in the future, under the pretext of different worthy reasons, to remove from my eyesight all those who by this or that make my life too comfortable&quot;.

Whilst recovering from his injuries and still too weak to write himself, he began to dictate his magnum opus, &quot;Beelzebub&#x27;s Tales&quot;, the first part of &quot;All and Everything&quot;, in a mixture of Armenian and Russian. The book is generally found to be convoluted and obscure and forces the reader to &quot;work&quot; to find its meaning. He continued to develop the book over some years, writing in noisy cafes which he found conducive for setting down his thoughts.

Gurdjieff&#x27;s mother died in 1925 and his wife developed cancer and died in June 1926. Ouspensky attended her funeral. According to the writer Fritz Peters, Gurdjieff was in New York from November 1925 to the spring of 1926, when he succeeded in raising over $100,000. He was to make six or seven trips to the US, but alienated a number of people with his brash and impudent demands for money.

A Chicago-based Gurdjieff group was founded by Jean Toomer in 1927 after he had trained at the Prieuré for a year. Diana Huebert was a regular member of the Chicago group, and documented the several visits Gurdjieff made to the group in 1932 and 1934 in her memoirs on the man.

Despite his fund-raising efforts in America, the Prieuré operation ran into debt and was shut down in 1932. Gurdjieff constituted a new teaching group in Paris. Known as The Rope, it was composed of only women, many of them writers, and several lesbians. Members included Kathryn Hulme, Jane Heap, Margaret Anderson and Enrico Caruso&#x27;s widow, Dorothy. Gurdjieff became acquainted with Gertrude Stein through its members, but she was never a follower.

In 1935, Gurdjieff stopped work on &quot;All and Everything.&quot; He had completed the first two parts of the planned trilogy but then started on the &quot;Third Series.&quot; (It was later published under the title &quot;Life Is Real Only Then, When &#x27;I Am&#x27;.&quot;) In 1936, he settled in a flat at 6, in Paris, where he was to stay for the rest of his life. In 1937, his brother Dmitry died, and The Rope disbanded.

==World War II==
Although the flat at 6 Rue des Colonels-Renard was very small, he continued to teach groups of pupils there throughout the war. Visitors have described his pantry or &#x27;inner sanctum&#x27; as being stocked with an extraordinary collection of eastern delicacies and the suppers he held with elaborate toasts with vodka and cognac to &quot;idiots&quot;. Having cut a physically impressive figure for many years, he was now paunchy. His teaching was now conveyed more directly through personal interaction with his pupils, who were encouraged to study the ideas he had expressed in &quot;Beelzebub&#x27;s Tales&quot;.

His personal business enterprises (including intermittently dealing in oriental rugs and carpets for much of his life, among other activities) enabled him to offer charitable relief to neighbours who had been affected by the difficult circumstances of the war, and it also brought him to the attention of the authorities, leading to a night in the cells.

==Final years==
After the war, Gurdjieff tried to reconnect with his former pupils. Ouspensky was hesitant, but after his death (October 1947), his widow advised his remaining pupils to see Gurdjieff in Paris. J. G. Bennett also visited from England, their first meeting in 25 years. Ouspensky&#x27;s pupils in England had all thought that Gurdjieff was dead. They discovered he was alive only after the death of Ouspensky, who had not told them that Gurdjieff, from whom he had learnt of the teaching, was still living. They were overjoyed and many of Ouspensky&#x27;s pupils including Rina Hands, Basil Tilley and Catherine Murphy visited Gurdjieff in Paris. Hands and Murphy worked on the typing and retyping for the publication of &quot;All and Everything&quot;.

Gurdjieff suffered a second car accident in 1948 but again made an unexpected recovery.

&quot;I was looking at a dying man. Even this is not enough to express it. It was a dead man, a corpse, that came out of the car; and yet it walked. I was shivering like someone who sees a ghost.&quot;

With iron-like tenacity, he managed to get to his room, where he sat down and said: &quot;Now all organs are destroyed. Must make new&quot;. Then, he turned to Bennett, smiling: &quot;Tonight you come dinner. I must make body work&quot;. As he spoke, a great spasm of pain shook his body and blood gushed from an ear. Bennett thought: &quot;He has a cerebral haemorrhage. He will kill himself if he continues to force his body to move&quot;. But then he reflected: &quot;He has to do all this. If he allows his body to stop moving, he will die. He has power over his body&quot;.

After recovering, Gurdjieff finalised plans for the official publication of &quot;Beelzebub&#x27;s Tales&quot; and made two trips to New York. He also visited the famous prehistoric cave paintings at Lascaux, giving his interpretation of their significance to his pupils.

==Death==
Gurdjieff died of cancer at the American Hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, on 29 October 1949. His funeral took place at the St. Alexandre Nevsky Russian Orthodox Cathedral at 12 Rue Daru, Paris. He is buried in the cemetery at Avon (near Fontainebleau).

==Personal life==
===Children===
Although no evidence or documents have certified anyone as a child of Gurdjieff, the following six people are quoted to be his children:
* Nikolai Stjernvall (1919–2010), whose mother was Elizaveta Grigorievna, wife of Leonid Robertovich de Stjernvall.
* Michel de Salzmann (1923–2001), whose mother was Jeanne Allemand de Salzmann; he later became head of the Gurdjieff Foundation.
* Cynthie Sophia &quot;Dushka&quot; Howarth (1924–2010); her mother was dancer Jessmin Howarth. She went on to found the Gurdjieff Heritage Society.
* Eve Taylor (born 1928), whose mother was one of his followers, American socialite Edith Annesley Taylor.
* Sergei Chaverdian; his mother was Lily Galumnian Chaverdian.
* Andrei, born to a mother known only as Georgii.

Gurdjieff had a niece, Luba Gurdjieff Everitt, who for about 40 years (1950s–1990s) ran a small but rather famous restaurant, Luba&#x27;s Bistro, in Knightsbridge, London.

==Ideas==

Gurdjieff taught that people cannot perceive reality as they are, because they are not conscious of themselves, but rather live in a state of hypnotic &quot;waking sleep&quot; of constantly turning thoughts, worries and imagination. The title of one of his books is &quot;Life is Real, Only Then, when &quot;I am&quot;&quot;.

&quot;Man lives his life in sleep, and in sleep he dies.&quot;
As a result, a person perceives the world while in a state of dream. He asserted that people in their ordinary waking state function as unconscious automatons, but that a person can &quot;wake up&quot; and become what a human being ought to be.

Some contemporary researchers claim that Gurdjieff&#x27;s concept of self-remembering is &quot;close to the Buddhist concept of awareness or a popular definition of &#x27;mindfulness&#x27;... The Buddhist term translated into English as &#x27;mindfulness&#x27; originates in the Pali term &#x27;sati&#x27;, which is identical to Sanskrit &#x27;smṛti&#x27;. Both terms mean &#x27;to remember&#x27;.&quot; As Gurdjieff himself said at a meeting held in his Paris flat during the Second World War: &quot;Our aim is to have constantly a sensation of oneself, of one&#x27;s individuality: this sensation cannot be expressed intellectually, because it is organic. It is something which makes you independent, when you are with other people.&quot;

===Self-development teachings===

Gurdjieff argued that many of the existing forms of religious and spiritual tradition on Earth had lost connection with their original meaning and vitality and so could no longer serve humanity in the way that had been intended at their inception. As a result, humans were failing to realize the truths of ancient teachings and were instead becoming more and more like automatons, susceptible to control from outside and increasingly capable of otherwise unthinkable acts of mass psychosis such as World War I. At best, the various surviving sects and schools could provide only a one-sided development, which did not result in a fully integrated human being.

According to Gurdjieff, only one of the three dimensions of a person—namely, either the emotions, or the physical body or the mind—tends to develop in such schools and sects, and generally at the expense of the other faculties or &quot;centres,&quot; as Gurdjieff called them. As a result, these ways fail to produce a properly balanced human being. Furthermore, anyone wishing to undertake any of the traditional paths to spiritual knowledge (which Gurdjieff reduced to three—namely the way of the Fakir, the way of the Monk, and the way of the Yogi) were required to renounce life in the world. But Gurdjieff also described a &quot;Fourth Way&quot; which would be amenable to the requirements of contemporary people living in Europe and America. Instead of training the mind, body and emotions separately, Gurdjieff&#x27;s discipline worked on all three to promote an organic connection between them and a balanced development.

In parallel with other spiritual traditions, Gurdjieff taught that a person must expend considerable effort to effect the transformation that leads to awakening. Gurdjieff referred to it as &quot;The Work&quot; or &quot;Work on oneself&quot;. According to Gurdjieff, &quot;Working on oneself is not so difficult as wishing to work, taking the decision.&quot;
Though Gurdjieff never put major significance on the term &quot;Fourth Way&quot; and never used the term in his writings, his pupil P. D. Ouspensky from 1924 to 1947 made the term and its use central to his own interpretation of Gurdjieff&#x27;s teaching. After Ouspensky&#x27;s death, his students published a book titled &quot;The Fourth Way&quot; based on his lectures.

Gurdjieff&#x27;s teaching addressed the question of humanity&#x27;s place in the universe and the importance of developing its latent potentialities—regarded as our natural endowment as human beings, but which was rarely brought to fruition. He taught that higher levels of consciousness, higher bodies, inner growth and development are real possibilities that nonetheless require conscious work to achieve. The aim was not to acquire anything new but to recover what we had lost.

In his teaching, Gurdjieff gave a distinct meaning to various ancient texts such as the Bible and many religious prayers. He believed that such texts possess meanings very different from those commonly attributed to them. &quot;Sleep not&quot;; &quot;Awake, for you know not the hour&quot;; and &quot;The Kingdom of Heaven is Within&quot; are examples of biblical statements which point to teachings whose essence has been forgotten.

Gurdjieff taught people how to strengthen and focus their attention and energy in various ways so as to minimize daydreaming and absentmindedness. According to his teaching, this inner development of oneself is the beginning of a possible further process of change, the aim of which is to transform people into what Gurdjieff believed they ought to be.

Distrusting &quot;morality&quot;, which he describes as varying from culture to culture, often contradictory and hypocritical, Gurdjieff greatly stressed the importance of &quot;conscience&quot;.

To provide conditions in which inner attention could be exercised more intensively, Gurdjieff also taught his pupils &quot;sacred dances&quot; or &quot;movements&quot;, later known as the Gurdjieff movements, which they performed together as a group. He also left a body of music, inspired by what he heard in visits to remote monasteries and other places, written for piano in collaboration with one of his pupils, Thomas de Hartmann.

Gurdjieff used various exercises, such as the &quot;Stop&quot; exercise, to prompt self-observation in his students. Other shocks to help awaken his pupils from constant daydreaming were always possible at any moment.

===Methods===
&quot;The Work&quot; is not an intellectual pursuit and neither is it a new concept, but rather it is a practical way of living &quot;in the moment&quot; so as to allow consciousness of oneself (&quot;self-remembering&quot;) to appear. Gurdjieff used a number of methods and materials to wake up his followers, which apart from his own living presence, included meetings, music, movements (sacred dance), writings, lectures, and innovative forms of group and individual work. The purpose of these various methods was to &#x27;put a spanner in the works&#x27;, so as to permit a connection to be made between mind and body, which is easily talked about, but which has to be experienced to understand what it means. Since each individual is different, Gurdjieff did not have a one-size-fits-all approach and employed different means to impart what he himself had discovered. In Russia he was described as keeping his teaching confined to a small circle, whereas in Paris and North America, he gave numerous public demonstrations.

Gurdjieff felt that the traditional methods to acquire self-knowledge—those of the Fakir, Monk, and Yogi (acquired, respectively, through pain, devotion, and study)—were inadequate on their own to achieve any real understanding. He instead advocated &quot;the way of the sly man&quot; as a shortcut to encouraging inner development that might otherwise take years of effort and without any real outcome. Instructive historical parallels can be found in the annals of Zen Buddhism, where teachers employed a variety of methods (sometimes highly unorthodox) to bring about the arising of insight in the student.

====Music====
Gurdjieff&#x27;s music is divided into three distinct periods. The &quot;first period&quot; is the early music, including music from the ballet &quot;Struggle of the Magicians&quot; and music for early movements dating to the years around 1918.

The &quot;second period&quot; music, for which Gurdjieff arguably became best known, written in collaboration with Russian-born composer Thomas de Hartmann, is described as the Gurdjieff-de-Hartmann music. Dating to the mid-1920s, it offers a rich repertoire with roots in Caucasian and Central Asian folk and religious music, Russian Orthodox liturgical music, and other sources. This music was often first heard in the salon at the Prieuré, where much was composed. Since the publication of four volumes of this piano repertoire by Schott, recently completed, there has been a wealth of new recordings, including orchestral versions of music prepared by Gurdjieff and de Hartmann for the Movements demonstrations of 1923–1924. Solo piano versions of these works have been recorded by Cecil Lytle, Keith Jarrett, and Frederic Chiu.

The &quot;last musical period&quot; is the improvised harmonium music which often followed the dinners Gurdjieff held at his Paris apartment during the Occupation and immediate post-war years to his death in 1949. In all, Gurdjieff in collaboration with de Hartmann composed some 200 pieces. In May 2010, 38 minutes of unreleased solo piano music on acetate was purchased by Neil Kempfer Stocker from the estate of his late step-daughter, Dushka Howarth. In 2009, pianist Elan Sicroff released &quot;Laudamus: The Music of Georges Ivanovitch Gurdjieff and Thomas de Hartmann&quot;, consisting of a selection of Gurdjieff/de Hartmann collaborations (as well as three early romantic works composed by de Hartmann in his teens). In 1998 Alessandra Celletti released &quot;Hidden Sources&quot; (Kha Records) with 18 tracks by Gurdjieff/de Hartmann.

The English concert pianist and composer Helen Perkin (married name Helen Adie) came to Gurdjieff through Ouspensky and first visited Gurdjieff in Paris after the war. She and her husband George Adie emigrated to Australia in 1965 and established the Gurdjieff Society of Newport. Recordings of her performing music by Thomas de Hartmann were issued on CD. But she was also a Movements teacher and composed music for the Movements as well. Some of this music has been published and privately circulated.

====Movements====

Movements, or sacred dances, constitute an integral part of the Gurdjieff work. Gurdjieff sometimes referred to himself as a &quot;teacher of dancing&quot; and gained initial public notice for his attempts to put on a ballet in Moscow called &quot;Struggle of the Magicians.&quot;

In &quot;Views from the Real World&quot; Gurdjieff wrote, &quot;You ask about the aim of the movements. To each position of the body corresponds a certain inner state and, on the other hand, to each inner state corresponds a certain posture. A man, in his life, has a certain number of habitual postures and he passes from one to another without stopping at those between. Taking new, unaccustomed postures enables you to observe yourself inside differently from the way you usually do in ordinary conditions.&quot;

Films of movements demonstrations are occasionally shown for private viewing by the Gurdjieff Foundations, and some examples are shown in a scene in the Peter Brook movie &quot;Meetings with Remarkable Men&quot;.

==Reception and influence==
Opinions on Gurdjieff&#x27;s writings and activities are divided. Sympathizers regard him as a charismatic master who brought new knowledge into Western culture, a psychology and cosmology that enable insights beyond those provided by established science. Osho described Gurdjieff as one of the most significant spiritual masters of this age. At the other end of the spectrum, some critics assert he was a charlatan with a large ego and a constant need for self-glorification.

Gurdjieff had a significant influence on some artists, writers, and thinkers, including Walter Inglis Anderson, Peter Brook, Kate Bush, Darby Crash, Muriel Draper, Robert Fripp, Keith Jarrett, Timothy Leary, Katherine Mansfield, Dennis Lewis, James Moore, A. R. Orage, P. D. Ouspensky, Maurice Nicoll, Louis Pauwels, Robert S. de Ropp, René Barjavel, Rene Daumal, George Russell, David Sylvian, Jean Toomer, Jeremy Lane, Therion, P. L. Travers, Alan Watts, Minor White, Colin Wilson, Robert Anton Wilson, Frank Lloyd Wright, John Zorn, and Franco Battiato.

Gurdjieff&#x27;s notable personal students include P. D. Ouspensky, Olga de Hartmann, Thomas de Hartmann, Jane Heap, Jeanne de Salzmann, Willem Nyland, Lord Pentland (Henry John Sinclair), John G. Bennett, Alfred Richard Orage, Maurice Nicoll, and Rene Daumal.

Gurdjieff gave new life and practical form to ancient teachings of both East and West. For example, the Socratic and Platonic emphasis on know thyself recurs in Gurdjieff&#x27;s teaching as the practice of self-observation. His teachings about self-discipline and restraint reflect Stoic teachings. The Hindu and Buddhist notion of attachment recurs in Gurdjieff&#x27;s teaching as the concept of identification. His descriptions of the &quot;three being-foods&quot; matches that of Ayurveda, and his statement that &quot;time is breath&quot; echoes Jyotish, the Vedic system of astrology. Similarly, his cosmology can be &quot;read&quot; against ancient and esoteric sources, respectively Neoplatonic and in such sources as Robert Fludd&#x27;s treatment of macrocosmic musical structures.

An aspect of Gurdjieff&#x27;s teachings which has come into prominence in recent decades is the enneagram geometric figure. For many students of the Gurdjieff tradition, the enneagram remains a koan, challenging and never fully explained. There have been many attempts to trace the origins of this version of the enneagram; some similarities to other figures have been found, but it seems that Gurdjieff was the first person to make the enneagram figure publicly known and that only he knew its true source. Others have used the enneagram figure in connection with personality analysis, principally with the Enneagram of Personality as developed by Oscar Ichazo, Claudio Naranjo and others. Most aspects of this application are not directly connected to Gurdjieff&#x27;s teaching or to his explanations of the enneagram.

Gurdjieff inspired the formation of many groups around the world after his death, all of which still function today and follow his ideas. The Gurdjieff Foundation, the largest organization influenced by the ideas of Gurdjieff, was organized by Jeanne de Salzmann during the early 1950s, and led by her in cooperation with fellow pupils of his. Other pupils of Gurdjieff formed independent groups. Willem Nyland, one of Gurdjieff&#x27;s closest students and an original founder and trustee of The Gurdjieff Foundation of New York, left to form his own groups in the early 1960s. Jane Heap was sent to London by Gurdjieff, where she led groups until her death in 1964. Louise Goepfert March, who became a pupil of Gurdjieff&#x27;s in 1929, started her own groups in 1957. Independent thriving groups were also formed and initially led by John G. Bennett and A. L. Staveley near Portland, Oregon.

Louis Pauwels, among others, criticizes Gurdjieff for his insistence on considering people as &quot;asleep&quot; in a state closely resembling &quot;hypnotic sleep&quot;. Gurdjieff said, even specifically at times, that a pious, good, and moral person was no more &quot;spiritually developed&quot; than any other person; they are all equally &quot;asleep&quot;.

Henry Miller approved of Gurdjieff not considering himself holy but, after writing a brief introduction to Fritz Peters&#x27; book &quot;Boyhood with Gurdjieff&quot;, Miller wrote that people are not meant to lead a &quot;harmonious life&quot; as Gurdjieff believed in naming his institute.

In &quot;Beelzebub&#x27;s Tales to His Grandson&quot;, Gurdjieff expresses his reverence for the founders of the mainstream religions of East and West and his contempt for what successive generations of believers have made of those religious teachings. His discussions of &quot;orthodoxhydooraki&quot; and &quot;heterodoxhydooraki&quot;—orthodox fools and heterodox fools, from the Russian word &quot;durak&quot; (fool)—position him as a critic of religious distortion and, in turn, as a target for criticism from some within those traditions. Gurdjieff has been interpreted by some, Ouspensky among others, to have had a total disregard for the value of mainstream religion, philanthropic work and the value of doing right or wrong in general.

Louis Pauwels wrote &quot;Monsieur Gurdjieff&quot; (first edition published in Paris in 1954 by Editions du Seuil). In an interview, Pauwels said of the Gurdjieff work: &quot;After two years of exercises which both enlightened and burned me, I found myself in a hospital bed with a thrombosed central vein in my left eye and weighing ninety-nine pounds ... Horrible anguish and abysses opened up for me. But it was my fault.&quot;

== Pupils ==
Gurdjieff&#x27;s notable pupils include:

Peter D. Ouspensky (1878–1947) was a Russian journalist, author and philosopher. He met Gurdjieff in 1915 and spent the next five years studying with him, then formed his own independent groups in London in 1921. Ouspensky became the first &quot;career&quot; Gurdjieffian and led independent Fourth Way groups in London and New York for his remaining years. He wrote &quot;In Search of the Miraculous&quot; about his encounters with Gurdjieff and it remains the best-known and most widely read account of Gurdjieff&#x27;s early experiments with groups.

Thomas de Hartmann (1885–1956) was a Russian composer. He and his wife Olga first met Gurdjieff in 1916 at Saint Petersburg. They remained Gurdjieff&#x27;s close students until 1929. During that time they lived at Gurdjieff&#x27;s Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man near Paris. Between July 1925 and May 1927 Thomas de Hartmann transcribed and co-wrote some of the music that Gurdjieff collected and used for his Movements exercises. They collaborated on hundreds of pieces of concert music arranged for the piano.

This concert music was first recorded and published privately from the 1950s to the 1980s. It was first issued publicly as the &quot;Music of Gurdjieff / de Hartmann&quot;, Thomas de Hartmann, piano by Triangle Records, with 49 tracks on 4 vinyl disks in 1998, then reissued as a 3-CD set containing 56 tracks in 1989. A more extensive compilation was later issued as the &quot;Gurdjieff / de Hartmann Music for the Piano&quot; in 4 printed volumes by Schott, between 1996 and 2005, and as audio CDs under the same title in four volumes, with nine discs recorded with three concert pianists, by Schott/Wergo between 1997 and 2001.

Olga de Hartmann (née Arkadievna de Schumacher; 1885–1979) was Gurdjieff&#x27;s personal secretary during their Prieuré years and took most of the original dictations of his writings during that period. She also authenticated Gurdjieff&#x27;s early talks in the book &quot;Views from the Real World&quot; (1973). The de Hartmanns&#x27; memoir, &quot;Our Life with Mr Gurdjieff&quot; (1st ed, 1964, 2nd ed, 1983, 3rd ed 1992), records their Gurdjieff years in great detail. Their Montreal Gurdjieff group, literary and musical estate is represented by retired Canadian National Film Board producer Tom Daly.

Jeanne de Salzmann (1889–1990). Alexander and Jeanne de Salzmann met Gurdjieff in Tiflis in 1919. She was originally a dancer and a Dalcroze Eurythmics teacher. She was, along with Jessmin Howarth and Rose Mary Nott, responsible for transmitting Gurdjieff&#x27;s choreographed movement exercises and institutionalizing Gurdjieff&#x27;s teachings through the Gurdjieff Foundation of New York, the Gurdjieff Institute of Paris, London&#x27;s Gurdjieff Society Inc., and other groups she established in 1953. She also established Triangle Editions in the US, which imprint claims copyright on all Gurdjieff&#x27;s posthumous writings.

John G. Bennett (1897–1974) was a British intelligence officer, polyglot (fluent in English, French, German, Turkish, Greek, and Italian), technologist, industrial research director, author, and teacher, best known for his many books on psychology and spirituality, particularly the teachings of Gurdjieff. Bennett met both Ouspensky and then Gurdjieff at Istanbul in 1920, spent August 1923 at Gurdjieff&#x27;s Institute, became Ouspensky&#x27;s pupil between 1922 and 1941 and, after learning that Gurdjieff was still alive, was one of Gurdjieff&#x27;s frequent visitors in Paris during 1949. See &quot;Witness: the Autobiography of John Bennett&quot; (1974), &quot;Gurdjieff: Making a New World&quot;(1974), &quot;Idiots in Paris: diaries of J. G. Bennett and Elizabeth Bennett, 1949&quot; (1991).

Alfred Richard Orage (1873–1934) was an influential British editor best known for the magazine &quot;New Age&quot;. He began attending Ouspensky&#x27;s London talks in 1921 and then met Gurdjieff when the latter first visited London early in 1922. Shortly thereafter, Orage sold &quot;New Age&quot; and relocated to Gurdjieff&#x27;s institute at the Prieré, and in 1924 was appointed by Gurdjieff to lead the institute&#x27;s branch in New York. After Gurdjieff&#x27;s nearly fatal automobile accident in July 1924 and because of his prolonged recuperation during 1924 and intense writing period for several years, Orage continued in New York until 1931. During this period, Orage was responsible for editing the English typescript of &quot;Beelzebub&#x27;s Tales&quot; (1931) and &quot;Meetings with Remarkable Men&quot; (1963) as Gurdjieff&#x27;s assistant. This period is described in some detail by Paul Beekman Taylor in his &quot;Gurdjieff and Orage: Brothers in Elysium&quot; (2001).

Maurice Nicoll (1884–1953) was a Harley Street psychiatrist and Carl Jung&#x27;s delegate in London. Along with Orage, he attended Ouspensky&#x27;s 1921 London talks where he met Gurdjieff. With his wife Catherine and their daughter, he spent almost a year at Gurdjieff&#x27;s Prieuré Institute. A year later, when they returned to London, Nicoll rejoined Ouspensky&#x27;s group. In 1931, on Ouspensky&#x27;s advice, he started his own Fourth Way groups in England. He is best known for the encyclopedic six-volume series of articles in &quot;Psychological Commentaries on the Teaching of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky&quot; (Boston: Shambhala, 1996, and Samuel Weiser Inc., 1996).

Willem Nyland (1890–1975) was a Dutch-American chemist who first met Gurdjieff early in 1924 during the latter&#x27;s first visit to the US. He was a charter member of the NY branch of Gurdjieff&#x27;s Institute, participated in Orage&#x27;s meetings between 1924 and 1931, and was a charter member of the Gurdjieff Foundation from 1953 and through its formative years. In the early 1960s he established an independent group in Warwick NY, where he began making reel-to-reel audio recordings of his meetings, which became archived in a private library of some 2600 90-minute audio tapes. Many of these tapes have also been transcribed and indexed, but remain unpublished. &quot;Gurdjieff Group Work with Wilhem (sic-Willem) Nyland&quot; (1983) by Irmis B. Popoff, sketches Nyland&#x27;s group work.

Jane Heap (1883–1964) was an American writer, editor, artist, and publisher. She met Gurdjieff during his 1924 visit to New York, and set up a Gurdjieff study group at her apartment in Greenwich Village. In 1925, she moved to Paris to study at Gurdjieff&#x27;s Institute, and re-established her group in Paris until 1935 when Gurdjieff sent her to London to lead the group that C. S. Nott had established and which she continued to lead until her death. Jane Heap&#x27;s Paris group became Gurdjieff&#x27;s &#x27;Rope&#x27; group after her departure, and contained several notable writers, including Margaret Anderson, Solita Solano, Kathryn Hulme, and others who proved helpful to Gurdjieff while he was editing his first two books.

Kenneth Macfarlane Walker (1882–1966) was a prominent British surgeon and prolific author. He was a member of Ouspensky&#x27;s London group for decades, and after the latter&#x27;s death in 1947 visited Gurdjieff in Paris many times. As well as many accessible medical books for lay readers, he wrote some of the earliest informed accounts of Gurdjieff&#x27;s ideas, &quot;Venture with Ideas&quot; (1951) and &quot;A Study of Gurdjieff&#x27;s Teaching&quot; (1957).

Henry John Sinclair, 2nd Baron Pentland (1907–1984), was a pupil of Ouspensky&#x27;s during the 1930s and 1940s. He visited Gurdjieff regularly in Paris in 1949, then was appointed as President of the Gurdjieff Foundation of America by Jeanne de Salzmann when she founded that institution in New York in 1953. He established the Gurdjieff Foundation of California in the mid-1950s and remained President of the US Foundation branches until his death. Pentland also became President of Triangle Editions when it was established in 1974.

==Writings==
Three books by Gurdjieff were published in the English language in the United States after his death: &quot;Beelzebub&#x27;s Tales to His Grandson&quot; published in 1950 by E. P. Dutton &amp; Co. Inc., &quot;Meetings with Remarkable Men&quot;, published in 1963 by E. P. Dutton &amp; Co. Inc., and &quot;Life is Real Only Then, When &#x27;I Am&#x27;&quot;, printed privately by E. P. Dutton &amp; Co. and published in 1978 by Triangle Editions Inc. for private distribution only. This trilogy is Gurdjieff&#x27;s legominism, known collectively as &quot;All and Everything&quot;. A &quot;legominism&quot; is, according to Gurdjieff, &quot;one of the means of transmitting information about certain events of long-past ages through initiates&quot;. A book of his early talks was also collected by his student and personal secretary, Olga de Hartmann, and published in 1973 as &quot;Views from the Real World: Early Talks in Moscow, Essentuki, Tiflis, Berlin, London, Paris, New York, and Chicago, as recollected by his pupils&quot;.

Gurdjieff&#x27;s views were initially promoted through the writings of his pupils. The best known and widely read of these is P. D. Ouspensky&#x27;s &quot;In Search of the Miraculous: Fragments of an Unknown Teaching&quot;, which is widely regarded as a crucial introduction to the teaching. Others refer to Gurdjieff&#x27;s own books as the primary texts. Numerous anecdotal accounts of time spent with Gurdjieff were published by Charles Stanley Nott, Thomas and Olga de Hartmann, Fritz Peters, René Daumal, John G. Bennett, Maurice Nicoll, Margaret Anderson and Louis Pauwels, among others.

The feature film &quot;Meetings with Remarkable Men&quot; (1979), loosely based on Gurdjieff&#x27;s book by the same name, ends with performances of Gurdjieff&#x27;s dances known simply as the &quot;exercises&quot; but later promoted as &quot;movements&quot;. Jeanne de Salzmann and Peter Brook wrote the film, Brook directed, and Dragan Maksimovic and Terence Stamp star, as does South African playwright and actor Athol Fugard.

Gurdjieff wrote a trilogy with the Series title &quot;All and Everything&quot;. The first volume, finalized by Gurdjieff shortly before his death and first published in 1950, is the First Series and titled &quot;An Objectively Impartial Criticism of the Life of Man&quot; or &quot;Beelzebub&#x27;s Tales to His Grandson&quot;. At 1238 pages it is a lengthy allegorical work that recounts the explanations of Beelzebub to his grandson concerning the beings of the planet Earth and laws which govern the universe. It provides a vast platform for Gurdjieff&#x27;s deeply considered philosophy. A controversial redaction of &quot;Beelzebub&#x27;s Tales&quot; was published by some of Gurdjieff&#x27;s followers as an alternative &quot;edition&quot;, in 1992.

On his page of &quot;Friendly Advice&quot; facing the first Contents page of &quot;Beelzebub&#x27;s Tales&quot; Gurdjieff lays out his own program of three obligatory initial readings of each of the three series in sequence and concludes, &quot;Only then will you be able to count upon forming your own impartial judgement, proper to yourself alone, on my writings. And only then can my hope be actualized that according to your understanding you will obtain the specific benefit for your self which I anticipate.&quot;

The posthumous second series, edited by Jeanne de Salzmann, is titled &quot;Meetings with Remarkable Men&quot; (1963) and is written in a seemingly accessible manner as a memoir of his early years, but also contains some &#x27;Arabian Nights&#x27; embellishments and allegorical statements. His posthumous Third Series, (&quot;Life Is Real Only Then, When &#x27;I Am&#x27;&quot;), written as if unfinished and also edited by Jeanne de Salzmann, contains an intimate account of Gurdjieff&#x27;s inner struggles during his later years, as well as transcripts of some of his lectures. An enormous and growing amount has been written about Gurdjieff&#x27;s ideas and methods, but his own challenging writings remain the primary sources.

<doc id="159454" wikidata="Q756930" url="?curid=159454" title="Closer (Joy Division album)">
<text>Closer is the second and final studio album by the English rock band Joy Division, released on 18 July 1980 by Factory Records. Produced by Martin Hannett, it was released two months after the suicide of the band&#x27;s lead singer and lyricist Ian Curtis. The album reached No. 6 on the UK Albums Chart and peaked at No. 3 in New Zealand in September 1981. &quot;Closer&quot; was also named &quot;NME&quot; Album of the Year. It was remastered and re-released in 2007.

Today, &quot;Closer&quot; is widely recognised as a seminal release of the post-punk era. Following the release of the non-album single &quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart&quot; in June 1980, the remaining members re-formed as New Order.

== Composition and recording ==
The songs on &quot;Closer&quot; were drawn from two distinct periods. The earlier guitar-driven compositions were written during the latter half of 1979: &quot;Atrocity Exhibition&quot;, &quot;Passover&quot;, &quot;Colony&quot;, &quot;A Means to an End&quot; and &quot;Twenty Four Hours&quot;. All were played live during that year, with some being recorded for various radio sessions. The album&#x27;s other songs were written in early 1980, and included more prominent use of synthesisers: &quot;Isolation&quot;, &quot;Heart and Soul&quot;, &quot;The Eternal&quot; and &quot;Decades&quot;. Most songs were written or structured during jam sessions in the band&#x27;s practice room.

Regarding the album&#x27;s lyrical content, Bernard Sumner recollected: &quot;We&#x27;d go to rehearsals and sit around and talk about really banal things. We&#x27;d do that until we couldn&#x27;t talk about banal things any more, then we&#x27;d pick up our instruments and record into a little cassette player. We didn&#x27;t talk about the music or the lyrics very much. We never analysed it.&quot;

&quot;Closer&quot; was recorded between 18 and 30 March 1980 at Britannia Row Studios in Islington, London. It was produced by Martin Hannett. His production has been highly praised, with &quot;Pitchfork&quot; describing it as &quot;sepulchral.&quot; However, as with their debut album, both Hook and Sumner were unhappy with Hannett&#x27;s work. Peter Hook later complained that the track &quot;Atrocity Exhibition&quot; was mixed on one of his days off, and when he heard the final product he was disappointed that the abrasiveness of his guitar part had been laden with effects and toned down. He wrote; &quot;I was like, head in hands, oh fucking hell, it&#x27;s happening again. &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; number two... Martin [Hannett] had melted the guitar with his Marshall Time Waster. Made it sound like somebody strangling a cat, and to my mind, absolutely killed the song. I was so annoyed with him and went in and gave him a piece of my mind but he just turned around and told me to fuck off.&quot;

The 1970 collection of &quot;condensed novels&quot; &quot;The Atrocity Exhibition&quot; by J. G. Ballard was an influence on the album, and shares its title with the opening track.

== Release ==

The album cover was designed by Martyn Atkins and Peter Saville, with a photograph of the Appiani family tomb in Genoa&#x27;s Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno adorning much of the sleeve. The photograph was taken by Bernard Pierre Wolff in 1978. In a 2007 documentary on the band, designer Saville commented that he, upon learning of singer Ian Curtis&#x27;s suicide, expressed immediate concern over the album&#x27;s design as it depicted a funeral theme, remarking &quot;we&#x27;ve got a tomb on the cover of the album!&quot;

&quot;Closer&quot; was released on 18 July 1980 by Factory Records, as a vinyl LP. The album reached No. 6 on the UK Albums Chart. It also peaked at No. 3 in New Zealand in September 1981. &quot;Closer&quot; was also named &quot;NME&quot; Album of the Year. The album, along with &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; and &quot;Still&quot;, was remastered and re-released in 2007. As with &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; and &quot;Still&quot;, the remaster was packaged with a bonus live disc, recorded at the University of London Union.

Factory boss Tony Wilson was pleased with the final album and predicted it would be a commercial success. Sumner recalled him saying at the time, &quot;You know, Bernard, this time next year you&#x27;ll be lounging by a swimming pool in LA with a cocktail in your hand.&quot; Sumner was less optimistic and &quot;just thought it was the most utterly ridiculous thing anyone had ever said to me.&quot;

== Critical reception ==

At the time of release, &quot;Sounds&quot; critic Dave McCullough wrote that there were &quot;dark strokes of gothic rock&quot; on &quot;Closer&quot;. He described the album as &quot;breathtaking rock music, a peak of current peaks, a sharing of something that&#x27;s in [...] others at this time, but at the same time defining those black notions and leaving them unmatched.&quot; Writing for &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, Alastair Macaulay described the album as an &quot;exercise in dark controlled passion&quot; and wrote that its music &quot;stands up on its own as the band&#x27;s epitaph&quot;. Writing for &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Paolo Hewitt described the album as &quot;probably some of the most irresistible dance music we&#x27;ll hear this year [and] a far cry for sure from the almost suffocating claustrophobic world of the debut album,&quot; adding that &quot;the best (and most subversive?) rock music has always dealt head-on with emotions and thought rather than clichéd, standardised stances; that&#x27;s what makes &quot;Closer&quot; and Joy Division so important.&quot;

At the end of 1980, &quot;Closer&quot; was voted the 22nd best record of the year in the Pazz &amp; Jop, an annual poll of American critics published by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. Robert Christgau, the poll&#x27;s supervisor, deemed the album an improvement over &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; in a retrospective review: &quot;Curtis&#x27;s torment is less oppressive here because it&#x27;s less dominant—the dark, roiling, off-center rhythms have a life of their own. And if last time the dancier material had hooks, this time even the dirges have something closely resembling tunes.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Mikal Gilmore, in a 1981 profile of the band&#x27;s work, wrote: &quot;The music turns leaden, gray and steady because it means to fulfill a vision of a world where suffering is unremitting and nothingness is quiescent.&quot;

A book titled &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, published in 2005, &quot;Closer&quot; is defined as a &quot;quantum leap&quot; in terms of progression when compared to the band&#x27;s debut album. According to Colin Larkin, &quot;Closer&quot; has since been &quot;deservedly regarded by many critics as the most brilliant rock album of the 80s&quot;; Larkin himself found the record flawless, writing in his &quot;Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; (2011) that it showed Joy Division at their creative peak and &quot;maturity in every area&quot; of their music. In his review of the 2007 reissue of the album, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; critic Joshua Klein described the album as &quot;even more austere, more claustrophobic, more inventive, more beautiful and more haunting than its predecessor&quot;, calling it &quot;Joy Division&#x27;s start-to-finish masterpiece; a flawless encapsulation of everything the group sought to achieve.&quot;

== Legacy ==
&quot;Closer&quot; has been highly acclaimed, and is often cited as Joy Division&#x27;s finest work, being considered by music critics such as Mark Fisher to be &quot;the crown jewel of post-punk&quot; and receiving praise from artists such as George Michael. The album was voted number 1 in the 1980 &quot;Albums of the Year&quot; poll conducted by music magazine &quot;NME&quot;, and would be listed as number 157 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 2003 list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, maintaining the rank in the 2012 revision, and dropping to number 309 in the 2020 edition.

By 1982 &quot;Closer&quot; had sold over 250,000 copies worldwide, with the posthumous single &quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart&quot; having also sold over 160,000 copies. In 1995 &quot;Closer&quot; was ranked one of the top 100 alternative albums ever to be released by &quot;Spin&quot; magazine (placing at number 69). In 2002, the American online magazine &quot;Pitchfork&quot; listed &quot;Closer&quot; as the 10th best album to be released in the 1980s.

The album placed at number 72 on &quot;NME&quot; list of the 100 greatest British albums ever to be released. In addition, &quot;Q&quot; magazine placed &quot;Closer&quot; at number 8 in a list compiled of the 40 greatest albums to be released in the 1980s. In 2012, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; listed the album at number 7 upon their compiled list of the best albums of the 1980s. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included &quot;Closer&quot; in their &quot;80 Greatest albums of 1980&quot; list.

<doc id="159455" wikidata="Q1354463" url="?curid=159455" title="The The">
<text> are an English rock band from London, formed in 1979 by singer-songwriter Matt Johnson. Johnson is the only constant, and often sole, band member.

 achieved critical acclaim and commercial success in the UK, with 15 chart singles, seven reaching the top 40. Their most successful studio album, &quot;Infected&quot; (1986), spent 30 weeks on the chart. They followed this with the top-ten studio albums &quot;Mind Bomb&quot; (1989) and &quot;Dusk&quot; (1993).

The The operated as a solo project from 1982 to 1987, though their albums featured contributions from musicians such as Jools Holland, JG Thirlwell and Neneh Cherry. It became a full band from 1988 to 2002, notably featuring former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr until 1994. The The went on hiatus from 2002 to 2017, and released their first studio album in 24 years, &quot;Ensoulment&quot;, in 2024.

== History ==
=== Early years (1977–1981) ===

While trying to get his band going, in 1978 Matt Johnson had recorded a solo demo album (&quot;See Without Being Seen&quot;) which he sold at various underground gigs on cassettes. In 1979, working with Colin Lloyd-Tucker (a friend and colleague at De Wolfe Music, the Soho music publisher/recording studio) Johnson recorded his first album proper, &quot;Spirits&quot;. This album remains unreleased, although the track &quot;What Stanley Saw&quot; was later licensed to Cherry Red Records for their &quot;Perspectives and Distortion&quot; compilation album, which also featured Virgin Prunes, Lemon Kittens, Thomas Leer, Kevin Coyne and Mark Perry.

In November 1977, Johnson had placed an advertisement in &quot;NME&quot; seeking &quot;bass/lead guitarist&quot; who liked the Velvet Underground and Syd Barrett. In 1979 he placed a second advertisement in the &quot;NME&quot;, stating his new influences as the Residents and Throbbing Gristle.

 made their debut at London&#x27;s Africa Centre on 11 May 1979, third on the bill to Scritti Politti and PragVEC, using backing tape tracks that Johnson created at his day job at De Wolfe studios for the drums and bass. The band at this point consisted of Johnson on vocal, electric piano, guitar and tapes and Keith Laws on synthesiser and tapes. Laws suggested the name &quot; to Matt Johnson.

As was now getting underway, Johnson was simultaneously working with experimental synth-pop combo the Gadgets, a studio group he formed with Colin Lloyd Tucker, his colleague at De Wolfe recording studios.

Peter Ashworth, then known as &#x27;Triash&#x27; and later to become a noted photographer, became drummer in 1980, and Tom Johnston (also managing at this point and later to become a cartoonist for the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and &quot;The Sun&quot; newspapers) was added on bass. Although both Ashworth and Johnston were credited with appearing on debut single (&quot;Controversial Subject&quot;/&quot;Black and White&quot;) on 4AD Records, neither actually played on the recordings, which were produced by Wire members Bruce Gilbert and Graham Lewis. All instruments were played by Johnson and Laws. Johnston and Ashworth soon dropped out of and returned to their respective day jobs. As a duo (Johnson and Laws), began performing concerts with Wire, Cabaret Voltaire, DAF, This Heat, the Birthday Party and Scritti Politti.

In early 1981 also contributed the composition &quot;Untitled&quot; to the &quot;Some Bizzare Album&quot;. In September of that year Johnson and Laws signed a recording contract with Some Bizzare Records and released the 7&quot; single &quot;Cold Spell Ahead&quot;. By this stage Matt Johnson had begun playing all the instruments himself so Laws left to pursue his studies, leaving Johnson as a solo artist using a group moniker.

Johnson was signed up later in 1981 to 4AD Records by Ivo Watts-Russell to record a solo studio album, &quot;Burning Blue Soul&quot;. Although all of the instruments and vocals were performed by Johnson, the album featured various producers including Wire&#x27;s Bruce Gilbert and Graham Lewis, Ivo and Johnson himself. Years later, owing to a request from Johnson, it would be re-issued and credited to so all of his albums would be in the same rack together.

Towards the end of 1981, Colin Lloyd-Tucker and Simon Fisher Turner joined the band for a series of stripped down acoustic concerts in London.

=== Matt Johnson solo years (1982–1987) ===
Johnson spent the next few years collaborating with a diverse range of creative individuals, changing personnel from project to project.

 next single was a retooling of &quot;Cold Spell Ahead&quot;, now entitled &quot;Uncertain Smile&quot;. Produced in New York by Mike Thorne, it reached No. 68 UK. This version is different from the more familiar album version, and featured saxophone and flute by session musician Crispin Cioe rather than (as on the album version) the piano of Squeeze&#x27;s Jools Holland.

In 1982, the intended debut album by (&quot;The Pornography of Despair&quot;) was recorded, but was never officially mixed nor released. Johnson apparently ran off some cassette copies for friends, and several tracks (&quot;Mental Healing Process&quot;, &quot;Leap into the Wind&quot;, &quot;Absolute Liberation&quot;) were subsequently issued as additional tracks on the &quot;This Is the Day&quot; single. &quot;Three Orange Kisses from Kazan&quot; and &quot;Waitin&#x27; for the Upturn&quot; (featuring Steve James Sherlock playing flute and saxophone) also date from this era, and appeared as B-sides. Some of the previously mentioned cuts, along with the tracks &quot;The Nature of Virtue&quot; and &quot;Fruit of the Heart&quot; (which were similarly recorded around the same time), appeared as bonus selections on a cassette-only issue of the band&#x27;s eventual debut album, but &quot;The Pornography of Despair&quot; album as a whole remains unissued.

Around 1982 played a series of four concerts at the Marquee Club in Wardour Street, Soho, entitled &#x27;An evening of Rock n Roll with &#x27;. These concerts were weekly for four weeks and featured Marc Almond on guitar and vocals.

 released their official studio album debut, the synth-noir classic &quot;Soul Mining&quot;, in 1983. It featured the minor UK No. 71 hit &quot;This Is the Day&quot;, as well as a new recording of performing &quot;Uncertain Smile&quot;. Produced by Johnson and Paul Hardiman, it featured guest appearances from Orange Juice&#x27;s drummer Zeke Manyika, Jools Holland, Thomas Leer and JG Thirlwell (a.k.a. Foetus).

During more prolific period of releases, from &quot;Soul Mining&quot; (1983) to &quot;Dusk&quot; (1992), most artwork used on the albums and single releases was produced by Johnson&#x27;s brother Andrew Johnson, using the pseudonym Andy Dog. The artwork has a distinctive style, and sometimes courted controversy, most notably the initial release of the 1986 single &quot;Infected&quot;, which featured a masturbating devil and was withdrawn from sale and re-issued with an edited version of the same drawing.

In 1985, the none-album track &quot;Flesh and Bones&quot; was released on the compilation album &quot;If You Can&#x27;t Please Yourself You Can&#x27;t, Please Your Soul&quot; by EMI.

For their second studio album &quot;Infected&quot; (1986), still consisted only of Johnson, but was augmented by session musicians and featured friends such as Manyika and Rip Rig + Panic singer Neneh Cherry and Anna Domino. This album spawned four charting singles in the UK, notably &quot;Heartland&quot;, which made the UK top 30. It was also unusual for having a full-length accompanying film. Costing hundreds of thousands of pounds, &quot;Infected: The Movie&quot; was shot on locations in Bolivia, Peru and New York. Different songs were directed by different directors, mainly Tim Pope and Peter &#x27;Sleazy&#x27; Christopherson (of Throbbing Gristle).

Throughout 1986–1987 Johnson toured the world extensively with &quot;Infected: The Movie&quot;, showing the film in cinemas in place of performing live concerts. The film was also shown twice in its entirety on Channel 4 in the UK, on MTV&#x27;s &quot;120 Minutes&quot; in the US, and on MuchMusic&#x27;s &quot;City Limits&quot; in Canada.

In 1987, Johnson also took some tentative steps back into live performance. Whilst promoting &quot;Infected: The Movie&quot; in Australia he had a chance encounter with Billy Bragg, who persuaded him to return to Britain and support Red Wedge, a coalition of like-minded musicians supporting the Labour Party in its general election campaign. Johnson agreed and enrolled longtime friend and collaborator Manyika to join him in performing shows in London featuring stripped-down versions of political songs such as &quot;Heartland&quot;. This experience convinced Johnson to put a band together once again.

=== Return to a full band (1988–2002) ===
By 1988, was an actual band again, Johnson having recruited ex-Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr, ex-Nick Lowe bassist James Eller and ex-ABC drummer David Palmer as fully-fledged members. This line-up, plus guest singer Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, recorded their third studio album &quot;Mind Bomb&quot;, which debuted at No. 4 in the UK Albums Chart and featured the band&#x27;s highest-charting single to that time, &quot;The Beat(en) Generation&quot;, which peaked at No. 18 in the UK singles chart. 

Keyboardist D.C. Collard was added to the official line-up in 1989 after the band&#x27;s former session player Steve Hogarth, who had played on &quot;Infected&quot;, opted to become the new lead vocalist of Marillion instead. The band embarked on a lengthy world tour in 1989–90 called &quot; Versus the World&quot;. The live film of the same name, directed by Tim Pope, was filmed during the three nights performed at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall at the end of the tour. Vocalist Melanie Redmond, who had just completed a world tour with Duran Duran, joined the tour during the European leg as a session musician.

The studio EP &quot;Shades of Blue&quot; was released in 1990. This included cover versions of Fred Neil&#x27;s &quot;Dolphins&quot; and Duke Ellington&#x27;s &quot;Solitude&quot; as well as a new original song &quot;Jealous of Youth&quot; and a live version of &quot;Another Boy Drowning&quot; from &quot;Burning Blue Soul&quot;. This and a later EP of remixes, 1993&#x27;s &quot;Dis-infected&quot;, were compiled into a 1994 full-length album for the North American market called &quot;Solitude&quot;.

In 1993, with Johnson, Marr, Collard, Eller and Palmer, Some Bizzare Records/Epic issued their fourth studio album &quot;Dusk&quot;, which debuted at No. 2 in the UK and spun off three top 40 singles in the UK, led by &quot;Dogs of Lust&quot;. Another world tour followed, the &quot;Lonely Planet&quot; tour, at which point the band&#x27;s line-up was reshuffled; Marr and Eller left, and were replaced by Atlanta-based guitarist Keith Joyner and New York bassist Jared Michael Nickerson after Johnson relocated the band to the US. Also added was Boston harmonica player Jim Fitting (formerly of Treat Her Right), who auditioned in New York in early 1993. Palmer bowed out partway through the tour and was replaced by ex-Stabbing Westward drummer Andy Kubiszewski. The band headlined the main stage at the 1993 Reading Festival.

Another full-length film, directed by longtime collaborator Tim Pope, was made for this album. &quot;From Dusk Til Dawn&quot; was shot in New Orleans and New York. Along with Johnson and Johnny Marr, it also features various characters from the New York underground scene such as sexologist Annie Sprinkle, writer and raconteur Quentin Crisp, Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa, and pornographic film actor Rick Savage amongst many carnival characters.

Now permanently relocated to New York, next project was 1995&#x27;s &quot;Hanky Panky&quot;, an album that consisted entirely of Hank Williams cover versions. &quot;Hanky Panky&quot; was recorded by a new group consisting of Johnson, Collard, Fitting, ex-Iggy Pop guitarist Eric Schermerhorn, former bassist for David Bowie Gail Ann Dorsey (billed as &quot;Hollywood&quot; Dorsey), and drummer the &quot;Reverend&quot; Brian MacLeod. Their cover version of &quot;I Saw the Light&quot; hit No. 31 UK, released by Some Bizzare Label / Epic.

An experimental album &quot;Gun Sluts&quot; was recorded in 1997, but it was left unreleased by the band after it was rejected for being too uncommercial by their label. severed their 18-year relationship with Sony and moved to Interscope, on Trent Reznor&#x27;s Nothing Records imprint.

In 2000, , at this time consisting of Johnson, Schermerhorn, Nashville bassist Spencer Campbell and New Jersey drummer Earl Harvin, released &quot;NakedSelf&quot; and embarked on another lengthy world tour, the &quot;Naked Tour&quot;, which lasted 14 months.

This same line-up also recorded two new tracks, &quot;Deep Down Truth&quot;, featuring Angela McCluskey on vocals and &quot;Pillar Box Red&quot;. Both songs were produced by Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley for the 2002 compilation album &quot;45 RPM: The Singles of the The&quot;.

In June 2002, made a sole live appearance at Meltdown festival at London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall as guests of David Bowie. At this point, the band consisted solely of Johnson, longtime friend and collaborator JG Thirlwell on tapes and loops, and young film director Benn Northover on film and video.

=== Hiatus (2003–2017) ===

Since 2003, the reclusive Johnson has generally kept away from the public eye and has concentrated primarily on soundtrack work, scoring numerous documentaries, films, and art installations. music has featured in a diverse range of cinema over many years, from cult classics such as Jürgen Muschalek&#x27;s (Muscha) &quot;Decoder&quot; (&quot;Three Orange Kisses from Kazan&quot;) and Gregg Araki&#x27;s &quot;Nowhere&quot; (&quot;Love Is Stronger Than Death&quot;) to big-budget epics such as Sylvester Stallone&#x27;s &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; (&quot;Darkness Falls&quot;), prompting Johnson&#x27;s move into film score composition.

For English director Nichola Bruce, it has included the documentary &quot;One Man Show: Dramatic Art of Steven Berkoff&quot; (1995) and a documentary feature film about the Apollo Moon landings, &quot;Moonbug&quot;, which was completed in autumn 2010 and won the Special Jury Remi Award for Theatrical Feature Documentary at the 2011 WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival.

The latest collaboration between Johnson and St Michaels, &quot;Penthouse North,&quot; premiered at the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival in May 2014.

In June 2009, it was announced that had created an original soundtrack to the Gerard Johnson debut feature film &quot;Tony&quot;, released February 2010 on Cineola imprint in March 2010, as the first volume of several forthcoming soundtrack and instrumental albums.

A press release was issued along with this track, announcing a forthcoming album called &quot;The End of the Day&quot; with various songs from catalogue being performed by some of Johnson&#x27;s favourite artists including Elysian Fields, JG Thirlwell, Thomas Leer, Elbow, Rob Ellis, John Parish, Anna Domino, Meja, Angela McCluskey, Ergo Phizmiz, and Rustin Man (a.k.a.

Matt Johnson has created several new arms of :
* Cinéola; a label specifically created for soundtrack and spoken word releases published on CDs within small, hardback books, complete with photographs and text.
* Radio Cinéola; a 15-minute &quot;shortwave radio&quot; broadcast downloadable from the official web site and featuring previews of upcoming releases, works in progress, chats with collaborators, and, previously unheard material from the vault.

It features many of the famous customers of this pub, such as Jack Charlton, the Kray twins, Van Morrison, Bobby Moore, Clyde McPhatter, the Who, Daniel Farson and Terry Spinks.

He was a founder member of the Save Shoreditch committee and directed and narrated a short film for its cause. Along with fellow artists such as Brad Lochore, Tracey Emin and Lucinda Rogers he has been fighting the eastwards expansion of the City of London into Shoreditch and the probable demolition of much of this East London neighbourhood. The day after the London Olympics finished in August 2012 Johnson made a rare public appearance on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; current affairs programme, in order to debate with Robin Wales, the Mayor of Newham, about the impact and legacy of the Olympic Games upon Stratford, the part of London Johnson grew up in.

It is also the highest volcano in the Eastern Hemisphere and the fourth most topographically prominent peak on Earth.

Kilimanjaro&#x27;s southern and eastern slopes served as the home of the Chagga Kingdoms until their abolition in 1963 by Julius Nyerere. The origin and meaning of the name Kilimanjaro is unknown, but may mean &quot;mountain of greatness&quot; or &quot;unclimbable&quot;. Although described in classical sources, German missionary Johannes Rebmann is credited as the first European to report the mountain&#x27;s existence, in 1848. After several European attempts, Hans Meyer reached Kilimanjaro&#x27;s highest summit in 1889.

The mountain was incorporated into Kilimanjaro National Park in 1973. As one of the Seven Summits, Kilimanjaro is a major hiking and climbing destination. There are seven established routes to Uhuru Peak, the mountain&#x27;s highest point. Although not as technically challenging as similar mountains, the prominence of Kilimanjaro poses a serious risk of altitude sickness.

One of several mountains arising from the East African Rift, Kilimanjaro was formed from volcanic activity over 2 million years ago. Its slopes host montane forests and cloud forests. Multiple species are endemic to Mount Kilimanjaro, including the giant groundsel &quot;Dendrosenecio kilimanjari&quot;. The mountain possesses a large ice cap and the largest glaciers in Africa, including Credner Glacier, Furtwängler Glacier, and the Rebmann Glacier. This ice cap is rapidly shrinking, with over 80% lost in the 20th century. The cap is projected to disappear entirely by the mid-21st century.

==Toponymy==
The origin and meaning of the name Kilimanjaro is disputed. Although the Chagga people of the Kilimanjaro Region have no name for the mountain, they call its two peaks &quot;Kipoo&quot; and &quot;Kimawenze&quot;. The peaks&#x27; names—usually rendered Kibo and Mawenzi—mean &quot;spotted&quot; in reference to Kibo&#x27;s snow and &quot;broken top&quot; due to Mawenzi&#x27;s jagged peak. &quot;Kilimanjaro&quot; may originate from the Chagga calling the mountain unclimbable—&quot;kilemanjaare&quot; or &quot;kilemajyaro&quot;—and explorers misinterpreting this as its name. This Kichagga language etymology relies on &quot;kileme&quot;, &quot;that which defeats&quot;, or &quot;kilelema&quot;, &quot;that which has become difficult or impossible&quot;. The &quot;-jaro&quot; could be derived from &quot;njaare&quot;, a bird, or &quot;jyaro&quot;, a caravan.

Early Western etymologies used a compound Swahili origin, with &quot;kilima&quot; translated as &quot;mountain&quot;. In 1860, Johann Ludwig Krapf wrote that the Swahilis used the name Kilimanjaro and that it meant either &quot;mountain of greatness&quot; or &quot;mountain of caravans&quot;, with a translation of &quot;njaro&quot; as greatness or &quot;jaro&quot; as &quot;caravans&quot;. In 1885, Scottish explorer Joseph Thomson reported &quot;white mountain&quot; as an alternative, with &quot;njaro&quot; denoting whiteness. This Swahili etymological approach is criticized as &quot;kilima&quot; is a diminutive of &quot;mlima&quot; (mountain) and actually means &quot;hill&quot;. However, &quot;mlima&quot; may have been misreported as &quot;kilima&quot; via conflation with the two peaks&#x27; names, &quot;Kipoo&quot; and &quot;Kimawenze&quot;.

Krapf mentions an 1849 visit with a Wakamba chief that called the mountain &quot;Kima jajeu&quot;, meaning &quot;mountain of whiteness&quot;. Another explanation is that &quot;jyaro&quot; may refer to a god or a deity that guarded the mountain from trespassers.

In the 1880s, the mountain became part of German East Africa and was called &quot;Kilima-Ndscharo&quot; in German. In 1889, Hans Meyer reached the highest summit on Kibo, which he named &quot;Kaiser-Wilhelm-Spitze&quot; for Kaiser Wilhelm. Following the Zanzibar Revolution and the formation of Tanzania in 1964, the summit was renamed Uhuru Peak: &quot;Freedom Peak&quot; in Swahili.

== Geology and geography ==
Kilimanjaro is a large dormant stratovolcano composed of three distinct volcanic cones: Kibo, the highest; Mawenzi at ; and Shira, the lowest at . Mawenzi and Shira are extinct, while Kibo is dormant and could erupt again.

Uhuru Peak is the highest summit on Kibo&#x27;s crater rim. The Tanzania National Parks Authority, a Tanzanian government agency, and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization lists the height of Uhuru Peak as , based on a British survey in 1952. The height has since been measured as in 1999, in 2008, and in 2014.

A map of the Kibo cone on Mount Kilimanjaro was published by the British government&#x27;s Directorate of Overseas Surveys (DOS) in 1964 based on aerial photography conducted in 1962 as the &quot;Subset of Kilimanjaro, East Africa (Tanganyika) Series Y742, Sheet 56/2, D.O.S. 422 1964, Edition 1, Scale 1:50,000&quot;. Tourist mapping was first published by the Ordnance Survey in England in 1989 based on the original DOS mapping at a scale of 1:100,000, with contour intervals, as DOS 522. West Col Productions produced a map with tourist information in 1990, at a scale of 1:75,000, with contour intervals; it included inset maps of Kibo and Mawenzi on 1:20,000 and 1:30,000 scales respectively and with contour intervals. In recent years, numerous other maps have become available, of various qualities.

=== Volcanology ===

The volcanic interior of Kilimanjaro is poorly known because there has not been any significant erosion to expose the igneous strata that comprise the volcano&#x27;s structure.

Eruptive activity at the Shira center commenced about 2.5 million years ago, with the last important phase occurring about 1.9 million years ago, just before the northern part of the edifice collapsed. Shira is topped by a broad high plain at , which may be a filled caldera. The remnant caldera rim has been degraded deeply by erosion. Before the caldera formed and erosion began, Shira might have been between high. It is mostly composed of basaltic lavas, with some pyroclastics. The formation of the caldera was accompanied by lava emanating from ring fractures, but there was no large-scale explosive activity. Two cones formed subsequently, the phonolitic one at the northwest end of the ridge and the doleritic Platzkegel in the caldera center.

Both Mawenzi and Kibo began erupting about 1 million years ago. They are separated by the Saddle Plateau at elevation.

The youngest dated rocks at Mawenzi are about 448,000 years old. Mawenzi forms a horseshoe-shaped ridge with pinnacles and ridges opening to the northeast, with a tower-like shape resulting from deep erosion and a mafic dike swarm. Several large cirques cut into the ring and the largest of these sits on top of the Great Barranco gorge. Also notable are the East and West Barrancos on the northeastern side of the mountain. Most of the eastern side of the mountain has been removed by erosion. Mawenzi has a subsidiary peak, Neumann Tower, .

Kibo is the largest cone on the mountain and is more than wide at the Saddle Plateau altitude. The last activity here, dated to 150,000–200,000 years ago, created the current Kibo summit crater. Kibo still has gas-emitting fumaroles in its crater. Kibo is capped by an almost symmetrical cone with escarpments rising on the south side. These escarpments define a caldera caused by the collapse of the summit.

Within this caldera is the Inner Cone and within the crater of the Inner Cone is the Reusch Crater, which the Tanganyika government in 1954 named after Gustav Otto Richard Reusch, upon his climbing the mountain for the 25th time (out of 65 attempts during his lifetime). The Ash Pit, deep, lies within the Reusch Crater. About 100,000 years ago, part of Kibo&#x27;s crater rim collapsed, creating the area known as the Western Breach and the Great Barranco.

An almost continuous layer of lava buries most older geological features, except exposed strata within the Great West Notch and the Kibo Barranco. The former exposes intrusions of syenite. Kibo has five main lava formations:

* Phonotephrites and tephriphonolites of the Lava Tower group, on a dyke cropping out at , dated to 482,000 years ago.
* Tephriphonolite to phonolite lavas &quot;characterized by rhomb mega-phenocrysts of sodic feldspars&quot; of the Rhomb Porphyry group, dated to 460,000–360,000 years ago.
* Aphyric phonolite lavas, &quot;commonly underlain by basal obsidian horizons&quot;, of the Lent group, dated to 359,000–337,000 years ago
* Porphyritic tephriphonolite to phonolite lavas of the Caldera Rim group, dated to 274,000–170,000 years ago
* Phonolite lava flows with aegirine phenocrysts, of the Inner Crater group, which represents the last volcanic activity on Kibo

Kibo has more than 250 parasitic cones on its northwest and southeast flanks that were formed between 150,000 and 200,000 years ago and erupted picrobasalts, trachybasalts, ankaramites, and basanites. They reach as far as Lake Chala and Taveta in the southeast and the Lengurumani Plain in the northwest. Most of these cones are well preserved, except the Saddle Plateau cones which were heavily affected by glacial action. Despite their mostly small size, lava from the cones has obscured large portions of the mountain. The Saddle Plateau cones are mostly cinder cones with terminal effusion of lava, while the Upper Rombo Zone cones mostly generated lava flows. All Saddle Plateau cones predate the last glaciation.

According to reports gathered in the 19th century from the Maasai, Lake Chala on Kibo&#x27;s eastern flank was the site of a village that was destroyed by an eruption.

=== Glaciers ===
Kibo&#x27;s diminishing ice cap exists because Kilimanjaro is a little-dissected, massive mountain that rises above the snow line. The cap is divergent and at the edges splits into individual glaciers. The central portion of the ice cap is interrupted by the presence of the Kibo crater. The summit glaciers and ice fields do not display significant horizontal movements because their low thickness precludes major deformation.

Geological evidence shows five successive glacial episodes during the Quaternary period, namely First (500,000 BP), Second (greater than 360,000 years ago to 240,000 BP), Third (150,000 to 120,000 BP), Fourth (also known as &quot;Main&quot;) (20,000 to 17,000 BP), and Little (16,000 to 14,000 BP). The Third may have been the most extensive, and the Little appears to be statistically indistinguishable from the Fourth.

A continuous ice cap covering approximately down to an elevation of covered Kilimanjaro during the Last Glacial Maximum in the Pleistocene epoch (the Main glacial episode), extending across the summits of Kibo and Mawenzi. Because of the exceptionally prolonged dry conditions during the subsequent Younger Dryas stadial, the ice fields on Kilimanjaro may have become extinct around 11,500 years BP. Ice cores taken from Kilimanjaro&#x27;s Northern Ice Field (NIF) indicates that the glaciers there have a basal age of about 11,700 years, although an analysis of ice taken in 2011 from exposed vertical cliffs in the NIF supports an age extending only to 800 years BP. Higher precipitation rates at the beginning of the Holocene epoch (11,500 years BP) allowed the ice cap to reform. The glaciers survived a widespread drought during a three century period beginning around 4,000 years BP.

In the late 1880s, the summit of Kibo was completely covered by an ice cap about in extent with outlet glaciers cascading down the western and southern slopes, and except for the inner cone, the entire caldera was buried. Glacier ice also flowed through the Western Breach. The slope glaciers retreated rapidly between 1912 and 1953, in response to a sudden shift in climate at the end of the 19th century that made them &quot;drastically out of equilibrium&quot;, and more slowly thereafter. Their continuing demise indicates they are still out of equilibrium in response to a constant change in climate over the past century.

In contrast to the persistent slope glaciers, the glaciers on Kilimanjaro&#x27;s crater plateau have appeared and disappeared repeatedly during the Holocene epoch, with each cycle lasting a few hundred years. It appears that decreasing specific humidity instead of temperature changes has caused the shrinkage of the slope glaciers since the late 19th century. No clear warming trend at the elevation of those glaciers occurred between 1948 and 2005. Although air temperatures at that elevation are always below freezing, solar radiation causes melting on vertical faces. Vertical ice margin walls are a unique characteristic of the summit glaciers and a major place of the shrinkage of the glaciers. They manifest stratifications, calving, and other ice features. &quot;There is no pathway for the plateau glaciers other than to continuously retreat once their vertical margins are exposed to solar radiation.&quot; The Kilimanjaro glaciers have been used for deriving ice core records, including two from the southern icefield. Based on this data, this icefield formed between 1,250 and 1,450 years BP.

Almost 85 percent of the ice cover on Kilimanjaro disappeared between October 1912 and June 2011, with coverage decreasing from to &lt; Between 1912 and 1953, there was about a 1.1 percent average annual loss of ice coverage. The average annual loss for 1953 to 1989 was 1.4 percent, while the loss rate for 1989 to 2007 was 2.5 percent. Of the ice cover still present in 2000, almost 40 percent had disappeared by 2011. Ice climber Will Gadd noticed differences between his 2014 and 2020 climbs. The glaciers are thinning in addition to losing areal coverage, and do not have active accumulation zones; retreat occurs on all glacier surfaces. Loss of glacier mass is caused by both melting and sublimation. While the current shrinking and thinning of Kilimanjaro&#x27;s ice fields appear to be unique within its almost twelve-millennium history, it is contemporaneous with widespread glacier retreat in mid-to-low latitudes across the globe. In 2013, it was estimated that, at the current rate of global warming, most of the ice on Kilimanjaro will disappear by 2040, and &quot;it is highly unlikely that any ice body will remain after 2060&quot;.

The Furtwangler Glacier on Kilimanjaro is a remnant of the ice cap that once covered the mountain. This has retreated dramatically over the last century with over 80 percent glacial retreat. The glacier is named after Walter Furtwangler, who along with Ziegfried Koenig, was the fourth to ascend to the summit of Kilimanjaro in 1912.

A complete disappearance of the ice would be of only &quot;negligible importance&quot; to the water budget of the area around the mountain. The forests of Kilimanjaro, far below the ice fields, &quot;are [the] essential water reservoirs for the local and regional populations&quot;.

=== Drainage ===
Kilimanjaro is drained by a network of rivers and streams, especially on the wetter and more heavily eroded southern side and primarily above . Below that altitude, increased evaporation and human water usage reduce the water flows. The Lumi and Pangani rivers drain Kilimanjaro on the eastern and southern sides, respectively.

===IUGS geological heritage site===
In respect of it being &#x27;the highest stratovolcano of the East African Rift that maintains a glacier on its summit&#x27;, the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) included &#x27;The Pleistocene Kilimanjaro volcano&#x27; in its assemblage of 100 &#x27;geological heritage sites&#x27; around the world in a listing published in October 2022. The organization defines an IUGS Geological Heritage Site as &#x27;a key place with geological elements and/or processes of international scientific relevance, used as a reference, and/or with a substantial contribution to the development of geological sciences through history.&#x27;

== Human history ==

===Chagga states===
Kilimanjaro is attested to in numerous stories by the people who live in East Africa. The Chagga, who traditionally lived on the southern and eastern slopes of the mountain in sovereign Chagga states, tell how a man named Tone once provoked a god, Ruwa, to bring famine upon the land. The people became angry at Tone, forcing him to flee. Nobody wanted to protect him but a solitary dweller who had stones that turned miraculously into cattle. The dweller bid that Tone never open the stable of the cattle. When Tone did not heed the warning and the cattle escaped, Tone followed them, but the fleeing cattle threw up hills to run on, including Mawenzi and Kibo. Tone finally collapsed on Kibo, ending the pursuit.

Another Chagga legend tells of ivory-filled graves of elephants on the mountain, and of a cow named Rayli that produces miraculous fat from her tail glands. If a man tries to steal such a gland but is too slow in his moves, Rayli will blast a powerful snort and blow the thief down onto the plain.

===Early records===
The mountain may have been known to non-Africans since antiquity. Sailors&#x27; reports recorded by Ptolemy mention a &quot;moon mountain&quot; and a spring lake of the Nile, which may indicate Kilimanjaro, although available historical information does not allow differentiation among others in East Africa like Mount Kenya, the mountains of Ethiopia, the Virunga Mountains, the Rwenzori Mountains, and Kilimanjaro. Before Ptolemy, Aeschylus and Herodotus referred to &quot;Egypt nurtured by the snows&quot; and to a spring between two mountains, respectively. One of these mentions two tall mountains in the coastal regions with a valley with traces of fire between them. Martín Fernández de Enciso, a Spanish traveler to Mombasa who obtained information about the interior from native caravans, said in his &quot;Summa de Geografía&quot; (1519) that west of Mombasa &quot;stands the Ethiopian Mount Olympus, which is exceedingly high, and beyond it are the Mountains of the Moon, in which are the sources of the Nile&quot;.

=== European exploration ===
The German missionaries Johannes Rebmann of Mombasa and Johann Krapf were the first Europeans known to have attempted to reach the mountain. According to English geographer Halford Mackinder and English explorer Harry Johnston, Rebmann in 1848 was the first European to report the existence of Kilimanjaro. Hans Meyer has claimed that Rebmann first arrived in Africa in 1846 and quotes Rebmann&#x27;s diary entry of 11 May 1848 as saying, 

In August 1861, the Prussian officer Baron Karl Klaus von der Decken accompanied by English geologist Richard Thornton attempted to climb Kibo but &quot;got no farther than owing to the inclemency of the weather&quot;. In December 1862, von der Decken tried a second time together with Otto Kersten, reaching a height of .

In August 1871, missionary Charles New became the &quot;first European to reach the equatorial snows&quot; on Kilimanjaro at an elevation of slightly more than . In June 1887, the Hungarian Count Sámuel Teleki and the Austrian Lieutenant Ludwig von Höhnel made an attempt to climb the mountain. Approaching from the saddle between Mawenzi and Kibo, Höhnel stopped at , but Teleki continued until he reached the snow at . Later in 1887, the German geology professor Hans Meyer reached the lower edge of the ice cap on Kibo, where he was forced to turn back because he lacked the equipment needed to progress across the ice. The following year, Meyer planned another attempt with Oscar Baumann, a cartographer, but the mission was aborted after the pair were held hostage and ransomed during the Abushiri Revolt. In the autumn of 1888, the American naturalist Abbott and the German explorer Otto Ehrenfried Ehlers approached the summit from the northwest. While Abbott turned back earlier, Ehlers at first claimed to have reached the summit rim, but after severe criticism of the claim, withdrew it.

In 1889, Meyer returned to Kilimanjaro with the Austrian mountaineer Ludwig Purtscheller for a third attempt. This attempt was based on the establishment of several campsites with food supplies so that multiple attempts at the top could be made without having to descend too far. Meyer and Purtscheller pushed to near the crater rim on 3 October but turned back exhausted from hacking footsteps in the icy slope. Three days later, they reached the highest summit, on the southern rim of the crater. They were the first to confirm that Kibo has a crater. After descending to the saddle between Kibo and Mawenzi, Meyer and Purtscheller attempted to climb the more technically challenging Mawenzi but could only reach the top of Klute Peak, a subsidiary peak, before retreating due to illness. On 18 October, they reascended Kibo to enter and study the crater, cresting the rim at Hans Meyers Notch. In total, Meyer and Purtscheller spent 16 days above during their expedition. They were accompanied in their high camps by Mwini Amani of Pangani, who cooked and supplied the sites with water and firewood.

==== First women climbers ====
In 1909, London-born Gertrude Benham attempted to reach the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro. After her porters abandoned the expedition upon discovering the skeletons of previous climbers, Benham continued alone and reached the edge of Kibo Crater, later named Gilman’s Point. Adverse weather conditions, including heavy snow and fog, made navigation difficult, leading her to turn back. The first woman to successfully reach the summit of Kilimanjaro was Sheila MacDonald, who completed the ascent on September 30, 1927, at the age of 22.

===Modern===

The first ascent of the highest summit of Mawenzi was made on 29 July 1912, by the German climbers Eduard Hans Oehler and Fritz Klute, who named it Hans Meyer Peak. Oehler and Klute went on to make the third-ever ascent of Kibo, via the Drygalski Glacier, and descended via the Western Breach. The mountain lent its name to the 1914 Battle of Kilimanjaro during World War I.

In 1989, the organizing committee of the 100-year celebration of the first ascent decided to award posthumous certificates to the African porter-guides who had accompanied Meyer and Purtscheller. One person in pictures or documents of the 1889 expedition was thought to match a living inhabitant of Marangu, Yohani Kinyala Lauwo. Lauwo did not know his own age, nor remember Meyer or Purtscheller. He did recall joining a Kilimanjaro expedition involving a Dutch doctor who lived near the mountain, and that he did not wear shoes during the climb. Lauwo claimed that he had climbed the mountain three times before the beginning of World War I. The committee concluded that he had been a member of Meyer&#x27;s team and therefore must have been born around 1871. Lauwo died on 10 May 1996, 107 years after the first ascent. It is sometimes suggested that he was a co-first-ascendant of Kilimanjaro.

==Fauna and flora==
===Animals===
Large animals are rare on Kilimanjaro and are more frequent in the forests and lower parts of the mountain. Elephants and Cape buffaloes are among the animals that can be potentially hazardous to trekkers. Bushbucks, chameleons, dik-diks, duikers, mongooses, sunbirds, and warthogs have also been reported. Zebras, leopards and hyenas have been observed sporadically on the Shira plateau. Specific species associated with the mountain include the Kilimanjaro shrew and the chameleon &quot;Kinyongia tavetana&quot;.

=== Vegetation===

Natural forests cover about on Kilimanjaro. In the foothill area, maize, beans, sunflowers and, on the western side, wheat are cultivated. There are remnants of the former savanna vegetation with &quot;Acacia&quot;, &quot;Combretum&quot;, &quot;Terminalia&quot; and &quot;Grewia&quot;. Between and , coffee appears as part of the &quot;Chagga home gardens&quot; agroforestry. Native vegetation at this altitude range (&quot;Strombosia&quot;, &quot;Newtonia&quot;, and &quot;Entandrophragma&quot;) is limited to inaccessible valleys and gorges and is different from vegetation at higher altitudes. On the southern slope, montane forests first contain &quot;Ocotea usambarensis&quot; as well as ferns and epiphytes; farther up in cloud forests &quot;Podocarpus latifolius&quot;, &quot;Hagenia abyssinica&quot; and &quot;Erica excelsa&quot; grow, as well as fog-dependent mosses. On the drier northern slopes olive, &quot;Croton&quot;-&quot;Calodendrum&quot;, &quot;Cassipourea&quot;, and &quot;Juniperus&quot; form forests in order of increasing altitude. Between and lie &quot;Erica&quot; bush and heathlands, followed by &quot;Helichrysum&quot;, until . Neophytes have been observed, including &quot;Poa annua&quot;.

The lower northern and western slopes are dominated by &quot;Acacia&quot; savanna, while most of the wooded grassland of the lower southern and eastern slopes have been destroyed for cultivation.

Records from the Maundi crater at indicate that the vegetation of Kilimanjaro has varied over time. Forest vegetation retreated during the Last Glacial Maximum and the ericaceous vegetation belt lowered by between 42,000 and 30,000 years ago because of the drier and colder conditions.

The Tussock Grassland is an area on the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro that contains many unique species of vegetation, such as the water holding cabbage.

== Conservation ==
Since 1973, Mount Kilimanjaro has been designated as a national park, prohibiting human activities within its boundaries to preserve its ecosystem. The government has also implemented a ban on tree harvesting to prevent environmental degradation and protect the park&#x27;s biodiversity.

== Climate ==

The climate of Kilimanjaro is influenced by the height of the mountain, which allows the simultaneous influence of the equatorial trade winds and the high altitude anti-trades, and by the isolated position of the mountain. Kilimanjaro has daily upslope and nightly downslope winds, a regimen stronger on the southern than the northern side of the mountain. The flatter southern flanks are more extended and affect the atmosphere more strongly.

Kilimanjaro has two distinct rainy seasons, one from March to May and another around November. The northern slopes receive much less rainfall than the southern ones. The lower southern slope receives annually, rising to at altitude and peaking &quot;partly over&quot; in the forest belt at . In the alpine zone, annual precipitation decreases to .

The average temperature in the summit area is approximately . Nighttime surface temperatures on the Northern Ice Field (NIF) fall on average to , with an average daytime high of . During nights of extreme radiational cooling, the NIF can cool to as low as .

Snowfall can occur at any time of year but is mostly associated with northern Tanzania&#x27;s two rainy seasons. Precipitation in the summit area occurs principally as snow and graupel of per year and ablates within days or years.

== Tourism industry==

Kilimanjaro National Park generated US$51 million in revenue in 2013, the second-most of any Tanzanian national park. The Tanzania National Parks Authority reported that the park recorded 57,456 tourists during the 2011–12 budget year, of whom 16,425 hiked the mountain; the park&#x27;s General Management Plan specifies an annual capacity of 28,470. The mountain hikers generated irregular and seasonal jobs for about 11,000 guides, porters, and cooks in 2007. Concerns have been raised about the poor working conditions and inadequate wages of these workers. 
Due to Kilimanjaro National Park&#x27;s popularity as a destination, the Tanzanian government has invested in road infrastructure to improve accessibility. In Tanzania, Kilimanjaro International Airport also serves as an important transportation hub.

There are seven official trekking routes by which to ascend and descend Kilimanjaro: Lemosho, Lemosho Western-Breach, Machame, Marangu, Mweka, Rongai, Shira, and Umbwe. The Machame route can be completed in six or seven days, Lemosho in six to eight, and the Northern Circuit routes in seven or more days. The Lemosho Route can also be continued via the Western-Breach, submitting via the western side of the mountain. The Western Breach is more secluded and avoids the 6-hour midnight ascent to the summit (like other routes). The Rongai is the easiest of the camping routes. The Marangu is also relatively easy, if frequently busy; accommodation is in shared huts. The Lemosho Western-Breach Route commences on the western side of Kilimanjaro at Lemosho and continues to the summit via the Western-Breach Route.

=== Mawenzi technical climbing ===
Technical climbing routes are available on the Mawenzi cone of Mount Kilimanjaro. Unlike the traditional routes to Uhuru Peak on Kibo, which are open to the general public, climbing Mawenzi requires a special permit from the Tanzania National Parks Authority. These permits are issued exclusively to experienced climbers with appropriate equipment. Climbing on Mawenzi is limited to a maximum of two climbers at a time and is restricted to daytime hours.

=== Climbing records ===
The oldest person to climb Mount Kilimanjaro is Anne Lorimor, aged 89 years and 37 days, who reached Uhuru Peak at 3:14 p.m. local time on 18 July 2019. The oldest man to summit is American Fred Dishelhorst, who reached the top on 19 July 2017 at the age of 88 years old. The second oldest man to summit the mountain is the American Robert Wheeler, who was 85 years and 201 days when he summited on 2 October 2014. Maxwell J. Ojerholm of Massachusetts, USA, reached Uhuru Peak, the true summit, unassisted, at the age of ten years, on July 4, 2009, taking the difficult Machame Route. Colin M. Barker of Missouri, USA, later completed the same route at the age of ten on December 22, 2020. Theodore Margaroli from London, age 10, reached the summit unassisted by the Western Breach, the hardest but most scenic route, in 2019. Despite an age limit of 10 years for a climbing permit, Keats Boyd from Los Angeles reached the summit on 21 January 2008 at the age of 7. This record was equaled by Montannah Kenney from Texas in March 2018 and again in July 2018 by Coaltan Tanner from New Mexico.
The fastest ascent and the fastest round trip have been recorded by the Swiss-Ecuadorian mountain guide Karl Egloff. On 13 August 2014, after guiding a party to the summit the previous days, he ran from Umbwe Gate to the top in 4 hours and 56 minutes and returned to the Mweka Gate at in a total time of 6 hours, 42 minutes and 24 seconds. Previous records, using the same route, were held by Spanish mountain runner Kílian Jornet (ascent in 5:23:50, round trip 7:14 on 29 September 2010) and by Tanzanian guide Simon Mtuy (an unsupported round trip in 9:21 on 22 February 2006).

The female round trip record is held by Fernanda Maciel from Brazil in a time of 10 hours and 6 minutes. Her ascent time of 7:08 was broken on 23 February 2018 by the Danish ultramarathon runner Kristina Schou Madsen with a time of 6:52:54 from Mweka Gate.

Several climbs by disabled people have drawn attention. Wheelchair user Bernard Goosen from South Africa scaled Kilimanjaro in six days in 2007. In 2012, Kyle Maynard who has no forearms or lower legs, crawled unassisted to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro.

On February 9, 2015, Red Bull athlete Valerii Rozov performed the first wing-suit BASE jump from the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro. He flew approximately 3 kilometres before landing on the southern slope. 

In 2020, a team featuring two double above-knee amputees, Hari Budha Magar and Justin Oliver Davis, summited Kilimanjaro. It took them six days to cover the distance to the summit.

=== Safety ===

According to climbing standards, the difficulty level of trekking Kilimanjaro is rated F: Easy (Alpine Grade 1). Therefore the climb is not technically as challenging as the Himalayas or Andes, but the high elevation, low temperature, and occasional high winds can make Kilimanjaro a difficult trek. Acclimatization is required, and even experienced and physically fit trekkers may suffer some degree of altitude sickness. A study of people attempting to reach the summit of Kilimanjaro in July and August 2005 found that 61.3 percent succeeded and 77 percent experienced acute mountain sickness (AMS). A retrospective study of 917 persons who attempted to reach the summit via the Lemosho or Machame routes found that 70.4 percent experienced AMS, defined in this study to be headache, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, or loss of appetite.

Kilimanjaro&#x27;s summit is well above the altitude at which life-threatening high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) or high altitude cerebral edema (HACE), the most severe forms of AMS, can occur. These health risks are increased substantially by excessively fast climbing schedules motivated by high daily national park fees, busy holiday travel schedules, and the lack of permanent shelter on most routes. The six-day Machame route, which involves one day of &quot;climbing high&quot; to Lava Tower ( and &quot;sleeping low&quot; at Barranco Camp (), may delay the onset of AMS but does not ultimately prevent its occurrence.

Falls on steep portions of the mountain and rock slides have killed trekkers. For this reason, the route via the Arrow Glacier was closed for several years, reopening in December 2007. Now again it officially closed as of January 20, 2024. Due to strong El Niño, the Western Breach has washed down the mountain. This huge runoff has carved new ravines on the slopes and seems to be dislodging the sediment that cements the rock together, disrupting the rock stability.  At the route&#x27;s base, rain water has opened new drainages and there is an active, flowing river through the Arrow Glacier Camp where there has been no water at all for decades. The improper disposal of human waste on the mountain environment has created a health hazard, necessitating the boiling of all water.

According to the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre in Moshi, 25 people died from January 1996 to October 2003 while climbing the mountain. Seventeen were female and eight were male, ranging in age from 29 to 74. Fourteen died from advanced high altitude illness, including one with HACE, five with HAPE, and six with both HACE and HAPE. The remaining eleven deaths resulted from &quot;trauma (3), myocardial infarction (4), pneumonia (2), cardio-pulmonary failure of other underlying cause (1), and acute appendicitis (1). The overall mortality rate was 13.6 per 100,000 climbers.&quot;

==In literature and film==

Journalist Tom Bissell noted that Kilimanjaro is &quot;perhaps the world&#x27;s most literary mountain&quot;. The mountain is prominently featured in Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s 1936 short story &quot;The Snows of Kilimanjaro&quot;, which was adapted into a 1952 film starring Gregory Peck. Dave Eggers wrote about his ascent in the short story &quot;Up the Mountain Coming Down Slowly&quot;. Writer Douglas Adams climbed the mountain in a rubber rhinoceros suit to raise money for African rhino conservation efforts.

Kilimanjaro was featured in Toto&#x27;s 1982 song &quot;Africa&quot;. An IMAX film documenting an ascent—&quot;Kilimanjaro: To The Roof Of Africa&quot;—was released in 2002. Kilimanjaro is also prominently featured in the &quot;Lion King&quot; franchise.

<text>In the aviation industry, a flight number or flight designator is a code for an airline service consisting of two-character airline designator and a 1 to 4 digit number. For example, QF9 is a Qantas Airways service from Perth, Australia to London Heathrow. A service is called &quot;direct&quot; if it is covered by a single flight number, regardless of the number of stops or equipment changes. For example, QF1 flies from Sydney to Singapore to London on Qantas Airways. A given flight segment may have multiple flight numbers on different airlines under a code-sharing agreement. Strictly speaking, the flight number is just the numerical part, but it is commonly used for the entire flight designator.

The flight designator of the operating carrier of a commercial flight is used as a call sign. This is distinct from the aircraft&#x27;s registration number, which identifies a specific airplane.

==Conventions==
A number of conventions have been developed for defining flight numbers, although these vary widely from airline to airline, and are increasingly being modified. Eastbound and northbound flights are traditionally assigned even numbers, while westbound and southbound flights have odd numbers. Other airlines will use an odd number for an outbound flight and use the next even number for the reverse inbound flight. For destinations served by multiple flights per day, numbers tend to increase during the day. Hence, a flight from point A to point B might be flight 401 and the return flight from B to A would be 402, while the next pair of flights on the same route would usually be assigned codes 403 and 404.

Flight numbers of less than three digits are often assigned to long-haul or otherwise premium flights. For example, flight number 1 is often used for an airline&#x27;s &quot;flagship&quot; service (see below for a &#x27;List of flight number 1 by airlines&#x27;). However Cathay Pacific assigns flight numbers which are less than 100 for cargo flights.

Four-digit numbers in the range 3000 to 5999 typically represent regional affiliate flights, while numbers larger than 6000 are generally codeshare numbers for flights operated by different airlines or even railways.

Likewise, flight numbers larger than 9000 usually refer to ferry flights; these carry no passengers and are used to relocate aircraft to or from a maintenance base, or from one air travel market to another in order to start new commercial flights. Flight numbers starting with 8 are often used for charter flights, but it always depends on the commercial carrier&#x27;s choice.

===Flight numbering system in mainland China===
The People&#x27;s Republic of China uses a completely different system for assigning flight segments than most countries; prior to 1988 reformation, there was only one major airline in mainland China, CAAC, which initially used “the first digit of the flight number represents the base airport (1 North China, 2 Northwest China, 3 South China, 4 Southwest China, 5 East China, and 6 Northeast China) for domestic flights, and the end of the number has an odd digit for departures and an even digit for return trips”. In the 1980s, a second digit joined, indicating the destination of flights (many domestic flights of Air China and China Eastern from their base still follow this rule); one-digit and two-digit flight numbers are usually reserved for executive charters or special mission flights (e.g., the flight carrying the black boxes and American investigators of the China Eastern Airlines Flight 5735 in 2022 used flight numbers CA79 and CA80).
With the privatization and booming of China&#x27;s civil aviation, in 2004 the CAAC issued a system for allocating flight numbers across the country, with Air China allocated 1XXX, 4XXX, and 9XX, China Eastern 2XXX and 5XXX, China Southern 3XXX and 6XXX, Hainan Airlines 7XXX, Sichuan and Xiamen 8XXX, and stipulating that Chinese airlines should not use the same flight numbers each other. However, this rule is no longer strictly enforced, as the allocated numbers have become shortage of use.&lt;br&gt;
As a result, there are three special cases in China:&lt;br&gt;
1. Flight number 9XXX may be a regular flight, while smaller number like 500 or 2000 might be used on ferry flights or codeshare ones.&lt;br&gt;
2. Flagship flights do not use one-digit or two-digit flight numbers, and may even be four-digit flight numbers.&lt;br&gt;
3. Flight numbers in the event of an aviation accident will not be retired, as seen on Air China Flight 129 which is still active as of January 2025 (albeit using a different type of aircraft). Still, there are exceptions, as with the case of the aforementioned China Eastern Airlines Flight 5735.

==Codeshare==

In a codeshare, airlines share their aircraft with others, resulting in the flight having more than one flight number on the same sector, and either the same or different flight numbers on joined sectors.

As an example, QF8412 flies from Dubai to Sydney, but it is codeshared with and operated as EK412. Another example is QF3920, which is a flight from Lima, Peru to Santiago, Chile that is also codeshared with LATAM 523.

== List of flight number 1 by airline ==
Most flights are non-stop from A to B, and few are from A to B then to C (both A-B and B-C have flight number 1). Aircraft type may change due to operation need or unforeseen circumstance.

A notable former flight number 1 was British Airways flight BA1, operated by the Concorde between London Heathrow and New York&#x27;s John F. Kennedy airport. After the retirement of Concorde in 2003 the flight number was retired with it, however in 2009 it was given to the all business class A318 flight between London City Airport and New York JFK via Shannon in Ireland. This route ceased operation in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and British Airways has since announced it will not be restarting the service.

==Flight number changes==
Flight numbers are often taken out of use after a crash or a serious incident. Examples include:

* Following the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, the airline changed the flight number for subsequent flights following the same route to MH 318. 
* American Airlines Flight 77, which regularly flew from Dulles International Airport in Washington, DC, to Los Angeles International Airport, was changed to Flight 149 after it crashed into the Pentagon during the September 11 attacks. 
* After the crash of Air France Flight 447 over the Atlantic Ocean, a regular scheduled flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, was changed to Air France Flight 445. 
* Following the crash of Asiana Airlines Flight 214 in July 2013, Asiana change the numbered flight pairs from Asiana Airlines 213/214 to 211/212.

Other considerations may lead an airline not to change a flight number; there are at least four instances of the same flight numbers that have suffered two serious accidents: 

* Flight 315 of Aeroflot (in 1959 and 1960)
* Flight 253 of Linea Aeropostal Venezolana (both in 1956, the first in June, and the second in November)
* Flight 869 of United Arab Airlines (the first in 1962 and the second in 1963)
* Flight 800 of TWA (the first in 1964 and the second in 1996)
* Flight 383 of American Airlines (the first in 1965 and the second in 2016).
* And the instance of the aforementioned &quot;flagship&quot; American Airlines Flight 1, it retains its designation despite three major accidents in 1962, 1941, and 1936.
* Flight 251 of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky Air (the first in 2012 and second in 2021)
* Flight 5 of Northwest Airlines (the first in 1941 and the second in 1990).
* Flight 63 of American Airlines (the first in July 1943 and the second in October 1943, along with an attempted bombing in 2001 and a near mid-air collision in 2006).

==Flight number conservation==
Airline mega mergers, in markets such as the United States, have made it necessary to break conventional flight numbering schemes. Organizations such as IATA, ICAO, ARC, as well as CRS systems and the FAA&#x27;s ATC systems limit flight numbers to four digits (0001 to 9999). The pool of available flight numbers has been outstripped by demand for them by emergent mega-carriers. As such, some carriers use the same flight number for back-and-forth flights (e.g., DCA-PBI-DCA), or in other cases carriers have assigned a single flight number to a multi-leg flight (e.g., ICT-DAL-HOU-MDW-OMA-DEN-ABQ-LAS-BDL).

==Flight designator==
Although &#x27;flight number&#x27; is the term used colloquially, the official term as defined in the Standard Schedules Information Manual (SSIM) published annually by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Schedules Information Standards Committee (SISC), is flight designator. Officially the term &#x27;flight number&#x27; refers to the numeric part (up to four digits) of a flight code. For example, in the flight codes QF103 and AF296Q, &quot;103&quot; and &quot;296&quot; are flight numbers. Even within the airline and airport industry, it is common to use the colloquial term rather than the official term.

==Spacecraft==
Flight numbers are also sometimes used for spacecraft, though a flight number for an expendable rocket (say, Ariane 5 Flight 501) might more reasonably be called the serial number of the vehicle used, since an expendable rocket can only be launched once. Space Shuttle missions used numbers with the STS prefix, for example, STS-93. SpaceX uses sequential numbers for flights of reused boosters. As an example, Crew-2 used booster B1061.2 (the second flight of booster B1061).

<text>The International Phonetic Association (IPA; , API) is an organization that promotes the scientific study of phonetics and the various practical applications of that science. The IPA&#x27;s major contribution to phonetics is the International Phonetic Alphabet—a notational standard for the phonetic representation of all languages. The acronym IPA refers to both the association and the alphabet. On 30 June 2015, it was incorporated as a British private company limited by guarantee.

The IPA also oversees the &quot;Journal of the International Phonetic Association&quot;, published by Cambridge University Press, whose articles include descriptions of languages as well as other topics in phonetics. In addition, it arranges for the quadrennial International Congress of Phonetic Sciences (ICPhS) through its affiliate, the Permanent Council for the Organization of ICPhS.

== Early history ==

In 1886, a small group of language teachers in Paris formed an association to encourage the use of phonetic notation in schools to help children acquire realistic pronunciations of foreign languages and also to aid in teaching reading to young children. The group, led by Paul Passy, called itself initially &quot;Dhi Fonètik Tîtcerz&#x27; Asóciécon&quot; (the &quot;FTA&quot;). In January 1889, the name of the Association was changed to (), and, in 1897, to ()—in English, the &quot;International Phonetic Association (IPA).&quot; The IPA&#x27;s early peak of membership and influence in education circles was around 1914, when there were 1751 members in 40 countries. World War I and its aftermath severely disrupted the Association&#x27;s activities, and the Journal did not resume regular publication until 1922.

== Development of the Alphabet ==

The group&#x27;s initial aim was to create a set of phonetic symbols to which different articulations could apply, such that each language would have an alphabet particularly suited to describe the sounds of the language. Eventually it was decided that a universal alphabet, with the same symbol being used for the same sound in different languages was the ideal. The first prototype of the International Phonetic Alphabet appeared in , and its development progressed rapidly up to the turn of the 20th century. Since then, there have been several sets of changes to the Alphabet, with additions and deletions that the progress of the science of phonetics has indicated.

== Examinations ==

The IPA also has given examinations in phonetics since 1908, awarding Certificates of Proficiency in the phonetics of English, French, or German.

<doc id="159471" wikidata="Q6863446" url="?curid=159471" title="Mind Bomb">
<text>Mind Bomb is the third studio album by the English post-punk band The The. It was released by Some Bizzare/Epic on 15 May 1989 and recorded during late 1988 and early 1989. It is the band&#x27;s first album to feature former The Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr.

The album peaked at No. 4 on the UK Albums Chart.

==Overview==
Matt Johnson assembled a full band of The The, retaining his role as singer, primary songwriter, frontman and guitarist (and playing keyboards and other instruments in the studio), and bringing in guitarist Johnny Marr. Johnson had known Marr since the early 1980s, and had attempted to entice him into an earlier version of The The prior to Marr forming The Smiths. Completing the lineup was former Julian Cope band bass guitarist James Eller and session drummer David Palmer (while D.C. Collard provided live keyboards). Additional instrumentation on &quot;Mind Bomb&quot; was provided by sessioneers, most notably keyboard player Wix.

Instead of the darkly polished dance-pop styling of earlier albums &quot;Soul Mining&quot; and &quot;Infected&quot;, &quot;Mind Bomb&quot; opens up the music to reveal a slow, winding textured world of sound, thanks in no small measure to Marr. Lyrical subjects include politics, religion, and romance. The band would also play a world tour and record a follow-up, &quot;Dusk&quot;. After that, Johnson dissolved it and went about his business alone again. A remastered version of the album was released in 2002.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Quietus&quot; called the album &quot;slow, expansive, looming into inexorable life with a rage that smouldered rather than flamed.&quot; &quot;The Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; called it &quot;bombastic in tone and filled with lyrical diatribes and anti-religious rants allied to distinctly unmelodic songs.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;an embarrassing exercise in breast-beating,&quot; writing that &quot;this bloated record is doubly distressing considering that it’s the work of the same man who turned out one of the most mysterious and lovely pop tunes of the ‘80s, &#x27;Uncertain Smile&#x27;.&quot; In a retrospective review, &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; wrote that &quot;it’s easy to let the seemingly prescient relevance of the lyrics to &quot;Mind Bomb&quot; outweigh the actual music, which would be a shame because, with or without those words, it’s still a great record.&quot;

<doc id="159472" wikidata="Q206021" url="?curid=159472" title="Flight">
<text>Flight or flying is the motion of an object through an atmosphere, or through the vacuum of outer space, without contacting any planetary surface. This can be achieved by generating aerodynamic lift associated with gliding or propulsive thrust, aerostatically using buoyancy, or by ballistic movement.

Many things can fly, from animal aviators such as birds, bats and insects, to natural gliders/parachuters such as patagial animals, anemochorous seeds and ballistospores, to human inventions like aircraft (airplanes, helicopters, airships, balloons, etc.) and rockets which may propel spacecraft and spaceplanes.

The engineering aspects of flight are the purview of aerospace engineering which is subdivided into aeronautics, the study of vehicles that travel through the atmosphere, and astronautics, the study of vehicles that travel through space, and ballistics, the study of the flight of projectiles.

== Types of flight ==

=== Buoyant flight ===
Humans have managed to construct lighter-than-air vehicles that raise off the ground and fly, due to their buoyancy in the air.

An aerostat is a system that remains aloft primarily through the use of buoyancy to give an aircraft the same overall density as air. Aerostats include free balloons, airships, and moored balloons. An aerostat&#x27;s main structural component is its , a lightweight skin that encloses a volume of lifting gas to provide buoyancy, to which other components are attached.

Aerostats are so named because they use &quot;aerostatic&quot; lift, a buoyant force that does not require lateral movement through the surrounding air mass to effect a lifting force. By contrast, aerodynes primarily use aerodynamic lift, which requires the lateral movement of at least some part of the aircraft through the surrounding air mass.

=== Aerodynamic flight ===

==== Unpowered flight versus powered flight ====

Some things that fly do not generate propulsive thrust through the air, for example, the flying squirrel. This is termed gliding. Some other things can exploit rising air to climb such as raptors (when gliding) and man-made sailplane gliders. This is termed soaring. However most other birds and all powered aircraft need a source of propulsion to climb. This is termed powered flight.

==== Animal flight ====

The only groups of living things that use powered flight are birds, insects, and bats, while many groups have evolved gliding. The extinct pterosaurs, an order of reptiles contemporaneous with the dinosaurs, were also very successful flying animals, and there were apparently some flying dinosaurs (see Flying and gliding animals#Non-avian dinosaurs). Each of these groups&#x27; wings evolved independently, with insects the first animal group to evolve flight. The wings of the flying vertebrate groups are all based on the forelimbs, but differ significantly in structure; insect wings are hypothesized to be highly modified versions of structures that form gills in most other groups of arthropods.

Bats are the only mammals capable of sustaining level flight (see &quot;bat flight&quot;). However, there are several gliding mammals which are able to glide from tree to tree using fleshy membranes between their limbs; some can travel hundreds of meters in this way with very little loss in height. Flying frogs use greatly enlarged webbed feet for a similar purpose, and there are flying lizards which fold out their mobile ribs into a pair of flat gliding surfaces. &quot;Flying&quot; snakes also use mobile ribs to flatten their body into an aerodynamic shape, with a back and forth motion much the same as they use on the ground.

Flying fish can glide using enlarged wing-like fins, and have been observed soaring for hundreds of meters. It is thought that this ability was chosen by natural selection because it was an effective means of escape from underwater predators. The longest recorded flight of a flying fish was 45 seconds.

Most birds fly (&quot;see bird flight&quot;), with some exceptions. The largest birds, the ostrich and the emu, are earthbound flightless birds, as were the now-extinct dodos and the Phorusrhacids, which were the dominant predators of South America in the Cenozoic era. The non-flying penguins have wings adapted for use under water and use the same wing movements for swimming that most other birds use for flight. Most small flightless birds are native to small islands, and lead a lifestyle where flight would offer little advantage.

Among living animals that fly, the wandering albatross has the greatest wingspan, up to ; the great bustard has the greatest weight, topping at .

Most species of insects can fly as adults. Insect flight makes use of either of two basic aerodynamic models: creating a leading edge vortex, found in most insects, and using clap and fling, found in very small insects such as thrips.

Many species of spiders, spider mites and lepidoptera use a technique called ballooning to ride air currents such as thermals, by exposing their gossamer threads which gets lifted by wind and atmospheric electric fields.

==== Mechanical ====

Mechanical flight is the use of a machine to fly. These machines include aircraft such as airplanes, gliders, helicopters, autogyros, airships, balloons, ornithopters as well as spacecraft. Gliders are capable of unpowered flight. Another form of mechanical flight is para-sailing, where a parachute-like object is pulled by a boat. In an airplane, lift is created by the wings; the shape of the wings of the airplane are designed specially for the type of flight desired. There are different types of wings: tempered, semi-tempered, sweptback, rectangular and elliptical. An aircraft wing is sometimes called an airfoil, which is a device that creates lift when air flows across it.

===== Supersonic =====

Supersonic flight is flight faster than the speed of sound. Supersonic flight is associated with the formation of shock waves that form a sonic boom that can be heard from the ground, and is frequently startling. The creation of this shockwave requires a significant amount of energy; because of this, supersonic flight is generally less efficient than subsonic flight at about 85% of the speed of sound.

===== Hypersonic =====

Hypersonic flight is very high speed flight where the heat generated by the compression of the air due to the motion through the air causes chemical changes to the air. Hypersonic flight is achieved primarily by reentering spacecraft such as the Space Shuttle and Soyuz.
=== Ballistic ===
==== Atmospheric ====
Some things generate little or no lift and move only or mostly under the action of momentum, gravity, air drag and in some cases thrust. This is termed &quot;ballistic flight&quot;. Examples include balls, arrows, bullets, fireworks etc.

==== Spaceflight ====

Essentially an extreme form of ballistic flight, spaceflight is the use of space technology to achieve the flight of spacecraft into and through outer space. Examples include ballistic missiles, orbital spaceflight, etc.

Spaceflight is used in space exploration, and also in commercial activities like space tourism and satellite telecommunications. Additional non-commercial uses of spaceflight include space observatories, reconnaissance satellites and other Earth observation satellites.

A spaceflight typically begins with a rocket launch, which provides the initial thrust to overcome the force of gravity and propels the spacecraft from the surface of the Earth. Once in space, the motion of a spacecraft—both when unpropelled and when under propulsion—is covered by the area of study called astrodynamics. Some spacecraft remain in space indefinitely, some disintegrate during atmospheric reentry, and others reach a planetary or lunar surface for landing or impact.

==== Solid-state propulsion ====
In 2018, researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) managed to fly an aeroplane with no moving parts, powered by an &quot;ionic wind&quot; also known as electroaerodynamic thrust.

== History ==
Many human cultures have built devices that fly, from the earliest projectiles such as stones and spears, the
boomerang in Australia, the hot air Kongming lantern, and kites.

=== Aviation ===

George Cayley studied flight scientifically in the first half of the 19th century, and in the second half of the 19th century Otto Lilienthal made over 200 gliding flights and was also one of the first to understand flight scientifically. His work was replicated and extended by the Wright brothers who made gliding flights and finally the first controlled and extended, manned powered flights.

=== Spaceflight ===

Spaceflight, particularly human spaceflight became a reality in the 20th century following theoretical and practical breakthroughs by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky and Robert H. Goddard. The first orbital spaceflight was in 1957, and Yuri Gagarin was carried aboard the first crewed orbital spaceflight in 1961.

== Physics ==

There are different approaches to flight. If an object has a lower density than air, then it is buoyant and is able to float in the air without expending energy. A heavier than air craft, known as an aerodyne, includes flighted animals and insects, fixed-wing aircraft and rotorcraft. Because the craft is heavier than air, it must generate lift to overcome its weight. The wind resistance caused by the craft moving through the air is called drag and is overcome by propulsive thrust except in the case of gliding.

Some vehicles also use thrust in the place of lift; for example rockets and Harrier jump jets.

=== Forces ===

Forces relevant to flight are
* Propulsive thrust (except in gliders)
* Lift, created by the reaction to an airflow
* Drag, created by aerodynamic friction
* Weight, created by gravity
* Buoyancy, for lighter than air flight

These forces must be balanced for stable flight to occur.

==== Thrust ====

A fixed-wing aircraft generates forward thrust when air is pushed in the direction opposite to flight. This can be done in several ways including by the spinning blades of a propeller, or a rotating fan pushing air out from the back of a jet engine, or by ejecting hot gases from a rocket engine. The forward thrust is proportional to the mass of the airstream multiplied by the difference in velocity of the airstream. Reverse thrust can be generated to aid braking after landing by reversing the pitch of variable-pitch propeller blades, or using a thrust reverser on a jet engine. Rotary wing aircraft and thrust vectoring V/STOL aircraft use engine thrust to support the weight of the aircraft, and vector sum of this thrust fore and aft to control forward speed.

==== Lift ====

In the context of an air flow relative to a flying body, the lift force is the component of the aerodynamic force that is perpendicular to the flow direction. Aerodynamic lift results when the wing causes the surrounding air to be deflected - the air then causes a force on the wing in the opposite direction, in accordance with Newton&#x27;s third law of motion.

Lift is commonly associated with the wing of an aircraft, although lift is also generated by rotors on rotorcraft (which are effectively rotating wings, performing the same function without requiring that the aircraft move forward through the air). While common meanings of the word &quot;&quot; suggest that lift opposes gravity, aerodynamic lift can be in any direction. When an aircraft is cruising for example, lift does oppose gravity, but lift occurs at an angle when climbing, descending or banking. On high-speed cars, the lift force is directed downwards (called &quot;down-force&quot;) to keep the car stable on the road.

==== Drag ====

For a solid object moving through a fluid, the drag is the component of the net aerodynamic or hydrodynamic force acting opposite to the direction of the movement. Therefore, drag opposes the motion of the object, and in a powered vehicle it must be overcome by thrust. The process which creates lift also causes some drag.

==== Lift-to-drag ratio ====
Aerodynamic lift is created by the motion of an aerodynamic object (wing) through the air, which due to its shape and angle deflects the air. For sustained straight and level flight, lift must be equal and opposite to weight. In general, long narrow wings are able deflect a large amount of air at a slow speed, whereas smaller wings need a higher forward speed to deflect an equivalent amount of air and thus generate an equivalent amount of lift. Large cargo aircraft tend to use longer wings with higher angles of attack, whereas supersonic aircraft tend to have short wings and rely heavily on high forward speed to generate lift.

However, this lift (deflection) process inevitably causes a retarding force called drag. Because lift and drag are both aerodynamic forces, the ratio of lift to drag is an indication of the aerodynamic efficiency of the airplane. The lift to drag ratio is the L/D ratio, pronounced &quot;L over D ratio.&quot; An airplane has a high L/D ratio if it produces a large amount of lift or a small amount of drag. The lift/drag ratio is determined by dividing the lift coefficient by the drag coefficient, CL/CD.

The lift coefficient Cl is equal to the lift L divided by the (density r times half the velocity V squared times the wing area A). [Cl = L / (A * .5 * r * V^2)] The lift coefficient is also affected by the compressibility of the air, which is much greater at higher speeds, so velocity V is not a linear function. Compressibility is also affected by the shape of the aircraft surfaces.
The drag coefficient Cd is equal to the drag D divided by the (density r times half the velocity V squared times the reference area A). [Cd = D / (A * .5 * r * V^2)] 
Lift-to-drag ratios for practical aircraft vary from about 4:1 for vehicles and birds with relatively short wings, up to 60:1 or more for vehicles with very long wings, such as gliders. A greater angle of attack relative to the forward movement also increases the extent of deflection, and thus generates extra lift. However a greater angle of attack also generates extra drag.

Lift/drag ratio also determines the glide ratio and gliding range. Since the glide ratio is based only on the relationship of the aerodynamics forces acting on the aircraft, aircraft weight will not affect it. The only effect weight has is to vary the time that the aircraft will glide for – a heavier aircraft gliding at a higher airspeed will arrive at the same touchdown point in a shorter time.

==== Buoyancy ====

Air pressure acting up against an object in air is greater than the pressure above pushing down. The buoyancy, in both cases, is equal to the weight of fluid displaced - Archimedes&#x27; principle holds for air just as it does for water.

A cubic meter of air at ordinary atmospheric pressure and room temperature has a mass of about 1.2 kilograms, so its weight is about 12 newtons. Therefore, any 1-cubic-meter object in air is buoyed up with a force of 12 newtons. If the mass of the 1-cubic-meter object is greater than 1.2 kilograms (so that its weight is greater than 12 newtons), it falls to the ground when released. If an object of this size has a mass less than 1.2 kilograms, it rises in the air. Any object that has a mass that is less than the mass of an equal volume of air will rise in air - in other words, any object less dense than air will rise.

==== Thrust to weight ratio ====

Thrust-to-weight ratio is, as its name suggests, the ratio of instantaneous thrust to weight (where weight means weight at the Earth&#x27;s standard acceleration formula_1). It is a dimensionless parameter characteristic of rockets and other jet engines and of vehicles propelled by such engines (typically space launch vehicles and jet aircraft).

If the thrust-to-weight ratio is greater than the local gravity strength (expressed in &quot;g&quot;s), then flight can occur without any forward motion or any aerodynamic lift being required.

If the thrust-to-weight ratio times the lift-to-drag ratio is greater than local gravity then takeoff using aerodynamic lift is possible.

=== Flight dynamics ===


Flight dynamics is the science of air and space vehicle orientation and control in three dimensions. The three critical flight dynamics parameters are the angles of rotation in three dimensions about the vehicle&#x27;s center of mass, known as &quot;pitch&quot;, &quot;roll&quot; and &quot;yaw&quot; (See Tait-Bryan rotations for an explanation).

The control of these dimensions can involve a horizontal stabilizer (i.e. &quot;a tail&quot;), ailerons and other movable aerodynamic devices which control angular stability i.e. flight attitude (which in turn affects altitude, heading). Wings are often angled slightly upwards- they have &quot;positive dihedral angle&quot; which gives inherent roll stabilization.
=== Energy efficiency ===

To create thrust so as to be able to gain height, and to push through the air to overcome the drag associated with lift all takes energy. Different objects and creatures capable of flight vary in the efficiency of their muscles, motors and how well this translates into forward thrust.

Propulsive efficiency determines how much energy vehicles generate from a unit of fuel.

=== Range ===

The range that powered flight articles can achieve is ultimately limited by their drag, as well as how much energy they can store on board and how efficiently they can turn that energy into propulsion.

For powered aircraft the useful energy is determined by their fuel fraction- what percentage of the takeoff weight is fuel, as well as the specific energy of the fuel used.

=== Power-to-weight ratio ===

All animals and devices capable of sustained flight need relatively high power-to-weight ratios to be able to generate enough lift and/or thrust to achieve take off.

== Takeoff and landing ==

Vehicles that can fly can have different ways to takeoff and land. Conventional aircraft accelerate along the ground until sufficient lift is generated for takeoff, and reverse the process for landing. Some aircraft can take off at low speed; this is called a short takeoff. Some aircraft such as helicopters and Harrier jump jets can take off and land vertically. Rockets also usually take off and land vertically, but some designs can land horizontally.

== Guidance, navigation and control ==
=== Navigation ===
Navigation is the systems necessary to calculate current position (e.g. compass, GPS, LORAN, star tracker, inertial measurement unit, and altimeter).

In aircraft, successful air navigation involves piloting an aircraft from place to place without getting lost, breaking the laws applying to aircraft, or endangering the safety of those on board or on the ground.

The techniques used for navigation in the air will depend on whether the aircraft is flying under the visual flight rules (VFR) or the instrument flight rules (IFR). In the latter case, the pilot will navigate exclusively using instruments and radio navigation aids such as beacons, or as directed under radar control by air traffic control. In the VFR case, a pilot will largely navigate using dead reckoning combined with visual observations (known as pilotage), with reference to appropriate maps. This may be supplemented using radio navigation aids.

=== Guidance ===

A guidance system is a device or group of devices used in the navigation of a ship, aircraft, missile, rocket, satellite, or other moving object. Typically, guidance is responsible for the calculation of the vector (i.e., direction, velocity) toward an objective.

=== Control ===

A conventional fixed-wing aircraft flight control system consists of flight control surfaces, the respective cockpit controls, connecting linkages, and the necessary operating mechanisms to control an aircraft&#x27;s direction in flight. Aircraft engine controls are also considered as flight controls as they change speed.

==== Traffic ====
In the case of aircraft, air traffic is controlled by air traffic control systems.

Collision avoidance is the process of controlling spacecraft to try to prevent collisions.

== Flight safety ==

Air safety is a term encompassing the theory, investigation and categorization of flight failures, and the prevention of such failures through regulation, education and training. It can also be applied in the context of campaigns that inform the public as to the safety of air travel.

<text>Edward Harrison Norton (born August 18, 1969) is an American actor, producer, director, and screenwriter. After graduating from Yale College in 1991 with a degree in history, he worked for a few months in Japan before moving to Manhattan to pursue an acting career. He gained recognition and critical acclaim for his debut in &quot;Primal Fear&quot; (1996), which earned him a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor and an Academy Award nomination in the same category. His role as a redeemed neo-Nazi in &quot;American History X&quot; (1998) earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. He also starred in the film &quot;Fight Club&quot; (1999), which garnered a cult following.

Norton established the production company Class 5 Films in 2003, and was director or producer of the films &quot;Keeping the Faith&quot; (2000), &quot;Down in the Valley&quot; (2005), and &quot;The Painted Veil&quot; (2006). He continued to receive praise for his acting roles in films such as &quot;The Score&quot; (2001), &quot;25th Hour&quot; (2002), &quot;The Italian Job&quot; (2003), &quot;The Illusionist&quot; (2006), &quot;Moonrise Kingdom&quot; (2012), and &quot;The Grand Budapest Hotel&quot; (2014). His biggest commercial successes have been &quot;Red Dragon&quot; (2002), &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot; (2005), &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; (2008), and &quot;The Bourne Legacy&quot; (2012). For his roles as a haughty actor in &quot;Birdman&quot; (2014) and Pete Seeger in &quot;A Complete Unknown&quot; (2024), Norton earned further Academy Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor. He has also directed and acted in the crime film &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot; (2019) and starred in &quot;Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery&quot; (2022). 

Norton is an environmental activist and social entrepreneur. He is a trustee of Enterprise Community Partners, a non-profit organization that advocates for affordable housing, and serves as president of the American branch of the Maasai Wilderness Conservation Trust. He is also the UN Goodwill Ambassador for Biodiversity.

==Early life==
Norton was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on August 18, 1969. He was raised in Columbia, Maryland. His father, Edward Mower Norton Jr., served in Vietnam as a Marine lieutenant before becoming an environmental lawyer and conservation advocate working in Asia and a federal prosecutor in the Carter administration. His mother, Lydia Robinson &quot;Robin&quot; (Rouse), was an English teacher who died of a brain tumor in 1997. Norton&#x27;s maternal grandfather, James Rouse, was the founder of The Rouse Company and co-founder of the real estate corporation Enterprise Community Partners. He has two younger siblings, Molly and James.

At age five, Norton and his parents saw a musical related to &quot;Cinderella&quot; at the Columbia Center for Theatrical Arts (CCTA), starring his babysitter, which ignited his interest in the theater. He enjoyed watching films with his father as a pre-teen, but later reflected that he was fascinated with the cinematography rather than the acting. Norton recalled that it was theater and not films that inspired him to act. He made his professional debut at the age of eight in the musical &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; at his hometown&#x27;s Toby&#x27;s Dinner Theatre. At the CCTA, he acted in several theatrical productions directed by Toby Orenstein.

In 1984, Norton won the acting cup at Pasquaney, an annual summer camp for boys in Hebron, New Hampshire, where he later returned as a theater director. He subsequently immersed himself in films, naming Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro as two of his early inspirations because &quot;the ones [he] liked were also the ones who made [him] think [he] could do it because they weren&#x27;t the most handsome guys&quot;. He graduated from Wilde Lake High School in 1987. He attended Yale College, graduating in 1991 with Bachelor of Arts in history. While at Yale, he also studied Japanese, acted in university productions, and was a competitive rower. After graduating from Yale in 1991, conversant in Japanese, Norton worked not-for-profit as a representative for his grandfather&#x27;s company, Enterprise Community Partners, in Osaka, Japan. 

==Career==
===1991–1994: Career beginnings===
After five months in Japan, Norton moved to New York City, where he supported himself working odd jobs. He took six months researching different acting techniques, focusing on method acting. He later took lessons from acting coach Terry Schreiber after discovering he was looking for a Japanese translator to help direct a play in Tokyo. Norton described him as a great teacher who encouraged students to become &quot;multilingual actors&quot; with different techniques for versatile roles.

Norton also wrote scripts for plays at the Signature Theatre Company and starred in off-Broadway theater. His performance in Brian Friel&#x27;s &quot;Lovers&quot; brought him to the attention of playwright Edward Albee, whose one-act plays Norton enjoyed. In 1994, Norton auditioned for Albee&#x27;s &quot;Finding the Sun&quot; but did not get the part. Albee found a new role for him instead and had Norton read for &quot;Fragments&quot;. The playwright was impressed with Norton&#x27;s rehearsal performance and cast him for its world premiere. Albee remarked that Norton was a rare actor &quot;who really knocked me out&quot;. Norton recalled that he was inspired by Al Pacino, who also began his career in theater while struggling to establish himself in New York.

===1995–1999: Breakthrough===
In 1995, casting agent Shirley Rich discovered Norton. He then rented a studio space near The Public Theater and presented his auditions of Shakespearean works to her. Impressed by his acting, she introduced Norton to the executives of the noir drama &quot;Primal Fear&quot;, an adaptation of William Diehl&#x27;s 1993 novel. He was selected for the part over two thousand other prospects. Released in 1996, &quot;Primal Fear&quot; features Norton in the role of Aaron Stampler, an altar boy who is charged with the murder of a Roman Catholic archbishop and is defended by Martin Vail (Richard Gere). His performance was lauded by critics; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; praised Norton&#x27;s character as &quot;completely convincing&quot;, while Peter Stack of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; dubbed the actor &quot;the one to watch&quot; after his debut. Norton won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor and was nominated for an Academy Award in the same category for his role in the film. Norton starred in two other films released in 1996; he played Larry Flynt&#x27;s lawyer Alan Isaacman in Milos Forman&#x27;s biographical drama &quot;The People vs. Larry Flynt&quot; and Holden Spence in Woody Allen&#x27;s musical film &quot;Everyone Says I Love You&quot;.
In 1998, Norton starred alongside Matt Damon in &quot;Rounders&quot;, which follows two friends who urgently need cash and play poker to pay off a huge debt. The film and Norton&#x27;s performance received a lukewarm response; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that his acting &quot;never really goes anywhere&quot;, while the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; observed that his character was not good enough to make the film interesting. His role in the crime drama &quot;American History X&quot;, released later that year, earned him widespread acclaim. In it, Norton portrays Derek Vinyard, a reformed neo-Nazi, who abandons his preconceived ideology after three years in prison. During production, Norton was allegedly dissatisfied with director Tony Kaye&#x27;s first screening. Consequently, he took over the editing (uncredited) and finished the final cut, which was 40 minutes longer than Kaye&#x27;s version. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that he gave Derek an &quot;ambiguous erotic allure&quot; which made the film memorable, while the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; deemed his performance an immediate contender for an Oscar. Norton received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, and won a Golden Satellite Award in the same category.

In the 1999 David Fincher-directed film &quot;Fight Club&quot;, Norton played an unnamed unreliable narrator who feels trapped in his white-collar job. The film is based on Chuck Palahniuk&#x27;s 1996 novel. To prepare for the role, Norton took lessons in boxing, taekwondo and grappling. &quot;Fight Club&quot; premiered at the 1999 Venice International Film Festival. During promotion for the film, Norton explained that &quot;Fight Club&quot; examines the value conflicts of Generation X as the first generation raised on television, by probing &quot;the despair and paralysis that people feel in the face of having inherited this value system out of advertising&quot;. While the film divided contemporary critics, Norton&#x27;s role was widely applauded. &quot;Time&quot; magazine labeled him &quot;excellent&quot;, and &quot;Variety&quot; magazine was impressed by his embracing a range of techniques needed for his character. For his performance, Norton was nominated for Best Actor by the Online Film Critics Society. Despite under-performing at the box office, &quot;Fight Club&quot; became a cult classic after its DVD release in 2000.

===2000–2008: Mainstream success and directorial debut===
In 2000, Norton made his directorial debut with the romantic comedy &quot;Keeping the Faith&quot;, starring as a priest named Brian Finn. The film received mixed critical reviews. &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; praised his acting and labeled the film &quot;a smart directorial debut&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; remarked that Norton&#x27;s emergence as a director was decent, but criticized the plot because it &quot;proposes heavy theological aims, then disavows any such thing&quot;. In 2001&#x27;s heist film &quot;The Score&quot;, Norton plays Jack Teller, an ambitious young thief caught in an unlikely alliance with career criminal Nick Wells (Robert De Niro) arranged by his fence, Max (Marlon Brando). &quot;The Score&quot; and Norton&#x27;s performance was well received. The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; stated that despite starring with screen legends De Niro and Brando, Norton&#x27;s acting &quot;outdoes even that of Brando&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; also lauded him as an &quot;enormously gifted young actor&quot; who pulled off the character successfully.
Norton appeared in four films released in 2002. He played kids show host Sheldon Mopes, who quickly rises to fame for his character &quot;Smoochy the Rhino&quot;, in the black comedy &quot;Death to Smoochy&quot;. It received negative critical feedback for its plot. He also portrayed Nelson Rockefeller in the biopic film &quot;Frida&quot;, which depicts the life of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo (Salma Hayek). Norton rewrote the script several times without credit, focusing on the historical context and adding some humor while retaining Kahlo&#x27;s real-life personality. The final screenplay, with Norton&#x27;s contribution, received positive reviews from critics as well as admiration from the film&#x27;s co-stars including Hayek and Alfred Molina, who portrayed Kahlo&#x27;s husband and fellow artist Diego Rivera. In the horror film &quot;Red Dragon&quot;, Norton starred as retired FBI profiler Will Graham, who consults with cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to catch Francis Dolarhyde (Ralph Fiennes), a serial killer who murders entire families. During production, Norton and director Brett Ratner argued frequently over the script. &quot;He likes to challenge the director. It&#x27;s all about intellectual debate,&quot; Ratner told &quot;The Times&quot; in 2003. &quot;... Edward&#x27;s instinct is going to be, &#x27;I have to take over this film.&#x27; He&#x27;s going to try to rescue the film. That&#x27;s both a blessing and a curse.&quot; Despite mixed reviews, &quot;Red Dragon&quot; was Norton&#x27;s most profitable venture in 2002, grossing over $200 million. Norton also co-produced and starred in &quot;25th Hour&quot;, a film about a drug dealer in post-9/11 New York City.

Paramount Pictures forced Norton to star in the heist film &quot;The Italian Job&quot; (2003), threatening to sue him for violating a three-film contract he had signed; the studio had previously distributed 1996&#x27;s &quot;Primal Fear&quot; and 2001&#x27;s &quot;The Score&quot;. Norton, accordingly, refused to promote the film&#x27;s release. His performance was well received by critics, with &quot;The New Yorker&quot; calling him &quot;intelligent and incisive ... one of those rare actors who hold the audience&#x27;s attention with everything they say&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised his character as &quot;perversely magnetic&quot; despite giving the film a negative review. During this time, Norton co-founded a production company, Class 5 Films, with Yale classmate Stuart Blumberg and film producer Bill Migliore. Norton was cast as Baldwin IV, the leper king of Jerusalem, in Ridley Scott&#x27;s 2005 historical film &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot;. Reviewers criticized the film&#x27;s lack of depth, while praising the cinematography. Jack Moore described Norton&#x27;s performance in &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot; as &quot;phenomenal&quot;, and &quot;so far removed from anything that he has ever done that we see the true complexities of his talent&quot;. It grossed over $211 million worldwide. Norton&#x27;s next lead role was in the neo-western film &quot;Down in the Valley&quot; (2005), playing a delusional man who claims to be a cowboy. While the film was criticized for its narrative, Norton was praised for his performance.

Norton had two major film roles in 2006, starring as Eisenheim the magician in &quot;The Illusionist&quot; and bacteriologist Walter Fane in &quot;The Painted Veil&quot;. Set in 19th-century Austria-Hungary, &quot;The Illusionist&quot; was loosely based on novelist Steven Millhauser&#x27;s short story &quot;Eisenheim the Illusionist&quot; and received generally positive critical reviews. The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; dubbed the film &quot;rich and elegant&quot; and wrote of Norton&#x27;s character: &quot;he doesn&#x27;t just seduce the on-screen audience but the audience watching in the movie theater&quot;. The &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; similarly lauded the film for its vibrant plot and described Norton&#x27;s performance as &quot;mysterious and understated&quot;. Norton co-produced &quot;The Painted Veil&quot;, in which he starred with Naomi Watts, who portrayed his character&#x27;s unfaithful wife. Like his previous venture, &quot;The Painted Veil&quot; garnered positive feedback from reviewers. &quot;The Guardian&quot; applauded the film as &quot;faultless&quot; and &quot;powerful&quot; as well as Norton&#x27;s &quot;genuinely affecting&quot; performance. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; appreciated that Norton&#x27;s production effort did not affect his acting.

Norton appeared in two documentaries in 2007: &quot;Brando&quot;, which chronicles the life and career of screen legend Marlon Brando, with whom Norton co-starred in 2001&#x27;s &quot;The Score&quot;, and &quot;Man from Plains&quot;, which depicts the post-presidency endeavors of former U.S. president Jimmy Carter. He starred in the crime drama &quot;Pride and Glory&quot; (2008) as Ray Tierney, an honest detective assigned to investigate the precinct run by his older brother. Reviewers criticized the film for its cliched plot.

==== 2006–2008: &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; ====

His next lead film role was Marvel Cinematic Universe&#x27;s Bruce Banner, and the accompanying alter ego Hulk in the big-budget superhero film &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, released in 2008. Norton initially turned down the part as he felt the 2003 version &quot;Hulk&quot; &quot;strayed far afield from a story that was familiar to people, ... which is a fugitive story&quot;. He joined the project during pre-production in 2006 and constantly provided rewrites of the script. Director Louis Leterrier welcomed his contributions, saying that, &quot;Edward&#x27;s script has given Bruce&#x27;s story real gravitas&quot;. However, screenwriter Zak Penn was displeased with Norton&#x27;s changes. The Writers Guild of America credited Penn as the sole writer, arguing that Norton had not contributed significantly to the screenplay. Norton did not participate in promoting the film and went to Africa for humanitarian activities instead, leading to rumors that Norton was sparking conflicts with the film&#x27;s producers. He dismissed the accusations and said that the media had misrepresented the &quot;healthy&quot; collaborations for headlines.

&quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; received generally favorable reviews upon release. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; felt that Norton&#x27;s presence improved the film to &quot;a thunderously efficient enterprise&quot; from the 2003 version. Conversely, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, while recognizing Norton&#x27;s decent performance, opined that the film lacked a solid script. It was a box office success, grossing over $263 million. Norton was expected to reprise his role in future Marvel Cinematic Universe ventures, including the 2012 blockbuster &quot;The Avengers&quot;. However, he was replaced by Mark Ruffalo, allegedly due to Norton&#x27;s &quot;disputes&quot; with Marvel. Norton later claimed that he chose not to play Hulk again because he &quot;wanted more diversity&quot; and opted against associating himself with one character throughout his career.

===2009-2014: Critical resurgence===
In 2009, Norton produced the documentary &quot;By the People: The Election of Barack Obama&quot;, which follows former U.S. president Barack Obama&#x27;s campaigns leading to his 2008 election victory. Norton planned for this project in 2006, when Obama was a senator from Illinois, elaborating that Obama was &quot;an interesting prism through which to examine politics&quot;. He had two lead film roles in 2010. He portrayed Brown University Professor Bill and his identical twin Brady Kincaid in the comedy &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;, and convicted arsonist Gerald &quot;Stone&quot; Creeson in the crime film &quot;Stone&quot;. Both received weak reviews; &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; was praised for Norton&#x27;s performance but criticized for its conflicting tonal shifts, while &quot;Stone&quot; was panned because of a clumsy plot with excessive twists.

Norton had two lead film roles in 2012. He starred as scoutmaster Randy Ward in charge of finding his missing camper in the coming-of-age film &quot;Moonrise Kingdom&quot;, directed by Wes Anderson. The film was acclaimed by critics and grossed over $68 million. His other lead role was in the action thriller &quot;The Bourne Legacy&quot;, the fourth installment in the &quot;Bourne&quot; series. In the film, Norton portrayed retired Air Force colonel Eric Byer, who decides to terminate an illegal operation after it is exposed to the FBI and kill everyone involved. &quot;The Bourne Legacy&quot; received lukewarm reviews but has been Norton&#x27;s highest-grossing venture so far, earning over $276 million worldwide. Norton also produced the comedy-drama &quot;Thanks for Sharing&quot; (2012) under his company Class 5 Films. This production venture received a mixed response. &quot;The Guardian&quot; panned the film as &quot;smug and humourless,&quot; while &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;surprisingly wise, funny and affecting&quot;.
In 2014, Norton played in two Academy Award-winning films, &quot;The Grand Budapest Hotel&quot; and &quot;Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)&quot;. He collaborated again with director Wes Anderson for &quot;The Grand Budapest Hotel&quot;, which featured an ensemble cast and won four Academy Awards. In the black comedy &quot;Birdman&quot;, Norton played Broadway method actor Mike Shiner, who is talented but hard to work with. The film, as well as Norton&#x27;s performance, was well received by critics. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; lauded him for successfully portraying the volatility of the character, and &quot;Newsday&quot; complimented his &quot;truly moving&quot; poetic delivery. The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture and earned Norton his third Academy nomination for Best Supporting Actor.

===2015-2021: Limited roles and voice acting===
Norton had voice-acting roles in the animated features &quot;Sausage Party&quot; (2016) and &quot;The Guardian Brothers&quot;—the English-dubbed version of the Chinese animated film &quot;Little Door Gods&quot; (2017). He played Whit Yardsham, an estranged friend and business partner of Howard Inlet (Will Smith) in the 2016 drama &quot;Collateral Beauty&quot;. The film was panned by critics for its incoherent screenplay. Norton worked again with director Anderson for the 2018 stop motion film &quot;Isle of Dogs&quot;, in which he voiced Rex, a member of a pack of five dogs. Norton had announced in February 2014 that he would direct &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot;, a crime drama based on the acclaimed 1999 novel by Jonathan Lethem. Norton had wanted to work on the project since 1999 but did not begin until Brett Ratner, director of 2002&#x27;s &quot;Red Dragon&quot;, joined in to help production. Released in 2019, the film received mixed reviews. &quot;Toronto Star&quot;&#x27;s Peter Howell praised Norton&#x27;s direction, but thought the film was complex and too long.

===2022-present: Return to mainstream ===
In 2022, Norton portrayed an obnoxious New York tech billionaire Miles Bron in &quot;Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery,&quot; the second installment in &quot;Knives Out franchise&quot;. The ensemble mystery film was released on Netflix to positive reviews and recorded strong viewership. 

Norton featured in the Apple TV+ anthology mini series &quot;Extrapolations&quot; (2023), created by Scott Z. Burns. He once again reunited with Wes Anderson to play a supporting role in the comedy drama set in retrofuturistic 1950s, &quot;Asteroid City&quot;, premiering at the 76th Cannes Film Festival on May 23, 2023. It received generally positive reviews while also becoming a moderate success commercially. He reprised his voice role from the animated adult comedy film &quot;Sausage Party&quot; (2016) in the sequel series &quot;Sausage Party: Foodtopia&quot; (2024), which released on Amazon Prime Video.

Norton next portrayed Pete Seeger opposite Timothée Chalamet in &quot;A Complete Unknown&quot; (2024), a biopic of Bob Dylan, directed by James Mangold. He learned to play banjo in Seeger&#x27;s distinctive style for his role. His performance received praise, and he was nominated for a Golden Globe award and an Academy Award. Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com described him as &quot;wonderfully understated,&quot; while James T. Keane of &quot;America Magazine&quot; praised Norton as the film&#x27;s standout performer, lauding his ability to subtly convey a wide range of emotions: &quot;preternaturally good-hearted, but also part booster, part handler, part jealous rival, part stubborn doctrinaire.&quot;

==Personal life==
=== Relationships ===
Since coming to fame in the mid-1990s, Norton has opted not to discuss his personal life in public, saying that he &quot;believes that excessive media coverage can distract him from fulfilling his role as an actor&quot;. Following the release of &quot;The People vs. Larry Flynt&quot; (1996), tabloids spread rumors that Norton and his onscreen co-star Courtney Love were dating. Norton insisted that he was not romantically involved with Love, and the two were only friends and colleagues. Nevertheless, appearing on an episode of &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot;, Love stated they had dated for four years. It was in addition to her references in a 2006 interview to their past relationship. She said that Norton had been a &quot;mediator&quot; and &quot;communicator&quot; between her and her daughter Frances Bean Cobain, calling him a &quot;force of good&quot;.

After Norton had ended his relationship with Love in 1999, he started dating Salma Hayek, with whom he later appeared in the 2002 biopic &quot;Frida&quot;. Norton absented himself from the premiere of &quot;The Italian Job&quot;, in which he starred, to attend the premiere of &quot;The Maldonado Miracle&quot;, Hayek&#x27;s directorial debut. The two broke up in 2003. Hayek still remains friends with Norton. 

Hayek recalled in a 2017 piece for &quot;The New York Times&quot; that Norton &quot;beautifully rewrote the script [of &quot;Frida&quot;] several times and appallingly never got credit&quot; after she had rejected Harvey Weinstein&#x27;s sexual demands and Weinstein, in retaliation, had given her &quot;a list of [four] impossible tasks with a tight deadline,&quot; including &quot;a rewrite of the script, with no additional payment, or writer&#x27;s credit&quot; before he would make the film. In 2011, Norton proposed to Canadian film producer Shauna Robertson after dating for six years. The pair married in 2012. The couple have two children.

=== Ancestry ===
Norton appeared on the PBS genealogy series &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot; in January 2023, where it was confirmed that Pocahontas was his 12th great-grandmother. Norton, whose family had known of possible relation to Pocahontas and her husband John Rolfe for years, replied to the findings: &quot;It makes you realize what a small piece of the human story you are&quot;. 

Norton expressed discomfort upon learning his ancestors owned a family of slaves: &quot;The short answer is these things are uncomfortable, and you should be uncomfortable with them. Everybody should be uncomfortable with it. It&#x27;s not a judgement on you and your own life, but it&#x27;s a judgement on the history of this country. It needs to be acknowledged first and foremost, and then it needs to be contended with. When you go away from census counts and you personalise things, you&#x27;re talking about, possibly, a husband and wife with five girls – and these girls are slaves. Born into slavery. ... When you read &#x27;slave aged eight,&#x27; you just want to die.&quot;

Norton also learned he is a distant cousin of fellow actors Eric and Julia Roberts.

=== Activism ===
Norton&#x27;s father is an environmental lawyer and conservationist; Norton is an environmentalist. He narrated the four-part National Geographic documentary &quot;Strange Days on Planet Earth&quot; (2005), which examines earth system science. He is an advocate for renewable energy, specifically solar energy and is currently an Advisory Council Member for GoodLeap. After rising to stardom, Norton bought a solar energy-powered home in Los Angeles and switched to a hybrid car. In 2003, he collaborated with oil company BP to develop the Solar Neighbors program, which aimed to install photovoltaic panels on rooftops of households in Los Angeles. The initiative was welcomed by many of Norton&#x27;s fellow celebrities, notably Salma Hayek, Brad Pitt, Danny DeVito, Alicia Silverstone and Robin Williams.

Norton is a supporter of the African Wildlife Foundation and its &quot;Say No&quot; campaign which raises awareness and fights against illegal poaching of elephants and rhinoceroses for ivory and horn. He is the president of the American branch of the Maasai Wilderness Conservation Trust. The organization aims to preserve the ecosystems and biodiversity of East Africa through conservation which directly benefits the local Maasai communities. To raise money for the trust, Norton fielded a team of thirty runners for the New York City Marathon on November 1, 2009; the team included himself, three Maasai tribesmen, and fellow celebrity musician Alanis Morissette. He raised over $1.2 million for the Trust after completing his run.

After the successful fundraising for the Maasai Conservation, Norton launched an online fundraising platform called Crowdrise in May 2010. The website uses a social-networking framework to help raise funds for charity. In July 2010, the then-Secretary-General of the United Nations (UN) named Norton the Goodwill Ambassador for Biodiversity and a spokesperson for the Convention on Biological Diversity. At his designation ceremony, Norton said that biodiversity is an issue that &quot;transcends national boundaries&quot;, with people &quot;having lost sight&quot; of the need for environmental protection. As part of his job as a UN Ambassador, Norton has embarked on trips to Africa and participated in programs organized by UN bodies including the Development and Environment Programmes. He also played soccer (football) for &quot;Soccer Aid&quot; in May 2012; the event raised over £4.9 million for UNICEF to assist children worldwide.

Norton is a general aviation pilot who flies people in need of access to healthcare in his Cessna 206 aircraft through the organization Angel Flight West.

=== Political views ===
Norton has served since 1998 as a member of the board of trustees of Enterprise Community Partners, a non-profit developer of affordable housing founded by his grandparents. The company has invested $9 billion in equity capital, pre-development lending, mortgage financing, and house building for low-income Americans. In 2008, Norton initiated the company&#x27;s plan to embark on green affordable housing. This originated with his concerns over environmental issues and sustainable development in addition to housing problems. He attributed his involvement in community building to his upbringing in Columbia, Maryland, which is a planned city built in the 1960s and home to a diverse population.

Norton believes celebrities should &quot;participate quietly&quot; in discussions on politics and social issues as, &quot;Having a public forum tends to make people offer too casual a commentary&quot;. During the 2004 presidential election, Norton urged college students to vote against the Republican nominee George W. Bush, further criticizing his plans to cut college financing and his support of tax breaks for the rich. He also made speeches to encourage voters to support Democratic nominee John Kerry. Norton was a supporter of Democrat Eliot Spitzer, former New York governor.

During the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, Norton supported but did not actively campaign for the Democratic nominee Barack Obama, saying that &quot;it&#x27;s much more interesting to encourage people to engage than to suggest that people should model themselves on me and my views&quot;. He produced the 2009 documentary &quot;By the People: The Election of Barack Obama&quot;, which chronicles Obama&#x27;s political activities from 2006 to his 2008 election victory. Norton spoke highly of Obama, citing him as &quot;a perfect framework&quot; to explore contemporary U.S. politics. He produced a campaign video for Obama&#x27;s 2012 presidential race with Bennett Miller; the video featured voters from diverse economic and racial backgrounds. He also expressed &quot;grave concerns&quot; over the Trump administration&#x27;s position regarding climate change. In 2020 Norton donated $8,400 to the Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign.

In November 2020, Norton criticized then-US President Donald Trump for his unfounded claims of election fraud at the 2020 United States presidential election, as a &quot;contemptible, treasonous, seditious assault on the stability of the country and its institutions.&quot;

==Public image==

Norton has been regarded as one of the most talented actors of his generation. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; observed that &quot;the tag &#x27;finest actor of his generation&#x27; clings to him wherever he goes&quot;. In &quot;The Observer&quot;, Peter Preston noted that his image was unlike that of conventional screen &quot;stars&quot; because his most memorable characters are unlikeable, specifically a neo-Nazi in &quot;American History X&quot;. Preston likened his characters to those played by Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro, whom Norton admires. &quot;Interview&quot; magazine commented that Norton has successfully portrayed a wide range of roles and found it impossible to simply characterize him as a leading man, a villain, or a character actor.

Despite critical plaudits, Norton is scornful of being seen as a Hollywood A-lister. He feels it necessary to keep his off-screen life to himself and opts for a &quot;normal life.&quot; As soon as his career took off in the late 1990s, Norton asserted that, &quot;If I ever have to stop taking the subway, I&#x27;m gonna have a heart attack.&quot; AllMovie remarked that Norton attained &quot;almost instant stardom&quot; following his 1996 film debut in &quot;Primal Fear&quot; and could have risen to even greater fame. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; attributed Norton&#x27;s lack of interest in celebrity status to his family of &quot;distinguished political and social activists.&quot; Sharing the same sentiment, &quot;Forbes&quot; complimented Norton as &quot;a far cry&quot; from celebrities who do charity works &quot;with a keen eye to furthering their personal brand,&quot; citing his involvements in community planning and social entrepreneurship even before his film career.

Norton has a strict work ethic and a high desire for professionalism. He is selective in choosing his roles, explaining that, &quot;You don&#x27;t want to do anything just ... to work with somebody. There are many actors I would like to work with but it has to be the right role.&quot; Drew Barrymore, his co-star in the 1996 musical &quot;Everyone Says I Love You&quot;, recalled that he was &quot;on the set every day&quot; and &quot;never compromised for a second.&quot; He also expects different approaches to projects with different collaborators and wishes for &quot;happy&quot; working situations as long as &quot;the boundaries of the collaboration are well-established in the beginning.&quot;

Due to this, Norton has garnered a reputation for being difficult to work with. Incidents include Norton&#x27;s editing the final cut of &quot;American History X&quot; (1998), which is 40 minutes longer than director Tony Kaye&#x27;s version; conflicts with director Brett Ratner on the set of &quot;Red Dragon&quot; (2002); refusing to promote &quot;The Italian Job&quot; (2003); and uncredited rewriting of the screenplay for &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; (2008), which angered screenwriter Zak Penn. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; opined that these incidents led to Norton&#x27;s image as a &quot;prickly perfectionist&quot;, which diminishes his reputation. Nevertheless, a few collaborators with whom Norton had disputes have expressed their respect for him: Kaye wanted to feature Norton in some of his other ventures, and Ratner offered to help with production of Norton&#x27;s film &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot; and got along well with Norton. Some publications interpreted Norton&#x27;s performance in &quot;Birdman&quot; (2014), in which he portrays a talented but volatile actor, as a self-referential nod to his image.

== Acting credits and accolades ==
According to the review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, Norton&#x27;s most critically acclaimed films are &quot;Primal Fear&quot; (1996), &quot;The People vs. Larry Flynt&quot; (1996), &quot;Everyone Says I Love You&quot; (1996), &quot;American History X&quot; (1998), &quot;Fight Club&quot; (1999), &quot;The Score&quot; (2001), &quot;Frida&quot; (2002), &quot;25th Hour&quot; (2002), &quot;The Illusionist&quot; (2006), &quot;The Painted Veil&quot; (2006), &quot;Moonrise Kingdom&quot; (2012), &quot;The Grand Budapest Hotel&quot; (2014), &quot;Birdman&quot; (2014), &quot;Sausage Party&quot; (2016) and &quot;Isle of Dogs&quot; (2018). His biggest commercial successes are &quot;Red Dragon&quot; (2002), &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot; (2005), &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; (2008), and &quot;The Bourne Legacy&quot; (2012), all of which grossed over $200 million worldwide.

Norton has been nominated for four Academy Awards: Best Supporting Actor for &quot;Primal Fear&quot;, &quot;Birdman&quot; and &quot;A Complete Unknown&quot;, and Best Actor for &quot;American History X&quot;. He also has two Golden Globe nominations for Best Supporting Actor for &quot;Primal Fear&quot; and &quot;Birdman&quot;, winning for the former.

<doc id="159479" wikidata="Q1381972" url="?curid=159479" title="Everclear (band)">
<text>Everclear is an American rock band formed in Portland, Oregon, in 1991. The band was formed by Art Alexakis, the band&#x27;s lead songwriter, vocalist, and guitarist, and for most of the band&#x27;s height of popularity, consisted of Craig Montoya on bass guitar and Greg Eklund on drums. After the limited release of their independently released debut album, &quot;World of Noise&quot;, the band found success with their first three albums on Capitol Records: &quot;Sparkle and Fade&quot;, &quot;So Much for the Afterglow&quot;, and &quot;Songs from an American Movie Vol. One: Learning How to Smile&quot;, which were all certified platinum in sales. However, the following two albums &quot;Songs from an American Movie Vol. Two: Good Time for a Bad Attitude&quot; and &quot;Slow Motion Daydream&quot;, were not as well received, and as sales suffered, Montoya and Eklund left the band shortly after in 2003.

After a brief stint of solo performances, Alexakis decided to push forward with the Everclear name, finding new musicians with which to perform and releasing two more albums, &quot;Welcome to the Drama Club&quot; and &quot;Invisible Stars&quot;. In 2012, Alexakis started a 1990s nostalgia tour, named the Summerland Tour, which occurs every summer with Everclear and other 1990s alternative rock bands. In April 2015, the band released a ninth studio album, entitled &quot;Black is the New Black&quot;. A live album, &quot;Live At The Whisky A Go Go&quot;, was released on September 8, 2023 via Sunset Blvd Records.

==History==
===Formation and &quot;World of Noise&quot; (1992–1993)===
Art Alexakis suffered through a troubled youth, beginning with his father walking out when Alexakis was a child. Financial hardships pushed his family into the slums of Los Angeles, where Alexakis became a heavy drug user. During his teenage years, Alexakis was shuttled around the country between various family members (including a brief period in Houston living with his father&#x27;s new family), but the drug addiction persisted. Eventually Alexakis suffered a near-fatal cocaine overdose, which finally pushed him to clean up. In the late 1980s, Alexakis played in a short-lived rock band in Los Angeles called Shakin&#x27; Brave, where he began to hone his songwriting skills. Frustrated by the inattention of the L.A. music scene, Art relocated to San Francisco where he fell into the then-burgeoning cowpunk scene.

Alexakis founded Shindig Records, a label that represented San Francisco&#x27;s cowpunk scene. He began recording material of his own for a solo album, but it ended up evolving into a group project called Colorfinger. Alexakis wrote under the pseudonym &quot;A.D. Nation&quot; while writing/recording with Colorfinger. While involved with Colorfinger, he wrote several songs that would later find success as Everclear songs, including &quot;The Twistinside&quot;, &quot;Heartspark Dollarsign&quot;, and &quot;Why I Don&#x27;t Believe in God&quot;.

In a single month in 1992, Shindig failed (when its distributor went bankrupt), Colorfinger broke up, and Alexakis learned that his girlfriend was pregnant. Seeking a change of location, Alexakis and his girlfriend moved to her hometown, Portland, Oregon. There, he placed an ad in local music weekly &quot;The Rocket&quot;, which earned two responses: bass player Craig Montoya and drummer Scott Cuthbert. The name Everclear was chosen as a reference to the infamous grain alcohol. In an interview with The Discovering Alcoholic, Alexakis called it &quot;pure, white evil&quot; for the perception that it looks harmless but is very strong alcohol. The new band began recording in a friend&#x27;s basement, essentially bartering for recording time with musical gear and whatever limited funds they could scrounge up. The sessions culminated in two releases: the &quot;Nervous &amp; Weird&quot; EP and the band&#x27;s first full-length release &quot;World of Noise&quot;, both released by Portland&#x27;s Tim/Kerr Records in 1993. Frustrated by Tim/Kerr&#x27;s limited resources, Alexakis hired independent promoters to help push the album.

===Mainstream success (1994–2001)===
====&quot;Sparkle and Fade&quot; (1994–1995)====
The band spent much of 1994 seeking out a major label deal. After a modest bidding war, they were signed to Capitol Records by Gary Gersh, who was responsible for signing Nirvana, Sonic Youth, and Counting Crows to DGC Records. Just before their signing, Everclear parted ways with drummer Cuthbert, citing personality conflicts, and brought in former Jollymon drummer Greg Eklund. In May 1995, the band released their first album for the label, &quot;Sparkle and Fade&quot;.

The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Heroin Girl&quot;, received some modest airplay via MTV&#x27;s &quot;120 Minutes&quot;, but was generally missed by the mainstream. However, near the end of 1995, the second single &quot;Santa Monica&quot; found a strong audience via the burgeoning alternative radio format, which eventually carried over to mainstream success. The album subsequently was certified platinum. However, two ensuing singles, &quot;Heartspark Dollarsign&quot; and &quot;You Make Me Feel Like a Whore&quot;, failed to find a wide audience, and the band ended 1996 fast at work on their second major label full-length album.

As &quot;Sparkle and Fade&quot; reached its audience, Everclear had to endure consistent comparisons to Nirvana, particularly given the album&#x27;s subject matter and drug references. Following a show with the Foo Fighters at the end of 1995, Dave Grohl told MTV News that he did not think that Everclear sounded like Nirvana, noting that Bush sounded more like Nirvana than any other band.

====&quot;So Much for the Afterglow&quot; (1996–1999)====
By the end of 1996, the band had nearly completed the album, which they planned to release under the title &quot;Pure White Evil&quot;. Alexakis, however, was dissatisfied with the results and decided to work on more songs for the effort, including &quot;One Hit Wonder&quot; and the eventual title-track to the album, &quot;So Much for the Afterglow&quot;. The songs &quot;The Swing&quot; and &quot;Otis Redding&quot; were cut from the Pure White Evil Sessions and were not included on &quot;So Much for the Afterglow&quot;. Eventually they were released: the former on the soundtrack album for &quot;Scream 2&quot; and the latter on &quot;Songs from an American Movie Vol. One: Learning How to Smile&quot;. &quot;So Much for the Afterglow&quot; was released in October 1997. The first two singles from the album, &quot;Everything to Everyone&quot; and &quot;I Will Buy You a New Life&quot;, performed modestly, but helped to begin a slow build for the album, while &quot;Local God&quot; was featured in Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot; in 1996 as well as on the soundtrack. The band completed a US tour at the end of the year and started 1998 with a tour of Australia.

The Australian tour, however, was an unexpected disaster. At a show in Wollongong someone threw a shoe at Alexakis, knocking loose a few of his teeth. Two nights later in Melbourne, someone threw a lit explosive on stage, which exploded and burned a stagehand. Tensions erupted backstage, with touring guitarist Steve Birch refusing to continue, and Montoya getting into a heated argument with Alexakis. In interviews for VH-1&#x27;s Behind the Music, the band related that they nearly broke up that night. The band decided to cancel the remainder of their tour following a final show on the Gold Coast, during which Alexakis was hit with a shoe (while the crowd was singing him &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;) and Montoya&#x27;s acoustic bass guitar was stolen. Montoya declined to join the band for the ensuing tour of the United Kingdom, with then-bass-tech David LoPrinzi filling in. Everclear did not return to Australia until 2012.

Following an extensive tour of the United States with Marcy Playground and Fastball, the band released &quot;Afterglow&quot;&#x27;s third single, &quot;Father of Mine&quot;. The song catapulted the album and the band to mainstream success.

&quot;Afterglow&quot; provided the band their only Grammy Award nomination to date, a Best Rock Instrumental nod in 1998 for &quot;El Distorto de Melodica&quot;. Later that year, the band won Billboard&#x27;s Modern Rock Band of the Year Award. Though &quot;Afterglow&quot; never charted higher than No. 33 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart, the album reached double-platinum status at the end of the year.

====&quot;Songs from an American Movie Vol. One&quot; and &quot;Vol. Two&quot; (2000–2001)====
Following the success of &quot;So Much for the Afterglow&quot;, Alexakis decided to step back from the Everclear sound and record a solo album of more pop-influenced songs, and brought in Everclear touring musicians David LoPrinzi, Brian Lehfeldt, and James Beaton to perform on the recordings. Unhappy with the results of the initial sessions, Alexakis decided to bring in Montoya and Eklund and transform the effort into an Everclear album. The results were released as &quot;Songs from an American Movie Vol. One: Learning How to Smile&quot; in July 2000. The album yielded the band&#x27;s most successful single, &quot;Wonderful&quot;, and eventually reached platinum status. The song &quot;Wonderful&quot; was also notably used as the graduation song for the Columbine High School class of 2000, who the year before suffered from the Columbine High School massacre.

Rather than tour for the release, the band arranged with their label to release a second album in 2000. Alexakis believed he had enough of a catalog of unreleased songs at the ready, and was eager to show the opposing sides of Everclear&#x27;s sound. However, delays in the mixing process of &quot;Learning How to Smile&quot; had pushed its initial April release to July, limiting the amount of recording time for the follow-up in order to meet Capitol&#x27;s demands of an end-of-the-year release.

Proclaimed as a &quot;return to rock&quot;, &quot;Songs from an American Movie Vol. Two: Good Time for a Bad Attitude&quot; was released just four months after &quot;Vol. One&quot; in November 2000. Unfortunately, the promotional push for &quot;Vol. Two&quot; while still in the throes of supporting &quot;Vol. One&quot; confused much of the music-buying public. &quot;Learning How to Smile&quot;&#x27;s second single &quot;AM Radio&quot; was released barely weeks before the release of &quot;Vol. Two&quot;, leaving some stores to mistakenly label the song as the first single from &quot;Vol. Two&quot;. The confusion was amplified by the band&#x27;s decision to accept an opening slot for Matchbox 20 in the months after the release of &quot;Vol. Two&quot;, a somewhat awkward billing for a band who was trying to support a hard rock album.

By the late spring of 2001, both albums had stalled. Capitol attempted a final push by re-releasing &quot;Learning How to Smile&quot; with &quot;Out of My Depth&quot; and &quot;Rock Star&quot; from &quot;Good Time for a Bad Attitude&quot; as bonus tracks. A cover of Van Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; received some modest airplay as a result, but couldn&#x27;t help revive the momentum. A tour of the United Kingdom for what would have been the band&#x27;s first extensive tour out of the country since 1998 was cancelled shortly before its start.

That summer, the band decided to license the song &quot;Rock Star&quot; to the movie of the same name.

===&quot;Slow Motion Daydream&quot; (2002–2003)===
The band regrouped a year later to record their sixth album, &quot;Slow Motion Daydream&quot;, released in March 2003. Prior to its release, Alexakis and Capitol came to odds over the album&#x27;s first single. Capitol was thrilled about one of the last songs added to the album, a somewhat 9/11-influenced &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Alexakis, however, had previewed a tongue-in-cheek ode to suburbanite housewives, &quot;Volvo Driving Soccer Mom&quot;, during a solo tour in 2002, and had received a fair amount of media attention. Capitol eventually relented to Alexakis&#x27;s demands and released the song and video, but did not put much effort into the song and album&#x27;s promotion. &quot;The New York Times&quot; was released shortly thereafter as the second single with even less support from the label, and the album stalled after selling 100,000 copies.

At the end of the tour support for &quot;Slow Motion Daydream&quot; in August 2003, Montoya and Eklund decided that it was time to move on, and departed the band to pursue other interests. The following summer, Everclear ended its relationship with Capitol Records. Capitol compiled a Greatest Hits album reflecting the band&#x27;s tenure at the label, titled &quot;Ten Years Gone: The Best of Everclear 1994-2004&quot;, which was released in October 2004.

===Line-up changes and &quot;Welcome to the Drama Club&quot; (2004–2009)===
After a solo tour in the fall of 2003, Alexakis decided to continue with Everclear, organizing a new band that made its debut in March 2004. The new lineup consisted of bassist Sam Hudson, guitarist Dave &quot;Davey&quot; French, and drummer Eric Bretl. In the summer of 2004, the band added keyboardist Josh Crawley, and swapped Bretl for former Everclear drum tech Brett Snyder. The new lineup released its first recording, a cover of Woody Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;This Land Is Your Land&quot;, that summer. Alexakis, an Oregon delegate, performed the song (as well as &quot;Everything to Everyone&quot;) with an acoustic guitar during a CNN interview at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. A self-released EP of performances recorded for XM Satellite Radio called &quot;Closure&quot; was given out at shows in the fall of 2004.

Free of a major label, Alexakis spent the ensuing year and a half slowly recording material for a new Everclear release. He admitted that the time after the breakup of the original lineup served as a &quot;wake up call&quot;, during which he suffered his third divorce and filed for bankruptcy and did not retain sole custody of his family pet, a dog named Scooby. The new lineup was signed to Eleven Seven Music. Everclear released &quot;Welcome to the Drama Club&quot; on September 12, 2006, the title being in honor of their affection for the stage. Two singles were released from the album, &quot;Hater&quot; and &quot;Glorious&quot;.

In January 2008, Alexakis posted on the band&#x27;s Myspace that they were working on a covers album, and a new album, which was expected to be released in 2008. In addition, two unreleased songs from the &quot;Drama Club&quot; sessions, &quot;Downtime&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Darkness&quot;, were posted.

The Vegas Years, a collection of cover songs was released April 15, 2008 by Capitol Records. It contained a mix of newly recorded, previously released, live, and remixed older covers. To celebrate the release, Art and the band hosted a live video chat. They confirmed they would be touring in the summer of 2008 including a possible UK tour in autumn. They also announced a series of singles to be released for download online in the summer.

In August 2008 former Godsmack and Fuel drummer Tommy Stewart replaced Brett Snyder on drums. While guest hosting on Sirius radio station 24, Lithium, Art Alexakis debuted &quot;Jesus Was a Democrat&quot;.

In November 2008 the band traveled around Iraq in support of the troops and the USO. They stopped at Camp Liberty, Camp Shield and Camp Slayer, FOB Echo and many other FOBs around the country. The sets were primarily done acoustically and consisted of most of the band&#x27;s hits. In March 2009, Art Alexakis went on a solo acoustic tour, playing Hard Rock Cafes around the US. The tour was a benefit for the Musicians on Call charity.

On October 6, 2009, the band released &quot;In a Different Light&quot;, a collection of re-recordings of old Everclear songs in a more acoustic fashion. The collection also featured two new Everclear songs, &quot;Here Comes the Darkness&quot;, which was actually a leftover track from &quot;Welcome to the Drama Club&quot;, and &quot;At the End of the Day&quot;, which Alexakis had written and performed with Marion Raven.

On September 13, 2009, Alexakis posted a blog on Myspace that all of the current members had left the band, and were replaced by all new musicians, including Freddy Herrera who was the bassist of The Exies, who had previously toured with Everclear. This new version of Everclear toured for two months in support of &quot;In a Different Light&quot;.

In another Myspace post on December 28, 2009, Alexakis announced that former Everclear guitarist Davey French had returned, and Johnny Hawthorn was exiting the band. In the same blog, Alexakis said the band would be recording the next album in March and April 2010, for a 2011 release.

=== &quot;Return to Santa Monica&quot;, &quot;Invisible Stars&quot;, 1990s nostalgia touring and &quot;Black Is the New Black&quot; (2010–present) ===
The band entered the studio in 2011 to begin work on both a new forthcoming studio album and to record an album of cover songs and new versions of past hits. The album entitled &quot;Return to Santa Monica&quot; was released on September 27, 2011. The band released &quot;Extended Versions&quot; on August 16, 2011, which contained 10 live songs recorded on October 15, 2010, in Seattle, WA at the Historic Columbia City Theatre. On May 7, 2011, Alexakis announced on the band&#x27;s Twitter page that keyboardist Josh Crawley had rejoined the band. Crawley left again in 2016.

In June 2012, Everclear released their first album of new material in six years, entitled &quot;Invisible Stars&quot;. In support of the album, Alexakis announced the Summerland Tour, a &#x27;90s nostalgia tour featuring Everclear themselves, Sugar Ray, Lit, Marcy Playground, and the Gin Blossoms. In 2013 the Summerland Tour returned, this time consisting of Everclear, Live, Filter, and Sponge. Everclear announced Summerland 2014 consisting of Everclear, Eve 6, Soul Asylum, and Spacehog. During the 2014 Summerland tour, Everclear announced a forthcoming album release, and included in their set lists for the tour a new song to be on the new album. The resulting album, &quot;Black is the New Black&quot;, was released in April 2015.

They have not released an album since then, but still continue to tour with bands such as Marcy Playground and Stone Temple Pilots.

A live album was recorded at the Whisky a Go Go on December 1, 2022, commemorating the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary. The album, &quot;Live At The Whisky A Go Go&quot;, was released on September 8, 2023 via Sunset Blvd Records.

==Musical style and influences==

Everclear has been described under multiple genres, predominantly alternative rock, and power pop, but also post-grunge, grunge-punk, grunge, and pop rock. &quot;Sparkle and Fade&quot; was predominantly alternative rock, but with occasional songs that were instead considered punk rock and grunge. &quot;So Much for the Afterglow&quot; featured a more experimental sound, moving further away from grunge-inspired music and more to a power pop sound. Alexakis said of the grunge label: 

Everclear is influenced by the Beach Boys, the Beatles, Public Enemy, X, the Replacements, the Pixies, Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, Elvis Costello, and Green Day.

<text>Melvins (sometimes the Melvins) are an American rock band formed in 1983 in Montesano, Washington. Their early work was key to the development of both grunge and sludge metal. Primarily a trio, they have also performed as a quartet, with either two drummers or two bassists. Since 1984, vocalist and guitarist Buzz Osborne and drummer Dale Crover have been constant members.

==History==

===Early years (1983–1987)===
The Melvins were formed in early 1983 by Buzz Osborne (guitar, vocals), Matt Lukin (bass), and Mike Dillard (drums) who all went to Montesano Jr./Sr. High School in Montesano, Washington. The band was named after a supervisor at a Thriftway in Montesano, where Osborne also worked as a clerk; &quot;Melvin&quot; was disliked by other employees, and the band&#x27;s members felt it to be an appropriately ridiculous name.

In the beginning, they played Jimi Hendrix and Who covers, and also began playing fast hardcore punk. Dillard left the band in 1984 and was replaced by local drummer Dale Crover. The band&#x27;s rehearsals moved to a back room of Crover&#x27;s parents&#x27; house in Aberdeen, Washington. Soon afterward, they started to play songs slower and &quot;heavier&quot; than nearly anyone else at the time. In 1985, C/Z Records was created to document the Washington music scene. The label released &quot;Deep Six&quot;, featuring four songs by the Melvins. In 1986, the band released their debut, the &quot;Six Songs&quot; EP, on C/Z Records (later releases expanded and retitled this as &quot;8 Songs&quot;, &quot;10 Songs&quot;, and eventually &quot;26 Songs&quot; in 2003 on Ipecac Recordings). The album was recorded live to a two track at the now closed Ironwood Studio in Seattle on February 8, 1986.

In October 1986, they recorded their first full-length album, &quot;Gluey Porch Treatments&quot;, at Studio D in Sausalito, California. The album was released in 1987 on Alchemy Records. &quot;Gluey Porch Treatments&quot; was later coupled with their second album &quot;Ozma&quot; for the Boner Records CD release. It was expanded again for the 1999 re-release on Ipecac with some garage demos.

===Boner Records era (1988–1992)===
Crover played drums with Nirvana (billed as &quot;Ted Ed Fred&quot;) when they recorded a ten-song demo on January 23, 1988, in Seattle, which later formed part of their debut LP &quot;Bleach&quot;, and played a live show in Tacoma later that day. Osborne would later introduce Kurt Cobain and Krist Novoselic to Dave Grohl. Later that year Osborne and Crover relocated to San Francisco, California. Lukin stayed and formed the band Mudhoney. Lori &quot;Lorax&quot; Black (daughter of Shirley Temple) replaced Lukin on bass. The band recorded &quot;Ozma&quot; in May 1989, and released it later that year. The album was produced by Mark Deutrom, who later joined the band on bass.

In 1990, the band recorded &quot;Bullhead&quot;, which marked a slower, more drone music style for the band. The band then toured Europe; their show of January 23, 1991 in Alzey, Germany was released by Your Choice Records as &quot;Your Choice Live Series Vol.12&quot;. When they returned to the U.S., they recorded the &quot;Eggnog&quot; EP, which was released the same year on Boner Records.

Lorax left the band, and was replaced by Joe Preston. Preston appears on the &quot;Salad of a Thousand Delights&quot; (1992, Box Dog Video). Melvins then released three &quot;solo&quot; EPs, following the concept and imitating the cover artwork inspired by the four Kiss members&#x27; solo albums released in 1978. &quot;King Buzzo&quot;, &quot;Dale Crover&quot;, and &quot;Joe Preston&quot; were all released in 1992 on Boner Records. Later in 1992, they released the full-length album, &quot;Lysol&quot;, which had to be renamed &quot;Melvins&quot; because Lysol was a trademarked name. Preston departed from the band, and Lorax briefly rejoined.

===Atlantic Records era (1993–1997)===
When Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Nevermind&quot; became a massive and unexpected success, Melvins were one of many groups to benefit from Nirvana&#x27;s support. Melvins were signed by Atlantic Records, and its first major label release, 1993&#x27;s &quot;Houdini&quot;, entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers chart at 29. Mark Deutrom replaced Lorax on bass shortly after the album&#x27;s release.

Melvins released its second album for Atlantic in 1994, &quot;Stoner Witch&quot;. Due to its experimental nature, Melvins took its next album, &quot;Prick&quot;, to Amphetamine Reptile Records. Record label conflicts prevented the band from releasing any records under the name &quot;Melvins&quot;, so the album was released with the band name written in mirror. The band returned to Atlantic one last time for 1996&#x27;s &quot;Stag&quot;, which entered the Heatseekers chart at number 33. Melvins were dropped by Atlantic Records in 1997 after three albums.

===Switching labels and continued experimentation (1997–2004)===
The band signed with Amphetamine Reptile Records and released their next full-length album, &quot;Honky&quot;, in 1997. They recorded an August 1997 concert in Richmond, Melbourne, Australia as &quot;Alive at the Fucker Club&quot; in 1998. The same year, Melvins opened for Tool. (A picture on the Tool website depicts the Melvins along with the words &quot;Melvins say...Tool Sux!&quot; spelled out in lunch meat. The photo was taken while on tour with Tool in 2002 in Australia.) In 1998, Melvins played the second stage at Ozzfest.

1999 saw the beginning of a partnership with Mike Patton&#x27;s Ipecac Recordings, which began remastering and reissuing much of the band&#x27;s back catalog. The band also released three full-length albums dubbed (and later packaged together as) &quot;The Trilogy&quot;: &quot;The Maggot&quot;, &quot;The Bootlicker&quot;, and &quot;The Crybaby&quot;. The latter featured a number of guest vocalists and musicians. Kevin Rutmanis, formerly of The Cows, was bassist during this era.

In 2001, the band returned to their experimental tendencies for &quot;Colossus of Destiny&quot;, a live set of synthesizer and sampler experiments presented as two tracks (one clocking in at 59:23 and the other at five seconds). The album was described approvingly by one critic as &quot;more like avant-garde electro-acoustic than anything else.&quot;

In 2002, Ipecac Recordings released Hostile Ambient Takeover, a record that was not in fact ambient music at all. Metal Archives said: &quot;Overall, this album is charged with brilliance and it deserves a place in every collection. &quot;. This album is also notable as it is the first instance of Melvins working with long time producer and engineer Toshi Kasai.

In 2003, Atlantic Records (UK) released &quot;Melvinmania: The Best of the Atlantic Years 1993–1996&quot;, a compilation of recycled tracks from the band&#x27;s three major label releases. This release was unsanctioned by the band who had no input into the track selection or (occasionally inaccurate) liner notes.

In 2004, Osborne and Crover toured to celebrate their 20th anniversary as a band, and also released an art book &quot;Neither Here Nor There&quot;. The book is a collection of art by creators of their cover art as well as friends of the band, and also contained retrospectives on the past twenty years of the Melvins. The book included a CD with selected tracks from their albums.

===Later period and collaboration albums (2004–2010)===

In 2004, Melvins collaborated with ambient artist Lustmord for &quot;Pigs of the Roman Empire&quot; and with Dead Kennedys singer Jello Biafra for &quot;Never Breathe What You Can&#x27;t See&quot; and &quot;Sieg Howdy!&quot; released in 2004 and 2005 respectively. &quot;Never Breathe What You Can&#x27;t See&quot; was supported by a mini-tour with Jello Biafra and Adam Jones from Tool. A planned European tour was canceled in early October 2004 reportedly due to unknown complications involving Rutmanis. Following the tour cancellation, Melvins finished the year playing a few shows with David Scott Stone supporting the work of filmmaker Cameron Jamie in Europe and the United States.

When asked about Rutmanis and the canceled portion of the tour. Osborne and Crover stated that Rutmanis had &quot;disappeared&quot;. Fans feared that Rutmanis had departed like so many bassists before him; however, Rutmanis returned temporarily in early 2005. In June 2005, Rutmanis officially left the band. When Melvins toured with Jello Biafra in October and November 2005, David Scott Stone filled in on bass for both sets. David Scott Stone did not leave the live lineup on good terms, waiting until 9 days before a tour to back out and saying in an interview: &quot;It was unprofessional and a betrayal of a friendship,&quot; 

In early 2006, Crover confirmed rumors of both members of the bass-drums duo Big Business joining the Melvins. Commenting on adding another drummer, Crover said this about Big Business drummer Coady Willis: &quot;He&#x27;s left-handed, so we want to do this &#x27;mirror image&#x27; type of thing. We&#x27;ve kind of fused our two drum sets together, and we&#x27;re going to try and do some crazy thing with it. We&#x27;re sharing these big toms in between us.&quot;

The band toured the U.S. in the fall of 2006 in support of their album, &quot;(A) Senile Animal&quot;. The Melvins also toured briefly the United Kingdom in mid-December 2006. Two new songs entitled &quot;Suicide in Progress&quot; and &quot;Billy Fish&quot; were played during the 2007 tour, and appear on their next album &quot;Nude With Boots&quot;.

On June 16 and 17, 2008, a lineup of Osborne, original drummer Mike Dillard, and Dale Crover (playing bass) played two shows at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco in honor of Jello Biafra&#x27;s 50th birthday. Both sets were composed of songs from The Mangled Demos, a collection of early material released on the Alternative Tentacles record label in 2005.

In July 2008, their new album entitled &quot;Nude with Boots&quot; was released. In December 2008, along with Mike Patton, the Melvins co-curated an edition of the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties Nightmare Before Christmas festival. They chose half of the lineup and also performed themselves.

The long rumored (since 2003) remix CD &quot;Chicken Switch&quot; was released on September 29, 2009, via Ipecac Recordings. Unlike usual remix CDs where the remixer is given a single track to work with, for &quot;Chicken Switch&quot; each remixer was given a full album to work with and pull from to create their track. Melvins joined with New Orleans&#x27; super group Down and Weedeater for a North American tour in the summer and fall of 2009. Melvins released their follow up to &quot;Nude with Boots&quot;, entitled &quot;The Bride Screamed Murder&quot;, on June 1, 2010.

===Melvins Lite, reunion with Mike Dillard and more albums (2011–present)===

Melvins started 2011 with a series of unique shows. Four of the shows were every Friday at Spaceland in California. January 7 featured the current line-up playing &quot;Colossus of Destiny&quot;, &quot;Lysol&quot;, and &quot;Eggnog&quot;. Jan 14 featured a Melvins 1983 set followed by the band playing &quot;Houdini&quot;. Jan 21 featured a two-piece Melvins set followed by the current lineup playing &quot;Bullhead&quot;. Jan 28 featured the band playing a normal set followed by &quot;Stoner Witch&quot;.

In early 2011 the band was on tour first in Christchurch, New Zealand at the time of the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake then in Tokyo, Japan at the time of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. Melvins supported Slayer at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties &#x27;I&#x27;ll Be Your Mirror&#x27; festival at Alexandra Palace, London in May 2012. Melvins formed a lineup called Melvins Lite (Buzz, Dale, and Trevor Dunn) that toured through parts of 2011. This line-up released an album, &quot;Freak Puke&quot;, in June 2012 on Ipecac Recordings. The main four-piece lineup remains active as well and released a digital EP, &quot;The Bulls &amp; the Bees&quot;, in March on Scion a/v.

In 2012, Melvins Lite completed a record-breaking tour, having performed every night for 51 straight days, once in each of the 50 United States and once in the District of Columbia. The tour started on September 5 in Anchorage, Alaska and ended in Honolulu, Hawaii on October 25, 2012.

&quot;Everybody Loves Sausages&quot;, an album of cover songs performed with special guests, was released by Ipecac on April 30, 2013.

In 2013, Melvins marked 30 years as a band with an extensive summer tour supported by Honky, Die Kreuzen and Negative Approach. Grunge pioneers Mudhoney also joined the band for two shows on the 30th anniversary tour. Rutmanis reconciled with his former bandmates, appearing on the 2013 album, &quot;Everybody Loves Sausages&quot; and a 2014 7&quot; single.

Melvins were featured on the 2013, Joyful Noise Recordings flexi-series. On August 5, 2013, Melvins announced a new album, &quot;Tres Cabrones&quot;, featuring the &quot;Melvins 1983&quot; lineup with Osborne and Crover joined by the band&#x27;s original drummer, Mike Dillard. Crover replaced Dillard in 1984 and plays bass on the album. &quot;Tres Cabrones&quot; was released on November 5, 2013, on the band&#x27;s longtime label Ipecac.

Jeff Pinkus had aided the band in 2013 as a touring bassist, filling in for current member Jared Warren who was on paternity leave. Afterward Pinkus joined the Melvins full time to begin a collaboration with fellow Butthole Surfers guitarist Paul Leary. The collaborative album &quot;Hold It In&quot; was released in October 2014. The lineup for this album was Osborne and Crover joined by Paul Leary and Jeff Pinkus of the Butthole Surfers.

A collaboration with godheadSilo&#x27;s Mike Kunka, &quot;Three Men and a Baby&quot;, was released in April 2016 through Sub Pop. The album, started in 1999 and shelved, was recently finished. Another album, &quot;Basses Loaded&quot;, was released in June 2016, which features a rotating cast of bass players including regulars Dale Crover, Jared Warren, Jeff Pinkus and Trevor Dunn as well as Steven McDonald (of Redd Kross), and Krist Novoselic (of Nirvana).

In July 2017, the band released the double album &quot;A Walk with Love &amp; Death&quot;. One of the discs, &quot;Love&quot;, is a 14-song soundtrack to a short film of the same name, by Jesse Nieminen. The other disc, &quot;Death&quot;, is made up of standard Melvins songs.

The band released &quot;Pinkus Abortion Technician&quot; in April 2018. The album features dual bassists, Melvins&#x27; regular bass player Steven McDonald as well as Butthole Surfers&#x27; Jeff Pinkus. The title of the album resembles the Butthole Surfers album &quot;Locust Abortion Technician&quot;, and the album features a cover of the Butthole Surfers tune &quot;Graveyard&quot;.

Melvins&#x27; 24th studio album, &quot;Working with God&quot;, was released on February 26, 2021, and once again includes the 1983 lineup of Osborne, Crover and Dillard reunited.

On July 21, 2021, it was announced that Melvins&#x27; would release a 36-song acoustic double album titled &quot;Five Legged Dog&quot; later in the year, featuring acoustic versions of songs spanning their career.

Also in 2021, Melvins were featured in the 25th anniversary of TapeOp with a feature interview.

On August 21, 2022, the Melvins surprise released their 26th studio album, titled &quot;Bad Mood Rising&quot;. The record was not announced beforehand and there were no singles, it just showed up on vinyl. The album arrived on streaming services on 30 September. 

In August 2023, it was announced that former second drummer Coady Willis would be returning to the band for their 2023 US Tour, filling in for Crover as he undergoes spinal surgery.

Melvins announced their 27th album, titled &quot;Tarantula Heart&quot;, on February 6, 2024, with a release date of April 19. The lead single &quot;Working the Ditch&quot; was released that same day. The second single &quot;Allergic to Food&quot; was released on March 20.

In November 2024, Melvins announced a co-headlining spring 2025 US tour with Napalm Death, as a successor/sequel to their 2016 Savage Imperial Death March Tour. This will also be their first tour since 2016 to feature both Dale Crover and Coady Willis on drums, as Crover had to sit out their previous tour due to spinal surgery. Support includes Napalm Death bassist Shane Embury&#x27;s side project Dark Sky Burial on all dates, as well as support from Weedeater, Titan To Tachyons, and Hard-Ons on select dates. 

On February 17, 2025, Melvins released the lead single &quot;Victory of the Pyramids&quot; from an upcoming album, &quot;Thunderball&quot;, set to release April 18. 

==Musical style and influences==
Variously described as a sludge metal, grunge, experimental rock, alternative metal, and alternative rock band, the Melvins explored a variety of different styles throughout their career, including noise rock, stoner rock, doom metal, dark ambient, noise, jazz-rock, avant-garde music, electroacoustic music, and punk country. Initially starting out as a hardcore punk act, their sound eventually started to incorporate such influences as Flipper, Black Flag, Gang of Four, David Bowie, Roxy Music, the Fugs, Swans, Public Image Ltd, Venom, Miles Davis, and the Who.

Since the 1990s, the band has occasionally touched on electronic music, as on &quot;Prick&quot; (1994), &quot;Colossus of Destiny&quot; (1998), &quot;Pigs of the Roman Empire&quot; (2004) – the latter a collaboration with dark ambient pioneer Lustmord, and &quot;Throbbing Jazz Gristle Funk Hits&quot; (2023). Though the band are often compared to Black Sabbath, Buzzo has stated that his guitar playing is more influenced by Black Flag.

==Legacy==
Melvins&#x27; sludgy sound was an influence on grunge music, including bands such as Nirvana, Soundgarden, Green River, and many other bands from Seattle. They have also influenced artists outside the grunge scene, including Tool, Mike Patton of Mr. Bungle and Faith No More, Boris (who took their name from the title of a Melvins song), Pig Destroyer, Helmet, Full of Hell, Corey Taylor of Slipknot, Sleep, Earth, Sunn O))), Lamb of God, Mastodon, Neurosis, High on Fire, Baroness, Eyehategod and Isis. AllMusic wrote &quot;their ability to combine punk with a strong Black Sabbath influence had a major impact on everything from grunge to alternative metal to doom metal and stoner rock.&quot; In 2017, &quot;Metal Injection&quot; ranked Melvins at number 2 on their list of &quot;10 Heaviest Grunge Bands&quot;.

<doc id="159482" wikidata="Q847294" url="?curid=159482" title="Cocktail shaker sort">
<text>Cocktail shaker sort, also known as bidirectional bubble sort, cocktail sort, shaker sort (which can also refer to a variant of selection sort), ripple sort, shuffle sort, or shuttle sort, is an extension of bubble sort. The algorithm extends bubble sort by operating in two directions. While it improves on bubble sort by more quickly moving items to the beginning of the list, it provides only marginal performance improvements. 

Like most variants of bubble sort, cocktail shaker sort is used primarily as an educational tool. More efficient algorithms such as quicksort, merge sort, or timsort are used by the sorting libraries built into popular programming languages such as Python and Java.

==Pseudocode==
The simplest form goes through the whole list each time:

 procedure cocktailShakerSort(A : list of sortable items) is
 do
 swapped := false
 for each i in 0 to length(A) − 1 do:
 if A[i] &gt; A[i + 1] then // test whether the two elements are in the wrong order
 swap(A[i], A[i + 1]) // let the two elements change places
 swapped := true
 end if
 end for
 if not swapped then
 // we can exit the outer loop here if no swaps occurred.
 break do-while loop
 end if
 swapped := false
 for each i in length(A) − 1 to 0 do:
 if A[i] &gt; A[i + 1] then
 swap(A[i], A[i + 1])
 swapped := true
 end if
 end for
 while swapped // if no elements have been swapped, then the list is sorted
 end procedure

The first rightward pass will shift the largest element to its correct place at the end, and the following leftward pass will shift the smallest element to its correct place at the beginning. The second complete pass will shift the second largest and second smallest elements to their correct places, and so on. After &quot;i&quot; passes, the first &quot;i&quot; and the last &quot;i&quot; elements in the list are in their correct positions, and do not need to be checked. By shortening the part of the list that is sorted each time, the number of operations can be halved (see bubble sort).

This is an example of the algorithm in MATLAB/OCTAVE with the optimization of remembering the last swap index and updating the bounds.
function A = cocktailShakerSort(A)
% `beginIdx` and `endIdx` marks the first and last index to check
beginIdx = 1;
endIdx = length(A) - 1;
while beginIdx &lt;= endIdx
 newBeginIdx = endIdx;
 newEndIdx = beginIdx;
 for ii = beginIdx:endIdx
 if A(ii) &gt; A(ii + 1)
 [A(ii+1), A(ii)] = deal(A(ii), A(ii+1));
 newEndIdx = ii;
 end
 end

 % decreases `endIdx` because the elements after `newEndIdx` are in correct order
 endIdx = newEndIdx - 1;

 for ii = endIdx:-1:beginIdx
 if A(ii) &gt; A(ii + 1)
 [A(ii+1), A(ii)] = deal(A(ii), A(ii+1));
 newBeginIdx = ii;
 end
 end
 % increases `beginIdx` because the elements before `newBeginIdx` are in correct order
 beginIdx = newBeginIdx + 1;
end
end
==Differences from bubble sort==
Cocktail shaker sort is a slight variation of bubble sort. It differs in that instead of repeatedly passing through the list from bottom to top, it passes alternately from bottom to top and then from top to bottom. It can achieve slightly better performance than a standard bubble sort. The reason for this is that bubble sort only passes through the list in one direction and therefore can only move items backward one step each iteration.

An example of a list that proves this point is the list (2,3,4,5,1), which would only need to go through one pass of cocktail sort to become sorted, but if using an ascending bubble sort would take four passes. However one cocktail sort pass should be counted as two bubble sort passes. Typically cocktail sort is less than two times faster than bubble sort.

Another optimization can be that the algorithm remembers where the last actual swap has been done. In the next iteration, there will be no swaps beyond this limit and the algorithm has shorter passes. As the cocktail shaker sort goes bidirectionally, the range of possible swaps, which is the range to be tested, will reduce per pass, thus reducing the overall running time slightly.

==Complexity==
The complexity of the cocktail shaker sort in big O notation is formula_1 for both the worst case and the average case, but it becomes closer to formula_2 if the list is mostly ordered before applying the sorting algorithm. For example, if every element is at a position that differs by at most k (k ≥ 1) from the position it is going to end up in, the complexity of cocktail shaker sort becomes formula_3

The cocktail shaker sort is also briefly discussed in the book &quot;The Art of Computer Programming&quot;, along with similar refinements of bubble sort. In conclusion, Knuth states about bubble sort and its improvements:
==Variations==
* Dual Cocktail Shaker sort is a variant of Cocktail Shaker Sort that performs a forward and backward pass per iteration simultaneously, improving performance compared to the original.

<doc id="159484" wikidata="Q6150593" url="?curid=159484" title="Needle lace">
<text>Needle lace is a type of lace created using a needle and thread to create hundreds of small stitches to form the lace itself.

== Origins ==
The origins of needle lace date back to the 15th century and embroidery. Cutwork and drawn work were developed to add interest to white on white embroidery, and the methods used in these techniques led to needle lace. A second expert puts the development of needle lace in the following century, the 16th, in Italy, also stemming from embroidery, the openwork on linen technique called &quot;reticella&quot;. To show off their wealth in that period in Italy, the aristocracy favored wearing rich cloth embellished by embroidery and braid. As the century progressed, the small areas that were cut from the fabric to highlight the needle lace were replaced by much larger areas of cutwork. The needlework was dependent on remaining threads running vertically and horizontally, leaving squares and rectangles, which led to geometric designs.

Venice was a center of needle lace making in the 1400s, as documented by official records. In the 1500s, city officials decreed that young men in Venice were prohibited from lace wearing until they had turned 25. Lace was a prized possession, appearing in lists of people&#x27;s assets.

== Materials ==
A variety of styles developed where the work is started by securing heavier guiding threads onto a stiff background (such as thick paper) with stitches that can later be removed. The work is then built up using a variety of stitches—the most basic being a variety of buttonhole or blanket stitch. When the entire area is covered with the stitching, the stay-stitches are released and the lace comes away from the paper.

Needle lace is also used to create the fillings or insertions in cutwork.

== Structure ==
In its basic form, the only equipment and materials used are a needle, thread and scissors. Often there is a supporting substrate that is used to tether the outline stitches for the basic framework, and then many types of stitches will fill in the open spaces subsequently. Many different needle lace styles and traditions have developed over the centuries, and distinctive stitches can characterize different styles. Many needle lace texts are available to assist contemporary lacemakers to reproduce the classic stitches. Modern lacemakers can also explore contemporary design and novel uses for needle lace beyond the traditional reproduction work. 

The Royal School of Needlework contains a stitch library of many types of stitching, including some needle lace techniques. For example, Hollie Point structure and steps can be examined in detail.

<doc id="159485" wikidata="Q3182600" url="?curid=159485" title="Crocheted lace">
<text>Crochet lace is an application of the art of crochet. Generally it uses finer threads and more decorative styles of stitching, often with flowing lines or scalloped edges to give interest. Variation of the size of the holes also gives a piece a &quot;lacy&quot; look.

Originally crocheted lace was not regarded as true lace. Crocheting was considered an easy, and less time-consuming, but otherwise clearly inferior surrogate for &quot;true&quot; lace such as bobbin lace, needle lace or netting. The first examples of crocheted lace try to reproduce the products of other lacemaking techniques as faithfully as possible. Over time, the many possibilities and inherent beauty of crocheted lace became more widely appreciated.

Main styles of crocheted lace include filet crochet, Irish crochet and its modern derivatives, pineapple crochet. Freeform crocheted lace also exists, examples of which are pieces striving to imitate reticella lace.

<doc id="159488" wikidata="Q491892" url="?curid=159488" title="Static-X">
<text>Static-X is an American industrial metal band from Los Angeles, California, formed in 1994. The line-up has fluctuated over the years, but was long-held constant with band founder, frontman, vocalist and rhythm guitarist Wayne Static until his death in 2014.

The band was founded by Static and original drummer Ken Jay. They rose to fame with their 1999 debut album &quot;Wisconsin Death Trip&quot; where their heavy industrial metal sound attracted attention within the burgeoning nu metal movement of the late 1990s, with the album eventually going platinum in the United States. The band released five more albums over the course of the next decade: &quot;Machine&quot; in 2001, &quot;Shadow Zone&quot; in 2003, &quot;Start a War&quot; in 2005, &quot;Cannibal&quot; in 2007, and &quot;Cult of Static&quot; in 2009. By 2011, the band had sold over three million albums worldwide.

The band entered a hiatus while Static worked on his solo album, &quot;Pighammer&quot;, in 2011. Static briefly reformed Static-X in 2012, using only members of his solo album&#x27;s touring band, before officially breaking up in June 2013. On November 1, 2014, Wayne Static died at the age of 48.

The rest of the original Static-X lineup – bassist Tony Campos, lead guitarist Koichi Fukuda and drummer Ken Jay – announced on October 23, 2018, that they were reforming the band in Static&#x27;s honor, and would release &quot;Project: Regeneration Vol. 1&quot;, their first studio album in eleven years, in 2020. A follow-up album, &quot;Project: Regeneration Vol. 2&quot;, was released on January 26, 2024.

==History==
===Formation, &quot;Wisconsin Death Trip&quot; and &quot;Machine&quot; (1994–2001)===

Static-X was founded in 1994 after the disbandment of Wayne Static&#x27;s prior band, Deep Blue Dream. Static played in the band in the late 1980s with future Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan. However, when the Smashing Pumpkins began to gain popularity, Corgan made the choice to commit all of his attention to The Smashing Pumpkins, and Deep Blue Dream eventually disbanded. Static and Ken Jay later moved to Los Angeles to start a new band with guitarist Emerson Swinford, whom they had met through their mutual friend, Chicago singer-songwriter, PJ Olsson. They formed a band called Drill, which included Tony Campos on bass and started performing in the LA music scene. After Swinford left to pursue touring and session work, they recruited guitarist Koichi Fukuda, and renamed the band Static; however, during the recording of their debut album, they realized there were multiple other bands named Static, and subsequently renamed the band to Static-X.
Static-X signed with Warner Bros. Records in early 1998, and released their debut album, &quot;Wisconsin Death Trip&quot;, on March 23, 1999. Soon after, they released their first single &quot;Push It&quot;, followed by &quot;I&#x27;m with Stupid&quot; and &quot;Bled for Days&quot; in 2000. Static-X toured strictly in support of the album and twice performed on Ozzfest, supporting Fear Factory. In the following year, a promotional EP, &quot;The Death Trip Continues&quot;, was also released.

The band toured heavily in support of the album, with Static recounting:

&quot;It was really just a whirlwind and I barely remember it. We worked so hard and toured so hard that I don&#x27;t even remember most of it. We played 300 shows in the first year and we just never went home. We would tour on one tour for six or eight weeks and that tour would end somewhere on the East Coast and we&#x27;d drive a couple days and hook up with Slayer and tour with them for four or five weeks. That tour ends and then we&#x27;d drive a few days to Boston to hook up with Sevendust. We just kept going and kept going and never went home. I mean I didn&#x27;t even have a home. I lived at the rehearsal space for the last year before we started touring. I had to quit my job to make the record so I didn&#x27;t have anywhere to even go home to...I look back at it now and I kinda wish I had taken the time to sit back and appreciate it more. Maybe got to know some of the other bands a little more and spend time and having a good time and partying and maybe taking some pictures of the other guys.&quot;

Commercially, the effort paid off, with the album eventually going platinum in 2001. The follow-up tour was documented on the DVD &quot;Where the Hell Are We and What Day Is It... This Is Static-X&quot;. However, the pressure of recording a follow-up was hard on Static and the rest of the band. Static, worried they would be unable to deliver another successful album, desired to start work on follow up material while still touring in support of &quot;Wisconsin Death Trip&quot;, while the rest of the band wanted to focus on enjoying the touring. Without support, Static took matters into his own hands, writing all of the material himself over the course of the two years of touring. This caused friction from within the band, who resented Static for not waiting for them or including them in on the creation process, of which all members had been part of in the prior album. Fukuda would leave the band upon the conclusion of the tour, leading the band to record the album as a three-piece; Static would later describe the split both as &quot;amicable&quot; and &quot;definitely not [...] amicable&quot;. Despite this, the band still managed to find success, with the second album, &quot;Machine&quot;, releasing on May 22, 2001, and eventually being certified gold with 500,000 units sold. Tripp Eisen replaced Fukuda on guitar for touring in support of the album.

===&quot;Shadow Zone&quot; and &quot;Start a War&quot; (2003–2005)===

In 2002, Static was contacted by Jonathan Davis of the nu metal band Korn. Davis had recently signed on to provide the soundtrack for the &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot; film soundtrack, but due to contract limitations with Sony, was legally unable to actually perform the music he had written for the soundtrack. As a remedy of this, Davis contacted a number of metal vocalists, Static included, to sing on the songs he had written. Static provided vocals for one track, &quot;Not Meant for Me&quot;, with the &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot; soundtrack releasing in February 2002.

The contribution was a turning point for the band; the track, which was much more melodic than much of the band&#x27;s music up until that point, would attract the attention of Warner Brother&#x27;s executive Tom Whalley, who pressured the band as a whole to pursue a melodic sound. Personnel and line-up changes would further alter the band&#x27;s sound. The label would not allow the band to work again with record producer Ulrich Wild as they had for their prior two albums, instead arranging for them to work with Josh Abraham, a producer known for working with more commercially melodically mainstream bands such as Staind, Filter, and Velvet Revolver. The album was the first to feature Eisen&#x27;s songwriting contributions and performances, and the only to feature sessions drummer Josh Freese, of A Perfect Circle, due to Jay leaving the band two days before beginning the formal recording process. Jay has been reluctant to talk about his reasons for leaving.

The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Shadow Zone&quot;, was released on October 7, 2003, and debuted at no. 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts, but failed to achieve the platinum or gold selling status of their prior two albums. Two singles were released to promote the album, &quot;The Only&quot; and &quot;So&quot;. The band proceeded to hire Nick Oshiro, formerly of Seether, as Jay&#x27;s replacement and the band&#x27;s permanent drummer, to tour in support of the album.

July 20, 2004 saw the release of &quot;Beneath... Between... Beyond...&quot;, a collection of rarities and demos. Shortly after the release of &quot;Beneath... Between... Beyond...&quot;, the band toured again with Fear Factory, and commenced work on their fourth studio album, &quot;Start a War&quot;. In February 2005, Tripp Eisen was arrested in a sex scandal involving minors, and was subsequently fired from the band. Former guitarist Koichi Fukuda, who had been providing samples and keyboards for the new album, rejoined Static-X to fill the gap left by Eisen. &quot;Start a War&quot; was finally released on June 14, 2005. &quot;I&#x27;m the One&quot; and &quot;Dirthouse&quot; were released as singles from the album.

===&quot;Cannibal&quot; and &quot;Cult of Static&quot; (2007–2009)===
Their fifth album, &quot;Cannibal&quot;, released on April 3, 2007, marked the studio return of their original guitarist, Koichi Fukuda. One of the new tracks called &quot;No Submission&quot; was released on the &quot;Saw III soundtrack&quot; prior to the album&#x27;s release. &quot;Cannibal&quot; was released as a digital download single at iTunes. &quot;Destroyer&quot; was released as a lead off radio single, before the album was released.

On March 20, the album was preceded with an exclusive &quot;Destroyer&quot; EP, with a video being produced for the title track. The album itself debuted at No. 36 in the U.S. with sales of over 30,000.
On May 10, 2007 it was announced that the band would be playing on the main stage at Ozzfest 2007. Additionally, at the time, Static first announced his intention to release solo material, referring to it as &quot;Pighammer&quot;. In the meantime, in November 2007, Campos temporarily joined Ministry as a touring bassist for Ministry&#x27;s C U LaTour in the wake of Paul Raven&#x27;s death.

The band began working on their sixth studio album, &quot;Cult of Static&quot;, in January 2008 after returning from the Operation Annihilation tour in Australia. Static stated they intended to mix the longer buildups and break downs from &quot;Wisconsin Death Trip&quot; with the heaviness that was present on &quot;Cannibal&quot;. On October 14, 2008 Static-X released their live CD/DVD, &quot;Cannibal Killers Live&quot;. On December 11, 2008 Static revealed the album&#x27;s release date and name saying &quot;I had hoped to announce it here first, but my publicist beat me to the punch! The new record is indeed entitled &quot;Cult of Static&quot; and will be released March 17. The &quot;cult&quot; part of the title is not to be taken in any religious manner, I am referring to and giving respect to the loyalty of all you good people that have supported us through the years. This record is definitely darker than &quot;Cannibal&quot; and has more synths and loops as well. And this is also the most crushing guitar tone I have ever had. There are 11 songs instead of our usual 12, and they are mostly longer and more epic than ever before.&quot; The album debut at No. 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, the highest since their second studio album, &quot;Machine&quot;. A new Static-X song called &quot;Lunatic&quot; appeared on soundtrack to the movie &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Punisher: War Zone&quot;. Drummer Nick Oshiro left Static-X prior to the start of the tour, being replaced by touring drummer Will Hunt. The tour in support of the album lasted for the rest of the year, playing major concerts such as the Download Festival and Rock on the Range.

===Hiatus, breakup and Wayne Static&#x27;s death (2010–2017)===
After finishing their final tour dates in Australia at the end of 2009, the band began to cave to Static&#x27;s friction with the rest of the band: Fukuda wanted to focus more on his new family, and Oshiro&#x27;s newfound sobriety was clashing with Static&#x27;s substance abuse; Campos would later call this stage of the band a &quot;toxic environment&quot;. Static announced that he would be focusing on his side project, then tentatively titled Pighammer. He later revealed that Campos had left the band, and eventually joined the metal band Soulfly. but clarified that the band had not broken up, but rather, members were just doing different projects at the time - Campos maintains he never left the band. Static began his solo touring in 2011, most notably playing at Graspop Metal Meeting 2011. He released his debut solo album &quot;Pighammer&quot; on October 4, 2011.

In 2012, Wayne Static decided to reform Static-X, but none of the original members would join him. Instead his solo band would tour under the name Static-X. In June 2013, Static announced Static-X&#x27;s official break-up. Static blamed it on a disagreement with Campos over the rights of the band; citing that Campos was paid by Wayne for the use of the name while touring, but during that tour, Wayne took ill; in a 2019 post, former tour manager Eric Dinkelmann claimed, however, that the illness was just an official cover and the real reason for the tour cancellation was &quot;a drug bust&quot;, which Campos would later also allude to. Static ended the band soon afterwards. Despite breaking up the band, Static still performed the band&#x27;s music under his own name and solo band in 2014, most notably playing the &quot;Wisconsin Death Trip&quot; album in its entirety to celebrate the album&#x27;s fifteenth anniversary. In a 2022 interview, Edsel Dope, who was on the same tour bill as Static at the time, recalled that the tour experience revealed to him the depths of Static&#x27;s drug addiction, and that while he made an effort to convince Static to reform the full band, he was &quot;not sure without rehab it will be possible&quot;.

On November 1, 2014, Wayne Static died at the age of 48. Static&#x27;s wife, Tera Wray, released a statement stating that despite Static&#x27;s prior history of drug use, he had stopped his drug use in 2009, and that his death was not drug or overdose related. Despite her claims, the coroner&#x27;s report, released in March 2015, indicated that his death was the result of a combination of excessive prescription drugs and alcohol in his system, though the manner of death was deemed &quot;natural.&quot; Wray herself died of suicide in 2016.

===Reunion and &quot;Project: Regeneration&quot; (2018–present)===
On October 23, 2018, original members Tony Campos, Koichi Fukuda and Ken Jay revealed plans for Static-X to reunite and to release a new album in 2019 called &quot;Project Regeneration&quot;, which would include previously unreleased tracks with Wayne Static&#x27;s vocals and guest vocals by David Draiman, Ivan Moody, Dez Fafara, Burton C. Bell, Al Jourgensen, Edsel Dope and others.

The band also embarked on a worldwide tour in 2019 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their debut album &quot;Wisconsin Death Trip&quot; as well as a memorial to Wayne Static, featuring an unidentified vocalist named &quot;Xer0&quot; wearing a mask some confused to be that of Wayne Static. This decision received mixed feedback, with some journalists calling it a &quot;creepy Wayne Static cosplay&quot; and &quot;zombie Wayne Static&quot;. The band insisted that Static&#x27;s family gave the band their blessing, and Jay noted that it fit Static&#x27;s &quot;terrifically morbid sense of humour&quot;. While Xer0&#x27;s identity has never been officially revealed, speculation has generally pointed at Dope singer Edsel Dope. Edsel himself denied this initially, but later admitted to his role, saying that he and the band felt Xer0 should be a separate entity from Dope. The mask was made by the late Laney Chantal, wife of Twiggy Ramirez.

On February 6, 2020, the band released the first new song from their forthcoming and renamed album &quot;Project: Regeneration Vol. 1&quot; titled &quot;Hollow (Project Regeneration)&quot;. It was then announced that &quot;Project Regeneration&quot; would now consist of two volumes, both with at least 10 songs, all of them with vocals by Wayne Static. The album was slated to be released May 15, 2020, but was eventually pushed to be released on July 10, 2020 due to the manufacturing delays associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The band resumed work on &quot;Volume 2&quot; shortly after the release of the first volume.

On August 22, 2021, Campos stated that the band was working on &quot;Project: Regeneration Vol. 2&quot;, which also consists of recovered material, as well as entirely new songs. On February 8, 2023, the band announced the album would be released later in the year on November 3. The lead single for &quot;Project: Regeneration Vol. 2&quot; was a cover of Nine Inch Nails&#x27; &quot;Terrible Lie&quot;. On June 12, the Machine Killer Tour was announced with Static-X co-headlining with Sevendust. The album&#x27;s release was eventually pushed back to January 26, 2024, nearly ten years after Static&#x27;s death. Edsel Dope has cited the songs &quot;Black Star&quot; and &quot;Stay Alive&quot; as the reasons for the delay, both of which were built from material discovered in the last minute. Regarding the next Static-X album, Campos stated that it was up to the fans if the band could continue making music without Wayne Static.

In March 2024, a documentary about the band, &quot;Evil Disco: The Rise, Fall, And Regeneration of Static-X&quot;, was announced.

==Musical style and influences==
Static-X has been described as industrial metal, nu metal, alternative metal, rap metal, hard rock, industrial music and industrial pop. Self-described as &quot;evil disco&quot;, Static-X&#x27;s style, according to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;combines electronic elements influenced by industrial artists such as Ministry and Skinny Puppy with the harshness of bands like Pantera&quot;. Static-X&#x27;s style also has used elements of genres such as techno, speed metal, and thrash metal.

Wayne Static has cited house music as an influence on Static-X&#x27;s music. Static also has said that throughout 1994 to 1996, he listened to the Prodigy and the Crystal Method. Static has said that he &quot;imagined Static-X was gonna be like a Prodigy or a Crystal Method and more of an electronic-based thing&quot;. Static-X&#x27;s influences include the Crystal Method, the Prodigy, Prong, Pantera, Ministry, Korn, the Sisters of Mercy, the Chemical Brothers, Joy Division, Kiss, Mortician, Fear Factory and Crowbar. Despite being labeled in the nu metal category, Campos noted that the band never felt the genre applies to them, explaining that they were more about blending industrial and electronic aspects of music into a heavy metal sound, and that they were influenced more by the music of Ministry, Prong, and the &quot;Spawn&quot; soundtrack.

A recurring mention in the band&#x27;s material was the mention of &quot;Otsego&quot;, a reference to Otsego, Michigan, with songs named after the town including &quot;Otsegolation&quot;, &quot;Otsego Undead&quot;, &quot;Otsegolectric&quot;, &quot;Otsego Amigo&quot;, &quot;Disco Otsego&quot; and &quot;Otsego Placebo&quot;; Wayne Static attended Western Michigan University and at the time used a fake ID that claimed he was &quot;Dean from Otsego&quot;.
