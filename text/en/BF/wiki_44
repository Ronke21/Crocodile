<text>&quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; is a European fairy tale about a young girl and a sly wolf. Its origins can be traced back to several pre-17th-century European folk tales. The two best known versions were written by Charles Perrault and the Brothers Grimm.

The story has varied considerably in different versions over the centuries, translations, and as the subject of numerous modern adaptations. Other names for the story are &quot;Little Red Cap&quot; or simply &quot;Red Riding Hood&quot;. It is number 333 in the Aarne–Thompson classification system for folktales.

==Plot==

The story centers around a girl named Little Red Riding Hood, after the red hooded cape that she wears. The girl walks through the woods to deliver food to her sickly grandmother (wine and cake depending on the translation).

A stalking wolf wants to eat the girl and the food in the basket. After he inquires as to where she is going, he suggests that she pick some flowers as a present for her grandmother. While she goes in search of flowers, he goes to the grandmother&#x27;s house and gains entry by pretending to be Riding Hood. He swallows the grandmother whole, climbs into her bed, and waits for the girl, disguised as the grandmother.

When Riding Hood arrives, she notices the strange appearance of her &quot;grandmother&quot;. After some back and forth, Riding Hood comments on the wolf&#x27;s teeth, at which point the wolf leaps out of bed and eats her as well. In Charles Perrault&#x27;s version of the story, the first to be published, the wolf falls asleep afterwards, whereupon the story ends.

In later versions, the story continues. A woodcutter in the French version, or a hunter in the Brothers Grimm and traditional German versions, comes to the rescue with an axe, and cuts open the sleeping wolf. Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother emerge shaken, but unharmed. Then they fill the wolf&#x27;s body with heavy stones. The wolf awakens and attempts to flee, but the stones cause him to collapse and die. In the Grimms&#x27; version, the wolf leaves the house and tries to drink out of a well, but the stones in his stomach cause him to fall in and drown (similarly to the story of &quot;The Wolf and the Seven Little Kids&quot;).

Sanitized versions of the story have the grandmother locked in the closet rather than being eaten (and also having the wolf eat the food Little Red Riding Hood bought rather than her) and some have Little Red Riding Hood saved by the lumberjack as the wolf advances on her rather than after she is eaten, where the woodcutter kills or simply chases away the wolf with his axe.

==History==
===Relationship to other tales===
The story displays similarities to stories from classical Greece and Rome. Scholar Graham Anderson has compared the story to a local legend recounted by Pausanias in which, each year, a virgin girl was offered to a malevolent spirit dressed in the skin of a wolf, who raped the girl. Then, one year, the boxer Euthymos came along, slew the spirit, and married the girl who had been offered as a sacrifice. There are also a number of different stories recounted by Greek authors involving a woman named Pyrrha (literally &quot;fire&quot;) and a man with some name meaning &quot;wolf&quot;. The Roman poet Horace alludes to a tale in which a male child is rescued alive from the belly of Lamia, an ogress in classical mythology.

The dialogue between the wolf and Little Red Riding Hood has analogies to the Norse &quot;Þrymskviða&quot; from the &quot;Elder Edda&quot;; the giant Þrymr had stolen Mjölnir, Thor&#x27;s hammer, and demanded Freyja as his bride for its return. Instead, the gods dressed Thor as a bride and sent him. When the giants note Thor&#x27;s unladylike eyes, eating, and drinking, Loki explains them as Freyja&#x27;s not having slept, eaten, or drunk, out of longing for the wedding. A parallel to another Norse myth, the chase and eventual murder of the sun goddess by the wolf Sköll, has also been drawn.

A similar story also belongs to the North African tradition, namely in Kabylia, where a number of versions are attested. The theme of the little girl who visits her (grand)dad in his cabin and is recognized by the sound of her bracelets constitutes the refrain of a well-known song by the modern singer Idir, &quot;A Vava Inouva&quot;:

The theme of the ravening wolf and of the creature released unharmed from its belly is also reflected in the Russian tale &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; and another Grimm tale &quot;The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids&quot;, but its general theme of restoration is at least as old as the biblical story, &quot;Jonah and the Whale&quot;. The theme also appears in the story of the life of Saint Margaret, wherein the saint emerges unharmed from the belly of a dragon, and in the short story &quot;The Red Path&quot; by Jim C. Hines.

A Taiwanese story from the 16th century, known as &quot;Aunt Tiger&quot; bears several striking similarities. In this story there are two girls who are sisters. When the girls&#x27; mother goes out, the tigress comes to the girls&#x27; house and pretends to be their aunt, asking to come in. One girl says that the aunt&#x27;s voice does not sound right, so the tigress attempts to disguise her voice. Then, the girl says that the aunt&#x27;s hands feel too coarse, so the tigress attempts to make her paws smoother. When finally the tigress gains entry, she eats the girl&#x27;s sister. The girl comes up with a ruse to go outside and fetch some food for her aunt. Aunt Tiger, suspicious of the girl, ties a rope to her leg. The girl ties a bucket to the rope to fool her, but Aunt Tiger realizes this and chases after her, whereupon she climbs into a tree. The girl tells the tigress that she will let her eat her, but first, she would like to feed her some fruit from the tree. The tigress comes closer to eat the fruit, whereupon the girl pours boiling hot oil down her throat, killing her.

According to Paul Delarue, a similar narrative is found in East Asian stories, namely, in China, Korea and Japan, with the title &quot;The Tiger and the Children&quot;.

===Earliest versions===
The origins of the Little Red Riding Hood story can be traced to several likely pre-17th century versions from various European countries. Some of these are significantly different from the currently known, Grimms-inspired version. It was told by French peasants in the 10th century and recorded by the cathedral schoolmaster Egbert of Liège. A fifteenth-century collection of folklore described an anecdote about a woman whose husband was a werewolf though it bears little resemblance to Perrault&#x27;s text. In Italy, Little Red Riding Hood was told by peasants in the fourteenth century, where a number of versions exist, including &quot;La finta nonna&quot; (The False Grandmother), written among others by Italo Calvino in the &quot;Italian Folktales&quot; collection. It has also been called &quot;The Story of Grandmother&quot;. It is also possible that this early tale has roots in very similar East Asian tales (e.g. &quot;Grandaunt Tiger&quot;).

These early variations of the tale do differ from the currently known version in several ways. The antagonist is not always a wolf, but sometimes a &#x27;bzou&#x27; (werewolf), making these tales relevant to the werewolf trials (similar to witch trials) of the time (e.g. the trial of Peter Stumpp). The wolf usually leaves the grandmother&#x27;s blood and flesh for the girl to eat, who then unwittingly cannibalizes her own grandmother. Furthermore, the wolf was also known to ask her to remove her clothing and toss it into the fire. In some versions, the wolf eats the girl after she gets into bed with him, and the story ends there. In others, she sees through his disguise and tries to escape, complaining to her &quot;grandmother&quot; that she needs to defecate and would not wish to do so in the bed. The wolf reluctantly lets her go, tied to a piece of string so she does not get away. The girl slips the string over something else and runs off. In these stories, she escapes with no help from any male or older female figure, instead using her own cunning, or in some versions the help of a younger boy who she happens to run into. Sometimes, though more rarely, the red hood is even non-existent.

In other tellings of the story, the wolf chases after Little Red Riding Hood. She escapes with the help of some laundresses, who spread a sheet taut over a river so she may escape. When the wolf follows Red over the bridge of cloth, the sheet is released and the wolf drowns in the river. And in another version the wolf is pushed into the fire, while he is preparing the flesh of the grandmother to be eaten by the girl.

===Charles Perrault version===
The earliest known printed version was known as &quot;Le Petit Chaperon Rouge&quot; and may have had its origins in 17th-century French folklore. It was included in the collection &quot;Tales and Stories of the Past with Morals. Tales of Mother Goose&quot; (&quot;Histoires et contes du temps passé, avec des moralités. Contes de ma mère l&#x27;Oye&quot;), in 1697, by Charles Perrault. As the title implies, this version is both more sinister and more overtly moralized than the later ones. The redness of the hood, which has been given symbolic significance in many interpretations of the tale, was a detail introduced by Perrault.

The story had as its subject an &quot;attractive, well-bred young lady&quot;, a village girl of the country being deceived into giving a wolf she encountered the information he needed to find her grandmother&#x27;s house successfully and eat the old woman while at the same time avoiding being noticed by woodcutters working in the nearby forest. Then he proceeded to lay a trap for Red Riding Hood. Little Red Riding Hood ends up being asked to climb into the bed before being eaten by the wolf, where the story ends. The wolf emerges the victor of the encounter and there is no happy ending.

Charles Perrault explained the &#x27;moral&#x27; at the end of the tale so that no doubt is left to his intended meaning:

This, the presumed original version of the tale was written for the late seventeenth-century French court of King Louis XIV. This audience, whom the King entertained with extravagant parties, presumably would take from the story&#x27;s intended meaning.

===The Brothers Grimm version===
In the 19th century two separate German versions were retold to Jacob Grimm and his younger brother Wilhelm Grimm, known as the Brothers Grimm, the first by Jeanette Hassenpflug (1791–1860) and the second by Marie Hassenpflug (1788–1856). The brothers turned the first version to the main body of the story and the second into a sequel of it. The story as &quot;Rotkäppchen&quot; was included in the first edition of their collection &quot;Kinder- und Hausmärchen&quot; (Children&#x27;s and Household Tales (1812) – KHM 26).

The earlier parts of the tale agree so closely with Perrault&#x27;s variant that it is almost certainly the source of the tale. This version ends with the girl and her grandmother saved by a huntsman who was after the wolf&#x27;s skin; this ending mirrors that in the tale &quot;The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids&quot;, which appears to be the source. The second part featured the girl and her grandmother trapping and killing another wolf, this time anticipating his moves based on their experience with the previous one. The girl did not leave the path when the wolf spoke to her, her grandmother locked the door to keep it out, and when the wolf lurked, the grandmother had Little Red Riding Hood put a trough under the chimney and fill it with water that sausages had been cooked in; the smell lured the wolf down, and it drowned.

The Brothers further revised the story in later editions and it reached the above-mentioned final and better-known version in the 1857 edition of their work. It is notably tamer than the older stories which contained darker themes.

===Later versions===
Numerous authors have rewritten, adapted, or collected variants of this tale.

Charles Marelle in his version of the fairy tale called &quot;The True History of Little Goldenhood&quot; (1888) gives the girl a real name – Blanchette.

Andrew Lang included a variant called &quot;The True History of Little Goldenhood&quot; in &quot;The Red Fairy Book&quot; (1890). He derived it from the works of Charles Marelles, in &quot;Contes of Charles Marelles&quot;. This version explicitly states that the story had been mistold earlier. The girl is saved, but not by the huntsman; when the wolf tries to eat her, its mouth is burned by the golden hood she wears, which is enchanted.

James N. Barker wrote a variation of Little Red Riding Hood in 1827 as an approximately 1000-word story. It was later reprinted in 1858 in a book of collected stories edited by William E Burton, called the &quot;Cyclopedia of Wit and Humor&quot;. The reprint also features a wood engraving of a clothed wolf on a bended knee holding Little Red Riding Hood&#x27;s hand.

 Jack Zipes anthologized several 19th-century variants.

Northcote Whitridge Thomas included a variant with a male protagonist in his report of the Ibo people.

An Iranian variant, featuring a little boy and the disrobing motif, appears in a 20th-century French anthology.

Geneviève Massignon recorded a variant called &quot;Boudin-Boudine&quot; from an informant in Le Gué-de-Velluire. In this version, a little boy is protected from the wolf by his grandmother and father.

==Interpretations==
Apart from the overt warning about talking to strangers, there are many interpretations of the classic fairy tale, many of them sexual. Some are listed below.

===Natural cycles===
Folklorists and cultural anthropologists, such as P. Saintyves and Edward Burnett Tylor, saw &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; in terms of solar myths and other naturally occurring cycles. Her red hood could represent the bright sun which is ultimately swallowed by the terrible night (the wolf), and the variations in which she is cut out of the wolf&#x27;s belly represent the dawn. In this interpretation, there is a connection between the wolf of this tale and Sköll, the wolf in Norse mythology that will swallow the personified Sun at Ragnarök, or Fenrir. Alternatively, the tale could be about the season of spring or the month of May, escaping the winter.

===Rite===
The tale has been interpreted as a puberty rite, stemming from a prehistoric origin (sometimes an origin stemming from a previous matriarchal era). The girl, leaving home, enters a liminal state and by going through the acts of the tale, is transformed into an adult woman by the act of coming out of the wolf&#x27;s stomach.

===Rebirth===
Bruno Bettelheim, in &quot;The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales&quot; (1976), recast the Little Red Riding Hood motif in terms of classic Freudian analysis, that shows how fairy tales educate, support, and liberate children&#x27;s emotions. The motif of the huntsman cutting open the wolf he interpreted as a &quot;rebirth&quot;; the girl who foolishly listened to the wolf has been reborn as a new person.

===Norse myth===
The poem &quot;Þrymskviða&quot; from the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; mirrors some elements of Red Riding Hood. Loki&#x27;s explanations for the strange behavior of &quot;Freyja&quot; (actually Thor disguised as Freyja) mirror the wolf&#x27;s explanations for his strange appearance. The red hood has often been given great importance in many interpretations, with a significance from the dawn to blood.

===Erotic, romantic, or rape connotations===
A sexual analysis of the tale may also include negative connotations in terms of rape or abduction. In &quot;Against Our Will&quot;, Susan Brownmiller describes the fairy tale as allegory of rape. Many revisionist versions focus on empowerment and depict Little Red Riding Hood or the grandmother successfully defending herself against the wolf.

Such tellings bear some similarity to the &quot;animal bridegroom&quot; tales, such as &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; or &quot;The Frog Prince&quot;, but where the heroines of those tales revert the hero to a prince, these tellings of &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; reveal to the heroine that she has a wild nature like the hero&#x27;s. These interpretations reframe the story as one of female empowerment and do not characterize Little Red Riding Hood as a victim.

==In popular culture==

===In animation and film===
* In Tex Avery&#x27;s short animated cartoon, &quot;Red Hot Riding Hood&quot; (1943), the story is recast in an adult-oriented urban setting, with the suave, sharp-dressed Wolf howling after the nightclub singer Red. Avery used the same cast and themes in a subsequent series of cartoons. Similar modern takes also feature in &quot;Swing Shift Cinderella&quot; (1945) and &quot;Little Rural Riding Hood&quot; (1949).
* &quot;The Company of Wolves&quot; (1984) is a film adaptation based on the short story by Angela Carter and directed by Neil Jordan.

The hunter turns into a wolf and kills her grandmother, and is about to claim Rosaleen (Red Riding Hood) as well; but she is equally seductive and ends up lying with the wolf man and dominating him right back. In the end, she becomes a werewolf and the huntsman&#x27;s mate before the two run off into the forest to join his pack. This version may be interpreted as a young girl&#x27;s journey into womanhood, both with regard to menstruation and sexual awakening.

Carter&#x27;s rewriting of the tale—both her 1979 story and its 1984 film adaptation, the screenplay of which Carter co-wrote with director Neil Jordan—examines female lust, which according to author Catherine Orenstein is &quot;healthy, but also challenging and sometimes disturbing, unbridled and feral lust that delivers up contradictions.&quot; As Orenstein points out, the film version does this by unravelling the original tale&#x27;s &quot;underlying sexual currents&quot; and by investing Rosaleen (the Little Red Riding Hood character, played by Sarah Patterson) with &quot;animal instincts&quot; that lead to her transformation.

* The Kelly Family&#x27;s &quot;The Wolf&quot; (1994) is inspired by the tale, warning the children that there&#x27;s a Wolf out there. During the instrumental bridge in live shows, the song&#x27;s lead singer, Joey, does both Little Red Riding Hood&#x27;s and Wolf&#x27;s part, where the child asks her grandmother about the big eyes, ears, and mouth.
* &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; is a rawstyle song by Da Tweekaz, which was later remixed by Ecstatic.
* Sunny&#x27;s concept photo for Girls&#x27; Generation&#x27;s third studio album &quot;The Boys&quot; was inspired by &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;.
* Lana Del Rey has an unreleased song called &quot;Big Bad Wolf&quot; (leaked in 2012) that was inspired by &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;.
* The music videos of the songs &quot;Call Me When You&#x27;re Sober&quot; from American rock band Evanescence and &quot;The Hunted&quot; from Canadian supergroup Saint Asonia featuring Sully Erna from American heavy metal band Godsmack were inspired by &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;.
* Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Op. 39 No. 6 (Études-Tableaux) is nicknamed &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; for its dark theme and the wolf-like connotations of the piece.
* The Real Tuesday Weld&#x27;s &quot;Me and Mr. Wolf&quot; (2011) portrays the relationship between the wolf and Red Riding Hood as toxic.
* CupcakKe references the tale and characters in her song &quot;Little Red Riding Good&quot; (2024) from her album Dauntless Manifesto.

===In games===
* In the &quot;Shrek 2&quot; (2004) video game, she is playable and appears as a friend of Shrek&#x27;s. She joins him, Fiona, and Donkey on their journey to Far Far Away, despite only appearing in the film&#x27;s opening scene.
* In the computer game &quot;Dark Parables: The Red Riding Hood Sisters&quot; (2013), the original Red Riding Hood was orphaned when a wolf killed her grandma. A hunter killed the wolf before it could kill her. He took her in as his own out of pity. The Red Riding Hood of this story convinced the hunter to teach her how to fight. They protected the forest together until the hunter was killed during a wolf attack. The Red Riding Hood continued on protecting the forest and took in other orphaned girls and taught them to fight too. They take up wearing a red riding hood and cape to honor their teacher. Even after the death of the original Red Riding Hood the girls continue doing what she did in life.
* In the fighting game &quot;Darkstalkers 3&quot; (1997), the character Baby Bonnie Hood (known in the Japanese release as Bulleta) is a parody of Little Red Riding Hood, complete with a childish look, red hood and picnic basket. But instead of food, her basket is full of guns and grenades. Her personality is somewhat psychotic, guerrilla-crazy. During the fights, a small dog named Harry watches the action from the sidelines and reacts to her taking damage in battle. Two rifle-wielding huntsmen named John and Arthur briefly appear alongside her in a special power-up move titled &quot;Beautiful Hunting&quot; that inflicts extra damage on opponents. The character may be based on the James Thurber or Roald Dahl versions of the story, where Red pulls a gun from her basket and shoots the wolf, and the idea behind her character was to show that at their worst, humans are scarier than any imaginary monster.
* The psychological horror art game &quot;The Path&quot; (2007) features 6 sisters, ages 9–19, who all must face their own &#x27;wolf&#x27; in the forest on the way to Grandmother&#x27;s house. The game is developed by Tale of Tales and was originally released for the Microsoft Windows operating system on 18 March 2009, in English and Dutch, and later ported to Mac OS X by TransGaming Technologies.
* In the free-to-play mobile game &quot;Minimon: Adventure of Minions&quot; (2016), Luna is a wolflike minion and agent of a secret society with humanlike physical characteristics who wears a red hood when awakened, which references both the wolf and Red Riding Hood.
* &quot;SINoALICE&quot; (2017) is a mobile Gacha game which features Red Riding Hood as one of the main player controlled characters and features in her own dark story-line which features her as a brutally violent girl whose main desire is to inflict violence, pain and death upon her enemies as well as the other fairy-tale characters featured in the game.
* In the 2018 game Lobotomy Corporation, one of the abnormalities in the facility is named Little Red Riding Hooded Mercenary. Where Little Red Riding Hood is saved by a hunter/a lumberjack, Little Red Riding Hooded Mercenary faces the wolf, where she loses her left eye and gains many scars in addition to failing to kill the big bad wolf. After this event, and aged of 15 years old, she&#x27;s fueled by an intense will of revenge and leaves her old life to lead the life of a wandering mercenary.

===In musicals===
* Little Red Riding Hood is one of the central characters in the Broadway musical &quot;Into the Woods&quot; (1987) by Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine. In the song, &quot;I Know Things Now&quot;, she speaks of how the wolf made her feel &quot;excited, well, excited &quot;and&quot; scared&quot;, in a reference to the sexual undertones of their relationship. Red Riding Hood&#x27;s cape is also one of the musical&#x27;s four quest items that are emblematic of fairy tales.

<doc id="299252" wikidata="Q1071123" url="?curid=299252" title="Rubik's Revenge">
<text>The Rubik&#x27;s Revenge (also known as the 4×4×4 Rubik&#x27;s Cube) is a 4×4×4 version of the Rubik&#x27;s Cube. It was released in 1981. Invented by Péter Sebestény, the cube was nearly called the Sebestény Cube until a somewhat last-minute decision changed the puzzle&#x27;s name to attract fans of the original Rubik&#x27;s Cube. Unlike the original puzzle (and other puzzles with an odd number of layers like the 5×5×5 cube), it has no fixed faces: the center faces (four per face) are free to move to different positions.

Methods for solving the 3×3×3 cube work for the edges and corners of the 4×4×4 cube, as long as one has correctly identified the relative positions of the colours—since the center faces can no longer be used for identification.

==Mechanics==

The puzzle consists of 56 unique miniature cubes (&quot;cubies&quot;) on the surface. These consist of 24 centres which show one colour each, 24 edges which show two colours each, and 8 corners which show three colours each. The original Rubik&#x27;s Revenge can be taken apart without much difficulty, typically by turning one side through a 30° angle and prying an edge upward until it dislodges.

The original mechanism designed by Sebestény uses a grooved ball to hold the centre pieces in place. The edge pieces are held in place by the centres and the corners are held in place by the edges, much like the original cube. There are three mutually perpendicular grooves for the centre pieces to slide through. Each groove is only wide enough to allow one row of centre pieces to slide through it. The ball is shaped to prevent the centre pieces of the other row from sliding, ensuring that the ball remains aligned with the outside of the cube. Turning one of the centre layers moves either just that layer or the ball as well.

The Eastsheen version of the cube, which is slightly smaller at 6cm to an edge, has a completely different mechanism. Its mechanism is very similar to Eastsheen&#x27;s version of the Professor&#x27;s cube, instead of the ball-core mechanism. There are 42 pieces (36 movable and six fixed) completely hidden within the cube, corresponding to the centre rows on the Professor&#x27;s Cube. This design is more durable than the original and also allows for screws to be used to tighten or loosen the cube. The central spindle is specially shaped to prevent it from becoming misaligned with the exterior of the cube. Nearly all manufacturers of 4×4×4 use similar mechanisms.

There are 24 edge pieces which show two coloured sides each, and eight corner pieces which show three colours. Each corner piece or pair of edge pieces shows a unique colour combination, but not all combinations are present (for example, there is no piece with both red and orange sides, if red and orange are on opposite sides of the solved Cube). The location of these cubes relative to one another can be altered by twisting the layers of the cube, but the location of the coloured sides relative to one another in the completed state of the puzzle cannot be altered: it is fixed by the relative positions of the centre squares and the distribution of colour combinations on edge and corner pieces. Edge pairs are often referred to as &quot;,&quot; from double edges.

For most recent cubes, the colours of the stickers are red opposite orange, yellow opposite white, and green opposite blue. However, there also exist cubes with alternative colour arrangements (yellow opposite green, blue opposite white and red opposite orange). The Eastsheen version has purple (opposite red) instead of orange.

===Permutations===

There are 8 corners, 24 edges and 24 centres.

Any permutation of the corners is possible, including odd permutations. Seven of the corners can be independently rotated, and the orientation of the eighth depends on the other seven, giving 8!×37 combinations.

There are 24 centres, which can be arranged in 24! different ways. Assuming that the four centres of each colour are indistinguishable, the number of permutations is reduced to 24!/(246) arrangements. The reducing factor comes about because there are 24 (4!) ways to arrange the four pieces of a given colour. This is raised to the sixth power because there are six colours. An odd permutation of the corners implies an odd permutation of the centres and vice versa; however, even and odd permutations of the centres are indistinguishable due to the identical appearance of the pieces. There are several ways to make the centre pieces distinguishable, which would make an odd centre permutation visible.

The 24 edges cannot be flipped, due to the internal shape of the pieces. Corresponding edges are distinguishable, since they are mirror images of each other. Any permutation of the edges is possible, including odd permutations, giving 24! arrangements, independently of the corners or centres.

Assuming the cube does not have a fixed orientation in space, and that the permutations resulting from rotating the cube without twisting it are considered identical, the number of permutations is reduced by a factor of 24. This is because all 24 possible positions and orientations of the first corner are equivalent because of the lack of fixed centres. This factor does not appear when calculating the permutations of N×N×N cubes where N is odd, since those puzzles have fixed centres which identify the cube&#x27;s spatial orientation.

This gives a total number of permutations of 
:formula_1

The full number is possible permutations (about septillion, 7.4 septilliard on the long scale or 7.4 quattuordecillion on the short scale).

Some versions of the cube have one of the centre pieces marked with a logo, distinguishing it from the other three of the same colour. Since there are four distinguishable positions for this piece, the number of permutations is quadrupled, yielding 2.96×1046 possibilities. Any of the four possible positions for this piece could be regarded as correct.

==Solutions==
There are several methods that can be used to solve the puzzle. One such method is the reduction method, so called because it effectively reduces the 4×4×4 to a 3×3×3. Cubers first group the centre pieces of common colours together, then pair edges that show the same two colours. Once this is done, turning only the outer layers of the cube allows it to be solved like a 3×3×3 cube.

Another method is the Yau method, named after Robert Yau. The Yau method is similar to the reduction method, and it is the most common method used by speedcubers. The Yau methods starts by solving two centers on opposite sides. Three cross are then solved. Next, the four remaining centers are solved. Afterwards, any remaining are solved. This reduces down to a 3x3x3 cube.

A method similar to the Yau method is called Hoya. It was invented by Jong-Ho Jeong. It involves the same steps as Yau, but in a different order. It starts with all centers being solved except for 2 adjacent centers. Then form a cross on the bottom, then solve the last two centers. After this, it is identical to Yau, finishing the edges, and solving the cube as a 3x3.

===Parity errors===

When reducing the 4×4×4 to a 3×3×3, certain positions that cannot be solved on a standard 3×3×3 cube may be reached. There are two possible problems not found on the 3×3×3. The first is two edge pieces reversed on one edge, resulting in the colours of that edge not matching the rest of the cubies on either face (OLL parity): 
 Notice that these two edge pieces are swapped. The second is two edge pairs being swapped with each other (PLL parity), may be two corners swapped instead depending on situation and/or method: 
 These situations are known as parity errors. These positions are still solvable; however, special algorithms must be applied to fix the errors.

Some methods are designed to avoid the parity errors described above. For instance, solving the corners and edges first and the centres last would avoid such parity errors. Once the rest of the cube is solved, any permutation of the centre pieces can be solved. Note that it is possible to apparently exchange a pair of face centres by cycling 3 face centres, two of which are visually identical.

Direct solving of a 4×4×4 is uncommon, but possible, with methods such as K4. Doing so mixes a variety of techniques and is heavily reliant on commutators for the final steps.

==World records==
The world record fastest solve is 15.71 seconds, set by Max Park of the United States on June 8th 2024 at CMT Evergreen 2024 in Evergreen, Colorado.

The world record for fastest average of five solves (excluding fastest and slowest solves) is 19.38 seconds, also set by Max Park of the United States on 19 March 2023 at Arizona Speedcubing Spring 2023 in San Jose, California, with the times of (17.60), 18.49, 19.37, (23.80) and 20.28 seconds.

The world record for fastest blindfolded solve is 51.96 seconds (including inspection), set by Stanley Chapel of the United States on 28th January 2023 at 4BLD in a Madison Hall 2023, in Wisconsin, United States.

The record for mean of three blindfolded solves is 1 minute, 6.46 seconds (including inspection), also set by Stanley Chapel at PBQ Oxford 2024, with the times of 1:01.14, 1:04.03 and 1:14.20.



==Reception==
&quot;Games&quot; included &quot;Rubik&#x27;s Revenge&quot; in their &quot;Top 100 Games of 1982&quot;, finding that it helped to solve the original Rubik&#x27;s Cube that the center pieces did not move, but noted &quot;That&#x27;s not true of this Supercube, which has added an extra row of subcubes in all three dimensions.&quot;

<text>The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (ICA) is a United States federal law that governs the role of the Congress in the United States budget process.

Titles I through IX of the law are also known as the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. 

==Congressional budget process==
Titles I through IX of the law are known as the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Title II created the Congressional Budget Office. Title III governs the procedures by which Congress annually adopts a budget resolution, a concurrent resolution that is not signed by the President, which sets fiscal policy for the Congress. This budget resolution sets limits on revenues and spending that may be enforced in Congress through procedural objections called points of order. The budget resolution can also specify that a budget reconciliation bill be written, which the Congress will then consider under expedited procedures.

== Later amendments ==
The act has been amended several times, including provisions in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The original 1974 legislation, however, remains the basic blueprint for budget procedures today.

== Byrd Rule ==

The limitation on debate that prevents a budget reconciliation bill from being filibustered in the Senate (requiring a three-fifths vote to end debate) led to frequent attempts to attach amendments unrelated to the budget to the reconciliation bills. In response, the budget reconciliation acts of 1985, 1986, and 1990 adopted the &quot;Byrd Rule&quot; (Section 313 of the Budget Act). The Byrd Rule allows Senators to raise points of order (which can be waived by a three-fifths majority of Senators) against provisions in the reconciliation bills that are &quot;extraneous&quot;.

Provisions are considered extraneous if they:

# do not produce a change in outlays or revenues;
# produce changes in outlays or revenue which are merely incidental to the non-budgetary components of the provision;
# are outside the jurisdiction of the committee that submitted the title or provision for inclusion in the reconciliation measure;
# increase outlays or decrease revenue if the provision&#x27;s title, as a whole, fails to achieve the Senate reporting committee&#x27;s reconciliation instructions;
# increase net outlays or decrease revenue during a fiscal year after the years covered by the reconciliation bill unless the provision&#x27;s title, as a whole, remains budget neutral; or
# contain recommendations regarding the OASDI (social security) trust funds.

=== Sunset provisions ===

Since the reconciliation bill may cover as many as ten years, the fifth provision can have the effect of requiring that any tax cut or spending increase, which be approved by a three-fifths majority, or else the law must return to its previous state after ten years. This is responsible for the use of sunset clauses in several recent budget acts, when proposed tax cuts commanded majority support but not the necessary three-fifths majority to suspend the Byrd Rule. For example, many of the provisions of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 would have expired as soon as fiscal year 2010 if not extended. The provisions that were to expire including the $1000 per child tax credit, the 10% income tax bracket for low-income workers, and the deduction for state and local sales taxes paid. The expiration dates in those Acts were inserted in order to avoid Byrd Rule points of order. Provisions against which a Byrd Rule point of order is sustained are colloquially referred to as &quot;Byrd droppings&quot;.

==Impoundment==
Title X of the Act, also known as the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, specifies that the president may request that Congress rescind appropriated funds. If both the Senate and the House of Representatives have not approved a rescission proposal (by passing legislation) within forty-five days of continuous session, any funds being withheld must be made available for obligation. Congress is not required to vote on the request and has ignored most presidential requests. In response, some have called for a line item veto to strengthen the rescission power and force Congress to vote on the disputed funds.

The Act was passed because Congressional representatives thought that President Nixon had abused his power of impoundment by withholding funds for programs he opposed. The Act, especially after &quot;Train v. City of New York&quot; (1975), effectively removed the presidential power of impoundment.

In late November 2019, the Impoundment Control Act made news during the Trump impeachment investigation, when two budget office staffers resigned over their concerns over apparent improprieties regarding the hold of approved Ukraine military funds. Among the concerns was the questionable transfer of decision-making authority to Michael Duffey, a political appointee. Further emails released showed that Acting Undersecretary of Defense (Comptroller) Elaine McCusker emailed the White House Office of Management and Budget expressing her concerns beginning in July 2019 that the White House withholding funds from Ukraine could be a violation of the Impoundment Control Act.

On January 16, 2020, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a decision on the &quot;Matter of: Office of Management and Budget—Withholding of Ukraine Security Assistance.&quot; The GAO report found: 

&quot;In the summer of 2019, OMB withheld from obligation approximately $214 million appropriated to DOD for security assistance to Ukraine. (...) OMB withheld amounts by issuing a series of nine apportionment schedules with footnotes that made all unobligated balances for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) unavailable for obligation. (...) Pursuant to our role under the ICA, we are issuing this decision. (...) we conclude that OMB withheld the funds from obligation for an unauthorized reason in violation of the ICA.1 See 2 U.S.C. § 684. We also question actions regarding funds appropriated to the Department of State (State) for security assistance to Ukraine.&quot; The Center for Public Integrity found that &quot;OMB&#x27;s actions did not comply with any of the exceptions to the law&#x27;s demand that a president carry out congressional spending orders, the GAO said in its nine-page report. &#x27;OMB withheld funds for a policy reason, which is not permitted,&#x27; the report states. &#x27;Therefore we conclude that OMB violated&#x27; the act.&quot;

The ability of the President to impound funds again came into question during the 2025 United States federal government grant pause.

<doc id="299257" wikidata="Q455401" url="?curid=299257" title="Lloyd Bentsen">
<text>Lloyd Millard Bentsen Jr. (February 11, 1921 – May 23, 2006) was an American politician who was a four-term U.S. Senator (1971–1993) from Texas and the Democratic Party nominee for vice president in 1988 on the Michael Dukakis ticket. He also served as the 69th U.S. Secretary of the Treasury under President Bill Clinton.

Born in Mission, Texas, Bentsen graduated from the University of Texas School of Law before serving in the U.S. Air Force during World War II. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his service in Europe. After the war, he won election to the U.S. House of Representatives, serving from 1948 to 1955. He defeated incumbent Senator Ralph Yarborough in the 1970 Democratic senatorial primary and won the general election against George H. W. Bush. He was reelected in 1976, 1982, and 1988, and served as chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance from 1987 to 1993. In the Senate, he helped win passage of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and played a role in the creation of the individual retirement account. Bentsen sought the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination but was unable to organize an effective national campaign.

Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis chose Bentsen as his running mate in the 1988 presidential election, while the Republicans nominated Vice President George H. W. Bush and Senator Dan Quayle. During the 1988 vice presidential debate, Quayle responded to a question about his purported inexperience by comparing his time in office up to that point to that of John F. Kennedy, leading Bentsen to famously castigate Quayle: &quot;Senator, you&#x27;re no Jack Kennedy.&quot; Although Dukakis hoped that the selection of Bentsen would help the Democratic ticket win Texas, the Republican ticket won the state and prevailed by a wide margin in the nationwide electoral and popular vote. Bentsen considered running for president in 1992 but chose not to challenge Bush, who was popular after the Gulf War.

After defeating Bush in 1992, Clinton offered Bentsen the position of Secretary of the Treasury. Bentsen accepted, although he told Clinton that he would not serve a full four-year term in the office. As Treasury Secretary, he helped win the ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the passage of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. Bentsen retired in December 1994 and was succeeded by Robert Rubin. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1999.

==Early life==
Bentsen was born in Mission, Hidalgo County, Texas, to Lloyd Millard Bentsen Sr. (known as &quot;Big Lloyd&quot;), a first-generation Danish-American, and his wife, Edna Ruth (Colbath). The elder Bentsen&#x27;s parents, Peter and Tena, had come from Denmark to be homesteaders and farmers at Argo Township, near White and Brookings, South Dakota; they experienced many hardships, including loss of their first dwelling and belongings to fire, crop failure, and poor medical care.

Their son started out harvesting and taming mustangs for local farmers, then served in the United States Signal Corps during World War I. He and Edna accompanied his parents on their relocation to the &quot;citrus and vegetable utopia&quot; of Sharyland, Texas, where Peter Bentsen worked as a land agent for Sharyland&#x27;s founder, John H. Shary, and started a nursery seedling business. Lloyd Sr. and his brother Elmer helped with the family business, investing in land purchase, becoming the &quot;premier colonizers and developers of Hidalgo County&quot;, and gaining a substantial fortune from the &quot;Pride O Texas&quot; citrus trademark.

The brothers were directors of the Elsa State Bank; Lloyd Sr. was also a principal at several First National banks, president of the Rio Grande Valley Chamber of Commerce from 1944 to 1946, and played a major role in the unity and development of Cameron, Hidalgo, Starr, and Willacy Counties. Both brothers donated land that became the Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park. Eventually moving out of land development due to some disputes mainly resulting from crop failure due to a severe freeze, Lloyd Sr. invested $7 million in an insurance and financial holding company in Houston, of which his son, Lloyd Jr., served as chief executive until running for the U.S. Senate in 1971. In 1959, Texas Governor Allan Shivers appointed Lloyd Sr. major general in the Texas State Guard Reserve Corps. He died after a car accident, aged 95.

At age 15, Lloyd Jr. graduated from Sharyland High School in Mission. He was an Eagle Scout and received the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award from the Boy Scouts of America. Bentsen graduated from the University of Texas School of Law with an LL.B. degree in 1942 and was admitted to the bar, but joined the military for World War II. (When law schools accredited by the American Bar Association began requiring a bachelor&#x27;s degree for admission to law school in the 1950s and 1960s, law schools began awarding the Juris Doctor degree rather than the LL.B. As with most law school graduates of his era, Bentsen&#x27;s LL.B. was amended to reflect award of the J.D.)

==Military service==
After brief service as a private in intelligence work in Brazil, he trained to be a pilot and in early 1944 began flying combat missions in B-24s from Foggia, Italy, with the 449th Bomb Group. At age 23, he was promoted to major and given command of a squadron of 600 men, overseeing the operations of 15 bombers, their crews, and their maintenance units. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel before being discharged in 1947.

Bentsen flew thirty-five missions against many heavily defended targets, including the Ploiești oil fields in Romania, which were critical to the Nazi war production. The 15th Air Force, which included the 449th Bomb Group, destroyed all petroleum production within its range, eliminating about half of Nazi Germany&#x27;s sources of fuel. Bentsen&#x27;s unit also flew against communications centers, aircraft factories and industrial targets in Germany, Italy, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria. Bentsen participated in raids in support of the Anzio campaign and flew missions against targets in preparation for the landing in southern France. He was shot down twice.

Bentsen was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, one of the Air Force&#x27;s highest commendations for achievement or heroism in flight. In addition to the Distinguished Flying Cross, Bentsen was awarded the Air Medal with three Oak Leaf Clusters. Bentsen served in the United States Air Force Reserve from 1950 to 1959, and was promoted to colonel in 1953. (His father, a World War I veteran, served as a major general in the Texas Home Guard during World War II.)

==Early political career==

After the war, Bentsen returned to his native Rio Grande Valley. He served the people of his home area from 1946 to 1955, first as Hidalgo County Judge (a largely administrative post as opposed to a judicial one).

First elected in the Truman landslide of 1948, he served three successive terms in the United States House of Representatives. With the South, including Texas, still mostly home to yellow dog Democrats, winning the Democratic nomination was tantamount to election, and Bentsen was unopposed by Republicans in each of his three House campaigns. He became a protégé of Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn and developed a reputation as an excellent poker player.

A fiscal conservative, Bentsen favoured balanced budgets and was not afraid of increasing taxes to achieve them. Consistent with this position, Bentsen was among the most vocal supporters of using increased stimulus spending in order to combat stagflation, believing gains in employment would more effectively reduce the national debt than austerity measures that were being considered by the Ford administration. He balanced liberal positions on taxes and stimulus spending with moderate-to-conservative ones on most social, economic, and foreign policy issues.

Bentsen upset incumbent Ralph Yarborough, a liberal icon, in a bruising primary campaign for the 1970 Texas Democratic Senatorial nomination. The campaign came in the wake of Yarborough&#x27;s politically hazardous votes in favor of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and his opposition to the Vietnam War. Bentsen made Yarborough&#x27;s opposition to the war a major issue. His television advertising featured video images of rioting in the streets at the 1968 Democratic National Convention, implying that Yarborough was associated with the rioters. While this strategy was successful in defeating Yarborough, it caused long-term damage to Bentsen&#x27;s relationship with liberals in his party.

Bentsen&#x27;s campaign and his reputation as a centrist Democrat served to alienate him not only from supporters of Yarborough, but from prominent national liberals, as well. Indeed, during the 1970 Senate race, the Keynesian economist John Kenneth Galbraith endorsed the Republican candidate, then U.S. Representative and future president George H. W. Bush, arguing that if Bentsen were elected to the Senate, he would invariably become the face of a new, more moderate-to-conservative Texas Democratic Party and that the long-term interests of Texas liberalism demanded Bentsen&#x27;s defeat. Nevertheless, Bentsen convincingly won the general election against Bush with 53.5% of the vote.

==Political career==
===1976 presidential campaign===
Beginning in 1974, Bentsen campaigned for the Democratic presidential nomination. In 1974 he visited 30 states and raised $350,000 at a single fundraiser in Texas. Bentsen formally announced his candidacy on February 17, 1975, and in the early part of that year he had already raised over $1 million for his campaign; only George Wallace of Alabama and Henry M. &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson of Washington state had raised more money by that point. Bentsen did not organize effectively on a national level, and many observers believed the freshman senator was running without any real hope of winning the nomination, hoping instead to secure a vice-presidential nomination.

Wallace and Jackson were considered to be the two main contenders for the moderate to conservative voters to whom Bentsen would appeal; early in the campaign few foresaw Jimmy Carter of Georgia also effectively appealing to that group. By October 1975, Bentsen, generating little national attention or significance in the polls, scaled back his campaign to a limited effort in areas of 8 to 10 states, hoping for a deadlocked convention. In the first state contest Bentsen vigorously contested, Mississippi, he managed only 1.6% of the vote. Two weeks later Bentsen staked the remainder of his campaign and resources in neighboring Oklahoma but finished third with only 12%. A few days later Bentsen shut down his national campaign, staying in the race only as a favorite son in Texas. In the May 1, 1976, primary, Jimmy Carter won 92 of Texas&#x27;s 98 delegates. The eventual nominee and president, Carter was later quoted as saying he had expected a much stronger showing by Bentsen but that Bentsen&#x27;s failure to campaign nationally had ended his hopes.

===Senate career===

Bentsen was overwhelmingly reelected to the Senate in 1976, 1982, and 1988. He defeated sitting Republican congressmen from safe House seats in all four of his Senate elections, including Bush in 1970. In 1976, he ended the career of Alan Steelman of Dallas. In 1982, he defeated James M. Collins of Dallas, who had first dispatched the strongly conservative State Senator Walter Mengden of Houston in the Republican primary. In 1988, he defeated Beau Boulter of Amarillo. Bentsen was also on the ballot as the Democratic vice presidential nominee that year; he could seek both offices under the 1960 &quot;Johnson law&quot; in Texas.

===1988 vice presidential campaign===
Bentsen was briefly thought of as among Walter Mondale&#x27;s short list of possible vice presidential candidates in 1984. In the end, Mondale chose New York U.S. Representative Geraldine Ferraro as his running mate.
In 1988, Governor Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts chose Bentsen to be his running mate in that year&#x27;s presidential election, beating out Ohio Senator John Glenn, who was considered the early favorite. Bentsen was selected in large part to try to lure away the state of Texas and its electoral vote for the Democrats, even with fellow Texan George H. W. Bush at the top of the Republican ticket. Because of Bentsen&#x27;s status as something of an elder statesman who was more experienced in electoral politics, many believed Dukakis&#x27;s selection of Bentsen as his running mate was a mistake in that Bentsen, number two on the ticket, appeared more presidential than did Dukakis. During the vice presidential debate (see below), Republican vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle spent most of his speaking time criticizing Dukakis as too liberal while avoiding a match up with the seasoned Bentsen. One elector in West Virginia even cast a ballot for him rather than Dukakis, giving Bentsen one electoral vote for president.

Bentsen was responsible for one of the most widely discussed moments of the campaign during the vice presidential televised debate with fellow Senator Dan Quayle. In answering a question about his experience, Quayle stated that he had as much political experience as John F. Kennedy had when he ran for the presidency. Bentsen, at the age of 67, retorted, &quot;Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you&#x27;re no Jack Kennedy.&quot; Quayle replied, &quot;That was really uncalled for, Senator.&quot; Bentsen responded, &quot;You&#x27;re the one that was making the comparison, Senator.&quot; Peter Goldman and Tom Mathews wrote in &quot;The Quest for the Presidency 1988&quot; that Bentsen &quot;was the forgotten man&quot; of the campaign until the exchange with Quayle. Thereafter, his &quot;gray solidity&quot; was &quot;made luminescent by the pallor of the other three men&quot;, and questions were raised as to how well Bentsen really knew Kennedy. Some stated that they only had a nodding acquaintance. Bentsen had in fact considered in advance how to respond, because Congressman Dennis E. Eckart, who played Quayle in Bentsen&#x27;s rehearsals, knew that Quayle had previously compared himself to Kennedy, so he worked it into Bentsen&#x27;s debate preparation. Quayle had been prepped by Senator Bob Packwood, as Packwood served with Bentsen on the Senate Finance Committee.

The Dukakis-Bentsen ticket lost the election. Bentsen was unable to swing his home state, with 43 percent of the Texas vote going for the Dukakis ticket while Bush and Quayle took 56 percent; however, he was simultaneously reelected to the United States Senate with 59 percent of the vote. Bentsen considered running for president in the 1992 presidential election, but he, along with many other Democrats, backed out because of Bush&#x27;s apparent popularity following the 1991 Gulf War. A poor economy in 1991–1992 eroded Bush&#x27;s standing among voters and he ended up losing the election to Bill Clinton.

===Secretary of the Treasury===
Appointed to Clinton&#x27;s cabinet as Secretary of the Treasury, Bentsen helped win crucial Republican votes to pass the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Bentsen also was pivotal in winning passage of the 1994 crime bill, the Federal Assault Weapon Ban, which temporarily banned assault rifles.

After the resignation of Les Aspin in early 1994, Bentsen was seriously considered for the position of Secretary of Defense. But this prospect did not materialize, and William Perry, then Deputy Secretary of Defense, was chosen to succeed Aspin. In early December 1994, Bentsen announced his retirement as Secretary of the Treasury. Before election day he had discussed with President Clinton that he was not prepared to stay in office through the end of Clinton&#x27;s first term in 1997. He was succeeded in the position by Robert Rubin.

==Later life and death==
In 1995, former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said in an interview with Larry King when asked which Democrats she admired: &quot;I like Lloyd Bentsen very much indeed, I was sad when he resigned. He&#x27;s a real marvelous politician, a person of great dignity, a person we can look up to, respect and like as well.&quot;

In 1998, Bentsen experienced two strokes, which left him needing a wheelchair. In 1999, President Clinton awarded Bentsen the Presidential Medal of Freedom, one of the nation&#x27;s highest honors given to civilians. Clinton singled out Bentsen for applause during his final State of the Union address in 2000, saying: &quot;In 1993 we began to put our fiscal house in order with the Deficit Reduction Act, which you&#x27;ll all remember won passages in both Houses by just a single vote. Your former colleague, my first Secretary of the Treasury, led that effort and sparked our long boom. He&#x27;s here with us tonight. Lloyd Bentsen, you have served America well, and we thank you.&quot; Bentsen appeared in the summer of 2004 at the portrait unveilings at the White House of Clinton and former First Lady Senator Hillary Clinton.

Bentsen died on May 23, 2006, at his home in Houston at the age of 85, from stroke-related complications. He was survived by his wife, the former Beryl Ann Longino, three children, and seven grandchildren. His memorial service was held on May 30 at the First Presbyterian Church of Houston, where Bentsen and his wife had been members for many years, and was presided over by his then-pastor, William Vanderbloemen. He is interred in Forest Park Lawndale Cemetery. Former president Clinton delivered a eulogy.

==Legacy==
As a freshman Senator, Bentsen guided to passage the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), a long-stalled pension reform bill providing federal protections for the pensions of American workers. He also championed the creation of Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), legislation improving access to health care for low income women and children, and tax incentives for independent oil and gas producers to reduce dependence on foreign oil. In recognition of his success in securing federal funding, two hundred seventy miles of U.S. Highway 59, from I-35 to I-45 in Texas (between Laredo and Houston, respectively), are officially named Senator Lloyd Bentsen Highway.

As a primary architect of the Clinton economic plan, Bentsen contributed to a $500 billion reduction in the deficit, launching the longest period of economic growth since World War II. More than 5 million new jobs were created during his tenure as Secretary. His legacy also includes many water, wastewater and other infrastructure projects in the impoverished colonias of south Texas, the preservation of natural areas across the state, and major funding for numerous medical facilities. Bentsen&#x27;s retort to Vice President Dan Quayle during the 1988 vice presidential debate, &quot;You&#x27;re no Jack Kennedy&quot;, has entered the lexicon as a widely used phrase to deflate politicians who are perceived as thinking too highly of themselves. Bentsen is also known for coining the term astroturfing.

Bentsen&#x27;s family continues to be active in politics. His nephew, Ken Bentsen, was a U.S. Representative (D) from 1995 to 2003 in Texas&#x27;s 25th District, and a U.S. Senate candidate in 2002.

<doc id="299259" wikidata="Q952064" url="?curid=299259" title="Roman currency">
<text>Roman currency for most of Roman history consisted of gold, silver, bronze, orichalcum and copper coinage. From its introduction during the Republic, in the third century BC, through Imperial times, Roman currency saw many changes in form, denomination, and composition. A feature was the inflationary debasement and replacement of coins over the centuries. Notable examples of this followed the reforms of Diocletian. This trend continued with Byzantine currency.

Due to the economic power and longevity of the Roman state, Roman currency was widely used throughout western Eurasia and northern Africa from classical times into the Middle Ages. It served as a model for the currencies of the Muslim caliphates and the European states during the Middle Ages and the Modern Era. Roman currency names survive today in many countries via the Carolingian monetary system, such as the dinar (from the &quot;denarius&quot; coin), the British pound (a translation of the Roman &quot;libra&quot;, a unit of weight), the peso (also a translation of &quot;libra&quot;), and the words for the general concept of money in the Iberian Romance languages (e.g. Spanish &#x27; and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]&#x27;).

==Authority to mint coins==

The manufacture of coins in the Roman culture, dating from about the 4th century BC, significantly influenced later development of coin minting in Europe. The origin of the word &quot;mint&quot; is ascribed to the manufacture of silver coin at Rome in 269 BC near the temple of Juno Moneta. This goddess became the personification of money, and her name was applied both to money and to its place of manufacture. Roman mints were spread widely across the Empire, and were sometimes used for propaganda purposes. The populace often learned of a new Roman Emperor when coins appeared with the new emperor&#x27;s portrait. Some of the emperors and usurpers who ruled only for a short time made sure that a coin bore their image; the usurper Quietus, for example, ruled only part of the Roman Empire from 260 to 261 AD, and yet he issued thirteen coins bearing his image from three mints. The Romans cast their larger copper coins in clay moulds carrying distinctive markings, not because they did not know about striking, but because it was not suitable for such large masses of metal.

==Roman Republic: c. 500 – 27 BC==

Roman adoption of metallic commodity money was a late development in monetary history. Bullion bars and ingots were used as money in Mesopotamia since the 7th millennium BC; and Greeks in Asia Minor had pioneered the use of coinage (which they employed in addition to other more primitive, monetary mediums of exchange) as early as the 7th century BC. 
Coinage proper was only introduced by the republican government . The greatest city of the Magna Graecia region in southern Italy, and several other Italian cities, already had a long tradition of using coinage by this time and produced them in large quantities during the 4th century BC to pay for their wars against the inland Italian groups encroaching on their territory. For these reasons, the Romans would have certainly known about coinage systems long before their government actually introduced them. Eventually, the economic conditions of the Second Punic War forced the Romans to fully adopt a coinage system.

The type of money introduced by Rome was unlike that found elsewhere in the ancient Mediterranean. It combined a number of uncommon elements. One example is the large bronze bullion, the &#x27; (Latin for &quot;signed bronze&quot;). It measured about and weighed around , being made out of a highly leaded tin bronze. Although similar metal currency bars had been produced in Italy and northern Etruscan areas, these had been made of &#x27;, an unrefined metal with a high iron content.

Along with the &quot;aes signatum&quot;, the Roman state also issued a series of bronze and silver coins that emulated the styles of those produced in Greek cities. Produced using the manner of manufacture then utilised in Greek Naples, the designs of these early coins were also heavily influenced by Greek designs.

The designs on the coinage of the Republican period displayed a &quot;solid conservatism&quot;, usually illustrating mythical scenes or personifications of various gods and goddesses.

==Imperial period: 27 BC – AD 476==
===Iconography===
A significant advancement in coin imagery occurred when Julius Caesar issued coins bearing his own portrait. While previous moneyers had issued coins featuring portraits of their ancestors, Caesar&#x27;s coinage marked the third instance in Roman history where a living individual was depicted. This innovative approach to coin design further amplified the use of propaganda and personal representation in currency during that time. Although living Romans had appeared on coinage before, in the words of Clare Rowan (2019) &quot;The appearance of Caesar&#x27;s portrait on Roman denarii in 44 BC is often seen as a revolutionary moment in Roman history...&quot; The appearance of Julius Caesar implemented a new standard, and the tradition continued following Caesar&#x27;s assassination, although the Roman emperors from time to time also produced coins featuring the traditional deities and personifications found on earlier coins. The image of the emperor took on a special importance in the centuries that followed, because during the Empire the emperor embodied the state and its policies. The names of moneyers continued to appear on the coins until the middle of Augustus&#x27; reign. Although the duty of moneyers during the Empire is not known, since the position was not abolished, it is believed that they still had some influence over the imagery of the coins.

The main focus of the imagery during the Empire was on the portrait of the emperor. Coins were an important means of disseminating this image throughout the Empire. Coins often attempted to make the emperor appear god-like through associating the emperor with attributes normally seen in divinities, or emphasizing the special relationship between the emperor and a particular deity by producing a preponderance of coins depicting that deity. During his campaign against Pompey, Caesar issued a variety of types that featured images of either Venus or Aeneas, attempting to associate himself with his divine ancestors. An example of an emperor who went to an extreme in proclaiming divine status was Commodus. In AD 192, he issued a series of coins depicting his bust clad in a lion-skin (the usual depiction of Hercules) on the obverse, and an inscription proclaiming that he was the Roman incarnation of Hercules on the reverse. Although Commodus was excessive in his depiction of his image, this extreme case is indicative of the objective of many emperors in the exploitation of their portraits. While the emperor is by far the most frequent portrait on the obverse of coins, heirs apparent, predecessors, and other family members, such as empresses, were also featured. To aid in succession, the legitimacy of an heir was affirmed by producing coins for that successor. This was done from the time of Augustus till the end of the Empire.
Featuring the portrait of an individual on a coin, which became legal in 44 BC, caused the coin to be viewed as embodying the attributes of the individual portrayed. Cassius Dio wrote that following the death of Caligula the Senate demonetized his coinage and ordered that they be melted. Regardless of whether or not this actually occurred, it demonstrates the importance and meaning that was attached to the imagery on a coin. The philosopher Epictetus jokingly wrote: &quot;Whose image does this sestertius carry? Trajan&#x27;s? Give it to me. Nero&#x27;s? Throw it away, it is unacceptable, it is rotten.&quot; Although the writer did not seriously expect people to get rid of their coins, this quotation demonstrates that the Romans attached a moral value to the images on their coins. Unlike the obverse, which during the Imperial period almost always featured a portrait, the reverse was far more varied in its depiction. During the late Republic there were often political messages to the imagery, especially during the periods of civil war. However, by the middle of the Empire, although there were types that made important statements, and some that were overtly political or propagandistic in nature, the majority of the types were stock images of personifications or deities. While some images can be related to the policy or actions of a particular emperor, many of the choices seem arbitrary and the personifications and deities were so prosaic that their names were often omitted, as they were readily recognizable by their appearance and attributes alone.

It can be argued that within this backdrop of mostly indistinguishable types, exceptions would be far more pronounced. Atypical reverses are usually seen during and after periods of war, at which time emperors make various claims of liberation, subjugation, and pacification. Some of these reverse images can clearly be classified as propaganda. An example struck by emperor Philip the Arab in 244 features a legend proclaiming the establishment of peace with Persia; in truth, Rome had been forced to pay large sums in tribute to the Persians.

Although it is difficult to make accurate generalizations about reverse imagery, as this was something that varied by emperor, some trends do exist. An example is reverse types of the military emperors during the second half of the third century, where virtually all of the types were the common and standard personifications and deities. A possible explanation for the lack of originality is that these emperors were attempting to present conservative images to establish their legitimacy, something that many of these emperors lacked. Although these emperors relied on traditional reverse types, their portraits often emphasized their authority through stern gazes, and even featured the bust of the emperor clad in armor.

==Value and composition==
Unlike most modern coins, Roman coins had (at least in the early centuries) significant intrinsic value. However, while the gold and silver issues contained precious metals, the value of a coin could be slightly higher than its precious metal content, so they were not, strictly speaking, equivalent to bullion. Also, over the course of time the purity and weight of the silver coins were reduced. Estimates of the value of the &quot;denarius&quot; range from 1.6 to 2.85 times its metal content, thought to equal the purchasing power of 10 modern British pound sterling at the beginning of the Roman Empire to around 18 pound sterling by its end (comparing bread, wine, and meat prices) and, over the same period, around one to three days&#x27; pay for a legionary.

The coinage system that existed in Egypt until the time of Diocletian&#x27;s monetary reform was a closed system based upon the heavily debased tetradrachm. Although the value of these tetradrachms can be reckoned as being equivalent to that of the &quot;denarius&quot;, their precious metal content was always much lower. Elsewhere also, not all coins that circulated contained precious metals, as the value of these coins was too great to be convenient for everyday purchases. A dichotomy existed between the coins with an intrinsic value and those with only a token value. This is reflected in the infrequent and inadequate production of bronze coinage during the Republic, where from the time of Sulla till the time of Augustus no bronze coins were minted at all; even during the periods when bronze coins were produced, their workmanship was sometimes very crude and of low quality.

===Debasement===

The type of coins issued changed under the coinage reform of Diocletian, the heavily debased &quot;antoninianus&quot; (double &quot;denarius&quot;) was replaced with a variety of new denominations, and a new range of imagery was introduced that attempted to convey different ideas. The new government set up by Diocletian was a Tetrarchy, or rule by four, with each emperor receiving a separate territory to rule.

The new imagery includes a large, stern portrait that is representative of the emperor. This image was not meant to show the actual portrait of a particular emperor, but was instead a character that embodied the power that the emperor possessed. The reverse type was equally universal, featuring the spirit (or genius) of the Romans. The introduction of a new type of government and a new system of coinage represents an attempt by Diocletian to return peace and security to Rome, after the previous century of constant warfare and uncertainty. Diocletian characterizes the emperor as an interchangeable authority figure by depicting him with a generalized image. He tries to emphasize unity amongst the Romans by featuring the spirit of Romans (Sutherland 254). The reverse types of coins of the late Empire emphasized general themes, and discontinued the more specific personifications depicted previously. The reverse types featured legends that proclaimed the glory of Rome, the glory of the Roman army, victory against the &quot;barbarians&quot;, the restoration of happy times, and the greatness of the emperor.

These general types persisted even after the adoption of Christianity as the state religion of the Roman Empire. Muted Christian imagery, such as standards that featured Christograms (the Chi Rho monogram for Jesus Christ&#x27;s name in Greek) were introduced, but with a few rare exceptions, there were no explicitly Christian themes. From the time of Constantine the Great until the &quot;end&quot; of the Roman Empire, coins featured almost indistinguishable idealized portraits and general proclamations of greatness.

Although the &quot;denarius&quot; remained the backbone of the Roman economy from its introduction a few years before 211 BC until it ceased to be normally minted in the middle of the third century, the purity and weight of the coin slowly, but inexorably, decreased. The problem of debasement in the Roman economy appears to be pervasive, although the severity of the debasement often paralleled the strength or weakness of the Empire. While it is not clear why debasement became such a common occurrence for the Romans, it&#x27;s believed that it was caused by several factors, including a lack of precious metals and inadequacies in state finances. When introduced, the &quot;denarius&quot; contained nearly pure silver at a theoretical weight of approximately 4.5 grams, but from the time of Nero onwards the tendency was nearly always for its purity to be decreased.

The theoretical standard, although not usually met in practice, remained fairly stable throughout the Republic, with the notable exception of times of war. The large number of coins required to raise an army and pay for supplies often necessitated the debasement of the coinage. An example of this is the &quot;denarii&quot; that were struck by Mark Antony to pay his army during his battles against Octavian. These coins, slightly smaller in diameter than a normal &quot;denarius&quot;, were made of noticeably debased silver. The obverse features a galley and the name Antony, while the reverse features the name of the particular legion that each issue was intended for (hoard evidence shows that these coins remained in circulation over 200 years after they were minted, due to their lower silver content). The coinage of the Julio-Claudians remained stable at 4 grams of silver, until the debasement of Nero in 64, when the silver content was reduced to 3.8 grams, perhaps due to the cost of rebuilding the city after fire consumed a considerable portion of Rome.

The &quot;denarius&quot; continued to decline slowly in purity, with a notable reduction instituted by Septimius Severus. This was followed by the introduction of a double &quot;denarius&quot; piece, differentiated from the &quot;denarius&quot; by the radiate crown worn by the emperor. The coin is commonly called the &quot;antoninianus&quot; by numismatists after the emperor Caracalla, who introduced the coin in early 215. Although nominally valued at two &quot;denarii&quot;, the &quot;antoninianus&quot; never contained more than 1.6 times the amount of silver of the &quot;denarius&quot;. The profit of minting a coin valued at two &quot;denarii&quot;, but weighing only about one and a half times as much is obvious; the reaction to these coins by the public is unknown. As the number of &quot;antoniniani&quot; minted increased, the number of &quot;denarii&quot; minted decreased, until the &quot;denarius&quot; ceased to be minted in significant quantities by the middle of the third century. Again, coinage saw its greatest debasement during times of war and uncertainty. The second half of the third century was rife with this war and uncertainty, and the silver content of the &quot;antonianus&quot; fell to only 2%, losing almost any appearance of being silver. During this time the &quot;aureus&quot; remained slightly more stable, before it too became smaller and more base (lower gold content and higher base metal content) before Diocletian&#x27;s reform.

The decline in the silver content to the point where coins contained virtually no silver at all was countered by the monetary reform of Aurelian in 274. Some researchers think that the number 21 on the coins from those years (XXI in Latin or KA in Greek) means a standard for the antonianus set at twenty parts copper to one part silver. Despite the reform of Aurelian, silver content continued to decline, until the monetary reform of Diocletian. In addition to establishing the Tetrarchy, Diocletian devised the following system of denominations: an &quot;aureus&quot; struck at the standard of 60 to the pound, a new silver coin struck at the old Neronian standard known as the &quot;argenteus&quot;, and a new large bronze coin that contained two percent silver.

Diocletian issued an Edict on Maximum Prices in 301, which attempted to establish the legal maximum prices that could be charged for goods and services. The attempt to establish maximum prices was an exercise in futility as maximum prices were impossible to enforce. The Edict was reckoned in terms of &quot;denarii&quot;, although no such coin had been struck for over 50 years (it is believed that the bronze &quot;follis&quot; was valued at denarii). Like earlier reforms, this too eroded and was replaced by an uncertain coinage consisting mostly of gold and bronze. The exact relationship and denomination of the bronze issues of a variety of sizes is not known, and is believed to have fluctuated heavily on the market.

The exact reason that Roman coinage sustained continuous debasement is not known, but the most common theories involve inflation, trade with India (which drained silver from the Mediterranean world) and inadequacies in state finances. It is clear from papyri that the pay of the Roman soldier increased from 900 &quot;sestertii&quot; a year under Augustus to 2,000 &quot;sestertii&quot; a year under Septimius Severus, while the price of grain more than tripled, indicating a fall in real wages and moderate inflation during this time.

<text>Sir Henry Herbert (baptized 7 July 1594 – 27 April 1673) was Master of the Revels to both King Charles I and King Charles II, as well as a politician during both reigns.

== Biography ==

Baptised in July 1594, Herbert was the sixth son of Magdelen Herbert and Richard Herbert of Montgomery Castle. Richard was a younger brother of Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury and the poet George Herbert, both former members of the Parliament of England, and older brother of naval officer Thomas Herbert. Their family was related to the Herbert Earls of Pembroke, prominent figures in English government and society throughout the Jacobean and Caroline era. Edward Herbert was ambassador in Paris, and Henry joined him in 1619 and became involved in the case of Piero Hugon and the jewels of Anne of Denmark.

Herbert&#x27;s role as Master of the Revels involved reading and licensing plays and supervising all kinds of public entertainment. Officially, Herbert became Master of the Revels in 1641 but he had been doing the work of the office even earlier. Sir John Astley, the official Master from 1622 to his death in January 1640, had appointed Herbert his deputy the year that he was knighted in 1623. For this arrangement Herbert paid Astley £150 per year in return for the income that the office provided.

Since Herbert was responsible for licensing and also censoring plays, he had a powerful influence on English drama for two decades, 1623–1642. Herbert had barely gained the official position of Master in 1641 when the theatres were closed at the start of the English Civil War in August 1642. Herbert retained the office throughout the time it was dormant, down to the re-opening of the theatres at the Restoration in 1660. When Charles II allowed Thomas Killigrew and Sir William Davenant to form two theatre companies under royal patronage, the King&#x27;s Company and the Duke&#x27;s Company, in August 1660, Herbert complained bitterly at what he perceived as the violation of his rights, and started court actions; he was especially irate with Davenant, who had carried on clandestine theatrical performances in the 1656–1660 period, without Herbert benefitting. Over the next two years, Herbert&#x27;s claims were adjusted and the two royal companies had their privileges renewed by royal patent in 1662. Afterward, he was no longer the power in the theatre that he had been before.

==Other positions==
Charles I gave the manor of Ribbesford (in whose parish the Borough of Bewdley lies) to his brothers in 1627 and they passed it to Herbert. He was the Member of Parliament for Montgomery Boroughs in 1626 and Bewdley in 1640 (in both the Short and the Long parliaments), but was disabled from sitting by resolution of the Commons in 1642 because he put into execution the king&#x27;s commission of array. In 1646 at the end of the First Civil War he was considered a Royalist delinquent by the Parliamentarians and his estate was compounded.

After the Restoration in 1660, Herbert again sat for Bewdley (in the Cavalier Parliament) and held the seat until his death. He was a Justice of the Peace for Worcestershire by 1636 to 1646 and from July 1660 to his death. He was appointed High Sheriff of Worcestershire for 1648–1649 and was also a member of the Council of the Marches of Wales for 1633–?1646.

Herbert died on 27 April 1673 and was buried at St Paul&#x27;s, Covent Garden.

== Family and posterity ==
Herbert was twice married. He married firstly, in July 1625, Susanna daughter of Richard Sleford, a London clothworker, and widow of Edward Plumer, merchant tailor of London. By her he had one son who died in his father&#x27;s lifetime, and two daughters. Lady Susanna Herbert died in 1650.

Herbert married secondly, in 1650/51, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Robert Offley of London and Oadby, Leicestershire. By her he had three sons (one of whom died in his father&#x27;s lifetime) and five daughters. Lady Elizabeth Herbert survived him and died in 1698.

Herbert was succeeded by Henry, his son from his second marriage, for whom the barony of Cherbury was revived. Both he and his son served as Members of Parliament for Bewdley. Henry died in January 1709, and his son, another Henry, became 2nd Lord Herbert of Cherbury of the second creation. He died without issue in April 1738, and again the barony became extinct. In 1743 it was revived for Henry Arthur Herbert (c. 1703–1772), who five years later was created Earl of Powis. This nobleman was a great-grandson of the 2nd Lord Herbert of Cherbury of the first creation, and since his time the barony has been held by the Earls of Powis. However the Ribbesford estate passed to his cousin Charles Morley, who took the surname Herbert.

== Office-book ==
The surviving transcripts of Herbert&#x27;s &quot;office-book&quot; are among the most important documentary records of English Renaissance drama. Herbert recorded all of his activities as Master of the Revels, in particular his licensing of plays for performance and his organization of court performances. His detailed records provide modern scholars with dates for many plays of the period, as well as dates of performances at court, and evidence for the existence of lost plays. The office-book itself has been lost since 1818, but its information partially survives in incomplete eighteenth- and nineteenth-century transcripts.

When Herbert died in 1673, his papers, including the office-book, were stored at his home, the manor-house of Ribbesford, Worcestershire. In 1738, Herbert&#x27;s grandson, Henry Herbert, 2nd Baron Herbert of Chirbury died childless and the archive was bequeathed to another relative, Francis Walker, and was gradually dispersed over time. However, the office-book and other documents related to it were overlooked, remaining at Ribbesford in an old wooden chest where they were partially damaged by water leakage. In 1787, Ribbesford House was sold to Francis Ingram who discovered the chest and its contents.

In the next few decades, Ingram and his descendants permitted scholars to study the revels documents. The most important was Edmond Malone, who found the office-book to be partially moldered, but still readable. He published selections from it in his edition of Shakespeare (1790). Malone claimed to have made a full transcript of the office-book, but he only published a fraction of it, and his transcript has never been found. At some point, the scholar Craven Ord studied the office-book and transcribed a large number of entries from it but did not publish them. In the 1790s, George Chalmers published some extracts not published by Malone in 1799; however, although he did not acknowledge it, these may have been supplied to Chalmers by Ord. At some point before 1818, Thomas Ingram temporarily loaned the office-book to Reverend Richard Warner and his sister Rebecca Warner, and they published some extracts from it.

When Craven Ord died, his transcripts of the office-book were auctioned and ultimately ended up in the hands of Jacob Henry Burn, who was compiling notes toward a history of the Office of the Revels. Burn copied, or sometimes cut out and pasted, some of Ord&#x27;s records into his own notebook, which is now in the Beinecke Library. After his death, the Ord transcript was bought by J.O. Halliwell-Phillips, who also did not publish anything from it. The Ord transcript appeared to be lost until 1937, when R.C. Bald discovered fragments of it pasted into Halliwell-Phillips&#x27; notebooks, stored at the Folger Shakespeare Library. It was revealed that Halliwell-Philips had gone through the Ord transcript and cut out interesting items, apparently discarding the rest. In 1996, N.W. Bawcutt discovered a few more of Hallilwell-Phillips&#x27; cuttings in a notebook at Edinburgh University Library.

After 1818, the original office-book appears to have been lost. It was in the possession of Reverend Edward Winnington-Ingram, but it is not known what he did with it and it is no longer in the family&#x27;s papers. Halliwell-Phillips asserted that it was in the library of the Earl of Powis, but the Earl denied this; the Powis papers are now owned by the Public Record Office and the National Library of Wales and the office-book is not among them. N.W. Bawcutt, who published in 1996 a complete collection of all of the surviving Revels records, believes that the lost information might still be rediscovered some day: the office-book, Malone&#x27;s transcript, the remains of Ord&#x27;s transcript, and Chalmers&#x27; notebooks are all unaccounted for and might still come to light.

<text>Bangor City Football Club () was a Welsh football club from the City of Bangor, Gwynedd. 

Founded in 1876, Bangor City have been founder members of the North Wales Coast League, the Welsh National League, the North Wales Combination, the Welsh National League (North), the Northern Premier League, the Alliance Premier League and the League of Wales, as well as playing in the inaugural Welsh Cup. The team won the Welsh Cup eight times and the Welsh Premier League three times, as well as taking part in European competitions.

The club&#x27;s home colours were traditionally royal blue shirts, royal blue shorts and royal blue socks, although over the years home colours were varied to include royal blue and yellow and scarlet and Royal blue.

The club last played during the 2021–22 season in the Cymru North the second level of the Welsh football league system. On 30 November 2021 they were suspended from any football activity due to non-payment of staff wages. On 18 February 2022 the club announced they had withdrawn from the league and the Football Association of Wales confirmed the club&#x27;s results from the league that season has been expunged. The club subsequently failed to apply for tier 2 or tier 3 licences, leaving them unable to play in any Football Association of Wales league for the 2022–23 season.

==History==

===Pre-League of Wales era (1876–1992)===
Bangor City F.C. was one of Wales&#x27; older football clubs, and has played in European football, the English pyramid system and the Cymru Premier.

The club was a founding member of the North Wales Coast League in 1893, the Welsh National League in 1921, the North Wales Combination in 1930, the Welsh League North in 1935, the Northern Premier League in 1968, the Alliance Premier League (now National League) in 1979, and in 1992 the League of Wales.

In 1947 and 1950 Bangor challenged for election to the football leagues Third Division North yet failed on each occasion. In the 1961–62 season, they won the Welsh Cup, and consequently entered in the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup for the first time. In the first round, they were drawn against the Italian Cup winners, Napoli. In the first leg, played at Farrar Road, Bangor won 2–0; three weeks later, in front of a crowd of 80,000 in Naples, the result was 3–1 in Napoli&#x27;s favour. A playoff had to be played, at Arsenal&#x27;s Highbury Stadium, in London and AS Napoli won 2–1.

At the end of 1977–78 when Southport was relegated from the English Football League Fourth Division, Bangor City, Boston United and Wigan Athletic were considered for promotion in its place. Due to Wigan Athletic having installed crush barriers, they were elected ahead of Bangor and Boston in the same year Bangor was invited to the 1977–78 Anglo-Italian Cup.

In 1979–80 Bangor City was invited to compete in the Alliance Premier League, which would become the English game&#x27;s de facto fifth division.

On 12 May 1984 they became the first Welsh club to play at Wembley since Cardiff in 1927, when reaching the FA Trophy final against Northwich Victoria. The match finished 1–1. The replay was played in Stoke&#x27;s Victoria Ground and Bangor lost 2–1.

In 1985 the club returned to European football in the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, in the first round drawn against the Norwegian Football Cup winners, Fredrikstad. The first leg in Norway was a 1–1 draw, while the return leg in Bangor was a 0–0 draw, resulting in Bangor progressing to the second round on the &quot;Away Goal Rule&quot;, where the club was drawn against the Spanish side Atlético Madrid. The first leg in Bangor was won 2–0 by Atlético. In the return leg in Madrid, Bangor lost 1–0.

The captain of the club during that season was midfielder Mark Palios, who later became chief executive of the English Football Association during 2004–05.

===Early League of Wales years (1992–2007)===
In 1992 the club left the English football pyramid to join the new national League of Wales. In the second season the club were league champions and as champions, entered the UEFA Cup. They were drawn against the Icelandic champions, IA Akranes. Akranes won the tie 4–1.

In 1995 the club retained the League of Wales championship and this time drew the Polish runners-up Widzew Łódź in the preliminary round of the UEFA Cup. Łódź triumphed over City, winning 4–0 in Bangor and 1–0 in Łódź.

In 1998 the club were back in the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, having won the Welsh Cup under the management of Graeme Sharp. Between winning the Welsh Cup and playing their opponents, FC Haka, the manager and most of the team had left, so new manager John King had to put together a completely new side, a week before the start of the Welsh football season (and three-quarters of the way through the Finnish football season). Bangor were beaten 3–0 on aggregate. Bangor city qualified for the 1997–98 FAW Premier Cup but were knocked out by Newtown in the quarter finals

In 2006 the club made it to the Welsh Cup final where they were beaten by Rhyl 2–0 at Wrexham&#x27;s Racecourse Ground.

===Powell years (2007–2016)===
The club won back the Welsh Cup in 2008 defeating Llanelli 4–2 after extra time at Latham Park, Newtown. Victory in the Welsh Cup meant that Bangor had again qualified for Europe and in the following seasons UEFA Cup they were drawn to face FC Midtjylland of Denmark. The tie saw Bangor beaten 10–1 on aggregate.

Bangor ended the 2008–09 season with yet more silverware as they retained the Welsh Cup by defeating Aberystwyth Town 2–0 in a match held at Parc y Scarlets, Llanelli.

The 2008–09 Welsh Cup success meant that Bangor participated in the inaugural Europa League competition at the start of the 2009–10 season. They were drawn to face Honka Espoo in the second qualifying round and were eliminated at the first hurdle losing 3–0 on aggregate.

Bangor made it three Welsh Cup wins in a row in 2009–10 with a 3–2 success against Port Talbot in the Welsh Cup Final, again held at Llanelli.

In the 2010–11 Europa League campaign, Bangor City were drawn against Honka Espoo. They overcame the Finnish side in the Europa League second qualifying round with a 3–2 aggregate scoreline. Bangor succumbed to Portuguese side Marítimo in the third qualifying round. Marítimo won 10–3 on aggregate.

The 2010–11 season marked a significant change in the set-up of the Welsh Premiership, with Bangor one of the 12 sides (down from 18) contesting the championship. They won their opening 15 games of the season, eventually winning their first league title in 16 years on the final day of the season. This was achieved by beating TNS, 1–0.

By winning their competitive league, they were involved in the 2011–12 Champions League campaign. Bangor City were against HJK Helsinki in the second qualifying round but lost 3–0 at home. In the away fixture, Bangor City were beaten 10–0 in the game and 13–0 on aggregate. Bangor finished second in 2011–12&#x27;s Welsh Premiership, keeping in contention for the title until the final game of the season, a decider against TNS who won the league.

In July 2012 Bangor City forward Les Davies made the 32-man longlist for UEFA&#x27;s best player in Europe award.

2012–13 began with a 0–0 home draw against Moldovan side FC Zimbru Chisnau in the first leg of the UEFA Europa League, first qualifying round. The Citizens lost the away leg 2–1 to bow out. City finishing third in the league, losing the Welsh Cup Final 3–1 after extra time to Prestatyn Town and then being defeated days later in the European playoffs by Bala Town.

Bangor finished fourth in 2013–14. The team did qualify for 2014–15 Europa League but lost 8–0 on aggregate to Icelandic side Stjarnan. It heralded a slide during which the side was in real danger of relegation for much of the season. The team stayed up in tenth position. 2015–16 was another struggle for the blues, who ended up in ninth place.

In June 2016 it was announced that a Cheshire-based consortium was to take over, promising large investment in the team, plus ground improvements.

On 25 July 2016 Powell was sacked, according to a statement released by the club.

===The Vaughan era (2016–2019)===
In August 2016 Andy Legg was appointed manager of the club. His departure in November 2016 due to his inability to commit to a full-time contract paved the way for Ian Dawes. However, with Welsh Premiership licensing rules stating that every club&#x27;s head coach/manager must have, or be in the process of attaining, the UEFA Pro Coaching Licence and in the absence of such a qualification, Dawes was gone by March 2017. Gary Taylor-Fletcher then became player-manager. The Club qualified via the playoffs for the Europa League under Fletcher&#x27;s guidance with a 1–0 win at Nantporth against Cardiff Met.

In May 2017, Kevin Nicholson was named as manager with Gary Taylor-Fletcher as assistant. Nicholson holds the UEFA Pro licence. The Club qualified automatically for the Europa League for the second successive season, finishing second under Nicholson&#x27;s guidance as well as being beaten in the semi-final of the Welsh Cup.

In 2016 a company called VSM (Vaughan Sports Management), which became the main shirt sponsors of the club, took over the club. Although convicted criminal Stephen Vaughan Sr. was present at the launch of the new ownership, the new chairman Ivor Jenkins insisted that Vaughan – who is banned from being a company director – was not involved with running the club. Fellow criminal
and ex-professional, Stephen Vaughan Jr., was later appointed as Director of Football and a coach at the club.

On 26 April 2018 the FAW Club Licensing Appeals Body decided to revoke the club&#x27;s Tier 1 and UEFA license due to not meeting financial criteria meaning that they would automatically drop down to the second level of Welsh football the next season, despite a second-placed finish in the Welsh Premier League, and would not be able to compete for a place in the following season&#x27;s Europa League.

In June 2018 Her Majesty&#x27;s Revenue and Customs issued up a second winding up petition against the club. This was later dismissed as the tax owed had been paid, albeit late.

In October 2018 the club&#x27; auditors, the accountancy firm Salisbury resigned, with a public letter citing 11 points of concern in relation to how the club&#x27;s owners were managing the club&#x27;s financial affairs. These concerns included gaps in the clubs&#x27; accounts, missing financial documents and around a lack adequate documentation received in relation to cash shares totalling £258,000. The BBC reported that &quot;Those concerns relate to the transfer of 25,800 shares to the company Vaughan Sports Management Ltd, a move which gave the firm significant control of the club&quot;.

In March 2019, Vaughan Jnr returned to the club as chairman, having formerly been both Director of Football and interim Manager at the club.

In May 2019 the club were found in breach of various league and FAW regulations by the Football Association of Wales (FAW), fined and docked 42 points from their 2018–19 Cymru Alliance points total. The club had until 29 May 2019 to appeal against these findings. Should the appeal be unsuccessful the club will be relegated to Tier 3 of the Welsh league structure for the 2019–20 season. The club was also left facing a transfer embargo until 31 December 2019 and was facing a third winding up order from HMRC over further unpaid tax. The club and the FAW confirmed that an appeal had been lodged. The FAW confirmed on 5 June that the club were unable to appeal against the FAW Panel&#x27;s decision to place a transfer embargo on the club as the deadline for an appeal had lapsed - and as such the club was suspended from registering any professional players (or renewing current contracts) with immediate effect up to and including 31 December 2019. The appeal date was set for the 18 June where the original points deduction was nullified. The FAW confirmed that at the meeting the appeal panel took the decision to adjourn the hearing until 24 June 2019, at which point the panel would be reconvened to consider the appeal submitted by the club. The appeal found the club guilty of most of the original charges and issued revised penalties including a reduced 21-point deduction, which meant the club remained in the second tier on goal difference.

In June 2019 it was reported that the club had avoided the winding up order by paying the outstanding debt in full. However, on 5 August of that year Bangor were suspended from playing competitive matches pending an arbitration hearing on 16 August following allegations that they fielded an ineligible player the previous season. On 16 August 2019, Bangor City won their appeal against the FAW in Birmingham and were reinstated the 21 points that were originally deducted from them in the 2018–19 Cymru Alliance season, a campaign they finished in fourth spot.

In September 2019 the club announced that VSM had sold their shares in the club to an Italian-based consortium headed up by Italian musician Domenico Serafino.

===Domenico Serafino era (2019 onwards)===

Domenico Serafino took over the club on 2 September 2019. His son Francesco Serafino, a Bangor player, had appealed to him to rescue the club. 
Serafino brought in Argentine World Cup winner Pedro Pasculli as the new manager of the team. and he was given the task of helping Bangor back into the top flight. His first win was a 2–1 victory over Rhyl in November. Pasculli had been a roommate of Diego Maradona at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. 
Bangor used the January 2020 transfer window to bring in new players including former Barnsley player Hugo Colace. 
In April Serafino made a £5,000 donation to local hospital Ysbyty Gwynedd to help it fight the outbreak of coronavirus. The club finished the inaugural Cymru North season in fifth place in a season curtailed by the COVID-19 pandemic with the final table determined on a points-per-game basis. In June, Colace was appointed manager of the club.

The 2020–21 Cymru North season was postponed and then cancelled entirely due to Welsh government COVID-19 restrictions. In April 2021 the club was refused a Tier 1 licence on the basis of a failure to provide the club&#x27;s financial accounts as part of their application along with an issue in relation to coaching qualifications.
In October the club applied for a Tier 1 licence again for the 2022–23 season, Colace&#x27;s contract with club was terminated after a club investigation into his conduct and the team&#x27;s performance in the league that season. Colace contested the charges made against him by the club in a statement released on social media and highlighted the lack of payment of staff and players by the club&#x27;s president. Maturin Ovambe was appointed the club&#x27;s new head coach.

====Suspension from all football activity====
Concerns over unpaid wages for players and club officials were reported in the press, who noted similarities to a situation in 2020 where another club owned in Italy by Domenico Serafino, A.S. Sambenedettese had seen players not paid, the club declared bankrupt and expelled from the league. The club were summoned by the Football Association of Wales to a disciplinary hearing over the matter. The panel ruled that &quot;all outstanding monies&quot; must be paid within 31 days from 29 October 2021 - the club owed nearly £53,000 of unpaid wages to players and staff - with the sanction in the event of non-payment being the club would be banned &quot;from all football related activity&quot;. On 30 November the Football Association of Wales suspended the club from all football related activity after they failed to comply with the payment of outstanding monies. As the club were suspended from football their Cymru North match versus Buckley Town on 4 December was postponed, they were fined and had three points deducted from their points total for failing to fulfil a fixture. The club&#x27;s match against Prestatyn Town on 10 December was also subsequently postponed by the FAW with the club again fined with three more points deducted. The next match against Airbus was also postponed. Three more points were deducted moving them to the bottom of the Cymru North league table.

A temporary suspension of football in Wales over the festive season (due to COVID-19 Welsh government restrictions) saw the club not deducted any more points as all domestic games were postponed. On 7 January 2022 it was announced by FAW that the club had not applied for a licence to compete in the tier 2 Cymru North for the 2022–23 season, or at tier 3 level. On 14 January the club&#x27;s academy announced on social media that closing with immediate effect after no support was forthcoming from the club and there had been no evidence from the FAW or the club that the situation at the club was going to improve. Upon the restart of the season in January, the club&#x27;s match on 21 January against Holyhead Hotspur was also postponed with the club being docked a further three points. The club at that point only had five registered first team players. The following match was also postponed, and with another three points deducted the club now had no points at the bottom of the table.

====Withdrawal from Cymru North====
On 11 February the FAW announced that the club had until 19 February to pay all outstanding fines or they would be immediately expelled from the Cymru North. It also announced that in the event the club paid outstanding fines, they would have to play all subsequent league fixtures or they would also face immediate expulsion from the league. The next scheduled league match is due to take place on 25 February and the club had three players registered.

&quot;A club competing in the second tier of Welsh professional football&quot; and &quot;a club with a noteworthy history. They have had some spells in the international European tournaments&quot; was shortly afterwards advertised for sale with asking price of £1.25 million. The club was reported as Bangor City with the Daily Post noting the &quot;eye-watering price&quot; did not include the club&#x27;s ground which was leased from the council.

On 18 February the club announced in an official statement they had informed the FAW that they had withdrawn from the Cymru North for the 2021–22 season. They also noted plans to return to play for the following season. Later that day, the FAW confirmed that the club&#x27;s withdrawal had been accepted and its playing record in the league for the season had been expunged.

====Post league withdrawal====
The club failed to enter a team in any league for the 2022–23 season. At the start of August 2022, the club surrendered its lease on Nantporth Stadium. The club were also served with their first Gazette notice for a compulsory strike-off, the first step in Companies House striking off a company from its register.

The club was officially dissolved in January 2025, following a compulsory strike-off.

==Stadium==

===Maes-y-Dref (1876–1919)===
When the club was first founded, Bangor played their home games on a small field called Maes-y-Dref in the Hirael area of the city. However, visiting teams often protested about the condition of the playing area and the cramped conditions. Despite this Bangor remained at their Maes-y-Dref ground until being evicted to make way for allotments in 1919. Residential housing now stands on the site.

===Farrar Road (1919–2011)===

Needing to fulfill their home fixtures in the league the club used the Bangor Cricket Club ground at Farrar Road. The Farrar Road ground served as home to the club for many years afterwards and has hosted two Welsh Senior Cup Finals, in 1928 and 1953. The ground has also hosted various other domestic finals and tournaments over the years. Bangor played their last match at Farrar Road, a 5–3 win over Prestatyn Town, on 27 December 2011 before moving to Nantporth. An Asda supermarket now stands on the site.

===Nantporth (2012–2022)===

The club moved to a new stadium, away from the city centre, at the University&#x27;s former Nantporth playing field near the Menai Strait, completed in January 2012. The first game took place on 24 January, where Bangor hosted local neighbours Caernarfon Wanderers, the score ended 6–1 to the Citizens. In July 2012 Nantporth played host to Bangor City&#x27;s first European game at Bangor for 14 years; 1022 people attended to watch Bangor City take on FC Zimbru of Moldova. Starting in 2012–13 the ground became known officially as &quot;The Book People Stadium&quot; after a three-year deal with the literary company. The new ground hosted its first competitive international on 13 August 2013 as Wales U21 lost 5–1 to Finland U21, the first U21 international held in Bangor since 1983. Nantporth has hosted various other Welsh youth and schools matches and also gone on to host more Wales U21 games. In August 2015 Bangor University announced that a new partnership had been agreed with the club, announcing the new name of the ground as Bangor University Stadium.

It was announced in August 2022 that the club had surrendered its lease on the stadium.

==Support==
Bangor city was a club that could consistently pull crowds of over one thousand for home and away matches every season but usually averaged under eight hundred though that still made up a large chunk of the cities population for example the 1951/52 and 1967/68 North Wales Coast Cup finals with over 9000 fans
===Supporters&#x27; Association===
Formed in 2001, the Bangor City Football Club Supporters&#x27; Association (or BCFCSA) is independent of the club itself but its representatives are members of the management board, giving the fans a voice in the running of Bangor City. The association has been responsible for raising almost £70,000 for the club since its inception and regularly arranges travel for fans to away matches. BCFCSA membership is open to all supporters of Bangor City.

In April 2019 the Supporters Association voted overwhelmingly to create a breakaway club in order to protect football in the city from the Vaughan&#x27;s. They stated, &quot;“We want fans to reconnect with each other and restore the pride and feeling of being a supporter of our historic club. The new club is a creative and positive solution for an ever-changing and precarious situation. We are not disowning Bangor City FC or its history, the club is OURS, it belongs to the fans and local community. “Owners” will come and go but the people remain. Keep the faith.”&quot;
The new club, named Bangor 1876, were accepted into the Gwynedd League for the 2019–20 season.

<text>Sir Edward Herbert (c. 1591–1658) of Aston in Montgomeryshire, was an English lawyer and politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1621 and 1641. He was Attorney-General under King Charles I.

==Origins==
Herbert was the son of Charles Herbert of Aston, Montgomeryshire, and was a first cousin of Edward Herbert, Baron Herbert of Cherbury. His grandfather was Sir Edward Herbert (d. 1593) (great-nephew of William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke (1423–1469)), Constable of Aberystwith Castle (16 March 1543–4), High Sheriff of Montgomeryshire in 1557 and 1568, a member of parliament for Montgomeryshire in 1553 and 1556–57, and an Esquire of the Body to Queen Elizabeth I.

==Career==
He was admitted to the Inner Temple in November 1609 and was called to the bar in 1618. In 1621 he was elected a member of parliament for Montgomery. He was elected MP for Downton, Wiltshire in 1624 for the Happy Parliament and was re-elected in 1626 and 1629.

In April 1640 Herbert was elected MP for Reading and for Old Sarum and chose to sit for Old Sarum in the Short Parliament. He was re-elected MP for Old Sarum in November 1640 for the Long Parliament. Having been appointed Attorney-General he was instructed by King Charles I to take legal proceedings against various members of parliament who had been concerned in the passing of the Grand Remonstrance. The only result, however, was Herbert&#x27;s own impeachment by the House of Commons in 1641 and his imprisonment.

Later in life he lived in exile with the royal family in Holland and in France, becoming Lord Keeper of the Great Seal to King Charles II in April 1653, an office which he had refused in 1645. He resigned that office the next year. He died in Paris in January 1658, and was buried in the Huguenot Saint-Germain Cemetery.

==Marriage and progeny==
Herbert married Margaret Smith, widow of Thomas Carey of Sunninghill Park, Berkshire and daughter of Thomas Smith of Abingdon-on-Thames and Parson&#x27;s Green, Middlesex. Herbert&#x27;s sons included:
*Arthur Herbert, 1st Earl of Torrington (1648–1716);
*Sir Edward Herbert (c. 1648–1698).

<text>The Ozark Highlands Trail roams through parts of seven counties in northwest Arkansas. It stretches from Lake Fort Smith State Park, across the Ozark National Forest, to the Buffalo National River. The trail passes through some of the most remote and scenic portions of the Ozark Mountains, like the Hurricane Creek Wilderness Area. It also crosses White Rock Mountain, Hare Mountain, the Marinoni Scenic Area, and many other scenic spots.

There are long-term plans to connect the similarly named Ozark Trail in Missouri to the Ozark Highlands Trail in Arkansas, resulting in over of continuous trails through the Ozarks. The proposed route initially passed through 14 miles of wilderness area in the Buffalo National River park, and the National Park Service initially supported this route. However, they have since vetoed this proposed route.

<text>The Buffalo National River, in Northern Arkansas, was the first National River to be designated in the United States. The Buffalo River is long. The lower flow within the boundaries of an area managed by the National Park Service, where the stream is designated the Buffalo National River. The river flows through Newton, Searcy, Marion, and Baxter Counties, from west to east. The river originates in the highest part of the Boston Mountains of the Ozarks, flows out onto the Springfield Plateau near the historic community of Erbie, and finally crosses a portion of the Salem Plateau just before joining the White River. The Park is home to the state&#x27;s only elk herd. The upper section of the river in the Ozark National Forest is managed by the U.S. Forest Service and is designated as a National Scenic River and a National Wild River.

==History==
The Buffalo National River was established by an Act of Congress on March 1, 1972, ending the recurring plans of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to construct one or more dams on the river. The National River designation protects natural rivers from industrial uses, impoundments and other obstructions that may change the natural character of the river or disrupt the natural habitat for the flora and fauna that live in or near the river. Three segments totaling were designated the Buffalo National River Wilderness in 1975.

==Description==
At a point about above the Park boundary in Newton County, Arkansas, the Buffalo River begins as the Main Prong of Big Buffalo Creek. The river flows north through Boxley to Ponca, where it then begins an eastward trek across northern Arkansas to its confluence with the White River on the Marion-Baxter County line. Advanced canoeists and kayakers often refer to the section upriver from Boxley as the Hailstone River. This extremely challenging section of the river is floatable only during periods of high water and should be attempted only by those with solid whitewater skills.

Along the upper river, the gradient is steep and the water is fast, leveling and slowing as the river runs its course. The upper section has most of the whitewater rapids to be found along the river, and features dramatic karst topography including sink holes and caves, springs, and waterfalls, over tall sandstone and limestone bluffs, and many rock formations. At one point, a hike from the river up a narrow, boxed canyon leads to a waterfall, Hemmed-In-Hollow Falls, the highest of its kind between the Southern Appalachians and the Rockies. The river&#x27;s current also gives life to well over 300 species of fish, insects, freshwater mussels, and aquatic plants.

The Buffalo National River is a popular camping, hiking, canoeing, and fishing destination. Visitors may bring their own canoes or rent from several independent concessioners. Camping is generally allowed throughout the park with the following exceptions: the Hemmed-in-Hollow area, on Big Bluff, in historical structures, on private property within the park, or within of any trail or watercourse. Camping is also permitted on gravel bars and sand bars along the river. The National Park Service has a number of &quot;developed&quot; campgrounds along the river.

The National Park Service headquarters for the Buffalo National River is located in Harrison, Arkansas.

In 2012, C&amp;H Hog Farms was granted a permit to operate on a major tributary of the Buffalo River. The facility contained over 6,500 hogs, as well as storage areas for their manure. In 2019, the company reached a deal with the State of Arkansas to cease operations on the river. The then-governor of Arkansas, Asa Hutchinson, subsequently announced a moratorium on large confined animal feeding operations in the river&#x27;s watershed. In January 2020, the Arkansas Legislature struck down rules set by Hutchison banning similar operations on the river.

<doc id="299288" wikidata="Q1702713" url="?curid=299288" title="Lurgan">
<text>Lurgan () is a town in County Armagh, Northern Ireland, near the southern shore of Lough Neagh and roughly southwest of Belfast. The town is linked to Belfast by both the M1 motorway and the Belfast–Dublin railway line. Lurgan had a population of about 28,634 (38,198 District Area) at the 2021 UK census, and falls within the Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon district. For certain purposes, Lurgan is treated as part of the &quot;Craigavon Urban Area&quot;, along with neighbouring Craigavon and Portadown.

Lurgan is typical of many Plantation of Ulster settlements, with its straight and wide, planned streets, and is the home of a number of historic listed buildings, such as Brownlow House and Lurgan Town Hall. Lurgan Park is the largest urban park in Northern Ireland.

Historically, and after the Industrial Revolution, the town of Lurgan was known as a major centre for the production of textiles (mainly linen), something which continued steadily until that industry&#x27;s gradual decline in the late 20th century.

The development of Craigavon, the &quot;new&quot; city, had a major impact on Lurgan in the 1960s, at a time when much industry was attracted to the area.

==History==

The name Lurgan is an anglicisation of the Irish name &quot;An Lorgain&quot;, literally meaning &quot;the shin&quot;, but within the context of placenames refers to a &quot;shin&quot;-shaped hill or ridge (i.e., long, low and narrow). Previous names of Lurgan included &quot;Lorgain Chlann Bhreasail&quot; (anglicised &quot;Lurganclanbrassil&quot;, &quot;the long low ridge of Clanbrassil&quot;) and &quot;Lorgain Bhaile Mhic Cana&quot; (anglicised &quot;Lurganvallivackan&quot;, meaning &quot;the long low ridge of McCann&#x27;s settlement&quot;). The Mac Cana (McCanns) were a sept of the O&#x27;Neills and Lords of Clanbrassil prior to the Plantation of Ulster in the early 17th century.

Around 1610, during the Plantation—and at a time when the area was sparsely populated by Irish Gaels—the lands of Lurgan were granted to the English lord William Brownlow and his family. Initially, the Brownlow family settled near the lough at Annaloist; however, by 1619, they had already established a castle and bawn for their own accommodations on a nearby ridge, along with &quot;fair Town, consisting of 42 Houses, all of which are inhabited with English Families, and the streets all paved clean through also to water Mills, and a Wind Mill, all for corn&quot;.

Brownlow became MP for Armagh in the Irish Parliament in 1639. During the Irish Rebellion of 1641, Brownlow&#x27;s castle and bawn were destroyed, and he and his wife and family were taken as prisoners to Armagh, and then Dungannon, County Tyrone. The land was then passed to the Mac Cana clan and the O&#x27;Hanlons. In 1642, Brownlow and his family were released by the forces of Lord Conway. As the rebellion ended, they returned to their estate in Lurgan. William Brownlow died in 1660, but the family would continue their contributions to the development of the linen industry, which peaked in Lurgan in the late 17th century.

Theobald Wolfe Tone would often pass through Lurgan on his journeys, writing in 1792 — &quot;Lurgan green as usual&quot;.

===The Great Famine===
A workhouse was built in Lurgan, opening in 1841 under the stipulations of the Poor Law, which stated that each Poor Law Union would build a workhouse to give relief to the increasing numbers of destitute poor. In 1821, Lurgan&#x27;s population was 2,715; this increased to 4,677 within 20 years, by 1841. There were a number of reasons for this sudden surge in population; the opportunities provided by the booming linen industry of the day led many workers to abandon their likely-meagre living (in rural areas), relocating to Lurgan with the hopes of gaining employment. Furthermore, the ever-expanding town gave tradesmen the opportunity to secure work in construction of new structures and building, such as Brownlow House.

Eventually, the excess numbers of poorer workers moving into town resulted in issues of over-crowding, poor sanitation and a very low general standard of living. When the potato crop failed for a second time in 1846, the subsequent famine in-turn led to a workhouse which had exceeded its 800-person capacity, by the end of that year. In an attempt to alleviate the problem, a relief committee was established in Lurgan, as was customary in other towns. The relief committee raised money by subscriptions from local landowners, gentry and members of the clergy, with the funds being matched from Dublin. With this setup, food was purchased and distributed to the ever-increasing numbers of starving people via soup kitchens. In an attempt to provide employment, and thereby give the destitute the means to buy their own food items, Lord Lurgan devised a scheme of land-drainage on his estate.

The so-called &quot;famine roads&quot; were not built in Lurgan in the same way as the rest of Ireland, although land owners also provided outdoor relief by employing labourers to lower hills or repair existing road issues. During the period between 1846–1849, the famine claimed 2,933 lives in the Lurgan Union alone. The workhouse was situated on the grounds of what is now Lurgan Hospital, where a commemorative mural can be seen along the adjacent Tandragee Road.

===New city===

The town of Lurgan grew steadily over the centuries as an industrial market town, and, in the 1960s—when the UK government was developing a programme of new towns in Great Britain, to deal with population growth—the Northern Irish government also planned a new town to deal with the projected urban growth of Belfast. This was also to prevent an undue case of overcrowding in the city. Craigavon (a name unpopular with the Nationalist community) was designated as a new town in 1965, intended to be a linear city incorporating the neighbouring towns of Lurgan and Portadown. The plan, largely, failed; today, &#x27;Craigavon&#x27; locally refers to the rump of the residential area between the two towns. The Craigavon development, however, did affect Lurgan in a number of
ways. The sort of dedicated bicycle and pedestrian paths that were built in Craigavon were also incorporated into newer housing areas in Lurgan, additional land in and around the town was zoned for industrial development, neighbouring rural settlements such as Aghacommon and Aghagallon were developed as housing areas, and there was an increase in the town&#x27;s population, although not on the scale that had been forecast.

The textile industry remained a main employer in the town until the late twentieth century, with the advent of access to cheaper labour in the developing world leading to a decline in the manufacture of clothing in Lurgan.

===The Troubles===

Lurgan and the associated towns of Portadown and Craigavon made up
part of what was known as the &quot;murder triangle&quot;; an area known for a significant number of incidents and fatalities during The Troubles. By 2010 the town was one of the few areas in Northern Ireland where so-called dissident republicans have a significant level of support. The legacy of the Troubles is continued tension between Roman Catholics and Protestants, which has occasionally erupted into violence at flashpoint &#x27;interface areas&#x27;.

On 5 March 1992, a 1,000 lb truck bomb, believed to have been planted by the IRA, exploded in Market Street causing mass damage to commercial properties.

On 5 February 2020, the PSNI found a bomb on a lorry. The Continuity Irish Republican Army admitted they had planted it. They expected the lorry to be put on a North Channel ferry in January 2020.

==Geography==
Lurgan sits in the north-eastern corner of County Armagh in a relatively flat part of Ireland by the south east shore of Lough Neagh, on the border with County Down and less than 2 miles from the border of County Antrim. The two main formations in north Armagh are an area of estuarine clays by the shore of the lough, and a mass of basalt farther back. The earliest human settlements in the area were to the northwest of the present day town near the shore of the lough. When the land was handed to the Brownlow family, they initially settled near the lough at Annaloist, but later settled where the town was eventually built. The oldest part of the town, the main street, is built on a long ridge in the townland (&quot;baile fearainn&quot;) of Lurgan. A neighbouring hill is the site of Brownlow House, which overlooks Lurgan Park.

===Townlands===
Like the rest of Ireland, the Lurgan area has long been divided into townlands, whose names mostly come from the Irish language. Lurgan sprang up in the townland of the same name. Over time, the surrounding townlands have been built upon and they have given their names to many roads and housing estates. The following is a list of townlands within Lurgan&#x27;s urban area, alongside their likely etymologies:

Shankill parish:
* Aghnacloy ()
* Ballyblagh (from &quot;Baile Bláthach&quot; meaning &quot;flowery townland&quot;)
* Demesne (an English name – this townland was carved out of Drumnamoe and others, and includes Lurgan Park)
* Derry (from &quot;Doire&quot; meaning &quot;oak grove&quot;)
* Dougher (formerly &quot;Doucharron&quot;, probably from &quot;An Dubhcharn, Dúcharn&quot; meaning &quot;the black cairn&quot;)
* Drumnamoe (from &quot;Druim na mBó&quot; meaning &quot;ridge of the cows&quot;)
* Knocknashane (formerly &quot;Knocknashangan&quot;, from &quot;Cnoc na Seangán&quot; meaning &quot;hill of the ants&quot;)
* Lurgantarry (from &quot;Lurgain an tSamhraidh&quot; meaning &quot;summer ridge&quot; or &quot;ridge of the summer grazing&quot;)
* Shankill (from &quot;Seanchill&quot; meaning &quot;old church&quot; or &quot;Seanchoill&quot; meaning &quot;old wood&quot;)
* Taghnevan (formerly &quot;Tegnevan&quot;, from &quot;Teach Neamhain&quot; meaning &quot;Neamhan&#x27;s house&quot; or &quot;Neamhan&#x27;s church&quot;)
* Tannaghmore North &amp; Tannaghmore South (from &quot;an Tamhnach Mór&quot; meaning &quot;the big grassy field&quot;)
* Toberhewny (from &quot;Tobar Shuibhne&quot; meaning &quot;Sweeney&#x27;s well&quot; or &quot;Tobar Chainnigh&quot; meaning &quot;Cainneach&#x27;s well&quot;)
* Tirsogue (from &quot;Tír Sídheóg&quot; meaning &quot;land of the fairies&quot;)

Seagoe parish:
* Ballynamony (from &quot;Baile na Mónadh&quot; meaning &quot;townland of the bog&quot;)
* Drumnakelly (from &quot;Dromainn Uí Cheallaigh&quot; meaning &quot;O’Kelly&#x27;s ridge&quot;)
* Silverwood (an English name – formerly called &quot;Killinargit&quot;, from &quot;Coill an Airgid&quot; meaning &quot;wood of the silver&quot;)
* Turmoyra (from &quot;Tír Maighre&quot; meaning &quot;land of the salmon&quot;)

===Climate===
Lurgan has a temperate climate in common with inland areas in Ireland. Summer temperatures can reach the 20s °C and it is rare for them to go higher than . The consistently humid climate that prevails over Ireland can make temperatures feel uncomfortable when they stray into the high 20s °C (80–85 °F), more so than similar temperatures in hotter climates in the rest of Europe.
== Governance ==
Lurgan is part of the Upper Bann constituency for the purpose of elections to the UK Parliament at Westminster. This has long been a safe unionist seat and the current MP is Carla Lockhart of the Democratic Unionist Party.

Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly at Stormont are elected from six-member constituencies using proportional representation and using the same constituencies as for Westminster.

Lurgan town commissioners were first elected in 1855, and they were replaced by Lurgan Urban District Council following the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898. This effectively ended landlord control of local government in Ireland. The town council was abolished when local government was reformed in Northern Ireland in 1973 under the Local Government (Boundaries) Act (Northern Ireland) 1971 and the Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) 1972. These abolished the two-tier system of town and county councils replacing it with the single-tier system. Lurgan was placed under the jurisdiction of Craigavon Borough Council, and remained so until a new act streamlined and merged the various districts in 2015. Today Lurgan forms part of the new Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon District. The Lurgan area contains the following wards: Church, Donaghcloney, Knocknashane, Magheralin, Mourneview, Parklake, and Waringstown.

Seven councillors are elected to represent the Lurgan electoral area on Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council. The councillors for the DEA are:


==Demography==

For census purposes, Lurgan is not treated as a separate entity by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA). Instead, it is combined with Craigavon, Portadown and Bleary to form the &quot;Craigavon Urban Area&quot;. A fairly accurate population count can be found by combining the data of the electoral wards that make up the Lurgan urban area. These are Church, Court, Drumnamoe, Knocknashane, Mourneview, Parklake, Taghnevan and Woodville.

On the day of the last census (21 March 2021) the combined population of these wards was 31,068. The latest religious data published is from 2011 with an estimated population of 25,069 (27 March 2011) Of this population, 62.2% were from a Catholic background, and 33.7% were from a Protestant or other Christian background.

The town is divided along ethnic/political/sectarian lines with entire housing areas being almost exclusively Nationalist/Catholic/Irish or almost exclusively Unionist/Protestant/British. The north end of the town centre is considered Nationalist/Catholic, the south end is considered Unionist/Protestant, with the &quot;invisible dividing line&quot; starting at the end of Market Street and the beginning of High Street at Windsor Avenue and Union Street. In the 1980s there were two Unionist/Protestant enclaves in the north end of the town, Gilpinstown and Wakehurst. They have both since changed to become Nationalist/Catholic areas as Unionists/Protestants gradually moved out.

There was a Synagogue at 49 North Street for the Lurgan Hebrew Congregation, founded prior to 1906 by Joseph Herbert (originally Herzberg) from Tukums in Latvia, but this closed in the 1920s around the time of the founder&#x27;s death.

==Economy==
Lurgan has historically been an industrial town in which the linen industry predominated as a source of employment during the Industrial Revolution, and is said to have employed as many as 18,000 handloom weavers at the end of the 19th century, a figure significantly higher than the town&#x27;s resident population at the time. That particular branch of the textile industry declined as consumer tastes changed, but other textiles continued to be produced in the town providing a major source of employment until the 1990s and 2000s when the textile industry across the UK suffered a major decline as a result of outsourcing to low wage countries.

The large Goodyear fan-belt factory at Silverwood Industrial Estate was a product of the Craigavon development when large tracts of land in Lurgan, Portadown, and areas in between were zoned off for exclusive industrial use. The Goodyear factory closed in 1983 after failing to make a profit, resulting in the loss of 750 jobs. The facility was later partly occupied by Wilson Double Deck Trailers and DDL Electronics. Silverwood Industrial Estate continues to host other manufacturing and light engineering firms. Other industrial areas in the town are Annesborough and Halfpenny Valley (Portadown Road) industrial estates; areas in which growth has been limited compared to other industrial estates in the Craigavon Borough.

A key component of the Craigavon development was a central business district halfway between Lurgan and Portadown that would serve as the city centre for the whole of the new city. What was built was an office building, a court house, a civic building, and a small shopping centre alongside several acres of parkland that were developed around the newly created balancing lakes that also serve as part of the area&#x27;s drainage system. In the 1990s, the shopping centre was significantly expanded to form what is now Rushmere Retail Park, containing many major retail stores. This has had a detrimental effect on the retail trade in Lurgan in the same way that out-of-town shopping developments in other parts of Northern Ireland have damaged other traditional town centres. The town&#x27;s Chamber of Commerce is not functioning and has remained dormant despite numerous attempts to revive it.

==Culture and community==

===Cultural references===
There is a figure of speech used in Ireland – &quot;to have a face as long as a Lurgan spade&quot; – meaning &quot;to look miserable&quot;. The origins of this expression are disputed. One theory is that a &quot;Lurgan spade&quot; was an under-paid workman digging what is now the Lurgan Park lake. Another theory is that it could be from the Irish language &quot;lorga spád&quot; meaning the shaft (literally &quot;shin&quot;) of a spade.

The ballad &quot;Master McGrath&quot; concerns a greyhound of that name from Lurgan which became an Irish sporting hero. The dog was bought in Lurgan by the Brownlow family, and the song also mentions his owner Charles Brownlow, referred to in the lyrics as Lord Lurgan. Master McGrath won the Waterloo Cup hare coursing competition three times in 1868, 1870 and 1871 at a time when this was a high-profile sport. A post mortem found that he had a heart twice the size of what is normal for a dog of his size. He is remembered all over the town, including in its coat of arms. The dog was named McGrath after the kennel boy responsible for its care. A statue of him was unveiled at Craigavon Civic Centre in 1993, over 120 years after his last glory in 1871. The statue was relocated to Lurgan town centre in 2013. A festival is also held yearly in his honour. A Lurgan pub is also named after Master McGrath.

The town is a frequent recipient of derision by the BBC Northern Ireland comedy panel show The Blame Game.

===Community facilities===
Oxford Island is a nature reserve on the shore of Lough Neagh that includes Kinnego Marina and the Lough Neagh Discovery Center, which is an interpretive visitor centre offering information about the surrounding wildlife, conference facilities, and a café.

Lurgan Park, a few hundred yards from the main street, is the largest urban park in Northern Ireland and the second-largest in Ireland after Phoenix Park, Dublin. It used to be part of the estate of Brownlow House, a 19th-century Elizabethan-style manor house. In 1893, the land was purchased by Lurgan Borough Council and opened as a public park in 1909 by Earl Aberdeen, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. It includes a sizeable artificial lake and an original Coalbrookdale fountain. Today the park is home to annual summer events such as the Lurgan Agricultural Show, and the Lurgan Park Rally, noted as the largest annual motor sport event in Northern Ireland and a stage in the Circuit of Ireland rally.
Mount Zion House in Edward St, formerly the St Joseph&#x27;s Convent, is now a cross-community centre run by the Shankill Lurgan Community Association/Community Projects. It is funded by the Department for Social Development, the EU Special Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, and the Physical and Social Environment Programme.

==Landmarks==


Lurgan town centre is distinctive for its wide main street, Market Street, one of the widest in Ireland, which is dominated at one end by Shankill (Anglican) Church in Church Place. A grey granite hexagonal temple-shaped war memorial sits at the entrance to Church Place, topped by a bronze-winged statue representing the spirit of Victorious Peace. A marble pillar at the centre displays the names of over 400 men from the town who lost their lives in the First World War.

The rows of buildings on either side of Market Street are punctuated periodically by large access gates that lead to the space behind the buildings, gates that are wide enough to drive a horse and cart through. The town&#x27;s straight planned streets are a common feature in many Plantation towns, and its industrial history is still evident in the presence of many former linen mills that have since been modified for modern use.

At the junction of Market Street and Union Street is Lurgan Town Hall, a listed building erected in 1868. It was the first site of the town&#x27;s library in 1895, was temporarily used as a police station from 1973 and is today available for conferences and community functions.

Brownlow House, known locally as &#x27;Lurgan Castle&#x27;, is a distinctive mansion built in 1833 with Scottish sandstone in an Elizabethan style with a lantern-shaped tower and prominent array of chimney pots. It was originally owned by the Brownlow family, and today is owned by the Lurgan Loyal Orange District Lodge. A former lodge to the Brownlow House estate became the Brownlow Arms Hotel on Market Street, run by the McCaffrey family, which served as the US 5th Army&#x27;s Officers&#x27; Mess during WW2 but closed in the early 1960s. The adjacent Lurgan Park, now a public park owned by Craigavon Borough Council, used to be part of the same estate. The park is the venue for the Lurgan Park Rally.

===Religious sites===
The site of what is now Shankill cemetery served as a place of worship over the centuries. It began in ancient times as a simple double ring fort, the outline of which is still noticeable, and is today an historic burial site holding the remains of people who lived in the earliest days of the town&#x27;s existence, including the Brownlow family. Dougher cemetery is another old graveyard that was donated to the Catholic people by the Brownlows following passage of the Catholic Relief Act.

The two most prominent modern places of worship are Shankill Parish Church in Church Place and St Peter&#x27;s Church in North Street, the steeples of which are visible from far outside the town.

Shankill Parish Church belongs to the Anglican Church of Ireland. The original church was established at Oxford Island on the shore of Lough Neagh in 1411, but a new church was built in Lurgan on the site of what is now Shankill Cemetery in 1609 as the town became the main centre of settlement in the area. It was eventually found to be too small given the growth of the town, and the Irish Parliament granted permission to build a replacement in 1725 one mile away on the &#x27;Green of Lurgan&#x27;, now known as Church Place, where it stands to this day. It is believed to be the largest parish church in Ireland, and contains the only set of change ringing bells in County Armagh.

Following passage of the Catholic Relief Act, Charles Brownlow granted a site to the Roman Catholic parish priest the Reverend William O&#x27;Brien in 1829 for the construction of a church on Distillery Hill, now known as lower North Street. It was there that work began in 1832 on what is now St Peter&#x27;s Church.

In 1966, another Catholic church, St Paul&#x27;s, was built at the junction of Francis Street and Parkview Street. This was a radical departure from traditional church architecture with its grey plaster finish, copper roof, slim spire, hexagonal angles and modern design throughout. Many of its architectural features such as the copper roof and gray plaster finish are shared by the neighbouring St Paul&#x27;s School. It was designed to cope with the extra demand for worship space following the growth of the surrounding Taghnevan and Shankill housing estates.

The first Methodist church was built in Nettleton&#x27;s Court, Queen Street in 1778. It was found to be too small and a new church was built on High Street in 1802, and replaced by a newer building in front of it in 1826. This High Street Methodist Church was extensively renovated in 1910 and stands to this day sporting a simple facade.

==Education==
It was the late 19th century that saw the development of formal education in Lurgan and a significant move away from the less organised hedge schools of before.

Today, schools in Lurgan operate under the Dickson Plan, a transfer system in north Armagh that allows pupils at age 11 the option of taking the 11-plus exam to enter grammar schools, with pupils in comprehensive junior high schools being sorted into grammar and non-grammar streams. Pupils can get promoted to or demoted from the grammar stream during their time in those schools depending on the development of their academic performance, and at age 14 can take subject-based exams across the syllabus to qualify for entry into a dedicated grammar school to pursue GCSEs and A-levels.

As is common in Northern Ireland, most of the schools in Lurgan are attended mainly by children from one or other of the two main ethno-religious blocs, reflecting the existence of sectarian and political divisions in society. Some schools are in the Catholic &#x27;maintained&#x27; sector, i.e. maintained by the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools, and others are controlled directly by the state. Directly controlled state schools generally have a predominantly Protestant intake.

===Primary education===
* Lurgan Model Primary School (Controlled) – this school was part of the national schools programme proposed in 1831 in which each county in Ireland would have at least one school that would serve as an example to other national schools in the area and as a teacher training establishment (although teacher training did not take place at this particular school). Initially it had a multi-denominational intake, offered such services as night classes and industry-relevant vocational courses, and was enthusiastically supported by William Brownlow who is thought to have brought the school to the town. It was undermined, however, by church interests, which were opposed to its lack of ecclesiastical control, and criticism of the efficiency of its management, hence losing much of its earlier prestige as the premier educational establishment in the town. It is now co-educational, non-denominational and accepts pupils irrespective of race or religion.

* St. Francis&#x27; Primary School and Bunscoil Naomh Proinsias (Catholic Maintained)
* St Teresa&#x27;s Primary School (Catholic Maintained)
* St Anthony&#x27;s Primary School (Catholic Maintained)
* Tannaghmore Primary School (Catholic Maintained)
* Tullygally Primary School (Catholic Maintained)
* Carrick Primary School (Controlled)
* Dickson Primary School (Controlled)
* King&#x27;s Park Primary School (Controlled)

===Post-primary education===
* Lurgan College – a co-ed 14–18 grammar school, was established in 1873 as an all-boys school to provide what was known as &#x27;classical education&#x27; as opposed to the more practical vocational education on offer at the Model School. Its initial charter included a provision that &quot;no person being in Holy Orders, or a minister of any religious denomination shall at any time interfere in the management of the said school, or be appointed to serve as master&quot; and that no religious instruction was to take place during school hours.
* St Ronan&#x27;s College – A co-ed secondary school for 11–18-year olds. It was formed from the merger of St Mary&#x27;s Junior High School, St Paul&#x27;s Junior High School, and St Michael&#x27;s Grammar School. St Mary&#x27;s Intermediate School was built on Kitchen Hill after land was acquired from the Sisters of Mercy in 1955 and was opened in 1959 as an all-girls school. The nearby all-boys St Paul&#x27;s Intermediate School was opened in 1962.

*Lurgan Junior High School – A co-educational 11–14 High School.

A number of people from Lurgan also attend Lismore Comprehensive School and Brownlow Integrated College in Craigavon.

* Southern Regional College – Lurgan Technical College was renamed Lurgan College of Further Education, and subsequently merged with Portadown CFE and Banbridge CFE into the larger Upper Bann Institute of Further and Higher Education (UBIFHE). Further education in the region was consolidated further when this institution was merged with other FE colleges in Armagh, Newry and Kilkeel to form the Southern Regional College. It offers vocational courses as an alternative to A-Levels, and adult education services.

===Special needs education===
Ceara School provides education for pupils aged 3 through 19 who have severe learning difficulties.

===Football===
The town is home to NIFL Premiership club Glenavon, established in 1889 and based at Mourneview Park. In 1952, Glenavon became the first club outside Belfast to win the Irish League title, and picked up a further two titles in 1957 and 1960. NIFL Premier Intermediate League club Dollingstown play at nearby Planters Park.

Lurgan is also home to several teams which play in the lower leagues, with clubs such as Lurgan Town, Oxford Sunnyside and Craigavon City representing the area in the intermediate divisions of the Mid-Ulster Football League, while Derryhirk United, Hill Street, Lurgan BBOB and Goodyear play in the junior divisions.

Lurgan Celtic previously played in the NIFL Championship and Premier Intermediate League, but following financial difficulties, the club resigned from league football on 15 August 2019, and planned to resume senior activities from Mid-Ulster Junior Division 3 for the 2020–21 season.

===Other sport===

Boxing is a common sport among children and adults, with local boxing clubs including South Paw Boxing and Fitness club and The Fitness Factory.

Cricket has two clubs, Lurgan Cricket Club and Victoria Cricket Club. Rugby union is played by Lurgan RFC, who share their Pollock Park ground with Lurgan Cricket Club.

Tennis is played by Lurgan Tennis Club which is in Lurgan Park. Lurgan Golf Club is an 18-hole parkland course bordering on Lurgan lake.

The Lurgan Park Rally, inaugurated in 1980, was one of the largest motorsport events on the island of Ireland. However, the event has been on hiatus since 2017.

Lurgan Park is home to Lurgan Bowling Club who field lawn bowling teams in the NIBA, the NIWBA and the Veterans leagues.

==Railway links==
Lurgan railway station opened by the Ulster Railway on 18 November 1841, connecting the town to Belfast Great Victoria Street in the east and Portadown and Armagh in the west. The Great Northern Railway of Ireland provided further access to the west of Ulster which was then closed in the 1950s and 1960s from Portadown railway station.

Presently Lurgan railway station is run by Northern Ireland Railways with direct trains to Belfast Grand Central and as part of the Dublin-Belfast railway line. The Enterprise runs through Lurgan from Dublin Connolly to Belfast Grand Central, and a change of train may be required at Portadown to travel to or Dublin Connolly.

Railway access at Sydenham links into George Best Belfast City Airport on the line to Bangor.

==Road transport and public services==

Lurgan is situated by the M1 motorway connecting the town to Belfast. Bus services, provided by Translink, arrive and depart on a regular basis from bus stops on Market Street to Belfast, Portadown, Armagh, Dungannon, and surrounding areas.

Electricity is supplied by Northern Ireland Electricity which was privatised in 1993 and is now a subsidiary of ESB Group. The gasworks used to be in North St., but there is no longer any town gas since it was abolished in Northern Ireland in the 1980s by the Thatcher government for being uneconomical, although it was restored to the greater Belfast area in 1996. Water is supplied by Northern Ireland Water, a public owned utility.

==Media==
Lurgan is served by two weekly local newspapers. The Lurgan Mail, published by Johnston Publishing (NI), reports news and sport from around the local area. The &#x27;Lurgan and Portadown Examiner&#x27; which reported local news and sport was owned by Observer Newspapers NI Ltd, based in Dungannon. This business closed in 2017 and the newspaper ceased publication.

Before, the club played in the Cymru North after being relegated from the Cymru Premier in 2021–22 but withdrew ahead of the 2023–24 season due to the management and playing staff leaving over unpaid wages and a transfer ban by Fifa.

The club was founded in 1872 by Llewelyn Kenrick who would later go on to found the Football Association of Wales. Following several mergers through the club&#x27;s history, in 1992 it became Cefn Druids AFC with the amalgamation of Cefn Albion F.C. and Druids United. The club is one of the oldest and most successful in Wales, winning the Welsh Cup 8 times and competing in 14 finals, most recently in 2012. The club has seen a resurgence in recent times with a successful run in the top flight, securing their best ever league finish and winning the European Play-Off, taking them into the Europa League for the second time.

The team&#x27;s first choice strip is black and white striped shirts, black shorts and black socks. The second choice strip is red shirts, red shorts and red socks for the 2019–20 season. The club&#x27;s official kit is produced by Italian kit giant Errea with sponsorship by Wrexham Lager and Johnstown Tyre Service.

Planning permission for a 3,500 capacity stadium at the Rock, Rhosymedre, was given in March 2009, subject to approval from the Welsh Assembly and Health and Safety Executive. Delays to the beginning of construction put the project back by 12 months and the club moved into the new stadium in August 2010. The club has previously played at Plas Kynaston Lane in Cefn Mawr.

==History==
For a full history see; &quot;List of football seasons involving Cefn Druids and its predecessor clubs&quot;
The team take their prolific history from the famous old Welsh team Druids FC who were founded in the early 1870s. They had won the Welsh Cup on no less than 8 occasions and have finished runners-up five times but fell on hard times with the advent of professional football. Druids were ancient mystic men throughout Celtic civilisation and were closely associated with Wales.

===Club Formation===
It is claimed by the later club that Druids FC formed in 1872 when Plasmadoc FC merged with Ruabon Rovers and Ruabon Volunteers under the guidance of Llewelyn Kenrick. Contemporary sources refute this version of events.

It was reported that on 6 October 1872, the opening game of a Football Club for the district was played at Plasmadoc Park. Mr George Hampden Whalley was selected as the captain of the club. On 23 October 1872 a meeting was held by Ruabon Rovers at the Wynnstay Arms where the Club committee was selected. It included people like David Thomson and Dr Daniel Grey. George Hampden Whalley was elected as president. Whalley would later also hold this position when the club became Druids and at rival club Ruabon FC.

In February 1873 Ruabon Rovers played a fixture against Ruabon Volunteers, which shows these clubs were both still Active after the merger date proposed by the modern day club. Ruabon Volunteers were also known as the 2nd Denbighshire Volunteers so were actually a Military team.

In September 1873 the club was still known as Ruabon Rovers as evidenced in the annual meeting of the club, where a number of influential people, later associated with Druids were present and held key roles, such as David and George Thomson. The issue of the club&#x27;s foundation is further muddied when Llewelyn Kenrick was present at the founding of a football club in Ruabon in September 1873.

The name of the club appears interchangeable between Ruabon Rovers and Plasmadoc in 1873, and the club was often referred to as the Plasmadoc Club from 1874 up until 1876. When speaking in 1882, Llewelyn Kenrick stated that the club had been started by David Thomson in 1874 as the Plasmadoc Club.

===Druids FC===
The name Druids does not appear in the local press until January 1876. By 1877 the club were commonly referred to as Druids Football Club.

The club were allowed to play at Plasmadoc Park by George Hammond Whalley MP. However following his death in 1878 Druids lost the use of the Plasmadoc Ground. Because of this, Druids were forced to withdraw form the 1878–79 edition of the Welsh Cup. This resulted in the Club folding and many players, including Kenrick, leaving the club. The club did not play any further games for over a year until it was revived in November 1879.

Salvation was found in the form of the Williams-Wynn family as they allowed the club to use an area of the Wynnstay Estate, which became Wynnstay Park and home to the Druids for the next forty years.

With their new home Druids once again entered the Welsh Cup and the 1879–80 edition saw the start of an era of success for the Ruabon Club. Druids reached the Welsh Cup final seven consecutive times between 1879 and 1886 winning the trophy five times. Druids also had some success in the FA Cup reaching the Fifth Round (last eight) in 1882–83 and the Fourth Round in 1884–85
After seven years of success in Welsh football Druids would begin to suffer with the advent of professionalism. Druids failed to reach further than the Second Round in the Welsh Cup until the 1892–93 season. The earlier success in the FA Cup was also not to be matched as after 1887–88 they did not progress to the First Round proper again.

===Mergers===
In September 1888 at a meeting at the Wynnstay Arms, the club was reformed when they merged with neighbours Ruabon Wanderers. It was decided to retain the name Druids as it was a well known title. A follow-up meeting was held at the Bricklayers Arms, Ruabon where the committee was selected. Llewelyn Kenrick was present at this meeting.

After World War I, Druids FC ceased to exist when they merged with Rhosymedre to form Rhosymedre Druids. Despite this new pairing, Druids still faced financial trouble and amalgamated once more in August 1927 with Acrefair United F.C. to form a new club Druids United.

In 1992 after many years of discussion the inevitable amalgamation of Druids United and Cefn Albion F.C. took place to end the internal village soccer rivalry in the village of Cefn Mawr. The new look club took the bold step of applying to join the new Cymru Alliance. The joint resources of the clubs could be focused on a revival of football fortunes in the village of Cefn Mawr.

===Oldest Club===
Contrary to the club badge and sign above the club house proclaiming the club to be the oldest in Wales, these claims are erroneous.

The now defunct Oswestry Town claim a formation date of 1860 which predates Druids, although again primary sources refute this and 1875 is more likely. Geographically they were located in England, though the team has participated in the Welsh system and were early members of the Welsh FA, and would thus consider themselves a Welsh side (see the New Saints).

When the National Library of Wales digitised its Newspaper Archive in 2012, new evidence was discovered that proved Wrexham AFC were formed in 1864 which pre-dates the formation of the original Druids FC (via Ruabon Rovers and Plasmadoc) by 8 years, thus making Cefn Druids claims of being the oldest club in Wales erroneous.

Cefn Druids can claim to originate from one of the oldest existing teams located in Wales, thus making it also one of the oldest football clubs in the world outside England via descent. This could be reflected in club&#x27;s nickname, &#x27;The Ancients&#x27;, however Druids FC were referred to as &#x27;The Ancient Britons&#x27; in multiple historical sources as far back as 1893, so the nickname is actually derived from Celtic history rather than the age of the club.

Druids can still claim via descent to be the oldest club playing in the Welsh Pyramid.

===Flexsys Cefn Druids===
The club steadily consolidated in the Cymru Alliance, helped by a renewed youth policy, and under Gareth Powell, recruited from Lex XI and former manager of Brymbo FC, strolled to the 1998/99 Cymru Alliance championship, scoring over 100 goals. They were promoted into the League of Wales. Eventually Druids finished the season 13th with 41 points from 34 games and this was definitely a successful campaign as they easily avoided the drop back down to the Cymru Alliance.

Druids embarked upon season 2000–01 with a lot of confidence. However, on the evening of 23 May 2001 Gareth Powell phoned his players telling them of his decision to resign as manager and to make a clean break from football.
After the appointment of ex-Rochdale midfielder Steve O&#x27;Shaughnessy in the summer of 2001, the Ancients experienced their best results since the halcyon Welsh Cup days of the late 19th century and early 20th century.

The 2001–02 season was a season of consolidation in the Cymru Premier finishing in 14th place. However, in the Welsh Cup after victories over Llangefni-Glantraeth, Ruthin Town, Halkyn United and Welshpool Town, Cefn found themselves in the semi-finals of the Welsh Cup for the first time in 98 years. It was not to be, as a Marc Lloyd-Williams inspired Bangor City won 5–0 at Belle Vue, Rhyl on 6 April 2002.

The 2002–03 season was a financially difficult one with the playing and management staff going weeks without payment at one point in the season. This even forced O&#x27;Shaughnessy to resign out of principle during this time. Fortunately, he returned after reassurances were given. On the pitch, Cefn finished in a highly respectable 12th place.

===NEWI Cefn Druids===
Before the start of the 2003–04 season, Cefn Druids announced that they had reached an arrangement with the Wrexham-based college, NEWI. The arrangement between college and club gave NEWI students footballing opportunities whilst carrying on with their studies and increasing the resources available to the club.

The 2003–04 season, saw an array of young players join the club like Gareth Evans, who eventually left to join Football League Two club Wrexham. The average age of the team for one match against Caersws on 12 December 2003 was just 21.

As the 2003–04 season came to a conclusion with players and management looking ahead to the future with excitement with a young squad at their disposal. The club signed a three-year deal with NEWI in 2004 after the previous 12-month arrangement proved a success.

However, on the evening of 18 April 2004, O&#x27;Shaughnessy was sacked by the club&#x27;s board. Since then the club has been severely struggling on the pitch with the squad that O&#x27;Shaughnessy put together leaving en masse. Amongst the players who left were Aden Shannon, Brett Jefferies, Dave Cunnah and First Team Coach, Jimmy Hunter all to Welshpool Town, who have qualified for the FAW Premier Cup in the last two seasons.

The Ancients should have been relegated from the Cymru Premier in April 2005 after finishing in the bottom two, but were given a last minute reprieve by Cymru Alliance winners Buckley Town, who declined promotion.

Under the stewardship of former Wrexham manager, Dixie McNeil, the Ancients recorded slightly more respectable league positions for the following 2 seasons, namely 14th in 2005–06 and 13th in 2006–07. However, partly due to his media work as a pundit for BBC Wales, McNeil stepped down during this pre season.

The club were quick to appoint a new management duo of former Wrexham teammates, Wayne Phillips and Lee Jones. Both continued to play, with Phillips benefiting from previous managerial experience at Caernarfon Town. The partnership got off to the best possible start with a shock 1–0 opening day home win against Champions Total Network Solutions.

Phillips and Jones kept the club in the Cymru Premier by finishing 12th and 13th in seasons 2007–08 and 2008–09 respectively.

===Rebranding===
However, with delays to the construction of the new stadium and the overhaul of the Welsh Premier League the 2009–10 season, a reduced playing budget saw the club field a mainly young squad for the entire season and finished bottom of the table and be relegated to the Cymru Alliance. In addition Phillips and Jones departed the club with former player and Welshpool Town manager Huw Griffiths appointed as the new manager. The club went on to finish 3rd place in their first season back in the 2nd tier of Welsh football since 1998–99, Andrew Swarbrick being the club&#x27;s top scorer of the season getting an impressive 18 in all competitions.

Cefn Druids now have a Ladies team, formed in summer 2011. The Ladies will be playing in the North Wales Women&#x27;s Football League along with teams such as Wrexham Ladies, Caenarfon and Llandudno Junction, for the first time in 2011–12.

Cefn Druids reached the semi-finals of the Welsh Cup during the 2011–12 season. They claimed big scalps on the way to the semis by defeating teams away from home such as Connahs Quay Nomads and Cymru Premier teams Prestatyn Town and Aberystwyth Town. On 31 March 2012 Cefn Druids defeated Airbus at Rhyl&#x27;s Belle Vue 4–1 to reach their first Welsh cup final in 108 years. Andrew Swarbrick got a hat trick and Tony Cann netted once to complete the rout. Druids were defeated 2–0 by the New Saints in the final, but qualified for the UEFA Europa League as a result. The club were dealt a shock, with the departure of Manager Huw Griffiths, due to the club and management being unable to agree a budget for the up-and-coming season. John Keegan then took over as manager, before departing later that season. In May 2015, Huw Griffiths returned to the club following an absence of 12 months.

The 2017–18 season saw Cefn achieve their highest ever top flight finish as they ended the season in fifth place.

<text>Pádraig Flynn (born 9 May 1939) is an Irish former Fianna Fáil politician who served as European Commissioner for Social Affairs from 1993 to 1999, Minister for Industry and Commerce and Minister for Justice from 1992 to 1993, Minister for the Environment from 1987 to 1991, Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism from October 1982 to December 1982, Minister for the Gaeltacht from March 1982 to October 1982 and Minister of State at the Department of Transport from 1980 to 1981. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Mayo West constituency from 1977 to 1994.

==Early life==
Flynn was born in Castlebar, County Mayo, in 1939. He is the son of Patrick and Anne Flynn. He was educated in St. Gerald&#x27;s College, Castlebar and qualified as a primary school teacher from St Patrick&#x27;s College of Education in Dublin. His mother owned a small shop in Castlebar. He was married in 1963, to Dorothy and they have four children, one son and three daughters. One daughter, Beverley Flynn was also a Fianna Fáil politician.

He first held political office in 1967, when he became a member of Mayo County Council. Ten years later, at the 1977 general election, he was elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fianna Fáil TD for the Mayo West constituency. On the day the 21st Dail convened in Leinster House, Frank Dunlop described Flynn&#x27;s encounter with the then Taoiseach Jack Lynch:
He was known by the nickname &quot;Pee Flynn&quot; or &quot;Pee Flynnstone&quot;, as popularised by Dermot Morgan&quot;.

==Ministerial career==
Flynn was a supporter of Charles Haughey in the 1979 Fianna Fáil leadership contest. His loyalty was rewarded when he became a Minister of State at the Department of Transport and Power. Flynn joined the Cabinet for the first time following the February 1982 general election, when he was appointed Minister for the Gaeltacht. In October 1982, in a minor reshuffle, he became Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism. However, his time in this office was brief, since Fianna Fáil lost the November 1982 general election.

Fianna Fáil was returned to power in the 1987 general election and Flynn became Minister for the Environment. Two years later he opposed the formation of the coalition government with the Progressive Democrats, describing it &quot;as hitting at Fianna Fáil core values.&quot; In 1990, he attacked the opposition presidential candidate Mary Robinson on a radio show, accusing her of &quot;having a new-found interest in her family&quot; for the purposes of her election campaign. This attack backfired drastically, causing many women who initially supported Lenihan to back Robinson. Lenihan&#x27;s campaign never recovered, and Robinson became Ireland&#x27;s first female President.

In 1991, Flynn was sacked from the Cabinet because of his support for a motion of no confidence in the Taoiseach, Charles Haughey. Then in 1992, Albert Reynolds became Taoiseach and Flynn was rewarded for supporting Reynolds by becoming Minister for Justice. In 1993, he retired from domestic politics when he was appointed Ireland&#x27;s European Commissioner. He was reappointed by the Fine Gael-Labour Party government in 1995 and, on both of these occasions, served in the social affairs portfolio.

==&quot;The Late Late Show&quot; controversy==
On 15 January 1999, Flynn made comments on a live chat show (&quot;The Late Late Show&quot;) regarding businessman Tom Gilmartin and a donation of IR£50,000 to the Fianna Fáil party. On the same programme, following a question by journalist Barry O&#x27;Halloran on EC Commissioners&#x27; remuneration, Flynn described his salary and lifestyle as a European Union Commissioner as being &quot;about IR£140,000, paying 33% tax, which works out to IR£100,000 net. [...] It&#x27;s a well-paid job.&quot; He said the position meant he had the added expense of maintaining three houses, cars, and housekeepers and regular travel, and described the hassle involved. The performance was seen as eccentric and out of touch at a time when house prices were rising significantly.

The show&#x27;s presenter Gay Byrne then asked Flynn if he knew of Gilmartin. Flynn responded that he knew him well. Flynn seemed to be making an attack of Gilmartin&#x27;s emotional stability, stating that &quot;He&#x27;s not well&quot;, based on the effect of sickness of Gilmartin&#x27;s wife. If it was to be interpreted as an attack of Gilmartin&#x27;s credibility, then it backfired in a spectacular manner against Flynn. Also, unknown to Flynn, Gilmartin was watching &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; on Tara Television at his home in Luton. This hurt Gilmartin a great deal, while also bringing the illness of his wife into the picture as the real driving force behind Gilmartin&#x27;s testimony against Flynn. Gilmartin responded by releasing details of meetings he held with Flynn to the McCracken Tribunal.

The interview is widely described as the end of Flynn&#x27;s political career.

==Retirement from politics==
Flynn&#x27;s second term as European Commissioner ended early in September 1999, when the entire commission resigned due to allegations of malpractice by the European Parliament. He was not reappointed to the commission and retired from politics completely. He is a member of the Comite d&#x27;Honneur of the Institute of International and European Affairs. Flynn&#x27;s daughter Beverley Flynn is a former Fianna Fáil TD for the Mayo constituency. She was readmitted to the party on 8 April 2008, having previously been expelled after failing in a libel action against RTÉ which claimed she was involved in selling bogus non-resident accounts to customers while she worked for National Irish Bank.

He receives annual pension payments of €87,129 from his time as a TD and Minister, but this does not include payments for his time as a European Commissioner.

===Mahon Tribunal report===
Flynn was cited in the Mahon Tribunal for having received money from Frank Dunlop intended for Fianna Fáil, but diverted to Flynn&#x27;s personal use. On 22 March 2012, the final report of the Mahon Tribunal was published. It found that Flynn &quot;wrongly and corruptly&quot; sought a substantial donation from Tom Gilmartin for the Fianna Fáil party. It also found that having been paid IR£50,000 by Gilmartin, for that purpose, Flynn proceeded to use that money for his personal benefit, and that the donation funded at least a significant portion of the purchase of a farm in County Mayo.

Flynn had to pay nearly IR£23,000 to the Revenue Commissioners from the IR£50,000 he got from Tom Gilmartin in 1989.

Flynn made his first public appearance since the publication of the Mahon Report by attending noon Mass in the Holy Rosary Church in Castlebar.

===Resignation from Fianna Fáil===
On 26 March 2012, facing expulsion following the Mahon Tribunal, Flynn resigned in disgrace from Fianna Fáil before he could be ousted.

<doc id="299303" wikidata="Q946973" url="?curid=299303" title="James Dooge">
<text>James Clement Dooge (30 July 1922 – 20 August 2010) was an Irish Fine Gael politician, engineer, climatologist, hydrologist and academic who served as Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1981 to 1982, Leader of the Seanad and Leader of Fine Gael in the Seanad from 1982 to 1987 and Cathaoirleach of Seanad Éireann from 1973 to 1977. He served as a Senator from 1961 to 1977 and 1981 to 1987.

Dooge had a profound effect on the debate over climate change, in the world of hydrology and in politics in the formation of the European Union.

His career spanned academia, politics and international affairs with his roles including a period as Minister for Foreign Affairs, a member of the Presidential Commission during two presidential vacancies, chair of the report that led to the Single European Act (SEA) and the Maastricht Treaty, Professor of Engineering in University College Cork and University College Dublin, President of the International Council for Science (ICSU), President of the Royal Irish Academy and Chair of the Irish Film Board.

Dooge was a member of the Fellowship of Engineering, and worked as an expert consultant to a wide range of specialised United Nations agencies including UNESCO, World Meteorological Organization (WMO), United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). He also acted in an expert consultancy role to DGXII (Research) at the European Commission.

He was as only the second senator since 1937 to be appointed to the cabinet. In the world of academia he is known for his numerous publications in the field of hydrology, having developed unit hydrograph theory in 1959, and is generally regarded as a pioneer in the field. His work in Europe through the Dooge Committee led to the SEA and the Maastricht Treaty.

Upon his death in 2010, UNESCO-IHE described him as a &quot;towering figure and pioneer in hydrology&quot;, while the Chancellor of the National University of Ireland, Maurice Manning, described him as &quot;that rare phenomenon in Irish life, a public intellectual whose life was devoted, without posture, to the public service&quot;. John Sweeney, one of the scientists as part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change honoured with the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007, described him as &quot;perhaps one of the most important, prolific and distinguished scientists of the past generation&quot;.

==Early life, career and academia==
James Dooge was born in Birkenhead, England, in 1922. He was educated in Liverpool before moving to Dún Laoghaire and was educated by at Christian Brothers College. Dooge&#x27;s father was an engineer, and so were other relatives. At school Dooge convinced the authorities to bring in an applied mathematics teacher in to tutor him on the subject.

He went on to University College Dublin (here he was awarded the Pierce Malone Scholarship in Theory of Structures and Strength of Materials) and qualified as an engineer. In 1942 he obtained a job with the Office of Public Works and in 1946 he began working with the Electricity Supply Board (ESB). Between 1954 and 1956 he was research associate at the Department of Civil engineering at the University of Iowa, and obtained a master&#x27;s degree. Back working for the ESB in Ireland in 1956, he worked on a number of projects on the River Shannon. In 1958 Dooge became Professor of Civil engineering at University College Cork. In 1970 he became a professor at University College Dublin. Between 1984 and 1987 Dooge worked at the Department of Engineering Hydrology at University College Galway. From 1988 he worked at University College Dublin at the Centre for Water Resources Research. From 1987 to 1990 he was also President of the Royal Irish Academy.

Dooge received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 2000.

==Contributions to science and hydrology==

===Hydrology===
With numerous publications on the subject, he is credited with turning hydrology from an empirical technology into the science it is today. Alongside fellow Irishman Eamon Nash, he was the founder of what today is called systems hydrology in the early sixties.

In the 1960s, Dooge was active in developing an international network of hydrology scientists and engineers that stretched from the US to the then USSR: &quot;These contacts were very beneficial, enabling research taking place from all over the world to link up in meaningful ways and, in a sense, helping establish an international hydrological community. Initially, we were an informal group of six. This grew to the point where we had a committee of 12&quot;. Eventually this led to the establishment of the International Commission on Water Resource Systems within the International Association for Hydrological Sciences (IAHS). He served as its president for several years.

===Climate change===
Dooge was involved in some of the earliest work done to identify the causes of climate change. He was heavily involved in the discussions within WMO in 1978 that eventually led to the first World Climate Conference being held in Geneva in 1979. At the discussions a group of four were given two questions; Is there such a thing as a climate problem? And, if there is, is it serious enough to call a world conference of scientists to discuss it?

He served as chair of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the World Climate Impact Advisory Committee and, on behalf of the UN secretary general, on the International Decade of Natural Disasters Advisory Board.

He witnessed first-hand the phenomenal growth in climate change awareness: &quot;At that first conference the attendance was almost exclusively made up of scientists and engineers whereas, when the second World Climate Conference took place in 1990, the scientists and engineers were joined by a strong contingent of politicians, a sign that interest in the issues had broadened considerably.&quot;

In 1990, WMO launched the idea of an International Conference on Water and Climate that would be held as a preparatory meeting for the Rio Summit on the environment and development. Dooge arranged for the Conference to be held in Dublin in January 1992. References are still made at international gatherings to the &quot;Dublin Conference&quot; as the most influential international conference in the field of water. Under his chairpersonship the conference adopted the &quot;Dublin Principles&quot; that have been influential in shaping water management policy over the last 20 years.

==Political career==
As well as having a distinguished career as an academic, Dooge led a very active political life. His great-grandfather had been the first chair of the elected Kingstown County Borough Council. Dooge was a member of Dublin City Council from 1948, and gained notice from the Taoiseach of the time, John A. Costello.

From 1961 to 1977 Dooge was a Senator in Seanad Éireann, serving as its Cathaoirleach (chairperson) from 1973 to 1977. He worked closely with his colleague Garret FitzGerald from the 1960s onward in establishing the so-called Just Society wing of the Fine Gael party. As Cathaoirleach, Dooge was a member of the commission – which also includes the Ceann Comhairle (or Speaker of the Dáil), and the Chief Justice – established by the Constitution to discharge the duties of the President in the event of the absence or incapacity of the President or during a vacancy in the office as a consequence of the death or resignation of the President. This happened twice during Dooge&#x27;s term as Cathaoirleach. The first (only the second time in the history of the creation of the office in 1937) followed the death of Erskine Hamilton Childers. The second in 1976 followed the resignation of Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh in 1976. In 1977 Dooge retired from politics, choosing to &quot;devote more time to academic concerns and international cooperation in science and engineering&quot;.

In 1981 he made a return to politics, and was appointed by the then Taoiseach FitzGerald as Minister for Foreign Affairs in the short-lived Fine Gael-led government. The appointment was suggested by FitzGerald&#x27;s wife who believed only Dooge could stop him frequently interfering in this area. When a new coalition government was formed in December 1982 (which would last until 1987), Dooge declined re-appointment to the post owing to the decline of his sight. Between 1982 and 1987 he returned to Seanad Éireann. He rejected an offer from FitzGerald of becoming a European Commissioner.

Dooge was a delegate of Fine Gael at the New Ireland Forum in 1985.

==European Integration-Dooge Report==
He had a primary role in the intergovernmental building of a report into improving the co-operation of the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1984 during Ireland&#x27;s presidency. His appointment was not without controversy: Garret FitzGerald insisted on the appointment of Dooge despite German pressure for West Germany&#x27;s former president, Karl Carstens, to be given the role. This work, the Dooge Report, is credited as helping form the basis of the Single European Act and the Treaty of Maastricht; those documents use much of the same language.

==Awards==
He was hailed as one of the founding fathers of modern hydrology.

<text>Julia Constanza Burgos García (February 17, 1914 – July 6, 1953), known as Julia de Burgos, was a Puerto Rican poet, journalist, independentista [Independence movement in Puerto Rico], and teacher. As an advocate of Puerto Rican independence, she served as Secretary General of the Daughters of Freedom, the women&#x27;s branch of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. She was also a civil rights activist for women and African and Afro-Caribbean writers.

==Early years==
Julia de Burgos was born Julia Constanza Burgos García to Francisco Burgos Hans, a farmer, and Paula García de Burgos. Her father was a member of the Puerto Rico National Guard and had a farm near the town of Carolina, Puerto Rico, where she was born. The family later moved to the barrio of Santa Cruz of the same city. She was the oldest of thirteen children. Six of her younger siblings died of malnutrition.

After Burgos graduated from Muñoz Rivera Primary School in 1928, her family moved to Rio Piedras, where she was awarded a scholarship to attend University High School. In 1931, she enrolled in University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus to become a teacher.

In 1933, at the age of 19, Burgos graduated from the University of Puerto Rico with a degree in teaching. She became a teacher and taught at Feijoo Elementary School in Barrio Cedro Arriba of Naranjito, Puerto Rico. She worked as a writer for a children&#x27;s program under Puerto Rico&#x27;s Department of Public Instruction on public radio, but was reportedly fired for her political beliefs. Among her early influences were Luis Lloréns Torres, Mercedes Negrón Muñoz, Rafael Alberti and Pablo Neruda. According to Burgos, &quot;My childhood was all a poem in the river, and a river in the poem of my first dreams.&quot; Her first work was &quot;Río Grande de Loíza&quot;.

==Nationalism==
In 1934, Burgos married Ruben Rodriguez Beauchamp and ended her teaching career. In 1936, she became a member of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party (Partido Nacionalista de Puerto Rico), led by Pedro Albizu Campos. She was elected to the position of Secretary General of the Daughters of Freedom, the women&#x27;s branch of the party. She divorced her husband in 1937.

==Literature==

By the early 1930s, Burgos had published her work in journals and newspapers. At the intersection of her identity as an Afro-Latina woman in a conservative culture her work discusses feminism, rebellion, love, social justice, identity, resistance, colonialism, and much more. She published two collections of poetry, &quot;Poema en 20 surcos&quot; (1938) and &quot;Canción de la verdad sencilla&quot; (1939) in her lifetime. Her third collection, &quot;El mar y tú: otros poemas&quot; (1954) was edited and published after her death by her sister, Consuelo Burgos. For her first two books, she traveled around the island promoting her work by giving book readings. Her third book was published posthumously in 1954. Burgos&#x27; lyrical poems are a combination of the intimate, the land and the social struggle of the oppressed. Many critics assert that her poetry anticipated the work of feminist writers and poets as well as that of other Hispanic authors. In one of her poems, she writes: &quot;I am life, strength, woman.&quot; Burgos received awards and recognition for her work and was celebrated by poets including Pablo Neruda, whom she met in Cuba, and stated that her calling was to be one of the greatest poet of the Americas.

Among Burgos&#x27; works are:

* &quot;Poema en veinte surcos&quot; (1938) 
* &quot;Canción de la verdad sencilla&quot; (1939) 
* &quot;El mar y tú: otros poemas&quot; (1954)
* (My Death Poem),
* (I Was My Own Path),
* (Dawn of My Silence),

==Later years==
Later in life, Burgos became romantically involved with Dr. Juan Isidro Jimenes Grullón, a Dominican physician. According to Grullón, many of her poems during that time were inspired by the love that she felt for him. In 1940, Burgos and Jimenes Grullón traveled first to Cuba, where she briefly attended the University of Havana, and then later to New York City, where she worked as a journalist for &quot;Pueblos Hispanos&quot;, a progressive newspaper.

Shortly after their arrival in Cuba, Burgos&#x27; relationship with Jimenes Grullón became strained. After trying to save her relationship, she instead left and returned once again to New York in 1942, however this time alone, where she took menial jobs to support herself. In 1944, she married Armando Marín, a musician from Vieques. In 1947, the marriage also ended in divorce, lapsing Burgos into further depression and alcoholism.

In February 1953, Burgos wrote one of her last poems, &quot;Farewell in Welfare Island.&quot; It was written during her last hospitalization and is believed by her peers to be one of the only poems she wrote in English. In the poem she foreshadows her death and reveals an ever darker concept of life.

==Death==
On June 28, 1953, Burgos left the home of a relative in Brooklyn, where she had been residing. She disappeared without leaving a clue as to where she went.

It was later discovered that in the early morning hours of July 5, 1953, she had collapsed on a sidewalk in the Spanish Harlem section of Manhattan, and she died of pneumonia at a hospital in Harlem shortly after midnight on July 6, 1953, at the age of 39. Since no one claimed her body and she had no identification on her, the city gave her a pauper&#x27;s burial on Hart Island, the city&#x27;s only potter&#x27;s field.

Eventually, some of her friends and relatives were able to trace her, find her grave, and claim her body. A committee was organized in Puerto Rico, presided over by Dr. Margot Arce de Vázquez, to have her remains transferred to the island. Burgos&#x27;s remains arrived on September 6, 1953, and funeral services for her were held at the Puerto Rican Atheneum. She was given a hero&#x27;s burial at the Municipal Cemetery of Carolina. A monument was later built at her burial site by the City of Carolina.

==Honors==
In 1986, the Spanish Department of the University of Puerto Rico posthumously honored Burgos by granting her a doctorate in Human Arts and Letters.

Cities that have honored Burgos include:
* Carolina, Puerto Rico
** Escuela Julia de Burgos
* Cleveland, Ohio
**Julia De Burgos Cultural Arts Center

The Puerto Rican sculptor Tomás Batista sculpted a bust of de Burgos in the Julia de Burgos Park in Carolina. Isabel Cuchí Coll published a book about de Burgos titled &quot;Dos Poetisas de América: Clara Lair y Julia de Burgos&quot;. Puerto Rican poet Giannina Braschi, who was born the year of de Burgos&#x27; death, pays homage to her poetry and legend in the Spanglish novel &quot;Yo-Yo Boing!&quot;

At Yale University, the Latino Cultural Center is named in her honor, La Casa Cultural Julia de Burgos.

A documentary about the life of Burgos was made in 2002 titled &quot;Julia, Toda en mi ... &quot; (&quot;Julia, All in me ... &quot;) directed and produced by Ivonne Belén. Another biopic about her life, &quot;Vida y poesía de Julia de Burgos,&quot; was filmed and released in Puerto Rico in 1978.

In New York City, the Julia de Burgos Cultural Center, on 106th Street and Lexington Avenue, is named after her.

On September 14, 2010, in a ceremony held in San Juan, the United States Postal Service honored Burgos&#x27; life and literary work with the issuance of a first class postage stamp, the 26th release in the postal system&#x27;s &quot;Literary Arts&quot; series. The stamp&#x27;s portrait was created by Toronto-based artist Jody Hewgill.

In 2011, Burgos was inducted into the New York Writers Hall of Fame.

There is a plaque, located at the monument to the Jayuya Uprising participants in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico, honoring the women of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. Burgos&#x27; name is on the sixth line of the third plate.

On May 29, 2014, The Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico honored 12 illustrious women with plaques in the &quot;La Plaza en Honor a la Mujer Puertorriqueña&quot; (Plaza in Honor of Puerto Rican Women) in San Juan. According to the plaques each of the 12 women, who by virtue of their merits and legacies, stand out in the history of Puerto Rico. Burgos was among the 12 who were honored.

In September 2017, artist-activist Molly Crabapple (herself of Puerto Rican descent) disbursed the profits of the sales of her portrait of de Burgos to the Puerto Rico Hurricane Maria Recovery Fund. The &quot;giclée&quot; 17″ x 22″ print is captioned with one of the poet&#x27;s most famous lines: &quot;En todo me lo juego a ser lo que soy yo/I gamble everything to be what I am.&quot;

In 2018, the &quot;New York Times&quot; published a belated obituary for her as part of their Overlooked No More series.

==In music==
The third movement of Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;&quot; is a setting of Burgos&#x27; poem &quot;A Julia de Burgos&quot;. Jack Gottlieb wrote, &quot;In angry words (sung in Spanish) she expresses her defiance of the dual role she plays as a conventional woman and as a liberated woman-poet. (Her poem antedates by two decades the women&#x27;s liberation movement.) The music is sharply rhythmic, and might well be underscoring for a bullfight.&quot;

Composer Awilda Villarini set de Burgos&#x27; work to music in her composition &quot;Two Love Songs.&quot;

<text>This article is the listing of all episodes of &quot;Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s Andromeda&quot;. Each season consists of 22 episodes, totaling 110 episodes over five seasons.

The 100th episode (#512, &quot;Pride Before the Fall&quot;) contains 108 seconds of outtakes (many intentional) at the end as a &quot;thank you&quot; to the viewers.

==Series overview==
==Episodes==
===Season 1 (2000–2001)===
The idea of the new Commonwealth proves unpopular; only six worlds actually sign the Commonwealth charter in this season. Major powers like the Than Hegemony or the Nietzschean &quot;Sabra&quot; and &quot;Jaguar&quot; prides are not really interested in the new Commonwealth; Dylan also manages to make quite a few enemies himself (including the most powerful of all Nietzschean Prides, Drago-Kazov). Dylan also encounters several dysfunctional remnants of the old High Guard and witnesses the consequences of some of his own actions 300 years before. He realizes that the old Commonwealth had made some mistakes, the repetition of which he has to avoid.

The unification of &quot;Andromeda&quot;″s crew is the primary story arc of season one. Dylan&#x27;s new crew does not really believe in the idea of the Commonwealth, and joins him only for personal gain. To their surprise they find that having something to fight for is not a bad thing. In the season finale, Beka, Dylan&#x27;s First Officer, even promises to continue his mission if he dies.

In the season finale, &quot;Andromeda&quot; encounters the Magog World ship, a structure of twenty connected planets and an artificial sun. The World ship contains trillions of Magog and is equipped with a powerful weapon which creates miniature black holes. The season ends on a cliffhanger. 

===Season 2 (2001–2002)===
Season two begins with the crew of &quot;Andromeda&quot; in a seemingly hopeless situation. Dylan and Trance are revived by Beka, and Dylan goes to the Magog World ship with Rommie (the android avatar of &quot;Andromeda&quot;″s AI) to recover Tyr, Harper and Rev. Harper is infested with Magog eggs, and Rev&#x27;s loyalty is strained when he encounters the being the Magog call the &quot;Spirit of the Abyss&quot;. They believe it to be their creator and god. Although Dylan and Rommie rescue Tyr and Harper, &quot;Andromeda&quot; is badly damaged, Rev has a spiritual crisis, and there seems to be no possible way to extract the Magog larvae from Harper. A powerful drug will keep them dormant for a time, but it only delays the inevitable.

The season shows the crew reacting to the sudden necessity of the New Commonwealth after the discovery of the World ship (which will arrive at the Known Worlds in a few years), as they continue to make sure the dream comes true. Many worlds became more willing to sign the charter after learning of the World ship. Dylan becomes more ruthless in his actions as well. The episode &quot;Ouroboros&quot; (2:12) in the middle of this season became a major turning point for the whole series. &quot;Ouroboros&quot; was the last episode written &quot;solely&quot; by Robert Hewitt Wolfe, the show&#x27;s original developer and head writer, though he returned a few episodes later to finish the writing job on &quot;Dance of the Mayflies&quot;. The producers allegedly felt that the series was becoming too intellectual and complicated. One immediately visible change was Trance&#x27;s transformation, she exchanged places with her own future version; the new Trance had a different (golden-skinned) appearance and a much more serious personality.

Brent Stait (Rev Bem) also left &quot;Andromeda&quot; in &quot;Ouroboros&quot; due to exhaustion, he clarified in an interview said:

He reprises his role twice later, in seasons three and four. Ethlie Ann Vare, another writer, rounds out the list of people who departed the show this season.

In the second half of season two, the restoration of the Systems Commonwealth becomes a much less significant theme. The show mostly concentrated on &quot;Star Trek&quot;-style standalone adventures. However, by the end of the season, the new Commonwealth had gained a new powerful war fleet and a total of fifty worlds. This period also saw Kevin Sorbo reunited with his &quot;&quot; co-star Michael Hurst for one episode. &quot;Andromeda&quot;″s Nietzschean crewman, Tyr Anasazi, is revealed to have a son, Tamerlane Anasazi, who is a genetic reincarnation of Drago Museveni, founder, and progenitor of the entire Nietzschean race. Since all the Nietzschean Prides believe that Museveni&#x27;s genetic reincarnation will necessarily be a great leader, the Nietzschean Messiah, Tyr Anasazi gets a unique opportunity to unite all the Nietzschean Prides. He does not use it yet, biding his time.

In the season finale, the Systems Commonwealth is finally reinstated. A ceremony is held on board the &quot;Andromeda&quot;, but interrupted by the attack of unknown extra-dimensional aliens.

===Season 3 (2002–2003)===
For season three, Bob Engels was brought on the writing staff to fill the hole in that had been left by the departure of Robert Hewitt Wolfe and Ethlie Ann Vare. This season had the most episodic format of all. The Systems Commonwealth is already reunited, but there is not much progress in the fight with the Magog and the &quot;Abyss&quot;.

Several episodes of season three explore Trance and her actual role. The season ends with Nietzscheans withdrawing from the Commonwealth and Tyr Anasazi formally leaving the &quot;Andromeda&quot;.

===Season 4 (2003–2004)===
Season four marked an extreme change in the writing staff. The writing team of Zack Stentz and Ashley Edward Miller, who had been with the show from the beginning and written more episodes of season three than anyone else, did not return for season four. The writing team of Matt Kiene and Joe Reinkemeyer, who had also been with the show from the beginning and who had written almost as many seasons three episodes as Zack and Ash, also did not return for season four, though Kiene did write a single episode on his own. The weight was mostly taken up by new writers: Larry and Paul Barber, who had no previous involvement with the show, wrote the bulk of season four. Other newcomers included Ted Mann, Scott Frost, John Kirk, Lawrence Meyers, and the team of Lu Abbott and Stacey Berman-Woodward, none of whom contributed more than one episode. Naomi Janzen, who had only written a single episode in the show&#x27;s first three seasons put together, wrote four episodes in this season.

Dylan is nearly outlawed by the Systems Commonwealth he restored. The Collectors (originally keepers of historical information unknown to anyone else), allied with the &quot;Spirit of the Abyss&quot;, manipulate the fragile government of the New Commonwealth to show him in a bad light. The &quot;Abyss&quot; infiltrates the Commonwealth using many other agents as well. Eventually, the Collectors unite with Tyr Anasazi and his newly united Nietzschean Prides. Tyr mistrusts the &quot;Spirit of the Abyss&quot; and hopes to defeat it. He tries to find a map to the Route of Ages, a portal connecting all galaxies together. It is possible to weaken the &quot;Abyss&quot; by passing through it. Dylan gets the map instead but he allows Tyr to follow &quot;Andromeda&quot; through the Route of Ages as Tyr knows more about the &quot;Abyss&quot;. &quot;Andromeda&quot; is transported into a weird universe where thoughts manifest as reality. With Trance&#x27;s help, Dylan defeats and kills Tyr who tried to make a deal with the &quot;Abyss&quot;.

Since the Route of Ages closes before the &quot;Andromeda&quot; can return, Dylan has to use Trance&#x27;s help. She reveals that she is the Avatar of the Sun, with &quot;the power to create and destroy&quot;. Trance destroys &quot;Andromeda&quot; and recreates it in the right universe. In this season, Dylan also finds a new crew member — Nietzschean Telemachus Rhade, who does not accept his race&#x27;s betrayal of the Commonwealth and agrees to join Dylan. Rhade proves to be more manageable than Tyr Anasazi, whom he helped Dylan defeat. The Magog evolve and become more intelligent and cunning. In the season finale, their World ship is rediscovered. It is heading towards the Arkology, an old space station with a pacifist population. Dylan frantically tries to convince them that they have to defend themselves but the people of the Arkology hope to make peace with the Magog.

They pay dearly for that mistake, as the Magog never makes peace with anyone. &quot;Andromeda&quot; tries to defend the Arkology against the World ship, but is horribly outnumbered. The Arkology is destroyed along with all of its inhabitants. Rhade, Beka and Harper are left in absolutely hopeless situations. Rommie explodes after being shot through her stomach while saving Harper from the Magog. Trance asks Dylan to escape on a slip fighter through the Route of Ages, claiming that now there is nothing more important than saving his life; Marlowe, Arkology&#x27;s leader (who had disappeared several hours before the battle) tells Dylan that they both are Paradine, two of the few ancient beings with incredible powers. Dylan reluctantly leaves through the Route (in a strange sequence where he finds himself in a large dark room and seemingly meets another version of himself). Trance turns into a sun and crashes into the World ship on the &quot;Andromeda&quot;.

===Season 5 (2004–2005)===
Dylan Hunt reassembles the crew and adjusting the Seefra system and his newly discovered role as a Paradine, finds himself transported into the Seefra system — nine identical barren worlds with a superstitious population and two dim suns. Technology (especially spaceflight) is shunned, and water is treasured because of constant drought. Flavin, a Paradine, meets Dylan here, giving him cryptic hints about Dylan&#x27;s destiny and what Seefra is before disappearing.

Dylan eventually finds Nietzschean warrior Telemachus Rhade, pilot Beka Valentine and super-genius engineer Seamus Harper on Seefra, and to his amazement, they all arrived in Seefra at different times and locations. Harper, in particular, arrived three years earlier with the remains of the android Rommie. He tried to repair her but failed, eventually building another android, Doyle, with some of Rommie&#x27;s memories. Initially, he convinces her that she is human, but later her true identity is revealed by a rebel android. The reason for replacing Rommie with Doyle is Lexa Doig&#x27;s pregnancy. Rommie was rebuilt by Doyle late in this season. Trance is also found, but she is weakened by her attempt to transport &quot;Andromeda&quot; and its crew to Seefra. She does not quite remember who she is and what she is supposed to do. Trance underwent a metamorphosis yet again; she is still golden-skinned but appears younger, and her personality resembles her first purple incarnation. &quot;Andromeda&quot; itself is transported to Seefra as well, but it has no power and no way to restore it. Trance partially recharges the ship&#x27;s generators, but &quot;Andromeda&quot; still cannot move (apparently it needs 100 percent power) and its AI behavior is erratic.

The first half of the season deals with three main themes: Dylan&#x27;s conflict with his crew, his attempts to restore &quot;Andromeda&quot;″s power and the eventual discovery of the true role of Trance and the Seefra system. Rhade, Beka and Harper are all angry at Dylan for leaving them behind in the Battle of Arkology and for throwing them to Seefra without any way to get back to the Known Worlds. Their loyalty is strained several times, but seems finally reaffirmed after the intervention by Stranger, a Paradine sent by Dylan from an alternate future. &quot;Andromeda&quot;″s power is eventually restored with ancient Vedran artifacts, but it is still unable to leave Seefra, it seems to be located in a &quot;pocket universe&quot; and the only way out is the Route of Ages. Although some characters come and leave through it, Dylan cannot use it. Seefra turns out to be Tarn-Vedra, the long-lost capital of the Commonwealth, but the Vedrans themselves left it long ago, disillusioned with humans. Seefra-1 is the original Tarn-Vedra and Seefra-2 to 9 are copies of it. Tarn-Vedra&#x27;s original sun was somehow replaced by two artificial constructs, Methus-1 and Methus-2, but it&#x27;s now damaged and emits deadly flares, which are the reason for Seefra&#x27;s drought.

The Methus Diagram — a blueprint for the Seefra system, recovered with the help of the mysterious DJ Virgil Vox — also reveals the purpose of the eight extra planets. The Vedran sun will return someday, and destroy Seefra-2 through 9 to slow down and take its position. But because of the damage to Methus-2, this mechanism is not working, and the sun threatens to devastate the system completely.

As the second half of the season builds to major revelations and solutions. In the 100th episode of the series, the crew meets up with Peter, who they eventually deduce will become Drago Museveni, the progenitor of the Nietzschean race. He and Beka have a sexual tryst, after which he takes samples of Beka&#x27;s DNA to mix with his own to create their children, applying bio-engineering and nanobot technology to these offspring to create the Nietzschean race. This makes Beka their Alpha Matriarch, and an instrumental part of the history of the Systems Commonwealth. Peter exits through the Route of Ages to an earlier time, so that the new race will have already existed for 16 generations when the first episode happens. The episode also sees &quot;Andromeda&quot; restored to full power. Trance remembers her identity when she meets Ione, the avatar of the Tarn-Vedra moon, and also she &quot;is&quot; the Tarn-Vedra sun. When she realizes this, her sun enters the Seefra system, and Dylan has to find a way to fix Methus-2 and evacuate eight doomed planets to Seefra-1.

Trance&#x27;s &quot;sisters&quot; (who call themselves &quot;the Nebula&quot;), however, try to persuade her to join them. In their opinion the fate of Dylan, Seefra or the Known Worlds is irrelevant. Trance stubbornly refuses, and the Nebula imprisons her inside Methus-2, replacing her with Bad Trance (all Avatars of the Suns look alike). It takes some time for Dylan to realize the deception and rescue the real Trance. Dylan proceeds with the evacuation of the Seefra planets, although his plans are hindered by General Burma, a religious leader from Seefra-5. Burma is later revealed to be under the control of the Abyss. In a confrontation with Burma and Evil Trance, Dylan and Beka kill Burma, and Trance drives off her evil counterpart. In the series finale, the Vedran sun is back in place and people are safe on Seefra-1. Trance then contacts the Nebula — the Lambent Kith Nebula, the supreme council of the galaxies which includes fifty Avatars. Trance was once the oldest member of the Nebula, but disagreed with their views of organic life as something insignificant and left long ago. Together with Dylan, she appeals to the Nebula and its leader Maura, who plans to destroy the Abyss by expanding the All Forces Nullification Point until it consumes all galaxies. This incidentally will destroy everything alive in existence; only Seefra will survive. Maura refuses to reconsider their plans but allows Dylan and the &quot;Andromeda&quot; to return to the Known Worlds. When the &quot;Andromeda&quot; slipstreams to Tarazed, Dylan finds out that only four days have passed since the Battle of Arkology, and the Magog World ship is crippled but still operational. Rhade reunites with his wife (only to return to the &quot;Andromeda&quot; shortly).

&quot;Andromeda&quot; visits Earth (where Harper secretly plans to stay), but as soon as the ship arrives in the system, the planet is promptly destroyed by the &quot;Abyss&quot;. A huge Nietzschean fleet emerges from behind the debris, and &quot;Andromeda&quot; barely escapes. Dylan begins to suspect Maura&#x27;s motives and soon realizes she is the avatar of the &quot;Abyss&quot; and that all of the Nebula were under its control. Maura had destroyed all Paradines (except Dylan). Trance has Dylan take &quot;Andromeda&quot; back to Seefra and the &quot;Abyss&quot; destroys Maura for her failure. At Seefra, Evil Trance returns and reveals herself to be the mysterious Virgil Vox, but Dylan can distinguish the real Trance from her counterpart and kills Vox.

After a massive battle with the Nietzscheans of the Drago-Kazov Pride, Dylan checks the Methus Diagram once again and discovers that Trance&#x27;s sun is capable of destroying the &quot;Abyss&quot;. &quot;Andromeda&quot; returns to Seefra through the Route of Ages, followed by the &quot;Abyss&quot;. Trance manages to pull her sun closer and plunge it into the &quot;Abyss&quot; burning it and finally destroying it, as Dylan&#x27;s battle is over. The Route of Ages transforms into a slipstream portal, allowing the Commonwealth fleet to return to Tarn-Vedra.

<doc id="299309" wikidata="Q7777566" url="?curid=299309" title="Theatrical constraints">
<text>Theatrical constraints are various rules, either of taste or of law, that govern the production, staging, and content of stage plays in the theater. Whether imposed externally, by virtue of monopoly franchises or censorship laws, or whether imposed voluntarily by actors, directors, or producers, these restraints have taxed the creative minds of the theatre to tackle the challenges of working with and around them.

The Classical unities, requiring &quot;unity&quot; of &quot;time, place, and subject&quot;, is the most well-known of all theatrical constraints. It was first employed in Italy in 1514 and later became embraced in France. Another example is the Japanese prohibition of female acting in 1625, then the prohibition of young male actors in 1657, that create &quot;Onnagata&quot; which is the ground of Japanese theatrical tradition. In the Elizabethan theatre of Shakespeare, a similar ban forbade all actresses from appearing on stage, at all; the parts of women were generally played by boys. The plot of &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; turns on this fact.

In cinema, the Dogme 95 films form a body of work produced under voluntary constraints that severely limit both the choice of subjects and the choice of techniques used to bring them to the screen.

Another culturally significant constraint occurred in France. In the late seventeenth century (1697 to be exact), Italian companies were prohibited from appearing in France, so native actors took over the Italian plays and made the roles their own with great success.

In the markets and fairgrounds, itinerant actors created a new theatrical form by holding up cue-cards (like sub-titles or karaoke) containing the words of the plays or songs, which the audience then acted or sang for them. This became even more successful, with crowds coming from all around to see how the actors had overcome such rigid censorship.

Some of the restrictions, or traditions born of them, may have still been in place in the nineteenth century, at least if Marcel Carné&#x27;s &quot;Les Enfants du Paradis&quot; is a reliable guide.

<text>Roman Herzog (; 5 April 1934 – 10 January 2017) was a German politician, judge and legal scholar, who served as the president of Germany from 1994 to 1999. A member of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), he was the first president to be elected after the reunification of Germany. He previously served as a judge of the Federal Constitutional Court, and he was the President of the court 1987–1994. Before his appointment as a judge he was a professor of law. He received the 1997 Charlemagne Prize.

==Early life and academic career==
Roman Herzog was born in Landshut, Bavaria, Germany, in 1934 to a Protestant family. His father was an archivist. He studied law in Munich and passed his state law examination. He completed his doctoral studies in 1958 with a dissertation on Basic Law and the European Convention on Human Rights.

He worked as an assistant at the University of Munich until 1964, where he also passed his second juristic state exam. For his paper &quot;Die Wesensmerkmale der Staatsorganisation in rechtlicher und entwicklungsgeschichtlicher Sicht&quot; (&quot;Characteristics of state organization from a juristic and developmental-historical viewpoint&quot;), he was awarded the title of professor in 1964, and taught at the University of Munich until 1966. He then taught constitutional law and political science as a full professor at the Free University of Berlin. It was during this period that he coedited a commentary of the Basic Law. In 1969, he accepted a chair of public law at the German University of Administrative Sciences in Speyer, serving as university president in 1971–72.

==Political career==

Herzog&#x27;s political career began in 1973, as a representative of the state (&quot;Land&quot;) of Rhineland-Palatinate in the Federal government in Bonn. He served as State Minister for Culture and Sports in the Baden-Württemberg State Government led by Minister-President Lothar Späth from 1978. In 1980 he was elected to the Landtag of Baden-Württemberg and took over the State Ministry of the Interior. As the regional interior minister, he attracted attention when he imposed a levy on nonapproved demonstrations and his proposal for the police to be equipped with rubber-bullet guns.

Herzog was long active in the Protestant Church in Germany. Until 1980, he was head of the Chamber for Public Responsibility of this church, and, beginning in 1982, he was a member of the synod. In 1983 Herzog was elected a judge at the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany (&quot;Bundesverfassungsgericht&quot;) in Karlsruhe, replacing Ernst Benda. From 1987 until 1994, he also served as the president of the Court, this time replacing Wolfgang Zeidler. In September 1994, he was succeeded in that office by Jutta Limbach.

===President of Germany, 1994–1999===
Already in 1993, Chancellor Helmut Kohl had selected Herzog as candidate for the 1994 presidential election, after his previous choice, the Saxon State Minister of Justice, Steffen Heitmann, had to withdraw because of an uproar about statements he made on the German past, ethnic conflict and the role of women. By early 1994, however, leaders of the Free Democrats, the junior members of Kohl&#x27;s coalition government, expressed support for Johannes Rau, the candidate whom the opposition Social Democrats nominated. German media also speculated that other potential candidates included Kurt Masur and Walther Leisler Kiep. The former Foreign Minister, Hans Dietrich Genscher refused to run.

Herzog was elected President of Germany by the Federal Assembly (Bundesversammlung) on 23 May 1994. In the decisive third round of voting, he won the support of the Free Democrats. Their decision was taken as a sign that the coalition remained firm.

Herzog took office as Federal President on 1 July 1994. He participated in the commemorations of the 50th anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising during the Nazi occupation of Poland in 1994. In a widely commended speech, he paid tribute to the Polish fighters and people and asked Poles for &quot;forgiveness for what has been done to you by the Germans&quot;. In the speech, he strongly emphasized the enormity of anguish the Polish people suffered through Nazi Germany but he also made an indirect reference to the sufferings that the Germans experienced in World War II.

In 1995, Herzog was one of the few foreign dignitaries taking part in the observances on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp who chose to attend a Jewish service at the site of the camp rather than the official opening ceremony in Kraków sponsored by the Polish Government. In January 1996, Herzog declared 27 January, the anniversary of the 1945 liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp, as Germany&#x27;s official day of remembrance for the victims of Hitler&#x27;s regime. in late 1997, in a major step for Germany officially recognizing the murder and suffering of the Roma and Sinti under the Nazis, he said that the persecution of the Roma and Sinti was the same as the terror against the Jews.

In April 1997, Herzog caused a nationwide controversy when, in a speech given at the Hotel Adlon in Berlin, he portrayed Germany as dangerously delaying social and economic changes. In the speech, he rebuked leaders for legislative gridlock and decried a sense of national &quot;dejection,&quot; a &quot;feeling of paralysis&quot; and even an &quot;unbelievable mental depression.&quot; Compared with what he called the more innovative economies of Asia and America, he said that Germany was &quot;threatened with falling behind.&quot;

In November 1998, Herzog&#x27;s office formally moved to Berlin, becoming the first federal agency to shift from Bonn to the redesignated capital city. He retained his position until 30 June 1999 and did not seek reelection. At the end of his five-year term as head of state, he was succeeded by Johannes Rau.

===Post-presidency===
From December 1999 to October 2000, Herzog chaired the European Convention which drafted the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In January–March 2000, with former central bank President Hans Tietmeyer and former federal judge Paul Kirchhof, Herzog led an independent commission to investigate a financing scandal affecting the CDU. Amid a German debate over the ethics of research in biotechnology and in particular the use of embryos for genetic inquiry and diagnosis, Herzog argued in 2001 that an absolute ban on research on embryonic stem cells – which have the ability to develop into the body&#x27;s different tissues – would be excessive, stating: &quot;I am not prepared to explain to a child sick with cystic fibrosis, facing death and fighting for breath, the ethical grounds that hinder the science which could save him&quot;.

In response to Chancellor Gerhard Schröder&#x27;s &quot;Agenda 2010&quot; presented in 2003, the then-opposition leader and CDU chair Angela Merkel assigned the task of drafting alternative proposals for social welfare reform to a commission led by Herzog. The party later approved the Herzog Commission&#x27;s package of reform proposals, whose recommendations included decoupling health and nursing care premiums from people&#x27;s earnings and levying a lump monthly sum across the board instead.

Herzog died in the early hours of 10 January 2017 at the age of 82.

<doc id="299315" wikidata="Q2571" url="?curid=299315" title="Walter Scheel">
<text>Walter Scheel (; 8 July 1919 – 24 August 2016) was a German statesman. A member of the Nazi Party who joined the Free Democratic Party of Germany (FDP) in 1946, he first served in government as the Federal Minister of Economic Cooperation and Development from 1961 to 1966 and later as President of Germany from 1974 to 1979. He led the FDP from 1968 to 1974.

During the chancellorship of Willy Brandt, Scheel was Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Vice Chancellor. Scheel became acting Chancellor of West Germany from 7–16 May 1974 following Brandt&#x27;s resignation after the Guillaume Affair. He was elected shortly after as the president of West Germany, remaining in the role until 1979. Scheel was a member of the Protestant Church in Germany.

==Early life==
Scheel was born in Solingen (now in North Rhine-Westphalia). He completed his &quot;Abitur&quot; at the Reformrealgymnsasium Schwertstraße.

Scheel became a member of the Nazi Party in 1942. During World War II, he served in the Luftwaffe during the last years of the war as a radar operator on a Bf 110 night fighter.

==Political career==

When his Free Democratic Party reentered government in a coalition with Konrad Adenauer&#x27;s Christian Democratic Union in 1961, Scheel was appointed federal minister of economic cooperation and development. He continued in that office under Chancellor Ludwig Erhard but brought about the downfall of the latter in late 1966 by resigning.

A Christian Democratic/Social Democratic Grand Coalition followed. During this time, in 1968, Scheel took over the party presidency from right wing liberal Erich Mende. According to one study, the election of Walter Scheel to the FDP leadership in 1968 “represented a turn to the left and the Free Democrats then indicated their wooing of the SPD by voting for the successful Social Democratic candidate for the Presidency of the Republic, Gustav Heinemann, in 1969.”

In 1969, he led his party to form a new coalition with the Social Democrats. Under Chancellor Willy Brandt, Scheel became Foreign Minister and Vice Chancellor. Under their leadership, West Germany pursued a course of rapprochement and détente with the Soviet bloc and officially recognized the existence of the German Democratic Republic (GDR). This policy caused a massive public debate, with various Free and Social Democrats switching sides to the opposition. Though an attempt to oust Brandt failed, the coalition had lost its slender majority. The parliamentary stalemate was ended by the dissolution of parliament and early elections in 1972, which brought great gains for the Social Democrats and enabled the coalition to continue.

On 7 May 1974, Brandt resigned as chancellor after one of his aides, Günter Guillaume, was arrested as a spy for the East German state. Though this had been internally suspected since 1973, Brandt accepted responsibility and resigned. Scheel, as acting chancellor, chaired the government meetings for a little over a week, until Helmut Schmidt was elected. One of his first official acts as acting Chancellor was the award of the war blind radio play prize to Alfred Behrens on 8 May 1974. On 14 May, he chaired the cabinet meeting once. Hans Dietrich Genscher became Scheel&#x27;s successor as party chairman and as minister.

Scheel was elected President of West Germany, a week after relinquishing his other government roles. He held the office from July 1974 until June 1979. At the funeral of Hanns Martin Schleyer in October 1977, Scheel gave a speech entitled &quot;shame&quot;.

<text>Karl Heinrich Lübke (; 14 October 1894 – 6 April 1972) was a German politician, who served as president of West Germany from 1959 to 1969.

He suffered from deteriorating health towards the end of his career and is known for a series of embarrassing incidents that may have resulted from his health issues. Lübke resigned three months before the scheduled end of his second term amid a scandal as to his involvement with the Nazi regime during World War II.

==Early life==
Born in Enkhausen, Westphalia, Lübke had a very humble upbringing. He was the son of a shoemaker and farmer from the Sauerland, and was a surveyor by training. He volunteered for service in World War I in August 1914. He completed his basic training first with the Westphalian Foot Artillery Regiment No.7, with which he was then deployed on the Eastern and Western Fronts. In 1916 he was promoted to &quot;Vizefeldwebel&quot;. After a gas attack, he was taken to a field hospital. In 1917 he was promoted to lieutenant and became deputy battery chief in the 52nd Reserve Division. He then became an orderly officer and was involved in the Battle of Passchendaele. Before the end of the war he was transferred to the GHQ of the Supreme Army Command. During the war he received the Iron Cross 1st and 2nd class. He was discharged from military service in December 1918.

Lübke resumed his studies and received an examination as a surveying and cultural engineer in 1921. During his studies in Bonn he joined the student association K.D.St.V. Ascania Bonn in the Cartellverband. From 1921 to 1924 he studied economics in Münster and Berlin. From 1921 to 1922 he was employed by the Westphalia tenants and settlers association in Münster. From October 1922 he was managing director of the Reich Association of Small Agricultural Enterprises (from 1925 also medium-sized enterprises). After 1924 he was also a member of the executive committee of the &quot;Deutscher Bund für Bodenreform&quot;. In 1926 he became managing director of the &quot;Deutsche Bauernschaft&quot;. From 1927 he was also the managing director of the Bauernland AG settlement company.

In 1929 Lübke married Wilhelmine Keuthen (1885–1981) in Berlin-Wilmersdorf.

In 1930 he became a member of the Roman Catholic Centre Party (&quot;Zentrumspartei&quot;) and in April 1932 was elected as a member of the Prussian Parliament. From 1932 to 1933 Lübke was a member of the Prussian state parliament for the German Center Party. He was re-elected in the state elections on 5 March 1933. On 18 May 1933, as in the Reich, the state parliament approved an enabling law for Prussia against the votes of the SPD. After that, it never met again. On 14 October 1933 the representative bodies of the federal states were dissolved and finally repealed without replacement on 30 January 1934.

After the seizure of power by the National Socialists in 1933 and the subsequent dissolution of the &quot;Zentrumspartei&quot;, Lübke was accused of misappropriating public funds and imprisoned; after 20 months in prison he was released, when no evidence could be produced to back up the politically motivated charges. It was not until 1937 that he was able to get a senior position with a building society (German: &quot;Wohnungsbaugesellschaft&quot;). In 1939, just before the outbreak of World War II, he moved to a company of building engineers managed by the architect . Here he came to the notice of Albert Speer and was given responsibility for major building projects, some of which were under the aegis of the Armaments Ministry run by Speer. One of these was the extension of the &quot;Army Research Center Peenemünde&quot; (&quot;Heeresversuchsanstalt Peenemünde&quot; in German, abbreviated HVP) and the &quot;Air Force Test Centre&quot;(&quot;Erprobungsstelle der Luftwaffe&quot; in German), Peenemünde-West. In February 1945 Lübke was charged by Speer with setting up a &quot;post-war office for planning prefabricated housing&quot; alongside architect Rudolf Wolters.

He performed three military exercises in the Wehrmacht as a reserve officer and was promoted to first lieutenant in the reserve. In 1942 he was promoted to captain of the reserve.

==Post-war political career==

After the war, Lübke returned to his career in politics, becoming a member of the West German CDU party, being appointed Minister of Agriculture in the state parliament of North Rhine-Westphalia in 1947. In 1953 Konrad Adenauer appointed him to his cabinet as Federal Minister of Agriculture in Bonn.

Lübke was chosen by Adenauer as a candidate for the largely ceremonial post of president to ensure that Adenauer&#x27;s political schemes were not disturbed by too strong a personality in this position, which is nominally the highest post in the German state. Lübke defeated Carlo Schmid, the SPD candidate, and Max Becker, the FDP candidate for the presidency, in the second round of voting in 1959.

On 29 June 1964, at a press conference in Berlin, Prof. Albert Norden, one of GDR&#x27;s chief Communist propagandists, alleged that Lübke acted as an informer for the Gestapo (secret police) during the war and at the very least he had been aware of the use of slave labour on his projects; building plans bearing his signature and containing concentration camp barrack blocks were advanced as evidence of his complicity, but these were dismissed in the West as East German and Eastern Bloc propaganda.

On 1 July 1964, he was re-elected by the Fourth Federal Convention. The re-election was preceded by a meeting between Lübke and Herbert Wehner (SPD) during a cure in Bad Kissingen, at which both agreed on re-election and spoke out in favor of a grand coalition. Only then did Lübke inform the CDU and was confirmed in office with the votes of both major parties. The State Secretary in the Office of the Federal President, Hans von Herwarth, who had internally opposed a second term in office because of Lübke&#x27;s state of health, was subsequently replaced and sent to Rome as ambassador. Lübke campaigned for the formation of the Grand Coalition (Kiesinger cabinet).

Lubke stated in Berlin on 19 July 1964, &quot;Our young people must learn more about the devotion and the willingness to sacrifice themselves that marked the men and women who rose against Hitler.&quot;

In September 1966 Lübke&#x27;s office claimed that the document with his signature on display in Munich was a &quot;forgery&quot; and was Communist inspired. The document contained a directive for the construction of a wartime concentration camp.

The historian Tony Judt has observed that Lübke&#x27;s presidency, like the chancellorship of Kurt Georg Kiesinger, showed the &quot;a glaring contradiction in the Bonn Republic&#x27;s self-image&quot; in view of their previous Nazi allegiances. Lübke&#x27;s status as a one-time political prisoner under the National Socialists placed him in good stead. Nevertheless, the potential scandal threatened to damage the office of president; on 14 October 1968 Lübke announced that he would resign on 30 June 1969, his resignation taking effect three months before the scheduled end of his term of office.

The former president&#x27;s health deteriorated. His intention to live in West Berlin from time to time could not be realized, nor could he, with his private library of about 5,000 books, pursue his scientific hobbies in comparative linguistics and microbiology.

Lübke&#x27;s political friends ignored him, if they did not avoid him. His successor in the presidency, Gustav Heinemann, however, kept in contact with him. Trips to Tenerife, in autumn 1969 and at Christmas in 1970 and 1971, brought no improvement in his condition. Arteriosclerosis of the arteries in both his brain and his limbs was becoming increasingly noticeable, leading to serious speech disorders, declining physical mobility, and progressive memory loss. In retrospect, it was clear that this disease had started several years earlier and explained many aspects of the West German president&#x27;s behaviour during his last years in office. In November 1971, the former president visited his birthplace in Enkhausen for the last time.

On 30 March 1972, an acute stomach hemorrhage required an emergency operation during which it was discovered that he was suffering from a very advanced form of stomach cancer which had already spread to his brain. After two more hemorrhages, Lübke died on 6 April 1972 at the age of 77 in the West German capital of Bonn.

==As a speaker==
Lübke was a poor public speaker and was frequently subject to ridicule, especially near the end of his term of office when his age and his failing health started to affect his memory and general cognitive abilities. He frequently forgot where he was (Lübke: &quot;When I talk to you today in...eh... in..&quot; Voice from the crowd shouting: &quot;Helmstedt!&quot; Lübke: &quot;...eh...when I talk to you today in ... Helmstedt, then it was following my own will...&quot;, etc.). This was further ridiculed in the German translation of &quot;Danger Mouse&quot;, where Penfold is called &quot;Lübke&quot; and is frequently ordered to &quot;shut up&quot; (&quot;Lübke, Schnauze!&quot;).

Various other slips are well documented, such as the address in Antananarivo, Madagascar: &quot;My very dear Mr. President, dear Mrs. Tananarive...&quot; His word-for-word translations of German into English (see Lübke English) were also the subject of much mockery.

Tapes from Lübke&#x27;s speeches were collected by the German satirical magazine &quot;Pardon&quot; and distributed on a best-selling record.

He asked for invitations to the Peace Demonstrations in Bonn, but was not invited.

<text>Theodor Heuss (; 31 January 1884 – 12 December 1963) was a German liberal politician who served as the first president of West Germany from 1949 to 1959. His civil demeanour and his cordial nature – something of a contrast to German nationalist traditions and the stern character of chancellor Konrad Adenauer – largely contributed to the stabilization of democracy in West Germany during the &quot;Wirtschaftswunder&quot; years. Before beginning his career as a politician, Heuss had been a political journalist. To this day, Heuss is remembered as a major representative of social liberalism in Germany. 

==Early life and education==
Heuss was born in Brackenheim, a small town and wine-making community near Heilbronn in Württemberg, on the border between the historic regions of Swabia and Franconia. 

He attended the Karlsgymnasium in Heilbronn, from which he graduated in 1902. This selective secondary school has since been renamed the Theodor-Heuss-Gymnasium, in honor of its famous alumnus.

Heuss studied economics, art history and political science at the universities of Munich and Berlin. He received his doctorate at Munich, with social reformer Lujo Brentano serving as his thesis adviser, in 1905. Heuss was also a student of Friedrich Naumann, a social liberal politician and theologian. On 11 April 1908, he married Elly Heuss-Knapp (1881–1952), with whom he had a son. The minister presiding over the Lutheran wedding ceremony held in Straßburg was Albert Schweitzer, a close friend of Elly.
==Career==

After his studies Heuss worked as a political journalist in Berlin and from 1905 until 1912 presided over the magazine &quot;Die Hilfe&quot; (&quot;The Aid&quot;) published by Friedrich Naumann. From 1912 to 1918, he was editor in chief of the liberal &quot;Neckarzeitung&quot; (Neckar Newspaper) in Heilbronn. In Berlin, he worked as editor for the weekly newsletter &quot;Deutsche Politik&quot; (&quot;German Politics&quot;) and the magazine &quot;Die Deutsche Nation&quot; (&quot;The German Nation&quot;). With Naumann, Heuss in 1903 joined the liberal Free-minded Union, which in 1910 merged into the Progressive People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Fortschrittliche Volkspartei&quot;), in which he was engaged until its dissolution in 1918.

After World War I, Heuss became a member of the left liberal German Democratic Party (&quot;Deutsche Demokratische Partei&quot;, DDP), from 1930 renamed German State Party (&quot;Deutsche Staatspartei&quot;, DStP), the political heir of the Fortschrittliche Volkspartei in 1918 and was a member of the Reichstag from 1924 to 1928 and again from 1930 to 1933. He also taught as a lecturer at the &quot;Deutsche Hochschule für Politik&quot; (&quot;German Academy for Politics&quot;) in Berlin. From 1918 to 1924, Heuss was managing director of &quot;Deutscher Werkbund,&quot; a German association of artists, architects, designers and industrialists which became an important element in the development of modern architecture and industrial design, particularly in the later creation of the Bauhaus school of design.

===Nazi Germany===
During the 1920s and early 1930s, Heuss was a staunch supporter of the democratic Weimar Republic and an opponent of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Nazi Party, about which he published one of the first comprehensive analyses in 1932 with the book &quot;Hitlers Weg&quot; (&quot;Hitler&#x27;s Way&quot;). However, on 23 March 1933, along with his four fellow DStP parliamentarians, Heuss voted in favour of the Enabling Act (Ermächtigungsgesetz), granting Chancellor Adolf Hitler quasi-dictatorial powers. He had set out to abstain, but after Heinrich Brüning indicated that with regard to the &quot;Reichskonkordat&quot; the Centre Party MPs would assent, ultimately subordinated to party discipline. Alternative views of Hermann Dietrich, Weimar Republic finance minister claim that he was part of the majority in favor of voting for the enabling law.

When Germany became a one-party state, the DStP was dissolved on 28 June 1933 and Heuss was divested of his Reichstag mandate by decree of Minister of the Interior Wilhelm Frick with effect from 8 July. He also lost his positions at the &quot;Deutsche Hochschule für Politik&quot; and at the &quot;Deutscher Werkbund.&quot; Several of his books were banned and burned during the Nazi book burnings.

Following the end of his term he returned to private life. During the Nazi era, he stayed in contact with a network of liberals, leading to contacts with the German resistance towards the end of the war, though he was not an active resister. In 1936 Heuss faced a publication ban, nevertheless in 1941 he became an employee of the &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung&quot;, one of the few remaining liberal newspapers at that time. Heuss wrote under pseudonyms until publishing of the paper was finally prohibited in 1943. He spent the following years writing a biography of Robert Bosch.

In 1940/41, Heuss was a contributor to the Nazi newspaper &quot;Das Reich&quot;, launched by Joseph Goebbels as a more intellectual version of the crude antisemitism spread by Nazi publications. His eight articles were of a rather apolitical nature focussing on classical literature.

===Postwar===
After World War II the US Office of Military Government gave Heuss the licence for one of the first post-war newspapers, the &quot;Rhein-Neckar-Zeitung&quot; in Heidelberg and on 24 September 1945 appointed him the first Minister of Education and Cultural Affairs in the German state of Württemberg-Baden under his fellow party member Minister-President Reinhold Maier. In this position, he was now able to drive forward the democratic re-education process. After poor results in the 1946 Württemberg-Baden state election, he resigned from his post so that Maier could stay on as Minister-President. In 1946, Heuss also took part in the constitutional consultations in Württemberg-Baden.

As a co-founder of the Democratic People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Demokratische Volkspartei&quot;, DVP), the predecessor of the German Free Democratic Party (&quot;Freie Demokratische Partei&quot;, FDP) in the southwestern German states, he was a member of the Württemberg-Baden state parliament (&quot;Landtag&quot;) from 1946 to 1949, together with his wife Elly Heuss-Knapp. In 1947, he had to justify himself before a committee of enquiry of the Württemberg-Baden state assembly for having voted in favour of Hitler&#x27;s Enabling Act in 1933. In his testimony, Heuss argued that the law was ultimately irrelevant to the Nazi tyranny. Heuss also taught history at the Stuttgart Institute of Technology in 1946 and 1947, receiving the title of an honorary professor in 1948. 

After plans elaborated with Wilhelm Külz to build up an all-German liberal party, known as Democratic Party of Germany, had failed, Heuss in December 1948 was elected head of West German and Berlin sections of the newly founded Free Democratic Party. He advocated uniting all liberal parties in the Western occupation zones in one centrist party, overcoming the split between right liberals and left liberals that had existed in the Weimar Republic. In 1948, he was a member of the Parlamentarischer Rat (Parliamentary Council) at Bonn with considerable influence in the drafting of West Germany&#x27;s constitution, the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany.

==Presidency==
After being elected to the first German Bundestag, he relinquished his parliamentary mandate on 12 September 1949, when he was elected President by the Federal Convention (&quot;Bundesversammlung&quot;) defeating the Social Democrat leader Kurt Schumacher in the second ballot. He took the oath required by article 56 of the Basic Law before a joint session of the Bundestag and the Bundesrat on the same date. By the time he was confirmed as the first democratic German president since Paul von Hindenburg, he refused to be called &quot;Excellency&quot;, preferring instead to be called simply &quot;Herr Heuss&quot;, &quot;Herr Bundespräsident&quot; is the German term of address up to today. Heuss&#x27;s plans for a new national anthem were aborted by Adenauer, who – in rare accordance with Kurt Schumacher – had the third stanza of the old &quot;Deutschlandlied&quot; established in 1952.

A widower since 1952, Heuss was re-elected in 1954 with practically no opposition, after the Social Democrats had renounced the nomination of a rival candidate. Not until May 1956, could he make his first state visit, invited by King Paul of Greece. The president, accompanied by Foreign Minister Heinrich von Brentano, was overwhelmed by the warm reception in Athens, considering that the country had heavily suffered under German occupation in World War II. He held office until the end of his term on 12 September 1959, succeeded by Heinrich Lübke. He had declined a third term in office, as this would have necessitated changing the constitution.
Heuss shaped the office of president by his non-partisan governing. As a representative of the democratic-liberal and cultural traditions of Germany, he was a symbol of confidence in the German post-war republic in the international community. His further state visits to Turkey, Italy, Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom contributed greatly to the increase of appreciation toward the still young Federal Republic of Germany. Even though being critical of German militarism, Heuss supported re-armament and the founding of the new West German Army in 1955, in agreement with the Western European partners and within the structures of NATO. Nonetheless, his ironic speech at the swearing in of the first new soldiers, &quot;Nun siegt mal schön!&quot; (&quot;Happy war-winning!&quot;), is well remembered. 

In 1959, Heuss was awarded the prestigious Friedenspreis des Deutschen Buchhandels. In addressing the memory of Nazism and the Nazi dictatorship, Heuss introduced the concept of collective shame as opposed to collective guilt. His rhetoric encouraged the Germans to never forget the Holocaust and precisely described the crimes against the Jews but he refrained from citing those who were responsible for their suffering.

In 1957 Heuss donated a sculpted portal entry to the Camposanto of the Teutons and the Flemish in Vatican city. The portal, by sculptor Elmar Hillebrand of Cologne, gives access from the Teutonic Cemetery to the Church of Santa Maria della Pietà in Camposanto dei Teutonici, the National Church in Rome of Austria, Germany, and the Netherlands.

On 12 December 1963 Heuss died in Stuttgart, aged 79.

==Personal life==
Heuss was a member of the Protestant Church in Germany. He was married to Alsace German politician, social reformer and author Elly Heuss-Knapp with whom he had one child, antifascist resistance fighter Ernst Ludwig Heuss. 

==Legacy==
Since 1964, the Theodor Heuss Prize has been awarded for exemplary democratic disposition. Heuss&#x27;s former residence is now open to the public as the &quot;Theodor-Heuss-Haus&quot;. In 1994, the German Bundestag established the Theodor Heuss House Foundation (&quot;Stiftung Bundespräsident-Theodor-Heuss-Haus&quot;) as a public institution to commemorate Heuss&#x27; achievements and values and to conduct historical research and political education.

Heuss&#x27; image appeared on one series of the two-mark coin and numerous streets and squares all over Germany have been named in his honour. During his time in office, his image also appeared on definitive stamps in West Germany issued between 1954 and 1960. An Airbus A340 aircraft of the Luftwaffe used by the German head of government also carries his name.

<text>Karl Arnold (21 March 1901 – 29 June 1958) was a German politician. He was Minister President of North Rhine-Westphalia from 1947 to 1956.

==Early life and education==
Arnold was born in Herrlishöfen in Württemberg on 21 March 1901. He was trained as a shoemaker and later (1920/21) studied at the Soziale Hochschule Leohaus, Munich.

From 1920 onwards, Arnold worked as functionary of the movement of Christian workers. In 1924, he became secretary of the Christian workers union for the Düsseldorf region. He was elected in the town council of Düsseldorf for the Centre Party in 1929.

In 1933, Arnold was co-owner of a sanitary installation shop in Düsseldorf. The Gestapo observed and hunted him in the following years because of his political activities. In 1944, he was jailed by the Gestapo.

==Career==
After World War II, Arnold became politically active again. In 1945, he was co-founder of the local Christian-Democratic Party in Düsseldorf, which became part of the CDU later in 1945. Also in 1945, the Düsseldorf chapter of the united workers union was founded, presided by Arnold. On 29 January 1946 Arnold was named mayor of Düsseldorf and later elected in the first free elections (26 October 1946).

In December 1946, Arnold became deputy minister-president of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia and in 1947 he was elected minister-president. Until 1950 he presided over a coalition of CDU, Centre Party, SPD and (briefly) the Communist Party. He considered himself a &quot;christian socialist&quot;. The only in-parliament-party he did not let enter the government was the FDP, whose North Rhine-Westphalian branch had a particular nationalist bent.

On 7 September 1949, he was elected as the first president of the Bundesrat of Germany, the representation of German states at the federal level.

From 1950 to 1956, Arnold was elected minister-president for North Rhine-Westphalia twice again, governing with the help of conservative parties and the Free Democrats. Important acts of his government were the foundation of the North Rhine-Westphalian broadcasting system (today: Westdeutscher Rundfunk) and the German system of workers union influence in steel and coal industries.

On 20 February 1956, the FDP switched coalition affiliation to the SPD, ending the Arnold government in North Rhine-Westphalia.

In 1957, he was elected into the German Bundestag (with a 72% majority in his constituency). He was member of the Bundestag until 29 June 1958, when he died of a heart attack.

==Personal life==
In 1928, Arnold married Liesel Joeres.

Arnold was a Catholic and a member of the German branch of the lay Catholic organization Catholic Action.

<text>Thomas Derrig (; 26 November 1897 – 19 November 1956) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who served as Minister for Lands from 1939 to 1943 and 1951 to 1954, Minister for Education from 1932 to 1939 and 1940 to 1948 and Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in September 1939. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1921 to 1923 and 1927 to 1957.

==Early life==
Derrig was born on 26 November 1897, in Westport, County Mayo, the son of Patrick Derrig and Winifred Derrig (née Sammon). He was educated locally and later at University College Galway. 

==Revolutionary period== 
During his time in college he organised a corps of the Irish Volunteers. Derrig did not take part in the 1916 Easter Rising but was arrested in the aftermath. He was imprisoned in Woking, Wormwood Scrubs and Frongoch internment camp. He was arrested in July 1918, and was accused of attempting to disarm a soldier. He was sentenced to five months imprisonment by a court in Belfast. When he was released in November 1918, he supported Joseph MacBride at the 1918 Irish general election. After his release, he graduated from college and became headmaster in a technical college in Mayo.

During the Irish War of Independence he was the Brigade Commandant of the West Mayo Brigade of the Irish Republican Army, before being captured in January 1921 and interned at the Curragh Camp. While there he was elected a Sinn Féin TD for Mayo North and West. During the Truce period, he was appointed Divisional Director of Organisation of 4 Western Division IRA.

Taking the anti-Treaty side in the Irish Civil War, Derrig took part in fighting against National forces in Dublin. He escaped from Dublin on 30 June 1922 and served as Adjutant to Ernest O&#x27;Malley during fighting in counties Wicklow and Wexford in July and August. Derrig was appointed IRA Adjutant General by Liam Lynch in November 1922 and was serving in that position when arrested by National Forces on 6 April 1923. 
On that same date, while in custody of the Criminal Investigation Department in Oriel House, Derrig was shot in the face by a CID detective and lost his left eye. Derrig was interned at Kilmainham Gaol and was a leader there during the 1923 Irish hunger strikes Derrig was later awarded a wound pension under the Army Pensions Act, 1932 for the gunshot wound he received while in custody. Derrig also applied to the Irish government for a service pension under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934 and was awarded 7 and 3/8 years service in 1942 at Grade A for his service with the Irish Volunteers and the IRA between 1 April 1917 and 30 September 1923. 

In 1928, he married Sinéad Mason of Ards, County Down; they had two daughters.

==Political career==
At the June 1927 general election he was elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fianna Fáil TD for Carlow–Kilkenny. In Éamon de Valera&#x27;s first government in 1932 Derrig was appointed Minister for Education. Derrig initiated a review of industrial and reformatory schools and the rules under the Children Act 1908 (8 Edw. 7. c. 67), resulting in the critical 1936 Cussen Report that followed which he shelved, and a report in 1946–1948 by the Irish-American priest Father Edward Flanagan, which was also shelved. His lack of action was noted in 2009 when the Ryan Report examined the subsequent management of these &quot;residential institutions&quot;; Derrig was the first Minister to seek a report that could have resulted in much-needed reforms. It has been suggested that he did not want to follow British law reforms in the 1920s and 1930s, because of his strong anti-British views, and that Irish children had suffered needlessly as a result.

From 1939 to 1943, he served as Minister for Lands. He was re-appointed to Education in 1943 until 1948. During this period a bitter teachers&#x27; strike, involving the Irish National Teachers&#x27; Organisation (INTO), took place, lasting from 20 March to 30 October. Between 1951 and 1954, he became Minister for Lands again.

Thomas Derrig died in Dublin on 19 November 1956, seven days before his 59th birthday. No by-election was held for his seat.

<doc id="299323" wikidata="Q963586" url="?curid=299323" title="The Years of Rice and Salt">
<text>The Years of Rice and Salt is an alternate history novel by American science fiction author Kim Stanley Robinson, published in 2002. The novel explores how world history might have been different if the Black Death plague had killed 99 percent of Europe&#x27;s population, instead of a third as it did in reality. Divided into ten parts, the story spans hundreds of years, from the army of the Muslim conqueror Timur to the 21st century, with Europe being re-populated by Muslim pioneers, the indigenous peoples of the Americas forming a league to resist Chinese and Muslim invaders, and a 67-year-long world war being fought primarily between Muslim states and the Chinese and their allies. While the ten parts take place in different times and places, they are connected by a group of characters that are reincarnated into each time but are identified to the reader by the first letter of their name being consistent in each life.

The novel explores themes of history, religion, and social movements. The historical narrative is guided more by social history than political or military history. Critics found the book to be rich in detail, plausible, and thoughtful. &quot;The Years of Rice and Salt&quot; won the Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 2003. In the same year it was nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke Award, a Hugo Award, and a British Science Fiction Award.

==Background==
At the time of publication in 2002, science fiction author Kim Stanley Robinson was 49 years old and living in Davis, California. He had conceived of the premise for &quot;The Years of Rice and Salt&quot; in the 1970s while thinking about what alternate history scenario would result in &quot;the biggest change that would still work in terms of comparison to our history&quot;. He subsequently developed an interest in China and in Buddhism, which he would study for this project.

Robinson&#x27;s only other alternate history story prior to this project was the short story &quot;The Lucky Strike&quot; (1984), where the &quot;Enola Gay&quot; crashes in a training exercise and the secondary crew must complete the Hiroshima bombing.

Robinson also wrote an essay titled &quot;A Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions&quot; (1991), comparing different theories of history and laws of science, such as the covering law model, to explain how alternate histories can be arrived at, using &quot;The Lucky Strike&quot; as an example.

He explored the idea of non-Western influences creating a new culture while working on his Mars trilogy, which involved a heavy Muslim influence in a Martian colony. The Mars trilogy gave Robinson a reputation for quality of writing and a richness of detail comparable to James Michener, as well as winning him a Nebula Award for &quot;Red Mars&quot; (1993) and two Hugo and Locus Awards for &quot;Green Mars&quot; (1994) and &quot;Blue Mars&quot; (1996). Robinson followed the Mars trilogy with the novel &quot;Antarctica&quot; (1997), which won an Alex Award, and two short story collections, &quot;The Martians&quot; (1999) and &quot;Vinland the Dream&quot; (2001), before publishing &quot;The Years of Rice and Salt&quot;.

==Plot==
The story is divided into ten parts.

===Book One: &quot;Awake to Emptiness&quot;===
Bold and Psin, scouts in Timur&#x27;s army, discover a Magyar city where all the inhabitants have died from a plague. Timur turns his army around and orders the scouting party executed to avoid the plague, but Bold escapes and wanders through the dead lands of Eastern Europe, encountering only one lone native. Upon reaching the sea he is captured by Turkish Muslim slave-traders and sold to Zheng He&#x27;s Chinese treasure fleet. Bold befriends a young African slave, named Kyu, whom he cares for after the Chinese castrate him.

In China, they are kept as kitchen slaves until Kyu burns the restaurant and convinces Bold to escape with him. The pair make their way north to Beijing where they find work at the palace of Zhu Gaozhi, heir to the Yongle Emperor. The vengeful Kyu, hating the Chinese for what they have done to him, incites violence between the eunuchs and the Confucian administrative officials. After his scheming is discovered, Kyu is assassinated.

Kyu and Bold reunite in the bardo, where Bold explains to Kyu the concepts of cyclical reincarnation alongside one&#x27;s jati. He explains that their jati also includes Psin, the restaurant owners Shen and I-li, and an unknown number of others, and that their group has been especially close since an avalanche in Tibet killed them all at once in a previous cycle. Kyu resolves to do better in his next life.

===Book Two: &quot;The Haj in the Heart&quot;===
In Mughal India, two Hindu girls named Kokila and Bihari grow up together studying traditional medicine. Kokila is married to the son of an unpopular village headman. Her husband&#x27;s brother gets Bihari pregnant, and Kokila is too late to save her from dying in a miscarriage. In revenge, Kokila uses her knowledge of herbs to fatally poison her brother-in-law and father. She is executed for her crime.

Kokila reincarnates as a tiger named Kya, who saves Bistami, a Sufi mystic of Persian origin, from an attack by Hindus. After seeing Bistami beaten by his older brother, Kya kills the brother, and is trapped and killed by the villagers in retaliation.

Bistami goes on to become a judge for the Mughal Emperor Akbar, but later falls into his disfavour and is exiled to Mecca. Bistami spends a year in Mecca before learning that he is being blamed for Akbar forsaking Islam, and departs again, traveling to the Maghreb and Iberia (Al-Andalus). Accompanied by Ibn Ezra, a follower of the historian Ibn Khaldun, Bistami joins a caravan led by Sultan Mawji and his wife Katima, who seek to found a new city on the other side of the Pyrenees.

The caravan members found a city called Baraka on the abandoned former site of Bayonne, France, and create a model society based on Katima&#x27;s feminist interpretation of the Quran. After Mawji dies, Katima rules the community on her own. Believing this to be heresy, the Caliph of Al-Andalus sends an army against Baraka. Bistami, Katima, Ibn Ezra, and their remaining followers flee again, this time founding the city of Nsara (near Nantes, France).

===Book Three: &quot;Ocean Continents&quot;===
The Wanli Emperor orders a fleet under Admiral Kheim to invade Nippon (Japan). When the wind fails to arrive, the huge fleet is swept out to sea by the Kuroshio Current and set adrift on the unexplored Pacific Ocean. Deciding that their only hope of returning home is to ride the North Pacific Gyre, the fleet navigates all the way to the New World.

The sailors land on the West coast of North America and make contact with the peaceful Miwok people. Kheim befriends a girl named Butterfly and begins teaching her to speak Chinese. Once Kheim discovers they have infected the indigenous people with disease, he orders his crew to leave at once, but a sailor named Peng jumps ship to remain with his Miwok lover. Butterfly comes aboard the fleet, intending to voyage with Kheim back to China.

Continuing south, Kheim&#x27;s fleet encounters the Inca Empire. They are taken prisoner, and both Kheim and Butterfly are set to be ritually sacrificed; Kheim escapes by awing the natives with his flintlock pistol. On the return trip to China, Butterfly is fatally injured during a storm and soon dies. Kheim tells the Emperor that the Inca are militarily weak and rich in gold. In the bardo, a grieving and enraged Kheim attacks the goddess Kali with his sword, but is unable to wound her.

===Book Four: &quot;The Alchemist&quot;===
Khalid, an alchemist from Samarkand, attempts to fool the Khan into believing that he has discovered the Philosopher&#x27;s stone. The Khan&#x27;s aide discovers the fraud and Khalid&#x27;s hand is severed as punishment. Khalid becomes disenchanted with alchemy and decides to destroy all his books. His friend Iwang, a Tibetan Buddhist mathematician, and son-in-law Bahram, a Sufi blacksmith, instead convince Khalid to test the claims in the books through practical experiments, particularly those of Aristotle.

Khalid and Iwang devote themselves to demonstrations that use the scientific method to greatly progress knowledge of physics, chemistry, mathematics, biology, and weaponry. Their discoveries inspire Samarkand&#x27;s other madrasa scholars to conduct scientific investigations of their own. However, the Khan still sees Khalid as a con artist, and demands that he prove his worth by inventing new weapons to fight the rising Chinese threat to the East. The Chinese attack never comes; in the end, everyone at Khalid&#x27;s lab is killed by an outbreak of plague, implied to have resulted from the Khan&#x27;s refusal to listen to Khalid and Iwang&#x27;s suggestions to improve the city&#x27;s sanitation.

===Book Five: &quot;Warp and Weft&quot;===
The Iroquois people, referred to throughout by their own name of Hodenosaunee (People of the Longhouse) hold a ceremony to raise a foreigner named Fromwest to the rank of Chief. After distinguishing himself in a game of lacrosse, Fromwest tells the story of how he came to the northeast of the continent he calls Yingzhou. Formerly a samurai named Busho, he fled to the New World after the Chinese conquered Japan. He was eventually captured by a war party of Sioux and rescued by warriors from the Seneca people.

In an ecstatic vision, Fromwest appears to remember his past lives. He realizes that Peng (from &quot;Ocean Continents&quot;) made his way to the Hodenosaunee and taught them about variolation, blunting the impact of smallpox epidemics on their civilization. Fromwest reveals that he has come to organize the Hodenosaunee into a larger defensive alliance capable of resisting Chinese and Muslim colonizers, and offers to teach them how to mass-produce their own firearms.

After their next deaths, the jati members apply scientific reasoning to the bardo, and manage to resist drinking the tonic of forgetting before being reincarnated.

===Book Six: &quot;Widow Kang&quot;===
During the reign of the Qianlong Emperor, Chinese widow Kang Tongbi takes in a Buddhist monk and his son whom she finds scavenging. The monk, Bao Ssu, is wrongly implicated in a series of queue cuttings and dies in prison. Later, Kang meets a Hui Muslim scholar named Ibrahim ibn Hasam, and they perform a ritual that allows them to remember their past lives.

Kang and Ibrahim marry and move to Lanzhou in western China, where they work to try to reconcile Islamic and Confucian beliefs. Kang anthologizes proto-feminist poetry and becomes a well-known writer. The Jahriyya Islamic movement gains adherents in the west but faces intolerance from the Qing administration, leading to a revolt that the Qing crush with massive force. Lanzhou is swamped by a dramatic flood; Bao Ssu&#x27;s son rescues a pregnant Kang from the rising waters. In a work based on Kang&#x27;s ideas, Ibrahim publishes his thoughts on the Four Great Inequalities: warriors and priests over farmers, men over women, men over children, and certain races over other races.

===Book Seven: &quot;The Age of Great Progress&quot;===
In the equivalent of the Christian 19th century, the Indian state of Travancore has overthrown the Mughals and the Safavids and developed steam engines, ironclad warships, and military balloons. Using these new weapons, they sail to Kostantiniyye and easily topple the Ottoman Empire. A Muslim Armenian doctor named Ismail ibn Mani al-Dir, who had served the Ottoman Sultan, is captured and sent to Travancore, where he happily joins the hospital of Travancore and works in anatomy and physiology. Ismail eventually meets their ruler, the Kerala of Travancore, who aims to drive out the Muslim invaders and unify India -- and eventually the whole world -- into a democratic confederation.

Later, during the Xianfeng Emperor&#x27;s reign, the Japanese enclave known as Gold Mountain (in the real-world San Francisco Bay Area) has been subjugated by Chinese colonists. A Japanese slave named Kiyoaki is swept out to sea by the Great Flood of 1862. Along with a pregnant Chinese refugee, Peng-ti, Kiyoaki manages to flee to the great coastal city of Fangzhang. There, Kiyoaki joins a Japanese freedom movement supported by Travancore, with Ismail acting as a liaison.

===Book Eight: &quot;War of the Asuras&quot;===
Book Eight is set in the 20th century, during the &quot;Long War&quot;. The world has become divided into four great alliances: the Chinese Empire and its colonies, the fractured Muslim world (Dar al-Islam), and the democratic Indian and Hodenosaunee Leagues. At the outbreak of war, the Muslim states put aside their differences to fight the larger threat of China. The Indian and Hodenosaunee Leagues stay neutral at first, but eventually ally with China, seeing the Muslims as their greater enemy. The war drags on for decades and causes major changes in human society, including rapid industrialisation, mass conscription, and mass casualties. New devastating weapons and methods are employed, including trench warfare, chemical warfare, and air strikes. 

Chinese officers Kuo, Bai, and Iwa fight in the trenches of the Gansu Corridor, where the ground has been blasted down to bedrock by sixty years of bombardments. Kuo is killed when a shell penetrates their bunker. Bai and Iwa are ordered to move with their company south through Tibet to support their Indian allies. At a pass in the Himalayas, they witness Muslim artillery destroying the top of Mount Everest so that the tallest mountain in the world will be in Muslim lands. Bai is plagued by visions of his dead friend Kuo, who tells him that he is already dead, killed by the same shell that killed Kuo.

After extreme difficulties, Bai and Iwa&#x27;s forces manage to breach the Muslim defences at the pass. The Chinese army pours through to join forces with the Indians, turning the course of the war in their favor. The Chinese and Indian Buddhists unite to share a ritual beside the destroyed Bodhi Tree.

===Book Nine: &quot;Nsara&quot;===
In the aftermath of the Long War, a young Muslim woman named Budur and her aunt Idelba escape Budur&#x27;s restrictive traditional family in the Alps and move to the more liberal and cosmopolitan city of Nsara. They stay at a zawiyya, a refuge for women, where Idelba restarts her work in physics and Budur enrolls in university to study history. She grows close to Kirana, a feminist history lecturer who questions everything about Muslim society and argues for emancipation and liberation. The two have a brief affair.
Life in Nsara becomes increasingly difficult as the Islamic world faces the effects of losing the Long War, including hyperinflation, food shortages, and strikes. Many governments in Dar al-Islam are overthrown by coups. When the military attempts to overthrow the legitimate government of Nsara, Budur and Kirana incite mass protests. Eventually, the Hodenosaunee League send a fleet from their naval base at Orkney to back the protestors in Nsara, forcing the military to surrender.

Meanwhile, Idelba&#x27;s work in atomic physics lead her to the disturbing discovery that it is possible to build a devastating weapon from nuclear chain reactions. The government learns of her work and raids the zawiyya, but Budur manages to hide Idelba&#x27;s papers. Idelba dies of radiation poisoning and leaves all her research to Budur, who has begun using the principles of radiation to develop Radiocarbon dating.

Budur&#x27;s work in archaeology gets her invited to an international conference of scientists in Isfahan, Iran. There, she convenes a group of scientists from all the major world powers, all of whom agree to convince their various governments that nuclear weapons are too impractical to manufacture. The group initates an international scientific movement to break down barriers between cultures. In the halls of the conference, Budur is overcome by an exhibit about a Tibetan village preserved by an avalanche, but cannot explain why.

===Book Ten: &quot;The First Years&quot;===
Bao Xinhua is a revolutionary in China, who works under the leadership of his friend Kung Jianguo. Bao and Kung successfully overthrow the oppressive Chinese government, but Kung is assassinated on the cusp of their victory. Disillusioned, Bao leaves China and serves as a diplomat all over the world, eventually marrying and settling down to raise two children in Fangzhang (San Francisco).

After his wife dies, Bao accepts a diplomatic post in Myanmar, where he reunites with comrade from his revolutionary years named Isao Zhu. Zhu poses many macrohistorical questions, attempting to arrive at a unified theory of history; in a moment of Metafiction, Zhu and Bao contemplate using the bardo as a narrative device to illustrate the gradual improvement of human society. Bao later returns to Fangzhang to teach history in a village implied to be located near real-life Davis, California. At the end of the novel, he meets a new student named Kali, implied to be Kung reborn.

==Style, themes and genre==
The novel is divided into ten chapters that each act as a short story, linked by the use of a group of people who appear in each story. After spending time in bardo, the group (or jāti) are reincarnated into different times and places. While characters in each story are unique, they share some characteristics with their previous incarnations and are linked, for convenience, by the first letter of their name. The characters whose names begin with the letter &quot;K&quot; are &quot;combative, imprudent and prone to getting himself (or herself) killed&quot; and &quot;striking blows against injustice that typically lead to more suffering&quot;. The &quot;B&quot; characters are &quot;more comfortable in the world, meliorist and optimistic&quot; and &quot;survivors, nurturing friends and family through bad times and patiently waiting for something better&quot;. The &quot;I&quot; characters are &quot;the ones who care, who follow the other two, and may be necessary if their works are to flourish, but who tend to the domestic and always find the world worth loving.&quot; The style of writing also changes every chapter to reflect the style of writing associated with the culture being depicted. For example, the first chapter is written similarly to &quot;Monkey&#x27;s Journey to the West&quot; and a later chapter incorporates postmodernism. Also, later chapters take on metafictional elements, with characters discussing the nature of history, whether it is cyclical or linear, whether they believe in reincarnation, and feelings that some people are intrinsically linked.

Robinson incorporated utopian themes in his previous works but reviewers were divided on whether &quot;The Years of Rice and Salt&quot; qualified as a utopian story. Those that did call the world described in the story as utopian cited the story&#x27;s illustration of progress. However, those that wrote &quot;The Years of Rice and Salt&quot; was not a utopian story say that the world history presented is not necessarily better or worse than the real history, just different. Robinson calls himself a &quot;utopian novelist&quot; in that he claims &quot;all science fiction has a utopian element, in that it tends to say that what we do now matters and will have consequences&quot;. Several other themes were identified by reviewers. Robinson had previously used the theme of memory (or identity) and incorporates it into this story with characters who are reincarnated versions of previous characters and who only recognize each other while in the bardo, but sometimes feel a connection between themselves while on earth. The reviewer in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; identified feminism and &quot;struggles over the nature of Islam&quot; as recurring themes.

===Alternate history===
&quot;The Years of Rice and Salt&quot; belongs to the alternate history subgenre of speculative fiction. The novel starts at the point of divergence with Timur turning his army away from Europe where the Black Death killed 99 percent of Europe&#x27;s population, instead of a third. Robinson explores world history from that point in AD 1405 (807 AH) to about AD 2045 (1467 AH).

Robinson&#x27;s take on alternate history is that because it &quot;is set in the same lawful universe as ours, its science must be the same [and] because its people have the same basic human needs, their societies resemble ours.&quot; Therefore, despite the difference in who specifically is there, &quot;the great majority of humanity [is] doing their work, and that work would tend to forge along at a certain pace as people tried to solve the problems of making themselves more comfortable in this world.&quot;

While most alternate histories use the Great Man theory of history, focusing on leaders, wars, and big events, Robinson writes more about social history, similar to the Annales School of historical theory and Marxist historiography, focusing on the lives of ordinary people living in their time and place. This is reflected in the title of the novel, &quot;The Years of Rice and Salt&quot;, which refers to the everyday chores of raising a family, often performed by women, despite the politics and wars of men.

Reviewers noted this allows for the &quot;history [to be] experienced by readers on a human scale&quot; and &quot;an implicit but thorough rebuke to the kind of war-gaming determinism that most alternate histories embody.&quot; The novel has characters that explore subjects like philosophy, theology, history, and scientific theory.

==Publication and reception==
Released in March 2002, the book was published in North America by Bantam Books and in the United Kingdom by HarperCollins. The paperback was released in 2003 along with a Spanish translation. In the subsequent years, other translated versions were published, in French, Polish, Chinese, and Hungarian.

The novel was well received by critics who variously called it &quot;thoughtful&quot;, &quot;realistic&quot;, and &quot;rich&quot;. In &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, the reviewers called it a &quot;highly realistic and credible alternate history&quot;, and in the &quot;School Library Journal&quot;, Christine Menefee called it &quot;an addictive, surprising, and suspenseful novel&quot;. The &quot;Library Journal&quot; &quot;highly recommended&quot; it, saying that its &quot;superb storytelling and imaginative historic speculation make [it] a priority choice for all SF and general fiction collections&quot;. The critic at &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; found it &quot;overlong, but blessed with moments of wry and gentle beauty&quot;. Likewise, Roz Kaveney stated that &quot;if there is a weakness in Robinson&#x27;s work, it is perhaps this; his characters are so intelligent that they never shut up&quot;. For &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, Sol Chrom lauded the epic scope, calling it a &quot;magnificent achievement&quot;, and for &quot;The Belfast News Letter&quot;, the reviewer called the novel &quot;extraordinary, ambitious, poetic and powerful&quot;. Science fiction critic Paul Kincaid concluded that it is &quot;a huge, complex and highly enjoyable book&quot;.

===Awards===
It won the 2003 Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel and was nominated for the Hugo Award, the Arthur C. Clarke Award, and the British Science Fiction Award.

<text>The  (, or , plural: ) was a development family of single-shot man-portable anti-tank systems developed by Nazi Germany during World War II. The weapons were the first single-use light anti-tank weapons based on a pre-loaded disposable launch tube, a weapon configuration which is still used today (a modern example being the AT4).

The -design consisted of a light recoilless launcher tube outfitted with a single pre-loaded high-explosive anti-tank warhead protruding from the muzzle. It was an inexpensive, easy-to-use anti-tank weapon for the common infantry man, being issued as a single unit of ammunition meant to be operated by a single soldier. Firing was done from under the arm at an upward angle as the effective firing range was barely beyond that of hand grenades ( max). After use the launcher was discarded.

Development of the started in 1942. The initial design was dubbed  ( &quot;fist-cartridge&quot;) and was smaller than the later designs. Later dubbed (&quot;tank-fist small&quot;), it entered service in 1943, the larger design being named (&quot;tank-fist big&quot;) and entering service in mid to late 1944. All types were used by Germany until the end of the war, with the design remaining in use in other countries for a number of years after the war.

== Development ==


The ( &quot;fist cartridge&quot;) was the initial development of what eventually became the -family. The -design was much smaller than the later -designs.

Development of the started in the summer of 1942 at the German company Hugo Schneider AG (HASAG) with the development of a smaller prototype called (&quot;little Greta&quot;) by a team headed by Doctor Heinrich Langweiler in Leipzig. The basic concept was that of a recoilless gun; in the and the , a propellent charge pushed the warhead out the front of the tube while the blast also exited the rear of the tube, balancing forces, and therefore there was no recoil force for the operator.

The following weapon, the , 30 m (&quot;fist-cartridge small&quot;) weighed and a total length of ; its projectile had a length of . The diameter of warhead was a shaped charge of of a 50:50 mix of TNT and tri-hexogen. The propellant was of of black powder, the metal launch tube had a length of and a diameter of (early models reportedly ). Fitted to the warhead was a wooden shaft with folded stabilizing fins (made of thick spring metal). These bent blades straightened into position by themselves as soon as they left the launch tube. The warhead was accelerated to a speed of , had a range of about and an armour penetration of up to of plain steel.

Soon a crude aiming device similar to the one used by the was added to the design; it was fixed at a range of . Several designations of this weapon were in use, amongst which 1 or 30 ; however, it was common to refer to this weapon simply as the . Of the earlier model, 20,000 were ordered and the first 500 were delivered by the manufacturer, HASAG, Werk Schlieben, in August 1943.


Development began in 1942 on a larger version of the . The resulting weapon was the 30, also known as ( &quot;tank-fist big&quot;) and the like, with a total weight of and total length of . The launch tube was made of low-grade steel in diameter, containing a charge of black powder propellant. Along the side of the tube were a simple folding rear sight and a trigger. The edge of the warhead was used as the front sight. The oversize warhead ( in diameter) was fitted into the front of the tube by an attached wooden tail stem with metal stabilizing fins.

The warhead weighed and contained of a 50:50 mixture of TNT and hexogen explosives, and had armour penetration of . The often had warnings written in large red letters on the upper rear end of the tube, the words usually being &quot;&quot; (&quot;Beware. Fire jet.&quot;). This was to warn soldiers to avoid the backblast.

After firing, the tube was discarded, making the the first disposable anti-tank weapon. The weapon, when correctly fired from the crook of the arm, could penetrate the armour of any armoured fighting vehicle of the period.

== Comparison of models ==
== Combat use ==
To use the , the soldier removed the safety, tucked the tube under their arm, and aimed by aligning the target, the sight and the top of the warhead. Unlike the original American M1 60 mm bazooka and the Germans&#x27; own heavier 88 mm tube-type rocket launchers based on the American ordnance piece, the did not have the usual trigger. It had a pedal-like lever near the projectile that ignited the propellant when squeezed. Because of the weapon&#x27;s short range, not only enemy tanks and infantry, but also pieces of the exploding vehicle, posed dangers to its operator. Consequently, the use of a required a degree of personal courage. The backblast from firing went back around 2 m behind the operator.

When used against tanks, the had an impressive beyond-armour effect. Compared to the bazooka and the , it made a larger hole and produced massive spalling that killed or injured the crew, due to burns and shrapnel, and destroyed equipment. One informal test found that the made an entry hole in diameter, whereas the made an entry hole at least in diameter. By contrast, the bazooka made an entry hole that was only in diameter). Much of that can be attributed not only to the size of the warhead of the , but also its horn-like shape, as opposed to the traditional cone-shaped warheads of rockets used in the bazooka and . The design was later copied in the modern-day AT-4 anti-tank weapon, producing the same effect against modern main battle tanks. 

=== Germany ===


In the Battle of Normandy, only 6% of British tank losses were from fire, despite the close-range combat in the thick bocage landscape. However, the threat from the forced Allied tank forces to wait for infantry support before advancing. The portion of British tanks taken out of action by later rose to 34%, a rise probably explained by the lack of German anti-tank guns late in the war and the increased numbers of that were available to defending German troops.

During urban combat in eastern Germany later in the war, about 70% of tanks destroyed were hit by or s. Soviet and Western Allied tank crews modified their tanks in the field to provide some protection against Panzerfaust attacks. Defensive measures included the use of logs, sandbags, track links, and concrete and wire mesh, along with bed frames with springs (bedsprings), similar to expanded metal-type German tank sideskirts. In practice, about a meter of air gap was required to substantially reduce the penetrating capability of the warhead, so sideskirts and sandbags, along with other improvised armor, were virtually ineffective against both the Panzerschreck and Panzerfaust. Moreover, the added weight from add-on armor overburdened the vehicle&#x27;s engine, transmission and suspension.

Later on, each Soviet heavy tank (IS) and assault gun (ISU-152) company was assigned a platoon of infantry in urban battles to protect them from infantry-wielded anti-tank weapons, often supported by flamethrowers. That order remained intact even during 1950s, including during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956.

During the last stages of the war, due to the lack of available weapons, many poorly-trained conscripts, mainly elderly men and teenage Hitler Youth members, were often given a single , plus any type of obsolete pistol or rifle. Some only had a Panzerfaust. That led several German generals and officers to comment sarcastically that the empty launch-tubes could then be used as clubs in hand-to-hand combat.

=== Other countries ===
Many were sold to Finland, which urgently needed them, as Finnish forces did not have enough anti-tank weapons that could penetrate heavily armoured Soviet tanks like the T-34 and IS-2. The Finnish experience with the weapon and its adaptability to Finnish needs was mixed, with only 4,000 of 25,000 delivered expended in combat. The manual that came with the weapon upon delivery to the Finns included depictions of where to aim the weapon on the Soviet T-34 and US Sherman tank (which also saw service with Soviet troops from US Lend-Lease-supplied stocks).

The Italian Social Republic (RSI) and the Government of National Unity (Hungary) also used the . Several RSI army units became skilled in anti-tank warfare and the Hungarians themselves used the extensively, especially during the Siege of Budapest. During this brutal siege, an arms factory, the Hungarian Manfred Weiss Steel and Metal Works, located on Csepel Island (within the city) kept up production of various light armaments and ammunition, included, all the way until the very last moment, when attacking Soviet troops seized the factory by the first days of 1945.

The US 82nd Airborne Division captured some in the Allied invasion of Sicily and later during the fighting in Normandy. Finding them more effective than their own bazookas, they held onto them and used them during the later stages of the French Campaign, even dropping with them into the Netherlands during Operation Market Garden. They captured an ammunition dump of near Nijmegen and used them through the Ardennes Offensive toward the end of the war.

The Soviet Red Army only incidentally used captured in 1944, but from the beginning of 1945, many became available and were actively used during the Soviet offensives of 1945, mostly in street fighting against buildings and protective covers. In February 1945, such use of captured was recommended in a directive by Marshal Georgy Zhukov. Similarly, they were used by the Polish People&#x27;s Army. After the war, some 4,000 were adopted by the Polish Army in 1949, which designated them as PG-49.

Plans and technical materials on the Panzerfaust were supplied to the Empire of Japan to assist with their development of an effective anti-tank weapon. However, the Japanese went with a different design, the Type 4, loosely based upon the American bazooka. Examples of the American weapon were captured by the Japanese at Leyte in 1944.

==Variants==


; 30 (&quot;small&quot;) or :This was the original version, first delivered in August 1943 with a total weight of and overall length of . The &quot;30&quot; was indicative of the nominal maximum range of . It had a diameter tube containing of black powder propellant launching a warhead carrying of explosive. The projectile traveled at just per second and could penetrate of armour.

; 30:An improved version also appearing in August 1943. This version had a larger warhead for improved armour penetration, of steel and of armoured steel, but the same range of 30 meters. It has an explosive charge of of explosive material. Its barrel has a caliber of and a length of . It has a weight of and a muzzle velocity of .

; 60:This was the most common version, and was completed in early 1944. However, it did not reach full production until September 1944, when 400,000 were to be produced each month. It had a much more practical range of , although with a muzzle velocity of only per second it would take 1.3 seconds for the warhead to reach a tank at that range. To achieve the higher velocity, the tube diameter was increased to and of propellant used while being a total length of . It also had an improved flip-up rear sight and trigger mechanism. The weapon now weighed . It could defeat of armour.

; 100:This was the final version produced in quantity, and was completed in September 1944. However, it did not reach full production until November 1944. It had a nominal maximum range of . of propellant launched the warhead at per second from a diameter tube. The sight had holes for 30, 60, , and had luminous paint in them to make counting up to the correct one easier in the dark. This version weighed and could penetrate of armour.

; 150:A major redesign of the , the 150 featured a new pointed warhead (with a diameter of 105 mm compared to the 140 mm warhead of the 30/60/100 series) with increased armour penetration and two-stage propellant ignition which gave a higher velocity of per second. A fragmentation sleeve was developed for the 150 to increase its lethality against infantry. The projectile had a delay pellet to the base detonating primer which meant that the projectile exploded after three seconds if it didn&#x27;t hit its target or a hard surface. This was meant to eliminate duds and also allowed for air bursts to be achieved when combined with the fragmentation sleeve. Production the 150 started in February 1945 and continued until May of that year when the facility in Döbeln, Saxony producing the 150 was captured by the Soviets. Although 100,000 were produced, none were issued to field units beyond limited troop trials. No known examples of the 150 survived the end of the war. A further development of the &quot;Panzerfaust&quot; 150 was meant to make it a reloadable weapon, capable of firing ten shots before the black powder fouling built up to the point that the weapon needed to be inspected and cleaned. This development was to be completed in May 1945, with production of the improved 150 scheduled to commence in the summer of that year. &quot;The reloadable Pzf 150 might have received a new designation if it had been produced.&quot;

; 250:The last development of the series was the 250. Intended to replace the heavier in German service, this design never left the drawing board. It was to use a reloadable tube and featured a pistol grip. The projectile was to be based on the one used by the 150, but the internal propellant charge was to be larger. Projected muzzle velocity was 120–150 m/s. Serial production was scheduled to begin in September 1945. The Soviet RPG-2 anti-tank weapon took some inspiration from the 250 design (it was also a reloadable, recoilless anti-tank weapon with a trigger grip and electrical firing system). Plans for the 250 had fallen into both American and Soviet hands.

== Related development ==
;&quot;PAPI&quot;: Argentine-made antitank weapon, similar to the . The acronym stands for &quot;proyectil antitanque para infanteria&quot; (Spanish for &quot;infantry anti-tank projectile&quot;).

; m/45 and m/46: Swedish-made copies of the . The Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration ordered a copy of the design from Bofors, examples of which were acquired from Finland and the Danish resistance movement. The resulting weapon, a copy of an early model , was designated m/45 and 10,000 were ordered by the Swedish Armed Forces in late 1945. Albeit judged effective against tanks of the day, the muzzle velocity was low and the effective range was only about 70 meters. m/45 was quickly upgraded by replacing the black powder propellant charge with smokeless powder. The resulting weapon, m/46, had an effective range of about 90 meters.

;: Polish-made copy of the Panzerfaust 100, manufactured in 1951–1952. Despite large-scale orders, a production encountered technological difficulties and only 5000 combat and 940 training Pc-100 were made in 1952, before the Polish Army switched to more modern Soviet RPG-2. It is erroneously known as PT-100 in foreign publications.

<text>In theoretical linguistics and computational linguistics, probabilistic context free grammars (PCFGs) extend context-free grammars, similar to how hidden Markov models extend regular grammars. Each production is assigned a probability. The probability of a derivation (parse) is the product of the probabilities of the productions used in that derivation. These probabilities can be viewed as parameters of the model, and for large problems it is convenient to learn these parameters via machine learning. A probabilistic grammar&#x27;s validity is constrained by context of its training dataset.

PCFGs originated from grammar theory, and have application in areas as diverse as natural language processing to the study the structure of RNA molecules and design of programming languages. Designing efficient PCFGs has to weigh factors of scalability and generality. Issues such as grammar ambiguity must be resolved. The grammar design affects results accuracy. Grammar parsing algorithms have various time and memory requirements.

==Definitions==
Derivation: The process of recursive generation of strings from a grammar.
Parsing: Finding a valid derivation using an automaton.

Parse Tree: The alignment of the grammar to a sequence.

An example of a parser for PCFG grammars is the pushdown automaton. The algorithm parses grammar nonterminals from left to right in a stack-like manner. This brute-force approach is not very efficient. In RNA secondary structure prediction variants of the Cocke–Younger–Kasami (CYK) algorithm provide more efficient alternatives to grammar parsing than pushdown automata. Another example of a PCFG parser is the Stanford Statistical Parser which has been trained using Treebank.

== Formal definition ==
Similar to a CFG, a probabilistic context-free grammar can be defined by a quintuple:

:formula_1

where 
* is the set of non-terminal symbols
* is the set of terminal symbols
* is the set of production rules
* is the start symbol
* is the set of probabilities on production rules

==Relation with hidden Markov models==
PCFGs models extend context-free grammars the same way as hidden Markov models extend regular grammars.

The Inside-Outside algorithm is an analogue of the Forward-Backward algorithm. It computes the total probability of all derivations that are consistent with a given sequence, based on some PCFG. This is equivalent to the probability of the PCFG generating the sequence, and is intuitively a measure of how consistent the sequence is with the given grammar. The Inside-Outside algorithm is used in model parametrization to estimate prior frequencies observed from training sequences in the case of RNAs.

Dynamic programming variants of the CYK algorithm find the Viterbi parse of a RNA sequence for a PCFG model. This parse is the most likely derivation of the sequence by the given PCFG.

==Grammar construction==
Context-free grammars are represented as a set of rules inspired from attempts to model natural languages. The rules are absolute and have a typical syntax representation known as Backus–Naur form. The production rules consist of terminal formula_2 and non-terminal symbols and a blank formula_3 may also be used as an end point. In the production rules of CFG and PCFG the left side has only one nonterminal whereas the right side can be any string of terminal or nonterminals. In PCFG nulls are excluded. An example of a grammar:
: formula_4 
This grammar can be shortened using the &#x27;|&#x27; (&#x27;or&#x27;) character into:

: formula_5

Terminals in a grammar are words and through the grammar rules a non-terminal symbol is transformed into a string of either terminals and/or non-terminals. The above grammar is read as &quot;beginning from a non-terminal the emission can generate either or or formula_3&quot;.
Its derivation is: 
: formula_7

Ambiguous grammar may result in ambiguous parsing if applied on homographs since the same word sequence can have more than one interpretation. Pun sentences such as the newspaper headline &quot;Iraqi Head Seeks Arms&quot; are an example of ambiguous parses.

One strategy of dealing with ambiguous parses (originating with grammarians as early as Pāṇini) is to add yet more rules, or prioritize them so that one rule takes precedence over others. This, however, has the drawback of proliferating the rules, often to the point where they become difficult to manage. Another difficulty is overgeneration, where unlicensed structures are also generated.

Probabilistic grammars circumvent these problems by ranking various productions on frequency weights, resulting in a &quot;most likely&quot; (winner-take-all) interpretation. As usage patterns are altered in diachronic shifts, these probabilistic rules can be re-learned, thus updating the grammar.

Assigning probability to production rules makes a PCFG. These probabilities are informed by observing distributions on a training set of similar composition to the language to be modeled. On most samples of broad language, probabilistic grammars where probabilities are estimated from data typically outperform hand-crafted grammars. CFGs when contrasted with PCFGs are not applicable to RNA structure prediction because while they incorporate sequence-structure relationship they lack the scoring metrics that reveal a sequence structural potential 

==Weighted context-free grammar==
A weighted context-free grammar (WCFG) is a more general category of context-free grammar, where each production has a numeric weight associated with it. The weight of a specific parse tree in a WCFG is the product (or sum ) of all rule weights in the tree. Each rule weight is included as often as the rule is used in the tree. A special case of WCFGs are PCFGs, where the weights are (logarithms of ) probabilities.

An extended version of the CYK algorithm can be used to find the &quot;lightest&quot; (least-weight) derivation of a string given some WCFG.

When the tree weight is the product of the rule weights, WCFGs and PCFGs can express the same set of probability distributions.

==Applications==

===RNA structure prediction===
Since the 1990s, PCFG has been applied to model RNA structures.

Energy minimization and PCFG provide ways of predicting RNA secondary structure with comparable performance. However structure prediction by PCFGs is scored probabilistically rather than by minimum free energy calculation. PCFG model parameters are directly derived from frequencies of different features observed in databases of RNA structures rather than by experimental 
determination as is the case with energy minimization methods.

The types of various structure that can be modeled by a PCFG include long range interactions, pairwise structure and other nested structures. However, pseudoknots can not be modeled. PCFGs extend CFG by assigning probabilities to each production rule. A maximum probability parse tree from the grammar implies a maximum probability structure. Since RNAs preserve their structures over their primary sequence, RNA structure prediction can be guided by combining evolutionary information from comparative sequence analysis with biophysical knowledge about a structure plausibility based on such probabilities. Also search results for structural homologs using PCFG rules are scored according to PCFG derivations probabilities. Therefore, building grammar to model the behavior of base-pairs and single-stranded regions starts with exploring features of structural multiple sequence alignment of related RNAs. 
: formula_8

The above grammar generates a string in an outside-in fashion, that is the basepair on the furthest extremes of the terminal is derived first. So a string such as formula_9 is derived by first generating the distal &#x27;s on both sides before moving inwards:
: formula_10

A PCFG model extendibility allows constraining structure prediction by incorporating expectations about different features of an RNA . Such expectation may reflect for example the propensity for assuming a certain structure by an RNA. However incorporation of too much information may increase PCFG space and memory complexity and it is desirable that a PCFG-based model be as simple as possible.

Every possible string a grammar generates is assigned a probability weight formula_11 given the PCFG model formula_12. It follows that the sum of all probabilities to all possible grammar productions is formula_13. The scores for each paired and unpaired residue explain likelihood for secondary structure formations. Production rules also allow scoring loop lengths as well as the order of base pair stacking hence it is possible to explore the range of all possible generations including suboptimal structures from the grammar and accept or reject structures based on score thresholds.

====Implementations====
RNA secondary structure implementations based on PCFG approaches can be utilized in :
* Finding consensus structure by optimizing structure joint probabilities over MSA.
* Modeling base-pair covariation to detecting homology in database searches.
* pairwise simultaneous folding and alignment.

Different implementation of these approaches exist. For example, Pfold is used in secondary structure prediction from a group of related RNA sequences, covariance models are used in searching databases for homologous sequences and RNA annotation and classification, RNApromo, CMFinder and TEISER are used in finding stable structural motifs in RNAs.

====Design considerations====
PCFG design impacts the secondary structure prediction accuracy. Any useful structure prediction probabilistic model based on PCFG has to maintain simplicity without much compromise to prediction accuracy. Too complex a model of excellent performance on a single sequence may not scale. A grammar based model should be able to:
* Find the optimal alignment between a sequence and the PCFG.
* Score the probability of the structures for the sequence and subsequences.
* Parameterize the model by training on sequences/structures.
* Find the optimal grammar parse tree (CYK algorithm).
* Check for ambiguous grammar (Conditional Inside algorithm).

The resulting of multiple parse trees per grammar denotes grammar ambiguity. This may be useful in revealing all possible base-pair structures for a grammar. However an optimal structure is the one where there is one and only one correspondence between the parse tree and the secondary structure.

Two types of ambiguities can be distinguished. Parse tree ambiguity and structural ambiguity. Structural ambiguity does not affect thermodynamic approaches as the optimal structure selection is always on the basis of lowest free energy scores. Parse tree ambiguity concerns the existence of multiple parse trees per sequence. Such an ambiguity can reveal all possible base-paired structures for the sequence by generating all possible parse trees then finding the optimal one. In the case of structural ambiguity multiple parse trees describe the same secondary structure. This obscures the CYK algorithm decision on finding an optimal structure as the correspondence between the parse tree and the structure is not unique. Grammar ambiguity can be checked for by the conditional-inside algorithm.

====Building a PCFG model====
A probabilistic context free grammar consists of terminal and nonterminal variables. Each feature to be modeled has a production rule that is assigned a probability estimated from a training set of RNA structures. Production rules are recursively applied until only terminal residues are left.

A starting non-terminal formula_14 produces loops. The rest of the grammar proceeds with parameter formula_15 that decide whether a loop is a start of a stem or a single stranded region and parameter formula_16 that produces paired bases.

The formalism of this simple PCFG looks like:
: formula_17
: formula_18
: formula_19

The application of PCFGs in predicting structures is a multi-step process. In addition, the PCFG itself can be incorporated into probabilistic models that consider RNA evolutionary history or search homologous sequences in databases. In an evolutionary history context inclusion of prior distributions of RNA structures of a structural alignment in the production rules of the PCFG facilitates good prediction accuracy.

A summary of general steps for utilizing PCFGs in various scenarios:
* Generate production rules for the sequences.
* Check ambiguity.
* Recursively generate parse trees of the possible structures using the grammar. 
* Rank and score the parse trees for the most plausible sequence.

====Algorithms====
Several algorithms dealing with aspects of PCFG based probabilistic models in RNA structure prediction exist. For instance the inside-outside algorithm and the CYK algorithm. The inside-outside algorithm is a recursive dynamic programming scoring algorithm that can follow expectation-maximization paradigms. It computes the total probability of all derivations that are consistent with a given sequence, based on some PCFG. The inside part scores the subtrees from a parse tree and therefore subsequences probabilities given an PCFG. The outside part scores the probability of the complete parse tree for a full sequence. CYK modifies the inside-outside scoring. Note that the term &#x27;CYK algorithm&#x27; describes the CYK variant of the inside algorithm that finds an optimal parse tree for a sequence using a PCFG. It extends the actual CYK algorithm used in non-probabilistic CFGs.

The inside algorithm calculates formula_20 probabilities for all formula_21 of a parse subtree rooted at formula_22 for subsequence formula_23. Outside algorithm calculates formula_24 probabilities of a complete parse tree for sequence from root excluding the calculation of formula_23. The variables and refine the estimation of probability parameters of an PCFG. It is possible to reestimate the PCFG algorithm by finding the expected number of times a state is used in a derivation through summing all the products of and divided by the probability for a sequence given the model formula_11. It is also possible to find the expected number of times a production rule is used by an expectation-maximization that utilizes the values of and . The CYK algorithm calculates formula_27 to find the most probable parse tree formula_28 and yields formula_29.

Memory and time complexity for general PCFG algorithms in RNA structure predictions are formula_30 and formula_31 respectively. Restricting a PCFG may alter this requirement as is the case with database searches methods.

====PCFG in homology search====
Covariance models (CMs) are a special type of PCFGs with applications in database searches for homologs, annotation and RNA classification. Through CMs it is possible to build PCFG-based RNA profiles where related RNAs can be represented by a consensus secondary structure. The RNA analysis package Infernal uses such profiles in inference of RNA alignments. The Rfam database also uses CMs in classifying RNAs into families based on their structure and sequence information.

CMs are designed from a consensus RNA structure. A CM allows indels of unlimited length in the alignment. Terminals constitute states in the CM and the transition probabilities between the states is 1 if no indels are considered. Grammars in a CM are as follows:

:; formula_32:probabilities of pairwise interactions between 16 possible pairs
:; formula_33:probabilities of generating 4 possible single bases on the left
:; formula_34:probabilities of generating 4 possible single bases on the right
:; formula_35:bifurcation with a probability of 1
:; formula_36:start with a probability of 1
:; formula_37:end with a probability of 1

The model has 6 possible states and each state grammar includes different types of secondary structure probabilities of the non-terminals. The states are connected by transitions. Ideally current node states connect to all insert states and subsequent node states connect to non-insert states. In order to allow insertion of more than one base insert states connect to themselves.

In order to score a CM model the inside-outside algorithms are used. CMs use a slightly different implementation of CYK. Log-odds emission scores for the optimum parse tree - formula_38 - are calculated out of the emitting states formula_39. Since these scores are a function of sequence length a more discriminative measure to recover an optimum parse tree probability score- formula_40 - is reached by limiting the maximum length of the sequence to be aligned and calculating the log-odds relative to a null. The computation time of this step is linear to the database size and the algorithm has a memory complexity of formula_41.

==== Example: Using evolutionary information to guide structure prediction ====
The KH-99 algorithm by Knudsen and Hein lays the basis of the Pfold approach to predicting RNA secondary structure. In this approach the parameterization requires evolutionary history information derived from an alignment tree in addition to probabilities of columns and mutations. The grammar probabilities are observed from a training dataset.

===== Estimate column probabilities for paired and unpaired bases =====
In a structural alignment the probabilities of the unpaired bases columns and the paired bases columns are independent of other columns. By counting bases in single base positions and paired positions one obtains the frequencies of bases in loops and stems.
For basepair and an occurrence of formula_42 is also counted as an occurrence of formula_43. Identical basepairs such as formula_44 are counted twice.

===== Calculate mutation rates for paired and unpaired bases =====
By pairing sequences in all possible ways overall mutation rates are estimated. In order to recover plausible mutations a sequence identity threshold should be used so that the comparison is between similar sequences. This approach uses 85% identity threshold between pairing sequences. 
First single base positions differences -except for gapped columns- between sequence pairs are counted such that if the same position in two sequences had different bases the count of the difference is incremented for each sequence.
 +1&lt;/math&gt; first sequence pair}}
 +1&lt;/math&gt; second sequence pair}}
 = &lt;/math&gt; mutation of base X to base Y formula_45}}
 = &lt;/math&gt; the negative of the rate of X mutation to other bases formula_46}}

For unpaired bases a 4 X 4 mutation rate matrix is used that satisfies that the mutation flow from X to Y is reversible:
: formula_47 
For basepairs a 16 X 16 rate distribution matrix is similarly generated.
The PCFG is used to predict the prior probability distribution of the structure whereas posterior probabilities are estimated by the inside-outside algorithm and the most likely structure is found by the CYK algorithm.

===== Estimate alignment probabilities =====
After calculating the column prior probabilities the alignment probability is estimated by summing over all possible secondary structures. Any column in a secondary structure formula_48 for a sequence of length such that formula_49 can be scored with respect to the alignment tree and the mutational model . The prior distribution given by the PCFG is formula_50. The phylogenetic tree, can be calculated from the model by maximum likelihood estimation. Note that gaps are treated as unknown bases and the summation can be done through dynamic programming. 
: formula_51
: formula_52
: formula_53
: formula_54

===== Assign production probabilities to each rule in the grammar =====
Each structure in the grammar is assigned production probabilities devised from the structures of the training dataset. These prior probabilities give weight to predictions accuracy. The number of times each rule is used depends on the observations from the training dataset for that particular grammar feature. These probabilities are written in parentheses in the grammar formalism and each rule will have a total of 100%. For instance:

: formula_55
: formula_56
: formula_57

===== Predict the structure likelihood =====
Given the prior alignment frequencies of the data the most likely structure from the ensemble predicted by the grammar can then be computed by maximizing formula_58 through the CYK algorithm. The structure with the highest predicted number of correct predictions is reported as the consensus structure.

: formula_59

===== Pfold improvements on the KH-99 algorithm =====
PCFG based approaches are desired to be scalable and general enough. Compromising speed for accuracy needs to as minimal as possible. Pfold addresses the limitations of the KH-99 algorithm with respect to scalability, gaps, speed and accuracy. 
*In Pfold gaps are treated as unknown. In this sense the probability of a gapped column equals that of an ungapped one. 
*In Pfold the tree is calculated prior to structure prediction through neighbor joining and not by maximum likelihood through the PCFG grammar. Only the branch lengths are adjusted to maximum likelihood estimates. 
*An assumption of Pfold is that all sequences have the same structure. Sequence identity threshold and allowing a 1% probability that any nucleotide becomes another limit the performance deterioration due to alignment errors.

===Protein sequence analysis===
Whereas PCFGs have proved powerful tools for predicting RNA secondary structure, usage in the field of protein sequence analysis has been limited. Indeed, the size of the amino acid alphabet and the variety of interactions seen in proteins make grammar inference much more challenging. As a consequence, most applications of formal language theory to protein analysis have been mainly restricted to the production of grammars of lower expressive power to model simple functional patterns based on local interactions. Since protein structures commonly display higher-order dependencies including nested and crossing relationships, they clearly exceed the capabilities of any CFG. Still, development of PCFGs allows expressing some of those dependencies and providing the ability to model a wider range of protein patterns.

<text>Los Tres is a Chilean rock band, formed in 1987 in Concepción by Álvaro Henríquez, Roberto &quot;Titae&quot; Lindl, Francisco Molina and Ángel Parra Jr. They are one of the most influential rock en español bands.

== History ==

The origins of the band go back to the Concepción of 1982, when three friends from the Charles de Gaulle school, Álvaro Henríquez Petinelli, Roberto Titae Lindl Romero, and Francisco Molina Cornejo, decided to form the band &quot;Dick Stones.&quot; Together with Gilles Marie, Rodolfo Lindl and Fernando Saavedra, they appeared in bars, universities and local events to sing songs by Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry and Gene Vincent. Later, Henriquez and Titae would join drummer Andrés Valdovinos to form the band Escalimetros.

In 1984, Henríquez and Lindl, together with guitarist Jorge Yogui Alvarado (future leader of the Chilean band &quot;Emociones Clandestinas&quot;), changed the name of their band to &quot;Los Ilegales&quot;. Lindl returned from Austria, where he came to work with the Salzburg Symphony Orchestra, and in March 1987, Álvaro, Titae and Pancho committed to a more professional job under the name &quot;Los Tres&quot;, shortly before a concert at the Lord Cochrane gymnasium. His debut was in 1987 at the Mapocho Cultural Center, Santiago de Chile. 

However, Roberto Lindl joined the Youth Symphony Orchestra for a time as a double bass player, and Álvaro Henríquez strengthened ties with theatrical circles and one of his first commissions was to musicalize the work &quot; Y Warhol &quot; (1988). The definitive impulse for the trio came with the incorporation of Ángel Parra, a guitarist who had until then had a long instrumental preparation and several studies in Paris and California. The price received by Chilean rock was very low and in addition to that, the first self-titled album by Los Tres published at the Le Trianon restaurant on September 4, 1991, took a long time to be taken into account by the national media.

During their adolescence, penquistas worked on many of the songs on that first album. (&quot;Penquista&quot; is a Chilean term used to refer to the inhabitants or natives of Concepcion.) Later the Rock &amp; Pop radio gradually turned Los Tres into a popular name. The band passed from Alerce to Sony Music and they published &quot;Se Remata el Siglo&quot; in 1993. Los Tres had a foreign producer, in this case the Argentinian Mario Breuer. The release of the album, at the Oz discoteque, had the character of a social event. Rougher than their 1991 debut and they even cited AC/DC as one of their influences. Although this album facilitated Los Tres&#x27;s passage to massive status, the members later stated that they were never satisfied with Breuer&#x27;s production, since &quot;it was very strange for us to work with a guy who tried to achieve an average between us and &quot;La Ley&quot;.&quot;

In June 1994, they made a series of presentations in the SCD room in Santiago together with Roberto Parra embodied in the 1998 album &quot;Peineta&quot;, and in 1995, Los Tres released &quot;La espada y la pared&quot;, an album that in that same year peaked at No. 1. On September 14 of that same year, Los Tres became the first Chilean group to be invited to the unplugged party that for a few years, had been animating the MTV-Latino video music chain. The band traveled to Miami and recorded their participation with the collaboration of Cuti Aste and guitarist Antonio Restucci, combining in it a repertoire of greatest hits along with a new song &quot;Traje desastre&quot; and three tribute titles to the Chilean singer-songwriter Roberto Parra, who died a few months prior to that event. The album corresponding to the show, Los Tres unplugged (1996) became a sales phenomenon that defied any marketing theory that, until then, was handled in the Chilean music industry. Since in that sam,e year it won 110,000 copies, much more than &quot;Neither by reason, nor by force&quot; by Los Prisioneros.

In February of that year, the group had debuted at the Viña del Mar Festival, paying tribute to their school friendship with Charles de Gaulle uniforms on stage. Furthermore, Álvaro Henríquez was greatly influenced by the Chilean singer-songwriter Roberto Parra. For the band, the Chilean cueca became a major genre, which they sought to address according to a more modern approach, hence the tradition of eighteenth-century parties that the group inaugurated in 1996 under the name La Yein Fonda, and that for For the first time, it brought together cuequeros, cumbiancheros and rockers on the same stage. In 1997 they participated in a mega-concert at the Estadio Nacional known as &quot;Made in Chile&quot;, in which they joined together with Los Jaivas and Illapu.

In 1997, &quot;Fome&quot; was released, an album of fierce electricity and uncomfortable verses about fame, violent deaths and boredom; &quot;I rented myself&quot; and &quot;I hit rock bottom&quot; were two eloquent titles. The latter was a work recorded in the town of Woodstock, near New York, and that made the group&#x27;s sales drop due to its demanding sound. A little later, a box appeared containing the band&#x27;s first four studio albums. The efforts they invested in reproducing their success in the Mexican market gradually wore down their internal relationships, since their music was not the universal pop of La Ley, and their type of rock demanded more explanations than the group was willing to do. On successive trips starting in 1995, Los Tres offered presentations in venues of moderate capacity and the occasional massive gathering, such as at the Guadalajara Book Fair in 1999.

Although all their albums were released in that market, the band never seemed completely convinced of the price to pay for continental fame, like the one La Ley was pursuing at the time: &quot;We would never move to Mexico. I went to Chile because it is a very small country&quot; they affirmed. The group had an amazing subsequent recognition from that country, when the successful Cafe Tacuba chose six of their songs to publish the tribute album, &quot;Vale callampa&quot; in 2002.

<doc id="299340" wikidata="Q4996629" url="?curid=299340" title="Bull Shoals Lake">
<text>Bull Shoals Lake is an artificial lake or reservoir in the Ozark Mountains of northern Arkansas and southern Missouri, United States. It has hundreds of miles of lake arms and coves, and common activities include boating, water sports, swimming, and fishing. Nineteen developed parks around the shoreline provide campgrounds, boat launches, swim areas, and marinas.

== History ==
Bull Shoals Dam was created to impound the White River by one of the largest concrete dams in the United States and was the fifth largest dam in the world at its inception. Work on the dam began in 1947, was completed in 1951 and dedicated by President Harry S. Truman in 1952. At least seven small family cemeteries and 20 larger cemeteries were meticulously relocated to accommodate the new lake.
Recent national events include Brostock 2010 and 2011 and the TBF Bass Federation and Bassmaster Elite Series Tournaments in 2012.

== Hydrology ==
Bull Shoals Lake impounds the White River for the last time as water travels toward its mouth on the Mississippi River. Bull Shoals is thus the lake farthest downstream in a chain of four artificial lakes that include (from upstream to downstream) Beaver Lake, Table Rock Lake and Lake Taneycomo. The lake is controlled by the Army Corps of Engineers and has the primary purpose of flood control. The level of the lake fluctuates regularly with a normal pool level elevation of above sea level, which is locally known as powerpool. However, the lake regularly fluctuates between an elevation of . The upper part of the lake, below nearby Powersite Dam, is known as the &quot;Pothole&quot;.

The shoreline of the lake is undeveloped and protected by a buffer zone (locally called the &quot;take line&quot;) owned, operated, managed, and controlled by the Army Corps of Engineers. The dam is designed for a maximum elevation of (top of the flood pool). Bull Shoals Lake covers with a shoreline at powerpool to more than with a shoreline at . The bottom of the lake consists of bedrock with very limited vegetation. The shoreline is heavily forested.

== State park ==

The Bull Shoals-White River State Park is a park in Baxter and Marion Counties of Arkansas both above and below the massive dam. Facilities, including camping, pavilions, dock and interpretive programs, stretch along the banks of the White River. Along the lakeshore, the park offers picnic sites and playgrounds.

==Flooding in 2008 and 2011==
In the spring of 2008, due to the record rainfall, Bull Shoals reached its highest water level since 1957. The lake crested at above sea level, prompting the Army Corps of Engineers to open the floodgates to relieve the lake from further flooding. A record crest of was achieved at 5 p.m. on May 27, 2011, due to record rainfall, exceeding the Spring 2008 lake levels and 1957 levels.

<doc id="299356" wikidata="Q7713567" url="?curid=299356" title="The American Spectator">
<text>The American Spectator is a conservative American magazine covering news and politics, edited by R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr. and published by the non-profit American Spectator Foundation. It was founded in 1967 by Tyrrell (the current editor-in-chief) and Wladyslaw Pleszczynski (its editorial director as of 1980). 

The magazine has featured the writings of the several authors such as Malcolm Gladwell, Greg Gutfeld and Dinesh D&#x27;Souza. Current frequently contributing writings include Daniel Flynn, Paul Kengor, Robert Stacy McCain, Scott McKay, George Neumayr, and George Parry. 

It gained popularity in the 1990s during its investigation of Bill Clinton under what became known as its Arkansas Project. During this same time period, &quot;The American Spectator&quot; received a $1.8 million donation from Richard Mellon Scaife. Despite this success, the magazine has not been able to maintain the circulation it reached at this time and has since been accused of &quot;hit jobs&quot;, lack of corroboration, and denial of the scientific consensus around global warming.

== History ==
The magazine &quot;American Spectator&quot; is published by the nonprofit media organization American Spectator Foundation. The foundation itself was founded in 1969, with &quot;the stated goal of bringing quality journalism to the forefront of the national political conversation&quot;.

The magazine&#x27;s circulation increased tenfold during the investigation of Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton under what became known as its &quot;Arkansas Project&quot;.

However, American political commentator Rush Limbaugh has been credited for the popularity of &quot;The American Spectator&quot;, due to his free promotion of the magazine and the paid advertisements on Limbaugh&#x27;s radio and TV shows, which reached an audience of 20 million.

Following financial shortfalls, including a resistance from Tyrell to have the Arkansas Project audited, &quot;The American Spectator&quot; was sold to George Gilder, leading to layoffs and a relocation to Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Circulation has not returned to the near 300,000 that the magazine saw during its investigation of the Clintons.

== Controversies ==
In the early 1990s, &quot;The American Spectator&quot; published two lengthy essays by writer David Brock, &quot;The Real Anita Hill&quot; and the &quot;Troopergate story&quot;, both of alleged inappropriate behavior by then-President Bill Clinton. Brock has since denounced the former article in the 2003 book &quot;Blinded by the Right: the Conscience of an Ex-Conservative&quot;, in which he states that the article caused the magazine&#x27;s content to move &quot;away from thoughtful essays and scholarly reviews and humor pieces&quot; to &quot;hit jobs&quot;.

In 2011, Assistant Editor Patrick Howley published a piece detailing his infiltration of a protest in Washington, D.C. In the article, Howley asserts his aim to &quot;mock and undermine&quot; the protest against American imperialism, and writes in the first person about his experiences protesting at the National Air and Space Museum. This article, and the methods detailed within, was condemned by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Atlantic&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Atlantic Wire&quot; blog, and &quot;The Economist&quot;, because they believed the correspondents who worked on the story had conflated journalism and politics. Matt Steinglass of &quot;The Economist&quot; wrote that Howley &quot;winds up offering a vision of politics as a kind of self-focused performance art, or perhaps (to say the same thing) a version of &quot;Jackass&quot;.&quot;

In September 2020, the American Spectator Foundation filed a lawsuit in federal court against Press Holdings Media Group, a for-profit company that owns the British conservative magazine &quot;The Spectator&quot;. The lawsuit alleged that the company used &quot;American Spectator&quot;&#x27;s trademark name and imagery when publishing the Spectator USA website and the U.S. version of their magazine.

&quot;The American Spectator&quot; has been criticized for its &quot;hype and hysteria&quot; and &quot;out-of-control screeds that attack the obvious suspects and lack corroboration&quot;. The environmental campaigning organization Greenpeace claims that the magazine is part of a supposed &quot;conservative media network with clear Koch influence [that] serves as a reliable platform for attacks on the scientific consensus of global warming&quot;.

==Online publication==

The magazine&#x27;s final monthly print publication was released in July/August 2014. While &quot;The American Spectator&quot; did issue a September/October PDF-only version late in mid-November 2014, the masthead still claimed that it was &quot;published monthly, except for combined July/Aug and Jan/Feb issues.&quot; A note from Editorial Director Wladyslaw Pleszczynski admitted that &quot;...we have some problems of our own.&quot; Pleszczynski added that the issue &quot;was ready for release well over a month ago but for reasons affecting many a print publication these days couldn&#x27;t be published on actual pages and after considerable delay is now being released in digital form only.&quot; Subsequently, online publications have become permanent and available.

The latest editions of the magazine:

* Summer 2021 Magazine &quot;The Biden Economy&quot;
* Winter 2020 Magazine &quot;Liberty in Crisis&quot;
* Summer 2020 Magazine &quot;Make America Great – Yet Again&quot;
* Fall 2019 Magazine &quot;Technical Difficulties&quot;

<doc id="299359" wikidata="Q1188786" url="?curid=299359" title="Kyushu University">
<text>, abbreviated to , is a public research university located in Fukuoka, Japan, on the island of Kyushu.

Founded in 1911 as the fourth Imperial University in Japan, it has been recognised as a leading institution of higher education and research in Kyushu, Japan, and beyond.

The history of the university began a few decades before its founding when the medical school of the Fukuoka Domain was established in 1867, the final year of the Edo period. The school was reorganised as the Fukuoka Medical College of Kyoto Imperial University in 1903. It became independent as Kyushu Imperial University in 1911. 

== History ==
In 1867, the Fukuoka Domain established a medical school called &quot;Sanshikan&quot; in Tenjin, Fukuoka. Although closed in 1872, its affiliated hospital continued operating and evolved over time. By 1879, it became part of the Fukuoka Prefectural Fukuoka Medical School, later continuing as the Fukuoka Prefectural Fukuoka Hospital.

The push for an imperial university in Kyushu led to the establishment of Fukuoka Medical College in 1903 as a branch of Kyoto Imperial University. Financial challenges delayed further development until the Furukawa Zaibatsu&#x27;s donation in 1906 facilitated the establishment of Kyushu Imperial University in 1911, with Kenjiro Yamakawa, former president of the University of Tokyo, as its first president.

Kyushu University dates its medical faculty&#x27;s founding to 1903 and the university&#x27;s establishment to 1911. In 1947, it was renamed Kyushu University, and in 1949, it expanded by incorporating several local educational institutions.

On July 3, 2009, Kyushu University was chosen for the “Global 30 (G30) Project”.

== Organisation ==
Kyushu University&#x27;s incumbent president is Tatsuro Ishibashi, who was elected in 2020 and is expected to serve until September 2026.

The university has 16 faculties, 11 undergraduate schools, and 18 graduate schools.

== Kyushu University Hospital ==
Kyushu University Hospital, with historical roots in the 1867 &quot;Sanseikan&quot; established by the Kuroda Clan, evolved significantly over time. Initially a clinic for a medical institution, it became affiliated with the Fukuoka Prefectural Medical School in 1879. In 1903, it became associated with the newly formed Fukuoka Medical College, a branch of Kyoto Imperial University. The establishment of Kyushu Imperial University in 1911 brought the hospital under its Faculty of Medicine. Post-World War II reforms in 1947 led to its rebranding as the Kyushu University Faculty of Medical Sciences Affiliated Hospital, incorporating various departments, including dental science. The hospital underwent further transformations, merging in 2003 with hospitals from the Faculty of Dental Science and Medical Institute of Bioregulation to form the current Kyushu University Hospital. 

The hospital&#x27;s history also includes a dark chapter in 1945, involving fatal and torturous medical experiments including live dissection on American POWs by the university&#x27;s medical faculty, resulting in war crimes convictions.

<text>The Constitution Act, 1982 () is a part of the Constitution of Canada. The Act was introduced as part of Canada&#x27;s process of patriating the constitution, introducing several amendments to the &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot;, including re-naming it the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;. In addition to patriating the Constitution, the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot; enacted the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;; guaranteed rights of the Aboriginal peoples of Canada; entrenched provincial jurisdiction over natural resources; provided for future constitutional conferences; and set out the procedures for amending the Constitution in the future.

This process was necessary because, after the &quot;Statute of Westminster, 1931&quot;, Canada allowed the British Parliament to retain the power to amend Canada&#x27;s constitution, until Canadian governments could agree on an all-in-Canada amending formula. In 1981, following substantial agreement on a new amending formula, the Parliament of Canada requested that the Parliament of the United Kingdom give up its power to amend the Constitution of Canada. The enactment of the &quot;Canada Act 1982&quot; by the British Parliament in March 1982 confirmed the Patriation of the Constitution and transferred to Canada the power of amending its own Constitution.

On April 17, 1982, Queen Elizabeth II and Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, as well as the Minister of Justice, Jean Chrétien, and André Ouellet, the Registrar General, signed the Proclamation which brought the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot; into force. The proclamation confirmed that Canada had formally assumed authority over its constitution, the final step to full sovereignty.

, the Government of Quebec has never formally approved of the enactment of the act, though the Supreme Court concluded that Quebec&#x27;s formal consent was never necessary and 15 years after ratification the government of Quebec &quot;passed a resolution authorizing an amendment.&quot; Nonetheless, the lack of formal approval has remained a persistent political issue in Quebec. The Meech Lake and Charlottetown Accords were designed to secure approval from Quebec, but both efforts failed to do so.

== Part I: &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; ==
The &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; is the part I of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;. The Charter is a bill of rights to protect certain political rights, legal rights and human rights of people in Canada from the policies and actions of all levels of government. An additional goal of the Charter is to unify Canadians around a set of principles that embody those rights. The Charter was preceded by the &quot;Canadian Bill of Rights&quot;, which was created by the government of John Diefenbaker in 1960. However, the &quot;Bill of Rights&quot; was only a federal statute and was limited in its effectiveness because it is not directly applicable to provincial laws. This motivated some within government to establish unambiguously-constitutional-level bill of rights for all Canadians. The movement for human rights and freedoms that emerged after World War II also wanted to entrench the principles enunciated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Charter was drafted by the federal government with consultations with the provincial governments in the years leading up to the passage of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;.

One of the most notable effects of the adoption of the Charter was to greatly expand the range of judicial review, because the Charter is more explicit with respect to the guarantee of rights and the role of judges in enforcing them than was the &quot;Canadian Bill of Rights&quot;. The courts, when confronted with violations of Charter rights, have struck down unconstitutional statutes or parts of statutes, as they did when Canadian case law was primarily concerned with resolving issues of federalism. However, section 24 of the Charter granted new powers to the courts to enforce more creative remedies and to exclude improperly obtained evidence in criminal trials. These powers are greater than what was typical under the common law and under the principle of Parliamentary supremacy, which Canada had inherited from the United Kingdom.

Section 59 limits the application of section 23 of the Charter in Quebec. Paragraph 23(1)(a) of the Charter, which guarantees the minority language education rights of Canadian citizens &quot;whose first language learned and still understood is that of the English or French minority linguistic minority population of the province in which they reside&quot; will not be in force in Quebec until the Quebec government or legislature chooses to ratify it.

== Part II: Rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada ==
Section 35 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot; &quot;recognizes and affirms&quot; the &quot;existing&quot; aboriginal and treaty rights in Canada. These aboriginal rights protect the activities, practice, or traditions that are integral to the distinct cultures of the aboriginal peoples. The treaty rights protect and enforce agreements between the Crown and aboriginal peoples. Section 35 also provides protection of aboriginal title which protects the use of land for traditional practices.

Subsection 35(2) provides that aboriginal and treaty rights extend to Indian, Inuit, and Métis peoples and subsection 35(4), which was added in 1983, ensures that they &quot;are guaranteed equally to any male and female persons&quot;.

Subsection 35(3), which was also added in 1983, clarifies that &quot;treaty rights&quot; include &quot;rights that now exist by way of land claims agreements or may be so acquired&quot;. As a result, by entering into land claims agreements, the government of Canada and members of an aboriginal people can establish new treaty rights, which are constitutionally recognized and affirmed.

There are other sections of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot; that address aboriginal rights. Section 25 of the Charter provides that the guarantee of rights and freedoms in the Charter should not be understood to &quot;abrogate or derogate from any aboriginal, treaty or other rights or freedoms that pertain to the aboriginal peoples of Canada, including (a) any rights or freedoms that have been recognized by the Royal Proclamation of October 7, 1763; and (b) any rights or freedoms that now exist by way of land claims agreements or may be so acquired.&quot;

== Part III: Equalization and regional disparities==

Section 36 enshrines in the Constitution a value of equal opportunity for the Canadian people, economic development to support that equality, and government services available for public consumption. Subsection 2 goes further in recognizing a &quot;principle&quot; that the federal government should ensure equalization payments.

Writing in 1982, Professor Peter Hogg expressed scepticism as to whether the courts could interpret and enforce this provision, noting its &quot;political and moral, rather than legal&quot; character. Other scholars have noted section 36 is too vague.

Since the courts would not be of much use in interpreting the section, the section was nearly amended in 1992 with the Charlottetown Accord to make it enforceable. The Accord never came into effect.

== Parts IV and IV.1: Constitutional conferences ==

These two parts provided for constitutional conferences within certain time limits. Once the conferences were held, the two parts were repealed.

== Part V: Procedure for Amending Constitution of Canada ==
Subsection 52(3) of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot; requires constitutional amendments to be made in accordance with the rules set out in the Constitution itself. Subsection 52(3) entrenches constitutional supremacy and prevents Parliament and the provincial legislatures from making most constitutional amendments using simple legislation.

The rules for amending Canada&#x27;s constitution are quite dense. They are mostly laid out in Part V of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;.

There are five different amendment procedures, each applicable to different types of amendments. These five formulas are:
# The general procedure (the &quot;7/50&quot; procedure) – section 38. The amendment must be passed by the House of Commons, the Senate, and at least two-thirds of the provincial legislative assemblies representing at least 50% of the total population of the provinces. This is the default procedure and it covers any amendment procedure not covered more specifically in sections 41, 43, 44 or 45. The general formula must be used for any of the six situations identified in section 42.
# The unanimity Procedure – section 41. The amendment must be passed by the House of Commons, Senate, and &quot;all&quot; provincial legislative assemblies.
# The special arrangements procedure (the &quot;bilateral&quot; or &quot;some-but-not-all-provinces&quot; procedure) – section 43. The amendment must be passed by the House of Commons, the Senate, and the legislative assemblies of those provinces that are affected by the amendment.
# Federal Parliament Alone (&quot;federal unilateral&quot; procedure) – section 44. The amendment must only be passed by Parliament under its ordinary legislative procedure.
# Provincial Legislature Alone (&quot;provincial unilateral&quot; procedure) – section 45. The amendment must only be passed by the provincial legislature under its ordinary legislative procedure.

Neither aboriginal peoples&#x27; or the territories&#x27; agreement is required to make a constitutional amendment, even if it affects their interests. Section 35.1 commits the governments of Canada and the provinces &quot;to the principle that, before any amendment is made [to subsection 91(24) of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, section 25 of the Charter or sections 35 or 35.1 of the Constitution Act, 1982]&quot; that the Prime Minister will convene a conference of first ministers (i.e. provincial premiers) to discuss the amendment and invite &quot;representatives of the aboriginal peoples of Canada&quot; to discuss the amendment. Section 35.1 was added to Part II of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot; in 1983. Section 35.1 was invoked in the negotiations that led to the Charlottetown Accord, which would have greatly expanded aboriginal rights and recognized a right to self-government.

Various other sections of Part V lay out such things as compensation for opting out, when and how a province may opt out of a constitutional amendment, and time limits for achieving a constitutional amendment.

== Part VI: Amendment to the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; ==
The act also amended the division of powers by adding the natural resources amendment to the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;. The new provisions, section 92A and the Sixth Schedule, gave the provinces exclusive jurisdiction to regulate the development of non-renewable natural resources and electrical generation. These amendments were set out in sections 50 and 51 of the 1982 act.

== Part VII: General ==
=== Primacy of Constitution of Canada ===

Subsection 52(1) of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot; provides that the Constitution of Canada is the &quot;supreme law of Canada&quot;, and that &quot;any law inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution of Canada is, to the extent of the inconsistency, of no force or effect.&quot; A law that is inconsistent with the Constitution is theoretically of no force or effect from the moment it is made. In practical terms, however, such a law is not seen to be invalid until a court declares it to be inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution. The executive cannot enforce a law that a court has declared to be without force or effect. But only Parliament or a provincial legislature can repeal such a law.

Before the 1982 Act came into effect, the &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot; (now known as the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;) had been the supreme law of Canada. The supremacy of the 1867 Act had originally been established by virtue of s. 2 of the &quot;Colonial Laws Validity Act&quot;, a British Imperial statute declaring the invalidity of any colonial law that violated an Imperial statute extending to a colony. Since the &quot;British North America Act&quot; was an Imperial statute extending to Canada, any Canadian law violating the &quot;BNA Act&quot; was inoperative. Although there was no express provision giving the courts the power to decide that a Canadian law violated the &quot;BNA Act&quot; and was therefore inoperative, this power was implicit in s. 2 of the &quot;Colonial Laws Validity Act&quot;, which established the priority of statutes to be applied by the courts.

In 1931, the British Parliament enacted the &quot;Statute of Westminster, 1931&quot;. This Act provided that the &quot;Colonial Laws Validity Act&quot; no longer applied to the British Dominions, including Canada. However, it provided that Canada could not amend the &quot;British North America Act&quot;, which remained subject to amendment only by the British Parliament. This provision maintained the supremacy of the &quot;British North America Act&quot; in Canadian law until the enactment of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;.

=== Definition of the Constitution ===
Section 52(2) of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot; defines the &quot;Constitution of Canada.&quot; The Constitution of Canada is said to include:
::(a) the &quot;Canada Act 1982&quot; (which includes the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot; in Schedule B),
::(b) 30 Acts and Orders contained in the Schedule to the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot; (including, most significantly, the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;), and
::(c) any amendments which may have been made to any of the instruments in the first two categories.

Section 52(2), in addition to containing many Imperial Statutes, contains eight Canadian statutes, three of which created the provinces of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, and five of which were amendments to the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;.

The Canadian courts have reserved the right to add and entrench principles and conventions into the Constitution unilaterally. Although a court&#x27;s ability to recognize human rights not explicitly stated in a constitution is not particularly unusual, the Canadian situation is unique in that this ability extends to procedural issues not related to human rights.

In particular, in &quot;New Brunswick Broadcasting Co v Nova Scotia (Speaker of the House of Assembly)&quot;, the Supreme Court of Canada said that s. 52(2) was not an exhaustive listing of all that comprised the Constitution. The Court reserved the right to add unwritten principles to the Constitution, thereby entrenching them and granting them constitutional supremacy (in this case, they added parliamentary privilege to the Constitution). The Court did note, however, that the list of written documents was static and could not be modified except for through the amending formulas.

=== English and French versions ===
Section 56 of the Act provides that the parts of the Constitution that were enacted in English and French are equally authoritative, and section 57 adds that the English and French versions of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot; itself are equal. Section 57 is akin section 18 of the Charter, which provides that English and French versions of federal and New Brunswick statutes are equal. The Supreme Court has interpreted section 133 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; and section 23 of the &quot;Manitoba Act, 1870&quot; to mean that the English and French versions of federal, Quebec and Manitoba statutes are equal.

Despite sections 56 and 57, significant portions of the Constitution of Canada were only enacted in English and even if there exist unofficial French translations, their English versions alone have force of law. To address this problem, section 55 requires that the federal Minister of Justice prepare &quot;a French version of the…Constitution of Canada as expeditiously as possible.&quot; The Minister of Justice established a French Constitution Drafting Committee in 1984, which prepared French versions of the Constitution, and presented them to the Minister in 1990.

Section 55 also requires that &quot;when any portion thereof sufficient to warrant action being taken has been so prepared, it shall but put forward for enactment by proclamation issued by the Governor General under the Great Seal of Canada pursuant to the procedure then applicable to an amendment of the same provisions of the Constitution of Canada.&quot; No action has been taken to put forward the French version for enactment. The reference to a proclamation by the Governor-General implies that some combination of the general, unanimity and special arrangements procedures would be required to enact the French version. Although the intention was presumably that the government of Canada would do so by introducing an amendment resolution in the House of Commons, a Senator or a provincial government could presumably do so since, under section 46, such amendments &quot;may be initiated either by the Senate or the House of Commons or by the legislative assembly of a province&quot;.

== Australia and New Zealand ==

The patriation of the Canadian constitution set an example for similar actions by Australia and New Zealand. In 1985 and 1986, the Australian and British parliaments passed the Australia Act 1986. The Australian High Court subsequently recognized that the Act established Australia as an independent country, making Britain a foreign power. New Zealand experienced a constitutional crisis in 1984, which led to a desire for constitutional reform. The New Zealand Parliament patriated its own constitution in the Constitution Act 1986. Unlike Canada, New Zealand already had the right to amend its own constitution, so there was no corresponding British legislation.

<text>Oil sands are a type of unconventional petroleum deposit. They are either loose sands, or partially consolidated sandstone containing a naturally occurring mixture of sand, clay, and water, soaked with bitumen (a dense and extremely viscous form of petroleum).

Significant bitumen deposits are reported in Canada, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Venezuela. The estimated worldwide deposits of oil are more than . Proven reserves of bitumen contain approximately 100 billion barrels, and total natural bitumen reserves are estimated at worldwide, of which , or 70.8%, are in Alberta, Canada.

Crude bitumen is a thick, sticky form of crude oil, and is so viscous that it will not flow unless heated or diluted with lighter hydrocarbons such as light crude oil or natural-gas condensate. At room temperature, it is much like cold molasses. The Orinoco Belt in Venezuela is sometimes described as oil sands, but these deposits are non-bituminous, falling instead into the category of heavy or extra-heavy oil due to their lower viscosity. Natural bitumen and extra-heavy oil differ in the degree by which they have been degraded from the original conventional oils by bacteria.

The 1973 and 1979 oil price increases, and the development of improved extraction technology enabled profitable extraction and processing of the oil sands. Together with other so-called unconventional oil extraction practices, oil sands are implicated in the unburnable carbon debate but also contribute to energy security and counteract the international price cartel OPEC. According to the Oil Climate Index, carbon emissions from oil-sand crude are 31% higher than from conventional oil. In Canada, oil sands production in general, and in-situ extraction, in particular, are the largest contributors to the increase in the nation&#x27;s greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 to 2017, according to Natural Resources Canada (NRCan).

==History==
The use of bituminous deposits and seeps dates back to Paleolithic times. The earliest known use of bitumen was by Neanderthals, some 40,000 years ago. Bitumen has been found adhering to stone tools used by Neanderthals at sites in Syria. After the arrival of Homo sapiens, humans used bitumen for construction of buildings and waterproofing of reed boats, among other uses. In ancient Egypt, the use of bitumen was important in preparing mummies.

In ancient times, bitumen was primarily a Mesopotamian commodity used by the Sumerians and Babylonians, although it was also found in the Levant and Persia. The area along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers was littered with hundreds of pure bitumen seepages. The Mesopotamians used the bitumen for waterproofing boats and buildings. In Europe, they were extensively mined near the French city of Pechelbronn, where the vapour separation process was in use in 1742.

In Canada, the First Nation peoples had used bitumen from seeps along the Athabasca and Clearwater Rivers to waterproof their birch bark canoes from early prehistoric times. The Canadian oil sands first became known to Europeans in 1719 when a Cree person named Wa-Pa-Su brought a sample to Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company fur trader Henry Kelsey, who commented on it in his journals. Fur trader Peter Pond paddled down the Clearwater River to Athabasca in 1778, saw the deposits and wrote of &quot;springs of bitumen that flow along the ground&quot;. In 1787, fur trader and explorer Alexander MacKenzie on his way to the Arctic Ocean saw the Athabasca oil sands, and commented, &quot;At about 24 miles from the fork (of the Athabasca and Clearwater Rivers) are some bituminous fountains into which a pole of 20 feet long may be inserted without the least resistance.&quot;

==Cost of oil sands petroleum-mining operations==

In their May 2019 comparison of the &quot;cost of supply curve update&quot; in which the Norway-based Rystad Energy—an &quot;independent energy research and consultancy&quot;—ranked the &quot;worlds total recoverable liquid resources by their breakeven price&quot;, Rystad reported that the average breakeven price for oil from the oil sands was US$83 in 2019, making it the most expensive to produce, compared to all other &quot;significant oil producing regions&quot; in the world. The International Energy Agency made similar comparisons.

The price per barrel of heavier, sour crude oils lacking in tidewater access—such as Western Canadian Select (WCS) from the Athabaska oil sands, are priced at a differential to the lighter, sweeter oil—such as West Texas Intermediate (WTI). The price is based on its grade—determined by factors such as its specific gravity or API and its sulfur content—and its location—for example, its proximity to tidewater and/or refineries.

Because the cost of production is so much higher at oil sands petroleum-mining operations, the breakeven point is much higher than for sweeter lighter oils like that produced by Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, and, the United States. Oil sands productions expand and prosper as the global price of oil increased to peak highs because of the Arab oil embargo of 1973, the 1979 Iranian Revolution, the 1990 Persian Gulf crisis and war, the 11 September 2001 attacks, and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The boom periods were followed by the bust, as the global price of oil dropped during the 1980s and again in the 1990s, during a period of global recessions, and again in 2003.

==Nomenclature==
The name &quot;tar sands&quot; was applied to bituminous sands in the late 19th and early 20th century. People who saw the bituminous sands during this period were familiar with the large amounts of tar residue produced in urban areas as a by-product of the manufacture of coal gas for urban heating and lighting. The word &quot;tar&quot; to describe these natural bitumen deposits is really a misnomer, since, chemically speaking, tar is a human-made substance produced by the destructive distillation of organic material, usually coal.

Since then, coal gas has almost completely been replaced by natural gas as a fuel, and coal tar as a material for paving roads has been replaced by the petroleum product asphalt. Naturally occurring bitumen is chemically more similar to asphalt than to coal tar, and the term &quot;oil sands&quot; (or oilsands) is more commonly used by industry in the producing areas than &quot;tar sands&quot; because synthetic oil is manufactured from the bitumen, and due to the feeling that the terminology of &quot;tar sands&quot; is less politically acceptable to the public. Oil sands are now an alternative to conventional crude oil.

==Geology==
The world&#x27;s largest deposits of oil sands are in Venezuela and Canada. The geology of the deposits in the two countries is generally rather similar. They are vast heavy oil, extra-heavy oil, and/or bitumen deposits with oil heavier than 20°API, found largely in unconsolidated sandstones with similar properties. &quot;Unconsolidated&quot; in this context means that the sands have high porosity, no significant cohesion, and a tensile strength close to zero. The sands are saturated with oil which has prevented them from consolidating into hard sandstone.

===Size of resources===
The magnitude of the resources in the two countries is on the order of 3.5 to 4 trillion barrels (550 to 650 billion cubic metres) of original oil in place (OOIP). Oil in place is not necessarily oil reserves, and the amount that can be produced depends on technological evolution. Rapid technological developments in Canada in the 1985–2000 period resulted in techniques such as steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) that can recover a much greater percentage of the OOIP than conventional methods. The Alberta government estimates that with current technology, 10% of its bitumen and heavy oil can be recovered, which would give it about 200 billion barrels (32 billion m3) of recoverable oil reserves. Venezuela estimates its recoverable oil at 267 billion barrels (42 billion m3). This places Canada and Venezuela in the same league as Saudi Arabia, having the three largest oil reserves in the world.

=== Major deposits ===
There are numerous deposits of oil sands in the world, but the biggest and most important are in Canada and Venezuela, with lesser deposits in Kazakhstan and Russia. The total volume of non-conventional oil in the oil sands of these countries exceeds the reserves of conventional oil in all other countries combined. Vast deposits of bitumenover 350 billion cubic metres (2.2 trillion barrels) of oil in placeexist in the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. If 30% of this oil could be extracted, it could supply the entire needs of North America for over 100 years at 2002 consumption levels. These deposits represent plentiful oil, but not cheap oil. They require advanced technology to extract the oil and transport it to oil refineries.

====Canada====
The oil sands of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) are a result of the formation of the Canadian Rocky Mountains by the Pacific Plate overthrusting the North American Plate as it pushed in from the west, carrying the formerly large island chains which now compose most of British Columbia. The collision compressed the Alberta plains and raised the Rockies above the plains, forming mountain ranges. This mountain building process buried the sedimentary rock layers which underlie most of Alberta to a great depth, creating high subsurface temperatures, and producing a giant pressure cooker effect that converted the kerogen in the deeply buried organic-rich shales to light oil and natural gas. These source rocks were similar to the American so-called oil shales, except the latter have never been buried deep enough to convert the kerogen in them into liquid oil.

This overthrusting also tilted the pre-Cretaceous sedimentary rock formations underlying most of the sub-surface of Alberta, depressing the rock formations in southwest Alberta up to deep near the Rockies, but to zero depth in the northeast, where they pinched out against the igneous rocks of the Canadian Shield, which outcrop on the surface. This tilting is not apparent on the surface because the resulting trench has been filled in by eroded material from the mountains. The light oil migrated up-dip through hydro-dynamic transport from the Rockies in the southwest toward the Canadian Shield in the northeast following a complex pre-Cretaceous unconformity that exists in the formations under Alberta. The total distance of oil migration southwest to northeast was about . At the shallow depths of sedimentary formations in the northeast, massive microbial biodegradation as the oil approached the surface caused the oil to become highly viscous and immobile. Almost all of the remaining oil is found in the far north of Alberta, in Middle Cretaceous (115 million-year old) sand-silt-shale deposits overlain by thick shales, although large amounts of heavy oil lighter than bitumen are found in the Heavy Oil Belt along the Alberta-Saskatchewan border, extending into Saskatchewan and approaching the Montana border. Note that, although adjacent to Alberta, Saskatchewan has no massive deposits of bitumen, only large reservoirs of heavy oil &gt;10°API.

Most of the Canadian oil sands are in three major deposits in northern Alberta. They are the Athabasca-Wabiskaw oil sands of north northeastern Alberta, the Cold Lake deposits of east northeastern Alberta, and the Peace River deposits of northwestern Alberta. Between them, they cover over —an area larger than England—and contain approximately of crude bitumen in them. About 10% of the oil in place, or , is estimated by the government of Alberta to be recoverable at current prices, using current technology, which amounts to 97% of Canadian oil reserves and 75% of total North American petroleum reserves. Although the Athabasca deposit is the only one in the world which has areas shallow enough to mine from the surface, all three Alberta areas are suitable for production using &quot;in-situ&quot; methods, such as cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) and steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD).

The largest Canadian oil sands deposit, the Athabasca oil sands is in the McMurray Formation, centered on the city of Fort McMurray, Alberta. It outcrops on the surface (zero burial depth) about north of Fort McMurray, where enormous oil sands mines have been established, but is deep southeast of Fort McMurray. Only 3% of the oil sands area containing about 20% of the recoverable oil can be produced by surface mining, so the remaining 80% will have to be produced using in-situ wells. The other Canadian deposits are between deep and will require in-situ production.

=====Athabasca=====


=====Cold Lake=====


The Cold Lake oil sands are northeast of Alberta&#x27;s capital, Edmonton, near the border with Saskatchewan. A small portion of the Cold Lake deposit lies in Saskatchewan. Although smaller than the Athabasca oil sands, the Cold Lake oil sands are important because some of the oil is fluid enough to be extracted by conventional methods. The Cold Lake bitumen contains more alkanes and less asphaltenes than the other major Alberta oil sands and the oil is more fluid. As a result, cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) is commonly used for production.

The Cold Lake oil sands are of a roughly circular shape, centered around Bonnyville, Alberta. They probably contain over 60 billion cubic metres (370 billion barrels) of extra-heavy oil-in-place. The oil is highly viscous, but considerably less so than the Athabasca oil sands, and is somewhat less sulfurous. The depth of the deposits is and they are from thick. They are too deep to surface mine.

Much of the oil sands are on Canadian Forces Base Cold Lake. CFB Cold Lake&#x27;s CF-18 Hornet jet fighters defend the western half of Canadian air space and cover Canada&#x27;s Arctic territory. Cold Lake Air Weapons Range (CLAWR) is one of the largest live-drop bombing ranges in the world, including testing of cruise missiles. As oil sands production continues to grow, various sectors vie for access to airspace, land, and resources, and this complicates oil well drilling and production significantly.

=====Peace River=====
====Venezuela====
The Eastern Venezuelan Basin has a structure similar to the WCSB, but on a shorter scale. The distance the oil has migrated up-dip from the Sierra Oriental mountain front to the Orinoco oil sands where it pinches out against the igneous rocks of the Guyana Shield is only about . The hydrodynamic conditions of oil transport were similar, source rocks buried deep by the rise of the mountains of the Sierra Orientale produced light oil that moved up-dip toward the south until it was gradually immobilized by the viscosity increase caused by biodgradation near the surface. The Orinoco deposits are early Tertiary (50 to 60 million years old) sand-silt-shale sequences overlain by continuous thick shales, much like the Canadian deposits.

In Venezuela, the Orinoco Belt oil sands range from deep and no surface outcrops exist. The deposit is about long east-to-west and wide north-to-south, much less than the combined area covered by the Canadian deposits. In general, the Canadian deposits are found over a much wider area, have a broader range of properties, and have a broader range of reservoir types than the Venezuelan ones, but the geological structures and mechanisms involved are similar. The main differences is that the oil in the sands in Venezuela is less viscous than in Canada, allowing some of it to be produced by conventional drilling techniques, but none of it approaches the surface as in Canada, meaning none of it can be produced using surface mining. The Canadian deposits will almost all have to be produced by mining or using new non-conventional techniques.

=====Orinoco=====

The Orinoco Belt is a territory in the southern strip of the eastern Orinoco River Basin in Venezuela which overlies one of the world&#x27;s largest deposits of petroleum. The Orinoco Belt follows the line of the river. It is approximately from east to west, and from north to south, with an area about .

The oil sands consist of large deposits of extra heavy crude. Venezuela&#x27;s heavy oil deposits of about of oil in place are estimated to approximately equal the world&#x27;s reserves of lighter oil.

In 2009, the US Geological Survey (USGS) increased its estimates of the reserves to of oil which is &quot;technically recoverable (producible using currently available technology and industry practices).&quot; No estimate of how much of the oil is economically recoverable was made.

===Other deposits===
In addition to the three major Canadian oil sands in Alberta, there is a fourth major oil sands deposit in Canada, the Melville Island oil sands in the Canadian Arctic islands, which are too remote to expect commercial production in the foreseeable future.

Apart from the megagiant oil sands deposits in Canada and Venezuela, numerous other countries hold smaller oil sands deposits. In the United States, there are supergiant oil sands resources primarily concentrated in Eastern Utah, with a total of of oil (known and potential) in eight major deposits in Carbon, Garfield, Grand, Uintah, and Wayne counties. In addition to being much smaller than the Canadian oil sands deposits, the US oil sands are hydrocarbon-wet, whereas the Canadian oil sands are water-wet. This requires somewhat different extraction techniques for the Utah oil sands from those used for the Alberta oil sands.

Russia holds oil sands in two main regions. Large resources are present in the Tunguska Basin, East Siberia, with the largest deposits being Olenyok and Siligir. Other deposits are located in the Timan-Pechora and Volga-Urals basins (in and around Tatarstan), which is an important but very mature province in terms of conventional oil, holds large amounts of oil sands in a shallow Permian formation. In Kazakhstan, large bitumen deposits are located in the North Caspian Basin.

In Madagascar, Tsimiroro and Bemolanga are two heavy oil sands deposits, with a pilot well already producing small amounts of oil in Tsimiroro. and larger scale exploitation in the early planning phase. In the Republic of the Congo reserves are estimated between .

==Production==
Bituminous sands are a major source of unconventional oil, although only Canada has a large-scale commercial oil sands industry. In 2006, bitumen production in Canada averaged through 81 oil sands projects. 44% of Canadian oil production in 2007 was from oil sands. This proportion was (as of 2008) expected to increase in coming decades as bitumen production grows while conventional oil production declines, although due to the 2008 economic downturn work on new projects has been deferred. Petroleum is not produced from oil sands on a significant level in other countries.

===Canada===

The Alberta oil sands have been in commercial production since the original Great Canadian Oil Sands (now Suncor Energy) mine began operation in 1967. Syncrude&#x27;s second mine began operation in 1978 and is the biggest mine of any type in the world. The third mine in the Athabasca Oil Sands, the Albian Sands consortium of Shell Canada, Chevron Corporation, and Western Oil Sands Inc. (purchased by Marathon Oil Corporation in 2007) began operation in 2003. Petro-Canada was also developing a $33 billion Fort Hills Project, in partnership with UTS Energy Corporation and Teck Cominco, which lost momentum after the 2009 merger of Petro-Canada into Suncor.

By 2013 there were nine oil sands mining projects in the Athabasca oil sands deposit: Suncor Energy Inc. (Suncor), Syncrude Canada Limited (Syncrude)&#x27;s Mildred Lake and Aurora North, Shell Canada Limited (Shell)&#x27;s Muskeg River and Jackpine, Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNRL)&#x27;s Horizon, Imperial Oil Resources Ventures Limited (Imperial), Kearl Oil Sands Project (KOSP), Total E&amp;P Canada Ltd. Joslyn North Mine and Fort Hills Energy Corporation (FHEC). In 2011 alone they produced over 52 million cubic metres of bitumen.

Canadian oil sand extraction has created extensive environmental damage, and many first nations peoples, scientists, lawyers, journalists and environmental groups have described Canadian oil sands mining as an ecocide.

From the beginning of 2022 oil sands extraction in Alberta has sharply increased, overpassing by far the level of 2014. High oil prices is one of the causes. In 2024 it is projected to increase more, so Canada can become a leader in oil production.

===Venezuela===

No significant development of Venezuela&#x27;s extra-heavy oil deposits was undertaken before 2000, except for the BITOR operation which produced somewhat less than 100,000 barrels of oil per day (16,000 m3/d) of 9°API oil by primary production. This was mostly shipped as an emulsion (Orimulsion) of 70% oil and 30% water with similar characteristics as heavy fuel oil for burning in thermal power plants. However, when a major strike hit the Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA, most of the engineers were fired as punishment. Orimulsion had been the pride of the PDVSA engineers, so Orimulsion fell out of favor with the key political leaders. As a result, the government has been trying to &quot;Wind Down&quot; the Orimulsion program.

Despite the fact that the Orinoco oil sands contain extra-heavy oil which is easier to produce than Canada&#x27;s similarly sized reserves of bitumen, Venezuela&#x27;s oil production has been declining in recent years because of the country&#x27;s political and economic problems, while Canada&#x27;s has been increasing. As a result, Canadian heavy oil and bitumen exports have been backing Venezuelan heavy and extra-heavy oil out of the US market, and Canada&#x27;s total exports of oil to the US have become several times as great as Venezuela&#x27;s.

By 2016, with the economy of Venezuela in a tailspin and the country experiencing widespread shortages of food, rolling power blackouts, rioting, and anti-government protests, it was unclear how much new oil sands production would occur in the near future.

=== Other countries ===
In May 2008, the Italian oil company Eni announced a project to develop a small oil sands deposit in the Republic of the Congo. Production is scheduled to commence in 2014 and is estimated to eventually yield a total of .

==Methods of extraction==

Except for a fraction of the extra-heavy oil or bitumen which can be extracted by conventional oil well technology, oil sands must be produced by strip mining or the oil made to flow into wells using sophisticated &quot;in-situ&quot; techniques. These methods usually use more water and require larger amounts of energy than conventional oil extraction. While much of Canada&#x27;s oil sands are being produced using open-pit mining, approximately 90% of Canadian oil sands and all of Venezuela&#x27;s oil sands are too far below the surface to use surface mining.

===Primary production===
Conventional crude oil is normally extracted from the ground by drilling oil wells into a petroleum reservoir, allowing oil to flow into them under natural reservoir pressures, although artificial lift and techniques such as horizontal drilling, water flooding and gas injection are often required to maintain production. When primary production is used in the Venezuelan oil sands, where the extra-heavy oil is about 50 degrees Celsius, the typical oil recovery rates are about 8–12%. Canadian oil sands are much colder and more biodegraded, so bitumen recovery rates are usually only about 5–6%. Historically, primary recovery was used in the more fluid areas of Canadian oil sands. However, it recovered only a small fraction of the oil in place, so it is not often used today.

===Surface mining===

The Athabasca oil sands are the only major oil sands deposits which are shallow enough to surface mine. In the Athabasca sands there are very large amounts of bitumen covered by little overburden, making surface mining the most efficient method of extracting it. The overburden consists of water-laden muskeg (peat bog) overtop of clay and barren sand. The oil sands themselves are typically thick deposits of crude bitumen embedded in unconsolidated sandstone, sitting on top of flat limestone rock. Since Great Canadian Oil Sands (now Suncor Energy) started operation of the first large-scale oil sands mine in 1967, bitumen has been extracted on a commercial scale and the volume has grown at a steady rate ever since.

A large number of oil sands mines are currently in operation and more are in the stages of approval or development. The Syncrude Canada mine was the second to open in 1978, Shell Canada opened its Muskeg River mine (Albian Sands) in 2003 and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd (CNRL) opened its Horizon Oil Sands project in 2009. Newer mines include Shell Canada&#x27;s Jackpine mine, Imperial Oil&#x27;s Kearl Oil Sands Project, the Synenco Energy (now owned by TotalEnergies) Northern Lights mine, and Suncor&#x27;s Fort Hills mine.

====Oil sands tailings ponds ====

Oil sands tailings ponds are engineered dam and dyke systems that contain salts, suspended solids and other dissolvable chemical compounds such as naphthenic acids, benzene, hydrocarbons residual bitumen, fine silts (mature fine tails MFT), and water. Large volumes of tailings are a byproduct of surface mining of the oil sands and managing these tailings are one of the most damaging aspects of tar sands. The Government of Alberta reported in 2013 that tailings ponds in the Alberta oil sands covered an area of about . The Syncrude Tailings Dam or Mildred Lake Settling Basin (MLSB) is an embankment dam that is, by volume of construction material, the largest earth structure in the world in 2001.

===Cold Heavy Oil Production with Sand (CHOPS)===
Some years ago Canadian oil companies discovered that if they removed the sand filters from heavy oil wells and produced as much sand as possible with the oil, production rates improved significantly. This technique became known as Cold Heavy Oil Production with Sand (CHOPS). Further research disclosed that pumping out sand opened &quot;wormholes&quot; in the sand formation which allowed more oil to reach the wellbore. The advantage of this method is better production rates and recovery (around 10% versus 5–6% with sand filters in place) and the disadvantage that disposing of the produced sand is a problem. A novel way to do this was spreading it on rural roads, which rural governments liked because the oily sand reduced dust and the oil companies did their road maintenance for them. However, governments have become concerned about the large volume and composition of oil spread on roads. so in recent years disposing of oily sand in underground salt caverns has become more common.

===Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS)===
The use of steam injection to recover heavy oil has been in use in the oil fields of California since the 1950s. The cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) &quot;huff-and-puff&quot; method is now widely used in heavy oil production worldwide due to its quick early production rates; however recovery factors are relatively low (10–40% of oil in place) compared to SAGD (60–70% of OIP).

CSS has been in use by Imperial Oil at Cold Lake since 1985 and is also used by Canadian Natural Resources at Primrose and Wolf Lake and by Shell Canada at Peace River. In this method, the well is put through cycles of steam injection, soak, and oil production. First, steam is injected into a well at a temperature of 300 to 340 degrees Celsius for a period of weeks to months; then, the well is allowed to sit for days to weeks to allow heat to soak into the formation; and, later, the hot oil is pumped out of the well for a period of weeks or months. Once the production rate falls off, the well is put through another cycle of injection, soak and production. This process is repeated until the cost of injecting steam becomes higher than the money made from producing oil.

===Steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD)===
Steam-assisted gravity drainage was developed in the 1980s by the Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research Authority and fortuitously coincided with improvements in directional drilling technology that made it quick and inexpensive to do by the mid 1990s. In SAGD, two horizontal wells are drilled in the oil sands, one at the bottom of the formation and another about 5 metres above it. These wells are typically drilled in groups off central pads and can extend for miles in all directions. In each well pair, steam is injected into the upper well, the heat melts the bitumen, which allows it to flow into the lower well, where it is pumped to the surface.

SAGD has proved to be a major breakthrough in production technology since it is cheaper than CSS, allows very high oil production rates, and recovers up to 60% of the oil in place. Because of its economic feasibility and applicability to a vast area of oil sands, this method alone quadrupled North American oil reserves and allowed Canada to move to second place in world oil reserves after Saudi Arabia. Most major Canadian oil companies now have SAGD projects in production or under construction in Alberta&#x27;s oil sands areas and in Wyoming. Examples include Japan Canada Oil Sands Ltd&#x27;s (JACOS) project, Suncor&#x27;s Firebag project, Nexen&#x27;s Long Lake project, Suncor&#x27;s (formerly Petro-Canada&#x27;s) MacKay River project, Husky Energy&#x27;s Tucker Lake and Sunrise projects, Shell Canada&#x27;s Peace River project, Cenovus Energy&#x27;s Foster Creek and Christina Lake developments, ConocoPhillips&#x27; Surmont project, Devon Canada&#x27;s Jackfish project, and Derek Oil &amp; Gas&#x27;s LAK Ranch project. Alberta&#x27;s OSUM Corp has combined proven underground mining technology with SAGD to enable higher recovery rates by running wells underground from within the oil sands deposit, thus also reducing energy requirements compared to traditional SAGD. This particular technology application is in its testing phase.

===Vapor Extraction (VAPEX)===
Several methods use solvents, instead of steam, to separate bitumen from sand. Some solvent extraction methods may work better in &quot;in situ&quot; production and other in mining. Solvent can be beneficial if it produces more oil while requiring less energy to produce steam.

Vapor Extraction Process (VAPEX) is an &quot;in situ&quot; technology, similar to SAGD. Instead of steam, hydrocarbon solvents are injected into an upper well to dilute bitumen and enables the diluted bitumen to flow into a lower well. It has the advantage of much better energy efficiency over steam injection, and it does some partial upgrading of bitumen to oil right in the formation. The process has attracted attention from oil companies, who are experimenting with it.

The above methods are not mutually exclusive. It is becoming common for wells to be put through one CSS injection-soak-production cycle to condition the formation prior to going to SAGD production, and companies are experimenting with combining VAPEX with SAGD to improve recovery rates and lower energy costs.

=== Toe to Heel Air Injection (THAI) ===
This is a very new and experimental method that combines a vertical air injection well with a horizontal production well. The process ignites oil in the reservoir and creates a vertical wall of fire moving from the &quot;toe&quot; of the horizontal well toward the &quot;heel&quot;, which burns the heavier oil components and upgrades some of the heavy bitumen into lighter oil right in the formation. Historically fireflood projects have not worked out well because of difficulty in controlling the flame front and a propensity to set the producing wells on fire. However, some oil companies feel the THAI method will be more controllable and practical, and have the advantage of not requiring energy to create steam.

Advocates of this method of extraction state that it uses less freshwater, produces 50% less greenhouse gases, and has a smaller footprint than other production techniques.

Petrobank Energy and Resources has reported encouraging results from their test wells in Alberta, with production rates of up to per well, and the oil upgraded from 8 to 12 API degrees.
The company hopes to get a further 7-degree upgrade from its CAPRI (controlled atmospheric pressure resin infusion) system, which pulls the oil through a catalyst lining the lower pipe.

After several years of production in situ, it has become clear that current THAI methods do not work as planned. Amid steady drops in production from their THAI wells at Kerrobert, Petrobank has written down the value of their THAI patents and the reserves at the facility to zero. They have plans to experiment with a new configuration they call &quot;multi-THAI,&quot; involving adding more air injection wells.

===Combustion Overhead Gravity Drainage (COGD)===
This is an experimental method that employs a number of vertical air injection wells above a horizontal production well located at the base of the bitumen pay zone. An initial Steam Cycle similar to CSS is used to prepare the bitumen for ignition and mobility. Following that cycle, air is injected into the vertical wells, igniting the upper bitumen and mobilizing (through heating) the lower bitumen to flow into the production well. It is expected that COGD will result in water savings of 80% compared to SAGD.

===Froth treatment===
== Energy balance ==
Approximately of energy is needed to extract a barrel of bitumen and upgrade it to synthetic crude. As of 2006, most of this is produced by burning natural gas. Since a barrel of oil equivalent is about , its EROEI is 5–6. That means this extracts about 5 or 6 times as much energy as is consumed. Energy efficiency is expected to improve to an average of of natural gas or of energy per barrel by 2015, giving an EROEI of about 6.5.

Alternatives to natural gas exist and are available in the oil sands area. Bitumen can itself be used as the fuel, consuming about 30–35% of the raw bitumen per produced unit of synthetic crude. Nexen&#x27;s Long Lake project will use a proprietary deasphalting technology to upgrade the bitumen, using asphaltene residue fed to a gasifier whose syngas will be used by a cogeneration turbine and a hydrogen producing unit, providing all the energy needs of the project: steam, hydrogen, and electricity. Thus, it will produce syncrude without consuming natural gas, but the capital cost is very high.

Shortages of natural gas for project fuel were forecast to be a problem for Canadian oil sands production a few years ago, but recent increases in US shale gas production have eliminated much of the problem for North America. With the increasing use of hydraulic fracturing making US largely self-sufficient in natural gas and exporting more natural gas to Eastern Canada to replace Alberta gas, the Alberta government is using its powers under the NAFTA and the Canadian Constitution to reduce shipments of natural gas to the US and Eastern Canada, and divert the gas to domestic Alberta use, particularly for oil sands fuel. The natural gas pipelines to the east and south are being converted to carry increasing oil sands production to these destinations instead of gas. Canada also has huge undeveloped shale gas deposits in addition to those of the US, so natural gas for future oil sands production does not seem to be a serious problem. The low price of natural gas as the result of new production has considerably improved the economics of oil sands production.

==Upgrading and blending==

The extra-heavy crude oil or crude bitumen extracted from oil sands is a very viscous semisolid form of oil that does not easily flow at normal temperatures, making it difficult to transport to market by pipeline. To flow through oil pipelines, it must either be upgraded to lighter synthetic crude oil (SCO), blended with diluents to form dilbit, or heated to reduce its viscosity.

===Canada===
In the Canadian oil sands, bitumen produced by surface mining is generally upgraded on-site and delivered as synthetic crude oil. This makes delivery of oil to market through conventional oil pipelines quite easy. On the other hand, bitumen produced by the in-situ projects is generally not upgraded but delivered to market in raw form. If the agent used to upgrade the bitumen to synthetic crude is not produced on site, it must be sourced elsewhere and transported to the site of upgrading. If the upgraded crude is being transported from the site by pipeline, and additional pipeline will be required to bring in sufficient upgrading agent. The costs of production of the upgrading agent, the pipeline to transport it and the cost to operate the pipeline must be calculated into the production cost of the synthetic crude.

Upon reaching a refinery, the synthetic crude is processed and a significant portion of the upgrading agent will be removed during the refining process. It may be used for other fuel fractions, but the end result is that liquid fuel has to be piped to the upgrading facility simply to make the bitumen transportable by pipeline. If all costs are considered, synthetic crude production and transfer using bitumen and an upgrading agent may prove economically unsustainable.

When the first oil sands plants were built over 50 years ago, most oil refineries in their market area were designed to handle light or medium crude oil with lower sulfur content than the 4–7% that is typically found in bitumen. The original oil sands upgraders were designed to produce a high-quality synthetic crude oil (SCO) with lower density and lower sulfur content. These are large, expensive plants which are much like heavy oil refineries. Research is currently being done on designing simpler upgraders which do not produce SCO but simply treat the bitumen to reduce its viscosity, allowing to be transported unblended like conventional heavy oil.

Western Canadian Select, launched in 2004 as a new heavy oil stream, blended at the Husky Energy terminal in Hardisty, Alberta,
is the largest crude oil stream coming from the Canadian oil sands and the benchmark for emerging heavy, high TAN (acidic) crudes.&lt;ref name=&quot;TMX/Shorcan Energy Brokers&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
Western Canadian Select (WCS) is traded at Cushing, Oklahoma, a major oil supply hub connecting oil suppliers to the Gulf Coast, which has become the most significant trading hub for crude oil in North America. While its major component is bitumen, it also contains a combination of sweet synthetic and condensate diluents, and 25 existing streams of both conventional and unconventional oil making it a syndilbit—both a dilbit and a synbit.

The first step in upgrading is vacuum distillation to separate the lighter fractions. After that, de-asphalting is used to separate the asphalt from the feedstock. Cracking is used to break the heavier hydrocarbon molecules down into simpler ones. Since cracking produces products which are rich in sulfur, desulfurization must be done to get the sulfur content below 0.5% and create sweet, light synthetic crude oil.

In 2012, Alberta produced about of crude bitumen from its three major oil sands deposits, of which about was upgraded to lighter products and the rest sold as raw bitumen. The volume of both upgraded and non-upgraded bitumen is increasing yearly. Alberta has five oil sands upgraders producing a variety of products. These include:
* Suncor Energy can upgrade of bitumen to light sweet and medium sour synthetic crude oil (SCO), plus produce diesel fuel for its oil sands operations at the upgrader.
* Syncrude can upgrade of bitumen to sweet light SCO.
* Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNRL) can upgrade of bitumen to sweet light SCO.
* Nexen, since 2013 wholly owned by China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), can upgrade of bitumen to sweet light SCO.
* Shell Canada operates its Scotford Upgrader in combination with an oil refinery and chemical plant at Scotford, Alberta, near Edmonton. The complex can upgrade of bitumen to sweet and heavy SCO as well as a range of refinery and chemical products.

Modernized and new large refineries such as are found in the Midwestern United States and on the Gulf Coast of the United States, as well as many in China, can handle upgrading heavy oil themselves, so their demand is for non-upgraded bitumen and extra-heavy oil rather than SCO. The main problem is that the feedstock would be too viscous to flow through pipelines, so unless it is delivered by tanker or rail car, it must be blended with diluent to enable it to flow. This requires mixing the crude bitumen with a lighter hydrocarbon diluent such as condensate from gas wells, pentanes and other light products from oil refineries or gas plants, or synthetic crude oil from oil sands upgraders to allow it to flow through pipelines to market.

Typically, blended bitumen contains about 30% natural gas condensate or other diluents and 70% bitumen. Alternatively, bitumen can also be delivered to market by specially designed railway tank cars, tank trucks, liquid cargo barges, or ocean-going oil tankers. These do not necessarily require the bitumen be blended with diluent since the tanks can be heated to allow the oil to be pumped out.

The demand for condensate for oil sands diluent is expected to be more than by 2020, double 2012 volumes. Since Western Canada only produces about of condensate, the supply was expected to become a major constraint on bitumen transport. However, the recent huge increase in US tight oil production has largely solved this problem, because much of the production is too light for US refinery use but ideal for diluting bitumen. The surplus American condensate and light oil is being exported to Canada and blended with bitumen, and then re-imported to the US as feedstock for refineries. Since the diluent is simply exported and then immediately re-imported, it is not subject to the US ban on exports of crude oil. Once it is back in the US, refineries separate the diluent and re-export it to Canada, which again bypasses US crude oil export laws since it is now a refinery product. To aid in this process, Kinder Morgan Energy Partners is reversing its Cochin Pipeline, which used to carry propane from Edmonton to Chicago, to transport of condensate from Chicago to Edmonton by mid-2014; and Enbridge is considering the expansion of its Southern Lights pipeline, which currently ships of diluent from the Chicago area to Edmonton, by adding another .

===Venezuela===
Although Venezuelan extra-heavy oil is less viscous than Canadian bitumen, much of the difference is due to temperature. Once the oil comes out of the ground and cools, it has the same difficulty in that it is too viscous to flow through pipelines. Venezuela is now producing more extra heavy crude in the Orinoco oil sands than its four upgraders, which were built by foreign oil companies over a decade ago, can handle. The upgraders have a combined capacity of , which is only half of its production of extra-heavy oil. In addition Venezuela produces insufficient volumes of naphtha to use as diluent to move extra-heavy oil to market. Unlike Canada, Venezuela does not produce much natural gas condensate from its own gas wells, nor does it have easy access to condensate from new US shale gas production. Since Venezuela also has insufficient refinery capacity to supply its domestic market, supplies of naptha are insufficient to use as pipeline diluent, and it is having to import naptha to fill the gap. Since Venezuela also has financial problems—as a result of the country&#x27;s economic crisis—and political disagreements with the US government and oil companies, the situation remains unresolved.

==Refining==
Heavy crude feedstock needs pre-processing before it is fit for conventional refineries, although heavy oil and bitumen refineries can do the pre-processing themselves. This pre-processing is called &quot;upgrading&quot;, the key components of which are as follows:
# removal of water, sand, physical waste, and lighter products
# catalytic purification by hydrodemetallisation (HDM), hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and hydrodenitrogenation (HDN)
# hydrogenation through carbon rejection or catalytic hydrocracking (HCR)

As carbon rejection is very inefficient and wasteful in most cases, catalytic hydrocracking is preferred in most cases. All these processes take large amounts of energy and water, while emitting more carbon dioxide than conventional oil.

Catalytic purification and hydrocracking are together known as hydroprocessing. The big challenge in hydroprocessing is to deal with the impurities found in heavy crude, as they poison the catalysts over time. Many efforts have been made to deal with this to ensure high activity and long life of a catalyst. Catalyst materials and pore size distributions are key parameters that need to be optimized to deal with this challenge and varies from place to place, depending on the kind of feedstock present.

===Canada===

There are four major oil refineries in Alberta which supply most of Western Canada with petroleum products, but as of 2012 these processed less than 1/4 of the approximately of bitumen and SCO produced in Alberta. Some of the large oil sands upgraders also produced diesel fuel as part of their operations. Some of the oil sands bitumen and SCO went to refineries in other provinces, but most of it was exported to the United States. The four major Alberta refineries are:
* Suncor Energy operates the Petro-Canada refinery near Edmonton, which can process of all types of oil and bitumen into all types of products.
* Imperial Oil operates the Strathcona Refinery near Edmonton, which can process of SCO and conventional oil into all types of products.
* Shell Canada operates the Scotford Refinery near Edmonton, which is integrated with the Scotford Upgrader, and which can process of all types of oil and bitumen into all types of products.
* Husky Energy, operates the Husky Lloydminster Refinery in Lloydminster, which can process of feedstock from the adjacent Husky Upgrader into bitumen and other products.

The $8.5 billion Sturgeon Refinery, a fifth major Alberta refinery, is under construction near Fort Saskatchewan with a completion date of 2017.

The Pacific Future Energy project proposed a new refinery in British Columbia that would process bitumen into fuel for Asian and Canadian markets. Pacific Future Energy proposes to transport near-solid bitumen to the refinery using railway tank cars.

Most of the Canadian oil refining industry is foreign-owned. Canadian refineries can process only about 25% of the oil produced in Canada. Canadian refineries, outside of Alberta and Saskatchewan, were originally built for light and medium crude oil. With new oil sands production coming on production at lower prices than international oil, market price imbalances have ruined the economics of refineries which could not process it.

===United States===

Prior to 2013, when China surpassed it, the United States was the largest oil importer in the world. Unlike Canada, the US has hundreds of oil refineries, many of which have been modified to process heavy oil as US production of light and medium oil declined. The main market for Canadian bitumen as well as Venezuelan extra-heavy oil was assumed to be the US. The United States has historically been Canada&#x27;s largest customer for crude oil and products, particularly in recent years. American imports of oil and products from Canada grew from in 1981 to in 2013 as Canada&#x27;s oil sands produced more and more oil, while in the US, domestic production and imports from other countries declined. However, this relationship is becoming strained due to physical, economic and political influences. Export pipeline capacity is approaching its limits; Canadian oil is selling at a discount to world market prices; US demand for crude oil and product imports has declined because of US economic problems; and US oil domestic unconventional oil production (shale oil production from fracking is growing rapidly.) The US resumed export of crude oil in 2016; as of early 2019, the US produced as much oil as it consumed, with shale oil displacing Canadian imports.

For the benefit of oil marketers, in 2004 Western Canadian producers created a new benchmark crude oil called Western Canadian Select, (WCS), a bitumen-derived heavy crude oil blend that is similar in its transportation and refining characteristics to California, Mexico Maya, or Venezuela heavy crude oils. This heavy oil has an API gravity of 19–21 and despite containing large amounts of bitumen and synthetic crude oil, flows through pipelines well and is classified as &quot;conventional heavy oil&quot; by governments. There are several hundred thousand barrels per day of this blend being imported into the US, in addition to larger amounts of crude bitumen and synthetic crude oil (SCO) from the oil sands.

The demand from US refineries is increasingly for non-upgraded bitumen rather than SCO. The Canadian National Energy Board (NEB) expects SCO volumes to double to around by 2035, but not keep pace with the total increase in bitumen production. It projects that the portion of oil sands production that is upgraded to SCO to decline from 49% in 2010 to 37% in 2035. This implies that over of bitumen will have to be blended with diluent for delivery to market.

===Asia===

Demand for oil in Asia has been growing much faster than in North America or Europe. In 2013, China replaced the United States as the world&#x27;s largest importer of crude oil, and its demand continues to grow much faster than its production. The main impediment to Canadian exports to Asia is pipeline capacity – The only pipeline capable of delivering oil sands production to Canada&#x27;s Pacific Coast is the Trans Mountain Pipeline from Edmonton to Vancouver, which is now operating at its capacity of supplying refineries in B.C. and Washington State. However, once complete, the Northern Gateway pipeline and the Trans Mountain expansion currently undergoing government review are expected to deliver an additional to to tankers on the Pacific coast, from where they could deliver it anywhere in the world. There is sufficient heavy oil refinery capacity in China and India to refine the additional Canadian volume, possibly with some modifications to the refineries. In recent years, Chinese oil companies such as China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec), China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), and PetroChina have bought over $30 billion in assets in Canadian oil sands projects, so they would probably like to export some of their newly acquired oil to China.

==Economics==
The world&#x27;s largest deposits of bitumen are in Canada, although Venezuela&#x27;s deposits of extra-heavy crude oil are even bigger. Canada has vast energy resources of all types and its oil and natural gas resource base would be large enough to meet Canadian needs for generations if demand was sustained. Abundant hydroelectric resources account for the majority of Canada&#x27;s electricity production and very little electricity is produced from oil.

The National Energy Board (NEB) reported in 2013, that if oil prices are above $100, Canada would have more than enough energy to meet its growing needs. The excess oil production from the oil sands could be exported. The major importing country would probably continue to be the United States, although before the developments in 2014, there was increasing demand for oil, particularly heavy oil, from Asian countries such as China and India.

Canada has abundant resources of bitumen and crude oil, with an estimated remaining ultimate resource potential of 54 billion cubic metres (340 billion barrels). Of this, oil sands bitumen accounts for 90 per cent. Alberta currently accounts for all of Canada&#x27;s bitumen resources. &quot;Resources&quot; become &quot;reserves&quot; only after it is proven that economic recovery can be achieved. At 2013 prices using current technology, Canada had remaining oil reserves of 27 billion m3 (170 billion bbls), with 98% of this attributed to oil sands bitumen. This put its reserves in third place in the world behind Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. At the much lower prices of 2015, the reserves are much smaller.

===Costs===
The costs of production and transportation of saleable petroleum from oil sands is typically significantly higher than from conventional global sources. Hence the economic viability of oil sands production is more vulnerable to the price of oil. The price of benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil at Cushing, Oklahoma above US$100/bbl that prevailed until late 2014 was sufficient to promote active growth in oil sands production. Major Canadian oil companies had announced expansion plans and foreign companies were investing significant amounts of capital, in many cases forming partnerships with Canadian companies. Investment had been shifting towards in-situ steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) projects and away from mining and upgrading projects, as oil sands operators foresee better opportunities from selling bitumen and heavy oil directly to refineries than from upgrading it to synthetic crude oil. Cost estimates for Canada include the effects of the mining when the mines are returned to the environment in &quot;as good as or better than original condition&quot;. Cleanup of the end products of consumption are the responsibility of the consuming jurisdictions, which are mostly in provinces or countries other than the producing one.

The Alberta government estimated that in 2012, the supply cost of oil sands new mining operations was $70 to $85 per barrel, whereas the cost of new SAGD projects was $50 to $80 per barrel. These costs included capital and operating costs, royalties and taxes, plus a reasonable profit to the investors. Since the price of WTI rose to $100/bbl beginning in 2011, production from oil sands was then expected to be highly profitable assuming the product could be delivered to markets. The main market was the huge refinery complexes on the US Gulf Coast, which are generally capable of processing Canadian bitumen and Venezuelan extra-heavy oil without upgrading.

The Canadian Energy Research Institute (CERI) performed an analysis, estimating that in 2012 the average plant gate costs (including 10% profit margin, but excluding blending and transport) of primary recovery was $30.32/bbl, of SAGD was $47.57/bbl, of mining and upgrading was $99.02/bbl, and of mining without upgrading was $68.30/bbl. Thus, all types of oil sands projects except new mining projects with integrated upgraders were expected to be consistently profitable from 2011 onward, provided that global oil prices remained favourable. Since the larger and more sophisticated refineries preferred to buy raw bitumen and heavy oil rather than synthetic crude oil, new oil sands projects avoided the costs of building new upgraders. Although primary recovery such as is done in Venezuela is cheaper than SAGD, it only recovers about 10% of the oil in place versus 60% or more for SAGD and over 99% for mining. Canadian oil companies were in a more competitive market and had access to more capital than in Venezuela, and preferred to spend that extra money on SAGD or mining to recover more oil.

Then in late 2014 the dramatic rise in U.S. production from shale formations, combined with a global economic malaise that reduced demand, caused the price of WTI to drop below $50, where it remained as of late 2015. 
In 2015, the Canadian Energy Research Institute (CERI) re-estimated the average plant gate costs (again including 10% profit margin) of SAGD to be $58.65/bbl, and 70.18/bbl for mining without upgrading. Including costs of blending and transportation, the WTI equivalent supply costs for delivery to Cushing become US$80.06/bbl for SAGD projects, and $89.71/bbl for a standalone mine.
In this economic environment, plans for further development of production from oil sands have been slowed or deferred, 
 or even abandoned during construction. 
Production of synthetic crude from mining operations may continue at a loss because of the costs of shutdown and restart, as well as commitments to supply contracts. During the 2020 Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war, the price of Canadian heavy crude dipped below $5 per barrel.

===Production forecasts===
Oil sands production forecasts released by the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER), and the Canadian Energy Research Institute (CERI) are comparable to National Energy Board (NEB) projections, in terms of total bitumen production. None of these forecasts take into account probable international constraints to be imposed on combustion of all hydrocarbons in order to limit global temperature rise, giving rise to a situation denoted by the term &quot;carbon bubble&quot;. Ignoring such constraints, and also assuming that the price of oil recovers from its collapse in late 2014, the list of currently proposed projects, many of which are in the early planning stages, would suggest that by 2035 Canadian bitumen production could potentially reach as much as 1.3 million m3/d (8.3 million barrels per day) if most were to go ahead. Under the same assumptions, a more likely scenario is that by 2035, Canadian oil sands bitumen production would reach 800,000 m3/d (5.0 million barrels/day), 2.6 times the production for 2012. The majority of the growth would likely occur in the in-situ category, as in-situ projects usually have better economics than mining projects. Also, 80% of Canada&#x27;s oil sands reserves are well-suited to in-situ extraction, versus 20% for mining methods.

An additional assumption is that there would be sufficient pipeline infrastructure to deliver increased Canadian oil production to export markets. If this were a limiting factor, there could be impacts on Canadian crude oil prices, constraining future production growth. Another assumption is that US markets will continue to absorb increased Canadian exports. Rapid growth of tight oil production in the US, Canada&#x27;s primary oil export market, has greatly reduced US reliance on imported crude. The potential for Canadian oil exports to alternative markets such as Asia is also uncertain. There are increasing political obstacles to building any new pipelines to deliver oil in Canada and the US. In November 2015, U.S. President Barack Obama rejected the proposal to build the Keystone XL pipeline from Alberta to Steele City, Nebraska. 
In the absence of new pipeline capacity, companies are increasingly shipping bitumen to US markets by railway, river barge, tanker, and other transportation methods. Other than ocean tankers, these alternatives are all more expensive than pipelines.

A shortage of skilled workers in the Canadian oil sands developed during periods of rapid development of new projects. In the absence of other constraints on further development, the oil and gas industry would need to fill tens of thousands of job openings in the next few years as a result of industry activity levels as well as age-related attrition. In the longer term, under a scenario of higher oil and gas prices, the labor shortages would continue to get worse. A potential labor shortage can increase construction costs and slow the pace of oil sands development.

The skilled worker shortage was much more severe in Venezuela because the government controlled oil company PDVSA fired most of its heavy oil experts after the Venezuelan general strike of 2002–03, and wound down the production of Orimulsion, which was the primary product from its oil sands. Following that, the government re-nationalized the Venezuelan oil industry and increased taxes on it. The result was that foreign companies left Venezuela, as did most of its elite heavy oil technical experts. In recent years, Venezuela&#x27;s heavy oil production has been falling, and it has consistently been failing to meet its production targets.

As of late 2015, development of new oil sand projects were deterred by the price of WTI below US$50, which is barely enough to support production from existing operations. Demand recovery was suppressed by economic problems that may continue indefinitely to bedevil both the European Community and China. Low-cost production by OPEC continued at maximum capacity, efficiency of production from U.S. shales continued to improve, and Russian exports were mandated even below cost of production, as their only source of hard currency. There is also the possibility that there will emerge an international agreement to introduce measures to constrain the combustion of hydrocarbons in an effort to limit global temperature rise to the nominal 2 °C that is consensually predicted to limit environmental harm to tolerable levels. Rapid technological progress is being made to reduce the cost of competing renewable sources of energy. Hence there is no consensus about when, if ever, oil prices paid to producers may substantially recover.

A detailed academic study of the consequences for the producers of the various hydrocarbon fuels concluded in early 2015 that a third of global oil reserves, half of gas reserves and over 80% of current coal reserves should remain underground from 2010 to 2050 in order to meet the target of 2 °C. Hence continued exploration or development of reserves would be extraneous to needs. To meet the 2 °C target, strong measures would be needed to suppress demand, such as a substantial carbon tax leaving a lower price for the producers from a smaller market. The impact on producers in Canada would be far larger than in the U.S. Open-pit mining of natural bitumen in Canada would soon drop to negligible levels after 2020 in all scenarios considered because it is considerably less economic than other methods of production.

==Environmental issues==


In their 2011 commissioned report entitled &quot;Prudent Development: Realizing the Potential of North America&#x27;s Abundant Natural Gas and Oil Resources,&quot; the National Petroleum Council, an advisory committee to the U.S. Secretary of Energy, acknowledged health and safety concerns regarding the oil sands which include &quot;volumes of water needed to generate issues of water sourcing; removal of overburden for surface mining can fragment wildlife habitat and increase the risk of soil erosion or surface run-off events to nearby water systems; GHG and other air emissions from production.&quot;

Oil sands extraction can affect the land when the bitumen is initially mined, water resources by its requirement for large quantities of water during separation of the oil and sand, and the air due to the release of carbon dioxide and other emissions. Heavy metals such as vanadium, nickel, lead, cobalt, mercury, chromium, cadmium, arsenic, selenium, copper, manganese, iron and zinc are naturally present in oil sands and may be concentrated by the extraction process. The environmental impact caused by oil sand extraction is frequently criticized by environmental groups such as Greenpeace, Climate Reality Project, Pembina Institute, 350.org, MoveOn.org, League of Conservation Voters, Patagonia, Sierra Club, and Energy Action Coalition. In particular, mercury contamination has been found around oil sands production in Alberta, Canada. The European Union has indicated that it may vote to label oil sands oil as &quot;highly polluting&quot;. Although oil sands exports to Europe are minimal, the issue has caused friction between the EU and Canada. According to the California-based Jacobs Consultancy, the European Union used inaccurate and incomplete data in assigning a high greenhouse gas rating to gasoline derived from Alberta&#x27;s oilsands. Also, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Russia do not provide data on how much natural gas is released via flaring or venting in the oil extraction process. The Jacobs report pointed out that extra carbon emissions from oil-sand crude are 12 percent higher than from regular crude, although it was assigned a GHG rating 22% above the conventional benchmark by EU.

In 2014 results of a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showed that official reports on emissions were not high enough. Report authors noted that, &quot;emissions of organic substances with potential toxicity to humans and the environment are a major concern surrounding the rapid industrial development in the Athabasca oil sands region (AOSR).&quot; This study found that tailings ponds were an indirect pathway transporting uncontrolled releases of evaporative emissions of three representative polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)s (phenanthrene, pyrene, and benzo(a)pyrene) and that these emissions had been previously unreported.

===Air pollution management===

The Alberta government computes an Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) from sensors in five communities in the oil sands region, operated by a &quot;partner&quot; called the Wood Buffalo Environmental Association (WBEA). Each of their 17 continuously monitoring stations measure 3 to 10 air quality parameters among carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen sulfide (), total reduced sulfur (TRS), Ammonia (), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (), nitrogen oxides (NO&quot;x&quot;), ozone (), particulate matter (PM2.5), sulfur dioxide (), total hydrocarbons (THC), and methane/non-methane hydrocarbons (/NMHC). These AQHI are said to indicate &quot;low risk&quot; air quality more than 95% of the time. Prior to 2012, air monitoring showed significant increases in exceedances of hydrogen sulfide () both in the Fort McMurray area and near the oil sands upgraders. In 2007, the Alberta government issued an environmental protection order to Suncor in response to numerous occasions when ground level concentration for ) exceeded standards. The Alberta Ambient Air Data Management System (AAADMS) of the Clean Air Strategic Alliance (aka CASA Data Warehouse) records that, during the year ending on 1 November 2015, there were 6 hourly reports of values exceeding the limit of 10 ppb for , and 4 in 2013, down from 11 in 2014, and 73 in 2012.

In September 2015, the Pembina Institute published a brief report about &quot;a recent surge of odour and air quality concerns in northern Alberta associated with the expansion of oilsands development&quot;, contrasting the responses to these concerns in Peace River and Fort McKay. In Fort McKay, air quality is actively addressed by stakeholders represented in the WBEA, whereas the Peace River community must rely on the response of the Alberta Energy Regulator. In an effort to identify the sources of the noxious odours in the Fort McKay community, a Fort McKay Air Quality Index was established, extending the provincial Air Quality Health Index to include possible contributors to the problem: , TRS, and THC. Despite these advantages, more progress was made in remediating the odour problems in the Peace River community, although only after some families had already abandoned their homes. The odour concerns in Fort McKay were reported to remain unresolved.

===Land use and waste management===
A large part of oil sands mining operations involves clearing trees and brush from a site and removing the overburden—topsoil, muskeg, sand, clay and gravel—that sits atop the oil sands deposit. Approximately 2.5 tons of oil sands are needed to produce one barrel of oil (roughly of a ton). 
As a condition of licensing, projects are required to implement a reclamation plan. The mining industry asserts that the boreal forest will eventually colonize the reclaimed lands, but their operations are massive and work on long-term timeframes. As of 2013, about of land in the oil sands region have been disturbed, and of that land is under reclamation. In March 2008, Alberta issued the first-ever oil sands land reclamation certificate to Syncrude for the parcel of land known as Gateway Hill approximately north of Fort McMurray. Several reclamation certificate applications for oil sands projects are expected within the next 10 years.

===Water management===
Between 2 and 4.5 volume units of water are used to produce each volume unit of synthetic crude oil in an &quot;ex-situ&quot; mining operation. According to Greenpeace, the Canadian oil sands operations use of water, twice the amount of water used by the city of Calgary. However, in SAGD operations, 90–95% of the water is recycled and only about 0.2 volume units of water is used per volume unit of bitumen produced.

For the Athabasca oil sand operations water is supplied from the Athabasca River, the ninth longest river in Canada. The average flow just downstream of Fort McMurray is with its highest daily average measuring . Oil sands industries water license allocations totals about 1.8% of the Athabasca river flow. Actual use in 2006 was about 0.4%. In addition, according to the Water Management Framework for the Lower Athabasca River, during periods of low river flow water consumption from the Athabasca River is limited to 1.3% of annual average flow.

In December 2010, the Oil Sands Advisory Panel, commissioned by former environment minister Jim Prentice, found that the system in place for monitoring water quality in the region, including work by the Regional Aquatic Monitoring Program, the Alberta Water Research Institute, the Cumulative Environmental Management Association and others, was piecemeal and should become more comprehensive and coordinated.

===Greenhouse gas emissions===
The production of bitumen and synthetic crude oil emits more greenhouse gases than the production of conventional crude oil. A 2009 study by the consulting firm IHS CERA estimated that production from Canada&#x27;s oil sands emits &quot;about 5% to 15% more carbon dioxide, over the &quot;well-to-wheels&quot; (WTW) lifetime analysis of the fuel, than average crude oil.&quot; Author and investigative journalist David Strahan that same year stated that IEA figures show that carbon dioxide emissions from the oil sands are 20% higher than average emissions from the petroleum production.

A Stanford University study commissioned by the EU in 2011 found that oil sands crude was as much as 22% more carbon-intensive than other fuels. According to the &quot;Carnegie Endowment for International Peace&quot; analysis, oil sands emit 31% more GHG that the average North American crude oil. In 2023 a federal study found that the real emissions from oil sands are 65% higher than reported by the industry.

Greenpeace says the oil sands industry has been identified as the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions growth in Canada, as it accounts for 40 million tons of emissions per year.

According to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers and Environment Canada the industrial activity undertaken to produce oil sands make up about 5% of Canada&#x27;s greenhouse gas emissions, or 0.1% of global greenhouse gas emissions. It predicts the oil sands will grow to make up 8% of Canada&#x27;s greenhouse gas emissions by 2015. While the production industrial activity emissions per barrel of bitumen produced decreased 26% over the decade 1992–2002, total emissions from production activity were expected to increase due to higher production levels. As of 2006, to produce one barrel of oil from the oil sands released almost of greenhouse gases with total emissions estimated to be per year by 2015. A study by IHS CERA found that fuels made from Canadian oil sands resulted in significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions than many commonly cited estimates. A 2012 study by Swart and Weaver estimated that if only the economically viable reserve of oil sands was burnt, the global mean temperature would increase by 0.02 to 0.05 °C. If the entire oil-in-place of 1.8 trillion barrels were to be burnt, the predicted global mean temperature increase is 0.24 to 0.50 °C. Bergerson et al. found that while the WTW emissions can be higher than crude oil, &quot;the lower emitting oil sands cases can outperform higher emitting conventional crude cases&quot;.

To offset greenhouse gas emissions from the oil sands and elsewhere in Alberta, sequestering carbon dioxide emissions inside depleted oil and gas reservoirs has been proposed. This technology is inherited from enhanced oil recovery methods. In July 2008, the Alberta government announced a C$2 billion fund to support sequestration projects in Alberta power plants and oil sands extraction and upgrading facilities.

In November 2014, Fatih Birol, the chief economist of the International Energy Agency, described additional greenhouse gas emissions from Canada&#x27;s oil sands as &quot;extremely low&quot;. The IEA forecasts that in the next 25 years oil sands production in Canada will increase by more than , but Dr. Birol said &quot;the emissions of this additional production is equal to only 23 hours of emissions of China — not even one day.&quot; The IEA is charged with responsibility for battling climate change, but Dr. Birol said he spends little time worrying about carbon emissions from oil sands. &quot;There is a lot of discussion on oil sands projects in Canada and the United States and other parts of the world, but to be frank, the additional CO2 emissions coming from the oil sands is extremely low.&quot; Dr. Birol acknowledged that there is tremendous difference of opinion on the course of action regarding climate change, but added, &quot;I hope all these reactions are based on scientific facts and sound analysis.&quot;

In 2014, the U.S. Congressional Research Service published a report in preparation for the decision about permitting construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. The report states in part: &quot;Canadian oil sands crudes are generally more GHG emission-intensive than other crudes they may displace in U.S. refineries, and emit an estimated 17% more GHGs on a life-cycle basis than the average barrel of crude oil refined in the United States&quot;.

According to Natural Resources Canada (NRCan), by 2017, the 23 percent increase in GHG emissions in Canada from 2005 to 2017, was &quot;largely from increased oil sands production, particularly in-situ extraction&quot;.

===Aquatic life deformities===
There is conflicting research on the effects of the oil sands development on aquatic life. In 2007, Environment Canada completed a study that shows high deformity rates in fish embryos exposed to the oil sands. David W. Schindler, a limnologist from the University of Alberta, co-authored a study on Alberta&#x27;s oil sands&#x27; contribution of aromatic polycyclic compounds, some of which are known carcinogens, to the Athabasca River and its tributaries. Scientists, local doctors, and residents supported a letter sent to the Prime Minister in September 2010 calling for an independent study of Lake Athabasca (which is downstream of the oil sands) to be initiated due to the rise of deformities and tumors found in fish caught there.

The bulk of the research that defends the oil sands development is done by the Regional Aquatics Monitoring Program (RAMP), whose steering committee is composed largely of oil and gas companies. RAMP studies show that deformity rates are normal compared to historical data and the deformity rates in rivers upstream of the oil sands.

===Public health impacts===
In 2007, it was suggested that wildlife has been negatively affected by the oil sands; for instance, moose were found in a 2006 study to have as high as 453 times the acceptable levels of arsenic in their systems, though later studies lowered this to 17 to 33 times the acceptable level (although below international thresholds for consumption).

Concerns have been raised concerning the negative impacts that the oil sands have on public health, including higher than normal rates of cancer among residents of Fort Chipewyan. However, John O&#x27;Connor, the doctor who initially reported the higher cancer rates and linked them to the oil sands development, was subsequently investigated by the Alberta College of Physicians and Surgeons. The College later reported that O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s statements consisted of &quot;mistruths, inaccuracies and unconfirmed information&quot;.

In 2010, the Royal Society of Canada released a report stating that &quot;there is currently no credible evidence of environmental contaminant exposures from oil sands reaching Fort Chipewyan at levels expected to cause elevated human cancer rates.&quot;

In August 2011, the Alberta government initiated a provincial health study to examine whether a link exists between the higher rates of cancer and the oil sands emissions.

In a report released in 2014, Alberta&#x27;s Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. James Talbot, stated that &quot;There isn&#x27;t strong evidence for an association between any of these cancers and environmental exposure [to oil sands].&quot; Rather, Talbot suggested that the cancer rates at Fort Chipewyan, which were slightly higher compared with the provincial average, were likely due to a combination of factors such as high rates of smoking, obesity, diabetes, and alcoholism as well as poor levels of vaccination.

<doc id="299374" wikidata="Q438635" url="?curid=299374" title="Tina Weymouth">
<text>Martina Michèle Weymouth ( ; born November 22, 1950) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and a founding member and bassist of the new wave group Talking Heads and its side project Tom Tom Club, which she co-founded with her husband, Talking Heads drummer Chris Frantz. In 2002, Weymouth was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Talking Heads.

==Early life==
Born in Coronado, California, Weymouth is the daughter of Laura Bouchage and U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Ralph Weymouth (1917–2020). The third of eight children, her siblings include Lani and Laura Weymouth, who are collaborators in Tina&#x27;s band Tom Tom Club, and architect Yann Weymouth, the designer of the Salvador Dalí Museum in Florida. Weymouth is of Breton heritage on her mother&#x27;s side (she is the great-granddaughter of Anatole Le Braz, a Breton writer). Her mother was an immigrant from Brittany and her father was American.

When she was 12, Weymouth joined the Mrs. Tufts’ Potomac English Hand Bell Ringers, an amateur music group directed by Nancy Tufts, and toured with them. At 14, she started to teach herself the guitar.

Her early inspirations came from Bob Dylan and Peter, Paul &amp; Mary.

==Talking Heads==
As a student at the Rhode Island School of Design, she met Chris Frantz and David Byrne, who formed a band called the Artistics. She began dating Frantz and served as the band&#x27;s driver. After graduation, the three of them moved to New York City. Since Byrne and Frantz were unable to find a suitable bass guitar player she joined them at the latter&#x27;s request and began learning and playing the instrument.

As a bass player she combined the minimalist art-punk bass lines of groups such as Wire and Pere Ubu with danceable, funk-inflected riffs to provide the bedrock of Talking Heads&#x27; signature sound.

==Other musical activities==

Full members of the Compass Point All Stars, Weymouth and Frantz formed Tom Tom Club in 1980, which kept them busy during a fairly long hiatus in Talking Heads activity. When it became obvious that Talking Heads frontman David Byrne had no interest in another Talking Heads album, Weymouth, Frantz, and Jerry Harrison reunited without him for a single album called &quot;No Talking, Just Head&quot; under the name &quot;The Heads&quot; in 1996, featuring a rotating cast of vocalists. Weymouth has been critical of Byrne, describing him as &quot;a man incapable of returning friendship&quot;.

She co-produced the Happy Mondays&#x27; 1992 album &quot;Yes Please!&quot; and contributed backing vocals and percussion for the alternative rock virtual band Gorillaz on their track &quot;19-2000&quot;.

Weymouth was a judge for the second annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists&#x27; careers. She collaborated with Chicks on Speed on their cover of the Tom Tom Club&#x27;s &quot;Wordy Rappinghood&quot; for their album &quot;99 Cents&quot; in 2003 along with other female musicians such as Miss Kittin, Kevin Blechdom, Le Tigre, and Adult&#x27;s Nicola Kuperus. &quot;Wordy Rappinghood&quot; became a moderate dance hit in Europe, peaking at number two in the Dutch Top 40, number five on the Belgian Dance Chart, and at number seven on the UK Singles Chart.

==Personal life==
Weymouth and Chris Frantz married in 1977. They live in Fairfield, Connecticut, and have two sons. Her niece, Katharine Weymouth, served as publisher of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

In March 2022, Weymouth and Frantz were in a car collision with a drunk driver. Weymouth suffered a fractured sternum and three fractured ribs.

== Legacy ==
In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked her as the 29th greatest bass player of all time.

Weymouth has inspired many female bassists including Este Haim and Victoria De Angelis of Måneskin.

<text>Empress dowager (also [[dowager]] empress or empress mother; ) is the English language translation of the title given to the mother or widow of a Chinese, Japanese, Korean, or Vietnamese monarch in the Chinese cultural sphere.

The title was also given occasionally to another woman of the same generation, while a woman from the previous generation was sometimes given the title of grand empress dowager (). An empress dowager wielded power over the harem and imperial family. Numerous empress dowagers held regency during the reign of underage emperors. Many of the most prominent empress dowagers also extended their control for long periods after the emperor was old enough to govern. This was a source of political turmoil according to the traditional view of Chinese history.

In Europe, the title dowager empress was given to the wife of a deceased Emperor of Russia or Holy Roman Emperor.

====Japanese empress dowager====
In the complex organization of the Japanese Imperial Court, the title of &quot;empress dowager&quot; does not automatically devolve to the principal consort of an Emperor who has died. The title &quot;Kōtaigō&quot; can only be bestowed or granted by the Emperor who will have acceded to the Chrysanthemum Throne.

The following were among the individuals who were granted this imperial title:
* , widow of Emperor Kōkaku
* , widow of Emperor Kōmei
* , widow of Emperor Meiji
* , widow of Emperor Taishō
* , widow of Emperor Shōwa

===Europe===
====Holy Roman dowager empresses====

Adelaide of Italy was Holy Roman Empress by marriage to Emperor Otto the Great and was crowned alongside him in 962. After her husband&#x27;s death, her son Otto II succeeded as Emperor, and on his death he was succeeded by Adelaide&#x27;s grandson Otto III. She served as regent until he reached his majority.

Although never referred to as a dowager, Empress Matilda was the Holy Roman Empress from 1114 by her marriage to Emperor Henry V. She continued to be referred to as &quot;Empress&quot; long after the death of her first husband in 1125, and her subsequent remarriage to Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou in 1128.

Despite having abandoned the throne of Sicily for her son Frederick II, Empress Constance of Sicily, widow of Henry VI, retained her title as &quot;Empress Dowager&quot; until her death in 1198.

Eleonora Gonzaga, was Holy Roman Empress by marriage to Emperor Ferdinand III, and after his death was Empress Dowager from 1657–1686.

====Russian dowager empresses====
Dowager empresses of Russia held precedence over the Empress consort. This was occasionally a source of tension. For example, when Paul I was assassinated, Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna (Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg), for whom this tradition was started, often took the arm of her son Tsar Alexander I at court functions and ceremonies while his wife Empress Elizabeth Alexeievna (Louise of Baden) walked behind, which caused resentment on the part of the young empress. The same thing happened decades later when Emperor Alexander III died, and the Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark) held precedence over Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna (Alix of Hesse), which put an enormous strain on their already tense relationship. The power struggle culminated when the Dowager Empress refused to hand over certain jewels traditionally associated with the Empress Consort.

There have been four dowager empresses in Russia:
* Empress Maria Feodorovna (Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg) (1759–1828) Empress Consort of Paul I of Russia (r. 1796–1801)
* Empress Elizabeth Alexeievna (Louise of Baden) (1779–1826) Empress Consort of Alexander I of Russia (r. 1801–1825)
* Empress Alexandra Feodorovna (Charlotte of Prussia) (1798–1860) Empress Consort of Nicholas I of Russia (r. 1825–1855)
* Empress Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark) (1847–1928) Empress Consort of Alexander III of Russia (r. 1881–1894)

Empress Elizabeth Alexeievna was briefly and concurrently, along with her mother in-law Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna, a Dowager empress. She is therefore often forgotten as a Dowager Empress.

==== Indian empresses dowager ====
Queen-Empress Victoria (1819–1901, r. 1837–1901) was widowed in 1861, before her accession as Queen-Empress of India. Her son, her grandson and her great-grandson all died before their wives, and their widows were known as Empresses dowager in this Indian context. Had George VI, the last Emperor of India, died before the independence of India was proclaimed in 1947, his widow would have been known as the dowager empress of India. However, George VI did not die until 1952, some years after India&#x27;s formal independence and the renunciation of the title Emperor of India by the British monarch (which took place formally in 1948).

* Queen-Empress Alexandra (d. 20 Nov. 1925), widow of King-Emperor Edward VII (r. 1901–1910)
* Queen-Empress Mary (d. 24 Mar. 1953), widow of King-Emperor George V (r. 1910–1936)
* Queen-Empress Elizabeth (d. 30 Mar. 2002), widow of King-Emperor George VI (r. 1936–1947)

<text>Political sociology is an interdisciplinary field of study concerned with exploring how governance and society interact and influence one another at the micro to macro levels of analysis. Interested in the social causes and consequences of how power is distributed and changes throughout and amongst societies, political sociology&#x27;s focus ranges across individual families to the state as sites of social and political conflict and power contestation.

== Introduction ==
Political sociology was conceived as an interdisciplinary sub-field of sociology and politics in the early 1930s throughout the social and political disruptions that took place through the rise of communism, fascism, and World War II. This new area drawing upon works by Alexis de Tocqueville, James Bryce, Robert Michels, Max Weber, Émile Durkheim, and Karl Marx to understand an integral theme of political sociology: power.

Power&#x27;s definition for political sociologists varies across the approaches and conceptual framework utilised within this interdisciplinary study. At its basic understanding, power can be seen as the ability to influence or control other people or processes around you. This helps to create a variety of research focuses and use of methodologies as different scholars&#x27; understanding of power differs. Alongside this, their academic disciplinary department/ institution can also flavour their research as they develop from their baseline of inquiry (e.g. political or sociological studies) into this interdisciplinary field (see ). Although with deviation in how it is carried out, political sociology has an overall focus on understanding why power structures are the way they are in any given societal context.

Political sociologists, throughout its broad manifestations, propose that in order to understand power, society and politics must be studied with one another and neither treated as assumed variables. In the words of political scientist Michael Rush, &quot;For any society to be understood, so must its politics; and if the politics of any society is to be understood, so must that society.&quot;

== Origins ==
The development of political sociology from the 1930s onwards took place as the separating disciplines of sociology and politics explored their overlapping areas of interest. Sociology can be viewed as the broad analysis of human society and the interrelationship of these societies. Predominantly focused on the relationship of human behaviour with society. Political science or politics as a study largely situates itself within this definition of sociology and is sometimes regarded as a well developed sub-field of sociology, but is seen as a stand alone disciplinary area of research due to the size of scholarly work undertaken within it. Politics offers a complex definition and is important to note that what &#x27;politics&#x27; means is subjective to the author and context. From the study of governmental institutions, public policy, to power relations, politics has a rich disciplinary outlook. 

The importance of studying sociology within politics, and vice versa, has had recognition across figures from Mosca to Pareto as they recognised that politicians and politics do not operate in a societal vacuum, and society does not operate outside of politics. Here, political sociology sets about to study the relationships of society and politics. 

Numerous works account for highlighting a political sociology, from the work of Comte and Spencer to other figures such as Durkheim. Although feeding into this interdisciplinary area, the body of work by Karl Marx and Max Weber are considered foundational to its inception as a sub-field of research. 

== Scope ==

=== Overview ===
The scope of political sociology is broad, reflecting on the wide interest in how power and oppression operate over and within social and political areas in society. Although diverse, some major themes of interest for political sociology include: 

# Understanding the dynamics of how the state and society exercise and contest power (e.g. power structures, authority, social inequality).
#How political values and behaviours shape society and how society&#x27;s values and behaviours shape politics (e.g. public opinion, ideologies, social movements). 
#How these operate across formal and informal areas of politics and society (e.g. ministerial cabinet vs. family home).
#How socio-political cultures and identities change over time. 

In other words, political sociology is concerned with how social trends, dynamics, and structures of domination affect formal political processes alongside social forces working together to create change. From this perspective, we can identify three major theoretical frameworks: pluralism, elite or managerial theory, and class analysis, which overlaps with Marxist analysis. 

Pluralism sees politics primarily as a contest among competing interest groups. Elite or managerial theory is sometimes called a state-centered approach. It explains what the state does by looking at constraints from organizational structure, semi-autonomous state managers, and interests that arise from the state as a unique, power-concentrating organization. A leading representative is Theda Skocpol. Social class theory analysis emphasizes the political power of capitalist elites. It can be split into two parts: one is the &quot;power structure&quot; or &quot;instrumentalist&quot; approach, whereas another is the structuralist approach. The power structure approach focuses on the question of who rules and its most well-known representative is G. William Domhoff. The structuralist approach emphasizes the way a capitalist economy operates; only allowing and encouraging the state to do some things but not others (Nicos Poulantzas, Bob Jessop).

Where a typical research question in political sociology might have been, &quot;Why do so few American or European citizens choose to vote?&quot; or even, &quot;What difference does it make if women get elected?&quot;, political sociologists also now ask, &quot;How is the body a site of power?&quot;, &quot;How are emotions relevant to global poverty?&quot;, and &quot;What difference does knowledge make to democracy?&quot;

=== Political sociology vs. sociology of politics ===
While both are valid lines of enquiry, sociology of politics is a sociological reductionist account of politics (e.g. exploring political areas through a sociological lens), whereas political sociology is a collaborative socio-political exploration of society and its power contestation. When addressing political sociology, there is noted overlap in using &quot;sociology of politics&quot; as a synonym. Sartori outlines that &quot;sociology of politics&quot; refers specifically to a sociological analysis of politics and not an interdisciplinary area of research that political sociology works towards. This difference is made by the variables of interest that both perspectives focus upon. Sociology of politics centres on the non-political causes of oppression and power contestation in political life, whereas political sociology includes the political causes of these actions throughout commentary with non-political ones.

== People ==
=== Karl Marx ===

Marx&#x27;s ideas about the state can be divided into three subject areas: pre-capitalist states, states in the capitalist (i.e. present) era and the state (or absence of one) in post-capitalist society. Overlaying this is the fact that his own ideas about the state changed as he grew older, differing in his early pre-communist phase, the young Marx phase which predates the unsuccessful 1848 uprisings in Europe and in his mature, more nuanced work.

In Marx&#x27;s 1843 &quot;Critique of Hegel&#x27;s Philosophy of Right&quot;, his basic conception is that the state and civil society are separate. However, he already saw some limitations to that model, arguing: &quot;The political state everywhere needs the guarantee of spheres lying outside it.&quot; He added: &quot;He as yet was saying nothing about the abolition of private property, does not express a developed theory of class, and &quot;the solution [he offers] to the problem of the state/civil society separation is a purely &quot;political&quot; solution, namely universal suffrage&quot;.

By the time he wrote &quot;The German Ideology&quot; (1846), Marx viewed the state as a creature of the bourgeois economic interest. Two years later, that idea was expounded in &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot;: &quot;The executive of the modern state is nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.&quot;

This represents the high point of conformance of the state theory to an economic interpretation of history in which the forces of production determine peoples&#x27; production relations and their production relations determine all other relations, including the political. Although &quot;determines&quot; is the strong form of the claim, Marx also uses &quot;conditions&quot;. Even &quot;determination&quot; is not causality and some reciprocity of action is admitted. The bourgeoisie control the economy, therefore they control the state. In this theory, the state is an instrument of class rule.

=== Antonio Gramsci ===
Antonio Gramsci&#x27;s theory of hegemony is tied to his conception of the capitalist state. Gramsci does not understand the state in the narrow sense of the government. Instead, he divides it between political society (the police, the army, legal system, etc.) – the arena of political institutions and legal constitutional control – and civil society (the family, the education system, trade unions, etc.) – commonly seen as the private or non-state sphere, which mediates between the state and the economy. However, he stresses that the division is purely conceptual and that the two often overlap in reality. Gramsci claims the capitalist state rules through force plus consent: political society is the realm of force and civil society is the realm of consent. Gramsci proffers that under modern capitalism the bourgeoisie can maintain its economic control by allowing certain demands made by trade unions and mass political parties within civil society to be met by the political sphere. Thus, the bourgeoisie engages in passive revolution by going beyond its immediate economic interests and allowing the forms of its hegemony to change. Gramsci posits that movements such as reformism and fascism, as well as the scientific management and assembly line methods of Frederick Taylor and Henry Ford respectively, are examples of this. 

=== Ralph Miliband ===
English Marxist sociologist Ralph Miliband was influenced by American sociologist C. Wright Mills, of whom he had been a friend. He published &quot;The State in Capitalist Society&quot; in 1969, a study in Marxist political sociology, rejecting the idea that pluralism spread political power, and maintaining that power in Western democracies was concentrated in the hands of a dominant class.

=== Nicos Poulantzas ===
Nicos Poulantzas&#x27; theory of the state reacted to what he saw as simplistic understandings within Marxism. For him Instrumentalist Marxist accounts such as that of Miliband held that the state was simply an instrument in the hands of a particular class. Poulantzas disagreed with this because he saw the capitalist class as too focused on its individual short-term profit, rather than on maintaining the class&#x27;s power as a whole, to simply exercise the whole of state power in its own interest. Poulantzas argued that the state, though relatively autonomous from the capitalist class, nonetheless functions to ensure the smooth operation of capitalist society, and therefore benefits the capitalist class. In particular, he focused on how an inherently divisive system such as capitalism could coexist with the social stability necessary for it to reproduce itself—looking in particular to nationalism as a means to overcome the class divisions within capitalism. Borrowing from Gramsci&#x27;s notion of cultural hegemony, Poulantzas argued that repressing movements of the oppressed is not the sole function of the state. Rather, state power must also obtain the consent of the oppressed. It does this through class alliances, where the dominant group makes an &quot;alliance&quot; with subordinate groups as a means to obtain the consent of the subordinate group. 

=== Bob Jessop ===
Bob Jessop was influenced by Gramsci, Miliband and Poulantzas to propose that the state is not as an entity but as a social relation with differential strategic effects. This means that the state is not something with an essential, fixed property such as a neutral coordinator of different social interests, an autonomous corporate actor with its own bureaucratic goals and interests, or the &#x27;executive committee of the bourgeoisie&#x27; as often described by pluralists, elitists/statists and conventional Marxists respectively. Rather, what the state is essentially determined by is the nature of the wider social relations in which it is situated, especially the balance of social forces. 

=== Max Weber ===
In political sociology, one of Weber&#x27;s most influential contributions is his &quot;Politics as a Vocation&quot; (&quot;Politik als Beruf&quot;) essay. Therein, Weber unveils the definition of the state as that entity that possesses a monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force. Weber wrote that politics is the sharing of state&#x27;s power between various groups, and political leaders are those who wield this power. Weber distinguished three ideal types of political leadership (alternatively referred to as three types of domination, legitimisation or authority):
# charismatic authority (familial and religious),
# traditional authority (patriarchs, patrimonialism, feudalism) and
# legal authority (modern law and state, bureaucracy).
In his view, every historical relation between rulers and ruled contained such elements and they can be analysed on the basis of this tripartite distinction. He notes that the instability of charismatic authority forces it to &quot;routinise&quot; into a more structured form of authority. In a pure type of traditional rule, sufficient resistance to a ruler can lead to a &quot;traditional revolution&quot;. The move towards a rational-legal structure of authority, utilising a bureaucratic structure, is inevitable in the end. Thus this theory can be sometimes viewed as part of the social evolutionism theory. This ties to his broader concept of rationalisation by suggesting the inevitability of a move in this direction, in which &quot;Bureaucratic administration means fundamentally domination through knowledge.&quot;

Weber described many ideal types of public administration and government in &quot;Economy and Society&quot; (1922). His critical study of the bureaucratisation of society became one of the most enduring parts of his work. It was Weber who began the studies of bureaucracy and whose works led to the popularisation of this term. Many aspects of modern public administration go back to him and a classic, hierarchically organised civil service of the Continental type is called &quot;Weberian civil service&quot;. As the most efficient and rational way of organising, bureaucratisation for Weber was the key part of the rational-legal authority and furthermore, he saw it as the key process in the ongoing rationalisation of the Western society. Weber&#x27;s ideal bureaucracy is characterised by hierarchical organisation, by delineated lines of authority in a fixed area of activity, by action taken (and recorded) on the basis of written rules, by bureaucratic officials needing expert training, by rules being implemented neutrally and by career advancement depending on technical qualifications judged by organisations, not by individuals.

Vilfredo Pareto (1848–1923), Gaetano Mosca (1858–1941), and Robert Michels (1876–1936), were cofounders of the Italian school of elitism which influenced subsequent elite theory in the Western tradition.

The outlook of the Italian school of elitism is based on two ideas: Power lies in position of authority in key economic and political institutions. The psychological difference that sets elites apart is that they have personal resources, for instance intelligence and skills, and a vested interest in the government; while the rest are incompetent and do not have the capabilities of governing themselves, the elite are resourceful and strive to make the government work. For in reality, the elite would have the most to lose in a failed state.

Pareto emphasized the psychological and intellectual superiority of elites, believing that they were the highest achievers in any field. He discussed the existence of two types of elites: Governing elites and Non-governing elites. He also extended the idea that a whole elite can be replaced by a new one and how one can circulate from being elite to non-elite. Mosca emphasized the sociological and personal characteristics of elites. He said elites are an organized minority and that the masses are an unorganized majority. The ruling class is composed of the ruling elite and the sub-elites. He divides the world into two group: Political class and Non-Political class. Mosca asserts that elites have intellectual, moral, and material superiority that is highly esteemed and influential.

Sociologist Michels developed the iron law of oligarchy where, he asserts, social and political organizations are run by few individuals, and social organization and labor division are key. He believed that all organizations were elitist and that elites have three basic principles that help in the bureaucratic structure of political organization: 
# Need for leaders, specialized staff and facilities
# Utilization of facilities by leaders within their organization
# The importance of the psychological attributes of the leaders

=== Pluralism and power relations ===
Contemporary political sociology takes these questions seriously, but it is concerned with the play of power and politics across societies, which includes, but is not restricted to, relations between the state and society. In part, this is a product of the growing complexity of social relations, the impact of social movement organizing, and the relative weakening of the state as a result of globalization. To a significant part, however, it is due to the radical rethinking of social theory. This is as much focused now on micro questions (such as the formation of identity through social interaction, the politics of knowledge, and the effects of the contestation of meaning on structures), as it is on macro questions (such as how to capture and use state power). Chief influences here include cultural studies (Stuart Hall), post-structuralism (Michel Foucault, Judith Butler), pragmatism (Luc Boltanski), structuration theory (Anthony Giddens), and cultural sociology (Jeffrey C. Alexander).

Political sociology attempts to explore the dynamics between the two institutional systems introduced by the advent of Western capitalist system that are the democratic constitutional liberal state and the capitalist economy. While democracy promises impartiality and legal equality before all citizens, the capitalist system results in unequal economic power and thus possible political inequality as well.

For pluralists, the distribution of political power is not determined by economic interests but by multiple social divisions and political agendas. The diverse political interests and beliefs of different factions work together through collective organizations to create a flexible and fair representation that in turn influences political parties which make the decisions. The distribution of power is then achieved through the interplay of contending interest groups. The government in this model functions just as a mediating broker and is free from control by any economic power. This pluralistic democracy however requires the existence of an underlying framework that would offer mechanisms for citizenship and expression and the opportunity to organize representations through social and industrial organizations, such as trade unions. Ultimately, decisions are reached through the complex process of bargaining and compromise between various groups pushing for their interests. Many factors, pluralists believe, have ended the domination of the political sphere by an economic elite. The power of organized labour and the increasingly interventionist state have placed restrictions on the power of capital to manipulate and control the state. Additionally, capital is no longer owned by a dominant class, but by an expanding managerial sector and diversified shareholders, none of whom can exert their will upon another.

The pluralist emphasis on fair representation however overshadows the constraints imposed on the extent of choice offered. Bachrauch and Baratz (1963) examined the deliberate withdrawal of certain policies from the political arena. For example, organized movements that express what might seem as radical change in a society can often by portrayed as illegitimate.

=== Power elite ===
A main rival to pluralist theory in the United States was the theory of the &quot;power elite&quot; by sociologist C. Wright Mills. According to Mills, the eponymous &quot;power elite&quot; are those that occupy the dominant positions, in the dominant institutions (military, economic and political) of a dominant country, and their decisions (or lack of decisions) have enormous consequences, not only for the U.S. population but, &quot;the underlying populations of the world.&quot; The institutions which they head, Mills posits, are a triumvirate of groups that have succeeded weaker predecessors: (1) &quot;two or three hundred giant corporations&quot; which have replaced the traditional agrarian and craft economy, (2) a strong federal political order that has inherited power from &quot;a decentralized set of several dozen states&quot; and &quot;now enters into each and every cranny of the social structure&quot;, and (3) the military establishment, formerly an object of &quot;distrust fed by state militia,&quot; but now an entity with &quot;all the grim and clumsy efficiency of a sprawling bureaucratic domain.&quot;
Importantly, and in distinction from modern American conspiracy theory, Mills explains that the elite themselves may not be aware of their status as an elite, noting that &quot;often they are uncertain about their roles&quot; and &quot;without conscious effort, they absorb the aspiration to be ... The Onecide.&quot; Nonetheless, he sees them as a quasi-hereditary caste. The members of the power elite, according to Mills, often enter into positions of societal prominence through educations obtained at establishment universities. The resulting elites, who control the three dominant institutions (military, economy and political system) can be generally grouped into one of six types, according to Mills: 
* the &quot;Metropolitan 400&quot;, members of historically notable local families in the principal American cities, generally represented on the Social Register
* &quot;Celebrities&quot;, prominent entertainers and media personalities
* the &quot;Chief Executives&quot;, presidents and CEOs of the most important companies within each industrial sector
* the &quot;Corporate Rich&quot;, major landowners and corporate shareholders
* the &quot;Warlords&quot;, senior military officers, most importantly the Joint Chiefs of Staff
* the &quot;Political Directorate&quot;, &quot;fifty-odd men of the executive branch&quot; of the U.S. federal government, including the senior leadership in the Executive Office of the President, sometimes variously drawn from elected officials of the Democratic and Republican parties but usually professional government bureaucrats

Mills formulated a very short summary of his book: &quot;Who, after all, runs America? No one runs it altogether, but in so far as any group does, the power elite.&quot;

&quot;Who Rules America?&quot; is a book by research psychologist and sociologist, G. William Domhoff, first published in 1967 as a best-seller (#12), with six subsequent editions. Domhoff argues in the book that a power elite wields power in America through its support of think-tanks, foundations, commissions, and academic departments. Additionally, he argues that the elite control institutions through overt authority, not through covert influence. In his introduction, Domhoff writes that the book was inspired by the work of four men: sociologists E. Digby Baltzell, C. Wright Mills, economist Paul Sweezy, and political scientist Robert A. Dahl.

== Concepts ==

=== T. H. Marshall on citizenship ===
T. H. Marshall&#x27;s Social Citizenship is a political concept first highlighted in his essay, &quot;Citizenship and Social Class&quot; in 1949. Marshall&#x27;s concept defines the social responsibilities the state has to its citizens or, as Marshall puts it, &quot;from [granting] the right to a modicum of economic welfare and security to the right to share to the full in the social heritage and to live the life of a civilized being according to the standards prevailing in the society&quot;. One of the key points made by Marshall is his belief in an evolution of rights in England acquired via citizenship, from &quot;civil rights in the eighteenth [century], political in the nineteenth, and social in the twentieth&quot;. This evolution however, has been criticized by many for only being from the perspective of the white working man. Marshall concludes his essay with three major factors for the evolution of social rights and for their further evolution, listed below: 
# The lessening of the income gap
# &quot;The great extension of the area of common culture and common experience&quot;
# An enlargement of citizenship and more rights granted to these citizens. 
Many of the social responsibilities of a state have since become a major part of many state&#x27;s policies (see United States Social Security). However, these have also become controversial issues as there is a debate over whether a citizen truly has the right to education and even more so, to social welfare.

=== Seymour Martin Lipset on the social requisites of democracy ===
In &quot;Political Man: The Social Bases of Politics&quot; political sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset provided a very influential analysis of the bases of democracy across the world. Larry Diamond and Gary Marks argue that &quot;Lipset&#x27;s assertion of a direct relationship between economic development and democracy has been subjected to extensive empirical examination, both quantitative and qualitative, in the past 30 years. And the evidence shows, with striking clarity and consistency, a strong causal relationship between economic development and democracy.&quot; The book sold more than 400,000 copies and was translated into 20 languages, including: Vietnamese, Bengali, and Serbo-Croatian. Lipset was one of the first proponents of Modernization theory which states that democracy is the direct result of economic growth, and that &quot;[t]he more well-to-do a nation, the greater the chances that it will sustain democracy.&quot; Lipset&#x27;s modernization theory has continued to be a significant factor in academic discussions and research relating to democratic transitions. It has been referred to as the &quot;Lipset hypothesis&quot;, as well as the &quot;Lipset thesis&quot;.

<text>The Battle of Pea Ridge (March 7–8, 1862), also known as the Battle of Elkhorn Tavern, took place during the American Civil War near Leetown, northeast of Fayetteville, Arkansas. Federal forces, led by Brig. Gen. Samuel R. Curtis, moved south from central Missouri, driving Confederate forces into northwestern Arkansas. Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn had launched a Confederate counteroffensive, hoping to recapture northern Arkansas and Missouri. Confederate forces met at Bentonville and became the most substantial Rebel force, by way of guns and men, to assemble in the Trans-Mississippi. Against the odds, Curtis held off the Confederate attack on the first day and drove Van Dorn&#x27;s force off the battlefield on the second. By defeating the Confederates, the Union forces established Federal control of most of Missouri and northern Arkansas.

==Background==
Union forces in Missouri during the latter part of 1861 and early 1862 had pushed the Confederate Missouri State Guard under Maj.-Gen. Sterling Price out of the state. By spring 1862, Federal Brig. Gen. Samuel R. Curtis determined to pursue the Confederates into Arkansas with his Army of the Southwest.

Curtis moved his approximately 10,250 soldiers and 50 artillery pieces into Benton County, Arkansas, and along Little Sugar Creek. The Federal forces consisted primarily of soldiers from Iowa, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, and Ohio. Over half of the Union soldiers were German immigrants, grouped into the 1st and 2nd Divisions, which were under the command of Brig. Gen. Franz Sigel, a German immigrant who had expected to command the army forces into Arkansas. Upon learning that General Curtis was appointed in command, Sigel threatened to resign. The predominantly native-born regiments were assigned to the 3rd and 4th Divisions in order to create an ethnic balance among divisions and their commanders.

Price and his troops pulled back into Arkansas along Wire Road at a rapid pace with Curtis not far behind. There were skirmishes between Federal and Confederate troops at Potts Hill and Little Sugar Creek as Confederate reinforcements reached Price to combine forces against Curtis. The combined Rebel force kept continuing farther into Arkansas thinning Curtis&#x27;s supply line. Due to the length of Curtis&#x27;s supply lines and a lack of the reinforcements needed for a further advance, Curtis decided to remain in position. He fortified an excellent defensive line on the north side of the creek, placing artillery for an expected Confederate assault from the south. While Curtis kept position along Little Sugar Creek, Confederate generals Sterling Price and Benjamin McCulloch went into Fayetteville evacuating the city and setting up camp in the Boston Mountains.

Confederate Maj.-Gen. Earl Van Dorn had been appointed as the overall commander of the Trans-Mississippi District to quell a simmering conflict between Price of Missouri and McCulloch of Texas. Van Dorn&#x27;s Trans-Mississippi District totaled approximately 16,000 men, which included 800 Indian troops, Price&#x27;s Missouri State Guard contingents and other Missouri units, and McCulloch&#x27;s contingent of cavalry, infantry, and artillery from Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Missouri.

Van Dorn was aware of the federal movements into Arkansas and was intent on destroying Curtis&#x27;s Army of the Southwest and reopening the gateway into Missouri. He intended to flank Curtis and attack his rear, forcing Curtis to retreat north or be encircled and destroyed. Van Dorn had ordered his army to travel light so each soldier carried only three days&#x27; rations, forty rounds of ammunition, and a blanket. Each division was allowed an ammunition train and an additional day of rations. All other supplies, including tents and cooking utensils, were to be left behind.

==Prelude==

On March 4, 1862, instead of attacking Curtis&#x27;s position head on, Van Dorn split his army into two divisions under Price and McCulloch, ordering a march north along the Bentonville Detour to get behind Curtis and cut his lines of communication. For speed, Van Dorn left his supply trains behind, which proved a crucial decision. Amid a freezing storm, the Confederates made a three-day forced march from Fayetteville through Elm Springs and Osage Spring to Bentonville, arriving stretched out along the road, hungry and tired.

===Action at Bentonville===
Warned by scouts and Arkansas unionists, Curtis rapidly concentrated his outlying units behind Little Sugar Creek, placing William Vandever&#x27;s 700-man brigade, who marched in 16 hours from Huntsville to Little Sugar Creek. But Curtis&#x27;s right flank also suffered from Sigel&#x27;s having sent a 360-man task force to the west, where they would miss the next three days of fighting. Sigel also withdrew a cavalry patrol from the road on which the Confederate army was advancing; however, Colonel Frederick Schaefer of the 2nd Missouri Infantry, on his own initiative, extended his patrols to cover the gap. When Van Dorn&#x27;s advance guard blundered into one of these patrols near Elm Springs, the Federals were alerted. Still, Sigel was so slow in evacuating Bentonville that his rear guard was nearly snared by Van Dorn on March 6 as he advanced.

Waiting until the Confederate advance was nearly upon him, Sigel ordered his 600 men and six guns to fall back on a road leading northeast toward Curtis&#x27;s position. The Confederate 1st Missouri Cavalry led by Elijah Gates attacked from the south to cut off Sigel&#x27;s retreat. They managed to surprise and capture a company of the 36th Illinois, but many were freed when Sigel&#x27;s withdrawing men unexpectedly bumped into them. Sigel managed to fight his way through Gates&#x27; men, helped by a blunder by confederate Brig. Gen. James M. McIntosh.
McIntosh had planned to envelop Sigel&#x27;s force from the northwest while Gates closed the trap on the south. However, McIntosh mistakenly took his 3,000-man cavalry brigade too far up a northerly road. After marching three miles out of his way, he turned his troopers onto the road leading east into the Little Sugar Creek valley. By the time they reached the site where Sigel&#x27;s northeast road met McIntosh&#x27;s east-bound road, the Federal general&#x27;s men had already passed the intersection thus avoiding a disaster. When the 3rd Texas Cavalry charged, they ran smack into Sigel&#x27;s main line. The Confederates lost 10 men while 20 or more were wounded by Federal artillery and rifle fire and the Union position held.

===Geography===

Curtis placed his four small divisions astride the Telegraph or Wire Road in a fortified position atop the bluffs north of Little Sugar Creek. From the creek, the Telegraph Road went northeast to Elkhorn Tavern where it intersected the Huntsville Road leading east, and Ford Road leading west. From Elkhorn, the Wire Road continued north and down into Cross Timber Hollow before crossing the border into Missouri. From there, the Federal supply line followed the Telegraph Road northeast to St. Louis. The hamlet of Leetown lay north-west of the Telegraph Road, about halfway between Curtis&#x27;s position on the bluffs and Ford Road. Curtis made his headquarters at Pratt&#x27;s Store, located on the Wire Road between Elkhorn and Little Sugar Creek.

Van Dorn sought the Federal rear via the Bentonville Detour. This ran from Camp Stephens, west of Curtis&#x27;s position, northeast onto the Pea Ridge plateau. At Twelve Corner Church, which still stands today, Ford Road branched east to Elkhorn; the Detour continued northeast, meeting the Wire Road just north of Cross Timber Hollow. South of the Bentonville Detour, west of Cross Timber Hollow, and north of Ford Road lay the militarily impassable Big Mountain.

On the night of March 6, Col. Grenville Dodge, with Curtis&#x27;s approval, led several parties to obstruct the Bentonville Detour, felling trees on the road between Twelve Corner Church and Cross Timber Hollow. That same evening, Van Dorn&#x27;s army, Price&#x27;s Division leading, began the long march to Cross Timber Hollow. The night march was slowed by clearing Dodge&#x27;s obstructions, Van Dorn&#x27;s lack of an engineer corps, poor staff work, and the soldiers&#x27; exhaustion.

==Opposing forces==

===Union===
===Confederate===
==Battle, March 7==

===Contact===

Van Dorn had planned for both his divisions to reach Cross Timber Hollow, but by dawn, only the head of Price&#x27;s division had made it that far. Because of the delay, Van Dorn instructed McCulloch&#x27;s division to take the Ford Road from Twelve Corner Church and meet Price at Elkhorn.

That morning, Federal patrols detected both threats. Not knowing where the Confederate main body was located, Curtis sent Dodge&#x27;s brigade of Col. Eugene A. Carr&#x27;s 4th Division northeast up the Wire Road to join the 24th Missouri Infantry at Elkhorn Tavern. But Dodge, still worried about the threat to the Federal rear, had disobeyed orders and pulled his brigade back to Pratt&#x27;s Store, available to immediately reinforce Elkhorn. Curtis also sent a task force under Col. Peter J. Osterhaus north to reconnoiter along Ford Road. Osterhaus&#x27; force consisted of Col. Nicholas Greusel&#x27;s brigade of his own 1st Division, several cavalry units led by Col. Cyrus Bussey, and twelve cannons.

===Leetown===

McCulloch&#x27;s force consisted of a cavalry brigade under Brigadier General James McIntosh, an infantry brigade under Col. Louis Hébert, and a combined force of Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Seminole cavalry under Brig. Gen. Albert Pike. McCulloch&#x27;s troops swung west on the Ford Road and plowed into elements of the Federal army at a small village named Leetown, where a fierce firefight erupted.

At 11:30 a.m. Osterhaus rode north through a belt of timber onto Foster Farm and witnessed an astonishing sight. McCulloch&#x27;s entire division was marching east on Ford Road only a few hundred yards away. Despite the odds, Osterhaus ordered Bussey&#x27;s small force to attack to buy time for his infantry brigade to deploy. Three Federal cannon began shelling the Southerners, killing at least ten. McCulloch wheeled McIntosh&#x27;s 3,000 horsemen to the south to attack. The massed Confederate charge overwhelmed Bussey&#x27;s force, stampeding them and capturing the cannons. A little further west, two companies of the 3rd Iowa ran into Pike&#x27;s Cherokee and were similarly routed. The Iowa unit&#x27;s unusual killed-to-wounded ratio, 24 killed and 17 wounded, suggests that the Native American warriors killed a number of wounded Northerners. This incident tarnished Pike&#x27;s image and reputation for the duration of his life giving evidence that the Native Americans laid finishing blows on the wounded as well as scalped and mutilated some in the surprised Union troop.

South of the belt of timber lay Oberson&#x27;s Field, where Greusel had time to form his brigade and nine cannon on the forest edge on the south side. Sul Ross alertly led the 6th Texas Cavalry in pursuit of Bussey&#x27;s force. But when Ross rode into the field, his men were fired on and quickly fell back. Greusel shook out two companies of skirmishers from the 36th Illinois and posted them along the southern edge of the belt of timber between Oberson&#x27;s and Foster&#x27;s fields. The Federal gunners began lobbing shells over the belt of timber. Though the howitzers were fired blindly, their first shell bursts panicked the Cherokee, who rapidly retreated and could not be rallied. Meanwhile, McCulloch had formed Louis Hébert&#x27;s 4,000-man infantry brigade across a wide front and sent them south. Hébert took control of the four regiments east of the north-south Leetown Road, while McCulloch took charge of the four regiments west of the road.

The Texan general McCulloch rode forward into the belt of timber to personally reconnoiter the Federal positions, and coming into range of the Illinois skirmishers was shot through the heart. McIntosh was notified after a delay that he was in command, but his staff, fearing that the death of their popular leader would dishearten his soldiers, made the unwise decision not to share the bad news with many of the subordinate officers. Without consulting Hébert, or anyone else, McIntosh impulsively led his former regiment, the dismounted 2nd Arkansas Mounted Rifles Regiment into the attack. As the unit reached the southern edge of the belt of timber, it was met with a massed volley from Greusel&#x27;s brigade and McIntosh dropped dead with a bullet in him. In the meantime, unaware that he was now in command of the division, Hébert led the left wing of the attack south into the woods. Meanwhile, the colonels of the right wing regiments withdrew to await orders from Hébert. It was about 2:00 p.m. The blind Federal bombardment of Foster&#x27;s Farm and the breakdown in the Confederate command structure began to destroy the morale of McCulloch&#x27;s division.

Hébert&#x27;s powerful attack was stopped in the nick of time by Col. Jefferson C. Davis and the 3rd Division. Davis was originally destined for Elkhorn, but Curtis diverted his troops to Leetown after Osterhaus&#x27; report reached him. The four Southern regiments nearly overran Davis&#x27; leading brigade under Col. Julius White.

Davis ordered a cavalry battalion to charge, but this effort was easily routed by the Southern infantry. When Col. Thomas Pattison&#x27;s brigade arrived, Davis sent them up a forest trail to envelop Hébert&#x27;s open left flank. Untroubled by the inert Confederate units on Foster&#x27;s Farm, Osterhaus was able to &quot;box in&quot; Hébert&#x27;s right flank. After very hard fighting in dense woods, the Confederates, pressed from three sides, were driven back to the Ford Road. In the smoky confusion, Hébert and a small party, having become separated from the rest of the left wing, blundered through a gap in the Federal lines and got lost in the woods. Later that day, a Federal cavalry unit captured Hébert and his group.

At this point, command of McCulloch&#x27;s division would normally have devolved upon Col. Elkanah Greer, the commander of the 3rd Texas Cavalry Regiment, but due to the prevailing command confusion, he was not notified of his superior officers&#x27; death or capture for several hours. In the meantime, Brig. Gen. Albert Pike, technically outside the chain of command of McCulloch&#x27;s division assumed command on the Leetown battlefield around 3:00 p.m. At 3:30 p.m., even as Hébert was still battling in the woods, Pike decided to lead the regiments nearest to him in retreat back to Twelve Corners Church. This movement took place in total confusion, several units being left behind on the field, some marching back towards Camp Stephens, others around Big Mountain towards Van Dorn and the rest of the army. At least one regiment was at this point ordered to discard its arms and bury them for later recovery. It was only several hours later that Greer assumed command of the remaining forces and was at that point informed of Pike&#x27;s actions. Initially, he considered remaining on the battlefield but after consulting with Van Dorn decided to withdraw his forces as well and join the remainder of the army in Cross Timber Hollow.

===Elkhorn Tavern===

Around 9:30 a.m., Cearnal&#x27;s cavalry battalion in Price&#x27;s advance guard bumped into a company of the 24th Missouri Volunteer Infantry in Cross Timber Hollow. Soon after, Carr arrived at Elkhorn Tavern with Dodge&#x27;s brigade right behind. Carr spread out his regiments facing north along the edge of the plateau near the tavern and pulled the 24th Missouri back to cover their left flank at the base of Big Mountain. The Fourth Division commander then sent the 1st Iowa Battery&#x27;s four guns forward to slow the Confederate advance.

At this point, Van Dorn, instead of rushing Carr&#x27;s badly outnumbered force with all 5,000 of his available soldiers, became cautious and ordered Price to fully deploy his division, with the Missouri State Guard divisions on the right and the Confederate Missouri brigades on the left. When the Northern guns began firing, Van Dorn ordered his own artillery into action. Soon, 21 Southern guns were pounding the Iowa cannoneers. By the time Price&#x27;s infantry finally began edging uphill toward the Yankee guns, they met Carr&#x27;s men advancing downhill in an aggressive counterstroke. The Confederate advance stalled near Elkhorn, but Price&#x27;s left flank units were marching up Williams Hollow further to the east. Once this force reached the plateau, Carr&#x27;s right flank would be turned.

By 12:30 p.m., Carr&#x27;s second brigade, Vandever&#x27;s, arrived at Elkhorn. The Federal division commander immediately launched this unit in a counterattack on Price&#x27;s right flank. Superior numbers of Southerners eventually forced Vandever to pull back a short distance uphill. At 2:00 p.m. Van Dorn 
found out that McCulloch&#x27;s division would not be meeting Price&#x27;s at Elkhorn. At this time, Henry Little, on his own initiative, waved his 1st Missouri Brigade forward and the Rebel advance began to roll uphill. These events finally convinced Van Dorn to take more aggressive action. Price was wounded but remained in charge of his left wing while Van Dorn took tactical control of the Confederate right wing. But more time was lost in reorganizing Price&#x27;s division to attack. Meanwhile, Curtis was rushing small units to Carr&#x27;s assistance as quickly as he could. Carr himself was wounded three times: in the ankle, neck and arm, but refused to leave the field. In 1894 he would be awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions this day.

About 4:30 p.m. Price&#x27;s left emerged from Williams Hollow and attacked, outflanking Carr&#x27;s line. On the right, Dodge&#x27;s brigade collapsed after putting up a terrific fight at Clemon&#x27;s farm. On the left, in equally hard fighting, Vandever&#x27;s men were steadily pushed back to the tavern and beyond. In the center, Little led his men forward into the teeth of Federal artillery. After being forced back from position after position, Vandever&#x27;s men finally halted the Confederate drive at Ruddick&#x27;s field, over a quarter mile south of the tavern. There they were joined by Dodge&#x27;s men, part of Alexander S. Asboth&#x27;s 2nd Division and Curtis. At 6:30 p.m., Curtis launched a brief counter-attack, but soon recalled his men in the dark.

==Battle, March 8==

===Night===
Temperatures fell rapidly after dark, making a very uncomfortable night for the men of both armies. Curtis called Davis&#x27; 3rd Division to Ruddick&#x27;s field during the night. When Davis arrived he was put in line to the left of Carr. Sigel marched the 1st and 2nd Divisions in circles all night but finally had them camp near Pratt&#x27;s Store. Asboth, who was wounded in the last action of the day, believed that the United States Army&#x27;s position was hopeless and pressed Curtis several times during the night to retreat. Though his army was now cut off from Missouri, Curtis refused to consider retreat and confidently predicted victory in the morning.

By a night march, a number of regiments and artillery batteries from McCulloch&#x27;s Division, led by Greer, reached Van Dorn via the Bentonville Detour and Cross Timber Hollow. Van Dorn was unaware that his supply train had been mistakenly ordered back to Camp Stephens during the previous afternoon and evening. In the morning, the Confederate reserve artillery ammunition would be hopelessly out of reach.

===Second day===

In the early morning, Sigel sent Osterhaus to scout the open prairie to the west of Elkhorn. The colonel discovered a knoll that promised to make an excellent artillery position and reported it to Sigel. Osterhaus also suggested that the 1st and 2nd Divisions simply march up the Telegraph Road and deploy on Davis&#x27; left, rather than retrace the route of the previous evening; Sigel agreed with his advice and his wing was put into motion. In the meantime, Davis ordered an Illinois battery to fire a few salvos into the woods opposite his position. This provoked a sharp Confederate reaction. Three Southern batteries opened fire, causing two Federal batteries to retreat and Davis to pull his men out of the open and back into the woods. This was followed by a Confederate probe which was quickly driven back.

Soon Sigel&#x27;s men extended in a long line to the left of Davis. By 8:00 a.m., Asboth&#x27;s division took its place on the far left, then came Osterhaus, Davis and Carr, with the Federal line generally facing north. It was possibly the only time during the war an entire army was visibly deployed in one continuous line of battle from flank to flank. Sigel now massed 21 cannons on the open knoll to the west of Elkhorn. With Sigel in personal control, the Federal artillery began an extremely effective fire against the 12 Southern guns opposed to them. When the Confederate gunners pulled back under the deadly fire, Van Dorn ordered two batteries to take their place. After one of the new batteries panicked and fled, Van Dorn put its commander under arrest. But the Southern commander was unable to counter Sigel&#x27;s devastating fire. Return fire from the Confederate artillery was ineffective and few Federals were killed.

With the opposing guns rendered nearly harmless, Sigel directed his gunners to fire into the woods at the Confederate infantry. Near the base of Big Mountain the projectiles created a deadly combination of rock shrapnel and wood splinters, driving the 2nd Missouri Brigade from its positions. &quot;It was one of the few times in the Civil War when a preparatory artillery barrage effectively softened up an enemy position and paved the way for an infantry assault.&quot; During the bombardment, Sigel&#x27;s infantry edged forward so that by 9:30 a.m. his divisions had executed a right wheel and faced to the northeast. By this time Van Dorn found that his reserve artillery ammunition was with the wagon train, a six-hour march away. The Southern commander bitterly realized that he had no hope of victory and decided to retreat via the Huntsville Road. This route led east from the tavern, then turned south. With Price wounded but still in command of the rear guard, Van Dorn&#x27;s army began to move toward the Huntsville Road in some confusion.
At 10:30 a.m., Sigel sent his two divisions forward into the attack. On the far left, Asboth&#x27;s regiments drove the 2nd Cherokee Mounted Rifles from the point of Big Mountain. Osterhaus was resisted by Little&#x27;s 1st Missouri Brigade. Soon, Curtis ordered Davis to attack in the center. Not realizing that the Confederate army was retreating past his right flank, Curtis held Carr&#x27;s mauled division in position on the right.

Van Dorn joined the retreat about 11:00 a.m. Sometime around noon, Sigel&#x27;s soldiers met Davis&#x27; men near Elkhorn Tavern and a great cry of &quot;Victory&quot; was sent up. A number of Southerners were cut off and escaped up the Wire Road into Cross Timber Hollow. From there the infantry retraced their steps on the Bentonville Detour. Several batteries marched northeast into Missouri then south through the Ozarks. In the confusion, Curtis failed to understand that Van Dorn had escaped on the Huntsville Road. Thinking that Van Dorn had retreated via Cross Timber Hollow, he sent Sigel and some cavalry to pursue in that direction. Instead of taking the forces Curtis assigned for the pursuit, Sigel gathered both of his divisions and marched northeast toward Keetsville, Missouri. Near there, he requested that Curtis send his supply train to that place. &quot;I am going forward not backward,&quot; remarked an annoyed Curtis to his staff. On March 9, Sigel finally returned to the battlefield and admitted that the Southern main body had not retreated by way of Missouri.

==Aftermath==

Federal forces reported 203 killed, 980 wounded and 201 missing for a total of 1,384 casualties. Of these, Carr&#x27;s 4th Division lost 682, almost all in its action on the first day, and Davis&#x27; 3rd Division lost 344. Both Asboth and Carr were wounded but remained in command of their divisions. Van Dorn reported his losses as 800 killed and wounded, with between 200 and 300 prisoners, but these are probably too low. A more recent estimate is that the Confederates suffered approximately 2,000 casualties in the Battle of Pea Ridge. These losses included a large proportion of senior officers. Generals McCulloch, McIntosh, and William Y. Slack were killed or mortally wounded, and Price wounded. Among colonels, Hébert was captured, and Benjamin Rives was mortally wounded, with two other colonels captured and one wounded.

Separated from their supply train, Van Dorn&#x27;s main body retreated through very sparsely settled country for a week, living off what little food they could take from the inhabitants. They finally reunited with their supply train south of the Boston Mountains, but thousands of Price&#x27;s troops deserted and returned to Missouri. Pike meanwhile, believing that the Confederate army had been destroyed, returned to the Indian Territory. Van Dorn refused to admit that he was defeated &quot;but only failed in my intentions&quot;. With the defeat at Pea Ridge, the Confederates never again seriously threatened the state of Missouri. Within weeks Van Dorn&#x27;s army was transferred across the Mississippi River to bolster the Confederate Army of Tennessee, leaving Arkansas virtually defenseless.

With his victory, Curtis sent some of his troops east of the Mississippi and proceeded with the remainder of his army to move east to West Plains, Missouri. Then he turned south into undefended northeast Arkansas. He had hopes of capturing Little Rock, but this proved impossible because of a lack of supplies and because guerrillas had cut his supply lines. Instead, following the approximate course of the White River, Curtis continued south and seized Helena, Arkansas, on July 12.

Curtis remained confident and exercised effective overall control of his outnumbered army through the two days of fighting. He was well served by three of his four division commanders, Osterhaus, Davis and Carr. His brigade commanders Dodge, Vandever and Greusel also performed well. Sigel&#x27;s generalship on the morning of March 8 was generally commended. However, his erratic behavior on other occasions and his attempt to claim credit for the victory led to a rift with Curtis. Sigel was soon transferred to a command in Virginia.

Van Dorn ignored logistics and failed to control his army. When McCulloch was killed, his division fell apart while Van Dorn absorbed himself in the tactical details of Price&#x27;s fight. His staff lost contact with his wagon train at a critical moment and committed many other errors. After the battle, &quot;Nobody was whipped at the Battle of Pea Ridge, but Van Dorn&quot; became a common saying among soldiers. Of all the Southern officers, Henry Little showed the most ability, becoming the &quot;de facto commander of Price&#x27;s division&quot; at the end of the battle.

==Battlefield preservation==

The battlefield at Pea Ridge is now Pea Ridge National Military Park, founded in 1956, one of the best-preserved civil war battlefields. A reconstruction of Elkhorn Tavern, scene of the heaviest fighting, stands at the original location. The park also includes a section of the Trail of Tears.

<doc id="299392" wikidata="Q78538" url="?curid=299392" title="Viktor Klima">
<text>Viktor Klima (born 4 June 1947) is an Austrian Social Democrat politician and businessman. He was chancellor of Austria from 1997 to 2000.

==Early career==

Born in Schwechat, Lower Austria, Klima started working for the then state-owned OMV oil company in 1969 and remained with the company up to the beginning of his political career in 1992, in his later years serving as a member of their management board.

==Minister==

Although Klima was then unknown to the majority of Austrians, in 1992 Chancellor Franz Vranitzky made him Minister of Transportation and Nationalised Industry, a position Klima held till 1996, when he became Finance Minister for a year.

==Chancellor of Austria==

In 1997, upon Vranitzky&#x27;s resignation, Klima was elected chairman of the Social Democratic party and was sworn in as Chancellor of Austria, having renewed the grand coalition between his own party (Social Democratic Party of Austria, SPÖ) and the Austrian People&#x27;s Party (ÖVP), with Wolfgang Schüssel serving as his vice chancellor.

Influenced by the &quot;Third Way&quot; strategy of other European leaders such as Tony Blair and Gerhard Schröder, under Klima&#x27;s chairmanship the Social Democrats played down their allegiance to Marxism and thus to their own political roots and very clearly continued their move from the political left towards the centre, frequently using spin doctors and embracing populism as a political strategy.

For example, further privatizations took place, and several public services that had been subsumed under the policies of the welfare state were tentatively reduced. As a consequence, a high percentage of the party&#x27;s traditional working-class constituency, dissatisfied with Klima and his party, redirected their support to Jörg Haider&#x27;s populist far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ). However, just as his predecessor Vranitzky, Klima repeatedly and publicly announced that under no circumstances was he prepared to enter into a coalition with Haider&#x27;s party.

Following the elections of October 1999, in which the Social Democrats sustained heavy losses, Viktor Klima stepped down as the chairman of his party and was succeeded in this capacity by Alfred Gusenbauer. As chancellor he was succeeded by Wolfgang Schüssel from the Austrian People&#x27;s Party, who formed a coalition government with the Freedom Party in February 2000.

Klima and his party heavily resented the fact that they were removed from rulership. While negotiations to form a new government on the basis of the October 1999 elections were ongoing, Klima &quot;urged fellow EU leaders to help influence the coalition bargaining,&quot; an unprecedented call for foreign interference in the political affairs of the sovereign Austrian state whose acting chancellor he still was at the time of this statement. While this failed to influence the outcome of the coalition talks, it led directly to the so-called &quot;sanctions&quot; against Austria, which had no basis whatsoever in the EU charter.

==Business career==
A few weeks later, with the help of his friend Gerhard Schröder, Klima took up a senior management position with Volkswagen in Argentina at a time when the country was in a deep economic crisis. Klima became General Manager of Volkswagen&#x27;s entire South American operations in mid-2006, and was under contract until 2011. Klima&#x27;s background in politics as well as in economy predestines him for networking, a capability he has continued to cultivate on the highest level, such as with Argentina&#x27;s former president, Néstor Kirchner and his predecessor, Eduardo Duhalde. Klima retired in 2011 and lives on a cattle farm near Buenos Aires.

<doc id="299395" wikidata="Q506796" url="?curid=299395" title="Big Mac">
<text>The Big Mac is a brand of hamburger sold by the international fast food restaurant chain McDonald&#x27;s. It was introduced by a Greater Pittsburgh area franchisee in 1967 and expanded nationwide in 1968, and is widely regarded as the company&#x27;s flagship product.

The hamburger features a three-slice sesame-seed bun containing two beef patties, one slice of cheese, shredded lettuce, pickles, minced onions, and a Thousand Island-type dressing advertised as &quot;special sauce.&quot; Seasonal and regional variants have been offered, including chicken versions.

The Big Mac is known worldwide and often used as a symbol of American capitalism and decadence. &quot;The Economist&quot; has used it as a reference point for comparing the cost of living in different countries – the Big Mac Index – as it is so widely available and is comparable across markets.

==History==
The Big Mac was created by Jim Delligatti, who stated later he did not invent the Big Mac but merely copied the double deck hamburger marketed by the Big Boy hamburger chain since the 1940s. Mr. Delligatti operated several McDonald&#x27;s restaurants in the Pittsburgh area. It was created in the kitchen of Delligatti&#x27;s first McDonald&#x27;s franchise, located on McKnight Road in suburban Ross Township.

The Big Mac debuted at the McDonald&#x27;s owned by Delligatti in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, on April 22, 1967, selling for .

It was designed to compete with Big Boy Restaurants&#x27; Big Boy hamburger. Eat&#x27;n Park was the Pittsburgh area&#x27;s Big Boy franchisee at the time. The Big Mac proved popular and it was added to the menu of all U.S. McDonald&#x27;s restaurants in 1968.

The Big Mac had two previous names, both of which failed in the marketplace: the Aristocrat and the Blue Ribbon Burger. The third name, Big Mac, was created by Esther Glickstein Rose, a 21-year-old advertising secretary who worked at McDonald&#x27;s corporate headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois.

==Product==
The Big Mac is made with two beef patties, a &quot;special sauce&quot; (similar to Thousand Island dressing), shredded iceberg lettuce, one processed American cheese slice, two slices of dill pickle, and minced onions, served on a three slice sesame seed bun. On October 1, 2018, McDonald&#x27;s announced that it would remove all artificial preservatives, flavors, and coloring from the Big Mac.

===Sauce===
Big Mac Sauce is delivered to McDonald&#x27;s restaurants in sealed canisters designed by Sealright, from which it is meant to be directly dispensed using a calibrated &quot;sauce gun&quot; that dispenses a specified amount of the sauce for each pull of the trigger.

In 2012, McDonald&#x27;s executive chef Dan Coudreaut released a YouTube video revealing the recipe of the sauce. It consists of store-bought mayonnaise, sweet pickle relish and yellow mustard whisked together with vinegar, garlic powder, onion powder and paprika.

In 2018, McDonald&#x27;s revamped the sauce by removing potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate, and calcium disodium EDTA.

The sauce is occasionally available for purchase on its own for a limited time. The first time was in 2015. A tube was available for purchase but only in restaurants in Australia. It was available again in 2020. A pot was available for purchase but only in restaurants in the UK and Ireland. In 2023 and early 2024 it was available in Hungary.

===Packaging===
The Big Mac, along with many other McDonald&#x27;s products, was first served in a collapsible cardboard container that was changed to a &quot;clamshell&quot; style, polystyrene foam container in the late 1970s. Polystyrene foam containers were phased out beginning in 1990, due to environmental concerns.

==Advertising==
===&quot;Two all-beef patties&quot; jingle===

In 1974 McDonald&#x27;s commissioned an advertising jingle which popularized the list of ingredients of the Big Mac: &quot;Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun.&quot;

In 2008, McDonald&#x27;s restaurants in Malaysia revived the slogan. The revival included the original prize of a free Big Mac if the customer was able to recite the slogan in under four seconds. It was released in May, along with the promotional &quot;Mega Mac&quot;, which had four beef patties instead of two.

===McDonaldland character===
McDonald&#x27;s began a television advertising campaign appealing to children in 1971 featuring a fantasy world populated by Ronald McDonald and various mascots promoting McDonald&#x27;s products. Some characters were also modeled in McDonald&#x27;s store playground equipment. The Big Mac was represented by Officer Big Mac, a Keystone Cops-style policeman with a giant Big Mac sandwich for a head. The characters were revised after a 1973 plagiarism lawsuit brought by television puppeteers Sid and Marty Krofft because of similarities to their &quot;H.R. Pufnstuf&quot; characters. A modified Officer Big Mac continued in the commercials until 1985.

===Hip-hop product placement===
In 2005, McDonald&#x27;s began offering product placement rewards to hip hop artists who namechecked the Big Mac in their music, giving US$5 to the artist for every time a song mentioning the hamburger was played on the radio.

===EU trademark revocation===
McDonald&#x27;s sued the Irish fast-food chain Supermac&#x27;s for trademark infringement and claimed the name would confuse consumers in European markets. On 11 January 2019, the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) ruled in Supermac&#x27;s favor in what has been called a &quot;David vs. Goliath&quot; victory. McDonald&#x27;s submitted a copy of the Wikipedia article about the Big Mac as part of its evidence, but the court found the Wikipedia page was not acceptable as &quot;independent evidence&quot;.

In 2023, the EUIPO Board of Appeal annulled the decision after McDonald&#x27;s filed 700 pages of additional evidence, despite objections.

Supermac&#x27;s responded by bringing the case to the European Court of Justice, which finally ruled in 2024 that McDonald&#x27;s had not proven use of the Big Mac trademark when it came to poultry products or operating restaurants. The ruling does not affect the trademark with respect to the Big Mac burger product.

==US sales==
In 2007, Danya Proud, a McDonald&#x27;s spokeswoman, said that in the United States alone, 560 million Big Macs are sold each year. This would mean that approximately 17 Big Macs are sold every second.

==Variants==
* The Mega Mac or Double Big Mac: four beef patties and an extra slice of cheese. Available in Australia, Canada, China, Egypt, Ireland, Japan, Malaysia, Taiwan (during promotional periods only), Turkey, Singapore, Pakistan, South Korea, Thailand, and United Kingdom. It was introduced to the United States in early 2020, but was discontinued shortly after McDonald&#x27;s streamlined menus during the COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="299399" wikidata="Q387745" url="?curid=299399" title="Kogi State">
<text>Kogi State is a state in the North Central region of Nigeria, bordered to the east by the states of Ekiti and Kwara, to the north by the Federal Capital Territory, to the northeast by Nasarawa State, to the northwest by Niger State, to the southwest by the states of Edo and Ondo, to the southeast by the states of Anambra and Enugu, and to the west by Benue State. It is the only state in Nigeria to border ten other states. Named for the Hausa word for river, the state was formed from parts of Benue State, Niger State, and Kwara State on 27 August 1991. The state is nicknamed the &quot;Confluence State&quot; as the confluence of the River Niger and the River Benue occurs next to its capital, Lokoja.

Of the 36 states of Nigeria, Kogi is the thirteenth largest in area and twentieth most populous with an estimated population of about 4.5 million as of 2016. Geographically, the state is within the tropical Guinean forest–savanna mosaic ecoregion. Important geographic features include the key rivers with the Niger flowing from the northwest and the Benue coming from the northeast before the two rivers meet in Kogi&#x27;s center and bisect the state southward.

Kogi State has been inhabited for years by various ethnic groups, including the Ebira, Gbagyi, Nupe (mainly the Bassa Nge, Kakanda, and Kupa subgroups), and Oko in the state&#x27;s centre; the Agatu, Basa-Komo, Idoma, Igala, and Igbo in the east; and the Yoruba (mainly the Okun, Ogori, Oworo, and Magongo subgroups) in the west. Kogi is also religiously diverse, with about equal percentages of Christians and Muslims along with a substantial minority of adherents of traditional ethnic religions.

In the pre-colonial period, the area that is now Kogi State was split up between various states with some states being tiny and village-based as others were part of larger empires like the Nupe Kingdom which held much of now-western Kogi State until the early 1800s when the Fulani jihad annexed the kingdom and placed the area under the Sokoto Caliphate while the eastern half of the modern state was the ancient Igala Kingdom. In the 1900s and 1910s, British expeditions occupied the area and incorporated them into the Northern Nigeria Protectorate with its capital as Lokoja until 1903. The protectorate later merged into British Nigeria before becoming independent as Nigeria in 1960. Originally, modern-day Kogi State was a part of the post-independence Northern Region until 1967 when the region was split and the area became part of the North-Western State, Kwara State, and Benue-Plateau State. After Benue-Plateau and the North-Western states were split in 1976, now-Kogi became a part of the new Benue and Niger states along with Kwara. Western Benue State, southeastern Kwara State, and far southern Niger State were broken off to form the new Kogi State.

Economically, Kogi State is largely based around agriculture, mainly of coffee, cashew, groundnut, cocoa, oil palm, and yam crops. Other key industries are crude oil extraction and the livestock herding of cattle, goats, and sheep. Kogi has the ninth highest Human Development Index and sixteenth highest GDP in the country.

<text>Gunnery sergeant (GySgt) is the seventh enlisted rank in the United States Marine Corps, above staff sergeant and below master sergeant and first sergeant, and is a senior non-commissioned officer (SNCO). It has a pay grade of E-7.

The gunnery sergeant insignia consists of two M1 Garands centered vertically between three chevrons and two rockers.

==Responsibilities==
Gunnery sergeants in infantry units typically serve in the billet of &quot;company gunnery sergeant&quot; or as the platoon sergeant of 23–69 Marines in a reconnaissance platoon or a crew-served weapons platoon (i.e., machine guns, mortars, assault weapons/rockets, and anti-tank missiles). In artillery batteries, gunnery sergeants serve as the &quot;battery gunnery sergeant&quot; in the headquarters section of the firing battery&#x27;s 94-member firing platoon. In tank and assault amphibian units gunnery sergeants may serve as a platoon sergeant of a 16-member platoon of four tanks or a 39-member platoon of 12 amphibious assault vehicles (AAVs), respectively. Tank and assault amphibian gunnery sergeants are also assigned as section leaders, in charge of either two tanks and 8 Marines or three AAVs and 9 Marines. Gunnery sergeants serving as platoon sergeants perform essentially the same duties as staff sergeant platoon sergeants, with the additional responsibility of supervising other staff non-commissioned officers (i.e., the gunnery/staff sergeants leading the organic sections of the platoon).

The company/battery gunnery sergeant serves as the unit&#x27;s operations chief and works with the executive officer to plan and coordinate unit training and operations. In combat, as a member of the unit&#x27;s command group, he/she serves as a tactical adviser to the commanding officer/battery commander regarding employment of the unit and assists in operating the command post or tactical operations center. In garrison, he/she is responsible to the company/battery commander for supervising and coordinating individual training for the enlisted members of the company or battery and may assist the company/battery first sergeant in the administration and non-tactical leadership of the unit and by supervising the property (logistics) NCO, advising the officers, mentoring subordinate ranking Marines, and performing other duties as assigned. The company/battery gunnery sergeant has been described as a &quot;hands on disciplinarian&quot;. An approximate former equivalent in the United States Army would have been &quot;field first sergeant&quot;.

Gunnery sergeants also serve as senior staff non-commissioned officers in military staff sections and headquarters and service companies and headquarters batteries at battalion/squadron, regiment/group, and division/wing headquarters levels. Typical gunnery sergeant billets in combat support companies and battalion, regiment, and division headquarters are: Personnel Administration Chief, Staff Secretary Personnel/Administration Clerk, Administration Assistance Chief, Division Reproduction NCO, Equal Opportunity Advisor, Human Affairs NCO, Career Planner, Intelligence Chief, Operations Chief, Operations Assistant, Watch Team NCOIC, Schools Coordinator, MAGTF Plans Chief, Cinematography Specialist, Logistics Chief, Embarkation Chief, Infantry Weapons Chief, Analyst and Review Fiscal Chief, Information Systems Maintenance Chief, Public Affairs Chief, Communications-Electronics Maintenance Section Chief, Radio Chief, Wire Chief, Motor Transport Chief, Battery Motor Transport Chief, Roadmaster, Assistant Roadmaster, Maintenance Chief, Assistant Maintenance Chief, Management Team Inspector, Engineer Equipment Chief, and Mess Manager.

In Command Element, Combat Logistics Element, and Aviation Combat Element organizations, gunnery sergeants serve in basically similar positions of responsibility, authority, and accountability as their Ground Combat Element counterparts, with perhaps slightly different titles, such as Division/Branch Chief/NCOIC or Department SNCOIC (Staff Non-Commissioned Officer-In-Charge) in the aircraft maintenance department of a Marine aircraft squadron. Non Fleet Marine Force (or other operating forces) assignments may include supervisory or staff positions in recruiting, drill instructor, Marine Security Guard, Naval ROTC instructor or service school instructor, and major/joint/combined headquarters commands.

==History and insignia==

The rank of gunnery sergeant in the Marine Corps was established by the Navy personnel act of March 3, 1899 () reflecting the duties of Marines in ship&#x27;s detachments. The original insignia was three chevrons point up with three straight &quot;ties&quot; with an insignia of a bursting bomb over a crossed rifle and naval gun. From 1904 to 1929 the insignia went to three stripes only over a bursting bomb on top of crossed rifles. In 1929, like the rank of first sergeant, two &quot;rockers&quot; were added beneath the stripes with the same insignia in the middle. In 1937 the middle insignia was dropped. The rank was replaced by technical sergeant in 1946 until restored in 1959, when the crossed rifles insignia were added to Marine chevrons.

==Qualifications==

The qualifications and selection of gunnery sergeants in the &quot;Old Corps&quot; was explained in congressional testimony in 1912:
The following qualifications are required for appointment to the rank of gunnery sergeant:

A candidate for appointment as gunnery sergeant in the United States Marine Corps should be sufficiently proficient in the drill regulations to thoroughly drill recruits and to drill the squad and company. They should be thoroughly conversant with the nomenclature of the rapid-fire and machine guns used in the naval service and be sufficiently acquainted with their drill to be able to act as gun captains and to instruct the enlisted in their duties at such guns. They should have knowledge of the kinds and quantities of ammunition used in those guns. They should have a thorough knowledge of the instructions pertaining to target practice. They should have sufficient knowledge of the system of accountability of the United States Marine Corps to take charge of and properly render the accounts of a guard aboard ship, and should be competent in all respects to perform the duties of a first sergeant in charge of a guard on ship to which no marine officer is attached; also a knowledge of the duties involved in the subsistence of Marines ordered on detached duty, as well as the duties of an officer in command of a part of a landing party on shore.

Gunnery sergeants are selected from the sergeants of the corps on account of superior intelligence, reliability, and mechanical knowledge. The grade was provided with the idea that they should be somewhat higher in standard than first sergeants; that their knowledge of ordnance and of gunnery should be such that they would be able to make minor repairs to guns—to supervise all work in connection with guns; to command detachments which were of such size as not to warrant a commissioned officer being assigned to them. They are at present in command of marine detachments at naval magazines; are performing duty as first sergeants of regularly organized companies at various posts; in connection with the repair of guns at various Marine Corps stations; in connection with the training of recruits; and, in general, performing duties that require the utmost reliability. For a number of years candidates for promotion to this grade were required to take a special course of instruction before receiving their warrants, but recently, because of the lack of first sergeants and the numerous small detachments organized, it has been necessary to detail many of them for duty as first sergeants. As soon as there are a sufficient number of first sergeants available, it is intended to reestablish the school and to give gunnery sergeants a thorough course of instruction prior to their permanent appointment to this grade, in order that they may be experts in all matters pertaining to the care and preservation of naval ordnance.
At the time of this congressional testimony there were 82 gunnery sergeants in the USMC.

==Culture==
Gunnery sergeants are commonly referred to by the informal abbreviation &quot;Gunny&quot; or &quot;Guns&quot;. These nicknames, which are usually regarded as titles of both esteem and camaraderie, are generally acceptable for use in all but formal and ceremonial situations. Use of the term by lower-ranking personnel, however, remains at the gunnery sergeant&#x27;s discretion.

<text>An echo chamber is a hollow enclosure used to produce reverberation, usually for recording purposes. A traditional echo chamber is covered in highly acoustically reflective surfaces. By using directional microphones pointed away from the speakers, echo capture is maximized. Some portions of the room can be moved to vary the room&#x27;s decay time. Nowadays, effects units are more widely used to create such effects, but echo chambers are still used today, such as the famous echo chambers at Capitol Studios.

In music, the use of acoustic echo and reverberation effects has taken many forms and dates back many hundreds of years. Sacred music of the Medieval and Renaissance periods relied heavily on the composers&#x27; extensive understanding and use of the complex natural reverberation and echoes inside churches and cathedrals. This early acoustical knowledge informed the design of opera houses and concert halls in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. Architects designed these to create internal reflections that would enhance and project sound from the stage in the days before electrical amplification. Sometimes echo effects are the unintentional side effect of the architectural or engineering design, such as for the Hamilton Mausoleum in Scotland, which has one of the longest reverberation times of any building.

==Electro-acoustic==
Developments in electronics in the early 20th century—specifically the invention of the amplifier and the microphone—led to the creation of the first artificial echo chambers, built for radio and recording studios. Until the 1950s, echo and reverberation were typically created by a combination of electrical and physical methods.

Acoustically speaking, the &quot;classic novel&quot; echo chamber creates echoes in the same way as they are created in churches or caves—they are all simply large, enclosed, empty spaces with floors and walls made of hard materials (such as polished stone or concrete) that reflect sound waves well. The basic purpose of such chambers is to add colour and depth to the original sound, and to simulate the rich natural reverberation that is a feature of large concert halls.

The development of artificial echo and reverberation chambers was important for sound recording because of the limitations of early recording systems. Except in the case of live performances, most commercially popular recordings are made in specially constructed studios. These rooms were both heavily insulated to exclude external noises and internally somewhat anechoic—that is, they were designed not to produce any internal echoes or sound reverberation.

Because virtually every sound in everyday life is a complex mixture of direct sound from the source and its echoes and reverberations, audiences naturally found the totally &#x27;dry&#x27; and reverberation-free sound of early recordings unappealing. Consequently, record producers and engineers quickly came up with an effective method of adding &quot;artificial&quot; echo and reverberation that experts could control with a remarkable degree of accuracy.

Producing echo and reverberation in this form of echo chamber is simple. A signal from the studio mixing desk—such as a voice or instrument—is fed to a large high-fidelity loudspeaker located at one end of the chamber. One or more microphones are placed along the length of the room, and these pick up both the sound from the speaker and its reflections off the walls of the chamber. The farther away from the loudspeaker, the more echo and reverberation the microphone(s) picks up, and the louder the reverberation becomes in relation to the source. The signal from the microphone line is then fed back to the mixing desk, where the echo/reverberation-enhanced sound can be blended with the original &#x27;dry&#x27; input.

An example of this physical effect can be heard on the 1978 David Bowie song &quot;Heroes&quot;, from the album of the same name. The song, produced by Tony Visconti, was recorded in the large concert hall in the Hansa recording studio in Berlin, and Visconti has since been much praised for the striking sound he achieved on Bowie&#x27;s vocals. Visconti placed three microphones at intervals along the length of the hall; one very close to Bowie, one halfway down the hall, and the third at the far end of the hall. During the recording, Bowie sang each verse progressively louder than the last, and as he increased volume in each verse, Visconti opened up each of the three microphones in turn, from closest to farthest. Thus, in the first verse, Bowie&#x27;s voice sounds close, warm, and present; by the end of the song, Visconti has mixed in a large amount of signal from all three microphones, giving Bowie&#x27;s voice a strikingly reverberant sound.

The original echo chamber at EMI&#x27;s Abbey Road Studios was improved by Clive Robinson, site foreman at the time of construction. His construction and engineering teams perfected the echo booth at Abbey Road Studios in London. It was one of the first studios in the world to be specially built for recording purposes when it was established in 1931; it remains in place and is a prime example of the early 20th-century electro-acoustic echo chamber.

Buildings such as churches, church halls, and ballrooms have often been chosen as recording sites for classical and other music because of their rich, natural echo and reverberation characteristics. Famous examples include Sir George Martin&#x27;s AIR Studios at Lyndhurst Hall in Belsize Park, London, a large, vaulted 19th-century building originally constructed as a church and missionary school. Montreal&#x27;s Church of St. Eustache is the favored recording venue of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra and many others and is much sought after for classical recordings because of its unique acoustic characteristics. The distinctive reverberation on the early hit records by Bill Haley &amp; His Comets was created by recording the band under the domed ceiling of Decca&#x27;s studio in New York City, located in a former ballroom called The Pythian Temple.

Some recording companies and many small independent labels could not afford large purpose-built echo chambers such as the Abbey Road Chamber, so enterprising producers and engineers often made use of any large reverberant space. Corridors, lift-wells, stairwells, and tiled bathrooms were all used as substitute echo chambers. Many famous soul music and R&amp;B music recordings released by the New York-based Atlantic Records feature echo and reverb effects produced by simply placing a speaker and microphone in the office bathroom—a process also used by Producer/Engineer Bruce Botnick while recording The Doors for their 1970 album &quot;L.A. Woman&quot;.

==Electronic echo machines==

In the 1950s and 1960s, the development of magnetic audio tape technology made it possible to duplicate physical echo and reverberation effects entirely electronically. The Watkins Copicat, designed and built by renowned British electronics engineer Charlie Watkins in the late 1950s, is typical of this kind of electronic delay device.

Tape echo units use an endless loop of magnetic tape, which is drawn across a series of recording and playback heads. When a signal from a voice or instrument is fed into the machine, it records the signal onto the tape loop as it passes over the record head. As the tape advances, the newly recorded signal is then picked up by a series of playback heads mounted in line with the record head. These play the sound back as the signal passes over each head in turn, creating the classic rippling or cascading echoes that are typical of tape echo units.

The number of playback heads determines the number of repeats, and the physical distance between each playback head determines the ratio of delay between each repeat of the sound (usually some fraction of a second). The actual length of the delay between each repeat can be varied by a pitch control that alters the speed of the tape loop across the heads.

Typically, the playback heads of tape echo machines are also connected to controls that allow the user to determine the volume of each echo relative to the original signal. Another control (sometimes called &quot;regeneration&quot;) allows the signal from the playback heads to be fed back into and variably mixed with the original input signal, creating a distinctive &quot;feedback&quot; effect that adds more and more noise to the loop with each repeat. If fully activated, this control ultimately produces a continuous feedback loop of pure noise. Roland manufactured various models of magnetic tape echo and reverb sound effect machines from 1973 until the introduction of digital sound effect machines.

A tape echo that has few repeats and a very short delay between each repeat is often referred to as a &quot;slapback&quot; echo. This distinctive sound is one of the key sonic characteristics of 1950s rock and roll and rockabilly, and can be heard on the classic mid-50s Sun Records recordings by Elvis Presley and others. This effect was a result of the unintentional combination of the recording and monitoring tape heads (physically located a few inches apart), which, on playback, created a gap that inadvertently produced the iconic &quot;slap-back&quot; effect.

===Digital echo===

With the advent of digital signal processing and other digital audio technologies, it has become possible to simulate almost every &quot;echo chamber&quot; effect by processing the signal digitally. Because digital devices are able to simulate an almost limitless variety of real reverberant spaces as well as replicate the classic tape-based echo effects, physical echo chambers fell into disuse. However, as noted above, naturally reverberant spaces such as churches continue to be used as recording venues for classical and other forms of acoustic music.
