<text>The United Kingdom was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1977 with the song &quot;Rock Bottom&quot;, written and performed by Lynsey de Paul and Mike Moran. The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final. In addition, the BBC was also the host broadcaster and staged the event at the Wembley Conference Centre in London, after winning the with the song &quot;Save Your Kisses for Me&quot; by Brotherhood of Man.

==Before Eurovision==
=== &quot;A Song for Europe 1977&quot; ===
On 9 March 1977, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) held at the New London Theatre the national final to select its entry, &quot;A Song for Europe 1977&quot;, presented by Terry Wogan. Minutes before the show went live, a strike by BBC cameramen was called, preventing the televised broadcast of the show. The contest went ahead and a few hours later, the audio was aired on BBC Radio 2.

Fourteen regional juries voted on the songs: Bristol, Bangor, Leeds, Norwich, Newcastle, Aberdeen, Birmingham, Manchester, Belfast, Cardiff, Plymouth, Glasgow, Southampton and London. The juries voted internally and then ranked the songs from 1–12, awarding 12 points to the song that received the highest number of votes, 11 points to the second, 10 to the third and so on down to 1 point for their least preferred song. The winning song was &quot;Rock Bottom&quot;, written, composed and performed by Lynsey de Paul and Mike Moran. The song says that when people are in a bad situation they should work to solve problems and not be pessimistic about tragedies. 

The Eurovision Song Contest 1977 was due to take place in Wembley on 2 April. Due to the cameramen&#x27;s industrial action that spread throughout the BBC, many live broadcasts were affected in the coming weeks and the Eurovision final was postponed. On 30 March the strike was resolved and the contest was rescheduled for 7 May.

==== Final ====


Lyn Paul had previously been a member of The New Seekers when they represented the UK at the Eurovision Song Contest 1972, finishing in 2nd place. The band &#x27;Beano&#x27; would return to the competition in &quot;A Song for Europe 1980&quot; with a change in name to &#x27;Scramble&#x27;. Nichola Martin and Ann Shirley were the two female members of the trio &#x27;Rags&#x27;. Both women became instrumental in the success of the &quot;Eurovision Song Contest 1981&quot; winners Bucks Fizz. Martin herself returned in &quot;A Song for Europe 1981&quot; with the group &#x27;Gem&#x27; (aka Paris); ironically going up against Bucks Fizz in the competition.

<doc id="300121" wikidata="Q137273" url="?curid=300121" title="Snowplough turn">
<text>The snowplough turn, snowplow turn, or wedge turn is a downhill skiing braking and turning technique. It is the first turn taught to beginners, but still is useful to advanced skiers on steep slopes.

== Technique ==
The front ski tips of the skis are together and the tails wide apart, with the knees rolled inwards slightly. By applying pressure against the snow with the inside edges of the skis speed is reduced, making turning in such a configuration and stopping completely possible. To turn, weight is shifted from the downhill, outside-of-the-turn ski to the uphill, inside-of-the-turn ski. As the turn is completed, the old uphill, inside ski then becomes the new downhill, outside ski. Successful completion of the technique in both directions leads to linked turns.

== Applications ==
In ski instruction, the snowplough is a primary building block of skiing proficiency. Under the Arlberg technique for teaching skiing, beginners start with the snowplough then proceed to Stem Christie and then the parallel turn as their skills improve. It may be thought of as the foundation for controlling individual skis. A ski coach can analyze the underlying abilities of expert skiers by watching them do a snowplow. Proficient skiers may apply the technique with a narrower angle between the skis as a &quot;wedge turn&quot;.

In ski mountaineering, the snowplough is recognized as an important way to come to a complete stop on steep slopes. On steep slopes, a wedge turn can also provide a safe way to transition through the fall-line.

<doc id="300126" wikidata="Q15038295" url="?curid=300126" title="William St Leger">
<text>Sir William St Leger (1586–1642) was an Anglo-Irish landowner, administrator and soldier, who began his military career in the Eighty Years&#x27; War against Habsburg Spain. He settled in Ireland in 1624, where he was MP for County Cork in two Irish parliaments and Lord President of Munster. During the Irish Rebellion of 1641, he played a leading part in suppressing the rising in Munster before dying in 1642.

== Personal details ==
William St Leger was born in August 1586, probably in County Cork, eldest son of Sir Warham St Leger (1560–1600) and his wife Elizabeth Rothe, for whom it was her third marriage. His great-grandfather Anthony St Leger (1496–1559), had served as Lord Deputy of Ireland from 1540 to 1548, whereas his father held a number of administrative positions in Munster before he was killed during the Nine Years&#x27; War in 1600.

While resident in Dordrecht during the Dutch War of Independence, he married Gertrude de Vries (1588–1624) in 1616; they had two children, William (1620-1644), killed fighting for the Royalists during the First English Civil War, and Elizabeth (1618–1685), who in 1635 married St Leger&#x27;s ward Murrough O&#x27;Brien, 1st Earl of Inchiquin. With his second wife Gertrude Heywood, he had another two children, John (1637–1692) and Barbara.

== Career ==
=== The Netherlands ===
Few details are known of St Leger&#x27;s career before 1607, when he killed a man in a duel and took refuge from the law with Hugh O&#x27;Neill, Earl of Tyrone, one of the leaders of the rebellion in which his father died. When O&#x27;Neill and his companions went into exile a few months later, St Leger accompanied them to Brussels in the Spanish Netherlands but as a Protestant refused to follow them into Spanish service. Although the 1609 Twelve Years&#x27; Truce had temporarily halted the Eighty Years War, he moved to the Dutch Republic and took up a military career. In May 1610, he was pardoned by for the murder by James I and appointed captain in Lord Cecil&#x27;s regiment, an English unit in Dutch service that fought in the War of the Jülich Succession, often viewed as the precursor of the Thirty Years War.

For many English officers in the Dutch States Army, local connections were seen as essential to secure promotion, which may have been a factor in St Leger&#x27;s marriage to Gertrude de Vries in 1616. Shortly after, he became part of the patronage network around George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, whose personal relationship with James I made him extremely powerful. With Buckingham&#x27;s support, St Leger was knighted in 1618 and awarded estates in Leinster, part of a policy of transferring lands from the Catholic Irish to Protestant settlers. After the truce ended in 1622, St Leger served under Sir Charles Morgan in the defence of Bergen op Zoom. In 1624, he was appointed agent for lands in Upper Ossory granted to Buckingham by James I.

In October 1625 he commanded a regiment during a failed attack on Cádiz; most of the landing force became drunk and St Leger claimed he &quot;had never seen men acting with such beastliness&quot;. Although Buckingham retained his influence at court following the succession of Charles I, the damage to his reputation was enhanced by an equally disastrous assault on Saint-Martin-de-Ré in 1627 which St Leger also helped organise. Buckingham&#x27;s assassination in August 1628 was greeted with widespread public rejoicing.

=== Ireland: 1627 to 1642 ===
In March 1627, St Leger joined the Privy Council of Ireland and succeeded Buckingham&#x27;s half-brother Sir Edward Villiers as President of Munster. Along with this position, he inherited Buckingham&#x27;s struggle for control of the province with his local rival Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork, and to counter this, St Leger became an ally of Thomas Wentworth when the latter was named Lord Deputy of Ireland in January 1632. In 1630, St Leger had proposed a new plantation scheme in County Tipperary, which was never implemented but aligned with Strafford&#x27;s long-term policy of expanding Protestant cultural and religious dominance in Ireland.

However, in the short term, Strafford was less concerned with religious issues and more focused on increasing royal income by reclaiming lands that rightfully belonged to the Crown and ending widespread corruption among government office holders. Both particularly impacted so-called New English settlers like Boyle, who were the primary beneficiaries of such practices and viewed Catholicism as an immediate threat to their positions. When St Leger was elected Member of Parliament for County Cork in the Irish Parliament of 1634–1635 where he backed Strafford&#x27;s policy of making limited concessions to the Catholic gentry in return for subsidies.

The first of the Bishops&#x27; Wars in 1639 ended with the Covenanters in control of Scotland, a defeat Charles I was determined to reverse. To help achieve this, in December 1639 Stafford called the 2nd Irish Parliament of King Charles I to approve funding for an Irish expeditionary force that would land in Western Scotland. St Leger was re-elected for County Cork to the Irish Parliament of 1640–1649. Under Strafford&#x27;s guidance, Parliament unanimously voted four subsidies of £45,000 to fund an Irish army of 9,000 for use against the Scots in the Second Bishops&#x27; War.

St Leger was appointed Sergeant Major with responsibility for training the new recruits, who were based in Carrickfergus ready for transport to Scotland or northern England. In July 1640, St Leger declared them ready for service but they remained in Ireland throughout the Second Bishops&#x27; War. The main impact was to deepen divisions between Strafford and his opponents in both the Irish and English Parliaments, which led to his trial and execution in May 1641.

An additional complication was what to do with the newly formed army, many of whom were Catholic and thus viewed with deep suspicion by the Protestant-dominated Dublin Castle administration. It was eventually agreed they could take service with Spain and when the Irish Rebellion began in October 1641, around 2,500 men under Garret Barry were waiting in Kinsale for shipment to the Army of Flanders.

As Lord President, St Leger was responsible for dealing with the insurgents in Munster, but the forces and supplies placed at his disposal were inadequate. In February 1942 he was reinforced by the arrival at Youghal of Charles Vavasour and his regiment. He also brought St Leger the royal declaration of 1 January 1642 in which the King denounced the rebels. St Leger was still struggling with the insurrection when he died on 2 July 1642, either at Doneraile Court or at Cork.

== Reputation ==
His reputation in the minds of Irish nationalist historians is that he executed martial law in his province with the greatest severity, hanging large numbers of rebels, often without much proof of guilt. In 1843, Daniel O&#x27;Connell quoted him as saying about the harsh policy adopted by the government in Dublin: &quot;The undue promulgation of that severe determination to extirpate the Irish and papacy out of the kingdom, your Lordship rightly apprehends to be too unseasonably published.&quot; in such sense that he approved of the policy of extirpation. O&#x27;Connell went on &quot;This St. Leger was himself one of the chief extirpators&quot;.

<doc id="300127" wikidata="Q459405" url="?curid=300127" title="Year 2038 problem">
<text>The year 2038 problem (also known as Y2038, Y2K38, Y2K38 superbug or the Epochalypse) is a time computing problem that leaves some computer systems unable to represent times after 03:14:07 UTC on 19 January 2038.

The problem exists in systems which measure Unix time—the number of seconds elapsed since the &quot;Unix epoch&quot; (00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970)—and store it in a signed 32-bit integer. The data type is only capable of representing integers between −(2) and 231 − 1, meaning the latest time that can be properly encoded is 2 − 1 seconds after epoch (03:14:07 UTC on 19 January 2038). Attempting to increment to the following second (03:14:08) will cause the integer to overflow, setting its value to −(2) which systems will interpret as 2 seconds &quot;before&quot; epoch (20:45:52 UTC on 13 December 1901). The problem is similar in nature to the year 2000 problem, the difference being the Year 2000 problem had to do with base 10 numbers, whereas the Year 2038 problem involves base 2 numbers.

Analogous storage constraints will be reached in 2106, where systems storing Unix time as an &quot;unsigned&quot; (rather than signed) 32-bit integer will overflow on 7 February 2106 at 06:28:15 UTC.

Computer systems that use time for critical computations may encounter fatal errors if the year 2038 problem is not addressed. Some applications that use future dates have already encountered the bug. The most vulnerable systems are those which are infrequently or never updated, such as legacy and embedded systems. Modern systems and software updates to legacy systems address this problem by using signed 64-bit integers instead of 32-bit integers, which will take 292 billion years to overflow—approximately 21 times the estimated age of the universe.

== Cause ==
Many computer systems measure time and date using Unix time, an international standard for digital timekeeping. Unix time is defined as the number of seconds elapsed since 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970 (an arbitrarily chosen time based on the creation of the first Unix system), which has been dubbed the &quot;Unix epoch&quot;. 

Unix time has historically been encoded as a signed 32-bit integer, a data type composed of 32 binary digits (bits) which represent an integer value, with &#x27;signed&#x27; meaning that the number can represent both positive and negative numbers, as well as zero; and is usually stored in two&#x27;s complement format. Thus, a signed 32-bit integer can only represent integer values from −(2) to 231 − 1 inclusive. Consequently, if a signed 32-bit integer is used to store Unix time, the latest time that can be stored is 231 − 1 (2,147,483,647) seconds after epoch, which is . Systems that attempt to increment this value by one more second to 2 seconds after epoch (03:14:08) will suffer integer overflow, inadvertently flipping the sign bit to indicate a negative number. This changes the integer value to −(2), or 2 seconds &quot;before&quot; epoch rather than &quot;after&quot;, which systems will interpret as 20:45:52 on Friday, 13 December 1901. From here, systems will continue to count up, toward zero, and then up through the positive integers again. As many computer systems use time computations to run critical functions, the bug may introduce serious problems.

== Vulnerable systems ==
Any system using data structures with signed 32-bit time representations has an inherent risk of failing. A full list of these data structures is virtually impossible to derive, but there are well-known data structures that have the Unix time problem:
* File systems that use 32 bits to represent times in inodes
* Databases with 32-bit time fields
* Database query languages (such as SQL) that have codice_1-like commands

=== Embedded systems ===
Embedded systems that use dates for either computation or diagnostic logging are most likely to be affected by the Y2038 problem. Despite the modern 18–24 month generational update in computer systems technology, embedded systems are designed to last the lifetime of the machine in which they are a component. It is conceivable that some of these systems may still be in use in 2038. It may be impractical or, in some cases, impossible to upgrade the software running these systems, ultimately requiring replacement if the 32-bit limitations are to be corrected.

Many transportation systems from flight to automobiles use embedded systems extensively. In automotive systems, this may include anti-lock braking system (ABS), electronic stability control (ESC/ESP), traction control (TCS) and automatic four-wheel drive; aircraft may use inertial guidance systems and GPS receivers. Another major use of embedded systems is in communications devices, including cell phones and Internet-enabled appliances (e.g. routers, wireless access points, IP cameras) which rely on storing an accurate time and date and are increasingly based on Unix-like operating systems. For example, the Y2038 problem makes some devices running 32-bit Android crash and not restart when the time is changed to that date.

However, this does not imply that all embedded systems will suffer from the Y2038 problem, since many such systems do not require access to dates. For those that do, those systems which only track the difference between times/dates and not absolute times/dates will, by the nature of the calculation, not experience a major problem. This is the case for automotive diagnostics based on legislated standards such as CARB (California Air Resources Board).

== Early problems ==
In May 2006, reports surfaced of an early manifestation of the Y2038 problem in the AOLserver software. The software was designed with a kludge to handle a database request that should &quot;never&quot; time out. Rather than specifically handling this special case, the initial design simply specified an arbitrary time-out date in the future with a default configuration specifying that requests should time out after a maximum of one billion seconds. However, one billion seconds before the 2038 cutoff date is 01:27:28 UTC on 13 May 2006, so requests sent after this time would result in a time-out date which is beyond the cutoff. This made time-out calculations overflow and return dates that were actually in the past, causing software to crash. When the problem was discovered, AOLServer operators had to edit the configuration file and set the time-out to a lower value.

== Solutions ==
There is no universal solution for the Year 2038 problem. For example, in the C language, any change to the definition of the codice_2 data type would result in code-compatibility problems in any application in which date and time representations are dependent on the nature of the signed 32-bit codice_3 integer. Changing codice_3 to an unsigned 32-bit integer, which would extend the range to 2106 (specifically, 06:28:15 UTC on Sunday, 7 February 2106), would adversely affect programs that store, retrieve, or manipulate dates prior to 1970, as such dates are represented by negative numbers. Increasing the size of the codice_3 type to 64 bits in an existing system would cause incompatible changes to the layout of structures and the binary interface of functions.

Most operating systems designed to run on 64-bit hardware already use signed 64-bit codice_3 integers. Using a signed 64-bit value introduces a new wraparound date that is over twenty times greater than the estimated age of the universe: approximately 292 billion years from now. The ability to make computations on dates is limited by the fact that codice_7 uses a signed 32-bit integer value starting at 1900 for the year. This limits the year to a maximum of 2,147,485,547 (2,147,483,647 + 1900).

Alternative proposals have been made (some of which are already in use), such as storing either milliseconds or microseconds since an epoch (typically either 1 January 1970 or 1 January 2000) in a signed 64-bit integer, providing a minimum range of 292,000 years at microsecond resolution. In particular, Java&#x27;s and JavaScript&#x27;s use of 64-bit signed integers to represent absolute timestamps as &quot;milliseconds since 1 January 1970&quot; will work correctly for the next . Other proposals for new time representations provide different precisions, ranges, and sizes (almost always wider than 32 bits), as well as solving other related problems, such as the handling of leap seconds. In particular, TAI64 is an implementation of the International Atomic Time (TAI) standard, the current international real-time standard for defining a second and frame of reference.

=== Implemented solutions ===
* Starting with Ruby version 1.9.2 (released on 18 August 2010), the bug with year 2038 is fixed, by storing time in a signed 64-bit integer on systems with 32-bit codice_3.
* Starting with NetBSD version 6.0 (released in October 2012), the NetBSD operating system uses a 64-bit codice_3 for both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. Applications that were compiled for an older NetBSD release with 32-bit codice_3 are supported via a binary compatibility layer, but such older applications will still suffer from the Y2038 problem.
* OpenBSD since version 5.5, released in May 2014, also uses a 64-bit codice_3 for both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. In contrast to NetBSD, there is no binary compatibility layer. Therefore, applications expecting a 32-bit codice_3 and applications using anything different from codice_3 to store time values may break.
* Linux originally used a 64-bit codice_3 for 64-bit architectures only; the pure 32-bit ABI was not changed due to backward compatibility. Starting with version 5.6 of 2020, 64-bit codice_3 is supported on 32-bit architectures, too. This was done primarily for the sake of embedded Linux systems.
* GNU C Library since version 2.34 (released August 2021), added support for using 64-bit codice_3 on 32-bit platforms with appropriate Linux versions. This support can be activated by defining preprocessor macro codice_17 to codice_18 when compiling source code.
* FreeBSD uses 64-bit codice_3 for all 32-bit and 64-bit architectures except 32-bit i386, which uses signed 32-bit codice_3 instead.
* The x32 ABI for Linux (which defines an environment for programs with 32-bit addresses but running the processor in 64-bit mode) uses a 64-bit codice_3. Since it was a new environment, there was no need for special compatibility precautions.
* Network File System version 4 has defined its time fields as codice_22 since December 2000. Version 3 supports unsigned 32-bit values as codice_23. Values greater than zero for the seconds field denote dates after the 0-hour, January 1, 1970. Values less than zero for the seconds field denote dates before the 0-hour, January 1, 1970. In both cases, the nseconds (nanoseconds) field is to be added to the seconds field for the final time representation.
* The ext4 filesystem, when used with inode sizes larger than 128 bytes, has an extra 32-bit field per timestamp, of which 30 bits are used for the nanoseconds part of the timestamp, and the other 2 bits are used to extend the timestamp range to the year 2446.
* The XFS filesystem, starting with Linux 5.10, has an optional &quot;big timestamps&quot; feature which extends the timestamp range to the year 2486.
* While the native APIs of OpenVMS can support timestamps up to 31 July 31086, the C runtime library (CRTL) uses 32-bit integers for codice_3. As part of Y2K compliance work that was carried out in 1998, the CRTL was modified to use unsigned 32-bit integers to represent time; extending the range of codice_3 up to 7 February 2106.
* PostgreSQL since version 7.2, released 2002-02-04, stores timestamp WITHOUT TIMEZONE as 64-bit. Prior versions already stored timestamp as 64-bit.
* As of MySQL 8.0.28, released in January 2022, the functions codice_26, codice_1, and codice_28 handle 64-bit values on platforms that support them. This includes 64-bit versions of Linux, macOS, and Windows. In older versions, built-in functions like codice_1 will return 0 after 03:14:07 UTC on 19 January 2038.
* As of MariaDB 11.5.1, released in May 2024, the data type codice_30 and functions codice_26, codice_1, and codice_28 handle unsigned 32-bit values on 64-bit versions of Linux, macOS, and Windows. This extended the range to 2106-02-07 06:28:15 and allowed users to store such timestamp values in tables without changing the storage layout and thus staying fully compatible with existing user data.
* Starting with Visual C++ 2005, the CRT uses a 64-bit codice_3 unless the codice_35 preprocessor macro is defined. However, the Windows API itself is unaffected by the year 2038 bug, as Windows internally tracks time as the number of 100-nanosecond intervals since 1 January 1601 in a 64-bit signed integer, which will not overflow until year 30,828.

<text>The stem christie or wedge christie, is a type of skiing turn that originated in the mid-1800s in Norway and lasted until the late 1960s. It comprises three steps: 1) forming a wedge by rotating the tail of one ski outwards at an angle to the direction of movement, initiating a change in direction opposite to the stemmed ski, 2) bringing the other ski parallel to the wedged ski, and 3) completing the turn with both skis parallel as they carve an arc, sliding sideways together.

==History==
The stem Christiana was developed by Sondre Norheim in the mid-1800s. Norheim was a Norwegian skier and inventor whose innovations included early ski heel bindings that facilitated turning and jumping, and method for turning that included the basic stem, the Christiana, stem Christiana and parallel turns. The term derives from turns employed by Norwegian jumpers in Oslo, Norway—then called &quot;Christiania&quot;—which was later shortened to &quot;christie&quot;.

This specific type of turn was promoted in the first decade of the 1900s by Austrian ski guide Hannes Schneider as the mainstay of the Arlberg technique, which he called the &quot;Alpine System&quot;. Schneider&#x27;s name is so attached to the turn that he is sometimes identified as its inventor, but he used it to replace the Telemark turn as the standard for descending on skis. 

The technique was widely used until the late 1960s, when its use diminished in favor of the parallel turn, another form of turning on skis introduced by Norheim, alongside new ideas for sidecuts (to what had earlier been parallel inside and outside ski edges). Skis with increasingly parabolic sidecuts accelerated the obsolescence of the stem christie, starting in the late 1990s, because of their improved turning characteristics over skis with minimal sidecut.

<doc id="300135" wikidata="Q11158661" url="?curid=300135" title="Laetiporus">
<text>Laetiporus is a genus of edible mushrooms found throughout much of the world. Some species, especially &quot;Laetiporus sulphureus&quot;, are commonly known as sulphur shelf, chicken of the woods, the chicken mushroom, or the chicken fungus because it is often described as tasting like and having a texture similar to that of chicken meat.

==Description==
Individual &quot;shelves&quot; range from across. These shelves are made up of many tiny tubular filaments (hyphae). The mushroom grows in large brackets; some have been found that weigh over 45 kilograms (100 pounds).

Young fruiting bodies are characterized by a moist, rubbery, sulphur-yellow to orange body sometimes with bright orange tips. Older brackets become pale and brittle almost chalk-like, mildly pungent, and are often dotted with beetle or slug/woodlouse holes.

The name &quot;chicken of the woods&quot; is not to be confused with another edible polypore, &quot;Maitake&quot; (&quot;Grifola frondosa&quot;) known as &quot;hen of the woods/rams head” or with &quot;Lyophyllum decastes&quot;, known as the &quot;fried chicken mushroom&quot;.

==Taxonomy==

=== Phylogeny ===
Phylogenetic analyses of ITS, nuclear large subunit and mitochondrial small subunit rDNA sequences from a variety of North American species have delineated five distinct clades within the core &quot;Laetiporus&quot; clade:
*Conifericola clade: contains species that live on conifers, such as &quot;L. conifericola&quot; and &quot;L. huroniensis&quot;. All of the other tested species grow on angiosperms.
*Cincinnatus clade: contains &quot;L. cincinnatus.&quot;
*Sulphureus clade I: contains white-pored &quot;L. sulphureus&quot; isolates.
*Sulphureus clade II: contains yellow-pored &quot;L. sulphureus&quot; isolates.
*Gilbertsonii clade: contains &quot;L. gilbertsonii&quot; and unidentified Caribbean isolates.

In addition, phylogenetic clades have been identified from Japan, Hawaii, South America, Europe, and South Africa.

*&quot;Laetiporus squalidus&quot; 
*&quot;Laetiporus sulphureus&quot; 
*&quot;Laetiporus versisporus&quot; 
*&quot;Laetiporus zonatus&quot; 

=== Etymology ===
The name &quot;Laetiporus&quot; means &quot;with bright pores&quot;.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The sulphur shelf mushroom is most commonly found on wounds of trees, mostly oak, though it is also frequently found on eucalyptus, yew, sweet chestnut, and willow, as well as conifers in some species. &quot;Laetiporus&quot; species are parasitic and produce brown rot in the host on which they grow.

It sometimes comes back year after year when the weather suits its sporulation preferences. From late spring to early autumn, the sulphur shelf thrives. This fungus causes a brown cubical rot and embrittlement which in later stages ends in the collapse of the host tree, as it can no longer flex and bend in the wind.

Chicken of the woods is found growing on or at the base of dead or dying hardwood trees; most commonly on oak but also cherry or beech. It can also be found on dead conifer stumps. Chicken of the woods has been known to fruit on living trees as well. It typically grows from spring to early autumn.

==Uses==
The mushroom can be prepared in most ways that one can prepare chicken meat. It can also be used as a substitute for chicken in a vegetarian diet. Additionally, it can be frozen for long periods of time and retain its edibility. In certain parts of Germany and North America, it is considered a delicacy.

In some cases eating the mushroom &quot;causes mild reactions ... for example, &quot;swollen lips&quot; or in rare cases &quot;nausea, vomiting, dizziness and disorientation&quot; to those who are sensitive. This is believed to be due to a number of factors that include allergies to the mushroom&#x27;s protein or toxins which are only somewhat stable at high temperatures. As such, many field guides request that those who eat &quot;Laetiporus&quot; exercise caution by only eating fresh, young brackets and begin with small quantities to see how well it sits in their stomach.

&quot;L. sulphureus&quot; has a potent ability to inhibit staph bacteria (&quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;), as well as moderate ability to inhibit the growth of &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot;.

<text>The New Saints of Oswestry Town &amp; Llansantffraid Football Club, commonly known as The New Saints () or TNS FC, are a Welsh professional football club that play in the , but are based completely within England, in Oswestry, Shropshire. They are the most successful club in the Welsh league structure, with 16 league titles to their name. Since the 2001–02 season, they have finished as champions or runners-up in every season, apart from 2008–09, where they finished third in the league. They became the first side playing in the Welsh league system to qualify for the group or league stage of any European competition after reaching the league phase of the UEFA Conference League for the first time in the 2024–25 season.

== History ==

=== Llansantffraid F.C. ===
The club was formed as Llansantffraid F.C. to represent the border village of Llansantffraid-ym-Mechain (population: 1,000) in 1959, and played at the Recreation Ground.

They first tasted competitive football in the Montgomeryshire Amateur Football League (then the fourth level of the Welsh football league system), winning the championship seven times. At the end of the 1989–90 season they were elected to the Central Wales League (now the Mid-Wales League) but their stay was brief, winning promotion to the Cymru Alliance as runners-up on their first attempt. Llansantffraid&#x27;s meteoric rise continued and in 1992–93 they gained promotion to the League of Wales, now the Cymru Premier, as champions and won the Welsh Intermediate Cup (formerly the Welsh Amateur Cup).

=== Total Network Solutions ===
In 1996, Llansantffraid won the Welsh Cup and qualified for the first time for the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. At this time, a local computer company, Total Network Solutions of Oswestry, arranged a £250,000 sponsorship deal which involved incorporating the company name into the club name. As Total Network Solutions Llansantffraid, they met Polish Cup winners Ruch Chorzów and earned a 1–1 draw at home before losing 5–0 in Poland. Since then they have qualified for European competitions several times. The club&#x27;s European home games are generally played at either Newtown&#x27;s or Wrexham&#x27;s stadium, as their old Recreation Ground was far below UEFA&#x27;s standards (though for their 2003 meeting with Manchester City, they played their home game at the 72,000-seat Millennium Stadium in Cardiff). To comply with UEFA&#x27;s regulations on third-party sponsorship, the club were known by their initialism TNS by the European governing body in their competitions.

In 1997 the club&#x27;s name was changed to Total Network Solutions F.C., being the first instance in the United Kingdom of a football club renaming itself after its sponsor&#x27;s name only. Following the financial meltdown of Barry Town in the summer of 2003, TNS became the only Cymru Premier club which had a full-time playing staff. In the summer of 2005, however, Llanelli also announced plans to go full-time.

=== Merger with Oswestry Town ===
In the summer of 2003, the shareholders of Oswestry Town met to approve a merger with TNS. The financially weaker club was a close neighbour to TNS, and also played in the League of Wales despite being based across the border in Shropshire. The Football Association of Wales (FAW) ratified the merger on 14 August 2003 as did UEFA eventually, despite its initial objection to a merger of two clubs with different governing bodies.

The 2003–04 season was trophyless for TNS as they finished runners-up in the League of Wales to Rhyl and were beaten finalists in the Welsh Cup, also to Rhyl. The 2004–05 season proved much more successful, as TNS won a League and Cup double.

During the 2005–06 off-season, after newly crowned Champions League winners Liverpool were initially denied a place in the next season&#x27;s competition, TNS offered to play a one-legged tie against the Reds for TNS&#x27;s place in the first qualifying round. After UEFA reached a compromise by which Liverpool were placed in the first qualifying round of the competition, TNS and Liverpool ended up drawn against one another anyway. Liverpool won the first leg at Anfield 3–0 thanks to a Steven Gerrard hat-trick. In the second leg, played at Wrexham, Gerrard added two goals after coming on as a substitute to Djibril Cissé&#x27;s opening tally for another 3–0 Liverpool victory. Although defeated, TNS drew praise, most notably for the young Northern Irish goalkeeper Gerard Doherty, of whom Rafael Benítez said: &quot;The goalkeeper saved a lot of goals and for me he was the best player in the two games&quot;.

=== The New Saints F.C. ===
In early 2006 the club&#x27;s sponsor, Total Network Solutions, was taken over by British Telecom, as a result of which the sponsorship arrangement lapsed at the end of the 2005–06 season, and it became necessary to find a new name for the club. After a trawl for new naming ideas, including an attempt to sell the naming rights on eBay, the name &quot;The New Saints&quot; was agreed upon as appropriate to the history of both of the originally merged clubs: Llansantffraid was always known as &quot;The Saints&quot;; Oswestry had strong connections with Saint Oswald, while the club&#x27;s name was already abbreviated to TNS. A new club badge was also developed at the same time, featuring a dragon to represent Llansantffraid and a lion representing Oswestry.

On 10 February 2010, the BBC reported that the New Saints had applied to play home games at Chester City&#x27;s Deva Stadium in 2010–11, after having been turned down for a grant to help fund the construction of a new 1,000-seat stand at Park Hall. At the time, the mooted move was complicated by Chester City&#x27;s governance issues. Deva Stadium&#x27;s pitch and stands lie in Wales, but outbuildings on the site that housed the club offices are in England, and Chester City were under the jurisdiction of the English Football Association. Chester City were liquidated a month later by HMRC; in any event, the New Saints were granted a domestic licence by the FAW in April 2010 and remained at Park Hall for 2010–11 season. The New Saints were crowned 2009–10 Welsh Premier League Champions.

The New Saints entered the Champions League in 2010–11. They were drawn against League of Ireland Premier Division Champions Bohemians in the Second Qualifying Round. They lost the first leg 1–0 at Dalymount Park in Dublin on 13 July 2010. However, they won the second leg at Park Hall 4–0 and won the tie 4–1 on aggregate, the first ever tie won by the club since their European debut in 1996. Bohemians manager Pat Fenlon later labelled his team&#x27;s performance as &quot;disgraceful&quot; and said that &quot;the players let the club, league and country down&quot;. The result was labelled by others as the worst result in Bohemians&#x27; 40-year European history. The Saints advanced to play Belgian Pro League Champions and European giants Anderlecht. The Saints were beaten 3–1 in the home leg played in Wrexham and 3–0 in the away game at the Constant Vanden Stock Stadium in Brussels. The Saints then played CSKA Sofia in the Europa League playoff round, but were beaten 5–2 on aggregate. As league runners up during the 2010–11 season, the Saints entered the Europa League qualifying rounds in 2011. They beat Belfast club Cliftonville 2–1 on aggregate in the first round, but were eliminated by Danish club FC Midtjylland 8–3 on aggregate in the following round.

On 30 December 2016, The New Saints defeated Cefn Druids 2–0 in the Cymru Premier. This extended their winning run to 27 matches, surpassing the previous record of 26 set by Ajax in the 1970s for the most consecutive club victories by a top-flight team in Europe.

The New Saints qualified to the 2024–25 UEFA Conference League following a 3–0 win on aggregate over Panevėžys in the playoffs on 29 August 2024, becoming the first club from the Welsh league system to qualify for the group stage of a major UEFA competition. The New Saints were forced to play their home matches at Shrewsbury Town&#x27;s New Meadow stadium due to Park Hall not meeting UEFA&#x27;s regulations for hosting non-qualification matches. The New Saints faced Fiorentina in their first European group stage match on 3 October and were defeated 2–0. On 24 October, The New Saints became the first domestic Welsh club to win in the group stage of a major European competition, courtesy of a 2–0 victory over FC Astana at New Meadow.

== Futsal ==
The club&#x27;s futsal side has also seen success, having been winners of the inaugural FAW Futsal Cup in 2011 and reaching the final in 2012.

== Women&#x27;s football ==
The New Saints Ladies FC was founded in 2002 and played in the FA Women&#x27;s National League Midlands Division 1. In August 2020, it was announced that the women&#x27;s section was splitting off and adopting the name Wem Town L.F.C. The new club claimed that women&#x27;s football was low on TNS&#x27; list of priorities.

In June 2021, The New Saints F.C. Women were refounded and were granted a license to play in the Adran Premier, ahead of established top-flight clubs such as Abergavenny Town and Briton Ferry Llansawel. They continue to participate in the Adran Premier League, the highest tier of league competition in Welsh women&#x27;s football, and also play their home games at Park Hall Stadium. 

In the 2022–23 season, they finished in 4th place. The team became semi-professional with the 2024–25 season, the fourth such team in the Adran Premier. In that season they won their first silverware, beating Swansea 3 - 1 in the Adran Trophy final at Latham Park.

<doc id="300141" wikidata="Q137075" url="?curid=300141" title="Parallel turn">
<text>The parallel turn in alpine skiing is a method for turning which rolls the ski onto one edge, allowing it to bend into an arc. Thus bent, the ski follows the turn without sliding. It contrasts with earlier techniques such as the stem Christie, which slides the ski outward from the body (&quot;stemming&quot;) to generate sideways force. Parallel turns generate much less friction and are more efficient both in maintaining speed and minimizing skier effort.

The parallel turn was invented in the 1930s by Austrian ski racer Anton Seelos from Seefeld in Tirol.

Parallel turns require solid contact from the skier&#x27;s lower leg to the ski to rotate it on-edge. This was difficult to achieve with early ski equipment, limiting the technique to the high performance realm of racing. The introduction of composite skis, metal edges, releasable clamping bindings, and stiff plastic boots combined to allow parallel turns even on beginner equipment. By the late 1960s it rapidly replaced stemming for all but very short-radius turns. The evolution of shaped skis in the 1990s advanced the carving turn to preeminence. 

Today parallel turns are taught to teach novice skiers the effect of weighting and unweighting their skis. They are still the basic technique for steep hills, off piste and mogul skiing.

==Basic action==
The parallel turn relies on two dynamics: releasing the edge hold by reducing the angle between ski and snow surface which makes the front of the ski skid downhill (skidding inwards) and then applying a force to change the edge and make the ski turn across the line of greatest slope (skidding outwards).

The skier initiates the turn by moving their knees or the whole body laterally in the direction of the desired turn. The motion of knees is translated through the calf to the high cuffs on the ski boots, to the bindings, and then to the skis. This reduces the edge hold and causes the skis to rotate on their edges, with the skier&#x27;s weight and the force they put upon them to change the edge of the skis which turns them across the line of greatest slope. To stop the turn the knee or the body is rotated back to the neutral position until the edge holds and the skidding stops. While both skis take part, in practice the ski on the outside of the turn is dominant.

Moving the legs to the side shifts the center of gravity, compensated for by moving the hips in the opposite direction. The effect is to keep the skier&#x27;s upper body upright while the lower torso and legs shift side-to-side. The skier pressures the front of their skis to keep the fore-and-aft center of gravity of the skier&#x27;s mass over their toes.

The parallel turn can be improved through dynamic &quot;weighting&quot;. Turns are often linked in a series of continual arcs, one direction then the other. Lifting the body through the middle of the switch partially releases the skis arcs, easing the transition to the opposite direction.

==Changing the technique==
In the 1990s skis were progressively widened at the tips and tails relative to the waist. Applying an edge of these &quot;shaped&quot; or &quot;parabolic&quot; skis brings a curved surface to the snow, resulting in a carve turn.

* An excellent film of the classic parallel technique can be found in . Note that the skier&#x27;s upper body remains pointed down the fall line, and their body moves only a small amount from side to side. Turns are initiated at the tip, and skidding progressively develops—note the amount of snow being thrown off the back of the ski as the turn develops. The skis can be seen to bend into arcs, but these are relatively modest. This is a very different technique from the modern carving turn, where the skis and skier move through smooth arcs.</text><links>

<text>Annette Lu Hsiu-lien (; born 7 June 1944) is a Taiwanese politician and lawyer. A feminist active in the tangwai movement, she joined the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in 1990, and was elected to the Legislative Yuan in 1992. Subsequently, she served as Taoyuan County Magistrate between 1997 and 2000, and was vice president of the Republic of China (Taiwan) from 2000 to 2008, under President Chen Shui-bian.

Before entering politics, Lu graduated from National Taiwan University and earned law degrees from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and from Harvard University. She announced her intentions to run for the presidency on 6 March 2007, but withdrew to support eventual DPP nominee Frank Hsieh. Lu ran again in 2012, but withdrew for a second time, ceding the nomination to DPP chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen. 

Lu lost the DPP&#x27;s Taipei mayoral nomination to Pasuya Yao in 2018, and stated that she would leave the party. However, by the time Lu announced in September 2019 that she would contest the 2020 presidential election on behalf of the Formosa Alliance, she was still a member of the Democratic Progressive Party.

==Early life and education==
Lu was born in Tōen Town (now Taoyuan City), in northern Taiwan, during Japanese rule. She has both Hoklo and Hakka ancestry, with her paternal ancestor arriving in Taiwan from Nanjing County, Zhangzhou, Fujian in 1740. She has one older brother and three older sisters.

After graduating from Taipei First Girls&#x27; High School, Lu studied law at the National Taiwan University (NTU). After graduating from NTU in 1967, she earned two Master of Laws (LL.M.) degrees: one from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign in comparative law in 1971, and another from Harvard Law School, where she was a student of Jerome Cohen, in 1978. As a graduate student at Harvard, Lu was classmates with future Taiwanese president Ma Ying-jeou. 

==Rise in politics==

During the 1970s, Lu established herself as a prominent feminist advocate in Taiwan, which included writing of &quot;New Feminism&quot; or &quot;Xin Nüxing Zhuyi&quot; (). She renounced her KMT membership, joined the tangwai movement, and worked in the staff of &quot;Formosa Magazine&quot;. Lu then became increasingly active in the movement, calling for democracy and an end to authoritarian rule.

In 1979, Lu delivered a 20-minute speech criticizing the government at an International Human Rights Day rally that later became known as the Kaohsiung Incident. Following this rally, virtually the entire leadership of Taiwan&#x27;s democracy movement, including Lu, was imprisoned. She was tried, found guilty of violent sedition, and sentenced by a military court to 12 years in prison. She was named by Amnesty International as a prisoner of conscience, and, due to international pressure, coupled with the work of Ma Ying-jeou and Jerome A. Cohen, was released in 1985, after approximately five and a half years in jail.

In the 1990s, Lu worked to have Taiwan reenter the United Nations, not under the name &quot;Republic of China&quot; but as &quot;Taiwan&quot;.

===Elected offices===
Lu joined the Democratic Progressive Party in November 1990, and was elected to the Legislative Yuan in 1992. In 1997, she won an election to be the Magistrate of her hometown of Taoyuan, a post she held until Chen Shui-bian selected her as his running mate in the 2000 presidential elections.

==Novel==
Lu completed her novel entitled &quot;These Three Women&quot; while in prison. To evade the surveillance of the detention facility, she wrote part of the novel on toilet paper using a washbasin as a desk. In 2008, the novel was adapted into a screenplay for TV drama of the same name. The drama was broadcast on 24 November 2008 on the Chinese Television System.

==Vice Presidency, 2000–2008==

On 18 March 2000, Lu was elected vice president. She was awarded the World Peace Corps Mission&#x27;s World Peace Prize in 2001. Controversy erupted over this in Taiwan, with Lu&#x27;s political opponents accusing her of vastly overstating the significance and value of that award. She was also the ROC&#x27;s first elected vice president to adopt a Western first name. In her interview with &quot;TIME Asia Magazine&quot;, she said the KMT never thought they would transfer their regime to her on behalf of the freedom fighters.

Lu was a contender for the 2008 presidential election; she announced her candidacy on March 6 and faced Yu Shyi-kun, Frank Hsieh, and Su Tseng-chang for the nomination. After receiving only 6.16% of the votes cast in the DPP primary, Lu withdrew from the race.

===Assassination attempt===
On 19 March 2004, Lu was shot in the right kneecap while campaigning in Tainan. Chen was shot in the abdomen at the same event. Both survived the shooting and left Chi-mei Hospital on the same day. The Pan-Blue Coalition suggested that the shooting was not an assassination attempt but that it was staged to a self-inflicted wound in order to gain sympathy votes. The Chen/Lu ticket won the election on the following day with a 0.228% margin, a figure significant to those who related it to the assassination incident.

==Later political career==

Lu announced in March 2018 that she would contest the Democratic Progressive Party mayoral primary for Taipei. Soon after the DPP nominated Pasuya Yao as its candidate, Lu stated her intention to leave the party.

She remained a DPP member through 2019, and announced in September 2019 that she would contest the 2020 presidential election on behalf of the Formosa Alliance, with Peng Pai-hsien as her running mate. On 2 November 2019, Lu suspended her presidential campaign.

==Cross-strait relations==

In terms of Cross-Strait relations with China, Lu has been more outspoken in favor of Taiwan independence than President Chen Shui-bian, and as such has been more heavily attacked than Chen both by the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and by supporters of Chinese unification. Her remarks have led state newspapers in mainland China to accuse her of provoking &quot;animosity between the people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits&quot;. PRC state media has also labeled Lu as &quot;insane&quot; and as &quot;scum of the earth&quot;.

In 2010 Lu visited South Korea and advocated Taiwan&#x27;s use of what she called &quot;soft power,&quot; meaning peaceful economic and political development, as a model for the resolution of international conflicts. In mid-April 2013 speaking at George Washington University, Lu called for the DPP to better understand Mainland China, because Taiwan&#x27;s future depends on development on the mainland. She stated that cross-strait relations should be defined as not only between distant relatives, but between near neighbors. She also stressed that there should be neither hatred nor war between Taiwan and Mainland China, and that both sides should pursue peaceful coexistence, industrial cooperation, and cultural exchanges.

Speaking at the founding ceremony of Anti-One China Principle Union in Taipei on 29 April 2013, Lu warned against silent annexation of Taiwan by China since the introduction of Anti-Secession Law in 2005 and the gradual erosion of Taiwan&#x27;s sovereignty. However, she said Taiwan is not opposed to one China existing in the world, just that Taiwan is not part of China. She criticized ROC President Ma Ying-jeou for making Taiwan more and more dependent on China. She reiterated her 1996 Consensus (in opposition to the Kuomintang&#x27;s 1992 Consensus) for dealing with the PRC, in which she said Taiwan has been an independent sovereign country since the 1996 ROC presidential election.

==Corruption charges and acquittal==

On September 21, 2007, Lu, along with DPP chairman Yu Shyi-Kun and National Security Office secretary-general Mark Chen, were separately indicted on charges of corruption by the Supreme Prosecutor&#x27;s Office of Taiwan. Lu was accused of embezzlement and special fund abuse of about US$165,000. On July 2, 2012, all three were acquitted of all charges.

<text>Alhamdulillah (, &quot;&quot;) is an Arabic phrase meaning &quot;praise be to God&quot;, sometimes translated as &quot;thank God&quot; or &quot;thanks be to the Lord&quot;. This phrase is called &quot;Tahmid&quot; (). A longer variant of the phrase is &quot;al-ḥamdu l-illāhi rabbi l-ʿālamīn&quot; (), meaning &quot;all praise is due to God, Lord of all the worlds&quot;, the first verse of Surah Al-Fatiha, the opening chapter of the Quran.

The phrase is frequently used by Muslims of every background due to its centrality in the texts of the Quran and Hadith, the words of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Its meaning and in-depth explanation have been the subject of much exegesis. It is also commonly used by non-Muslim speakers of the Arabic language.

A similar variation used in Christianity is the phrase &quot;Hallelujah&quot;.

==Meaning==
The phrase has three basic parts:
*&quot;al-&quot;, the definite article, &quot;the&quot;.
*&quot;ḥamd&quot;(&quot;u&quot;), literally meaning &quot;praise&quot;, &quot;commendation&quot;.
*&quot;li-llāh&quot;(&quot;i&quot;), preposition + noun &quot;Allāh&quot;. &quot;Li-&quot; is a dative preposition meaning &quot;to&quot;. The word &quot;Allāh&quot; () is the proper name of the God of Abraham. &quot;Al ilah&quot; means &quot;The God&quot;, and it is a contraction of the definite article &quot;al-&quot; and the word &quot;ʾilāh&quot; (, &quot;god, deity&quot;). As in English, the article is used here to single out the noun as being the only one of its kind, &quot;the God&quot; (the one and only) or &quot;God&quot;. Therefore, &quot;Allāh&quot; is the Arabic word for &quot;God&quot;. &quot;ʾilāh&quot; is the Arabic cognate of the ancient Semitic name for God, El.

The phrase is first found in the first verse of the first sura of the Qur&#x27;an (Al-Fatiha). So frequently do Muslims and Arabic-speaking Jews and Christians invoke this phrase that the quadriliteral verb &quot;hamdala&quot; (), &quot;to say al-ḥamdu li-llāh&quot; was coined, and the derived noun &quot;ḥamdala&quot; is used as a name for this phrase.

The triconsonantal root Ḥ-M-D (), meaning &quot;praise&quot;, can also be found in the names Muhammad, Mahmud, Hamid and Ahmad, among others.

==Translation==
English translations of &quot;alhamdulillah&quot; include: 
* &quot;all praise is due to God alone&quot; (Muhammad Asad)
* &quot;all the praises and thanks be to God&quot; (Muhammad Muhsin Khan)
* &quot;praise be to God&quot; (Abdullah Yusuf Ali, Marmaduke Pickthall)
* &quot;all praise is due to God&quot; (Saheeh International)

==Variants==
Various Islamic phrases include the Tahmid, most commonly:

<doc id="300150" wikidata="Q284959" url="?curid=300150" title="4-Aminobenzoic acid">
<text>4-Aminobenzoic acid (also known as &quot;para&quot;-aminobenzoic acid or PABA because the two functional groups are attached to the benzene ring across from one another in the &quot;para&quot; position) is an organic compound with the formula H2NC6H4CO2H. PABA is a white crystalline solid, although commercial samples can appear gray. It is slightly soluble in water. It consists of a benzene ring substituted with amino and carboxyl groups. The compound occurs extensively in the natural world.

==Production and occurrence==
In industry, PABA is prepared mainly by two routes:
* Reduction of 4-nitrobenzoic acid 
* Hoffman degradation of the monoamide derived from terephthalic acid.

Food sources of PABA include liver, brewer&#x27;s yeast (and unfiltered beer), kidney, molasses, mushrooms, and whole grains. Other food sources of PABA include spinach, liver, and oat seeds.

==Biology==

===Biochemistry===

PABA is an intermediate in the synthesis of folate by bacteria, plants, and fungi.
Many bacteria, including those found in the human intestinal tract such as &quot;E. coli&quot;, generate PABA from chorismate by the combined action of the enzymes 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate synthase and 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate lyase. Plants produce PABA in their chloroplasts, and store it as a glucose ester (&quot;p&quot;ABA-Glc) in their tissues. Humans lack the enzymes to convert PABA to folate and so require folate from dietary sources, such as green leafy vegetables. In humans, PABA is considered nonessential and, although it has been referred to historically as &quot;vitamin Bx&quot;, is no longer recognized as a vitamin because the typical human gut microbiome generates PABA on its own.

Sulfonamide drugs are structurally similar to PABA, and their antibacterial activity is due to their ability to interfere with the conversion of PABA to folate by the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. Thus, bacterial growth is limited through folate deficiency.

===Medical use===
The potassium salt is used as a drug against fibrotic skin disorders, such as Peyronie&#x27;s disease, under the brand name Potaba. PABA is also occasionally used in pill form by sufferers of irritable bowel syndrome to treat its associated gastrointestinal symptoms, and in nutritional epidemiological studies to assess the completeness of 24-hour urine collection for the determination of urinary sodium, potassium, or nitrogen levels. PABA derivatives have also been proposed to function as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in diseases that cause deficient cholinergic systems, such as Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease.

===Nutritional supplement===
Despite the lack of any recognized syndromes of PABA deficiency in humans, except for those who lack the colonic bacteria that generate PABA, many claims of benefit are made by commercial suppliers of PABA as a nutritional supplement. The benefit is claimed for fatigue, irritability, depression, weeping eczema (moist eczema), scleroderma (premature hardening of the skin), patchy pigment loss in the skin (vitiligo), and premature grey hair.

==Commercial and industrial use==
PABA finds use in the biomedical sector. Its derivatives are found as a structural component in 1.5% of a database of 12111 commercial drugs. Other uses include its conversion to specialty azo dyes and crosslinking agents. PABA is also used as a biodegradable pesticide, though its use is now limited due to evolution of new variants of bio-pesticides. Specifically, studies have shown that PABA photodegrades through an O-mediated pathway in which PABA is oxidized by O via hydrogen abstraction and decarboxylation.

In the past, PABA was widely used in sunscreens as a UV filter. It is a UVB absorber, meaning it can absorb wavelengths between 290 and 320 nm. while still allowing UVA wavelengths between 320-400 nm to pass through, producing a tan. The chemical structure of PABA, with the amino and carboxyl groups being &quot;para&quot; to each other, allows for easy electron delocalization, which reduces the gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). This makes it easier for the electrons in PABA to transition to a higher energy state upon absorbing light. 
Patented in 1943, PABA was one of the first active ingredients to be used in sunscreen. The first &quot;in vivo&quot; studies on mice showed that PABA reduced UV damage. In addition, it was shown to protect against skin tumors in rodents, as shown by a 1975 study ran by Dr. Diane Sekura Snyder and Dr. Marian May. 
However, animal and &quot;in vitro&quot; studies in the early 1980s suggested PABA might increase the risk of cellular UV damage. On the basis of these studies, as well as problems with allergies and clothing discoloration, PABA fell out of favor as a sunscreen. In 2008 it was banned as a sunscreen ingredient in the European Union and in 2019 the FDA proposed its limited use. However, water-insoluble PABA derivatives such as padimate O are currently used in some cosmetic products including mascara, concealer, and matte lipsticks.

As of 2008, the advancement of new sunscreen is focused on developing a broad spectrum of active ingredients that provide consistent protection across all wavelengths, including UVA. Researchers are considering the PABA–TiO2 Hybrid Nanostructures that result from the method of aqueous in situ synthesis with PABA and TiO2.

==Safety considerations==
PABA is largely nontoxic; the median lethal dose of PABA in dogs (oral) is 2 g/kg. Allergic reactions, specifically Allergic Contact Dermatitis and Photocontact Dermatitis, to PABA can occur. It is formed in the metabolism of certain ester local anesthetics, and many allergic reactions to local anesthetics are the result of reactions to PABA.

<text>Abergavenny Thursdays Football Club was a Welsh football team based in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire. The club was founded in 1927 though several defunct clubs had existed in the town since the mid 19th century. It won the Welsh Football League title on two occasions in the late 1950s where it gained a reputation as one of the strongest teams competing in the Welsh leagues. The Thursdays won its last two titles prior to the founding of the League of Wales in 1992.

As a founder member of the new League of Wales, they competed in the Division&#x27;s inaugural season. Financial issues at the start of the campaign led to an exodus of players and staff and the club suffered relegation after finishing bottom of the table. The club entered a decline in the ensuing years that saw it suffer seven relegations in ten seasons, ending its playing days playing in the Gwent County League Division 3. It withdrew from the league in August 2013 after agreeing with local side Govilon FC to merge and form a new club Abergavenny Town FC. The ground Penypound Stadium is run and maintained by the Thursday&#x27;s Trust, thus preserving the history of the club.

==History==
Records show that organised football was started in Abergavenny during the 1890s with the founding of Abergavenny Rangers. The team later became known as Abergavenny Rangers Thursdays before dropping Rangers from its name altogether in 1908. The Thursdays, who were unconnected to the first team formed in the town, were founded in 1927. The club&#x27;s name derived from the fact that many Welsh towns gave workers a half-day on Thursdays, leading to the founding of many social clubs due to the free time.

The club won promotion to the top tier of the Welsh Football League in 1951. They won the Welsh Football League Cup in 1952 after defeating Caerau Athletic in the final. Eight years after entering Division One, the club won its first Welsh Football League title during the 1958–59 season, finishing 15 points clear of second placed side Cardiff City reserves after winning 28 of their 36 league matches. They retained the title the following year. They also reached the semi-final of the Welsh Cup during their second title winning season, the furthest the club ever advanced in the competition, suffering a defeat to Wrexham in a replay.

Thursdays&#x27; strong performances in the Welsh leagues led to an invitation to join the Southern Football League, part of the English football league system. The club eventually declined the offer in the hope of a Welsh national league being formed, an idea put forward by Llanelli after their request to join the Southern League was declined by the Football Association of Wales (FAW). Although there was strong support in the north of Wales for the idea, southern clubs playing in the English league system, such as Merthyr Tydfil and Barry Town, believed that the standard of competition was too low and resisted the move leading to its collapse. Several of the Thursdays&#x27; players during this era went on to join English Football League sides after performing well for the club, including Brian Evans and Danny McCarthy.

In the 1960s, the team remained in the top tier and finished as runners-up on three consecutive occasions between 1963 and 1965, losing out to Swansea Town reserves each time. Thursdays reached their second Welsh Football League Cup final in 1963 but suffered a defeat to Brecon Corinthians. They suffered consecutive relegations at the start of the 1970s, dropping into Division Two and did not return to the top tier of Welsh football until 1988.

===League of Wales and decline===
Success returned to the club in the 1990–91 season, when the club won the Welsh Football League for the first time in 31 years, and they retained the title a year later. As such, they became one of the founding members of the
League of Wales, a new national division which promised European football for the highest-placed teams. However, prior to the start of the inaugural season, the club was required to provide a bond to the FAW as security to ensure that floodlights would be installed in time for the start of the campaign. Although Thursdays obliged, the money put a considerable strain on the club&#x27;s financial resources and the ensuing huncertainty as to whether the club would be competing in the League of Wales led to a mass exodus of players, as well as the resignation of manager Ray Warren and coach John Lewis. Kyle Holmes, one of the few senior players who remained, was appointed player-manager in their place and quickly assembled a team in preparation for the start of the season. They suffered a 1–0 defeat against Bangor City on the opening day of the season before securing their first point a week later with a 1–1 draw with Porthmadog. However, Thursdays ended the first season of the League of Wales with relegation after finishing in last place.

Thursdays dropped to Division One of the Welsh Football League and finished 14th in their first campaign. Their second year brought some positive results back to the club after they finished fourth but another mass exodus of players followed and hope of a return to the League of Wales were soon forgotten. After low placed finishes in the following two seasons, Thursdays suffered a disastrous campaign in the 1997–98 season, failing to win any of their 36 league matches and conceding 210 goals which led to relegation to Division Two. After finishing 12th in their first season, the club entered a severe decline in which they suffered four successive relegations, dropping from Division Two of the Welsh Football League to Division Three of the regional Gwent County League, during which they conceded 675 goals. Their final relegation season, saw the club collect only two points in the Division Two of the Gwent County League as they failed to win a game.

In 2004, a supporter&#x27;s trust, named The Thursdays Trust, was founded with the intention of taking over control of the club in an effort to stabilise its financial future. The trust included former manager Kyle Holmes and several former players. The trust took over ownership of the club and renovated several areas of the ground. Tentative approaches were made over a potential merger between the Thursdays and local side Mardy in 2006 but were eventually dismissed. The club&#x27;s last 11 seasons were spent in the Third Division of the Gwent County League. In August 2013, Thursdays withdrew from the Gwent County League days before they were due to play Pontypool in their opening match of the 2013–14 season, citing a lack of players. The problem had been a longstanding issue within the local area and the Thursdays had struggled for consistent levels for a number of seasons.

Within a year of the old club&#x27;s demise, a new club was formed to represent the town of Abergavenny – Abergavenny Town F.C.

<text>tomsrtbt (pronounced: Tom&#x27;s Root Boot) is a very small Linux distribution. It is short for &quot;Tom&#x27;s floppy which has a root filesystem and is also bootable.&quot; Its author, Tom Oehser, touts it as &quot;The most GNU/Linux on one floppy disk&quot;, containing many common Linux command-line tools useful for system recovery (Linux and other operating systems.) It also features drivers for many types of hardware, and network connectivity.

It could be created from within Linux or earlier versions of Windows running in MS-DOS mode, either by formatting a standard 1.44MB floppy disk as a higher density 1.722MB disk and writing the tomsrtbt image to the disk, or by burning it as a bootable CD. It is capable of reading and writing the filesystems of many operating systems of its era, including ext2/ext3 (used in Linux), FAT (used by DOS and Windows), NTFS (used in Windows NT, 2000, and XP) and Minix (used by the Minix operating system).

Windows NT and most later versions of Windows, including 2000, XP, and Vista, cannot create a tomsrtbt floppy as their floppy driver does not allow the extended format.

A few of the utilities on tomsrtbt are written in the Lua programming language, and many more use BusyBox. Space saving compiler options were used throughout, the kernel was patched to support loading an image compressed with Bzip2, and in many cases older or alternate versions of programs were selected due to their smaller size.

<text>William A. Nolen (March 20, 1928 – December 20, 1986) was a surgeon and author who resided in Litchfield, Minnesota. He wrote a syndicated medical advice column that appeared in &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot; magazine for many years, and was the author of several books. He died on December 20, 1986, at the University of Minnesota Medical Center, from heart disease.

==Career==

Nolen&#x27;s best-known book is &quot;The Making of a Surgeon&quot;, which continues to be a popular (though now dated) narrative about his experiences as an intern and resident surgeon-in-training at Bellevue Hospital in New York City. Many students contemplating medical school find that it guides their decision.

Nolen conducted research at a 1967 Kathryn Kuhlman fellowship in Philadelphia, with 23 people who claimed to have been cured during her services. Nolen&#x27;s long-term follow-ups concluded there were no cures in those cases. Furthermore, &quot;one woman who was said to have been cured of spinal cancer threw away her brace and ran across the stage at Kuhlman&#x27;s command; her spine collapsed the next day, according to Nolen, and she died four months later.&quot;

Nolen is also known for his book &quot;Healing: A Doctor in Search of a Miracle&quot; (1974). He spent two years examining faith healers and concluded that no patients with organic disease had been cured. He investigated psychic surgery and discovered it was based on sleight of hand trickery. He uncovered many cases of fraud.

<text>Sagas are prose stories and histories, composed in Iceland and to a lesser extent elsewhere in Scandinavia.

The most famous saga-genre is the (sagas concerning Icelanders), which feature Viking voyages, migration to Iceland, and feuds between Icelandic families. However, sagas&#x27; subject matter is diverse, including pre-Christian Scandinavian legends; saints and bishops both from Scandinavia and elsewhere; Scandinavian kings and contemporary Icelandic politics; and chivalric romances either translated from Continental European languages or composed locally.

Sagas originated in the Middle Ages, but continued to be composed in the ensuing centuries. Whereas the dominant language of history-writing in medieval Europe was Latin, sagas were composed in the vernacular: Old Norse and its later descendants, primarily Icelandic.

While sagas are written in prose, they share some similarities with epic poetry, and often include stanzas or whole poems in alliterative verse embedded in the text.

== Etymology and meaning of &quot;saga&quot; ==
The main meanings of the Old Norse word &quot;saga&quot; (plural &quot;sǫgur&quot;) are &#x27;what is said, utterance, oral account, notification&#x27; and the sense used in this article: &#x27;(structured) narrative, story (about somebody)&#x27;. It is cognate with the English words &quot;say&quot; and &quot;&quot; (in the sense &#x27;a saying&#x27;, as in &quot;old saw&quot;), and the German &quot;Sage&quot;; but the modern English term &quot;saga&quot; was borrowed directly into English from Old Norse by scholars in the eighteenth century to refer to Old Norse prose narratives.

The word continues to be used in this sense in the modern Scandinavian languages: Icelandic (plural ), Faroese &quot;&quot; (plural &quot;søgur&quot;), Norwegian &quot;&quot; (plural &quot;soger&quot;), Danish &quot;saga&quot; (plural &quot;sagaer&quot;), and Swedish &quot;saga&quot; (plural &quot;sagor&quot;). It usually also has wider meanings such as &#x27;history&#x27;, &#x27;tale&#x27;, and &#x27;story&#x27;. It can also be used of a genre of novels telling stories spanning multiple generations, or to refer to saga-inspired fantasy fiction. Swedish &quot;&quot; means folk tale or fairy tale, while &quot;konstsaga&quot; is the Swedish term for a fairy tale by a known author, such as Hans Christian Andersen. In Swedish historiography, the term &quot;sagokung&quot;, &quot;saga king&quot;, is intended to be ambiguous, as it describes the semi-legendary kings of Sweden, who are known only from unreliable sources.

== Genres ==

Norse sagas are generally classified as follows.

=== Kings&#x27; sagas ===
Kings&#x27; sagas (&quot;konungasögur&quot;) are of the lives of Scandinavian kings. They were composed in the twelfth to fourteenth centuries. A pre-eminent example is &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, probably compiled and composed by Snorri Sturluson. These sagas frequently quote verse, invariably occasional and praise poetry in the form of skaldic verse.

=== Sagas of Icelanders and short tales of Icelanders ===
The Icelanders&#x27; sagas (&quot;Íslendingasögur&quot;), sometimes also called &quot;family sagas&quot; in English, are purportedly (and sometimes actually) stories of real events, which usually take place from around the settlement of Iceland in the 870s to the generation or two following the conversion of Iceland to Christianity in 1000. They are noted for frequently exhibiting a realistic style. It seems that stories from these times were passed on in oral form until they eventually were recorded in writing as &quot;Íslendingasögur&quot;, whose form was influenced both by these oral stories and by literary models in both Old Norse and other languages. The majority — perhaps two thirds of the medieval corpus — seem to have been composed in the thirteenth century, with the remainder in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. These sagas usually span multiple generations and often feature everyday people (e.g. &quot;Bandamanna saga&quot;) and larger-than-life characters (e.g. &quot;Egils saga&quot;). Key works of this genre have been viewed in modern scholarship as the highest-quality saga-writing. While primarily set in Iceland, the sagas follow their characters&#x27; adventures abroad, for example in other Nordic countries, the British Isles, northern France and North America. Some well-known examples include &quot;Njáls saga&quot;, &quot;Laxdæla saga&quot; and &quot;Grettis saga&quot;.

The material of the short tales of Icelanders (&quot;þættir&quot; or &quot;Íslendingaþættir&quot;) is similar to &quot;Íslendinga sögur&quot;, in shorter form, often preserved as episodes about Icelanders in the kings&#x27; sagas.

Like kings&#x27; sagas, when sagas of Icelanders quote verse, as they often do, it is almost invariably skaldic verse.

=== Contemporary sagas ===
Contemporary sagas (&quot;samtíðarsögur&quot; or &quot;samtímasögur&quot;) are set in twelfth- and thirteenth-century Iceland, and were written soon after the events they describe. Most are preserved in the compilation &quot;Sturlunga saga&quot;, from around 1270–80, though some, such as &quot;Arons saga Hjörleifssonar&quot; are preserved separately. The verse quoted in contemporary sagas is skaldic verse.

According to historian Jón Viðar Sigurðsson, &quot;Scholars generally agree that the contemporary sagas are rather reliable sources, based on the short time between the events and the recording of the sagas, normally twenty to seventy years... The main argument for this view on the reliability of these sources is that the audience would have noticed if the saga authors were slandering and not faithfully portraying the past.&quot;

=== Legendary sagas ===

Legendary sagas (&quot;fornaldarsögur&quot;) blend remote history, set on the Continent before the settlement of Iceland, with myth or legend. Their aim is usually to offer a lively narrative and entertainment. They often portray Scandinavia&#x27;s pagan past as a proud and heroic history. Some legendary sagas quote verse — particularly &quot;Vǫlsunga saga&quot; and &quot;Heiðreks saga&quot; — and when they do it is invariably Eddaic verse.

Some legendary sagas overlap generically with the next category, chivalric sagas.

=== Chivalric sagas ===
Chivalric sagas (&quot;riddarasögur&quot;) are translations of Latin pseudo-historical works and French chansons de geste as well as Icelandic compositions in the same style. Norse translations of Continental romances seem to have begun in the first half of the thirteenth century; Icelandic writers seem to have begun producing their own romances in the late thirteenth century, with production peaking in the fourteenth century and continuing into the nineteenth.

While often translated from verse, sagas in this genre almost never quote verse, and when they do it is often unusual in form: for example, &quot;Jarlmanns saga ok Hermanns&quot; contains the first recorded quotation of a refrain from an Icelandic dance-song, and a metrically irregular riddle in &quot;Þjalar-Jóns saga&quot;.

=== Saints&#x27; and bishops&#x27; sagas ===
Saints&#x27; sagas (&quot;heilagra manna sögur&quot;) and bishops&#x27; sagas (&quot;biskupa sögur&quot;) are vernacular Icelandic translations and compositions, to a greater or lesser extent influenced by saga-style, in the widespread genres of hagiography and episcopal biographies. The genre seems to have begun in the mid-twelfth century.

==History==

Icelandic sagas are based on oral traditions and much research has focused on what is real and what is fiction within each tale. The accuracy of the sagas is often hotly disputed.

Most of the medieval manuscripts which are the earliest surviving witnesses to the sagas were taken to Denmark and Sweden in the seventeenth century, but later returned to Iceland. Classical sagas were composed in the thirteenth century. Scholars once believed that these sagas were transmitted orally from generation to generation until scribes wrote them down in the thirteenth century. However, most scholars now believe the sagas were conscious artistic creations, based on both oral and written tradition. A study focusing on the description of the items of clothing mentioned in the sagas concludes that the authors attempted to create a historic &quot;feel&quot; to the story, by dressing the characters in what was at the time thought to be &quot;old fashioned clothing&quot;. However, this clothing is not contemporary with the events of the saga as it is a closer match to the clothing worn in the 12th century. It was only recently (start of 20th century) that the tales of the voyages to North America (modern day Canada) were authenticated.

Most sagas of Icelanders take place in the period 930–1030, which is called &quot;söguöld&quot; (Age of the Sagas) in Icelandic history. The sagas of kings, bishops, contemporary sagas have their own time frame. Most were written down between 1190 and 1320, sometimes existing as oral traditions long before, others are pure fiction, and for some we do know the sources: the author of King Sverrir&#x27;s saga had met the king and used him as a source.

While sagas are generally anonymous, a distinctive literary movement in the 14th century involves sagas, mostly on religious topics, with identifiable authors and a distinctive Latinate style. Associated with Iceland&#x27;s northern diocese of Hólar, this movement is known as the North Icelandic Benedictine School (&quot;Norðlenski Benediktskólinn&quot;).

The vast majority of texts referred to today as &quot;sagas&quot; were composed in Iceland. One exception is &quot;Þiðreks saga&quot;, translated/composed in Norway; another is &quot;Hjalmars och Hramers saga&quot;, a post-medieval forgery composed in Sweden. While the term &quot;saga&quot; is usually associated with medieval texts, sagas — particularly in the legendary and chivalric saga genres — continued to be composed in Iceland on the pattern of medieval texts into the nineteenth century.

=== Explanations for saga writing ===
Icelanders produced a high volume of literature relative to the size of the population. Historians have proposed various theories for the high volume of saga writing.

Early, nationalist historians argued that the ethnic characteristics of the Icelanders were conducive to a literary culture, but these types of explanations have fallen out of favor with academics in modern times. It has also been proposed that the Icelandic settlers were so prolific at writing in order to capture their settler history. Historian Gunnar Karlsson does not find that explanation reasonable though, given that other settler communities have not been as prolific as the early Icelanders were.

Pragmatic explanations were once also favoured: it has been argued that a combination of readily available parchment (due to extensive cattle farming and the necessity of culling before winter) and long winters encouraged Icelanders to take up writing.

More recently, Icelandic saga-production has been seen as motivated more by social and political factors.

The unique nature of the political system of the Icelandic Commonwealth created incentives for aristocrats to produce literature, offering a way for chieftains to create and maintain social differentiation between them and the rest of the population. Gunnar Karlsson and Jesse Byock argued that the Icelanders wrote the Sagas as a way to establish commonly agreed norms and rules in the decentralized Icelandic Commonwealth by documenting past feuds, while Iceland&#x27;s peripheral location put it out of reach of the continental kings of Europe and that those kings could therefore not ban subversive forms of literature. Because new principalities lacked internal cohesion, a leader typically produced Sagas &quot;to create or enhance amongst his subjects or followers a feeling of solidarity and common identity by emphasizing their common history and legends&quot;. Leaders from old and established principalities did not produce any Sagas, as they were already cohesive political units.

Later (late thirteenth- and fourteenth-century) saga-writing was motivated by the desire of the Icelandic aristocracy to maintain or reconnect links with the Nordic countries by tracing the ancestry of Icelandic aristocrats to well-known kings and heroes to which the contemporary Nordic kings could also trace their origins.

==Editions and translations==
The corpus of Old Norse sagas is gradually being edited in the Íslenzk fornrit series, which covers all the &quot;Íslendingasögur&quot; and a growing range of other ones. Where available, the Íslenzk fornrit edition is usually the standard one. The standard edition of most of the chivalric sagas composed in Iceland is by Agnete Loth.

A list, intended to be comprehensive, of translations of Icelandic sagas is provided by the National Library of Iceland&#x27;s Bibliography of Saga Translations.

==Popular culture==
Many modern artists working in different creative fields have drawn inspiration from the sagas. Among some well-known writers, for example, who adapted saga narratives in their works are Poul Anderson, Laurent Binet, Margaret Elphinstone, Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué, Gunnar Gunnarsson, Henrik Ibsen, Halldór Laxness, Ottilie Liljencrantz, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, George Mackay Brown, William Morris, Adam Oehlenschläger, Robert Louis Stevenson, August Strindberg, Rosemary Sutcliff, Esaias Tegnér, J.R.R. Tolkien, and William T. Vollmann.

<text>The Vietnamese zodiac (Vietnamese: &quot;Mười hai con giáp&quot;) is the traditional Vietnamese classification scheme based on the lunar calendar that assigns an animal and its reputed attributes to each year in a repeating 12-year cycle. The Viet lunar calendar is divided into 60-year cycles known as &quot;hồi&quot;. Each of these consists of five 12-year animal cycles.

==Zodiac==
The Vietnamese zodiac is originated from the Chinese zodiac in its usage and arrangement of animals, but replaces the ox with the water buffalo and the rabbit with the cat. The Vietnamese zodiac uses cat instead of rabbit due to the pronunciation of the rabbit in Chinese writing: 卯 is very similar to the Vietnamese word Mèo for cat.

<text>Sheck Exley (April 1, 1949 – April 6, 1994) was an American cave diver. He is widely regarded as one of the pioneers of cave diving, and he wrote two major books on the subject: &quot;Basic Cave Diving: A Blueprint for Survival&quot; and &quot;Caverns Measureless to Man&quot;. On February 6, 1974, Exley became the first chairman of the Cave Diving Section of the American National Speleological Society. During his career, he established many of the basic safety procedures used in cave and overhead diving today. Exley was also a pioneer of extreme deep scuba diving.

For purposes of rescue during cave diving, Exley helped standardize the usage of the &quot;octopus&quot;, a redundant second stage diving regulator that can be used as a backup in the event the diver&#x27;s primary second stage fails, or alternatively, to allow the diver and their buddy to have simultaneous access to the diver&#x27;s gas if the buddy has an out-of-gas emergency. The octopus is now considered an essential piece of equipment among virtually all scuba divers, whether caving or in open water.

Exley died at age 45 while trying to set a depth record by diving the world&#x27;s deepest sinkhole, Mexico&#x27;s deep, Zacatón, a fresh water cenote.

In the book, &quot;Diving into Darkness&quot; (a story about Dave Shaw and Don Shirley), the author comments: &quot;Exley&#x27;s status in the sport is almost impossible to overstate&quot;.

==Early life and career outside of diving==
Exley began diving in 1965 at the age of 16. That same year he entered his first cave and was hooked on cave diving for the rest of his life. To finance this passion, Exley worked as a mathematics teacher at Suwannee High School in Live Oak, Florida.

In spring 1973, Exley served as an aquanaut during an eight-day mission aboard the Hydrolab underwater habitat in the Bahamas.

==Records==
Exley was the first in the world to log over 1,000 cave dives (at the age of 23); in 29 years of cave diving, he made over 4000 dives.

Exley had an unusual resistance to nitrogen narcosis, and was one of the few divers to survive a open-water dive on simple compressed air. In acting as a safety diver for two divers trying to set an air-only depth record in 1970, Exley reached in salt water, but could go no deeper due to narcosis and the start of blackout (the two record-depth attempting unconscious divers died just out of reach beneath him, and such air-depth records are no longer sought or recorded). During his diving career, he set numerous depth and cave penetration records.

Exley was the first person in the history of technical SCUBA diving to dive below , a feat only 20 people have performed . His carefully planned multistage decompressions from these dives, in open water (not in a decompression tank), sometimes required times of as much as 13.5 hours. However, he never suffered a classic case of decompression sickness in his career.

Exley and German cave diver Jochen Hasenmayer became friends and rivals in the 1980s, each repeatedly attempting to break the depth records of the other.

== Death ==
Exley died, aged 45, on April 6, 1994, while attempting to descend to a depth of over in a freshwater cenote, or sinkhole, called Zacatón in the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico. He made the dive as part of a dual dive with Jim Bowden, but Bowden aborted his descent early when his gas supply ran low. Exley&#x27;s body was recovered when his support crew hauled up his unused decompression tanks. It was found that he had looped into the descent line, perhaps to sort out gas issues. His wrist-mounted dive computer read a maximum depth of .

The cause of Exley&#x27;s death could not be determined. Team members concluded the causes &quot;...could include stress of HPNS exacerbated by the narcotic effects of nitrogen at that depth&quot;. The line was also wrapped (deliberately) around Exley&#x27;s tank valves. Bowden and other experts have theorized that Exley might have done this in anticipation of his own death to prevent any dangerous body recovery operations.

The remipede &quot;L. exleyi&quot;, discovered by Australian cave divers Andrew Poole and Dave Warren in August 1993, was named in honor of Sheck Exley.

The Sheck Exley Award is given by the National Speleological Society - Cave Diving Section for 1000 safe cave dives post full cave training.

<text>Pseudoarchaeology (sometimes called fringe or alternative archaeology) consists of attempts to study, interpret, or teach about the subject-matter of archaeology while rejecting, ignoring, or misunderstanding the accepted data-gathering and analytical methods of the discipline. These pseudoscientific interpretations involve the use of artifacts, sites or materials to construct scientifically insubstantial theories to strengthen the pseudoarchaeologists&#x27; claims. Methods include exaggeration of evidence, dramatic or romanticized conclusions, use of fallacious arguments, and fabrication of evidence.

There is no unified pseudoarchaeological theory or method, but rather many different interpretations of the past which are jointly at odds with those developed by the scientific community as well as with each other. These include religious philosophies such as creationism or &quot;creation science&quot; that apply to the archaeology of historic periods such as those that would have included the supposed worldwide flood myth, the Genesis flood narrative, Nephilim, Noah&#x27;s Ark, and the Tower of Babel. Some pseudoarchaeological theories concern the idea that prehistoric and ancient human societies were aided in their development by intelligent extraterrestrial life, an idea propagated by those such as Italian author Peter Kolosimo, French authors Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier in &quot;The Morning of the Magicians&quot; (1963), and Swiss author Erich von Däniken in &quot;Chariots of the Gods?&quot; (1968). Others instead argue there were human societies in the ancient period which were significantly technologically advanced, such as Atlantis, and this idea has been propagated by some people such as Graham Hancock in his publication &quot;Fingerprints of the Gods&quot; (1995). Pseudoarchaeology has also been manifest in Mayanism and the 2012 phenomenon.

Many pseudoarchaeological theories are intimately linked with the occult/Western esoteric tradition. Many alternative archaeologies have been adopted by religious groups. Fringe archaeological ideas such as archaeocryptography and pyramidology have been endorsed by religions ranging from the British Israelites to the theosophists. Other alternative archaeologies include those that have been adopted by members of New Age and contemporary pagan belief systems.

Academic archaeologists have often criticised pseudoarchaeology, with one of the major critics, John R. Cole, characterising it as relying on &quot;sensationalism, misuse of logic and evidence, misunderstanding of scientific method, and internal contradictions in their arguments&quot;. The relationship between alternative and academic archaeologies has been compared to the relationship between intelligent design theories and evolutionary biology by some archaeologists.

==Etymology==
Various terms have been employed to refer to these non-academic interpretations of archaeology. During the 1980s, the term &quot;cult archaeology&quot; was used by some people such as John R. Cole (1980) and William H. Stiebing Jr. (1987). &quot;Fantastic archaeology&quot; was used during the 1980s as the name of an undergraduate course at Harvard University taught by Stephen Williams, who published a book with the same title. During the 2000s, the term &quot;alternative archaeology&quot; began to be instead applied by academics like Tim Sebastion (2001), Robert J. Wallis (2003), Cornelius Holtorf (2006), and Gabriel Moshenka (2008). Garrett F. Fagan and Kenneth Feder (2006) however claimed this term was only chosen because it &quot;imparts a warmer, fuzzier feel&quot; that &quot;appeals to our higher ideals and progressive inclinations&quot;. They argued that the term &quot;pseudoarchaeology&quot; was much more appropriate, a term also used by other prominent academic and professional archaeologists such as Colin Renfrew (2006).

Other academic archaeologists have chosen to use other terms to refer to these interpretations. Glyn Daniel, the editor of &quot;Antiquity&quot;, used the derogative term &quot;bullshit archaeology&quot;, and similarly the academic William H. Stiebing Jr. noted that there were certain terms used for pseudoarchaeology that were heard &quot;in the privacy of professional archaeologists&#x27; homes and offices but which cannot be mentioned in polite society&quot;.

==Description==

Pseudoarchaeology can be practised intentionally or unintentionally. Archaeological frauds and hoaxes are considered &quot;intentional pseudoarchaeology&quot;. Genuine archaeological finds may be converted to pseudoarchaeology unintentionally by unscientific interpretation. (&quot;cf.&quot; confirmation bias)

A type of pseudoarcheology of the Middle East has created a pseudo-history of Babylon, in contradiction to Judeo-Christian and Biblical history, resulting in the production of fraudulent cuneiform tablets, as clay tablets are difficult to date. &quot;By 1904, during the early period of cuneiform tablet collecting, J. Edgar Banks, a Mesopotamian explorer and tablet dealer, estimated that nearly 80% of tablets offered for sale in Baghdad were fakes. In 2016, Syria&#x27;s Director General for Antiquities and Museums reported that approximately 70% of seized artefacts in the country are fakes.&quot;

Especially in the past, but also in the present, pseudoarchaeology has been affected by racism, which can be suggested by attempts to attribute ancient sites and artefacts to ancient Egyptians, Hebrew Lost Tribes, Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact, or even extraterrestrial intelligence rather than to indigenous peoples.

Practitioners of pseudoarchaeology often criticise academic archaeologists and established scientific methods, claiming that conventional science has ignored critical evidence. Conspiracy theories may be invoked, in which &quot;the Establishment&quot; colludes in suppressing evidence.

Cornelius Holtorf states that countering the misleading &quot;discoveries&quot; of pseudoarchaeology creates a dilemma for archaeologists: whether to attempt to disprove pseudoarchaeology by &quot;crusading&quot; methods or to concentrate on better public knowledge of the sciences involved. Holtorf suggested a third method involving identifying the social and cultural demands that both scientific archaeology and pseudoarchaeology address, and identifying the engagement of present people with the material remains of the past (such as Barbara Bender explored for Stonehenge). Holtorf presents the search for truth as a process rather than a result and states that &quot;even non-scientific research contributes to enriching our landscapes.&quot;

==Characteristics==
William H. Stiebing Jr. argued that despite their many differences, there were a set of common characteristics shared by almost all pseudoarchaeological interpretations. He believed that because of this, pseudoarchaeology could be categorised as a &quot;single phenomenon&quot;. He then identified three main commonalities of pseudeoarchaeological theories: the unscientific nature of its method and evidence, its history of providing &quot;simple, compact answers to complex, difficult issues&quot;, and its tendency to present itself as being persecuted by the archaeological establishment, accompanied by an ambivalent attitude towards the scientific ethos of the Enlightenment. This idea that there are common characteristics of pseudoarchaeologies is shared by other academics.

===Lack of scientific method===
Academic critics have stated that pseudoarchaeologists typically neglect to use the scientific method. Instead of testing evidence to see what hypotheses it satisfies best, pseudoarchaeologists force the archaeological data to fit a &quot;favored conclusion&quot; that is often arrived at through hunches, intuition, or religious or nationalist dogma. Pseudoarchaeological groups have a variety of basic assumptions that are typically unscientific: the Nazi pseudoarchaeologists for instance used the cultural superiority of the ancient Aryan race as a basic assumption, whilst Christian fundamentalist pseudoarchaeologists conceive of the Earth as being less than 10,000 years old and Hindu fundamentalist pseudoarchaeologists believe that the species &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; is much older than the 200,000 years old it has been shown to be by archaeologists. Despite this, many of pseudoarchaeology&#x27;s proponents claim that they gained their conclusions using scientific techniques and methods, even when it is demonstrable that they have not.

Academic archaeologist John R. Cole believed that most pseudoarchaeologists do not understand how scientific investigation works, and that they instead believe it to be a &quot;simple, catastrophic right versus wrong battle&quot; between contesting theories. It was because of this failure to understand the scientific method, he argued, that pseudoarchaeological arguments were faulty. He then argued that most pseudoarchaeologists do not consider alternative explanations to that which they want to propagate, and that their &quot;theories&quot; were typically just &quot;notions&quot;, not having sufficient evidence to allow them to be considered &quot;theories&quot; in the scientific, academic meaning of the word.

Commonly lacking scientific evidence, pseudoarchaeologists typically use other types of evidence for their arguments. For instance, they often use &quot;generalized cultural comparisons&quot;, using various artefacts and monuments from one society, and emphasizing similarities with those of another society to conclude that both had a common source—typically an ancient lost civilisation like Atlantis, Mu, or an extraterrestrial influence. This takes the different artefacts or monuments entirely out of their original contexts, something which is anathema to academic archaeologists, for whom context is of the utmost importance.

Another type of evidence used by a number of pseudoarchaeologists is the interpretation of various myths as representing historical events, but in doing so these myths are often taken out of their cultural contexts. For instance, pseudoarchaeologist Immanuel Velikovsky claimed that the myths of migrations and war gods in the Central American Aztec civilisation represented a cosmic catastrophe that occurred during the 7th and 8th centuries BCE. This was criticised by academic archaeologist William H. Stiebing Jr., who noted that such myths only developed during the 12th to the 14th centuries CE, two millennia after Velikovsky claimed that the events had occurred, and that the Aztec society itself had not even developed by the 7th century BCE.

===Opposition to the archaeological establishment===

Pseudoarchaeologists typically present themselves as being disadvantaged with respect to the much larger archaeological establishment. They often use language that disparages academics and dismisses them as being unadventurous, spending all their time in dusty libraries and refusing to challenge the orthodoxies of the establishment lest they lose their jobs. In some more extreme examples, pseudoarchaeologists have accused academic archaeologists of being members of a widespread conspiracy to hide the truth about history from the public. When academics challenge pseudoarchaeologists and criticise their theories, many pseudoarchaeologists claim it as further evidence that their own ideas are right, and that they are simply being harassed by members of this academic conspiracy.

The prominent English archaeologist Colin Renfrew admitted that the archaeological establishment was often &quot;set in its ways and resistant to radical new ideas&quot; but that this was not the reason why pseudoarchaeological theories were rejected by academics. Garrett G. Fagan expanded on this, noting how in the academic archaeological community, &quot;New evidence or arguments have to be thoroughly scrutinised to secure their validity ... and longstanding, well-entrenched positions will take considerable effort and particularly compelling data to overturn.&quot; Fagan noted that pseudoarchaeological theories simply do not have sufficient evidence to allow them to be accepted by professional archaeologists.

Conversely, many pseudoarchaeologists, whilst criticising the academic archaeological establishment, also attempt to get endorsements from people with academic credentials and affiliations. At times, they quote historical, and in most cases dead academics to strengthen their arguments; for instance prominent pseudoarchaeologist Graham Hancock, in his seminal &quot;Fingerprints of the Gods&quot; (1995), repeatedly notes that the eminent physicist Albert Einstein once commented positively on the pole shift hypothesis, a theory that has been abandoned by the academic community but which Hancock endorses. As Fagan noted however, the fact that Einstein was a physicist and not a geologist is not even mentioned by Hancock, nor is the fact that the present understanding of plate tectonics (which came to disprove earth crustal displacement) only became accepted generally after Einstein&#x27;s death.

==Academic archaeological responses==
Pseudoarchaeological theories have come to be much criticised by academic and professional archaeologists. One of the first books to address these directly was by archaeologist Robert Wauchope of Tulane University. Prominent academic archaeologist Colin Renfrew stated his opinion that it was appalling that pseudoarchaeologists treated archaeological evidence in such a &quot;frivolous and self-serving way&quot;, something he believed trivialised the &quot;serious matter&quot; of the study of human origins. Academics like John R. Cole, Garrett G. Fagan and Kenneth L. Feder have argued that pseudoarchaeological interpretations of the past were based upon sensationalism, self-contradiction, fallacious logic, manufactured or misinterpreted evidence, quotes taken out of context and incorrect information. Fagan and Feder characterised such interpretations of the past as being &quot;anti-reason and anti-science&quot; with some being &quot;hyper-nationalistic, racist and hateful&quot;. In turn, many pseudoarchaeologists have dismissed academics as being closed-minded and not willing to consider theories other than their own.

Many academic archaeologists have argued that the spread of alternative archaeological theories is a threat to the general public&#x27;s understanding of the past. Fagan was particularly scathing of television shows that presented pseudoarchaeological theories to the general public, believing that they did so because of the difficulties in making academic archaeological ideas comprehensible and interesting to the average viewer. Renfrew however believed that those television executives commissioning these documentaries knew that they were erroneous, and that they had allowed them to be made and broadcast simply for the hope of &quot;short-term financial gain&quot;.

Fagan and Feder believed that it was not possible for academic archaeologists to successfully engage with pseudoarchaeologists, remarking that &quot;you cannot reason with unreason&quot;. Speaking from their own experiences, they thought that attempted dialogues just became &quot;slanging matches in which the expertise and motives of the critic become the main focus of attention.&quot; Fagan has maintained this idea elsewhere, remarking that arguing with supporters of pseudoarchaeological theories was &quot;pointless&quot; because they denied logic. He noted that they included those &quot;who openly admitted to not having read a word written by a trained Egyptologist&quot; but who at the same time &quot;were pronouncing how academic Egyptology was all wrong, even sinister.&quot;

===Conferences and anthologies===

At the 1986 meeting of the Society for American Archaeology, its organizers, Kenneth Feder, Luanne Hudson and Francis Harrold decided to hold a symposium to examine pseudoarchaeological beliefs from a variety of academic standpoints, including archaeology, physical anthropology, sociology, history and psychology. From this symposium, an anthology was produced, entitled &quot;Cult Archaeology &amp; Creationism: Understanding Pseudoarchaeological Beliefs about the Past&quot; (1987).

At the 2002 annual meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America, a workshop was held on the topic of pseudoarchaeology. It subsequently resulted in the publication of an academic anthology, &quot;Archaeological Fantasies: How Pseudoarchaeology Misrepresents the Past and Misleads the Public&quot; (2006), which was edited by Garrett G. Fagan.

On 23 and 24 April 2009, The American Schools of Oriental Research and the Duke University Center for Jewish Studies, along with the Duke Department of Religion, the Duke Graduate Program in Religion, the Trinity College of Arts and Sciences Committee on Faculty Research, and the John Hope Franklin Humanities Institute, sponsored a conference entitled &quot;Archaeology, Politics, and the Media,&quot; which addressed the abuse of archaeology in the Holy Land for political, religious, and ideological purposes. Emphasis was placed on the media&#x27;s reporting of sensational and politically motivated archaeological claims and the academy&#x27;s responsibility in responding to it.

===Inclusive attitudes===
Academic archaeologist Cornelius Holtorf believed however that critics of alternative archaeologies like Fagan were &quot;opinionated and patronizing&quot; towards alternative theories, and that purporting their opinions in such a manner was damaging to the public&#x27;s perception of archaeologists. Holtorf emphasized that there were similarities between academic and alternative archaeological interpretations, with the former being influenced by the latter. As evidence, he emphasized archaeoastronomy, which was once considered as a component of fringe archaeological interpretations before being adopted by mainstream academics. He also noted that certain archaeological scholars, like William Stukeley (1687–1765), Margaret Murray (1863–1963) and Marija Gimbutas (1921–1994) were formerly considered to be eminent by both academic and alternative archaeologists. He came to the conclusion that a constructive dialogue should be begun between academic and alternative archaeologists. Fagan and Feder have responded to Holtorf&#x27;s statements in detail, asserting that such a dialogue is no more possible than is one between evolutionary biologists and creationists or between astronomers and astrologers: one is scientific, the other is anti-scientific.

During the early 1980s, Kenneth Feder performed a survey of his archaeology students. On the 50-question survey, 10 questions had to do with archaeology and/or pseudoscience. Some of the claims were more rational; the world is 5 billion years old, and human beings came about through evolution. However, questions also included issues such as, King Tut&#x27;s tomb actually killed people upon discovery, and there is good evidence for the existence of Atlantis. As it resulted, some of the students Feder was teaching gave some credibility to the pseudoscience claims. 12% actually believed people on Howard Carter&#x27;s expedition were killed by an ancient Egyptian curse.

==Historical pseudoarchaeology==

During the mid-2nd century, those exposed by Lucian&#x27;s sarcastic essay &quot;Alexander the false prophet&quot; prepared an archaeological &quot;find&quot; in Chalcedon to prepare a public for the supposed oracle they planned to establish at Abonoteichus in Paphlagonia (Pearse, 2001):

At Glastonbury Abbey in 1291, at a time when King Edward I desired to emphasize his &quot;Englishness&quot;, an alleged discovery was made: the supposed coffin of King Arthur, identified helpfully with an inscribed plaque. Arthur was reinterred at Glastonbury with a magnificent ceremonial attended by the king and queen.

== Nationalist motivations ==

Pseudoarchaeology can be motivated by nationalism (&quot;cf.&quot; Nazi archaeology, using cultural superiority of the ancient Aryan race as a basic assumption to establish the Germanic people as the descendants of the original Aryan &#x27;master race&#x27;) or a desire to prove a particular religious (&quot;cf.&quot; intelligent design), pseudohistorical, political, or anthropological theory. In many cases, an &quot;a priori&quot; conclusion is established, and fieldwork is performed explicitly to corroborate the theory in detail. According to archaeologist John Hoopes, writing for the magazine of the Society for American Archaeology, &quot;Pseudoarchaeology actively promotes myths that are routinely used in the service of white supremacy, racialized nationalism, colonialism, and the dispossession and oppression of indigenous peoples.&quot;

Archaeologists distinguish their research from pseudoarchaeology by indicating differences of research methods, including recursive methods, falsifiable theories, peer review, and a generally systematic approach to collecting data. Though there is overwhelming evidence of cultural associations informing folk traditions about the past, objective analysis of folk archaeology—in anthropological terms of their cultural contexts and the cultural desires to which they respond—have been comparatively few. However, in this vein, Robert Silverberg located the Mormons&#x27; use of Mound Builder culture within a larger cultural nexus and the voyage of Madoc and &quot;Welsh Indians&quot; was set in its changing and evolving sociohistorical contexts by Gwyn Williams.

=== Examples ===

*The Kensington Runestone of Minnesota used to allege Nordic Viking primacy of exploring the Americas.
* Nazi archaeology, the Thule Society, and expeditions sent by the Ahnenerbe to research the existence of an alleged Aryan race. The research of Edmund Kiss at Tiwanaku would be one example.
* The Bosnian pyramids project, which has projected that several hills in Visoko, Bosnia are ancient pyramids.
* Piltdown Man.
* Jovan I. Deretić&#x27;s Serbocentric claims for the ancient history of the Old World.
* Romanian protochronism also uses pseudoarchaeological interpretations; for more pieces of information, see the Tărtăria tablets, the Rohonc Codex&#x27;s Daco-Romanian hypothesis, or the Sinaia lead plates.
* The theory that New Zealand was not settled by the Māori people, but by a pre-Polynesian race of giants
* Claims of a Tartarian Empire that colonized the world.
* Afrocentrist claims that Black people should be credited with creating the first civilizations.

== Religious motivations ==
Religiously motivated pseudoarchaeological theories include the young earth theory of some Judeo-Christian fundamentalists. They argue that the Earth is 4,000–10,000 years old, with claims varying depending on the source. Some Hindu pseudoarchaeologists believe that the &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; species is much older than the 200,000 years it is generally believed to have existed. Archaeologist John R. Cole refers to such beliefs as &quot;cult archaeology&quot; and believes them to be pseudoarchaeological. He said that this &quot;pseudoarchaeology&quot; had &quot;many of the attributes, causes, and effects of religion&quot;.

A more specific example of religious pseudoarcheology is the claim of Ron Wyatt to have discovered Noah&#x27;s ark, the graves of Noah and his wife, the location of Sodom and Gomorrah, the Tower of Babel, and numerous other important sites. However, he has not presented evidence sufficient to impress Bible scholars, scientists, and historians. The organization Answers in Genesis propagates many pseudoscientific notions as part of its creationist ministry.

=== Examples ===
* Creation science, also known as &quot;scientific creationism,&quot; but which is actually pseudoscientific, as it pertains to human origins.
* Repeated claims of the discovery of Noah&#x27;s Ark on Mount Ararat or neighbouring mountain ranges.
* Use of questionable artefacts such as the Grave Creek Stone, the Los Lunas Decalogue Stone and the Michigan relics to represent proof of the presence of a pre-Columbian Semitic culture in America.
* New Age assertions about Atlantis, Lemuria, and ancient root races derived from the writings of authors such as 19th-century theosophist and occultist Helena Blavatsky.
* Denial of scientific dating techniques in favor of a young Earth age.

== In Egyptology ==
Pseudoarchaeology can be found in relation to Egyptology, the study of ancient Egypt. Some of this includes pyramidology, a collection of pseudoscientific beliefs about pyramids around the world that includes the pyramids in Egypt and specifically the Great Pyramid of Giza.

=== Pyramids ===
One belief originally published by Charles Piazzi Smyth in 1864 is that the Great Pyramid was not built by humans for the pharaoh Khufu, but was so beautiful that it could it have been crafted only by the hand of God. Though Smyth contributed to the idea of the Great Pyramid not being created originally by Khufu, this belief has been further propagated by Zecharia Sitchin in books such as &quot;The Stairway to Heaven&quot; (1983) and more recently by Scott Creighton in &quot;The Great Pyramid Hoax&quot; (2017), both of which argue that Howard Vyse (the discoverer of Khufu cartouches within the Great Pyramid) presented the earliest evidence that the Great Pyramid&#x27;s builder) faked the markings of Khufu&#x27;s name. However, Sitchin&#x27;s research has been challenged as being pseudoscience. Arguments against these theories often detail the discovery of external texts on papyri such as the Diary of Merer that detail the construction of the Great Pyramid.

The theory the Egyptian pyramids were not built as tombs of ancient pharaohs, but for other purposes, has resulted in a variety of alternative theories about their purpose and origins. One such pseudoarchaeological theory is from Scott Creighton, who argues that the pyramids were built as recovery vaults to survive a deluge (whether that be associated with flood geology or the Genesis Flood Narrative). Another alternative theory for the purpose of the pyramids comes from known pseudoarchaeologist Graham Hancock, who argues that the pyramids originated from an early civilization that was destroyed by an asteroid that also began the Younger Dryas period. A third common pseudoarchaeological theory about the Egyptian pyramids is that they were built by ancient aliens. This belief is sometimes explained for why the pyramids supposedly appear suddenly in history. However, this claim is challenged by Egyptologists who describe an evolution of pyramid designs from mastaba tombs, to the Step Pyramid of Djoser, to the collapsed Meidum Pyramid, to Sneferefu&#x27;s Bent Pyramid, ending with Khufu&#x27;s Great Pyramid. Many alternative beliefs have been criticized as ignoring the knowledge, architectural and constructive capabilities of ancient Egyptians.

=== Mummy curses ===
Another pseudoegyptological belief is that of the curse of the pharaohs, which involves a belief of imprecations being directed against those who enter the tombs of mummies, and pharaohs. These curses often include natural disaster or illness or death for those who have entered the tomb. One of the most influential iterations of this theory comes from the discovery of King Tutankhamun by Howard Carter in November 1922. Several deaths of those present at the excavation have been attributed to a curse, including that of Lord Carnarvon who died as the result of an infected mosquito bite, sepsis, and pneumonia slightly more than four months after the excavation. There were also claims that all lights in Cairo went out at the moment of Lord Carnavon&#x27;s death. However, skeptics believe that reporters overlooked rational explanations and relied on supernatural legends. In 2021, mummies discovered mostly from the New Kingdom period were to be paraded through Cairo during a transference for study. However, several events occurred, including a ship blocking the Suez Canal and accidents involving several members of the crew. Many claimed these were the results of a pharaoh&#x27;s curse, however, Egyptologist Zahi Hawass dismissed the claims as random tragedies.

=== Pre-Columbian contact and Mayan connections ===
Some pseudoarchaeologists speculate that Egypt had contact with the Maya civilization before Columbus reached the Bahamas in 1492. Part of these arguments stem from the discovery of nicotine and cocaine traces found in various mummies. The argument is that plants producing these were not known to exist outside the Americas, although Duncan Edlin found that plants containing both nicotine and cocaine existed in Egypt and therefore could have been used by ancient Egyptians. Another argument against possible contact is that there is a massive body of literature in the form of hieroglyphics from ancient Egypt, however ancient Egyptian scholars never noted contacting the Americas in any of the texts that have been found.

Another argument in favor of contact between ancient Egyptians and Mayans is from claims of similarities of art, architecture and writing. These theories are explained by authors such as Graham Hancock in &quot;Fingerprints of the Gods&quot; (1995) and more recently by Richard Cassaro in &quot;Mayan Masonry&quot;. These similarities commonly mention creation of pyramids, use of archways, and similarities in artwork of the divine. Arguments such as these claim an association between ancient Egypt and Maya through either a transatlantic outing that brought Egypt to the Mayas or through a shared origin in both civilizations (either in Atlantis or Lemuria). &quot;Voyages of the Pyramid Builders&quot; (2003) by geologist Robert Schoch argues that both Egyptian and Maya pyramids result from a common lost civilization. However, ancient historian Garrett Fagan criticized Schoch&#x27;s theory on the grounds that it demonstrated ignorance of relevant facts and that it did not explain variations in appearance or how various civilizations&#x27; pyramids were built. Fagan also describes known research by several archaeologists about the development of various civilizations&#x27; pyramids that was not used or addressed by Schoch&#x27;s theory.

=== Flood theories and the Great Sphinx ===
For Egypt-related pseudoarchaeology, there are a variety of flood-related theories, many of which relate to the Biblical Genesis flood narrative or other flood theories. Scott Creighton claims that knowledge of a coming deluge (which he refers to as &quot;Thoth&#x27;s Flood&quot;) generated the idea of building pyramids as recovery vaults from which civilization could rebuild. Another fringe theory relating to this is the Sphinx water erosion hypothesis, which claims that the Great Sphinx of Giza&#x27;s modern body appearance is caused by erosion due to flooding or rain. This theory, which has been perpetuated by Robert Schoch who claims the Sphinx was built between 5000 and 7000 BCE, has been criticized by Zahi Hawass and Mark Lehner as ignoring Old Kingdom societal evidence about the Sphinx and being flawed in citing specifics about a possible erosion. Currently Egyptologists tend to date the Sphinx sometime about 2500 B.C., approximately the reign of the pharaoh Khafre for whom the Sphinx is commonly attributed.

== The Mayas ==

Many aspects of Maya civilization have inspired pseudoarchaeological speculation. In Mexico, this history can bring more people which in turn brings more money for the area, which the Maya peoples usually do not receive. Many examples of pseudoarcheology pertaining to Maya civilization can be found in literature, art, and movies. Many of them have to do with the 2012 phenomenon and the Maya calendar. These are often referred to as Mayanism, a collection of New Age beliefs about Mayas and Maya religion and/or spirituality. That said, Mayan culture has long been a subject of scientific archaeology. Archaeologists have uncovered evidence that has furthered our knowledge of the past. Some of these include stone carvings in Tikal that show the earliest stories of Sihyaj Chan Kʼawiil II and materials recovered from Chichen Itza.

=== Examples of Maya-related pseudoarchaeology ===
*A well-known example of Maya pseudoarcheology is the interpretation of the remains of Kʼinich Janaabʼ Pakal and his burial. Pseudoarchaeologists have discussed much about the discovery of Pakal&#x27;s sarcophagus lid and the answers they gained from studying it. Pseudoarchaeology author Maurice Cotterell writes about this in his book &quot;The Supergods&quot;. One of the main draws in this material for Cotterell and other pseudoarchaeologists is that the ancient Aztec and Maya people possessed knowledge beyond our imagination. From being able to “take off in spaceships”, to dealing with complex numbers and equations, these people possessed “godly intelligence”. Their biggest study and answer came from analyzing the Mayan calendar and finding correlations with the Sun and Earth. He states that “they (Sun, Earth, Mayan Calendar) come close together every 260 days, this agreed with his suspicion that the Mayan numbering system was connected with solar magnetic cycles”. There are no professionals that endorse his statements, and his conclusions are based on insufficient evidence. Cotterell&#x27;s work is pseudoarcheology because it reports his own non-scientific interpretations, without any scientific peer review or critical analysis by professional archaeologists.
*Another example of pseudoarcheology concerning Maya civilization are some conclusions gained from studying the Maya calendar. The Calendar Round seems to have been based on two overlapping annual cycles: a 260-day sacred year and a 365-day secular year that named 18 months with 20 days each. The Maya calendar also included what were termed Long Counts, these were created by priests at the time and a single cycle lasted 5,126 solar years. From the time this was created, the end of the solar years occurred on 21 December 2012. Ancient hieroglyphs from Tortuguero claimed that when this cycle ended, Bolon Yokte, the Mayan god of creation and war would arrive. Some pseudoarchaeologists assumed to mean that the world would end.
*The stone carvings in Tikal that have been important to archaeologists attempting to recreate the past, have also been used by pseudoarchaeologists to fabricate false claims about the past. In reality these carvings have been used to reconstruct the stories and history of more than thirty dynastic rulers. Some pseudoarchaeologists claim that these carvings are of ancient aliens or another form of extraterrestrial life. These claims are widely regarded as false by archeologists. When these claims were circulated during the early 1990s, the rate of tourism boomed. In cases like this, pseudoarcheological claims can often garner public attention more effectively than peer-reviewed archeology.
*Chichén Itzá in Mexico has long been an important archaeological site. Throughout the past few years there have been many wild claims by pseudoarchaeologists. The passageway beneath the Kulkulcan pyramid, a part of Chichén Itzá, was found and this is what many of the pseudoarchaeologists&#x27; claims concern. The claim is that this passageway was and still is a direct channel to the underworld. There are many possibilities for what this could have been used for, but there are not any facts to prove this statement. Many experts, including Guillermo de And, an underwater archaeologist who directed a few expeditions to uncover Mayan aqua life, believe that the passageway was a “secret cenote”.

==Other notable examples==

* The assertion that the Mound Builders were a long vanished non-Native American people thought to have come from Europe, the Middle East, or Africa.
* Neolithic hyperdiffusion from Egypt being responsible for influencing most of the major ancient civilizations of the world in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and particularly the ancient Native Americans. This includes Olmec alternative origin speculations.
* Archaeological interest of Pedra da Gávea.
* The work of 19th- and early 20th-century authors such as Ignatius Donnelly, Augustus Le Plongeon, James Churchward, and Arthur Posnansky.
* The work of contemporary authors such as Giorgio Tsoukalos, Erich von Däniken, Barry Fell, Zecharia Sitchin, Robert Bauval, Frank Joseph, Graham Hancock, Colin Wilson, Michael Cremo, Immanuel Velikovsky, and David Hatcher Childress.
* Lost lands such as Atlantis, Mu, Kumari Kandam, Phantom island Tartary and Lemuria, which are all contested by mainstream archaeologists and historians as lacking critical physical evidence and general historical credibility.
* Speculation by paranormal researchers that an abnormal human skull promoted as the &quot;starchild skull&quot; was the product of extraterrestrial-human breeding or extraterrestrial genetic engineering, despite DNA evidence proving that the skull was that of an anatomically modern human infant, most likely suffering from hydrocephalus.

<text>&quot;For the Slipknot song of the same name, see Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses)&quot;

The opium of the people or opium of the masses () is a dictum used in reference to religion, derived from a frequently paraphrased partial statement of German revolutionary and critic of political economy Karl Marx: &quot;Religion is the opium of the people.&quot; In context, the statement is part of Marx&#x27;s analysis that religion&#x27;s role is as a metaphysical balm for the real suffering in the universe and in society.

This statement was translated from the German original, &quot;&quot; and is often rendered as &quot;religion[...] is the opiate of the .&quot; The full sentence from Marx translates (including italics) as: &quot;Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the of the people.&quot;

The quotation originates from the introduction of Marx&#x27;s work &quot;A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel&#x27;s Philosophy of Right&quot;, which he started in 1843 but which was not published until after his death. The introduction to this work was published separately in 1844, in Marx&#x27;s own journal , a collaboration with Arnold Ruge. Often quoted only in part, the interpretation of the metaphor in its context has received much less attention.

== Full quotation and history ==
Marx wrote this passage in 1843 as part of the introduction to &quot;Critique of Hegel&#x27;s Philosophy of Right&quot;, a book that criticized philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel&#x27;s 1820 book, &quot;Elements of the Philosophy of Right&quot;. This introduction was published in 1844 in a small journal called ; however, the book itself was published posthumously. As the journal had a print run of just 1,000 copies, it had no popular effect during the 19th century. The phrase became better known during the 1930s, when Marxism became more popular.

The quotation, in context, reads as follows (italics in original translation):

== Metaphor ==
Marx used the phrase to make a structural-functionalist argument about religion, and particularly about organized religion. In his view, religion may be false, but it is a function of something real. Specifically, Marx believed that religion had certain practical functions in society that were similar to the function of opium in a sick or injured person: it reduced people&#x27;s immediate suffering and provided them with pleasant illusions which gave them the strength to carry on. In this sense, while Marx may have no sympathy for religion itself, he has deep sympathy for those proletariat who put their trust in it.

At the same time, Marx saw religion as harmful to revolutionary goals: by focusing on the eternal rather than the temporal, religion turns the attention of the oppressed away from the exploitation and class structure that encompasses their everyday lives. In the process, religion helps to foster a kind of false consciousness that emboldens cultural values and beliefs that support and validate the continued dominance of the ruling class. It thereby prevents the socialist revolution, the overthrowing of capitalism, and the establishment of a classless, socialist society. In Marx&#x27;s view, once workers finally overthrow capitalism, unequal social relations will no longer need legitimating and people&#x27;s alienation will dissolve, along with any need for religion.

=== Interpretations by subsequent communist leaders and theorists ===
Subsequent communist leaders and theorists have reflected and expanded on Marx&#x27;s metaphor and considered it in the context of their own national conditions.

==== Vladimir Lenin ====
Vladimir Lenin, speaking of religion in in 1905, alluded to Marx&#x27;s earlier comments:

==== Kim Il Sung ====
North Korean leader Kim Il Sung&#x27;s writings addressed the &quot;opium&quot; metaphor twice, both in the context of responding to comrades who object to working with religious groups (Chonbulygo and Chondoism). In the first instance, Kim replies that a person is &quot;mistaken&quot; if they believe Marx&#x27;s proposition regarding &quot;opium of the people&quot; can be applied in all instances, explaining that if a religion &quot;prays for dealing out divine punishment to Japan and blessing the Korean nation&quot; then it is a &quot;patriotic religion&quot; and its believers are patriots. In the second, Kim states that Marx&#x27;s metaphor &quot;must not be construed radically and unilaterally&quot; because Marx was warning against &quot;the temptation of a religious mirage and not opposing believers in general.&quot; Because the communist movement in Korea was fighting a struggle for &quot;national salvation&quot; against Japan, Kim writes that anyone with a similar agenda can join the struggle and that &quot;even a religionist[...] must be enrolled in our ranks without hesitation.&quot;

=== Academic interpretations ===
Roland Boer argues that Marx&#x27;s depiction of religion as opium has been largely misinterpreted, and that at that time opium was both valued and denounced for its medicinal qualities and its addictive potential.

In other academic work, Robin Dunbar has used the idea of religion being &quot;the opium of the people&quot; to suggest that group religious practice may lead to the body&#x27;s natural release of endogenous opioids, known as endorphins. Multiple studies have been conducted attempting to test this hypothesis. In one such series of studies, Sarah Charles found evidence that religious ritual did lead to the release of endogenous opioids, which was directly linked to participants&#x27; feelings of bonding during the group religious practice.

=== Similar statements and influence ===
The same metaphor was used by many authors around the 19th century.

In 1798, Novalis wrote in (&#x27;Pollen&#x27;):

In 1840, Heinrich Heine also used the same analogy, in his essay on Ludwig Börne:

The writings of Bruno Bauer are a key influence on the &quot;Critique of Hegel&#x27;s Philosophy of Right&quot;. Marx&#x27;s metaphor is anticipated in two of Bauer&#x27;s works: and . In the former work, Bauer talks of religion as a cause of &quot;opium-like stupefaction;&quot; in the latter, Bauer mentions theology&#x27;s &quot;opium-like&quot; influence.

Charles Kingsley, a canon of the Church of England, wrote the following in 1847, four years after Marx:

==== Miguel de Unamuno ====
Miguel de Unamuno, the famed Spanish author of the Generation of &#x27;98, focused his nivola around the theme of religion&#x27;s opiatic effect on the people of rural Spain. In the book, the protagonist Don Manuel is a priest who does not believe in God, but continues preaching because he sees the positive impact he can make in the lives of his parishioners. Religion in this way also serves to cure his own deep depression, through the happiness he feels from helping the people of Valverde de Lucerna. Unamuno makes direct reference to Marx when Don Manuel explains:

=== Modern comparisons ===
Some writers make a modern comparison of the phrase &quot;opium of the people&quot; to that akin to sports fandom, celebrities, the distractions of television, the internet, and other entertainment, etc. This can be seen as a parallel to the concept of bread and circuses.

In 2016 in the &quot;Atlantic&quot; and on the PBS show hosted by Charlie Rose, prior to being elected senator or nominated to be Donald Trump&#x27;s running mate, JD Vance called Trump &quot;cultural heroin&quot; and &quot;an opioid of the masses.&quot;

<text>The regular script is the newest of the major Chinese script styles, emerging during the Three Kingdoms period , and stylistically mature by the 7th century. It is the most common style used in modern text. In its traditional form it is the third-most common in publishing after the Ming and Gothic types used exclusively in print.

== History ==
The &quot;Xuanhe Calligraphy Manual&quot; () credits with creating the regular script, based on the clerical script of the early Han dynasty (202 BCE220 CE). It became popular during the Eastern Han and Three Kingdoms periods, with Zhong Yao (230 CE), a calligrapher in the state of Cao Wei (220–266), being credited as its first master, known as the father of regular script. His famous works include the , , and . Palaeographer Qiu Xigui describes the script in &quot;Xuanshi biao&quot; as:
However, very few wrote in this script at the time other than a few literati; most continued writing in the neo-clerical script, or a hybrid form of semi-cursive and neo-clerical. The regular script did not become dominant until the 5th century during the early Northern and Southern period (420–589); there was a variety of the regular script which emerged from neo-clerical as well as regular scripts known as or . Thus, the regular script is descended both from the early semi-cursive style as well as from the neo-clerical script.

The script is considered to have become stylistically mature during the Tang dynasty (618–907), with the most famous and oft-imitated calligraphers of that period being the early Tang&#x27;s Four Great Calligraphers (): Ouyang Xun, Yu Shinan, Chu Suiliang, and Xue Ji, as well as the tandem of Yan Zhenqing and Liu Gongquan.

During the Northern Song (960–1127), Emperor Huizong created an iconic style known as . During the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), Zhao Mengfu (1254–1322) also became known for his own calligraphic style for the regular script, called .

92 rules governing the fundamental structure of regular script were established during the Qing dynasty (1644–1912); the calligrapher wrote a guidebook illustrating these rules, with four characters provided as an example for each.
== Characteristics ==
The Eight Principles of &quot;Yong&quot; encapsulate varieties of most strokes that appear in the regular script. Regular script characters with dimensions larger than are usually classified as &#x27;large&#x27; (); those smaller than are usually classified as &#x27;small&#x27; (), and those in between are &#x27;medium&#x27; ().

Notable works written in regular script include the Northern and Southern-era &quot;Records of Yao Boduo Sculpturing&quot; () and &quot;Tablet of General Guangwu&quot; (), the Sui-era &quot;Tablet of Longzang Temple&quot; (), &quot;Tombstone Record of Sui Xiaoci&quot; (), and &quot;Tombstone Record of Beauty Tong&quot; (), and the Tang-era &quot;Sweet Spring at Jiucheng Palace&quot; ().

== Derivative styles ==
* Fangsong typefaces are based on a printed style which developed during the Song dynasty (970–1279)
* The most common printed typeface styles, Ming and sans-serif, are based on Fangsong
* Japanese textbook typefaces (; ) are based on regular script, but modified so that they appear to be written with a pencil or pen. They also follow the &quot;jōyō kanji&quot; character forms.
* The bopomofo semi-syllabograms are nearly always written using regular script strokes.

<text>Akhmat-Khadzhi Abdulkhamidovich Kadyrov (23 August 1951 – 9 May 2004) was a Russian politician and revolutionary who served as Chief Mufti of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria in the 1990s during and after the First Chechen War. At the outbreak of the Second Chechen War he switched sides, offering his service to the Russian government, and later became the President of the Chechen Republic from 5 October 2003, having acted as head of administration since July 2000.

On 9 May 2004, he was assassinated by Chechen Islamists in Grozny, by a bomb blast during a Victory Day memorial parade. His son, Ramzan Kadyrov, who led his father&#x27;s militia, became his successor in March 2007 as the President of the Chechen Republic.

==Early life==
Akhmat Abdulkhamidovich Kadyrov was born in Karaganda in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic on 23 August 1951 to a Chechen family that had been expelled from Chechnya during the deportation of the Chechens and Ingush. In April 1957, his family returned to Shalinsky District of the Chechen-Ingush ASSR. In 1980, he started studying Islam at Mir-i Arab Madrasah in Bukhara, and followed by studying at Islamic University in Tashkent, Uzbek SSR, from 1982 to 1986. In the early 1990s, he returned to Chechnya, and founded the Islamic Institute in the village of Kurchaloy.

Following the Chechen declaration of independence, he became a supporter of the president Dzhokhar Dudayev. Kadyrov fought prominently in the First Chechen War on the Chechen side as a militia commander. In 1995, he was appointed Chief Mufti of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria and correspondingly Chairperson of the Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of the Chechen Republic. Following the outbreak of violence between Moscow and Chechen separatists, Kadyrov reportedly declared that &quot;There are a million Chechens, and 150 million Russians. If every Chechen kills 150 Russians, we will win.&quot; He later denied that, noting that he urged to kill as many Russians as possible.

== Second Chechen War ==

While the first war was mainly fought for nationalism, after the &quot;de facto&quot; independence of Chechnya, much of the Chechen forces by 1999 were jihadists, such as the Chechen Mujahideen. Kadyrov, as Chief Mufti, was critical of Wahhabism, to which many of the foreign fighters adhered.

Early in 1999, Kadyrov gave a speech before the armed militia telling them that the nation was behind them, that the recent outbreak of violence was the fault of Christian and foreign involvement, and that they should continue on fighting with persistence and trust.

But by the autumn of 1999, Kadyrov – a leading figure in the resistance movement – decided to abandon the insurgency and offered his support to the Russian federal forces in the Second Chechen War. Aslan Maskhadov immediately fired him from the Chief Mufti chair, although this decree was never accepted by Kadyrov, who abdicated himself a few months later due to his civilian chairman career. According to James Hughes, Kadyrov&#x27;s U-turn may have been motivated partly by personal ambition and partly by a concern with the desperate condition of the Chechen population, and was also driven by a fear of the growing sectarian Wahhabi influence on the insurgency.

After the Russian forces seized control over Chechnya in June 2000, Kadyrov was appointed head of the administration of the Chechen Republic by the Russian president Vladimir Putin, an interim transitional office until a Constitution is applied, which was the predecessor office to the future office of the President of the Chechen Republic. On 5 October 2003, he was elected the first President of the Chechen Republic. In this position, he remained mainly pro-Moscow. He also advocated numerous amnesty campaigns for former rebel fighters, who were allowed to join Chechen police and loyalist militia forces if they surrendered. His chief personal bodyguard was Movladi Baisarov. Reportedly, there were at least a dozen assassination attempts against him before the final one.

==Personal life==
Kadyrov had four children, two daughters (Zargan and Zulay) and two sons. His eldest son, Zelimkhan Kadyrov, died on 31 May 2004. His younger son, Ramzan Kadyrov, led his father&#x27;s militia and was appointed prime minister and president of Chechnya in March 2007.

==Death and legacy==

On 9 May 2004, an explosion ripped through the VIP seating at the Dinamo football stadium during a mid-morning Soviet Victory Day parade in the capital city of Grozny, instantly killing Kadyrov. Two of his bodyguards, the Chairman of the Chechen State Council, a Reuters journalist, and a dozen others were also killed (a later report stated that more than 30 people had died). Some 56 others were wounded, including Colonel General Valery Baranov, the commander of Russian forces in Chechnya, who lost a leg in the explosion. The bomb was said to have been built into the concrete of a supporting column during recent repairs. The Islamist Chechen rebel leader Shamil Basayev later claimed that he had paid $50,000 for the attack.

Both the Akhmad Kadyrov Mosque in Grozny, and the Akhmat Haji Kadyrov Mosque in the village of Abu Ghosh in Israel are named after him.

On 7 June 2017, the football club Terek Grozny was renamed to Akhmat Grozny in Kadyrov&#x27;s honour.

<text>Paolo Lucio Anafesto () was, according to tradition, the first Doge of Venice, serving from 697 to 717. He is known for repelling Umayyad attacks.

==Biography==
A noble of Eraclea, then the primary city of the region, he was elected in 697 as an official over the entire lagoon that surrounded Venice. 

His job was to both put an end to the conflicts between the various tribunes who until then had governed the differing parts and to coordinate the defense against the Lombards and the Slavs who were encroaching on their settlements. He also repelled Umayyad attacks and raids onto his kingdom. However, Anafesto&#x27;s existence is uncorroborated by any source before the 11th century.

==History==
According to John Julius Norwich, Paolo Lucio Anafesto was actually Exarch Paul. Moreover, Paul&#x27;s &quot;magister militum&quot; had the same first name as Paoluccio&#x27;s reputed successor, Marcellus Tegallianus, casting doubt on the authenticity of that doge as well.

<doc id="300208" wikidata="Q309996" url="?curid=300208" title="Namco">
<text>was a Japanese multinational video game and entertainment company founded in 1955 which operated video arcades and amusement parks globally, produced video games, films, toys, and arcade cabinets. They were one of the most influential figures in the worldwide coin-op and arcade game industry; Namco produced several multi-million-selling game franchises, such as &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, &quot;Galaxian&quot;, &quot;Tekken&quot;, &quot;Tales&quot;, &quot;Ridge Racer&quot;, and &quot;Ace Combat&quot;. In 2006, Namco merged with Bandai to form what is now named Bandai Namco Holdings; the standalone Namco brand continues to be used for video arcade and other entertainment products by the group&#x27;s Bandai Namco Amusements division.

The &quot;Namco&quot; name comes from &quot;Nakamura Manufacturing Company&quot;, derived from its founder Masaya Nakamura. In the 1960s, it manufactured electro-mechanical arcade games such as the 1965 hit &quot;Periscope&quot;. It entered the video game industry after acquiring the struggling Japanese division of Atari in 1974, distributing games such as &quot;Breakout&quot; in Japan. The company renamed itself Namco in 1977 and published &quot;Gee Bee&quot;, its first original video game, a year later. Among Namco&#x27;s first major hits was the fixed shooter &quot;Galaxian&quot; in 1979. It was followed by &quot;Pac-Man&quot; in 1980. Namco prospered during the golden age of arcade video games in the early 1980s, releasing popular titles such as &quot;Galaga&quot;, &quot;Xevious&quot;, and &quot;Pole Position&quot;.

Namco entered the home market in 1984 with conversions of its arcade games for the MSX and the Nintendo Family Computer, later expanding to competing platforms, such as the Sega Genesis, TurboGrafx-16, and PlayStation. Namco continued to produce hit games in the 1990s, including &quot;Ridge Racer&quot;, &quot;Tekken&quot;, and &quot;Taiko no Tatsujin&quot;, but later endured financial difficulties due to the struggling Japanese economy and diminishing arcade market. This led to the 2005 announcement of a merge with toy maker Bandai, which was completed in 2006 as Namco Bandai Holdings; Namco&#x27;s former video games division was merged into a subsidiary of the holdings company, Namco Bandai Games, now called Bandai Namco Entertainment. Namco is remembered in retrospect for its unique corporate model, its importance to the industry, and its advancements in technology.

==History==
===Origins and acquisition of Atari Japan (1955–1977)===

On June 1, 1955, Japanese businessman Masaya Nakamura founded in Ikegami, Tokyo. The son of a shotgun repair business owner, Nakamura proved unable to find work in his chosen profession of ship building in the struggling post-World War II economy. Nakamura established his own company after his father&#x27;s business saw success with producing pop cork guns. Beginning with only ¥300,000 (US$12,000), Nakamura spent the money on two hand-cranked rocking horses that he installed on the roof garden of a Matsuya department store in Yokohama.

The horses were loved by children and turned a decent profit for Nakamura, who began expanding his business to cover other smaller locations. A 1959 business reorganization renamed the company Nakamura Seisakusho Company, Ltd. The Mitsukoshi department store chain noticed his success in 1963, and approached him with the idea of constructing a rooftop amusement space for its store in Nihonbashi, Tokyo. It consisted of horse rides, a picture viewing machine, and a goldfish scooping pond, with the centerpiece being a moving train named &quot;Roadaway Race&quot;. The space was a hit and lead to Mitsukoshi requesting rooftop amusement parks for all of its stores.

Along with Taito, Rosen Enterprises, and Nihon Goraku Bussan, Nakamura Seisakusho became one of Japan&#x27;s leading amusement companies. As the business grew in size, it used its clout to purchase amusement machines in bulk from other manufacturers at a discount, and then sell them to smaller outlets at full price. While its machines sold well, Nakamura Seisakusho lacked the manufacturing lines and distribution networks of its competitors, which made the production of them longer and more expensive.

The company was unable to place its machines inside stores because other manufacturers already had exclusive rights to these locations. In response, Nakamura Seisakusho opened a production plant in February 1966, moving its corporate office to a four-story building in Ōta, Tokyo. The company secured a deal with Walt Disney Productions to produce children&#x27;s rides in the likenesses of its characters, in addition to those using popular anime characters like Q-Taro; this move allowed the business to further expand its operations and become a driving force in the Japanese coin-op market.

Though the manufacturing facility was largely reserved for its Disney and anime rides, Nakamura also used it to construct larger, more elaborate electro-mechanical games. The first of these was &quot;Torpedo Launcher&quot; (1965), a submarine warfare shooting gallery later titled &quot;Periscope&quot;. Its other products included &quot;Ultraman&quot;-themed gun games and pinball-like games branded with &quot;Osomatsu-kun&quot; characters.

The name Namco was introduced in 1971 as a brand for several of its machines. The company grew to having ten employees, which included Nakamura himself. It saw continued success with its arcade games, which had become commonplace in bowling alleys and grocery stores. The company also established a robotics division to produce robots for entertainment centers and festivals, such as those that distributed pamphlets, ribbon making machines, and a robot named Putan that solved pre-built mazes.

In August 1973, American game company Atari began establishing a series of divisions in Asia, one of which was named Atari Japan. Its president, Kenichi Takumi, approached Nakamura in early 1974 to have his business become the distributor of Atari games across Japan. Nakamura, already planning global expansion following his company&#x27;s success, agreed to the deal. In part due to employee theft, Atari Japan was a financial disaster and nearly collapsed in its first few years of operation.

When Takumi stopped showing up to work, the company was handed to Hideyuki Nakajima, a former employee of the Japan Art Paper Company. Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, whose company was already struggling in America, chose to sell the Japanese division. His fixer, Ron Gordon, was given the task of finding the buyer for Atari Japan. After being turned down by Sega and Taito, Gordon&#x27;s offer was accepted by Nakamura for 296 million ($1.18M), though Nakamura informed Bushnell his company was unable to pay the money by the deadline. With no other takers for Atari Japan, Bushnell ultimately allowed Nakamura to only pay $550,000 and then $250,000 a year for three years. The acquisition allowed Nakamura Seisakusho to distribute Atari games across Japan, and would make it one of the country&#x27;s largest arcade game companies.

The Atari Japan purchase was not an immediate success, in part due to the medal game fad of the 1970s. While Nakamura Seisakusho saw some success with imports such as Kee Games&#x27;s &quot;Tank&quot;, the Japanese video game industry&#x27;s decrease in popularity did not make them as profitable as hoped. The market became more viable once restrictions on medal games were imposed by the Japanese government in 1976, as Nakamura Seisakusho began returning higher profits; its import of Atari&#x27;s &quot;Breakout&quot; was so successful that it led to rampant piracy in the industry. By the end of the year, Nakamura Seisakusho was one of Japan&#x27;s leading video game companies.

===Galaxian, Pac-Man, and arcade success (1977–1984)===

Nakamura Seisakusho changed its corporate name to Namco in June 1977. It opened a division in Hong Kong named Namco Enterprises Asia, which maintained video arcades and amusement centers. As Namco&#x27;s presence in Japan was steadily rising, Nakajima suggested to Nakamura that he open a division in the United States to increase worldwide brand awareness. Nakamura agreed to the proposal, and on September 1, 1978, established Namco America in Sunnyvale, California. With Nakajima as its president and Satashi Bhutani as vice president, Namco America&#x27;s aim was to import games and license them to companies such as Atari and Bally Manufacturing. Namco America would release a few non-video arcade games itself, such as &quot;Shoot Away&quot; (1977).

As the video game industry prospered in Japan during the 1970s with the release of Taito&#x27;s &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, Namco turned its attention towards making its own video games. While its licensed Atari games were still profitable, sales were decreasing and the quality of the hardware used began deteriorating. Per the recommendation of company engineer Shigekazu Ishimura, the company retrofitted its Ōta manufacturing facility into a small game division and purchased old stock computers from NEC for employees to study.

Namco released &quot;Gee Bee&quot;, its first original game, in October 1978. Designed by new hire Toru Iwatani, it is a video pinball game that incorporates elements from &quot;Breakout&quot; and similar &quot;block breaker&quot; clones. Though &quot;Gee Bee&quot; fell short of the company&#x27;s sales expectations and was unable to compete with games such as &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, it allowed Namco to gain a stronger foothold in the video game market.

In 1979, Namco published its first major hit &quot;Galaxian&quot;, one of the first video games to incorporate RGB color graphics, score bonuses, and a tilemap hardware model. &quot;Galaxian&quot; is considered historically important for these innovations, and for its mechanics building off those in &quot;Space Invaders&quot;. It was released in North America by Midway Manufacturing, the video game division of Bally, where it became one of its best-selling titles and formed a relationship between Midway and Namco.
The space shooter genre became ubiquitous by the end of the decade, with games such as &quot;Galaxian&quot; and &quot;Space Invaders&quot; becoming commonplace in Japanese amusement centers. As video games often depicted the killing of enemies and shooting of targets, the industry possessed a predominately male playerbase. Toru Iwatani began work on a maze video game that was targeted primarily towards women, with simplistic gameplay and recognizable characters. Alongside a small team, he created a game named &quot;Puck Man&quot;, where players controlled a character that had to eat dots in an enclosed maze while avoiding four ghosts that pursued them.

Iwatani based the gameplay off eating and designed its characters with soft colors and simplistic facial features. &quot;Puck Man&quot; was test-marketed in Japan on May 22, 1980 and given a wide-scale in July. It was only a modest success; players were more accustom to the shooting gameplay of &quot;Galaxian&quot; as opposed to &quot;Puck Man&quot;″s visually distinctive characters and gameplay style. In North America, it was released as &quot;Pac-Man&quot; in November 1980. &quot;Pac-Man&quot;″s simplicity and abstract characters made it a fixture in popular culture, spawning a multi-million-selling media franchise.

Namco regularly released several successful games throughout the early 1980s. It published &quot;Galaga&quot;, the follow-up to &quot;Galaxian&quot;, in 1981 to critical acclaim, usurping its predecessor in popularity with its fast-paced action and power-ups. 1982 saw the release of &quot;Pole Position&quot;, a racing game that is the first to use a real racetrack (the Fuji Speedway) and helped laydown the foundations for the racing genre. It released &quot;Dig Dug&quot; the same year, a maze chaser that allowed players to create their own mazes.

Namco&#x27;s biggest post-&quot;Pac-Man&quot; success was the vertical-scrolling shooter &quot;Xevious&quot; in 1983, designed by new-hire Masanobu Endō. &quot;Xevious&quot;″s early usage of pre-rendered visuals, boss fights, and a cohesive world made it an astounding success in Japan, recording record-breaking sales figures that had not been seen since &quot;Space Invaders&quot;. The game&#x27;s success led to merchandise, tournament play, and the first video game soundtrack album. The same year, Namco released &quot;Mappy&quot;, an early side-scrolling platformer, and the &quot;Pole Position&quot; sequel &quot;Pole Position II&quot;.

Endō went on to design &quot;The Tower of Druaga&quot; a year later, a maze game that helped establish the concept for the action role-playing game. &quot;Druaga&quot;″s design influenced games such as Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;. 1984 also saw the release of &quot;Pac-Land&quot;, a &quot;Pac-Man&quot;-themed platform game that paved the way for similar games such as &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, and &quot;Gaplus&quot;, a moderately successful update to &quot;Galaga&quot;. The success of Namco&#x27;s arcade games prompted it to launch its own print publication, &quot;Namco Community Magazine NG&quot;, to allow its fans to connect with developers.

===Success with home consoles (1984–1989)===

In July 1983, Nintendo released the Family Computer, a video game console that utilized interchangeable cartridges to play games. The console&#x27;s launch came with ports of some of Nintendo&#x27;s popular arcade games, like &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, which at the time were considered high quality. Though Namco recognized the system&#x27;s potential to allow consumers to play accurate versions of its games, the company chose to hold off on the idea after its ports for platforms such as the Sord M5 flopped. Nakamura suggested that his son-in-law, Shigeichi Ishimura, work with a team to reverse-engineer and study the Famicom&#x27;s hardware in the meantime.

His team created a conversion of &quot;Galaxian&quot; with their newfound knowledge of the console&#x27;s capabilities, which exceeded the quality of previous home releases. The port was presented to Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi alongside notification that Namco intended to release it with or without Nintendo&#x27;s approval. Namco&#x27;s demonstration was the impetus for Nintendo&#x27;s decision to create a licensing program for the console. Namco signed a five-year royalties contract that included several preferential terms, such as the ability to produce its own cartridges.

A subsidiary named was established in 1984 to act as Namco&#x27;s console game division. It released its first four titles in September: &quot;Galaxian&quot;, &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, &quot;Xevious&quot;, and &quot;Mappy&quot;. &quot;Xevious&quot; sold over 1.5 million copies and became the Famicom&#x27;s first &quot;killer app&quot;. Namcot also began releasing games for the MSX, a popular Japanese computer. Namco&#x27;s arcade game ports were considered high-quality and helped increase sales of the console.

Namcot was financially successful and became an important pillar within the company; when Namco moved its headquarters to Ōta, Tokyo in 1985, it used the profits generated from the Famicom conversion of &quot;Xevious&quot; to fund its construction (the building was nicknamed &quot;Xevious&quot; as a result). The Talking Aid, a speech impairment device, was part of the company&#x27;s attempts in venturing into other markets.

By the time the Video game crash of 1983 concluded in 1985 with the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), Atari had effectively collapsed. After enduring numerous financial difficulties and losing its control in the industry, parent Warner Communications sold the company&#x27;s personal computer and home console divisions to Commodore International founder Jack Tramiel, who renamed his company Tramel Technology to Atari Corporation. Warner was left with Atari&#x27;s arcade game and computer software divisions, which it renamed Atari Games. Namco America purchased a 60% stake in Atari Games on February 4, 1985 through its AT Games subsidiary, with Warner holding the remaining 40%. The acquisition gave Namco the exclusive rights to distribute Atari games in Japan.

Nakamura began losing interest and patience in Atari Games not long after the acquisition. As he started viewing Atari as a competitor to Namco, he was hesitant to pour additional funds and resources into the company. Nakamura also disliked having to share ownership with Warner Communications. Nakajima grew frustrated with Nakamura&#x27;s attempts at marketing Atari video games in Japan, and had constant disagreements with him over which direction to take the company. Viewing the majority-acquisition as a failure, in 1987 Namco America sold 33% of its ownership stake to a group of Atari Games employees led by Nakajima.

This prompted Nakajima to resign from Namco America and become president of Atari Games. He established Tengen, a publisher that challenged Nintendo&#x27;s licensing restrictions for the NES by selling several unlicensed games, which included ports of Namco arcade games. Though its selloff made Atari Games an independent entity, Namco still held a minority stake in the company and Nakamura retained his position as its board chairman until the middle of 1988.

In Japan, Namco continued to see expeditious growth. It published &quot;Pro Baseball: Family Stadium&quot; for the Famicom, which was critically acclaimed and sold over 2.5 million copies. Its sequel, &quot;Pro Baseball: Family Stadium &#x27;87&quot;, sold an additional two million. In 1986, Namco entered the restaurant industry by acquiring the Italian Tomato café chain. It also released &quot;Sweet Land&quot;, a popular candy-themed prize machine.

One of Namco&#x27;s biggest hits from the era was the racing game &quot;Final Lap&quot; from 1987. It is credited as the first arcade game to allow multiple machines to be connected—or &quot;linked&quot;—together to allow for additional players. &quot;Final Lap&quot; was one of the most-profitable coin-operated games of the era in Japan, remaining towards the top of sales charts for the rest of the decade.

Namco&#x27;s continued success in arcades provided its arcade division with the revenue and resources needed to fund its research and development (R&amp;D) departments. Among their first creations was the helicopter shooter &quot;Metal Hawk&quot; in 1988, fitted in a motion simulator arcade cabinet. Its high development costs prevented it from being massed-produced. While most of its efforts were commercially unsuccessful, Namco grew interested in motion-based arcade games and began designing those at a larger scale. In 1988, Namco became involved in film production when it distributed the film &quot;Mirai Ninja&quot; in theaters, with a tie-in video game coinciding with its release.

Namco also developed the beat &#x27;em up &quot;Splatterhouse&quot;, which attracted attention for its fixture on gore and dismemberment, and &quot;Gator Panic&quot;, a derivative of &quot;Whack-a-Mole&quot; that became a mainstay in Japanese arcades and entertainment centers. In early 1989, Namco unveiled its System 21 arcade system, one of the earliest arcade boards to utilize true 3D polygonal graphics. Nicknamed &quot;Polygonizer&quot;, the company demonstrated its power through the Formula One racer &quot;Winning Run&quot;.

With an arcade cabinet that shook and swayed the player as they drove, the game was seen as &quot;a breakthrough product in term of programming technique&quot; and garnered significant attention from the press. &quot;Winning Run&quot; was commercially successful, convincing Namco to continue researching 3D video game hardware. Video arcades under the Namco banner continued opening up in Japan and overseas, such as the family-friendly Play City Carrot chain.

===Expansion into other markets (1989–1994)===
Namco saw continued success in the consumer game market as a result of the &quot;Famicom boom&quot; in the late 1980s. By 1989, sales of games for the Famicom and NES accounted for 40% of its annual revenue. During the same time frame, the company&#x27;s licensing contract with Nintendo expired; when Namco attempted to renew its license, Nintendo chose to revoke many of the preferential terms it originally possessed. Hiroshi Yamauchi insisted that all companies, including Namco, had to follow the same guidelines.

The revocation of Namco&#x27;s terms enraged Nakamura, who announced the company would abandon Nintendo hardware and focus on production of games for competing systems such as the PC Engine. Executives resisted the idea, fearing it would severely impact the company financially. Against Nakamura&#x27;s protest, Namco signed Nintendo&#x27;s new licensee contract anyway. While it continued to produce games for Nintendo hardware, most of Namco&#x27;s quality releases came from the PC Engine and Mega Drive.

In 1989, it was reported that Namco was underway with developing its own video game console to compete against companies such as Nintendo and NEC. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; claimed that the system, which was nearing completion, featured hardware comparable to the then-upcoming Nintendo Super Famicom. According to company engineer Yutaka Isokawa, it was produced to compete against the Mega Drive, a 16-bit console by Namco&#x27;s arcade rival Sega. With the console industry being crowded by other competing systems, publications were unsure how well it would perform in the market. While the console was never released, it allowed Namco to familiarize itself with designing home video game hardware.

Tadashi Manabe replaced Nakamura as president of Namco on May 2, 1990. Manabe, who had been the company&#x27;s representative director since 1981, was tasked with strengthening relationships and teamwork ethics of management. Two months later, the company dissolved its remaining connections with Atari Games when Time Warner reacquired Namco America&#x27;s remaining 40% stake in Atari Games. In return, Namco America was given Atari&#x27;s video arcade management division, Atari Operations, allowing the company to operate video arcades across the United States. Namco began distributing games in North America directly from its US office, rather than through Atari.

Namco Hometek was established as the home console game division of Namco America; the latter&#x27;s relations with Atari Games and Tengen made the company ineligible to become a Nintendo third-party licensee, instead relying on publishers such as Bandai to release its games in North America. In Japan, Namco developed two theme park attractions, which were demonstrated at the 1990 International Garden and Greenery Exposition (Expo &#x27;90): &quot;Galaxian3: Project Dragoon&quot;, a 3D rail shooter that supported 28 players, and a dark ride based on &quot;The Tower of Druaga&quot;.

As part of the company&#x27;s idea of &quot;hyperentertainment&quot; video games, Namco engineers had drafted ideas for a possible theme park based on Namco&#x27;s experience with designing and operating indoor play areas and entertainment complexes. Both attractions were commercially successful and among the most popular of Expo 90&#x27;s exhibitions. In arcades, Namco released &quot;Starblade&quot;, a 3D rail shooter noteworthy for its cinematic presentation. This led to Namco dominating the Japanese dedicated arcade cabinet charts by October 1991, holding the top six positions that month with &quot;Starblade&quot; at the top.

In February 1992, Namco opened its own theme park, Wonder Eggs, in the Futakotamagawa Time Spark area in Setagaya, Tokyo. Described as an &quot;urban amusement center&quot;, Wonder Eggs was the first amusement park operated by a video game company. In addition to &quot;Galaxian3&quot; and &quot;The Tower of Druaga&quot;, the park featured carnival games, carousels, motion simulators, and &quot;Fighter Camp&quot;, the first flight simulator available to the public. The park saw regularly high attendance numbers; 500,000 visitors attended in its first few months of operation and over one million by the end of the year.

Namco created the park out of its interest in designing a Disneyland-inspired theme park that featured the same kind of stories and characters present in its games. Wonder Eggs contributed to Namco&#x27;s 34% increase in revenue by December 1992. Namco also designed smaller, indoor theme parks for its larger entertainment complexes across the country, such as Plabo Sennichimae Tempo in Osaka.
Manabe resigned as president on May 1, 1992 due to a serious anxiety disorder, and Nakamura once again assumed the role. Manabe instead served as the company&#x27;s vice chairman until his death in 1994. The company&#x27;s arcade division, in the meantime, began work on a new 3D arcade board named System 22, capable of displaying polygonal 3D models with fully-textured graphics. Namco enlisted the help of Evans &amp; Sutherland, a designer of combat flight simulators for The Pentagon, to assist in the board&#x27;s development.

The System 22 powered &quot;Ridge Racer&quot;, a racing game, in 1993. &quot;Ridge Racer&quot; usage of 3D textured polygons and drifting made it a popular title in arcades and one of Namco&#x27;s most-successful releases, and is labeled a milestone in 3D computer graphics. The company followed its success with &quot;Tekken&quot;, a 3D fighting game, a year later. Designed by Seiichi Ishii, the co-creator of Sega&#x27;s landmark fighting game &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;, &quot;Tekken&quot;″s wide array of playable characters and consistent framerate helped it outperform Sega&#x27;s game in popularity, and launched a multi-million-selling franchise as a result.

The company continued expanding its operations overseas, such as the acquisition of Bally&#x27;s Aladdin&#x27;s Castle, Inc., the owners of the Aladdin&#x27;s Castle chain of mall arcades. In December, Namco acquired Nikkatsu, Japan&#x27;s oldest-surviving film studio that at the time was undergoing bankruptcy procedures. The purchase allowed Nikkatsu to utilize Namco&#x27;s computer graphics hardware for its films, while Namco was able to gain a foothold in the Japanese film industry.

===Relationship with Sony (1994–1998)===

In early 1994, Sony announced that it was developing its own video game console, the 32-bit PlayStation. The console began as a collaboration between Nintendo and Sony to create a CD-based peripheral for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1988. Fearing that Sony would assume control of the entire project, Nintendo silently scrapped the add-on. Sony chose to refocus its efforts in designing the PlayStation in-house as its own console.

As it lacked the resources to produce its own games, Sony called for the support of third-party companies to develop PlayStation software. Namco, frustrated with Nintendo and Sega&#x27;s licensing conditions for its consoles, agreed to support the PlayStation and became its first third-party developer. The company began work on a conversion of &quot;Ridge Racer&quot;, its most-popular arcade game at the time.

The PlayStation was released in Japan on December 3, 1994, with &quot;Ridge Racer&quot; as one of its first titles. Sony moved 100,000 units on launch day alone; publications attributed &quot;Ridge Racer&quot; to the PlayStation&#x27;s early success, giving it an edge over its competitor, the Sega Saturn. For a time, it was the best-selling PlayStation game in Japan.

Namcot was consolidated into Namco in 1995; its final game was a PlayStation port of &quot;Tekken&quot;, published in March in Japan and in November worldwide. &quot;Tekken&quot; was designed for Namco&#x27;s System 11 arcade system board, which was based on raw PlayStation hardware; this allowed the home version to be a near-perfect rendition of its arcade counterpart. &quot;Tekken&quot; became the first PlayStation game to sell one million copies and played a vital role in the console&#x27;s mainstream success.

Sony recognized Namco&#x27;s commitment to the console, leading to Namco receiving special treatment from Sony and early promotional material adopting the tagline &quot;PlayStation: Powered by Namco&quot;. Namco was also given the rights to produce controllers, such as the NeGcon, which it designed with the knowledge it gained through developing its cancelled console. Though it had signed contracts to produce games for systems such as the Sega Saturn and 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, Namco concentrated its consumer software efforts on PlayStation for the remainder of the decade.

As a means to draw players into its video arcades, Namco&#x27;s arcade game division began releasing titles that featured unique and novel control styles and gameplay. In 1995, the company released &quot;Alpine Racer&quot;, an alpine skiing game that was awarded &quot;Best New Equipment&quot; during the year&#x27;s Amusement and Music Operators Association (AMOA) exposition. &quot;Time Crisis&quot;, a lightgun shooter noteworthy for its pedal ducking mechanic, helped set the standard for the genre as a whole, while &quot;Prop Cycle&quot; gained notoriety for its usage of a bicycle controller the player pedaled.

The photo booth machine &quot;Star Audition&quot;, which offered players the chance of becoming a star in the show business, became a media sensation in Japan. Namco Operations, which was renamed Namco Cybertainment in 1996, acquired the Edison Brothers Stores arcade chain in April. Namco also introduced the Postpaid System, a centralized card payment system, as a means to combat the piracy of IC Cards in Japanese arcades.

In September 1997, Namco announced it would begin development of games for the Nintendo 64, a console struggling to receive support from third-party developers. Namco signed a contract with Nintendo that allowed the company to produce two games for the console: &quot;Famista 64&quot;, a version of its &quot;Family Stadium&quot; series, and an untitled RPG for the 64DD peripheral. The RPG was never released while the 64DD went on to become a commercial failure. In October 1998, which one publication described as being &quot;the most stunning alliance this industry has seen in a long while&quot;, Namco announced a partnership deal with long-time rival Sega to bring some of its titles to the newly unveiled Dreamcast.

As Namco primarily developed games for Sony hardware, and were among the biggest third-party developers for the PlayStation, the announcement surprised news outlets. For its PlayStation-based System 12 arcade board, Namco released the weapon-based fighting game &quot;Soul Edge&quot; a couple years back in 1996. Its 1999 Dreamcast sequel, which features multiple graphical enhancements and new game modes, is an early instance of a console game being better than its arcade version. &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; sold over one million units, won multiple awards, and contributed to the early success of the Dreamcast.

===Financial decline and restructuring (1998–2005)===
Namco began experiencing decline in its consumer software sales by 1998 as a result of the Japanese recession, which affected the demand for video games as consumers had less time to play them. The company&#x27;s arcade division had similar struggles, having slumped by 21% at the end of its fiscal year ending March 1998. Namco Cybertainment filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on January 29, 1998, citing reduced mall traffic, though they planned to close fewer than 50 of their 370 mall locations during the bankruptcy reorganization and even open new locations. In its 1998 annual report, Namco reported a 26.3% drop in net sales, which it partly blamed on low consumer spending.

A further 55% drop was reported in November 1999 when its home console game output decreased. As a means to diversify itself from its arcade and consumer game markets, Namco entered the mobile phone game market with the Namco Station, a marketplace for i-Mode cellular devices that featured ports of its arcade games like &quot;Pac-Man&quot; and &quot;Galaxian&quot;. The company also majority-acquired Monolith Soft, an action role-playing game developer best known for creating the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; series. It continued introducing novel concepts for arcades to help attract players, such as the Cyber Lead II, an arcade cabinet that features PlayStation and Dreamcast VMU memory card slots.
Namco&#x27;s financial losses worsened in the 2000s. In October 2000, the Japanese newspaper &quot;Nihon Keizai Shimbun&quot; reported that the company projected a loss of 2.1 billion ($19.3M) for the fiscal year ending March 2001. Namco had previously hinted at this during an event with industry analysts, blaming its struggles on the depressed Japanese economy and dwindling arcade game market. The company closed its Wonder Eggs park on December 31, 2000, which by that point saw an attendance number of six million visitors, in addition to shuttering many of its video arcades that returned substandard profits.

In February 2001, Namco updated its projections and reported it now expected a 6.5 billion ($56.3M) net loss and a drop in revenue by 95% for the fiscal year ending March 2001, which severely impacted the company&#x27;s release schedule and corporate structure. The company&#x27;s earnings forecasts were lowered to accommodate its losses, its development strategy was reorganized to focus largely on established franchises, and 250 of its employees were laid off in what it described as &quot;early retirement&quot;. Namco underwent restructuring to increase its income, which included the shuffling of its management and the announcement of production of games for Nintendo&#x27;s GameCube and Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox.

Following its financial struggles, Namco&#x27;s arcade division underwent mass reorganization. This division achieved strong success with &quot;Taiko no Tatsujin&quot;, a popular drum-based rhythm game where players hit a taiko drum controller to the beat of a song. &quot;Taiko no Tatsujin&quot; became a best-seller and created one of the company&#x27;s most popular and prolific franchises. Namco&#x27;s North American divisions, in the meantime, underwent reorganization and restructuring as a result of decreasing profits.

Namco Hometek was stripped of its research and development divisions following Namco&#x27;s disappointment in the quality of its releases. Its continuing expansion into other non-video game divisions, including rehabilitation electronics and travel agency websites, prompted the creation of the Namco Incubation Center, which would control these businesses. The Incubation Center also hosted the Namco Digital Hollywood Game Laboratory game school, which designed the sleeper hit &quot;Katamari Damacy&quot; (2004).

Nakamura resigned as company president later in the year, being replaced with Kyushiro Takagi. Anxious about the company&#x27;s continuing financial struggles, Nakamura suggested that Namco begin looking into the possibility of merging with another company. Namco first looked to &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; developer Square and &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; publisher Enix, offering to combine the three companies into one. Yoichi Wada, the president of Square, disliked Namco&#x27;s financial showing and declined the offer. Square instead agreed to a business alliance with Namco. Following this, Namco then approached Sega, a company struggling to stay afloat after the commercial failure of the Dreamcast.

Sega&#x27;s development teams and extensive catalog of properties caught Namco&#x27;s interest, and believed a merge could allow the two to increase their competitiveness. Sega was already discussing a merge with pachinko manufacturer Sammy Corporation; executives at Sammy were infuriated at Sega&#x27;s consideration of Namco&#x27;s offer. A failed attempt to overturn the merge led Namco to withdraw its offer the same day Sega announced it turned down Sammy&#x27;s. While Namco stated it was willing to negotiate with Sega on a future deal, Sega turned down the idea.

Shigeichi Ishimura, the son in-law of Nakamura, succeeded Takagi as Namco president on April 1, 2005; Nakamura retained his role as the company&#x27;s executive chairman. This was part of Namco&#x27;s continuing efforts at reorganizing itself to be in line with changing markets. On July 26, as part of its 50th anniversary event, Namco published &quot;NamCollection&quot;—a compilation of several of its PlayStation games—for the PlayStation 2 in Japan.

Namco also opened the Riraku no Mori, a companion to its Namja Town park that held massage parlors for visitors; Namco believed it would help make relaxation a source of entertainment. &quot;The Idolmaster&quot;, a rhythm game that incorporated elements of life simulations, was widely successful in Japan and resulted in the creation of a multi-million-grossing franchise.

===Bandai takeover and dissolution (2005–2006)===
In early 2005, Namco began merger talks with Bandai, a toy and anime company. The two discussed a year prior about a possible business alliance after Namco collaborated with Bandai subsidiary Banpresto to create an arcade game based on &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;. Bandai showed interest in Namco&#x27;s game development skills and believed combining this with its wide library of profitable characters and franchises, such as &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; and &quot;Tamagotchi&quot;, could increase their competitiveness in the industry.

Nakamura and Namco&#x27;s content development division advisors pushed against the idea, as they felt Bandai&#x27;s corporate model would not blend well with Namco&#x27;s more agricultural work environment. Namco&#x27;s advisors were also critical of Bandai for focusing on promotion and marketing over quality. As Namco&#x27;s financial state continued to deteriorate, Ishimura pressured Nakamura into supporting the merger. Bandai&#x27;s offer was accepted on May 2, with both companies stating in a joint statement their financial difficulties were the reason for the merger.

The business takeover, where Bandai acquired Namco for 175.3 billion ($1.7B), was finalized on September 29. An entertainment conglomerate named Namco Bandai Holdings was established the same day; while their executive departments merged, Bandai and Namco became independently-operating subsidiaries of the new umbrella holding company. Kyushiro Takagi, Namco&#x27;s vice chairman, was appointed chairman and director of Namco Bandai Holdings. The combined revenues of the new company were estimated to be 458 billion ($4.34B), making Namco Bandai the third-largest Japanese game company after Nintendo and Sega Sammy Holdings.

As its parent company was preparing for a full business integration, Namco continued its normal operations, such as releasing &quot;Ridge Racer 6&quot; as a launch title for the newly-unveiled Xbox 360 in October and collaborating with Nintendo to produce the arcade game &quot;Mario Kart Arcade GP&quot;. The company honored the 25th anniversary of its &quot;Pac-Man&quot; series with &quot;Pac-Pix&quot;, a puzzle game for the Nintendo DS, and entered the massively multiplayer online game market with &quot;Tales of Eternia Online&quot;, an action role-playing game based on its &quot;Tales&quot; franchise.
On January 4, 2006, Namco Hometek was merged with Bandai Games—Bandai America&#x27;s consumer game division—to create Namco Bandai Games America, absorbing Namco America&#x27;s subsidiaries and completing Namco and Bandai&#x27;s merge in North America. Namco&#x27;s console game, business program, mobile phone, and research facility divisions were merged with Bandai&#x27;s console division to create a new company, Namco Bandai Games, on March 31, as Namco was effectively dissolved.

The Namco name was repurposed for a new Namco Bandai subsidiary the same day, which absorbed its predecessor&#x27;s amusement facility and theme park operations. Namco&#x27;s European division was folded into Namco Bandai Networks Europe on January 1, 2007, as it was reorganized into the company&#x27;s mobile game and website division. Until April 2014, Namco Bandai Games used the Namco logo on its games to represent the brand&#x27;s legacy.

The Namco Cybertainment division was renamed Namco Entertainment in January 2012, and to Namco USA in 2015. A division of Bandai Namco Holdings USA, Namco USA worked with chains such as AMC Theatres to host its video arcades in their respective locations. The second Namco company was renamed Bandai Namco Amusement on April 1, 2018 following a corporate restructuring by its parent. Amusement took over the arcade game development branch of Bandai Namco Games, which renamed itself to Bandai Namco Entertainment in 2015.

Namco USA was absorbed into Bandai Namco Amusement&#x27;s North American branch in 2021 following its parent company&#x27;s decision to exit the arcade management industry in the United States. This makes Namco Enterprises Asia and Namco Funscape―Bandai Namco&#x27;s arcade division in Europe―the last companies to use the original Namco trademark in their names. Bandai Namco Holdings and its subsidiaries continue to use the Namco name for a variety of products, including mobile phone applications, streaming programs, and eSports-focused arcade centers in Japan.

==Legacy==
Namco was one of the world&#x27;s largest producers of video arcade games, having published over 300 titles since 1978. Many of its games are considered some of the greatest of all time, including &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, &quot;Galaga&quot;, &quot;Xevious&quot;, &quot;Ridge Racer&quot;, &quot;Tekken 3&quot;, and &quot;Katamari Damacy&quot;.

&quot;Pac-Man&quot; is considered one of the most important video games ever made, having helped encourage originality and creative thinking within the industry. Namco was recognized for the game&#x27;s worldwide success in 2005 by Guinness World Records; by that timeframe, &quot;Pac-Man&quot; sold over 300,000 arcade units and grossed over $1 billion in quarters globally. In an obituary for Masaya Nakamura in 2017, &quot;Nintendo Life&quot;″s Damien McFerran wrote: &quot;without Namco and &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, the video game arena would be very different today.&quot;

Namco&#x27;s corporate philosophy and innovation have received recognition from publications. In a 1994 retrospective on the company, a writer for &quot;Edge&quot; described Namco as being &quot;among the true pioneers of the coin-op business&quot;, a developer with a catalog of well-received and historically significant titles. The writer believed that Namco&#x27;s success lay in its forward-thinking and firmness on quality, which they argued made it stand out from other developers. A staff member of &quot;Edge&quot;″s sister publication, &quot;Next Generation&quot;, wrote in 1998: &quot;In a world where today&#x27;s stars almost always become tomorrow&#x27;s has-beens, Namco has produced consistently excellent games throughout most of its history.&quot; The writer credited the company&#x27;s connections with its players and its influential releases, namely &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, &quot;Xevious&quot;, and &quot;Winning Run&quot;, as the keys to its success in a rapidly changing industry.

Publications and industry journalists have identified Namco&#x27;s importance to the industry. Hirokazu Hamamura, chief editor of &quot;Famitsu&quot;, credited the company&#x27;s quality releases to the rise in popularity of video game consoles, and, in turn, the entirety of Japan&#x27;s video game industry. Writers for &quot;Ultimate Future Games&quot; and &quot;Official UK PlayStation Magazine&quot; have credited the company and its games to the early success of the PlayStation, one of the most iconic entertainment brands worldwide. In addition, &quot;Official UK PlayStation Magazine&quot; wrote that Namco serves as &quot;the godfather of game developers&quot;, and one of the most important video game developers in history.

Staff for &quot;IGN&quot; in 1997 claimed that Namco represents the industry as a whole, with titles like &quot;Pac-Man&quot; and &quot;Galaga&quot; being associated with and representing video games. They wrote: &quot;Tracing the history of Namco is like tracing the history of the industry itself. From its humble beginnings on the roof of a Yokohama department store, to the impending release of &quot;Tekken 3&quot; for the PlayStation, Namco has always stayed ahead of the pack.&quot; In 2012, &quot;IGN&quot; listed Namco among the greatest video game companies of all time, writing that many of its games—including &quot;Galaga&quot;, &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, &quot;Dig Dug&quot;, and &quot;Ridge Racer&quot;—were of consistent quality and helped define the industry as a whole.

<doc id="300210" wikidata="Q1125408" url="?curid=300210" title="Armed Islamic Group of Algeria">
<text>The Armed Islamic Group (GIA, from ; ) was one of the two main Islamist insurgent groups that fought the Algerian government and army in the Algerian Civil War.

It was created from smaller armed groups following the 1992 military coup and arrest and internment of thousands of officials in the Islamist Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) party after that party won the first round of parliamentary elections in December 1991. It was led by a succession of &quot;amirs&quot; (commanders) who were killed or arrested one after another. Unlike the other main armed groups, the Mouvement Islamique Armé (MIA) and later the Islamic Salvation Army (AIS), in its pursuit of an Islamic state the GIA sought not to pressure the government into concessions but to destabilise and overthrow it, to &quot;purge the land of the ungodly&quot;. Its slogan inscribed on all communiques was: &quot;no agreement, no truce, no dialogue&quot;. GIA&#x27;s ideology was inspired by the Jihadist writings of the Egyptian Islamist scholar Sayyid Qutb.

The group desired to create &quot;an atmosphere of general insecurity&quot; and employed kidnapping, assassination, and bombings, including car bombs and targeted not only security forces but civilians. Between 1992 and 1998, the GIA conducted a violent campaign of civilian massacres, sometimes wiping out entire villages in its area of operation (notably those in Bentalha and Rais). It attacked and killed other Islamists who had left the GIA or attempted to negotiate with the government. It also targeted foreign civilians living in Algeria, killing more than 100 expatriate men and women in the country.

The group established a presence outside Algeria, in France, Belgium, Britain, Italy and the United States, and launched terror attacks in France in 1994 and 1995. The &quot;undisputed principal Islamist force&quot; in Algeria in 1994, by 1996, militants were deserting &quot;in droves&quot;, alienated by its execution of civilians and Islamist leaders.

In 1999, a government amnesty law motivated large numbers of jihadis to &quot;repent&quot;. The remnants of the GIA proper were hunted down over the next two years, leaving a splinter group the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), which announced its support for Al-Qaeda in October 2003. The extent to which the group was infiltrated and manipulated by Algerian security services is disputed.

The GIA is considered a terrorist organisation by the governments of Algeria, France, the United States, Argentina, Bahrain, Japan, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United Nations. The GIA remains a Proscribed Organisation in the United Kingdom under the Terrorism Act 2000. Canada once listed GIA as a terrorist entity until 18 June 2024. 

==History==
===Founding===
According to Algerian veterans of the Afghan jihad who founded the GIA, the idea of forming an armed group to fight jihad against the Algerian government was developed not after the coup but in 1989 after leaders of the Islamic Armed Movement (MIA) of Mustafa Bouyali, were freed from prison, but was not acted on due to the spectacular electoral political success of the FIS. Embracing Sayyid Qutb&#x27;s &quot;Takfir&quot; (excommunication) of secular governments and assertion that engaging in armed &quot;Jihad&quot; against &quot;Jaahili&quot; societies was mandatory; GIA leaders condemned the FLN regime as apostates and called upon Algerians to rise up, pledge allegiance to them and violently overthrow the socialist government in pursuit of establishing an Islamic state in Algeria. Support base of the GIA mainly consisted of the educationally and economically underprivileged classes of the Algerian society.

Early in 1992, Mansour Meliani, a former aid to Bouyali, along with many &quot;Afghans&quot;, broke with his former friend Abdelkader Heresay and left the MIA (Islamic Armed Movement), founding his own Jihadi group around July 1992. Meliani was arrested in July and executed in August 1993. Meliani was replaced by Mohammed Allal, aka Moh Leveilley, who was killed on 1 September 1992 by the Algerian military when they attacked a meeting held to unify command of the jihad.

The economic state of Algeria was in a dire situation, where the majority of the young people were unemployed. In Algeria, there was no middle class, there were the rich and there were the poor, leaving many young people no hope for the future. The GIA was able to act as a place for young men to feel a part of something larger.

====Abdelhak Layada====
Leveilley was replaced in January 1993 by Abdelhak Layada, who declared his group independent of the FIS and MIA and not obedient to its orders. It adopted the radical Omar El-Eulmi as a spiritual guide, and Layada affirmed that &quot;political pluralism is equivalent to sedition&quot;. He also believed jihad in Algeria was &quot;fard ayn&quot;, or an individual obligation of adult male Muslims. Layada threatened not just security forces but journalists (&quot;grandsons of France&quot;) and the families of Algerian soldiers. From its inception on, the GIA called for and implemented the killing of anyone collaborating with or supporting the authorities, including government employees such as teachers and civil servants. 
Layada did not last long and was arrested in Morocco in May 1993.

Besides the GIA, the other major branch of the Algerian resistance was the Islamic Armed Movement (MIA). It was led by the ex-soldier &quot;General&quot; Abdelkader Chebouti, and was &quot;well-organized and structured and favored a long-term jihad&quot; targeting the state and its representatives and based on a guerrilla campaign like that of the War of Independence. From prison, Ali Benhadj issued a fatwa giving the MIA his blessing. In March 2006, Abdelhak Layada was released from prison, amnesty measures provided for in the Charter for Peace and Reconciliation launched by the president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, even offering himself as a mediator to seek a truce between the government and the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat.

====Djafar al-Afghani====
On August 21, 1993, Seif Allah Djafar, aka Mourad Si Ahmed, aka Djafar al-Afghani, a 30-year-old black marketer with no education beyond primary school, became GIA amir. Violence escalated under Djafar, as did the GIA&#x27;s base of support outside of Algeria.
Under him, the group named and assassinated specific journalists and intellectuals (such as Tahar Djaout), saying that &quot;The journalists who fight against Islamism through the pen will perish by the sword.&quot; 
The GIA explicitly affirmed that it &quot;did not represent the armed wing of the FIS&quot;, and issued death threats against several FIS and MIA members, including MIA&#x27;s Heresay and FIS&#x27;s Kebir and Redjam.

About the time al-Afghani took power of GIA, a group of Algerian jihadists returning from Afghanistan came to London. Together with Islamist intellectual Abu Qatada, they started up a weekly magazine, &quot;Usrat al-Ansar&quot; as a GIA propaganda outlet. Abu Qatada &quot;provided the intellectual and ideological firepower&quot; to justify GIA actions, and the journal became &quot;a trusted source of news and information about the GIA for Islamists around the world.&quot;

The GIA soon broadened its attacks to civilians who refused to live by their prohibitions, and then foreigners living in Algeria. A hostage released on 31 October 1993 carried a message ordering foreigners to &quot;leave the country. We are giving you one month. Anyone who exceeds that period will be responsible for his own sudden death.&quot; By the end of 1993 26 foreigners had been killed.

In November 1993 Sheik Mohamed Bouslimani &quot;a popular figure who was prominent&quot; in Hamas party of Mahfoud Nahnah was kidnapped and executed after &quot;refusing to issue a fatwa endorsing the GIA&#x27;s tactics.&quot;

Djafar was killed by French security forces on December 26, 1994 during the raid on Air France flight 8969.

====Cherif Gousmi====

Cherif Gousmi, aka Abu Abdallah Ahmed, became amir March 10, 1994. Under him, the GIA reached its &quot;high water mark&quot;, and became the &quot;undisputed principal Islamist force&quot; in Algeria. In May, Islamist leaders Abderrezak Redjam (allegedly representing the FIS), Mohammed Said, the exiled Anwar Haddam, and the MEI&#x27;s Said Makhloufi joined the GIA; a blow to the FIS and surprise since the GIA had been issuing death threats against the three since November 1993. This was interpreted by many observers as either the result of intra-FIS competition or as an attempt to change the GIA&#x27;s course from within. On 26 August, the group declared a &quot;Caliphate&quot;, or Islamic government for Algeria, with Gousmi as Commander of the Faithful, Mohammed Said as head of government, the US-based Haddam as foreign minister, and Mekhloufi as provisional interior minister.

However, the very next day Said Mekhloufi announced his withdrawal from the GIA, claiming that the GIA had deviated from Islam and that this &quot;Caliphate&quot; was an effort by Mohammed Said to take over the GIA, and Haddam soon afterwards denied ever having joined it, asserting that this Caliphate was an invention of the security services. The GIA continued attacking its usual targets, notably assassinating artists, such as Cheb Hasni, and in late August added a new one to its list, threatening schools which allowed mixed classes, music, gym for girls, or not wearing hijab with arson. He was killed in combat on September 26, 1994.

====Djamel Zitouni====

Cherif Gousmi was eventually succeeded by Djamel Zitouni who became GIA head on October 27, 1994. He was the responsible for carrying out a series of bombings in France in 1995. He was killed by a rival faction on July 16, 1996.

====Antar Zouabri and takfir====
Antar Zouabri, was the longest serving &quot;emir&quot; (1996–2002) was nominated by a faction of the GIA &quot;considered questionable by the others&quot;. The 26-year-old activist was a &quot;close confidant&quot; of Zitouni and continued his policy of &quot;ever increasing violence and redoubled purges&quot;. Zouabri opened his reign as emir by issuing a manifesto entitled &quot;The Sharp Sword&quot;, presenting Algerian society as resistant to jihad and lamented that the majority of the people had &quot;forsaken religion and renounced the battle against its enemies,&quot; but was careful to deny that the GIA had ever accused Algerian society itself of impiety (&quot;kufr&quot;).

Convinced of Zouabri&#x27;s salafist orthodoxy, Egyptian veteran of the Afghan jihad Abu Hamza restarted the Al-Ansar bulletin/magazine in London. 
During the month of Ramadan (January–February 1997) hundreds of civilians were killed in massacres some with their throats cut. The massacres continued for months and culminated in August and September when hundreds of men women and children were killed in the villages of Rais, Bentalha, Beni Messous. Pregnant women were sliced open, children were hacked to pieces or dashed against walls, men&#x27;s limbs were hacked off one by one, and, as the attackers retreated, they would kidnap young women to keep as sex slaves. The GIA issued a communiques signed by Zouabri claiming responsibility for the massacres and justifying them—in contradiction to his manifesto—by declaring impious (takfir) all those Algerians who had not joined its ranks. In London Abu Hamzu criticised the communique and two days later (September 29) announced the end of his support and the closure of the bulletin, cutting off GIA&#x27;s communication with international Islamist community and the rest of the outside world. In Algeria, the slaughters drained the GIA of popular support (although evidence showed security forces cooperated with the killers preventing civilians from escaping, and may even have controlled the GIA). A week earlier the AIS insurgents announced it would declare a unilateral truce starting in October. 
These events marked the end of &quot;organized jihad in Algeria,&quot; according to one source (Gilles Kepel)

Although Zouabri was seldom heard of after this and the jihad exhausted, massacres &quot;continued unabated&quot; through 1998 led by independent amirs with added &quot;ingredients of vendetta and local dispute&quot; to the putative jihad against the government. Armed groups &quot;that had formerly belonged to the GIA&quot; continued to kill, some replacing jihad with simple banditry, others settling scores with the pro-government &quot;patriots&quot; or others, some enlisting themselves in the services of landowners and frightening illegal occupants off of property.

In 1999 the &quot;Law on Civil Concord&quot; granting amnesty to fighters was officially rejected by the GIA but accepted by many rank-and-file Islamist fighters; an estimated 85 percent surrendered their arms and returned to civilian life.

The Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC) splinter faction appears to have eclipsed the GIA since approximately 1998 and is currently assessed by the CIA to be the most effective armed group remaining inside Algeria. Both the GIA and GSPC leadership continue to proclaim their rejection of President Bouteflika&#x27;s amnesty, but in contrast to the GIA, the GSPC has stated that it avoids attacks on civilians.

Zouabri was himself killed in a gun battle with security forces 9 February 2002. The GIA, torn by splits and desertions and denounced by all sides even in the Islamist movement, was slowly destroyed by army operations over the next few years; by the time of Antar Zouabri&#x27;s death it was effectively incapacitated.

===The GIA and Violence===

In Algeria, the desire to have a violent and armed version of Islamism wasn&#x27;t the primary mode of action for the GIA. There was no idea to use violence as a notion of sacrifice or martyrdom, which is quite common in other Islamist groups. In this case, the GIA used violence as an instrument of change to have a social transformation within Algeria. The state, in the eyes of the GIA, was an enemy of Islam. There was a rhetoric that the state was the incarnation of taghout. In order to destroy it, they would use a strategy of organized rural and urban guerrillas. The society backed fighters would have the capabilities to overthrow the state and create a new regime based on Sharia law.

In order to destabilize the state, the GIA instigated terror throughout the country. Using acts of violence such as planned assassinations, vehicle bombings, kidnappings. They often attacked members of the Algerian army and the police force. As time passed the GIA did not limit their violence to only stately officials. They used violence as a means of social control on the civilian population as well. They would commit theatrical assassinations in front of large groups of people so they could spread fear and have people support their cause. Two notable assassinations by the GIA was the assassination of Abdelkader Alloula, a theater director in Algeria and Cheb Hasni the most popular Raï music singer.

===Endgame===
In 1999, following the election of a new president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, a new law gave amnesty to most guerrillas, motivating large numbers to &quot;repent&quot; and return to normal life. The violence declined substantially after Antar Zouabri was killed in 2002, Rachid Abou Tourab succeeded him and was allegedly killed by close aides in July 2004. He was replaced by Boulenouar Oukil. By 2004, GIA membership had dwindled, and they only had around 30 members left. On 7 April 2005, the GIA was reported to have killed 14 civilians at a fake road block. Three weeks later on 29 April, Oukil was arrested. Nourredine Boudiafi was the last known &quot;emir&quot; of the GIA. He was arrested sometime in November 2004, his arrest was announced by the Algerian government in January 2005.

A splinter group of the GIA that formed on the fringes of Kabylie (north central coast) in 1998, called the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), rejected the amnesty. It dissociated itself from the previous indiscriminate killing of civilians and reverted to the classic MIA-AIS tactics of targeting combatant forces. This break away was led by Hassan Hattab. In October 2003, they announced their support for Al-Qaeda and in 2006, Ayman al-Zawahiri announced a &quot;blessed union&quot; between the two groups. In 2007, the group changed its name to Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. It has focused on kidnapping for ransom as a means of raising funds and is estimated to have raised more than $50 million from 2003 to 2013.

==Claims of Algerian Government involvement==
Various claims have been made that the GIA was heavily infiltrated at top level by agents of Algerian intelligence such as the Département du Renseignement et de la Sécurité (DRS), who drove the organisation towards excessive violence against civilians in order to undermine its popular support.

According to Heba Saleh of BBC News,

Algerian opposition sources allege that the group may have been manipulated at times by elements within ruling military and intelligence circles. A series of massacres in the summer of 1997 - in which many hundreds of people were killed - took place near Algerian army barracks, but no-one came to the help of the victims.

Fouad Ajami writing in &quot;The New Republic&quot; in 2010: called the GIA &quot;a bastard child of the encounter between the Islamists and the security services of the regime.&quot; John Schindler in &quot;The National Interest&quot; stated, &quot;Much of GIA&#x27;s leadership consisted of DRS agents, who drove the group into the dead end of mass murder&quot;

Another source, journalist Nafeez Ahmed claims that &#x27;Yussuf-Joseph&#x27;—an anonymous 14-year &quot;career secret agent&quot; in Algeria&#x27;s sécurité militaire who defected to Britain in 1997 and claims to have had access to &quot;all the secret telexes&quot;—told Ahmed that GIA atrocities were not the work of &#x27;Islamic extremists&#x27;, but were &#x27;orchestrated&#x27; by &#x27;Mohammed Mediane, head of the Algerian secret service&#x27;, and &#x27;General Smain Lamari&#x27;, head of &#x27;the counter intelligence agency&#x27; and ... &#x27;In 1992 Smain created a special group, L&#x27;Escadron de la Mort (the Squadron of Death)... The death squads organized the massacres ... &#x27; including &#x27;at least&#x27; two of the bombs in Paris in summer 1995. That operation was (allegedly) &#x27;run by Colonel Souames Mahmoud, alias Habib, head of the secret service at the Algerian embassy in Paris.&#x27; 
According to Ahmed, &quot;Joseph&#x27;s testimony has been corroborated by numerous defectors from the Algerian secret services.&quot; (Ahmed also claims that the &quot;British intelligence believed the Algerian Government was involved in atrocities, contradicting the view the Government was claiming in public&quot;.)

However, according to Andrew Whitley of Human Rights Watch, &quot;It was clear that armed Islamist groups were responsible for many of the killings of both civilians and security force members that had been attributed to them by the authorities. According to &quot;the Shadow Report on Algeria&quot;, Algerians such as Zazi Sadou, have collected testimonies by survivors that their attackers were unmasked and were recognised as local radicals - in one case even an elected member of the FIS.

According to Max Abrahms, &quot;the false flag allegation arose because the civilian attacks hurt the GIA—not because of any evidence&quot; to support it. Abrahms describes the proliferation of false flag conspiracy theories, such as 9/11 conspiracy theories, as a commonplace reaction to the generally counterproductive effects of terrorist violence, but notes that it is a fallacy to assume that the perpetrators and beneficiaries of terrorism must be the same. Abrahms cites Mohammed Hafez, an academic expert on the subject who concluded: &quot;The evidence does not support the claim that security forces were the principal culprits behind the massacres, or even willing conspirators in the barbaric violence against civilians. Instead, the evidence points to the GIA as the principal perpetrator of the massacres.&quot;

<doc id="300213" wikidata="Q1431070" url="?curid=300213" title="Napier Deltic">
<text>The Napier Deltic engine is a British opposed-piston valveless, supercharged uniflow scavenged, two-stroke diesel engine used in marine and locomotive applications, designed and produced by D. Napier &amp; Son. Unusually, the cylinders were disposed in a three-bank triangle, with a crankshaft at each corner of the triangle.

The term Deltic (meaning &quot;in the form of the Greek letter (capital) delta&quot;) is used to refer to both the Deltic E.130 opposed-piston, high-speed diesel engine and the locomotives produced by English Electric using these engines, including its demonstrator locomotive named &quot;DELTIC&quot; and the production version for British Railways, which designated these as the Class 55.

A single, half-sized, turbocharged Deltic power unit also featured in the English Electric-built Type 2 locomotive, designated as the Class 23. Both locomotive and engine became better known as the &quot;Baby Deltic&quot;.

==History and design==
The Deltic story began in 1943 when the British Admiralty set up a committee to develop a high-power, lightweight diesel engine for motor torpedo boats. Hitherto in the Royal Navy, such boats had been driven by petrol engines, but their highly flammable fuel made them vulnerable to fire, unlike diesel-powered E-boats. A patent for an engine, similar in complexity, but with four lines of pistons, not just three, was filed in 1930 by Wifredo Ricart, linked to Alfa Romeo, and to the Spanish INI truck maker Pegaso, Pat ES0118013.

Until this time, diesel engines had poor power-to-weight ratios and low speed. Before the war, Napier had been working on an aviation diesel design known as the Culverin after licensing versions of the Junkers Jumo 204. The Culverin was an opposed-piston, two-stroke design. Instead of each cylinder having a single piston and being closed at one end with a cylinder head, the Jumo-based design used an elongated cylinder containing two pistons moving in opposite directions towards the centre. This obviates the need for a heavy cylinder head, as the opposing piston filled this role. On the downside, the layout required separate crankshafts on each end of the engine that must be coupled through gearing or shafts. The primary advantages of the design were uniflow breathing and a rather &quot;flat&quot; engine.

The Admiralty required a much more powerful engine, and knew about Junkers&#x27; designs for multicrankshaft engines of straight-six and diamond forms. The Admiralty felt that these would be a reasonable starting point for the larger design that it required. The result was a triangle, the cylinder banks forming the sides, with crankshafts at each corner connected by phasing gears to a single output shaft—effectively three separate V-12 engines. The Deltic could be produced with varying numbers of cylinders; 9 and 18 were the most common, having either three or six cylinders per bank, respectively. In 1946, the Admiralty placed a contract with the English Electric Company, parent of Napier, to develop this engine.

One feature of the engine was the way that crankshaft-phasing was arranged to allow for exhaust port lead and inlet port lag. These engines are called &quot;uniflow&quot; designs, because the flow of gas into and out of the cylinder is one way, assisted by blowers to improve cylinder exhaust scavenging. The inlet/outlet port order is in/out/in/out/in/out going around the triangular ring (i.e. the inlet and outlet manifold arrangements have C3 rotational symmetry).

Earlier attempts at designing such an engine met with the difficulty of arranging the pistons to move in the correct manner, for all three cylinders in one delta, and this was the problem that caused Junkers Motorenbau to leave behind work on the delta-form while continuing to prototype a diamond-form, four-crankshaft, 24-cylinder Junkers Jumo 223. Herbert Penwarden, a senior draughtsman with the Admiralty Engineering Laboratory, suggested that one crankshaft needed to revolve anticlockwise to achieve the correct piston-phasing, so Napier designers produced the necessary gearing so one of them rotated in the opposite direction to the other two.

Being an opposed-piston design with no inlet or exhaust valves, and no ability to vary the port positions, the Deltic design arranged each crankshaft to connect two adjacent pistons operating in different cylinders in the same plane, using &quot;fork and blade&quot; connecting rods, the latter an &quot;inlet&quot; piston used to open and close the inlet port, and the former an &quot;exhaust&quot; piston in the adjacent cylinder to open and close the exhaust port. This would have led the firing in each bank of cylinders to be 60° apart, but arranging that each cylinder&#x27;s exhaust piston would lead its inlet piston by 20° of crankshaft rotation was adopted. This allowed the exhaust port to be opened well before the inlet port, and allowed the inlet port to be closed after the exhaust port, which led to both good scavenging of exhaust gas and good volumetric efficiency for the fresh air charge. This required the firing events for adjacent cylinders to be 40° apart. For the 18-cylinder design, firing events could be interlaced over all six banks. This led to the even, buzzing exhaust note of the Deltic, with a charge ignition every 20° of crankshaft revolution, and a lack of torsional vibration, ideal for use in mine-hunting vessels. The 9-cylinder design, having three banks of cylinders, has its crankshafts rotating in the opposite direction. The exhaust lead of 20° is added to the 60° between banks, giving firing events for adjacent cylinders in the same bank 80° apart. Interlacing firing events over all three banks of cylinders still leads to an even buzzing exhaust note, and charge ignition occurring every 40° of crankshaft revolution with consequent reduction of torsional vibration.

Although the engine was cylinder-ported and required no poppet valves, each bank had a camshaft, driven at crankshaft speed. This was used solely to drive the fuel-injection pumps, each cylinder having its own injector and pump, driven by its own cam lobe.

== Uses ==

=== Naval service ===
Development began in 1947 and the first Deltic model was the D18-11B, produced in 1950. It was designed to produce at 2000 rpm for a 15-minute rating; the continuous rating being at 1700 rpm, based on a 10,000-hour overhaul or replacement life. By January 1952 six engines were available, enough for full development and endurance trials. A captured German E-Boat, S212 was selected as it was powered by Mercedes-Benz diesels with approximately the same power as the 18-cylinder Deltics. When two of the three Mercedes-Benz engines were replaced, the compactness of the Napier engines was graphically illustrated—they were half the size of the original engines and approximately one fifth the weight.

Proving successful, Deltic Diesel engines became a common power plant in small and fast naval craft. The Royal Navy used them first in the fast attack craft. Subsequently they were used in a number of other smaller attack craft. Being largely of aluminium construction, their low magnetic signature allowed their use in mine countermeasures vessels and the Deltic was selected to power the s. The Deltic engine is still in service in some . These versions are de-rated to reduce engine stress.

Deltic Diesels served in MTBs and PT boats built for other navies. Particularly notable was the Norwegian &quot;Tjeld&quot; or &quot;Nasty&quot; class, which was also sold to Germany, Greece, and the United States Navy. &quot;Nasty&quot;-class boats served in the Vietnam War, largely for covert operations.

Smaller nine-cylinder &quot;Deltic 9&quot; engines were used as marine engines, notably by minesweepers. The Ton-class vessels were powered by a pair of Deltic 18s and used an additional Deltic 9 for power generation for their magnetic influence sweep. The Hunt class used three Deltic 9s, two for propulsion and again one for power generation, but this time with a hydraulic pump integrated to power bow-thrusters for slow-speed manœuvring, until a refurbishment programme by BAE Systems, that ran from 2010 to 2018, replaced the Deltic with Caterpillar C32 engines in the eight remaining commissioned Royal Navy vessels.

=== Railway use ===


Deltic engines were used in two types of British rail locomotive: the 1961–62 built class 55 and the 1959 built class 23. These locomotive types were known as &quot;Deltics&quot; and &quot;Baby Deltics&quot;, respectively.

The Class 55 used two D18-25 series II type V Deltic engines: mechanically blown 18-cylinder engines each rated at continuous at 1500 rpm. The Class 23 used a single less powerful nine-cylinder turbocharged T9-29 Deltic of .

Six out of the original 22 Class 55 locomotives survive. Class leader D9000 &quot;Royal Scots Grey&quot; was returned to main line serviceable status in 1996. Following a power unit failure this locomotive was fitted, for a time, with an ex Royal Norwegian Navy T18-37K type, after various modifications were cleverly designed to make the new unit compatible.

===Fire department use===
The New York City Fire Department used a Napier Deltic engine to power their one-of-a-kind &quot;Super Pumper System&quot;. This was a very-high-volume trailer-mounted fire pump with a separate tender.

=== Reliability in service ===
While the Deltic engine was successful in marine and rail use and very powerful for its size and weight, it was a highly strung unit, requiring careful maintenance. This led to a policy of unit replacement rather than repair in situ. Deltic engines were easily removed after breakdown, generally being sent back to the manufacturer for repair, although after initial contracts expired both the Royal Navy and British Railways set up their own workshops for overhauls.

== Turbo-compound Deltic ==
The &quot;E.185&quot; or &quot;Compound Deltic&quot; turbo-compound variant was planned and a single prototype was built in 1956 and tested in 1957. This capitalised on Napier&#x27;s experience with both the &quot;Nomad&quot; and its increasing involvement with gas turbines. It used the Deltic as the gas generator inside a gas turbine, with both a twelve-stage axial compressor and a three-stage gas turbine. Unlike the Nomad, this turbine was not mechanically coupled to the crankshaft, but merely drove the compressor. It was hoped that it would produce 6,000 horsepower, with fuel economy and power-to-weight ratio &quot;second to none&quot;. Predictions by the engineers closely connected with it were that connecting rod failure would be the limit on this power, failing at around 5,300 bhp. On test it actually produced 5,600 bhp before throwing a connecting rod through the crankcase just as predicted. Naval interest had waned by 1958 in favour of the pure gas turbine, despite its heavier fuel consumption, and no further development was carried out.

<text>The Eight Principles of &quot;Yong&quot; are used by calligraphers to practice how to write the eight most common strokes in regular script, using the fact that they are all present in the character . It was believed that the frequent practice of these principles as such when beginning one&#x27;s study could ensure beauty in the Chinese calligrapher&#x27;s writing.

The Eight Principles are influenced by the Eastern Jin-era &quot;Seven Powers&quot; () by Lady Wei Shuo. Publications on the principles include:
* The Tang-era &quot;Praise to the Eight Principles of &quot;Yong&quot;&quot; () by Liu Zongyuan
* The Tang-era &quot;Praise to the Eight Principles of &quot;Yong&quot;&quot; () by Yan Zhenqing
* The Yuan-era &quot;Eight Ways to Explain &quot;Yong&quot;&quot; () by Li Puguang, which provides two-character metaphorical names

== Table ==

===CJK strokes===

In addition to these eight common strokes in , there are at least two dozen strokes of combinations which enter in the composition of CJK strokes and by inclusion the CJK characters themselves. Most strokes are encoded in Unicode as symbols, to be used in ideographic description sequences (IDS). The standard characters names assigned in the UCS for these CJK strokes are based on initials of the modern Chinese names (romanized with Pinyin) of component principles with which they are recognized and drawn.

<text>A thesis (: theses), or dissertation (abbreviated diss.), is a document submitted in support of candidature for an academic degree or professional qualification presenting the author&#x27;s research and findings. In some contexts, the word &quot;thesis&quot; or a cognate is used for part of a bachelor&#x27;s or master&#x27;s course, while &quot;dissertation&quot; is normally applied to a doctorate. This is the typical arrangement in American English. In other contexts, such as within most institutions of the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and Brazil, the reverse is true. The term graduate thesis is sometimes used to refer to both master&#x27;s theses and doctoral dissertations.

The required complexity or quality of research of a thesis or dissertation can vary by country, university, or program, and the required minimum study period may thus vary significantly in duration.

The word &quot;dissertation&quot; can at times be used to describe a treatise without relation to obtaining an academic degree. The term &quot;thesis&quot; is also used to refer to the general claim of an essay or similar work.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;thesis&quot; comes from the Greek word , meaning &quot;something put forth&quot;, and refers to an intellectual proposition. &quot;Dissertation&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;dissertātiō&quot;, meaning &quot;discussion&quot;. Aristotle was the first philosopher to define the term thesis. A &#x27;thesis&#x27; is a supposition of some eminent philosopher that conflicts with the general opinion...for to take notice when any ordinary person expresses views contrary to men&#x27;s usual opinions would be silly.For Aristotle, a thesis would therefore be a supposition that is stated in contradiction with general opinion or express disagreement with other philosophers (104b33-35). A supposition is a statement or opinion that may or may not be true depending on the evidence and/or proof that is offered (152b32). The purpose of the dissertation is thus to outline the proofs of why the author disagrees with other philosophers or the general opinion.

== Structure and presentation style ==
=== Structure ===
A thesis (or dissertation) may be arranged as a thesis by publication or a monograph, with or without appended papers, respectively, though many graduate programs allow candidates to submit a curated collection of articles. An ordinary monograph has a title page, an abstract, a table of contents, comprising the various chapters like introduction, literature review, methodology, results, discussion, and bibliography or more usually a references section. They differ in their structure in accordance with the many different areas of study (arts, humanities, social sciences, technology, sciences, etc.) and the differences between them. In a thesis by publication, the chapters constitute an introductory and comprehensive review of the appended published and unpublished article documents.

Dissertations normally report on a research project or study, or an extended analysis of a topic. The structure of a thesis or dissertation explains the purpose, the previous research literature impinging on the topic of the study, the methods used, and the findings of the project. Most world universities use a multiple chapter format: 
:a) an introduction: which introduces the research topic, the methodology, as well as its scope and significance
:b) a literature review: reviewing relevant literature and showing how this has informed the research issue
:c) a methodology chapter, explaining how the research has been designed and why the research methods/population/data collection and analysis being used have been chosen 
:d) a findings chapter: outlining the findings of the research itself
:e) an analysis and discussion chapter: analysing the findings and discussing them in the context of the literature review (this chapter is often divided into two—analysis and discussion) 
:f) a conclusion: which shows judgement or decision reached by thesis

=== Style ===
Degree-awarding institutions often define their own house style that candidates have to follow when preparing a thesis document. In addition to institution-specific house styles, there exist a number of field-specific, national, and international standards and recommendations for the presentation of theses, for instance ISO 7144. Other applicable international standards include ISO 2145 on section numbers, ISO 690 on bibliographic references, and ISO 31 or its revision ISO 80000 on quantities or units.

Some older house styles specify that front matter (title page, abstract, table of content, etc.) must use a separate page number sequence from the main text, using Roman numerals. The relevant international standard and many newer style guides recognize that this book design practice can cause confusion where electronic document viewers number all pages of a document continuously from the first page, independent of any printed page numbers. They, therefore, avoid the traditional separate number sequence for front matter and require a single sequence of Arabic numerals starting with 1 for the first printed page (the recto of the title page).

Presentation requirements, including pagination, layout, type and color of paper, use of acid-free paper (where a copy of the dissertation will become a permanent part of the library collection), paper size, order of components, and citation style, will be checked page by page by the accepting officer before the thesis is accepted and a receipt is issued.

However, strict standards are not always required. Most Italian universities, for example, have only general requirements on the character size and the page formatting, and leave much freedom for the actual typographic details.

Increasingly, academic institutions are accepting digital and multimodal dissertations that include elements such as video, audio, or interactive software.

== Thesis committee ==
The thesis committee (or dissertation committee) is a committee that supervises a student&#x27;s dissertation. In the US, these committees usually consist of a primary supervisor or advisor and two or more committee members, who supervise the progress of the dissertation and may also act as the examining committee, or jury, at the oral examination of the thesis .

At most universities, the committee is chosen by the student in conjunction with their primary adviser, usually after completion of the comprehensive examinations or prospectus meeting, and may consist of members of the comps committee. The committee members are doctors in their field (whether a PhD or other designation) and have the task of reading the dissertation, making suggestions for changes and improvements, and sitting in on the defense. Sometimes, at least one member of the committee must be a professor in a department that is different from that of the student.

== Role of thesis supervisor ==
The role of the thesis supervisor is to assist and support a student in their studies, and to determine whether a thesis is ready for examination. The thesis is authored by the student, not the supervisor. The duties of the thesis supervisor also include checking for copyright compliance and ensuring that the student has included in/with the thesis a statement attesting that he/she is the sole author of the thesis.

== Regional and degree-specific practices and terminologies ==
=== Argentina ===
In the &quot;Latin American docta&quot;, the academic dissertation can be referred to as different stages inside the academic program that the student is seeking to achieve into a recognized Argentine University, in all the cases the students must develop original contribution in the chosen fields by means of several paper work and essays that comprehend the body of the &quot;thesis&quot;. Correspondingly to the academic degree, the last phase of an academic thesis is called in Spanish a &quot;defensa de grado&quot;, &quot;defensa magistral&quot; or &quot;defensa doctoral&quot; in cases in which the university candidate is finalizing their licentiate, master&#x27;s, or PhD program, respectively. According to a committee resolution, the dissertation can be approved or rejected by an academic committee consisting of the thesis director and at least one evaluator. All the dissertation referees must already have achieved at least the academic degree that the candidate is trying to reach.

=== Canada ===

At English-speaking Canadian universities, writings presented in fulfillment of undergraduate coursework requirements are normally called &quot;papers&quot;, &quot;term papers&quot; or &quot;essays&quot;. A longer paper or essay presented for completion of a 4-year bachelor&#x27;s degree is sometimes called a &quot;major paper&quot;. High-quality research papers presented as the empirical study of a &quot;postgraduate&quot; consecutive bachelor &quot;with Honours&quot; or Baccalaureatus Cum Honore degree are called &quot;thesis&quot; (Honours Seminar Thesis). Major papers presented as the final project for a master&#x27;s degree are normally called &quot;thesis&quot;; and major papers presenting the student&#x27;s research towards a doctoral degree are called &quot;theses&quot; or &quot;dissertations&quot;.

At French-language universities, for the fulfillment of a master&#x27;s degree, students can present a &quot;&quot;mémoire&quot;&#x27; or a shorter &quot;essai&quot;&quot;&#x27; (the latter requires the student to take more courses). For the fulfillment of a doctoral degree, they may present a &quot;thèse&quot; or an &quot;essai doctoral&quot; (here too, the latter requires more courses). All these documents are usually synthetic monograph related to the student&#x27;s research work.

A typical undergraduate paper or essay might be forty pages. Master&#x27;s theses are approximately one hundred pages. PhD theses are usually over two hundred pages. This may vary greatly by discipline, program, college, or university. A study published in 2021 found that in Québec universities, between 2000 and 2020, master&#x27;s and PhD theses averaged 127.4 and 245.6 pages respectively.

Theses Canada acquires and preserves a comprehensive collection of Canadian theses at Library and Archives Canada (LAC) through a partnership with Canadian universities who participate in the program. Most theses can also be found in the institutional repository of the university the student graduated from.

=== Croatia ===
At most university faculties in Croatia, a degree is obtained by defending a thesis after having passed all the classes specified in the degree programme. In the Bologna system, the bachelor&#x27;s thesis, called &quot;završni rad&quot; (literally &quot;final work&quot; or &quot;concluding work&quot;) is defended after 3 years of study and is about 30 pages long. Most students with bachelor&#x27;s degrees continue onto master&#x27;s programmes which end with a master&#x27;s thesis called &quot;diplomski rad&quot; (literally &quot;diploma work&quot; or &quot;graduate work&quot;). The term dissertation is used for a doctoral degree paper (&quot;doktorska disertacija&quot;).

=== Czech Republic ===
In the Czech Republic, higher education is completed by passing all classes remaining to the educational compendium for given degree and defending a thesis. For bachelors programme the thesis is called &quot;bakalářská práce&quot; (bachelor&#x27;s thesis), for master&#x27;s degrees and also doctor of medicine or dentistry degrees it is the &quot;diplomová práce&quot; (master&#x27;s thesis), and for Philosophiae doctor (PhD.) degree it is dissertation &quot;dizertační práce&quot;. Thesis for so called Higher-Professional School (Vyšší odborná škola, VOŠ) is called &quot;absolventská práce&quot;.

=== Finland ===
The following types of thesis are used in Finland (names in Finnish/Swedish):
* &quot;Kandidaatintutkielma/kandidatavhandling&quot; is the dissertation associated with lower-level academic degrees (bachelor&#x27;s degree), and at universities of applied science.
* &quot;Pro gradu(-tutkielma)/(avhandling) pro gradu&quot;, colloquially referred to simply as &#x27;gradu&#x27;, now referred to as &quot;maisterintutkielma&quot; by many degree-awarding institutions is the dissertation for master&#x27;s degrees, which make up the majority of degrees conferred in Finland, and this is therefore the most common type of thesis submitted in the country. The equivalent for engineering and architecture students is &quot;diplomityö/diplomarbete&quot;. At many Finnish universities, the 21st century has seen a substantial reduction in the requirements for this thesis level.
* The highest-level theses are called &quot;lisensiaatintutkielma/licentiatavhandling&quot; and &quot;(tohtorin)väitöskirja/doktorsavhandling&quot;, for licentiate and doctoral degrees, respectively.

=== France ===
In France, the academic dissertation or thesis is called a &quot;thèse&quot; and it is reserved for the final work of doctoral candidates. The minimum page length is generally (and not formally) 100 pages (or about 400,000 characters), but is usually several times longer (except for technical theses and for &quot;exact sciences&quot; such as physics and maths).

To complete a master&#x27;s degree in research, a student is required to write a &quot;mémoire&quot;, the French equivalent of a master&#x27;s thesis in other higher education systems.

The word &quot;dissertation&quot; in French is reserved for shorter (1,000–2,000 words), more generic academic treatises.

The defense is called a &quot;soutenance&quot;.

Since 2023, at the end of the admission process, the doctoral student takes an oath of commitment to the principles of scientific integrity

=== Germany ===
In Germany, an academic thesis is called &quot;Abschlussarbeit&quot; or, more specifically, the basic name of the degree complemented by &quot;-arbeit&quot; (rough translation: &quot;-work&quot;; e.g., &quot;Diplomarbeit&quot;, &quot;Masterarbeit&quot;, &quot;Doktorarbeit&quot;). For bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees, the name can alternatively be complemented by &quot;-thesis&quot; instead (e.g., &quot;Bachelorthesis&quot;).

Length is often given in page count and depends upon departments, faculties, and fields of study. A bachelor&#x27;s thesis is often 40–60 pages long, a diploma thesis and a master&#x27;s thesis usually 60–100. The required submission for a doctorate is called a &quot;Dissertation&quot; or &quot;Doktorarbeit&quot;. The submission for a Habilitation, which is an academic qualification, not an academic degree, is called &quot;Habilitationsschrift&quot;, not &quot;Habilitationsarbeit&quot;.

A doctoral degree is often earned with multiple levels of a Latin honors remark for the thesis ranging from &quot;summa cum laude&quot; (best) to &quot;rite&quot; (duly). A thesis can also be rejected with a Latin remark (&quot;non-rite&quot;, &quot;non-sufficit&quot; or worst as &quot;sub omni canone&quot;). Bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s theses receive numerical grades from 1.0 (best) to 5.0 (failed).

=== India ===
In India the thesis defense is called a (Latin for &quot;by live voice&quot;) examination (&quot;viva&quot; in short). Involved in the &quot;viva&quot; are two examiners, one guide (student guide) and the candidate. One examiner is an academic from the candidate&#x27;s own university department (but not one of the candidate&#x27;s supervisors) and the other is an external examiner from a different university.

In India, PG Qualifications such as MSc Physics accompanies submission of dissertation in Part I and submission of a Project (a working model of an innovation) in Part II. Engineering and Designing qualifications such as BTech, B.E., B.Des, MTech, M.E. or M.Des also involves submission of dissertation. In all the cases, the dissertation can be extended for summer internship at certain research and development organizations or also as PhD synopsis.

=== Indonesia ===
In Indonesia, the term &quot;thesis&quot; is used specifically to refer to master&#x27;s theses. The undergraduate thesis is called &quot;skripsi&quot;, while the doctoral dissertation is called &quot;disertasi&quot;. In general, those three terms are usually called as &quot;tugas akhir&quot; (final assignment), which is mostly mandatory for the completion of a degree. Undergraduate students usually begin to write their final assignment in their third, fourth or fifth enrollment year, depends on the requirements of their respective disciplines and universities. In some universities, students are required to write a &quot;proposal skripsi&quot; or &quot;proposal tesis&quot; (thesis proposal) before they could write their final assignment. If the thesis proposal is considered to fulfill the qualification by the academic examiners, students then may proceed to write their final assignment.

=== Iran ===
In Iran, usually students are required to present a thesis ( &quot;pāyān-nāmeh&quot;) in their master&#x27;s degree and a dissertation ( &quot;resāleh&quot;) in their Doctorate degree, both of which requiring the students to defend their research before a committee and gaining their approval. Most of the norms and rules of writing a thesis or a dissertation are influenced by the French higher education system.

=== Italy ===
In Italy there are normally three types of thesis. In order of complexity: one for the Laurea (equivalent to the UK Bachelor&#x27;s Degree), another one for the Laurea Magistrale (equivalent to the UK Master&#x27;s Degree) and then a thesis to complete the Dottorato di Ricerca (PhD). Thesis requirements vary greatly between degrees and disciplines, ranging from as low as 3–4 ECTS credits to more than 30. Thesis work is mandatory for the completion of a degree.

=== Kazakhstan === 
In Kazakhstan, a bachelor&#x27;s degree typically requires a &quot;bachelor&#x27;s diploma work&quot; (kz &quot;бакалаврдың дипломдық жұмысы&quot;), while the master&#x27;s and PhD degree require a &quot;master&#x27;s/doctoral dissertation&quot; (kz &quot;магистрлік/докторлық диссертация&quot;). All the works are publicly presented to the special council at the end of the training, which thoroughly examines the work. PhD candidates may be allowed to present their work without a written thesis, if they provide enough publications in leading journals of the field, and one of which should be a review article specifically.

=== Malaysia ===
Malaysian universities often follow the British model for dissertations and degrees. However, a few universities follow the United States model for theses and dissertations. Some public universities have both British and US style PhD programs. Branch campuses of British, Australian and Middle East universities in Malaysia use the respective models of the home campuses.

=== Pakistan ===
In Pakistan, at undergraduate level the thesis is usually called final year project, as it is completed in the senior year of the degree, the name project usually implies that the work carried out is less extensive than a thesis and bears lesser credit hours too. The undergraduate level project is presented through an elaborate written report and a presentation to the advisor, a board of faculty members and students. At graduate level however, i.e. in MS, some universities allow students to accomplish a project of 6 credits or a thesis of 9 credits, at least one publication is normally considered enough for the awarding of the degree with project and is considered mandatory for the awarding of a degree with thesis. A written report and a public thesis defense is mandatory, in the presence of a board of senior researchers, consisting of members from an outside organization or a university. A PhD candidate is supposed to accomplish extensive research work to fulfill the dissertation requirements with international publications being a mandatory requirement. The defense of the research work is done publicly.

=== Philippines ===
In the Philippines, an academic thesis is named by the degree, such as bachelor/undergraduate thesis or masteral thesis. However, in Philippine English, the term &quot;doctorate&quot; is typically replaced with &quot;doctoral&quot; (as in the case of &quot;doctoral dissertation&quot;), though in official documentation the former is still used. The terms &quot;thesis&quot; and &quot;dissertation&quot; are commonly used interchangeably in everyday language yet it is generally understood that a &quot;thesis&quot; refers to bachelor/undergraduate and master academic work while a &quot;dissertation&quot; is named for doctorate work.

The Philippine system is influenced by American collegiate system, in that it requires a &quot;research project&quot; to be submitted before being allowed to write a thesis. This project is mostly given as a prerequisite writing course to the actual thesis and is accomplished in the term period before; supervision is provided by one professor assigned to a class. This project is later to be presented in front of an academic panel, often the entire faculty of an academic department, with their recommendations contributing to the acceptance, revision, or rejection of the initial topic. In addition, the presentation of the research project will help the candidate choose their primary thesis adviser.

An undergraduate thesis is completed in the final year of the degree alongside existing seminar (lecture) or laboratory courses, and is often divided into two presentations: &quot;proposal&quot; and &quot;thesis&quot; presentations (though this varies across universities), whereas a master thesis or doctorate dissertation is accomplished in the last term alone and is defended once. In most universities, a thesis is required for the bestowment of a degree to a candidate alongside a number of units earned throughout their academic period of stay, though for practice and skills-based degrees a &quot;practicum&quot; and a written report can be achieved instead. The examination board often consists of three to five examiners, often professors in a university (with a Masters or PhD degree) depending on the university&#x27;s examination rules. Required word length, complexity, and contribution to scholarship varies widely across universities in the country.

=== Poland ===
In Poland, a bachelor&#x27;s degree usually requires a &quot;praca licencjacka&quot; (bachelor&#x27;s thesis) or the similar level degree in engineering requires a &quot;praca inżynierska&quot; (engineer&#x27;s thesis/bachelor&#x27;s thesis), the master&#x27;s degree requires a &quot;praca magisterska&quot; (master&#x27;s thesis). The academic dissertation for a PhD is called a &quot;dysertacja&quot; or &quot;praca doktorska&quot;. The submission for the Habilitation is called &quot;praca habilitacyjna&quot; or &quot;dysertacja habilitacyjna&quot;. Thus the term &quot;dysertacja&quot; is reserved for PhD and Habilitation degrees. All the theses need to be &quot;defended&quot; by the author during a special examination for the given degree. Examinations for PhD and Habilitation degrees are public.

=== Portugal and Brazil ===
In Portugal and Brazil, a dissertation (&quot;dissertação&quot;) is required for completion of a master&#x27;s degree. The defense is done in a public presentation in which teachers, students, and the general public can participate. For the PhD, a thesis (&quot;tese&quot;) is presented for defense in a public exam. The exam typically extends over 3 hours. The examination board typically involves 5 to 6 scholars (including the advisor) or other experts with a PhD degree (generally at least half of them must be external to the university where the candidate defends the thesis, but it may depend on the university). Each university / faculty defines the length of these documents, and it can vary also in respect to the domains (a thesis in fields like philosophy, history, geography, etc., usually has more pages than a thesis in mathematics, computer science, statistics, etc.) but typical numbers of pages are around 60–80 for MSc and 150–250 for PhD.

In Brazil the Bachelor&#x27;s Thesis is called &quot;TCC&quot; or &quot;Trabalho de Conclusão de Curso&quot; (Final Term / Undergraduate Thesis / Final Paper).

=== Russia, Belarus, Ukraine ===
In Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine an academic dissertation or thesis is called what can be literally translated as a &quot;master&#x27;s degree work&quot; (thesis), whereas the word &quot;dissertation&quot; is reserved for doctoral theses (Candidate of Sciences). To complete both bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degree, a student is required to write a thesis and to then defend the work publicly. The length of this manuscript usually is given in page count and depends upon educational institution, its departments, faculties, and fields of study 

=== Slovenia ===
At universities in Slovenia, an academic thesis called &quot;diploma thesis&quot; is a prerequisite for completing undergraduate studies. The thesis used to be 40–60 pages long, but has been reduced to 20–30 pages in new Bologna process programmes. To complete Master&#x27;s studies, a candidate must write &quot;magistrsko delo&quot; (Master&#x27;s thesis) that is longer and more detailed than the undergraduate thesis. The required submission for the doctorate is called &quot;doktorska disertacija&quot; (doctoral dissertation). In pre Bologna programmes students were able to skip the preparation and presentation of a Master&#x27;s thesis and continue straightforward towards doctorate.

=== Slovakia ===
In Slovakia, higher education is completed by defending a thesis, which is called &quot;bachelor&#x27;s thesis&quot; &quot;bakalárska práca&quot; for bachelors programme, master&#x27;s thesis or &quot;diplomová práca&quot; for master&#x27;s degrees, and also doctor of medicine or dentistry degrees and dissertation &quot;dizertačná práca&quot; for Philosophiae doctor (PhD.) degree.

=== Sweden ===

In Sweden, there are different types of theses. Practices and definitions vary between fields but commonly include the &quot;C thesis&quot;/Bachelor thesis, which corresponds to 15 HP or 10 weeks of independent studies, &quot;D thesis&quot;/&#x27;/Magister/one year master&#x27;s thesis, which corresponds to 15 HP or 10 weeks of independent studies and &quot;E Thesis&quot;/two-year master&#x27;s thesis, which corresponds to 30 HP or 20 weeks of independent studies. The undergraduate theses are called &quot;uppsats&quot; (&quot;essay&quot;), sometimes &quot;examensarbete&quot;, especially at technical programmes.

After that there are two types of post graduate theses: licentiate thesis (&quot;licentiatuppsats&quot;) and PhD dissertation (&quot;doktorsavhandling&quot;). A licentiate degree is approximately &quot;half a PhD&quot; in terms of the size and scope of the thesis. Swedish PhD studies should in theory last for four years, including course work and thesis work, but as many PhD students also teach, the PhD often takes longer to complete. The thesis can be written as a monograph or as a compilation thesis; in the latter case, the introductory chapters are called the &quot;kappa&quot; (literally &quot;coat&quot;).

=== United Kingdom ===
Outside the academic community, the terms &quot;thesis&quot; and &quot;dissertation&quot; are interchangeable. At universities in the United Kingdom, the term &quot;thesis&quot; is usually associated with PhD/EngD (doctoral) and research master&#x27;s degrees, while &quot;dissertation&quot; is the more common term for a substantial project submitted as part of a taught master&#x27;s degree or an undergraduate degree (e.g. MSc, BA, BSc, BMus, BEd, BEng etc.).

Thesis word lengths may differ by faculty/department and are set by individual universities.

A wide range of supervisory arrangements can be found in the British academy, from single supervisors (more usual for undergraduate and Masters level work) to supervisory teams of up to three supervisors. In teams, there will often be a Director of Studies, usually someone with broader experience (perhaps having passed some threshold of successful supervisions). The Director may be involved with regular supervision along with the other supervisors, or may have more of an oversight role, with the other supervisors taking on the more day-to-day responsibilities of supervision.

=== United States ===
In some U.S. doctoral programs, the &quot;dissertation&quot; can take up the major part of the student&#x27;s total time spent (along with two or three years of classes) and may take years of full-time work to complete. At most universities, &quot;dissertation&quot; is the term for the required submission for the doctorate, and &quot;thesis&quot; refers only to the master&#x27;s degree requirement.

&quot;Thesis&quot; is also used to describe a cumulative project for a bachelor&#x27;s degree and is more common at selective colleges and universities, or for those seeking admittance to graduate school or to obtain an honors academic designation. These projects are called &quot;senior projects&quot; or &quot;senior theses&quot;; they are generally done in the senior year near graduation after having completed other courses, the independent study period, and the internship or student teaching period (the completion of most of the requirements before the writing of the paper ensures adequate knowledge and aptitude for the challenge). Unlike a dissertation or master&#x27;s thesis, they are not as long and they do not require a novel contribution to knowledge or even a very narrow focus on a set subtopic. Like them, they can be lengthy and require months of work, they require supervision by at least one professor adviser, they must be focused on a certain area of knowledge, and they must use an appreciable amount of scholarly citations. They may or may not be defended before a committee but usually are not; there is generally no preceding examination before the writing of the paper, except for at very few colleges. Because of the nature of the graduate thesis or dissertation having to be more narrow and more novel, the result of original research, these usually have a smaller proportion of the work that is cited from other sources, though the fact that they are lengthier may mean they still have more total citations.

Specific undergraduate courses, especially writing-intensive courses or courses taken by upperclassmen, may also require one or more extensive written assignments referred to variously as theses, essays, or papers. Increasingly, high schools are requiring students to complete a senior project or senior thesis on a chosen topic during the final year as a prerequisite for graduation. The extended essay component of the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme, offered in a growing number of American high schools, is another example of this trend.

Generally speaking, a dissertation is judged as to whether it makes an original and unique contribution to scholarship. Lesser projects (a master&#x27;s thesis, for example) are judged by whether they demonstrate mastery of available scholarship in the presentation of an idea.

The required complexity or quality of research of a thesis may vary significantly among universities or programs.

== Thesis examinations ==

One of the requirements for certain advanced degrees is often an oral examination (called a &quot;viva voce&quot; examination or just &quot;viva&quot; in the UK and certain other English-speaking countries). This examination normally occurs after the dissertation is finished but before it is submitted to the university, and may comprise a presentation (often public) by the student and questions posed by an examining committee or jury. In North America, an initial oral examination in the field of specialization may take place just before the student settles down to work on the dissertation. An additional oral exam may take place after the dissertation is completed and is known as a thesis defense or dissertation defense, which at some universities may be a mere formality and at others may result in the student being required to make significant revisions.

=== Examination results ===
The result of the examination may be given immediately following deliberation by the examination committee (in which case the candidate may immediately be considered to have received their degree), or at a later date, in which case the examiners may prepare a defense report that is forwarded to a Board or Committee of Postgraduate Studies, which then officially recommends the candidate for the degree.

Potential decisions (or &quot;verdicts&quot;) include:

* Accepted/pass with no corrections.
: The thesis is accepted as presented. A grade may be awarded, though in many countries PhDs are not graded at all, and in others, only one of the theoretically possible grades (the highest) is ever used in practice.

* The thesis must be revised.
: Revisions (for example, correction of numerous grammatical or spelling errors; clarification of concepts or methodology; an addition of sections) are required. One or more members of the jury or the thesis supervisor will make the decision on the acceptability of revisions and provide written confirmation that they have been satisfactorily completed. If, as is often the case, the needed revisions are relatively modest, the examiners may all sign the thesis with the verbal understanding that the candidate will review the revised thesis with their supervisor before submitting the completed version.

* Extensive revision required.
: The thesis must be revised extensively and undergo the evaluation and defense process again from the beginning with the same examiners. Problems may include theoretical or methodological issues. A candidate who is not recommended for the degree after the second defense must normally withdraw from the program.

* Unacceptable.
: The thesis is unacceptable and the candidate must withdraw from the program. This verdict is given only when the thesis requires major revisions and when the examination makes it clear that the candidate is incapable of making such revisions.

At most North American institutions the latter two verdicts are extremely rare, for two reasons. First, to obtain the status of doctoral candidates, graduate students typically pass a qualifying examination or comprehensive examination, which often includes an oral defense. Students who pass the qualifying examination are deemed capable of completing scholarly work independently and are allowed to proceed with working on a dissertation. Second, since the thesis supervisor (and the other members of the advisory committee) will normally have reviewed the thesis extensively before recommending the student to proceed to the defense, such an outcome would be regarded as a major failure not only on the part of the candidate but also by the candidate&#x27;s supervisor (who should have recognized the substandard quality of the dissertation long before the defense was allowed to take place). It is also fairly rare for a thesis to be accepted without any revisions; the most common outcome of a defense is for the examiners to specify minor revisions (which the candidate typically completes in a few days or weeks).

At universities on the British pattern it is not uncommon for theses at the &quot;viva&quot; stage to be subject to major revisions in which a substantial rewrite is required, sometimes followed by a new &quot;viva&quot;. Very rarely, the thesis may be awarded the lesser degree of M.Phil. (Master of Philosophy) instead, preventing the candidate from resubmitting the thesis.

=== Australia ===
In Australia, doctoral theses are usually examined by three examiners (although some, like the Australian Catholic University, the University of New South Wales, and Western Sydney University have shifted to using only two examiners) without a live defense except in extremely rare exceptions. In the case of a master&#x27;s degree by research, the thesis is usually examined by only two examiners. Typically, one of these examiners will be from within the candidate&#x27;s own department; the other(s) will usually be from other universities and often from overseas. Following submission of the thesis, copies are sent by mail to examiners and then reports sent back to the institution.

Similar to a thesis for a master&#x27;s degree by research, a thesis for the research component of a master&#x27;s degree by coursework is also usually examined by two examiners, one from the candidate&#x27;s department and one from another university. For an Honours year, which is a fourth year in addition to the usual three-year bachelor&#x27;s degree, the thesis is also examined by two examiners, though both are usually from the candidate&#x27;s own department. Honours and Master&#x27;s theses sometimes require an oral defense before they are accepted.

=== Germany ===
In Germany, a thesis is usually examined with an oral examination. This applies to almost all Diplom, Magister, master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees as well as to most bachelor&#x27;s degrees. However, a process that allows for revisions of the thesis is usually only implemented for doctoral degrees.

There are several different kinds of oral examinations used in practice. The &quot;Disputation&quot;, also called &quot;Verteidigung&quot; (&quot;defense&quot;), is usually public (at least to members of the university) and is focused on the topic of the thesis. In contrast, the &quot;Rigorosum&quot; (oral exam) is not held in public and also encompasses fields in addition to the topic of the thesis. The &quot;Rigorosum&quot; is only common for doctoral degrees. Another term for an oral examination is &quot;Kolloquium&quot;, which generally refers to a usually public scientific discussion and is often used synonymously with &quot;Verteidigung&quot;.

In each case, what exactly is expected differs between universities and between faculties. Some universities also demand a combination of several of these forms.

=== Malaysia ===
Like the British model, the PhD or MPhil student is required to submit their thesis or dissertation for examination by two or three examiners. The first examiner is from the university concerned, the second examiner is from another local university and the third examiner is from a suitable foreign university (usually from Commonwealth countries). The choice of examiners must be approved by the university senate. In some public universities, a PhD or MPhil candidate may also have to show a number of publications in peer reviewed academic journals as part of the requirement. An oral viva is conducted after the examiners have submitted their reports to the university. The oral viva session is attended by the Oral Viva chairman, a rapporteur with a PhD qualification, the first examiner, the second examiner and sometimes the third examiner.

Branch campuses of British, Australian and Middle East universities in Malaysia use the respective models of the home campuses to examine their PhD or MPhil candidates.

=== Philippines ===
In the Philippines, a thesis is followed by an oral defense. In most universities, this applies to all bachelor, master, and doctorate degrees. However, the oral defense is held in once per semester (usually in the middle or by the end) with a presentation of revisions (so-called &quot;plenary presentation&quot;) at the end of each semester. The oral defense is typically not held in public for bachelor and master oral defenses, however a colloquium is held for doctorate degrees.

===Portugal===
In Portugal, a thesis is examined with an oral defense, which includes an initial presentation by the candidate followed by an extensive question and answer session. 

=== North America ===
In North America, the &quot;thesis defense&quot; or &quot;oral defense&quot; is the final examination for doctoral candidates, and sometimes for master&#x27;s candidates.

The examining committee normally consists of the thesis committee, usually a given number of professors mainly from the student&#x27;s university plus their primary supervisor, an external examiner (someone not otherwise connected to the university), and a chair person. Each committee member will have been given a completed copy of the dissertation prior to the defense, and will come prepared to ask questions about the thesis itself and the subject matter. In many schools, master&#x27;s thesis defenses are restricted to the examinee and the examiners, but doctoral defenses are open to the public.

The typical format will see the candidate giving a short (20–40-minute) presentation of their research, followed by one to two hours of questions.

At some U.S. institutions, a longer public lecture (known as a &quot;thesis talk&quot; or &quot;thesis seminar&quot;) by the candidate will accompany the defense itself, in which case only the candidate, the examiners, and other members of the faculty may attend the actual defense.

=== Norway ===
In Norway, the final examination for a PhD student is called a &quot;disputas&quot;. The examination consists of a public lecture by the candidate where the audience can ask questions. Then two &quot;opponents&quot; will ask the candidate questions. Prior to the examination, the candidate must pass a trial lecture on a topic typically not part of the student&#x27;s research. This is used to assess the candidate&#x27;s ability to finding the relevant literature and to disseminate knowledge to an audience.

=== Russia and Ukraine ===
A student in Russia or Ukraine has to complete a thesis and then defend it in front of their department. Sometimes the defense meeting is made up of the learning institute&#x27;s professionals and sometimes the students peers are allowed to view or join in. After the presentation and defense of the thesis, the final conclusion of the department should be that none of them have reservations on the content and quality of the thesis.

A conclusion on the thesis has to be approved by the rector of the educational institute. This conclusion (final grade so to speak) of the thesis can be defended/argued not only at the thesis council, but also in any other thesis council of Russia or Ukraine.

=== Spain ===
The former Diploma de estudios avanzados (DEA) lasted two years and candidates were required to complete coursework and demonstrate their ability to research the specific topics they have studied. From 2011 on, these courses were replaced by academic Master&#x27;s programmes that include specific training on epistemology, and scientific methodology. After its completion, students are able to enroll in a specific PhD programme (&quot;programa de doctorado&quot;) and begin a dissertation on a set topic for a maximum time of three years (full-time) and five years (part-time). All students must have a full professor as an academic advisor (&quot;director de tesis&quot;) and a tutor, who is usually the same person.

A dissertation (&quot;tesis doctoral&quot;), with an average of 250 pages, is the main requisite along with typically one previously published journal article. Once candidates have published their written dissertations, they will be evaluated by two external academics (&quot;evaluadores externos&quot;) and subsequently it is usually exhibited publicly for fifteen natural days. After its approval, candidates must defend publicly their research before a three-member committee (&quot;tribunal&quot;) with at least one visiting academic: chair, secretary and member (&quot;presidente&quot;, &quot;secretario&quot; y &quot;vocal&quot;).

A typical public Thesis Defence (&quot;defensa&quot;) lasts 45 minutes and all attendants holding a doctoral degree are eligible to ask questions.

=== United Kingdom, Ireland and Hong Kong ===
In Hong Kong, Ireland and the United Kingdom, the thesis defense is called a (Latin for &#x27;by live voice&#x27;) examination (&quot;viva&quot; for short). A typical &quot;viva&quot; lasts for approximately 3 hours, though there is no formal time limit. Involved in the &quot;viva&quot; are two examiners and the candidate. Usually, one examiner is an academic from the candidate&#x27;s own university department (but not one of the candidate&#x27;s supervisors) and the other is an external examiner from a different university. Increasingly, the examination may involve a third academic, the &#x27;chair&#x27;; this person, from the candidate&#x27;s institution, acts as an impartial observer with oversight of the examination process to ensure that the examination is fair. The &#x27;chair&#x27; does not ask academic questions of the candidate.

In the United Kingdom, there are only two or at most three examiners, and in many universities the examination is held in private. The candidate&#x27;s primary supervisor is not permitted to ask or answer questions during the viva, and their presence is not necessary. However, some universities permit members of the faculty or the university to attend. At the University of Oxford, for instance, any member of the university may attend a DPhil viva (the university&#x27;s regulations require that details of the examination and its time and place be published formally in advance) provided they attend in full academic dress.

== Submission ==

A submission of the thesis is the last formal requirement for most students after the defense. By the final deadline, the student must submit a complete copy of the thesis to the appropriate body within the accepting institution, along with the appropriate forms, bearing the signatures of the primary supervisor, the examiners, and in some cases, the head of the student&#x27;s department. Other required forms may include library authorizations (giving the university library permission to make the thesis available as part of its collection) and copyright permissions (in the event that the student has incorporated copyrighted materials in the thesis). Many large scientific publishing houses (e.g. Taylor &amp; Francis, Elsevier) use copyright agreements that allow the authors to incorporate their published articles into dissertations without separate authorization.
Once all the paperwork is in order, copies of the thesis may be made available in one or more university libraries. Specialist abstracting services exist to publicize the content of these beyond the institutions in which they are produced. Many institutions now insist on submission of digitized as well as printed copies of theses; the digitized versions of successful theses are often made available online.

<text>Testicular cancer is cancer that develops in the testicles, a part of the male reproductive system. Symptoms may include a lump in the testicle or swelling or pain in the scrotum. Treatment may result in infertility.
Risk factors include an undescended testis, family history of the disease, and previous history of testicular cancer. More than 95% are germ cell tumors which are divided into seminomas and non-seminomas. Other types include sex-cord stromal tumors and lymphomas. Diagnosis is typically based on a physical exam, ultrasound, and blood tests. Surgical removal of the testicle with examination under a microscope is then done to determine the type.
Testicular cancer is highly treatable and usually curable. Treatment options may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or stem cell transplantation. Even in cases in which cancer has spread widely, chemotherapy offers a cure rate greater than 80%.
Globally testicular cancer affected about 686,000 people in 2015. That year it resulted in 9,400 deaths up from 7,000 deaths in 1990. Rates are lower in the developing than the developed world. Onset most commonly occurs in males 20 to 34 years old, rarely before 15 years old. The five-year survival rate in the United States is about 95%. Outcomes are better when the disease remains localized.
==Signs and symptoms==

One of the first signs of testicular cancer is often a lump or swelling in the testes. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against routine screening for testicular cancer in asymptomatic adolescents and adults including routine testicular self-exams. However, the American Cancer Society suggests that some men should examine their testicles monthly, especially if they have a family history of cancer, and the American Urological Association recommends monthly testicular self-examinations for all young men.

Symptoms may also include one or more of the following:
* a lump in one testis which may or may not be painful
* sharp pain or a dull ache in the lower abdomen or scrotum
* a feeling often described as &quot;heaviness&quot; in the scrotum
* firmness of the testicle
* breast enlargement (gynecomastia) from hormonal effects of β-hCG
* low back pain (lumbago) due to the cancer spreading to the lymph nodes along the back

It is not very common for testicular cancer to spread to other organs, apart from the lungs. If it has, however, the following symptoms may be present:
* shortness of breath (dyspnea), cough or coughing up blood (hemoptysis) from metastatic spread to the lungs
* a lump in the neck due to metastases to the lymph nodes

Testicular cancer, cryptorchidism, hypospadias, and poor semen quality make up the syndrome known as testicular dysgenesis syndrome.

==Causes==
A major risk factor for the development of testis cancer is cryptorchidism (undescended testicles). It is generally believed that the presence of a tumor contributes to cryptorchidism; when cryptorchidism occurs in conjunction with a tumor then the tumor tends to be large. Other risk factors include inguinal hernias, Klinefelter syndrome, and mumps orchitis. Physical activity is associated with decreased risk and sedentary lifestyle is associated with increased risk. Early onset of male characteristics is associated with increased risk. These may reflect endogenous or environmental hormones. 

Higher rates of testicular cancer in Western nations have been linked to the use of cannabis.

==Mechanisms==
Most testicular germ cell tumors have too many chromosomes, and most often they are triploid to tetraploid. An isochromosome 12p (the short arm of chromosome 12 on both sides of the same centromere) is present in about 80% of testicular cancers, and also other cancers usually have extra material from this chromosome arm through other mechanisms of genomic amplification.

==Diagnosis==

The main way testicular cancer is diagnosed is via a lump or mass inside a testis. More generally, if a young adult or adolescent has a single enlarged testicle, which may or may not be painful, this should give doctors reason to suspect testicular cancer.

Other conditions may also have symptoms similar to testicular cancer:

* Epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis
* Hematocele
* Varicocele
* Orchitis
* Prostate infections or inflammations (prostatitis), bladder infections or inflammations (cystitis), or kidney (renal) infections (nephritis) or inflammations which have spread to and caused swelling in the vessels of the testicles or scrotum
* Testicular torsion or a hernia
* Infection, inflammation, retro-peritonitis, or other conditions of the lymph nodes or vessels near the scrotum, testicles, pubis, anorectal area, and groin
* Benign tumors or lesions of the testicles
* Metastasis to the testicles from another, primary tumor site(s)

The nature of any palpated lump in the scrotum is often evaluated by scrotal ultrasound, which can determine the exact location, size, and some characteristics of the lump, such as cystic vs solid, uniform vs heterogeneous, sharply circumscribed, or poorly defined. The extent of the disease is evaluated by CT scans, which are used to locate metastases.

The differential diagnosis of testicular cancer requires examining the histology of tissue obtained from an inguinal orchiectomy—that is, surgical excision of the entire testis along with attached structures (epididymis and spermatic cord). A biopsy should not be performed, as it raises the risk of spreading cancer cells into the scrotum.

Inguinal orchiectomy is the preferred method because it lowers the risk of cancer cells escaping. This is because the lymphatic system of the scrotum, through which white blood cells (and, potentially, cancer cells) flow in and out, links to the lower extremities, while that of the testicle links to the back of the abdominal cavity (the retroperitoneum). A trans-scrotal biopsy or orchiectomy will potentially leave cancer cells in the scrotum and create two routes for cancer cells to spread, while in an inguinal orchiectomy, only the retroperitoneal route exists.

Blood tests are also used to identify and measure tumor markers (usually proteins present in the bloodstream) that are specific to testicular cancer. Alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin (the &quot;pregnancy hormone&quot;), and LDH-1 are the typical tumor markers used to spot testicular germ cell tumors.

A pregnancy test may be used to detect high levels of chorionic gonadotropin; however, the first sign of testicular cancer is usually a painless lump. Note that only about 25% of seminomas have elevated chorionic gonadotropin, so a pregnancy test is not very sensitive for making out testicular cancer.

=== Stressful experiences ===
The stressful event of testicular cancer not only affects the patient that is diagnosed but also affects the caregiver. The psychological stress model consists of stressful experiences that a patient with testicular cancer may go through after diagnosis, that caregivers may want to look out for. The stressful experiences consist of 4 main categories:

* Late side-effects
* Fear of tumor relapse
* Fertility problems
* Social and workplace issues

These side effects may need physical and emotional care which in turn can cause the caregiver an emotional burden.

===Screening===
The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends against screening males without symptoms for testicular cancer.

===Staging===
After removal, the testicle is fixed with Bouin&#x27;s solution because it better conserves some morphological details such as nuclear conformation. Then the testicular tumor is staged by a pathologist according to the TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors as published in the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual. Testicular cancer is categorized as being in one of three stages (which have subclassifications). The size of the tumor in the testis is irrelevant to staging. In broad terms, testicular cancer is staged as follows:
* Stage I: the cancer remains localized to the testis.
* Stage II: the cancer involves the testis and metastasis to retroperitoneal and/or paraaortic lymph nodes (lymph nodes below the diaphragm).
* Stage III: the cancer involves the testis and metastasis beyond the retroperitoneal and paraaortic lymph nodes. Stage 3 is further subdivided into non-bulky stage 3 and bulky stage 3.

Further information on the detailed staging system is available on the website of the American Cancer Society.

===Classification===

Although testicular cancer can be derived from any cell type found in the testicles, more than 95% of testicular cancers are germ cell tumors (GCTs). Most of the remaining 5% are sex cord–gonadal stromal tumours derived from Leydig cells or Sertoli cells. Correct diagnosis is necessary to ensure the most effective and appropriate treatment. To some extent, this can be done via blood tests for tumor markers, but definitive diagnosis requires examination of the histology of a specimen by a pathologist. Testicular tumors are best classified by radical inguinal orchiectomy, which allows for histologic evaluation of the whole testicle and provides local tumor control. 

Most pathologists use the World Health Organization classification system for testicular tumors:
* Germ cells derived from germ cell neoplasia &quot;in situ&quot;
** Noninvasive germ cell neoplasia
***&quot;Germ cell neoplasia in situ&quot;
*** Specific forms of intratubular germ cell neoplasia

==Treatment==
The three basic types of treatment are surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

Surgery is performed by urologists; radiation therapy is administered by radiation oncologists; and chemotherapy is the work of medical oncologists. In most patients with testicular cancer, the disease is cured readily with minimal long-term morbidity. While treatment success depends on the stage, the average survival rate after five years is around 95%, and stage 1 cancer cases, if monitored properly, have essentially a 100% survival rate.

=== Testicle removal ===
The initial treatment for testicular cancer is surgery to remove the affected testicle (orchiectomy). While it may be possible, in some cases, to remove testicular cancer tumors from a testis while leaving the testis functional, this is seldom done, as the affected testicle usually contains pre-cancerous cells spread throughout the entire testicle. Thus removing the tumor alone without additional treatment greatly increases the risk that another cancer will form in that testicle.

Since only one testis is typically required to maintain fertility, hormone production, and other male functions, the affected testis is almost always removed completely in a procedure called inguinal orchiectomy. (The testicle is rarely removed through the scrotum; an incision is made beneath the belt line in the inguinal area.) In the UK, the procedure is known as a radical orchidectomy.

===Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection===
In the case of non-seminomas that appear to be stage I, surgery may be done on the retroperitoneal/paraaortic lymph nodes (in a separate operation) to accurately determine whether the cancer is in stage I or stage II and to reduce the risk that malignant testicular cancer cells that may have metastasized to lymph nodes in the lower abdomen. This surgery is called retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND). However, this approach, while standard in many places, especially in the United States, is out of favor due to costs and the high level of expertise required to perform successful surgery. Sperm banking is frequently carried out before the procedure (as with chemotherapy), as there is a risk that RPLND may damage the nerves involved in ejaculation, causing ejaculation to occur internally into the bladder rather than externally.

Many patients are instead choosing surveillance, where no further surgery is performed unless tests indicate that the cancer has returned. This approach maintains a high cure rate because of the growing accuracy of surveillance techniques.

=== Adjuvant treatment ===
Since testicular cancers can spread, patients are usually offered adjuvant treatment—in the form of chemotherapy or radiotherapy—to kill any cancerous cells that may exist outside of the affected testicle. The type of adjuvant therapy depends largely on the histology of the tumor (i.e., the size and shape of its cells under the microscope) and the stage of progression at the time of surgery (i.e., how far cells have &#x27;escaped&#x27; from the testicle, invaded the surrounding tissue, or spread to the rest of the body). If the cancer is not particularly advanced, patients may be offered careful surveillance by periodic CT scans and blood tests, in place of adjuvant treatment.

Before 1970, survival rates from testicular cancer were low. Since the introduction of adjuvant chemotherapy, chiefly platinum-based drugs like cisplatin and carboplatin, the outlook has improved substantially. Although 7000 to 8000 new cases of testicular cancer occur in the United States yearly, only 400 men are expected to die of the disease.

In the UK, a similar trend has emerged: since improvements in treatment, survival rates have risen rapidly to cure rates of over 95%.

===Radiation therapy===
Radiation may be used to treat stage II seminoma cancers, or as adjuvant (preventative) therapy in the case of stage I seminomas, to minimize the likelihood that tiny, non-detectable tumors exist and will spread (in the inguinal and para-aortic lymph nodes). Radiation is ineffective against and is therefore never used as a primary therapy for non-seminoma.

===Chemotherapy===

==== Non-seminoma ====

Chemotherapy is the standard treatment for non-seminoma when the cancer has spread to other parts of the body (that is, stage 2B or 3). The standard chemotherapy protocol is three, or sometimes four, rounds of Bleomycin-Etoposide-Cisplatin (BEP). BEP as a first-line treatment was first reported by Professor Michael Peckham in 1983. The landmark trial published in 1987 which established BEP as the optimum treatment was conducted by Dr. Lawrence Einhorn at Indiana University. An alternative, equally effective treatment involves the use of four cycles of Etoposide-Cisplatin (EP).

Lymph node surgery may also be performed after chemotherapy to remove masses left behind (stage 2B or more advanced), particularly in the cases of large non-seminomas.

==== Seminoma ====

As an adjuvant treatment, the use of chemotherapy as an alternative to radiation therapy in the treatment of seminoma is increasing, because radiation therapy appears to have more significant long-term side effects (for example, pelvic radiation disease, increased risks of secondary malignancies, etc. See also: Radiation therapy#Late side effects). Two doses, or occasionally a single dose of carboplatin, typically delivered three weeks apart, is proving to be a successful adjuvant treatment, with recurrence rates in the same ranges as those of radiotherapy. The concept of carboplatin as a single-dose therapy was developed by Tim Oliver, Professor of Medical Oncology at Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry. However, very long-term data on the efficacy of adjuvant carboplatin in this setting do not exist.

Since seminoma can recur decades after the primary tumor is removed, patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy should remain vigilant and not assume they are cured 5 years after treatment.

==Prognosis==
Treatment of testicular cancer is one of the success stories of modern medicine, with sustained response to treatment in more than 90% of cases, regardless of stage. In 2011 overall cure rates of more than 95% were reported, and 80% for metastatic disease—the best response by any solid tumor, with improved survival being attributed primarily to effective chemotherapy. By 2013 more than 96 percent of the 2,300 men diagnosed each year in the U.K. were deemed cured, a rise by almost a third since the 1970s, the improvement attributed substantially to the chemotherapy drug cisplatin. In the United States, when the disease is treated while it is still localized, more than 99% of people survive 5 years.

===Surveillance===
For many patients with stage I cancer, adjuvant (preventative) therapy following surgery may not be appropriate and patients will undergo surveillance instead. The form this surveillance takes, e.g. the type and frequency of investigations and the length time it should continue, will depend on the type of cancer (non-seminoma or seminoma), but the aim is to avoid unnecessary treatments in the many patients who are cured by their surgery, and ensure that any relapses with metastases (secondary cancers) are detected early and cured. This approach ensures that chemotherapy and or radiotherapy is only given to the patients who need it. The number of patients ultimately cured is the same using surveillance as post-operative &quot;adjuvant&quot; treatments, but the patients have to be prepared to follow a prolonged series of visits and tests.

For both non-seminomas and seminomas, surveillance tests generally include physical examination, blood tests for tumor markers, chest x-rays, and CT scanning. However, the requirements of a surveillance program differ according to the type of disease since, for seminoma patients, relapses can occur later, and blood tests are not as good at indicating relapse.

CT scans are performed on the abdomen (and sometimes the pelvis) and also the chest in some hospitals. Chest X-rays are increasingly preferred for the lungs as they give sufficient detail combined with a lower false-positive rate and significantly smaller radiation dose than CT.

The frequency of CT scans during surveillance should ensure that relapses are detected at an early stage while minimizing radiation exposure.

For patients treated for stage I non-seminoma, a randomized trial (Medical Research Council TE08) showed that, when combined with the standard surveillance tests described above, 2 CT scans at 3 and 12 months were as good as 5 over 2 years in detecting relapse at an early stage.

For patients treated for stage I seminoma who choose surveillance rather than undergoing adjuvant therapy, there have been no randomized trials to determine the optimum frequency of scans and visits, and the schedules vary very widely across the world, and within individual countries. In the UK there is an ongoing clinical trial called TRISST. This is assessing how often scans should take place and whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used instead of CT scans. MRI is being investigated because it does not expose the patient to radiation and so, if it is shown to be as good at detecting relapses, it may be preferable to CT.

For more advanced stages of testicular cancer, and for those cases in which radiation therapy or chemotherapy was administered, the extent of monitoring (tests) after treatment will vary based on the circumstances but normally should be done for five years in uncomplicated cases and for longer in those with higher risks of relapse.

===Fertility===
A man with one remaining testis may remain fertile. However, sperm banking may be appropriate for men who still plan to have children, since fertility may be adversely affected by chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. A man who loses both testicles will be infertile after the procedure, though he may elect to bank viable, cancer-free sperm before the procedure.

== Psychological factors of testicular cancer ==
Although testicular cancer has a low mortality rate and better prognosis outcomes, psychological factors still affect cancer patients struggling with a diagnosis. This means that the absence of testicles can influence perceptions of masculinity, sexual identity, and body image. Castration or partial removal is associated with fantasies, beliefs, myths, and cultural norms surrounding the testes, which can lead to severe psychological trauma and consequences for the individual. Consequently, worries regarding sexual and reproductive capabilities may induce feelings of despair, inadequacy, and emotional turmoil. Factors that are associated with a decrease in psychological outcomes are early adulthood, partnership status, work status, sexual dysfunction, diminished masculinity, and adaptive mechanisms.

=== Masculinity and sexual identity ===
Biological ideas about masculinity say that human bodies confirm their gender, so changes or damage to our reproductive system can affect how men feel about being men. Since testicles have long been seen as symbols of strength, bravery, and masculinity, having surgery to remove them can change how men with testicular cancer view themselves and what it means to be a man.

==== Social stigma related to masculinity and sexual identity ====
Males aged 18–24 encounter distinct gender-specific social factors that are linked to a decrease in mental health outcomes. These social factors include limited access to health services and engagement, stigma related to masculinity, and cultural expectations. Single or unemployed men are at a higher risk of poorer psychological outcomes that are correlated with an impairment of sexual functions and masculinity. Another factor that is related to experiencing negative effects related to masculinity is not having children, due to not being able to meet traditional expectations of being a protector or provider. Men who felt that losing a testicle made them less masculine also felt negative psychological effects.

New research shows that testicular cancer survivors who have low testosterone levels feel less masculine than those with normal testosterone levels. These concerns are important for teenage boys going through puberty or recently experiencing physical changes, which can shape their developing understanding of their sexual identity. For example, gynecomastia, which is when males develop enlarged breasts during puberty, is a common and normal part of growing up. However, only up to 11% of patients diagnosed with testicular cancer have gynecomastia when they first seek medical attention, and about 4% of males checked for gynecomastia turn out to have testicular cancer. After testicular cancer, some men feel less masculine, but how much cancer affects masculinity varies from person to person.

=== Body image ===
New studies show that 16% of survivors have serious concerns about how they look after the removal of a testicle. These survivors worry about feeling awkward and anxious because of their missing testicles, and they feel different from other people. Even though 52% of survivors felt that their bodies had changed a lot because of cancer and treatment, 88% of the spouses didn&#x27;t think their partners were any less attractive.

How survivors feel about their bodies is a big factor in deciding whether to get a testicular prosthesis. Many worry about losing their masculinity, and how they see themselves, and just want to look and feel normal again. Looking back at how testicular prostheses were used, especially with many teenagers, there were noticeable improvements in how people felt about their bodies and themselves overall one year after getting an implant. They also felt more comfortable during sexual activities.

=== Anxiety and depression ===
After having the testicles removed through orchiectomy, testicular cancer survivors may experience long-lasting feelings of sadness or embarrassment. Research has shown that these emotions are more prevalent among younger and unmarried men compared to older and partnered individuals. The most common psychological problem faced by men diagnosed with testicular cancer is anxiety. New research suggested that there was no direct comparison between people who have been diagnosed with testicular cancer and the general population. Studies show that anxiety is more frequent among testicular cancer survivors of similar gender and age compared to the general population, affecting about 1 in 5 survivors. Depression does not seem to burden testicular cancer patients as much as anxiety.

=== Fear of recurrence ===
Around one out of every three testicular cancer survivors experience significant fear of the cancer coming back, and this fear is considered the most troubling issue for them. Unmarried men reported they felt less fear of cancer recurrence than men who were in a relationship. Survivors who have a fear of recurrence of their cancer tend to have more:

* Intrusive thoughts
* Feel more depressed
* Stressed
* Experience poorer physical well-being 

Being diagnosed with testicular cancer often destroys many men&#x27;s feelings of being invincible and brings up unexpected questions about life and purpose. They feel a sense of being in between or on the threshold of a new identity. This involves feeling disconnected from those who haven&#x27;t been through a similar intense experience, questioning the purpose of their existence, and becoming more aware of life&#x27;s fragility and the certainty of death. New research suggests that certain testicular cancer survivors think their cancer was triggered by their stress sensitivity. This may be why some survivors have a fear of recurrence more than 10 years after treatment, even though the actual risk of recurrence is around 1%.

=== Biological and psychological factors of sexual dysfunction ===
Sexual dysfunction can present as a symptom in people who have been diagnosed with testicular cancer. Sexual dysfunction can stem from biological factors, psychological factors, or a blend of both. Difficulties in physiological aspects such as achieving erection and ejaculation are correlated with the severity of the disease and the methods of treatment employed such as surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy. Conversely, psychological aspects such as libido and satisfaction remain unaffected by the type of treatment received. Nonetheless, treatment approaches for testicular cancer can induce physiological alterations while simultaneously eliciting emotional responses.  Therefore, diminished sexual function (such as decreased libido or inhibition) may result from treatment-related physical factors like fatigue, overall discomfort, hair loss, and significant weight fluctuations, as well as emotional factors including concerns about sexual performance, fear of losing control, and ambiguity regarding what lies ahead.

=== Post-traumatic growth from testicular cancer ===
Not every survivor of testicular cancer has negative outcomes of depression and some even may gain positive outcomes from their experience. This means that when looking at outcomes across all testicular cancer survivors, the positives and negatives could balance each other out. Many cancer survivors, both young and older adults, have reported benefits and personal growth in the months and even years following their diagnosis. Furthermore, researchers have discovered that while the journey of testicular cancer initially brings physical and emotional challenges, it also leads many survivors to develop a newfound gratitude for life. Besides improving mental outlook, going through testicular cancer might also motivate men to adopt healthier behaviors such as:

* More physical activity
* Reduce or stop smoking

These positive changes in lifestyle could contribute to better psychological well-being, which can offset any initial difficulties they face.

==Epidemiology==
Globally testicular cancer resulted in 8,300 deaths in 2013 up from 7,000 deaths in 1990. Testicular cancer has the highest prevalence in the U.S. and Europe, and is uncommon in Asia and Africa. Worldwide incidence has doubled since the 1960s, with the highest rates of prevalence in Scandinavia, Germany, and New Zealand.

Although testicular cancer is most common among men aged 15–40 years, it has three peaks: infancy through the age of four as teratomas and yolk sac tumors, ages 25–40 years as post-pubertal seminomas and non-seminomas, and from age 60 as spermatocytic tumors.

Germ cell tumors of the testis are the most common cancer in young men between the ages of 15 and 35 years.

===United States===
In the United States, about 8,900 cases are diagnosed a year. The risk of testicular cancer in white men is approximately 4–5 times the risk in black men, and more than three times that of Asian American men. The risk of testicular cancer in Latinos and American Indians is between that of white and Asian men. The cause of these differences is unknown.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, approximately 2,000 people are diagnosed a year. Over a lifetime, the risk is roughly 1 in 200 (0.5%). It is the 16th most common cancer in men. It accounts for less than 1% of cancer deaths in men (around 60 men died in 2012).

==Other animals==
Testicular tumors occur also in other animals. In horses, these include interstitial cell tumors and teratomas. Typically, the former is found in older stallions (affected stallions may become extremely vicious, suggesting excessive production of androgen), and the latter is found in young horses and is large.

<text>Golden Gate University (GGU or Golden Gate) is a private university in San Francisco, California, United States. Founded in 1901, GGU specializes in educating professionals through its schools of law, business, taxation, technology, accounting, and undergraduate studies. The university offers 4 undergraduate degrees and 18 graduate degree programs.

==History==

Golden Gate University evolved out of the literary reading groups of the San Francisco Central YMCA at a time when, according to one contemporary estimate, only one of every two thousand men had a college education. GGU shares its YMCA roots with a number of other U.S. universities, including Bentley University, Capital University Law School, Michigan State University College of Law, Northeastern University (Boston, Massachusetts), Northern Kentucky University Salmon P. Chase College of Law, Roosevelt University, South Texas College of Law, University of Toledo College of Law, Western New England University, and Youngstown State University. On November 1, 1881 at the YMCA building at 232 Sutter Street, which the organization had occupied since 1868, the YMCA Night School was established. Classes were offered in bookkeeping, mathematics, stenography, elocution, Spanish and gymnastics. Successful completion of these courses led to a certificate that was recognized by more than 100 colleges and trade schools. Other offerings of the association would include a common school for boys. In April 1894 the YMCA moved to a new five-story building at the northeast corner of Mason and Ellis Streets.
The night school was renamed the Evening College on October 1, 1896, and became a full-fledged operation in 1901 with the creation of a law school. The law school was the first of the Y&#x27;s educational departments to offer a full degree-level course, and thus the university traces its founding to the law school&#x27;s establishment. Courses in Accountancy and Business Administration leading to the degree of Bachelor of Commercial Science began in 1908. Later, courses in foreign trade were added. The YMCA building was destroyed in the fire that followed the 1906 earthquake. Following the earthquake, the school was conducted out of tents, and later leased space at 1220 Geary St. (now Geary Boulevard near Franklin Street in the Western Addition). In November 1910 the school moved into the YMCA&#x27;s new building (closed in 2009) at 220 Golden Gate Avenue at Leavenworth Street, in the Tenderloin neighborhood.

A student contest in 1927 resulted in the adoption of the new name Golden Gate because contest judges thought it symbolized &quot;romantic California&quot;. The institution was separately incorporated from the Central YMCA on May 18, 1923, as Golden Gate College with the power to confer degrees as California law then provided. The college became fully independent of the YMCA in 1962; however, the &quot;Y&quot; contributed members to the school&#x27;s Board of Trustees for some time thereafter.

The college continued to share the YMCA&#x27;s building until June 1968, when it moved into the Allyne Building, a warehouse at 536 Mission Street originally built in 1924 as the showroom and wholesale department of Sherman Clay, a large retailer of pianos, records, record players, and other musical instruments. The college had purchased the building at auction in April 1964, and the law school had occupied the first two floors since December 1964.

In 1972, the college expanded and elevated itself to university status. In 1979, a new &quot;west wing&quot; of the university was completed, where most of the classroom space is located today.

==Academics==
Golden Gate University is primarily a post-graduate institution focused on professional training in law and business, with its smaller undergraduate programs linked to its larger graduate and professional schools. Its six schools, with the year a university degree was first offered in the academic discipline, are:

*Golden Gate University School of Law (1901)
*Edward S. Ageno School of Business (1908)
*School of Accounting (1908)
*Bruce F. Braden School of Taxation (1970)
*School of Undergraduate Studies (2019)

Golden Gate University School of Law was founded in 1901. The School of Law offers the MSL, LLM, and JSD degrees. The school is no longer accepting students seeking the JD degree.

The School of Undergraduate Studies offers the degrees of AA, BA, and BS.

The Ageno School of Business offers the degrees of MA, MS, MBA, Executive (part-time) MBA (EMBA), MPA, and DBA.

Additionally, the degrees of Master of Arts in Counseling Psychology and Master of Arts in Industrial-Psychology are offered.

The Braden School of Taxation offers a Master of Taxation, and the School of Accounting offers an MS in Accounting Data &amp; Analytics (MSA).

===Undergraduate admissions===
Golden Gate University requires a minimum 2.0 high school GPA for admission and does not require submission of either SAT or ACT scores. Some of the bachelor’s degree programs may have additional application requirements. Golden Gate University has not reported high school GPA data for its accepted students..

===Accreditation===
Golden Gate University has been accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) or its successor organization, the WASC Senior College and University Commission since 1959. It had previously been accredited by what is now the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities since 1950. Additionally, the school of law has been accredited by the American Bar Association (ABA) since August 1956 and the Committee of Bar Examiners of the State Bar of California since 1940 (standards for accreditation having been adopted in 1937). The university&#x27;s financial planning program is registered with the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards and students completing either the undergraduate minor in financial planning or the certificate in financial planning qualify to sit for the Certified Financial Planner (CFP) certification exam.

===Online programs===
Golden Gate first offered distance education programs in 1993 via correspondence, online courses in 1997, then began offering fully accredited online degree programs in 1998. Online offerings include 13 graduate degrees, two undergraduate degrees, seven graduate certificates, and 10 undergraduate certificates, all of which can be completed entirely online. GGU currently uses the Moodle online learning platform to manage and deliver course content.

===Rankings===
* In 2025, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; did not rank Golden Gate University&#x27;s undergraduate programs. The only Graduate School Rankings by &quot;U.S. News&quot; were for the Golden Gate University School of Law (No.178-196 out of 196, bottom 8% at most) and its Public Affairs Program (tied for No.247 out of 271 programs).
*Washington Monthly Ranked Golden Gate University No.1 on its list of Best Colleges for Adult Learners four years in a row (2016, 2017, 2018, 2019)

==Administration==
At its incorporation as a separate institution from the YMCA in 1923, the college governance was divided between a four-member (increased to nine members in 1948) Board of Governors, which ran educational programs of the college including the conferral of degrees, and a five-member Board of Trustees to hold the college property. The appointments of the director, governors and trustees were made by the San Francisco YMCA. A 1948 reorganization raised the director of education to president, the incumbent director, Nagel T. Miner (since 1931), becoming president. In September 1949 the board of governors and board of trustees were merged, with all current trustees retiring, and the members of the board of governors being elected onto the board of trustees, which had 14 members out of a possible maximum of 21 members.

Currently, the university is managed by a self-sustaining board of trustees of between 15 and 20 members. Trustees serve 3-year terms with one-third up for election annually. The president of the university and the president of the Alumni Association hold voting seats on the board. Additionally, there are four non-voting ex officio members, the President of the Student Government, the President of the Student Bar Association (law school student government); the President of the University Faculty Senate, and the chair of the law faculty. The trustees are selected from the worlds of business, law, accounting, taxation, and philanthropy. Since 2003 the majority of trustees have been alumni of the university. Of the current trustees all but three have at least one academic degree (excluding honorary degrees) from GGU.

The day-to-day operation of the university is in the hands of a president, provost, vice-presidents, and the deans of the schools (Accounting, Business, Law, Undergraduate Studies, and Taxation).

===Presidents===
Before 1948, the top executive was called the educational director.

<text>The Football Association of Wales (FAW; ) is the governing body of association football and futsal in Wales, and controls the Wales national football team, its corresponding women&#x27;s team, as well as the Wales national futsal team. It is a member of FIFA, UEFA and the IFAB.

Established in 1876, it is the third-oldest national association in the world, and one of the four associations, along with the English Football Association, Scottish Football Association, and Irish Football Association that make up the International Football Association Board, responsible for the Laws of the Game.

== History ==

=== 19th century ===
The FAW was founded at a meeting held on 2 February 1876 at the Wynnstay Arms Hotel in Wrexham, initially to formalise the arrangements for the forthcoming match against Scotland.

In May 1876, a further meeting was called, this time in the ballroom of the Wynnstay Arms Hotel in Ruabon, where the name &quot;Football Association of Wales&quot; was agreed and the constitution drawn up. The arguments and discussions continued so long that the local policeman came in to call time.&quot;Sadly we have no record of the words actually used by the police constable as he stood sternly surveying the scene in the Wynnstay Arms, Ruabon, on that May night in 1876; but what they amounted to was that even if the gentlemen were busy forming the Football Association of Wales it was past closing time so would they mind forming it somewhere else… &quot;

Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn was in attendance; as the local JP (and also the incumbent Member of Parliament), he went next door, opened the court, extended the hotel&#x27;s licensing hours and thus enabled the meeting to continue. The meeting ended with Llewelyn Kenrick appointed as the first chairman and honorary secretary, with John Hawley Edwards as first treasurer.

Kenrick continued to serve the FAW until 1884, when he left, probably because of the trend towards professionalism. In 1897, when the FAW secretary was charged with fraud, Kenrick returned to guide the association through the crisis. He made the final break a few months later over the minor issue of the allocation of gate money to Welsh Cup semi-finalists and finalists.

Inspired by the success of the FA Cup, in 1877 the FAW ran the inaugural Welsh Cup competition. The trophy was intended to raise the standard of play and organisation of football in Wales. As such, English border clubs were invited to participate. However the prominent north–south divide within Wales meant that the association did not set up a national league.

=== 20th century ===

By the 20th century, Wales&#x27;s senior clubs were competing in English league competitions, thus reducing the importance of the lower standard and less glamorous Welsh Cup. The allocation of a place in the European Cup Winners Cup from 1960 did boost interest in the competition, but it has remained secondary in the priorities of Wales&#x27; leading clubs.

The FAW is financially reliant on the proceeds of international matches. A lack of success on the pitch, Wales&#x27; unstable economy and a recurring inability to pick its star players have all meant that the association has struggled to achieve financial security. In the second half of the 20th century this was compounded by a failure to take full advantage of the new commercial and television opportunities that the wider game has enjoyed. On occasions financial problems have led the FAW to stage Wales&#x27; home matches in English stadia, whose capacities were larger than at domestic grounds.

The FAW&#x27;s inability to always pick the best players for the national side was rooted in the Welsh game&#x27;s subservience to English football. The FAW had no powers to demand players employed outside Wales be released for its international games. With Wales&#x27; best players mostly employed by English clubs, her national team was reliant on clubs&#x27; willingness to release players. This caused recurring tensions as the Football League and its clubs tried to impose their authority over the national associations.

Many of the FAW&#x27;s members have also always been affiliated to the FA, thus creating an uncertainty over the association&#x27;s responsibilities and powers. Its unwillingness and inability to assert its independence was illustrated by it following the FA out of FIFA in 1919 and 1928, only to rejoin when its English counterpart did so in 1946. Before World War II, like Wales as a whole, the FAW&#x27;s ambitions for recognition were firmly within a British context. Wales&#x27; first international against opponents from beyond Britain was not until a match against France in 1933.

In 1951, which was the association&#x27;s 75th anniversary, they commissioned a new logo for the team. It was designed by H. Ellis Tomlinson, an English educationist and heraldist. By November of the same year, the design was granted by the College of Arms.

The FAW&#x27;s internal relationships were no easier, due to a history of tension between members from north and south Wales. Before World War II it did not even have complete control over football in the whole nation. The South Wales and Monmouthshire FA (founded in 1893) essentially acted as an independent association for all purposes except the national team. Although the south was represented on the FAW, the north effectively retained control of its decision-making council until the 1970s. The location of home internationals was the most common source of tension until 1989 when it was decided to hold all home games in the National Stadium at rugby&#x27;s Cardiff Arms Park. When in 1985 the FAW moved its headquarters from Wrexham in the north to the capital Cardiff, the balance of power shifted firmly to the south.

By the 1980s there was concern within the FAW that its very existence was under threat. There were four independent associations within the UK. This state of affairs was unique, and the result of football&#x27;s British origins. As pressure grew from non-European associations for a greater say in the running of football, Britain&#x27;s special position became vulnerable. The case for Wales as a football nation was particularly weak in foreign eyes given the absence of any national league. Thus the FAW founded the League of Wales in 1992 to try and ensure its very future. Over 100 years after the formation of its national association, Wales finally became a football nation with its own national league.

Yet despite the entry to European competitions that the league offered, Welsh clubs playing in England were less than enthusiastic about its prospects, and a prolonged battle with the association began. This ended up in the High Court and defeat for the FAW in its attempt to coerce clubs to join the League of Wales. The league and the FAW emerged with their credibility and finances damaged, while Wales&#x27; best teams and players continue to play outside the immediate jurisdiction of their national association.

The 1990s also saw the FAW struggle to establish its credibility with Welsh fans. Its choice of national manager, the weaknesses of its national league and its unmeritocratic committee structure left the association vulnerable to public criticism.

=== 21st century ===

In the 21st century, the FAW modernised, developed innovative marketing strategies and concentrated on improving its relationships with fans and on being seen as an important Welsh cultural institution. This centred on its Together Stronger campaign and culminated in qualification for Euro 2016.

The FAW is also responsible for all disciplinary actions against players in teams associated with the FAW. This includes Welsh teams playing in the English football pyramid, superseding the English FA disciplinary system with the exception of Cardiff City and Swansea City A.F.C.

In 2020 the FAW announced a major restructure of the Welsh female domestic leagues after a period of consultation with stakeholders. The statement confirmed that the goal was to &quot;provide competitive women&#x27;s football appropriate to playing standards, economic means, geographical location, facilities and club structure.&quot;

In 2021, chief executive Jonathan Ford lost a FAW board vote of no confidence after facing criticism for hiring Angela van Den Bogerd, due to her role in the Post Office scandal. He stepped down in March of that year, and she resigned shortly afterwards.

In October 2022, the FAW announced it was considering rebranding the Wales national football team as &quot;Cymru&quot;, the Welsh language name for Wales, in international events. The association already uses the term in its internal and external communications, including its staff at its base in the Vale of Glamorgan. The association said it was in discussions with UEFA over how to change the name, and were inspired by Turkey&#x27;s rebrand to .

== Structure ==
The FAW is based at Hensol in the Vale of Glamorgan. It is governed by a council, including nineteen councillors who are either elected, or appointed every four years.

In 2012 chief executive Jonathan Ford claimed the FAW had an income of £14 million, funded from FIFA, UEFA, grants, sponsorship and television revenue. All expenditure was on the further development of the game.

In 2013 Dragon Park, the Wales National Football Development Centre, opened in Newport.

<text>The Moriori are the first settlers of the Chatham Islands ( in Moriori; in Māori). Moriori are Polynesians who came from the New Zealand mainland around 1500 CE, which was close to the time of the shift from the archaic to the classic period of Polynesian Māori culture on the mainland. Oral tradition records migration to the Chathams in the 16th century. The settlers&#x27; culture diverged from mainland Māori, and they developed a distinct Moriori language, mythology, artistic expression and way of life. Currently there are around 700 people who identify as Moriori, most of whom no longer live on the Chatham Islands. During the late 19th century some prominent anthropologists proposed that Moriori were pre-Māori settlers of mainland New Zealand, and possibly Melanesian in origin; this hypothesis has been discredited by archaeologists since the early 20th century, but continued to be referred to by critics of the Treaty of Waitangi settlement process into the 21st.

Early Moriori formed tribal groups based on eastern Polynesian social customs and organisation. Later, a prominent pacifist culture emerged; this was known as the law of &quot;nunuku&quot;, based on the teachings of the 16th century Moriori leader Nunuku-whenua. This culture made it easier for Taranaki Māori invaders to massacre them in the 1830s during the Musket Wars. This was the Moriori genocide, in which the Moriori were either murdered or enslaved by members of the Ngāti Mutunga and Ngāti Tama iwi, killing or displacing nearly 95% of the Moriori population.

The Moriori, however, were not extinct, and gained recognition as New Zealand&#x27;s second indigenous people during the next century. Their culture and language underwent a revival, and Moriori names for their islands were prioritised. In February 2020, the New Zealand government signed a treaty with tribal leaders, giving them rights enshrined in law and the Moriori people at large an apology for the past actions of Māori and European settlers. The Crown returned stolen remains of those killed in the genocide, and gifted NZ$18 million in reparations. On 23 November 2021, the New Zealand government passed in law the treaty between Moriori and the Crown. The law is called the Moriori Claims Settlement Act. It includes an agreed summary history that begins with the words &quot;Moriori (ancestors) were the (original inhabitants) of , , (South East Island), and other nearby islands (making up the Chatham Islands). They arrived sometime between 1000 and 1400 CE.&quot;

== History ==

=== Origin ===

The Moriori were hunter-gatherers who lived on the Chatham Islands in isolation from the outside world until the arrival of in 1791. They came to the Chathams from mainland New Zealand, and were descendants of the same Polynesians who settled New Zealand and from whom Māori descended. Uncertainty surrounds the time of the Moriori arrival. Some artefacts from Pitt Island date from the Māori archaic period, estimated to be before AD 1500, but all carbon dating of evidence elsewhere on the islands gives dates after AD 1500. Linguistic similarity and genealogical comparisons with Māori on the South Island indicate the Moriori settlers were from south of Cook Strait. We know Moriori lack genetic diversity, which points to there being only one arrival, possibly with just one canoe. Further educated guesswork points to that arrival being a trading (not war) canoe or canoes (women must have been on board) from the far south that was blown off course while travelling northwards: it could have been taken eastward along the existing ocean current to the Chathams, with archaeological discoveries implying they settled first on Pitt Island before later moving to Chatham Island. The Chathams were the last islands in the Pacific to be settled by Polynesians.

Most of what else is known about the Moriori, their culture and their language, is a matter of speculation. This is because so much evidence has been lost. After the 1835 Māori invasion, all Moriori were either killed, died of newly introduced diseases, or were enslaved. The language and culture of the survivors became intermingled with the Māori language and society before records were made by Europeans. This makes most of what is now known of the pre-contact Moriori the subject of conjecture.

=== Adapting to local conditions ===

The Chathams are colder and less hospitable than the land the original settlers left behind, and although abundant in resources, these were different from those available where they had come from. The Chathams proved unsuitable for the cultivation of most crops known to Polynesians, and the Moriori adopted a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. Food was almost entirely marine-sourced — protein and fat from fish, fur seals, and the fatty young of sea birds. The islands supported about 2,000 people. This lifestyle is confirmed by early European accounts, with one recording that: 


Lacking resources of cultural significance such as greenstone and plentiful timber, they found outlets for their ritual needs in the carving of dendroglyphs (incisions into tree trunks, called &quot;rakau momori&quot;). Typically, most Moriori dendroglyphs depict a human form, but there are also other patterns depicting fish and birds. Some of these carvings are protected by the Hāpūpū / J M Barker Historic Reserve.

As a small and precarious population, Moriori embraced a pacifist culture that rigidly avoided warfare, replacing it with dispute resolution in the form of ritual fighting and conciliation. The ban on warfare and cannibalism is attributed to their ancestor Nunuku-whenua.

This enabled the Moriori to preserve what limited resources they had in their harsh climate, avoiding waste through warfare. However, this lack of training in warfare also led to their later near-destruction at the hands of invading North Island Māori.

Moriori castrated some male infants in order to control population growth.

===European contact (1791–1835)===

The first Europeans to make contact with the Moriori were the crew of on 29 November 1791, while on its voyage to the northern Pacific from England, via Dusky Sound. The &quot;Chatham&#x27;s&quot; captain, William R. Broughton, named the island after John Pitt, 2nd Earl of Chatham and claimed it for Great Britain. The landing party came to shore in Kaingaroa Harbour on the far Northeast coast of Chatham Island. The Moriori at first retreated into the forest once the Europeans landed. Seventy years later the Europeans would be recalled in Moriori oral tradition as containing the god of fire, given the pipes they were smoking and likely female from the clothes they were wearing. It was this interpretation that led to the men returning from the forest to meet the landing party. A brief period of hostility was quickly calmed by the crew putting gifts on the end of Moriori spears, though attempts at trade were unsuccessful. After exploring the area for water the crew again became fearful of Moriori aggression. Some misunderstanding led to an escalation of violence and one Moriori was shot and killed. HMS &quot;Chatham&quot; then left the island with all its crew. Both the diary of Broughton and local oral tradition record that both sides regretted the incident and to some extent blamed themselves for overreacting.

It was this regret in part that led to good relations when the next ships arrived in the islands sometime between 1804 and 1807. They were sealers from Sydney and word of their welcome soon gave the Moriori a reputation of being friendly. During this time at least one Moriori visited the New Zealand mainland and returned home with knowledge of the Māori. As more ships came, sealing gangs were also left behind on the islands for months at a time. Sealers and whalers soon made the islands a centre of their activities, competing for resources with the native population. Pigs and potatoes were introduced to the islands. However, the seals that had religious significance and provided food and clothing to the Moriori were all but wiped out. European men intermarried with Moriori. Māori arrivals created their own village at Wharekauri which became the Māori name for the Chatham Islands.

The local population was estimated at 1,600 in the mid-1830s with about 10% and 20% of the population having died from infectious diseases such as influenza.

===Invasion by Taranaki Māori (1835–1868)===

In 1835 some Ngāti Mutunga and Ngāti Tama, originally from Taranaki, but living in Wellington for about a decade, invaded the Chathams. On 19 November 1835, the brig &quot;Lord Rodney&quot;, a hijacked European ship, arrived carrying 500 Māori (men, women and children) with guns, clubs and axes, and loaded with 78 tonnes of potatoes for planting, followed by another load, by the same ship, of 400 more Taranaki Māori on 5 December 1835. With the arrival of the second group &quot;parties of warriors armed with muskets, clubs and tomahawks, led by their chiefs, walked through Moriori tribal territories and settlements without warning, permission or greeting. If the districts were wanted by the invaders, they curtly informed the inhabitants that their land had been taken and the Moriori living there were now vassals.&quot;

A &quot;hui&quot; or council of all Moriori men was convened at the settlement called Te Awapatiki. Despite knowing that the Māori did not share their pacifism, and despite the argument by younger men that the principle of Nunuku was not appropriate now, two chiefs — Tapata and Torea — declared that &quot;the law of Nunuku was not a strategy for survival, to be varied as conditions changed; it was a moral imperative.&quot; Although this council decided in favour of peace, the invading Māori inferred it was a prelude to war, as was common practice during the Musket Wars. This precipitated a massacre, most complete in the Waitangi area, followed by an enslavement of the Moriori survivors.

A Moriori survivor recalled: &quot;[The Taranaki invaders] commenced to kill us like sheep... [We] were terrified, fled to the bush, concealed ourselves in holes underground, and in any place to escape our enemies. It was of no avail; we were discovered and killed – men, women and children indiscriminately.&quot; A Taranaki Māori conqueror explained, &quot;We took possession... in accordance with our customs and we caught all the people. Not one escaped...&quot; The invaders ritually killed some 10% of the population. Stakes were driven into some of the women, who were left to die in pain.

During the following enslavement the Taranaki Māori invaders forbade the speaking of the Moriori language. They forced Moriori to desecrate their sacred sites by urinating and defecating on them. Moriori were forbidden to marry Moriori or the Taranaki Māori, or to have children with each other. This was different from the customary form of slavery practised on mainland New Zealand. However, many Moriori women had children by their Māori masters. A small number of Moriori women eventually married either Māori or European men. Some were taken from the Chathams and never returned. In 1842 a small party of Māori and their Moriori slaves migrated to the subantarctic Auckland Islands, surviving for some 20 years on sealing and flax growing. Only 101 Moriori out of a population of about 2,000 were left alive by 1862, making the Moriori genocide one of the deadliest in history by percentage of the victim group.

=== Dispersal and assimilation ===

The Moriori were free from slavery by the end of the 1860s which gave them opportunities for self determination, but their small population led to a gradual dilution of their culture. Only a handful of men still understood the Moriori language and culture from before the invasion. The younger generation spoke Māori, while still identifying themselves as Moriori. While attempts were made to record the Moriori culture for posterity, it was generally believed that it would never again be a living way of life. By 1900 there would only be twelve people in the Chatham Islands who identified themselves as Moriori. Although the last Moriori of unmixed ancestry, Tommy Solomon, died in 1933, there are several thousand mixed ancestry Moriori alive today.

In the 2001 New Zealand census, 585 people identified as Moriori. The population increased to 942 in the 2006 census and declined to 738 in the 2013 census. The 2018 census estimated the Moriori population as 996.

=== Waitangi Tribunal claim ===
In the late 1980s some Moriori descendants made claims against the New Zealand government through the Waitangi Tribunal. The Tribunal is charged with making recommendations on claims brought by Māori relating to actions or omissions of the Crown in the period since 1840 that breach the promises made in the Treaty of Waitangi. These claims were the first time the Tribunal had to choose between competing claims of two indigenous groups. The main focus of the claim was the British annexation of the islands in 1842, the inaction of the Government to reports of Moriori being kept in slavery and the awarding of 97% of the islands to Ngāti Mutunga in 1870 by the Native Land Court.

In 1992, while the Moriori claim was active, the Sealords fisheries deal ceded a third of New Zealand&#x27;s fisheries to Māori, but prevented any further treaty fishery claims. This occurred against the backdrop of Māori, Moriori and Pākehā Chatham Islanders all competing for fishing rights, while working together to exclude international and mainland interests. Therefore, it was believed that the result of the Tribunal&#x27;s verdict on the ownership of the Chatham Islands may improve the Moriori ability to acquire some of the allotted fishing rights from the Sealords deal. The Moriori claims were heard between May 1994 and March 1996 and the verdict was strongly in favour of the Moriori case.

This led to an NZ$18 million deal between the Crown and Moriori in 2017. The two parties signed a Deed of Settlement on 13 August 2019. In November 2021, the New Zealand Parliament passed the Moriori Claims Settlement Bill, which completed the Treaty of Waitangi process of the Moriori. Under the terms of the legislation, the settlement package includes a formal Crown apology, the transfer of culturally and spiritually significant lands to Moriori as cultural redress, financial compensation of NZ$18 million, and shared redress such as the vesting of 50 percent of Te Whanga Lagoon.

==Culture and marae==

Today, despite the difficulties that the Moriori have faced, their culture is enjoying a renaissance, both in the Chatham Islands and New Zealand&#x27;s mainland. This has been symbolised with the renewal of the Covenant of Peace at the new Kōpinga marae in January 2005 on Chatham Island. As of 2016, the marae has registered almost 800 Moriori descendants, with more than 3000 associated children. The Kopinga meeting place and Hokomenetai meeting house are based in the town of Waitangi, also on Chatham Island.

In 2001, work began on preserving the vocabulary and songs of the Moriori people. They also received a $6 million grant from the Government to preserve their culture and language. The albatross remains important in Moriori culture: it is seen in the design of the Kōpinga marae and its feathers are worn in the hair of some Moriori as a sign of peace. The relationship between the Moriori and Ngāti Mutunga is improving, and non-violence remains a cornerstone of the Moriori self image.

In 2002, land on the east coast of Chatham Island was purchased by the Crown (the Taia property). It is now a reserve and jointly managed by Moriori and the Crown. The Moriori are also actively involved with preserving the &quot;rakau momori&quot; (tree carvings) on the islands.

== Language ==

The now extinct Moriori language was Eastern Polynesian and closely related to Māori and Cook Island Māori with which it was mutually intelligible. It shared about 70% of its vocabulary with Māori; however, there were significant differences in grammar and pronunciation. There are modern attempts at creating learning materials to ensure the survival of what remains of the language.

== Political organisation ==
In 2001, the two main political groups of Moriori united to form the Hokotehi Moriori Trust; however, some internal disputes remain. The New Zealand Government recognises the Hokotehi Moriori Trust as having the mandate to represent Moriori in Treaty of Waitangi settlement negotiations. It is also a mandated iwi organisation under the Māori Fisheries Act 2004 and a recognised iwi aquaculture organisation in the Māori Commercial Aquaculture Claims Settlement Act 2004. The trust represents Moriori as an &quot;iwi authority&quot; for resource consents under the Resource Management Act 1991, and is a Tūhono organisation. The charitable trust is managed by ten trustees, with representation from both the Chatham Islands, and the North Island and South Island. It is based at Owenga on Chatham Island.

==In popular culture==
Based on the writing of Percy Smith and Elsdon Best from the late 19th century, theories grew up that the Māori had displaced a more primitive pre-Māori population of Moriori (sometimes described as a small-statured, dark-skinned race of possible Melanesian origin) in mainland New Zealand – and that the Chatham Island Moriori were the last remnant of this earlier race. These theories also favoured the supposedly more recent and more technically able Māori. This was used to justify racist stereotyping, colonisation, and conquest by cultural &quot;superiors&quot;. From the view of European settlers this served the purpose of undermining the notion of the Māori as the indigenous people of New Zealand, making them just one in a progression of waves of migration and conquest by increasingly more civilised people.

The hypothesis of a racially distinct pre-Māori Moriori people was criticised in the 20th century by a number of historians, anthropologists and ethnologists; among them anthropologist H. D. Skinner in 1923, ethnologist Roger Duff in the 1940s, historian and ethnographer Arthur Thomson in 1959, as well as Michael King in &quot;Moriori: A People Rediscovered&quot; in 2000, James Belich in 2002, and K. R. Howe in &quot;Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand&quot;.

The idea of Moriori arriving earlier and being vastly distinct from Māori was widely published in the early 20th century. Crucially, this story was also promoted in a series of three articles in the &quot;New Zealand School Journal&quot; of 1916, and the 1934 A. W. Reed schoolbook &quot;The Coming of the Maori to Ao-tea-roa&quot;—and therefore became familiar to generations of schoolchildren. This in turn has been repeated by the media and politicians. However, at no point has this idea completely dominated the discussion, with the academic consensus slowly gaining more public awareness over the 20th century.

The 2004 David Mitchell novel &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot; and its 2012 film adaption both featured the enslavement of Moriori by the Māori on the Chatham Islands in the mid-19th century. The film adaption stars David Gyasi as &quot;Autua&quot;, a Moriori slave, in spite of the fact Gyasi is British of Ghanaian descent and bears no physical resemblance to Moriori people. Scholar Gabriel S. Estrada criticised the depiction of Māori slave culture as being incorrectly depicted in a similar manner to slavery in the United States, featuring enslaved Moriori working on plantations similar to those in the American South. The interchangeability of these two practices has been noted by historians as being a common misconception in popular culture.

<doc id="300237" wikidata="Q6676995" url="?curid=300237" title="Green card">
<text>A green card, known officially as a permanent resident card, is an identity document which shows that a person has permanent residency in the United States. Green card holders are formally known as lawful permanent residents (LPRs). , there are an estimated 12.7 million green card holders, of whom 9 million are eligible to become United States citizens. Approximately 18,700 of them serve in the U.S. Armed Forces.

Green card holders are statutorily entitled to apply for U.S. citizenship after showing by a preponderance of the evidence that they, among other things, have continuously resided in the United States for one to five years and are persons of good moral character. Those who are younger than 18 years old automatically derive U.S. citizenship if they have at least one U.S. citizen parent.

The card is known as a &quot;green card&quot; because of its historical greenish color. It was formerly called a &quot;certificate of alien registration&quot; or an &quot;alien registration receipt card&quot;. Absent exceptional circumstances, immigrants who are 18 years of age or older could spend up to 30 days in jail for not carrying their green cards.

Green card applications are decided by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), but in some cases an immigration judge or a member of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), acting on behalf of the U.S. Attorney General, may grant permanent residency in the course of removal proceedings. Any authorized federal judge may do the same by signing and issuing an injunction. Immigrant workers who would like to obtain a green card can apply using form I-140.

An LPR could become &quot;removable&quot; from the United States after suffering a criminal conviction, especially if it involved a particularly serious crime or an aggravated felony &quot;for which the term of imprisonment was completed within the previous 15 years&quot;.

==History==
The Immigration and Naturalization Service was formed as part of the Department of Labor in 1933, and in 1940 was moved under the Department of Justice along with the Nationality Act of 1940. During the 1940s the predecessor to the &quot;Permanent Resident&quot; card was the &quot;Alien Registration Receipt Card&quot; which on the back would indicate &quot;Perm.Res&quot; in accordance with the Immigration Act of 1924.

The INA, which was enacted by the U.S. Congress in 1952, states that &quot;[t]he term &#x27;alien&#x27; means any person, not a citizen or national of the United States.&quot;

===Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act===
On September 30, 1996, President Clinton signed into law the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA).

An LPR can file an application for naturalization after five years of continuous residency in the United States. This period may be shortened to three years if married to a U.S. citizen or one year during service with the U.S. armed forces. An LPR may submit their applications for naturalization as early as 90 days before meeting the residency requirement. In addition to continuous residency, the applicants must demonstrate good moral character, pass both an English test and a civics test, and demonstrate attachment to the U.S. Constitution. In the summer of 2018, a new program was initiated to help LPRs prepare themselves for naturalization.

Like U.S. citizens, LPRs can sponsor certain family members to immigrate to the United States, but the number of family members of LPRs who can immigrate is limited by an annual cap, and there is a years-long backlog.

=== 2019 &quot;public charge&quot; restrictions on awarding Green cards ===
On August 12, 2019, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) formally announced a new rule restricting poorer immigrants from attaining LPR status. Under the rule, which was slated to take effect on October 15, 2019, legal immigrants who have received public benefits such as Supplemental Security Income, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Medicaid, and public housing assistance for more than a total of twelve months may be classified as a &quot;public charge&quot; ineligible for permanent residency. Immigration official may investigate the health, income, wealth, education, and family of applicants for permanent residency to predict whether they will become a public charge in the future. The term &quot;public charge&quot; appears in the Immigration and Nationality Act, but is not defined by the law. Refugees, asylum seekers, pregnant women, children, and family members of those serving in the Armed Forces are excluded from the restrictions. The Trump administration estimated that 58% of households headed by non-citizens use a public welfare program and half use Medicaid. The Migration Policy Institute estimated that half of all Green Card applicants would be excluded by the rule.

Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, the former acting director of USCIS, stated the policy will &quot;have the long-term benefit of protecting taxpayers by ensuring people who are immigrating to this country don&#x27;t become public burdens, that they can stand on their own two feet, as immigrants in years past have done.&quot; The National Immigration Law Center stated that the rule &quot;will have a dire humanitarian impact, forcing some families to forgo critical lifesaving health care and nutrition. The damage will be felt for decades to come.&quot; The law center announced it would sue to prevent the policy from taking effect.

During his campaign for President of the United States, Joe Biden criticized the Public Charge rule and pledged to revoke it. On February 2, 2021, President Biden signed an executive order that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security review the policy, amongst others.

==Types of immigration==

A foreign national may obtain permanent residency in the United States primarily through the following:
*Sponsorship by a family member
*Employment (immigrant workers and investors)
*Apply as a special immigrant (religious worker)
*Apply as human trafficking and crime victims
*Apply as victims of abuse
*Other categories (e.g. Diversity Visa)
*Through registry (For certain people resided continuously in the U.S. since before Jan. 1, 1972)

===Immigration eligibility and quotas===
==Application process==

Applications for permanent resident cards (green cards) were decided by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) until 2003 when the INS was abolished and replaced by the current Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The whole process may take several years, depending on the type of immigrant category and the country of chargeability. An immigrant usually has to go through a three-step process to get permanent residency:

#Immigrant petition (Form I-140 or Form I-130) – in the first step, USCIS approves the immigrant petition by a qualifying relative, an employer, or in rare cases, such as with an investor visa, the applicant themself. If a sibling is applying, they must have the same parents as the applicant.
#Immigrant visa availability – in the second step, unless the applicant is an &quot;immediate relative&quot;, an immigrant visa number through the National Visa Center (NVC) of the United States Department of State (DOS) must be available. A visa number might not be immediately available even if the USCIS approves the petition, because the number of immigrant visa numbers is limited every year by quotas set in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). There are also certain additional limitations by country of chargeability. Thus, most immigrants will be placed on lengthy waiting lists. Those immigrants who are immediate relatives of a U.S. citizen (spouses and children under 21 years of age, and parents of a U.S. citizen who is 21 years of age or older) are not subject to these quotas and may proceed to the next step immediately, since they qualify for the IR immigrant category.
#Immigrant visa adjudication – in the third step, when an immigrant visa number becomes available, the applicant must either apply with USCIS to adjust their current status to permanent resident status or apply with the DOS for an immigrant visa at the nearest U.S. consulate before being allowed to come to the United States.
#*Adjustment of status (AOS) – Adjustment of status is for when the immigrant is in the United States and entered the U.S. legally. Except for immediate relatives of U.S. citizens, the immigrant must also be in legal status at the time of applying for adjustment of status. For immediate relatives and other relative categories whose visa numbers are current, adjustment of status can be filed for at the same time with the petition (step 1 above). Adjustment of status is submitted to USCIS via form I-485, &quot;Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status&quot;. The USCIS conducts a series of background checks, including fingerprinting for FBI criminal background check and name checks, and makes a decision on the application. Once the adjustment of status application is accepted, the alien is allowed to stay in the United States even if the original period of authorized stay on the Form I-94 is expired, but they are generally not allowed to leave the country until the application is approved, or the application will be abandoned. If the alien has to leave the United States during this time, they can apply for travel documents at the USCIS with form I-131, also called &quot;Advance parole&quot;. If there is a potential risk that the applicant&#x27;s work permit (visa) will expire or become invalid, such as when employees are laid off by the employer and visa sponsor, or the applicant wants to start working in the United States, while they are waiting for the decision about their application to change status, they can file form I-765, to get &quot;Employment Authorization Documents&quot; (also called &quot;EAD&quot;) and be able to continue or start working legally in the United States. In some cases, the applicant will be interviewed at a USCIS office, especially if it is a marriage-based adjustment from a K-1 visa, in which case both spouses (the US citizen and the applicant) will be interviewed by the USCIS. If the application is approved, the alien becomes an LPR, and the actual green card is mailed to the alien&#x27;s last known mailing address.
#*Consular processing – This is the process if the immigrant is outside the United States, or is ineligible for AOS. It still requires the immigrant visa petition to be first completed and approved. The applicant may make an appointment at the U.S. embassy or consulate in their home country, where a consular officer adjudicates the case. If the case is approved, an immigrant visa is issued by the U.S. embassy or consulate. The visa entitles the holder to travel to the United States as an immigrant. At the port of entry, the immigrant visa holder immediately becomes a permanent resident, and is processed for a permanent resident card and receives an I-551 stamp in their passport. The permanent resident card is mailed to their U.S. address within 120 days.
An applicant in the United States can obtain two permits while the case is pending after a certain stage is passed in green card processing (filing of I-485). 
* The first is a temporary work permit known as the Employment Authorization Document (EAD), which allows the alien to take employment in the United States. 
* The second is a temporary travel document, advance parole, which allows the alien to re-enter the United States. Both permits confer benefits that are independent of any existing status granted to the alien. For example, the alien might already have permission to work in the United States under an H-1B visa.

===Application process for family-sponsored visa for both parents and for children===

U.S. citizens may sponsor for permanent residence in the United States the following relatives:
#Spouses, and unmarried children under the age of 21;
#Parents (once the U.S. citizen is at least 21 years old);
#Unmarried children over the age of 21 (called &quot;sons and daughters&quot;);
#Married sons and daughters;
#Brothers and sisters (once the U.S. citizen is at least 21 years old).

U.S. permanent residents may sponsor for permanent residence in the United States the following relatives:
#Spouses, and unmarried children under the age of 21;
#Unmarried children over the age of 21 (called &quot;sons and daughters&quot;);

The Department of State&#x27;s &quot;Visa Bulletin&quot;, issued every month, gives the priority date for those petition beneficiaries currently entitled to apply for immigrant status through immigrant visas or adjustment of status. There is no annual quota for the spouses, unmarried children, and parents of U.S. citizens, so there is no waiting period for these applicants—just the required processing time. However, all other family-based categories have significant backlogs, even with a U.S. citizen petitioner.

Regardless of whether the family member being sponsored is located in the United States (and therefore likely to be applying for adjustment of status) or outside the United States (in which case the immigrant visa is the likely option), the process begins with the filing of an I-130 Petition for Alien Relative. The form and instructions can be found on the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website. Required later in the process will be additional biographic data regarding the beneficiary (the person being sponsored) and a medical examination. Additional documents, such as police certificates, may be required depending on whether immigrant visa (consular processing) or adjustment of status is being utilized. All petitioners must supply the I-864 Affidavit of Support.

=== Application process for illegal immigrants through registry provision ===

Moreover, applicants who are in the United States unlawfully may be eligible to receive a green card under a sole exception. For an illegal immigrant to be granted permanent residency they must abide by the registry date and eligibility criteria. The registry provision date was first developed in 1929 with the intention to aid in the growing number of illegal immigrants. Essentially, only immigrants who entered the United States before a certain date (registry date) qualify to receive a green card. Other parameters include continued stay since entering the country and good moral character. After being created in 1929, congress advanced the registry date a total of four times. First set to only grant residency to individuals who entered the country before or on June 3, 1921, the date was then moved to July 1, 1924, further to July 1, 1940, once more to June 30, 1948 and finally January 1, 1972. The last advancement date comprised the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) along with other regularization provisions which included penalizing institutions that knowingly employed illegal aliens. This was done through a set of congressional amendments that culminated in 1958 Act, where the requirement for non-citizens to be eligible only if they are not subject to deportation was removed. Since then the registry date has not been advanced despite the number of immigrants increasing by 10 million and a total of 385 individuals have been granted a green card since the last registry update in 1986. Currently the provision date only excludes non-citizens that are inadmissible to the United States on criminal or national-security grounds. The updated and current eligibility requirements for registry are as follows:

* You entered the United States prior to Jan. 1, 1972
* You have resided in the United States continuously since you entered
* You are a person of good moral character
* You are not ineligible for naturalization (citizenship)
* You are not removable (deportable) under Section 237(a)(4)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). You are not inadmissible under Section 212(a)(3)(E) of the INA or as a criminal, procurer, other immoral person, subversive, violator of the narcotics laws or noncitizen smuggler

====Green-card holders and families====

Green-card holders married to non-U.S. citizens are able to legally bring their spouses and minor children to join them in the US, but must wait for their priority date to become current. The foreign spouse of a green-card holder must wait for approval of an &quot;immigrant visa&quot; from the State Department before entering the United States. Due to numerical limitation on the number of these visas, the wait time for approval may be months or years. In the interim, the spouse cannot be legally present in the United States, unless they secure a visa by some other means. Green-card holders may petition for permanent residency for their spouse and children.

U.S. green-card holders have experienced separation from their families, sometimes for years. A mechanism to unite families of green-card holders was created by the LIFE Act by the introduction of a &quot;V visa&quot;, signed into law by President Clinton. The law expired on December 31, 2000, and V visas are no longer available. Several bills have been introduced in Congress to reinstate V visas, but so far none have been successful.

====Improving the application process in obtaining a green card====
The most common challenges that USCIS faces in providing services in the green card process are: (1) the length of the application and approval process, and (2) the quotas of green cards granted. USCIS tries to shorten the time qualified applicants wait to receive permanent residence.

=====Challenges with processing time of application=====
Under the current system, immediate family members (spouse, child, and dependent mother and father), have priority status for green cards and generally wait 6 months to a year to have their green card application approved. For non-immediate family members, the process may take up to 10 years. Paperwork is processed on a first-come, first-served basis, so new applications may go untouched for several months. To address the issue of slow processing times, USCIS has made a policy allowing applicants to submit the I-130 and I-485 forms at the same time. This has reduced the processing time. Another delay in the process comes when applications have mistakes. In these cases papers are sent back to the applicant, further delaying the process. Currently the largest cause of long wait times is not processing time, but rather immigrant visa quotas set by Congress.

=====Quota system challenges=====
Because of numerical quotas in many immigration categories, long wait times often prevent immigrants from receiving immigrant visas in a short time frame. The &quot;Augusta Chronicle&quot; in 2006 stated that an estimated two million people are on waiting lists in anticipation to become legal and permanent residents of the United States. Immigrants need visas to get off of these waiting lists, and Congress would need to change immigration law in order to accommodate them with legal status.

The number of green cards that can be granted to family-based applicants depends on what preference category they fall under. An unlimited number of immediate relatives can receive green cards because there is no quota for that category. Family members who fall under the other various preference categories have fixed quotas; however, the number of visas issued from each category may vary because unused visas from one category may roll over into another category.

===Application process for employment-based visa===
Many immigrants opt for this route, which typically requires an employer to &quot;sponsor&quot; (i.e., to petition before USCIS) the immigrant (known as the &quot;alien beneficiary&quot;) through a presumed future job (in some special categories, the applicant may apply on their behalf without a sponsor). The three-step process outlined above is described here in more detail for employment-based immigration applications. After the process is complete, the alien is expected to take the certified job offered by the employer to substantiate their immigrant status, since the application ultimately rests on the alien&#x27;s employment with that company in that particular position.
#Immigrant petition – the first step includes the pre-requisite Permanent Labor Certification upon which the actual petition will reside.
#*Permanent Labor Certification – the employer must legally prove that it has a need to hire an alien for a specific position and that there is no minimally qualified U.S. citizen or LPR available to fill that position, hence the reason for hiring the alien. Some of the requirements to prove this situation include: proof of advertising for the specific position; skill requirements particular to the job; verification of the prevailing wage for a position; and the employer&#x27;s ability to pay. This is currently done through an electronic system known as PERM. The date when the Permanent Labor Certification application is filed becomes the applicant&#x27;s &quot;priority date&quot;. In some cases, for highly skilled foreign nationals (EB1 and EB2 &quot;National Interest Waiver&quot;, e.g. researchers, athletes, artists or business executives) and &quot;Schedule A&quot; labor (nurses and physical therapists), this step is waived. This step is processed by the United States Department of Labor (DOL). The Permanent Labor Certification is valid for 6 months from the time it is approved.
#*Immigrant petition – the employer applies on the alien&#x27;s behalf to obtain a visa number. The application is form I-140, &quot;Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers&quot;, and it is processed by the USCIS. There are several EB (&quot;employment-based&quot;) immigrant categories (i.e., EB1-EA, EB2-NIW, EB5) under which the alien may apply, with progressively stricter requirements, but often shorter waiting times. Many of the applications are processed under the EB3 category. Currently, this process takes up to 6 months. Many of the EB categories allow expedited processing of this stage, known as &quot;premium processing&quot;.
#Immigrant visa availability. When the immigrant petition is approved by the USCIS, the petition is forwarded to the NVC for visa allocation. Currently this step centers around the priority date concept.
#*Priority date – the visa becomes available when the applicant&#x27;s &quot;priority date&quot; is earlier than the &quot;cutoff date&quot; announced on the DOS&#x27;s Visa Bulletin or when the immigrant visa category the applicant is assigned to is announced as &quot;current&quot;. A &quot;current&quot; designation indicates that visa numbers are available to all applicants in the corresponding immigrant category. Petitions with priority dates earlier than the cutoff date are expected to have visas available, therefore those applicants are eligible for final adjudication. When the NVC determines that a visa number could be available for a particular immigrant petition, a visa is tentatively allocated to the applicant. The NVC will send a letter stating that the applicant may be eligible for adjustment of status, and requiring the applicant to choose either to adjust status with the USCIS directly, or apply at the U.S. consulate abroad. This waiting process determines when the applicant can expect the immigration case to be adjudicated. Due to quotas imposed on EB visa categories, there are more approved immigrant petitions than visas available under INA. High demand for visas has created a backlog of approved but unadjudicated cases. In addition, due to processing inefficiencies throughout DOS and USCIS systems, not all visas available under the quota system in a given year were allocated to applicants by the DOS.
#Immigrant visa adjudication. When the NVC determines that an immigrant visa is available, the case can be adjudicated. If the alien is already in the US, that alien has a choice to finalize the green card process via adjustment of status in the U.S., or via consular processing abroad. If the alien is outside of the United States they can only apply for an immigrant visa at the U.S. consulate. The USCIS does not allow an alien to pursue consular processing and AOS simultaneously. Prior to filing the form I-485 (Adjustment of Status) it is required that the applicant have a &quot;medical examination&quot; performed by a USCIS-approved civil surgeon. The examination includes a blood test and specific immunizations, unless the applicant provides proof that the required immunizations were already done elsewhere. The civil surgeon hands the applicant a sealed envelope containing a completed form I-693, which must be included unopened with the I-485 application.
#*Adjustment of status (AOS) – after the alien has a Permanent Labor Certification and has been provisionally allocated a visa number, the final step is to change their status to permanent residency. Adjustment of status is submitted to USCIS via form I-485, &quot;Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status&quot;. If an immigrant visa number is available, the USCIS will allow &quot;concurrent filing&quot;: it will accept forms I-140 and I-485 submitted in the same package or will accept form I-485 even before the approval of the I-140.
#*Consular processing – this is an alternative to AOS, but still requires the immigrant visa petition to be completed. Prior to 2005, this process was somewhat faster than applying for AOS, so was sometimes used to circumvent long backlogs (of over two years in some cases). However, due to recent efficiency improvements by the USCIS, it is not clear whether applying via consular processing is faster than the regular AOS process. Consular processing is also thought to be riskier since there is no or very little recourse for appeal if the officer denies the application.

===Green card lottery===
Each year, up to 55,000 immigrant visas are made available through the Diversity Visa (DV) program, also known as the Green Card Lottery to people who were born in countries with low rates of immigration to the United States (fewer than 50,000 immigrants in the past five years). Applicants can only qualify by country of chargeability, not by citizenship. Anyone who is selected under this lottery will be given the opportunity to apply for permanent residence. They can also file for their spouse and any unmarried children under the age of 21.

If permanent residence is granted, the winner (and their family, if applicable) receives an immigrant visa in their passport(s) that has to be &quot;activated&quot; within six months of issuance at any port of entry to the United States. If already in the U.S. adjustment of status may be pursued. The new immigrant receives a stamp on the visa as proof of lawful admittance to the United States, and the individual is now authorized to live and work permanently in the United States. Finally, the actual &quot;green card&quot; typically arrives by mail within a few months.

====Green card lottery scams====
There is a growing number of fraudulent green card lottery scams, in which false agents take money from applicants by promising to submit application forms for them. Most agents are not working for the distribution service. Some claim that they can increase the chance of winning the lottery, when in fact, they may delay or not submit the application. Likewise, some claim to provide to winners free airline tickets or other benefits, such as submissions in future years or cash funds. There is no way to guarantee their claims, and there are numerous nefarious reasons for them not to fulfill their promises. Applicants are advised to use only official U.S. government websites, in which the URL ends in .gov.

====Green card lottery e-mail fraud====
Other fraud perpetrators will e-mail potential victims posing as State Department or other government officials with requests to wire or transfer money online as part of a &quot;processing fee&quot;. These fraudulent e-mails are designed to steal money from unsuspecting victims. The senders often use illegitimate e-mail addresses and logos designed to make them look more like official government correspondence. One easy way to tell that an email address is fraudulent is that it does not end with &quot;.gov&quot;. One particularly common fraud email asks potential victims to wire money via Western Union to an individual (the name varies) at the following address in the United Kingdom: 24 Grosvenor Square, London. These emails come from a variety of email addresses designed to impersonate the U.S. State Department. The USCIS blog has published information on this email scam and how to report fraudulent emails to the authorities. The U.S. government has issued warnings about this type of fraud or similar business practices.

====Registry====
The &quot;registry&quot; is a provision of the INA which allows an alien who has previously entered the United States illegally to obtain legal permanent residence simply on the basis of having de facto resided in the country over a very long time. To avail themself of the benefit of this provision, the alien has to prove that they have continuously resided since before the stipulated &quot;registry date&quot;. The concept of &quot;registry&quot; was first added to the INA in 1929, with the registry date set to June 3, 1921. Since then, the registry date has been adjusted several times, being set to July 1, 1924; June 28, 1940; and June 30, 1948. The most recent adjustment to the registry date came with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, when it was set to January 1, 1972. A number of bills have been introduced in Congress since then to further alter the registry date, but they have not been passed.

===Inadmissibility Based on Political Affiliation===
On October 2, 2020, the USCIS declared the inadmissibility based on belonging or affiliation to Communist parties or any, unspecified, &quot;totalitarian party&quot;. Membership or affiliation with such parties, whether US or foreign, would be incompatible with the oath of allegiance to the naturalization of the United States of America, which includes a commitment to &quot;support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States&quot;. Exceptions to the inadmissibility rule include circumstances where membership is: &quot;Involuntary; Solely when under 16 years of age; By operation of law; or For purposes of obtaining employment, food rations, or other essentials of living and where necessary for such purposes.&quot; The ban would affect current members of Chinese Communist Party and Communist Youth League of China, for example.

==Rights and responsibilities of a lawful permanent resident==

Lawful permanent residents, also known as green card holders, have certain rights and responsibilities as highlighted by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services and other federal agencies.

LPRs can secure many types of jobs just like U.S. citizens can. LPRs can register property under their names and live anywhere within the United States. They can similarly operate any type of business in the United States.

LPRs are also subject to similar obligations as U.S. citizens. For example, male LPRs between the ages of 18 and 25 are subject to registering in the Selective Service System. Like U.S. citizens, LPRs must pay taxes on their worldwide income (this includes filing annual U.S. income tax returns). LPRs are not permitted to vote in federal elections and they cannot be elected to federal office. They may vote in certain local elections, and hold local and state offices (subject to state/city law and Constitutionality).

=== Rights ===
* Reside permanently in the United States provided they do not commit actions that would make them removable under the INA.
* Join and serve in the United States Armed Forces, including in many law enforcement agencies.
* Work anywhere in the United States (with the exception of many federal jobs and some companies under contract by the federal government).
* Be protected equally by the law of the United States, their State of residence, and local jurisdictions.
* Travel freely outside the United States for up to one year as a tourist.
* Petition for (or sponsor) certain family members to immigrate to the United States as lawful permanent residents. Such family members include spouse and unmarried children of any age.

=== Responsibilities ===
* Required to obey all laws of the United States, including state laws, and localities.
* Required to file income tax returns and report income to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and state taxing authorities.

==Conditional permanent residents==
As part of immigration reform under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), as well as further reform enacted in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), eligible persons who properly apply for permanent residency based on either a recent marriage to a U.S. citizen or as an investor are granted such privilege only on a conditional basis, for two years. An exception to this rule is the case of a U.S. citizen legally sponsoring a spouse in which the marriage at the time of the adjustment of status (I-485) is more than two years old. In this case, the conditional status is waived and a 10-year &quot;permanent resident card&quot; is issued after the USCIS approves the case. A permanent resident under the conditional clause may receive an I-551 stamp as well as a permanent resident card. The expiration date of the conditional period is two years from the approval date. The immigrant visa category is CR (conditional resident).

When this two-year conditional period is over, the permanent residence automatically expires and the applicant is subject to deportation and removal unless, up to 90 days before the conditional residence expires, the applicant files form I-751 &quot;Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence&quot; (if conditional permanent residence was obtained through marriage) or form I-829 &quot;Petition by Entrepreneur to Remove Conditions&quot; (if conditional permanent residence was obtained through investment) with USCIS to have the conditions removed. Once the application is received, permanent residence is extended in 1-year intervals until the request to remove conditions is approved or denied. For conditional permanent residence obtained through marriage, both spouses must sign form I-751; if the spouses are divorced, it is possible to get a waiver of the other spouse&#x27;s signing requirement, if it can be proved that the marriage was bona fide.

The USCIS requires that the application for the removal of conditions provide both general and specific supporting evidence that the basis on which the applicant obtained conditional permanent residence was not fraudulent. For an application based on marriage, birth certificates of children, joint financial statements, and letters from employers, friends and relatives are some types of evidence that may be accepted. That is to ensure that the marriage was in good faith and not a fraudulent marriage of convenience with a sole intention of obtaining a green card. A follow-up interview with an immigration officer is sometimes required but may be waived if the submitted evidence is sufficient. Both the spouses must usually attend the interview.

The applicant receives an I-551 stamp in their foreign passport upon approval of their case. The applicant is then free from the conditional requirement once the application is approved. The applicant&#x27;s new permanent resident card arrives via mail to their house several weeks to several months later and replaces the old two-year conditional residence card. The new card must be renewed after 10 years, but permanent resident status is now granted for an indefinite term if residence conditions are satisfied at all times. The USCIS may request to renew the card earlier because of security enhancements of the card or as a part of a revalidation campaign to exclude counterfeit green cards from circulation.

The two-year conditional residence period counts toward satisfying a residency requirement for U.S. naturalization, and other purposes. Application for the removal of conditions must be adjudicated before a separate naturalization application can be reviewed by the USCIS on its own merits.

===Differences between permanent residents and conditional permanent residents===
Conditional permanent residents have all of the equal &quot;rights, privileges, responsibilities and duties which apply to all other lawful permanent residents.&quot; The only difference is the requirement to satisfy the conditions (such as showing marriage status or satisfying entrepreneur requirements) before the two-year period ends.

==Abandonment or loss of permanent residence status==
A green-card holder may abandon permanent residence by filing form I-407, with the green card, at a U.S. Embassy.

Under certain conditions, permanent residence status can be lost involuntarily. This includes committing a criminal act that makes a person removable from the United States (an aggravated felony). A person might also be found to have abandoned their status if they move to another country to live there permanently, stay outside the US for more than one year (without getting a re-entry permit before leaving), or fail to file an income tax return on their worldwide income. Permanent resident status can also be lost if it is found that the application or grounds for obtaining permanent residence was fraudulent. The failure to renew the permanent resident card does not result in the loss of status, except in the case of conditional permanent residents as noted above. Nevertheless, failure to renew the card can result in loss of work eligibility and the ability to travel.

A person who loses permanent residence status is immediately removable from the United States and must leave the country as soon as possible or face deportation and removal. In some cases the person may be banned from entering the country for three or seven years, or even permanently.

===Tax costs of green card relinquishment===
Due to the Heart Act 
foreign workers who have owned a green card in eight of the last 15 years and choose to relinquish it will be subject to the expatriation tax, which taxes unrealized gains above $600,000, anywhere in the world. However this will only apply to those people who have a federal tax liability greater than $139,000 a year or have a worth of more than $2 million or have failed to certify to the IRS that they have been in compliance with U.S. federal tax obligations for the past five years.

If the green card is not relinquished, then the holder is subject to double taxation when living or working outside of the United States, whether or not within their home nation, although double taxation may be mitigated by foreign tax credits.

==Reading a permanent resident card==

While most of the information on the card is self-evident, the computer- and human-readable signature at the bottom is not. The format follows the machine-readable travel document TD1 format:

* First line:
:1–2: C1 or C2. C1 = resident within the United States, C2 = permanent resident commuter (living in Canada or Mexico)
:3–5: USA (issuing country, United States)
:6–14: 9-digit number (A#, alien number)
:15: check digit over digits 6–14
:16–30: 13-character USCIS receipt number, padded with &quot;&lt;&quot; as a filler character
* Second line:
:1–6: birth date (in YYMMDD format)
:7: check digit over digits 1–6
:8: gender
:9–14: expiration date (in YYMMDD format)
:15: check digit over digits 9–14
:16–29: country of birth
:30: cumulative check digit (over digits 6–30 (upper line), 1–7, 9–15, 19–29 (lower line))
* Third line:
:surname, given name, middle name, first initial of father, first initial of mother (this line is spaced with &quot;«&quot; between the surname and given name). Depending on the length of the name, the father&#x27;s and mother&#x27;s initials may be omitted.

A full list of category codes (i.e. IR1, E21, etc.) can be found in the &quot;Federal Register&quot; or Foreign Affairs Manual.

Since May 11, 2010, new green cards contain an RFID chip and can be electronically accessed at a distance. They are shipped with a protective sleeve intended to protect the card from remote access, but it is reported to be inadequate.

==Visa-free travel for U.S. permanent residents==

<doc id="300240" wikidata="Q16960267" url="?curid=300240" title="Legends surrounding the papacy">
<text>The papacy has been surrounded by numerous [[legend]]s. Among the most famous are the claims that the papal tiara bears the &quot;Number of the Beast&quot; inscriptions, that a woman was once elected pope, or that the current pope will be the last. The latter claim is false for every known pope barring the incumbent, but it remains theoretically possible.

==Vicarius Filii Dei==
One misconception surrounding the papal tiara suggests that the words (Latin for &quot;Vicar of the Son of God&quot;) exist on the side of one of the tiaras.

The story centres on the widely made claim that, when numerised (i.e., when those letters in the &#x27;title&#x27; that have Roman numeral value are added together as in a chronogram) they produce the number 666, described in the Book of Revelation as the Number of the Beast (the Antichrist), who wears multiple crowns (identified by some as the triple tiara).

 with the non-numeric letters removed gives: VICIVILIIDI = 5 + 1 + 100 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 50 + 1 + 1 + 500 + 1 = 666

This claim has been made by some Protestant sects who believe that the Pope, as head of the Roman Catholic Church, &quot;is&quot; the Beast or the False Prophet mentioned in the Book of Revelation. However, a detailed examination of the existing tiaras shows no such decoration.

Further, is &quot;not&quot; among the titles of the Pope; the closest match is (&quot;Vicar of Christ&quot;, also rendered in English as &quot;Vicar of Jesus Christ&quot;), the numerical values of which do &quot;not&quot; add up to 666, but to 214.

==Pope Joan==

The claim that a woman, often called Pope Joan, became pope first appeared in a Dominican chronicle in 1250. It soon spread Europe-wide through preaching friars. The story grew in embellishment but centered on a set of claims.

The period for this claim is traditionally given as AD 855–858, between the reigns of Leo IV and Benedict III; however, this possibility is unlikely, because Leo IV died on 17 July 855 and Benedict III was elected as his successor on 29 September 855.

Jean de Mailly, a French Dominican at Metz, places the story in the year 1099, in his , which dates from approximately 1250 and gives what is almost certainly the earliest account of the woman who became known as Pope Joan. His compatriot Stephen of Bourbon acknowledges this by placing her rule at approximately 1100. Also, Rosemary and Darrell Pardoe, authors of &quot;The Female Pope: The Mystery of Pope Joan. The First Complete Documentation of the Facts behind the Legend&quot;, is assuming that a more plausible time-frame would be 1086–1108, when there were a lot of antipopes, and the reign of the legitimate popes Victor III, Urban II, and Paschal II was not always established in Rome, since this city was occupied by Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor, and later sacked by the Normans.

Generally, there are two versions of the legend.
*In the first, an English woman, called Joan, went to Athens with her lover, and studied there.
*In the second, a German woman called Giliberta was born in Mainz.

&quot;Joan&quot; disguised herself as a monk, called Joannes Anglicus. In time, she rose to the highest office of the church, becoming a pope.

After two or five years of reign, &quot;Pope Joan&quot; became pregnant and, during an Easter procession, she gave birth to the child on the streets when she fell off a horse. She was publicly stoned to death by the astonished crowd, and according to the legend, removed from the Vatican archives.

As a consequence, certain traditions stated that popes throughout the medieval period were required to undergo a procedure wherein they sat on a special chair with a hole in the seat. A cardinal would have the task of putting his hand up the hole to check whether the pope had testicles, or doing a visual examination. This procedure is not taken seriously by most historians, and there is no documented instance. It is probably a scurrilous legend based on the existence of two ancient stone chairs with holes in the seats that probably dated from Roman times and may have been used because of their ancient imperial origins. Their original purpose is obscure.

In a seventeenth-century study, Protestant historian David Blondel argued that &#x27;Pope Joan&#x27; is a fictitious story. The story may well be a satire that came to be believed as reality. This view is generally accepted among historians.

==Prophecy of the Popes==
According to the Prophecy of the Popes, some interpretations hold that after Pope Benedict XVI, who abdicated on 28 February 2013, there would be one pope left before the destruction of Rome. This individual was labeled by the prophecy as Petrus Romanus.

==Vaticinia de Summis Pontificibus==

A series of manuscript prophecies concerning the Papacy.

==Documents of Jesus Christ==
It is sometimes claimed that there exists a collection of documents that directly refer to Jesus, such as the execution order for Jesus signed by Pontius Pilate, or were personally written by Jesus, explaining to his followers how to conduct the formation of the Catholic Church after his death, or even the exact date of his return to judge mankind. These documents are said to be a closely guarded secret of the Catholic Church, and supposedly are hidden in the Vatican Secret Archives, or at past times in an underground vault if Nazi Germany would invade the Vatican.

However, there is no solid evidence for any of these claims; in history, only one document has ever been attributed to Jesus himself, the Letter of Christ and Abgarus.
Scholars generally believe that those letters were fabricated, probably in the 3rd century AD.
Even in ancient times, Augustine and Jerome contended that Jesus wrote nothing at all during his life. The correspondence was rejected as apocryphal by Pope Gelasius I and a Roman synod (c. 495).

==Jewish legends==
Jewish legends related to the papacy include the Jewish pope Andreas and also concerning the fate of the Menorah, which some, including former Israeli Minister of Religious Affairs Shimon Shetreet, have believed is being held in secret by the Vatican, and the idea of hidden Jewish manuscripts in the Vatican Secret Archives.

<doc id="300242" wikidata="Q1764381" url="?curid=300242" title="Giulia de' Medici">
<text>Giulia Romola di Alessandro de&#x27; Medici (c. 1535 – c. 1588) was the illegitimate, possibly multiracial, daughter of Alessandro de&#x27; Medici, Duke of Florence and his mistress Taddea Malaspina.

Following her father&#x27;s assassination, she was reared at the court of Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici and married advantageously twice.

==Early life==
A child named Giulia Romola, with an unknown father, was baptized in Florence on November 5, 1535; this was probably Giulia. Close to this date, her father had commissioned a portrait of himself drawing a female profile in silverpoint. Art historians believe the portrait may have been intended as a gift for his mistress, Taddea Malaspina, the sister of the marchioness of Massa, to commemorate the birth of their second child, Giulia. Giulia also had an older full brother, Giulio di Alessandro de&#x27; Medici, and at least one half-sister, Porzia de&#x27; Medici.

After her father&#x27;s assassination in 1537 and the ensuing power struggle among the Medici for control of Florence and of the family, Giulia and her brother Giulio were taken from their mother and placed under the guardianship of Alessandro&#x27;s successor, Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici. Cosimo promised to treat the children well and their rooms were as opulent as those of his own children. Maria Salviati, the mother of Cosimo I, supervised the nurseries and watched over Giulia&#x27;s bedside anxiously when the little girl became ill in February 1542. Giulia survived the fever, but her companion in the nursery, Cosimo I&#x27;s illegitimate daughter Bia de&#x27; Medici, died.

As she grew up, Giulia was completely integrated into life at court and was educated to a high standard, as were the daughters and other female wards of Cosimo I. As much attention was paid to Giulia&#x27;s appearance as to that of Cosimo I&#x27;s daughters. When she was twelve or thirteen, Cosimo I&#x27;s wife Eleonora of Toledo was outraged because Giulia&#x27;s riding cloak did not look right; it was not decorated as she had ordered and it was the wrong length. Courtiers noted that the young Giulia was &quot;the image of her father.&quot; Cosimo arranged an advantageous marriage for her with Francesco Cantelmo, the Duke of Popoli, in 1550, when she was about fifteen years old, and provided a dowry for her of an amount that would be worth about eight million United States dollars today.

==Pontormo portrait==
 Giulia is likely the child depicted in a portrait by Pontormo which shows Maria Salviati with a young child. The child had been painted out of the portrait and her image was not detected until 1937.

Some art historians once identified the child as a young Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici, but it is now generally accepted to be Giulia. The child in the portrait appears to be a little girl, rather than a boy, and her expression is anxious. Maria Salviati, who is dressed soberly as befitted a widow, is seen sheltering the vulnerable child against her side. Art historian Gabrielle Langdon argues that the girl&#x27;s demeanor in the portrait is different than would have been expected for the child Cosimo, whose family anticipated his role as a strong leader from his earliest days. It would have been to Cosimo I&#x27;s advantage to commission a portrait depicting his mother as an exemplary widow, affectionately bringing up the orphaned daughter of Cosimo I&#x27;s predecessor. The child&#x27;s full lips, round nose, and curly reddish hair also bear little resemblance to known portraits of Cosimo as a child, though they do to portraits of the young Alessandro. Other girls of about the right age who were at court during this period also do not resemble the child in the portrait. The portrait might be one of the first in Renaissance-era Europe of a girl of presumed African and European ancestry. This painting is in the permanent collection of The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland.

Maike Vogt-Lüerssen argues in an article in &quot;Medicea – Rivista interdisciplinare di studi medicei&quot; that the child in the portrait with Maria Salviati is actually Salviati&#x27;s granddaughter Bia de&#x27; Medici. She believes that the child does not resemble the known portrait of an adult Giulia de&#x27; Medici and that the relationship between Maria Salviati and Giulia was not close enough to have warranted a portrait. Most group portraits were of family members with close blood ties.

==Later life==
Giulia&#x27;s paternity was not seen as a disadvantage at court. Her descent from the main Medici line was honored; her father&#x27;s assassination was compared with the assassination of Julius Caesar by Brutus. Through her mother, Giulia was related to Pope Innocent VIII. She displayed great pride in her family lineage and self-assurance. After the death of her first husband, Francesco Cantelmo, in 1555, the artist Alessandro Allori painted a second well-known portrait of Giulia, who was now in her mid-twenties. She was portrayed as a widow. To her left in the portrait is an intricately carved chair. Its sloping arm may represent steep terrain; art historian Gabrielle Langdon said she detected a faint climbing figure there which may represent Hercules. The Choice of Hercules was a popular allegory during the Renaissance about the victory of virtuous action over vice. Mario de Valdes y Cocom, a historian of the African diaspora, argues that the sloping arm of the chair also represents Monte della Verna, which Saint Bonaventure, a Christian scholastic theologian and philosopher, visited and where he was inspired to write his &quot;Itinerarium mentis in Deum&quot;. Bonaventure visited La Verna because this was the location where Francis of Assisi had a vision of a six-winged seraph and received the stigmata. Mario de Valdes y Cocom writes that Giulia&#x27;s grandmother Simonetta da Collevecchio, who was possibly of North African descent, married a mule driver from Collevecchio, a site associated with Monte della Verna. Her father Alessandro was insulted by people who called him Alessandro Collevecchio. Historians believe that the artist is alluding to Bonaventure&#x27;s Neo-Platonic view of God as &quot;the Divine Darkness&quot;. Some modern scholars see the painting as Giulia&#x27;s response to criticism of her grandmother&#x27;s north African descent and marriage to the mule driver from Collevecchio.

During her widowhood she often stayed at the Augustinian convent of San Clemente on San Gallo, where her sister Porzia was abbess. Giulia is recorded as a patron of this convent as well as other Augustinian convents.
A second advantageous marriage was arranged for her soon after with Bernadetto de&#x27; Medici, a first cousin of Cosimo I. She married him on August 14, 1559. Their son Alessandro, who was named for her father, was born the following year on December 17, 1560. During the early years of her marriage to Bernadetto, they entertained lavishly and she may have accompanied her husband on diplomatic missions.

Sometime in the 1560s, her relationship with her former guardian may have cooled when Giulia insisted that she be treated as an equal to Cosimo I&#x27;s mistress, who was regarded with general disdain at court. Other sources indicate that she and her husband were still in good standing with the court when they moved to Naples in 1567. There they battled successfully to win the title and lands to the principality of Ottaviano (see also Princes of Ottajano), which their descendants hold today.

<doc id="300247" wikidata="Q749533" url="?curid=300247" title="Iberian Romance languages">
<text>The Iberian Romance, Ibero-Romance or sometimes Iberian languages are a group of Romance languages that developed on the Iberian Peninsula, an area consisting primarily of Spain, Portugal, Gibraltar, Andorra and French Catalonia. They are today more commonly separated into West Iberian, East Iberian (Catalan/Valencian) and Mozarabic language groups. East Iberian&#x27;s classification is a subject of ongoing scholarly debate, as some argue that the Occitano-Romance languages composed of Occitan along with the aforementioned two are better classified as Gallo-Romance languages.

Evolved from the Vulgar Latin of Iberia, the most widely spoken Iberian Romance languages are Spanish and Portuguese, followed by Catalan-Valencian-Balear and Galician. These languages also have their own regional and local varieties. Based on mutual intelligibility, Dalby counts seven &quot;outer&quot; languages, or language groups: Galician-Portuguese, Spanish, Asturleonese, &quot;Wider&quot;-Aragonese, &quot;Wider&quot;-Catalan, Provençal+Lengadocian, and &quot;Wider&quot;-Gascon.

In addition to those languages, there are a number of Portuguese-based creole languages and Spanish-based creole languages, for instance Papiamento.

==Origins and development==
Like all Romance languages, the Iberian Romance languages descend from Vulgar Latin, the nonstandard (in contrast to Classical Latin) form of the Latin language spoken by soldiers and merchants throughout the Roman Empire. With the expansion of the empire, Vulgar Latin came to be spoken by inhabitants of the various Roman-controlled territories. Latin and its descendants have been spoken in Iberia since the Punic Wars, when the Romans conquered the territory (see Roman conquest of Hispania).

The modern Iberian Romance languages were formed roughly through the following process:
* The Romanization of the local Iberian population.
* The diversification of Latin spoken in Iberia, with slight differences depending on location.

*The break up of Ibero-Romance into several dialects.

* Development of Old Spanish, Galician-Portuguese, Old Leonese and Navarro-Aragonese (the West Iberian languages) and early Catalan language from Latin between the eighth and tenth centuries. The genetic classification of early Navarro-Aragonese, Catalan, and Occitan is unsettled. Some scholars place them within Ibero-Romance (hence they would be East Iberian), others place them instead within Gallo-Romance. Aragonese is further disputed between the East and West Iberian groups.
* Further development into modern Spanish, Portuguese, Aragonese, Asturleonese, Galician, Catalan (see languages of Iberia: languages of Spain, languages of Portugal and languages of Andorra) between the fifteenth and twentieth centuries.

== Common traits between Portuguese, Spanish and Catalan ==
This list points to common traits of these Iberian subsets, especially when compared to the other Romance languages in general. Thus, changes such as Catalan vuit/huit and Portuguese oito vs. Spanish ocho are not shown here, as the change -it- &gt; -ch- is exclusive to Spanish among the Iberian Romance languages.

=== Between Portuguese, Spanish and Catalan ===
==== Phonetic ====
* The length difference between r/rr is preserved through phonetic means as /, so that the second consonant in words such as caro and carro are not the same in any of the three.
* Latin U remains and is not changed to .

==== Semantic ====
* The Iberian Romance languages all maintain a complete essence-state distinction in the copula (the verb &quot;to be&quot;). The &quot;essence&quot; form (Portuguese and Spanish &quot;ser&quot; and Catalan &quot;ser&quot; and &quot;ésser&quot;) is derived in whole or in part from the Latin &quot;sum&quot; (the Latin copula), while the &quot;state&quot; form (&quot;estar&quot; in all three languages) is derived from the Latin &quot;stāre&quot; (&quot;to stand&quot;).

=== Between Spanish and Catalan, but not Portuguese ===
==== Phonetic ====
* The distinction between Latin short &quot;-n-&quot;, &quot;-l-&quot; and long &quot;-nn-&quot;, &quot;-ll-&quot; was preserved by means of palatalizing &quot;-nn-&quot;, &quot;-ll-&quot; to , as in Latin &quot;annum&quot; &gt; Spanish &quot;año&quot;, Catalan &quot;any&quot; vs. Latin &quot;manum&quot; &gt; Spanish &quot;mano&quot;, Old Catalan &quot;man&quot; (modern Catalan &quot;mà&quot;). This also affects some initial L in Catalan. However, in most dialects of Spanish, original has become delateralized. Portuguese maintains the distinction, but in a different way; compare &quot;ano&quot; vs. &quot;mão&quot;.

=== Between Spanish and Portuguese, but not Catalan ===
==== Phonetic ====
* Initial Latin CL/FL/PL are palatalized further than in Standard Italian, and become indistinguishable (to CH in Portuguese and LL in Spanish). 
* Final e/o remains (although its pronunciation changed in Portuguese, and some dialects drop final E).

==== Grammatical ====
* The synthetic preterite, inherited from earlier stages of Latin, remains the main past tense.

=== Between Portuguese and Catalan, but not Spanish ===
==== Phonetic ====
* Velarized L , which existed in Latin, is preserved at the end of syllables, and was later generalized to all positions in most dialects of both languages.
* Stressed Latin e/o, both open and closed, is preserved so and does not become a diphthong.

==Statuses==
Politically (not linguistically), there are four major officially recognised Iberian Romance languages:
* Spanish (see names given to the Spanish language), is the national and official language of 21 countries, including Spain. Spanish is the fourth-most widely spoken language in the world, with over 570 total million speakers, and the second-most widely spoken &quot;native&quot; language. It has a number of dialects and varieties.
* Portuguese, official language in nine countries including Portugal and Brazil. After Spanish, Portuguese is the second most widely spoken Romance language in the world with over 250 million speakers, currently ranked seventh by number of native speakers. Various Portuguese dialects exist outside of the European standard spoken in Portugal.
* Catalan is the official language in Andorra and co-official in the Spanish autonomous communities of Catalonia, Balearic Islands and Valencian Community (where it is known as Valencian), and the Italian city of Alghero. It is also spoken in the French department of Pyrénées-Orientales (Northern Catalonia) without official recognition. Catalan is closely related to Occitan, with the two languages having been treated as one in studies by Occitanist linguists (such as Pierre Bec, or more recently Domergue Sumien). When not treated as one, the two languages are widely classified together as Occitano-Romance languages, a group which is itself sometimes grouped with the Gallo-Romance languages. Catalan has two main dialectal branches (Eastern and Western Catalan) and several subdialects, and is spoken by about 10 million people (ranking the seventy-fifth most spoken language in the world), mostly in five variants: Central Catalan, Northern Catalan, Northwestern Catalan, Valencian and Balearic.
* Galician, co-official in Galicia and also spoken in adjacent western parts of Asturias and Castile and León. Closely related to Portuguese, with Spanish influence. It shares the same origin as Portuguese, from the medieval Galician-Portuguese. Modern Galician is spoken by around 3.2 million people and is ranked 160th by number of speakers.

Additionally, Asturian (dialect of Asturleonese), although not an official language, is recognised by the autonomous community of Asturias. It is one of the Asturleonese dialects along with Mirandese, which in Portugal holds an official status as a minority language.

==Family tree==


The Iberian Romance languages are a conventional group of Romance languages. Many authors use the term in a geographical sense although they are not necessarily a phylogenetic group (the languages grouped as Iberian Romance may not all directly descend from a common ancestor). Phylogenetically, there is disagreement about what languages should be considered within the Iberian Romance group; for example, some authors consider that East Iberian, also called Occitano-Romance, could be more closely related to languages of northern Italy (or also Franco-Provençal, the langues d&#x27;oïl and Rhaeto-Romance). A common conventional geographical grouping is the following:

*East Iberian
*West Iberian

<doc id="300257" wikidata="Q37123" url="?curid=300257" title="Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)">
<text>is a 1991 platform game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega for the Genesis/Mega Drive. It was released in North America on June 23 and in PAL regions and Japan the following month. Players control Sonic the Hedgehog, who can run at near supersonic speeds. Sonic sets out on a quest to defeat Dr. Robotnik, a scientist who has imprisoned animals in robots and seeks the powerful Chaos Emeralds. The gameplay involves collecting rings as a form of health, and a simple control scheme, with jumping and attacking controlled by a single button.

Development began in 1990 when Sega ordered its developers to create a game featuring a mascot for the company. The developers chose a blue hedgehog designed by Naoto Ohshima after he won an internal character design contest, and named themselves Sonic Team to match their character. It uses a novel technique that allows Sonic&#x27;s sprite to roll along curved scenery which was based on a concept by Oshima from 1989. &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, designed for fast gameplay, was influenced by games by the &quot;Mario&quot; creator, Shigeru Miyamoto. The music was composed by Masato Nakamura, bassist of the J-pop band Dreams Come True.

&quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; received positive reviews for its visuals, audio and gameplay and is widely considered one of the greatest video games. It sold over 33 million copies across all platforms, becoming one of the best-selling video games. On the Genesis, which it was bundled with, it sold over 15 million copies, making it the best-selling Genesis game. It established the Genesis as a key player in the 16-bit era and made it competitive with the Super NES. It has been ported to multiple systems and inspired several clones, a successful franchise, and adaptations into other media. &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; was released in 1992.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; is a 2D side-scrolling platform game. The gameplay centers on Sonic the Hedgehog&#x27;s ability to run at high speed through levels that include springs, slopes, bottomless pits and vertical loops. The levels are populated with robot enemies, inside which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals; destroying a robot frees the animal, but is not necessary to complete the game. The player must also avoid touching spikes, falling into bottomless pits, being crushed by moving walls or platforms, and drowning, which may be prevented by breathing air bubbles from vents. Sonic&#x27;s main means of attack is the spin attack, in which he curls into a ball and spins his body, damaging enemies and certain obstacles upon collision. This may be performed by jumping or rolling.

At the start of the game, the player is given three lives, which may be lost if Sonic collides with hazardous enemies or objects while in possession of no rings, falls to the bottom of the level screen, or exceeds an act&#x27;s ten-minute time limit. Signposts act as checkpoints to allow Sonic to return to the most recently activated post when he loses a life. The time resets when he returns to the checkpoint. The game ends when the player runs out of lives, although the player may return to the beginning of the act with three lives if they have any continues.

Scattered around each level are gold rings. Collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life. Rings act as a layer of protection against hazards: if Sonic holds at least one ring when he collides with an enemy or dangerous obstacle, all his rings will scatter. He can recollect some of them again before they disappear. If he is hit without holding any rings, he loses a life. Shields and temporary invincibility can be collected to provide additional layers of protection, but certain hazards, such as drowning, being crushed, falling into bottomless pits, or running out of time, kill Sonic regardless of rings or other protection.

The game is split into six principal zones, followed by a short Final Zone. Each main zone has its own visual style, and while some enemies appear throughout, each zone has unique enemies and obstacles. Each main zone is split into three acts, all of which must be completed. At the end of each main zone&#x27;s third act, the player confronts Dr. Robotnik for a boss fight. For most of the fights, Robotnik&#x27;s vehicle is fitted with different weapons. After completing the sixth zone, the player continues to the single-level Final Zone for a last encounter with Robotnik inside a large machine environment. Destroying Robotnik&#x27;s machine ends the game. A brief animation shows Sonic&#x27;s return to the first zone, with animals liberated from Dr. Robotnik.

If Sonic reaches the end of any zone&#x27;s Act 1 or Act 2 while holding at least 50 rings, a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a bonus stage. In them, Sonic is continually curled up in his Spin Attack animation, and bounces off the bumpers and walls of a fully rotating maze. In these levels, the player earns a number of continues for each multiple of 50 rings collected, but the main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald hidden within the maze. Colliding with any of the blocks marked &quot;GOAL&quot; ends the level.

===Plot===
In his attempt to steal the six Chaos Emeralds and harness their power, Dr. Ivo Robotnik has trapped the animal inhabitants of South Island inside aggressive robots and stationary metal capsules. The player controls Sonic, who aims to thwart Robotnik&#x27;s plans by freeing his animal friends and collecting the emeralds himself. If the player collects all the Chaos Emeralds and completes the game, an ending sequence is shown. If all the emeralds are not collected, Robotnik taunts the player while juggling any of the Chaos Emeralds not collected by the player.

==Development==

===Background and character design===

In the 1980s, Sega had limited success with Genesis ports of its arcade games, but wanted a stronger foothold against its main competitor, Nintendo. In 1988, Sega of Japan began an in-house competition to create a rival to Nintendo&#x27;s mascot Mario. For the next three years, programmers and designers at Sega worked on a brand character to rival Mario. In 1990, Sega ordered its in-house development studio to develop a game featuring a mascot for the company. Sega&#x27;s president Hayao Nakayama wanted a character as iconic as Mickey Mouse.

The team developed ideas for characters, an engine, and gameplay mechanics. Development emphasized speed, so Sega considered fast creatures such as kangaroos and squirrels and eliminated designs not associated with fast animals. One idea, a rabbit able to grasp objects with prehensile ears, showed promise but was too complex for the Genesis hardware. The team narrowed its search to animals that could roll into a ball, their idea for an attacking move, and considered armadillos and hedgehogs. The hedgehog character, proposed by Naoto Ohshima, prevailed. Ohshima went on vacation to New York, taking sketches with him. He went to Central Park and asked locals for their opinions on them, and Sonic was the favorite. A man with a moustache, who eventually became Dr. Robotnik, was in second place.

Sonic was originally teal-colored, then a light shade of blue, but he was changed to dark blue so he would stand out against certain backgrounds and to match the Sega logo. According to Ohshima, Sonic&#x27;s basic design was created by combining Felix the Cat&#x27;s head with Mickey Mouse&#x27;s body. His shoes had buckles through the inspiration of Michael Jackson&#x27;s boots on the album cover for &quot;Bad&quot; and the red and white color scheme of Santa Claus, whom Ohshima saw as the most &quot;famous character in the world&quot;. Sonic&#x27;s spikes were emphasized to make him sleeker, and he was given the ability to spin while jumping (so attacking and jumping could be controlled with one button). The new character was originally named &quot;Mr. Hedgehog&quot;, but the eight-member team changed his name to &quot;Sonic&quot; and took the name Sonic Team.

Ohshima said that &quot;Sonic&quot; was chosen because it represented speed. Ideas proposed to flesh out the character included placing him in a rock band, giving him vampire fangs, and giving him a human girlfriend named Madonna. Sega of America scrapped these ideas to keep his identity simple. Sega of America also expressed concerns that most Americans would not know what a hedgehog is. According to Mark Cerny, who worked in Tokyo as an intermediary between the Japanese and American Sega offices, the American staff felt the character was &quot;unsalvageable&quot;. They made plans to educate Sonic Team on character design with the work of Will Vinton, the creator of the California Raisins. They proposed a full-scale recreation of the character, but compromised with Sonic Team to simply make design changes for western audiences. The antagonist was named &quot;Dr. Eggman&quot; in Japan and &quot;Dr. Robotnik&quot; in other regions as a result of a dispute between Sega&#x27;s American and Japanese divisions.

===Concept and programming===
With a satisfying protagonist established, Sega turned to the programmer Yuji Naka, who had impressed them with his work on &quot;Phantasy Star&quot; and the Genesis port of &quot;Ghouls &#x27;n Ghosts&quot;. Naka was a fan of &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; but wanted something faster, so the game was made to play quickly, which was where he focused most of his effort. Naka explained that the reason he wanted a fast game was that he had ported &quot;Ghouls &#x27;n Ghosts&quot;, and wanted to work on its movement but found it slow.

&quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; was developed by a team of seven: two programmers, two sound engineers, and three designers, although it began with just Ohshima and Naka. People came onto the team as the need for content increased. After being assigned a project with the code name &quot;Defeat Mario&quot;, Ohshima and Naka began work, but encountered problems: Ohshima&#x27;s Rabbit proved hard to program. Catching items and throwing them caused the action&#x27;s rhythm to break. Naka stated that the rabbit was not suitable for his game engine, and he also wanted the game to be playable with only one button. Hirokazu Yasuhara came onto the team to supervise Ohshima and Naka and develop levels. He became the lead designer due to his greater experience, and found the way to make the game playable with only one button by having Sonic do damage by jumping. The trio came up with the idea of him rolling into a ball. After the hedgehog character was chosen, many characters were redrawn, and the team agreed on the environments&#x27; visual complexity, with particular focus on the colors. After this, four people came onto the team to speed development up.

Due to the popularity of Mario, Naka wanted Sonic to take over the American market. Sonic&#x27;s default speed was set to that of Mario while running. Tests were run using the Genesis&#x27; tool library, and problems such as flickering, slow frame rates, and shaky animation soon became apparent. Increasing Sonic&#x27;s speed caused animation problems. Naka solved this by developing an algorithm which retained fluidity. All that was left was to optimize of the game speed to adhere to the staff&#x27;s expectations. The team noticed that different people had different perceptions of the game&#x27;s speed: some believed it was too fast, which caused disagreements. As a result, it was slowed down.

The loop running was implemented in a tech demo by Naka, who developed an algorithm allowing a sprite to move smoothly on a curve by determining its position with a dot matrix. Naka&#x27;s prototype was a platform game with a fast-moving character rolling in a ball through a long, winding tube, and this concept was fleshed out with Ohshima&#x27;s character designs and levels by Yasuhara. Yasuhara originally intended to work on the game for three months due to the delay of his planned move to the United States by the outbreak of the Gulf War, but was engrossed in the project for nearly a year. His designs for levels were intended to attract both hardcore and casual gamers by integrating occasional challenging set pieces into the mostly accessible level design. The color scheme was influenced by the work of pop artist Eizin Suzuki, and the aesthetics of Green Hill were influenced by the geography of California.

In designing the gameplay, Naka was inspired by the &quot;Mario&quot; creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, whose games he had enjoyed playing years earlier. Admiring the simplicity of Miyamoto&#x27;s mechanics in complex environments, Naka decided that Sonic would be controlled with only a directional pad for movement and a single button for jumping. He also wanted his creation to be more action-oriented than the &quot;Mario&quot; series; while playing &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, he had wondered why the levels could not be cleared more quickly.

Ohshima, Naka and Yasuhara worked 19 hours a day on the project for several months. Due to the need to demonstrate the Genesis&#x27; technological prowess, the game underwent extensive testing and redesign, which took over six months. According to Naka, the game had the fastest-ever character speed in a video game and a rotation effect in the bonus stages that had been considered impossible on the console.

The team intended to add a two-player mode displayed via split-screen, but Naka&#x27;s programming knowledge was insufficient to implement it. A two-player mode appeared in &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; (1992), whereby the second player controls Sonic&#x27;s sidekick Miles &quot;Tails&quot; Prower. Sonic Team also intended to include a sound test with animations of Sonic breakdancing to a band of animal characters; including a crocodile keyboardist who was later introduced into the series as Vector the Crocodile in &quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot; in 1995. The sound test was scrapped for time reasons and Naka used the freed up memory to add the &quot;Se-ga!&quot; chant used in TV commercials as a startup sound.

Naka&#x27;s relationship with Sega was tenuous during this time, and he received little credit for his work. He left the company shortly after the game&#x27;s release, although Sega of America hired him later. Before leaving, however, he defied Sega&#x27;s prohibition of developer credits by displaying a few names in black text on a black background, identifiable only by looking at the code. Naka stated that level design was a major challenge: he created maps much wider than normal and tried to ensure players would not get lost. It took him around eight months to develop Green Hill Zone as he kept restarting from scratch. He stated that he found the process &quot;very interesting&quot;. Naka also stated that the team was trying to create smooth maps, and that implementing looping structures was a challenge because Sonic would break through them instead of running around them. The backgrounds were also a challenge, as the game&#x27;s speed created the impression of going backwards. The zones were based on designs by Naka and Ohshima, with the goal of creating the world&#x27;s fastest action game. According to Ohshima, Robotnik was based on Humpty Dumpty.

Yasuhara wanted the game to appeal to both Japanese and American players, which was why Green Hill Zone was redesigned many times. Sonic Team wanted the level to portray the character correctly. Its checkered ground was inspired by 3D image rendering from computers, an idea Naka obtained from Sega developer Yu Suzuki, who used this technique with &quot;Space Harrier&quot;. The team read &quot;Famitsu&quot; to stay informed of what their rivals were doing so they could avoid their mistakes.

===Music===
Sega director Fujio Minegishi had connections to the music industry and suggested his friend Yūzō Kayama write the &quot;Sonic&quot; score. However, Sonic Team did not think Kayama&#x27;s music would fit, and so commissioned Masato Nakamura, bassist and songwriter of the J-pop band Dreams Come True. Nakamura said he was surprised, as he had just started with Dreams Come True, but accepted as he was inspired by the team&#x27;s desire to outperform Nintendo. He said the hardest part was working with the limited number of sounds that could play concurrently: he was limited to four, and said that his lack of knowledge of music on computers made it &quot;impossible&quot;. He wrote the soundtrack concurrently with the Dreams Come True album &quot;Million Kisses&quot;. After he finished the compositions, they were digitized using an Atari ST and the program Notator.

On October 19, 2011, over 20 years after the release, a three-disc compilation of music from &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; and &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; was released in Japan. The first disc features original tracks from both games, the second contains Nakamura&#x27;s demo recordings before they were programmed into the Genesis, and the third has songs by Dreams Come True and their associated Akon remixes.

===Packaging and release===
Game-package illustrator Akira Watanabe said that his goal was to make the characters &quot;colorful&quot;, using clear lines and gradation to &quot;finish them neatly&quot;. According to Watanabe, the developers asked him to create a package design &quot;similar to pop art ... without being particular to conventional packages&quot; – something &quot;original&quot; and &quot;stylish&quot;. &quot;Sonic&quot; was not revealed until the January 1991 international Consumer Electronics Show because Sega wanted to wait until the right time and because they saw an opportunity to &quot;steal the show&quot;. &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; was believed to be the most impressive game at the show and won the CES award for innovation.

Sega of America CEO Tom Kalinske wanted reassurance that the character would not fail. The global head of marketing, Al Nilsen, and the senior product manager, Madeleine Schroeder, became involved in redesigning Sonic for American audiences. Artist Greg Martin was commissioned to redesign the character, and a new backstory was created where Sonic was from Nebraska. Sega playtested &quot;Sonic&quot; across the United States with Mario fans: they were shown &quot;Mario&quot; and then played &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;. 80 percent preferred &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, and the game was shown at the 1991 summer Consumer Electronics Show. It arrived in the United Kingdom on June 21, 1991, widely released in North America on June 23, and in the PAL regions and Japan the following month. In November 1991, Sega of America included &quot;Sonic&quot; as a pack-in game with American Genesis consoles, replacing &quot;Altered Beast&quot;. This enabled Sega of America to sell 15 million Genesis units. Genesis owners who bought their consoles before the switch could request free copies of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; by mail. Sega of America created a marketing campaign, making Sonic its new mascot.

==Other versions and rereleases==
===8-bit version===
A version of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; was developed by Ancient and released in late 1991 for Sega&#x27;s 8-bit consoles, the Master System and Game Gear. Its plot and gameplay mechanics are similar to the 16-bit version, though some level themes and digital assets are different and Chaos Emeralds are scattered throughout levels rather than bonus stages. Gameplay as a whole is simplified; the level design is flatter and has a larger focus on exploration, with no vertical loops, and Sonic cannot re-collect his rings after being hit. The game has a different soundtrack composed by Yuzo Koshiro, which includes adaptations of music from the original version. It was the final game released for the Master System in North America. The Master System version was re-released for Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console service in North America and Europe in August 2008. The Game Gear version was re-released for the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console on June 13, 2013, and included as an unlockable game in &quot;Sonic Adventure DX: Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; for GameCube and Windows and &quot;Sonic Mega Collection Plus&quot; for PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Windows.

===&quot;Sonic the Hedgehog Genesis&quot;===
To mark the game&#x27;s fifteenth anniversary, a port for the Game Boy Advance, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog Genesis&quot;, was released on November 14, 2006, in the United States. While the port is mostly identical to the original, it includes several new features not seen in the original Genesis release, such as the ability to save game progress and the inclusion of the Spin Dash move. This version, unlike others, received poor reviews, with a Metacritic score of 33/100. The chief complaints concerned its poor conversion to the Game Boy Advance, resulting in a bad performance and poor implementation of the original music and gameplay.

As a response to the poor reception and claims that the system could not handle the original game, Simon &quot;Stealth&quot; Thomley, who later assisted with the development of the 2013 mobile port, released an unofficial, proof-of-concept version of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; for the system. The unofficial version contains a complete Green Hill Zone and two bonus stages, as well as Tails and Knuckles as playable characters.

===2013 remaster===
A remastered mobile port was released on iOS on May 15, 2013, with an Android version following the next day. This version was developed by Christian &quot;Taxman&quot; Whitehead and Simon Thomley of Headcannon from scratch using the Retro Engine, previously used in the 2011 remaster of &quot;Sonic CD&quot;. This port features several enhancements, such as widescreen graphics, the optional ability to Spin Dash, an additional bonus stage, a time attack mode and the unlockable option to play as Tails or Knuckles; it additionally features a heavily expanded debug mode, which allows for use of unused elements and elements from more recent games (such as the characters&#x27; super forms). The iOS version was updated in 2016, adding compatibility with Apple TV.

===&quot;3D Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;===
A Nintendo 3DS version, &quot;3D Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, was released as part of the 3D Classics line in 2013. This version, unlike most downloadable re-releases of the game, is not emulated; rather, the code was restructured to take advantage of the 3DS system&#x27;s stereoscopic 3D graphics and comes with additional enhancements, such as the option to use the Spin Dash move, a CRT-style filter, and the option to start from any level.

===Compilation releases===

With its sequels for the Genesis, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; has been ported for a wide range of home and handheld consoles and personal computers through compilations. The first collection it appeared in was &quot;Sonic Compilation&quot; (1995) for the Genesis. It has since appeared in &quot;Sonic Jam&quot; (1997) for the Saturn, &quot;Sonic Mega Collection&quot; (2002) for the GameCube, &quot;Sonic Mega Collection Plus&quot; (2004) for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, &quot;Sega Genesis Collection&quot; for the PlayStation 2 and PSP, &quot;Sonic&#x27;s Ultimate Genesis Collection&quot; (2009) for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, &quot;Sonic Classic Collection&quot; (2010) for the Nintendo DS, &quot;Oculus Arcade&quot; for the Oculus Rift, and &quot;Sega Genesis Classics&quot; (2018) for Microsoft Windows, the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch. The 2013 remaster was included in the 2022 compilation &quot;Sonic Origins&quot;. This remaster saw Amy Rose becoming a playable character in an upgraded version of &quot;Origins&quot;.

===Downloadable releases===
&quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; has been available for all three major seventh-generation video game consoles. It was part of the Wii Virtual Console at the service&#x27;s 2006 introduction, and was released for the Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network shortly afterwards. The game was released for the iPod Classic, iPod video, and video-capable iPod Nano models in 2007 and for Apple&#x27;s iOS in April 2009. &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; became available on GameTap in September 2009. In October 2010, it was released on Windows via Steam. The game was ported to Android and released in December 2012. Additionally, it is an unlockable reward in the console versions of &quot;Sonic Generations&quot;. The 2013 remaster was made available on the Sega Forever service on iOS and Android in June 2017. A port for Nintendo Switch was released on September 20, 2018 as part of the Sega Ages line of rereleases. It adds features including the ability to use moves from &quot;Sonic 2&quot; and &quot;Sonic Mania&quot;, a challenge mode, a time attack for the first stage, and features from the 3DS rereleases of the game and its sequel.

===Canceled versions===
U.S. Gold acquired the rights to make a version of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; for the Amiga, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and Atari ST personal computers, but these went unreleased. Several screenshots exist, some of which resemble the 8-bit version. An enhanced port for the Sega CD was also planned, but was canceled in favor of &quot;Sonic CD&quot;.

==Reception==
===Sales===
&quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; was a commercial success. It became America&#x27;s best-selling video game for several months in 1991, outselling &quot;Super Mario&quot;. By Christmas 1991, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; had sold nearly game cartridges in the United States. It was also Blockbuster Video&#x27;s highest-renting game of the year. In the United Kingdom, it was the top-selling Mega Drive game for two months following its release.

&quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; was the best-selling home video game of 1991, with copies sold worldwide by the end of the year, becoming Sega&#x27;s best-selling home video game up until then. In 1991, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; helped Sega generate a gross revenue of in console sales and capture a 65% share of the European console market. &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; set a Sega software sales record with cartridges sold by March 1992, including copies in the United States and another in Europe and Japan. The game went on to sell units by October 1992, and copies worldwide by November 1992. By 1997, the game had sold over copies worldwide, and earned over ( adjusted for inflation), higher than the typically grossed by a blockbuster movie at the time.

The original version bundled with the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive hardware had sold over 15 million copies . The mobile game version also had eight million paid downloads by 2008, 482,960 units were sold on Xbox Live Arcade , and 10 million paid Android downloads were sold as of 2017 bringing total sales to worldwide across all platforms.

===Contemporary reviews===
&quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; was praised by critics, with scores above 90% from most video game magazines at the time. It was considered Sega&#x27;s answer to Nintendo&#x27;s widely popular &quot;Mario&quot; series, as it was a platformer featuring the company&#x27;s mascot. In a preview following its CES debut in January 1991, John Cook of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; called it the most impressive game at the show and said it was &quot;another jumpy jumpy game in the Mario mould, but with an astonishing turn of speed and great music.&quot; Upon release, Paul Rand of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; compared the two in depth and characterized &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; as being faster, with brighter colors and &quot;Super Mario World&quot; as having more &quot;depth of play&quot;. Frank Ladoire of &quot;&quot; believed &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; was part of a new generation of games that demonstrate that the Mega Drive is capable of &quot;beautiful things&quot; in the technical department.

Reviewers praised the colorful, detailed graphics. Rand called its color scheme &quot;lively, but never garish&quot;, praising the interaction of color with detail in the sprites, backgrounds, and animations and describing its graphics as the best available for the Mega Drive. Reviewer Boogie Man of &quot;GamePro&quot; called the intricate backgrounds &quot;eye-popping&quot; and &quot;gorgeous&quot;, which was echoed by &quot;Mean Machines&quot;. The Lessers (Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk) of &quot;Dragon&quot; claimed the graphics made &quot;Sonic&quot; a possible contender for the best game of 1991 and &quot;GameZone&quot; called the animation &quot;some of the smoothest and fastest ... ever seen&quot;. Julian Boardman of &quot;Raze&quot; praised the &quot;colourful and highly detailed&quot; backdrops and &quot;fabulous&quot; sprites. The music and sound effects were also well received; &quot;Dragon&quot; called them &quot;great&quot;, and &quot;GameZone&quot; &quot;amazing&quot;. Rand praised the &quot;catchy&quot; soundtrack, calling some of the sound effects &quot;absolutely brilliant&quot;. Although &quot;Mean Machines&quot; called the songs &quot;vaguely appealing&quot;, the sound effects were better appreciated. However, Boardman of &quot;Raze&quot; considered the music &quot;a little boring&quot;.

Critics cited the fast gameplay, unprecedented in platformers. The difficulty was disputed, described as &quot;impossible&quot; by Rand and &quot;average&quot; by &quot;EGM&quot;. Rand said about the gameplay in general that it &quot;plays like a dream&quot;; according to &quot;GameZone&quot; it would enchant players for hours, and Boogie Man praised Sonic Team&#x27;s ability to provide an engaging experience primarily from running and jumping. Although &quot;EGM&quot;, &quot;Dragon&quot;, Paul of &quot;Mean Machines&quot; and Boardman of &quot;Raze&quot; praised the level design (especially the hidden rooms), Paul found losing all of one&#x27;s rings frustrating.

Bob Strauss of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the game an A+ and wrote that it was a very fast game, yet never felt chaotic or impossible, and they later named it the best game available in 1991.

===Awards===
At the 1991 Golden Joystick Awards, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; won Overall Game of the Year. In the 1991 &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; awards, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; won Game of the Year. At the European Computer Trade Show (ECTS) awards, it won the awards for Best Video Game and Going Live Viewers Award. In 1992, &quot;Mega&quot; ranked &quot;Sonic&quot; as their third-favorite Genesis game. In 1995, &quot;Flux&quot; rated the game fourth in its &quot;Top 100 Video Games.&quot; In 1996, &quot;GamesMaster&quot; ranked the game 78th on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time.&quot; In 2016, The Strong National Museum of Play inducted &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; to its World Video Game Hall of Fame.

===Retrospective reviews===
Retrospective reception has been positive, with an 86% rating at the review aggregator GameRankings based on nine reviews published online in the 2000s. &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; has maintained its popularity, and has since been considered one of the greatest video games of all time.

Frank Provo of &quot;GameSpot&quot; described the game as &quot;one of the best platformers of all time&quot;, finding that despite technical issues in the Game Boy Advance port &quot;after all these years, the underlying graphics, audio, and gameplay still hold up&quot;. Lucas M. Thomas of &quot;IGN&quot; agreed that it stood the test of time. Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Keith Stuart observed that &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;″s emphasis on speed and pinball mechanics dramatically departs from generally accepted precepts of game design, requiring that players &quot;learn through repetition rather than observation&quot; as &quot;the levels aren&#x27;t designed to be seen or even understood in one playthrough.&quot; However, Stuart concluded that &quot;sometimes in &quot;Sonic&quot;, when you get better, or through sheer luck, things take off, every jump is right, every loop-the-loop is perfect, and you&#x27;re in the flow, sailing above the game&#x27;s strange structure ... &quot;Sonic&quot; is incorrect game design and yet ... it&#x27;s a masterpiece.&quot;

==Legacy==
Primarily because of its Genesis bundling, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; was a factor in popularising the console in North America, thus solidifying it as a competitor to Nintendo and their Super Nintendo Entertainment System. During October–December 1991, with the game&#x27;s success, the Genesis outsold the SNES by two to one; at its January 1992 peak it gained a foothold in the industry and had 65 percent of the market for 16-bit consoles. Although Nintendo eventually overtook Sega, it was the first time since December 1985 that Nintendo did not lead the console market.

&quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; inspired similar platformers starring animal mascots, including &quot;Bubsy&quot;, &quot;Aero the Acro-Bat&quot;, &quot;James Pond 3&quot;, &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot;, &quot;Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel&quot;, and &quot;Radical Rex&quot;. &quot;Animal with attitude&quot; games carried over to the next generation of consoles, with the developers of &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; and &quot;Gex&quot; citing &quot;Sonic&quot; as a major inspiration.

&quot;Sonic&quot;&#x27;s success led to an extensive media franchise, with the first of many sequels, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2,&quot; released the following year. It has generated dozens of additional games and a large cast of recurring characters, keeping Sonic and Robotnik (later renamed as Eggman) mainstays, and continued beyond Sega&#x27;s exit from the console industry after the Dreamcast. The series has ventured from platformers to fighting, racing, role-playing, and sports games, and also expanded into anime, manga, cartoons comic books, novels, and toys. &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; is one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time, with over 140 million copies sold or downloaded worldwide across consoles, PC&#x27;s, mobile phones and tablets by May 2014. The game&#x27;s first level, Green Hill Zone, has been featured in later games such as &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot;, &quot;Sonic Generations&quot;, &quot;Sonic Mania&quot;, &quot;Sonic Forces&quot;, and the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series.

The game inspired a number of unofficial variants, including &quot;Somari&quot;, a pirated Nintendo Entertainment System conversion featuring Nintendo&#x27;s Mario character in levels from the original &quot;Sonic&quot; game, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog Megamix&quot;, a total conversion mod of the original game, and &quot;Sonic 1 Boomed&quot;, a ROM hack which implements Sonic&#x27;s redesign from the &quot;Sonic Boom&quot; animated series.

<doc id="300264" wikidata="Q4329264" url="?curid=300264" title="Heritage language">
<text>A heritage language is a minority language (either immigrant or indigenous) learned by its speakers at home as children, and difficult to be fully developed because of insufficient input from the social environment. The speakers grow up with a different dominant language in which they become more competent. Polinsky and Kagan label it as a continuum (taken from Valdés definition of heritage language) that ranges from fluent speakers to barely speaking individuals of the home language. In some countries or cultures which determine a person&#x27;s mother tongue by the ethnic group they belong to, a heritage language would be linked to the native language.

The term can also refer to the language of a person&#x27;s family or community that the person does not speak or understand, but identifies with culturally.

==Definitions and use==
Heritage language is a language which is predominantly spoken by &quot;nonsocietal&quot; groups and linguistic minorities.

In various fields, such as foreign language education and linguistics, the definitions of &quot;heritage language&quot; become more specific and divergent. In foreign language education, heritage language is defined in terms of a student&#x27;s upbringing and functional proficiency in the language: a student raised in a home where a non-majority language is spoken is a heritage speaker of that language if they possess some proficiency in it. Under this definition, individuals that have some cultural connection with the language but do not speak it are not considered heritage students. This restricted definition became popular in the mid 1990s with the publication of &quot;Standards for Foreign Language Learning&quot; by the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages.

Among linguists, heritage language is an end-state language that is defined based on the temporal order of acquisition and, often, the language dominance in the individual. A heritage speaker acquires the heritage language as their first language through natural input in the home environment and acquires the majority language as a second language, usually when they start school and talk about different topics with people in school, or by exposure through the media (such as written texts, the Internet, or popular culture). As exposure to the heritage language decreases and exposure to the majority language increases, the majority language becomes the individual’s dominant language and acquisition of the heritage language changes. The results of these changes can be seen in divergence of the heritage language from monolingual norms in the areas of phonology, lexical knowledge (knowledge of vocabulary or words), morphology, syntax, semantics and code-switching, although mastery of the heritage language may vary from purely receptive skills in only informal spoken language to native-like fluency.

===Controversy in definition===
As stated by Polinsky and Kagan: &quot;The definition of a heritage speaker in general and for specific languages continues to be debated. The debate is of particular significance in such languages as Tamil, Chinese, Arabic, and languages of India and the Philippines, where speakers of multiple languages or dialects are seen as heritage speakers of a single standard language taught for geographic, cultural or other reasons (Mandarin Chinese, Modern Standard Arabic, Hindi, or Tagalog, respectively).&quot;

One idea that prevails in the literature is that &quot;[heritage] languages include indigenous languages that are often endangered. . . as well as world languages that are commonly spoken in many other regions of the world (Spanish in the United States, Arabic in France)&quot;. However, that view is not shared universally. In Canada, for example, First Nations languages are not classified as heritage languages by some groups whereas they are so classified by others.

The label &quot;heritage&quot; is given to a language based principally on the social status of its speakers and not necessarily on any linguistic property. Thus, while Spanish typically comes in second in terms of native speakers worldwide and has official status in a number of countries, it is considered a heritage language in the English-dominant United States and Canada. Outside the United States and Canada, heritage language definitions and use vary.

Speakers of the same heritage language raised in the same community may differ significantly in terms of their language abilities, yet be considered heritage speakers under this definition. Some heritage speakers may be highly proficient in the language, possessing several registers, while other heritage speakers may be able to understand the language but not produce it. Other individuals that simply have a cultural connection with a minority language but do not speak it may consider it to be their heritage language. It is held by some that ownership does not necessarily depend on usership: &quot;Some Aboriginal people distinguish between usership and ownership. There are even those who claim that they own a language although they only know one single word of it: its name.&quot;

== Proficiency ==
Heritage learners have a fluent command of the dominant language and are comfortable using it in formal setting because of their exposure to the language through formal education. Their command of the heritage language, however, varies widely. Some heritage learners may lose some fluency in the first language after they begin formal education in the dominant language. Others may use the heritage language consistently at home and with family but receive little or no formal training in the heritage language and thus may struggle with literacy skills or with using it in broader settings outside of the home. An additional factor that affects the acquisition of learners is whether they show willingness or reluctance towards learning the heritage language.

One factor that has been shown to influence the loss of fluency in the heritage language is age. Studies have shown that younger bilingual children are more susceptible to fluency loss than older bilingual children. The older the child is when the dominant language is introduced, the less likely they are to lose proficiency in their first language (the heritage language). This is because the older the child is, the more exposure and knowledge of use the child will have had with the heritage language, and thus the heritage language will remain as their primary language.

Researchers found that this phenomenon primarily deals with the memory network of an individual. Once a memory network is organized, it is difficult for the brain to reorganize information contrary to the initial information, because the previous information was processed first. This phenomenon becomes a struggle for adults who are trying to learn a different language. Once an individual has learned a language fluently, they will be heavily influenced by the grammatical rules and pronunciations of the first language they learned, while learning a new language.

An emerging effective way of measuring the proficiency of a heritage speaker is by speech rate. A study of gender restructuring in heritage Russian showed that heritage speakers fell into two groups: those who maintained the three-gender system and those who radically reanalyzed the system as a two-gender system. The heritage speakers who reanalyzed the three-gender system as a two-gender system had a strong correlation with a slower speech rate. The correlation is straightforward—lower proficiency speakers have more difficulty accessing lexical items; therefore, their speech is slowed down.

Although speech rate has been shown to be an effective way of measuring proficiency of heritage speakers, some heritage speakers are reluctant to produce any heritage language whatsoever. Lexical proficiency is an alternative method that is also effective in measuring proficiency. In a study with heritage Russian speakers, there was a strong correlation between the speaker&#x27;s knowledge of lexical items (measured using a basic word list of about 200) and the speaker&#x27;s control over grammatical knowledge such as agreement, temporal marking, and embedding.

Some heritage speakers explicitly study the language to gain additional proficiency. The learning trajectories of heritage speakers are markedly different from the trajectories of second language learners with little or no previous exposure to a target language. For instance, heritage learners typically show a phonological advantage over second language learners in both perception and production of the heritage language, even when their exposure to the heritage language was interrupted very early in life. Heritage speakers also tend to distinguish, rather than conflate, easily confusable sounds in the heritage language and the dominant language more reliably than second language learners. In morphosyntax as well, heritage speakers have been found to be more native-like than second language learners, although they are typically significantly different from native speakers.
Many linguists frame this change in heritage language acquisition as &quot;incomplete acquisition&quot; or &quot;attrition.&quot; &quot;Incomplete acquisition,&quot; loosely defined by Montrul, is &quot;the outcome of language acquisition that is not complete in childhood.&quot; In this incomplete acquisition, there are particular properties of the language that were not able to reach age-appropriate levels of proficiency after the dominant language has been introduced. Attrition, as defined by Montrul, is the loss of a certain property of a language after one has already mastered it with native-speaker level accuracy. These two cases of language loss have been used by Montrul and many other linguists to describe the change in heritage language acquisition. However, this is not the only viewpoint of linguists to describe heritage language acquisition.

One argument against incomplete acquisition is that the input that heritage speakers receive is different from monolinguals (the input may be affected by cross-generational attrition, among other factors), thus the comparison of heritage speakers against monolinguals is weak. This argument by Pascual and Rothman claims that the acquisition of the heritage language is therefore not incomplete, but complete and simply different from monolingual acquisition of a language. Another argument argues for a shift in focus on the result of incomplete acquisition of a heritage language to the process of heritage language acquisition. In this argument, the crucial factor in changes to heritage language acquisition is the extent to which the heritage speaker activates and processes the heritage language. This new model thus moves away from language acquisition that is dependent on the exposure to input of the language and moves towards dependence on the frequency of processing for production and comprehension of the heritage language.

Some colleges and universities offer courses prepared for speakers of heritage languages. For example, students who grow up learning some Spanish in the home may enroll in a course that will build on their Spanish abilities.

<text>John Bowden Connally Jr. (February 27, 1917June 15, 1993) was an American politician who served as the 39th governor of Texas from 1963 to 1969 and as the 61st United States secretary of the Treasury from 1971 to 1972. He began his career as a Democrat and later became a Republican in 1973.

Connally was born in Floresville, Texas in 1917 and pursued a legal career after graduating from the University of Texas at Austin. During World War II, he served on the staff of James Forrestal and Dwight D. Eisenhower before transferring to the Asiatic-Pacific Theater. After the war, he became an aide to Senator Lyndon B. Johnson. When Johnson assumed the vice presidency in 1961, he convinced President John F. Kennedy to appoint Connally to the position of United States Secretary of the Navy. Connally left the Kennedy Administration in December 1961 to successfully run for Governor of Texas. In 1963, Connally was riding in the presidential limousine when Kennedy was assassinated, and was seriously wounded. During his governorship, he was a conservative Democrat.

In 1971, Republican President Richard Nixon appointed Connally as his treasury secretary. In this position, Connally presided over the removal of the United States dollar from the gold standard, an event known as the Nixon shock. Connally stepped down from the Cabinet in 1972 to lead the Democrats for Nixon organization, which campaigned for Nixon&#x27;s re-election. Connally was on Nixon&#x27;s short list to replace Vice President Spiro Agnew after the latter resigned in 1973, but Gerald Ford was chosen instead. Connally sought the Republican nomination for president in the 1980 election, but withdrew from the race after the first set of primaries. Connally did not seek public office again after 1980 and died of pulmonary fibrosis in 1993.

==Early life and education==
Connally was born on February 27, 1917, into a large family in Floresville, the seat of Wilson County, southeast of San Antonio. He was one of seven children born to Lela (née Wright) and John Bowden Connally, a dairy and tenant farmer. His six siblings included four brothers: Golfrey, Merrill, Wayne and Stanford, and sisters Carmen and Blanche. According to Ronnie Dugger, Connally&#x27;s family had &quot;had no money, no home, and no furniture.&quot; Connally&#x27;s parents grew even poorer because of the Great Depression, and when speaking about his poverty, Connally often recalled that he had to study by kerosene light.

Despite the initial hardship, John Bowden Connally was able to lift the family out of poverty by running a successful bus route, and by 1932 the family bought a 1000-acre farm. The income from the farm was enough to cover Connally&#x27;s tuition. Connally attended Floresville High School and was one of the few graduates who attended college. He graduated from the University of Texas at Austin, where he was the student body president and a member of the Friar Society. It was at the University of Texas where he met his future wife Nellie Connally. He subsequently graduated from the University of Texas School of Law and was admitted to the bar by examination.

In 1936, Connally met and befriended Lyndon Johnson, of whom he remained a political ally and friend for his entire life. Johnson helped Connally get a job in the campus library, and Connally played a minor role in Johnson&#x27;s bid for Congress in 1937. Johnson rewarded Connally for his help by taking him to Washington in 1939, where Connally remained until 1941, when he joined the Naval Reserve.

==Military service and legal career==
Connally served in the United States Navy, starting on June 11, 1941 as an ensign during World War II, first as an aide to James V. Forrestal. Subsequently, he was on General Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s staff for planning the North African campaign. After transferring to the South Pacific Theater, he served as fighter-plane director aboard the aircraft carrier USS &quot;Essex&quot; and was awarded the Bronze Star for bravery. After being transferred to the USS &quot;Bennington&quot;, he was awarded the Legion of Merit. He was discharged in January 1946 at the rank of lieutenant commander.

Connally practiced law in the Alvin Wirtz law firm, until Lyndon Baines Johnson, then a newly elected senator, persuaded him to return to Washington, to serve as a key aide. He had close ties with Johnson before his navy days and maintained them until the former president&#x27;s death in 1973.

Two of Connally&#x27;s principal legal clients were the Texas oil tycoon Sid W. Richardson and Perry Bass, Richardson&#x27;s nephew and partner, both of Fort Worth. Richardson&#x27;s empire in the 1950s was estimated at $200 million to $1 billion. Under Richardson&#x27;s tutelage, Connally gained experience in a variety of enterprises and received tips on real estate purchases. The work required the Connallys to relocate to Fort Worth. When Richardson died in 1959, Connally was named to the lucrative position of co-executor of the estate.

Connally was also involved in a reported clandestine deal to place the Texas Democrat Robert Anderson on the 1956 Republican ticket as vice president. Although the idea fell through when Dwight Eisenhower retained Richard Nixon in the second slot, Anderson received a million dollars for his efforts and a subsequent appointment as U.S. Treasury Secretary.

==From Navy secretary to Texas politics==
Following the end of World War II, Connally worked in Johnson&#x27;s radio station KTBC in Austin, Texas, before borrowing $25,000 in 1946 to found a new radio station KVET. He was the president of the radio station between 1946 and 1949. Connally became a chief strategist for Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s 1948 Senate race, and is reported to have said: &quot;I really ran the campaign that year.&quot; Connally almost ended up running for office instead of Johnson because of the latter&#x27;s reluctance, but Johnson eventually did settle on partaking in the election.

At the 1960 Democratic convention in Los Angeles, Connally led supporters of Senator Lyndon Johnson. His argument that John F. Kennedy would be an unsuitable president due to having Addison&#x27;s disease and a dependence on cortisone was fruitless, as Kennedy had already secured the needed delegates for nomination before the convention even opened. Kennedy made Johnson his running mate in order to secure the support of Southern Democrats, and went on to win the 1960 presidential election.

===Secretary of the Navy===
At Johnson&#x27;s request, in 1961 President Kennedy named Connally Secretary of the Navy. Connally resigned eleven months later to run for the Texas governorship. During Connally&#x27;s secretaryship, the Navy had a budget of $14 billion and more than 1.2 million workers–600,000 in uniform and 650,000 civilian–stationed at 222 bases in the United States and 53 abroad.

Connally directed the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea on a new kind of &quot;gunboat diplomacy.&quot; The landed in Naples, Italy, and brought gifts to children in an orphanage. Connally also ordered gifts for a hospital in Cannes, France, that treated children with bone diseases, for poor Greek children on the island of Rhodes and for disabled children in Palermo, Italy. Presents were also sent to Turkish children in Cyprus and to a camp in Beirut for homeless Palestinian refugees. The Bay of Pigs incident occurred under his watch.

Connally fought hard to protect the Navy&#x27;s role in the national space program, having vigorously opposed assigning most space research to the Air Force. &quot;Time&quot; termed Connally&#x27;s year as Navy Secretary &quot;a first-rate appointment.&quot; Critics noted, however, that the brevity of Connally&#x27;s tenure precluded any sustained or comprehensive achievements.

===Running for governor===
Connally announced in December 1961 that he was leaving the position of Secretary of the Navy to seek the Democratic nomination for the 1962 Texas gubernatorial election. He would have to compete against the incumbent Marion Price Daniel Sr., who was running for a fourth consecutive two-year term. Daniel was in political trouble following the enactment of a two-cent state sales tax in 1961, which had soured many voters on his administration. Another opponent, Don Yarborough, was a liberal attorney from Houston favored by organized labor. Former state Attorney General Will Wilson also entered the campaign, criticizing Johnson, who he claimed had engineered Connally&#x27;s candidacy.

Connally ran as a conservative Democrat. Connally waged the most active campaign of any of the Democrats, traveling more than 22,000 miles across the state. He made 43 major speeches and appeared on multiple statewide and local telecasts. Biographer Charles Ashman called Connally a &quot;total professional&quot; when it came to campaigning. During the campaign, Connally courted crowds and travelled with aides to make for a more noticeable entrance when he arrived at events. Ashman claimed that Connally would have aides telephone airports ask to page him for an urgent message, in order to give the impression that he was much in demand.

According to a 1961 poll, only 1% of Texas voters were willing to back Connally, which forced him to make ground rapidly. Connally appeared conservative, but did often highlight his position in the Kennedy Administration in attempt to appeal to Hispanic and Afro-American voters. Connally refused to debate Yarborough, and resorted to attacking him in subtle ways instead, attacking him as a candidate of Americans for Democratic Action, which &quot;was like equating him with the Communist party&quot; in a Southern state like Texas.

Eventually he was placed in a primary runoff election against Yarborough, which he won by a close vote. Connally&#x27;s Republican opponent for the governor&#x27;s office was conservative Republican Jack Cox, also of Houston. Connally received 847,038 ballots (54%) to Cox&#x27;s 715,025 (45.6%). In the campaign, Connally made an issue of Cox having switched to the Republican party the previous year; eleven years later, Connally made the same switch.

==Governor of Texas==

Connally served as governor from 1963 until 1969. In the campaigns of 1964 and 1966, Connally defeated weak Republican challenges offered by Jack Crichton, a Dallas oil industrialist, and Thomas Everton Kennerly Sr. (1903–2000), of Houston, respectively. He prevailed with margins of 73.8 percent and 72.8 percent, respectively, giving him greater influence with the nearly all-Democratic legislature.

Connally was governor during a time of great expansion of higher education in Texas. He signed into law the creation of the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. He appointed regents who backed the entry of women into previously all-male Texas A&amp;M University in College Station, having been prompted to take such action by State Senator William T. &quot;Bill&quot; Moore of Bryan, who in 1953 had first proposed the admission of women to the institution.

Following the Assassination of John F. Kennedy, Connally &quot;became almost a demigod symbol to the voters in Texas which would assure him an overwhelming victory in 1964&quot;. The governor became very religious and believed that he had been saved by God for a reason. He wrote: &quot;Now I feel that, rather than being elected, maybe I&#x27;m one of God&#x27;s elect. The good Lord chose to leave me here, so I figure I&#x27;m one of God&#x27;s elect.&quot;

Following his re-election in 1964, Connally grew critical of Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s Great Society and was willing to block its enaction in Texas. Connally was also a bitter opponent of trade unions and strongly supported right-to-work law in Texas, which led the AFL-CIO to call for his resignation. Texas Republicans strongly commended Connally for his conservative views, and a Houston Republican Albert B. Fay said that he wanted &quot;to publicly commend him [Connally] and invite him into the Republican party.&quot;

Connally cemented himself as a very conservative Democrat, even by the standards of the Solid South, which led many to believe that he was aligned more towards the Republican Party than his own. During the presidency of Johnson, Connally &quot;spoke out for state vetoes on anti-poverty programs, publicly went on television to oppose the civil rights laws guaranteeing all citizens access to public accommodations, and other Great Society legislation.&quot; The liberal wing of the Democratic Party in Texas believed that a break between Connally and the president was imminent, given Connally&#x27;s support for racial segregation and his opposition to Johnson&#x27;s welfare policies. The split did not come to fruition and according to The New Republic, Johnson and Connally &quot;agree to disagree&quot;.

Despite clashing with Johnson on the issue of segregation and economic policies, Connally agreed with president&#x27;s foreign policy, supported escalating the Vietnam War, and kept supporting Johnson even after the Vietnam War grew deeply unpopular. Connally fiercely defended the war, and accused Democratic progressives such as Eugene McCarthy and George McGovern of supporting &quot;appeasement and surrender&quot;; in turn, Pierre Salinger accused Connally of endorsing &quot;old-type Joe McCarthyism&quot;. Eugene Nickerson remarked that Connally&#x27;s view on the Vietnam War was &quot;blood thirsty&quot; and that he expressed support &quot;for bigger and better wars&quot;. Connally remained a hardline hawk his entire life, and consistently pressured President Johnson to stay aggressive towards Vietnam.

As governor of Texas, Connally also had a strained relationship with Afro-Americans and Latin Americans, and was reported to have &quot;snubbed a group of Latin Americans in 1966 who walked 350 miles to ask him to support a state minimum wage&quot;. This earned Connally a reputation of a reactionary, deeply conservative, and insensitive politician. In 1966, Connally defended his views by saying: &quot;In a sense it is a dirty business, but not corrupt. It&#x27;s mean... It&#x27;s tough... [People] will say some mean things about you, but this is one of the burdens you have to bear. People say mean things about me-and they will this year&quot;.

Connally founded and thoroughly consolidated his political machine in Texas during his governorship, and said: &quot;Texas is a one-party state, and I&#x27;ll see to it that it stays that way.&quot; According to Robert Sherrill, Connally moved the state in a conservative direction, and &quot;controlled the men who controlled the politics in Texas—all conservative&quot;. This allowed the governor to successfully prevent the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 from being enforced in the state.

By Spring of 1967, Connally announced that he would not seek a fourth term because of his failing health: he suffered from stomach ulcer. Reevaluating the governorship of John Connally, Rita Lynne Colbert concludes:
As governor, Connally promoted HemisFair &#x27;68, the world&#x27;s fair held in San Antonio, which he suggested could net the state an additional $12 million in direct taxes. He also supported turning the fair&#x27;s Texas Pavilion into a permanent museum, the Institute of Texan Cultures, describing his vision for it as &quot;a dramatic showcase, not only to Texans, but to all the world, of the host of diverse peoples from many lands whose blood and dreams built our state.&quot;

There was some talk of Connally being selected as Hubert Humphrey&#x27;s running mate on the Democratic ticket in 1968, but liberal Senator Edmund Muskie of Maine was chosen instead. Connally publicly endorsed Humphrey, but the relationship was not always smooth. According to then-Representative Ben Barnes, in a private meeting at the 1968 Democratic National Convention, Connally angrily accused Humphrey of being disloyal to President Johnson by trying to soft-pedal Johnson&#x27;s position regarding Vietnam. Ashman claims that during this time Connally was &quot;privately helping Nixon, recruiting a number of influential Texans, members of both parties, to work for the Republican candidate.&quot;

Connally was succeeded as governor by Lieutenant Governor Preston Smith.

===Kennedy assassination===
On November 22, 1963, Connally was seriously wounded while riding in President Kennedy&#x27;s car at Dealey Plaza in Dallas when the president was assassinated. Connally, riding in the middle jump seat of the president&#x27;s limousine in front of the president, recalled hearing the first shot, which he immediately recognized as a rifle shot. He said that he immediately feared an assassination attempt and turned to his right to look back to see the president. He looked over his right shoulder but did not catch the president out of the corner of his eye, so he said he began to turn back to look to his left, when he felt a forceful impact to his back. It is likely that, had his head not turned, the bullet which struck his back would have hit his heart instead of his lungs, instantly killing him.

He later told the Warren Commission: &quot;I said, &#x27;My God, they are going to kill us all. He looked down and saw that his chest was covered with blood and thought he had been fatally shot. Then he heard the third and final shot, which sprayed blood and brain tissue on the car&#x27;s passengers. Connally suffered a fracture of the fifth rib, a punctured lung, a shattered wrist, and had a bullet lodged in his leg. He underwent four hours of surgery after the shooting and recovered from his wounds.

Doctor Charles Gregory, who tended to his wrist wound also told the Warren Commission that it went from the upper (dorsal) surface, near the midline, about five cm above the wrist joint, to the under (volar) surface, much closer to the joint, at a distance of about one and a half cm. The 10-month investigation by the Warren Commission of 1963–1964 concluded that President Kennedy was assassinated by 24-year-old ex-Marine Lee Harvey Oswald and that Oswald had acted entirely alone. Connally refused to accept the single-bullet theory, which suggested that one shot passed through President Kennedy&#x27;s neck and caused all of Connally&#x27;s wounds. He insisted that all three shots struck occupants of the limousine. Publicly, he agreed with the Warren Commission&#x27;s conclusion that Oswald acted alone.

==Secretary of the Treasury==

In 1971, Republican President Nixon appointed Democrat Connally as Treasury Secretary. Before agreeing to take the appointment, however, Connally told Nixon that the president must find a position in the administration for George H. W. Bush, the Republican who had been defeated in November 1970 in a hard-fought U.S. Senate race against Democrat Lloyd Bentsen. Connally told Nixon that his taking the Treasury post would embarrass Bush, who had &quot;labored in the vineyards&quot; for Nixon&#x27;s election as president, while Connally had supported Humphrey.

Nixon named Bush as ambassador to the United Nations in order to secure Connally&#x27;s services at Treasury. Ben Barnes, then the lieutenant governor and originally a Connally ally, claims in his autobiography that Connally&#x27;s insistence saved Bush&#x27;s political career, leading to Bush&#x27;s eventual presidency and indirectly to the presidency of his son, George W. Bush.

Shortly after taking the Treasury post, Connally famously told a group of European finance ministers worried about the export of American inflation that the dollar &quot;is our currency, but your problem.&quot;
Secretary Connally defended a $50 billion increase in the debt ceiling and a $35 to $40 billion budget deficit as an essential &quot;fiscal stimulus&quot; at a time when five million Americans were unemployed. He unveiled Nixon&#x27;s program of raising the price of gold and formally devaluing the dollar, known as the Nixon shock—finally leaving the old gold standard entirely, a departure begun in 1934 by Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Prices continued to increase during 1971, and Nixon allowed wage and price guidelines, which Congress had authorized on a stand-by basis, to be implemented. Connally later shied away from his role in recommending the failed wage and price controls, and announced guaranteed loans for the ailing Lockheed aircraft company. He also fought a lonely battle against growing balance-of-payment problems with the nation&#x27;s trading partners, and undertook important foreign diplomatic trips for Nixon through his role as Treasury Secretary.

Historian Bruce Schulman wrote that Nixon was &quot;awed&quot; by the handsome, urbane Texan who was also a tough political fighter. Schulman added that Henry Kissinger, Nixon&#x27;s National Security Advisor, noted that Connally was the only cabinet member whom Nixon did not disparage behind his back, and that this was high praise indeed.

==Democrats for Nixon and party switch==
Connally stepped down as Treasury Secretary in May 1972 to head &quot;Democrats for Nixon&quot;, a Republican-funded campaign to promote Democratic support for Nixon in the 1972 presidential election. Connally&#x27;s former mentor, Lyndon B. Johnson, stood behind Democratic presidential nominee George McGovern of South Dakota, although McGovern had long opposed Johnson&#x27;s foreign and defense policies. It was the first time that Connally and Johnson were publicly on opposite sides of a general election campaign, although Connally had privately supported the Republican candidate Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956.

In the 1972 U.S. Senate election in Texas, Connally endorsed Democrat Harold Barefoot Sanders, later a federal judge from Dallas, rather than the Republican incumbent John Tower, also of Dallas. Connally had considered running against Tower in 1966, but chose instead to run for a third term as governor.

After stepping down as Treasury Secretary, Connally served as the top adviser to Nixon&#x27;s energy policy. In December 1972, Connally travelled to Saudi Arabia with Occidental Petroleum chairman Armand Hammer. Addressing speculation that he was on a &quot;secret peace mission&quot;, Nixon said that Connally was travelling privately but that he had asked him to have informal discussions with various world leaders. On that trip Connally did meet with King Faisal and Prince Fahd where the Arab–Israeli conflict and its effect on Saudi Arabia–United States relations were discussed.

In January 1973, Johnson died of heart disease. He and Connally had been friends since 1938. Connally eulogized Johnson during interment services at the LBJ Ranch in Gillespie County, along with the Rev. Billy Graham, who officiated at the service.

In May 1973, Connally joined the Republican Party. When Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned five months later because of scandal, Connally was among Nixon&#x27;s potential choices to fill the vacancy. However, Nixon instead tapped House Minority Leader Gerald Ford, because he believed Democrats in Congress were less likely to block Ford&#x27;s appointment. Prominent Texas Democrat Bob Bullock, who had supported McGovern in 1972, disapproved strongly and publicly of Connally&#x27;s switch, stating that &quot;...I got some ideas on Mr. Connally. He ain&#x27;t never done nothin&#x27; but get shot in Dallas.&quot;

After William P. Rogers resigned as Secretary of State in September 1973, Nixon was reported to have considered appointing Connally to the position.

Nixon admired Connally; to the point that he wished for him to be his successor, while the two of them discussed the idea of setting up (as noted by one historian) “a new, distinctly Whiggish party, which the president wanted to call the “Independent Conservative Party.”” 

==Indictment, trial and acquittal==
In July 1974, Connally was indicted for allegedly pocketing $10,000 from dairy industry lawyer Jake Jacobsen in exchange for influencing the government to increase federal dairy price support. Further charges included Connally allegedly pocketing another $5,000 from Jacobsen after making a call to Thruston Morton, who was charging Jacobsen with fraud after a business venture of his had fallen through. At his April 1975 trial, Connally&#x27;s defense called as character witnesses former First Ladies Jacqueline Kennedy and Lady Bird Johnson, as well as Texas state senator Barbara Jordan (the first female, black state senator in Texas history), Dean Rusk, Robert McNamara and Billy Graham.

According to a November 1979 profile by Paul Burka in &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; magazine, &quot;The case turned first on whether Connally would simultaneously be tried for perjury—some embarrassing inconsistencies had crept into his pretrial testimony—but his lawyer was able to prevent it, and then the issue came down to whether John Connally or Jake Jacobsen was telling the truth.&quot; On the strength of the defense&#x27;s prominent character witnesses, Connally was acquitted.

==1980 presidential run==

Connally announced in January 1979 that he would seek the Republican nomination for president in 1980. He was considered a great orator and strong leader and was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; with the heading &quot;Hot on the Trail&quot;, but his wheeler-dealer image remained a liability, particularly in New England, an ancestrally Republican area. Connally drew the backing of Republican state representative Fred Agnich of Dallas. Connally raised more money than any other candidate, but he was never able to overtake the popular conservative front-runner, Ronald Reagan of California, which frustrated Connally deeply. Connally spent his money nationally, while rival candidate George H. W. Bush, also from Houston, targeted his time and money in early states and won the Iowa caucus. This was also due to his campaign manager, Eddie Mahe Jr, believing that his time was better spent in Southern states, where Connally was already a strong competitor.

Connally&#x27;s views on foreign policy in the Middle East led to the New York Times calling him the &quot;favored Saudi candidate&quot;. Most controversially, he gave a speech in front of the National Press Club where he called firmly for a two state solution in the Middle East where Palestine would become a region of Jordan, in exchange for recognition of Israel by nations of the Middle East and a firm flow of oil. The speech was blamed for many of the following failures of the Connally campaign, including a fall in the polls.

Following his loss in Iowa, Connally focused on South Carolina, an early primary state in which he had the support of U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond. He lost there to Reagan 55 to 30 percent and withdrew from the contest. Despite spending $11 million during the campaign, Connally secured the support of only a single delegate, Ada Mills of Clarksville, Arkansas, who became nationally known for a brief time as the &quot;$11 million delegate&quot;.

After withdrawing, Connally endorsed Reagan and appeared with the former governor at the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, fundraisers and other campaign events. During a press conference, Connally was asked if he thought Reagan was the best man to be president. Connally joked, &quot;I think he&#x27;s the second best man I can think of.&quot;

Connally was reported to have been interested in becoming Secretary of State or Secretary of Defense in the Reagan Administration, but was only offered the post of Secretary of Energy, which he turned down. Governor of Texas Bill Clements said that Connally rejected the position for personal reasons and to focus on his law practice with Vinson &amp; Elkins. He purchased a $1 million apartment in Washington, D.C., from one of the Shah&#x27;s sisters, reportedly due to higher political aspirations. He was assigned as one of the President&#x27;s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board&#x27;s 19 members.

=== Iran hostage allegations ===
In 2023, allegations by Ben Barnes, a longtime Connally associate, were published in the New York Times alleging that Connally interfered with Iran hostage crisis negotiations to aid the Reagan campaign and gain favor with Reagan. Barnes contended that during a tour of the Middle East in the summer of 1980, Connally met with several regional leaders to convince them to tell Iran that they would get a better deal from Reagan if they continued to hold hostages until after the November election.

While this trip has been verified and Connally was in touch with Reagan associates, it is unclear if he was acting at anyone&#x27;s direction, or if his message reached Iran or had any impact there.

==Later years==
In 1981, Connally was alleged to be aware of Operation Red Dog, a plot by white supremacists to overthrow the government of Dominica, by Michael Perdue. Connally, along with Ron Paul, was found to have no connection to the plot and was not subpoenaed as part of the trial.

In 1986, Connally filed for bankruptcy as a result of a string of business losses in Houston. In December 1990, Connally and Oscar Wyatt, chairman of the Coastal Oil Corporation, met with President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. Hussein had been holding foreigners as hostages (or &quot;guests&quot; as Hussein called them) at strategic military sites in Iraq. After the meeting, Hussein agreed to release the hostages.

In one of his last political acts, Connally endorsed Republican congressman Jack Fields of Houston in the special election called in May 1993 to fill the vacancy left by U.S. Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Houston.

==Illness and death==

On May 17, 1993, Connally began to have trouble breathing and was admitted to the Houston Methodist Hospital in Houston, where he died from pulmonary fibrosis, on June 15, at the age of 76.

When Connally died, forensic pathologist Dr. Cyril Wecht and the Assassination Archives and Research Center petitioned Attorney General Janet Reno to recover the remaining bullet fragments from Connally&#x27;s body, contending that the fragments would disprove the Warren Commission&#x27;s single-bullet, single-gunman conclusion. The Justice Department replied that it &quot;...would have no legal authority to recover the fragments unless Connally&#x27;s family gave it permission.&quot; Connally&#x27;s family refused permission.

His funeral was held on June 17, 1993, at the First United Methodist Church of Austin where he and his wife, Nellie Connally, had been members since 1963. Former president Nixon was in attendance. Connally&#x27;s wife Nellie died in 2006; they are interred together at the Texas State Cemetery in Austin.

==Legacy==
A number of buildings and institutions in Texas bear Connally&#x27;s name. Educational institutions named for him including the John B. Connally Middle School, part of Northside ISD, and John B. Connally High School, part of Pflugerville ISD. Texas A&amp;M University and Texas State Technical College each have a building named in his honor. Other notable institutions named for him include a portion of Interstate 410 in San Antonio, the Connally Loop, and the John B. Connally Unit of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice in Karnes County. The Connally Memorial Medical Center in Floresville is named for the Connally family. Downtown Houston has a life-sized statue of Connally in Connally Plaza.

In January 1964, Connally donated the suit he wore on November 22, 1963, to the Texas State Library and Archives Commission (TSLAC). The suit was displayed to the public until March 1964. In 2000, TSLAC loaned the suit to the National Archives and Records Administration for examination purposes. From October 2013 to February 2014, the suit was featured as part of an exhibit at the TSLAC to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Kennedy assassination.

<text>Power Computing Corporation (often referred to as Power Computing) was the first company selected by Apple Inc to create Macintosh-compatible computers (&quot;Mac clones&quot;). Stephen “Steve” Kahng, a computer engineer best known for his design of the Leading Edge Model D, founded the company in November 1993. Power Computing started out with financial backing from Olivetti and Kahng.

The first Mac-compatible (clone) PC shipped in May 1995. Like Dell Computer, Power Computing followed a direct, build-to-order sales model. In one year, Power Computing shipped 100,000 units with revenues of $250 million in the first year. Power Computing was the first company to sell $1,000,000 of products on the Internet.

Power Computing released upgraded models until 1997 with revenues reaching $400 million a year. The Mac clone business was stopped after Steve Jobs returned as interim CEO of Apple in July 1997. In September, Apple bought the core assets of Power Computing for $100 million in Apple stock and terminated the Mac cloning business.

==History==

Power Computing Corporation was founded on November 11, 1993 in Milpitas, California, backed by $5 million from Olivetti and $4 million from Kahng. At the MacWorld Expo in January 1995, just days after receiving notice he had the license to clone Macintosh computers, Kahng enlisted Mac veteran Michael Shapiro to help build the company. Shapiro helped to develop the original logo and brand and worked with Kahng to build the initial management team. Power Computing opened manufacturing and operations offices in Austin, Texas at the recently abandoned facilities of CompuAdd and engineering offices in Cupertino, California, staffed largely by members of Apple&#x27;s original Power Macintosh team. In 1997, PCC relocated its headquarters to a location directly across I-35 from Dell&#x27;s main campus, and remained there until Apple acquired PCC&#x27;s assets in 1997. Kahng set out to create a simplified Mac design that made it cheaper and faster to produce the machines. He then targeted the mail-order market, where Power Computing could get a quicker return on its money than it could by selling through distributors.

: &quot;With direct mail, you get your money back in days by credit card instead of the 30 to 60 days it takes for the resale channel to repay,&quot; Kahng said.

At that time, Apple was leaning towards giving licenses to big-time computer makers. Initially, even with Kahng&#x27;s reputation as a &quot;master cloner&quot;, getting Apple to take him seriously was a challenge. He ended up bringing Olivetti people with him to meetings. Apple engineers gave him the help he needed to make a Mac prototype. The team reduced the size of the Apple main circuit board so that it could fit into a standard PC box. They also used off-the-shelf PC power supplies and monitors.

A few days before the end of the year, it was announced that Apple Computer picked Power Computing to be its first Macintosh clone maker. Jim Gable, Apple&#x27;s director of Mac licensing was quoted in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; saying &quot;[Kahng] is clever and fleet of foot. We want him to succeed.&quot;

Power Computing&#x27;s goal was to have clones available for as little as $1,000 each starting in March or April 1995. John C. Dvorak, a computer columnist at &quot;MacUser&quot; magazine, remarked, &quot;Apple is not going to know what hit them. Stephen Kahng is tenacious.&quot; When the machine was released, Macworld&#x27;s review said

: “The first clones work as well as Apple&#x27;s Macs. That alone represents an auspicious start to Apple&#x27;s reversal of its decade-long go-it-alone strategy. Although these first clones introduce no compelling new technologies, breathtaking features, or stunning industrial designs, they prove that Mac clones can be legitimate alternatives to Apple&#x27;s own Macs.”

=== Initial machines ===

The initial clones were available in desktop and tower configurations, and were based on the PowerPC 601 80 MHz, 100 MHz and 110 MHz microprocessors. They were comparable to Apple Computer&#x27;s Power Macintosh 7100 and 8100 class of computers. Pricing ranged from $1,995–2,899.

: “Power Computing&#x27;s system design (except for the clock-oscillator chip that controls the CPU and bus speed, the two models&#x27; motherboards are identical) suggests a thoughtful, sophisticated approach. This sophistication derives, in part, from help from Apple, as well as from the fact that two key Apple engineers recently joined Power Computing.”
Unlike Apple at the time, Power Computing pressed for direct sales. After a customer placed an order for a semi-customized configuration, the system was delivered the next day. Following the delivery of the system, Power Computing called the customer to surmise their needs and offer technical support and customer service. In addition, Power Computing set a goal of a 3-minute response time for all inquiries.

In May 1995, shortly after the original clone announcement, Power Computing teamed up with Austin, Texas based Metrowerks to offer the Power Computing CodeStation. The CodeStation was a package consisting of the recently announced Power Series clone, rebranded and bundled with the latest PowerPC version of CodeWarrior (CW6 Gold which introduced Magic Cap support). CodeStations were sold through Metrowerks at discounted developer prices and it is unknown exactly how many units were sold.

At the end of July 1995, Power Computing announced that it had successfully ramped the volume production capability of its Power 100 system. The efficiencies provided by volume production allowed Power Computing to lower the base configuration price of a &quot;Power 100 Starter System&quot; to $1,699. In addition, the company instigated a comprehensive quick-ship program that allowed popular configurations to ship the same day. Power Computing advertised models up to the &quot;Power 120 XL&quot;, a $5,499 machine built around the PowerPC 601+ chip, a 2GB SCSI hard drive, 17 inch Sony monitor, 4X-speed CD-ROM, built-in Ethernet, and 32MB RAM.

At the end of October 1995, Power Computing introduced the world&#x27;s fastest Macintosh-compatible computer, the PowerWave, based on the PowerPC 604 microprocessor. Per an article in the &quot;Austin American-Statesman&quot;, Power Computing said its machine would far outperform Windows-compatible machines based on Intel&#x27;s Pentium processors.

At the early 1996 Macworld trade show in San Francisco, Power Computing found itself the star attraction because Apple was so preoccupied with its mounting financial woes that then-CEO Michael Spindler cancelled an appearance. PCC got another break when a computer firm that had spent $170,000 erecting an immense booth pulled out at the last moment, allowing Mr. Kahng to pick up the prime exhibiting space for $30,000.

At that Macworld, the PowerCurve — a line of mid-range, CPU-upgradeable Mac OS systems based on the PowerPC 601 and the industry-standard PCI expansion bus — was introduced. Unique to the PowerCurve 601/120 was the native support of VGA–style monitors.

=== Market success ===
In May 1996, just one year after Power Computing started selling Mac clones, the company reached the 100,000 units sold milestone. The number of employees had grown to 300. And as noted in an article in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; (WSJ) by Jim Carlton, Power CEO Steve Kahng “still hasn’t taken his (golf) clubs out of the bag” (he had vowed not to play another round of his beloved golf until he had shipped the first 30,000 Mac clones).

That same WSJ article noted that one-half of Power Computings&#x27;s customers represent people who would have otherwise purchased a computer from Apple. The others are people who might have bought a non-Mac computer.

: &quot;There is no question Apple is losing sales to us, but we are also expanding the Mac market,&quot; says Geoff Burr, Power Computing&#x27;s vice president of sales and marketing.&quot;

: &quot;Still, unless Apple can rapidly expand its cloning operations -- a goal of new Apple CEO Gilbert Amelio -- to boost flagging Mac market share and generate enough new licensing and software revenue to offset sales lost to cloners, Apple could see its belated cloning campaign backfire.&quot;

In June 1996, Kahng persuaded a unit of Lockheed Martin Corp. to buy 3,000 of his computers rather than Apple&#x27;s. Though a longtime Apple customer, Lockheed Martin said Power beat out Apple&#x27;s bid by agreeing to such extras as loading in special engineering software before shipping the machines out, a request that Apple declined. This was the largest sale in the history of Macs or Mac-compatible computers at the time.

Kahng was able to leverage his strong relationship with IBM to get access to the fastest PowerPC processors sooner than anyone else. As a result, starting in April 1996 and continuing through 1997, Power Computing regularly put out the fastest computer system in either platform (Mac OS or WinTel).

* In April 1996, Power Computing unveiled the PowerTower, based on the 180 MHz and 166 MHz PowerPC 604 processor (announced by IBM on the same day). These were the fastest Mac OS personal computers available at the time.
* Three months later, in July 1996, Power Computing was back with an even faster system – the PowerTower Pro which marked the worldwide debut of the new PowerPC 604e microprocessor featuring clock speeds of up to 225 MHz, making the PowerTower Pro the fastest personal computer available.
* May 27, 1997 – PowerTower Pro 250 outperformed all comparable Pentium and Pentium II class Windows-based systems that were shipping at the time.
* Aug. 4, 1997 – PowerTower Pro G3 275 and PowerTower Pro G3 250 would have been the world&#x27;s first desktop systems using the new PowerPC generation of processors except that they were never built.

At Macworld Expo 1997, the company presented a military-themed campaign that urged the Mac faithful to “Fight Back.” Power Computing employees were outfitted in camouflage. The video wall looped “why we fight” propaganda. And “Steve Says” posters, flyers and T-shirts were ubiquitous inside the Moscone Center as well as in the streets surrounding the convention center (where Power Computing-logoed Hummers, with bullhorns blazing, circled the center).

=== Acquisition of assets by Apple ===
In July, Apple&#x27;s CEO Gil Amelio was ousted by Apple&#x27;s Board of Directors, and Steve Jobs soon returned as interim CEO. Jobs believed that Apple had started to license clones too late to repeat the business model pioneered by Microsoft in the early 1980s.

: &quot;Apple has to let go of this ghost and invent the future,&quot; Jobs said. Instead of expanding the share of the market that used computers based on the Macintosh system, the decision to license clones simply ate into Apple&#x27;s own sales of hardware, he said.

At MacWorld Boston in August, Power Computing President Joel Kocher unsuccessfully tried to convince attendees to rally against Apple&#x27;s stiff new licensing policies. He and other executives resigned soon afterwards as Power Computing&#x27;s board chose to be acquired instead.

On September 2, 1997, Apple Computer bought key assets of Power Computing for more than $100 million in Apple stock and roughly $10 million in cash. As part of the deal, Apple got back the license that allowed Power Computing to sell Macintosh-based machines, also obtaining &quot;the right to retain key employees with expertise in direct marketing, distribution, and engineering&quot;. Some of them helped created Apple&#x27;s next generation of technologies like the iMac. Contrary to impressions given by some reporting and the title of Apple&#x27;s own press release, Apple did not acquire Power Computing itself. Indeed, Power Computing merely emphasised the withdrawal of its license, reprinting the Apple press release, and encouraging potential buyers to hurry while stocks of its clone models remained.

Originally, Power Computing announced that they would adapt to their new situation by making Wintel clones, introducing its PowerTrip line of laptop computers. However, regulatory delays to the Apple deal, delaying receipt of the agreed funds, and lawsuits from suppliers forced the company to downsize, and with the PowerTrip line subsequently cancelled due to &quot;lacklustre sales and manufacturing problems&quot;, the company was described as being in &quot;dire straits&quot;, looking &quot;to find a new way to sell, manufacture and service&quot; and hoping to introduce a new strategy and new products in the spring of 1998.

Parts shortages forced the company to halt production in 1997, and by late January 1998, the last of Power Computing&#x27;s physical assets were auctioned off. Power Computing shareholders were mailed Apple Computer shares representing their &quot;pro rata&quot; share in the now-defunct corporation.

Anyone who had a Power Computing Macintosh clone was given a free upgrade up to Mac OS 8.1 by Apple under the Power Computing name. Ironically, this made Power Computing one of two Macintosh clones to get a Mac OS 8 upgrade disk (the other was UMAX, which got it under an agreement with Apple). Apple continued to provide technical support for any Power Computing machine until December 31, 2004.

==Machine upgrades==
Power Computing&#x27;s machines were one of the most popular Macintosh clone to ever be made. Any 603 or 604 equipped Power Computing machine can officially go up to Mac OS 8.1 due to Apple providing users of Power Computing machines Mac OS 8 upgrade disks as part of the acquisition (most other Macintosh clones can only officially go up to Mac OS 7.6). However, despite officially only going up to Mac OS 8.1, any 603 or 604 equipped Power Computing machine is capable of being upgraded up to Mac OS 9.1, although this is not officially supported by Apple.

Powered by a PowerPC 603e or a 604e processor, Power Computing&#x27;s machines cannot run Mac OS X natively, but with the addition of a G3 or G4 processor upgrade and the use of XPostFacto 4.0, they could run several versions of Mac OS X up to 10.4 Tiger, with some limitations.

A number of Power Computing community websites have appeared over the years.

<doc id="300268" wikidata="Q297232" url="?curid=300268" title="Clint Mansell">
<text>Clinton Darryl Mansell (; born 7 November 1963) is an English musician, singer, and composer. He served as the lead vocalist of alt-rock band Pop Will Eat Itself. After the band&#x27;s dissolution, Mansell moved to the United States and embarked on a career as a film score composer.

Mansell partnered with American filmmaker Darren Aronofsky and composed the scores for his films &quot;Pi&quot;, &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot;, &quot;The Fountain&quot;, &quot;The Wrestler&quot;, &quot;Black Swan&quot;, and &quot;Noah&quot;. Mansell is best known for the &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; soundtrack, particularly the film&#x27;s composition &quot;Lux Aeterna&quot; and a re-orchestrated version titled &quot;Requiem for a Tower&quot; that was created for &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; trailer, both of which have been featured in multiple advertisements, films, film trailers, video games and other media.

He provided the scores for the Ben Wheatley films &quot;High-Rise&quot;, &quot;Happy New Year, Colin Burstead&quot;, &quot;Rebecca&quot;, and &quot;In the Earth&quot;. Other films featuring Mansell&#x27;s scores include &quot;Sahara&quot;, &quot;Moon&quot; and &quot;Stoker&quot;. He has also composed music for television and video games.

Mansell was nominated for a Golden Globe for his work on &quot;The Fountain&quot;, and was nominated for multiple Grammy Awards for his work on &quot;Black Swan&quot;.

==Early life==
Mansell was born in Coventry, England. His father worked for the electricity board and his mother was a preparer of school meals.

Inspired by David Bowie&#x27;s performance of &quot;Starman&quot; on the television series &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, he started to play guitar at the age of nine. His foray into punk-inspired music was influenced by the Ramones. In 2014 he told &quot;Beat Magazine&quot; &quot;I heard the Ramones and punk rock changed my life.&quot; While living in Stourbridge, Mansell played in rock bands as a youth, and at 19 years of age he joined the band that became Pop Will Eat Itself.

==Career==
===Alt-rock career===
From the band&#x27;s inception in 1986 until their dissolution in 1996, Mansell was a member of grebo/alt-rock band Pop Will Eat Itself (PWEI). He served as the band&#x27;s lead vocalist, guitarist and one of the band&#x27;s main songwriters. The band was first introduced to computer-based music in 1988 while working with producer Flood on their album &quot;This Is the Day...This Is the Hour...This Is This!&quot;. Their sound evolved to include sampling and electronic music, bringing influences from hip hop, industrial music and other dance genres into their music. After the band was dropped by RCA, PWEI were signed in 1994 to Nothing Records, a label owned by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails.

Following PWEI&#x27;s break-up in 1996, Mansell moved to New York, where he hoped to start a solo career, but struggled creatively. He was invited by Reznor to move to an apartment in New Orleans owned by Reznor, where Mansell lived for three years, prior to settling in Los Angeles. It was there that Reznor mentored Mansell and introduced him to Pro Tools. Mansell also performed backing vocals on Nine Inch Nails&#x27; 1999 album &quot;The Fragile&quot;.

Mansell reunited with PWEI in 2005 for their &quot;Reformation&quot; tour, which included performances in Nottingham, Birmingham and London.

===Film score career===

While still living in New York, Mansell was introduced to director Darren Aronofsky by a mutual friend. Aronofsky was unaware of Mansell&#x27;s previous work with Pop Will Eat Itself, however the two men bonded over their love of hip hop and their belief that &quot;film music at the time was terrible.&quot;

Aronofsky suggested that Mansell write the opening title piece for &quot;Pi&quot;, Aronofsky&#x27;s feature film directorial debut. Aronofsky had intended to use pre-existing electronic music in the rest of the film, but due to a lack of funds, he found it difficult to acquire the rights to much of the music that interested him and Mansell was hired to provide music for the entire film. Mansell&#x27;s score for the film won him the City of Birmingham award at the Birmingham Film Festival in 2000.

Mansell wrote the score for Aronofsky&#x27;s next film, &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot;, which became a cult hit. The film&#x27;s primary composition &quot;Lux Aeterna&quot; became a favorite in its own right. A re-orchestrated version of the song, titled &quot;Requiem for a Tower&quot;, was arranged by composers Simone Benyacar, Dan Nielsen and Veigar Margeirsson for the trailer of &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot;.

Both &quot;Lux Aeterna&quot; and &quot;Requiem for a Tower&quot; have been used in multiple forms of media, including the film trailers for &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, &quot;I Am Legend&quot;, &quot;Sunshine&quot; and &quot;Babylon A.D.&quot;; trailers for the video games &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot; and &quot;Lord of the Rings: Return of the King&quot;; advertising campaigns for such products as Canon PowerShot cameras, Molson Canadian beer; and on television such as in the series &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;, &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot; as well as a promo spot the series &quot;Flash Forward&quot;.

In 2006, Mansell provided the score for the film &quot;Smokin&#x27; Aces&quot; and he received a BMI Film &amp; TV Award for his work on the film &quot;Sahara&quot; that same year. The following year, his score for the Aronofsky film &quot;The Fountain&quot; was awarded Best Original Film Score of the Year and the Public Choice Award at the 7th World Soundtrack Awards. &quot;The Fountain&quot;″s score was also nominated for Best Score in a Motion Picture at the 2007 Golden Globe Awards.

Mansell&#x27;s score for Aronofsky&#x27;s &quot;Black Swan&quot; garnered him multiple nominations and awards. He was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media as well as Best Original Soundtrack (for &quot;Black Swan&quot;), and Soundtrack Composer of the Year (for &quot;Black Swan&quot;, &quot;Last Night&quot; and &quot;Faster&quot;) at the 11th World Soundtrack Awards. The score was deemed ineligible for the Academy Award for Best Original Score due to its use of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s original music from Swan Lake.

Mansell created the film score for &quot;Moon&quot;, Duncan Jones″s feature film directorial debut. Mansell won Best Technical Achievement at the British Independent Film Awards for &quot;Moon&quot;″s score. In 2011 Mansell was hired to provide the score for &quot;The Iron Lady&quot;, but he was later replaced by composer Thomas Newman. Nevertheless, Mansell&#x27;s music from the film &quot;Moon&quot; was used in the film&#x27;s trailer and was also used in the 2012 trailer of the computer game &quot;&quot;.

Mansell provided the scores for the films &quot;Stoker&quot; (also featuring music by Philip Glass) and &quot;Filth&quot;, which were both released in 2013.

Filmmaker Ben Wheatley, who was a fan of Mansell&#x27;s music for the films &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; and &quot;Moon&quot;, approached Mansell about providing the score for his 2015 film &quot;High-Rise&quot;. Mansell also provided the music for Wheatley&#x27;s subsequent works &quot;Happy New Year, Colin Burstead&quot; (2018) and &quot;Rebecca&quot; (2020) and &quot;In the Earth&quot; (2021).

Mansell&#x27;s film scores have been sampled by such musical artists as Lil Jon, A$AP Rocky, Bastille and Paul Oakenfold.

Having no formal training in musical notation, Mansell constructs his film scores using the method he employs for writing rock music — drums, bass, guitar and vocal lines — in addition to employing an orchestrator. Some of his influences include Philip Glass, Trevor Jones, David Holmes, and bands such as Death in Vegas, Mogwai and Unkle.

===Symphonic performances===
Mansell has performed some of his film compositions live with the Sonus Quartet in the US, the UK and Australia. The Kronos Quartet, who performed &quot;Lux Aeterna&quot; for the &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; soundtrack, have also performed some of Mansell&#x27;s work live.

=== Publishing deal ===
In February 2019, Mansell signed a publishing deal with Decca Publishing, a division of Decca Records. This deal brought his catalogue of more than 650 original pieces, including his Pop Will Eat Itself work, under a single umbrella for the first time.

<doc id="300274" wikidata="Q2706099" url="?curid=300274" title="Alia Atreides">
<text>Alia Atreides () is a fictional character in the &quot;Dune&quot; universe created by Frank Herbert. She was introduced in the first novel of the series, 1965&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot;, and was originally killed in Herbert&#x27;s first version of the manuscript. At the suggestion of &quot;Analog&quot; magazine editor John Campbell, Herbert kept her alive in the final draft. Alia would next appear as a main character in both &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; (1969) and &quot;Children of Dune&quot; (1976). The character is brought back as a ghola in the Brian Herbert/Kevin J. Anderson conclusion to the original series, &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot; (2007).

In the novels, Alia is the daughter of Duke Leto Atreides of Caladan and his Bene Gesserit concubine, Lady Jessica, and the younger sister to Paul Atreides. Born on the planet Arrakis eight months after her father&#x27;s death, she possesses the full powers of an adult Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother. Later known to her followers as St. Alia of the Knife, Alia is considered an Abomination by the Bene Gesserit because of the unique nature of her birth. As an adult, she becomes a devoted ally to Paul, and later regent for his children. She marries the ghola Duncan Idaho, but becomes possessed by the persona of her deceased maternal grandfather, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.

Alia is portrayed by Alicia Witt in David Lynch&#x27;s 1984 film adaptation, by Laura Burton in the 2000 miniseries &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot;, by Daniela Amavia in its 2003 sequel, &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Children of Dune&quot;, and by Anya Taylor-Joy in a cameo appearance in Denis Villeneuve&#x27;s 2024 film &quot;&quot;.

==Description==
The daughter of Duke Leto Atreides of Caladan and his Bene Gesserit concubine, Lady Jessica, Alia is the younger sister to Paul Atreides. During the events of &quot;Dune&quot;, Alia is born on the planet Arrakis in the year 10,191 A.G., eight months after her father&#x27;s death. 
Because of the unique nature of her birth she possesses the consciousness of an adult Bene Gesserit; thus she is considered an Abomination by the Bene Gesserit. 
The Fremen woman Harah notices that four-year-old Alia &quot;only pretends to be a little girl, that she has never been a little girl.&quot; She seeks to explain Alia&#x27;s unique nature to the superstitious and wary Fremen. In the later years of her regency, Alia&#x27;s enemies and victims among the Fremen call her &quot;Coan-Teen&quot;, &quot;the female death spirit who walks without feet.&quot; An adult Alia is described by Herbert in &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;:
Novelist Brian Herbert, Frank Herbert&#x27;s son and biographer, describes Alia as a &quot;virgin witch&quot; archetype. William Touponce explains, &quot;Alia is the archetypal virgin-harlot, a Reverend Mother without motherhood, virgin priestess, witch, and object of fearful veneration for the superstitious masses&quot;.

==Appearances==

===&quot;Dune&quot;===
In &quot;Dune&quot; (1965), Alia is born a full Reverend Mother when she is exposed to the Water of Life (the bile of a drowned sandworm) in the womb as Lady Jessica undergoes the spice agony. Children born this way, called Abominations, are killed by the Bene Gesserit whenever possible because they have little defense against the personalities contained in Other Memory, the Bene Gesserit ability to access ancestral egos and memories. Without the existence of a strong personal identity, a child awakened to consciousness in utero is highly susceptible to becoming possessed by one of her ancestors. Jessica, despite her awareness of this likelihood, brings her baby to term, and Alia slowly learns to control the powers she has been granted as Reverend Mother and sister of the Kwisatz Haderach.

Alia is raised in a community of Fremen, led by her brother in an effort to control the planet and its production of melange. Alia is captured and the infant Leto killed in a Sardaukar raid on the sietch; she is presented to the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, who notes that she had been &quot;in command of one of the attacking groups&quot; of Fremen rebels (&quot;mostly of women, children, and old men&quot;) that nearly decimated his raiding party. Mature far beyond her four years, Alia escapes during the final battle of Arrakeen, but not before pricking her grandfather, Baron Harkonnen, with a deadly, poisoned gom jabbar, also revealing her direct lineage to him in the process. Afterwards, she wanders the battlefield of Arrakeen killing fallen Sardaukar and Harkonnen soldiers with a crysknife, earning her the holy epithet &quot;St. Alia of the Knife.&quot;

Alia uses her limited prescience in a unique way, projecting thoughts and images into the mind of the horrified Imperial Truthsayer, Gaius Helen Mohiam. Bene Gesserit Mohiam tells the Emperor that it is &quot;Not telepathy. She&#x27;s in my mind. She&#x27;s like the ones before me, the ones who gave me their memories. She stands in my mind! She cannot be there, but she is!&quot; Alia further explains that she cannot do this with everyone: &quot;Unless I&#x27;m born as you, I cannot think as you.&quot; Alia soon communicates with Paul the same way:
Touponce suggests that Herbert&#x27;s depiction of larval sandworms (or sandtrout), which hold back water in the desert to maintain the arid conditions their sandworm vector requires to thrive, is &quot;an analogy for a stage of consciousness Alia can feel. Some of the ancestral voices within her mind hold back dangerous forces that could destroy her.&quot;

===&quot;Dune Messiah&quot;===
The character is further explored in 1969&#x27;s &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; through her relationship with the ghola Hayt, who is Paul&#x27;s teacher, Duncan Idaho, brought back from the dead by Tleilaxu means. Throughout the novel, there are hints of sexual tension between them as they work together to unravel the conspiracy against the Atreides. Hayt even steals a kiss from Alia, which upsets her; he responds by saying that he took nothing more than what was offered. Alia eventually agrees. When a blinded Paul departs into the desert, as is the Fremen custom for the blind, Alia is named Regent and the guardian of Paul&#x27;s children: the heir, Leto II, and his sister, Ghanima. Shortly after, Alia marries Hayt, who has regained his full memory and is completely restored as Duncan. Alia gives the order to Fremen leader Stilgar to execute the Reverend Mother Mohiam and Spacing Guild Navigator Edric after the failure of their conspiracy (with the Tleilaxu Face Dancer Scytale and the Princess Irulan of House Corrino) to seize the throne from Paul.

Touponce notes that &quot;Alia will come to sexual maturity in [&quot;Dune Messiah&quot;] and discover an ascendant desire for a mate and political power.&quot; Hayt has been programmed by the Tleilaxu with three functions to be used against the Atreides, one of which is the seduction of Alia.

===&quot;Children of Dune&quot;===
In &quot;Children of Dune&quot; (1976), Alia becomes progressively more devious and power-hungry as she slowly succumbs to Abomination. Falling under the influence of the persona of her deceased grandfather, the Baron Harkonnen, Alia abuses her powers as Regent and becomes a ruthless tyrant. She allows the Baron access to her senses in exchange for his help fighting off the other personalities within her, but his sexual proclivities soon control her, compelling her to engage in sexual acts with one of her aides. During the exercise of his Mentat powers, Duncan comes to the realization that Alia has fallen into Abomination, and helps Jessica escape Alia&#x27;s murderous plot.

The Preacher, actually Paul Atreides, returns once more to the steps of the temple and exposes Alia&#x27;s conversion to Abomination to the Fremen. Her priests soon murder him, as Alia&#x27;s nephew Leto II returns from hiding, his sister Ghanima in tow. The twins offer Alia their help conquering her inner lives, as they had. Alia then loses all control over the other personalities within her and they all fight for dominance over her. Leto realizes that the Baron&#x27;s hold over her is too strong, and provides two options: a Trial of Possession, an ancient ritual that would guarantee the Baron&#x27;s undoing; and the open window, high above the temple steps. As a helpless Jessica looks on, Alia regains control of her body long enough to leap out the window to her death.

===&quot;Hunters of Dune&quot;===
In the Brian Herbert/Kevin J. Anderson novel &quot;Hunters of Dune&quot; (2006), the Face Dancer Khrone manages to restore the memories of the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen ghola. The Baron is displeased to note that Alia&#x27;s voice haunts him in his head, somehow in a reversal of the influence he had over her while she was in the throes of Abomination in &quot;Children of Dune&quot;. Although not possessing the body of the Baron, Alia taunts him mercilessly.

===&quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot;===
In &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot; (2007), the voice of Alia continues to irk the Baron, driving him to frequent outbursts that confuse those around him. Alia is recreated as a ghola on the no-ship &quot;Ithaca&quot;; in an attempt to grow Alia exactly as she had been in life, the axlotl tank is flooded with a near-lethal dose of the spice melange. Although the Alia ghola shows a great deal more maturity than would be expected for her age, she does not display any Other Memory or signs of Abomination. The reincarnated Baron Harkonnen murders the four-year-old Alia ghola on the &quot;Ithaca&quot;, but is soon murdered himself by the Wellington Yueh ghola.

==In adaptations==

Alia is portrayed by Alicia Witt in David Lynch&#x27;s 1984 film adaptation, by Laura Burton in the 2000 miniseries &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot; and by Daniela Amavia in its 2003 sequel, &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Children of Dune&quot;. 

Alia appears briefly as an infant in one of Paul&#x27;s visions of the future in the 2021 film &quot;Dune&quot;, which covers the first part of the book. The casting of Anya Taylor-Joy in &quot;&quot; as an adult Alia in a cameo appearance was kept secret until the February 2024 film premiere in London. 

Laura Fries of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote in 2003, regarding the miniseries adaption of Alia, &quot;Amavia and [Julie] Cox as the tortured Alia and the put-upon Irulan offer layered performances&quot;. Emmet Asher-Perrin of &quot;Tor.com&quot; called Amavia&#x27;s portrayal of Alia a &quot;highlight&quot; of the miniseries, and praised the attention paid to Alia&#x27;s character development. Asher-Perrin praised the miniseries&#x27; departure from the novel in regard to Alia&#x27;s fate:
In the scripting of 2024&#x27;s &quot;Dune: Part Two&quot;, director Denis Villeneuve opted to compress the timeline of events in order to keep Jessica pregnant throughout the film, explaining that he considered it &quot;really fresh and original to have a character who is pregnant and still a powerful woman, a central figure of the story.&quot; As a result of the change, the adaptation assigns aspects of Alia&#x27;s role in the book&#x27;s climax to Paul. Instead, Jessica communicates with the sentient fetus throughout the film, while an adult Alia (played by Taylor-Joy) appears in one of Paul&#x27;s visions of the future. Villeneuve acknowledged &quot;it&#x27;s a strong curve that we took, but I felt that it was very close to the spirit of the book.&quot;

<text>The University of Ontario Institute of Technology, branded as Ontario Tech University or Ontario Tech, is a public research university located in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada. The university&#x27;s main campus is located on approximately of land in northern Oshawa, while its secondary satellite campus is situated in downtown Oshawa. The university is a co-educational institution that operates seven academic faculties.

The institution was founded in 2002 and adopted the brand name Ontario Tech University in 2018. The legal name of the university is unchanged.

In its first decade of operation, the university developed its main campus with the construction of several new buildings. In 2011, the university opened its secondary campus in downtown Oshawa.

In 2021, there were approximately 10,100 undergraduates and 970 graduate students enrolled at the university. As of 2022, the university holds an association with over 25,500 alumni.

==History==
The University of Ontario Institute of Technology was founded in 2002 by the passage of Bill 109, the &quot;University of Ontario Institute of Technology Act, 2002&quot;, by the Legislative Assembly of Ontario on June 27, 2002. It is a public university emphasizing science and technology and was a part of the Ontario government&#x27;s initiative to create more spaces in post-secondary institutions for the flood of post-secondary students in 2003. Ontario Tech is located in the Durham Region of Ontario.
Ontario Tech offers graduate and post-graduate programs and research opportunities. At first there were 947 students in September 2003 and total enrollment was over 5,000 in the 2007–2008 school year. The student population today is over 10,000 students.

Construction on the university&#x27;s first buildings, designed by Diamond Schmitt Architects, began in 2002, and included a geothermal heating and cooling system extending 190m under the main campus quadrangle. These first buildings, three in total, were completed by the end of 2004. The Ontario Power Generation (OPG) building (funded by OPG) and the Campus Recreation and Wellness Centre (CRWC) were built in 2007. The university purchased the historic Regent Theatre in downtown Oshawa in 2009 and renovated it for use as a lecture theatre in 2010. The Clean Energy Research Laboratory (CERL) opened in 2010. In 2011, the Automotive Centre of Excellence (ACE) and the Energy Systems and Nuclear Science Research Centre (ERC) opened. In 2014, the UOIT-Baagwating Indigenous Student Centre (UBISC) opened. In 2017, the Software and Informatics Research Centre (SIRC) was built.

In March 2019, the school was rebranded as Ontario Tech University.

On June 10, 2019, construction of Shawenjigewining (SHA) Hall began. The building officially opened November 4, 2021.

==Campus==
===North campus===
The North campus is located at 2000 Simcoe St North and is considered the &#x27;main&#x27; campus. The Faculty of Business and Information Technology (FBIT), the Faculty of Energy Systems and Nuclear Science (FESNS), the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science (FEAS), the Faculty of Science (FS), the Faculty of Health Science (FHS), and the Faculty of Graduate Studies are located on the North Campus.

Facilities on the North campus include: the award-winning Campus Library, the Science Building, the Business and Information Technology Building, the Energy Systems and Nuclear Science Research Centre (ERC), the Ontario Power Generation (OPG) building, the one-of-a-kind Automotive Centre of Excellence (ACE), the Software and Informatics Research Centre (SIRC), the Campus Recreation and Wellness Centre (CRWC), the University Pavilion (UP), the Student Life building, and student housing. The North campus is co-located with Durham College&#x27;s campus and both institutions share various facilities including the Campus Library, the CRWC, and the bookstore, and various services including parking, security, and IT services. The university has plans in conjunction with Durham College to expand further north in Oshawa over the next few years, on land that they have already purchased. Part of this plan includes the Centre for Cybercrime Research, a university-owned building focusing on research and education in various aspects of cybercrime.

====Automotive Centre of Excellence====
The Automotive Centre of Excellence (ACE) is a multi-level testing and research centre including a five-storey high wind tunnel that allows for climatic, durability, and life cycle testing. It was built by the university in partnership with General Motors (GM) Canada, the Government of Ontario, the Government of Canada and the Partners for the Advancement of Collaborative Engineering Education (PACE). The total cost of the facility was approximately $100 million. It is used by the university for research and education and is also used by GM Canada and its other sponsors for various purposes, including testing new car prototypes. It is divided into two sections: a core research facility (CRF) and an integrated research and training facility (IRTF), with a total area of approximately 16,300 square metres.

The IRTF is the main portion of the building, spanning five floors with space for research and education. This portion of the ACE building is open to university students and is used as a place to study. The CRF, usually referred to as &#x27;the wind tunnel&#x27;, has full-size chambers for full climatic, structural durability and life cycle testing including a climatic wind tunnel. In this test chamber, wind speeds can exceed 240 kilometres per hour, temperatures range from −40 to +60 °C and relative humidity ranges from 5 to 95 per cent. The climatic wind tunnel has a variable nozzle that can optimize the airflow from 7 to 13 square metres (and larger) as well as a large flexible chassis dynamometer integrated into a 11.5-metre turntable; these allow for vehicles in a wide range of sizes to be tested at various angles of windflow, including crosswind. The chamber also includes a solar array that can replicate the effects of the sun.

====Energy Research Centre====
The Energy Research Centre (ERC) is a 9,290-square-metre, four-storey facility focusing on clean energy technologies that houses Ontario Tech&#x27;s nuclear engineering undergraduate program, the only program of its kind in Canada. This building is used for research in geothermal, hydraulic, hydrogen, natural gas, nuclear, solar, and wind energy technologies. The ERC is the result of a joint $45.4-million investment from the Government of Canada and the Government of Ontario as part of the Knowledge Infrastructure Program.

The ERC contains a 72-seat lecture theatre, three 50-seat classrooms, two 30-seat tutorial rooms with flexible seating, 11 student-study (breakout) rooms, 12 labs, dedicated working stations for graduate students, and administrative space and offices for staff and faculty. One of the more notable labs is an extensive nuclear power plant computer simulation, the most extensive of its kind. The second, third, and fourth floors of the ERC have indoor connections to the adjacent Business and Information Technology building. The ERC features a glass-covered atrium with a large hanging metal-wire sculpture of Northern Dancer, the famous, award-winning Canadian horse from Windfields Farm. Ontario Tech and Durham College purchased the core area of Windfield Farms in 2013, including the site where Northern Dancer was buried; the sculpture is a tribute.

===Downtown campus===
The Downtown campus is located in the downtown region of Oshawa, approximately ten minutes away from the North campus. Most of Ontario Tech&#x27;s buildings in the downtown campus have not yet been named and are instead referred to by the address at which they are located. The Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities (FSSH) and the Faculty of Education (FE) are located at the downtown campus.

Facilities at the Downtown campus include: Bordessa Hall, 61 Charles Street, Regent Theatre, 2 Simcoe Street South, 11 Simcoe Street North, and the UOIT-Baagwating Indigenous Student Centre (UBISC).

====Regent Theatre====
The Regent Theatre is a 609-seat lecture theatre used by the university that, despite being a historic location, is fully outfitted with electric sockets and fold-down side-desks for students&#x27; computers. When not in use by the university, the theatre is also rented out for events in the evenings and on weekends, including regular use by the Ontario Philharmonic Orchestra, who hold most of their concerts in the Regent Theatre.

===Student housing===
The residences for Ontario Tech are shared by Ontario Tech and Durham College students, as well as Trent University students studying at Trent&#x27;s Oshawa campus. There are two separate residences on campus: Simcoe Village and South Village. Both of these residences are managed by Campus Living Centres.

===Sustainability===
Ontario Tech has many &#x27;green energy&#x27; features on campus, including solar panels on the roof of the Promenade, geothermal heating sourced from deep under the Polonsky Commons, and green roofs to reduce heating and cooling costs.

==Administration==
Ontario Tech University is a publicly funded institution, and operates under a bicameral system with a board of governors and an academic council empowered by provincial legislation, the &quot;University of Ontario Institute of Technology Act, 2002&quot;.

===Governance===
The university&#x27;s board of governors is charged with the management of the university&#x27;s affairs, including its assets, properties, and revenue. The board of governors is made up of 25 members, including the university&#x27;s chancellor, its president and vice-chancellor, three members appointed by the Lieutenant Governor-in-Council, 12 to 16 board-appointed members, and four members who must be students or employees of the universities.

The academic council is responsible for making recommendations to the board of governors concerning the institution&#x27;s academic policies, as well as making recommendations for the conferment of honorary degrees. The council&#x27;s &quot;ex-officio&quot; members include the university&#x27;s chancellor, president, provost, university librarian, the registrar, its academic administrators, and the deans of the university&#x27;s faculties. Elected members include members of the university&#x27;s faculties, its student body, and its administrative staff.

===Chief officers===
The university&#x27;s chief executive officer is the president and vice-chancellor, supervising the administrative and academic direction of the university, its students, and its faculty and staff. The president is appointed by the board, with Steven A. Murphy being the fourth person appointed to the position on 1 March 2018.

The provost is the chief academic officer of the university and advises the president on all academic affairs. They act as the institutional planner and administrator for the university&#x27;s teaching and research operations, with the deans of each faculty reporting to the provost&#x27;s office. During a president&#x27;s absence, they also serve as the acting president of the institution.

The titular head of the institution is the chancellor. However, the role is largely ceremonial, as they are primarily charged with only presiding over the university&#x27;s convocations to confer degrees on behalf of the institution. The chancellor is appointed by the board on a three-year term, with Mitch Frazer named as the institution&#x27;s fourth chancellor as of May 2020.

==Academics==
The university aims to educate its students in a &quot;technology-enriched environment&quot;, and offers IT services and leased laptop programs to help support this pedagogy. The university&#x27;s academic year is organized into three semesters, Fall, Winter, and Spring/Summer.

The university&#x27;s academic programs are administered by six faculties, the Faculty of Business and Information Technology, the Faculty of Education, the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, the Faculty of Health Science, the Faculty of Science, and the Faculty of Social Science and Humanities. Most faculties are further organized into smaller academic departments and schools. Graduate programs are coordinated by the School of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies. The university also provides continuing education through its Continuous Learning department. In 2020, the university had a total of 318 instructional faculty members, 264 of whom held either a doctorate, professional degree, or another type of terminal degree.
In 2019, the university conferred 1,755 bachelor&#x27;s degrees, 124 professional degrees, 227 graduate degrees, and 84 graduate diplomas. More than a third of all graduate degrees conferred by the university was from an engineering-related program.

The university holds membership with several national and international academic postsecondary organizations, such as Universities Canada.

===Reputation===

In &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; 2023 ranking of Canadian universities, Ontario Tech University placed ninth out of 19 universities in their primarily undergraduate university category, and 31st out of 49 universities in their national reputational survey. 

Ontario Tech University has ranked in several international post-secondary school rankings. In the &quot;Times Higher Education World University Rankings&quot; for 2023, the university was ranked 601–800 out of 2,671 post-secondary institutions. In &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; 2022–23 global university rankings, the university placed 1121st out of 2,459 schools.

===Research===
The university engages in academic research and operates eight research institutes and centres, as well as several research groups. Additionally, the university also operates a joint research facility with the University of Technology Sydney, the Joint Research Centre for AI for Health and Wellness.

As of 2022, 11 faculty members from the university hold Canada Research Chairs. Seven chairholders sit on the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, and two sit on the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council. In the 2020–21 academic year, the university received 159 research awards and approximately $4.6 million in funding from the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council, 49 research rewards and nearly $2 million in funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Council, and six research rewards and $433,375 in funding from the Canadian Institute of Health.

In 2020, the university had a sponsored research income of approximately $17.6 million. In the same year, the university&#x27;s faculty averaged a sponsored research income of $80,900, while graduate students averaged a sponsored research income of $21,700.

===Admission===
The requirements for admission differ between students from Ontario, students from other provinces, and students based outside of Canada, due to a lack of uniforming in marking schemes between provinces and countries. In addition to academic requirements, the university also requires applicants whose first language is not English to present proof that they are proficient in the English language.

In 2018, the university reported a retention rate of 81.1 per cent of first year students who advanced onto their second year at the university.

==Student life==

In the 2021–22 academic year, the university student body included 10,030 full-time and part-time undergraduate students, and 1,020 full-time and part-time graduate students. The student body is primarily made up of Canadians, with over 90 per cent of the student body holding Canadian citizenship.

===Organizations===
The university&#x27;s student body is represented through the Ontario Tech Student Union (OTSU). The students&#x27; union was formed in 2017. Prior to that, the university&#x27;s student body was represented by a student association that represented the student bodies of Ontario Tech and Durham College. The association&#x27;s split resulted from a controversy over accountability and student fees between the two student bodies. Services provided by the OTSU includes academic advocacy, legal services, and medical insurance. The student union sanctions several student-run organizations, including clubs based on common interest, and institutional student-run societies for most academic faculties.

The university formally does not grant recognition to any fraternities or sororities, and that they are independent organizations that are not associated or sanctioned with the university. However, there are several fraternities and sororities that operate around the campus. These organizations, some of which are residential and some of which are not, host events for students and do philanthropy work for the surrounding community. &quot;Tau Kappa Epsilon&quot; has an annual charity event known as &quot;Teke in a box&quot; that raises money for the campus food centre, and &quot;Zeta Psi&quot; has an annual charity event known as &quot;Zete car push&quot;.

&quot;The Chronicle&quot; is a student newspaper that serves the student bodies of Ontario Tech University and Durham College. The newspaper is produced by Durham College journalist students.

===Athletics===

The university&#x27;s sports teams compete as the &quot;Ontario Tech Ridgebacks&quot; in U Sports&#x27; Ontario University Athletics (OUA) conference. Varsity teams include badminton, basketball, curling, dance, field lacrosse, golf, ice hockey, rowing and soccer. The university&#x27;s athletic department also maintains sports clubs for cricket, esports, and equestrian.

==Insignias and other representations==

The Latin name of the university is &quot;Universitas Ontario Instituto Technologiae&quot; and its motto is &quot;Cogitando et Agendo Ducemus&quot;, meaning &quot;By thinking and doing we shall lead&quot;. Ontario Tech&#x27;s slogan is &quot;Challenge, Innovate, Connect&quot;.

===Branding===
The official name of the institution under provincial legislation is the &quot;University of Ontario Institute of Technology&quot;, and is used in formal documentation issued by the institution, including academic degrees.

However, the university publicly operates under a different name, &quot;Ontario Tech University&quot;. The institution explored the idea of adopting a new name in 2018, given that the abbreviation &#x27;UOIT&#x27; was hard to pronounce and made marketing difficult. The subject became a topic of discussion for months, followed by feedback from both the stakeholders and the school. The operating name was adopted by the university in March 2019, which led to a system-wide revamp in all promotional materials including banners, merchandise, and the website. The change was met with mixed reviews.

===Coat of arms===
== Notable people==
A number of individuals are associated with the university either as alumni or members of its administration and faculty. As of 2022, there were over 25,500 Ontario Tech alumni. The university operates an alumni association for graduates. Alumni of the university includes Kate Beirness, a television sportscaster, Naheed Dosani, a palliative care physician, Khashayar Farzam, a physician and Powerlifter and Vijay Thanigasalam, the incumbent Member of Provincial Parliament for Scarborough-Rouge Park. Notable faculty members include Vivian Stamatopoulos, a long-term care advocate, and electrical engineer Min Dong, an IEEE Fellow.

<text>An integrated [[receiver (radio)|receiver]]/decoder (IRD) is an electronic device used to pick up a radio-frequency signal and convert digital information transmitted in it.

==Consumer IRDs==
Consumer IRDs, commonly called set-top boxes, are used by end users and are much cheaper compared to professional IRDs. To curb content piracy, they also lack many features and interfaces found in professional IRDs such as outputting uncompressed SDI video or ASI transport stream dumps. They are also designed to be more aesthetically pleasing.

==Professional IRDs==
Commonly found in radio, television, Cable and satellite broadcasting facilities, the IRD is generally used for the reception of contribution feeds that are intended for re-broadcasting. The IRD is the interface between a receiving satellite dish or Telco networks and a broadcasting facility video/audio infrastructure. 

Professional IRDs have various features that consumer IRDs lack such as:

* SDI outputs.
* ASI inputs / outputs.
* TSoIP inputs.
* AES/EBU Audio decoding.
* VBI reinsertion.
* WSS data and pass through.
* Transport stream demultiplexing.
* Genlock input.
* Frame synchronization of digital video output to analogue input.
* Closed captions and VITS/ITS/VITC Insertion.
* Video test pattern generator.
* Remote management over LAN/WAN.
* GPI interface - For sending external alarm triggers.
* Rack mountable.

==Uses==
* direct broadcast satellite (DBS) television applications like DirecTV, Astra or DishTV
* fixed service satellite (FSS) applications like VideoCipher, DigiCipher, or PowerVu
* digital audio radio satellite (DARS) applications like XM Satellite Radio and Sirius Satellite Radio
* digital audio broadcasting (DAB) applications like Eureka 147 and IBOC
* digital video broadcasting (DVB) applications like DVB-T and ATSC
