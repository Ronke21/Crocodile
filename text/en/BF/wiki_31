<text>Buddhism was first established in Japan in the 6th century CE. Most of the Japanese Buddhists belong to new schools of Buddhism which were established in the Kamakura period (1185－1333). During the Edo (Tokugawa)-period (1603–1868), Buddhism was controlled by the feudal Shogunate. The Meiji period (1868–1912) saw a strong response against Buddhism, with persecution and a forced separation between Buddhism and Shinto (&quot;Shinbutsu bunri&quot;).

As of 2022, around 70.8 million people, or about 67% of Japan&#x27;s total population, identify as Buddhist. Japan has the second largest Buddhist population in the world, after China. The largest sects of Japanese Buddhism are Pure Land Buddhism with 22 million believers, followed by Nichiren Buddhism with 10 million believers, Shingon Buddhism with 5.4 million, Zen Buddhism with 5.3 million, Tendai Buddhism with 2.8 million, and only about 700,000 for the six old schools established in the Nara period (710－794).

== History ==
===Early Buddhism (5th-13th century)===
==== Arrival and initial spread of Buddhism ====

Originating in India, Buddhism arrived in Japan by first making its way to China and Korea through the Silk Road and then traveling by sea to the Japanese archipelago. Though often overlooked in Western academia, Buddhism was transmitted through trade routes across South East Asia in addition to the Sinophere. As such, early Japanese Buddhism is strongly influenced by Chinese Buddhism and Korean Buddhism, which were influenced by Indian Mahayana Buddhism. Though most scholars date the introduction of Buddhism to the middle of the sixth century, Deal and Ruppert note that immigrants from the Korean Peninsula, as well as merchants and sailors who frequented the mainland, likely brought Buddhism with them independent of the transmission as recorded in court chronicles. Some Japanese sources mention this explicitly. For example, the Heian Period &quot;Fusō ryakki&quot; (Abridged Annals of Japan), mentions a foreigner known in Japanese as Shiba no Tatsuto, who may have been Chinese-born, Baekje-born, or a descendant of an immigrant group in Japan. He is said to have built a thatched hut in Yamato and enshrined an object of worship there. Immigrants like this may have been a source for the Soga clan&#x27;s later sponsorship of Buddhism.

The &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; (&quot;Chronicles of Japan&quot;) provides a date of 552 for when King Seong of Baekje (now western South Korea) sent a mission to Emperor Kinmei that included an image of the Buddha Shakyamuni, ritual banners, and sutras. This event is usually considered the official introduction of Buddhism to Japan. Other sources, however, give the date of 538 and both dates are thought to be unreliable. However, it can still be said that in the middle of the sixth century, Buddhism was introduced through official diplomatic channels.

According to the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, after receiving the Buddhist gifts, the Japanese emperor asked his officials if the Buddha should be worshipped in Japan. They were divided on the issue, with Soga no Iname (506–570) supporting the idea while Mononobe no Okoshi and Nakatomi no Kamako worried that the kami of Japan would become angry at this worship of a foreign deity. The &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; then states that the emperor allowed only the Soga clan to worship the Buddha, to test it out.

Thus, the powerful Soga clan played a key role in the early spread of Buddhism in the country. Their support, along with that of immigrant groups like the Hata clan, gave Buddhism its initial impulse in Japan along with its first temple (Hōkō-ji, also known as Asukadera). The Nakatomi and Mononobe, however, continued to oppose the Soga, blaming their worship for disease and disorder. These opponents of Buddhism are even said to have thrown the image of the Buddha into the Naniwa canal. Eventually outright war erupted. The Soga side, led by Soga no Umako and a young Prince Shōtoku, emerged victorious and promoted Buddhism on the archipelago with support of the broader court.

Based on traditional sources, Shōtoku has been seen as an ardent Buddhist who taught, wrote on, and promoted Buddhism widely, especially during the reign of Empress Suiko (554 – 15 April 628). He is also believed to have sent envoys to China and is even seen as a spiritually accomplished bodhisattva who is the true founder of Japanese Buddhism. Modern historians have questioned much of this, seeing most of it as a constructed hagiography. A popular quote attributed to Shōtoku that became foundational for Buddhist belief in Japan is translated as &quot;The world is vain and illusory, and the Buddha&#x27;s realm alone is true.&quot; Regardless of his actual historical role, however, it is beyond doubt that Shōtoku became an important figure in Japanese Buddhist lore beginning soon after his death if not earlier.

Taoist traditions of immortality and becoming a &quot;xian&quot; made it to Japan in the times of early Buddhism, but Buddhism absorbed them. &quot;[U]nder Buddhist influence,&quot; these stories were &quot;associated with certain ascetic monks who were devoted to the Lotus Sutra.&quot;

==== Asuka Buddhism (552–645) ====

Asuka-period (538 to 710) Buddhism (&quot;Asuka bukkyō&quot;) refers to Buddhist practice and thought that mainly developed after 552 in the Nara Basin region. Buddhism grew here through the support and efforts of two main groups: immigrant kinship groups like the Hata clan (who were experts in Chinese technology as well as intellectual and material culture), and through aristocratic clans like the Soga.

Immigrant groups like the Korean monks who supposedly instructed Shōtoku introduced Buddhist learning, administration, ritual practice and the skills to build Buddhist art and architecture. They included individuals like Ekan (dates unknown), a Koguryŏ priest of the Madhyamaka school, who (according to the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;) was appointed to the highest rank of primary monastic prelate (&quot;sōjō&quot;).

Aside from the Buddhist immigrant groups, Asuka Buddhism was mainly the purview of aristocratic groups like the Soga clan and other related clans, who patronized clan temples as a way to express their power and influence. These temples mainly focused on the performance of rituals which were believed to provide magical effects, such as protection. During this period, Buddhist art was dominated by the style of Tori Busshi, who came from a Korean immigrant family.
==== Hakuhō Buddhism (645–710) ====
Hakuhō (673 through 686) Buddhism (Hakuhō refers to Emperor Tenmu) saw the official patronage of Buddhism being taken up by the Japanese imperial family, who replaced the Soga clan as the main patrons of Buddhism. Japanese Buddhism at this time was also influenced by Tang dynasty (618–907) Buddhism. It was also during this time that Buddhism began to spread from the Yamato Province to the other regions and islands of Japan. An important part of the centralizing reforms of this era (the Taika reforms) was the use of Buddhist institutions and rituals (often performed at the palace or capital) in the service of the state.

The imperial government also actively built and managed the Buddhist temples as well as the monastic community. The Nihon Shoki states that in 624 there were 46 Buddhist temples. Some of these temples include Kawaradera and Yakushiji. Archeological research has also revealed numerous local and regional temples outside of the capital. At the state temples, Buddhist rituals were performed in order to create merit for the royal family and the well-being of the nation. Particular attention was paid to rituals centered around Buddhist sutras (scriptures), such as the &quot;Golden Light Sutra&quot;. The monastic community was overseen by the complex and hierarchical imperial Monastic Office (&quot;sōgō&quot;), who managed everything from the monastic code to the color of the robes.

==== Nara Buddhism (710–794) ====

In 710, Empress Genme moved the state capital to Heijōkyō, (modern Nara) thus inaugurating the Nara period. This period saw the establishment of the &quot;kokubunji&quot; system, which was a way to manage provincial temples through a network of national temples in each province. The head temple of the entire system was Tōdai-ji (completed in 752).

Nara state sponsorship saw the development of the six great Nara schools, called , all were continuations of Chinese Buddhist schools. The temples of these schools became important places for the study of Buddhist doctrine. The six Nara schools were: &quot;Ritsu&quot; (Vinaya), &quot;Jōjitsu&quot; (Tattvasiddhi)&quot;, Kusha-shū&quot; (Abhidharmakosha), &quot;Sanronshū&quot; (East Asian Mādhyamaka), &quot;Hossō&quot; (East Asian Yogācāra) and &quot;Kegon&quot; (Huayan).

These schools were centered around the capital where great temples such as the Asuka-dera and Tōdai-ji were erected. The most influential of the temples are known as the &quot;seven great temples of the southern capital&quot; (&quot;Nanto Shichi Daiji&quot;). The temples were not exclusive and sectarian organizations. Instead, temples were apt to have scholars versed in several of schools of thought. It has been suggested that they can best be thought of as &quot;study groups&quot;.

State temples continued the practice of conducting numerous rituals for the good of the nation and the imperial family. Rituals centered on scriptures like the &quot;Golden Light&quot; and the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;. Another key function of the state temples was the transcription of Buddhist scriptures, which was seen as generating much merit. Buddhist monastics were firmly controlled by the state&#x27;s monastic office through an extensive monastic code of law, and monastic ranks were matched to the ranks of government officials. It was also during this era that the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; was written, a text which shows significant Buddhist influence. The monk Dōji (?–744) may have been involved in its compilation.

The elite state sponsored Nara Buddhism was not the only type of Buddhism at this time. There were also groups of unofficial monastics or priests (or, self-ordained; &quot;shido sōni&quot;) who were either not formally ordained and trained through the state channels, or who chose to preach and practice outside of the system. These &quot;unofficial&quot; monks were often subject to state punishment. Their practice could have also included Daoist and indigenous kami worship elements. Some of these figures became immensely popular and were a source of criticism for the sophisticated, academic and bureaucratic Buddhism of the capital.

==== Early Heian Period Buddhism (794–950) ====
During the Heian period, the capital was shifted to Kyoto (then known as Heiankyō) by emperor Kanmu, mainly for economic and strategic reasons. As before, Buddhist institutions continued to play a key role in the state, with Kanmu being a strong supporter of the new Tendai school of Saichō (767–822) in particular. Saichō, who had studied the Tiantai school in China, established the influential temple complex of Enryakuji at Mount Hiei, and developed a new system of monastic regulations based on the bodhisattva precepts. This new system allowed Tendai to free itself from direct state control.

Also during this period, the Shingon ( Ch. Zhenyan; &quot;True Word&quot;, from Sanskrit: &quot;Mantra&quot;) school was established in the country under the leadership of Kūkai. This school also received state sponsorship and introduced esoteric Vajrayana (also referred to as &quot;mikkyō&quot;, &quot;secret teaching&quot;) elements.

The new Buddhist lineages of Shingon and Tendai also developed somewhat independently from state control, partly because the old system was becoming less important to Heian aristocrats. This period also saw an increase in the official separation between the different schools, due to a new system that specified the particular school which an imperial priest (&quot;nenbundosha&quot;) belonged to.

==== Later Heian Period Buddhism (950–1185) ====
During this period, there was a consolidation of a series of annual court ceremonies (&quot;nenjū gyōji&quot;). Tendai Buddhism was particularly influential, and the veneration of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; grew in popularity, even among the low class and non-aristocratic population, which often formed religious groups such as the &quot;Lotus holy ones&quot; (&quot;hokke hijiri&quot; or &quot;jikyōja&quot;) and mountain ascetics (&quot;shugenja&quot;). Shugendō is an example of the fusion of Shinto mountain worship and Buddhism. The aim of Shugendo practitioners is to save the masses by acquiring supernatural powers through rigorous training while walking through steep mountains.

Furthermore, during this era, new Buddhist traditions began to develop. While some of these have been grouped into what is referred to as &quot;new Kamakura&quot; Buddhism, their beginning can actually be traced to the late Heian. This includes the practice of Japanese Pure Land Buddhism, which focuses on the contemplation and chanting of the &quot;nenbutsu&quot;, the name of the Buddha Amida (Skt. Amitābha), in hopes of being reborn in the Buddha field of Sukhāvatī. This practice was initially popular in Tendai monasteries but then spread throughout Japan. Texts discussing miracles associated with the Buddhas and bodhisattvas became popular in this period, along with texts which outlined death bed rites.

During this period, some Buddhist temples established groups of warrior-monks called Sōhei. This phenomenon began in Tendai temples, as they vied for political influence with each other. The Genpei war saw various groups of warrior monks join the fray.

There were also semi-independent clerics (who were called shōnin or hijiri, &quot;holy ones&quot;) who lived away from the major Buddhist monasteries and preached to the people. These figures had much more contact with the general populace than other monks. The most well known of these figures was Kūya (alt. Kōya; 903–972), who wandered throughout the provinces engaging in good works (&quot;sazen&quot;), preaching on nembutsu practice and working with local Buddhist cooperatives (&quot;zenchishiki&quot;) to create images of bodhisattvas like Kannon.

Another important development during this era was that Buddhist monks were now being widely encouraged by the state to pray for the salvation of Japanese &quot;kami&quot; (divine beings in Shinto). The merging of Shinto deities with Buddhist practice was not new at this time. Already in the eighth century, some major Shinto shrines (&quot;jingūji&quot;) included Buddhist monks which conducted rites for shinto divinities. One of the earliest such figures was &quot;great Bodhisattva Hachiman&quot; (Hachiman daibosatsu) who was popular in Kyūshū.

Popular sites for pilgrimage and religious practice, like Kumano, included both kami worship and the worship of Buddhas and bodhisattvas, which were often associated with each other. Furthermore, temples like Tōdai-ji also included shrines for the worship of kami (in Tōdai-ji&#x27;s case, it was the kami Shukongōjin that was enshrined in its rear entryway).

Buddhist monks interpreted their relationship to the kami in different ways. Some monks saw them as just worldly beings who could be prayed for. Other saw them as manifestations of Buddhas and bodhisattvas. For example, the Mt. Hiei monk Eryō saw the kami as &quot;traces&quot; (suijaku) of the Buddha. This idea, called essence-trace (&quot;honji-suijaku&quot;), would have a strong influence throughout the medieval era.

The copying and writing of Buddhist scripture was a widespread practice in this period. It was seen as producing merit (good karma). Artistic portraits depicting events from the scriptures were also quite popular during this era. They were used to generate merit as well as to preach and teach the doctrine. The &quot;Enshrined Sutra of the Taira Family&quot; (&quot;Heikenōkyō&quot;), is one of the greatest examples of Buddhist visual art from this period. It is an elaborately illustrated Lotus Sūtra installed at Itsukushima Shrine.

The Buddhist liturgy of this era also became more elaborate and performative. Rites such as the Repentance Assembly (&quot;keka&#x27;e&quot;) at Hōjōji developed to include elaborate music, dance and other forms of performance. Major temples and monasteries such as the royal Hosshōji temple and Kōfukuji, also became home to the performance of Sarugaku theater (which is the origin of Nō Drama) as well as ennen (&quot;longevity-enhancing&quot;) arts which included dances and music. Doctrinally, these performative arts were seen as skillful means (&quot;hōben&quot;, Skt. &quot;upaya&quot;) of teaching Buddhism. Monks specializing in such arts were called yūsō (&quot;artistic monks&quot;).

Another way of communicating the Buddhist message was through the medium of poetry, which included both Chinese poetry (kanshi) and Japanese poetry (waka). An example of Buddhist themed waka is Princess Senshi&#x27;s (964–1035) &quot;Hosshin waka shū&quot; (Collection of Waka of the Awakening Mind, 1012). The courtly practice of rōei (performing poetry to music) was also taken up in the Tendai and Shingon lineages. Both monks and laypersons met in poetry circles (&quot;kadan&quot;) like the Ninnaji circle which was patronized by Prince Shukaku (1150–1202).

=== Kamakura Buddhism (1185–1333) - new schools of Buddhism===
The Kamakura period (1185–1333) was a period of crisis in which the control of the country moved from the imperial aristocracy to the samurai. In 1185 the Kamakura shogunate was established at Kamakura. 
This period saw the development of new Buddhist lineages or schools which have been called &quot;Kamakura Buddhism&quot; and &quot;New Buddhism&quot;. All of the major founders of these new lineages were ex-Tendai monks who had trained at Mt. Hiei and had studied the exoteric and esoteric systems of Tendai Buddhism. During the Kamakura period, these new schools did not gain as much prominence as the older lineages, with the possible exception of the highly influential Rinzai Zen school.

Among the founders of the forty-six sects in Japanese Zen, sixteen were Chinese masters, fifteen were Japanese masters who traveled to China during the reign of the Song dynasty, and another fifteen were Japanese masters who visited China during the reign of the Yuan dynasty.

The new schools include Pure Land lineages like Hōnen&#x27;s (1133–1212) Jōdo shū and Shinran&#x27;s (1173–1263) Jōdo Shinshū, both of which focused on the practice of chanting the name of Amida Buddha. These new Pure Land schools both believed that Japan had entered the era of the decline of the Dharma (&quot;mappō&quot;) and that therefore other Buddhist practices were not useful. The only means to liberation was now the faithful chanting of the nembutsu. This view was critiqued by more traditional figures such as Myō&#x27;e (1173–1232).

Another response to the social instability of the period was an attempt by certain monks to return to the proper practice of Buddhist precepts as well as meditation. These figures include figures like the Kōfukuji monk Jōkei (1155–1213) and the Tendai monk Shunjō (1166–1227), who sought to return to the traditional foundations of the Buddhist path, ethical cultivation and meditation practice.

Other monks attempted to minister to marginalized low class groups. The Kegon-Shingon monk Myō&#x27;e was known for opening his temple to lepers, beggars, and other marginal people, while precept masters such as Eison (1201–1290) and Ninshō (1217–1303) were also active in ministering and caring for ill and marginalized persons, particularly those outcast groups termed &quot;non-persons&quot; (&quot;hinin&quot;). Deal &amp; Ruppert (2015) p. 122 Ninshō established a medical facility at Gokurakuji in 1287, which treated more than 88,000 people over a 34-year-period and collected Chinese medical knowledge.

Another set of new Kamakura schools include the two major Zen schools of Japan (Rinzai and Sōtō), promulgated by monks such as Eisai and Dōgen, which emphasize liberation through the insight of meditation (zazen). Dōgen (1200–1253) began a prominent meditation teacher and abbot. He introduced the Chan lineage of Caodong, which would grow into the Sōtō school. He criticized ideas like the final age of the Dharma (&quot;mappō&quot;), and the practice of apotropaic prayer. 

Additionally, it was during this period that monk Nichiren (1222–1282) began teaching his exclusively &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; based Buddhism, which he saw as the only valid object of devotion in the age of mappō. Nichiren believed that the conflicts and disasters of this period were caused by the wrong views of Japanese Buddhists (such as the followers of Pure Land and esoteric Buddhism). Nichiren faced much opposition for his views and was also attacked and exiled twice by the Kamakura state.

===Muromachi period (1336–1573) and Azuchi–Momoyama period (1573–1603)===

==== Late Medieval Buddhism (1336–1467) ====

During this period, the new &quot;Kamakura schools&quot; continued to develop and began to consolidate themselves as unique and separate traditions. However, as Deal and Ruppert note, &quot;most of them remained at the periphery of Buddhist institutional power and, in some ways, discourse during this era.&quot; They further add that it was only &quot;from the late fifteenth century onward that these lineages came to increasingly occupy the center of Japanese Buddhist belief and practice.&quot; The only exception is Rinzai Zen, which attained prominence earlier (13th century). Meanwhile, the &quot;old&quot; schools and lineages continued to develop in their own ways and remained influential.

The new schools&#x27; independence from the old schools did not happen all at once. In fact, the new schools remained under the old schools&#x27; doctrinal and political influence for some time. For example, Ōhashi Toshio has stressed how during this period, the Jōdo sect was mainly seen as a subsidiary or temporary branch sect of Tendai. Furthermore, not all monks of the old sects were antagonistic to the new sects.

During the height of the medieval era, political power was decentralized and shrine-temple complexes were often competing with each other for influence and power. These complexes often controlled land and multiple manors, and also maintained military forces of warrior monks which they used to battle with each other. In spite of the instability of this era, the culture of Buddhist study and learning continued to thrive and grow.

Furthermore, though there were numerous independent Buddhist schools and lineages at this time, many monks did not exclusively belong to one lineage and instead traveled to study and learn in various temples and seminaries. This tendency of practicing in multiple schools or lineages was termed &quot;shoshū kengaku&quot;. It became much more prominent in the medieval era due to the increased social mobility that many monks enjoyed&quot;.&quot; 

Both the Kamakura shogunate (1192–1333) and the Ashikaga shogunate (1336–1573) supported and patronized the &quot;Five Mountains culture&quot; (&quot;Gozan Jissetsu Seido&quot;) of Rinzai Zen. This Rinzai Zen tradition was centered on the ten &quot;Five Mountain&quot; temples (five in Kyoto and five in Kamakura). Besides teaching zazen meditation, they also pursued studies in esoteric Buddhism and in certain art forms like calligraphy and poetry. A pivotal early figure of Rinzai was Enni Ben&#x27;en (1202–1280), a high-ranking and influential monk who was initiated into Tendai and Shingon. He then traveled to China to study Zen and later founded Tōfukuji.

The Tendai and Shingon credentials of Rinzai figures such as Enni show that early Zen was not a lineage that was totally separate from the other &quot;old&quot; schools. Indeed, Zen monastic codes feature procedures for &quot;worship of the Buddha, funerals, memorial rites for ancestral spirits, the feeding of hungry ghosts, feasts sponsored by donors, and tea services that served to highlight the bureaucratic and social hierarchy.&quot; 

Medieval Rinzai was also invigorated by a series of Chinese masters who came to Japan during the Song dynasty, such as Yishan Yining (1247–1317). Issan influenced the Japanese interest in Chinese literature, calligraphy and painting. The Japanese literature of the Five Mountains (&quot;Gozan Bungaku&quot;) reflects this influence. One of his students was Musō Soseki, a Zen master, calligraphist, poet and garden designer who was granted the title &quot;national Zen teacher&quot; by Emperor Go-Daigo. The Zen monk poets Sesson Yūbai and Kokan Shiren also studied under Issan. Shiren was also a historian who wrote the Buddhist history &quot;Genkō shakusho&quot;. Ikkyū Sōjun (1394-1481) was a poet who influenced many Japanese work in Zen Buddhism although there is little evidence of his own wakas, and was influenced by Issan.

The Royal court and elite families of the capital also studied the classic Chinese arts that were being taught in the five mountain Rinzai temples. The shogunal families even built Zen temples in their residential palaces. The five mountain temples also established their own printing program (&quot;Gozan-ban&quot;) to copy and disseminate a wide variety of literature that included records of Zen masters, the writings of Tang poets, Confucian classics, Chinese dictionaries, reference works, and medical texts. 

It is also during this period that true lineages of &quot;Shintō&quot; kami worship begin to develop in Buddhist temples complexes, lineages which would become the basis for institutionalized Shintō of later periods. Buddhists continued to develop theories about the relationship between kami and the Buddhas and bodhisattvas. One such idea, &quot;gongen&quot; (&quot;provisional manifestation&quot;)&quot;,&quot; promoted the worship of kami as manifest forms of the Buddhas. A group of Tendai monks at Mt. Hiei meanwhile incorporated &quot;hongaku&quot; thought into their worship of the kami Sannō, which eventually came to be seen as the source or &quot;original ground&quot; (&quot;honji&quot;) of all Buddhas (thereby reversing the old &quot;honji suijaku&quot; theory which saw the Buddha as the &quot;honji&quot;). This idea can be found in the work of the Hiei monk Sonshun (1451–1514).

==== Late Muromachi-Period Buddhism (1467–1603) - Ōnin War====
Beginning with the devastating Ōnin War (1467–1477), the late Muromachi period saw the devolution of central government control and the rise of regional samurai warlords called &quot;daimyōs&quot; and the so called &quot;warring states era&quot; (&quot;Sengokuki&quot;). During this era of widespread warfare, many Buddhist temples and monasteries were destroyed, particularly in and around Kyoto. Many of these old temples would not be rebuilt until the 16th and 17th centuries.

During this period, the new Kamakura schools rose to a new level of prominence and influence. They also underwent reforms in study and practice which would make them more independent and would last centuries. For example, it was during this period that the True Pure Land monk Rennyo (1415–1499) forged a large following for his school and rebuilt Honganji. He reformed devotional practices with a focus on Shinran and honzon scrolls inscribed with the nembutsu. He also made widespread use of the Japanese vernacular.

The Zen lineages were also widely disseminated throughout the country during this era. A key contributing factor to their spread (as well as to the spread of Pure Land temples) was their activity in funerals and mortuary rituals. Some temple halls were reconstructed with a focus on mortuary rites (sometimes for a specific family, like the Tokugawa) and were thus known as mortuary temples (&quot;bodaiji&quot;). Furthermore, during this era, schools like Soto Zen, the Hokke (Nichiren) schools and Rennyo&#x27;s Pure land school also developed comprehensive curricula for doctrinal study, which allowed them to become more self sufficient and independent schools and eliminated the need for their monks to study with other schools.

There was also a decrease in the ritual schedule of the royal court. Because of this, Buddhist Temples which did survive this period had to turn to new ways of fundraising. Aside from mortuary duties, this also included increasing public viewings (&quot;kaichōs&quot;) of hidden or esoteric images.


This era also saw the rise of militant Buddhist leagues (&quot;ikki&quot;), like the Ikko Ikki (&quot;Single Minded&quot; Pure Land Leagues) and Hokke-ikki (Nichirenist &quot;Lotus&quot; Leagues), who rose in revolt against samurai lords and established self-rule in certain regions. These leagues would also sometimes go to war with each other and with major temples. The Hokke-ikki managed to destroy the Ikko Ikki&#x27;s Yamashina Honganji temple complex and take over much of Kyoto in the 1530s. They eventually came into conflict with the Tendai warrior monks of Enryakuji in what became known as the Tenbun Period War, in which all 21 major Hokke (Nichiren) temples were destroyed, along with much of Kyoto.

The Tendai warrior monks and the Ikko Ikki leagues remained a major political power in Japan until their defeat at the hands of Oda Nobunaga (1534–1582), who subjugated both the Tendai monks at Mt Hiei and then the Ikko Ikki, in the Ishiyama Honganji War (1570–1580) .

During the mid-sixteenth century westerners first began to arrive in Japan, introducing new technologies, as well as Christianity. This led to numerous debates between Christians and Buddhists, such as the so-called &quot;Yamaguchi sectarian debates&quot; (&quot;yamaguchi no shūron&quot;).

=== Edo (Tokugawa)-Period (1603–1868) ===
After the Sengoku period of war, Japan was re-united by the Tokugawa Shogunate (1600–1868) who ran the country through a feudal system of regional &quot;daimyō&quot;. The Tokugawa also banned most foreigners from entering the country. The only traders to be allowed were the Dutch at the island of Dejima.

During the seventeenth century, the Tokugawa shōgun Iemitsu set into motion a series of reforms which sought to increase state control of religion (as well as to eliminate Christianity). Iemitsu&#x27;s reforms developed what has been called the head–branch system (&quot;hon-matsu seido&quot;) and the temple affiliation system (&quot;jidan&quot;; alt. &quot;danka seido&quot;). This system made use of already existing Buddhist institutions and affiliations, but attempted to bring them under official government control and required all temples to be affiliated with a government recognized lineage. In general, the Tendai, Pure Land, and Shingon sects were treated more favourably than the True Pure Land and Nichiren sects because the latter had a history of inciting socio-political disturbances in the 16th century.

Buddhist leaders often worked with the government, providing religious support for their rule. For example, the Zen monk Takuan Sōhō (1573–1645) suggested that the spirit of Tokugawa Ieyasu, was a kami (divine spirit). He also wrote a book on zen and martial arts (&quot;The Unfettered Mind&quot;) addressed to the samurai. Meanwhile, Suzuki Shōsan would even call the Tokugawa shōgun a &quot;holy king&quot; (&quot;shōō&quot;).

In the Edo period, Buddhist institutions procured funding through various ritual means, such as the sale of talismans, posthumous names and titles, prayer petitions, and medicine. The practice of pilgrimage was also prominent in the Edo Period. Many temples and holy sites like Mt. Kōya, Mt. Konpira and Mt. Ōyama (Sagami Province) hosted Buddhist pilgrims and mountain ascetics throughout the era.

During the 17th century, the Ōbaku lineage of Zen would be introduced by Ingen, a Chinese monk. Ingen had been a member of the Linji school in Ming China. This lineage, which promoted the dual practice of zazen and nembutsu, would be very successful, having over a thousand temples by the mid-18th century.

Meanwhile, a new breed of public preachers was beginning to frequent public spaces and develop new forms of preaching. These include Pure Land monk Sakuden (1554–1642), who is seen as an originator of Rakugo humor and wrote the &quot;Seisuishō&quot; (Laughs to Wake You Up), which is a collection of humorous anecdotes. Other traveling preachers of the era who made use of stories and narratives include the Shingon-Ritsu monk Rentai (1663–1726) and the Pure Land monk Asai Ryōi (d. 1691).

Hakuin Ekaku (1685–1768) laid a strong emphasis on kōan training as the original pedagogical means of his tradition, combining it with a somatic practice by drawing on ideas from Chinese medicine and Daoism. Hakuin also criticized the mixing of Zen and Pure Land. His views became influential in the Meji-period (1868–1912), when his dharma-heirs came to dominate the Japanese Rinzai-school.

During the Edo period, there was an unprecedented growth of print publishing (in part due to the support of the Tokugawa regime), and the creation and sale of printed Buddhist works exploded. The Tendai monk Tenkai, supported by Iemitsu, led the printing of the Buddhist &quot;canon&quot; (&quot;issaikyō,&quot; i.e. &quot;The Tripiṭaka&quot;). Deal &amp; Ruppert (2015) pp. 184–186 Also notable was the publication of an exceptionally high quality reprint of the Ming-era &quot;Tripiṭaka&quot; by Tetsugen Doko, a renowned master of the Ōbaku school. An important part of the publishing boom were books of Buddhist sermons called &quot;kange-bon&quot; or &quot;dangi-bon.&quot;

With the support of the Shogunate, Buddhist scholasticism also thrived during the Edo period, and the major Buddhist schools established new systems of scholastic study in their schools&#x27; seminaries (&quot;danrin&quot;). Examples include the 18 Jōdo school danrin in Kantō, which were patronized by the Tokugawa family, the most prominent being Zōjōji. The True Pure Land lineages established an extensive seminary system which constituted what would eventually become Ryūkoku University. There was also a renaissance of Sanskrit studies in the Shingon school, led by figures such as Jōgon (1639–1702) and Jiun Sonja (1718–1804). Meanwhile, in Sōtō Zen, scholars led by Menzan Zuihō (1683–1769) undertook a major attempt to publish and study the works of Dōgen.

Also during this time there was a widespread movement among many Buddhist sects to return to the proper use of Buddhist precepts. Numerous figures in the Ōbaku, Shingon, Shingon-risshū, Nichiren, Jōdo shū and Soto schools participated in this effort to tighten and reform Buddhist ethical discipline.

===Meiji period (1868–1912)===

After the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the new imperial government adopted a strong anti-Buddhist attitude. A new form of pristine Shinto, shorn of all Buddhist influences, was promoted as the state religion, an official state policy known as &quot;shinbutsu bunri&quot; (separating Buddhism from Shinto), which began with the &quot;Kami and Buddhas Separation Order&quot; (&quot;shinbutsu hanzenrei&quot;) of 1868. The ideologues of this new Shinto sought to return to a pure Japanese spirit, before it was &quot;corrupted&quot; by external influences, mainly Buddhism. They were influenced by national study (&quot;kokugaku&quot;) figures like Motoori Norinaga (1730–1801) and Hirata Atsutane (1776–1843), both of whom strongly criticized Buddhism. The new order dismantled the combined temple-shrine complexes that had existed for centuries. Buddhists priests were no longer able to practice at Shinto shrines and Buddhist artifacts were removed from Shinto shrines.

This sparked a popular and often violent movement to eradicate Buddhism, which was seen as backwards and foreign and associated with the corrupt Shogunate. There had been much pent-up anger among the populace because the Tokugawa &quot;danka&quot; system forced families to affiliate themselves with a Buddhist temple, which included the obligation of monetary donations. Many Buddhist temples abused this system to make money, causing an undue burden on their parishioners.

This religious persecution of Buddhism, known as &quot;haibutsu kishaku (&quot;literally: &quot;abolish Buddhism and destroy Shākyamuni&quot;), saw the destruction and closure of many Buddhist institutions throughout Japan as well as the confiscation of their land, the forced laicization of Buddhist monks and the destruction of Buddhist books and artifacts. In some instances, monks were attacked and killed.

The violence spread to every region of the country. Japanologist Martin Collcutt believes Japanese Buddhism was on the verge of total eradication. It is estimated that 40,000 Buddhist temples were destroyed, and in certain places the percentage of Buddhist temples destroyed reached 80%. The intensity of the destruction depended on the region, and the most violent times of haibutsu kishaku lasted between 1869 and 1871.

The government edict of April 1872 ended the status of the Buddhist precepts as state law and allowed monks to marry, to eat meat and stopped the regulation of tonsure and dress. The result of this law (over the course of about four decades) was that most Buddhist priests in Japan marry and many temples became hereditary holdings within a family.

Anti-Buddhist government policies and religious persecution put many Buddhist institutions on the defensive against those who saw it as the enemy of the Japanese people. This led Japanese Buddhist institutions to re-examine and re-invent the role of Buddhism in a modernizing Japanese state which now supported state Shintō. There were a broad range of reform strategies and movements which aimed at positioning Buddhism as a useful partner to a modernizing Japan. This included clerical reform to tighten discipline as well as reforms concerning doctrine and practice. Some Buddhists sought to modernize Buddhist thought by combining it with Western science and philosophy.

This reformed &quot;new Buddhism&quot; (&quot;shin bukkyō&quot;) was often promoted by laypersons, such as Sakaino Kōyō (1871–1933) and Takashima Beihō (1875–1949) who founded the Shin Bukkyōto Dōshikai (New Buddhist Friends&#x27; Association) in 1899 and promoted social justice activities. The New Buddhists often joined Japanese nationalist patriotism with Buddhist virtues. Some new Buddhist organizations fully embraced Japanese nationalism, such as the &quot;Kokuchūkai&quot; (Pillar of the Nation Society) of Tanaka Chigaku (1861–1939), who promoted Japanese Imperialism as a way to spread the message of the Lotus Sutra. Another new Buddhist society was the &quot;Keii-kai&quot; (Woof and Warp Society, founded in 1894), which was critical of doctrinal rigidity of traditional Buddhism and championed what they termed &quot;free investigation&quot; (jiyū tōkyū) as a way to respond to the rapid changes of the time.

Kiyozawa Manshi&#x27;s &quot;Seishin-shugi&quot; (Spiritualism) movement promoted the idea that Buddhists should focus on self-cultivation without relying on organized Buddhism or the state. Kiyozawa and his friends lived together in a commune called Kōkōdō (Vast Cavern), and published a journal called &quot;Seishinkai&quot; (Spiritual World). Other Buddhists focused on adherence to the ten precepts, such as Shaku Unshō who created formed a lay organization known as the &quot;Jūzen-kai&quot; (Association for the Ten Precepts).

An influential figure of Buddhist reform during this period was the philosopher Inoue Enryō (1858–1919). A graduate of Tokyo Imperial University, he is known for his critique of Christianity as well as for his ideas on reforming Buddhist institutions. He sought to interpret Buddhist thought through a more rational lens and drew on Western philosophy as well as the teachings of the historical Buddha to do so. He was a prolific author of around 120 books, including &quot;Shinri kinshin&quot; (The Guiding Principle of Truth) and &quot;Bukkyō katsu ron&quot; (Enlivening Buddhism). In 1904 he inaugurated the Tetsugaku-dō (Hall of Philosophy), which was dedicated to Shakyamuni, Confucius, Socrates, and Kant. He also advocated for social welfare activities.

It was also during the Meiji era that Japanese Buddhist studies as an academic field began. This was sparked by the overseas travel of Japanese scholars to Western universities and encountered Buddhist textual studies there, particularly the study of Indian Buddhism and its languages (Sanskrit and Pali). This led to some Japanese Buddhists to question the orthodoxy of Japanese Buddhist traditions. However, the Japanese government at this time was hesitant to give Buddhism any significant influence over public education, and as a result Buddhist studies was classed under &quot;philosophy&quot; rather than &quot;religion&quot;, and terms such as &quot;Indian studies&quot; was favoured over &quot;Buddhist studies.&quot;

One of the first such Japanese academics was Nanjō Bunyū (1849–1927), who studied Sanskrit at Oxford with Max Müller and later took a position at Tokyo Imperial University. Meanwhile, Murakami Senshō (1851–1929) focused on the study of Sanskrit and Pali texts and the history of Buddhism. He focused on the universal values of world Buddhism and wrote critically regarding the historical bias of Japanese Buddhism in works such as &quot;Daijō bussetsu ron hihan&quot; (A Critique of the Theory that Mahayana Is the Direct Teaching of the Historical Buddha, 1903).

There were also a number of new Buddhist movements that grew popular in the Meiji period through 1945. Some of the most influential of these were the Nichirenist/Lotus movements of Sōka Gakkai, Reiyūkai, and Risshō Kōseikai. They focused on active proselytization and worldly personal benefits.

===War time Buddhism (1931–1945)===

During the &quot;fifteen year war&quot; (beginning with the invasion of Manchuria in 1931 and ending with the surrender of Japan in 1945), most Japanese Buddhist institutions supported militarization of Japan.

Japanese Buddhist support for imperialism and militarism was rooted in the Meiji era need for Buddhists to show that they were good citizens that were relevant to Japan&#x27;s efforts to modernize and become a major power. Some Buddhists, like Tanaka Chigaku, saw the war as a way to spread Buddhism. During the Russo-Japanese War, Buddhist leaders supported the war effort in different ways, such as by providing chaplains to the army, performing rituals to secure victory and working with the families of fallen soldiers. During the fifteen-year war, Japanese Buddhists supported the war effort in similar ways, and Buddhist priests became attached to Imperial army regiments.

The Myōwakai (Society for Light and Peace), a transsectarian Buddhist organization, was a strong supporter of the war effort who promoted the idea of &quot;benevolent forcefulness&quot; which held that &quot;war conducted for a good reason is in accord with the great benevolence and compassion of Buddhism.&quot; Another right-wing Buddhist organization during the war was Nisshō Inoue&#x27;s terrorist organization &quot;league of blood&quot; (&quot;ketsumeidan&quot;), which attempted to carry out a series of assassinations, culminating in the assassination of Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi, an event known as the &quot;May 15 Incident&quot;.

During the war, the Japanese government sought to further tighten its control over Buddhist institutions. They attempted to force Buddhist schools to remove from their doctrines any language or idea that revealed anything less than full allegiance to the emperor or that diminished the significance of Shintō kami. This included parts of the writings of medieval Buddhist founders like Shinran and Nichiren who had written that it is sometimes good to criticize rulers if they go against the Dharma.

Buddhists were also forced to venerate talismans from the Isse Shrine, and there were serious consequences for those who refused. For example, during the 1940s, &quot;leaders of both Honmon Hokkeshu and Sōka Gakkai were imprisoned for their defiance of wartime government religious policy, which mandated display of reverence for state Shinto.&quot; A few individuals who directly opposed war were targeted by the government. These include the Rinzai priest Ichikawa Hakugen, and Itō Shōshin (1876–1963), a former Jōdo Shinshū priest.

=== Since 1945 ===
At the end of the World War II, Japan was devastated by the allied bombing campaigns, with most cities in ruins. The occupation government abolished state Shinto, establishing freedom of religion and a separation of religion and state which became an official part of the Japanese constitutional amendment in 1947.

This meant that Buddhist temples and institutions were now free to associate with any religious lineage or to become independent if doctrinal or administrative differences proved too much. One example is when Hōryūji temple became independent from the Hossō lineage and created its own Shōtoku denomination.

The Japanese populace was aware of Buddhist involvement in aiding and promoting the war effort. Because of this, Buddhist lineages have engaged in acts of repentance for their wartime activities. Buddhist groups have been active in the post-war peace movement.

Buddhist temples in post-war Japan experienced difficult times. There was much damage to be repaired and there was little funding for it. In the 1950s, the situation slowly improved, especially for those temples that could harness tourism and other ways of procuring funding. However, post-war land reforms and an increasingly mobile and urban population meant that temples lost both parishioners and land holdings.

In the 1960s, many temples were focused solely on providing services like funerals and burials. In 1963, Tamamuro Taijō coined the term sōshiki bukkyō (funerary Buddhism), to describe the ritualistic formalism of temple Buddhism in postwar Japan that was often divorced from people&#x27;s spiritual needs. Post-war Japan has seen a decline in traditional temple Buddhism, with roughly 100 Buddhist organizations disappearing every year. Still, around 90% of Japanese funerals are conducted according to Buddhist rites.
During the post-war period, in contrast to traditional temple Buddhism, Buddhist based Japanese new religions grew rapidly, especially the Nichiren/Lotus Sūtra based movements like Sōka Gakkai and Risshō Kōseikai (which are today the largest lay Buddhist organizations in Japan). Soka Gakkai &quot;... grew rapidly in the chaos of post war Japan from about 3000 members in 1951 to over 8 million members&quot; in 2000, and has established schools, colleges and a university, as well as cultural institutions.

A study about the reason for the growth in lay believers and increased engagement in society attributes the cause to Nichiren teachings of &#x27;social responsibility&#x27;: &quot;In the tradition of Nichiren Buddhism, however, we find the Lotus Sutra linked to a view of social responsibility that is distinctive&quot;. According to an academic study, lay believers of Buddhism &quot;...offer an alternative view of Japan where their form of Buddhism would form the religious foundation of a peaceful and psychologically and materially enriched society&quot;.

In the 1970s, during a period of rapid social and economic change, there was a wave of new religious movements that were called &quot;new new religions&quot; (&quot;shin shin shūkyō&quot;). While the new religions tended to be Nichiren focused, the &quot;new new&quot; Buddhist religions tend to be influenced by numerous other Buddhist traditions. Buddhist new new religions include the Agon shū (Āgama School), Gedatsukai (Enlightenment Society, drawing from Shingon and Shinto), and Shinnyoen (Garden of True Thusness, a Shingon-based religion). Aum Shinrikyō, the most notorious of these new new religions, is a dangerous cult responsible for the Tokyo gas attack.

The post-war era also saw a new philosophical movements among Buddhist intellectuals called the Kyoto school, since it was led by a group of Kyoto University professors, mainly Nishida Kitarō (1870–1945), Tanabe Hajime (1885–1962), and Nishitani Keiji (1900–1991). These thinkers drew from Western philosophers like Kant, Hegel and Nietzsche and Buddhist thought to express a new perspective. Another intellectual field that has attracted interest is Critical Buddhism (&quot;hihan bukkyō&quot;), associated with Sōtō Zen priests like Hakamaya Noriaki (b. 1943) and Matsumoto Shirō (b. 1950), who criticized certain key ideas in Japanese Mahayana (mainly Buddha nature and original enlightenment) as being incompatible with the Buddha&#x27;s not-self doctrine. Critical Buddhists have also examined the moral failings of Japanese Buddhism, such as support for nationalist violence and social discrimination.

==Schools==
Japanese Buddhism is very diverse with numerous independent schools and temple lineages (including the &quot;old&quot; Nara schools and the &quot;new&quot; Kamakura schools) that can be traced back to ancient and medieval Japan, as well as more recent Japanese New Religious movements and modern lay organizations.

According to the religious statistics of 2023 by the Agency for Cultural Affairs of Japan, the religious corporation under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology in Japan had 129 million believers, of which 46 million were Buddhists and most of them were believers of new schools of Buddhism which were established in the Kamakura period (1185－1333). The number of believers of each sect is approximately 22 million for Pure Land Buddhism, 10 million for Nichiren Buddhism, 5.4 million for Shingon Buddhism, 5.2 million for Zen Buddhism, 2.8 million for Tendai Buddhism, and only about 700,000 for the old schools, which were established in the Nara period (710－794).

An old saying regarding the schools of Buddhism in relation to the different classes is:
=== Nara Buddhism ===


The Six Nara Schools are the oldest Buddhist schools in Japan. These schools came to Japan from Korea and China during the late 6th and early 7th centuries. They are associated with the ancient capital of Heijō-kyō (present-day Nara), where they founded the famed &quot;seven great temples of the southern capital&quot; (&quot;Nanto Shichi Daiji&quot; 南都七大寺).

* , introduced to Japan around 736 by the Indian monk Bodhisena. The school focused on the &quot;Avatamsaka Sutra&quot;, a compilation of numerous sutras, as well as on the works of Huayan patriarchs on the interpenetration of all phenomena (or &#x27;dharmas&#x27; in the specifically Buddhist sense).
* , introduced to Japan in 654 by Japanese monk Dōshō, who had travelled to China to study under Xuanzang. The school focused on the &quot;Yogācāra&quot; philosophy of Asanga and Vasubandhu on mastering the consciousness and mind.
* , introduced to Japan around 625 by the Goguryeo monk Hyegwan. The school focused on the &quot;Mādhyamaka&quot; philosophy of Nāgārjuna and Āryadeva on the emptiness of all phenomenon.
* , introduced to Japan around 753 by the Chinese monk Jianzhen. The school focused on the &quot;Dharmaguptaka&quot; translation of the &quot;Vinaya&quot; and on strict adherece to &quot;Pratimokṣa&quot; monastic rules.
* , introduced to Japan around 625 by the Goguryeo monk Ekwan. The school focused on the &quot;Satyasiddhi-Śāstra&quot;, a text of Abhidharma by the philosopher Harivarman. It was never a truly independent school, instead it was studied along with Sanron doctrine.
* , a Sarvāstivāda school focused on the &quot;Abhidharmakośabhaṣya&quot;, a text of Abhidharma by the philosopher Vasubandhu. It was never a truly independent school, instead it was studied along with Hossō doctrine.

=== Heian Buddhism ===

Eventually, the increasing power of Six Nara Schools and their influence in politics started to overwhelm the city of Nara. This forced Emperor Kanmu to relocate the capital, moving it to Heian-kyō (present-day Kyoto). It also directly encouraged the creation of the Tendai school, founded by Saichō, and the Shingon school, founded by Kūkai.

* is a branch of the Tiantai Buddhism introduced to Japan by Saichō in 805, who also introduced tantric elements into the tradition. The primary text of Tendai Buddhism is the Lotus Sutra, but the is also important. The Lotus Sutra is also central to Tendai esoteric teachings.
* is a branch of the Vajrayana Buddhism introduced to Japan by Kūkai in 816, who traveled to China and studied the Chinese Mantrayana tradition. Shingon is based mainly on two tantric scriptures, the &quot;Mahavairocana Tantra&quot; and the . Dainichi Nyorai is central to Shingon esoteric teachings.

Additionally, this period saw the development of Shugendō, an eclectic tradition which brought together Buddhist and ancient Shinto elements. It was founded by En no Gyōja (役行者, &quot;En the ascetic&quot;).

=== Kamakura Buddhism ===


During the Kamakura period, many Buddhist schools (classified by scholars as &quot;New Buddhism&quot; or &quot;Shin Bukkyo&quot;), as opposed to &quot;Old Buddhism&quot; &quot;(Kyū Bukkyō)&quot;.

* Pure Land Buddhism, which focuses on Nembutsu practice, chanting the name of Amida Buddha, so as to be reborn in the Pure Land.
** The Jōdo-shū founded by Hōnen (1133–1212).
** The Jōdo Shinshū founded by Shinran (1173–1263).
** The Ji-shū founded by Ippen (1239–1289).
** The Yūzū-Nembutsu-shū founded by Ryōnin (1072–1132).
* Zen Buddhism, originating from Chinese Chan Buddhism, focuses on Zazen meditation.
** The Rinzai Zen founded by Eisai (1141–1215), a Japanese line of the Chinese Linji school, emphasizes Kōan practice.
** The Sōtō Zen founded by Dōgen (1200–1253), a Japanese line of the Chinese Caodong school, emphasizes Shikantaza practice.
** The Ōbaku Zen introduced by Ingen in 1654, incorporates elements of Nembutsu practice.
* Nichiren Buddhism, founded by Nichiren (1222–1282) which focuses on the Lotus Sutra and Odaimoku practice, chanting the name of the Lotus Sutra.
** The Nichiren-shū, venerates and reveres the Shakyamuni Buddha of the Essential Teachings.
** The Nichiren Shōshū, venerates and reveres the Dai Gohonzon of the High Sanctuary of the Essential Teachings.

=== New religious movements ===
There are various Japanese new religious movements which can be considered Buddhist sects, the largest of these are lay Nichiren Buddhist groups such as Soka Gakkai, Reiyūkai, Risshō Kōsei-kai and lay Zen Buddhist groups such as Sanbo Kyodan and FAS Society. But there are other new movements such as Agon Shū (阿含宗, &quot;Agama School&quot;), a Buddhist school which focuses on studying the &quot;Agamas&quot;, a collection of early Buddhist scriptures.

==Cultural influence==

===Societal influence===
During the Kamakura (1185–1333) and Muromachi (1336–1573) periods, Buddhism and Buddhist institutions had a great influence on Japanese society. Buddhist institutions were used by the shogunate to control the country. During the Edo (1600–1868) this power was constricted, to be followed by persecutions at the beginning of the Meiji era (1868–1912). Buddhist temples played a major administrative role during the Edo period, through the Danka or &quot;terauke&quot; system. In this, Japanese citizens were required to register at their local Buddhist temples and obtain a certification (&quot;terauke&quot;), which became necessary to function in society. At first, this system was put into place to suppress Christianity, but over time it took on the larger role of census and population control.

===Artistic influence===

Japanese Buddhist art started to develop as soon as the country converted to Buddhism in 548. Some tiles from the Asuka period (shown above), the first period following the conversion of the country to Buddhism, display a strikingly classical style, with ample Hellenistic dress and realistically rendered body shape characteristic of Greco-Buddhist art.

Buddhist art became extremely varied in its expression. Many elements of Greco-Buddhist art remain to this day however, such as the Hercules inspiration behind the Nio guardian deities in front of Japanese Buddhist temples, or representations of the Buddha reminiscent of Greek art such as the Buddha in Kamakura.

====Deities====
Various other Greco-Buddhist artistic influences can be found in the Japanese Buddhist pantheon, the most striking being that of the Japanese wind god Fūjin. In consistency with Greek iconography for the wind god Boreas, the Japanese wind god holds above his head with his two hands a draping or &quot;wind bag&quot; in the same general attitude. The abundance of hair has been kept in the Japanese rendering, as well as exaggerated facial features.

Another Buddhist deity, Shukongōshin, one of the wrath-filled protector deities of Buddhist temples in Japan, is also an interesting case of transmission of the image of the famous Greek god Heracles to East Asia along the Silk Road. Heracles was used in Greco-Buddhist art to represent Vajrapani, the protector of the Buddha, and his representation was then used in China and Japan to depict the protector gods of Buddhist temples.

====Artistic motifs====

The artistic inspiration from Greek floral scrolls is found quite literally in the decoration of Japanese roof tiles, one of the only remaining element of wooden architecture throughout centuries. The clearest ones are from the 7th century Nara temple building tiles, some of them exactly depicting vines and grapes. These motifs have evolved towards more symbolic representations, but essentially remain to this day in many Japanese traditional buildings.

===Architecture and temples===

Soga no Umako built Hōkō-ji, the first temple in Japan, between 588 and 596. It was later renamed as Asuka-dera for Asuka, the name of the capital where it was located. Unlike early Shinto shrines, early Buddhist temples were highly ornamental and strictly symmetrical. The early Heian period (9th–10th century) saw an evolution of style based on the mikkyō sects Tendai and Shingon Buddhism. The Daibutsuyō style and the Zenshūyō style emerged in the late 12th or early 13th century.

==Holidays==
The following Japanese Buddhist holidays are celebrated by most, if not all, major Buddhist traditions:

* Jan. 1st – Japanese New Year (&quot;Shōgatsu&quot;).
* Feb. 15th – Nirvana Day (&quot;Nehan-e&quot;). The day at the Buddha was said to have passed away into Parinirvana (his final vanishing).
* Mar. 20th – &quot;Higan-e&quot;, the Spring Equinox celebration.
* Apr. 8th – Buddha&#x27;s Birthday &quot;(Hanamatsuri&quot;), i.e. Kanbutsu-e (潅仏会) or &quot;Busshō-e&quot; (仏生会).
* July – Aug. – &quot;Obon Festival,&quot; a festival to honor the spirits of one&#x27;s ancestors.
* Sept. 21st, approximately – &quot;Higan-e&quot;, the Autumnal Equinox celebration.
* Dec. 8th – Bodhi Day (&quot;Shaka-Jōdō-e&quot; or just &quot;Jōdō-e&quot;), this celebrated the awakening of the Buddha
* Dec. 31st – &quot;Jōya-e&quot; or &quot;Sechibun-E&quot;, the end of the year celebration.

Some holidays are specific to certain schools or traditions. For example, Zen Buddhist traditions celebrate &quot;Daruma-ki&quot; on October 15 to commemorate the life of Bodhidharma.

==Demographics==
According to estimates by the Japanese Government&#x27;s Agency for Cultural Affairs, , Buddhism was the predominant religion in Japan with about 84 million adherents or about 69% of the Japanese population, while Shinto had the second most, though a large number of people practice elements of both. According to statistics by the Agency for Cultural Affairs in 2023, the religious corporation under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology in Japan had 129 million believers, of which 46 million were Buddhists. Most of them were believers of new schools of Buddhism which were established in the Kamakura period (1185－1333). According to these statistics, the largest sects of Japanese Buddhism are the Jōdo Buddhists with 22 million believers, followed by the Nichiren Buddhists with 10 million believers. 

There are a wide range of estimates; the Pew Research Center estimated 36.2% of the population in 2010 practiced Buddhism. The Japanese General Social Survey placed the figure at less than 20% of the population in 2017. The 2013 Japanese National Character Survey showed that roughly 70% of the population do not adhere to any religious beliefs. Another survey indicates that about 60% of Japanese families have a butsudan (Buddhist shrine) in their homes. According to a 2012 Pew Research study, Japan has the third largest Buddhist population in the world, after China and Thailand.

<doc id="297223" wikidata="Q925090" url="?curid=297223" title="Buddhism in the West">
<text>Buddhism in the West (or more narrowly Western Buddhism) broadly encompasses the knowledge and practice of Buddhism outside of Asia, in the Western world. Occasional intersections between Western civilization and the Buddhist world have been occurring for thousands of years. Greek colonies existed in India during the Buddha&#x27;s life, as early as the 6th century. The first Westerners to become Buddhists were Greeks who settled in Bactria and India during the Hellenistic period. They became influential figures during the reigns of the Indo-Greek kings, whose patronage of Buddhism led to the emergence of Greco-Buddhism and Greco-Buddhist art. 

There was little contact between the Western and Asian cultures during most of the Middle Ages, but the early modern rise of global trade and mercantilism, improved navigation technology and the European colonization of Asian Buddhist countries led to increased knowledge of Buddhism among Westerners. This increased contact led to various responses from Buddhists and Westerners throughout the modern era. These include religious proselytism, religious polemics and debates (such as the Sri Lankan Panadura debate), Buddhist modernism, Western convert Buddhists and the rise of Buddhist studies in Western academia. 

During the 20th century, there was growth in Western Buddhism due to various factors such as immigration, globalization, the decline of Christianity and increased interest among Westerners. The various schools of Buddhism are now established in all major Western countries making up a small minority in the United States (1% in 2017), Europe (0.2% in 2010), as well as in Australia (2.4% in 2016) and New Zealand (1.5% in 2013).

==Premodern history==
===Greco-Buddhism===


The first contact between Western culture and Buddhist culture occurred during Alexander the Great&#x27;s conquest of India.

After Alexander&#x27;s conquest, Greek colonists established cities and kingdoms in Bactria and India where Buddhism was thriving. This cultural interaction saw the emergence of Greco-Buddhism and Greco-Buddhist art, especially within the Gandharan civilization which covered a large part of modern-day northern Pakistan and eastern Afghanistan. Greek sculptors in the classical tradition came to teach their skills to Indian sculptors resulting in the distinctive style of Greco-Buddhist art in stone and stucco seen in hundreds of Buddhist monasteries which are still being discovered and excavated in this region.

Greco-Buddhism was an important religion among the Greco-Bactrians and the Indo-Greeks. The Indo-Greek kings such as Menander I (165/155 –130 BCE) and Menander II (90–85 BCE) used Buddhist symbolism in their coins. Menander I is a main character of the Indian Buddhist scripture known as Milinda Panha (&quot;The Questions of King Milinda&quot;), which states that he adopted the Buddhist religion. The Buddhist tradition considers Menander as a great benefactor of the Dharma, along with Ashoka.

The &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; mentions that during Menander&#x27;s reign, a Greek elder monk named Mahadharmaraksita led 30,000 Buddhist monks from &quot;the Greek city of Alexandria&quot; (possibly Alexandria on the Caucasus) to Sri Lanka for the dedication of a stupa showing that Greeks took an active part in Indian Buddhism during this period.

Greco-Buddhist styles continued to be influential during the Kushan empire.

===Pyrrhonism===
Alexander the Great&#x27;s court on his conquest of India included the philosopher Pyrrho who created his philosophy, Pyrrhonism, with influence from the Buddhist three marks of existence.

The Pyrrhonists promote suspending judgment (epoché) about dogma (beliefs about non-evident matters) as the way to reach ataraxia, a soteriological objective similar to nirvana. This is similar to the practices described in the Aṭṭhakavagga, one of the oldest Buddhist texts, and it is similar to the Buddha&#x27;s refusal to answer certain metaphysical questions which he saw as non-conductive to the path of Buddhist practice and Nagarjuna&#x27;s &quot;relinquishing of all views (drsti)&quot;.

Later Pyrrhonism substantially parallels the teachings of Madhyamaka Buddhism, particularly the surviving works of Sextus Empiricus, Thomas McEvilley and Matthew Neale suspect that Nāgārjuna was influenced by Greek Pyrrhonist texts imported into India.

===Buddhism and the Roman world===
Several instances of interactions between Buddhism and the Roman Empire are documented by Classical and early Christian writers. Roman historical accounts describe an embassy sent by the Indian king Pandion, also known as Porus, to Augustus around 13 CE. The embassy was travelling with a diplomatic letter in Greek, and one of its members—called Zarmanochegas—was an Indian religious man (sramana) who burned himself alive in Athens to demonstrate his faith. The event created a sensation and was described by Nicolaus of Damascus, who met the embassy at Antioch, and related by Strabo (XV,1,73) and Dio Cassius. These accounts at least indicate that religious men from India (Sramanas, to which the Buddhists belonged, as opposed to Hindu Brahmanas) were visiting Mediterranean countries. However, the term sramana is a general term for Indian religious man in Jainism, Buddhism, and Ājīvika. It is not clear which of those religious tradition the man belonged to in this case.

Early 3rd–4th century Christian writers such as Hippolytus and Epiphanius write about a figure called Scythianus, who visited India around 50 CE from where he brought &quot;the doctrine of the Two Principles&quot;. According to Cyril of Jerusalem, Scythianus&#x27; pupil Terebinthus presented himself as a &quot;Buddha&quot; (&quot;He called himself Buddas&quot;) and taught in Palestine, Judaea and Babylon.

=== Buddhism and Christianity ===
The influential early Christian church father Clement of Alexandria (died AD 215) mentioned Buddha (Βούττα): Among the Indians are those philosophers also who follow the precepts of &quot;Boutta&quot;, whom they honour as a god on account of his extraordinary sanctity. The myth of the birth of the Buddha was also known: a fragment of Archelaos of Carrha (278 AD) mentions the Buddha&#x27;s virgin-birth, and Saint Jerome (4th century) mentions the birth of the Buddha, who he says &quot;was born from the side of a virgin&quot;.

The legend of Christian saints Barlaam and Josaphat draws on the life of the Buddha.

In the 13th century, international travelers, such as Giovanni de Piano Carpini and William of Ruysbroeck, sent back reports of Buddhism to the West and noted some similarities with Nestorian Christian communities. The famous travel writer Marco Polo (1254–1324) wrote much about Buddhism, its rites and customs, in places such as Khotan, China and Sri Lanka.

== Early modern and colonial encounters ==
When European Christians made more direct contact with Buddhism in the early 16th century, Jesuit missionaries to Asia such as St. Francis Xavier and Ippolito Desideri sent back detailed accounts of Buddhist doctrine and practices. Ippolito Desideri spent a long time in Tibet, learning the Tibetan language and Tibetan Buddhist doctrine before writing an account of his travels and of Tibetan Buddhism. He also wrote several books in Tibetan which promoted Christianity and critiqued Buddhism. Other influential Jesuit writers on Buddhism Alessandro Valignano (1539–1606) and Matteo Ricci (1552–1610). The Portuguese colonial efforts in Sri Lanka during the 16th and 17th centuries saw some of the first large scale direct contact between Buddhists and Westerners. According to Stephen Berkwitz, by the late 17th century, &quot;the existence of a religion across Asia that worshiped images of the Buddha, known and referred to by many different names, was a well-known fact among European scholars.&quot;

This recognition that Buddhism was indeed a distinct Asian religion with its own texts and not just a form of local paganism, led Catholic missionaries to see Buddhism as a serious rival to Christianity in Asia and to promote its further study so as to combat it. They also sought to explain how such a religion could exist which appeared to deviate from those originating from divine revelation and yet also contained numerous similarities (monastic orders, virgin birth of its founder, belief in heaven and hell, etc.). Because of this, many Portuguese writers explained the Buddhist religion as a form of Christianity corrupted by the devil and some even said Buddhists were &quot;in league with the devil&quot;. Catholic missionaries in Asia especially criticized the Buddhist view of rebirth, &quot;idol worship&quot; and denial of the immortality of the soul or a first cause.

With the arrival of Sanskrit and Oriental studies in European universities in the late 18th century, and the subsequent availability of Buddhist texts, Western Buddhist studies began to take shape. An important early figure is Paulinus a Sancto Bartholomaeo who first remarked on the connection between Sanskrit and Pali, and described an early Italian translation of the &quot;Kammavaca&quot; in his &quot;Systema brahmanicum.&quot;

== 19th century ==

During the 19th century, Buddhism (along with other non-European religions and philosophies) came to the attention of Western intellectuals through the work of Christian missionaries, scholars, and imperial civil servants who wrote about the countries in which they worked. Most accounts of Buddhism placed it in a negative light however, as a nihilistic, pessimistic, idolatrous and heathen faith. Jules Barthélemy-Saint-Hilaire for example, described Buddhism as the nihilistic nadir of Indian pessimism.

One early and influential sympathetic account was Sir Edwin Arnold&#x27;s book-length poem &quot;The Light of Asia &quot;(1879), a life of the Buddha which became an influential best-seller. The book, coming at a time when Christianity was being challenged by critical Biblical scholarship and Darwinism, was seen by some Western intellectuals as promoting a more rational alternative to Christianity. This book eventually went through eighty editions and sold between half a million to a million copies.

The growth of Spiritualism and Theosophy also contributed to the rise of interest in Buddhism. Some Theosophists actually converted to Buddhism, such as Helena Blavatsky and Henry Steel Olcott who according to Stephen Prothero were &quot;the first European-Americans to publicly and formally become lay Buddhists&quot; in 1880. Olcott became a very influential figure in the Sinhalese Buddhist revival and in promoting the rise of a modernist Buddhism. He founded various branches of the Buddhist Theosophical Society in his first visit to Sri Lanka and wrote Buddhist educational literature. Seeing himself as an educator who was attempting to help the Sinhalese understand &quot;real&quot; Buddhism (based on a rational academic study of the Pali texts, not on &quot;debased, sectarian, and creedal&quot; local forms), he wrote an influential introduction to Buddhism called the &quot;Buddhist Catechism&quot; (1881), which proved extremely popular and remains in use today. While Olcott&#x27;s Buddhism was influenced by liberal Protestantism as well as Theosophical ideas, Sinhalese Buddhists such as the famous Hikkaduve Sumangala supported his efforts and he became very popular in the island.

The writings of Lafcadio Hearn were also influential in introducing Japanese Buddhism to Western audiences.

=== In Europe ===

The 19th century also saw the growth of the first thorough academic studies, publications and translations of Buddhist texts. The work of the French orientalist Eugène Burnouf is some of the first academic work on Buddhism which includes a French translation of the Lotus sutra from Sanskrit. He laid the foundation for the study of Sanskrit Buddhist texts. He and Christian Lassen also published an early Pali grammar in 1826. Benjamin Clough, a Wesleyan missionary, also published an early grammar of the language in Colombo, 1924, &quot;A compendious Pali grammar with a copious vocabulary in the same language&quot;. The first Pali dictionary was published in 1875, Robert Caesar Childers&#x27; &quot;A Dictionary of the Pali language&quot;. The work of Emile Senart is also important, and includes a publication and study of the Sanskrit Mahavastu as well as his , which interpreted the Buddha as a solar deity figure.

1881 was a seminal year for the new field now known as Buddhist studies. The Pali Text Society was founded in 1881 by Thomas William Rhys Davids, who was an influential early translator of the Buddhist Pali Canon. Another influential scholar in the field was the Indologist Max Müller, who edited Buddhist texts which were published in the Oxford series known as &quot;Sacred Books of the East.&quot; In 1881, Volume 10 included the first translations of the Dhammapada (Müller) and the Sutta-Nipata (Viggo Fausböll). Hermann Oldenberg&#x27;s 1881 study on Buddhism, entitled &quot;Buddha: his life, his doctrine, his order&quot; (), based on Pāli texts was also an early influential work which critiqued the solar myth theory.

This era also saw Western philosophers taking note of Buddhism. These included the influential German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, who read about Buddhism and other Indian religions, and praised their way of life in his works as the highest ideal. Schopenhauer later claimed that Buddhism was the &quot;best of all possible religions.&quot; Schopenhauer&#x27;s view of human suffering as arising from striving or Will and his compassion-based ethics have been compared to Buddhism. Religion scholars specialized in the academic study of Western esotericism recognize that Theravada Buddhism had been influential on the philosophical and religious thought of the English occultist and ceremonial magician Aleister Crowley, although he eventually distanced himself from Theravada Buddhist teachings and founded his own religion.

There are frequent mentions of Buddhism in the work of the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, who praised Buddhism in his 1895 work &quot;The Anti-Christ&quot;, calling it &quot;a hundred times more realistic than Christianity&quot; because it is atheistic, phenomenalistic, and anti-metaphysical. Nietzsche wrote that &quot;Buddhism already has—and this distinguishes it profoundly from Christianity—the self-deception of moral concepts behind it—it stands, in my language, Beyond Good and Evil.&quot; However, he also saw Buddhism as a kind of life-denying nihilistic religion. Thus, even though Nietzsche saw himself as undertaking a similar project to the Buddha, writing in 1883, &quot;I could become the Buddha of Europe&quot;; he saw himself as consciously anti-Buddhist, further writing &quot;though frankly I would be the antipode of the Indian Buddha.&quot; Robert Morrison believes that there is &quot;a deep resonance between them&quot; as &quot;both emphasise the centrality of humans in a godless cosmos and neither looks to any external being or power for their respective solutions to the problem of existence&quot;.

=== In North America ===
The first Buddhists to arrive in North America were Chinese immigrants to the West Coast in the 1848 Gold Rush. By 1875 there were 8 temples in San Francisco and many more smaller ones along the West Coast. They practiced a mixture of &quot;Confucian ancestor veneration, popular Taoism, and Pure Land Buddhism.&quot; At about the same time, immigrants from Japan began to arrive as laborers on Hawaiian plantations and central-California farms. In 1893 the first Jōdo Shinshū priests arrived in San Francisco, and they formally established the Buddhist Missions of North America, later renamed the Buddhist Churches of America in 1899. The BCA is the oldest major institutional form of Buddhism in the United States. This organization acted as way for immigrants to preserve their Japanese culture and language, as well as their religion.

Asian immigrants also arrived in British Columbia, Canada during the 1850s (to work as miners), and the old immigrant population was bolstered by new influx of Asian migrants after the 1962 Immigration Act and also as a result of the arrival of refugees from Indochina. Mining work also led Chinese immigrants to Australia (in 1848) and New Zealand (1863). American Transcendentalist thinkers were interested in Eastern religions, including Buddhism, though they were never converts. Ralph Waldo Emerson regarded Hinduism and Buddhism as anticipations of an ideal Transcendentalism. Meanwhile, Henry David Thoreau translated the Lotus Sutra from French into English. 
An important event in the history of Western Buddhism was the 1893 World Parliament of Religions in Chicago organized by John Henry Barrows and Paul Carus. The Japanese delegation included the priest Soyen Shaku, the layman Zenshiro Nogushi, four priests and two laymen, representing the Rinzai Zen, Jodo Shinshu, Nichiren, Tendai, and Shingon schools of Japanese Buddhism. The Sri Lankan Anagarika Dharmapala was also present and gave a speech promoting Buddhism. He spoke English with a passion which stirred the audience and drew much attention. He would later come back to the United States for a speaking tour across the nation at the behest of Paul Carus, professor of philosophy, and officiated the first Vesak celebration in San Francisco (1897). On his third visit to North America, he attended a lecture by William James, who gave up his spot to Dharmapala. After Dharmapala finished speaking on Buddhist psychology, James is recorded to have said &quot;this is the psychology everybody will be studying twenty-five years from now.&quot;

In 1897, the Japanese Zen philosopher D. T. Suzuki came to the United States to work and study with Paul Carus. Suzuki was the single-most important person in popularizing Zen Buddhism in the West. However, his philosophical thought and understanding of Buddhism were also influenced by Western esoteric traditions such as Theosophy and Swedenborgianism. Suzuki&#x27;s writings had a strong impact on Western thinkers and intellectuals such as psychologists Erich Fromm and Karen Horney, poets like Alan Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac, as well as on other figures like Alan Watts and Edward Conze. Through his writings, Suzuki contributed to the emergence of a Zen modernism which blends Asian Buddhism with Transcendentalism and Romanticism.

=== Buddhist modernism ===
The works of the early important figures in Western Buddhism such as Henry Olcott, Paul Carus and Soyen Shaku promoted a kind of Buddhism that has been called by contemporary scholars &quot;Buddhist modernism&quot; and also &quot;protestant Buddhism.&quot; This new Buddhist discourse included various elements, but especially important was the idea that Buddhism was compatible with modern science and enlightenment rationalism. Olcott&#x27;s Buddhist catechism is one example, which has a section devoted to Buddhism and science, which promotes the theory of evolution and affirms that Buddhism is based on the consistent operations of causality. He also argues that Buddhists are &quot;earnestly enjoined to accept nothing on faith&quot; and are required to believe only that which is &quot;corroborated by our own reason and consciousness.&quot; Paul Carus&#x27; encounter with Buddhism led him to believe that it was a great example of a &quot;Religion of Science&quot; and he became an enthusiastic supporter of it because he believed that it was the religion that &quot;recognizes no other revelation except the truth that can be proved by science&quot;. His influential work, &quot;The Gospel of Buddhism,&quot; became quite popular and was translated in various languages. This kind of modernism was also promoted by Asian Buddhists in Asian countries, such as Anagarika Dharmapala.

The rational interpretation of Buddhism as the &quot;religion of reason&quot; was also promoted by early Buddhist societies in Europe, such as the Society for the Buddhist Mission in Leipzig, Germany, founded in 1903 by the Indologist Karl Seidenstücker (1876 –1936) and the British Buddhist Society, in their journal &quot;The Buddhist Review.&quot;

According to Heinz Bechert, Buddhist modernism includes the following elements: new interpretations of early Buddhist teachings, demythologisation and reinterpretation of Buddhism as &quot;scientific religion&quot;, social philosophy or &quot;philosophy of optimism&quot;, emphasis on equality and democracy, &quot;activism&quot; and social engagement, support of Buddhist nationalism, and the revival of meditation practice.

== Early 20th century ==

The 20th century saw influential Western converts such as the Irish ex-hobo U Dhammaloka and intellectuals such as Bhikkhu Asoka (H. Gordon Douglas), and Ananda Metteyya. U Dhammaloka became a popular traveling Buddhist preacher in Burma in the early 1900s, writing tracts and confronting Christian missionaries. In 1907 he founded the Buddhist Tract Society in Rangoon to distribute pro Buddhist texts as well as other works such as Thomas Paine&#x27;s &quot;Rights of Man&quot; and &quot;Age of Reason.&quot; Another influential figure was Charles Henry Allan Bennett (later Ananda Metteyya), who established the first Buddhist Mission in the United Kingdom, the International Buddhist Society and worked on a periodical called &quot;Buddhism: An Illustrated Review&quot; as well as two books on Buddhism (&quot;The Wisdom of the Aryas&quot; and &quot;The Religion of Burma&quot;). 

Throughout the 20th century, the Pali text society continued to be an influential publisher of Buddhist texts, by 1930 all the five Pali Nikayas had been published by the society (and numerous translations were also published)&quot;.&quot; Buddhist studies also made numerous strides during the 20th century, headed by European academies and seen as comprising three &quot;schools&quot; during this period. Important figures include the scholars of the &quot;Franco-Belgian school&quot;, such as Louis de La Vallée-Poussin and his student Étienne Lamotte, the Pali-based Anglo-German school which included figures such as Wilhelm Geiger and Caroline Rhys Davids and the &quot;Leningrad school&quot; of Fyodor Shcherbatskoy and Sergey Oldenburg.

Various Western converts during this period became influential figures through their Theravada Buddhist translations and writings, including the German monk Nyanatiloka Thera who founded the Island Hermitage in Sri Lanka and translated many important Pali texts into German. His disciple, the elder Nyanaponika, was a co-founder and president of the Buddhist Publication Society and author of the influential book on meditation, &quot;The Heart of Buddhist Meditation.&quot; The English Ñāṇamoli Bhikkhu was another influential author associated with the Island Hermitage, known for his numerous translations of Pali texts into English. In 1954, Nyanatiloka and Nyanaponika were the only two Western-born monks invited to participate in the Sixth Buddhist council in Yangon, Burma. Nyanaponika read out Nyanatiloka&#x27;s message at the opening of the council.

During the 20th century, there was an exponential increase in publications on Buddhism. The first English translation of the &quot;Tibetan Book of the Dead&quot; was published in 1927, by Walter Evans-Wentz. He credited himself as the compiler and editor of these volumes, with translation by Tibetan Buddhists, primarily Lama Kazi Dawa-Samdup. The reprint of 1935 carried a commentary from Carl Jung. The book is said to have attracted many westerners to Tibetan Buddhism. Also published in English in 1927, Alexandra David-Néel&#x27;s &quot;My Journey to Lhasa&quot; helped popularized the modern perception of Tibet and Tibetan Buddhism at large. During the 20th century the German writer Hermann Hesse showed great interest in Eastern religions, writing a popular book entitled &quot;Siddhartha&quot;.

=== In Europe ===

The Buddhist Society, London (originally known as the Buddhist Lodge) was founded by Theosophist and convert to Buddhism Christmas Humphreys in 1924. Anagarika Dharmapala also brought his Maha Bodhi Society to England in 1925.

Some of the earliest European institutions were also founded in Germany. In 1921, Georg Grimm (1868 –1945) joined Karl Seidenstücker in founding the Buddhist Parish for Germany in Munich&quot;.&quot; In 1924, Das Buddhistische Haus, was founded by Paul Dahlke in Berlin. Dahlke had studied Buddhism in Sri Lanka prior to World War I. Meanwhile, in France, Grace Constant Lounsbery founded a Paris-based group called Les amis du Bouddhisme in 1929 who published a journal, &quot;La pensée bouddhique&quot;.

The first Buddhist monastery in Europe was not founded by European converts however, but by Buryat and Kalmyk Buddhists of the Tibetan Gelug school led by Agvan Dorzhiev, who founded a temple in Saint Petersburg in 1909–15, Datsan Gunzechoinei. This temple was desecrated during the Russian revolution however, but survived the second world war and is now active.

=== In North America ===
In the United States, Japanese Americans founded the Bukkyo Seinen Kai, a Young Men&#x27;s Buddhist Association (YMBA) inspired by Christian institutions. This community had to deal with intense anti-Japanese sentiment during WW2 despite formal statements of loyalty issued by the organization. Many Japanese American Buddhists had to hide their family altars. The Japanese internment during the war accelerated Anglicization, because they were required to use English in the camps. There is also a generation gap in this community between the older immigrant generation and the American born Anglicized generation.

=== In Latin America ===
As a result of similar patterns of Asian immigration, globalization and Western conversion, Buddhism also became an established minority religion in Latin America in the 20th century, with adherents mostly common from the educated middle classes. Japanese immigrants arrived in Latin America at the end of the 19th century and throughout the 20th century. With the largest population in Latin America, Brazil is also home to the most Buddhists (around 230,000) in Latin America and thus plays a central administrative and spiritual role for Buddhism in the rest of South America. It was first introduced by Japanese immigrants in 1908. Rev. Tomojiro Ibaragi of the Honmon Butsuryū-shū founded the first official Buddhist institution in the country in 1936, the Taisseji Temple.

== Post-war developments ==

After the Second World War, mainstream Western Buddhisms began to take shape, influenced by new Western writers on Buddhist thought and a new wave of immigration from Asian Buddhist countries. There was a dramatic rate of growth during the late 20th century. &quot;The Complete Guide to Buddhist America&quot; for example, listed more than one thousand meditation centers as of 1997 in comparison to the twenty-one centers founded between 1900 and the early 1960s.

Those Westerners disaffected with the materialistic values of consumer culture and traditional Christianity (such as the beat generation and later the hippies), as well as those interested a more sober altered state of consciousness or psychedelic experience, were drawn to eastern religions like Buddhism during this period (this is known as the &quot;Zen boom&quot;). Influential literary figures include the American writers Jack Kerouac (&quot;The Dharma Bums&quot; and &quot;The Scripture of the Golden Eternity&quot;) and Gary Snyder as well as the British writer Alan Watts (&quot;The Way of Zen&quot;). The steady influx of refugees from Tibet in the 1960s and from Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia in the 1970s led to renewed interest in Buddhism, and the countercultural movements of the 1960s proved fertile ground for its Westward diffusion. Buddhism supposedly promised a more methodical path to happiness than Christianity and a way out of the perceived spiritual bankruptcy and complexity of Western life.

=== East Asian Buddhism ===

An influential figure is the reformer Hakuun Yasutani, who founded his own school called Sanbo Kyodan in 1954. Many of his reforms, while controversial in Japan, became &quot;de rigueur&quot; for Western Zen. These reforms focused on laypersons, who were given teachings and care that was traditionally reserved for monastics, the use of intense lay meditation retreats, and a minimizing of ceremony. Influential students of his are Philip Kapleau, Toni Packer and Robert Aitken. Philip Kapleau founded the Rochester Zen Center in New York in 1965. At this time, there were few if any American citizens that had trained in Japan with ordained Buddhist teachers. Kapleau wrote his seminal work &quot;The Three Pillars of Zen&quot; in 1965, which addressed the actual practice of Zen and the experiences which result. Brigitte D&#x27;Ortschy, also a student of Yasutani, translated &quot;The Three Pillars of Zen&quot; and other Buddhist texts into German and became one of the first Zen teachers in Europe. Robert Aitken, known as the &quot;dean of American Zen&quot;, founded Diamond Sangha in Hawaii in 1959 which has grown into a network of affiliated centers and he also translated numerous Zen texts. He also founded the Buddhist Peace Fellowship along with Beat poet Gary Snyder and Joanna Macy. 

In 1959, a Japanese teacher, Shunryu Suzuki, arrived in San Francisco. At the time of Suzuki&#x27;s arrival, Zen had become a hot topic among some groups in the United States, especially beatniks. Suzuki&#x27;s classes were filled with those wanting to learn more about Buddhism, and the presence of a Zen master inspired the students. Shunryu Suzuki&#x27;s &quot;Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind&quot; (1970), quickly became one of America&#x27;s Buddhist classics. He founded the San Francisco Zen Center during the middle of the 60s counterculture (1962).

In 1969, Jiyu Kennett, the first woman to study at Sōji-ji Temple since the 14th century, founded Shasta Abbey in California and was known for setting traditional Buddhist texts to Gregorian chant. Austrian-born Myokyo-ni trained at the Rinzai Daitoku-ji temple in Japan during the 1960s and went on to become head of the Zen Centre in London. The German Jesuit priest Hugo Enomiya-Lassalle became one of the foremost teachers to embrace Zen alongside Roman Catholic Christianity.

In the 50s and 60s, non-Japanese Brazilians sought out Buddhism influenced partly by translations of the works of DT Suzuki. They went to centers such as the Busshinji Temple of the Soto Zen school in São Paulo and some of them later went on to become popular Zen teachers among Brazilians such as Rosen Takashina Roshi. 

In 1982, the popular Vietnamese Buddhist teacher and peace activist Thích Nhất Hạnh founded the Plum Village Monastery in Dordogne, France which, along with his hundreds of publications, has helped spread interest in Engaged Buddhism and Vietnamese Thiền (Zen).

In the 80s and 90s, the Buddhist Churches of America became involved in the debates over public textbooks promoting creationism and the use of prayer in schools.

=== Theravada ===
In 1965, monks from Sri Lanka established the Washington Buddhist Vihara in Washington, D.C., the first Theravada monastic community in the United States. The Vihara was quite accessible to English-speakers, and Vipassana meditation was part of its activities. However, the direct influence of the Theravada Vipassana movement (as known as the Insight meditation movement) would not reach the U.S. until a group of Americans returned there in the early 1970s after studying with Vipassana masters in Asia. Influential figures include Sharon Salzberg, Jack Kornfield, and Joseph Goldstein, who in 1975 founded the now influential Insight Meditation Society in Barre, Massachusetts. In 1984, Kornfield helped found the Spirit Rock Meditation Center, the major center of this tradition on the West coast. According to Coleman, both meditation centers are &quot;organized around a community of teachers with collective decision making.&quot; A small number of Westerners who had ordained in the Theravada Thai Forest tradition have also moved back to the West and established more traditional monastic communities, such as Thanissaro Bhikkhu (founding figure and abbot of Metta Forest Monastery in California) and Ajahn Sumedho (who helped found Chithurst Buddhist Monastery in West Sussex).

=== Tibetan Buddhism ===

The sixties counterculture had already established an interest in Tibetan Buddhism, through Timothy Leary&#x27;s publication of an adaptation of the so-called Tibetan Book of the Dead under the title The Psychedelic Experience. Since the 1970s, interest in Tibetan Buddhism also grew dramatically, especially due to the arrival of Tibetan lamas in the West after the Chinese occupation of Tibet and the creation of a Tibetan diaspora. This was fueled in part by the romantic view of Tibet and also because Western media agencies (especially Hollywood) and celebrities are largely sympathetic with the &#x27;Tibetan Cause&#x27; and with the extremely charismatic and influential figure of the Dalai Lama. The first Western woman to take full ordination in Tibetan Buddhism was Freda Bedi.

Kagyu Samye Ling in Scotland was founded in 1967 by two spiritual masters, Choje Akong Tulku Rinpoche and Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche. It was the first Tibetan Buddhist Centre to be established in the West and was named after Samye, the very first monastery to be established in Tibet. In 1977 during his second visit to Samye Ling, the 16th Karmapa assured Akong Rinpoche about the longer-term future of Buddhism in the West and at Samye Ling. It is from this encounter that the Samye Project was born. Samyé Ling now has established centres in more than 20 countries, including Belgium, Ireland, Poland, South Africa, Spain and Switzerland.

Chogyam Trungpa, later under the guidance of the Karmapa (Rangjung Rigpe Dorje), established institutions in the United States such as Naropa Institute and developed innovative teachings (Shambala training, introduced in 1977) which he saw as suited for Westerners. The Karmapa had originally told Chögyam Trungpa he would bring dharma to the west in 1954, long before Tibetan Lamas had any concept of Europe at all. In 1963 Trungpa made his first voyage to Europe. Later in Bhutan in 1968 he realized the West needed a very different approach to Vajrayana Buddhism. He then gave back his robes and went to North America.

Another controversial and successful figure in bringing Buddhism to the West is Lama Ole Nydahl. They were wild hippies when he and his wife Hannah Nydahl first met the 16th Karmapa in 1969. The combining of lay and yogi style together as one, while using the traditional practices of Ngöndro and teachings on Mahamudra is a distinct approach to bringing Vajrayana methods to Western lay practitioners. The focus is on making Karma Kagyu teachings and methods available to modern and independent thinkers in the West. In 1972, the 16th Karmapa Rangjung Rigpe Dorje requested Lama Ole Nydhal and Hannah Nydhal to establish Buddhist centers of the Karma Kagyu lineage in the Western world. Lama Ole Nydahl offered Buddhist refuge to tens of thousands of people and founded 640 Buddhist centers around the world.

In response to the ever-increasing number of people interested in the &quot;Tibet Message&quot; Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, 16th Karmapa established a study, retreat and meditation center in France “Dhagpo Kagyu Ling”, founded in 1975, as the European seat of the Karma Kagyü school. The Gyalwa Karmapa sent two particularly qualified teachers to Dhagpo: Lama Gendun Rinpoche, a great master of meditation, and Lama Jigme Rinpoche, an accomplished spiritual master. Tarthang Tulku was another Tibetan to establish a center in the West in 1969.

Perhaps the most widely visible Buddhist teacher in the west is the much-travelled Tenzin Gyatso, the current Dalai Lama, who first visited the United States in 1979. As the exiled political leader of Tibet, he is now a popular &quot;cause célèbre&quot; in the west. His early life was depicted in glowing terms in Hollywood films such as &quot;Kundun&quot; and &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot;. He has attracted celebrity religious followers such as Richard Gere and Adam Yauch. All four of the main Tibetan Buddhist schools are now established in the West. Tibetan lamas such as Akong Rinpoche, Lama Gendün Rinpoche, Dudjom Rinpoche, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche, Geshe Wangyal, Geshe Lhundub Sopa, Dezhung Rinpoche, Sermey Khensur Lobsang Tharchin, Lama Yeshe, Thubten Zopa Rinpoche and Geshe Kelsang Gyatso all established teaching centers in the West from the 1970s. Tibetan Lamas and their Western students also worked to translate and publish Tibetan Buddhist texts, establishing publishers such as Wisdom Publications and Shambala Publications.In Brazil, the first Tibetan Buddhist center, the Tarthang Tulku Nyingma Center, was founded in 1988 in São Paulo. During the 90s, there was a rise in interest in Tibetan Buddhism, and other forms of Asian Buddhism such as Thai, Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese traditions are also present in the country. In other Latin American countries such as Argentina and Peru, there was also the introduction of Buddhism through immigration and conversion, though populations remain small (20,000 in Argentina in 2012). Japanese Zen and Tibetan Buddhism has been especially influential in these countries in the post-war 20th century. 

=== Other traditions ===
In England, an influential figure is Sangharakshita, who founded a modernist and eclectic new tradition called Triratna (formerly the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order (FWBO) in 1967.

==Contemporary Western Buddhism==
Today, Buddhism is practiced by increasing numbers of people in the Americas, Europe and Oceania. Buddhism has become the fastest growing religion in Australia and some other Western nations.

Some of the major reasons for this spread include globalization, immigration, improved literacy and education (most Westerners are first exposed to Buddhism through reading), and the breakdown of the hegemony of Christianity on Western culture.

There is a general distinction between Buddhism brought to the West by Asian immigrants, which may be Mahayana, Theravada or a traditional East Asian mix (&quot;ethnic Buddhism&quot;), and Buddhism as practiced by converts (&quot;convert Buddhism&quot;), which is often Zen, Pure Land, Vipassana or Tibetan Buddhism. Some Western Buddhists are actually non-denominational and accept teachings from a variety of different sects, which is far less frequent in Asia. A few authors have proposed that Western Buddhism, especially in its non-denominational form, may be viewed as a &quot;new vehicle&quot; of Buddhism alongside the traditional Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana – &quot;Navayana&quot;. (However, the term &quot;Navayana&quot; is more commonly used to instead refer to the Dalit Buddhist movement founded in India by Bhimrao R. Ambedkar.)

Demographically as a convert religion, Western Buddhism appeals more to whites and to the middle and upper-middle classes as well as to the politically left wing and to those who live in urban areas.

While retaining a more formalized organization, Western Buddhism has also influenced the New Age movement and is in some ways similar to it. Western Buddhism has also been influenced by the insights of western psychology and psychotherapy and many Buddhist teachers in the West are licensed therapists.

The regular practice of meditation as a central focus is also a common feature of most modern Western Buddhist groups. The exception are those groups like Soka Gakkai which are chanting focused. Much of contemporary Buddhism in the West is influenced by the spread of lay practice centers, where laypersons meet for meditation practice and also may stay for meditation retreats. While rituals are not absent in contemporary traditions, they are less likely to be seen as providing supernatural benefits. The Vipassana or insight movement is one example that is particularly innovative and non-traditional. It is led by lay teachers, with democratic forms of organization and promoting mainly meditation with minimal doctrinal content and ritual.

Major Western Buddhist publications include &quot;Lion&#x27;s Roar&quot; (previously &quot;Shambhala Sun&quot;) and &quot;.&quot;

In 2010, there were also around 6,200 Buddhists in Cuba, in various Zen groups, the Diamond Way tradition and also Soka Gakkai (the only Buddhist organization with legal status on the island). According to Frank Usarski, Buddhism remains a statistically small part of South America&#x27;s religious field, &quot;with around 500,000 practitioners and approximately 600 groups&quot; of which around 27% are Tibetan Buddhists, 25% are Soka Gakkai and 22% are Zen.

=== East Asian Buddhism ===
There are numerous East Asian Mahayana Buddhist traditions and communities in the West, which includes ethnic Buddhists and convert Buddhists. The oldest is the Japanese American Jōdo Shinshū Buddhist community of the Buddhist Churches of America.

Another widespread form of East Asian Buddhism in the West is Soka Gakkai, a modernist lay form of Nichiren Buddhism. In the US, SGI also has a larger proportion of African American and Hispanic American members than other convert Buddhist groups.

There are also many ethnic Buddhist temples, founded by Chinese, Vietnamese and Korean Buddhist immigrants. Ethnic Buddhist practice tends to be conducted in Asian languages and to be more traditional. Western-based Chinese Buddhist organizations are some of the most numerous immigrant Buddhists (especially in the United States) and include the Dharma Realm Buddhist Association, Fo Guang Shan and the Tzu Chi foundation.

==== Zen Buddhism ====
The most prominent of the East Asian Mahayana traditions in the West is Zen Buddhism, which was boosted by post-war popularity among the counterculture and influential figures like Shunryu Suzuki. Today it is a popular type of convert Buddhism, in various forms such as Japanese Zen, Vietnamese Thien and Korean Seon. 

Prominent Soto Zen institutions in the West include the San Francisco Zen Center of Shunryu Suzuki, the Zen Center of Los Angeles of Hakuyu Taizan Maezumi and the International Zen Association founded by Taisen Deshimaru.

Rinzai affiliated Zen organisations include Dai Bosatsu Zendo Kongo-ji and the Mt. Baldy Zen Center in the USA and the Falaise Verte Zen Centre in France. 

The international Kwan Um school of Korean Seon is one of the most well known Korean Buddhist institutions in the West, while Thích Nhất Hạnh&#x27;s Order of Interbeing is one of the most popular modernist Vietnamese Thien international organizations.

According to Hughes Seager, in America, Zen is &quot;primarily a movement of laity who practice monastic disciplines.&quot; These institutions tend to be more liberal than their Asian counterparts, more lay based and more likely to promote gender equality. According to Hughes Seager, Western Zen &quot;is Anglicized. It is democratized. It is tailored to the middle-class American life-style, with its focus on the workplace and nuclear family.&quot;

=== Tibetan Buddhism ===

Tibetan Buddhism in the West has remained largely traditional, keeping all the doctrine, ritual, guru devotion, etc. This is because the influential Tibetan Buddhist teachers in the West are still mostly Tibetans.An example of a large Buddhist institution established in the West is the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition (FPMT). FPMT is a network of Buddhist centers focusing on the Geluk school, founded in the 1970s by Lamas Thubten Yeshe and Thubten Zopa Rinpoche. The FPMT has grown to encompass more than 142 teaching centers in 32 countries. Like many Tibetan Buddhist groups, the FPMT does not have &quot;members&quot; per se, or elections, but is managed by a self-perpetuating board of trustees chosen by its spiritual director (head lama), Lama Zopa Rinpoche.

Besides the large organizations or networks such as FPMT, Diamond Way Buddhism, the Dzogchen community and Shambhala International, there are also numerous independent temples, centers and communities. These include Sravasti Abbey (USA), Kagyu Samye Ling (Scotland), and Lerab Ling (France).

Westerners such as Lama Surya Das and Robert Thurman have also emerged as influential voices in the Western Tibetan Buddhist community.

=== Theravada Buddhism and Insight movement ===
There are different forms of Theravada Buddhism in the West. One of these forms is that taken by the Asian immigrant communities and their temples, which is the most traditional and conservative, but is still undergoing change and adaptation. Some of these adaptations include the development of institutions of higher learning for their monastics as well as the establishment of retreat centers, summer camps and schools for the lay community. According to Paul Numrich, in 1996 there were around 150 Theravada temples (wats or viharas) in more than 30 US states.

Some Westerners have also adopted and brought the traditional monastic forms to the West, especially those Western monastics associated with the Thai forest tradition. Representatives of this trend are the Abhayagiri Buddhist Monastery in Northern California, the Mettā Forest Monastery in Southern California, the Birken Forest Buddhist Monastery in Canada, the Amaravati Buddhist Monastery in the UK, and the Bodhinyana Monastery in Australia.

At the other end of the spectrum are the much more liberal lay convert Buddhists belonging to the Insight meditation or &quot;Vipassana&quot; movement. Many of the founders of this movement studied in retreat centers in Asia and then moved back to the West to establish their own meditation centers, which include the Insight Meditation Society and Spirit Rock. They tend to keep ritual and ceremony to a minimum and focus on Buddhist meditation practice in lay life (and in retreats) instead of other activities such as making merit. This style of Buddhism is also influenced by western secular humanism and psychology and tends to be presented as a secular practice or technique rather than as a religion.

=== Modernist Buddhism ===
One feature of Buddhism in the West today (especially among convert Buddhists) is the emergence of other groups which, even though they draw on traditional Buddhism, are in fact an attempt at creating a new style of Buddhist practice.

Shambhala was founded by controversial lama Chögyam Trungpa. He taught authentic Buddhist teachings within a modern-day context by making a clear distinction between the cultural aspects of Tibetan Buddhism and the fundamental teachings of Buddhism. He stripped away the ethnic baggage from traditional methods of working with the mind and delivered the essence of those teachings to his western students. His innovative Shambhala Training system was a secular path for the cultivation of the contemplative life. Chögyam Trungpa also founded Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado in 1974. Trungpa&#x27;s movement has also found particular success in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, Shambhala International being based out of Halifax.

The Triratna Buddhist Community (formerly the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order), was founded by Sangharakshita in 1967, and the Diamond Way Organisation of Ole Nydahl, has founded more than 600 Buddhist centers across the world. Diamond Way presents Buddhism in a modern context to lay practitioners, in over 30 languages. The &quot;spiritual counsel&quot; of the organisation is provided by Trinley Thaye Dorje (India), Kunzing Shamar Rinpoche (India) and Jigme Rinpoche (France).

The New Kadampa Tradition is a global Buddhist new religious movement founded by Kelsang Gyatso in England in 1991. It describes itself as &quot;an entirely independent Buddhist tradition”. The NKT has expanded more rapidly than any other Buddhist tradition, and currently lists more than 200 centres and around 900 branch classes/study groups in forty countries. It has been described as a &quot;controversial&quot; cult, and has been officially rebuked by the Dalai Lama.

=== Issues with charismatic authority and sex scandals ===
A number of groups and individuals have been implicated in sex scandals. Sandra Bell has analysed the scandals at Chögyam Trungpa&#x27;s Vajradhatu and the San Francisco Zen Center and concluded that these kinds of scandals are &quot;... most likely to occur in organisations that are in transition between the pure forms of charismatic authority that brought them into being and more rational, corporate forms of organization&quot;.

Recently further sex abuse scandals have rocked institutions such as Rigpa organization and Shambala international.

Robert Sharf also mentions charisma from which institutional power is derived, and the need to balance charismatic authority with institutional authority. Elaborate analyses of these scandals are made by Stuart Lachs, who mentions the uncritical acceptance of religious narratives, such as lineages and dharma transmission, which aid in giving uncritical charismatic powers to teachers and leaders.

==Popular culture==
Buddhist imagery is increasingly appropriated by modern pop culture and also for commercial use. For example, the Dalai Lama&#x27;s image was used in a campaign celebrating leadership by Apple Computer. Similarly, Tibetan monasteries have been used as backdrops to perfume advertisements in magazines. Hollywood movies such as &quot;Kundun&quot;, &quot;Little Buddha&quot; and &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot; have had considerable commercial success.

Buddhist practitioners in the West are catered for by a minor industry providing such items as charm boxes, meditation cushions, and ritual implements.

== Temples and monasteries ==
The largest Buddhist temple in the Southern Hemisphere is the Nan Tien Temple (translated as &quot;Southern Paradise Temple&quot;), situated at Wollongong, Australia, while the largest Buddhist temple in the Western Hemisphere is the Hsi Lai Temple (translated as &quot;Coming West Temple&quot;), in Hacienda Heights, California, USA. Both are operated by the Fo Guang Shan Order, founded in Taiwan, and around 2003 the Grand Master, Venerable Hsing Yun, asked for Nan Tien Temple and Buddhist practice there to be operated by native Australian citizens within about thirty years. The City of 10,000 Buddhas near Ukiah, California disputes that Hsi Lai Temple is the largest in the western hemisphere and claims it is the largest. This monastery was founded by Ven. Hsuan Hua who purchased the property. &quot;Dharma Realm Buddhist Association purchased the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas in 1974 and established its headquarters there. The City currently comprises approximately 700 acres of land and includes a comprehensive system of education, from Instilling Goodness and Developing Virtue Primary and Secondary School to Dharma Realm Buddhist University.&quot;

In 2006, a western ecumenical Buddhist temple called Dharma Bum Temple was founded in San Diego, California. The temple focuses on being an introductory center for westerners to learn more about Buddhism. It regularly hosts guest speakers from various traditions of Buddhism and is known for directing members to other Buddhist temples in the area after they start showing deeper interest in a particular form of the religion.

Benalmádena Enlightenment Stupa is in Málaga in the Andalusian region of southern Spain, overlooking Costa del Sol. Benalmádena Stupa (Chan Chub Chorten in Tibetan) is 33 m (108 ft) high and is the tallest stupa in Europe. It was inaugurated on 5 October 2003, and was the final project of Buddhist master Lopon Tsechu Rinpoche. The stupa is run by the non-profit Asociación Cultural Karma Kagyu de Benalmádena, under the spiritual guidance of the 17th Karmapa Trinley Thaye Dorje.

<text>Lei Feng (18 December 194015 August 1962) was a soldier in the People&#x27;s Liberation Army who was the object of several major campaigns in China. The most well-known of these campaigns in 1963 promoted the slogan &quot;Follow the examples of Comrade Lei Feng.&quot; Lei was portrayed as a model citizen, and the masses were encouraged to emulate his selflessness, modesty, and devotion to Mao Zedong. After Mao&#x27;s death, state media continued to promote Lei Feng as a model of earnestness and service, and his image still appears in popular forms such as on T-shirts and memorabilia.

The biographic details of Lei Feng&#x27;s life, and especially his diary, supposedly discovered after his death, are generally believed to be propaganda creations; even the historicity of Lei Feng himself is sometimes questioned. The continuing use of Lei in government propaganda has become a source of cynicism and even derision amongst segments of the Chinese population. Nevertheless, Lei&#x27;s function as a propaganda icon has survived decades of political change in China.

==Life==

The current biography of Lei Feng as given in China&#x27;s state media says that he was born in Wangcheng (near the town of Leifeng, Changsha, Hunan, named in his honour). According to CNTV, Lei lost all of his family before the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic, becoming an orphan. His father died when he was just five (killed by the invading Japanese Army), his elder brother, who was exploited as a child labourer, died a year later, and his younger brother passed soon afterward. Finally, his mother died by suicide after being &quot;dishonored by a landlord.&quot;
He became a member of the Communist youth corps when he was young and joined a transportation unit of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army at the age of twenty. According to his official biography, Lei died in 1962 at the age of 21 (22 by Chinese East Asian age reckoning, by which a newborn is age 1 at birth), when a telephone pole, struck by an army truck, hit him as he was directing the truck in backing up.

==Popular image==

Lei Feng was not widely known until after his death. In 1963, &quot;Lei Feng&#x27;s Diary&quot; was first presented to the public by Lin Biao in the first of many &quot;Learn from Lei Feng&quot; campaigns. The diary was full of accounts of Lei&#x27;s admiration for Mao Zedong, his selfless deeds, and his desire to foment revolutionary spirit. Famously, he pledged that his only ambition was &quot;to be a rustless screw&quot; in the revolutionary cause. Lin&#x27;s use of Lei&#x27;s diary was part of a larger effort to improve Mao&#x27;s image, which had suffered after the Great Leap Forward. Scholars generally believe that the diary was forged by Party officials under Lin&#x27;s direction.

The diary contains about 200,000 words describing selfless thoughts with enthusiastic comments on Mao and the inspiring nature of the Party. The campaign began at a time when the Chinese economy was recovering from the Great Leap Forward campaign. In 1964 the Lei Feng campaign shifted gradually from doing good deeds to a cult of Mao.

Chinese leaders have praised Lei Feng as the personification of altruism. Leaders who have written about Lei Feng include Deng Xiaoping, Zhou Enlai, and Jiang Zemin. His cultural importance is still reproduced and reinforced by the media and cultural apparatus of the Chinese party-state, including emphasizing the importance of moral character during Mao&#x27;s era. Lei Feng&#x27;s prominence in school textbooks has since declined, although he remains part of the national curriculum. The phrase &quot;huó Léi Fēng&quot; (; lit. &quot;living Lei Feng&quot;) has become a noun (or adjective) for anyone who is seen as selfless, or anyone who goes out of their way to help others.

The CCP&#x27;s construction of Lei Feng as a celebrity soldier is unique to the PRC and differs from the more typical creation of military heroes by governments during times of war. In the PRC, Lei Feng was part of continuing public promotion of soldiers as exemplary models, and evidence of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army&#x27;s role as social and political support to the Communist government.

===Historicity===
Details of Lei Feng&#x27;s life have been subject to dispute. While someone named Lei Feng may have existed, scholars generally believe the person depicted in the campaign was almost certainly a fabrication. Some observers noted, for instance, that the campaign presented a collection of twelve photographs of Lei Feng performing good deeds. The photographs were of exceptionally high professional quality, and depicted Lei—supposedly an obscure and unknown young man—engaging in mundane tasks.

The lauded details of Lei Feng&#x27;s life according to official documents led him to become a subject of derision and cynicism among segments of the Chinese populace. As John Fraser recalled, &quot;Any Chinese I ever spoke to outside of official occasions always snorted about Lei Feng.&quot;

A 2008 Xinhua survey noted that a large number of elementary school students have vague knowledge of Lei Feng&#x27;s life, and that 32 percent of the surveyed have read Lei&#x27;s diary.

===Contemporary cultural importance===
5 March has become the official &quot;Learn from Lei Feng Day&quot; (). This day involves various community and school events where people go to clean up parks, schools, and other community locations. Local news on that day usually has footage from these events.

Lei Feng is especially honoured in Changsha, Hunan, and in Fushun, Liaoning. The Lei Feng Memorial Hall (in his birthplace, now named for him, Leifeng) and Lei Feng statue are located in Changsha. The local hospital carries his name. There is also a Lei Feng Memorial Hall, with a museum, in Fushun. Lei Feng&#x27;s military unit was based in Fushun, where he died. His tomb is located on the memorial grounds. To commemorate Lei Feng, the city of Fushun named several landmarks in honor of him. There is a Lei Feng Road, a Lei Feng Elementary School, a Lei Feng Middle School and a Leifeng bank office.

There is a common misconception that Lei Feng was well known in the US and honored at West Point. The myth has been traced to a 1981 April Fool&#x27;s Day article that Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Zhurun mistook for a real article. Li issued a retraction in 2015.

Lei Feng&#x27;s story continues to be referenced in popular culture. A popular song by Jilin singer Xue Cun (雪村) is called &quot;All Northeasterners are Living Lei Fengs&quot; (). A 1995 release, originally notable only for its use of Northeastern Mandarin, it shot to nationwide fame when it was combined with kitsch animations on the Internet in 2001. In March 2006, a Chinese organization released an online game titled &quot;Learn from Lei Feng Online&quot; (学雷锋) in which the player has to do good deeds, fight spies, and collect parts of Mao Zedong&#x27;s collection. If the player wins, he or she gets to meet Chairman Mao in the game. In the 21st century his image has been used to sell items including, in one case, condom packaging.

By the 2010s, interest in Lei Feng had devolved into kitsch, with his face still commonly appearing on t-shirts, stickers, and posters, but interest in his life story and diary minimal, as ticket sales to feature-length biographical films, &quot;Young Lei Feng,&quot; &quot;Lei Feng’s Smile&quot; and &quot;Lei Feng 1959,&quot; released on Learn from Lei Feng Day, failed to produce any takers at all in some cities. Reportedly, party cadres in rural areas have been charged by the State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television with organizing group viewings.

<text>Via Rail Canada Inc. (), operating as Via Rail or Via (stylized as VIA Rail), is a Canadian Crown corporation that operates intercity passenger rail service in Canada.

As of December 2023, Via Rail operates 406 trains per week across eight Canadian provinces and of track, 97 percent of which is owned and maintained by other railway companies, mostly by Canadian National Railway (CN). Via Rail carried approximately 4.1 million passengers in 2023, 96 percent of which were along the &quot;Corridor&quot; routes connecting the major cities of the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor, and had an on-time performance of 85.4 per cent. Attracting international tourism forms an important part of Via Rail&#x27;s long distance trans-continental services.
==History==
===Background===
Yearly passenger levels on Canada&#x27;s passenger trains peaked at 60 million during World War II. Following the war, the growth of air travel and the personal automobile caused significant loss of mode share for Canada&#x27;s passenger train operators. By the 1960s Canadian National Railway (CN) and the Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) found that passenger trains were no longer economically viable. CP sought to divest itself of its passenger trains, but federal government regulators and politicians balked, forcing them to maintain a minimal service through the 1970s, with the government subsidizing up to 80 percent of losses. CN, being a Crown corporation at that time, was encouraged by the federal government and political interests to invest in passenger trains. Innovative marketing schemes such as &quot;Red, White, and Blue&quot; fares, new equipment such as scenic dome cars and rail diesel cars, and services such as Rapido and the UAC TurboTrain trains temporarily increased numbers of passengers, reversing previous declines.

These increases proved temporary; by 1977, total passenger numbers had dropped below five million. The decline of passenger rail became a federal election issue in 1974 when the government of Pierre Trudeau promised to implement a nationwide carrier similar to Amtrak in the United States. Starting in 1976, CN began branding its passenger services with the bilingual name Via or Via CN. The Via logo began to appear on CN passenger locomotives and cars, while still carrying CN logos as well. That September, Via published a single timetable with information on both CN and CP trains, marking the first time that Canadians could find all major passenger trains in one publication. In 1977, CN underwent a dramatic restructuring when it placed various non-core freight railway activities into separate subsidiaries, such as ferries under CN Marine, and passenger trains under Via Rail which was subsequently renamed Via Rail Canada.

===Formation and early years===

On 12 January 1977, CN spun off its passenger services as a separate Crown corporation, Via Rail Canada. At its inception, Via acquired all CN passenger cars and locomotives. Following several months of negotiation, on 29 October 1978, Via assumed all CP passenger train operations and took possession of cars and locomotives. Passenger train services which were not included in the creation of Via Rail included those offered by BC Rail, Algoma Central Railway, Ontario Northland Railway, Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway, various urban commuter train services operated by CN and CP, and remaining CN passenger services in Newfoundland. At this time, Via did not own any trackage and had to pay right-of-way fees to CN and CP, sometimes being the only user of rural branch lines.

Via initially had a tremendous variety of equipment—much of it in need of replacement—and operated routes stretching from Sydney, Nova Scotia, to Prince Rupert, British Columbia, and north to Churchill, Manitoba. Over 150 scheduled trains per week were in operation, including transcontinental services, regional trains, and corridor services.

While Via remains an independent federal Crown corporation mandated to operate as a business, it is hindered by the fact that it was created by an order in council and not from legislation passed by Parliament. Had Via been enabled by legislation, the company would be permitted to seek funding on the open money markets as other Crown corporations such as CN have done in the past. It is largely for this reason that critics say Via—like Amtrak in the United States—is vulnerable to federal budget cuts and continues to answer first to its political masters, as opposed to the business decisions needed to ensure the viability of intercity passenger rail service.

===1980s===

In 1981, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s government endorsed Minister of Transport Jean-Luc Pépin&#x27;s plan which slashed Via&#x27;s budget, leading to a 40 percent reduction in the company&#x27;s operations. Frequently sold-out trains such as the &quot;Super Continental&quot; and the popular &quot;Atlantic&quot; were discontinued. The retrenchment of the former reduced Via to operating only one transcontinental train, &quot;The Canadian&quot;.

Via also sought to reduce its reliance on over 30-year-old second-hand equipment and placed a significant order with Bombardier Transportation for new high-speed locomotives and cars which would be used in its corridor trains. The LRC (Light, Rapid, Comfortable) locomotives and cars used advanced technology such as active tilt to increase speed, but proved troublesome and took several years to work out problems (by 1990 only a handful of LRC locomotives remained in service which were subsequently retired by the arrival of the GE Genesis locomotives in 2001).

The election of Brian Mulroney&#x27;s Progressive Conservative government in 1984 brought an initial friend to Via, when several of Mulroney&#x27;s commitments included rescinding the Via cuts of 1981 by restoring the &quot;Super Continental&quot; (under pressure from his western caucus), and the &quot;Atlantic&quot; (under pressure from his eastern caucus and then-Saint John mayor Elsie Wayne). Prime Minister Mulroney&#x27;s government gave Via funding to refurbish some of its cars, and purchase new locomotives, this time a more reliable model from General Motors diesel division.

It was during this time on 8 February 1986, that Via&#x27;s eastbound &quot;Super Continental&quot; collided with a CN freight train near Hinton, Alberta, as a result of the freight train crew missing a signal light, resulting in 23 deaths.

By the late 1980s, inflation and other rising costs were taking their toll on federal budgets and in the Mulroney government&#x27;s 1989 budget, Via again saw its budget slashed by $1 billion, surpassing even the 1981 cuts under Trudeau.

===1990s===

Minister of Transport Benoît Bouchard oversaw the reduction in service on 15 January 1990, when Via&#x27;s operations were reduced by 55 percent. The privatization of CN rail in 1995 also negatively affected service as it resulted in an effective monopoly, with Via trains having to yield to CN trains.

Services such as the &quot;Super Continental&quot; were again discontinued, along with numerous disparate rural services such as in Nova Scotia&#x27;s Annapolis Valley and Cape Breton Island, western Canada, and in the corridor. &quot;The Canadian&quot; was also moved from its home rails on CP to the northerly CN route (previously plied by the &quot;Super Continental&quot;). The shift to the less populated route between Toronto and Vancouver severed major western cities such as Regina and Calgary from the passenger rail network and flared western bitterness toward the Government of Canada.

The official justification for the rerouting was that the trains would serve more remote communities, but the concentration of ridings held by the Progressive Conservatives along the CN route attracted the charge that the move was chiefly political. Harvie André, one of Alberta&#x27;s federal cabinet ministers who represented Calgary, stated publicly that he did not care if he never saw a passenger train again in his life.

The Mulroney cuts allowed Via to consolidate its fleet of cars and locomotives, resulting in a fleet of refurbished stainless steel (HEP-1 and HEP-2 rebuilds) and LRC cars, as well as rationalizing its locomotive fleet with GM and Bombardier (LRC) units.

Via was not spared from further cutbacks in Jean Chrétien&#x27;s Liberal government elected in 1993. Minister of Finance Paul Martin&#x27;s first budget in 1994 saw further Via cuts which saw the popular &quot;Atlantic&quot; dropped from the schedule, focusing the eastern transcontinental service on the &quot;Ocean&quot;. CP had sold off a large portion of track the &quot;Atlantic&quot; had operated on and, as Via at that time was only mandated to provide passenger services on tracks belonging to CN or CP, the route was discontinued. This move was seen as somewhat controversial and politically motivated as the principal cities benefiting from the &quot;Atlantic&quot; service were Sherbrooke, Quebec, and Saint John, New Brunswick, where the only two Progressive Conservative Party Members of Parliament in Canada were elected in the 1993 federal election in which Chrétien&#x27;s Liberal Party took power. The &quot;Ocean&quot; service which was preserved currently operates on track between Montreal and Halifax running through the lower St. Lawrence River valley and northern New Brunswick. The Minister of Transport in Chrétien&#x27;s government at the time, Douglas Young, was elected from a district that included Bathurst, New Brunswick, on the &quot;Ocean&quot; route. A remote Via service to Quebec&#x27;s Gaspé Peninsula, the &quot;Chaleur&quot; was also spared from being cut at this time, despite carrying fewer passengers than the &quot;Atlantic&quot;.

====Renaissance funding====

By the late 1990s, with a rail-friendly Minister of Transport, David Collenette, in office, there were modest funding increases to Via. Corridor services were improved with new and faster trains, a weekly tourist train, the &quot;Bras d&#x27;Or&quot;, returned Via service to Cape Breton Island for the first time since the 1990 cuts, and a commitment was made to continue operating on Vancouver Island, but western Canada continued to languish with the only service provided by the &quot;Canadian&quot; and a few remote service trains in northern BC and Manitoba.

In a significant new funding program dubbed &quot;Renaissance&quot;, a fleet of unused passenger cars which had been built for planned &quot;Nightstar&quot; sleeper services between locations in the United Kingdom and Continental Europe via the Channel Tunnel were purchased and adapted following the cancellation of the &quot;Nightstar&quot; project. The new &quot;Renaissance&quot; cars were swiftly nicknamed &quot;déplaisance&quot; (&quot;displeasure&quot;) by French-speaking employees and customers, due to early problems adapting the equipment for Canadian use. Doors and toilets froze in cold Atlantic Canada temperatures, resulting in delays and service interruptions. New diesel-electric P42DC locomotives purchased from General Electric (GE) allowed the withdrawal of older locomotives, including remaining LRCs. LRC passenger cars were retained and continued to provide much of the Corridor service. This expansion to Via&#x27;s fleet has permitted scheduling flexibility. Additionally, many passenger stations have been remodelled into passenger-friendly destinations, with several hosting co-located transit and regional bus hubs for various municipalities.

===2000s===

On 24 October 2003, federal Minister of Transport David Collenette announced $700 million in new funding over the next five years. This funding was below the $3 billion needed to implement a high-speed rail proposal in the Quebec City-Windsor Corridor nicknamed ViaFast; however, the funding was intended to &quot;provide for faster, more frequent and more reliable passenger service across Canada... [preserving] the option for higher speed rail, such as the Via Fast proposal,&quot; said Collenette. This new project was to be called &quot;Renaissance II&quot;.

On 18 December 2003, Liberal Prime Minister (PM) Paul Martin froze federal spending on all major capital projects, including Via&#x27;s five-year $700 million &quot;Renaissance II&quot; program announced just six weeks earlier by outgoing PM Chrétien&#x27;s administration. Critics of Martin&#x27;s cuts claimed that he was in a conflict of interest as his family through Canada Steamship Lines and various subsidiary and affiliated companies had once had a significant investment in the Voyageur Colonial Bus Lines, an intercity bus line in Quebec and eastern Ontario that was a key competitor of Via.

Routes cut under the Martin government included the seasonal &quot;Bras d&#x27;Or&quot; tourist train, which ran for the last time in September 2004, and the Montreal-Toronto overnight &quot;Enterprise&quot;, which was discontinued in September 2005. The Sarnia-Chicago &quot;International&quot; was also discontinued in April 2004 by Amtrak. Via&#x27;s portion of the route from Toronto-Sarnia remained in operation as Via was able to use their own equipment to operate the train.

====Sponsorship scandal====

The federal Auditor General&#x27;s report released on 10 February 2004 showed what appeared to be a criminal misdirection of government funds intended for advertising to key Quebec-based supporters of the Liberal Party of Canada. Included in the Auditor General&#x27;s report was the fact that Via was used as one of several federal government departments, agencies, and Crown corporations to funnel these illicit funds. Forced to act on the Auditor General&#x27;s report due to its political implications, Martin&#x27;s government suspended Via President Marc LeFrançois on 24 February 2004, giving him an ultimatum of several days to defend himself against allegations in the report or face further disciplinary action.

Several days later during LeFrançois&#x27;s suspension, former Via marketing department employee Myriam Bédard claimed she had been fired several years earlier when she questioned company billing practices in dealing with advertising companies. (According to CBC News, an arbitrator&#x27;s report later concluded that Bédard had voluntarily left Via.) She was publicly belittled by Via CEO Jean Pelletier in national media on 27 February 2004. Pelletier retracted his statements but on 1 March, Pelletier was fired. By 5 March, after failing to defend himself adequately against the allegations in the Auditor General&#x27;s report, LeFrançois was fired as well.

====Increasing problems and reinstated funding====

The reversal of funding in 2003 led to a backlog of deferred maintenance and left Via unable to replace or refurbish life-expired locomotives and rolling stock. Conversely, Via ridership increased from 3.8 million in 2005 to 4.1 million in 2006. On 11 October 2007, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty announced federal government funding of $691.9 million over five years (of which $519 million was for capital projects and the remainder additional operating funding). The capital funding was earmarked to refurbish Via&#x27;s fleet of 54 F40PH-2 locomotives to meet new emissions standards and extend their service lives by 15–20 years, refurbish the interiors of LRC coaches, reduce track capacity bottlenecks and speed restrictions in the Windsor-Quebec City Corridor, and make repairs to a number of stations across the network.

This announcement was similar in content to the previous &quot;Renaissance II&quot; package, and once again was criticized for not including new equipment or funding for services outside the Windsor-Quebec City Corridor. Shortly afterwards, documents obtained by the Canadian Press under the &quot;Access to Information Act&quot; revealed that delays due to equipment failures had risen by 60 percent since the previous year. The company attributed this to problems with the aging F40 locomotive fleet.

On 27 January 2009, the Government of Canada&#x27;s 2009 Economic Action Plan increased funding to Via by $407 million to support improvements, including increased train frequencies and enhanced on-time performance and speed, particularly in the Montreal-Ottawa-Toronto corridor.

On 21 July 2009, Via began cancelling all trains in anticipation of an engineers&#x27; strike, which officially began at midnight on 24 July. Engineers had been without a contract since 31 December 2006. Full service resumed on 27 July. An additional strike by the Canadian Auto Workers (CAW) union, representing around 2,200 employees, was planned to begin on 4 July 2010, but was called off after the union and Via reached a three-year contract.

===2010s===
Via experienced more service cuts at the dawn of the 2010s. In March 2011, the daily Victoria–Courtenay &quot;The Malahat&quot; RDC service on Vancouver Island was suspended indefinitely due to deteriorating track (it has yet to resume). By 27 June 2012, Via announced additional service cuts due to funding issues:
* The &quot;Canadian&quot; was reduced from three days a week to two days a week beginning November 2012; service operated twice weekly November–April and thrice weekly May–October until 2019. In 2019, only two trains per week operated on the full route, while the third train ran only between Vancouver and Edmonton once a week in each direction.
* The &quot;Ocean&quot; was reduced from six days a week to thrice weekly beginning October 2012.
* &quot;Corridor&quot; services west of Toronto were reduced, with weekend service reductions to Montreal and Ottawa, Ontario.
* &quot;Corridor&quot; services to Sarnia and the Niagara region were reduced to once daily in October 2012, with additional taking effect in July 2012. Sarnia was left with a single daily round-trip. Niagara Falls lost all service except the joint Amtrak-Via daily New York City-Toronto &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; service, although Toronto regional commuter service was later provided by GO Transit.
* &quot;Corridor&quot; services to Kitchener, London, and Windsor were reduced starting in October 2012, with at least two daily round trips surviving.
* In September 2013, the Gaspé service, which had been &quot;bustituted&quot; in 2011, was suspended indefinitely.

To address declining on-time performance due to freight train traffic on Via routes, MP Olivia Chow drafted a private member&#x27;s bill in 2014 that would reorganize the company and allow the government to force freight rail carriers to give scheduling priority to public passenger rail. However, as with most private member&#x27;s bills, it was not passed.

====Service improvements====
The Quebec-Windsor corridor was the focus of service restorations and implements. A direct Ottawa-Quebec City train was restored, with additional trips between Ottawa, Montreal and Toronto being added. In 2016, LRC passenger cars used for the corridor were refurbished; in the Via 1 class, this included single seating.

In March 2017, Via announced the release of a new category of rail pass valid for the month of July 2017 (corresponding to Canada&#x27;s sesquicentennial celebrations) for youth aged 18–25, costing $150 (several hundred dollars cheaper than a comparable rail pass would typically cost). A larger than expected response resulted in the temporary loss of functionality for Via&#x27;s website. Despite plans to cap the number of passes sold at 1867 (the year of Canadian Confederation), over 4,000 passes were ultimately sold. The company received significant backlash, as it initially appeared there was no limit on the number of passes available.

Extreme winter conditions had always been an operational hazard for Via, with the Ottawa routes and &quot;Canadian&quot; being most vulnerable. Equally, summer repairs and construction often delayed trains systemwide, even though schedules were regularly adjusted in an attempt to minimize delays.

However, by 2018, freight traffic on the heavily used CN lines had become a significant concern for maintaining on-time service. This issue arose due to typical siding sizes, which were not long enough to accommodate modern freight trains. Passenger trains were consequently placed on sidings whenever two trains passed (rather than freights), which meant that passenger trains did not have priority on CN lines. The issue existed in all parts of the Via network, although it became most extreme on the &quot;Canadian&quot;, where delays increased from an average of five hours to as much as 50 over the four-day journey. Via ultimately addressed the issue by eliminating its late policy on its cross-Canada trains but retaining it for the &quot;Corridor&quot; routes. However, Via continues to compensate inconvenienced guests with necessary hotel accommodations prior to the journey, as well as ensuring continued transportation where a connection to a second Via train had been missed. As such, compensation costs were factored into Via&#x27;s 2018 budget.

By the end of 2018, the full route time on the &quot;Canadian&quot; had been increased twice to absorb freight delays. The second extension – to five days – has been mostly successful in decreasing delays, and also allowed for a daytime transit of Hells Gate in BC, previously transversed overnight in the dark. The scheduled increased running time actually resulted in the &quot;Canadian&quot; arriving early on several occasions. However, Toronto–Vancouver service frequencies were reduced to only twice weekly during peak summer period, with a third Toronto–Edmonton run suspended entirely.

On 12 December 2018, Via announced that it had awarded a contract to Siemens Canada for 32 train sets to replace the entire Quebec City-Windsor &quot;Corridor&quot; fleet. This marked the completion of a procurement process launched following the 2018 federal budget, which allocated funding for the fleet replacement. During the request-for-proposals stage, Via had narrowed the potential suppliers down to Siemens, Bombardier, Talgo and Stadler Rail. Siemens was ultimately selected after finishing first on the key criteria, which included the ability to deliver in a timely fashion, the quality of the product offering, and the price. The new fleet will consist of Siemens SC-42 locomotives hauling a combination of coaches, business-class cars, and cab cars from the Siemens Venture series to allow bi-directional operation. The trains will be built at Siemens plant in Sacramento, California, and Siemens committed to including at least 20 percent Canadian content in the final product. The order includes an option for an additional 16 train sets to be exercised if the federal government approves Via&#x27;s high-frequency dedicated-corridor project. The first train set is to be delivered for testing by winter 2021, with the first sets in service by 2022 and all trains in service by 2024. The delivery of the new trains will allow Via to retire LRC and Renaissance equipment from the corridor, and re-allocate the HEP2 and corridor-based HEP1 cars to other parts of the network.

===2020s===

On October 30, 2021, Via Rail implemented a mandatory COVID-19 vaccine policy in line with new Transport Canada regulations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which required all Via Rail staff and passengers aged 12 and older to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 to travel aboard Via Rail trains. Until November 30 a negative COVID test was also considered an alternate to show proof of vaccine prior to boarding.

On March 9, 2022, Minister of Transport Omar Alghabra announced that the federal government would seek private proposals for operation of the proposed High Frequency Rail corridor. Labour union Unifor criticized this move, calling it a first step toward eventual privatization of Via Rail, and launched the Get Canada Back on Track campaign to raise awareness and call for &quot;a legislative framework that protects public, accessible, safe passenger rail and directs immediate public investments&quot; to service improvements.

== Insignia ==
In addition to using commercial logos, Via Rail is one of several Crown corporations that has been granted heraldic symbols by the Canadian Heraldic Authority.

The coat of arms was granted on May 15, 2020, and presented by Canada&#x27;s Chief Herald.

An heraldic badge was approved for use at the same time as the coat of arms. The badge design follows the design of a law enforcement agency badge in Canada, denoting the responsibilities of Via Rail Police Service. The Royal Crown indicates that Via Rail has police constables appointed for the enforcement of the laws relating to the protection of persons and property.

A flag was also granted by the Canadian Heraldic Authority. It is black and charged with Via Rail&#x27;s badge.

==Budget and management==
Via is operated as an independent crown corporation and receives a subsidy from the Minister of Transport to provide service to remote communities. Via operates more than 500 trains per week from coast to coast. The sum of million was earned from passenger revenues in 2018. Over 4.74 million passenger voyages were taken in 2018. An on-time ratio of 71 percent was achieved in that year. Over 3,115 persons were employed by Via by the end of 2018.

Via president Yves Desjardins-Siciliano stated that the subsidy for passenger rail travel in Canada in 2015 was about 200 percent: for every $1 travellers spend on fares, Canada pays $2 in subsidy.

As of May 2019, the chair of the board of directors is Françoise Bertrand. The Annual accounts of Via are audited to GAAP principles by the Auditor-General of Canada, under the &quot;Financial Administration Act&quot;. As a federal Crown corporation, Via Rail Canada Inc. operates under the &quot;Canada Business Corporations Act&quot; and is subject to income taxes, should a profit ever be declared by it. The corporation had $9,300,000 in share capital as of 2018. Via also received $394.4 million of government funding in 2018.

===Expansion plans===
====Maritimes====
Via has explored the introduction of daily regional service in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick (connecting Halifax, Moncton, and Campbellton) to complement the thrice-weekly &quot;Ocean&quot; service to Montreal. As of 2017, Via&#x27;s statement was that it was &quot;exploring an eastern intercity corridor service&quot; and that further developments were dependent on infrastructure upgrades and equipment testing.

Via has also expressed interest in operating commuter rail service on CN tracks in Halifax that would run from the city&#x27;s downtown station as far as Windsor Junction. However, in June 2019, Halifax regional council voted unanimously to direct staff &quot;not to pursue commuter rail service further ... due to infrastructure requirements and associated financial implications, as well as operational considerations and restraints&quot;.

====High-frequency rail project ====
Via developed a $4.4 billion high-frequency rail (HFR) service plan as a response to delays faced by sharing tracks with freight trains. The plan opts for a dedicated track between Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, and Quebec City, offering more frequent trains (although running at conventional speeds). In Ontario, Via would run a new rail line on currently underused tracks from Toronto to Ottawa through Peterborough instead of Kingston. In Quebec, corridor trains would travel from Montreal to Quebec City through Trois-Rivières on the north shore of the St. Lawrence River rather than on the south shore through Drummondville. Via claimed this would allow them to run more trains in the corridor, reduce trip times by 25 percent and improve on-time performance to over 95 percent.

Feasibility studies were funded by the federal government in the 2016–2018 budgets, and the 2018 budget allowed for the funding of the fleet replacement portion of the plan, though not the dedicated rail lines. Contrary to expectations, the 2019 federal budget did not include a final decision for new funds for HFR. However, in January 2020 Via announced the hiring of a joint venture of engineering firms AECOM and Arup to undertake a detailed engineering study of the proposal. The Toronto city council passed a motion supporting the project on March 30, 2023.

In February 2025, the federal government announced that the VIA HFR project had now become Alto, a high-speed rail network in the Toronto - Quebec City corridor.

===Service suspensions===
Two former Via routes—&quot;The Malahat&quot; (service ended in 2011) and &quot;Chaleur&quot; (service ended in 2013)—are currently suspended due to poor track conditions. Via plans to reintroduce service once track upgrades have been completed. The Quebec government announced funds for repairs to &quot;Chaleur&quot; trackage in 2017, with a completion date stated only as being &quot;several years away.&quot; No concrete plan to restore trackage along &quot;The Malahat&quot; has been announced .

The Winnipeg–Churchill train was disrupted by severe spring flooding on 23 May 2017, when the Hudson Bay Railway tracks were damaged beyond standard maintenance. Winnipeg–Gillam service continued. OmniTRAX, the original owner of the track, refused to make the repairs, saying that the track was no longer viable, despite the matching federal subsidy. The railroad was Churchill&#x27;s only land link to southern Canada, and its loss resulted in significant cost-of-living increases for residents along the corridor (a stranded train was removed by ship in October 2017).

Service to Churchill was restored in late 2018, after the tracks, Churchill port, and Churchill marine tank farm were purchased by Arctic Gateway Group. The federal government assisted in the purchase with $74 million of dedicated northern infrastructure money up front and an additional commitment of $43 million over 10 years. To restore passenger rail service before winter, Arctic Gateway repaired 29 washouts in 35 days. Although a special Via train arrived in Churchill on 1 November, the first regular Via train arrived in Churchill on 4 December, 560 days after service initially ceased.

On February 13, 2020, following several days of blockades during the nationwide Coastal GasLink Pipeline protests, Via Rail announced that it would be shutting down most of its passenger train service across Canada until further notice, with the exception of the Sudbury–White River train line and the Winnipeg–Churchill train between Churchill and The Pas. Later in 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly all Via Rail trains were suspended with the exception of the Winnipeg-Churchill train as well as one train daily on each route within the corridor. Along with the previous protest-related service suspensions, it is the most extensive temporary reduction of service in Via Rail&#x27;s history.

==Travelling on Via==
Travel on Via varies by region as much as class. Many of Via&#x27;s policies and protocols are the product of running a national train system with varying pressures and needs of different passengers, communities, and contexts. The results are wide-ranging travel experiences depending on the distance and location of the journey.

===Unscheduled stops===
Some Via routes outside the corridor offer the option of unscheduled stops at places where there is no station. With 48 hours notice, a passenger can request to entrain or detrain at a specified milepost. This option is available on all of the Adventure Routes, as well as the &quot;Canadian&quot; between Capreol and Winnipeg.

===Classes of service===

*Escape Fare: Discounted seats from economy class, with restrictions on refunds and exchanges. 
*Economy: Economy class seating in coach cars. Snacks and beverages are sold by employees with service carts, in a lounge car, or in a restaurant car. Free Wi-Fi access is provided in the &quot;Corridor&quot; and on the &quot;Ocean&quot;.

* Business: (formerly called Via 1): First-class seating available on most &quot;Corridor&quot; trains in southern Quebec and Ontario.
* Touring: Available on the &quot;Skeena&quot; only in peak travel months.
* Sleeper Plus: Sleeping accommodations aboard overnight trains. This service class was formerly known as Sleeper in some cases, including on the now-suspended &quot;Chaleur&quot;. Each car has access to a washroom and, optionally, a shower. Access to business lounges where available or the Sleeper Plus Lounge in Halifax is available on departure day.
* Prestige: Available on the &quot;Canadian&quot; only. In addition to the Sleeper Plus amenities, includes modernized luxurious sleeping accommodations at the rear of the train.

===On board===
====Amenities====
Smoking is prohibited on all Via trains. Smoking tobacco has been banned on the &quot;Corridor&quot; routes since 1993 and this policy was gradually extended to all trains, while smoking &quot;cannabis&quot; was banned on all Via routes on the same day it was made legal in Canada. The last remaining on-board smoking was permitted in a smoker&#x27;s lounge on some long-distance routes, only at certain times of day until 2002.

Washrooms are provided for each car. On sleeper cars, every private room has its own separate washroom.

Food service varies by train. All trains besides the Sudbury–White River train offer snacks, light meals, and both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages for purchase. Long-distance trains offer traditional sit-down dining and full meals to sleeper class passengers. Economy-class passengers can purchase hot take-out meals prepared in the dining car on long-distance trains during the peak season, and eat in the sit-down dining car in the off-peak.

Complimentary Wi-Fi service is available in the &quot;Corridor&quot;. Via was the first North American transportation service to offer Wi-Fi to its passengers in early 2006, and was one of the first in the world to do so.

Wi-Fi service has been added to the &quot;Ocean&quot; train in the service cars, although connections are unreliable in most places outside urban centres.

====Accessibility and safety concerns====
All Via trains are capable of accommodating wheelchairs, although capacity is limited.

==Routes and connections==
Via operates in the provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. The only province or territory connected to the continental railway network and not served by Via is the Northwest Territories. Newfoundland and Labrador, Nunavut, Prince Edward Island, and Yukon have no rail connections to the continental network and thus no Via service.

Via operates over 475 trains per week over 19 routes, marketed in four broad categories:
* Ontario and Quebec/&quot;Corridor&quot; service: comprising frequent regional and local trains between major cities in a band from Southwestern Ontario to Quebec City. The vast majority of Via&#x27;s trains – over 400 per week – operate here. Cities served by Corridor trains include Windsor, Sarnia, London, Toronto, Kingston, Ottawa, Montreal, and Quebec City. In 2017, corridor service accounted for 95 percent of Via&#x27;s ridership and 77 percent of its revenue.
* The Maritime Way/&quot;Ocean&quot;: providing long-distance service between Quebec and the Maritime provinces. In 2017, the &quot;Ocean&quot; accounted for 2 percent of Via&#x27;s ridership and 3 percent of its revenue.
* The Great Western Way/&quot;Canadian&quot;: providing both long-distance service between Southern Ontario and Western Canada, as well as essential rail services through Northern Ontario. In 2017, the &quot;Canadian&quot; accounted for 2 percent of Via&#x27;s ridership and 20 percent of its revenue.
* Adventure Routes: Five regional and long-distance routes that offer essential rail transportation in rural northern areas. In 2017, these routes in aggregate accounted for 1 percent of Via&#x27;s ridership and revenue. The routes included in this category are:
**Jasper–Prince Rupert train (former name: &quot;Skeena&quot;) - Alberta and British Columbia
**Montreal–Jonquière train (former name: &quot;Saguenay&quot;) - Quebec
**Montreal–Senneterre train (former name: &quot;Abitibi&quot;) - Quebec
**Sudbury–White River train (former name: &quot;Lake Superior&quot;) - Ontario
**Winnipeg–Churchill train (former name: &quot;Hudson Bay&quot;) - Manitoba and Saskatchewan

Unlike Amtrak, which gives every route a specific name, most Via trains are identified only by their route number and destination. The only named Via trains are the &quot;Canadian&quot; and the &quot;Ocean&quot;. The five &quot;Adventure Routes&quot; were previously branded as the &quot;Skeena&quot;, the &quot;Saguenay&quot;, the &quot;Abitibi&quot;, the &quot;Lake Superior&quot;, and the &quot;Hudson Bay&quot;, respectively, and may still be referred to by these names in local usage.

===Track ownership===

As of 2017, the mileage makeup of Via&#x27;s route network by track owner/host railway was as follows:

* 84 per cent: Canadian National Railway
* 8 per cent: Hudson Bay Railway
* 4 per cent: Canadian Pacific Railway
* 3 per cent: Via Rail
* 2 per cent: Metrolinx (GO Transit)

In total, about 88 percent of Via trackage is owned by Class I railroads, 8 percent by shortline railroads, and 5 percent by government agencies.

===Connections===

The &quot;Maple Leaf&quot;, operating between New York City and Toronto via Albany, Buffalo, and Niagara Falls, is jointly managed by Via and Amtrak. The train operates using Amtrak equipment, but on the Canadian side of the border is staffed by Via employees and operated as a typical Via train.

Two other train routes link Canada and the US: the &quot;Adirondack&quot; (Montreal-New York) and the Amtrak &quot;Cascades&quot; (Vancouver-Seattle-Portland). While both of these routes share stations with Via at their Canadian termini, they are fully operated by Amtrak and single-ticket connections to Via trains are not offered.

Via also has connection agreements with several local and intercity bus operators, car-sharing services, and airlines. Passengers who are flying with some airlines can combine their air and rail trips under the same record locator.

==Rolling stock==

Via owns 74 locomotives and 501 passenger cars. Examples include the GMD F40PH-2 diesel locomotive and the famed &quot;Park&quot;-class sleeper-dome-lounge cars found on the rear of the &quot;Canadian&quot; and the Jasper–Prince Rupert train.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 8 February 1986, a Via train collided with a CN freight train near Hinton, Alberta, killing 23 people and injuring 71.
* On 20 November 1994, at approximately 18:20, Via train No. 66 travelling eastward at approximately 96 mph, struck a piece of rail intentionally placed on the track at Mile 242.07 of the CN North America Kingston Subdivision, in Brighton, Ontario. A fire erupted and the trailing portion of the locomotive and the first two-passenger cars behind the locomotive became engulfed in flames. Forty-six of the 385 passengers were injured, most while exiting the train in life-threatening conditions. 2 local residents were charged and convicted after an investigation by the local police.
* On 3 September 1997, the &quot;Canadian&quot; (train No. 2) from Vancouver to Toronto, travelling eastward at 67 mph, derailed at Mile 7.5 of the CN Wainwright Subdivision, near Biggar, Saskatchewan. Thirteen of nineteen cars and the two locomotives derailed. Seventy-nine of the 198 passengers and crew on board were injured, 1 fatally and 13 seriously. Approximately 600 feet of main track was destroyed. The cause was determined to be an axle bearing failure which was detected but erroneously ignored. Via was heavily criticized for a lack of attention to safety.
* On 23 April 1999, Via train No. 74 travelling eastward at Mile 46.7 on the CN Chatham Subdivision in Thamesville, Ontario derailed after a switch was left open by a CN worker causing the train to jump the tracks and collide with stationary hoppers on the adjacent track, derailing the locomotive and its four-passenger cars. The two engineers were killed and 77 of the 186 passengers injured, four seriously. Approximately 50 m of the main track and 100 m of the yard track were destroyed.
* On 12 April 2001, the &quot;Ocean&quot; bound for Montreal derailed in Stewiacke, Nova Scotia, at a manually operated main track switch. A standard CN switch lock used to secure the switch in correct position had been tampered with. The two locomotives and the first two cars continued on the main track, but the following cars took a diverging route onto an industrial track adjacent to the main track. Nine of the cars derailed and a farm supply building, as well as the industrial track were destroyed. Four occupants of the building escaped without injury prior to impact. There were 132 persons on board the train. 22 persons were transported to hospital in either Truro or Halifax. Nine were seriously injured. A 15-year-old boy pleaded guilty to the charge of mischief endangering life relating to the lock tampering.
* On 26 February 2012, Via Train No. 92 en route to Toronto, derailed in Burlington, Ontario, killing all three railroad engineers and injuring 46 (three seriously). The cause of the derailment is attributed to the excessive speed of the train travelling through a switch from track 2 to track 3.
*2013 Via Rail Canada terrorism plot: In April 2013, two men inspired by al-Qaeda were charged with plotting to derail a Via train in the Greater Toronto Area. In 2015, both men were convicted of terrorism-related offenses and sentenced to life imprisonment. One of the two men was mentally unstable and misdiagnosed with schizophrenia.
* On 18 September 2013, a collision occurred between train No. 51 and a double-decker OC Transpo bus that failed to stop at a level crossing in Ottawa, Ontario. Six people were killed and 31 injured (11 critically), all of whom were on the bus. The impact resulted in the train derailing approximately down the track.
* On 5 July 2018, a train with 16 passengers and five crew members derailed north of Hudson Bay, Saskatchewan, while travelling from Winnipeg to Churchill. Passengers and crew sustained only minor injuries, but it took several hours for emergency crews to arrive due to the remote location of the incident. Paramedics and firefighters had to wait near the tracks for CN rail trucks to arrive that could transport them to the crash site.
* On 31 December 2019, a train with five crew and seven passengers derailed and tipped on its side near Katrime, Manitoba. No one was seriously injured.
* On 23 December 2022, Via shut down its Toronto–Ottawa and Toronto–Montreal corridors amid a winter storm, with nine trains becoming trapped overnight including one on the Toronto–Windsor corridor. Two other Via trains that had departed were ordered to return to station. A tree fell on train 55 from Ottawa to Toronto resulting in passengers being trapped on board for 15 hours; a rescue train was required which coupled onto train 55. Subsequently, a car on a CN train derailed in Kingston shutting down the entire Toronto–Montreal corridor on 25 and 26 December. On 25 December alone Via cancelled 25 trains. Via compensated the hundreds of affected customers with refunds and vouchers.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheStar-2022/12/24&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TheStar-2022/12/25&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<text>The Hero with a Thousand Faces (first published in 1949) is a work of comparative mythology by Joseph Campbell, in which the author discusses his theory of the mythological structure of the journey of the archetypal hero found in world myths. 

Since the publication of &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot;, Campbell&#x27;s theory has been consciously applied by a wide variety of modern writers and artists. Filmmaker George Lucas acknowledged Campbell&#x27;s theory in mythology, and its influence on the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films.

The Joseph Campbell Foundation and New World Library issued a new edition of &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; in July 2008 as part of the Collected Works of Joseph Campbell series of books, audio and video recordings. In 2011, &quot;Time&quot; named it among the 100 most influential books written in English since 1923.

==Summary==
Campbell explores the theory that mythological narratives frequently share a fundamental structure. The similarities of these myths brought Campbell to write his book in which he details the structure of the &quot;monomyth&quot;. He calls the motif of the archetypal narrative, &quot;the hero&#x27;s adventure&quot;. In a well-known passage from the introduction to &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot;, Campbell summarizes the monomyth:

In laying out the monomyth, Campbell describes a number of stages or steps along this journey. &quot;The hero&#x27;s adventure&quot; begins in the &quot;ordinary world&quot;. He must depart from the &quot;ordinary world&quot;, when he receives a &quot;call to adventure&quot;. With the help of a &quot;mentor&quot;, the hero will cross a &quot;guarded threshold&quot;, leading him to a supernatural world, where familiar laws and order do not apply. There, the hero will embark on a &quot;road of trials&quot;, where he is tested along the way. The archetypal hero is sometimes assisted by &quot;allies&quot;. As the hero faces the &quot;ordeal,&quot; he encounters the greatest challenge of the journey. Upon rising to the challenge, the hero will receive a reward, or &quot;boon&quot;. Campbell&#x27;s theory of the monomyth continues with the inclusion of a metaphorical &quot;death&quot; and &quot;resurrection&quot;. The hero must then decide to return with this &quot;boon&quot; to the &quot;ordinary world&quot;. The hero then faces more trials on &quot;the road back&quot;. Upon the hero&#x27;s return, the boon or gift may be used to improve the hero&#x27;s ordinary world, in what Campbell calls, the &quot;application of the boon&quot;.

While many myths do seem to follow the outline of Campbell&#x27;s monomyth, there is some variance in the inclusion and sequence of some of the stages. Still, there is an abundance of literature and folklore that follows the motif of the archetypal narrative, paralleling the more general steps of &quot;Departure&quot; (sometimes called &quot;Separation&quot;), &quot;Initiation&quot;, and &quot;Return&quot;. &quot;Departure&quot; deals with the hero venturing forth on the quest, including the &quot;call to adventure&quot;. &quot;Initiation&quot; refers to the hero&#x27;s adventures that will test him along the way. The last part of the monomyth is the &quot;Return&quot;, which follows the hero&#x27;s journey home.

Campbell studied religious, spiritual, mythological and literary classics including the stories of Osiris, Prometheus, the Buddha, Moses, Mohammed, and Jesus. The book cites the similarities of the stories, and references them as he breaks down the structure of the monomyth.

The book includes a discussion of &quot;the hero&#x27;s journey&quot; by using the Freudian concepts popular in the 1940s and 1950s. Campbell&#x27;s theory incorporates a mixture of Jungian archetypes, unconscious forces, and Arnold van Gennep&#x27;s structuring of rites of passage rituals to provide some illumination. &quot;The hero&#x27;s journey&quot; continues to influence artists and intellectuals in contemporary arts and culture, suggesting a basic usefulness for Campbell&#x27;s insights beyond mid-20th century forms of analysis.

==Background==
Campbell used the work of early-20th-century theorists to develop his model of the hero (see also structuralism), including Freud (particularly the Oedipus complex), Carl Jung (archetypal figures and the collective unconscious), and Arnold Van Gennep. Van Gennep contributed the concept of there being three stages of &quot;The Rites of Passage&quot;. Campbell translated this into Separation, Initiation and Return. He also looked to the work of psychoanalyst Otto Rank and ethnographers James George Frazer and Franz Boas. 

Campbell was a noted scholar of James Joyce, having co-authored &quot;A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake&quot; with Henry Morton Robinson. Campbell borrowed the term &quot;monomyth&quot; from Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;. In addition, Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot; was also highly influential in the structuring of the archetypal motif. 

===Publishing history===

The book was originally published by the Bollingen Foundation through Pantheon Press as the seventeenth title in the Bollingen Series. This series was taken over by Princeton University Press, who published the book through 2006. Originally issued in 1949 and revised by Campbell in 1968, &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; has been reprinted a number of times. Reprints issued after the release of &quot;Star Wars&quot; in 1977 used the image of Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker on the cover. Princeton University Press issued a commemorative printing of the second edition in 2004 on the occasion of the joint centennial of Campbell&#x27;s birth and the Press&#x27;s founding with an added foreword by Clarissa Pinkola Estés.

A third edition, compiled by the Joseph Campbell Foundation and published by New World Library, was released as the twelfth title in the Collected Works of Joseph Campbell series in July 2008.

&quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; has been translated into over twenty languages, including Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Chinese (simplified and traditional), Turkish, Dutch, Greek, Danish, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Romanian, Czech, Croatian, Serbian, Slovenian, Russian, Hungarian, Bulgarian and Hebrew, and has sold well over a million copies worldwide.

==Artists influenced by the work==

In &quot;Pathways to Bliss: Mythology and Personal Transformation&quot;, a book drawn from Campbell&#x27;s late lectures and workshops, he says about artists and the monomyth:

===Influences on artists===
&quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; has influenced a number of artists, filmmakers, musicians, producers and poets. Some of these figures include Bob Dylan, George Lucas, Mark Burnett and Jim Morrison. Additionally, Mickey Hart, Bob Weir, and Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead had long noted Campbell&#x27;s influence and participated in a seminar with Campbell in 1986, entitled &quot;From Ritual to Rapture&quot;.

====In film====
Stanley Kubrick introduced Arthur C. Clarke to the book during the writing of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;.

George Lucas&#x27; deliberate use of Campbell&#x27;s theory of the monomyth in the making of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies is well documented. On the DVD release of the famous colloquy between Campbell and Bill Moyers, filmed at Lucas&#x27; Skywalker Ranch and broadcast in 1988 on PBS as &quot;The Power of Myth&quot;, Campbell and Moyers discussed Lucas&#x27;s use of &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; in making his films. Lucas himself discussed how Campbell&#x27;s work affected his approach to storytelling and film-making.

==== In games ====
Jenova Chen, lead designer at thatgamecompany, also cites &quot;The Hero&#x27;s Journey&quot; as the primary inspiration for the PlayStation 3 game &quot;Journey&quot; (2012).

====In literature====
Christopher Vogler, a Hollywood film producer and writer, wrote a memo for Disney Studios on the use of &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; as a guide for scriptwriters; this memo influenced the creation of such films as &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991), &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1992), and &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994). Vogler later expanded the memo and published it as the book &quot;The Writer&#x27;s Journey: Mythic Structure For Writers&quot;, which became the inspiration for a number of successful Hollywood films and is believed to have been used in the development of the &quot;Matrix&quot; series.

Novelist Richard Adams acknowledges a debt to Campbell&#x27;s work, and specifically to the concept of the monomyth. In his best known work, &quot;Watership Down&quot;, Adams uses extracts from &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; as chapter epigrams.

Author Neil Gaiman, whose work is frequently seen as exemplifying the monomyth structure, says that he started &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; but refused to finish it: &quot;I think I got about half way through &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; and found myself thinking if this is true—I don&#x27;t want to know. I really would rather not know this stuff. I’d rather do it because it&#x27;s true and because I accidentally wind up creating something that falls into this pattern than be told what the pattern is.&quot;Many scholars and reviewers have noted how closely J. K. Rowling&#x27;s popular &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books hewed to the monomyth schema.

====In television====
Dan Harmon, the creator of the TV shows &quot;Community&quot; and &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;, has used the monomyth as inspiration for his work.

<text>Donogh Brendan O&#x27;Malley (18 January 1921 – 10 March 1968) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician and rugby union player who served as Minister for Education from 1966 to 1968, Minister for Health from 1965 to 1966 and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance from 1961 to 1965. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Limerick East constituency from 1954 to 1968.

He is best remembered as the Minister who introduced free secondary school education in the Republic of Ireland.

==Early and private life==
O&#x27;Malley was born in Limerick on 18 January 1921, one of eight surviving children of Joseph O&#x27;Malley, civil engineer, and his wife, Mary &quot;Cis&quot; (née Tooher). Born into a wealthy middle-class family, he was educated by the Jesuits at Crescent College and later at Clongowes Wood College, County Kildare. He later studied at University College Galway (UCG), where he was conferred with a degree in civil engineering in 1943. He later returned to Limerick, where he worked as an engineer before becoming involved in politics.

=== Rugby ===
O&#x27;Malley played rugby at provincial level for Munster, Leinster and Connacht and at club level for Bohemians and Shannon RFC. His chances at an international career were ruined by the suspension of international fixtures during World War II. It was at a rugby match in Tralee that he first met Dr. Hilda Moriarty (1922–1991), who he would go on to marry in August 1947. Moriarty was from a Gaeltacht area in Daingean Ui Chuis, County Kerry, and assisted him with the Irish language segments of his speeches. The couple had two children: the actor Daragh O&#x27;Malley, and Suzanne, a fashion designer. O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s wife is famous as Patrick Kavanagh&#x27;s ideal love in the poem &quot;On Raglan Road&quot;. Prior to meeting Hilda, O&#x27;Malley had been engaged to Audrey Harris (sister of the actor Richard Harris) who died tragically at the age of 21.
==Early political career==
Although O&#x27;Malley ran as a Fianna Fáil candidate (the party which emerged from the anti-Treaty side in the Irish Civil War), he was born into a politically active family who supported Cumann na nGaedheal (the party which emerged from the pro-Treaty side) until a falling-out with the party in the early 1930s. He first became involved in local politics as a member of Limerick Corporation. He became Mayor of Limerick in 1961, the third O&#x27;Malley brother to hold the office (Desmond O&#x27;Malley was mayor from 1941 to 1943, and Michael O&#x27;Malley from 1948 to 1949). O&#x27;Malley was a strong electoral performer, topping the poll in every general election he ran in.

Donogh O&#x27;Malley was first elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fianna Fáil TD for Limerick East at the 1954 general election; Fianna Fáil was not returned to government on that occasion. He spent the rest of the decade on the backbenches; however, his party was returned to power in 1957. Two years later, the modernising process began when Seán Lemass took over from Éamon de Valera as Taoiseach. Lemass introduced younger cabinet ministers, as the old guard who had served the party since its foundation in 1926 began to retire.

In 1961, O&#x27;Malley joined the government as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance. O&#x27;Malley was part of a new, brasher style of politician that emerged in the 1960s, sometimes nicknamed &quot;the men in the mohair suits&quot;. It was expected that this generation of politician, born after the Civil War, would be a modernising force in post-de Valera Ireland.

Although his sporting background was in rugby and swimming, it was Association football which O&#x27;Malley got involved in at a leadership level, becoming President of the Football Association of Ireland despite never having played the sport.
==Cabinet career==
Following Fianna Fáil&#x27;s retention of power in the 1965 general election, O&#x27;Malley joined the cabinet as Minister for Health. He spent just over a year in this position before he was appointed Minister for Education, a position in which he displayed renowned dynamism. Having succeeded another dynamic young minister, Patrick Hillery (a political ally and friend who had attended medical school with O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s wife, Hilda) he resolved to act swiftly to introduce the recommendations of an official report on education.

As Minister for Education, O&#x27;Malley extended the school transport scheme and commissioned the building of new non-denominational comprehensive and community schools in areas where they were needed. He introduced Regional Technical Colleges (RTCs), now called Institutes of Technology, in areas where there was no third level college. The best example of this policy is the University of Limerick, originally an Institute of Higher Education, where O&#x27;Malley is credited with taking the steps to ensure that it became a university. His plan to merge Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin aroused huge controversy, and was not successful, despite being supported by his cabinet colleague Brian Lenihan. Access to third-level education was also extended, the old scholarship system being replaced by a system of means-tested grants that gave easier access to students without well-off parents.

=== Free secondary school education ===
Mid-twentieth century Ireland experienced significant emigration, especially to the neighbouring United Kingdom where, in addition to employment opportunities, there was a better state provision of education and healthcare. Social change in Ireland and policies intending to correct this deficit were often met with strong resistance, such as Noël Browne&#x27;s proposed Mother and Child Scheme. As a former Health Minister, O&#x27;Malley had first-hand experience of running the department which had attempted to introduce this scheme and understood the processes that caused it to fail, such as resistance from Department of Finance and John Charles McQuaid. This influenced his strategy in presenting the free-education proposal.

Shortly after O&#x27;Malley was appointed, he announced that from 1969 all education up to Intermediate Certificate level would be without cost, and free buses would bring students in rural areas to their nearest school. O&#x27;Malley seems to have made this decision himself without consulting other ministers; however, he did discuss it with Lemass. Jack Lynch—who, as Minister for Finance, had to find the money to pay for the programme—was not consulted and was dismayed at the announcement.

On 10 September 1966, O&#x27;Malley addressed a dinner of the National Union of Journalists in which he publicly revealed the scheme.“I propose therefore, from the coming school year, beginning in September of next year, to introduce a scheme whereby, up to the completion of the Intermediate Certificate course, the opportunity for free post-primary education will be available to all families.”

“This free education will be available in the comprehensive and vocational schools, and in the general run of secondary schools. I say the general run of secondary schools because there will still be schools, charging higher fees, who may not opt to take my scheme; and the parent who wants to send his child to one of these schools and pay the fees will of course be free to do so.

“Going on from there, I intend also to make provision whereby no pupil will, for lack of means, be prevented from continuing his or her education up to the end of the Leaving Certificate course. Further, I propose that assistance towards the cost of books and accessories will be given, through the period of his or her course, to the student on whom it would be a hardship to meet all such costs&quot;.By announcing the decision first to journalists and on a Saturday (during a month when the Dáil was in recess), the positive public reaction would temper resistance to the idea before the next cabinet meeting. O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s proposals were hugely popular with the public, and it was impossible for the government to go back on his word.

Some Irish commentators consider that O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s extension of education, changing Ireland from a land where the majority were schooled only to the age of 14 to a country with universal secondary-school education, indirectly led to the Celtic Tiger boom of the 1990s-2000s when it was followed for some years by an extension of free education to primary degree level in university, a scheme that was launched in 1996 by the Labour Party and axed in 2009 by Fianna Fáil&#x27;s Batt O&#x27;Keeffe.

===The Kennedy Report===
In 1967 O’Malley appointed Justice Eileen Kennedy to chair a committee to carry out a survey and report on the reformatory and industrial school systems. The report, which was published in 1970, was considered ground-breaking in many areas and came to be known as the Kennedy Report.

The Report made recommendations about a number of matters, including the Magdalene laundries, in relation to which they were not acted upon. The report recommended the closure of a number of reformatories, including the latterly infamous reformatory at Daingean, County Offaly.

==Death==
O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s reforms made him one of the most popular members of the government; he was affectionately known as &#x27;the School Man&#x27; for his work in education. His sudden death in Limerick on 10 March 1968, before his vision for the education system was completed, came as a shock to the public. He was buried with a full Irish state funeral.

Following his death, his widow, Hilda O&#x27;Malley, did not run in the subsequent by-election for the seat he had left vacant. It was won narrowly by their nephew Desmond O&#x27;Malley. Hilda sought the Fianna Fáil nomination for the 1969 general election, but Fianna Fáil gave the party nomination to Desmond, as the sitting TD. Hilda O&#x27;Malley ran as an Independent candidate in that election; after what proved a bitter campaign against her nephew, she failed to get the fourth seat in Limerick East by just 200 votes.

<doc id="297243" wikidata="Q2920080" url="?curid=297243" title="Cross-functional team">
<text>A cross-functional team (XFN), also known as a multidisciplinary team or interdisciplinary team, is a group of people with different functional expertise working toward a common goal. It may include people from finance, marketing, operations, and human resources departments. Typically, it includes employees from all levels of an organization. Members may also come from outside an organization (in particular, from suppliers, key customers, or consultants).

Cross-functional teams often function as self-directed teams assigned to a specific task which calls for the input and expertise of numerous departments. Assigning a task to a team composed of multi-disciplinary individuals increases the level of creativity and establishes common opinion. Each member offers an alternative perspective to the problem and potential solution to the task. In business today, innovation is a leading competitive advantage and cross-functional teams promote innovation through a creative collaboration process. Members of a cross-functional team need not be well versed in multi-tasking per se, but must be prepared to help out in different aspects of building an actual product as they are collectively responsible for their cross-functional team duties as well as their normal day-to-day work tasks.

Some researchers have viewed cross-functional interactions as cooperative or competitive in nature, while others have argued that organization&#x27;s functional areas are often forced to compete and cooperate simultaneously with one another (“coopetition”) and it is critical to understand how these complex relationships interplay and affect firm performance.

Decision making within a team may depend on consensus, but often is led by a manager/coach/team leader. Leadership can be a significant challenge with cross-functional teams. Leaders are charged with the task of directing team members of various disciplines. They must transform different variations of input into one cohesive final output. Cross-functional teams can be likened to the board of directors of a company. A group of individuals of various backgrounds and disciplines are assembled to collaborate in an efficient manner in order to better the organization or solve a problem.

Some organizations are built around cross-functional workflows by having reporting lines to multiple managers. This type of management is called matrix management, and such organizations are often called matrix organizations.

== Effects ==
The growth of self-directed cross-functional teams has influenced decision-making processes and organizational structures. Although management theory likes to propound that every type of organizational structure needs to make strategic, tactical, and operational decisions, new procedures have started to emerge that work best with teams.

===Less unidirectional===
Up until recently, decision making flowed in one direction. Overall corporate-level objectives drove strategic business unit (SBU) objectives, and these in turn, drove functional level objectives. Today, organizations have flatter structures, companies diversify less, and functional departments have started to become less well-defined. The rise of self-directed teams reflects these trends. Intra-team dynamics tend to become multi-directional rather than hierarchical. Interactive processes encourage consensus within teams. Also the directives given to the team tend to become more general and less prescribed.

===Greater scope of information===
Cross-functional teams require a wide range of information to reach their decisions. They need to draw on information from all parts of an organization&#x27;s information base. This includes information from all functional departments. System integration becomes important because it makes all information accessible through a single interface. An inherent benefit of a cross-functional team is the breadth of knowledge brought to the group by each member. Each team member is a representative of a department and therefore can leverage their familiarity with accessing and providing knowledge of that department for the team. This increases the efficiency of a cross-functional team by reducing time spent gathering information.

===Greater depth of information===
Cross-functional teams require information from all levels of management. The teams may have their origins in the perceived need to make primarily strategic decisions, tactical decisions, or operational decisions, but they will require all three types of information. Almost all self-directed teams will need information traditionally used in strategic, tactical, and operational decisions. For example, new product development traditionally ranks as a tactical procedure. It gets strategic direction from top management, and uses operational departments like engineering and marketing to perform its task. But a new product development team would consist of people from the operational departments and often someone from top management.

In many cases, the team would make unstructured strategic decisions—such as what markets to compete in, what new production technologies to invest in, and what return on investment to require; tactical decisions like whether to build a prototype, whether to concept-test, whether to test-market, and how much to produce; and structured operational decisions like production scheduling, inventory purchases, and media flightings. In other cases, the team would confine itself to tactical and operational decisions. In either case it would need information associated with all three levels.

===Greater range of users===
Cross-functional teams consist of people from different parts of an organization. Information must be made understandable to all users. Not only engineers use technical data, and not only accountants use financial data, and not only human resources personnel use HR data. Modern organizations lack middle managers to combine, sort, and prioritize the data. Technical, financial, marketing, and all other types of information must come in a form that all members of a cross-functional team can understand. This involves reducing the amount of specialized jargon, sorting information based on importance, hiding complex statistical procedures from the users, giving interpretations of results, and providing clear explanations of difficult. Data visualization systems can present complex results in an intuitive manner.

===Less goal dominated===
Since Peter Drucker in 1954 book &quot;The Practice of Management&quot; published his views on management by objectives, business decision making has become more goal-oriented. Managers have come to view decision-making generally, and strategic thinking in particular, as a multi-stage process that starts with an assessment of the current situation, defining objectives, then determining how to reach these objectives. Management by objectives took this basic scheme and applied it to virtually all significant decisions.

Today many firms have started to opt for a less structured, more interactive approach. One way of implementing this involves using self-directed cross-functional teams. Proponents hope that these teams will develop strategies that will re-define industries and create new “best practice”. They think that incremental improvements do not suffice.

Cross-functional teams, using unstructured techniques and searching for revolutionary competitive advantages, allegedly require information systems featuring increased interactivity, more flexibility, and the capability of dealing with fuzzy logic. Artificial intelligence may one day be useful in this aspect.

== Collaboration in cross-functional teams ==
Many teams in large organizations face challenges around creating a collaborative atmosphere when dealing with cross-functional dependencies and peers from other functions. The structure of the organizations in general do not support cross-functional collaboration among the teams.

Smooth communication is the base of the cross-functional teams. Team must schedule all meetings, and prepare the agenda for each. Team must know of what is to be discussed.

It becomes important for the organizations to build a culture among its employees, a sense of entitlement with each of the stakeholders to push them to give an extra effort and collaborate with other teams to achieve company goals. This is critical to proactive collaboration, beyond just at a time of crisis.

<doc id="297245" wikidata="Q560482" url="?curid=297245" title="Cathal Brugha">
<text>Cathal Brugha (; born Charles William St John Burgess; 18 July 1874 – 7 July 1922) was an Irish republican politician who served as Minister for Defence from 1919 to 1922, Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann in January 1919, the first president of Dáil Éireann from January 1919 to April 1919 and Chief of Staff of the Irish Republican Army from 1917 to 1918. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1918 to 1922.

He was active in the Easter Rising, the Irish War of Independence and the Irish Civil War, and was the first Ceann Comhairle (chairperson) of Dáil Éireann as well as the president of Dáil Éireann, the then title of the head of government.

==Early life==
Brugha was born in Dublin, of mixed Roman Catholic and Protestant parentage. He was the tenth child in a family of fourteen. His father, Thomas, was a cabinet maker and antique dealer who had been disinherited by his family for marrying an Irish Catholic, Maryanne Flynn.

Brugha attended Colmcille Schools on Dominick Street until 1888 when he moved to Belvedere College. He had intended to study medicine but this did not come to fruition after his father&#x27;s business failed in 1890. Brugha was seen as an austere figure, not very different from Éamon de Valera, and was known not to smoke cigarettes, swear or drink alcohol.

==Political activity==
In 1899, Brugha joined the Gaelic League, and he subsequently changed his name from Charles Burgess to Cathal Brugha. He met his future wife, Kathleen Kingston, at an Irish class in Birr, County Offaly, and they married in 1912 in the Church of Three Patrons in Rathgar (where fellow Belvederean James Joyce had sung in the choir before leaving for Europe). They had six children, five girls and one boy. Brugha became actively involved in the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB); in 1913, he became a lieutenant in the Irish Volunteers. He led a group of twenty Volunteers to receive the arms smuggled into Ireland in the Howth gun-running of 1914.

Brugha started work with Hayes &amp; Finch, a firm supplying churches with candles. In 1909 he and two of his workmates, Anthony and Vincent Lalor, founded Lalor Ltd, a candlemaking and church supplies firm based at 14 Lower Ormond Quay; Brugha became a director and travelling salesman. Caitlín Kingston came from a family of large shopkeepers; later she ran Kingston&#x27;s drapery, one of Dublin&#x27;s central draperies.

He was second-in-command at the South Dublin Union under Commandant Éamonn Ceannt in the Easter Rising of 1916. On the Thursday of Easter Week, being badly wounded, he was unable to leave when the retreat was ordered. Brugha, weak from loss of blood, continued to fire upon the enemy, and was found by Eamonn Ceannt singing &quot;God Save Ireland&quot; with his pistol still in his hands. He was initially not considered likely to survive. He recovered over the next year, but was left with a permanent limp. Brugha was elected Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann at its first meeting on 21 January 1919, and he read out the Declaration of Independence in Irish, which ratified &quot;the establishment of the Irish Republic&quot;. On the following day, 22 January, he was appointed president of the ministry &quot;pro tempore&quot;. He retained this position until 1 April 1919, when Éamon de Valera took his place.

==Militant republicanism==
===War of Independence===

He proposed a Republican constitution at the 1917 Sinn Féin convention, which was unanimously accepted. In October 1917, he became Chief of Staff of the Irish Republican Army and held that post until March 1918. All through the War of Independence, Brugha continued to run his business as a candle maker. He never went on the run.

He was elected as a Sinn Féin Member of Parliament (MP) for the County Waterford constituency at the 1918 general election. In January 1919, Sinn Féin MPs refused to recognise the Parliament of the United Kingdom and instead assembled at the Mansion House in Dublin as a revolutionary parliament called Dáil Éireann. Owing to the absence of Éamon de Valera and Arthur Griffith, Brugha presided over the first meeting of Dáil Éireann on 21 January 1919.

He had differences with Michael Collins, who, although nominally only the IRA&#x27;s Director of Intelligence, had far more influence in the organisation as a result of his position as a high-ranking member of the IRB, an organisation that Brugha saw as undermining the power of the Dáil and especially the Ministry for Defence. Brugha opposed the oath of allegiance required for membership of the IRB; in 1919, his proposition that all Volunteers should swear allegiance to the Irish Republic and the Dáil was adopted.

At a top-level IRA meeting in August 1920, Brugha argued against ambushes of Crown forces unless there was first a call to surrender, but it was dismissed as unrealistic by the brigade commanders present. Brugha also had the idea of moving the front line of the war to England, but was opposed by Collins. Brugha worked to maintain strict rules of conduct for members of the army and for the treatment of prisoners.

===Civil War===

On 7 January 1922, Brugha voted against the Anglo-Irish Treaty. During the Treaty Debates, he pointed out that Collins had only a middling rank in the Department for Defence, which supervised the IRA, even though Griffith hailed him as &#x27;the man who had won the war&#x27;. It has been argued that, by turning the issue into a vote on Collins&#x27; popularity, Brugha swung the majority against his own side. Frank O&#x27;Connor, in his biography of Collins, states that two delegates who had intended to vote against the Treaty changed sides in sympathy with Collins. After the vote, the anti-Treaty TDs moved into opposition and Brugha was succeeded as Minister for Defence by Richard Mulcahy.

In the months between the Treaty debates and the outbreak of Civil War, Brugha attempted to dissuade his fellow anti-treaty army leaders including Rory O&#x27;Connor, Liam Mellows and Joe McKelvey from taking up arms against the Free State. When the IRA occupied the Four Courts, he and Oscar Traynor called on them to abandon their position. When they refused, Traynor ordered the occupation of the area around O&#x27;Connell Street in the hope of easing the pressure on the Four Courts and of forcing the Free State to negotiate.

On 28 June 1922, Brugha was appointed commandant of the forces in O&#x27;Connell Street. The outbreak of the Irish Civil War ensued in the first week of July when Free State forces commenced shelling of the anti-treaty positions.

Most of the anti-Treaty fighters under Oscar Traynor escaped from O&#x27;Connell Street when the buildings they were holding caught fire, leaving Brugha in command of a small rearguard. On 5 July 1922, he ordered his men to surrender but refused to do so himself. In Thomas Lane he then approached the Free State troops, brandishing a revolver and sustained a bullet wound to the leg which &#x27;severed a major artery causing him to bleed to death&#x27;. He died on 7 July, eleven days before his 48th birthday. He had been re-elected as an anti-Treaty TD at the 1922 general election but died before the Dáil assembled. He is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery.

His wife Caitlín Brugha served as a Sinn Féin TD from 1923 to 1927. His son Ruairí Brugha later became a politician, firstly supporting Clann na Poblachta and later Fianna Fáil, and was elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1973 general election. Ruairí married Máire MacSwiney, the daughter of Terence MacSwiney, the Republican Lord Mayor of Cork who had died on hunger strike in 1920.

==Legacy and commemoration==
Cathal Brugha Street and Cathal Brugha Barracks in Dublin and Cathal Brugha Street in Waterford are named after him. As of 2016, he is survived by his grandson Cathal MacSwiney Brugha and his great-grandson, Air Corps lieutenant Gearóid Ó Briain.

His wife, Caitlín Brugha, survived him, along with their five daughters and his son, Ruairí Brugha. Caitlín was elected as a Sinn Féin TD for Waterford; Ruairí would follow in his father&#x27;s and mother&#x27;s footsteps and become a Fianna Fáil TD in Dublin from 1973 to 1977.

Brugha is mentioned by name in &quot;The Foggy Dew&quot;.

<doc id="297247" wikidata="Q7661175" url="?curid=297247" title="Symbolic communication">
<text>Symbolic communication is the exchange of messages that change &quot;a priori&quot; expectation of events. Examples of this are modern communication technology and the exchange of information amongst animals.
By referring to objects and ideas not present at the time of communication, a world of possibility is opened. In humans, this process has been compounded to result in the current state of modernity. A symbol is anything one says or does to describe something, and that something can have an array of many meanings. Once the symbols are learned by a particular group, that symbol stays intact with the object. Symbolic communication includes gestures, body language and facial expressions, as well as vocal moans that can indicate what an individual wants without having to speak. Research argues that about 55% of all communication stems from nonverbal language. Symbolic communication ranges from sign language to braille to tactile communication skills.

== Models of Communication ==

The Shannon-Weaver Model of communication depicts the most basic communication between two individuals. In this linear process, the sender (source) transmits a message or signal to the receiver, which ultimately will end up going to its destination. The presence of noise within this model arises from disturbances that occur in everyday life. This can be the environment the individuals are in, the people around the individuals or different factors that affect how or if the message is received. The Shannon and Weaver model sets a precedent for symbolic communication, using semantics to create a basis for language. With semantics in play, researchers can understand symbols not only in their own environment, but other symbolic communication strategies as well.

Del Hawkins, a doctoral student from the University of Texas, proposed a model of communication that depicts how symbols, if responded to by an individual, can be used as a conversation. The determinants of this process are the source and the recipient, respectively. The four processes that the source performs in this model are sensing, conceiving, encoding, and transmitting. In response to these, the receiver receives, decodes, and internalizes the information. During this process, the source and receiver take turns communicating, thus letting the model flow cyclically. (See Organizational Theory) Once a symbol is known in a society, it is habitual for an individual to respond to it exactly like how they would previously. If a symbol is given that is not known in one&#x27;s own society, the response will take longer. This is because the individual does not know what the symbol actually means to the source. Because the symbol may have a different meaning to the source and receiver, the individual receiving the information may take longer to process it because they need to figure out what the symbol may mean. They may use context clues or existing knowledge to help decode specific messages.

== Symbolic communication in humans ==

Symbolic communication in humans can be defined as the rule-governed use of a system of arbitrary symbols whose definition and usage are agreed upon by the community of users.

Symbols are considered the signifier that represents meaning (the signified). Not only auditory speech, words, and characters in printed visual forms, physical objects, fashion and clothing, human individuals, and events can be classified as symbols. Any entity, natural or social, physical or mental, tangible or intangible, can be a symbol as long as they can be employed to represent something else.

=== Historical development of symbolic communication ===

The origin of symbolic communication remains a controversial open problem, obscured by the lack of a fossil record. However, it has been speculated that 1.9 million years ago, Homo erectus began the use of pantomime to communicate which allowed our ancestors to transmit information and experiences.

The transition from indexical to symbolic communication is therefore a key evolutionary change because it may signal the origin of language and symbolic thought.

A study conducted in the 1980s by Giacomo Rizzolatti on macaque monkeys discovered a class of neurons later known as the mirror neurons which are activated in response to different actions whether the actions are carried out by ourselves or others. It is one of the neural bases to of connecting to others. These mirror neurons are also known to be activated when “symbolic” representations of actions such as mime, speech and reading are experienced. This allowed our ancestral primates to learn and transmit basic forms of symbolic representations to communicate.

Skills such as hunting, and crafting could then be taught mimetically. The use of pantomimes also allowed them to describe the past, present and future allowing them to reenact events outside of their immediate context. Over time, the amount and complexity of pantomimes evolved, creating a sufficiently mimetic language which allowed the Homo erectus to create a culture which is similar to that of modern humans.

Written communication first emerged through the use of pictograms which slowly developed standardized and simplified forms. Shared writing systems were then developed leading to adaptable alphabets.

=== Modern symbolic communication ===

The vast majority of human communication is symbolic, i.e. there is some degree of arbitrariness between the concept and how it is communicated. Both verbal and nonverbal symbolic communication communicates a meaning that is not the sign itself to the interpreter of the sign.

==== Verbal symbolic communication ====
Verbal communication refers to communication that makes use of words, both written and spoken. Saussure introduced the notion of there being no inherent relation between the use of &quot;cow&quot; in English and &quot;vache&quot; in French to signify the same mental concept of a bovine grass feeder. The arbitrary link between the word, both written and spoken, makes this communication symbolic in nature, as opposed to indexical.

==== Nonverbal symbolic communication ====
Nonverbal symbolic communication uses learned, socially shared signal systems. As with verbal symbolic communication, the relation between the sign and the signified concept is arbitrary. Unlike verbal symbolic communication, however, nonverbal symbolic communication does not make use of words. Instead, icons, indices or symbols may be used.

Nonverbal symbolic communication is not to be confused with nonverbal communication (NVC), which is a broader category that includes nonsymbolic communication as well as symbolic.

==== Nonverbal languages ====
While nonverbal communication is nonlinguistic and does not make use of words, there are certain systems designed for the disabled which, while not using any words, do have their own grammar and are considered linguistic forms of communication.

===== Tactile writing system =====
Braille is a form of tactile writing system. It consists of raised dots of which vary in number and arrangement to represent the letters of the alphabet, punctuation and letter groupings. Braille is read from left to right, with both hands. It allows people who are blind to visualize text through touch.

===== Sign language =====
For people who have hearing difficulties, sign language is sometimes employed to communicate. Sign language makes use of a combination of hand gestures, facial expressions, and body postures. Similar to speech, it has its own grammar and linguistic structure and may vary from each deaf community around the world.

===== Paralanguage =====
Paralanguage is a component of meta-communication that may modify meaning, give nuanced meaning, or convey emotion, by using techniques such as prosody, pitch, volume, intonation, etc. Paralinguistic information, because it is phenomenal, belongs to the external speech signal (Ferdinand de Saussure&#x27;s &quot;parole&quot;) but not to the arbitrary conventional code of language (Saussure&#x27;s &quot;langue&quot;).

===== Paralinguistic digital affordances (PDAs) =====
This is a recent development that includes textual and online actions that seem to mirror the functions of paralanguage. &quot;Likes&quot; and &quot;Favorites&quot; are among the actions considered PDAs, as they contribute to feelings of social support even without the implicit meaning associated with them.This is also sometimes referred to as textual paralanguage (TPL).

=== Challenges to communication ===

==== Symbolic communication in children ====
Young children also use symbolic communication as a means to reference objects or understand other people around them. By the time children are around one year of age, they start to understand the basis of language. Although language and speech start in children around age 2, children can communicate with their parents using perceived symbols they have picked up on. For children who are slower to grasp verbal communication skills, parents can use Augmented and Alternative Communication skills to help foster their child&#x27;s symbols and help them to understand verbal communication.

Children who have delayed speech or other mental illnesses cannot grasp the concept of verbal communication, so they turn to symbol communication. These children may already understand basic symbols like head-nodding for &quot;yes&quot; or head shaking for &quot;no&quot; from watching their parents or others around them. Children who have a hard time speaking cannot demonstrate their literacy skills confluent with other children their age. Parents who take special care in helping their child use by using symbolic communication at first see a huge growth in their speech and communication skills.

==== Language and communication disorders ====
One of the functions of symbolic communication is in the field of communication disorders. It is often used to help facilitate communication between people who have difficulty doing so. There are picture communication systems where often the case that is used with children with little to no speech, tactile writing system also known as braille for the visually impaired and also sign language for the deaf.

Nonsymbolic communication is also used for some people with language and communication disorders, and is often used in the case of people with little to no speech. One of these treatments is PECS, which uses pictures to communicate meaning. The end goal is for the person to be able to communicate with others functionally.

==== Intercultural communication ====
In intercultural communication, problems with symbolic communication may start to arise. Since symbolic communication involves a shared message between a speaker and a listener, words which Items that are seen as sterile and inoffensive in one culture can be polemic or offensive in other cultures. Problems in intercultural communication may arise when people do not respect each other&#x27;s cultures in their communication. Understanding what may cause offense is a key to international or even domestic travel or diplomacy when interacting with people not of one&#x27;s immediate cultural settings.

In verbal communication, language barriers sometime exist. Speakers of different languages will be almost completely unable to communicate with each other unless they share some commonalities. This is because the sounds speakers attach symbols to are usually very different from sounds with similar symbols in other languages. As such, people often struggle to communicate ideas between different cultures. The opposite, similar sounds with differing symbols, can also cause problems. What might be a normal word in one culture might be a taboo word in another culture. To avoid such problems, people will often use euphemisms in place of taboo words.

Paralinguistic cues such as gestures, intonation and facial expressions can aid in cross-cultural communication as they tend to be more similar to each other than words are. There are, however, some gestures can also sometimes be misunderstood across different cultures. For instance, the thumbs-up gesture which sees frequent usage in many countries and is understood as &quot;good&quot;, in other countries such as Greece or the Middle East, this gesture is a negative symbol and making such a gesture can be considered very rude.

Symbols themselves which represent ideas can hold different meanings to different communities. One notable example is the swastika. In Eurasia, some cultures see it as a symbol of divinity and spirituality. However, in the Western world the symbol was flipped and adopted by the German Nazis during World War II and now carries ideas of racism and antisemitism. Wearing this symbol may offend people living there. In 2019, Pichayapa Natha, a member of pop star group BNK48, was slammed for wearing a swastika t-shirt during a rehearsal for a concert.

== Animal societies ==

Communication in animals is usually not symbolic, and the arbitrariness of signs is typically considered the distinguishing factor between human and animal communication. However, research into great ape language has involved teaching chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans to communicate with human beings and with each other using sign language, physical tokens, and lexigrams (Yerkish), which contain some elements of arbitrariness. Some also argue that certain animals are capable of symbolic name usage.

<text>The International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) was an aircraft lessor headquartered in the Constellation Place in Century City, Los Angeles, California, US.

It was the world&#x27;s largest aircraft lessor by value, though ILFC&#x27;s rival, General Electric&#x27;s GECAS unit, had more aircraft. It leased Boeing and Airbus aircraft to major airlines worldwide.

==History==
Father and son team Leslie Gonda and Louis L. Gonda founded ILFC in 1973 along with Steven F. Udvar-Házy. The company was acquired by international insurance giant American International Group (AIG) in 1990, although the unit was still run by Udvar-Hazy until he retired in February 2010, when he was succeeded by vice-chairman Alan Lund. Henri Courpron, a former Airbus executive, was appointed president and CEO of ILFC in May 2010.

On September 2, 2011, AIG filed with the SEC to spin off ILFC in an initial public offering.

In December 2012, AIG announced that it was selling a 90% stake in the company to a consortium of Chinese companies consisting of New China Trust, New China Life Insurance, P3 Investments and the China Aviation Industrial Fund to raise funds to repay its US$182B government bailout.

In August 2013, two of the Chinese companies withdrew their involvement in the deal. AIG had given a deadline for the completion of the deal as August 31, 2013, and alternatives were considered, such as an initial public offering.

On December 16, 2013, AIG announced they were selling its entire stake in ILFC to AerCap Holdings N.V.

==Headquarters==
The ILFC was headquartered in Suite 3400 of the Constellation Place (formerly MGM Tower) in Century City, Los Angeles, California. ILFC has its headquarters on the top six floors of the building, with 290 employees as of March 2013. The CEO&#x27;s penthouse office had a working fireplace.

It stars Jennifer Garner as Sydney Bristow, a double agent for the Central Intelligence Agency posing as an operative for SD-6, a worldwide criminal and espionage organization. Main co-stars throughout all five seasons included Michael Vartan as Michael Vaughn, Ron Rifkin as Arvin Sloane, and Victor Garber as Jack Bristow.

The first two seasons of &quot;Alias&quot; mainly explore Sydney&#x27;s obligation to hide her true career from her friends and family as she assumes multiple aliases to carry out missions as well as her efforts to take down SD-6 with the help of the CIA. The series&#x27; later seasons deal with multiple character and plot driven storylines, with a recurring focus on the search for and recovery of artifacts created by Milo Rambaldi, a fictitious Renaissance-era figure with similarities to both Leonardo da Vinci and Nostradamus.

&quot;Alias&quot; was well received among critics and has been included in several &quot;best of&quot; lists, including the American Film Institute&#x27;s top ten list for television programs in 2003. The series also received numerous awards and nominations. &quot;Alias&quot; is considered to be part of a wave of television series from the late 1990s and early 2000s that feature strong female characters, alongside &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, &quot;Charmed&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot;, &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;, and &quot;Dark Angel&quot;.

==Plot==
===Season 1 (2001–02)===

Seven years before the first episode, Sydney Bristow was an undergraduate student. She was approached by someone who claimed to work for the Central Intelligence Agency and offered her a job as an agent. Having accepted, she was assigned to a unit called SD-6, which she was told was a secret &quot;Black Ops&quot; section of the CIA. She became a field agent. In the pilot, she tells her fiancé Danny Hecht (played by Edward Atterton) that she is a spy and as a result of her revealing SD-6&#x27;s existence to him, Danny is murdered by SD-6. She discovers that her father Jack Bristow is also an SD-6 agent and that SD-6 is not part of the CIA; instead, it is part of the Alliance of Twelve, an organization that is an enemy to the United States. Sydney decides to offer her services to the &quot;real&quot; CIA as a double agent. Having learned that her father is also a double agent for the CIA, she begins the long and arduous task of destroying SD-6 from the inside.

Major plotlines from season 1 include Sydney hiding her triple identity from her friends, both in her personal life and in her SD-6 job, Will Tippin&#x27;s investigation into Danny&#x27;s death, the race to find Milo Rambaldi (a 15th century philosopher with an uncanny understanding of the future) artifacts, and the past activities of Sydney&#x27;s mother. Sub-plots include Sydney&#x27;s friendship with Francie, Francie&#x27;s romantic relationship with Charlie, and Sydney&#x27;s developing relationship with her CIA handler Michael Vaughn, of whom she is skeptical at first but grows to trust as her life becomes increasingly stressful. Season One focuses on the development of Sydney&#x27;s character and allows the audience to become familiar with her.

===Season 2 (2002–03)===
The second season begins with the introduction of Irina Derevko, Sydney&#x27;s mother, who soon becomes a key character in the series. Midway through the second season, the series underwent a &quot;reboot&quot; of sorts with Sydney successfully destroying SD-6 and becoming a regular agent for the CIA, still in pursuit of former SD-6 leader Arvin Sloane, his associate Julian Sark, and the Rambaldi artifacts. Sydney&#x27;s friends at SD-6, Marcus Dixon and Marshall Flinkman, are finally made aware of her dual identity and recruited into the CIA. Sydney also begins a romantic relationship with Vaughn, now that their relationship will not endanger them.

In the second half of the season, it is revealed that Francie Calfo, Sydney&#x27;s best friend, was murdered and replaced by Allison Doren, a woman who was transfigured to look exactly like her. Allison was then in a position to spy on Sydney and Will. The end of the season saw Will possibly murdered and Sydney killing Allison and then falling unconscious. Sydney awakens two years later in Hong Kong, unable to remember the two years that have passed. She soon learns that her friends and the CIA believed her to be dead, and Vaughn found a new love and is now married.

===Season 3 (2003–04)===

The third season takes place two years after the events of season 2, with Sydney having been missing and presumed dead. DNA evidence in a badly burned body confirmed her death to her family and friends. The truth, however, is that Sydney was kidnapped by a terrorist organization called The Covenant, who tried to brainwash her into believing she was an assassin named Julia Thorne. Eventually Sydney voluntarily had her memories of the two years erased in an attempt to forget some of the deeds she was forced to undertake as Julia and to ensure that one of Rambaldi&#x27;s most dangerous artifacts would never be found.

As Sydney recovers, she begins investigating her absence while reintegrating into the CIA. There she deals with the facts that Arvin Sloane had become a world-renowned humanitarian after being pardoned, and that Michael Vaughn had married NSC agent Lauren Reed. Reed is later revealed to be a member of the Covenant and a lover of Julian Sark. The National Security Council plays a role as a government organization that holds massive unsupervised power, with a Guantanamo-like detention facility, considerable influence over the CIA, and driven by questionable motives. Sydney later discovers that her mother and Arvin Sloane had a child together, the result of an affair between the two years before Sydney&#x27;s birth. She locates her half-sister, Nadia, and rescues her from being killed by the Covenant. At the end of the season, Sydney goes on a mission and encounters Lauren. After they battle, Lauren begins to taunt Sydney by saying she has information about her past. When Vaughn shows up, Sydney goes to him, leaving Lauren a chance to attack again. Vaughn shoots Lauren, and she dies, but before she does, she gives Sydney the number of a security deposit box where she can find information about her past.

===Season 4 (2005)===

Season 4 begins where season three ended: with Sydney uncovering a shocking, classified document called &quot;S.A.B. 47 Project.&quot; It is explained that the document authorizes Jack Bristow to execute Sydney&#x27;s mother, who mysteriously placed a contract on Sydney&#x27;s life (this was apparently something of a retcon to cover for actress Lena Olin presumably not returning to the series). The first page refers to Sydney as the &quot;active&quot; subject of a &quot;project&quot; that began on April 17, 1975, a possible reference to Project Christmas, and also setting up Jack as either the real head of (or somehow involved with) the Covenant and/or being a descendant of Rambaldi or Rambaldi himself. Sydney joins a black ops division of the CIA, patterned after SD-6 and run by her one-time nemesis Arvin Sloane. The new division is dubbed &quot;APO&quot;: &quot;Authorized Personnel Only&quot;. Members of APO (all hand-picked by Sloane) include almost all of the recurring characters from previous seasons, including Jack, Vaughn, Sydney&#x27;s former partner (and third-season CIA director) Marcus Dixon, the computer and technical genius, Marshall Flinkman, and Vaughn&#x27;s best friend Eric Weiss (brought in after having to be rescued by Sydney and Vaughn, who he previously believed to have left the CIA). Sloane&#x27;s daughter and Sydney&#x27;s half-sister Nadia Santos also eventually returns to join APO.

During the season, an Arvin Sloane impostor, jokingly identified as &quot;Arvin Clone&quot;, acquired the technology to implement a Rambaldi-predicted apocalypse. Using Omnifam, the real Sloane had polluted the world&#x27;s drinking water with chemicals that caused feelings of peace and tranquility. However, these feelings can be reversed with the Mueller device. The third Derevko sister, Elena, had built a giant Mueller device in Sovogda, Russia, which drove the residents to insanity. Sydney, Jack, Irina, Nadia, and Vaughn parachute in, destroy the device and kill Elena. But Nadia is injected with the tainted water and driven insane. She battles Sydney until Sloane is forced to shoot his own daughter. Nadia is later put into a coma while a cure is sought, and Irina is allowed to escape. The season concludes with Sydney and Vaughn becoming engaged. On a trip to Santa Barbara, Vaughn confides a shocking secret: his name isn&#x27;t really Michael Vaughn; their initial meeting wasn&#x27;t coincidental; and that his allegiance may not be to the CIA. Before he can divulge any more information, another car crashes into theirs and the season ends.

===Season 5 (2005–06)===
As season five begins, Vaughn is abducted. Sydney learns that Vaughn is under suspicion of being a double agent and that the crash may have been a cover for his extraction. Vaughn later escapes and explains to Sydney that his real name is André Michaux. He reveals that he is investigating a secret operation known as Prophet Five, which at one point involved his father. During a mission in recovering a Prophet Five book, Sydney receives a phone call from her doctor with some untimely news – she&#x27;s pregnant. (This development was created to deal with the actress&#x27; real-life pregnancy.) Vaughn is later shot, and apparently killed, on orders of Prophet Five operative Gordon Dean. Four months later, as Sydney continues to investigate Vaughn&#x27;s murder, she works with an assassin and associate of his, Renée Rienne, in order to unearth the inner workings of Prophet Five, while at the same time trailing Dean and his criminal organization &quot;The Shed&quot;, disguised as a black ops CIA division, very much like SD-6.

Two new members are added to APO to replace Weiss, who moved to Washington, D.C. for a new job, and Nadia, who is still in a coma. Thomas Grace is a brash young agent with unorthodox methods who often butts heads with Sydney. Rachel Gibson is a computer specialist who, like Sydney, was deceived into thinking she was working for the real CIA and briefly works as a mole within The Shed, as did Sydney within SD-6, before The Shed&#x27;s destruction by Dean. Sydney&#x27;s mom and dad help her deliver her baby girl while under attack in a high-rise in Vancouver, Canada, on a mission in season 5, episode 11: &quot;Maternal Instinct.&quot; Shortly afterwards, it&#x27;s finally revealed that Vaughn is alive—living and hiding in Nepal. In an ongoing subplot, Arvin Sloane follows his own personal obsession, finding a cure for Nadia. Sloane is jailed for his actions during Season 4; however, he is released after the sentencing committee is manipulated by Dean. In exchange for his freedom, Sloane is now working for Dean as a mole within APO. Unaware of Sloane&#x27;s new allegiance, Jack agrees to let Sloane rejoin APO and use its resources to seek a cure for his daughter.

With the series&#x27; end, it emerges that Sloane&#x27;s ultimate goal is that of immortality, for which he sacrifices his daughter Nadia&#x27;s life. However, he is trapped in Rambaldi&#x27;s tomb by a critically wounded Jack, who sacrifices himself via a bomb to avenge all the pain Sloane caused Sydney over the years. Thus, moments after Sloane achieves immortality, he is trapped for all of eternity in a cave, where even Nadia&#x27;s ghost deserts him. Sydney tracks Sark and the Horizon to Hong Kong, finding Irina. After a final battle between them, Irina plunges to her death. The series ends with a flash forward to several years in the future. Sydney and Vaughn are semi-retired and married, with a second child named Jack in honor of Sydney&#x27;s father. Daughter Isabelle exhibits the same ability to complete the CIA test that marked Sydney&#x27;s inborn skills to be an ideal agent at that age. After Isabelle completes the puzzle, Sydney calls to her from outside, asking what she is doing. She responds by saying, &quot;Nothing&quot;, as she casually knocks it over before running outside to join everyone.

==Cast==
===Main characters===

&quot;Alias&quot; featured an ensemble cast portraying the various people in Sydney&#x27;s life. During the course of the series, every main character becomes involved in the world of espionage in some form or another. 
* Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner), the daughter of Jack Bristow and Irina Derevko, is a graduate student in English in Los Angeles. She moonlights as an operative for SD-6, which she initially believed was a black ops division of the CIA. Her fiancé was murdered in the pilot episode, and she then learned SD-6 is actually a branch of an international criminal organization known as the Alliance of Twelve. She then becomes a double agent for the real CIA. She would later become a member of APO, a black-ops division of the CIA. Sydney has 41 confirmed kills through the series.
* Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin) was the head of SD-6 and APO, the show&#x27;s main antagonist. Originally a loyal CIA officer, he is obsessed with the work of a 15th-century prophet, Milo Rambaldi. Though sometimes showing a genuine affection to the Bristows, he is always ready to hurt them and even kill them, and vice versa.
* Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan) was Sydney&#x27;s CIA handler and later partner. He and Sydney share a mutual attraction, which eventually leads to a relationship. At the end of Season 4, it is revealed that it was not a coincidence that he met Sydney. Despite departing in season 5 as a series regular, Vartan&#x27;s character was still credited as a main cast member in the first episode then special guest star in the latter part of the season.
* Will Tippin (Bradley Cooper) was a reporter for a local newspaper, and he is one of Sydney&#x27;s two best friends. After the death of Sydney&#x27;s fiancé, Will begins to investigate, and eventually learns of the existence of SD-6. The discovery threatens his life, but he later is recruited as an analyst for the CIA. He is put into witness protection at the beginning of Season Three. The character makes occasional guest appearances in later seasons.
* Francie Calfo (Merrin Dungey) is Sydney&#x27;s other best friend. When Season 1 begins, she is Sydney&#x27;s roommate and fellow graduate student. In Season 2, she drops out of her graduate program and opens a restaurant in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles. She remains largely unaware of the spy world until the middle of season two when she is killed, and her identity is stolen by a doppelgänger. She (and her double) also dated Will during the second season.
* Marcus Dixon (Carl Lumbly) is Sydney&#x27;s partner and friend at SD-6. He is the first one to notice signs of Sydney&#x27;s betrayal, but dismisses his thoughts as foolish. During the two-year gap between the second and third season, he became a director at the CIA. However, he later resigns as he thinks the office job just is not for him. Dixon later joins APO.
* Marshall Flinkman (Kevin Weisman) worked in tech support at SD-6. He takes up the same role in the CIA and at APO. Even though he is not field-trained, he has participated in missions on several occasions.
* Jack Bristow (Victor Garber) is Sydney&#x27;s father, and also works for SD-6, but he is actually a double agent for the CIA. In Season 1, his relationship with Sydney is strained. He was devastated by her mother&#x27;s &quot;death,&quot; and kept Sydney at arm&#x27;s length for the rest of her childhood. As a CIA agent, he is exceptionally ruthless and skillful as evidenced by his CIA call sign, &quot;Raptor.&quot; After Sloane left, Jack took over as head of APO.
* Eric Weiss (Greg Grunberg) is a friend of Vaughn&#x27;s, and also a CIA agent. He later forges a relationship with Sydney&#x27;s sister, Nadia. Against his over-the-top colleagues, he keeps a more human and gentle demeanor.
* Julian Sark (David Anders) is originally introduced as an operative working for Sydney&#x27;s mother, but he later proves to be an antagonist on his own. He has an instinct for self-preservation, thus making his loyalty flexible. During the third season, he becomes the partner-in-crime of Vaughn&#x27;s wife, Lauren, and eventually begins a relationship with her.
* Irina Derevko (Lena Olin) was a former Russian spy, and she is also the mother of Sydney Bristow. During the 1970s, she was sent to the United States, with the objective to seduce and marry Jack Bristow so she could steal information from him about a project he was working on. She has also assassinated several CIA officers, including Vaughn&#x27;s father.
* Lauren Reed (Melissa George) is a NSC liaison at the CIA and marries Vaughn during the two-year gap between the second and third season. She is later revealed to be a mole sent by The Covenant to watch over Vaughn should Sydney contact him during her involvement with them and also to steal crucial information from the CIA.
* Nadia Santos (Mía Maestro) is Sydney&#x27;s half-sister, and the daughter of Irina Derevko and Arvin Sloane. Introduced at the end of the third season, she is &quot;The Passenger,&quot; a person who provides a direct line to Rambaldi. Prior to joining the CIA, she worked for the Argentine Intelligence.
* Rachel Gibson (Rachel Nichols) is a computer genius introduced at the beginning of Season Five as an operative working for an organization that poses as the CIA, known as The Shed. Unaware of this, she indirectly helps to apparently kill Michael Vaughn. After the truth is revealed to her, she joins the CIA in order to take down the organization that had lied to her, much like Sydney did years before.
* Thomas Grace (Balthazar Getty) is an operative who is hired by Jack to join APO after the apparent death of Michael Vaughn. Years ago, his wife was shot and killed by an assassin who was intending to kill him.
* Renée Rienne (Élodie Bouchez) is an international terrorist known as &quot;The Raven,&quot; who worked for years with Vaughn to investigate a group of people known as &quot;The Prophet Five.&quot; After Vaughn&#x27;s assassination by the Prophet Five, she allies with Sydney to take down the group.
* Kelly Peyton (Amy Acker) is a friend and former colleague of Rachel&#x27;s. She works for The Shed, and later directly for the Prophet Five. Together with the Derevko sisters, or maybe more, she is the most ruthless character of the show.

===Recurring characters===
Characters are listed in order of appearance on the show.

In addition, &quot;Alias&quot; also featured many other famous actors in roles ranging from single-episode guest appearances to semi-recurring characters, including Jonathan Banks as Frederick Brandon, Raymond J. Barry as Senator George Reed, Tobin Bell as Karl Dreyer, Peter Berg as Noah Hicks, David Carradine as Conrad, David Cronenberg as Dr. Brezzel, Faye Dunaway as Ariana Kane, Griffin Dunne as Leonid Lisenker, Vivica A. Fox as Toni Cummings, Ricky Gervais as Daniel Ryan, John Hannah as Martin Shepard, Rutger Hauer as Anthony Geiger, Ethan Hawke as James Lennox, Djimon Hounsou as Kazari Bomani, Richard Lewis as Mitchell Yaeger, Peggy Lipton as Olivia Reed, Sir Roger Moore as Edward Poole, Richard Roundtree as Thomas Brill, Jason Segel as Sam Hauser, Christian Slater as Neil Caplan, Quentin Tarantino as McKenas Cole, Justin Theroux as Simon Walker, Keone Young as Professor Choy, and Danny Trejo as Emilio Vargas.

==Production and crew==
Produced by Touchstone Television and Bad Robot, film production primarily took place in the greater Los Angeles area. Studio shooting primarily took place at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California, along with some outdoor shots around Los Angeles, including in Griffith Park. The U.S. Bank Tower filled in for CIA headquarters. Despite its worldwide locales, only one episode was ever filmed outside the Los Angeles region, in Las Vegas, Nevada at the Aladdin Casino and Resort.
* J. J. Abrams – executive producer
* John Eisendrath – executive producer (Season 1–3)
* Alex Kurtzman – executive producer (Season 2–3) 
* Roberto Orci – executive producer (Season 2–3)
* Jeffrey Bell – executive producer (Season 4–5)
* Jeff Pinkner – executive producer (Season 5)
* Jesse Alexander – executive producer (Season 5)

The series premiered the same month as the September 11 attacks. In an interview in advance of the show&#x27;s release, Abrams told the &quot;New York Times&quot; that the show was not meant to be a realistic account of how the agency operates: &quot;The truth can be inspiring and take you places, but I&#x27;m more interested in what I believe to be true and what works for the story than in doing a documentary on Langley procedure.&quot; He also said that he came up with the idea for the show while in the &quot;Felicity&quot; writers room, recalling, &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t it be really cool if Felicity were recruited by the C.I.A.? Then she&#x27;d find strength she didn&#x27;t know she had and she wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell her friends about it.&quot;

==Themes==
* Family: Describing the family aspects of the show, Garner stated that &quot;Alias&quot; is about &quot;this woman and her father and trying to figure out what is always a complicated relationship in the context of life and death at work.&quot;
* Prophecy: A good deal of &quot;Alias&quot; revolves around the prophecies of Milo Rambaldi. The viewer is first introduced to a prophecy about a woman who will &quot;render the greatest power unto utter desolation&quot;. Later, as Sloane completes part of the Rambaldi prophecy he has received his own prophetic message. The Rambaldi storyline seemed to come to a close with the conclusion of Elena Derevko&#x27;s endgame at the end of season four, but the fifth season introduced its own &quot;prophet&quot; (also in pursuit of Rambaldi) in the form of the mysterious organization known as Prophet Five, which ended up being a reference to Rambaldi and the final part of his endgame, immortality, which had been set up in the first season, though this was only one part of his plan. The first part was world peace, which Elena Derevko perverted and attempted in Season 4.
* Trust and betrayal: Much of the first three seasons of the show revolved around issues of trust and betrayal. Most obvious is the betrayal of Sydney by SD-6 which starts the show. However, the show includes numerous other examples of betrayal including Irina&#x27;s betrayal of Jack, Sloane&#x27;s betrayal of the Alliance, Sydney&#x27;s betrayal of SD-6 and Sydney&#x27;s lying to her friends. The first season can be viewed as a story of Sydney learning to trust her father and the second season can be viewed as Sydney struggling with trust issues relating to her mother.
* Clandestine operations: The government agencies that Sydney works for are conducting secret operations in various countries regularly. The same applies of course to the mentioned illegal agencies which are battled against. Those clandestine operations deal with collecting the sought-after Rambaldi artifacts, but also with aspects like illegal arms trade or blackmailing. To further their objectives, the CIA or APO, respectively, arrest criminals from other countries and bring them to interrogation facilities of the CIA.

Laura Goldsmith was the costume designer and she received one Costume Designers Guild Award nomination.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the first season has an approval rating of 84%, based on 37 reviews, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;With dazzling action sequences, fine writing, and believable characters, &quot;Alias&quot; sets &#x27;em up and knocks &#x27;em down as solid escapist television, even if the narrative grows confusing at times.&quot; The second season holds an approval rating of 90%, based on 10 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. The third season holds an approval rating of 83%, based on 6 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. For the fourth season, 75% of 6 critics gave a positive review, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Alias&quot; enters its fourth season having seemingly run out of rabbits to pull out of the hat, but Jennifer Garner&#x27;s charm and a whizz-bang sensibility keeps these spy games fun.&quot; The fifth season holds an approval rating of 100%, based on 7 reviews, with an average rating of 8.8/10.

The New York edition of &quot;Time Out&quot; listed the show in their top 50 TV shows of the decade 2000 – 2009. &quot;Alias&quot; also appeared in UGO.com&#x27;s list of Top 50 TV Shows of All Time. In 2010, Kristin dos Santos of E! ranked it number 4 on her list, &quot;Top 20 TV Series of the Past 20 Years&quot;.

===U.S. television ratings===
Seasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of &quot;Alias&quot; on ABC.

The season 2 episode &quot;Phase One&quot; aired as a lead-out for Super Bowl XXXVII. Despite earning critical acclaim from &quot;USA Today&quot;, and achieving series-high ratings of 17.4 million viewers, it was unable to fully benefit from the post-Super Bowl time slot due to ABC airing a 40-minute post-game show (unusually long even by Super Bowl standards), which pushed its start time past 11:00 p.m. ET. The episode retained only 19 percent of the Super Bowl audience, and has the dubious distinction of earning the lowest overall ratings for a program airing after a Super Bowl since at least 1987, and the lowest rating ever (8.3 rating) in the age 18–49 demographic for a post-Super Bowl program, until &quot;Elementary&quot; in 2013.

Its ratings peak was reached in its fourth season, when ABC moved the program to Wednesday, in a 9:00 p.m. time slot following another (yet more successful) J. J. Abrams&#x27; drama, &quot;Lost&quot;, while airing the season&#x27;s episodes in (almost) consecutive weeks beginning with the January 5, 2005, 2-hour season premiere (watched by 15.8 million viewers; the second most-watched episode in the series) and ending in May 2005. However, the fourth season was the only season in which this near-consecutive-week schedule was used, and the increase in audience numbers was minimal, as it faced competition from the results broadcasts of season 4 of &quot;American Idol&quot;, then nearing the peak of its popularity.

Coming off its most-watched season, &quot;Alias&quot; was moved to Thursdays at 8:00 p.m. in the fall of 2005 by ABC in an effort to invigorate the network&#x27;s weak Thursday-night lineup. However, the move proved unsuccessful for the series, receiving the lowest viewership in the show&#x27;s history. &quot;Alias&quot; became another scripted show in the history of ABC to not survive more than a year in this timeslot since &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot; was cancelled in 1982. In November 2005, ABC announced that the current fifth season of &quot;Alias&quot; would be its final one. ABC then temporarily aired &quot;Alias&quot; on Wednesdays at 10 p.m. in December, receiving the lead-in support of &quot;Lost&quot;.

The ABC network gave the show a 4-month hiatus (allowing Jennifer Garner to give birth to her first child); however, when it was brought back in April 2006, its new time slot was Wednesdays at 8:00 p.m. Notwithstanding, the viewer numbers still remained dismal, culminating in a 2-hour series finale airing on Monday, May 22, 2006 (broadcast against both the season finales of the hit dramas, Fox&#x27;s &quot;24&quot; and CBS&#x27; &quot;&quot;) which attracted 6.68 million viewers. In comparison, the first season averaged 9.7 million viewers.

=== Cultural influence ===
In August 2003, the actual CIA enlisted Jennifer Garner to appear in a recruitment video, which would be shown at fairs and college campuses. A CIA officer said: &quot;Jennifer and the character of Sydney Bristow both reflect a lot of the qualities we look for in new career field officers.&quot;

====Parodies====
The &quot;Alias&quot; production team has participated in at least two spoofs based upon the series and featuring cast members.
* The first was produced in 2002 for a segment of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; in which Sydney (Jennifer Garner) is ordered by Sloane (Ron Rifkin) to infiltrate the locker room of the Washington Redskins NFL team in order to steal the coach&#x27;s playbook. Syd disguises herself as a cheerleader and distracts the &quot;Hogettes&quot;, a group of Redskins fans, with a glass of beer before stealing the book. Upon returning to SD-6 headquarters, she is horrified to find Sloane wearing a pig mask and oinking. This skit was advertised as being included in the season 2 DVD box set, but it was dropped from the set at the last minute, presumably due to copyright reasons. Another specially filmed &quot;MNF&quot; segment featuring Garner was included in the season 3 DVD set, but this was not, strictly speaking, a spoof.
* Another faux &quot;Alias&quot; &quot;episode&quot; was produced for a 2003 TV special celebrating the 50th anniversary of ABC. Featuring most of the regular cast of the series, the skit began with Jack Bristow preparing Sydney and Vaughn for a mission, and informing them that they will have a new partner – Detective Columbo (Peter Falk). Columbo, in his usual eccentric behavior, proceeds to wreak havoc at CIA headquarters, accidentally shooting Vaughn with an anesthetic dart and volunteering to wear a skimpy bikini intended for Sydney during the mission. Columbo reveals that his mission is not to aid the CIA but rather to help Walt Disney Company/ABC head Michael Eisner better understand the show. His work completed, Columbo departs, leaving Jack to utter a confused, &quot;Dear God, that was strange.&quot;

Other spoofs and humorous references include:
* In an episode of Bradley Cooper&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Kitchen Confidential&quot;, Michael Vartan guests as a rival French chef. Cooper&#x27;s character makes a quip along the lines of, &quot;it&#x27;s almost like we used to work together&quot;.
* &quot;MADtv&quot; created a season 1 spoof.
* In episode 23 of &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, the series is re-imagined with the part of Sydney being played by a killer whale (&quot;Whalias&quot;), complete with red hair and lipstick. The sketch features Sydney undercover in a glamorous party at SeaWorld, pretending to be a prize-winning cellist. A fight scene occurs in typical &quot;Alias&quot; style.
* In episode 57 of &quot;Kim Possible&quot; the characters (due to the use of a Pan-Dimension Vortex) find themselves appearing in various fictional television shows similar to the main plot point of the movie &quot;The Last Action Hero&quot;. Each of these television shows is clearly a spoof of a real world television show. During one such &quot;appearance&quot;, Kim lands in a night club where she is confronted by a character with bright red hair. The character orders Kim to &quot;Tell me what I want to know.&quot; In response, Kim addresses the character as &quot;Miss Tries Too Hard.&quot; and adds &quot;Nice Wig.&quot; A brief &quot;Alias&quot;-like hand-to-hand fight sequence then ensues. The end of the segment involves characters talking about &quot;The Device.&quot; In the context of the episode, the device is &quot;The Pan-Dimensional Vortex Inducer&quot;, but asking about a &quot;device&quot; would also track with the plot of many &quot;Alias&quot; episodes.

==Reboot==
In May 2010, &quot;E! Online&quot; Kristin dos Santos reported that ABC was toying with the idea of rebooting &quot;Alias&quot;, but getting rid of the mythological Rambaldi elements to make the storylines more accessible for a mainstream audience. Subsequently, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; columnist Michael Ausiello confirmed that ABC was in the early stages of developing a reboot, but that the potential series probably would not make it beyond the development phase.

===Soundtracks===
Varèse Sarabande released a season one soundtrack containing 26 tracks. These tracks were used in the show, including the opening theme. All of them are composed by Michael Giacchino, except for the opening theme which was composed by J. J. Abrams. The tracks share a similar dance genre, however a few tracks, such as &quot;In the Garden&quot; share more of a slowed down tempo. A second soundtrack was also released containing music from the second season, but did not receive as much praise as the first soundtrack. A soundtrack for &quot;Alias: The Video Game&quot;, composed by Chris Tilton (who also provided additional music for later episodes of the TV series), was also released, but can only be downloaded online.

The original soundtrack was removed from the versions of the show available on streaming services such as Tubi. DVDs appear to have the original soundtrack on them.

===Video game===

The video game &quot;Alias&quot;, based on the series, is a third-person stealth action title developed and released by Acclaim Entertainment for the PC, PlayStation 2 and Xbox. The plot was written by the creators of the show and the game features the voices of the cast principals. It was released on April 6, 2004, and has a rating of T for Teen. The game is set between episodes 19 and 20 of season 2. The game allows the player to be Sydney (and briefly on one mission Vaughn), and sends her on various missions to many different locations. The missions become more difficult as you come closer to finishing the game. The game includes using many spy-skills that Sydney uses in the show.

Prior to the Acclaim release, ABC Television produced an episodic downloadable video game &quot;Alias: Underground&quot; which is available through ABC&#x27;s website. The game was a 3D third-person stealth action game much like the Acclaim production, with missions released monthly during the original broadcast of the TV show&#x27;s second season.

===Original novels===
A number of original novels based upon the series have been published, primarily for a teenage reading audience. Due to the intricate and story arc-based nature of the series, most novels published to date have been prequels to the series, some focusing on Sydney in her early missions for SD-6, and others focusing on Vaughn&#x27;s missions before meeting her. Their canon status with regards to the televised series has yet to be determined. Although aimed at young readers, the books tackle serious subject matter, such as one volume which details the first time Sydney kills someone.

<doc id="297252" wikidata="Q16257468" url="?curid=297252" title="Sir Richard Grenville, 1st Baronet">
<text>Sir Richard Grenville (26 June 1600 – 21 October 1659) was a professional soldier from Cornwall, who served in the Thirty Years War, and 1638 to 1651 Wars of the Three Kingdoms. He was the younger brother of Sir Bevil Grenville, who died at Lansdowne in 1643, and grandson of Admiral Sir Richard, killed at Flores in 1591.

He began his military career during the 1618 to 1624 Bohemian Revolt, an early phase of the Thirty Years War, then served under the Duke of Buckingham. In 1628, he became MP for Fowey, and married Mary Fitz, a well-connected and wealthy widow; they divorced in 1632, and he was imprisoned for debt. In 1633, he escaped to Europe; from 1634 to 1639, he fought with the Swedes, then the Dutch Republic, before returning home to take part in the Bishops Wars. He served in Ireland from 1642 to 1643, followed by a brief spell with the Parliamentarian army, before defecting to the Royalists in March 1644.

He spent the rest of the war in the West Country; arrested for insubordination by Sir Ralph Hopton in early 1646, he was released when the Royalists surrendered in March. His feud with the Earl of Clarendon meant he was barred from the exiled court of Charles II and died in Ghent on 21 October 1659. Although his negative portrayal in Clarendon&#x27;s &#x27;History of the Rebellion&#x27; was undoubtedly affected by their personal conflict, he was loathed by many on both sides for his brutality and greed. A modern assessment is that while a courageous and competent soldier, capable of inspiring great loyalty, this was offset by a narrow focus on his own self-interest, and violent temper.

==Personal details==
Richard Grenville was one of two surviving children of Sir Bernard Grenville (1567–1636), and Elizabeth Bevill (1564–1636), and grandson of the Elizabethan hero, Sir Richard Grenville. His elder brother was Sir Bevil Grenville, a Royalist hero killed at Lansdowne in July 1643.

In 1628, he became the fourth husband of Lady Mary Fitz, a wealthy and well connected widow. She was engaged in a legal dispute with her former brother-in-law, the Earl of Suffolk, who refused to return the property she brought to her previous marriage. Despite the courts ruling in her favour, Suffolk refused to accept the judgment, drawing Grenville into an expensive legal dispute. Based on this, Mary insisted on a pre-nuptial agreement, an unusual provision for the period that soon led to conflict. Although they had two children, Richard (ca 1630–1657?), and Elizabeth (1631-after 1671), the marriage collapsed under the strain of legal costs, exacerbated by Grenville&#x27;s own extravagance. To secure her own position, Mary allied with her former antagonist, Suffolk, and divorced Grenville.

==Career==
===1618 to 1640; the Thirty Years War===
Little is known of Grenville&#x27;s early life; it is thought he attended Exeter College, Oxford, like his brother, but he does not appear in their records. Like many younger sons, he adopted a military career; from 1618 to 1623, he served under Horace Vere in the Dutch war with Spain, and the Palatinate campaign. His colleagues included future Civil War generals Sir Ralph Hopton and William Waller; it appears likely all three were members of the English garrison of Frankenthal, which surrendered to the Catholic League in March 1623.

On his return to England, Grenville took part in naval expeditions against Cádiz in 1625, Saint-Martin-de-Ré in 1627, and La Rochelle in 1628. All three were expensive disasters, but brought him to the attention of Charles I&#x27;s favourite, the Duke of Buckingham. With his support, in 1628 Grenville became Member of Parliament for Fowey, Cornwall.

Although Buckingham&#x27;s assassination in August 1628 deprived Grenville of his patron, in November he married Mary Fitz, heir to Fitzford House, in Devon. He used her money to purchase a baronetcy, and fund an extravagant lifestyle; both were strong-willed individuals, and frequently quarrelled. Suffolk came to an agreement with Lady Mary, who divorced Grenville, and the two sued him for slander, demanding £8,000 in damages. Unable to pay, he was imprisoned for debt in March 1632.

He escaped in 1633, and fled to the Dutch Republic, where he studied mathematics at Leiden University, a subject popular with professional soldiers, due to its applications in siege warfare. Over the next five years, he served with the Swedish army in Germany, then the Dutch Scots Brigade, which was commanded by his distant relative, the Earl of Leicester. In 1639, he returned to England to join the Royal army assembled for the Bishops Wars; in return, Charles voided his 1632 conviction.

===1640 to 1646; the Civil War===

In February 1642, Grenville was part of the army sent to suppress the Irish Rebellion, where he gained a reputation as a competent, but ruthless leader, and was appointed governor of Trim, County Meath. As a result, he missed the early stages of the First English Civil War, which began in August 1642. In June 1643, the rebels agreed a truce with Ormond, leader of the Irish Royalists, formally confirmed in September when both sides signed a Cessation of Arms. The truce released Royalist troops for use in England, including Grenville. One suggestion is the death of his elder brother at Lansdowne in July provided an opportunity to assume leadership of the Royalist movement in Cornwall, which was intensely local.

However, when he arrived in Liverpool in August, he was arrested by Parliamentarian troops and sent to London. The Irish regiments had not been paid for over a year, and Parliament promised to fund the arrears of any soldier who joined them. In return for swearing loyalty, Grenville received his wages and was appointed Lieutenant-General of Horse in the Army of the South Eastern Association, led by his former colleague, William Waller. However, in March 1644, he defected to the Royalists, who put him in charge of the siege of Plymouth; he also participated in their victory at Lostwithiel in September.

As in Ireland, Grenville soon gained a reputation for brutality, especially his treatment of Parliamentarian prisoners at Lydford and Tavistock, while seizing any opportunity for self-enrichment. However, he also insisted on paying his troops on time; unlike Hopton and others, he did not allow them to take &#x27;free quarter&#x27;, and prevented plundering. As the war turned against the Royalists, internal conflict increased; Grenville refused orders from Prince Rupert to support an attack on Taunton, then quarrelled with Lord Goring, commander of the Western Army. In July, he resigned his command; when he did so, most of the Cornish levies also deserted, and refused pleas from Goring to support his resistance to the advancing New Model Army.

By the end of 1645, the Royalists in the West Country were close to defeat, and Grenville proposed setting up an autonomous Cornwall, under the Prince of Wales, and negotiating a truce with Parliament. He positioned local troops along the River Tamar, which formed the boundary between Cornwall and Devon, and issued instructions to keep &quot;all foreign troops out of Cornwall&quot;, including Royalist remnants under Lord Goring.

This strategy was unacceptable to his superiors, and displayed his characteristic inability to appreciate the wider political perspective. When Hopton replaced Goring as commander in the West, Grenville refused to serve under him; in January 1646, he was arrested for insubordination and imprisoned on St Michael&#x27;s Mount. He was released when Hopton surrendered in March and allowed to escape into exile, since he was likely to be executed if he fell into Parliamentarian hands.

===1646 to 1659; Exile and death===
He joined the exiled Court in Jersey, and was one of those excluded by Parliament from pardon. After the execution of Charles I in 1649, Charles II appointed him Lieutenant-General under the Marquess of Hertford for a proposed Western Rising that never took place. In 1653, he became involved in an unsuccessful conspiracy against the Earl of Clarendon, and banished from court.

He spent the next few years in Italy and the Netherlands, and made a secret visit to England, apparently in hopes of retrieving his property. In 1654, he published his &quot;Single defence against all aspersions of all malignant persons&quot;, giving his version of events in the West; in 1736, it appeared in the &quot;Works of George Grenville, Lord Lansdowne&quot;. It was intended to offset Clarendon&#x27;s &quot;The History of the Rebellion&quot;, although the first volume of the &#x27;History&#x27; only covered the period to March 1644; the second volume, with details of Grenville&#x27;s service, was not completed until 1671.

At some point in the 1650s, his son Richard died, and in 1657, he was joined in exile by his daughter Elizabeth, who thus became involved in his ongoing legal battle with the Howards. He died on 21 October 1659, and was buried at Ghent, in the Spanish Netherlands; the grave has since disappeared.

His nephew John Granville (1628–1701), was a leading figure in the 1660 Restoration. Like his uncle, he incurred enormous debts in a legal dispute; his heir committed suicide on discovering their extent. Elizabeth was still alive in 1671, when she appears in her mother&#x27;s will; it is suggested she married a Royalist sea-captain, but details are scarce.

==Appearances in Literature==
The author Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s novel &quot;The King&#x27;s General&quot; (April 1946) tells the story of Sir Richard Grenville&#x27;s life and exile, introducing fictional characters but based strongly on historical facts.

<doc id="297255" wikidata="Q1396169" url="?curid=297255" title="Susanna Moodie">
<text>Susanna Moodie ( Strickland; 6 December 1803 – 8 April 1885) was an English-born Canadian author who wrote about her experiences as a settler in Canada, which was a British colony at the time.

==Family==
Susanna Moodie was born in Bungay, on the River Waveney in Suffolk. She was one of the youngest sister in a family of writers, including Agnes Strickland, Jane Margaret Strickland and Catharine Parr Traill.

==Early career==
She wrote her first children&#x27;s book in 1822 and published other children&#x27;s stories in London, including books about Spartacus and Jugurtha. In London she was also involved in the abolitionist organization Anti-Slavery Society, transcribing the narrative of the former Caribbean slave Mary Prince. 

==Marriage and move to Upper Canada==

On 4 April 1831, she married John Moodie, a retired officer who had served in the Napoleonic Wars.

In 1832, with her husband, a British Army officer, and daughter, Moodie immigrated to Upper Canada. The family settled on a farm in Douro township, near Lakefield, north of Peterborough, where her brother Samuel Strickland (1804–1867) worked as a surveyor, and where artifacts are housed in a museum. Founded by Samuel, the museum was formerly an Anglican church and overlooks the Otonabee River where Susanna once canoed. It also displays artifacts concerning Samuel, as well as her elder sister and fellow writer Catharine, who married a friend of John Moodie&#x27;s and immigrated to the same area a few weeks before Susanna and John.

Moodie continued to write in Canada, and her letters and journals contain valuable information about life in the colony. She observed life in what was then the backwoods of Ontario, including native customs, the climate, the wildlife, relations between the Canadian population and recent American settlers, and the strong sense of community and the communal work, known as &quot;bees&quot; (which she, incidentally, hated). She suffered through the economic depression in 1836, and her husband served in the militia against William Lyon Mackenzie in the Upper Canada Rebellion in 1837.

As a middle-class Englishwoman, Moodie did not particularly enjoy &quot;the bush&quot;, as she called it. In 1840, she and her husband moved to Belleville, which she referred to as &quot;the clearings.&quot; She studied the Family Compact and became sympathetic to the moderate reformers led by Robert Baldwin, while remaining critical of radical reformers such as William Lyon Mackenzie. This caused problems for her husband, who shared her views, but, as sheriff of Belleville, had to work with members and supporters of the Family Compact.

==Memoirist==

In 1852, she published the memoir &quot;Roughing it in the Bush&quot;, detailing her experiences on the farm in the 1830s. In 1853, she published her second memoir, &quot;Life in the Clearings Versus the Bush&quot;, about her time in Belleville. She remained in Belleville, living with various family members (particularly her son Robert) after her husband&#x27;s death, and lived to see Canadian Confederation. She died in Toronto, Ontario on 8 April 1885 and is buried in Belleville Cemetery.

Her greatest literary success was &quot;Roughing it in the Bush&quot;. The inspiration for the memoir came from a suggestion by her editor that she write an &quot;emigrant&#x27;s guide&quot; for British people looking to move to Canada. Moodie wrote of the trials and tribulations she found as a &quot;New Canadian&quot;, rather than the advantages to be had in the colony. She claimed that her intention was not to discourage immigrants but to prepare people like herself, raised in relative wealth and with no prior experience as farmers, for what life in Canada would be like.

==Family legacy in illustration==
Moodie taught her daughter Agnes how to paint flowers. Agnes later illustrated &quot;Canadian Wild Flowers&quot;, published in 1868.

===Recognition===
Moodie&#x27;s books and poetry inspired Margaret Atwood&#x27;s collection of poetry, &quot;The Journals of Susanna Moodie&quot;, published in 1970. It was also an important influence on one of Atwood&#x27;s later novels, &quot;Alias Grace&quot;, based on an account of murder convict Grace Marks which appeared in &quot;Life in the Clearings Versus the Bush&quot;. She has also been a source of inspiration for Carol Shields, who published a critical analysis of Moodie&#x27;s work, &quot;Susanna Moodie: Voice and Vision&quot;. Additionally, the central character of Shields&#x27; novel, &quot;Small Ceremonies&quot;, is working on a biography of Moodie.

====Commemorative postage stamp====
On 8 September 2003, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the National Library of Canada, Canada Post released a special commemorative series, &quot;The Writers of Canada&quot;, with a design by Katalina Kovats, featuring two English-Canadian and two French-Canadian stamps. Three million stamps were issued. Moodie and her sister Catherine Parr Traill were featured on one of the English-Canadian stamps.

<doc id="297256" wikidata="Q315475" url="?curid=297256" title="Lin Biao">
<text>Lin Biao (; 5 December 1907 – 13 September 1971) was a Chinese politician and Marshal of the People&#x27;s Republic of China who was pivotal in the Communist victory during the Chinese Civil War, especially in Northeast China from 1946 to 1949. Lin was the general who commanded the decisive Liaoshen and Pingjin campaigns, in which he co-led the Manchurian Field Army to victory and led the People&#x27;s Liberation Army into Beijing. He crossed the Yangtze River in 1949, decisively defeated the Kuomintang and took control of the coastal provinces in Southeast China. He ranked third among the Ten Marshals. Zhu De and Peng Dehuai were considered senior to Lin, and Lin ranked directly ahead of He Long and Liu Bocheng.

Lin abstained from taking an active role in politics after the war ceased in 1949. He led a section of the government&#x27;s civil bureaucracy as one of the co-serving Vice Premiers of the People&#x27;s Republic of China from 1954 onwards, becoming First Vice Premier from 1964. Lin became more active in politics when named one of the co-serving Vice Chairmen of the Chinese Communist Party in 1958. He held the three responsibilities of Vice Premier, Vice Chairman and Minister of National Defense from 1959 onwards. To date, Lin is the longest serving Minister of National Defense of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Lin became instrumental in creating the foundations for Mao Zedong&#x27;s cult of personality in the early 1960s, and was rewarded for his service in the Cultural Revolution by being named Mao&#x27;s designated successor as the sole Vice Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, from 1966 until his death.

Lin died on 13 September 1971, when a Hawker Siddeley Trident he was aboard crashed in Öndörkhaan in Mongolia. The exact events of this &quot;Lin Biao incident&quot; have been a source of speculation ever since. The Chinese government&#x27;s official explanation is that Lin and his family attempted to flee following a botched coup against Mao. Others have argued that they fled out of fear they would be purged, as Lin&#x27;s relationship with other Communist Party leaders had soured in the final few years of his life. Following Lin&#x27;s death, he was officially condemned as a traitor by the Communist Party. Since the late 1970s, Lin and the wife of Mao, Jiang Qing, have been labeled the two major &quot;counter-revolutionary forces&quot; of the Cultural Revolution, receiving official blame from the Chinese government for the worst excesses of that period.

==Revolutionary==
===Youth===

Lin Biao was the son of a prosperous merchant family in Huanggang, Hubei. His name at birth was &quot;Lin Yurong&quot;. Lin&#x27;s father opened a small handicrafts factory in the mid-late 1910s, but was forced to close the factory due to &quot;heavy taxes imposed by local militarists&quot;. After closing the factory, Lin&#x27;s father worked as a purser aboard a river steamship. Lin entered primary school in 1917, and moved to Shanghai in 1919 to continue his education. As a child, Lin was much more interested in participating in student movements than in pursuing his formal education. Lin transferred to Wuchang Gongjin High School () at 15. Lin joined a satellite organization of the Communist Youth League before he graduated high school in 1925. Later in 1925 he participated in the May Thirtieth Movement and enrolled in the newly established Whampoa (Huangpu) Military Academy in Guangzhou.

As a young cadet, Lin admired the personality of Chiang Kai-shek (Jiang Jieshi), who was then the principal of the academy. At Whampoa, Lin also studied under Zhou Enlai, who was eight years older than Lin. Lin had no contact with Zhou after their time in Whampoa, until they met again in Yan&#x27;an in the late 1930s. Lin&#x27;s relationship with Zhou was never especially close, but they rarely opposed each other directly.

After graduating from Whampoa in 1926, Lin was assigned to a regiment commanded by Ye Ting. Less than a year after graduating from Whampoa, he was assigned to the Northern Expedition, where he rose from deputy platoon leader to battalion commander within a few months. During this time Lin joined the Communist Party. By 1927 Lin was a colonel.

When he was twenty, Lin married a girl from the countryside with the family name &quot;Ong&quot;. This marriage was arranged by Lin&#x27;s parents, and the couple never became close. When Lin left the Kuomintang to become a communist revolutionary, Ong did not accompany Lin, and their marriage effectively ended.

===Chinese Civil War===
After the Kuomintang-Communist split, Lin&#x27;s commander, Ye Ting, joined forces with He Long and participated in the Nanchang Uprising on 1 August 1927. During the campaign Lin worked as a company commander under a regiment led by Chen Yi. Following the failure of the revolt, Lin escaped to the remote Communist base areas, and joined Mao Zedong and Zhu De in the Jiangxi–Fujian Soviet in 1928. After joining forces with Mao, Lin became one of Mao&#x27;s closest supporters.

Lin became one of the most senior military field commanders within the Jiangxi Soviet. He commanded the First Army Group, and achieved a degree of power comparable to that of Peng Dehuai, who commanded the Third Army Group. According to Comintern representative Otto Braun, Lin was &quot;politically... a blank sheet on which Mao could write as he pleased&quot; during this period. After Mao was removed from power in 1932 by his rivals (the 28 Bolsheviks), Lin frequently attended strategic meetings in Mao&#x27;s name and openly attacked the plans of Mao&#x27;s enemies.

Within the Jiangxi Soviet, Lin&#x27;s First Army Group was the best-equipped and arguably most successful force within the Red Army. Lin&#x27;s First Army became known for its mobility, and for its ability to execute successful flanking maneuvers. Between 1930 and 1933, Lin&#x27;s forces captured twice the number of prisoners of war and military equipment as the Third and Fifth Army Groups combined. The successes of Lin&#x27;s forces are due partially to the division of labour within the Red Army: Lin&#x27;s forces were more offensive and unorthodox than other groups, allowing Lin to capitalize on other Red Army commanders&#x27; successes.

During the Communists&#x27; defense against Chiang&#x27;s 1933–34 Fifth Encirclement Campaign, Lin advocated a strategy of protracted guerilla warfare, and opposed the positional warfare advocated by Braun and his supporters. Lin believed that the best way to destroy enemy soldiers was not to pursue them or defend strategic points, but to weaken the enemy through feints, ambushes, encirclements, and surprise attacks. Lin&#x27;s views generally conformed with the tactics advocated by Mao.

After Chiang&#x27;s forces successfully occupied several strategic locations within the Jiangxi Soviet, in 1934, Lin was one of the first Red Army commanders to publicly advocate the abandonment of the Jiangxi Soviet, but he was opposed by most Red Army commanders, especially Braun and Peng Dehuai. After the Communists finally resolved to abandon their base, later in 1934, Lin continued his position as one of the most successful commanders in the Red Army during the Long March. Under the direction of Mao and Zhou, the Red Army finally arrived at the remote Communist base of Yan&#x27;an, Shaanxi, in December 1936.

Lin and Peng Dehuai were generally considered the Red Army&#x27;s best battlefield commanders, and were not rivals during the Long March. Both of them had supported Mao&#x27;s rise to &quot;de facto&quot; leadership at the Zunyi Conference in January 1935. Lin may have become privately dissatisfied with Mao&#x27;s strategy of constant evasion by the end of the Long March, but continued to support Mao publicly.

The American journalist Edgar Snow met Lin Biao in the Communist base of Shaanxi in 1936, and wrote about Lin in his book, &quot;Red Star Over China&quot;. Snow&#x27;s account focused more on the role of Peng than Lin, evidently having had long conversations with, and devoting two whole chapters to, Peng (more than any other individual apart from Mao). Though he said of Lin:

Lin Biao did not present the bluff, lusty face of Peng Dehuai. He was ten years younger, rather slight, oval-faced, dark, handsome. Peng talked with his men. Lin kept his distance. To many he seemed shy and reserved. There are no stories reflecting warmth and affection for his men. His fellow Red Army commanders respected Lin, but when he spoke, it was all business...

The contrast between Mao&#x27;s top field commanders could hardly have been more sharp, but on the Long March they worked well together, Lin specializing in feints, masked strategy, surprises, ambushes, flank attacks, pounces from the rear, and stratagems. Peng met the enemy head-on in frontal assaults and fought with such fury that again and again he wiped them out. Peng did not believe a battle well fought unless he managed to replenish—and more than replenish—any losses by seizure of enemy guns and converting prisoners of war to new and loyal recruits to the Red Army.

With Mao Zedong, Lin Biao shared the distinction of being one of the few Red commanders never wounded. Engaged on the front in more than a hundred battles, in field command for more than 10 years, exposed to every hardship that his men have known, with a reward of $100,000 on his head, he miraculously remained unhurt and in good health.

In 1932, Lin Biao was given command of the 1st Red Army Corps, which then numbered about 20,000 rifles. It became the most dreaded section of the Red Army. Chiefly due to Lin&#x27;s extraordinary talent as a tactician, it destroyed, defeated or outmanoeuvered every Government force sent against it and was never broken in battle...

Like many able Red commanders, Lin has never been outside China, speaks and reads no language but Chinese. Before the age of 30, however, he has already won recognition beyond Red circles. His articles in the Chinese Reds&#x27; military magazines... have been republished, studied and criticised in Nanking (Nanjing) military journals, and also in Japan and Soviet Russia.
 Within a year of Snow&#x27;s reporting, Lin was seriously wounded. A Red Army soldier shot him by mistake.

Lin and Mao generally had a close personal relationship, but some accounts claim that Lin sometimes made disparaging comments about Mao in private, and that Lin&#x27;s support of Mao was largely for the pursuit of power. After arriving in Yan&#x27;an, Lin became the principal of the newly founded Chinese People&#x27;s Anti-Japanese Military and Political University. In 1937, Lin married one of the students there, a girl named Liu Ximin, who had earned the nickname &quot;University Flower&quot;.

===Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945)===

In August 1937, Lin was named commander-in-chief of the 115th Division of the Communist 8th Route Army and ordered to aid Yan Xishan&#x27;s forces in repelling the Japanese invasion of Shanxi. In this capacity, Lin orchestrated the ambush at Pingxingguan in September 1937, which was one of the few battlefield successes for the Chinese in the early period of the Second Sino-Japanese War (known in China as the &quot;War of Resistance Against Japan&quot;).
In 1938, while he was still leading Chinese forces in Shanxi, Japanese soldiers who had joined the Communists and were serving under Lin&#x27;s command presented Lin with a Japanese uniform and &quot;katana&quot;, which they had captured in battle. Lin then put the uniform and katana on, jumped onto a horse, and rode away from the army. While riding, Lin was spotted alone by a sharpshooter in Yan&#x27;s army. The soldier was surprised to see a Japanese officer riding a horse in the desolate hills alone. He took aim at Lin and severely injured him. The bullet grazed Lin&#x27;s head, penetrating deep enough to leave a permanent impression on his skull. After being shot in the head, Lin fell from his horse and injured his back.

Recovering from his wounds and ill with tuberculosis, Lin left for Moscow at the end of 1938, where he served as the representative of the Chinese Communist Party to the Executive Committee of the Communist International. He remained in Moscow until February 1942, working on Comintern affairs and writing for its publication. Lin was accompanied by his wife, Liu Ximin, but their relationship deteriorated in Moscow, and Lin eventually returned to Yan&#x27;an without her.

While in Moscow, Lin became infatuated with Zhou Enlai&#x27;s adopted daughter, Sun Weishi, who was studying in Moscow from 1938 to 1946. Before returning to China, in 1942, Lin proposed to Sun and promised to divorce his wife, from whom Lin had become estranged. Sun was not able to accept Lin&#x27;s proposal, but promised to consider marrying Lin after completing her studies. Lin divorced Liu Ximin after returning to China, and married another woman, Ye Qun, in 1943. The relationship between Sun and Ye was notably bad. After returning to Yan&#x27;an, Lin was involved in troop training and indoctrination assignments.

===Liaoshen Campaign===
Lin was absent for most of the fighting during World War II, but was elected the sixth-ranking Central Committee member in 1945 based on his earlier battlefield reputation. After the Japanese surrender, the Communists moved large numbers of troops to Manchuria (Northeast China), and Lin Biao relocated to Manchuria to command the new &quot;Communist Northeast Military District&quot;. The Soviets transferred captured Japanese military equipment to the Communists, making Lin&#x27;s army one of the most well-equipped Communist forces in China. By the time that units from the Kuomintang (Nationalists) were able to arrive in the major cities of Manchuria, Lin&#x27;s forces were already in firm control of most of the countryside and surrounding areas.

By the end of 1945, Lin had 280,000 troops in Manchuria under his command, but according to Kuomintang estimates only 100,000 of these were regular forces with access to adequate equipment. The KMT also estimated that Lin also had access to 100,000 irregular auxiliaries, whose membership was drawn mainly from unemployed factory workers. Lin avoided decisive confrontations throughout 1945, and he was able to preserve the strength of his army despite criticism from his peers in the Party and the PLA.

For the sake of bargaining with the Kuomintang in peace negotiations in 1946, Mao ordered Lin to assemble his army to take and defend key cities, which was against the previous strategy of the Red Army. Lin disagreed with this position, but was ordered by Mao to draw the KMT into a decisive battle and &quot;not give an inch of land&quot; around Siping, Jilin. On 15 April, Lin orchestrated an ambush and forced KMT forces there to withdraw with heavy casualties. When the local KMT commander, Du Yuming, launched a counterattack on 18 April, Mao ordered the troops there to hold the city indefinitely. The fighting continued until Mao finally allowed Lin to withdraw on 19 May, which Lin did immediately, barely saving his army from encirclement and destruction.

Du pursued Lin&#x27;s forces to the south bank of the Songhua River, where they halted due to Du&#x27;s concerns about his army becoming overextended. According to Communist sources, Lin&#x27;s army lost 15,000 soldiers in the fighting and withdrawal, but Nationalist sources claim that 25,000 soldiers also deserted or surrendered, and that Lin&#x27;s force of 100,000 irregular auxiliaries suffered from mass desertion during the retreat. On 10 June, the two forces agreed to a ceasefire brokered by George Marshall, and fighting temporarily ceased. Mao ordered Lin to counterattack that winter, but Lin refused, replying that his forces were exhausted and not logistically prepared to do so.

When Du led the majority of his forces to attack Communist forces on the Korean border in January 1947, Lin finally ordered 20,000 of his soldiers to cross the Songhua River, where they staged guerrilla raids, ambushed relief forces, attacked isolated garrisons, and avoided decisive confrontations with strong units Du sent to defeat them. While they did so, they looted large quantities of supplies and destroyed the infrastructure of the KMT-held territories that they passed through, including bridges, railroads, fortifications, electrical lines, and boats. When Du sent his forces back south, they were ambushed and defeated. When Du requested reinforcements from Chiang Kai-shek, his request was rejected.

On 8 April, Lin moved his headquarters from Harbin to Shuangcheng in order to be closer to the front. On 5 May, he held a conference with his subordinates and announced that his armies would change tactics, engage in a large-scale counterattack, and seek to defeat Du&#x27;s forces in a decisive battle. On 8 May, Lin launched the first of his &quot;three great campaigns&quot;, the Summer Offensive, intending to engage a large garrison at Huaide while a second force positioned itself to ambush the force that would predictably be sent to relieve it. On 17 May, they won a major victory and forced the survivors to retreat to Changchun and Siping. By the end of May 1947, Lin&#x27;s forces had taken control of most of the countryside (everything except for the rail lines and several major cities), infiltrated and destroyed most KMT forces in Manchuria, and re-established contact with isolated Communist forces in southern Liaoning province.

After the victory of the Summer Offensive, Lin&#x27;s forces gained the initiative and Kuomintang defensive strategy became static and reactionary. Lin ordered his forces to besiege Siping, but they suffered very high casualties and made little progress, partially due to the defenders&#x27; strong entrenched position and air support, and due to the attackers&#x27; poor artillery support (Lin only had seventy pieces of artillery around Siping). Lin&#x27;s forces broke into the city twice and engaged in street-to-street fighting, but were driven back both times with heavy casualties. By 19 June, Lin&#x27;s assault troops had become increasingly exhausted, and Lin began to rotate them to prevent them from becoming completely ineffective. On 24 June, Nationalist reinforcements arrived from the south to lift the siege. Lin recognized that he did not have enough manpower left to defeat them, and on 1 July, he ordered his forces to retreat back to the north of the Songhua River.

The Communists suffered over 30,000 losses at Siping, and may have suffered a desertion rate of over 20% during the withdrawal, while the Nationalist garrison at Siping fell from 20,000 to slightly over 3,000 before the siege was broken. Lin volunteered to write a self-criticism after the defeat. He also criticized his commander at Siping, Li Tianyou, for demonstrating poor tactics and for lacking &quot;revolutionary spirit&quot;. Despite the army&#x27;s setbacks he reorganized the army, combining surviving regiments and raising local militia forces to the status of regular units. By the fall of 1947, he had 510,000 soldiers under his command, approximately equal to Nationalist forces in the region.

Before Du&#x27;s replacement, Chen Cheng, could cross north and begin an offensive, Lin moved his army south and began the Autumn Offensive, in which his forces destroyed rail lines and other infrastructure, attacked isolated Nationalist units, and attempted to provoke and ambush strong Nationalist forces. Chen&#x27;s forces responded to the campaign by withdrawing into their city garrisons. The Communists were not able to provoke a decisive confrontation, and the Autumn Offensive ended in a stalemate.

Chen&#x27;s forces remained static and reactionary, at the end of 1947, Lin led his armies back south in his final Liaoshen Campaign, the Winter Offensive. His initial plan was to repeat the goal of his last offensive, to besiege Jilin City and ambush its relief force, but after reviewing Kuomintang troop dispositions he determined that southern Manchuria would be an easier target. On 15 December, Lin&#x27;s forces attacked Fakui, Zhangwu, and Xinlitun. Chen sent reinforcements to relieve Fakui, and when the Communist ambush failed, Lin ordered his forces to withdraw and join in the siege of Zhangwu. When Chen did not intervene and the town fell on 28 December, Lin assumed the main part of the campaign was over and he dispersed his forces to rest and attack secondary targets.

Chen saw Lin&#x27;s withdrawal as an opportunity to seize the offensive. He ordered his forces to attack targets in northern Liaoning on 1 January 1948, and on 3 January, Lin successfully encircled the isolated Nationalist 5th Corps. Its commander, Chen Linda, realized that he was being surrounded and requested reinforcements, but Chen Cheng only responded that he would &quot;allow&quot; Chen Linda to withdraw. The attempted breakout failed, and the 5th Corps was destroyed on 7 January. After this defeat, Chen Cheng was replaced with Wei Lihuang ten days later, but Wei was not able to prevent the Communists from capturing Liaoyang on 6 February, destroying the 54th division, and severing an important railroad that linked Wei&#x27;s forces from their ports on the Bohai Sea.

Lin continued his advance, defeating all garrisons in western Manchuria or inducing them to defect by late February. On 26 February Lin reorganized his forces as the Northeastern Field Army and began preparations to return and take Siping, whose garrison had been transferred elsewhere by Chen Cheng and never re-strengthened. Lin began the general assault on the city on 13 March, and took the town one day later. The capture of Siping ended Lin&#x27;s Winter Offensive. The KMT nearly lost all of Manchuria by the end of the campaign and suffered 156,000 casualties, most of which survived as prisoners of war that were indoctrinated and recruited into Lin&#x27;s forces. By the end of winter 1948 the Kuomintang had lost all of its territory in the Northeast, except for Changchun, Shenyang, and an area connecting the rail line from Beiping to those cities.

Following Lin&#x27;s Winter campaign, Mao wanted him to attack targets farther south, but Lin disagreed because he did not want to leave a strong enemy at his back, and he believed the defeat of a strong city would force Chiang to abandon the Northeast. By 25 May 1948, the Northeastern Field Army had completely encircled Changchun, including its airfield, and for the rest of the siege the Nationalist commander, Zheng Dongguo, depended entirely on supplies airdropped into the city. On 19 May, Lin submitted a report to Mao in which he expected heavy casualties. By 20 July the siege was at a stalemate, and Lin deferred to Mao, allowing some of his army to attack Jinzhou farther south, beginning the Liaoshen Campaign. When Chiang airlifted reinforcements to defend Jinzhou, Lin ordered his army to abandon the siege and return to Changchun, but Mao disagreed and overruled him, and Lin was ordered to engage the defenders in a decisive confrontation. On 14 October, the Northeast Field Army began its assault on Jinzhou with 250,000 men and the bulk of Lin&#x27;s artillery and armor. After nearly 24 hours of fighting, Lin&#x27;s forces were victorious, suffering 24,000 casualties but capturing the enemy commander, Fan Hanjie, and 90,000 enemy soldiers.

After hearing the news about the defeat at Jinzhou, a KMT army from Yunnan and its commander, Zeng Zesheng, defected and abandoned its position on the outskirts of Changchun on 14 October. This doomed the remaining Nationalist forces in the city, and Zheng Dongguo was forced to surrender two days later. Chiang ordered the 9th army of 110,000 men under General Liao Yaoxiang to travel west and retake Jinzhou, but Lin directed nearly all of his forces to stop them, and they began to encircle the relief unit on 21 October. After a week of fighting, the Nationalist army was destroyed on 28 October. Remaining KMT garrisons in the Northeast attempted to break out of the region and flee south, but most were unsuccessful. After Changchun, the only major KMT garrison in the Northeast was Shenyang, where 140,000 KMT soldiers were eventually forced to surrender. By the end of 1948 all of Northeast China was under Communist control.

===Defeating the Kuomintang===
After taking control of the Manchurian provinces, Lin then swept into North China. Forces under Lin were responsible for winning two of the three major military victories responsible for the defeat of the Kuomintang. Lin suffered from ongoing periods of serious illness throughout the campaign. Following the victory in Manchuria, Lin commanded over a million soldiers, encircling Chiang&#x27;s main forces in northern China during the Pingjin Campaign, taking Beijing and Tianjin within a period of two months. Tianjin was taken by force, and on 22 January 1949 General Fu Zuoyi and his army of 400,000 men agreed to surrender Beijing without a battle, and the PLA occupied the city on 31 January. The Pingjin Campaign saw Lin remove a total of approximately 520,000 enemy troops from the enemy&#x27;s battle lines. Many of those who surrendered later joined the PLA.

After taking Beijing, the Communists attempted to negotiate for the surrender of the remaining KMT forces. When these negotiations failed, Lin resumed his attacks on the KMT in the southeast. After taking Beijing, Lin&#x27;s army numbered 1.5 million soldiers. He crossed the Yangtze River in the Spring of 1949 and decisively defeated the defending KMT army stationed in central China during the Yangtze River Crossing Campaign. Lin&#x27;s armies continued to defeat KMT armies farther south, finally occupying all KMT positions on mainland China by the end of 1949. The last position occupied by Lin&#x27;s forces was the tropical island of Hainan.

Lin Biao was considered one of the Communists&#x27; most brilliant generals after the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, in 1949. Lin was the youngest of the &quot;Ten Marshals&quot; named in 1955, a title that recognized Lin&#x27;s substantial military contributions.

==Politician==
===Illness===

Lin Biao continued to suffer from poor health after 1949, and chose to avoid high-profile military and political positions. His status led him to be appointed to a number of high-profile positions throughout most of the 1950s, but these were largely honorary and carried few responsibilities. He generally delegated or neglected many of the formal political responsibilities that he was assigned, usually citing his poor health.

After Lin&#x27;s injury in 1938, he suffered from ongoing physical and mental health problems. A theory holds that his lifelong health problems may have resulted from the injury. His exact medical condition is not well understood, partially because his medical records have never been publicly released. Dr. Li Zhisui, then one of Mao&#x27;s personal physicians, believed that Lin suffered from neurasthenia and hypochondria. He became ill whenever he perspired, and suffered from phobias about water, wind, cold, light, and noise. He was said to become nervous at the sight of rivers and oceans in traditional Chinese paintings, and suffered from diarrhea, which could be triggered by the sound of running water. Li&#x27;s account of Lin&#x27;s condition is notably different from the official Chinese version.

In another study, Lin is described as having symptoms similar to those seen in patients of schizoid personality disorder. Lin&#x27;s personality traits including his aloofness, lack of interest in social relationships, secretiveness, and emotional coldness he exhibited during the Cultural Revolution; indeed, all of these were symptoms very similar to those seen in individuals who suffer from schizoid personality disorder. The challenge of Lin&#x27;s personality problems in conjunction with the turbulent political climate of the Cultural Revolution impacted his overall ability to govern his position.

Lin suffered from excessive headaches, and spent much of his free time consulting Chinese medical texts and preparing traditional Chinese medicines for himself. He suffered from insomnia, and often took sleeping pills. He ate simple meals, did not smoke, and did not drink alcohol. As his condition progressed, his fear of water led to a general refusal to either bathe or eat fruit. Because of his fear of wind and light, his office was gloomy and lacked any ventilation. Some accounts have suggested that Lin became a drug addict, either to opium or morphine.

As early as 1953, Soviet doctors diagnosed Lin as suffering from manic depression. Lin&#x27;s wife, Ye Qun, rejected this diagnosis, but it was later confirmed by Chinese doctors. Lin&#x27;s fragile health made him vulnerable, passive, and easily manipulated by other political figures, notably Ye Qun herself.

Lin&#x27;s complaints got worse with time and age. In the years before his death, the fiancée of Lin&#x27;s son reported that Lin became extremely distant and socially and politically detached, even to the extent that he never read books or newspapers. His passivity made him difficult to connect with at any meaningful level: &quot;usually he just sat there, blankly&quot;. In Lin&#x27;s rare periods of activity, he used his time mostly to complain about, and seek treatment for his large variety of medical issues.

===Alliance with Mao===
Lin, like most of the Politburo, initially held serious reservations about China&#x27;s entry into the Korean War, citing the devastation that would result if the &quot;imperialists&quot; (Americans) detonated an atomic bomb in Korea or China. Lin later declined to lead forces in Korea, citing his ill health. In early October 1950, Peng Dehuai was named commander of the Chinese forces bound for Korea, and Lin went to the Soviet Union for medical treatment. Lin flew to the Soviet Union with Zhou Enlai and participated in negotiations with Joseph Stalin concerning Soviet support for China&#x27;s intervention, indicating that Mao retained his trust in Lin.

Due partially to his periods of ill health and physical rehabilitation in the Soviet Union, Lin was slow to rise to power. In the early 1950s Lin was one of five major leaders given responsibility for civil and military affairs, controlling a jurisdiction in central China. In 1953 he was visited by Gao Gang, and was later suspected of supporting him. In 1955 Lin was named to the Politburo. In February 1958 Peng Dehuai, then China&#x27;s Defense Minister, gave a speech for the fortieth anniversary of the Soviet Red Army in which he suggested increasing the military cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. Mao wanted to distance China from the Soviet Union, and began grooming Lin Biao as a viable successor to Peng. In 1958 Lin joined the Politburo Standing Committee and became one of China&#x27;s Vice-chairmen. After the 1959 Lushan Conference, at which Peng criticized Mao&#x27;s disastrous Great Leap Forward, Peng was arrested and removed from all government positions. Privately, Lin agreed with Peng and was strongly opposed to Peng being purged, but Lin&#x27;s fear of being purged himself kept him from publicly opposing Mao&#x27;s efforts to purge Peng, and Lin publicly condemned Peng as a &quot;careerist, a conspiracist, and a hypocrite&quot;. Under Mao&#x27;s direction, Peng was disgraced and put under indefinite house arrest. Lin became the senior leader most publicly supportive of Mao following the Great Leap Forward, during which Mao&#x27;s economic policies caused an artificial famine in which tens of millions of people starved to death. For example, Lin publicly defended Mao during the Seven Thousand Cadres Conference in 1962.

Lin initially refused to replace Peng, but eventually accepted the position at the insistence of Mao Zedong. As Defense Minister, Lin&#x27;s command of the PLA was second only to Mao, but he deferred many of his responsibilities to subordinates. The most important figures to whom Lin deferred the day-to-day operations of China&#x27;s armed forces were Luo Ruiqing, Chief of Staff, and He Long, the Central Military Vice-chairman.

As Defense Minister, Lin&#x27;s policies differed from those of his predecessor. Lin attempted to reform China&#x27;s armed forces based on political criteria: he abolished all signs and privileges of rank, purged members considered sympathetic to the USSR, directed soldiers to work part-time as industrial and agricultural workers, and indoctrinated the armed forces in Mao Zedong Thought. Lin&#x27;s system of indoctrination made it clear the Party was in command of China&#x27;s armed forces, and Lin ensured that the army&#x27;s political commissars enjoyed great power and status in order to see that his directives were followed. Lin implemented these reforms in order to please Mao, but privately was concerned that they would weaken the PLA (which they did). Mao strongly approved of these reforms, and conscientiously promoted Lin to a series of high positions.

Lin used his position as Minister of Defense to flatter Mao by promoting Mao&#x27;s cult of personality. Lin devised and ran a number of national Maoist propaganda campaigns based on the PLA, the most successful of which was the &quot;learn from Lei Feng&quot; campaign, which Lin began in 1963. Because he was the person most responsible for directing the &quot;learn from Lei Feng&quot; campaign, Lin may have directed the forging of &quot;Lei Feng&#x27;s Diary&quot;, upon which the propaganda campaign was based.

Because of Lin&#x27;s fragile health, Ye Qun controlled many aspects of Lin&#x27;s public life during the 1960s, including who would see Lin and what others would know about him. Mao encouraged Ye to act on Lin&#x27;s behalf, giving her an unusual amount of power and responsibility. In 1965 Mao asked Ye to publicly criticize Lin&#x27;s chief of staff, Luo Ruiqing, on Lin&#x27;s behalf, even though Ye did not yet hold any high political position. When Lin discovered that Ye had done so (after Luo was purged), he was angry at Ye, but powerless to alter Luo&#x27;s disgrace.

Lin often read speeches prepared by others, and allowed his name to be placed on articles that he did not write, as long as these materials supported Mao. One of the most famous articles published in Lin&#x27;s name was the 20,000-word pamphlet on revolution in developing countries, &quot;Long Live the Victory of the People&#x27;s War!&quot;, which was released in 1965. This article made Lin one of China&#x27;s leading interpreters of Mao&#x27;s political theories. The article likened the &quot;emerging forces&quot; of the poor in Asia, Africa, and Latin America to the &quot;rural areas of the world&quot;, while the affluent countries of the West were likened to the &quot;cities of the world&quot;. Eventually the &quot;cities&quot; would be encircled by revolutions in the &quot;rural areas&quot;, following theories prevalent in Mao Zedong Thought. Lin made no promise that China would fight other people&#x27;s wars, and foreign revolutionaries were advised to depend mainly on &quot;self-reliance&quot;.

Lin worked closely with Mao, promoting Mao&#x27;s cult of personality. Lin directed the compilation of some of Chairman Mao&#x27;s writings into a handbook, the &quot;Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong&quot;, which became known as &quot;the Little Red Book&quot;. Lin Biao&#x27;s military reforms and the success of the 1962 Sino-Indian War impressed Mao. A propaganda campaign called &quot;learn from the People&#x27;s Liberation Army&quot; followed. In 1966, this campaign widened into the Cultural Revolution.

== Cultural Revolution ==

===Rise to prominence===
Lin&#x27;s support impressed Mao, who continued to promote Lin to higher political offices. After Mao&#x27;s second-in-command, President Liu Shaoqi, was denounced as a &quot;capitalist roader&quot; in 1966, Lin Biao emerged as the most likely candidate to replace Liu as Mao&#x27;s successor. Lin attempted to avoid this promotion, but accepted it on Mao&#x27;s insistence.

Privately, Lin opposed the purging of Liu and Deng Xiaoping, on the grounds that they were &quot;good comrades&quot;, but was not able to publicly oppose Mao&#x27;s condemnation of them. Lin privately admired Liu, and once told his daughter that Liu had &quot;a better understanding of theory than Mao&quot;. Zhou Enlai was also considered for the position of vice-chairman, but Zhou successfully withdrew from the nomination, leaving Lin the only candidate.

Lin also seriously attempted to withdraw from the nomination, but was not able to do so because Mao had made Lin&#x27;s appointment a decision of the Central Committee, so rejecting the position would violate Party procedure and would risk ending Lin&#x27;s political career. Lin was not present at the conference where it was decided to name him vice chairman. After Lin was named, he met with Mao and begged him personally not to name him to the position, but Mao criticized him, comparing Lin to the Ming emperor Shizong, who devoted so much of his time to the search for longevity medicines that he neglected his government responsibilities. In 1966 all other candidates for the position were removed, and Lin accepted the position as sole Vice-chairman, replacing Liu Shaoqi as Mao&#x27;s unofficial successor. After his appointment, Lin again attempted to submit a formal written request to Mao, asking Mao to rescind Lin&#x27;s appointment to the position of vice-chairman, but Mao again rejected this request. When Lin received the rejection letter, he was so angry that he tore the letter up and threw it in the garbage.

Because there was no way to avoid becoming Mao&#x27;s second-in-command, Lin attempted to protect himself from the chaos of the Cultural Revolution by giving absolute support to Mao and doing very little else. Lin avoided expressing any opinion, or making any decision on any matter, until Mao&#x27;s own opinions and positions on that matter were clear, after which Lin would adhere as closely to Mao&#x27;s direction as possible. Lin made sure that, whenever he and Mao were scheduled to appear in the same place, Lin would always arrive earlier than Mao, waiting to greet the chairman. Lin attempted to make all observers believe that he was Mao&#x27;s closest follower, always appearing beside Mao in all of Mao&#x27;s public appearances with a copy of Mao&#x27;s &quot;Little Red Book&quot;. When he was informed that the public&#x27;s image of Lin was that he was &quot;Mao&#x27;s best student&quot;, Lin was pleased, and stated: &quot;I don&#x27;t have any talent. What I know, I learned from Mao.&quot;

===Activities===

Because Lin had no real interest in the position of vice-chairman, he did little other than whatever he believed would ingratiate himself to Mao. Privately, Lin had no interest in promoting the Cultural Revolution, and attended government meetings only when Mao demanded that he do so. Those colleagues closest to Lin noted that Lin avoided talking about the Cultural Revolution in any context other than public speeches, and when pressed would only make very brief and ambiguous statements. After 1966, Lin made no phone calls, received few visitors, secluded himself from his colleagues, and gained a reputation as being &quot;reticent and mysterious&quot;. He did not take an active role in government, but allowed his secretaries to read short summaries of selected documents for half an hour in the morning and half an hour in the afternoon. This was generally insufficient to fulfill the responsibilities of vice-chairman, and he left most important work and family duties to his wife, Ye Qun.

Lin&#x27;s passivity was part of a calculated plan to survive the Cultural Revolution alive and well. When Lin perceived that his longtime subordinate, Tao Zhu, was in danger of being purged in the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, Lin sent a letter to warn Tao, advising Tao to be &quot;passive, passive, and passive again&quot;. Tao probably did not understand Lin&#x27;s advice, and was subsequently purged in 1967. In his relationship with Mao, Lin adopted a policy of &quot;three &#x27;nos&#x27;: no responsibility; no suggestions; no crime&quot;.

Following the lead of Mao, in 1966 Lin directed Red Guards in Beijing to &quot;smash those persons in power who are traveling the capitalist road, the bourgeoisie reactionary authorities, and all royalists of the bourgeoisie, and to forcibly destroy the &quot;four olds&quot;: old culture, old ideas, old customs, and old habits. In August 1966 Lin publicly called for a &quot;three-month turmoil&quot; within the PLA, and on October 6 Lin&#x27;s Central Military Commission issued an urgent instruction that all military academies and institutes were to dismiss their classes and allow their students to become fully involved in the Cultural Revolution. Following the orders of this directive, officers and commissars were expelled from their positions, and some were beaten to death. Students at Chinese military academies followed Lin&#x27;s instructions to rebel against their senior officers, breaking into the offices of Lin&#x27;s National Commission for Defense Science to abduct one of the department&#x27;s directors, and claiming Lin&#x27;s deputy chief of staff, Li Tianyu, whom students accused of disciplining them. The students &quot;overthrew&quot; General Xiao Hua, the head of the PLA&#x27;s Political Department since the previous July, and went on to purge 40 other top officers working under him in the Political Department, most of whom died in prison.
Lin continued to support the Red Guards until May 1967, when Mao accepted Zhou Enlai&#x27;s appeals to moderate their radical activity through military intervention. Lin moderated some of the most radical activity within the PLA; but, from 1967 to 1969, 80,000 officers were purged, 1,169 of whom died from torture, starvation, or execution. Research programs were cancelled and the number of military academies across China shrank by two-thirds. Many defensive fortifications were destroyed, and regular training within the PLA ceased.

After 1966, Lin&#x27;s few personal political initiatives were efforts to moderate the radical nature of the Cultural Revolution. Privately, he expressed unhappiness with the Cultural Revolution, but was unable to avoid playing a high-profile role due to the expectations of Mao, China&#x27;s unpredictable political environment, and the manipulations of his wife and son, Ye Qun and Lin Liguo. After 1966, Lin, like Liu before him, attempted to build his own base of support so that he could better position himself for the inevitable, unpredictable political situation that would occur following the death of Mao. Lin&#x27;s few proactive attempts to direct the Cultural Revolution were attempts to protect Red Guards and his political allies from political persecution, and to mediate the attempts of Jiang Qing and her followers to radicalize China&#x27;s political climate. In May 1967, Lin&#x27;s follower, Chen Boda, saved Zhou Enlai from being persecuted by Red Guards by convincing them that Zhou was Lin&#x27;s follower and supporter. Zhou repaid Lin&#x27;s assistance by giving him excessive public praise three months later, in August, but was forced to write a formal apology to Lin after Lin complained to Mao that such praise was inappropriate.
Lin and Jiang cooperated at the outset of the Cultural Revolution, but their relationship began to deteriorate in 1968 as Jiang frequently attempted to interfere in Chinese military affairs, which Lin found intolerable. By 1970 Lin and Ye were very unfriendly with Jiang Qing: Lin referred to her as a &quot;long-nosed pit viper&quot;. From 1968 until his death in 1971, Lin and his supporters disagreed with Zhou Enlai and his followers over the issue of China&#x27;s relationship with the United States and the Soviet Union. Lin believed that both superpowers were equally threatening to China, and that they were colluding to thwart China&#x27;s interests. Zhou Enlai believed that China should become closer to the United States in order to mitigate the threat posed by the Soviet military. Lin was supported by Jiang Qing in his opposition to pursuing a relationship with the United States, but was not able to permanently disrupt Zhou&#x27;s efforts to contact the American officials.

Lin Biao, as Defense Minister, was responsible for the Chinese response to the Zhenbao Island incident of March 1969, a battle with the Soviet Union over Damansky Island along the Amur River. Lin issued a report labeling the Soviet Union a &quot;chauvinist&quot; and &quot;social imperialist&quot; power, and issuing orders warning Chinese troops to be wary of an impending Soviet attack. Lin&#x27;s followers attempted to use the hysteria generated by the incident in an effort to deepen the power that they had gained during the Cultural Revolution, disregarding and acting against the interests of Zhou Enlai and his supporters.

===Height of power===

Lin officially became China&#x27;s second-in-charge in April 1969, following the first plenary session of the 9th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Lin&#x27;s position as Mao&#x27;s &quot;closest comrade-in-arms and successor&quot; was recognized when the Party constitution was formally revised to reflect Lin&#x27;s future succession. At the 9th Central Committee, Lin&#x27;s faction was unquestionably dominant within the Politburo. Of the Politburo&#x27;s twenty-one full members, Lin counted on the support of six members: the generals Huang Yongsheng, Wu Faxian, Li Zuopeng, Qiu Huizuo, his wife Ye Qun; and Chen Boda, an ambitious ideologue. Lin&#x27;s support surpassed the number of members aligned with Jiang Qing, and far surpassed those aligned with Zhou Enlai. Because over 45% of the Central Committee were members of the army, Lin&#x27;s supporters dominated the Politburo, and Lin&#x27;s power was second only to Mao&#x27;s.

The group of Lin Biao-supporting military leaders known as the &quot;Lin Biao clique&quot; were at the forefront of expanding China&#x27;s defense capacity. The Lin Biao clique sought to create major industrial complexes in China&#x27;s hinterlands and therefore strongly supported the Third Front campaign. With the influence of the Lin Biao clique, the budgetary share of national defense during this period exceeded its share during the Korean War (40% for the former, compared to 33% for the latter). By 1971, China built enough subterranean civil defense infrastructure to shelter 60% of its urban population.

During the second plenary session of the 9th Central Committee, held in Lushan from August to September 1970, Mao became uncomfortable with Lin&#x27;s growing power, and began to maneuver against Lin by undermining his supporters and attacking some of Lin&#x27;s suggestions at the conference. At the Second Plenum, Lin advocated that Chairman Mao take the position of President, which had not been filled in since the removal of Liu Shaoqi, but Mao dismissed this appeal, suspecting Lin of using it to increase his own power. Mao did not attack Lin directly, but showed his displeasure by attacking Lin&#x27;s ally, Chen Boda, who was quickly disgraced. Lin kept his position, but the events of the Lushan Conference revealed a growing distrust between Lin and Mao.

Because Lin was one of the most influential figures in promoting Mao&#x27;s personality cult, he began to be criticized within the Party for its excesses later in 1970. After 1970, some factions within the Army, and those led by Zhou Enlai and Jiang Qing, began to distance themselves from Lin. In order to limit Lin&#x27;s growing power, Mao approved Zhou&#x27;s efforts to rehabilitate a number of civilian officials who had been purged during the first years of the Cultural Revolution, and supported Zhou&#x27;s efforts to improve China&#x27;s relationship with the United States.

A serious rift developed between Mao and Lin. Mao was displeased with comments that Lin had made about his wife, Jiang Qing, at the Lushan Conference. Generals loyal to Lin refused to accept Mao&#x27;s criticism of them, and Mao began to question whether Lin continued to follow him unconditionally. Mao wanted Lin to make a self-criticism, but Lin stayed away from Beijing and resisted doing so. Ye Qun made a self-criticism, but it was rejected by Mao as not genuine. Zhou Enlai attempted to mediate between Mao and Lin, but by 1971 Lin had become extremely reclusive and difficult to talk with at any level, and Zhou&#x27;s mediation failed. In July 1971 Mao decided to remove Lin and his supporters. Zhou again attempted to moderate Mao&#x27;s resolution to act against Lin, but failed.

==&quot;Lin Biao incident&quot; and death==

Lin died when an aircraft carrying him and several members of his family crashed in Mongolia at 3:00 am on 13 September 1971, allegedly after attempting to assassinate Mao and defect to the Soviet Union. Following Lin&#x27;s death, there has been widespread skepticism in the West concerning the official Chinese explanation, while forensic investigation conducted by the USSR (which recovered the bodies following the crash) has confirmed that Lin was among those who died in the crash.

The official narrative from the Chinese government is that Lin Biao had launched a failed coup against Mao, known as &quot;Project 571&quot;. In Chinese, &quot;5-7-1&quot; (), is a homophone for &quot;armed uprising&quot; (). After realizing it had failed, Lin Biao and associates attempted to flee to the Soviet Union and boarded a prearranged Trident 1-E (registered as CAAC B-256), piloted by Pan Jingyin, the deputy commander of the PLAAF 34th division. The aircraft did not take aboard enough fuel before taking off, ran out of fuel, and crashed near Öndörkhaan in Mongolia on 13 September 1971. Everyone on board, eight men and one woman, were killed.

An alternative theory posits that Lin Liguo, who was aware of the increasing hostility expressed towards his father in Mao&#x27;s speeches, was the originator of the coup plan, which would involve an attack on Mao&#x27;s train. Summarizing different narratives, journalist Jonathan Chatwin describes this as the most widely believed theory.

According to one account, Zhou Enlai asked Mao if Lin&#x27;s plane should be shot down, and Mao replied, &quot;Rain has to fall, girls have to marry, these things are immutable; let them go&quot;.

However, the exact circumstances surrounding Lin&#x27;s death remain unclear, due to a lack of surviving evidence. Many of the original government records relevant to Lin&#x27;s death were destroyed. Because of the destruction of government documentation related to Lin&#x27;s death, the Chinese government has relied on alleged confessions of purged officials close to Lin to corroborate the official narrative, but non-Chinese scholars generally regard these confessions as unreliable.

Ever since 1971, scholars outside of China have been skeptical of the government&#x27;s official explanation of the circumstances surrounding Lin&#x27;s death. Skeptics assert the official narrative does not sufficiently explain why Lin, one of Mao&#x27;s closest supporters and one of the most successful Communist generals, would suddenly attempt a poorly planned, abortive coup. The government narrative also does not sufficiently explain how and why Lin&#x27;s aircraft crashed. Skeptics have claimed Lin&#x27;s decision to flee to the Soviet Union was illogical, on the grounds the United States or Taiwan would have been safer destinations. Western historians have contended Lin did not have either the intention or the ability to usurp Mao&#x27;s place within the government or the Party. Chatwin notes that the coup&#x27;s military naivety was inconsistent with Lin&#x27;s astuteness in military matters. There are multiple theories that attempt to explain his flight and death.

The Chinese government has no interest in re-evaluating its narrative on Lin Biao&#x27;s death. Non-Chinese scholars interpreted China&#x27;s reluctance to consider contradictory evidence of its &quot;official&quot; history as the result of a desire to avoid exploring any issue that may lead to criticism of Mao Zedong or a re-evaluation of the Cultural Revolution in general, which may distract China from pursuing economic growth.

A six-month investigation by Western scholars in 1994 examined evidence in Russia, Mongolia, mainland China, the United States, and Taiwan, and came to a number of conclusions, some of which were contrary to the official Chinese version of events. The study confirmed Lin Biao, Ye Qun, and Lin Liguo were all killed in the crash. Lin&#x27;s aircraft was travelling &quot;away&quot; from the Soviet Union at the time of its crash, making the exact sequence of events before Lin&#x27;s death more confusing, and casting doubt on the possibility that Lin was attempting to seek asylum in the USSR. Lin&#x27;s wife and son may have forced Lin to board the aircraft against his will. Several senior leaders within the Communist Party hierarchy knew Lin and his family would flee, but chose not to attempt to stop their flight. According to this study, Lin had attempted to contact the Kuomintang in Taiwan on two separate occasions shortly before his death.

In 1971, a Soviet forensic investigation was not able to determine the cause of the crash, but hypothesized the pilot misjudged his altitude while intentionally flying low to evade radar. Judging from the fires that burned after the crash, the Soviets estimated the aircraft had enough fuel to fly to the Soviet cities of Irkutsk or Chita. All of the work and its results were kept secret from the public: outside of the investigative team. Only KGB chairman Yuri Andropov and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev were informed. The report remained classified until the early 1990s, after the end of the Cold War.

==Legacy==
Lin Biao was survived by Doudou and one other daughter. All military officials identified as being close to Lin or his family (most of China&#x27;s high military command) were purged within weeks of Lin&#x27;s disappearance. On 14 September, Zhou announced to the Politburo that four of the highest-ranking military officials in China were immediately suspended from duty and ordered to submit self-criticisms admitting their associations with Lin. This announcement was quickly followed by the arrest of ninety-three people suspected of being close to Lin, and within a month of Lin&#x27;s disappearance over 1,000 senior Chinese military officials were purged. The official purge of Lin&#x27;s supporters continued until it was closed by the 10th Central Committee in August 1973. The incident marked the end of the myth within the Party that Mao had always been absolutely correct. The National Day celebrations on 1 October 1971, were cancelled.

The news of Lin&#x27;s death was announced to all Communist Party officials in mid-October 1971, and to the Chinese public in November. The news was publicly received with shock and confusion. Mao Zedong was especially disturbed by the incident: his health deteriorated, and he became depressed. At the end of 1971, he became seriously ill; he suffered a stroke in January 1972, received emergency medical treatment, and his health remained unstable. Mao became nostalgic about some of his revolutionary comrades whose purging Lin had supported, and backed Zhou Enlai&#x27;s efforts to conduct a widespread rehabilitation of veteran revolutionaries, and to correct some of the excesses of the Cultural Revolution (which he blamed on Lin Biao). In the aftermath of the purge of Lin&#x27;s supporters, Zhou Enlai replaced Lin as the second most powerful man in China, and Jiang Qing and her followers were never able to displace him. Without the support of Lin, Jiang was unable to prevent Zhou&#x27;s efforts to improve China&#x27;s relationship with the United States, or to rehabilitate cadres who had been purged during the Cultural Revolution. The clause in the Party constitution indicating that Lin was Mao&#x27;s successor was not officially amended until the 10th Central Committee in August 1973.

The position of the Chinese government on Lin and the circumstances of his death changed several times over the decade following 1971. For over a year, the Party first attempted to cover up the details of Lin&#x27;s death. The government then began to issue partial details of the event, followed by an anti-Lin Biao propaganda campaign. After Mao&#x27;s death, in 1976, the government confirmed its condemnation of Lin and generally ceased any dialogue concerning Lin&#x27;s place in history. Throughout the 1970s, high-ranking leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, including Hua Guofeng, spread the story to foreign delegates that Lin had conspired with the KGB to assassinate Mao.

In 1973 Jiang Qing, Mao&#x27;s fourth wife and a former political ally of Lin&#x27;s, started the Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius campaign, aimed at using Lin&#x27;s scarred image to attack Zhou Enlai. Much of this propaganda campaign involved the creative falsification of history, including (false) details about how Lin had opposed Mao&#x27;s leadership and tactics throughout his career. Lin&#x27;s name became involved in Jiang&#x27;s propaganda campaign after flashcards, made by Ye Qun to record Lin&#x27;s thoughts, were discovered in Lin&#x27;s residence following his death. Some of these flashcards recorded opinions critical of Mao. According to Lin&#x27;s writings, Mao &quot;will fabricate &#x27;your&#x27; opinion first, then he will change &#x27;your&#x27; opinion – which is not actually yours, but his fabrication. I should be careful of this standard trick.&quot; Another critical comment of Lin&#x27;s states that Mao &quot;worships himself and has a blind faith in himself. He worships himself to such an extent that all accomplishments are attributed to him, but all mistakes are made by others&quot;. Lin&#x27;s private criticisms of Mao were directly contradictory of the public image cultivated by Lin, who publicly stated following the Great Leap Forward that all mistakes of the past were the result of deviating from Mao&#x27;s instructions.

Like many major proponents of the Cultural Revolution, Lin&#x27;s image was manipulated after Mao&#x27;s death in 1976, and many negative aspects of the Cultural Revolution were blamed on Lin. After October 1976, those in power also blamed Mao&#x27;s supporters, the so-called Gang of Four. In 1980, the Chinese government held a series of &quot;special trials&quot; to identify those most responsible for the Cultural Revolution. In 1981, the government released their verdict: that Lin Biao must be held, along with Jiang Qing, as one of the two major &quot;counter-revolutionary cliques&quot; responsible for the excesses of the late 1960s. According to the official Party verdict, Lin and Jiang were singled out for blame because they led intra-Party cliques which took advantage of Mao&#x27;s &quot;mistakes&quot; to advance their own political goals, engaging in &quot;criminal activity&quot; for their own self-benefit. Among the &quot;crimes&quot; he was charged with was the ouster of China&#x27;s head of state, President Liu Shaoqi. Lin was found to be primarily responsible for using &quot;false evidence&quot; to orchestrate a &quot;political frame-up&quot; of Liu. Lin has been officially remembered as one of the greatest villains of modern China since then. Lin was never politically rehabilitated, so the charges against him continue to stand.

For several decades, Lin&#x27;s name and image were censored within China, but in recent years a balanced image of Lin has reappeared in popular culture: surviving aides and family members have published memoirs about their experience with Lin; scholars have explored most surviving evidence relevant to his life and death, and have gained exposure within the official Chinese media; movies set before 1949 have made reference to Lin; and Lin&#x27;s name has re-appeared in Chinese history textbooks, recognizing his contributions to the victory of the Red Army. Within modern China, Lin is regarded as one of the Red Army&#x27;s best military strategists. In 2007, a big portrait of Lin was added to the Chinese Military Museum in Beijing, included in a display of the &quot;Ten Marshals&quot;, a group considered to be the founders of China&#x27;s armed forces.

<text>The United Kingdom was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1969 with the song &quot;Boom Bang-a-Bang&quot;, composed by Alan Moorhouse, with lyrics by Peter Warne, and performed by Scottish singer Lulu. The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a televised national final, after having previously selected the performer internally. The song won the competition in a joint win with the songs from , the , and .

==Before Eurovision==
===&quot;A Song for Europe 1969&quot;===
After performing all six songs weekly on her eponymous TV series &quot;Lulu&quot;, the final was held on 22 February 1969 and presented by Michael Aspel. Of the six finalists, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Go On Living Without You&quot;, was written by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, before both found songwriting fame. John recorded the track as a demo which later became available on CD. Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice also submitted a song called &quot;Try It and See&quot; but this failed to reach the final. They later reworked the track and it became &quot;King Herod&#x27;s Song&quot; in the musical &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;. Viewers cast votes on postcards via mail to choose the winner. The winning song, announced on 1 March 1969, with 56,476 votes, was &quot;Boom Bang-a-Bang&quot;.
=== Chart success ===
&quot;Boom Bang-a-Bang&quot; was released on single, with the runner-up in the national final &quot;March!&quot; on the B-Side and reached No. 2 in the UK singles chart, remaining Lulu&#x27;s most successful solo single of her career in Britain. She also reportedly recorded the winner in French, Italian, German and Spanish. A third song from the competition &quot;Come September&quot;, co-written by Mark London, the husband of Lulu&#x27;s manager Marion Massey, was released later in 1969 as an album track on the LP &quot;Lulu&#x27;s Album&quot;. Eventually, all six recordings of the songs by Lulu were made available on various CD compilations. Former Eurovision winner Grethe Ingmann and German contestant Heidi Brühl (who had both taken part in the Eurovision Song Contest 1963) recorded a Danish and German version of the winning song respectively. 

Other Eurovision artists recorded versions of the songs from the UK final. Swedish singer (and future Eurovision winner) Agnetha Fältskog recorded a version of &quot;Are You Ready For Love?&quot; under the title &quot;Ge dej till tåls&quot;. Finland&#x27;s Katri Helena recorded &quot;Come September&quot; as &quot;Taas kun tuulee&quot;, while another Finnish version was recorded by Jarkko &amp; Laura under the title &quot;Kahden ollaan&quot;. Jarkko &amp; Laura were competitors against Lulu in the 1969 Eurovision final. Gloria Hunniford also recorded &quot;Are You Ready For Love?&quot; in the UK. In Britain, Cilla Black, Sandie Shaw and Polly Brown all recorded versions of &quot;I Can&#x27;t Go On Living Without You&quot;.

== At Eurovision ==
The United Kingdom went on to finish in a four-way win in Madrid with the songs from host country Spain, plus the Netherlands and France, the first time ever a tie-break situation had occurred. However, there was no rule at the time to cover such an eventuality, so all four countries were declared joint winners.

France&#x27;s win was their fourth. France became the first country to win the contest four times. The Netherlands&#x27; win was their third. Spain and the United Kingdom each won for the second time. And it was the first time that any country (Spain, in this case) had a winning ESC entry two years in a row.

David Gell provided the television commentary for BBC 1 at the Eurovision final on 29 March, Michael Aspel was acting as the standby commentator. Pete Murray provided the commentary for BBC Radio 1 listeners and John Russell provided the commentary for British Forces Radio.

<doc id="297259" wikidata="Q14418" url="?curid=297259" title="Lake Lugano">
<text>Lake Lugano ( or , from ; ) is a glacial lake which is situated on the border between southern Switzerland and northern Italy. The lake, named after the city of Lugano, is situated between Lake Como and Lago Maggiore. It was cited for the first time by Gregory of Tours in 590 with the name &quot;Ceresio&quot;, a name which is said to have derived from the Latin word &quot;cerasus&quot;, meaning cherry, and refers to the abundance of cherry trees which at one time adorned the shores of the lake. The lake appears in documents in 804 under the name &quot;Laco Luanasco&quot;.

There are various mountains and tourist destinations on the shores of the lake including Monte Brè to the east, Monte San Salvatore west of Lugano, and Monte Generoso on the south-eastern shore. The World Heritage Site Monte San Giorgio is situated south of the lake. Also located to the south is the Cinque Vette Park.

The lake is drained by the Tresa, which empties into Lake Maggiore, the latter being drained by the Ticino and the Po.

==History==
The first certain testimony of a political body governing the shores of the lake is from 818. Occupying an area of strategic importance, the lake was then part of the feudal dominion of the County of Sperio. Circa 1000, it came under the control of the Bishop of Como. The region was the site of the war between Como and Milan over control of Alpine traffic from 1218 to 1227. As the lake and its shores became progressively incorporated into the Duchy of Milan they became the subject of political and territorial contention during the 15th century, and Lugano became the lake&#x27;s main town.

The lake definitively ceased to belong to a single sovereign political entity following the establishment of the transalpine bailiwicks of the Swiss cantons at the beginning of the 16th century. The Italian-Swiss border was fixed in 1752 by the Treaty of Varese, and has since remained virtually unchanged.

In 1848, the Melide causeway was built on a moraine between Melide and Bissone, in order to carry a road across the lake and provide a direct connection between Lugano and Chiasso. Today the causeway also carries the Gotthard railway and the A2 motorway.

==Geography==
The lake is in size, 63% of which is in Switzerland and 37% in Italy. It has an average width of roughly and a maximum width of about at the bay of Lugano. A maximum depth of is found in the northern basin. The culminating point of the lake&#x27;s drainage basin is the Pizzo di Gino summit in the Lugano Prealps (). Bathing in the lake is allowed at any of the 50 or so bathing establishments located along the Swiss shores.

The Italian exclave of Campione d&#x27;Italia and parts of the waters of the lake are considered by European Customs Law as non-territorial for fiscal purposes and as such enjoy a special tax status as a duty-free area, exemption from EU VAT
and offer residents other advantageous tax privileges.

The Melide causeway separates the northern () and southern () basins, although a bridge in the causeway permits water flow and navigation. The lake retention time is an average of 8.2 years; that of the northern basin (11.9 years) is considerably higher than the southern one (2.3 years).

==Navigation==

The lake is navigable, and used by a considerable number of private vessels. Passenger boats of the Società Navigazione del Lago di Lugano (SNL) provide services on the lake, principally for tourist purposes, but also connecting Lugano with other lakeside communities, some of which have no road access.

Fishery in the lake (and Lake Maggiore) is regulated by a 1986 agreement between Switzerland and Italy. The current agreement on navigation dates from 1992.

==Pollution==
Pollution has long been a problem in Lake Lugano. In the 1960s and 1970s it was officially forbidden to bathe in the lake. Despite the continued introduction of sewage treatment plants, such as in Gandria, factors, such as lake retention time and lack of oxygen and increasing phosphorus concentrations, means it is unclear if the lake will recover.

The Federal Office for the Environment&#x27;s last published report on Lake Lugano dates from 1995. To summarise that report:
*at that time measurements indicated some improvement, but this was unlikely to continue at the same pace
*there were almost permanent polluted layers at the bottom of the very deep lake
*oxygen was scarce and could not be found below depth
*as a result phosphorus levels were increasing at this depth
*phosphorus levels in the northern basin were six times too high and in the southern basin twice too high
*will take many decades to clean
*the lake could be said to be &quot;chronically sick&quot;
*in the Italian part of the lake only 20% of the population were connected to sewage treatment plants with phosphorus filters (not that all Swiss areas were connected either).

The Swiss-Italian organisation CIPAIS in its most recent published report says:
The Italian environmental group Legambiente, in its 2007 study of all northern Italian lakes, found Lake Lugano to be the most polluted of all.
According to Legambiente, the only reason swimming was not banned on the Italian Lakes was because the state of Lombardy changed the law. They state that pollution levels in the lakes do not conform to European rulings and the lack of sewage treatment is illegal.

Their 2010 measurements found samples taken at Ponte Tresa, Osteno and Porto Ceresio to be &quot;heavily polluted&quot; (more than 1,000 UFC/100 ml intestinal enterococci and/or greater than 2000 UFC/100 ml &quot;E. coli&quot;).

==Fauna==

The lake is full of fish. Apart from a few protected areas, such as the mouth of the River Cuccio in Porlezza, fishing is allowed anywhere, although according to various regulations. Protected species are the bleak and the white clawed crayfish (&quot;Austropotamobius pallipes&quot;). The bleak is almost extinct here, unlike in Lago Maggiore, and planning is under way for the controlled repopulation of the lake, particularly around Ponte Tresa.

In 1895 the brook trout was introduced from Lake Zug, while between 1894 and 1897 the common whitefish was introduced. Since 1950 attempts have been made to introduce the whitefish &quot;Coregonus macrophthalmus&quot; from Lake Neuchâtel, but it has not established itself effectively.

The Common Roach is present in large numbers and took around ten years to colonise the entire lake, thereby replacing the bleak. Still present are the European chub, tench, carp and a few examples of European perch, largemouth bass, zander and burbot. Recently the wels catfish and pigo have been spotted.

==Fossils==
The whole area behind the southern shores of Lake Lugano is rich in fossils. The focal point of these fossil deposits is Monte San Giorgio, where since the 19th century many fossils have been found dating from the mid-Triassic (around 220 million years ago). The deposits on Monte San Giorgio stretch towards the west into Italian territory and the deposits of Besano. Fossils dating from the early Jurassic (around 180 million years ago) have also been found along the southern shores but more towards the east and Osteno.

<doc id="297262" wikidata="Q243791" url="?curid=297262" title="Amnat Charoen province">
<text>Amnat Charoen (, ; , ) is one of Thailand&#x27;s seventy-six provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;) and lies central northeastern Thailand, also called Isan. Neighbouring provinces are (clockwise from the south) Ubon Ratchathani, Yasothon, and Mukdahan. To the east it borders Salavan of Laos. Its name is a concatenation of อำนาจ (&quot;authority, power&quot;) and เจริญ (&quot;prosperous&quot;).

==Geography==
The province is in the Mekong valley. In dry season, from February to May, water in Mekong River declines, and allows islands to appear. Islands include Kaeng Tanglang at Si Sombun Village, close to Amphoe Chanuman, and Kaeng Hin Khan at Ban Hin Khan, 30 kilometres south of Amphoe Chanuman. The other two rivers in the province are the Lam Sae Bok and Lam Sae Bai.
The total forest area is or 9.5 percent of provincial area.
===National park===
There is one national park, along with five other national parks, make up region 9 (Ubon Ratchathani) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas.
* Phu Sa Dok Bua National Park, 

==History==
Amnat Charoen gained city status during the reign of King Rama III. It was first administered from Nakhon Khemarat, and later from Ubon Ratchathani. It became a province in its own right on 12 January 1993, when it was split off from Ubon Ratchathani. It is thus one of the four newest provinces of Thailand, together with Nong Bua Lam Phu and Sa Kaeo, both also established in 1993, and Bueng Kan, established in 2011.

==Economy==

The province is overwhelmingly agricultural. In 2008, Amnat Charoen locals developed the so-called &quot;Dhamma agriculture&quot; model based on self-governance and aimed at making the province a hub for organic farming. According to the Office of Agriculture Economics, Amnat Charoen in 2016 had a total of 883,499 rai planted in hom Mali rice. Sugarcane plantations increased from 40,688 rai in 2015 to 51,446 rai in 2016.

==Symbols==
In the middle of the provincial seal is an image of the Buddha called Phra Mongkol Ming Muang. Also known as Phra Yai (Big Buddha), this 20 m high statue is among the most sacred in the city of Amnat Charoen.

The provincial tree is &quot;Hopea ferrea&quot;. The provincial aquatic life is the Siamese mud carp (&quot;Henicorhynchus siamensis&quot;). 

The provincial slogan is &quot;Phra Mongkhon, seven river basins, sacred caves, Phra Lao, beautiful islands and mountain, precious silk and religious people&quot;.

==Administrative divisions==
===Provincial government===
The province is divided into seven districts (&quot;amphoe&quot;). The districts are further divided into 56 subdistricts (&quot;tambon&quot;) and 653 villages (&quot;muban&quot;).
===Local government===
As of 26 November 2019 there are: one Amnat Charoen Provincial Administration Organization (&quot;&quot;) and 24 municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. Amnat Charoen has town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. Further 23 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;).The non-municipal areas are administered by 39 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations - SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.

<doc id="297266" wikidata="Q349363" url="?curid=297266" title="Charles Blount, 8th Baron Mountjoy">
<text>Charles Blount, 1st Earl of Devonshire, KG (pronounced &quot;Blunt&quot;; 15633 April 1606) was an English nobleman and soldier who served as Lord Deputy of Ireland under Queen Elizabeth I, and later as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland under King James I.

He succeeded to the family title as 8th Baron Mountjoy in 1594, before commanding the Crown&#x27;s forces during the final years of Tyrone&#x27;s Rebellion. He was able to defeat Tyrone and the Spanish at the Battle of Kinsale, and captured his headquarters at Dungannon before peace was agreed at the Treaty of Mellifont in 1603.

The old title of Earl of Devon was recreated for him in 1603, after returning to England, but he is usually referred to as Lord Mountjoy, his title during the most important part of his career, in Ireland. Since it was much later decided that the &quot;Devon&quot; earldom had not in fact become extinct, but was merely &quot;in abeyance&quot; in 1603, he is usually now regarded retrospectively as the 1st Earl of Devonshire. He is not related to the later Cavendish Earls (then Dukes) of Devonshire from the second creation in 1618.

==Early life==
Charles Blount was born in 1563, the second son of James, 6th Baron Mountjoy and Catherine, only daughter of Sir Thomas Leigh (Commissioner for Suppression of the Monasteries). Charles Blount was among the most distinguished of the family, succeeding as 8th Baron Mountjoy on the death in 1594 of his unmarried elder brother William, 7th Baron Mountjoy. The good fortune of his youthful and handsome looks found favour with Queen Elizabeth I which aroused the jealousy of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, leading to a duel between the two courtiers, who later became close friends.

Charles Blount was returned to the Commons as MP for St Ives, Cornwall in 1584 and for Bere Alston in 1586 and 1593, before entering the House of Lords in 1594.

Between 1586 and 1598, Charles spent most of his time on the Continent, serving in the Netherlands and Brittany. He joined Lord Essex and Sir Walter Raleigh in their expedition to the Azores in 1597, along with his distant cousin, Sir Christopher Blount. (Sir Christopher had married Essex&#x27;s mother, Lettice Knollys, Dowager Countess of Leicester, and he was afterwards executed for complicity in Essex&#x27;s treason.)

== Ireland ==
The downfall of Lord Essex did no damage to Lord Mountjoy&#x27;s career. After the failure of his rebellion, Essex shocked many by denouncing his sister Penelope, who was Mountjoy&#x27;s mistress, as a traitor, which inevitably raised the question of his own possible involvement; but the Crown, anxious to retain Mountjoy&#x27;s services, and also to show as much leniency as possible to the defeated rebels, simply ignored the accusation.

On 24 February 1600, Mountjoy landed in Ireland as Lord Deputy following Lord Essex and in the ensuing years brought the Nine Years&#x27; War to an end. The leader of the rebellion, Hugh O&#x27;Neill, Earl of Tyrone, wrote about Mountjoy&#x27;s &quot;refined manners&quot; that he would lose a whole season of campaigning &quot;while waiting until breakfast is prepared to his mind!&quot;. Despite this, Mountjoy proved that he was quite qualified to pursue the war.

In early 1600, Mountjoy had dispatched Sir Henry Docwra with an army of 4,200 troops to land at Culmore to erect a fortress commanding the shores of Lough Foyle in the north-west of Ulster. To prevent Hugh O&#x27;Neill from sending a strong force to repulse Dowcra&#x27;s forces, Mountjoy advanced in force from Dublin to Newry causing O&#x27;Neill to fear a southern advance into Tyrone.

Mountjoy aimed to avoid the mistakes of previous Lords-Deputy. After the Battle of Moyry Pass, he had it cleared and a garrison established there. It had long been a problem for English forces advancing into Ulster from the south. He also established posts with garrisons at Mountnorris and Armagh.

On 13 July 1601, Mountjoy with his army along with Turlough MacHenry O&#x27;Neill of the Fews who had recently switched to the English side in the war, had a stand-off with Hugh O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s forces at the River Blackwater. After a few shots in vain from either side, O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s forces withdrew and Mountjoy sent his forces to occupy the ruined Blackwater fort destroyed by O&#x27;Neill in 1595. Later O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s forces attacked Mountjoy&#x27;s camp before withdrawing. In response, the Lord-Deputy sent his forces across the river where they found strong artificially fortified fords, which would have held out against the English.

By 15 July 1601, the Lord-Deputy had secured the surrender of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s ally Magennis. That month, Mountjoy had a new fort near the old Blackwater fort erected.

Mountjoy reported to the council in England that O&#x27;Neill was determined to prevent his forces from advancing into Tyrone and towards Dungannon. As such he initiated a policy of burning large quantities of corn to induce a famine to drive the rebels out of their strongholds.

Mountjoy set about trying to entice Hugh&#x27;s forces to come out and attack by fetching some materials for the new fort from the Tyrone side of the river as well as burning more corn. Further skirmishes between Mountjoy and O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s forces ensued during the summer of 1601.

Spanish forces had landed in Munster in August 1601, forcing Mountjoy to send his forces southwards leaving O&#x27;Neill remaining in his unbroken heartland of Tyrone. The Spanish arrival culminated in the Battle of Kinsale that December, which saw a major defeat of the rebels and their allies.

O&#x27;Neill during this time had also moved south to assist some of his allies, however, after some serious defeats at the hands of the forces of the Earl of Clanricarde of Connacht, he was in no place to offer any effective resistance once Mountjoy marched once more to Tyrone in the summer of 1602.

Mountjoy advanced to the location he found the previous summer at the River Blackwater, which commanded safe and secure passage into Tyrone, previously inaccessible, and set about erecting a new fort. O&#x27;Neill having observed this burnt his capital at Dungannon and fled to his last refuge in Glenconkeyne.

Advancing northwards through Tyrone, Mountjoy erected a fort in the townland of Magheralamfield, afterwards known as Mountjoy Castle. He also Christened the new fort at the Blackwater Charlemont Fort after himself.

Once in Tyrone, Mountjoy carried out a campaign of devastation throughout it resulting in the mass hunting of rebels, spoiling of corn, the burning of houses and the killing of churls so as to force the submission of O&#x27;Neill and his remaining allies. Most symbolically Mountjoy had the inauguration site of the O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s at Tullyhogue Fort destroyed.

On 30 March 1603, six days after the death of Elizabeth and the accession of James I, O&#x27;Neill made peace with Mountjoy, signing the Treaty of Mellifont. Mountjoy continued in office with the more distinguished title of Lord-Lieutenant (1603–1604). He declared amnesty for the rebels and granted them honourable terms, which caused some severe criticism from England. He showed similar moderation in putting down the abortive risings in Cork, Waterford and Wexford, where the aldermen, apparently with some vague idea of gaining greater toleration for Roman Catholics, refused to proclaim the new King: in Cork, three insurgents were hanged after a summary trial, but the rest were acquitted or pardoned.

As part of the Plantation of Ulster, the majority of the barony of Loughinsholin was detached from County Tyrone and made part of the newly created County Londonderry. The rest of Loughinsholin along with the northern parts of Dungannon barony were merged to create the short-lived barony of Mountjoy. It would later be amalgamated with the barony of Dungannon.

==Later life==
On his return to England, Lord Mountjoy served as one of Sir Walter Raleigh&#x27;s judges in 1603, and in the same year King James I appointed him Master of the Ordnance as well as creating him Earl of Devonshire, granting him extensive estates. He was one of the founder members of the Spanish Company re-founded by royal charter in 1605.

Mountjoy&#x27;s long-term successor in Ireland was Sir Arthur Chichester. Ireland remained in a state of some tension, with a number of disgruntled Gaelic Irish allies of the Crown angered by Mountjoy&#x27;s generous terms to the Earls of Tyrone and Tyrconnell which meant land that had been promised to them had now been restored to the earls.

In 1607, a year after Mountjoy&#x27;s death, the flight of the Earls took place. The following year a former government ally Sir Cahir O&#x27;Doherty attacked and burned Derry, launching O&#x27;Doherty&#x27;s Rebellion. The flight and the rebellion led to the Plantation of Ulster, something that had not been envisaged by Mountjoy when he had made peace in 1603.

==Marriage==

Towards the end of his life, on 26 December 1605 at Wanstead House near London, in a ceremony conducted by his chaplain William Laud, afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury, he married his long-time mistress Lady Penelope (died 7 July 1607), formerly wife of Robert, 3rd Baron Rich (later 1st Earl of Warwick) and sister of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex.

After the execution of her brother in 1601, Lord Rich divorced her in the ecclesiastical courts. The marriage was carried out in defiance of canon law and resulted in the disgrace of both parties, who were banished from King James I&#x27;s court circles. The Earl and Countess of Devonshire continued to live together as husband and wife with their illegitimate children until his death a few months later in the following year.

==Illegitimate progeny==
His illegitimate children by his mistress Lady Rich, of whom he acknowledged the paternity, included:
*Penelope Rich (1592–?) – despite her surname, she was a daughter of Penelope by Blount
*Mountjoy Blount, 1st Earl of Newport (1597–1666)
*Sir Saint John Blount – baptized at St Clement Danes with the name &#x27;Scipio Rich&#x27;, 8 December 1597. Saint John Blount, being described as the brother of Mountjoy, Lord Mountjoy, was made a Knight of the Bath on 1 February 1625 at the coronation of King Charles I, along with his nephew Robert Rich, son of his half brother the 2nd Earl of Warwick. His daughter Penelope (died probably before 1651) was the wife of Dr. Stephen Goffe.
*Ruth Blount (1600–1694)
*Isabella (Elizabeth) Blount
*Charles Blount (1605–1627)

Lord Devonshire left no legitimate children, and so his hereditary titles became extinct at his death on 3 April 1606 at Savoy House, London. His young contemporary, John Ford wrote one of his two earliest works, &quot;Fame&#x27;s Memorial&quot;, as an elegy of 1169 lines on the recently deceased Charles Blount, 1st Earl of Devonshire. Ford has an acrostic – a series of lines whose first letters spell a word or name – in his prefatory dedication of the elegiac poem to Penelope Devereux, countess of Devonshire.

<text>Allusion, or alluding, is a figure of speech that makes a reference to someone or something by name (a person, object, location, etc.) without explaining how it relates to the given context, so that the audience must realize the connection in their own minds. When a connection is directly and explicitly explained (as opposed to indirectly implied), it is instead often simply termed a reference. In the arts, a literary allusion puts the alluded text in a new context under which it assumes new meanings and denotations. Literary allusion is closely related to parody and pastiche, which are also &quot;text-linking&quot; literary devices.

In a wider, more informal context, an allusion is a passing or casually short statement indicating broader meaning. It is an incidental mention of something, either directly or by implication, such as &quot;In the stock market, he met his Waterloo.&quot;

==Scope of the term==
In the most traditional sense, &quot;allusion&quot; is a literary term, though the word has also come to encompass indirect references to any source, including allusions in film or the visual arts. In literature, allusions are used to link concepts that the reader already has knowledge of, with concepts discussed in the story. It is not possible to predetermine the nature of all the new meanings and inter-textual patterns that an allusion will generate. In the field of film criticism, a filmmaker&#x27;s intentionally unspoken visual reference to another film is also called an homage. It may even be sensed that real events have allusive overtones, when a previous event is inescapably recalled by a current one. &quot;Allusion is bound up with a vital and perennial topic in literary theory, the place of authorial intention in interpretation&quot;, William Irwin observed, in asking &quot;What is an allusion?&quot;

Without the hearer or reader comprehending the author&#x27;s intention, an allusion becomes merely a decorative device. Allusion is an economical device, a figure of speech that uses a relatively short space to draw upon the ready stock of ideas, cultural memes or emotion already associated with a topic. Thus, an allusion is understandable only to those with prior knowledge of the covert reference in question, a mark of their cultural literacy.

==Allusion as cultural bond==
The origin of is from the Latin noun &quot;a playing with, a reference to&quot;, from &quot;to play, jest, make fun of&quot;, a compound of &quot;to&quot; + &quot;to play&quot;. Recognizing the point of allusion&#x27;s condensed riddle also reinforces cultural solidarity between the maker of the allusion and the hearer: their shared familiarity with allusion bonds them. Ted Cohen finds such a &quot;cultivation of intimacy&quot; to be an essential element of many jokes. Some aspect of the referent must be invoked and identified for the tacit association to be made; the allusion is indirect in part because &quot;it depends on something more than mere substitution of a referent&quot;.

The allusion depends as well on the author&#x27;s intent; a reader may search out parallels to a figure of speech or a passage, of which the author was unaware, and offer them as unconscious allusions—coincidences that a critic might not find illuminating. Addressing such issues is an aspect of hermeneutics.

William Irwin remarks that allusion moves in only one direction: &quot;If A alludes to B, then B does not allude to A. The Bible does not allude to Shakespeare, though Shakespeare may allude to the Bible.&quot; Irwin appends a note: &quot;Only a divine author, outside of time, would seem capable of alluding to a later text.&quot; This is the basis for Christian readings of Old Testament prophecy, which asserts that passages are to be read as allusions to future events.

Allusion differs from the similar term &quot;intertextuality&quot; in that it is an intentional effort on the author&#x27;s part. The success of an allusion depends in part on at least some of its audience &quot;getting&quot; it. Allusions may be made increasingly obscure, until at last they are understood by the author alone, who thereby retreats into a private language.

==Academic analysis of the concept of allusions==
In discussing the richly allusive poetry of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Georgics&quot;, R. F. Thomas distinguished six categories of allusive reference, which are applicable to a wider cultural sphere. These types are:
# Casual reference, &quot;the use of language which recalls a specific antecedent, but only in a general sense&quot; that is relatively unimportant to the new context;
# Single reference, in which the hearer or reader is intended to &quot;recall the context of the model and apply that context to the new situation&quot;; such a specific single reference in Virgil, according to Thomas, is a means of &quot;making connections or conveying ideas on a level of intense subtlety&quot;;
# Self-reference, where the &quot;locus&quot; is in the poet&#x27;s own work;
# Corrective allusion, where the imitation is clearly in opposition to the original source&#x27;s intentions;
# Apparent reference &quot;which seems clearly to recall a specific model but which on closer inspection frustrates that intention&quot;; and
# Multiple reference or conflation, which refers in various ways simultaneously to several sources, fusing and transforming the cultural traditions.

A type of literature has grown round explorations of the allusions in such works as Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot; or T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot;.

==Examples==
In Homer, brief allusions could be made to mythic themes of generations previous to the main narrative because they were already familiar to the epic&#x27;s hearers: one example is the theme of the Calydonian boarhunt. In Hellenistic Alexandria, literary culture and a fixed literary canon known to readers and hearers made a densely allusive poetry effective; the poems of Callimachus offer the best-known examples.

Martin Luther King Jr., alluded to the Gettysburg Address in starting his &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech by saying &quot;Five score years ago...&quot;; his hearers were immediately reminded of Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s &quot;Four score and seven years ago&quot;, which opened the Gettysburg Address. King&#x27;s allusion effectively called up parallels in two historic moments without overwhelming his speech with details.

A sobriquet is an allusion. By metonymy one aspect of a person or other referent is selected to identify it, and it is this shared aspect that makes a sobriquet evocative: for example, &quot;the city that never sleeps&quot; is a sobriquet of (and therefore an allusion to) New York.

<text>William Blount ( ; April 6, 1749March 21, 1800) was an American politician, landowner and Founding Father who was one of the signers of the Constitution of the United States. He was a member of the North Carolina delegation at the Constitutional Convention of 1787 and led the efforts for North Carolina to ratify the Constitution in 1789 at the Fayetteville Convention. He then served as the only governor of the Southwest Territory and played a leading role in helping the territory gain admission to the union as the state of Tennessee. He was selected as one of Tennessee&#x27;s initial United States Senators in 1796, serving until he was expelled for treason in 1797.

Born to a prominent North Carolina family, Blount served as a paymaster during the American Revolutionary War. He was elected to the North Carolina legislature in 1781, where he remained in one role or another for most of the decade, except for two terms in the Continental Congress in 1782 and 1786. Blount pushed efforts in the legislature to open the lands west of the Appalachians to settlement. As governor of the Southwest Territory, he negotiated the Treaty of Holston in 1791, bringing thousands of acres of Indian lands under U.S. control.

An aggressive land speculator, Blount gradually acquired millions of acres in Tennessee and the Trans-Appalachian West. He owned slaves as well. His risky land investments left him in debt, and in the 1790s, he conspired of his own accord to have Great Britain take over Spanish-controlled Louisiana and Florida in the hope of boosting local land prices. When the conspiracy was uncovered in 1797, he was expelled from the Senate and became the first federal official to face impeachment. However, Blount remained popular in Tennessee and served in the state senate during the last years of his life.

==Early life==
Blount was born on Easter Sunday at Rosefield, the home of his maternal grandfather, John Gray, in Windsor, Province of North Carolina. He was the eldest child of Jacob Blount (1726–1789) and Barbara Gray Blount. The Blounts had gradually risen to prominence in the first half of the 18th century as William&#x27;s grandfather and father had steadily built the family fortune. In the years following William&#x27;s birth, Jacob Blount built a plantation, Blount Hall, in Pitt County, North Carolina.


Outside of tutors, William and his brothers had little formal education but were involved in their father&#x27;s business ventures at a young age. Jacob Blount raised livestock, cotton, and tobacco, produced turpentine, and operated a mill and horse racing track for the local community. His land acquisitions, consisting of several thousand acres by the end of the 1760s, taught his sons the profit potential of aggressive land speculation.

During the Regulator Movement of the late 1760s and early 1770s, the Blounts remained loyal to the North Carolina government. Jacob Blount, a justice of the peace, furnished Governor William Tryon&#x27;s army with supplies as it marched to defeat the Regulators at the Battle of Alamance in 1771. William Blount, along with his brothers Jacob and John Gray Blount, were among Tryon&#x27;s soldiers, though they saw little action.

==American Revolution==
As tensions heightened between Great Britain and the Thirteen Colonies in the 1770&#x27;s, the Blount family gradually aligned themselves with the Patriot cause. In April 1776, Jacob Blount was appointed paymaster of the 2nd North Carolina Regiment, and William Blount was appointed paymaster for the New Bern District Brigade of the North Carolina militia the following month. William&#x27;s brothers, Reading and Thomas Blount, accepted commissions in the Continental Army. The Blounts provided provisions for the Continental Army and militias, and they profited both financially and politically from the war. They also began looking westward, with John Gray Blount acquiring a portion of Richard Henderson&#x27;s Transylvania Purchase in mid-1776.

In December 1776, William Blount was appointed paymaster of the 3rd North Carolina Regiment and spent the first few months of 1777 with the unit as it marched north to join George Washington&#x27;s forces in the defense of Philadelphia. In November 1777, political rivals in the North Carolina legislature removed Blount as paymaster, though he was restored to the office in April 1778. He helped organize regiments for the defense of Charleston, South Carolina, which fell to the British in 1780 during the siege of Charleston. William&#x27;s brother, Thomas, was captured during the siege.

In early 1780, Blount was appointed official commissary to General Horatio Gates, who had arrived in North Carolina to command Patriot forces in the South. Blount was present at Gates&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Camden in August 1780 and in the confusion of battle lost $300,000 intended to be used to pay Patriot soldiers.

==North Carolina politics and the Continental Congress==
In late 1779, Blount ran for the vacant New Bern state House of Commons seat against Richard Dobbs Spaight in a campaign described by Blount&#x27;s biographer, William Masterson, as &quot;violent in an age of fierce elections.&quot; Spaight won by a narrow margin, but Blount successfully convinced election officials that voter fraud had occurred, and the election was voided. In the weeks following the Battle of Camden, Blount again ran for the seat and this time was successful. He took his seat in the House of Commons in January 1781.

In May 1782, Blount was elected one of North Carolina&#x27;s four delegates to the Continental Congress. At the Congress&#x27;s 1782 session, Blount helped defeat a poll tax and a liquor tax and opposed a reduction of the army. He also agreed to consider a land cession act to satisfy North Carolina&#x27;s massive tax debt owed to the Confederation. Blount left Philadelphia in January 1783 and resigned from Congress three months later to accept an appointment to the North Carolina House of Commons steering committee.

During the House&#x27;s 1783 and 1784 sessions, Blount introduced several bills that would prove critical in the early history of what is now Tennessee. One bill, known as the &quot;Land Grab Act,&quot; opened the state&#x27;s lands west of the Appalachians (i.e., the parts of Tennessee not under Indian domain) to settlement. One individual who took advantage of this act was militia captain James White, who acquired a tract of land that would later become Knoxville, Tennessee. Another bill rendered soldiers with at least two years of military service eligible for land grants. Some soldiers used their grants to acquire land in the Tennessee Valley, while others sold their grants to the Blounts and other land speculators. In 1784, Blount sponsored a bill establishing the city of Nashville in what was then the Cumberland settlements.

In June 1784, Blount sponsored another bill critical to early Tennessee history—a bill calling for North Carolina lands west of the Appalachians (i.e., modern Tennessee) to be ceded to the Continental Congress to satisfy the state&#x27;s share of the nation&#x27;s tax burden. The bill was hotly contested but passed by a 52-43 margin. Opponents of the cession gained control of the House and repealed the act in October, but not before a movement by the Tennessee Valley residents to establish a separate state, known as the State of Franklin, had gained momentum. A friend of both North Carolina Governor Richard Caswell and Franklinite leader John Sevier, Blount waffled on the Franklin issue for the next four years.

Despite the cession debacle, Blount was elected to the Continental Congress for the 1785 session. As he prepared to depart, however, word came that the Congress had appointed a commission to negotiate a new treaty, eventually known as the Treaty of Hopewell, with the southern tribes. Fearing the new treaty would be unfavorable to North Carolina, Blount, with Governor Caswell&#x27;s blessing, headed south in hopes of negotiating a separate treaty for the state. He arrived too late, however, and the Hopewell Treaty negotiated by the commissioners returned a sizeable portion of western lands claimed by North Carolina speculators to the Indians. Fearing a backlash back home, Blount merely signed the treaty as a witness.

In March 1786, Blount hurried to New York to take his seat in the Continental Congress, hoping to prevent ratification of the Hopewell Treaty, but once again he arrived too late, and the treaty was ratified. Disappointed, he went home, but with anger rising over his handling of the Hopewell Treaty, he returned to the Continental Congress in November 1786. In March 1787, Blount was chosen as one of five delegates to represent North Carolina at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. Blount arrived at the convention on June 20, after debates had already begun. He sent a copy of the Virginia Plan (in violation of Convention rules), and, expressing pessimism in the Convention&#x27;s outcome, he stayed for just a few days before heading to New York to rejoin the Continental Congress in early July. He was present for the Congress&#x27;s debate and passage of the Northwest Ordinance and heard Henry Knox&#x27;s report recommending a North Carolina land cession. By August 7, however, he had returned to the Convention in Philadelphia for final debates. Still reeling from the fallout from the Hopewell Treaty, he was wary of signing the final document but was finally convinced by Gouverneur Morris to do so.

Confident that North Carolina would gain more than it would lose with the new Constitution, Blount returned home to campaign for its ratification. Elected to the North Carolina Senate from Pitt County in 1788 and 1789, Blount and his allies successfully countered attempts by anti-federalists Willie Jones and William Lenoir to thwart adoption of the new Constitution, and North Carolina voted for its ratification in November 1789. On December 1, the state legislature voted to cede its trans-Appalachian lands to the new federal government. Blount sought one of North Carolina&#x27;s inaugural U.S. Senate seats in November 1789 but was defeated by Benjamin Hawkins.

==Southwest Territory==
Congress accepted North Carolina&#x27;s western cession, which consisted of what is now Tennessee, on April 2, 1790. In May, the Southwest Territory was created from the new cession and was to be governed under the Northwest Ordinance. On June 8, President George Washington appointed Blount governor of the new territory. Blount visited Washington at Mount Vernon on September 18 and was sworn in by Supreme Court Justice James Iredell two days later. In October 1790, he set up a temporary capital at William Cobb&#x27;s house, Rocky Mount, in what is now Piney Flats, Tennessee, and began organizing a government for the new territory.

The western frontiersmen were initially skeptical of Blount, who came across as an aristocratic Easterner. Blount managed to gain their trust, however, by recommending John Sevier and James Robertson as brigadier generals of the territorial militia, and appointing Landon Carter, Stockley Donelson and Gilbert Christian as colonels. Former Franklinites appointed to lower government offices included Joseph Hardin, William Cage, James White, Dr. James White and Francis Alexander Ramsey. Others receiving appointments included future president Andrew Jackson, future governor Archibald Roane and naval officer George Farragut. Blount hired his half-brother, Willie Blount, as a personal secretary and recruited Fayetteville, North Carolina, publisher George Roulstone to establish a newspaper for the new territory, known as the &quot;Gazette&quot;.

In December 1790, following his trip to the Cumberland territories, Blount&#x27;s family joined him at Rocky Mount. The following year, he chose James White&#x27;s Fort, near the confluence of the Holston and French Broad rivers, as the territory&#x27;s new capital. He named the capital &quot;Knoxville&quot; after his superior, the United States Secretary of War Henry Knox. Following the initial sale of lots in October 1791, he began construction of his mansion in the city.

Throughout his term as governor, Blount was torn between angry western frontiersmen, who demanded war against hostile Indians, and a War Department that consistently pushed for peaceful negotiations with the Indians. In June 1791, he negotiated the Treaty of Holston with Cherokee leader John Watts and several other chiefs, resolving land claims south of the French Broad and obtaining permission for a permanent road between the territory&#x27;s eastern settlements and the Cumberland settlements. In spite of this treaty, Chickamauga attacks increased the following year. Frustrated settlers demanded federal troops intervene, but the War Department refused, blaming settlers for intruding on Indian lands.

William Cocke, an ex-Franklinite, blamed Blount for the lack of action against the Chickamaugas and began publishing attacks against Blount in the &quot;Gazette&quot;. Blount responded with a series of articles (published under pseudonyms) rejecting Cocke and calling for patience. Following attacks by the Chickamaugas against Ziegler&#x27;s Station in 1792 and against Cavet&#x27;s Station in 1793, however, Blount was unable to contain the rage of frontiersmen and called up the militia. Sevier led the militia south into Georgia and attacked and destroyed several Chickamauga villages. Knox blasted Blount for the invasion and refused to issue pay for the militiamen. Blount finally negotiated a truce with the Chickamauga at the Tellico Blockhouse in 1794.

Toward the middle of his term, Blount began implementing the steps stipulated in the Northwest Ordinance for a territory to gain statehood. One of these steps was to call for the election of a legislature and submit nominees for appointments to a territorial council, which Blount did in 1794. On September 15, 1795, he directed county sheriffs to conduct a census. The census placed the territory&#x27;s population at 77,000, substantially more than the 60,000 required for statehood. Blount ordered a state constitutional convention to be held at Knoxville in January 1796, which he personally attended as part of the Knox County delegation. The government of the new state convened in late March 1796, before it had been officially admitted to the Union.

Blount realized he had little chance of defeating Sevier in a race for governor of the new state, so he instead sought one of the state&#x27;s two United States Senate seats. He received this appointment (along with William Cocke) on March 30, 1796, and headed to Philadelphia to campaign for Tennessee&#x27;s statehood. Blount&#x27;s brother, Thomas (a Congressman from North Carolina), along with James Madison, convinced the house to vote for Tennessee&#x27;s admission to the Union on May 6. The Senate voted to admit the new state on May 31.

==Blount Conspiracy==

Throughout the 1780s and 1790s, William Blount and his brothers gradually bought up large amounts of western lands, acquiring over 2.5 million acres by the mid-1790s. Much of this land was bought on credit, pushing the family deeply into debt. In 1795, the market for western lands collapsed, and land prices plummeted. A number of land speculators, including Blount associate David Allison, went bankrupt. Blount partnered with Philadelphia physician Nicholas Romayne in an attempt to sell land to British investors, but their efforts were unsuccessful. Compounding Blount&#x27;s problems, Timothy Pickering, who despised Blount, replaced Henry Knox as secretary of war in 1795.

Following France&#x27;s defeat of Spain in the War of the Pyrenees, land speculators, already on the financial brink, worried that the French would eventually gain control of Spanish-controlled Louisiana and shut off American access to the Mississippi River. In hopes of preventing this, Blount and his friend, Indian agent John Chisholm, concocted a plan to allow the British to gain control of Spanish-controlled Louisiana and Florida, expecting them in turn to give free access to both New Orleans and the Mississippi River to American merchants. The plan called for American territorial militias, with the aid of the British Royal Navy, to attack New Madrid, New Orleans, and Pensacola.

To help carry out the plan, Blount recruited Romayne, who never showed more than lukewarm support for the idea, and Knoxville merchant James Carey. Chisholm, meanwhile, sailed to England to recruit British supporters for the plan. In April 1797, Carey was at the Tellico Blockhouse near Knoxville when he gave a government agent a letter from Blount outlining the conspiracy. The agent turned the letter over to his superior, Colonel David Henley in Knoxville, and Henley in turn sent it to Pickering. Elated at the opportunity to crush Blount, Pickering turned the letter over to President John Adams.

Determining that the actions of Blount, a senator from Tennessee, constituted a crime, Adams sent Blount&#x27;s letter to the Senate, where it was presented on July 3, 1797, while Blount was out for a walk. When Blount returned, the clerk read the contents of the letter aloud as Blount stood in stunned silence. Vice President Thomas Jefferson asked Blount if he had written the letter. Blount gave an evasive answer and asked that the matter be postponed until the following day, which was granted. On July 4, Blount refused to return to the Senate and had Cocke read a letter which again requested more time. The Senate rejected this request and formed an investigative committee. Ordered to testify before the committee, Blount initially attempted to flee by ship to North Carolina, but federal deputies seized the ship and most of his belongings. On July 7, Blount, after consulting with attorneys Alexander Dallas and Jared Ingersoll, testified before the committee and denied writing the letter. The following day, the House of Representatives voted 41 to 30 to hold impeachment hearings, and the Senate voted 25 to 1 to &quot;sequester&quot; Blount&#x27;s seat, effectively expelling him, with Henry Tazewell casting the lone dissenting vote.
Rather than await trial, Blount posted bail and fled to Tennessee. Chisholm remained in England in a debtors&#x27; prison for several months and confessed the entire scheme upon his return. Romayne was arrested and forced to testify before the committee, where he confessed to his part in the conspiracy. The House continued to consider evidence for Blount&#x27;s impeachment in early 1798. At one session on January 30, a bizarre brawl erupted between two congressmen, Matthew Lyon and Roger Griswold, in connection with the hearings. The Senate convened as a Court of Impeachment for the impeachment trial on December 17, 1798; though Blount refused to attend, in spite of a visit to Knoxville from the Senate sergeant-at-arms, the Senate heard arguments from his counsel, who argued lack of jurisdiction because Blount had not been an officer within the meaning of Article II, nor was he now an officer since he had been expelled and now held no federal office. On January 11, 1799, the Senate voted 14 to 11 to dismiss the impeachment for lack of jurisdiction. The ruling left unclear which (or both) of the two arguments were dispositive, though it became generally accepted that impeachment did not extend to senators.

The unraveling of the conspiracy destroyed Blount&#x27;s reputation at the national level and touched off a series of accusations between Federalists and Anti-federalists. George Washington called for swift justice against Blount and hoped he would be &quot;held in detestation by all good men.&quot; Abigail Adams called the conspiracy a &quot;diabolical plot&quot; and bemoaned the fact that there was no guillotine in Philadelphia. Pickering argued the conspiracy was part of a greater French plot and accused Thomas Jefferson of being involved. Oliver Wolcott suggested the conspiracy was an attempt to blackmail Spain.

==Later life==
While Blount&#x27;s national reputation was ruined, he remained popular in Tennessee. Upon his return to Knoxville in September 1797, he was paraded triumphantly through the city by a military procession led by James White and James Stuart. Most of his old Tennessee allies, among them Andrew Jackson, Joseph Anderson, James White, Charles McClung and William C. C. Claiborne, remained loyal, and helped repair his image among locals. Blount, likewise, adopted a staunchly pro-Western attitude.

In 1798, Congress appointed commissioners to survey the boundary between U.S. and Cherokee lands set by the Treaty of Holston. Concerned the commissioners would run the boundary in a way that favored the Cherokee over the settlers, Blount and Sevier sent agents to harass the commissioners. To further push Western interests, they sent representatives to federal treaty negotiations at the Tellico Blockhouse in 1798, frustrating federal negotiators sent by Congress and confusing Cherokee representatives.

In his report on the Tellico treaty, one of the commissioners, Elisha Hall, accused Blount of trying to thwart the treaty, and Blount sued him for libel. After the suit was thrown out by Judge David Campbell, Blount sought Campbell&#x27;s impeachment, calling him a &quot;meddling blockhead&quot;. In October 1798, William Blount was elected to Knox County&#x27;s state senate seat, following James White&#x27;s resignation. On December 3, he was named Speaker of the Senate. He spent his first few days in office pushing for Judge Campbell&#x27;s impeachment. The House voted to impeach Campbell on December 17, but he was acquitted by the Senate on December 26.

In March 1800, an epidemic swept through Knoxville, and several members of the Blount family fell ill. Blount was tending to his sick family when he, too, fell ill on March 11. After 10 days, he died on the night of March 21, 1800. He was buried at the First Presbyterian Church Cemetery a few blocks from his home in Knoxville. His half-brother, Willie, consolidated the family estate and took charge of the education of Blount&#x27;s children.

==Legacy==

Blount County, Tennessee, is named after Blount, as is the town of Blountville in Sullivan County. Grainger County and Maryville are both named after his wife, Mary Grainger Blount. William Blount High School and Mary Blount Elementary School, both in Blount County, are named after Blount and his wife, respectively. Blount County, Alabama, is named after William&#x27;s younger half-brother Willie Blount. Blount Street in Raleigh, North Carolina, and Blount Street in Madison, Wisconsin, are both named in Blount&#x27;s honor. Other entities named for Blount include Fort Blount, which operated in Jackson County, Tennessee, in the 1790s, and Blount College, the forerunner of the University of Tennessee, which was founded in Knoxville in 1794.

Blount&#x27;s home, Blount Mansion, still stands in Knoxville and is currently a museum operated by the non-profit Blount Mansion Association. The house has been designated a National Historic Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Blount&#x27;s childhood home in Pitt County, North Carolina, Blount Hall, burned down in the 1960s, though a historical marker stands near the site. A life-size bronze statue of Blount is part of the &quot;Signers&#x27; Hall&quot; exhibit at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. A plaque in the first floor rotunda of the North Carolina State Capitol honors Blount and the two other North Carolina signers of the Constitution, Richard Dobbs Spaight and Hugh Williamson.

==Family==
Blount&#x27;s father, Jacob (1726–1789), married Barbara Gray, the daughter of Scottish businessman John Gray, and they had eight children; William, Anne, John Gray, Louisa, Reading, Thomas, Jacob, and Barbara. After Barbara Gray&#x27;s death, Jacob married Hannah Salter, and they had five children, though only two lived to maturity, Willie and Sharpe. Thomas Blount represented North Carolina in the U.S. House of Representatives in the 1790s and 1800s. Willie Blount was governor of Tennessee from 1809 to 1815.

William Blount married Mary Grainger in 1778, and they had six children; Ann, Mary Louisa, William Grainger, Richard Blackledge, Barbara and Eliza. William Grainger Blount represented Tennessee in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1815 to 1819. Mary Louisa Blount was married to Congressman Pleasant Miller, and Barbara Blount was married to General Edmund P. Gaines.

<text>The  (), meaning &quot;strongholds of sovereignty&quot;, are a series of Spanish overseas territories scattered along the Mediterranean coast bordering Morocco, or that are closer to Africa than Europe. This term is used for those territories that have been a part of Spain since the formation of the modern country (1492–1556), as opposed to African territories acquired by Spain during the 19th and early 20th centuries in the Scramble for Africa.

Historically, a distinction was made between the so-called &quot;major places of sovereignty&quot;, comprising the autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla, and the &quot;minor places of sovereignty&quot;, referring to a number of uninhabited islands and a small peninsula along the coast. Now the term refers mainly to the latter.

Morocco has claimed those territories (except the island of Alborán, further away from Africa) since its independence in 1956.

== History ==
During the Reconquista and mainly following the conquest of Granada in 1492, forces of the Castilian and Portuguese kingdoms conquered and maintained numerous posts in North Africa for trade and as a defence against Barbary piracy.

In August 1415, the Portuguese conquered the city of Ceuta. In 1481, the papal bull &quot;Aeterni regis&quot; had granted all land south of the Canary Islands to Portugal. Only this archipelago and the possessions of Santa Cruz de la Mar Pequeña (1476–1524), Melilla (conquered by Pedro de Estopiñán in 1497), Villa Cisneros (founded in 1502 in current Western Sahara), Mazalquivir (1505), Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera (1508), Oran (1509–1708; 1732–1792), Algiers (1510–1529), Bugia (1510–1554), Tripoli (1511–1551), and Tunis (1535–1569) remained as Spanish territory in Africa. Finally, following the independence of Portugal after the end of the Spanish-led Iberian Union, Ceuta was ceded by Portugal to Spain in 1668.

In 1848, Spanish troops conquered the Islas Chafarinas. In the late 19th century, after the so-called Scramble for Africa, European nations had taken over colonial control of most of the African continent. The Treaty of Fez (signed on 30 March 1912) made most of Morocco a protectorate of France, while Spain assumed the role of protecting power over the northern part, called Spanish Morocco.

When Spain relinquished its protectorate and recognized Morocco&#x27;s independence in 1956, it did not give up these minor territories, as Spain had held them well before the establishment of its protectorate.

On 11 July 2002, Morocco stationed six gendarmes on Perejil Island, which was at the time a source of complaint by Spain. The Spanish Armed Forces responded by launching a military operation code-named Operation Romeo-Sierra. The operation was carried out by Spanish commandos of &quot;Grupo de Operaciones Especiales&quot;. 
The Spanish Navy and Air Force provided support; the six Moroccan navy cadets did not offer any resistance and were captured and evicted from the island. It has since been evacuated by both countries.
On 3 January 2020, 42 migrants went to the Chafarinas Islands; the Civil Guard ordered their immediate expulsion without following the legal procedure. The Spanish NGO &#x27;Walking Border&#x27; denounced the &quot;hot returns&quot; as violations of international law.

== Physical geography ==

In addition to Ceuta and Melilla, there are historically several minor &quot;plazas de soberanía&quot;:


Apart from these, there are two other islands usually considered within the &quot;plazas de soberanía&quot;. The disputed Perejil Island, a small uninhabited islet close to Ceuta, is considered by Spain to be a part of Ceuta and not a territory in its own right. Alboran Island (), another small island in the western Mediterranean, about 50 kilometres (31.05 miles) from the African coast and 90 kilometres (55.92 miles) from Europe, is administered as part of the municipality of Almería on the Iberian Peninsula.

==Political geography==
The &quot;plazas de soberanía&quot; are small islands and a peninsula off the coast of Morocco (the only peninsula, Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera, was an island until a 1934 storm formed a sand bridge with the mainland). They are guarded by military garrisons and administered directly by the Spanish central government.

Like Ceuta and Melilla, they are a part of Spain, therefore also part of the European Union, and their currency is the euro.

<text>Peter Jasper Akinola (born 27 January 1944, in Abeokuta) is the former Anglican Primate of the Church of Nigeria. He is also the former bishop of Abuja and Archbishop of Province III, which covered the northern and central parts of the country. When the division into ecclesiastical provinces was adopted in 2002, he became the first Archbishop of Abuja Province, a position he held until 2010. He is married and a father of six.

A &quot;low church&quot; Evangelical, Akinola emphasizes the Bible and the teachings of the apostles (apostolic tradition) in a particular way. As one of the leaders of the Global South within the Anglican Communion, Akinola has taken a firm stand against theological developments which he contends are incompatible with the biblical teachings of Christianity and orthodox Anglicanism, notably setting himself against any revisionist interpretations of the Bible and, in particular, opposing same-sex blessings, the ordination of non-celibate homosexuals and any homosexual practice. He was a leading name of conservatives throughout the Anglican Communion, including the Convocation of Anglicans in North America.

On 15 September 2009, Archbishop Nicholas Okoh, aged 57 years old, of Bendel Province, was elected the Primate of the Church of Nigeria at the conference of the House of Bishops in Umuahia. He succeeded Akinola on 25 March 2010.

==Biography==

Akinola was born in 1944 to a Yoruba family in Abeokuta in southwestern Nigeria. His father died when he was four years old and due to financial pressures Akinola had to leave school early. He learned carpentry and at twenty he had a successful furniture business and as patent-medicine seller. He had finished high school by distance education. He left his business, to study for the priesthood. He studied at a Nigerian Anglican Seminary and was ordained a deacon in 1978 and a priest in 1979 in the Anglican Church of Nigeria. Soon after ordination, he moved to the United States to study at the Virginia Theological Seminary, where he graduated in 1981 with a master&#x27;s degree.

Returning to Nigeria afterwards, Akinola was assigned to create an Anglican presence in the new capital Abuja which was about to be built. He holds it one of his greatest successes to have created out of nothing a vibrant Anglican community there. He was consecrated a bishop on 16 November 1989 and enthroned as the first Bishop of Abuja ten days later, at the inauguration of the new Diocese of Abuja on 26 November 1989. In 1997, he became archbishop of Province III of the Church of Nigeria, consisting of the northern dioceses of Nigeria. On 22 February 2000, he was elected primate of the Church of Nigeria, the second biggest church in the Anglican Communion, then numbering 18 million members. In 2002, he became Archbishop of the Abuja Province, a position he held until 2010.

Akinola was given the National Award of Commander of the Order of the Niger in December 2003.

In 2006 Akinola appeared on &quot;TIME magazine&quot;&#x27;s list of the world&#x27;s 100 most influential people in the category Leaders and Revolutionaries. However, in 2007 &quot;TIME&quot; magazine suggested that he &quot;has some explaining to do&quot; in relation to his support for legislation criminalising &quot;gay... organizations&quot; and &quot;Publicity, procession and public show of same-sex amorous relationship through the electronic or print media physically, directly, indirectly or otherwise&quot;.

In 2007, the Nigerian newspaper &quot;ThisDay&quot; gave him together with 17 others a &quot;Lifetime Achievement Award&quot;, stating in its citation: &quot;Called a bigot by some in the Anglican Church, his attitudes nonetheless represent a deep-rooted conservative tradition in African Christianity that is flourishing and growing.&quot; But he has been criticised by other sections of the international press, including the right-leaning &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; which in an editorial on 23 March 2007 characterised him as one of the &quot;extremists&quot; who had &quot;hijacked&quot; conservative Anglicanism, and as &quot;a deeply divisive figure&quot; who has &quot;&quot;defended new Nigerian legislation that makes &quot;cancerous&quot; (his word) same-sex activity punishable by up to five years&#x27; imprisonment.&quot;&quot;

Akinola was at one time president of the Christian Association of Nigeria, an ecumenical body bringing together 52 million Protestant, Catholic, and African independent Christians. During his presidency, the National Ecumenical Centre in Abuja was completed, which had been a building ruin for 16 years. Akinola was voted out of his position as national president of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in June 2007, and replaced by the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Nigeria, who polled 72 votes to Akinola&#x27;s 33 votes. This followed criticism of Akinola&#x27;s allegedly high handed leadership style and of his alleged failure to confront Nigerian president Obasanjo as other Christian leaders had. Subsequently, his candidacy as vice president was rejected by the General Assembly of the Christian Association of Nigeria.

In October 2009, he reacted to the Vatican&#x27;s proposed creation of personal ordinariates for disaffected traditionalist Anglicans by saying that although he welcomed ecumenical dialogue and shared moral theology with the Catholic Church, the current GAFCON structures already meet the spiritual and pastoral needs of conservative Anglicans in Africa.

In November 2009, Akinola signed an ecumenical statement known as the Manhattan Declaration calling on evangelicals, Catholics and Orthodox not to comply with rules and laws permitting abortion, same-sex marriage and other matters that go against their religious consciences.

In 2010, upon his retirement as Primate of Nigeria, he launched the Peter Akinola Foundation, a &quot;non-profit-making and non-governmental organisation that focuses on four main areas as Initiatives&quot;, respectively &quot;Youth at Crossroad&quot;, &quot;Mission and Evangelism&quot;, &quot;Stand in the Gap&quot; and &quot;Anglican Unity and Self Reliance&quot;.

On 21 November 2015, Peter lost his Mother Janet Amoke Akinola. She was aged 100 years.

== Church politics ==

=== Vision of the Church of Nigeria ===
One of Akinola&#x27;s first actions as primate was to convene 400 bishops, priests, lay members, and members of the Mothers&#x27; Union to discuss a new vision for the Church of Nigeria; it was chaired by Ernest Shonekan, a former Nigerian president. The vision the group posed was: &quot;The Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion) shall be; bible-based, spiritually dynamic, united, disciplined, self supporting, committed to pragmatic evangelism, social welfare and a Church that epitomizes the genuine love of Christ.&quot;

Part of the program of action included, for example,
* At the central level:
** Translating the books of the liturgy into additional languages
** Establishing a group of 3000 leading lay personalities who will take care of fundraising and relieve the bishops of this duty
** Establishing a legal support team to enforce the constitutional right of freedom of religion and worship
** Establishing colleges for theology and universities
** Providing internet access for the dioceses
* for each diocese:
** Training full-time itinerant evangelists
** Giving on-the-job training to priests and their wives
** Working out a social welfare program for less-privileged people
** Establishing a hospital with at least 30 beds
** Establishing secondary schools
* on the community level:
** Providing literacy courses for adults
** Setting up cottage industries for the unemployed

===Relations with the Anglican Communion===

In August 2003, he stated that if the celibate and gay Church of England priest Jeffrey John was consecrated as Bishop of Reading or the non-celibate gay American Episcopalian priest Gene Robinson was consecrated as Bishop of New Hampshire, the Church of Nigeria would leave the Anglican Communion. Several Anglican dioceses worldwide made similar statements, including the Anglican diocese in Sydney, Australia. Under pressure from the Archbishop of Canterbury, John withdrew from consideration for the bishopric and was subsequently appointed as Dean of St Albans in Hertfordshire. Gene Robinson&#x27;s consecration went forward, precipitating a crisis in the Anglican Communion. At the end of 2003, Akinola commissioned, together with Drexel Gomez, the primate of the Church in the Province of the West Indies, and Gregory Venables, Presiding Bishop of the Anglican Church of the Southern Cone, &quot;Claiming our Anglican Identity: The Case Against the Episcopal Church, USA&quot;, a paper for Anglican Communion primates discussing the conservative implications of Gene Robinson&#x27;s consecration.

His first reaction to the Windsor Report of 2004 was outspoken and critical, but the statement from the primates gathered at the first African Anglican Bishop&#x27;s Conference, headed by Akinola, was more moderate and expressed commitment to the future of the Anglican Communion. However, while strenuously supporting those parts of the Windsor Report that addressed the issue of the Anglican Communion&#x27;s treatment of non-heterosexuals, he has not followed with those parts that deplore overseas interventions in the Episcopal Church and has, on the contrary, set up a missionary body, the Convocation of Anglicans in North America, to formalise the ties between break-away Anglicans in the United States and the Church of Nigeria.

In September 2005, Akinola spoke out against the Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil&#x27;s deposition of an evangelical bishop and excommunication of over 30 priests.

In September 2005, the Church of Nigeria redefined its relationship with the Anglican Communion in its constitution, stating that it is in &quot;Communion with all Anglican churches, dioceses, and provinces that uphold and maintain the historic faith, doctrine, sacraments, and discipline of the one Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church.&quot; In a later press release, Akinola clarified, &quot;We want to state that our intention in amending the 2002 Constitution of the Church of Nigeria was to make clear that we are committed to the historic faith once delivered to the Saints, practice and the traditional formularies of the Church... We treasure our place within the worldwide family of the Anglican Communion but we are distressed by the unilateral actions of those provinces that are clearly determined to redefine what our common faith was once. We have chosen not to be yoked to them as we prefer to exercise our freedom to remain faithful. We continue to pray, however, that there will be a genuine demonstration of repentance.&quot;

On 12 November 2005, Akinola signed a Covenant of Concordat with the Presiding Bishops of the Reformed Episcopal Church and the Anglican Province of America.

Akinola refused to take Holy Communion in company with the Presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church, both at the Primates Meeting at Dromantine in 2005 and Dar es Salaam in 2007 and, on the latter occasion, he issued a press release to publicise and explain his refusal and that of others associated with him.

Akinola&#x27;s name as chairman of the Global South Primates heads the list of signatories to a letter to the Archbishop of Canterbury on 15 November 2005. In this letter, Europe is described as &quot;a spiritual desert&quot;, and the actions of the Church of England, in supporting the new civil partnerships laws, are said to give &quot;the appearance of evil&quot;.

Three of the bishops whose names appeared on the document at the Global South website (President Bishop Clive Handford of Jerusalem and the Middle East; the primate of the West Indies, Archbishop Drexel Gomez; and the presiding bishop of the Southern Cone, Bishop Gregory Venables) denied signing or approving the letter, and criticised it as &quot;an act of impatience&quot;, &quot;scandalous&quot;, and &quot;megaphone diplomacy&quot;.

Akinola was among the Global South leaders who opposed the consecration of Gene Robinson, the first openly gay bishop in the Anglican Communion. This group successfully pressed for the voluntary withdrawal of the Episcopalian representatives from the Anglican Consultative Council&#x27;s meeting in Nottingham in 2005. However, there were representatives present who intended to make a presentation supporting the full inclusion of gays and lesbians in the life of the Church, for which a vote of thanks was passed.

In August 2005, he denounced a statement of the Church of England&#x27;s House of Bishops on civil partnerships and called for the disciplining of the Church of England and Episcopal Church because the Communion had not changed its position on same-sex partnerships. Since the Anglican Communion has historically been defined as those churches in communion with the See of Canterbury, whose archbishop is head of the Church of England and thus &quot;primus inter pares&quot; in the Anglican Communion, this led to speculation that Akinola was positioning himself as a possible international leader of a more conservative church than the present Anglican Communion, which would no longer recognise the authority or primacy of the Archbishop of Canterbury. However, he attended the subsequent Primates Meeting in Tanzania in 2007, but he absented himself from all the celebrations of the Eucharist during that meeting.

In May 2007, he flew to the United States to install Martyn Minns, a priest who had left the Episcopal Church of the United States, as a bishop of the Church of Nigeria. Akinola reportedly ignored requests from both the presiding bishop and the Archbishop of Canterbury not to do this. However, the timing of the requests and their intent, relative to Akinola&#x27;s departure from Nigeria, is a contention. The newly installed bishop indicated at a press conference that the intention was to replace the Episcopal Church as an organ of the Anglican Communion with a structure formed under the auspices of the Church of Nigeria.

Akinola was one of the principal founders of the Global Anglican Future Conference, an international gathering of conservative Anglican bishops, and declared the Church of Nigeria to be in full communion with the newly created Anglican Church in North America, which was founded to develop an alternative—albeit one unrecognized by the Church of England—ecclesiastical structure to the Episcopal Church of the United States within the Anglican Communion.

=== Homosexuality laws in Nigeria ===
In September 2006, the Standing Committee of the Church of Nigeria, headed by Akinola, issued a &quot;Message to the Nation&quot;, taking up ten political controversies in Nigeria, among them a bill regarding same-sex relationships: &quot;The Church commends the law-makers for their prompt reaction to outlaw same-sex relationships in Nigeria and calls for the bill to be passed since the idea expressed in the bill is the moral position of Nigerians regarding human sexuality.&quot; The bill in question, as well as criminalising same-sex marriage, also proposed to criminalise &quot;Registration of Gay Clubs, Societies and organizations&quot; and &quot;Publicity, procession and public show of same-sex amorous relationship through the electronic or print media physically, directly, indirectly or otherwise&quot;, on penalty of up to 5 years of imprisonment. The United States State Department formally challenged the proposed legislation as a breach of Nigeria&#x27;s obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Some Western supporters of the bill justify the legislation on the basis that it does not support the stoning of non-heterosexual people under the Sharia code.

=== Reaction to Muslim cartoon riots ===
In February 2006, Muslim rioting over the Danish newspaper cartoon controversy spread to Nigeria. Rioters targeted Christians and their property, resulting in reportedly 43 deaths, 30 burned churches, and 250 destroyed shops and houses. Included among the victims was the family of one of Akinola&#x27;s bishops, Benjamin Kwashi, the Bishop of Jos, who was out of the country at the time. Kwashi&#x27;s home was broken into, and his wife was tortured and sexually assaulted, resulting in her temporary blindness. The rioters also severely beat Kwashi&#x27;s teenage son. In response to the rioting, Akinola stated in his capacity as president of the Christian Association of Nigeria: &quot;May we at this stage remind our Muslim brothers that they do not have the monopoly of violence in this nation.&quot; Some criticized this statement as inciting Christian counter-riots against Muslim targets in Nigeria. (For example, Christian mobs in Onitsha retaliated against Muslims, killing 80 persons, and burned a Muslim district with 100 homes, forcing hundreds of Muslims to flee the city.) American evangelical leader Rick Warren, however, wrote that Akinola&#x27;s angry response &quot;was no more characteristic than Nelson Mandela&#x27;s apartheid-era statement that &#x27;sooner or later this violence is going to spread to whites&#x27;&quot;.

<doc id="297280" wikidata="Q604831" url="?curid=297280" title="United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1960">
<text>The United Kingdom was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1960 with the song &quot;Looking High, High, High&quot;, written by John Watson, and performed by Bryan Johnson. The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through the &quot;Eurovision Song Contest British Final&quot;. In addition, the BBC was also the host broadcaster and staged the event at the Royal Festival Hall in London, after the winner of the , (NTS) from the , opted not to host the event.

==Background==
Prior to the 1960 contest, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest representing the United Kingdom twice: first in with the song &quot;All&quot; performed by Patricia Bredin, placing 7th, and most recently in with the song &quot;Sing, Little Birdie&quot; performed by Pearl Carr &amp; Teddy Johnson, placing 2nd.

==Before Eurovision==
=== &quot;Eurovision Song Contest British Final&quot; ===

The BBC organised the national final &quot;Eurovision Song Contest British Final&quot; to select its entry for the 1960 contest. The selection consisted of two semi-finals held on 2 February and 4 February 1960, and a final held on 6 February 1960. All three shows were broadcast on BBC Television presented by David Jacobs.

The songs were evaluated by seven fifteen-member regional juries: the South of England, the Midlands, the North of England, Scotland, Wales, the West of England, and Northern Ireland.

====Competing entries====
Twelve songs were shortlisted by the BBC to compete in the selection.

<text>Maclean&#x27;s, founded in 1905, is a Canadian magazine reporting on Canadian issues such as politics, pop culture, trends and current events. Its founder, publisher John Bayne Maclean, established the magazine to provide a uniquely Canadian perspective on current affairs and to &quot;entertain but also inspire its readers&quot;. Rogers Media, the magazine&#x27;s publisher since 1994 (after the company acquired Maclean-Hunter Publishing), announced in September 2016 that &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; would become a monthly beginning January 2017, while continuing to produce a weekly issue on the Texture app. In 2019, the magazine was bought by its current publisher, St. Joseph Communications.

==History==
&quot;The Business Magazine&quot; was founded in October 1905 by then 43-year-old publisher and entrepreneur Lt.-Col. John Bayne Maclean, who wrote the magazine&#x27;s aim was not &quot;merely to entertain but also to inspire its readers&quot;. It was renamed &quot;The Busy Man&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in December 1905, and began providing &quot;uniquely Canadian perspective&quot; on varied topics such as immigration, national defence, home life, women&#x27;s suffrage, and fiction. Maclean renamed the magazine after himself in 1911, dropping the previous title as too evocative of a business magazine for what had become a general interest publication.

Maclean hired Thomas B. Costain as editor in 1914. Costain invigorated the magazine&#x27;s coverage of the First World War, running first-person accounts of life on the Western Front as well as Maclean&#x27;s own critiques of Canada&#x27;s war effort. Maclean&#x27;s articles came into conflict with wartime censorship regulations, and Costain was ordered to remove one such article from the May 1918 issue as it was too critical of war policy.

Costain encouraged literary pieces and artistic expressions and ran fiction by Robert W. Service, Lucy Maud Montgomery, Herbert Joseph (Hopkins) Moorhouse, O. Henry, and Ray Bradbury; commentary by Stephen Leacock and illustrations by C. W. Jefferys, F. S. Coburn, and several Group of Seven members, including A. J. Casson, Arthur Lismer, and J. E. H. MacDonald.

In 1919, the magazine moved from monthly to fortnightly publication and ran an exposé of the drug trade by Emily Murphy. In 1925 the circulation of the magazine was 82,013 copies. Costain left the magazine to become a novelist and was replaced by J. Vernon Mackenzie who remained at the helm until 1926. During his tenure, &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; achieved national stature.

After Mackenzie, H. Napier Moore became the new editor. An Englishman, he saw the magazine as an expression of Canada&#x27;s role in the British Empire. Moore ultimately became a figurehead with the day-to-day running of the magazine falling to managing editor W. Arthur Irwin, a Canadian nationalist, who saw the magazine as an exercise in nation-building, giving it a mandate to promote national pride. Under Irwin&#x27;s influence, the magazine&#x27;s covers promoted Canadian scenery and imagery. The magazine also sponsored an annual short story contest on Canadian themes and acquired a sports department. Irwin was also responsible for orienting the magazine towards both small and big &quot;L&quot; Liberalism.

During the Second World War, &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; ran an overseas edition for Canadian troops serving abroad. By the time of its final run in 1946, the &quot;bantam&quot; edition had a circulation of 800,000. &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; war coverage featured war photography by Yousuf Karsh, later an internationally acclaimed portrait photographer, and articles by war correspondents John Clare and Lionel Shapiro.

Irwin officially replaced Moore as editor in 1945, and reoriented the magazine by building it around news features written by a new cadre of writers that included Pierre Berton, W. O. Mitchell, Scott Young, Ralph Allen, and Blair Fraser.

Allen became editor upon Irwin&#x27;s acceptance of a diplomatic posting in 1950. This era of the magazine was noted for its articles on the Canadian landscape and profiles of town and city life. The feature article, &quot;Canada&#x27;s North&quot;, by Pierre Berton, promoted a new national interest in the Arctic. Prominent writers during this period included Robert Fulford, Peter Gzowski, Peter C. Newman, Trent Frayne, June Callwood, McKenzie Porter, Robert Thomas Allen and Christina McCall. Exposés in the 1950s challenged the criminal justice system, explored LSD, and discussed artificial insemination.

&quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; published an editorial the day after the 1957 federal election announcing the predictable re-election of the St. Laurent Liberal Party. Written before the election results were known, Allen failed to anticipate the upset election of the Progressive Conservative Party under John Diefenbaker.

The magazine struggled to compete with television in the 1960s, increasing its international coverage and attempting to keep up with the sexual revolution through a succession of editors including Gzowski and Charles Templeton. Templeton quit after a short time at the helm due to his frustration with interference by the publishing company, Maclean-Hunter.

In 1961, &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; began publishing a French-language edition, &quot;Le Magazine Maclean&quot;, which survived until 1976, when the edition was absorbed by &quot;L&#x27;actualité&quot;.

Peter C. Newman became editor in 1971, and attempted to revive the magazine by publishing feature articles by writers such as Barbara Frum and Michael Enright, and poetry by Irving Layton. Walter Stewart, correspondent and eventually managing editor during this period, often clashed with Newman. In 1975 Newman brought in columnist Allan Fotheringham. Fotheringham made famous &quot;The Back Page&quot;, where he wrote for 27 years. Readers would go to read &quot;The Back Page&quot; first and then proceed to read the magazine from back to front.

Under Newman, the magazine switched from being a monthly general interest publication to a bi-weekly news magazine in 1975, and to a weekly newsmagazine three years later. The magazine opened news bureaus across the country and international bureaus in London, England, and Washington, D.C.

In 1982, when Newman retired, his managing editor, Kevin Doyle, became editor-in-chief. Doyle, a former reporter for &quot;The Canadian Press&quot; in Ottawa and a New York-based writer for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, expanded coverage of news and opened a Moscow bureau. On his watch the magazine published the first of yearly annual polls by Allan Gregg on the Canadian condition and the controversial university ranking issue, which became an annual mini-franchise for the magazine. At its peak, the magazine had 2.3 million weekly readers.

When Doyle left &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; in 1993, publisher Brian Segal appointed Robert Lewis as editor-in-chief. The managing editor under Doyle, Lewis had opened the magazine&#x27;s Ottawa bureau in 1975 when it became a newsmagazine. Under Doyle, Lewis was responsible for the launch of the first university ranking issue. While he was editor, writer Ann Dowsett Johnston won several National Magazine Awards (NMA) for the annual university issue and the magazine received an honourable mention in the 1998 Michener Awards for investigative reporting on sexual harassment and rape in the Canadian military. The article by Jane O&#x27;Hara also won two medals at the National Magazine Awards in 1999, including the President&#x27;s Medal, and &quot;remains one of the most significant and studied feature stories in the history of Canadian magazines,&quot; according to an official NMA history.

===21st century===
In 2001, Anthony Wilson-Smith became the 15th editor in the magazine&#x27;s history. He left the post at the end of February 2005 and was replaced by Kenneth Whyte, who also served as the magazine&#x27;s publisher.

Whyte, who previously edited &quot;Saturday Night&quot; and the &quot;National Post&quot;, brought a right-wing focus to the magazine, bringing in conservative columnist Mark Steyn, hiring Andrew Coyne away from the &quot;Post&quot;, and rehiring Barbara Amiel. He also added a comedy feature by former Liberal Party strategist Scott Feschuk, and a column by Andrew Potter, who previously wrote for left-leaning periodicals.

The October 4, 2010, edition of the magazine — published online September 24, 2010 — had a cover article with the headline: &quot;Quebec: The Most Corrupt Province&quot;, with the subheading, &quot;Why does Quebec claim so many of the nation&#x27;s political scandals?&quot; The cover illustration featured the Quebec Winter Carnival mascot, Bonhomme, carrying a suitcase overflowing with cash.

This depiction angered some Quebec politicians and organizers of the Carnival. Quebec Premier Jean Charest, wrote a letter to the editor of &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; condemning the magazine&#x27;s &quot;twisted form of journalism and ignorance&quot;, calling it &quot;sensationalist&quot;, &quot;far from serious&quot;, &quot;simplistic&quot;, and &quot;offensive&quot;, saying the editor &quot;discredited&quot; the magazine.

The magazine refused to back away from its position vis-à-vis corruption in Quebec. A bilingual editorial said that Charest&#x27;s response to the &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; article was an attempt to &quot;implicate ordinary citizens in a scandal created by [its] politicians&quot;. &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; acknowledged &quot;that neither its cover story nor an accompanying column provided empirical evidence that Quebec is more corrupt than other provinces&quot;. Yet, &quot;that does not mean we are required to suspend all judgment in the face of a preponderance of evidence—scandal after scandal at every level of government in the province, all of them involving not just one or two bad actors but systemic corruption.

Not all opinion in Quebec ran contrary to &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; position. The French-language &quot;La Presse&quot;, the province&#x27;s leading broadsheet, wrote that &quot;[&quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;] claim that Quebec has a higher number of scandals is &#x27;undeniable&#x27;.&quot;

Despite the steadfast position of &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; editorial board, the magazine&#x27;s publisher issued a qualified apology. On September 30, 2010, referring to the controversy, Brian Segal, the president of Rogers Publishing, apologized for &quot;any offence that the cover may have caused&quot;, saying the province &quot;is an important market for the company and we look forward to participating in the dynamic growth of the province and its citizens&quot;.

The organizers of Carnaval de Québec sued &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; over the cover showing the iconic figure, settling out of court in November 2010.

Rogers Communications announced in September 2016 that, due to falling print ad revenue, the magazine would change its printing schedule from weekly to monthly beginning in January 2017 although it would continue to offer weekly digital editions via Rogers&#x27; &quot;Texture&quot; digital bundle.

On March 20, 2019, Rogers announced a deal to sell the magazine to St. Joseph Communications. &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; continues to publish 12 editions annually.

==Canadian Islamic Congress complaint==

In December 2007, the Canadian Islamic Congress (CIC) launched complaints with the Canadian Human Rights Commission, British Columbia Human Rights Commission, and the Ontario Human Rights Commission against &quot;Maclean&#x27;s,&quot; accusing it of publishing 18 articles between January 2005 and July 2007 the group considered Islamophobic in nature, including a column by Mark Steyn titled &quot;The future belongs to Islam&quot;. According to the CIC complaint (as discussed in a &quot;National Post&quot; article by Ezra Levant), Maclean&#x27;s is &quot;flagrantly Islamophobic&quot; and &quot;subjects Canadian Muslims to hatred and contempt&quot;. In contrast, Levant said the complainants were &quot;illiberal censors who have found a quirk in our legal system, and are using it to undermine our Western traditions of freedom&quot;. On October 10, 2008, the B.C. Human Rights Tribunal dismissed the allegations of &quot;hate speech&quot; made by the Canadian Islamic Congress. Maclean&#x27;s consistently took the position that Steyn&#x27;s article, an excerpt from his best-selling book, &quot;America Alone&quot;, is a worthy contribution to an important debate on geopolitical and demographic issues, and that plaintiff&#x27;s demands for equal space for a rebuttal was unreasonable and untenable.

Accusations that Maclean&#x27;s supported Islamophobic articles and writers continued after the Oct. 26, 2013 issue featured an interview with singer Celine Dion wherein the singer was reported as making racist and insensitive comments about Muslim women&#x27;s right to wear religious clothing under the proposed Quebec Charter of Values. During a press conference in Montreal on November 9, 2013, Dion&#x27;s husband and manager Rene Angelil refuted claims that the singer made such comments, touching on both his and Celine&#x27;s shared ancestry: &quot;… both Céline and I share family coming from the Middle-East — me from Lebanon and Syria and her fathers family from Lebanon also… to say she&#x27;d make these comments is hurtful to both Céline and her Muslim fans and we have made contact with Maclean&#x27;s through our legal team.&quot;

On January 19, 2014, it was reported by Québécois media that Maclean&#x27;s and Dion&#x27;s team had reached an agreement outside of court with Maclean&#x27;s making a (now redacted) apology to Dion within the original article.

==&quot;Too Asian?&quot; article==

In the November 2010 university ranking issue under the editorship of Kenneth Whyte and Mark Stevenson, reporter Stephanie Findlay and senior writer Nicholas Köhler wrote an article about the perceived over-representation of Asian students at Canadian universities, entitled &quot;Too Asian?&quot; This led to allegations that &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; intentionally perpetuated racial stereotypes to court controversy for the sake of publicity. Amidst criticism from a number of student unions and politicians, on December 16, 2010, Toronto&#x27;s city council voted to request an apology from &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine as the third Canadian city to do so after Victoria and Vancouver. In a letter to the Minister of Canadian Heritage, Senator Vivienne Poy suggested that public outrage over the &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; article, &quot;defined as material that is denigrating to an identifiable group&quot;, should deem it ineligible for government funding.

==&quot;Guide to Canadian Universities&quot;==

The &quot;Maclean&#x27;s Guide to Canadian Universities&quot; is published annually in March. It is also known as &quot;Maclean&#x27;s University Guide&quot;. It includes information from the Maclean&#x27;s University Rankings, an issue of the magazine proper that is published annually in November, primarily for students in their last year of high school and entering their first year in Canadian universities. Both the &quot;Guide&quot; and the rankings issue feature articles discussing Canadian universities and ranking them by order of quality. The rankings focus on taking a measure of the &quot;undergraduate experience&quot;, comparing universities in three peer groupings: Primarily Undergraduate, Comprehensive, and Medical Doctoral. 

Schools in the Primarily Undergraduate category are largely focused on undergraduate education, with relatively few graduate programs. Comprehensives have a significant amount of research activity and a wide range of graduate and undergraduate programs, including professional degrees. Medical Doctoral institutions have a broad range of PhD programs and research, as well as medical schools.

In early 2006, &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; announced that in June 2006, it would be introducing a new annual issue called the University Student Issue. The issue would feature the results of a survey of recent university graduates from each Canadian university. However, many universities, such as the University of Calgary, McMaster University, and the University of Toronto, refused to take part in this exercise. The three institutions stated that they questioned the &quot;magazine&#x27;s ability to conduct a survey that would be rigorous and provide accurate and useful information to students and their parents&quot;. In response, &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; sought the results of two university-commissioned student surveys: the Canadian Undergraduate Survey Consortium (CUSC) and the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE). Results from these surveys, along with &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; own graduate survey, were published in the June 26, 2006, edition of &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;.

For the November 2006 University Rankings issue, 22 Canadian universities refused to provide information directly to &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;. To rank those universities, the magazine relied on data it collected itself, as well as data drawn from third party sources such as Statistics Canada. Among the universities that refused to provide information directly to &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; in the fall of 2006 were: University of British Columbia, University of Toronto, Dalhousie University, McMaster University, University of New Brunswick, University of Manitoba, Université du Québec network, Simon Fraser University, University of Alberta, University of Calgary, University of Lethbridge, Ryerson University, Université de Montréal, University of Ottawa, York University, Concordia University, University of Western Ontario, Lakehead University, Queen&#x27;s University, Carleton University, and University of Windsor. The withholding of data served as a means of voicing the universities&#x27; displeasure with the methodology used to determine the &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; ranking. Indira Samarasekera, president of The University of Alberta, further discussed this in the article, &quot;Rising Up Against Rankings&quot;, published in the April 2, 2007, issue of &quot;Inside Higher Ed.&quot;

The University Rankings Issue contains a compilation of different charts and lists judging the different aspects of universities in different categories. The three main areas listed in chart form in the University Rankings Issue as at November 3, 2006, are: the overall rankings themselves, the university student surveys, and the magazine&#x27;s &quot;national reputational rankings&quot; of the schools.

The National Reputational Rankings, like the main university rankings, are broken into three subcategories: medical doctoral, comprehensive, and primarily undergraduate and are based on opinions of the quality of the universities. The quality opinions gathered were contributed by secondary school principals, guidance counsellors, organization and company heads, and recruiters. The results of the reputational rankings are included in the main university rankings, and account for 16% of a university&#x27;s total ranking score.

===Criticism===
A University of Windsor team, led by professors Stewart Page and Ken Cramer, conducted an annual analysis of the &quot;Maclean&#x27;s Guide to Canadian Universities&quot; since its inception, publishing compiled findings as &quot;The Marketing of Canadian University Rankings: A Misadventure Now 24 Years Old&quot;, in 2016, summarized by its authors as:

Co-author Stewart Page had observed, in 2012, that numerous Canadian schools had withdrawn active cooperation from &quot;Maclean’s&quot; annual surveys.

<doc id="297286" wikidata="Q225649" url="?curid=297286" title="Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone">
<text>Hugh O&#x27;Neill, Earl of Tyrone (; – 20 July 1616) was an Irish lord and key figure of the Nine Years&#x27; War. Known as the &quot;Great Earl&quot;, he led the confederacy of Irish clans against the English Crown in resistance to the Tudor conquest of Ireland under Queen 

He was born into the O&#x27;Neill clan, Tír Eoghain&#x27;s ruling noble family, during a violent succession conflict which saw his father assassinated. At the age of eight he was relocated to the Pale where he was raised by an English family. Although the Crown hoped to mold him into a puppet ruler sympathetic to the English government, by the 1570s he had built a strong network of both British and Irish contacts which he utilised for his pursuit of political power.

Through the early 1590s, Tyrone secretly supported rebellions against the Crown&#x27;s advances into Ulster whilst publicly maintaining a loyal appearance. He regularly deceived government officials via bribes and convoluted disinformation campaigns. Via his web of alliances and the heavy taxation of his subjects, he could arm and feed over 8,000 men, making him well-prepared to resist English incursions. In 1591 he caused a stir when he eloped with Mabel Bagenal, younger sister of the Marshal of the Queen&#x27;s Irish Army. During the Battle of Belleek Tyrone fought alongside his brother-in-law Henry Bagenal whilst covertly commanding the very troops they were fighting against. After years of playing both sides, he finally went into open rebellion in early 1595 with an assault on the Blackwater Fort. Despite victories at the Battle of the Yellow Ford and Battle of Curlew Pass, the confederacy began to suffer upon the arrival of Lord Deputy Mountjoy and commander Henry Docwra in Ulster. Tyrone was not able to secure Spanish reinforcements until late 1601 when the 4th Spanish Armada was sent. The confederacy was decisively defeated at the Siege of Kinsale, and Tyrone surrendered to Mountjoy in 1603 with the signing of the Treaty of Mellifont.

Due to increasing hostility against Tyrone and his allies, in 1607 he made the &quot;snap decision&quot; to flee with his countrymen to continental Europe in what is known as the Flight of the Earls. He settled in Rome where he was granted a small pension by Pope Paul V. Despite his plans to return to and retake Ireland, he died during his exile.

In comparison to his &quot;warlike and arrogant&quot; ally Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell, Tyrone was cautious and deliberate. A consummate liar, he is considered an enigma to historians due to the elaborate bluffs he employed to mislead his opponents. Although wartime propaganda promoted Tyrone as a &quot;Catholic crusader&quot;, historians believe his motivations were primarily political rather than religious - though he apparently underwent a genuine conversion around 1598. He also held the title 3rd Baron Dungannon, and in 1595 he became Chief of the Name of the O&#x27;Neill clan. He had four wives, many concubines and various children.

== Family background and early life, 1550–1561 ==

=== Birth and family ===
Hugh O&#x27;Neill was born in the barony of Oneilland, Tír Eoghain (present-day northern County Armagh)—possibly in a crannog such as Marlacoo. The O&#x27;Neill dynasty were Tír Eoghain&#x27;s ruling Gaelic Irish noble family, and claimed descent from Niall Ruadh of the Cenél nEógain, who was a descendant of legendary high king Niall of the Nine Hostages. Hugh was the second son of Feardorcha &quot;Matthew&quot; O&#x27;Neill, 1st Baron Dungannon (–1558) and his wife Siobhán Maguire (died 1600). Hugh&#x27;s paternal grandparents were clan chief Conn Bacagh O&#x27;Neill, 1st Earl of Tyrone (–1559) and Alison Kelly of Dundalk, a blacksmith&#x27;s wife. Siobhán was a daughter of Cúconnacht Maguire, Lord of Fermanagh (–1537). Hugh had three brothers: Brian, Cormac MacBaron and Art MacBaron. During their youth, Hugh and Brian were fostered by the O&#x27;Hagan and O&#x27;Quinn families.







=== O&#x27;Neill succession conflict ===
During Hugh&#x27;s childhood, a rivalry formed between his uncle Shane and his father Matthew. Matthew was born from an affair between Conn Bacagh and Alison, but was accepted by Conn Bacagh as his son and tanist. This affronted Shane, a younger legitimate son of Conn Bacagh, who employed the ambivalent status of Matthew&#x27;s paternity to affirm his own claim to the chieftaincy. Shane asserted that Matthew&#x27;s father was actually Alison&#x27;s husband John Kelly, which would render Matthew illegitimate in both Irish and English systems of succession. In the ensuing conflict, the O&#x27;Neill family split into rival septs—the &quot;MacShanes&quot; (Shane&#x27;s immediate family) and the &quot;MacBarons&quot; (Matthew&#x27;s immediate family). The English encouraged this conflict as it weakened the powerful O&#x27;Neill clan.

Matthew was killed in 1558 by the O&#x27;Donnelly clan, Shane&#x27;s foster family, placing his sons Brian and Hugh in a dangerous situation. The continuing support for their claims came from the Dublin Castle administration, which was anxious to use the support of the MacBarons to break the independent power of the O&#x27;Neill lords of Ulster. At some point between May and August 1558, English statesman Sir Henry Sidney organised the retrieval of the two boys, and for a brief time they stayed at his Dublin residence.

=== Raised in the Pale ===
Hugh O&#x27;Neill and his elder brother Brian became wards of the Crown. They were moved into the care of the Anglo-Irish Hovenden family and were raised at their household in Balgriffin, County Dublin—a property formerly belonging to Conn Bacagh. The Crown sought to keep the children safe from harm and to raise them in the English manner, so that they would be more sympathetic to the English administration once they came of age and took their places in the Gaelic nobility.

Giles Hovenden, Hugh&#x27;s foster father, was an English settler with a pre-existing business connection with Conn Bacagh. Hugh was raised by Giles&#x27;s wife Joan Walshe, and she continued to care for Hugh after Giles&#x27;s death. Hugh would remain close with his adoptive family throughout the rest of his life. His foster brother Henry became his chief advisor and accompanied him on his flight in 1607. Brothers Henry and Richard led Hugh&#x27;s troops in the late 1580s, though another brother Walter died opposing the Irish confederacy in battle.

Growing up in the Pale amongst English people, Hugh gained a knowledge of English customs and politics, mainly through his attendance at the Irish Parliament and the court in England. He was able to secure allies such as the Earls of Ormonde and Leicester. He would have received a basic education, either by attending grammar school or from private lessons.

== Early career, 1562–1579 ==

=== Baron Dungannon ===
In 1562, Brian was assassinated by Shane&#x27;s tanist Turlough Luineach O&#x27;Neill, and Hugh succeeded him as Baron Dungannon. Four years later, war broke out between Shane and the Crown. It was previously considered unlikely that a MacBaron could sway Shane&#x27;s dominance in Ulster, but in light of these events, the English government began to view Hugh as a significant contender who could bring Ulster under loyalist control. On the contrary, Hugh&#x27;s main concern was the ruthless pursuit of political and military power, and he intended to remain autonomous and independent.

=== Return to Ulster ===

In June 1567, Shane was killed by Scots supporting the MacDonnells of Antrim. Hugh&#x27;s wardship formally ended the following November when he sued out his livery, returning to Ulster in 1568 under the protection of Lord Deputy Sidney. Sidney granted Hugh territory in Oneilland, intending to keep Turlough from crossing south past the River Blackwater, thus creating further discord within the O&#x27;Neill family.

Now returned to his province of birth, Hugh began engaging the support of neighbouring Irish Gaelic families, including the O&#x27;Hagans, the O&#x27;Quinns and his own family the MacBarons. According to Sidney, these families &quot;much repined that the great and regal estate of the O&#x27;Neill... should be so broken and dismembered&quot;. As he had spent the previous ten years raised as an Englishman, Hugh would have been considered an outsider by these families. Hugh married the daughter of favoured noble Brian McPhelim O&#x27;Neill, but in 1574 he hastily annulled the marriage when his father-in-law was implicated in a bloody conflict and tried for treason. The same year, Hugh established his most important and longlasting alliance by remarrying to Siobhán O&#x27;Donnell, daughter of chief Hugh McManus O&#x27;Donnell. The O&#x27;Donnell and O&#x27;Neill clans had traditionally been mortal enemies for centuries. Hugh O&#x27;Neill gained good standing with the 1st Earl of Essex after joining him in an abortive attack on Turlough. Essex praised Hugh as &quot;the only man in Ulster to be trusted&quot;. By the early 1570s, Hugh was using his combined support from the Pale and Ulster to put Turlough under heavy pressure.

== Rise to power, 1580–1593 ==
In 1585 he attended the Irish House of Lords in Dublin, where he was recognised as the Earl of Tyrone. In 1587, he successfully persuaded Elizabeth I to grant him letters patent to the lands of Tír Eoghain. This was apparently done to suppress his desire for O&#x27;Neill chieftainship. From 1587, the Crown grew suspicious of Tyrone and began attempts at curbing his growing power. Elizabeth I characterised Tyrone as &quot;a creature of our own&quot;—a noble raised as an Englishman who had nonetheless turned his back on the English court in favour of political independence. During this period, Tyrone regularly bribed government officials and relied on his extensive web of connections.

=== Working with the Crown ===
Per an arrangement with the Crown, Tyrone agreed to defend the Pale&#x27;s borders from fellow Ulstermen in exchange for soldiers. This arrangement allowed him to extend his influence over southeastern Ulster. In 1580, during the Second Desmond Rebellion in Munster, Tyrone fought with the English forces against Gerald FitzGerald, 14th Earl of Desmond. In 1584 he assisted Sir John Perrot against Sorley Boy, the first chief of the MacDonnells of Antrim. Lord Deputy Arthur Grey praised him as &quot;the only Irish nobleman that hath done any service and drawn blood since my coming&quot;. Tyrone was nicknamed &quot;The Queen&#x27;s O&#x27;Neill&quot; for his loyalty to the Crown. Nevertheless, he feared that the Dublin government might weaken his power by appointing a sheriff in Tír Eoghain.

=== Spanish Armada ===
In late 1588, 23 ships of the Spanish Armada were lost on Ireland&#x27;s coast. Lord Deputy William FitzWilliam ordered the execution of Spanish survivors. Tyrone&#x27;s response to the Armada is unclear - his mercenary forces massacred survivors in Inishowen, though Tyrone himself rescued various crew members in County Sligo. Tyrone may have been playing a &quot;double game&quot;, as is common throughout his career.

The Armada ship &quot;La Trinidad Valencera&quot; sank in Kinnagoe Bay, Inishowen. Tyrone&#x27;s mercenary forces, commanded by his Hovenden foster-brothers, proceeded to Inishowen upon hearing of the presence of Spanish fugitives there. Tyrone&#x27;s instructions to the Hovendens are unknown; ultimately his forces committed the largest single massacre of Armada survivors in Inishowen. FitzWilliam was suspicious of the Earl&#x27;s activities and refused to believe this news, but it is confirmed in the report of a Spanish escapee, improving FitzWilliam&#x27;s opinion of Tyrone.

Historians John Marshall, Hiram Morgan and Matthew McGinty characterised Tyrone as reluctantly ordering the massacre to keep in the English government&#x27;s good graces. Contemporary sources seem to imply that the massacre was carried out on the actions of the O&#x27;Donnell clan, who counselled O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s troops, though this is possibly misdirection by Tyrone. Government officials reported that Tyrone heavily reprimanded Hugh McManus O&#x27;Donnell for betraying the Spaniards and their refuge, and he contemptuously told O&#x27;Donnell to seek dwelling in another country.
On 25 September, the ships &quot;La Lavia&quot;, &quot;La Juliana&quot; and the &quot;Santa Maria de Vison&quot; became shipwrecked at Streedagh Strand in County Sligo. Tyrone himself assisted three sick officers and many commoners. One of the latter included ordinary seaman Pedro Blanco of &quot;La Juliana&quot;, who was kept on as Tyrone&#x27;s footman and manservant throughout the whole of the Nine Years&#x27; War. Tyrone also helped stranded nobleman Don Antonio Manrique escape Ulster. Ultimately about a dozen Spaniards remained in Ireland. Despite their desire to return home, Philip II of Spain believed they would be of better use as interpreters and emissaries for Tyrone.

It seems Tyrone never recruited any of these Spaniards as soldiers. His decision may have been affected by the hostility the English had towards Lord Brian O&#x27;Rourke for recruiting many Spanish survivors into his military.

=== O&#x27;Donnell clan alliance ===
Tyrone further developed his alliance with the O&#x27;Donnell clan—by 1587 his daughter Rose was betrothed to tanist Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell. Via this alliance, Tyrone was able to secure Scottish mercenaries to fight the MacShanes. In turn, he supported O&#x27;Donnell in a succession dispute within his own kingdom.Lord Deputy Perrot ordered young O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s kidnapping in 1587 in hopes of destroying the O&#x27;Neill-O&#x27;Donnell alliance. O&#x27;Donnell was imprisoned in Dublin Castle, along with two MacShanes, Art and Henry. Tyrone was outraged, describing the ordeal as &quot;the most prejudice that might happen unto me&quot;, and lobbied fruitlessly for his son-in-law&#x27;s release.

Tyrone needed to secure Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s release so he could use the O&#x27;Donnell clan&#x27;s military power to overthrow Turlough Luineach. In January 1591, O&#x27;Donnell made a failed prison break attempt. The same month, Tyrone&#x27;s wife Siobhán (Hugh Roe&#x27;s elder half-sister) died. Around Christmas 1591 Tyrone successfully aided Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s (and ironically, the MacShanes&#x27;) escape. He had bribed officials—most likely Lord Deputy FitzWilliam—to aid in O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s escape. Henry split from the others in Dublin; O&#x27;Donnell and Art fled to the Wicklow Mountains to seek shelter with Tyrone&#x27;s ally Fiach McHugh O&#x27;Byrne. O&#x27;Byrne&#x27;s search party found the two men buried in snow and close to death. O&#x27;Donnell recovered from frostbite and was inaugurated as O&#x27;Donnell clan chief in 1592. Art died in the mountains, fueling speculation that Tyrone had O&#x27;Byrne&#x27;s party kill Art when they found him. It is more likely however that Art died of exposure.

=== Bagenal Family ===

In the north, Tyrone also had to contend with his &quot;grievous enemy&quot; Sir Nicholas Bagenal, the Marshal of Her Majesty&#x27;s Irish Army. Around 1589 Nicholas Bagenal described Tyrone as &quot;as so allied by kindred in blood and affinity as also by marriages and fosters and other friendships as if he should be ill-disposed might hap put the crown of England to more charges than the purchase of Ulster should be worth&quot;. On 24 October 1590, his son Henry Bagenal succeeded him as Marshal.In autumn 1590, Lord Hugh Roe MacMahon was executed on FitzWilliam&#x27;s orders; MacMahon&#x27;s land was confiscated, divided and allotted to English servitors rather than the Gaelic Irish. Tyrone, who had owned part of MacMahon&#x27;s lands under brehon law, was passed over in favour of Henry Bagenal. Furthermore, Tyrone&#x27;s authority was directly challenged when Henry Bagenal was named chief commissioner of Ulster on 18 May 1591.

Soon afterwards, Tyrone began to woo Mabel, the Marshal&#x27;s younger sister. This was only months after the similarly-timed deaths of Henry Bagenal&#x27;s father and Tyrone&#x27;s late wife. Tyrone professed his love and asked for Mabel&#x27;s hand in marriage. Alarmed, Bagenal kept Mabel out of Tyrone&#x27;s reach by sending her to live with his brother-in-law Patrick Barnewall in Turvey. Nevertheless, Tyrone found excuses to visit Mabel, and in July he convinced her to elope.

After a dinner at Turvey, the Earl distracted Barnewall while his ally William Warren escorted Mabel to Warren&#x27;s house in Drumcondra. Tyrone wanted a Protestant ceremony so that the marriage would be recognised by English law, and so Protestant Bishop of Meath Thomas Jones was summoned. Jones was reluctant to perform the marriage, but after being assured of Mabel&#x27;s free consent, and for the sake of her reputation, the couple were married on 3 August 1591.

Jerrold Casway notes that this &quot;whirlwind courtship&quot; is unlike Tyrone&#x27;s other marriages, which otherwise always had political motives. It is possible Tyrone&#x27;s judgment was impaired by his feelings. Mabel was young and attractive, and clearly enamoured by the attention she received from Tyrone. She has been simplistically dubbed the &quot;Helen of the Elizabethan Wars&quot;. Historians believe that Tyrone would have recognised the advantages of marrying into the powerful Bagenal family.

Henry Bagenal was outraged at the marriage. He refused to pay his sister&#x27;s dowry, even two years after the marriage, and also had Tyrone&#x27;s previous divorce investigated, though it was found to be valid. Because of this dramatic episode and their roles as opposing commanders during the Nine Years&#x27; War, Bagenal and Tyrone have been called &quot;arch-enemies&quot;, &quot;nemeses&quot; and &quot;arch-rivals&quot;.

=== Becoming Chief of the Name ===
The aging chief Turlough had yet to choose a tanist, and the position was contested by Tyrone and his MacShane cousins. Tír Eoghain&#x27;s population favoured the MacShanes, but outside the kingdom they were disliked due to their father&#x27;s cruelty towards the various smaller neighbouring kingdoms. Furthermore, the MacShanes had lost a valuable ally in their kin, the FitzGeralds of Desmond, following their defeat in the Desmond Rebellions.

It is clear that Tyrone aspired to the position of O&#x27;Neill clan chief. In March 1583, news spread that Turlough had died. Tyrone rushed to Tullyhogue Fort, the ancient ceremonial site where the O&#x27;Neill chiefs were traditionally inaugurated. It turned out that Turlough had not died but had only fallen into a brief coma from alcohol poisoning.

Tyrone&#x27;s constant disputes with Turlough were fomented by the English with a view to weakening the clan. In 1584, Tyrone and Turlough were at Strabane to celebrate Easter together. The Dublin government was extremely alarmed at this news and feared that the O&#x27;Neill rivalry may be dissolving. By 1587, Turlough had established an alliance with the MacShanes. In 1588 Tyrone and Hugh McManus O&#x27;Donnell launched an attack on Turlough, but they were defeated at Carricklea to the satisfaction of Perrot.

In January 1590, Tyrone organised the execution of his MacShane cousin Hugh Gavelagh, who had exposed to FitzWilliam that the Earl was making treasonous dealings with the Spanish. Tyrone reputedly hanged Gavelagh over a tree with his bare hands—though other sources claim the executioner was from Meath or Cavan, given Tír Eoghain&#x27;s population were sympathetic to the MacShanes. Tyrone proceeded to London where he sufficiently defended himself against England&#x27;s Privy Council by alleging that Gavelagh was guilty of various crimes. Tyrone was placed under house arrest but released by letters of commendation from FitzWilliam and the Dublin government.

After Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s inauguration as O&#x27;Donnell clan chief, Tyrone and O&#x27;Donnell executed a pincer movement against Turlough. With an overwhelming alliance against him, in May 1593 Turlough was forced to surrender his lordship of Tír Eoghain and name Tyrone as his tanist. Turlough would receive a pension of £2,000 and the right to officially remain O&#x27;Neill chief until his death. The Earl had effectively become the ruler of Tír Eoghain.

== Proxy war, 1593–1594 ==

=== Maguire&#x27;s revolt ===
In early April 1593, English captain Humphrey Willis was appointed by FitzWilliam as Sheriff of Fermanagh; he entered Fermanagh with at least 100 men and began pillaging and raiding, to the fury of Fermanagh&#x27;s chieftain Hugh Maguire. Morgan states that this was a blatant move to weaken Tyrone&#x27;s power by subjugating Maguire.

After Willis&#x27; first offensive, a meeting took place at Enniskillen Castle on 8 May, with O&#x27;Donnell, Maguire and Brian Oge O&#x27;Rourke present. The Sheriff of Monaghan alleged that Tyrone also attended the meeting. The noblemen were assembled by Edmund MacGauran, a Catholic Archbishop recently returned from Spain with promises that Philip II would support oppressed Irish Catholics if they proved themselves by launching prior military action. MacGauran advised that the noblemen sign a letter addressed to Philip II which emphasised their oppression and which requested urgent reinforcements from the Spanish army. Tyrone did not sign MacGauran&#x27;s letter. Catholic Archbishop James O&#x27;Hely was tasked with delivering the confederates&#x27; messages—he met with Juan de Idiáquez, the royal secretary. Idiáquez&#x27;s notes to Philip II reveal Tyrone&#x27;s relationship with the emerging confederacy:Maguire managed to obtain reinforcements which included 100 men led by Tyrone&#x27;s brother Cormac MacBaron and 120 men under the commands of Tyrone&#x27;s O&#x27;Hagan foster-brothers. Tyrone often used his relatives and followers to make war on his behalf and it is unlikely they would have assisted Maguire without Tyrone&#x27;s permission. Maguire besieged Willis and his men in a church and planned to starve them out, but Tyrone intervened and negotiated their rescue safely out of Fermanagh. This conflict is considered to mark the start of the Nine Years&#x27; War.

Subsequently Maguire launched raids across Connacht. Tyrone&#x27;s nephews—sons of his brother Art MacBaron—also engaged in campaigns against loyalist clans.

=== Motivations ===
It is certain Tyrone was involved in the events in Fermanagh and Connacht during 1593-4, but historians disagree as to his true motivations during this period. Hiram Morgan represents Tyrone as a master strategist who was complicit in rebellion from the start but feigned loyalty to the Crown for strategic reasons. James O&#x27;Neill agrees that Tyrone was the chief architect of the rebellion, and states that the conflict in Fermanagh allowed Tyrone to diverted English forces and thus suppress English clients in east Ulster. According to John Dorney, Tyrone originally distanced himself from the rebellions because he hoped to be appointed Lord President of Ulster by Elizabeth I, but she recognised Tyrone&#x27;s ambitions to usurp her as Ireland&#x27;s sovereign and refused to grant him provincial presidency or similar powers. Nicholas Canny similarly states that Tyrone aspired to be the &quot;queen&#x27;s man in Ulster&quot;, was passed over in favour of Henry Bagenal, and reluctantly pushed into rebellion to prevent his followers defecting to his brother Cormac MacBaron. Michael Finnegan suggests that Tyrone wanted to prevent war with the English, trying in vain to restrain his Irish allies, but was dragged into the war because his association with O&#x27;Donnell had corrupted his loyalist reputation. Darren McGettigan downplays Tyrone&#x27;s role, stating that &quot;while [Tyrone] was crucial to the confederacy, he did not build it, and may have been carried along by events and his own success, much more than some historians realise&quot;. McGettigan and Morgan disagree over Tyrone&#x27;s prominence in the confederacy.

By the beginning of the Nine Years&#x27; War, Tyrone had formally allied with O&#x27;Donnell and Maguire via their marriages to his daughters. O&#x27;Donnell married Tyrone&#x27;s daughter Rose in December 1592, and Maguire married Tyrone&#x27;s daughter Margaret around May 1593. Around August 1593, Maguire stated to a spy that Tyrone had pushed him into rebellion and &quot;promised to assist him &amp; bear him owt in his warre&quot;. The English government had their suspicions that Tyrone was plotting against them, but he repeatedly proved his loyalty in battles against Irish uprisings. The early confederates operated under the understanding that Tyrone belonged to their cause but publicly hid his true allegiance.

=== Allegations against Tyrone ===
On 14 May 1593, Phelim MacTurlough O&#x27;Neill, a client of Henry Bagenal, was assassinated by the O&#x27;Hagans, Tyrone&#x27;s foster family. This murder permitted Tyrone to annex Killetra, which he had been attempting since the late 1580s. Tyrone was charged with involvement in the assassination. He swore his innocence, blamed it solely on the O&#x27;Hagans as a revenge murder, and accused the administration of manipulating the evidence against him. FitzWilliam had his doubts, but the council were satisfied.

By late April, there were more allegations against Tyrone from Irish lords Hugh McHugh Dubh O&#x27;Donnell and Sir Hugh Magennis. FitzWilliam summoned Tyrone to Dublin, but Tyrone refused and made excuses, so the council went to Dundalk to confront him in person. During the proceedings, which occurred 14–28 June, the main charge was foreign conspiracy. FitzWilliam and Bagenal favoured the Earl&#x27;s arrest. Three councillors were already well-disposed to Tyrone; the rest felt threatened by his power in Dundalk. Certain councillors feared Tyrone&#x27;s arrest would only exacerbate the growing conflict in the north and could lead to a Gaelic invasion of the Pale. Ultimately Tyrone managed to avoid arrest. When Elizabeth I was later briefed on the proceedings, she concluded that Tyrone should have been arrested.

Tyrone met with Maguire in early August—within weeks Maguire launched raids into Monaghan.

=== Battle of Belleek ===
Maguire&#x27;s attacks provoked a large-scale military expedition to be led by Bagenal. Tyrone was able to deflect the past allegations and prove his loyalty to the Crown by agreeing to assist Bagenal. On 26 September he joined Bagenal and his army at Enniskillen, but the Earl had brought far fewer troops than he had promised. The two commanders detested each other and there was a nervous awkwardness between their troops. Bagenal proposed several plans of attack but these were all vetoed by Tyrone. On 7 October, they marched separately to the ford near Belleek.

Their combined forces moved on Maguire&#x27;s positions on 10 October in what is known as the Battle of Belleek. Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell was in nearby Ballyshannon when the battle was taking place, but he was ordered by Tyrone not to reinforce Maguire. It was estimated that 300 of Maguire&#x27;s men were killed. Though Maguire&#x27;s forces were not directly engaged, FitzWilliam was convinced Maguire&#x27;s revolt had been stopped. During the battle Tyrone was speared in the leg; the wound served as physical proof of his loyalty to the authorities in Dublin. Bagenal remain suspicious of his brother-in-law and later received intelligence that Tyrone had advised Maguire prior to the battle. Tyrone protested against Bagenal&#x27;s accusation by claiming that Bagenal and FitzWilliam were conspiring to rob him of the honour he was due.

=== Further allegations ===
More allegations emerged in 1594. Captain Willis, Sir Edward Herbert and Joan Kelly claimed Tyrone was ordering the Irish raids. He would apparently meet with confederate soldiers at Slieve Beagh under the pretense that he was going hunting. In March, it appeared that Tyrone was behind the burning of Bagenal&#x27;s lands. The same month, government commissioners surmised that a confederacy had been established between the Ulster lords, and that Tyrone was the leader. Tyrone was involved in the Battle of the Ford of the Biscuits, which occurred on 7 August. O&#x27;Donnell pushed Tyrone into supplying further soldiers, by warning that &quot;he must consider [Tyrone] his enemy, unless he came to his aid in such a pinch&quot;.

FitzWilliam was succeeded as Lord Deputy by William Russell, who was sworn in on 11 August. To the surprise of the council, Tyrone appeared in Dublin four days later to tender his submission. Russell allowed Tyrone to leave in safety, but he later realised his mistake and unsuccessfully shifted blame to the council. The queen was furious, denouncing it &quot;as foul an oversight as ever committed in that kingdom&quot;.

== Open rebellion, 1595–1597 ==
===Assault on the Blackwater Fort===

On 16 February 1595, Tyrone&#x27;s brother Art MacBaron assaulted and captured the English-held Blackwater Fort in Blackwatertown. More significant however was the presence of Tyrone at the assault. The evidence against Tyrone became too great to ignore, and the government deemed an immediate attack essential. Sir John Norris was ordered to Ireland at the head of a considerable force for the purpose of subduing Tyrone. Tyrone anticipated this and struck the first blow by invading and burning Louth. When Norris arrived at Waterford on 4 May 1595, Tyrone had already succeeded in taking the Blackwater Fort.

If Tyrone did not go into open rebellion once the English encroached onto Tír Eoghain, he could have risked estranging his followers and allowing another O&#x27;Neill clansman to oust him, such as his brother Cormac MacBaron.

=== Battle of Clontibret ===
In May 1595, 1,750 English troops led by Bagenal were ambushed near Clontibret by an army led by Tyrone. The English column had been sent to relieve the besieged English garrison in Monaghan. The battle spanned multiple days as Bagenal&#x27;s forces attempted to outrun Tyrone&#x27;s. During the battle, Tyrone entered a melee with a cornet who had thrown him off his horse. An O&#x27;Cahan (possibly Donnell Ballagh O&#x27;Cahan) severed the cornet&#x27;s arm then Tyrone stabbed him under the corslet.

In a report to the Lord Deputy, Norris warned that the proficiency of the Irish rebels was far greater than expected: &quot;their number greater, their arms better, and munition more plenty&quot;. The discipline and co-ordination of Tyrone&#x27;s pike and shot technique caused extreme concern. Bagenal recorded 31 killed and 103 wounded, though it is likely casualties were much higher. The Irish victory shocked and demoralised the English and was a severe setback early in the war.

=== Proclaimed a traitor ===
On 24 June Tyrone was proclaimed a traitor at Dundalk. The queen&#x27;s advisor William Cecil advised a compromise, writing that Elizabeth &quot;would be content to see what was in the traitor&#x27;s heart, and what he would offer&quot;. Tyrone insisted on a general pardon but this was refused.

Turlough Luineach died in September, making Tyrone officially O&#x27;Neill clan chief under brehon law. According to Norris, &quot;the coming to the place of [clan chief] hath made [Tyrone] much prouder and harder to yield to his duty, and he flattereth himself much with the hope of foreign assistance.&quot; Tyrone was the last inaugurated chief of the O&#x27;Neill clan. He appointed Cormac MacBaron as his tanist.

=== Peace treaty and relations with Spain ===

Tyrone and O&#x27;Donnell opened communications with Philip II and his general Juan del Águila. In letters to the king—intercepted by Russell—they promoted themselves as champions of the Roman Catholic Church, claiming liberty of conscience as well as political liberty for the Gaelic Irish. They also offered Philip II the kingdom of Ireland in return for military support. It had long been suspected that Tyrone was in league with the Spanish but this was the English government&#x27;s first piece of hard evidence. In fact Philip II had sent a ship to gather intelligence in March 1594, but the crew died in a shipwreck off Biscay.

Tyrone sought to delay the war in order to buy time for the arrival of Spanish troops. In September 1595, he sent overtures of submission to the Crown, and a ceasefire was enacted whilst the settlement could be negotiated. This timing was advantageous to the Crown, as the queen&#x27;s Irish Army was facing shortages of manpower and supplies. The discovery of the confederacy&#x27;s letters to Spain affected negotiations, but ultimately the government was willing to accept Tyrone&#x27;s assurances. After much deliberation and negotiation, a cessation of arms was signed by Tyrone on 27 October. This pardoned certain confederates and give them local autonomy. It also acknowledged a tolerance of Catholicism. The confederacy proved to be unsatisfied with the terms, but this policy was a success in that Tyrone managed to defer English attempts on his territory for more than two years.

Tyrone&#x27;s wife Mabel died in December 1595. The same month, Tyrone&#x27;s partnership with O&#x27;Donnell came under strain as Tyrone&#x27;s daughter Rose had not born O&#x27;Donnell children. With Tyrone&#x27;s consent, O&#x27;Donnell separated from Rose in hopes of a marriage alliance with the daughter of the neutral 3rd Earl of Clanricarde. O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s plan came to naught. Tyrone sent his secretary Henry Hovenden into Tyrconnell to handle the situation, and O&#x27;Donnell eventually took Rose back.

According to Dunlop, &quot;for the next two years it is impossible to describe the relations between Tyrone and the government as those either of settled peace or open war&quot;. In April 1596, Philip II anxiously exhorted Tyrone to continue the war with England. Tyrone thereafter chose to temporize with the authorities, professing his loyalty to the crown whenever circumstances required. A hollow peace was signed on 24 April. Further negotiations to develop a peace treaty were almost complete by May. Spanish captain Alonso Cobos met with Tyrone, O&#x27;Donnell and Cormac MacBaron in early May. After the meeting, the Irishmen agreed to abandon the peace treaty and become vassals of Philip II. Tyrone and O&#x27;Donnell also petitioned Philip II to make Albert VII, Archduke of Austria, the new monarch of Ireland. After these developments, Tyrone and O&#x27;Donnell began to deliberately derail peace negotiations and provoke war in previously peaceful parts of the country. It became clear to the English that Tyrone intended the war to be not just a war for Ulster, but for all of Ireland.

Tyrone declared to Norris that he and O&#x27;Donnell had rejected further meetings with the Spanish. To put the matter at rest, he submitted Philip II&#x27;s letter to Russell as a show of transparency. However, Philip II soon learned of Tyrone&#x27;s maneuver and was indignant at this breach of trust. In defense, Tyrone shifted blame onto his secretary. Tyrone&#x27;s strategy became more combative once he had received promises that a large-scale Spanish military expedition would be incoming. He imported regular shipments of munitions and his ally Fiach McHugh O&#x27;Byrne engaged in a series of skirmishes against Lord Deputy Russell&#x27;s troops. Tyrone intentionally gave the English government the impression that peace was imminent as misdirection from the impending Spanish expedition. After much delay, the 2nd Spanish Armada finally sailed from Lisbon in October 1596. Unfortunately for Tyrone, the armada ended in failure when it was met with a sudden storm which claimed over 3,000 lives.

In a parley with Norris at Dundalk in January 1597, Tyrone admitted to writing letters to Spain but placed the blame partly on O&#x27;Donnell. He agreed to a further parley in March but made excuses to postpone it. On 22 May, Thomas Burgh, 3rd Baron Burgh, took over as Lord Deputy. Burgh refused to entertain Tyrone&#x27;s excuses and on 6 June, English forces launched a surprise attack on Tyrone between Newry and Armagh. Tyrone withdrew across the Blackwater. On 14 July Burgh captured the Blackwater fort. Tyrone &quot;hanged twenty of his knaves that were appointed for the defence of the sconce&quot;, and returned to besiege the fort. Burgh died from illness in October.

It was anticipated that Tyrone would seize this opportunity to overrun the Pale. Instead, on 22 December, he submitted himself to the Earl of Ormonde at Dundalk, and &quot;upon the knees of his heart professed most hearty penitence for his disloyalty, and especially his foul relapses thereinto&quot;. He promised to renounce the title of O&#x27;Neill clan chief, to refrain from putting obstacles in the way of victualling the Blackwater fort, and not to correspond with Spain or any other foreign nation. Tyrone presented a document of grievances which listed offences committed by the government against the Irish. Ormonde transmitted this petition, in which liberty of conscience was foremost, to Elizabeth I. On these terms a truce for eight weeks, subsequently renewed to 7 June 1598, was concluded.

In early 1598, administrator Conyers Clifford induced various confederates (most notably founding member Brian Oge O&#x27;Rourke) to leave the confederacy and fight for the Crown. Many of the turncoats rejoined the confederacy in fear after O&#x27;Donnell executed their men. O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s betrayal &quot;did amaze Tyrone&quot;—he became paranoid and temporarily arrested various confederate clan chiefs, including Hugh Maguire.

== Large-scale rebellion, 1598–1603 ==

=== Battle of the Yellow Ford ===
Tyrone&#x27;s pardon was granted on 11 April 1598. However the Earl felt that the Crown would eventually supersede his authority in Ulster. When the truce expired in June, Tyrone resumed hostilities. He besieged the Blackwater fort and threatened to starve out the inhabitants.

Motivated by his animosity towards Tyrone, Bagenal encouraged a relief exercise to be sent to the fort. On 14 August, whilst crossing the River Callan, Bagenal&#x27;s army was attacked by the combined forces of Tyrone, O&#x27;Donnell and Maguire. Tyrone had prepared ditches in the ground to obstruct the enemy. Half of Bagenal&#x27;s 4,000 men were killed, including Bagenal himself, who was struck by a bullet after lifting his visor.

The confederacy&#x27;s success at the battle was the greatest victory by Irish forces against England, and it sparked a general revolt throughout the country, particularly the south. Tyrone has been criticised for failing to immediately capitalise on his victory, as he let three months elapse before launching a major attack into Munster. However, it is possible Tyrone sustained heavy losses from the battle. One estimate puts Irish losses at the battle of the Yellow Ford at around 200 killed. News of the battle spread across western Europe, prompting Philip II to send a congratulatory letter to the confederates. Unfortunately for Tyrone, Philip II died the following month; he was succeeded by his son Philip III.

=== Essex in Ireland ===
After much hesitation, Elizabeth I selected Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, as her new Lord Deputy. Essex, a recently-disgraced favourite of the queen, reluctantly took on the role to strengthen his reputation. Essex had an existing connection with Ireland and Tyrone, as his father Walter Devereux was one of Tyrone&#x27;s early allies. In a letter prior to his arrival in Ireland, he declared his intentions as Lord Deputy: &quot;by God, I will beat Tyrone in the field, for nothing worthy of her Majesty&#x27;s honour hath yet been achieved&quot;.

Essex landed in Ireland on 15 April 1599 with an expeditionary force of 16,000 troops and 1,500 horses—the largest English army dispatched to the country. The situation in Ireland was practically unaltered since the battle of the Yellow Ford. Despite his resources, Essex&#x27;s Irish campaign proved to be a failure. He led months of ill-managed operations in the south of Ireland, lost three-quarters of his forces to disease and desertion, and executed of hundreds of his troops for cowardice. The confederates felt the English threat had weakened enough that they could safely travel with their wives—Tyrone&#x27;s fourth wife Catherine Magennis, whom he had married circa 1597, was present at his camp in June 1599 during her first pregnancy. Towards the end of July, Essex received letters from the queen with peremptory orders to travel northwards and attack Tyrone with all speed.
Tyrone skirmished with Essex&#x27;s forces as they approached the borders of Ulster, but this was nothing like a general engagement. Essex&#x27;s numbers had dwindled to only 4,500 and Tyrone, whose army far outnumbered Essex&#x27;s, refused to give battle. Tyrone sent his counsellor Henry O&#x27;Hagan to request a parley. Essex stubbornly agreed only after Tyrone had asked three times.

On 7 September 1599, at a ford on the River Lagan, Tyrone met Essex for a half-hour parley. Tyrone waded his horse into the river whilst Essex stayed on the bank. Tyrone doffed his cap, saluting Essex &quot;with a great deal of reverence&quot;. He praised Essex&#x27;s late father and claimed he was willing to obtain peace from the new Lord Deputy. Tyrone would not give anything in writing, claiming that he feared Spain would cease their alliance with Ireland if evidence appeared that he was negotiating with England. Tyrone once again demanded liberty of conscience, to Essex&#x27;s contempt. He also demanded a single treaty wherein the Crown would restore confiscated Irish lands to their former owners. Essex was not familiar with Tyrone&#x27;s wily nature and gullibly accepted these proposals. Because their parley was conducted privately, out of earshot of their armies, Essex was later accused of using the parley to conspire with Tyrone. These accusations are far-fetched and obviously defamatory.

A more formal meeting occurred later on at the same ford, with six witnesses on each side attending. Ultimately an informal truce of six weeks was arranged. Tyrone retired to Tír Eoghain, and a humiliated Essex returned to England to face his queen. Elizabeth I was displeased by the favourable conditions allowed to Tyrone and by Essex&#x27;s treatment of him as an equal. Tyrone broke off the truce on hearing of Essex&#x27;s arrest, though English statesmen Robert Cecil was weary of the war and remained intent on peace. Following a failed uprising, Essex was executed for treason on 25 February 1601.

=== Faith and Fatherland campaign ===
On 5 November 1599, in a strong position after Essex&#x27;s failed campaign, Tyrone issued a public proclamation declaring a holy war against England. He sent a list of 22 proposed terms for a peace agreement to Queen Elizabeth, including a request on the status of future English viceroys. This amounted to accepting English sovereignty over Ireland as a reality while hoping for tolerance and a strong Irish-led administration. The Dublin government were frightened upon receiving the proclamation. It was decided that any further meetings would be unseemly and futile, and the proposal was ignored.

Tyrone&#x27;s main goal was now to win over Ireland&#x27;s English-speaking Catholic population (the &quot;Old English&quot;). Despite his previous apathy towards religion, Tyrone began to position himself as a champion for Catholicism in order to rally further Irishmen to his cause. Tyrone declared that &quot;if [he] had to be king of Ireland without having the catholic religion, [he] would not the same accept&quot;. He gained support from Pope Clement VIII, who entitled him &quot;Captain General of the Catholic Army in Ireland&quot;. In late 1599 and early 1600, the Earl was in Munster on pilgrimage. He supported the claim of James FitzThomas Fitzgerald (the Súgán Earl) to the Earldom of Desmond, and recognised Florence MacCarthy as the MacCarthy Mor at Inniscarra. However the Munster expedition ended in failure when in early March, confederacy commander Maguire was shot and killed by English forces whilst on a nearby reconnaissance mission. Maguire&#x27;s death was a major loss to the confederacy and prompted Tyrone to abruptly return to Ulster. Ultimately Tyrone&#x27;s religious rhetoric could not abolish the deep distrust the Old English had of the Gaelic Irish, and he looked again to Spanish intervention as a means of winning the war.

Tyrone stimulated the Irish-Spanish alliance by sending his son Henry to Spain in April 1600. At this time controversial Jesuit James Archer operated as his representative at the Spanish court. Shortly after Tyrone&#x27;s return to Ulster, he learnt that a Spanish ship had arrived bearing Archbishop of Dublin Mateo de Oviedo with letters from Philip III. The ship carried considerable supplies of money and ammunition for the confederacy.
=== Baron Mountjoy ===

In February 1600, Charles Blount, 8th Baron Mountjoy, Essex&#x27;s successor as Lord Deputy, arrived in Ireland. He was a protégé of Essex and similarly a favourite at court. Mountjoy posed a major threat to Tyrone as he began immediately revitalising and restoring confidence in the English army. He assigned veteran soldiers Arthur Chichester and George Carew to Ulster and Munster respectively.

In May 1600 the English achieved a strategic breakthrough when Sir Henry Docwra, at the head of a considerable army, took up a position at Tyrone&#x27;s rear in Derry. Docwra persuaded several unsatisfied confederacy members to defect to the English. These Irish soldiers, particularly Niall Garve O&#x27;Donnell, emboldened the English troops and allowed Docwra to significantly weaken Tyrone&#x27;s forces.

In September Mountjoy established his camp at Faughart with the intention of conducting a winter campaign against Tyrone. There was some fighting in the Moyry Pass, where Tyrone had entrenched himself, compelling him to retire to Armagh. A large reward was offered for the Earl&#x27;s capture, dead or alive. Tyrone was in a desperate position. Upset with setbacks, he began drinking heavily and took his frustrations out on his wife Catherine.

=== Spanish intervention and siege of Kinsale ===

As 1601 began, Philip III was focused on dispatching an expedition to Ireland in order to improve his position in the Anglo-Spanish War. In October 1601, the long-awaited aid from Spain appeared in the form of an army under Spanish commander Don Juan del Águila, which occupied the town of Kinsale in the extreme south of the country. Tyrone was displeased at the small size of the force and the fact that they had landed in the south—moving his army there would mean leaving Ulster unprotected. Mountjoy rushed to contain the Spanish, but it was not till the beginning of November that Tyrone was able to put his army in motion. In December his army united with O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s at Bandon. The two chieftains reluctantly marched separately from the north, through territories defended by Carew, in the depths of a severe winter. They gained little support en route.The Irish presence at Kinsale trapped the English army between them and the Spaniards. Tyrone and O&#x27;Donnell seem to have initially agreed on starving out the besiegers, but Juan del Águila urged a prompt combined attack on the English lines. Contemporary writers Lughaidh Ó Cléirigh and Philip O&#x27;Sullivan Beare claim that O&#x27;Donnell naively urged Tyrone to attack, but not all modern historians believe these accounts are accurate. John McGurk, J. J. Silke, Cyril Falls and McGettigan concur; Morgan and Gerard Anthony Hayes-McCoy disagree. O&#x27;Donnell had previously induced Tyrone into a full frontal assault during a campaign in 1598, so this narrative is not out of the question. Morgan claims it was the pressure from the beleaguered Spaniards that wore down Tyrone, and that the Earl also had his reputation on the line. In any case, Tyrone uncharacteristically yielded to the Spanish officers and resolved to make an immediate joint attack.

On the morning of 24 December 1601, Tyrone&#x27;s force of 5,000 men took their position. As soon as they were spotted, Mountjoy ordered his men to attack. Tyrone retreated but Mountjoy&#x27;s cavalry routed the fleeing soldiers. 1,200 men were killed and another 800 were wounded. The battle was a disaster for Tyrone and nullified years of his wartime success. The Earl was strongly in favour of another attempt, but he was overruled by O&#x27;Donnell who laid blame on Juan del Águila. After the failure at Kinsale, the chance of the confederacy winning the war had passed. In his haste to leave Munster, 140 of Tyrone&#x27;s men drowned while passing the Blackwater. According to Carew, a troop of women could have beaten Tyrone&#x27;s army on its homeward march.

=== Peace settlement ===
O&#x27;Donnell went to Spain to seek further assistance, where he died in late 1602 of a sudden illness, aged 29. With a shattered force, Tyrone made his way once more to the north, where he renewed his policy of ostensibly seeking pardon while warily defending his territory.

The Crown&#x27;s army swept the country. The English forces began to close in on Tyrone—Mountjoy from the south, and Dowcra and Chichester from the north. Mountjoy destroyed the traditional O&#x27;Neill inauguration stone at Tullyhogue. With queen Elizabeth in bad health, Tyrone may have been set on holding out until James VI of Scotland acceded to the English throne—he had diplomatic relations with James earlier in the war.

English forces managed to destroy crops and livestock in Ulster in 1601–1602, especially in the lands of Tyrone&#x27;s principal vassal (and son-in-law) Donnell Ballagh O&#x27;Cahan. This led to O&#x27;Cahan&#x27;s surrender and withdrawal from Tyrone in July 1602, which drastically weakened the Earl&#x27;s power. In June 1602 Tyrone destroyed his capital at Dungannon and retreated into the woods of Glenconkeyne. Mountjoy continued to pursue Tyrone to no avail. The Earl entered Fermanagh in autumn but was back in Glenconkeyne by December. He was able to rely on fellow Irish lords to provide him with provisions and intelligence. Whilst in Glenconkeyne, exactly a year after the defeat at Kinsale, Tyrone wrote a letter to Philip III asking for a Spanish warship to be sent to Ulster. The English army&#x27;s use of scorched earth tactics led to famine across 1602–1603, with conditions so extreme that the local population were reduced to cannibalism. In January 1603, Mountjoy admitted to Cecil that capturing the Earl would be up to chance. Despite his efforts, Mountjoy could not convince anyone to betray Tyrone.

On 22 December 1602, Tyrone offered his submission on his own terms, but this was firmly rejected by the queen. She insisted that Tyrone&#x27;s title should be stripped from him and that his lands should be reduced. Early in 1603, Mountjoy opened negotiations with Tyrone. Tyrone made his submission to Mountjoy on 30 March at Mellifont Abbey. The queen had died on 24 March but Mountjoy concealed this news until the negotiations had concluded. Had Tyrone known of Elizabeth&#x27;s death, he would likely have bargained more aggressively. The primary stipulations of the treaty were that the Gaelic chieftains abandon brehon law, dissolve their private armies and swear loyalty only to the English Crown. These were particularly generous terms. On 8 April Tyrone renewed his submission before Mountjoy and the council in Dublin. This was where Tyrone heard of the queen&#x27;s death; he apparently wept with frustration. After Tyrone&#x27;s submission, the remaining confederates followed suit. This marked the end of the Nine Years&#x27; War.

== Post-war, 1603–1607 ==
At about the end of May, Tyrone sailed to England with Mountjoy and Rory O&#x27;Donnell, Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s younger brother and successor. They arrived at London on 4 June. Tyrone and Rory presented themselves to Elizabeth&#x27;s successor, King James I, at Hampton Court. The English courtiers were greatly incensed at the gracious reception accorded by James to these notable rebels. Sir John Harington was outraged &quot;to see that damnable rebel Tyrone brought to England, honoured, and well-liked... [He] now smileth in peace at those who did hazard their lives to destroy him&quot;. Tyrone even went hunting with the new king.

Under a new patent almost as extensive as the one he had been given in 1587, Tyrone was confirmed in his title and core estates. He was also bold enough to request the lord presidency of Ulster, but was only allowed lieutenancy of Tyrone and Armagh. Rory was made 1st Earl of Tyrconnell. Whilst Tyrone was in England, he sent a letter to Philip III offering to take up arms for Spain if peace negotiations between Spain and England failed.

Tyrone returned to Ireland at the end of August and began rebuilding his estates, an easy task under the reserved government of Sir George Carey, who had replaced Mountjoy as Lord Deputy. As part of the Treaty of Mellifont, Tyrone was given authority over O&#x27;Cahan, whom he retained animosity towards due to his desertion during the war. A land rights dispute shortly arose between them, as O&#x27;Cahan&#x27;s surrender to Docwra was under the promise that O&#x27;Cahan would retain his land as an independent chieftain. Tyrone maintained that O&#x27;Cahan&#x27;s independence was incompatible with the terms of his own restoration, and insisted on exacting his customary rents from him. Docwra pleaded for O&#x27;Cahan&#x27;s case before the council, but Mountjoy sided with Tyrone. O&#x27;Cahan was forced to yield a third of his ancestral lands to the Earl.

In February 1605 Arthur Chichester became Lord Deputy. Chichester&#x27;s attitude towards the Gaelic lords was markedly more aggressive. He abolished brehon law and removed the authority that senior lords had over junior nobles—making O&#x27;Cahan a freeholder with new legal rights.

Chichester was also antagonistic to Tyrone, forcing him to attend Protestant services and accusing him of plotting with Spain. It became clear to Tyrone that the restoration of his earldom meant little. Tyrone&#x27;s marriage became strained and in December 1605 he considered divorcing his wife Catherine. Chichester sent officer Toby Caulfield to recruit Catherine as a double agent, but she dismissed this out of hand.

Tyrone lost his support from the council when Mountjoy died in April 1606. George Montgomery, the new Protestant Bishop of Derry, exacerbated the conflict between Tyrone and O&#x27;Cahan by encouraging O&#x27;Cahan to renew his suit against Tyrone. Attorney-General for Ireland Sir John Davies prepared a case to prove that O&#x27;Cahan&#x27;s lands were legally vested in the Crown, and he also acted as O&#x27;Cahan&#x27;s counsel during the proceedings. Montgomery also encouraged O&#x27;Cahan to leave his wife, Tyrone&#x27;s daughter Rose (former wife of Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell), and return to his first wife Mary, who he was apparently never actually divorced from. Montgomery wrote to Chichester on 4 March 1607: &quot;the breach between [O&#x27;Cahan] and his landlord [Tyrone] will be the greater by means of [Tyrone&#x27;s] daughter, his reputed wife, whom he has resolved to leave, having a former wife lawfully married to him.&quot; O&#x27;Cahan later repudiated his marriage to Rose. Tyrone would ask for Rose&#x27;s dowry back, but O&#x27;Cahan retained it. It is clear that government officials were harnessing O&#x27;Cahan&#x27;s hostility to orchestrate Tyrone&#x27;s undoing.

Tensions between Tyrone and the English government escalated. Tyrone&#x27;s continued correspondence with Spain broke his promises made at Mellifont. In 1607, the 1st Earl of Tyrconnell accidentally exposed a plot to seize Dublin Castle, hopefully with Tyrone&#x27;s involvement, during a conversation with Richard Nugent, Lord Delvin.

Though the government had no evidence to charge Tyrone with, they suspected his intention to raise up a fresh rebellion, and in April 1607 the Earl was summoned to Dublin to answer O&#x27;Cahan&#x27;s plaint. O&#x27;Cahan had received loans to fund his case. During their meeting in court that May, Tyrone lost his temper. He snatched a document from O&#x27;Cahan&#x27;s hands and tore it up in front of Chichester. Tyrone&#x27;s violent behaviour towards O&#x27;Cahan greatly damaged his cause. The government, unable to come to any definite conclusion, referred the matter to the king&#x27;s decision, and Tyrone promised to go to London.

By September, Tyrconnell&#x27;s supposed plot was known to the government. Historians are undecided on whether this plot actually existed and if the government intended to arrest Tyrone. The exact cause of Tyrone&#x27;s flight is a matter of controversy among historians, though he certainly believed that his arrest was imminent. Information reached clan chief Cuconnacht Maguire that the government intended to arrest Tyrone if he went to England. Maguire sent a vessel of eighty tons into the north of Ireland to facilitate an escape. Tyrconnell already planned to leave, and he convinced Tyrone to flee to Spain with him. Tyrone was at Slane with Chichester when news of the vessel&#x27;s arrival reached him. He seems to have come to an immediate snap decision; it was afterwards recollected &quot;that he took his leave of the lord deputy in a more sad and passionate manner than he used at other times&quot;. Tyrone left for Dungannon to collect his wife and children.

==Exile in Rome, 1607–1616==
=== Flight of the Earls ===
&quot;The Flight of the Earls&quot; occurred on 14 September 1607, when Tyrone and Tyrconnell embarked at midnight at Rathmullan on Lough Swilly on a voyage bound for Spain. Accompanying them were their wives, families and retainers, numbering ninety-nine persons. This effectively marked the collapse of Gaelic Irish society. Tyrone was clearly agitated during the departure. Due to time constraints, he left his five-year-old son Conn Ruadh behind, to Catherine&#x27;s distress. According to an English account, &quot;[Catherine] being exceedingly weary slipped down from her horse and weeping said she could go no further.&quot; Tyrone responded by threatening her with his sword &quot;if she did not pass on with him and put on a more cheerful countenance&quot;.

Driven by contrary winds to the east, the refugees took shelter in the Seine estuary and were told by the Spanish to pass the winter in the Spanish Netherlands and not to proceed to Spain itself. The hopes of the earls for military support foundered as Philip III, on the verge of bankruptcy, sought to maintain the recent 1604 peace treaty with England. Tyrone accepted the offer of Pope Paul V to take up his abode in Rome, and on 28 February 1608 he and his companions, now reduced to thirty-two persons, left Leuven. Tyrone and his fellow nobles left their younger children behind in Leuven under the care of Irish Franciscans.

On 29 April, Tyrone and Tyrconnell were welcomed into Rome by a large concourse of ecclesiastics. The two earls met the pope the next day. The journey to Rome was recorded in great detail by writer Tadhg Ó Cianáin. In November 1607 the flight was proclaimed as treasonous by James I. A bill of attainder was passed against Tyrone by the Parliament of Ireland on 28 October 1614.

=== Exile ===
The pope granted Tyrone a monthly pension of a hundred crowns, and a house (on Borgo Vecchio) rent-free, together with an allowance of bread and wine for ten persons. Philip III added four hundred ducats a month. Compared to his arrangements in Ireland, this was a miserly lifestyle. During his time in Rome, Tyrone attended papal ceremonies, visited catacombs and relics, ascended the Scala Santa on his knees, and made the traditional pilgrimage to the Seven Pilgrim Churches of Rome. In 1608 Tyrconnell died of a fever, and by 1610, Tyrone&#x27;s eldest sons Hugh and Henry had also died. Tyrone continued to petition Philip III for his assistance, pleading him to &quot;liberate [Catholic Ireland] from heresy and tyranny&quot;, but had no success.

Tyrone quickly became disillusioned with his exile and yearned to return to his position in Ireland. He did not give up the possibility of return and toyed variously both with schemes to oust English authority outright and with proposed offers of pardon from London. When the former Crown loyalist Cahir O&#x27;Doherty launched his failed rebellion in 1608, it briefly raised hopes of a return. English spies were monitoring Tyrone during this period. In 1613 the English government briefly discussed with Tyrone a potential reconciliation. Tyrone ceased his petitioning to Philip III by 1614 when he was threatened with losing his pension unless he remained silent. By this time, Tyrone was planning an ambitious return to Ireland with Spanish aid. In March 1615, he declared to Philip III that &quot;rather than live in Rome, he would prefer to go to his land with a hundred soldiers and die there in defence of the Catholic faith and of his fatherland&quot;. In July he bemoaned that he would likely &quot;die within four or six years&quot; and he did not wish to die &quot;without the consolation of dying fighting for my religion and the territories of my forebears&quot;.

=== Death and burial ===
In late 1615, Tyrone fell ill with a fever and never recovered. His eyesight failed him at the start of 1616. Tyrone died in Rome on 20 July 1616.

His elaborate funeral was paid for by the Spanish ambassador and attended by cardinals, foreign ambassadors, dignitaries, and many Irish nobles. The English ambassador in Madrid, Francis Cottington, reported on Tyrone&#x27;s funeral: &quot;Upon the news of his death, I observe that all the principal Irish entertained in several parts of this Kingdom are repaired unto this court, as [Donal Cam O&#x27;Sullivan Beare, 1st Count of Berehaven], from the Groyne (i.e. la Coruna); Raymond Burke from Lisbon; one who calls himself Desmond from Bayonne in Galicia; and the Archbishop of Tuam, from Alcala, with many others of less note, but captains and of good quality.&quot;

He was interred in the church of San Pietro in Montorio, beside his son Hugh, his ally Tyrconnell, and Tyrconnell&#x27;s brother Cathbarr O&#x27;Donnell. In a letter dated 27 July, the Council of State remarked to Philip III that &quot;as the Earl left no funds for his burial, Cardinal Borja spent what was necessary at the expense of the Embassy... but in doing this he endeavoured to cover such appearances as might cause difficulties in the relations of your Majesty with the King of England&quot;. This explains the brevity of the inscription on Tyrone&#x27;s tomb. The original tombstone was lost in 1849 during the Risorgimento. In 1989 Tomás Ó Fiaich laid a new marble plaque with the same inscription.

Upon news of Tyrone&#x27;s death, the court poets of Ireland engaged in the contention of the bards. His presence in Europe was a constant source of concern for the English, and his death came as a welcome relief. The &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot;, compiled in 1636, praise the Earl: &quot;the person who here died was a powerful, mighty lord, [endowed] with wisdom, subtlety, and profundity of mind and intellect; a warlike, predatory, enterprising lord, in defending his religion and patrimony against his enemies&quot;. Conversely, because Tyrone had deserted his people in 1607, his own generation expressed little admiration for him.

== Legacy ==
Historian James MacGeoghegan rehabilitated Tyrone&#x27;s image in the seventeenth century. This carried into the nineteenth century when Irish nationalists such as John Mitchel developed a romantic myth around Tyrone, portraying him as a selfless idealist dedicated to the freedom of Gaelic Ireland. Nevertheless, Tyrone tended to be sidelined in favour of his wartime ally Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell. Tyrone&#x27;s &quot;Machiavellian&quot; nature and his partially-English cultural identity are reasons he was not embraced by Irish nationalists in the same way as O&#x27;Donnell, whose traditional Celtic upbringing, sensational prison break saga and tragic early death made him a Gaelic Irish martyr and national hero.

Seán Ó Faoláin&#x27;s biography &quot;The Great O&#x27;Neill&quot; (1942) is the most influential modern work on Tyrone. It attracted a large readership but is today considered inaccurate and overdramatised. Particularly, Ó Faoláin incorrectly claims that Tyrone grew up in England (instead of the Pale) and he overtly romanticises Tyrone&#x27;s marriage to Mabel Bagenal. &quot;The Great O&#x27;Neill&quot; was so popular that it was used by Brian Friel as the basis for his 1988 play &quot;Making History&quot;, which focuses on Tyrone reckoning with his legacy post-Flight.

Hiram Morgan&#x27;s book &quot;Tyrone&#x27;s Rebellion&quot; (1993), which focuses on Tyrone&#x27;s life up to 1596, restored the Earl to the status he was formerly afforded by contemporary English commentators. Tyrone now overshadows O&#x27;Donnell in most modern depictions of the Nine Years&#x27; War. Morgan judges Tyrone more harshly than Ó Faoláin, and compared to other historians, he portrays Tyrone as loyal to the confederacy from the beginning. Generally speaking, contemporary historians see Tyrone as a more compelling figure than O&#x27;Donnell. They also recognise Tyrone&#x27;s self-serving reasons for entering the war and blame Tyrone for expediting Gaelic Ireland&#x27;s decline.

== Financial and military power ==
Unsatisfied with the tribute or rents entitled to him as O&#x27;Neill clan chief, Tyrone heavily increased taxes on his subjects. Like his predecessor Shane O&#x27;Neill, Tyrone introduced conscription to all men within his country, regardless of their social class. He also tied the peasantry to the land, effectively making them serfs, increasing the production of materials and guaranteeing his supply of labour. Eventually, he was generating revenue of £80,000 per year. For comparison, in the 1540s the Tudor monarchy&#x27;s total tax revenue was about £31,000. Although that figure had certainly increased since then, in financial terms Tyrone was in a position to challenge the English administration.

This revenue allowed him to purchase muskets, pikes and ammunition from Britain. Firearms were the primary weapon in Tyrone&#x27;s army. In 1590, the Crown allowed Tyrone to obtain six tonnes of lead, ostensibly to weatherproof his hall in Dungannon, but he melted the lead into bullets for his army. Across late 1594 and early 1595, he bought £8,000 worth of gunpowder, lead and firearms from Scotland.

Tyrone could arm and feed over 8,000 men—impressive for a Gaelic lord. They were trained and equipped with the latest European weapons and tactics, including pike and shot. Many of his soldiers were being trained by veterans returned from the Spanish army. Tyrone also had several Spanish and English military advisors in his pay, the Spanish ones having been sent by Philip II.

Tyrone&#x27;s forces were very poor at siege warfare, as evident by their many failures to capture the occupied Blackwater fort. Tyrone had not been formally trained in regular warfare, hence why most of his successful battles were fought guerilla-style. Nevertheless with only small forces he was able to defeat the best English generals sent by Elizabeth I and exhaust her resources. Contemporary English sources lamented how Tyrone was &quot;educated in our discipline and naturally valiant [and had become] worthily reputed the best man of war of his nation&quot;. Henry IV of France declared Tyrone to be one of the best generals of his time.

== Religious beliefs ==
Wartime propaganda depicted Tyrone as a &quot;Catholic crusader&quot;, though many of his contemporaries had their doubts regarding the sincerity of his religious convictions. It is generally believed that his preoccupations were political rather than religious. In response to Tyrone framing the Nine Years&#x27; War as one of religious freedom, the 2nd of Earl of Essex quipped &quot;thou carest for religion as much as my horse&quot;.

Tyrone was born to Catholic parents, but raised amongst Protestants since the age of 8. The Hovenden family were the &quot;least Protestant of the New English settlers&quot;. Tyrone&#x27;s education in the Pale certainly would have anglicised him, but would not necessarily have led to an identity crisis. In fact, his background gave him the advantage of having allies from both British and Irish backgrounds.

Tyrone feigned support for the Crown through the 1580s and early 1590s. On visits to Dublin, he would attend Protestant services with the Lord Deputy. Tyrone&#x27;s 1591 marriage ceremony was performed by a Protestant bishop, because Tyrone wanted the marriage recognised under English law. Mabel later converted to Catholicism. Tyrone celebrated Easter 1584 per the Pope&#x27;s new Gregorian calendar.

Once in open rebellion with the Crown, Tyrone publicly declared that his ultimate objective was to support the freedoms of Catholics by establishing the religion throughout Ireland. This proclamation was predominantly to widen support for his confederacy nationally and abroad, rather than as an authentic statement of belief. In fact, during 1596 peace negotiations the religious nature of his demands came as a surprise to the Dublin government; though he was willing to drop his demand for liberty of conscience. His wartime appeals to Spain typically highlighted the persecution Ireland suffered as a fellow Catholic nation.

Historians Nicholas Canny and Thomas O&#x27;Connor believe that Tyrone underwent a genuine religious conversion in the late 1590s. It was reported in August 1598 that O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s men made confession before the battle. O&#x27;Connor believes that Tyrone&#x27;s sentimental address at the 1599 parley of Dungannon is indicative of a &quot;conversion experience&quot; and goes beyond simple propaganda rhetoric. In his address, Tyrone candidly admitted his initially secular motives on entering the war and described Roman Catholicism as the one true religion. In the same year Tyrone went on pilgrimage to Holycross in Munster. In a 1600 memorandum to Pope Clement VIII, as part of the &quot;Faith and Fatherland&quot; campaign, Catholic Archbishop Peter Lombard refuted charges against Tyrone&#x27;s past: &quot;During his tutelage under the English, [he] never thought or professed anything other than what was orthodox in religion&quot;. According to Lombard, O&#x27;Neill attended daily mass, even in the field, and regularly confessed and received communion. Lombard admitted that Tyrone &quot;was not yet always equally solicitous, earnest and zealous in the cause of religion&quot;, and claimed that it was the Earl&#x27;s wartime experiences and the providential nature of his success on the field that molded him into a militant Catholic figure. During his exile, Tyrone interacted with the Pope and partook in traditional pilgrimages, but his religious views were apparently less dogmatic. This hints that Lombard may have exaggerated Tyrone&#x27;s devoutness. Ultimately, Tyrone left no personal record of his faith.

== Personality ==

Although Tyrone lacked the magnetism and charisma of his son-in-law Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell, he was possessed of a considerable charm that produced confidence in others. Tyrone&#x27;s charm extended even to Queen Elizabeth; letters patent reference him as &quot;one Her Majesty would not willing deny any favour, knowing his devotion to her&quot;. This allowed him to build a wide range of contacts, including Old English, Gaelic Irish and New English figures, making him one of the most accomplished Irish politicians of his day. Historians have remarked on Tyrone&#x27;s cultural fluency, which was unusual for Gaelic lords of the era. Tyrone&#x27;s ability to speak English gave him a clear advantage in dealings with English politicians.

Tyrone&#x27;s two-faced nature was well-known; as Attorney-General Davies put it, &quot;when the earl was in the presence of Englishmen, he was content to be called earl; but when among his followers, he would be highly indignant, nay, offended, if he was not styled &#x27;O&#x27;Neill&#x27;&quot;. Tyrone was also a skilled negotiator; he typically played the &quot;good cop&quot; to O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s &quot;bad cop&quot; during meetings with the government. O&#x27;Donnell was more aggressive and militaristic whereas Tyrone favoured negotiation with their enemies. He avoided impulsive decisions and was prepared to use English techniques to fight his enemies. According to historian Edward Alfred D&#x27;Alton, for these reasons, Tyrone bore little resemblance to the average boastful and talkative Gaelic lord.

However, Tyrone was also a ruthless politician not opposed to murdering his opponents for political gain. He was willing to put himself in danger during his many travels to Dublin. Tyrone was overly ambitious in his war aims, particularly since he had not been formally trained in warfare. His habitual brazenness, his inability to win over the Old English and his over-reliance on Spanish intervention are the major factors that led to his defeat in the Nine Years&#x27; War. Conversely to D&#x27;Alton, Morgan notes that Tyrone&#x27;s sudden flight from Ireland, leaving many of his people to suffer in the Plantation of Ulster, displays a selfishness that is typical of a Gaelic lord. Canny calls Tyrone a &quot;forceful, determined and unscrupulous individual, who would allow nothing, and certainly not loyalty to Gaelic institutional life, to hinder his ambitions&quot;. Tyrone&#x27;s disregard for Gaelic tradition and his Gaelic countrymen became evident following the war&#x27;s end. Like his chieftain predecessors, Tyrone spent his life focused primarily on the pursuit and retention of power.

William Camden, Elizabeth I&#x27;s official historian, described Tyrone:

== Family ==

=== Daughter of Brian McPhelim O&#x27;Neill ===
In his late teens, he married a daughter of Brian McPhelim O&#x27;Neill of Clandeboye—possibly named Katherine or Feodora. Brian was in the queen&#x27;s favour and initially appeared to be a useful ally against Turlough Luineach. In 1574, after being incriminated in a violent conflict with English colonists, Brian and his immediate family were imprisoned, tried for treason and executed. Hugh withdrew any association with his father-in-law by annulling the marriage on grounds of consanguinity. Thus, the children of this marriage were considered illegitimate by English society. Tyrone&#x27;s first wife later married Niall MacBrian Faghartach O&#x27;Neill.

Their children include:
* A daughter who married Sir Ross McMahon shortly before February 1579. Towards the end of 1579, her father intended to remarry her to Philip O&#x27;Relieghe.
* Conn (died December 1601), known as Conn Mac An Iarla. He served as an important captain to Tyrone throughout the war. Conn was wounded near Kilmallock in 1600 and died in December the following year. His son Feardorcha took part in the Flight of the Earls.
Children of Tyrone, possibly by his first wife, include:
* Rose ( 1587 – 1607), who was betrothed to Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell by 1587. They married in December 1592 and separated in 1595 due to her &quot;barrenness&quot;. Despite reconciling in April 1597, by the following year they had divorced, putting Tyrone&#x27;s partnership with O&#x27;Donnell under strain. In 1599 she remarried to Donnell Ballagh O&#x27;Cahan to strengthen ties between O&#x27;Cahan and Tyrone, but O&#x27;Cahan repudiated the marriage around 1607.
* A daughter who married her first cousin Henry McArt O&#x27;Neill, son of Art MacBaron O&#x27;Neill
=== Siobhán O&#x27;Donnell ===
Hugh married Siobhán O&#x27;Donnell (died January 1591) in June 1574, beginning his enduring alliance with the O&#x27;Donnells of Tyrconnell. The 1st Earl of Essex announced the marriage on 14 June 1574. In 1579, Hugh briefly repudiated his marriage to Siobhán and prepared to wed a daughter of Turlough Luineach, with the aim of becoming the O&#x27;Neill tanist. The government easily dissuaded Hugh as Turlough&#x27;s age and ill health meant his death was probably soon anyway. Hugh reconciled with his wife.

They had two sons and multiple daughters:
* Margaret ( 1598) who married Richard Butler, 3rd Viscount Mountgarret shortly before 8 October 1596—possibly in October 1595.
* Sarah ( 1595–1602), who married Sir Arthur Roe Magennis, 1st Viscount Iveagh sometime before 4 March 1595—possibly in 1590. Through Sarah, Tyrone is an ancestor to the Anglo-Irish Wellesley family.
* Mary ( 1608), who married Brian McHugh Og MacMahon. According to historian George Hill, she is the same woman who married Sir Ross McMahon.
* Alice (1583 – ) who married Randal MacDonnell, 1st Earl of Antrim in 1604. She was younger than her sisters Sarah and Mary, and older than her brother Hugh.
* Hugh, 4th Baron Dungannon ( – 24 September 1609); he died in Rome and was buried in San Pietro in Montorio.
* Henry ( – 25 August 1610); he became a colonel of an Irish regiment in the Archduke&#x27;s army.

=== Mabel Bagenal ===
Tyrone was betrothed to Mabel Bagenal ( – December 1595) in July 1591. They married on 3 August 1591 and had no offspring together.

In May 1593 the couple clashed over the assassination of Phelim MacTurlough O&#x27;Neill - &quot;the countess clapping her hands together was sorry, as should seem, of that which happened, to whom the earl in English spoke with vehemency&quot;. Casway believes that despite the romantic circumstances of their courtship, the marriage &quot;probably ran its course&quot; and Tyrone would have continued with his concubines. According to Tyrone himself, &quot;because I did affect two other gentlewomen, she grew in dislike with me, forsook me, and went unto her brother to complain upon me to the council of Ireland, and did exhibit articles against me&quot;. Mabel died in December 1595, aged around 24 years old.

=== Catherine Magennis ===
Tyrone married Catherine Magennis (died 15 March 1619) around August 1597. He jilted the daughter of Angus MacDonald, 8th of Dunnyveg, to marry Catherine instead. It was a political marriage intended to bring the previously neutral Magennis family into the confederacy.

In 1600, with the confederacy facing failure, Tyrone began drinking heavily and took his frustrations out on Catherine. He considered divorcing her in December 1605, but allegedly she confronted him and warned that if he didn&#x27;t stop his abuse, she &quot;would discover him so far as to infer again to rebellion or to lose his head&quot;. Catherine reluctantly accompanied Tyrone on his flight. Tyrone&#x27;s will did not sufficiently provide for her, and she died penniless in Naples. She had three sons:
* Shane (18 October 1599 – 27 January 1641) who was recognised by the Spanish court as the successive Earl of Tyrone (&quot;El Conde de Tyrone&quot;). He entered the Spanish army and was killed in Catalonia.
* Conn Ruadh ( – in or after 1622), also known as Conn na Creige. He was left behind at the time of the flight, was educated at Eton College as a Protestant, and was committed to the Tower of London on 12 August 1622.
* Brian ( – 16 August 1617), who was found hanged in his room in Brussels under suspicious circumstances, possibly murdered by an English assassin.

=== Other children ===
Tyrone also had many illegitimate children or children of unknown maternal origin:
* Margaret O&#x27;Neill ( 1593–1612), who married Hugh Maguire around May 1593
* Catherine O&#x27;Neill ( 1602), who married Henry Oge O&#x27;Neill. Their son was Turlough McHenry O&#x27;Neill.
* A daughter, who married Donnell Oneyle
* A daughter ( 1615; probably named Bridget) who was with Tyrone before his death
* A daughter ( 1610) who married Brian Art Roe McEny

== Depictions ==

=== Portraits ===

According to historian James Kane, the only authenticated likeness of Hugh O&#x27;Neill is part of a fresco in the Vatican. Painted circa 1610, the fresco depicts his attendance at the 1608 canonization of Frances of Rome by Pope Paul V. He stands next to the 1st Earl of Tyrconnell, sometimes mistaken for the Spanish ambassador.

An illustration of Tyrone appears in Primo Demaschino&#x27;s &quot;La Spada d&#x27;Orione&quot;, published in Rome in 1680. According to Hiram Morgan, this illustration is a true likeness of Tyrone. Another image of Tyrone appears in Charles Patrick Meehan&#x27;s 1868 book &quot;The Fate and Fortunes of Hugh O&#x27;Neill, Earl of Tyrone, and Rory O&#x27;Donel, Earl of Tyrconnel&quot;. Dunlop believed that this portrait was &quot;made in [Tyrone&#x27;s] decrepitude at Rome&quot;.

Lord Dunsany owned a reputed nineteenth-century portrait of Tyrone, from an original in the Vatican. According to Morgan, it is based on the &quot;La Spada d&#x27;Orione&quot; illustration. It exhibited at the 1866 Exhibition of National Portraits. William Holl the Younger produced an engraving of Tyrone based on this portrait. According to Des Ekin, this common image of Tyrone as a stocky armoured figure with cropped hair and a bushy black beard is &quot;almost certainly a Victorian fantasy&quot;. Drawings from the 1620s depict Tyrone as a wiry man with a pointed beard and dark eyes.

The Ulster Museum owns two portraits of Tyrone—both were painted in the 19th century.

=== Literature ===
* In his 1861 poem &quot;Eirinn a&#x27; Gul&quot; (&quot;Ireland Weeping&quot;), Scottish Gaelic poet William Livingston () laments the loss of the Irish clan chiefs who led their clansmen in war and provided &quot;leadership of the old and true Gaelic kind&quot;. Mac Dhunlèibhe comments that the 19th-century fighters for Irish republicanism had none of the heroic qualities shown by Tyrone, Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell and Hugh Maguire during the Nine Years&#x27; War. Expressing hope for the future of the Irish people, Mac Dhunlèibhe closes by asking where the Irish clan warriors are who charged out of the mist and slaughtered the enemy armies at the Battle of the Yellow Ford and the Battle of Moyry Pass.
* &quot;Flint and Mirror&quot;, a 2022 novel by John Crowley, depicts Tyrone as a man whose loyalties are magically divided between the Queen of England and the old gods of Ireland.

=== Screen ===
* Hugh O&#x27;Neill was played by Alan Hale Sr. in &quot;The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex&quot; (1939).
* Hugh O&#x27;Neill was portrayed by Tom Adams in the Disney film &quot;The Fighting Prince of Donegal&quot; (1966), with a character name change to Henry O&#x27;Neill.
* In the 1971 BBC drama &quot;Elizabeth R&quot; he was played by Patrick O&#x27;Connell. The drama depicts his riverside parley with the 2nd Earl of Essex.
* The BBC Northern Ireland documentary programme &quot;You Thought You Knew - The Plantation&quot; depicts several events from Tyrone&#x27;s life via re-enactment.
* In 2021, it was reported that writer Jack Armstrong was developing a television drama, titled &quot;The O&#x27;Neill&quot;, centered on Tyrone.

=== Theatre ===
* Tyrone is the central character in Brian Friel&#x27;s play &quot;Making History&quot; (1989), which is concerned largely with his third marriage to Mabel Bagenal; Friel describes the marriage as a genuine if ill-fated love affair. In its original production, Tyrone was played by actor Stephen Rea. In the 2007 production, for the 400th anniversary of the Flight of the Earls, Denis Conway played Tyrone.
* &quot;Running Beast&quot; (2007), a musical theatre piece by playwright Donal O&#x27;Kelly with music by the composer Michael Holohan, is based on Tyrone&#x27;s career. It commemorated the 400th anniversary of the Flight of the Earls.

<text>Michael Keller Ditka ( ; born Michael Dyczko; October 18, 1939) is an American former professional football player, coach, and television commentator. During his playing career, he was UPI NFL Rookie of Year in 1961, a five-time Pro Bowl selection, and a six-time All-Pro tight end with the Chicago Bears, Philadelphia Eagles, and Dallas Cowboys in the National Football League (NFL); he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1986 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1988. Ditka was the first tight end in NFL history to reach 1,000 yards receiving in his rookie season.

He was an NFL champion with the 1963 Bears and is a three-time Super Bowl champion, playing on the Cowboys&#x27; Super Bowl VI team, winning as an assistant coach for the Cowboys in Super Bowl XII, and coaching the Bears to victory in Super Bowl XX. He has been named to the NFL&#x27;s 75th- and 100th-Anniversary All-Time Teams.

As a head coach for the Bears from 1982 to 1992, he was twice both the AP and UPI NFL Coach of Year (1985 and 1988). He also was the head coach of the New Orleans Saints from 1997 to 1999.

Ditka and Tom Flores are the only people to win a Super Bowl as a player, an assistant coach, and a head coach. Ditka, Flores, Gary Kubiak, and Doug Pederson are also the only people in modern NFL history to win a championship as head coach of a team for which they played previously. Ditka is the only person to participate in both of the last two Chicago Bears&#x27; league championships, as a player in 1963 and as head coach in 1985.

In 2020, Ditka became the owner of the X League, a women&#x27;s tackle football league that was originally the Lingerie Football League.

He is known by the nickname &quot;Iron Mike&quot;, which he has said comes from his being born and raised in a steel town in Pennsylvania.

==Early life==
Ditka was born Michael Dyczko, on October 18, 1939, in Carnegie, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh, the oldest child of Charlotte (Keller) and Mike Ditka Sr. He grew up in nearby Aliquippa with siblings Ashton, David, and Mary Ann. His father, a welder, was one of three brothers of a Polish and Ukrainian family in the coal-mining and steel-manufacturing area in Western Pennsylvania. His ancestry on his mother&#x27;s side is Irish and German. Others in his hometown found it hard to pronounce the name Dyczko, so the family name was changed to &quot;Ditka&quot;. Ditka attended St. Titus School.

Ditka attended Aliquippa High School, where he was a three-sport star under head coach Press Maravich. While at Aliquippa High School, the team doctor, John L. Miller, took Mike and other players to Pitt football games and encouraged them to play for Pitt. Ditka is quoted as saying, &quot;Doc Miller patched me up many times&quot;. Ditka hoped to escape his hometown&#x27;s manufacturing jobs by attending college with a football scholarship. Initially planning to become a dentist, he was recruited by three NCAA Division I teams: Notre Dame, Penn State, and Pitt.

==College career==

Ditka played college football for Pitt from 1958 until 1960, and was a three-sport athlete, also playing baseball (outfielder) and basketball (forward) for the Pitt Panthers. He also was an intramural wrestling champion at Pitt, and a member of Sigma Chi fraternity.

He started on the football team all three seasons, leading the team in receiving in each, while also serving as a linebacker, defensive end, and punter. As a sophomore, he led the team with 18 receptions for 252 yards and averaged 42.5 yards per punt. He had one touchdown reception (tied for second on the team).

As a junior, he led the team with 16 receptions for 249 yards and four receiving touchdowns. He also averaged 38.3 yards per punt.

As a senior, he was named a team captain, while leading the team with 11 receptions for 229 yards and two receiving touchdowns. He was a unanimous first-team selection on the College Football All-America Team as a two-way end. He finished his college career with 45 passes for 730 yards and seven touchdowns.

In 1986, Ditka was enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame. In 1997, his 89 jersey number was retired by the University of Pittsburgh at halftime of the game against the University of Miami. In 2018, he was inducted into the inaugural 16-member class of the University of Pittsburgh Athletics Hall of Fame.

==Playing career==
=== Chicago Bears ===
Ditka was selected by the Chicago Bears fifth overall in the 1961 NFL draft, while the Houston Oilers drafted him eighth overall in the first round of the 1961 AFL Draft. He signed with the Bears and his presence was immediately felt. In his first season, Ditka had 58 receptions, introducing a new dimension to a tight end position that had previously been dedicated to blocking. He also scored 12 receiving touchdowns, which was the most by a Bears rookie. His success earned him Rookie of the Year honors. He continued to play for the Bears for the next five years, earning a Pro Bowl trip each season.

He played on the 1963 NFL championship team. Many of the players from that team, including Ditka, were drafted by assistant coach George Allen, a future Hall of Famer, who was then in charge of the Bears&#x27; drafts. During the season, against the Los Angeles Rams, Ditka tied Harlon Hill&#x27;s franchise record for the most receiving touchdowns in a game with four. Ditka ranks first among tight ends and fourth in Bears history with 4,503 yards, fifth in both receptions (316) and touchdown catches (34).

In 1962, he started all 14 games, making 58 receptions (tied for the team lead) for 904 yards (led the team) and five receiving touchdowns (led the team). In 1963, he led the team with 59 catches for 794 yards and eight touchdowns.

In 1964, he was second on the team with 75 receptions for 897 yards and five touchdowns. The next year, he posted 36 receptions (second on the team), 454 receiving yards (third on the team), and two receiving touchdowns (tied for fourth on the team).

In 1966, he registered 32 receptions (second on the team), 378 yards (third on the team) and two touchdowns (tied for second on the team). Ditka was also noted for decking football fan Felix Carbajal, who had run onto the playing field late in a Week 2 31–17 loss to the Rams at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on September 16. He had played out his option that season after not being able to reach a contract agreement with Bears&#x27; owner/head coach George Halas.

On February 8, 1967, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that just before the AFL–NFL merger, Ditka had signed a $300,000 contract with a $50,000 signing bonus with the Houston Oilers, the team that owned his AFL draft rights.

=== Philadelphia Eagles ===
On April 26, 1967, Ditka was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles along with a 1968 fourth-round pick (#106-Alan Bush), in exchange for quarterback Jack Concannon. The transaction was intended to fill roster vacancies created by the retirements of Eagles&#x27; tight end Pete Retzlaff and Bears&#x27; quarterback Rudy Bukich. His Oilers contract was transferred to the Eagles and Ditka was able to keep his $50,000 bonus to avoid any legal conflicts. His time as a Bears player bitterly came to an end with a parting shot in which he stated that Halas &quot;threw nickels around like manhole covers.&quot; He wore number 98 in his first season with the Eagles, while only playing in nine games with four starts because of injuries. Ditka was outplayed by tight end Jim Kelly, registering 26 receptions for 274 yards and two touchdowns.

In 1968, he changed his jersey number back to his usual 89. He appeared in 11 games with six starts, and his statistics were below tight end Fred Hill. He posted 13 receptions for 111 yards and two touchdowns.

=== Dallas Cowboys ===
On January 28, 1969, he was traded to the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for wide receiver Dave McDaniels. Pettis Norman ended up being named the starting tight end, but Ditka still was able to play in 12 games with four starts, while making 17 receptions for 268 yards and three touchdowns.

In 1970, he remained a reserve player behind Norman. He appeared in 14 games, while tallying eight receptions for 98 yards and no touchdowns. The Cowboys reached their first Super Bowl, losing 13–16 against the Baltimore Colts, by way of a field goal scored with five seconds left in regulation time.

In 1971, he was a backup player behind Billy Truax, appearing in 14 games with four starts. He set the franchise record for tight ends with 30 receptions in a season, while also compiling 360 receiving yards, one touchdown, and three kickoff returns for 30 yards. His highlight was a touchdown reception in the Cowboys&#x27; 24–3 victory over the Miami Dolphins in Super Bowl VI.

In 1972, he was named the starter at tight end, after Truax was limited by off-season knee surgery. He started all 14 games, posting 17 receptions for 198 yards and one touchdown, while alternating in some passing situations with rookie Jean Fugett.

On March 1, 1973, Ditka announced his retirement as a player, opening the door for him to be named the Cowboys wide receiver assistant coach under head coach Tom Landry. At the time, his 427 receptions were the most by a tight end in NFL history.

=== Hall of Fame ===
In 1988, his blocking and 427 career receptions for 5,812 yards and 43 touchdowns earned him the honor of being the first tight end inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Ditka also scored two touchdowns on offensive fumble recoveries, tying seven other players for the most in NFL history. In 1999, he was ranked number 90 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest Football Players.

==NFL career statistics==
===Regular season===
===Postseason===
==Coaching career==
Retiring after the 1972 season, Ditka was immediately hired as an assistant coach by Landry. Ditka spent nine seasons as an assistant coach with the Cowboys. During his tenure, the Cowboys made the playoffs eight times, won six division titles, three NFC championships, and a Super Bowl victory in 1977.

While working with the Cowboys, Ditka sent a letter to George Halas, his former head coach, who was still owner of the Bears. In the letter, Ditka expressed regret for the acrimonious manner in which his time with the Bears had come to an end and said that he would like to come back to Chicago and be the head coach of the Bears &quot;when he was ready&quot;. Meanwhile, the Cowboys continued to win games, although they did not win another Super Bowl while Ditka was there. His last game with the Cowboys was the 1981 NFC Championship Game, where the team fell to the San Francisco 49ers.

=== Chicago Bears ===
After firing previous coach Neill Armstrong following the 1981 season, Halas decided to take Ditka up on his offer from several years earlier, and hired him to become the team&#x27;s head coach for the 1982 season. Although the Bears had made the playoffs under Armstrong and his predecessor Jack Pardee, those were the only two winning seasons since Halas&#x27; retirement as coach, so he was looking for a coach who would bring the Bears back to prominence. Shortly after his hiring, as recounted by Mike Singletary in 2006, Ditka called a team meeting. In the meeting, he warned that the team would experience some turnover, but if they were all willing to work hard for him and stand with him, Ditka promised a trip to the Super Bowl within three seasons. Specifically, Ditka said, &quot;Give me three years, and if you walk with me, we&#x27;ll get to the dance.&quot;

By his third season in 1984, Ditka led the Bears to the NFC Championship Game, where the Bears were shut out by the eventual Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers in San Francisco. The following year in 1985, Ditka&#x27;s coaching career hit its pinnacle on January 26, 1986, with a 46–10 win over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XX at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans. Ditka has stated that one of his biggest regrets in life was not letting Walter Payton score a touchdown in the Super Bowl, instead opting for Jim McMahon to run it in twice and rookie defensive tackle William &quot;The Refrigerator&quot; Perry to run it in once. Nevertheless, Ditka has contended that his reluctance to give Payton the ball was justified on account of the disproportionately heavy coverage the Bears&#x27; star running back faced from the Patriots&#x27; defense, and insisted that Payton&#x27;s mere presence on the field was a decisive factor in the Bears&#x27; crushing victory notwithstanding personal statistics.
In 1985, Ditka led the Bears to a 15–1 record, and he was named NFL Coach of the Year by the Associated Press following the regular season. Football commentators widely regard the 1985 Bears defense as one of the best. The 1985 Bears defense was masterminded by defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan, with little oversight from Ditka; in fact, Ditka and Ryan had a largely adversarial relationship dating back to Ditka&#x27;s hiring as Ryan, who was already on the coaching staff when Ditka joined the Bears, felt that he should have been promoted into the head-coaching position. Although the two men continued to work together, the relationship continued to deteriorate. With the Bears trailing by three touchdowns in a late-season Monday night game against the Miami Dolphins, the team&#x27;s only loss, Ryan finally snapped after Ditka, as he recounted in 2006 for NFL Network, told him that the defensive scheme was not working. The two began throwing punches at each other and had to be separated. Ditka said, at that point, the relationship became unsalvageable. In an unusual gesture, following the Bears&#x27; Super Bowl victory, the players carried both Ryan and Ditka off the field. In addition, the 1985 Chicago Bears are one of several teams to consistently challenge the undefeated 1972 Miami Dolphins for the unofficial title of the &quot;Greatest NFL Team of All-Time&quot;. The NFL Network series &quot;America&#x27;s Game&quot; rated the 1985 Bears as the second-best Super Bowl champion, only behind the 1972 Miami Dolphins.

In 1986, Buddy Ryan left Chicago to become head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles. When asked if he was happy Ryan was gone, Ditka replied he was not happy, but &quot;elated&quot;. In 1986, 1987, and 1988, the Bears won the Central Division title and earned three home playoff games. The first of those years saw the Bears finish the regular season with a 14–2 record to tie the eventual Super Bowl champion New York Giants for the best in the entire league. However, the Bears were upset by the Washington Redskins in their first playoff game. The next year, the Bears finished second in the NFC with an 11–4 record, but were again upended by the Washington Redskins en route to that team&#x27;s second Super Bowl victory of the decade. The Bears finished 12–4 in 1988 and got homefield advantage. They defeated Ryan&#x27;s Philadelphia Eagles in the Fog Bowl in their first game, but the team was defeated by the eventual Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship Game. This was the third time in five years that Ditka led the Bears to the NFC Championship Game, and was the last time they advanced this far until 2006.

Ditka suffered a heart attack during the 1988 season, which he attributed to stress since he was in excellent physical condition and had no significant family history of heart disease. However, despite being expected to miss much of the season, Ditka was on the sidelines as an &quot;advisor&quot; the next week and back in full charge the week after. He led the Bears to a 12–4 record and received his second coach of the year award from the AP.

The Bears started 4–0 in 1989, but a series of last-second losses eventually led to a complete meltdown at the end of the season, as the Bears finished 6–10. The Bears rallied to win a weak Central Division in 1990 and make the playoffs as a wild card in 1991, but were eliminated convincingly in the early rounds by the New York Giants (who went on to win Super Bowl XXV) and the Dallas Cowboys, respectively. After dropping to 5–11 in the 1992 season, the Bears fired Ditka on January 5, 1993. His 106 wins are the second-most in Bears history, behind only Halas.

On December 9, 2013, Ditka&#x27;s Bears jersey, number 89, was retired in a halftime ceremony during a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game in Chicago as the Chicago Bears hosted the Dallas Cowboys, for whom Ditka also played and worked as an assistant coach under the late Tom Landry. &quot;Thank you, thank you, thank you, and go Bears!&quot; Ditka told the crowd.

=== New Orleans Saints ===
In 1997, after a four-year absence in which he had served as a television analyst, Ditka returned to the NFL to take over as the permanent replacement for Jim Mora with the New Orleans Saints. Ditka inherited a team that had not made the playoffs, nor had recorded a record above .500, since 1992, and had finished the 1996 season, during which Mora had resigned, tied with the Atlanta Falcons for the second-worst record in the league (only the New York Jets, who only won once, had a worse record).

In Ditka&#x27;s first season back in the league in 1997, he struggled early, as the Saints lost four of their first five games. They did manage to beat his former team, the Chicago Bears, along the way, and recorded five more wins, but after winning only one game in the division (even being swept by the last-place St. Louis Rams), the Saints finished at 6–10.

Ditka&#x27;s team played more inconsistently in 1998, as the Saints started out 3–0, but could not keep the momentum going. Still, they were in playoff contention toward the end of the season, and defeated the eventual NFC East champions in Ditka&#x27;s other former squad, the Dallas Cowboys, to get to 6–7 with three games to go. They dropped their last three, though, and were eliminated in week 16 on a last-second field goal against the Arizona Cardinals.

Then, in the offseason that followed, Ditka was roundly criticized for the trading of all of the team&#x27;s 1999 draft picks (plus their first-round draft pick in 2000) to the Washington Redskins to move up in the draft and select Texas running back Ricky Williams (Washington later used the picks to select future All-Pro and Hall of Famer Champ Bailey, Jon Jansen, and LaVar Arrington). The trade was further mocked because of a magazine cover in which Ditka posed with Williams, who was wearing a wedding dress.

The 1999 season proved to be the worst of Ditka&#x27;s coaching career. After winning the season opener against the Carolina Panthers, the Saints dropped their next seven games, including a loss to the expansion Cleveland Browns. As the season wore on, Ditka&#x27;s frustrations began showing in the local media. After a late-season practice with the team sitting at 2–7, a grumpy Ditka gave a sixty-second press conference where he was very short tempered and dismissive of what he thought were stupid questions. When one of them made it a point to ask him why he was in such a bad mood, Ditka responded by saying &quot;what do you care?&quot;, and then followed up by saying to the reporter &quot;if you were 2-7, you&#x27;d be in a bad mood too.&quot; Ditka would take one more question before muttering to the reporters, &quot;not very much fun, is it?&quot;, then going inside.

The low point of the season came three weeks later in a loss to the Atlanta Falcons, which was the Saints&#x27; 10th in 11 weeks. Ditka came into the postgame press conference appearing emotionally exhausted, and said he felt his charges “broke” him. He then said the Saints would be better off hiring someone else to coach the team, claiming he was the &quot;wrong guy&quot; to lead them and that &quot;[he] didn&#x27;t have it anymore&quot;, saying &quot;God puts people in places for reasons, and he probably put me here to be humbled. I deserve it.&quot;

Ditka said that he did not feel the Saints had much talent on the offensive side of the field, blaming himself for that and saying that he had let the players down by not having them ready. He also cited the Saints’ lack of playmaking ability, as they dropped several passes and failed to take advantage of three Falcons fumbles while turning the ball over seven times themselves. Ditka was asked if he felt the team had quit on him, which he denied; however, when he was asked if he was thinking about leaving immediately he responded affirmatively. However, Ditka also said that he would not do it unless he knew for certain he would be fired before the end of the year. Before leaving the press conference, the defeated Ditka called himself a &quot;hypocrite&quot; and said the entire exercise was &quot;silly&quot;.

After two more losses, Ditka and the Saints faced the 7–7 Dallas Cowboys in their home finale on Christmas Eve. Ditka chose to give the start to Jake Delhomme, his third-string quarterback. In his first NFL start, Delhomme threw for two touchdowns and ran for a third, and Fred Weary took a forced fumble 56 yards for the game-winning score, as the Saints knocked off the Cowboys, 31–24. This proved to be Ditka&#x27;s final victory as a head coach; after a 45–13 loss to the Carolina Panthers the following week left the Saints with a 3–13 record and their seventh consecutive nonwinning season, Ditka and general manager Bill Kuharich were fired on January 6, 2000.

Over a total of 14 seasons as a head coach, Ditka amassed a regular-season record of 121–95 and a postseason record of 6–6.

== Head coaching record ==
==Broadcasting career==
Almost immediately after his dismissal from the Bears in 1993, Ditka took a broadcasting job with NBC, working as an analyst on &quot;NFL Live&quot; and as a color commentator for many other NBC broadcasts. After he was fired by the Saints, Ditka joined CBS Sports, spending the 2000 and 2001 seasons as a studio analyst on &quot;The NFL Today&quot;. He is currently a commentator on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;NFL Live&quot;, ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Sunday NFL Countdown&quot;, and CBS Radio–Westwood One&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; pregame show. On his radio show, Coach Ditka is called &quot;America&#x27;s Coach&quot; by well-known sidekick Jim Gray. Beginning in 2006, Ditka appeared on a Seattle radio program, &quot;Groz with Gas&quot; on 950 KJR-AM Seattle, on Thursday afternoons with Dave Grosby and Mike Gastineau. Ditka regularly appears on Chicago radio station ESPN 1000 (WMVP-AM), often broadcasting on Thursday mornings from one of his eponymous restaurants along with ESPN 1000 mid-morning hosts Marc Silverman and Tom Waddle, a former Bears player under Ditka.

Ditka served as color commentator for ESPN&#x27;s September 10, 2007, broadcast of &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, alongside Mike Greenberg and Mike Golic. He replicated this role on the second game of the doubleheader in 2008, as well. Ditka spent several years with ESPN working on &quot;Sunday NFL Countdown&quot;. In March 2016, ESPN and Ditka announced he would move to &quot;SportsCenter&quot; for remote-broadcasting analysis, as Ditka disliked the long distance from his home to the studio. This new role allows him to stay at home, while still maintaining an analyst role with the network.

==Other ventures==

Ditka has written or contributed to a number of books since 1986. He wrote &quot;Ditka: An Autobiography&quot; with friend and sports journalist Don Pierson; he authored &quot;The 85 Bears: We Were the Greatest&quot; with Rick Telander. He also wrote with Telander &quot;In Life First you Kick Ass: Reflections on the 1985 Bears and Wisdom from Da Coach&quot;.

Ditka has also been the subject of several books including &quot;Ditka: Monster of the Midway&quot; by Armen Keteyian and &quot;Ditka: The Player, the Coach, the Chicago Bears Legend&quot; which is a compilation of Chicago Tribune stories written about Ditka throughout the years. He is also a large topic in books written about the Bears as a team such as &quot;Then Ditka said to Payton&quot; and &quot;Monsters: The 1985 Chicago Bears and the Wild Heart of Football&quot;.

In 1987, following the success of the Chicago Bears&#x27; charity single &quot;The Super Bowl Shuffle&quot;, the video&#x27;s producer Richard E. Meyer created a similar music video starring Ditka, titled &quot;The Grabowski Shuffle.&quot; The video, about &quot;working hard to get what you want&quot;, was inspired by a comment Ditka had made about his team&#x27;s reputation: &quot;There are Smiths and there are Grabowskis; we&#x27;re the Grabowskis.&quot;

In 1991, Ditka cooperated with Accolade to produce the computer game &quot;Mike Ditka Ultimate Football&quot; and the Sega Mega Drive game &quot;Mike Ditka Power Football&quot;. In 1995, Ditka starred as a football coach in a full-motion video game called &quot;Quarterback Attack with Mike Ditka&quot;, released for the Sega Saturn, PC, and 3DO. &quot;Quarterback Attack&quot; was re-released for iTunes and Google Play in December 2016.

In 1993, Ditka appeared as himself in the 271st and final episode of the American television sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot;. Ditka also appeared as himself in the show &quot;According to Jim&quot;, in the 2002 episode &quot;Cars &amp; Chicks&quot;. Ditka has made guest appearances and cameos on several other shows, including &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and &quot;3rd Rock from the Sun&quot;. In 2005, Ditka had a major role in the comedy &quot;Kicking &amp; Screaming&quot;, playing himself; he was recruited by Will Ferrell&#x27;s character to be an assistant little league soccer coach.

Ditka appeared in several ads for Montgomery Ward in the early 1990s, promoting their electronics and appliances department, known as &quot;Electric Avenue&quot;. Ditka also starred in ad for &#x27;Big Shot&#x27; soda in 1997.

Ditka performed &quot;Take Me Out to the Ballgame&quot; during a Chicago Cubs game at Wrigley Field in 1998, the first season after the death of Harry Caray, who had previously led the song. &quot;Chicago Now&quot; blogger Marcus Leshock derided the performance, dubbing Ditka &quot;the worst 7th-inning singer in history.&quot;

Ditka was inducted to the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame in 2001.

In January 2007, Ditka used the Super Bowl return of the Chicago Bears as a platform to promote efforts by many early NFL players trying to raise support for former NFL players in need of money and medical assistance; he is a key member in the Gridiron Greats. Angry at the wealthy NFL for ignoring the players who helped to create the league, Ditka and other former players have since been attempting to raise funds, in the words of Hall of Famer Joe DeLamielleure, &quot;for guys who made this league and built it on their backs, their knees, their legs and now they&#x27;re all broken down and they can&#x27;t even get a decent pension.&quot; Ultimately, however, in December 2007, Ditka folded his &quot;Hall of Fame Assistance Trust Fund&quot; charity amidst revelations that, &quot;in 2005, the group gave out more money to pay celebrities to play golf than the group in its entire three years of operation gave out to injured players&quot;, according to Laurie Styron of the American Institute of Philanthropy. During Super Bowl XLIV, Ditka (who was not in the original group) joined other members of the 1985 Chicago Bears in resurrecting &quot;The Super Bowl Shuffle&quot; in a Boost Mobile commercial.

In the spring of 2007, Ditka worked alongside X Management and Geneva Hospitality to form Mike Ditka Resorts, currently consisting of two resorts in the Orlando, Florida, area. Ditka owns a chain of restaurants, &quot;Ditka&#x27;s&quot;, which has three locations in Illinois and one in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Ditka discovered singer John Vincent, who has been performing at his Chicago restaurant since 2001. Vincent performs in 20 different voices and sings the National Anthem regularly for the NFL, NBA, and MLB. Ditka and Vincent also own a record label together.

Ditka was a co-owner the Chicago Rush, an Arena Football League team. In August 2011, media reports noted that Ditka would be a financial investor for the new Elite Football League of India, a proposed American football league that will be India&#x27;s first.

In 2012, Ditka partnered with Terlato Wines to produce his own collection of wines, produced in California. The partnership stemmed from a 20-year friendship between Ditka and Bill Terlato and their shared love of sports and food and wine. The first Mike Ditka Wines were released in fall 2012, including eight labels highlighting his career: &quot;The Player&quot; (2011 Pinot Grigio and 2010 Merlot), &quot;The Coach&quot; (2011 Sauvignon Blanc and 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon), &quot; The Hall of Famer&quot; (2011 Chardonnay and 2011 Pinot Noir), and &quot;The Restaurateur&quot; pair which includes &quot;The Icon&quot; (2010 Cabernet Sauvignon) and &quot;The Champion&quot; (2010 Red Blend).&quot; The same year, Ditka and Camacho Cigars partnered and produced a line of cigars called &quot;The Mike Ditka Kickoff Series&quot;. These cigars are named to highlight the milestones of Coach Ditka&#x27;s football career: &quot;The Player&quot;, The Coach&quot;, and &quot;The Hall of Famer&quot;. All of these cigars are produced in Honduras.

In 2013, Ditka and Vienna Beef partnered to create Ditka Sausages, which will be eight inches long and one-third pound in weight. The two types are &quot;Hot Beef Polish Sausage&quot; and &quot;Chicken Sausage with Mozzarella and Sun-Dried Tomatoes&quot;.

Also in 2013, Ditka and former Bears quarterback Jim McMahon are featured in a new series of commercials for the online discount retailer Overstock.com.

In 2014, Ditka and Resultly partnered to feature his profile and product collections. Ditka&#x27;s profile is featured on Resultly and he regularly interacts with users about the collections he creates of his favorite items from all over the web.

In 2015, Ditka did several television ads for McDonald&#x27;s. He was seen wearing a Green Bay Packers sweater vest. Some would later question if Ditka &quot;jinxed&quot; the Packers, as their six-game undefeated streak halted to a three-game losing streak during the airing of the commercials (including a loss to the Bears on Thanksgiving, which was part of a three-game winning streak they were enjoying at the time). A follow-up commercial would show Ditka throwing the Packers sweater vest out the window and donning his more familiar Bears sweater vest once the contest was over. Just hours after the spot was aired, the Packers went on to beat the Vikings, ending the &quot;curse&quot;.

==Personal life==
Ditka was married to his first wife, Marge, from 1961 to 1973. They had four children together: Mark, Matt, Mike and Megan. He married his current wife Diane (née Trantham) Ditka in 1977.

During the 1985 season, he was arrested on Interstate 294 near O&#x27;Hare International Airport and later convicted of DUI after returning from a game against the San Francisco 49ers.

In the midst of a successful 1988 season, he suffered a heart attack, but bounced back quickly. In November 2012, he suffered a minor stroke at a suburban country club in Chicago. Later in the day, Ditka reported he was feeling &quot;good right now and it&#x27;s not a big deal.&quot;

From 1989 until 1997, Ditka lived in Bannockburn, Illinois.

From 1997 until 2001, Ditka lived in an area of New Orleans known as English Turn.

He is a practicing Roman Catholic and a member of the Knights of Columbus.

On November 23, 2018, Ditka was hospitalized in Naples, Florida, after suffering a heart attack while playing golf.

===Political views===
Ditka is known for his vocal conservative views. In July 2004, Ditka, a self-described &quot;ultra-ultra-ultra conservative&quot;, was reportedly considering running against the Democratic candidate, state senator Barack Obama, for an open seat in the U.S. Senate for Illinois in the 2004 Senate election. The seat was being vacated by the retiring Peter Fitzgerald, a Republican, and Republican nominee Jack Ryan withdrew from the race amid controversy at the end of June, leaving the Republicans in a bind. Local and national political leaders, from Illinois Republican Party Chair Judy Baar Topinka to National Republican Senatorial Committee Chair George Allen, whose father by the same name was an assistant coach with the Bears in the 1960s when Ditka played, met with Ditka in an effort to persuade him to fill the spot on the ticket. On July 14, however, Ditka announced he would not seek the nomination, citing personal and business considerations. His wife was against the run and he operates a chain of restaurants. Obama went on to defeat the eventual Republican candidate, former U.S. ambassador Alan Keyes, in a landslide in the November 2004 election. Ditka has since regretted not running. Ditka believes that Obama never would have been elected president if Ditka had run against Obama for Senate in 2004, and claims that Obama is the worst president in United States history.

In stark contrast to the above-stated positions, Ditka appeared in an ad during the 2010 Illinois gubernatorial election for incumbent Democratic governor Pat Quinn. In the ad, Ditka stated that, &quot;[D]oing the right thing for the people who put you in office is more important than what you can do for yourself in office ... and I think he&#x27;ll do that. I think he understands that ... and I think he&#x27;s good people.&quot; Quinn, at the time, was locked into a tight race against State Senator Bill Brady, a conservative Republican from Bloomington. Quinn would go on to narrowly defeat Brady. Four years later, in 2014, Ditka appeared in a televised campaign ad for Quinn&#x27;s Republican challenger, Bruce Rauner, who defeated Quinn in the general election.

In October 2011, Ditka and the 1985 team went to the White House after they did not attend in 1986 due to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. He presented President Obama with a Chicago Bears jersey with the number 85 on it with &quot;Obama&quot; on the back of it.

Ditka was a vocal supporter of Donald Trump&#x27;s election campaign, saying &quot;I support Trump all the way. I really do.&quot;

Some of Ditka&#x27;s comments, most notably regarding former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick&#x27;s national anthem protests, have garnered interest due to Ditka&#x27;s position with ESPN. Under the network&#x27;s new social media policy (implemented in late 2017 in the wake of Curt Schilling&#x27;s firing and Jemele Hill&#x27;s suspension), Ditka is to refrain from making controversial statements, but made a series of remarks in late 2017 that drew widespread criticism. In a September interview with a Dallas-based radio station, Ditka was critical of Kaepernick&#x27;s protests, saying &quot;I think it&#x27;s a problem. Anybody who disrespects this country and the flag. If they don&#x27;t like the country they don&#x27;t like our flag, get the hell out.&quot; In the same interview, Ditka was dismissive of social issues in America, saying &quot;I don&#x27;t see all the atrocities going on in this country that people say are going on, I see opportunities if people want to look for opportunity – now if they don&#x27;t want to look for them – then you can find problems with anything, but this is the land of opportunity because you can be anything you want to be if you work. If you don&#x27;t work, that&#x27;s a different problem.&quot;

In October 2018, during a Bears/Vikings pregame show, Ditka said he did not believe that there was any oppression in America for the last 100 years: &quot;There has been no oppression in the last 100 years that I know of. Now maybe I&#x27;m not watching it as carefully as other people.&quot; Ditka was criticized for his comments, including by former New York Jets quarterback Joe Namath, who said, &quot;Look up the definition of oppression, and you understand that it&#x27;s obviously taken place,&quot; as well as by &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; columnists who said Ditka was &quot;not a Chicagoan&quot; and &quot;a white man who is blind to the plight of people of color in this country.&quot; The NFL permitted Ditka&#x27;s comments, but hedged, &quot;Everyone&#x27;s entitled to an opinion. The league would not express that opinion, by any stretch of the imagination.&quot; Ditka quickly clarified his remarks in a release, apologizing to anyone who may have been offended by his comments: &quot;The characterization of the statement that I made does not reflect the context of the question that I was answering and certainly does not reflect my views throughout my lifetime. I have absolutely seen oppression in society in the last 100 years and I am completely intolerant of any discrimination.&quot;

Before digital recording became practical, instruments such as the Welte (1930s), phonogene (1950s) and the Mellotron (1960s) used analog optical disks or analog tape decks to play back sampled sounds.

When sample-based synthesis was first developed, most affordable consumer synthesizers could not record arbitrary samples, but instead formed timbres by combining pre-recorded samples from ROM before routing the result through analog or digital filters. These synthesizers and their more complex descendants are often referred to as ROMplers.

Sample-based instruments have been used since the Computer Music Melodian, the Fairlight CMI and the NED Synclavier. These instruments were way ahead of their time and were correspondingly expensive. The first recording using a sampling synthesizer was &quot;Stevie Wonder&#x27;s Journey Through &quot;The Secret Life of Plants&quot;&quot; (1979) which used the Computer Music Melodian to create complex melodies and rhythms from sampled sounds from nature. The first tune Wonder recorded was &quot;The First Garden&quot; where he used a sampled bird chirp as the lead sound in the song. More affordable sample-based synthesizers available for the masses with the introduction of the Ensoniq Mirage (1984), Roland D-50 (1987) and the Korg M1 (1988), which surfaced in the late eighties. The M1 also introduced the &quot;music workstation&quot; concept.

The concept has made it into sound cards for the multimedia PC, under the names such as &quot;wavetable card&quot; or &quot;wavetable daughterboard&quot;. (See Wavetable synthesis#Background)

==Advantages==
The principal advantage of sample-based synthesis over other methods of digital synthesis such as physical modelling synthesis or additive synthesis is that processing power requirements are much lower. This is because most of the nuances of the sound models are contained in the prerecorded samples rather than calculated in realtime.

In a contrast to analog synthesizers, the circuitry does not have to be duplicated to allow more voices to be played at once. Therefore the polyphony of sample-based machines is generally a lot higher. A downside is, however, that in order to include more detail, multiple samples might need to be played back at once (a trumpet might include a breath noise, a growl, and a looping soundwave used for continuous play). This reduces the polyphony again, as sample-based synthesizers rate their polyphony based on the number of multi-samples that can be played back simultaneously.

==Multisampling==
A sample-based synthesizer&#x27;s ability to reproduce the nuances of natural instruments is determined primarily by its library of sampled sounds. In the earlier days of sample-based synthesis, computer memory was expensive and samples had to be as short and as few as possible. This was achieved by looping a part of the sample (often a single wave), and then using a volume envelope curve to make the sound fade away. An amplifying stage would translate key velocity into gain so that harder playing would translate into louder playback. In some cases key velocity also modulates the attack time of the instrument, leading to a faster attack for loud passages.

As memory became cheaper, it became possible to use multisampling; instead of a single recording of an instrument being played back faster or slower to reproduce other pitches, the original instrument could be sampled at regular intervals to cover regions of several adjacent notes (&quot;splits&quot;) or for every note. This provides a more natural progression from the lower to the higher registers; lower notes don&#x27;t sound dull, and higher notes don&#x27;t sound unnaturally bright. It is also possible to sample the same note at several different levels of intensity, reflecting the fact that both volume and timbre change with playing style. For instance, when sampling a piano, 3 samples per key can be made; soft, medium and with force. Every possible volume in between can be made by amplifying and blending the samples.

For sample-based models of instruments like the Rhodes piano, this multisampling is very important. The timbre of the Rhodes changes drastically from left to right on the keyboard, and it varies greatly depending on the force with which the key is struck. The lower registers &quot;bark&quot;, while the higher range has a more bell-like sound. The bark will be more distinct if the keys are struck with force. For the model to be sufficiently expressive, it is therefore necessary that multisamples be made across both pitch and force of playing.

==Sampling synthesizers==
A more flexible sample-based synthesis design allowing the user to record arbitrary waveforms to form a sound&#x27;s basic timbre is called a sampler. Early samplers were very expensive, and typically had low sample rates and bit depth, resulting in grainy and aliased sound. Since the late-1980s, however, samplers have featured specifications at least as good as CDs. By the late 1990s, the huge increases in computer processor speed permitted the widespread development of software synthesizers and software samplers. The vast storage capacity of modern computers was ideally suited to sample-based synthesis, and many samplers have thus migrated to software implementations or been superseded by new software samplers.
