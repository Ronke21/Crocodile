<text>An underground city is a series of linked subterranean spaces that may provide a defensive refuge; a place for living, working or shopping; a transit system; mausolea; wine or storage cellars; cisterns or drainage channels; or several of these. Underground cities may be currently active modern creations or they may be historic including ancient sites, some of which may be entirely or partially open to the public.

The term may also refer to a network of tunnels that connects buildings beneath street level that may house office blocks, shopping centres, metro stations, theatres, and other attractions. These passages can usually be accessed through the public space of any of the buildings connecting to them, and sometimes have separate entries as well. This latter definition encompasses many modern structures, whereas the former more generally covers tunnel systems from ancient times to the present day.

Underground cities are especially functional in cities with very cold or hot climates, because they permit activities to be comfortably accessible year round without regard to the weather. Underground cities are similar in nature to skyway systems and may include some buildings linked by skyways or above-ground corridors rather than underground.
Some cities also have tunnels that have been abandoned.

*Houston, Texas: the seven-mile (11 km) Houston tunnel system is set about twenty feet below Houston&#x27;s downtown street system and is composed of underground passageways which, with above-ground skywalks, link office towers to hotels, banks, corporate and government offices, restaurants, retail stores, and the Houston Theater District. Only one building, Wells Fargo Plaza, offers direct access from the street to the Tunnel; otherwise, the Tunnel can only be entered via street-level stairs, escalators, or elevators inside a building connected to it.
*Irvine, California: a network of large tunnels running beneath the University of California, Irvine connects many of the campus&#x27; major buildings to a central utility plant. These tunnels are only accessible to maintenance staff, although there are also publicly accessible tunnels which intersect the utility tunnels, such as the one that goes between the main Information &amp; Computer Science building and the Engineering Tower.
*Kansas City, Missouri: the city&#x27;s SubTropolis is a 55,000,000 square foot (5,060,000 m³), 1,100-acre (4.5 km²) underground business complex running along the Missouri River. The space was originally part of the Bethany Falls limestone mine, and was later repurposed for use as a commercial underground storage facility.
*Minneapolis and Saint Paul, Minnesota: there are three major systems consisting mostly of above-ground skyways in the Twin Cities. The Minneapolis Skyway System covers approximately 11 miles with 62 skyways. St. Paul&#x27;s skyway system connects buildings in a 30-block radius in the downtown core. On the University of Minnesota Minneapolis and St Paul campuses, the Gopher Way connects most buildings and parking structures together using a number of skyway links and tunnels. A system of tunnels connects state office buildings around the Minnesota State Capitol. A series of tunnels also connect the Hennepin County Government Center, Minneapolis City Hall, and the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota.
*New York City, New York: several New York City Subway stations have direct access to one or more buildings. Additionally, most of the lower floor of the Rockefeller Center qualifies as an underground city, as it features connections to subways, an extensive underground concourse, building connections, and several restaurants, all below ground. The area around Times Square and the Port Authority Bus Terminal forms an underground network several blocks in size; much of it is within the New York City Subway&#x27;s fare control. A series of tunnels connect Brookfield Place (New York City) through the World Trade Center&#x27;s lower levels, to the Fulton Center, forming an underground city with several subway stations and many shops and restaurants.
*Oklahoma City, Oklahoma: the Oklahoma City Underground (formerly the Oklahoma City Conncourse) is a tunnel system connecting nearly all of the downtown buildings in a 20-square-block area. It is one of the most extensive all-enclosed pedestrian systems in the U.S., extending three-quarters of a mile and connecting over 30 downtown buildings via tunnels or skyways. The original tunnel link was built in 1931 and the system was extended in the 1970s. It underwent a $2 million renovation in 2006–2007, after which the Conncourse was renamed the Underground.
*Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: Center City has several miles of interconnected underground concourses under Market, Broad, and Locust Streets, and JFK Boulevard. The system includes nine rapid transit and regional rail stations served by 23 SEPTA and PATCO lines, and the lower levels of several shopping centers. It is also connected to the lower levels of many office buildings and several department stores and hotels, as well as the customer service counters of the Municipal Services Building. A branch of the US Post Office is located in the Suburban Station section of the concourse.
*Portland, Oregon: there is a group of connected tunnels from the 19th century known as the Old Portland Underground or Shanghai tunnels.
*Richmond, Virginia: there are a series of connected tunnels between state government buildings in the city of Richmond. Certain passageways are locked off but a good portion of the tunnels are accessible from buildings. The purpose of the tunnels is not generally known; the two most common explanations are that they were built to allow people to move between buildings in inclement weather or that they were built as part of an emergency evacuation plan.
*Rochester, Minnesota: the Mayo Clinic&#x27;s buildings in the downtown area are interconnected with tunnels and skyways. Other businesses are along the corridors, including a number of hotels that often house clinic patients. It is often called a subway, although there are no underground rails in the city.
*Rochester, New York: Nazareth College in the southeast portion of Rochester has an extensive underground network of tunnels leading from the dormitories to the major buildings on campus. Rochester Institute of Technology has two tunnel networks linking its residence halls, and its academic buildings, but the two networks are unconnected. The University of Rochester has an underground network connecting many of its academic buildings.
*Seattle, Washington: several modern undergrounds and a historical tour exist. The Westlake Center shopping mall and its surrounding department stores have underground entrances to the mezzanine level of the Westlake light rail station in the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel. Another substantial corridor extends from Two Union Square to Rainier Square, with connections to hotels, the 5th Avenue Theatre, and many retail shops along the way. The Seattle Underground Tour in Pioneer Square takes visitors on a humorous guided walk showing the original ground level of many buildings in that area.

*Vicksburg, Mississippi: during the Siege of Vicksburg in 1863, Union gunboats lobbed over 22,000 shells into the town, destroying nearly all of the town&#x27;s housing. As a result, over 500 caves were dug into the clay hills surrounding Vicksburg. The Union soldiers later gave the town the nickname of &quot;Prairie Dog Village&quot; due to these caves.
*Walt Disney World, Florida (southwest of Orlando, Florida) has a network of utility tunnels (the Disney utilidor system) used by its employees for transportation between venues, rest areas, staff preparation, and first aid. The main system is under the Magic Kingdom theme park. Other tunnels lie underneath Future World at Epcot.
*Washington D.C.: all of the buildings in the United States Capitol Complex are connected by tunnels and underground walkways, which provide easy passage between legislative office buildings, the Capitol, the Capitol Visitor Center, and the Library of Congress in inclement weather. The tunnels connecting office buildings are open to the public, but those connecting to the Capitol require security clearance to use. Small electric tramways run from the Capitol building to the Russell, Dirksen, and Hart Senate Office Buildings and to the Rayburn House Office Building. The tunnel between the Capitol and the Cannon House Office Building displays winning pieces of artwork from the annual Congressional Art Competition for high school students.
*Wellesley, Massachusetts: there is an underground network connecting several buildings at Wellesley College.

=== Mexico ===
* Guanajuato city was built over old silver mines, some of which are used as roads. The Mexico DF metro system has many underground pedestrian walkways connecting stations.

== South America ==

=== Argentina ===
Buenos Aires, capital of Argentina, has an extensive number of underground cities in its Subte. Most stations have small shops, bars and kiosks, while main hubs interconnect through underground pedestrian walkways with railroad stations, governmental buildings, or shopping centres. Some have additional mall-like mezzanine levels, with the Centro Obelisk of Buenos Aires area (three lines, four underground levels), Estación Retiro, Estación Constitución, Estación Once, and Federico Lacroze railway station being the most important ones.

=== Chile ===
Santiago has some elements of an underground city in its &quot;Metro&quot; subway system. While all stations have a small mezzanine level above the tracks for ticket purchase, some key stations have extensive areas of shops and kiosks in addition. Some stations even have an additional mall-like level between the street and the mezzanine levels.

<doc id="303841" wikidata="Q39357" url="?curid=303841" title="Shih Tzu">
<text>The Shih Tzu (, ) is a toy dog or pet dog breed originating from Tibet and believed to be bred from the Pekingese and the Lhasa Apso.

== Description ==
The Shih Tzu is a sturdy little dog with a small snout and normally has large dark brown eyes. The Chinese have described their head shapes as &quot;owl head&quot; and &quot;lion head&quot;, and their mouth as &quot;frog mouths&quot; and their lips as &quot;earthworm lips&quot;. They have a soft and long double coat that will tangle and mat easily if not brushed at least every 2 or 3 days. A Shih Tzu should stand no more than 26.7 cm (10&quot;) at the withers and with an ideal weight of 4.0 to 7.5kg (9 to 17 lbs). Their floppy ears are covered with long hair, and their heavily hair-covered tail is carried curled over the back. The coat may be of any color, though white and with blazes of grey are frequently seen. A very noticeable feature is the underbite, which is required in the breed standard.

== Etymology ==

The name comes from the Chinese language word for &quot;lion&quot; because this kind of dog was bred to resemble &quot;the lion, as in traditional oriental art&quot;. (The Pekingese breed is also called &quot;lion dog&quot; in Chinese.) The name &quot;Shih Tzu&quot; is the Wade-Giles romanization of the Mandarin Chinese word for &quot;lion&quot;.

In contemporary Mandarin, the Shih Tzu is generally known as the &quot;Xi Shi dog&quot;; Xi Shi was regarded as one of the most beautiful women of ancient China. Shih Tzu was nicknamed the &quot;chrysanthemum dog&quot; in England in the 1930s. The dog may also be called the Tibetan Lion Dog, but whether the breed should be referred to as &quot;Tibetan&quot; or &quot;Chinese&quot; is a source of both historical and political contention, and dog historians tend to have very strong opinions on the subject.

== History ==
One theory is that the Shih Tzu descended from a cross between the Pekingese and Lhasa Apso.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark/Brace&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The dogs were favorites of the Chinese royals during the Ming Dynasty and were so prized that, for years, the Chinese refused to sell, trade, or give any away. The Dowager Empress Cixi developed a program dedicated to breeding Shih Tzus. Many court eunuchs also bred Shih Tzus to win favor with the Emperor.

The first dogs of the breed were imported into Europe (England and Norway) during the 1920s and 1930s. Lady Brownrigg, an Englishwoman living in China, first brought two Shih Tzus to England in 1928. These dogs were classified by the Kennel Club as &quot;Apsos&quot;. The first European standard for the breed was written in England in 1935 by the Shih Tzu Club, and the dogs were categorised again as Shih Tzu. This was the result of the first congregation of these dogs from China at Crufts in 1933 at which it was realised that the Tibetan Terrier, Apso and Shih Tzu were distinctly different breeds. The breed spread throughout Europe and was brought to the United States after World War II, when returning members of the U.S. military brought back dogs from Europe and Asia, in the mid-1950s. The Shih Tzu was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1969 in the Toy Group.

In 1934, the Shih Tzu Club of England was founded and the breed was officially recognised by the Kennel Club (UK) on 7 May 1940. When it became eligible for Challenge Certificates, none were awarded until 1949. The breed is now recognized by all of the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world. It is also recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale for international competition in Companion and Toy Dog Group, Section 5, Tibetan breeds.

During the Chinese Communist Revolution in 1949, all Shih Tzus were killed off due to their association with wealth. As such, the modern Shih Tzu is descended from thirteen dogs imported to England and Scandinavia between 1928 and 1952. Controversially, breeder Freda Evans of England introduced a black and white Pekingese into the breed in 1952. Today, both the U.K. and U.S. Kennel Clubs recognize the descendants of the Shih Tzu and Pekingese cross as purebred Shih Tzus.

In the United States, the Shih Tzus were ranked the 15th most popular breed in 2013, falling slightly in popularity since 2012 when it was placed in 11th position. In Israel the Shih Tzus were ranked as the most popular breed in 2019.

== In Buddhist mythology ==
Shih Tzus are largely associated with Buddhism and Buddhist mythology. The name &quot;Shih Tzu&quot; in Mandarin directly translates to &quot;little lion,&quot; an animal considered sacred in Buddhist religion. Lions symbolize royalty, strength, and bravery – &quot;fear nothing, and act without delay.&quot; Pairs of stone lions or lion dogs located outside guard palace doors, tombs, temples, and public buildings are thought to protect these buildings from harmful individuals and spiritual influences. These stone statues are often called Fu (or Foo) dogs, and it is suggested that these are the lionized form of the Shih Tzu. &quot;Fu&quot; roughly translates to &quot;happiness&quot; in Manchurian, with legend stating Fu dogs are happy Shih Tzus forever guarding the temple of Buddha. Fu dog statues typically represent a male and female Shih Tzu, carved out of stone, jade, teak, ivory, cinnabar, bronze, or ceramics. The male dog is often seen holding a ball with his left paw and the female dog holds her puppy. Sources state this holds a symbolic meaning, with the male dog representing powers over nature, energy, wisdom, and precious stones and the female dog symbolizing protection, play, and a disciplinary attitude.

Buddhists consider Shih Tzus blessed by and sacred beasts of Buddha. Legend states Buddha rode to earth on a lion and carried with him a small lion dog which accompanied him everywhere he went. Legends vary across different sources, however many cite the Shih Tzu accompanied the Buddha of wisdom, Manjushri. This lion dog had the ability to turn himself into a lion to carry Manjushri on his back. The physical features of Shih Tzus serve as proof of the eternal connection between Buddha and this breed. According to legend, several robbers surrounded Buddha with the intention of robbing and murdering him when the Shih Tzu transformed into a ferocious lion so large that the robbers were scared and fled the scene. As the Shih Tzu returned to its dog form, Buddha blessed him for his courage. Many Shih Tzus reflect this blessing in the form of the &quot;Star of Buddha&quot;, which may also be called &quot;Buddha&#x27;s kiss&quot;, represented as a white patch of hair on the top of dog&#x27;s head. Markings on the dogs back is said to be the saddle Buddha used to ride the dog in its lion form. Legends vary across sources, largely because legends are historically passed down by word-of-mouth. Some cite this mark on the head as the place where Buddha kissed the dog, giving it his blessing. Other sources state Buddha laid his finger on the dog&#x27;s forehead in blessing, giving it a flash of white hair on its forehead.

== Coat colors ==
The Shih Tzu comes in many colours. The following colours are recognised by The Royal Kennel Club: 
Additionally the following colours are recognised as existing within the breed but not being part of the standard: blue, cream, lilac, lilac &amp; white, white, particolour.

== Health ==
A number of health issues, some of them hereditary, have been found in individual Shih Tzu, and are listed below. The popularity of the breed has allowed for extremely poor breeding in general, leading to generalized and lifelong diseases, often from a fairly early age.

===Heart disease===
Mitral valve disease is the most common heart disease in dogs and can lead to congestive heart failure (CHF). The condition is more common in smaller dogs including the Shih Tzu.

=== Brachycephaly ===

The short nose of the Shih Tzu causes breathing difficulties and other health issues in the dog. Brachycephalic airway obstruction syndrome (BAOS) is a condition caused by brachycephaly. The main issues arising from the shortened muzzle are stenotic nares, where the nostrils are close together causing difficulties with breathing through the nose; an elongated soft palate; and tracheal hypoplasia, a narrow windpipe. This causes difficulty breathing which leads to increased respiratory effort which further narrows the trachea which can lead to laryngeal collapse. Dogs suffering from BAOS struggle with exercise, are prone to heat stroke due to ineffective evaporative ability, and have trouble sleeping.

=== Eye issues ===
It is very common for Shih Tzus to develop eye problems at any age, and even more so once they are older. Most veterinarians will recommend eye drops to assist with any eye irritations. Some dogs have allergies which cause excess discharge around the eye. Older Shih Tzu are known to develop cataracts which can be corrected with surgery. If not treated, the dog may become blind in the eye that has the cataract. The distinctive large eyes can easily be scratched which may cause an ulcer. The dog will normally have the injured eye closed or half closed and may have excessive tears. The most common problem of Shih Tzus concerning eye conditions is the formation of epiphora caused by the fur on the eyelids scratching the conjunctiva and the cornea. However this can be medicated by the application of prescribed eye drops from a certified veterinarian such as eyevita. Shih Tzus are also prone to excessive tear production which in turn cause tear stains around the eyes. A study from Japan reviewing cases of dogs presented for ophthalmologic examination found the Shih Tzu to make up 16% of all glaucoma cases whilst only making up 8.2% of the total population used in the study.

=== Ear issues ===
A very common issue for Shih Tzus is the development of ear infections, as they have a long coat and hair grows in their ears. If ears are not plucked and cleaned often, ear infections will reoccur and cause more serious health issues.

===Hepatobiliary===
A UK study found the Shih Tzu to have a 4.02 times greater risk of impaired hepatic perfusion compared to other dogs.

=== Life expectancy ===
A 2022 study in the United Kingdom found the life expectancy of the Shih Tzu to be 11 years, a few months below the average life expectancy of all dogs. A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 12.8 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds. A Japanese study found the Shih Tzu to have a life expectancy of 15 years, above the 14 year average for all dogs.

== Variations ==
=== Kennel club differences ===
There is a difference between the Shih Tzu of the American Kennel Club and the Kennel Club (UK). 

==== The AKC (American Kennel Club) Shih-Tzu ====

<text>Welshpool Football Club () is a football club based in Welshpool, playing in the .

The club was founded as Welshpool Football Club on 28 August 1877 following a meeting at the National Schoolroom. They play at the Maes y Dre Recreation Ground, Welshpool, playing in the Ardal Leagues North East.

== History ==
Welshpool Town was formed on 28 August 1877 but adopted such colourful names as Welshpool Wanderers and Welshpool Warriors – although the latter may have been a separate club. The club reformed as Welshpool Powysland FC in September 1889 after one season as Welshpool United and briefly flirted with the Shropshire League. Following the 1889 reformation he club colours were chosen as pink and slate. 
After the First World War Welshpool competed in the Central Wales leagues winning the Central Section in 1921. Four years later in 1925 the club stepped up to the First Division (North) after finishing as runners up to Llanidloes Town.

After the Second World War Welshpool moved to the Welsh National League (Wrexham area). Success followed including Welsh National League Champions: 1955, 1956, 1962 and 1965. The club then returned to the Mid Wales League which it won seven times between 1968 and 1980, as well as winning the Welsh Amateur Cup in 1972. The club continued to be a force in Mid Wales football throughout the 1970s and 1980s which led to their application to apply as founder members of the Cymru Alliance in 1990. They finished second in 1993 and 1996 and as champions Oswestry Town were not eligible for promotion, Welshpool took their place in the League of Wales in the 1996–97 season instead, finishing 17th.

Next season they were relegated and stayed in the Alliance until winning the competition in 2002. In the 2002–03 season they finished next to bottom, but appealed against relegation to the FAW, because Neath were denied promotion as they failed to meet Welsh Premier ground criteria. To the surprise of many, they were reinstated in the League for 2003–04.

In the 2005–06 season, the club finished 6th in the Welsh Premier League, their highest finish in the league to date.

==Successive relegations==

Due to the Welsh Premier League restructure, the club lost their place in the top flight after not applying for a domestic licence. Life in the Cymru Alliance got off to a disastrous start as, after picking up just 4 points from their first six games, they were deducted 15 points for fielding ineligible players.

Manager Graham Evans resigned shortly afterwards, three months into the job, citing a breakdown in relations with the chairman. Head Coach Benji Evans took charge as caretaker Manager, before the arrival of Guilsfield boss, Mike Barton, took over the reins. However, just a month into his reign, he too quit the club. A further three points were deducted for the club failing to fulfil the fixture at Penrhyncoch. Benji Evans again took charge in a Caretaker capacity before the club recruited Connah&#x27;s Quay striker Chris Herbert moved to the club for his first job in management, as player manager. Over the remaining months of the season, Herbert and Evans completely restructured the playing squad, bringing in various quality and experienced players and results improved dramatically. Their efforts weren&#x27;t good enough to prevent the club&#x27;s second successive relegation, and the massive points deficit was too great, but they did get back into positive points before the end of the season. However, on the final day of the season, away at Rhyl FC, a suspended John Keegan appeared in the starting line-up and the club forfeited another three points, ending the campaign rock bottom on zero points.

==Fighting Back==

In the summer of 2011, the club&#x27;s sponsorship agreement with Technogroup ended and the side reverted to the name of Welshpool Football Club. Due to the impact this had on the finances, the club opted to become fully amateur and manager, Chris Herbert, took up the position of Assistant Manager of Rhyl FC.

The club appointed Reserve Manager, Adam Knight, to the position of Manager following his side&#x27;s success in the Montgomeryshire Amateur League Division 2. The club&#x27;s existence was thrown into jeopardy when Knight resigned two weeks before the season and the club had no registered players. However, the Spar Mid Wales League agreed to postpone the club&#x27;s opening three fixtures to allow time for a new manager to be appointed. Local players David Jones and Neil Breeze took control of the side and pulled together a team in time for the opening match with title favourites Montgomery Town FC.

Following Welshpool&#x27;s 10–1 defeat to local rivals Waterloo Rovers on Boxing Day 2011, Sky Sports presenter Jeff Stelling made a joke at the club&#x27;s expense on &quot;Soccer Saturday&quot;. Manager David Jones then wrote to the programme explaining the club&#x27;s plight and that the heavy scoreline was largely the result of him having to spend the second half as a stand-in goalkeeper. The letter was read live on air by Stelling, and &quot;Soccer Saturday&quot; reporter and ex-professional player Chris Kamara then offered to turn out for the club to aid their fight against relegation.

Kamara made his debut on 28 January 2012, but could not prevent a 6–1 home defeat to Rhayader Town, though he did provide the corner that led to Welshpool&#x27;s goal early in the second half with the score at 2–0.

Because of transfer rules, Kamara was signed to the club until the end of the 2011–12 season, and played for the team again when they hosted Newbridge-on-Wye on 28 March 2012. He was joined in that match by another former professional player and &quot;Soccer Saturday&quot; regular, Paul Merson, who also signed up to Welshpool. Merson scored in the match, but Welshpool still lost 4–1.

Manager David Jones was relieved of his duties as manager on 3 June 2013 and during the summer, Welshpool Town decided to bring back ex-Manager Russell Cadwallader, who had a successful period as manager during the late 1990s and early 2000s. David Jones was offered the role of Assistant Manager, but choose to move to local rivals Berriew as manager. In 2014–15 Welshpool finish 10th in the Mid Wales League Division 1, winning nine, drawing eight and losing 13, scoring 58 goals and conceding 75.
During the 23/34 season, the club struggled with numbers, which led to the reserve team folding and a number of the reserve team playing for the firsts, this was evidently not a great situation and the club finished the 23/24 season without a win and suffered relegation.

<doc id="303846" wikidata="Q2914819" url="?curid=303846" title="Alastair Windsor, 2nd Duke of Connaught and Strathearn">
<text>Alastair Arthur Windsor, 2nd Duke of Connaught and Strathearn (9 August 1914 – 26 April 1943) was a member of the British Royal Family. He was the only child of Prince Arthur of Connaught and Princess Alexandra, 2nd Duchess of Fife. He was a great-grandson of Queen Victoria through his father and a great-great-grandson of Queen Victoria through his mother. He was also a descendant of Victoria&#x27;s paternal uncle and predecessor, William IV, through an illegitimate line.

In 1942, he became the second Duke of Connaught and Strathearn and Earl of Sussex when he inherited his grandfather&#x27;s title. In 1943, at the age of 28, he died of exposure in Canada.

==Early life==
Alastair was born on 9 August 1914 at his parents&#x27; home at 54 Mount Street, Mayfair, London (now the Brazilian Embassy). His father was Prince Arthur of Connaught, the only son of Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, and Princess Louise Margaret of Prussia. His mother was Princess Alexandra, 2nd Duchess of Fife, the eldest daughter of Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife, and Louise, Princess Royal. Alastair was thus a great-grandchild of Queen Victoria through his father and great-great grandchild of her through his mother.

He was baptised on 1 September 1914 at his parents&#x27; home and his godparents were King George V (his maternal great-uncle and his father&#x27;s paternal cousin), King Alfonso XIII of Spain (for whom Lord Farquhar, a Lord in Waiting to King George, stood proxy), Queen Alexandra (his maternal great-grandmother), the Duke of Connaught and Strathearn (his paternal grandfather, for whom the Duke&#x27;s equerry Major Malcolm Murray stood proxy), Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll (his great-aunt), and Princess Mary (his cousin).

==Earl of Macduff==

Alastair was born shortly after the outbreak of the First World War, during which George V restructured the royal family by restricting the titles of prince and princess to the children of the sovereign, the children of the sovereign&#x27;s sons, and the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales. This excluded Alastair from a princely title, but as the heir apparent to his mother&#x27;s &quot;suo jure&quot; dukedom of Fife, he was entitled to use her secondary peerage Earl of Macduff as a courtesy title.

==Later life==

Lord Macduff was educated at Bryanston and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and was commissioned on 31 January 1935 as a second lieutenant into the Royal Scots Greys (2nd Dragoons), his father&#x27;s regiment, then based in Egypt. On 14 July 1939, Lord Macduff was promoted to lieutenant and was later assigned to Ottawa as aide-de-camp to his kinsman the Earl of Athlone, then Governor General of Canada; his own grandfather had held the same post during the First World War.

His father having died in 1938, Alastair succeeded, on his grandfather&#x27;s death in 1942, to the titles Duke of Connaught and Strathearn and Earl of Sussex. However, he died in 1943 at the age of 28 &quot;on active service&quot; in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, in unusual circumstances. Newspapers at the time reported that he died of &quot;natural causes.&quot;

Theo Aronson, in his 1981 biography of Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone, simply stated that the Duke &quot;was found dead on the floor of his room at Rideau Hall on the morning of 26 April 1943. He had died, apparently, from hypothermia.&quot; The diaries of Sir Alan Lascelles, King George VI&#x27;s private secretary, published in 2006, recorded that both the regiment and Athlone had rejected him as incompetent, and he fell out of a window when drunk and perished of hypothermia overnight.

His ashes were interred at St Ninian&#x27;s Chapel, Braemar, Scotland.

==Titles, styles, honours and arms==
===Titles and styles===
*1914–1917: &quot;His Highness&quot; Prince Alastair of Connaught
*1917–1942: Earl of Macduff
*1942–1943: &quot;His Grace&quot; The Duke of Connaught and Strathearn

===Arms===
In 1942, on the inheritance of his paternal grandfather&#x27;s dukedom, he was granted arms, being, quarterly, first and fourth his paternal grandfather&#x27;s arms (being the royal arms, differenced with a three-point label argent, the first and third points bearing fleurs-de-lys azure, the second a cross gules), second and third his maternal grandfather&#x27;s arms (quartering Fife and Duff).

Upon his death, the Dukedom of Connaught and Strathearn and the Earldom of Sussex became extinct. His first cousin, James Carnegie (23 September 1929 – 22 June 2015), succeeded as 3rd Duke of Fife and Earl of Macduff upon Princess Alexandra&#x27;s death on 26 February 1959.

<doc id="303847" wikidata="Q2579747" url="?curid=303847" title="Love and Death on Long Island">
<text>Love and Death on Long Island is a 1997 British-Canadian film adapted from Gilbert Adair&#x27;s 1990 novel of the same name, directed by Richard Kwietniowski and starring Jason Priestley, John Hurt, Fiona Loewi, Sheila Hancock and Anne Reid. The storyline of obsession somewhat resembles that of &quot;Death in Venice&quot;.

==Plot==
Giles De&#x27;Ath (John Hurt) is a British writer who doesn&#x27;t use or understand anything modern. One day, he forgets his keys and locks himself out of his flat. It begins to rain, so he goes to see an E. M. Forster movie but, instead, accidentally enters the wrong theatre and sees the teen film &quot;Hotpants College II&quot; starring Ronnie Bostock (Jason Priestley). He becomes instantly infatuated with Ronnie&#x27;s beauty and becomes obsessed with the young actor. He goes to his movies in the cinema, buys teen magazines and cuts out pictures of him, and buys a VCR and TV in order to play rented video tapes of his movies. He lets his housekeeper come into his office less and less, so that he can do these things undisturbed.

As his infatuation grows, it becomes obvious to those around him that Giles is becoming increasingly disturbed, though they don&#x27;t know why. His friend and agent suggests that he take a holiday.

Giles sets out to meet Ronnie on Long Island. He flies to Long Island and takes a train to Ronnie&#x27;s home town where he takes a motel room for several weeks. He searches the town for Ronnie - unsuccessfully at first - but finally spots Ronnie&#x27;s girlfriend and follows her to the supermarket. Giles rams his shopping cart into her to force an introduction and invents a story about his god-daughter, Abigail, being in love with Ronnie. The girlfriend, Audrey (Fiona Loewi), is seemingly glad to have found a fan-base for Ronnie in England, and spends the day talking to Giles. She then tells him that she and Ronnie will invite him over at another time, and they can talk about Ronnie&#x27;s career.

Eventually Giles becomes a regular visitor at Ronnie and Audrey&#x27;s house. Ronnie is flattered by Giles, and Giles is able to stay longer in his presence by claiming that he will write a new script for Ronnie, one that better suits his acting abilities. Audrey becomes suspicious of Giles&#x27;s motives regarding Ronnie, and she tells Giles that she is taking Ronnie to see her parents for an extended visit. Giles is very upset, and in a last-ditch effort confronts Ronnie and tells him how he feels about him. He says that many artists have had younger male lovers, and that Ronnie should split up with Audrey because it is obvious to him (Giles) that it won&#x27;t last. Ronnie rejects Giles but seems genuinely concerned for him. The film ends with a screening of Ronnie&#x27;s next film: another &quot;Hotpants College&quot; movie where he quotes Walt Whitman at his mother&#x27;s funeral as written by Giles. What happens to Giles in the end is not shown.

Critic Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half stars and praised Hurt for giving De&#x27;Ath &quot;a dignity...that transcends any snickering amusement at his infatuation. Jonathan Rosenbaum of &quot;The Chicago Reader&quot; called the film &quot;perfectly realized, beautifully acted [and] sweetly hilarious...a witty, canny meditation on the power of pop culture in general and the rationalizations of cinephilia and film criticism in particular. What makes it perhaps even better than Adair’s clever novel...is the beautiful balance of humane sympathies Kwietniowski achieves; at no point does the foolishness or vanity of either character wipe out our sense of his dignity, and Fiona Loewi is no less touching as the movie star’s girlfriend.&quot; And Mark Caro of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; also gave the film three and a half stars and called it &quot;a bewitching comedy about what happens when Giles opens himself up to the modern world -- and his own sexual inclinations,&quot; adding that it&#x27;s &quot;charming, caustic, touching and vaguely creepy.&quot; Caro singled out Hurt for capturing &quot;the ridiculousness of Giles&#x27; mission without ever sacrificing his dignity. It&#x27;s a performance in which you marvel at the details: the contrast between his haughty manner outside and his private embarrassed laughter as he watches a Bostock video in which a biker is catapulted into a manure pile; his startled reaction to a car that robotically warns, &quot;You are standing too close to this vehicle&quot;; the way he flinches when a close-up of a mortally wounded Bostock character cuts to a shot of a priest, as if Giles had forgotten that the precious image on his TV screen was not fixed there.&quot; Caro also lauded director Kwietniowski for showing &quot;a gentle touch in portraying Giles&#x27; folly and satirizing British stuffiness and American anti-intellectualism.&quot;

===Box office===
The film grossed $78,151 in its opening weekend, the number one exclusive release in New York and Los Angeles for the weekend. It went on to gross $2,581,012 at the box office in the United States and Canada. In the United Kingdom, the film grossed £0.4 million ($0.7 million).

<text>Port Talbot Town Football Club () is a Welsh football club from Port Talbot. It was founded in 1901 as Port Talbot Athletic, one of the first clubs in the country. The club plays in the South Wales Premier League, and is based at Victoria Road.

==History==
Formed in 1901, Port Talbot began life as a member of the Swansea Senior League and continued playing following the hiatus due to World War One. Although records are sparse, the club is thought to have played in the Swansea Senior League until 1926, when it became a founder of the Port Talbot and District Association Football League; and to have competed in the Welsh League Division 2 Western from the 1928–29 season onwards under the name Seaside Athletic.

Although the club can trace rather tenuous roots back to 1901, the modern club originated shortly after World War II as Port Talbot Athletic.

The club gained promotion to Division 1 in 1956–57, but was relegated after one season. It regained promotion as Division 2 West champions in 1961–62 but was relegated again after one season. The pattern of promotion and relegation after a year was repeated for the third time when Port Talbot went down at the end of the 1970–71 season.

Port Talbot was promoted into the League of Wales in 2000, and changed its name to Port Talbot Town in 2001. Port Talbot&#x27;s rivalry with Afan Lido, located less than half a mile away, is considered one of the fiercest in South Wales.

Port Talbot finished third in 2009–10, gaining a berth in the Europa League 2010–11, its first appearance in European Competition. However, the club was vanquished 7–1 on aggregate by Finnish side Turun Palloseura in the first qualifying round, which included a 0–4 thrashing in the home fixture on 8 July 2010 with 676 in attendance.

During the 2015–16 Welsh Premier League season Andy Dyer&#x27;s Blues make it to the semi-final stage of the Welsh Cup against Airbus, but lost in a 7–0 drubbing.

Weeks later the Football Association of Wales relegated Port Talbot from the Welsh Premier League although the club had finished above the relegation places in tenth spot. The relegation was the consequence of the FAW&#x27;s decision to refuse Port Talbot a Domestic License on financial grounds. The club appealed the decision but the appeal was rejected. The club then overhauled its internal structure, appointing a new chairman, vice-chairman, secretary and treasurer, and forming a steering committee consisting of both staff and supporters. The wage bill for the 2016–17 was cut massively in order to keep the club financially sustainable. This was done largely by replacing some of the existing squad with players from the academy.

At the end of the 2018–19 season Port Talbot finished 13th, avoiding relegation by one spot. However the club were refused the FAW Tier 2 certification
 required to play in the newly formed Cymru South for the 2019–20 season. The appeals body upheld this decision and the club was demoted to the new Tier 3 Welsh Football League Division One. Following the cessation of the 2019–20 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Port Talbot achieved promotion back to the Cymru South at the first attempt with a third-place finish on the unweighted points per games method.

==Support==
Average home attendance for Port Talbot Town matches between 1994 and 2010 was 207, although some attendances at the Victoria Road Stadium have been notably higher, including the 2,640 spectators who watched Port Talbot defeat Football League side Swansea City 2–1 in an FAW Premier Cup quarter final in 2007, during the Swans&#x27; run-away promotion year. Also, an estimated 400 supporters travelled to the 2010 Welsh Cup final in Llanelli between Port Talbot and three-time winners Bangor City, won by Bangor 3–2. Port Talbot has become renowned for its vocal following in recent years, if not for its performance on the pitch or in the boardroom.

<text>The Medill School of Journalism (formally the Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications) is the journalism school of Northwestern University. It offers both undergraduate and graduate programs. It frequently ranks as one of the top schools of journalism in the United States. Medill alumni include over 40 Pulitzer Prize laureates, numerous national correspondents for major networks, many well-known reporters, columnists and media executives. Founded in 1921, it is named for publisher and editor Joseph Medill.

Northwestern is one of the few schools embracing a technological approach towards journalism.
Medill received a Knight Foundation grant to establish the Knight News Innovation Laboratory in 2011. The Knight Lab is a joint initiative of Medill and the McCormick School of Engineering at Northwestern, one of the first to combine journalism and computer science.

==Description==
The Medill School was founded in 1921, and named after Joseph Medill (1823–1899), owner and editor of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, which was then run by his grandsons Robert R. McCormick and Joseph Medill Patterson.
The journalism program offers Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees. The undergraduate curriculum requires a broad liberal arts education as well as the study and practice of journalism. The one-year master&#x27;s curriculum is an intensive hands-on with students specializing in either: Health, Environment and Science; Magazine; Media Innovation and Content Strategy; Politics, Policy and Foreign Affairs; Social Justice and Investigative Reporting; Sports Media; or Video and Broadcast.

The Integrated Marketing Communications program offers a Master of Science degree and Undergraduate Certificate. The graduate level program has full-time, part-time and online options. Full-time students can pursue a specialization, choosing from brand strategy, content marketing, digital and interactive marketing, marketing analytics, strategic communications and media management.

Medill undergraduates participate in a journalism residency for one quarter in their junior or senior year, during which they intern in a professional newsroom or media organization. Media outlets across the United States—and in some cases, overseas—have participated in this program.

Medill is headquartered on the southern end of Northwestern&#x27;s campus in Evanston, Illinois, but it also opened a program in 2008, at the branch campus Northwestern University in Qatar. Northwestern&#x27;s also has a San Francisco campus, located at 44 Montgomery St., right in the city’s Financial District. It opened in fall 2016 and is a partnership between both Medill and Northwestern’s McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science. For many years the school&#x27;s main location was in Fisk Hall. In fall 2002, the school opened the McCormick Foundation Center (formerly the McCormick Tribune Center), which features a professional-grade TV studio and multimedia classrooms for Medill&#x27;s growing emphasis on new forms of media. It was generally known as the Medill School of Journalism. To reflect the broader focus the faculty approved the expanded name &quot;Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications&quot; in late 2010, and the new name was approved by the university board of trustees in March 2011.

==Medill Knight Lab==

Medill is known for graduates who &quot;mix high-tech savvy with hard-nosed reporting skills&quot;. The Knight Lab is a joint initiative of Northwestern&#x27;s Medill School of Journalism and the Robert R. McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science funded by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation announced in 2011. It combines the disciplines of journalism and computer science together to establish a &quot;media innovation lab&quot;, one of the few of its kind in the country. According to Northwestern&#x27;s press release:
:&quot;Among the Knight Lab&#x27;s goals is to maximize use of open-source software already developed through the Knight News Challenge, a $25 million worldwide media innovation contest now in its fifth year, as well as from other grantees from Knight Foundation&#x27;s $100 million media innovation initiative...Those include projects such as Open Block, an aggregator of public information; Document Cloud, for managing and displaying original documents; Public Insight Journalism, which helps newsrooms tap the wisdom of the community to find better news sources; and Spot.Us, a new way of &quot;crowd-funding&quot; journalism.&quot;

==Medill Justice Project==

The Medill Justice Project, originally known as the Medill Innocence Project, began in 1999, as an effort by Medill faculty and students to reinvestigate murder convictions in Illinois and determine if people were wrongly convicted. This effort has helped to free 11 men, including murderer Anthony Porter and the Ford Heights Four. Medill Justice Project work is credited with prompting Illinois Governor George Ryan to suspend the death penalty and commute all death sentences in 2003.

In 1999, the project successfully worked to free Anthony Porter, who had been convicted of killing two people. Alstory Simon made a video confession to the crimes, encouraged by the Medill Justice Project and a private investigator. Simon pleaded guilty and was eventually sentenced to 37 years. However, in 2014, authorities exonerated Simon and freed him from prison. Anita Alvarez, of the Cook County State&#x27;s Attorney&#x27;s Office, criticized David Protess, the Innocence Project founder and director, and long-time Medill journalism professor. Prosecutors said Protess, private investigator Paul Ciolino, and Medill students manipulated Simon into making the confession. The Innocence Project allegedly told Simon he could be executed, said he could earn money from book deals if he cooperated, and falsely claimed there was a witness who implicated Simon. The Medill Innocence Project has been accused of framing Alstory Simon for the murders. In 2015, Simon sued Northwestern for $40 million; the case was settled in 2018 for an undisclosed amount.

From 2009 to 2011, the project was involved in a dispute with the Cook County, Illinois state&#x27;s attorney over the handling of the Anthony McKinney case. The university claimed reporter&#x27;s privilege in resisting a subpoena for Justice Project records of the case, while the state claimed the project had been acting as investigators in behalf of McKinney&#x27;s counsel. Medill faculty member David Protess was suspended during this dispute. In 2011, Protess left to found the Chicago Innocence Project and blog for the Huffington Post while the school gave up the records.

In February 2018, Medill Justice Project Director Alec Klein was accused of bullying and sexual harassment by multiple former students and employees. Klein &quot;categorically&quot; denied the allegations and took a leave of absence during the university&#x27;s investigation. Klein resigned from his position and left the university in August.

==Spiegel Research Center==
The Medill IMC Spiegel Digital &amp; Database Research Center is the first research center at Medill. Founded in 2011, it is funded by a gift from the late Ted Spiegel, Medill professor emeritus and member of the family who founded the Spiegel (catalog), and his wife Audrey. The center focuses on evidence-based, data driven analysis to prove the connection between customer engagement and purchase behavior.

==Medill News Service==
=== Chicago ===
Medill operates a working newsroom in downtown Chicago as part of its graduate journalism program. Graduate students have been providing news coverage to client newspapers since 1995. Each quarter, student reporters are assigned to cover stories about city and county government, the events in state and federal courts, business and economic development, health and science issues and the arts and sports.

===Washington, D.C.===
Every Medill News Service journalist also has the opportunity to spend a quarter in a Washington, D.C., covering breaking news as well as in-depth, enterprise stories on politics, civil rights, energy, technology or education. Medill journalists attend congressional proceedings, press conferences, conventions and congressional hearings and connect those stories to the communities they cover—not an insider audience.

The Medill News Service serves newspapers, Web sites, television stations and radio stations, which all pay a quarterly fee to help cover production and communications costs. Print correspondents transmit stories electronically every day. Television stories are sent by network feed or satellite, or shipped overnight, as each station requires.

== San Francisco campus==
For Medill IMC students or Master&#x27;s Journalism students of the Media Innovation and Entrepreneurship (MIE) specialization, a new campus in downtown San Francisco opened in September 2016 to facilitate special curricula during one quarter of their program.

For Medill MIE students, this campus is the epicenter of their studies related to human-centered design, the business of startups, and learning to code and work within a tech-industry company. While taking courses related to creating startups, students also work 2 days a week with a practicum company (internship).

In a February 11, 2008 column written for the &quot;Daily Northwestern&quot;, Medill senior David Spett questioned the use of anonymous sources by Dean John Lavine in a letter Lavine wrote for Medill&#x27;s alumni magazine. Lavine attributed a quote praising a Medill marketing class to &quot;a Medill junior&quot; in the class. Spett reportedly called all 29 students enrolled in the class, including all five Medill juniors, and according to Spett, all denied saying the quote. Lavine denied fabricating the quote in a February 20 email to students, but expressed regret for what he called &quot;poor judgment&quot; in not keeping his notes.

The so-called &quot;Quotegate&quot; controversy was the focus of stories, columns and editorials in local and national media, including the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;Editor &amp; Publisher&quot;.

<text>Richard Dalton Howser (May 14, 1936 – June 17, 1987) was an American Major League Baseball shortstop, coach, and manager who was best known as the manager of the Kansas City Royals during the 1980s and for guiding them to the franchise&#x27;s first World Series title in 1985.

==Playing career==
A native of Miami, Florida, Howser grew up in West Palm Beach, Florida; graduated from Palm Beach High School; and attended Florida State University. He was a member of the Sigma Nu fraternity. At Florida State, he received honors twice as an All-American shortstop and set a school record with a batting average of .422 in 1956. He signed with the Kansas City Athletics on June 13, 1958. He hit .280, stole 37 bases, scored 108 runs, and led American League shortstops in putouts and errors in his rookie season. For this he was selected to the 1961 All-Star team, and was named &quot;The Sporting News&quot; rookie of the year.

As his stats declined in the following two years, his only other season as a regular was with the Cleveland Indians in 1964. His major league career spanned eight seasons with three clubs – Kansas City Athletics, Cleveland Indians, and New York Yankees.

Tommy John played with Howser in Cleveland. He described the shortstop as &quot;an aggressive, sparkplug type who&#x27;d lead both on and off the field...you could tell even then that Dick would make a fine manager.&quot;

==Managerial career==
Immediately following his playing career, he was the third base coach with the Yankees for ten seasons (1969–1978). He then spent one year (1979) as head baseball coach at his alma mater, Florida State.

As a manager at the major league level, Howser never finished lower than second place during his seven-year managerial career.

===New York Yankees (1978, 1980)===
He made his debut in 1978, managing one game with the Yankees between Billy Martin&#x27;s and Bob Lemon&#x27;s first tours as skipper in the Bronx. In 1980, he returned from Florida State to become a full-time manager of the Yankees, taking them to the AL Eastern Division championship with a 103–59 record but losing three consecutive games to the Kansas City Royals in the playoffs; he was the fourth manager to win 100 games in his first full season as a manager.

Howser was one of the few Yankee managers who refused to let owner George Steinbrenner push him around. When Steinbrenner would call the manager&#x27;s office before or after games while Howser was meeting with coaches or reporters, Howser would pick up the phone, say &quot;I&#x27;m busy!&quot;, and hang up. Steinbrenner had a rule about facial hair, which Reggie Jackson would skirt around from time to time in 1980. Howser refused to correct Jackson because he thought Jackson&#x27;s facial hair was unimportant given the year Jackson was having; however, Jackson later relented and shaved out of respect for Howser. For the most part, though, Howser was stricter in enforcing team rules, more so than Martin and Lemon had been, in Tommy John&#x27;s opinion.

In Game 2 of the 1980 American League Championship Series, Yankee third base coach Mike Ferraro waved Willie Randolph home on a double by Bob Watson with two outs in the top of the eighth inning and the Yankees down 3–2. Randolph was thrown out at the plate on a relay throw by George Brett, prompting Steinbrenner to jump out of his seat and shout what appeared to be profanities on live national television. Steinbrenner wanted Ferraro fired on the spot after the game, but Howser refused. The Yankees lost the ALCS in three games, and Howser submitted his resignation on November 21, although it is generally felt that Steinbrenner actually fired him. Howser was the first manager to be fired/resign after leading a team to a 100 win season (incidentally, Steinbrenner had fired Howser&#x27;s predecessor Billy Martin in the middle of the 1978 season after he had led the Yankees to a 100-win season the year before).

In the 2007 ESPN produced mini-series &quot;The Bronx Is Burning&quot;, Howser was portrayed by actor Max Casella.

===Kansas City Royals (1981–1986)===

The next year, Kansas City—his postseason rival on multiple occasions in previous seasons—hired Howser to manage the last 33 games of the strike-shortened 1981 season. Under Howser, the Royals finished second in 1982 and 1983. Prior to the 1984 season, with their clubhouse ravaged by drug problems, the Royals started disassembling their team and starting over. Kansas City expected 1984 to be a rebuilding year, but Howser guided the young team to a division title. The Royals were swept in 3 games by the eventual World Champion Detroit Tigers in the ALCS.

The following year, Howser guided the Royals to their first World Series title. The Royals reached the World Series by defeating the Toronto Blue Jays, four games to three, in the American League Championship Series, which was Toronto&#x27;s first postseason appearance. The Royals then went on to defeat the heavily favored St. Louis Cardinals. In both the ALCS (the first year the League Championship Series was best-of-7) and World Series, the Royals won each series by overcoming a 3–1 deficit.

===1986 Major League Baseball All-Star Game===
As manager of the defending AL champion Royals, Howser managed the 1986 All-Star Game at the Astrodome in Houston.

The AL won 3–2, starting a 30-year stretch that has seen the junior circuit go 22–1–1 in the Mid-Summer Classic after going 2–21 from 1963 through 1985.

However, during the game, broadcasters on ABC noticed he was messing up signals when he changed pitchers, and Howser later admitted he felt sick before the game. It would be the last game he would manage, as he was diagnosed with a brain tumor and underwent surgery.

===Managerial record===

==Death==
Howser attempted a comeback during spring training of 1987 with the Royals, but he quickly found he was physically too weak and abandoned the attempt in late February when Billy Gardner took over. Three months later, he died at St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital in Kansas City and was buried in Tallahassee, Florida. Two pitchers from his 1981 Royals team later died of brain cancer: Dan Quisenberry in 1998 and Ken Brett in 2003.

Howser was survived by his wife Nancy and twin daughters from a previous marriage.

===Tributes===

On July 3, 1987, Howser&#x27;s number 10 became the first number retired by the Kansas City Royals. Also that year, the St. Petersburg Area Chamber of Commerce established the Dick Howser Trophy, college baseball&#x27;s equivalent of college football&#x27;s Heisman Trophy, in Howser&#x27;s honor.

Florida State University&#x27;s baseball team plays on Mike Martin Field at Dick Howser Stadium, named in his honor, and he is honored with a bronze bust on the stadium grounds.

The Royals also commissioned a new bronze statue for their Outfield Experience to cap off the end of Kauffman Stadium renovations in 2009. The statue was revealed in a dedication ceremony on Opening Day, April 10, 2009.

<doc id="303857" wikidata="Q1049632" url="?curid=303857" title="Prospect Park (Brooklyn)">
<text>Prospect Park is a urban park in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. The park is situated between the neighborhoods of Park Slope, Prospect Heights, Prospect Lefferts Gardens, Flatbush, and Windsor Terrace, and is adjacent to the Brooklyn Museum, Grand Army Plaza, and the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. With an area of , Prospect Park is the second-largest public park in Brooklyn, behind Marine Park. Designated as a New York City scenic landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places, Prospect Park is operated by the Prospect Park Alliance and NYC Parks.

First proposed in legislation passed in 1859, Prospect Park was laid out by landscape architects Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux for the then-independent city of Brooklyn. Prospect Park opened in 1867, though it was not substantially complete until 1873. The park subsequently underwent numerous modifications and expansions to its facilities. Several additions to the park were completed in the 1890s, in the City Beautiful architectural movement. In the early 20th century, New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks) commissioner Robert Moses started a program to clean up Prospect Park. A period of decline in the late 20th century spurred the creation of the Prospect Park Alliance, which refurbished many parts of the park from the 1980s through the 2020s.

Main attractions of the park include the Long Meadow; the Picnic House; Litchfield Villa; Prospect Park Zoo; the Boathouse; Concert Grove; Brooklyn&#x27;s only lake, covering ; and the Prospect Park Bandshell that hosts outdoor concerts in the summertime. The park also has sports facilities, including the Prospect Park Tennis Center, basketball courts, baseball fields, soccer fields, and the New York Pétanque Club in the Parade Ground. There is also a private Society of Friends (Quaker) cemetery on Quaker Hill near the ball fields. In addition, Prospect Park is part of the Brooklyn-Queens Greenway, a network of green spaces that stretch across western Long Island.

==History==
===Before the park===
Approximately 17,000 years ago, the terminal moraine of the receding Wisconsin Glacier that formed Long Island, known as the Harbor Hill Moraine, established a string of hills and kettles in the northern part of the park and a lower lying outwash plain in the southern part. Mount Prospect (or Prospect Hill), near the intersection of Flatbush Avenue and Eastern Parkway, is one of the tallest hills in Brooklyn, rising 200 feet (61 m) above sea level. It is the highest among a string of hills that extends into the park, including Sullivan, Breeze, and Lookout hills. The area was originally forested, but became open pasture after two centuries of European colonization. Significant stands of trees remained only in the peat bogs centered south of Ninth and Flatbush Avenues, as well as in a large bog north of Ninth Street, and contained chestnut, white poplar, and oak. Some of these stands were preserved in the modern-day Prospect Park Ravine and nicknamed &quot;The Last Forest of Brooklyn&quot;.

During the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), the park was a site of the Battle of Long Island (aka Battle of Brooklyn). American forces attempted to hold Battle Pass, an opening in the terminal moraine where the old Flatbush Road passed from the villages of Brooklyn to Flatbush, where a large white oak tree was cut down to block the progress of the British forces. It fell after some of the heaviest fighting in the engagement, and its loss contributed to George Washington&#x27;s decision to retreat. Even though the Continental Army lost the battle, they were able to hold the British back long enough for Washington&#x27;s army to escape across the East River to Manhattan. Plaques north of the zoo, as well as the Maryland Monument at Lookout Hill&#x27;s foot, honor this event.

The then-independent city of Brooklyn built a reservoir on Prospect Hill in 1856 to serve the western half of the city with water pumped from the Ridgewood Reservoir. The need to keep the lots around the reservoir free of development, as well as the preservation of the Battle Pass area, were cited as two reasons for establishing a large park nearby.

===Planning===

The original impetus to build Prospect Park stemmed from an April 18, 1859, act of the New York State Legislature, empowering a twelve-member commission to recommend sites for parks in the City of Brooklyn. At the time, Brooklyn was the world&#x27;s first commuter suburb, and it became the third largest city in the country from 1860 to 1880, behind New York City (which then included Manhattan and parts of the Bronx) and Philadelphia. During this time, concepts concerning public parks gained popularity. In 1858, Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux had created the design for Central Park in Manhattan, which became the first landscaped park in the United States. James S. T. Stranahan, then President of the Brooklyn Board of Park Commissioners, believed that a park in Brooklyn &quot;would become a favorite resort for all classes of our community, enabling thousands to enjoy pure air, with healthful exercise, at all seasons of the year...&quot; He also thought a public park would attract wealthy residents. Stranahan originally envisioned one large park extending eastward to Jamaica, Queens. However, the city&#x27;s rapid development made this impossible, and today, the largest remnants of this proposed landscape are Prospect Park and the Forest Park in Queens.

In February 1860, a group of fifteen commissioners submitted suggestions for locations of four large parks and three small parks in Brooklyn, as well as a series of boulevards to connect said parks. The largest of these proposed parks was a plot centered on Mount Prospect and bounded by Warren Street to the north; Vanderbilt, Ninth, and Tenth Avenues to the west; Third and Ninth Streets to the south; and Washington Avenue to the east. Egbert Viele began drawing plans for &quot;Mount Prospect Park&quot;, as the space was initially called, and published his proposal in 1861. The park was to straddle Flatbush Avenue and include Prospect Hill, as well as the land now occupied by the Brooklyn Public Library, Brooklyn Botanic Garden, and Brooklyn Museum.

By late 1860, land had been purchased for Viele&#x27;s plan. However, the onset of the Civil War stopped further activity, and the boulevards and smaller parks were pushed back. The delay prompted some reflection; Stranahan invited Calvert Vaux to review Viele&#x27;s plans early in 1865. Vaux took issue with Flatbush Avenue&#x27;s division of the park, thought that the park should have a lake, and urged for southward expansion beyond the city limits and into the then-independent town of Flatbush. Vaux&#x27;s February 1865 proposal reflected the present layout of the park: three distinctive regions, meadow in the north and west, a wooded ravine in the east, and a lake in the south, without being divided by Flatbush Avenue. Vaux included an oval plaza at the northern end of the park, which would later become Grand Army Plaza. The revised plan called for the purchase of additional parcels to the south and west to accommodate Prospect Lake, but it excluded parcels already purchased east of Flatbush Avenue, including Prospect Hill itself. In addition, engineer-in-charge Joseph P. Davis and assistants John Bogart and John Y. Culyer were named to work on the project.

By then, land speculation was underway. The plot bounded by Ninth and Tenth Avenues between Third and Fifteenth Streets was held by real estate developer Edwin Clarke Litchfield, who had erected his home, Litchfield Manor, on the east side of Ninth Avenue in 1857. The Parks Commission ultimately acquired the Litchfield plot in 1868 for $1.7 million, forty-two percent of the overall expenditure for land, even though the plot constituted just over five percent of the park&#x27;s acreage. Much of this acreage houses the maintenance yards and is rarely seen by the public. In 1866, the New York state legislature passed a bill approving the acquisition of additional land on the southwest side of the park. The park was built around the preexisting Quaker cemetery, which was accommodated by an agreement under which the Society of Friends deeded their unused acreage to the park. In exchange, they retained the remaining 10 acres for their private cemetery in perpetuity, as well as the rights to access the cemetery.

=== Construction ===
Despite the repercussions of Vaux&#x27;s revisions, Stranahan championed the revised proposal. Vaux recruited Olmsted and formally presented the plan in February 1866. The revised plan was accepted by May. Construction started the following month, and initial work focused on draining the land. Then, the roads, bridle paths, and walks within Prospect Park were graded and individual features were landscaped. Three scenic roads, the West, Center, and East Drives, were built within the perimeters of the park. Depending on the time of year, between 250 and 2,000 workers were employed. Much of the landscaping focused on removing obstructions such as pits and swamps, and enhancing other natural features such as hills. Trees were only removed if they blocked a roadway or path that was being built.

The first section of the park opened to the public on October 19, 1867, while it was still under construction. The segment that was open to the public included part of the East Drive between the north end of the park, at modern-day Grand Army Plaza, and Coney Island Avenue at the southeast corner. The park initially contained the Playground, which had a croquet lawn, a sailboat pond, a maze, and a summer house. By 1868, the open portions of Prospect Park were patronized by 100,000 people per month, and several miles of roads, paths, and walkways had been completed. The land for Prospect Park&#x27;s Parade Ground was acquired that year. A series of pedestrian arches to separate pedestrian and vehicular traffic in the park were also built during this time.

Over 200 benches were installed to accommodate the new visitors. Rustic wooden shelters with &quot;various oblong and polygonal shapes&quot; were placed along the shore of Prospect Park&#x27;s lake and were designed to be used as scenic overlooks. Several bridges and eight hundred bird houses were installed to enhance the park&#x27;s rustic quality. In its 1870 annual report, the Brooklyn park commissioners reported that the lake was nearly completed, and that widening of nearby streets was underway. By 1871, the monthly visitor count had increased to 250,000. The park&#x27;s patronage continued to increase, and in an 1873 article, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Prospect Park as having become an &quot;indispensable Sunday resort for the toiling thousands of Brooklyn.&quot; However, the high patronage also had downsides: an 1875 editorial in the &quot;Times&quot; observed that many people would take shortcuts along the grass rather than travel on designated routes.

Prospect Park was substantially complete in 1873, but with the financial panic of that year, Olmsted and Vaux stopped collaborating on the park&#x27;s construction. Some of the originally envisioned facets of the park, such as an observation tower, a terraced restaurant, and a top-shaped Carriage Concourse, were not built. Olmsted and Vaux had also planned for a system of parkways to connect to Prospect Park, though only two were built: Ocean Parkway, running to Coney Island in the south, and Eastern Parkway, running to Crown Heights in the east. Overall, the city of Brooklyn spent more than $4 million to acquire the parkland, while the actual cost of construction amounted to more than $5 million.

Stranahan was regarded by his 19th-century peers as the true &quot;Father of Prospect Park&quot;, a reputation established through his 22-year reign as Park Commission president (1860–1882), engagement of Olmsted and Vaux, overseeing complex land acquisitions, securing funding to build the park, and after the park&#x27;s completion, defending the park against changes that were not compatible with the overall design. A statue of James S. T. Stranahan was proposed in 1890. Located inside the Grand Army Plaza entrance, the statue was sculpted by Frederick MacMonnies and presented to Stranahan in June 1891.

=== Late 19th century ===
Prospect Park became widely used after its opening, and many sports were hosted there. By the late 19th century, archery was among the most popular sports being practiced on the Long Meadow, and up to 100 groups would convene on the Long Meadow to play croquet on weekend afternoons. During winters, people practiced &quot;ice baseball&quot; on the lake. Ice skating was also a common sport, and was frequently practiced on the lake during the winter. Because picnicking was banned in Central Park, and generally disapproved-of in many other parks in Manhattan, Prospect Park became a popular picnic spot. However, this also resulted in litter, and by 1881, &quot;The New York Times&quot; was receiving complaints about a lack of cleanliness in the park.

No new structures were constructed in Prospect Park until 1882, when a utilitarian brick stable was constructed on the park&#x27;s western side. The same year, Brooklyn mayor Seth Low did not reappoint Stranahan or the other commissioners, a change that neither Stranahan nor the other commissioners actively opposed. Stranahan, for his part, was becoming more engaged in other Brooklyn concerns. The action, however, did signal a change in the style of park management, which grew to embrace neoclassicism.

Simultaneously during the 1880s, the quality of Prospect Park had declined through overuse and a corresponding lack of maintenance. After Brooklyn Mayor Alfred C. Chapin walked through the park in 1888, he requested that $100,000 be allocated for improvements. Subsequently, the Brooklyn Parks Commission embarked on a $200,000 program to restore the park. It repaved many of the walkways and drives, as well as replanted flora. Ornate gateways were added to the Ocean Parkway and Willink Plaza entrances. The commission also proposed purchasing the land around the Mount Prospect Reservoir, northeast of modern-day Prospect Park, which had been excluded from the final plan for the park. Instead, this space was developed as the Brooklyn Museum in the 1890s, followed by the Brooklyn Central Library and Brooklyn Botanic Garden in the early 20th century. The reservoir was filled in, and along with Mount Prospect Hill, became the separate Mount Prospect Park in 1940.

The park and its surroundings were subsequently restored in the 1890s during the City Beautiful movement. After the Soldier&#x27;s and Sailor&#x27;s Arch at Grand Army Plaza was built in 1892, the park commissioners engaged the McKim, Mead, and White architectural firm to redesign Grand Army Plaza in a complementary, neoclassical way. By 1896, Grand Army Plaza sported four towering granite columns adorned with carved and eagles at the base, though the bronze eagles atop the columns would not be installed until 1902. Granite fencing with decorative bronze urns replaced simple wooden fencing, and polygonal granite pavilions on the east and west corners of the park supplanted earlier rustic shelters. All the major entrances of the park gained similar neoclassical treatments. By the turn of the twentieth century, sculptures by Frederick MacMonnies graced the Arch and works by MacMonnies and Alexander Proctor adorned many of the entrances.

Neoclassical structures appeared elsewhere within the park. McKim, Mead and White designed the Ocean Parkway and Willink entrances, which opened in 1890. The same firm transformed the Children&#x27;s Playground and Pools in the park&#x27;s northeast quadrant into the Rose Garden and the Vale of Cashmere, each a formally arranged space, in 1893–1894. Stanford White&#x27;s Maryland Monument was installed near the Terrace Bridge in 1895 in recognition of the Maryland 400, who fought in the Battle of Long Island on the slopes of Lookout Hill.

=== Early 20th century ===
The city of Brooklyn merged with Manhattan and other outlying boroughs in 1898, creating the City of Greater New York. By the end of the century, Prospect Park saw about 15 million visitors per year. Though people were officially banned from hosting picnics and other large eating events in Prospect Park, the rule was not enforced for several years until 1903, when a surge of visitors from Manhattan led to an increase in luncheons being hosted. In 1907, lights were installed to deter couples from kissing or other intimate activity within the park. At the same time, the city embarked on an improvement program at Prospect Park by cleaning out the landscape, constructing the Bartel-Pritchard Square entrance, and removing an old boathouse that had been supplanted by the Boathouse on the Lullwater.

The construction of structures continued in the first decade of the 20th century. The neoclassical Peristyle (1904), Boathouse (1905), Tennis House (1910), and Willink Comfort Station (1912) were all designed by Helmle, Hudswell and Huberty, alumni and proteges of McKim, Mead, and White. The entrances into Prospect Park that were constructed during this time were also in the neoclassical style. Two now-demolished structures were also constructed on the peninsula, the Model Yacht Club House (1900–1956) and a shelter (1915 – ). Olmsted was said to have been &quot;distressed&quot; by these modifications to the park&#x27;s original plan.

From World War I to the mayoral administration of Fiorello La Guardia in the 1930s, investment in park infrastructure declined. A two-story brick building was opened in the Menagerie in 1916, housing monkeys, some small mammals, and several birds. After the end of World War I, a memorial commemorating fallen soldiers was proposed; it was dedicated in 1921. The only other structures to be built during this period were the Picnic House (1927) and a small comfort station at the Ocean Avenue entrance (1930), both designed by J. Sarsfield Kennedy. A golf course was proposed for the Long Meadow in the 1920s, but eventually, it was built on the Peninsula, abutting the Lake at the park&#x27;s southern end. In 1932, a faux Mount Vernon was built in Prospect Park to commemorate the of George Washington&#x27;s birthday. However, Prospect Park was in stasis for the most part, and like many of the city&#x27;s parks, it was run year-after-year with declining budgets. &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed that by the 1930s, &quot;generations of Parks Department officials had lived well and got rich by diverting maintenance funds, and the park showed the result of a half century of abuse and neglect.&quot;

===Robert Moses era===
In January 1934, newly elected Mayor Fiorello La Guardia appointed Robert Moses as the commissioner of the New York City Department of Parks (NYC Parks), a new organization that eliminated borough park commissioners. Moses would remain commissioner for the next twenty-six years, leaving significant impacts on the city&#x27;s parks. Moses used federal monies made available to relieve Depression-era unemployment, and this resulted in a boom in construction at Prospect Park. The Prospect Park Zoo opened in 1935 on the east side of the park, replacing the former Menagerie. The Bandshell and five playgrounds were also constructed toward the end of the 1930s. In addition, the Carousel was opened in 1949 as a gift from the foundation of the late philanthropist Michael Friedsam. Moses also enacted new policies at the park, including a ban on sheep grazing at the Long Meadow.

During World War II, Prospect Park hosted a portion of the city&#x27;s antiaircraft defense. Three hundred soldiers manned batteries, underground ammunition dumps, observation towers, repair shops and barracks around Swan Lake in the Long Meadow. Though the defenses were disbanded in 1944, traces of slit trenches and sandbagged gun emplacements could still be found several years afterward. In 1959, the southern third of the Long Meadow was graded and fenced off for ballfields.

Plans for the Kate Wollman Memorial Rink were approved in 1960, and the rink opened in December 1961. The rink was built on a filled-in portion of Prospect Lake, necessitating the removal of Music Island and the panoramic view of the lake created by Olmsted and Vaux. To make the park more visually appealing, NYC Parks also began to clear the area of weeds and invasive species, though this had the unintended effect of hastening erosion.

It was not unusual in the Moses years, and especially the decade after his departure, to quietly remove underutilized or redundant structures. To do so was regarded as economical and prudent management. Several structures had been destroyed by the time Moses left his position as NYC Parks commissioner in May 1960. These included the Dairy, destroyed 1935; Concert Grove House, demolished 1949; Music Island, razed 1960; the Flower Garden; the Thatched Shelter, destroyed in the 1940s; the Model Yacht Club, burned down in 1956; and the Greenhouse Conservatories, taken apart in 1955.

=== Late 20th century ===

==== 1960s and 1970s ====
The demolition of Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan during 1963–1968 spawned a nascent historic preservation movement. In September 1964, the Parks Department was within forty-eight hours of demolishing the Boathouse on the Lullwater. At the time the structure was underutilized; the boat concession only operated on weekends and its peak traffic was fewer than ten people per hour. However, the Boathouse shared many architectural design features with the famous station. A preservation group, The Friends of Prospect Park, including in its membership, poet and longtime Brooklyn resident Marianne Moore, built public awareness over disappearing historical structures and threatened flora within the park. Public pressure induced Park Commissioner Newbold Morris to rescind the decision to demolish the Boathouse in December 1964.

Projects to restore Prospect Park were taken up by the late 1960s. In 1965, the city allocated $450,000 to renovate the Vale of Cashmere and the Rose Garden ahead of Brooklyn&#x27;s 300th anniversary, and the park&#x27;s 100th anniversary, the following year. Another $225,000 was allocated to renovate the boathouse, and $249,000 was allotted to overall renovations. The city renovated part of the Long Meadow on the northwest side of the park, as well as the children&#x27;s farm. However, some of the contracts were delayed, including renovations to the Boathouse and the tennis courts, as well as a reconstruction of the Music Pagoda, which had burned down in 1968. By 1971, the city had spent $4 million to renovate Prospect Park, including renovating the Boathouse and dredging the lake. The Rose Garden and the Vale of Cashmere had also been re-landscaped. Also part of the renovation was a restoration of the Prospect Park Carousel from 1971 to 1974, and the exterior of the Boathouse was restored in 1979.

By the 1970s, Prospect Park was beset by crime; a 1974 report found that 44 percent of city residents would warn people to stay away from the park under any circumstances. Much of Prospect Park suffered soil erosion and lack of maintenance caused the landscape to deteriorate. By 1979, park attendance dropped to two million, the lowest recorded level in the history of the park.

==== 1980s and 1990s ====
The mayoral administration of Ed Koch formed plans in 1980 to turn over the administration of the troubled Prospect Park Zoo to the Wildlife Conservation Society. Over the next seven years, the city invested $17 million in cleaning up the park, including $10 million in federal funds from a Community Development Block Grant. Annual visitor numbers had nearly tripled to 5 million between 1980 and 1987. During this period, Prospect Park also received two historic designations: it was made a New York City scenic landmark on November 25, 1975, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 17, 1980.

The Prospect Park Alliance, a non-profit organization, was created in April 1987 based on the model of the Central Park Conservancy, which had helped restore Central Park in the 1980s. Shortly afterward, NYC Parks began entering into restoration projects with the organization. The Alliance&#x27;s first major project was the $550,000 restoration of the Carousel in 1987–1989. The carousel had not operated since 1983, and its original horse-shaped seats were removed during the restoration. Nine years later, in 1996, it started a $4.5 million restoration of the Ravine. The Boathouse was also restored again in the late 1990s due to deterioration of the exterior terracotta. The National Audubon Society signed a lease for the Boathouse in 2000, and the building became the site of the nation&#x27;s first urban Audubon society. The restoration of the Harmony Playground and Bandshell was completed the same year. However, other parts of Prospect Park remained neglected, such as the eastern side of the park, where the surrounding community was generally poorer than the western side.

=== Early 21st century ===

==== 2000s and 2010s ====
By 2000, the Wollman Rink was deteriorating, and there was a need to replace it. The Alliance soon formed plans to restore Music Island and the original shoreline, both obliterated by the construction of the original rink in 1960. Several Moses-era playgrounds and the Bandshell were retained because their venues were popular. Original rustic summer houses were restored or recreated on the shores of Prospect Park Lake, along the Lullwater and in the Ravine. As part of the restoration plans, the Wollman Rink was to be replaced by two rinks in the new LeFrak Center, a year-round recreational facility. Work on the LeFrak Center began in 2009, and the Wollman Rink had been demolished by 2011. The Samuel J. and Ethel LeFrak Center at Lakeside was completed in December 2013 at a cost of $74 million. As part of the Wollman Rink&#x27;s replacement, plans for the restored Music Island were announced in 2009. The Chaim Baier Music Island, and the Shelby White and Leon Levy Esplanade overlooking the island, were restored using a $10 million grant, and were officially rededicated in October 2012.

The Prospect Park Alliance subsequently completed or proposed more restoration projects for the park. Long Meadow ball field 1 was rebuilt between 2013 and 2014. The following year, the Alliance announced some projects on Prospect Park&#x27;s eastern side, including the $200,000 restoration of Battle Pass. The Alliance also intended to restore the water-damaged Oriental Pavilion for $2 million and replace fencing on Flatbush Avenue for $2.4 million. In 2016, the Alliance also received $3.2 million from NYC Parks&#x27; Parks Without Borders program to construct two new entrances on Flatbush Avenue, the park&#x27;s first new entrances in over 70 years, as well as rebuild the Willink entrance. During the city&#x27;s 2016 fiscal year, which ended June 30, 2016, politicians also contributed funds toward various restoration projects in the park. These included $2.5 million for renovating Lefferts Historic House, $2 million to rebuild pathways, $1.75 million for replacing fencing on Ocean Avenue, $750,000 for renovating the ballfields on Long Meadow, and $500,000 for the Carousel&#x27;s restoration. In addition, $100,000 was earmarked for the installation of an experimental running surface on Park Drive, and through a participatory budgeting program, residents of the surrounding communities allocated funds for other projects such as new drinking fountains, a dog run, community barbecue sites, and an aquatic weed harvester. Also in 2016, as part of a project to repair damage caused by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, the Prospect Park Alliance used goats to clean up the shrubbery in woodlands around the Vale of Cashmere, then re-landscaped the sites at a cost of $727,000.

The Well House, located on the Lake, reopened in 2017 as a composting restroom, and the Dog Beach along the watercourse&#x27;s Upper Pool was renovated. The same year, the Alliance received funds to renovate the Parade Ground, the Tennis House, and ball fields. The Alliance also announced an upcoming renovation of the Rose Garden. Ball fields 6 and 7 were renovated and reopened in 2017, while ball fields 4 and 5 reopened in late 2020. Construction started on the Flatbush Avenue fence repairs in 2018, and the new entrances were slated to start construction in early 2019. Construction of a dog run in the Parade Ground also started in August 2019, and the dog run opened in July 2020. In addition, Amanda Williams and Olalekan Jeyifous were selected in 2019 to design &quot;Our Destiny, Our Democracy&quot;, a monument near the Ocean and Parkside Avenue entrance.

==== 2020s ====
The Concert Grove Pavilion reopened in April 2021 after a one-year renovation. That December, a $40 million renovation of the Vale of Cashmere was announced. The last two ball fields on Long Meadow reopened in early 2023 after several years of renovations. During mid-2023, the New York City government considered erecting tents in Prospect Park to temporarily house asylum seekers. The Prospect Park Alliance reopened Fallkill Falls to the public in October 2023; prior to Fallkill Falls&#x27; reopening, trespassers regularly accessed it. The organization announced in January 2024 that an abandoned comfort station at the Ocean and Parkside Avenue entrance would be converted into a welcome center named for Shirley Chisholm, which was expected to open in two years. A cafe opened in the Prospect Park Boathouse that July. During the November 2024 wildfire outbreak in the northeast U.S., a fire broke out in the park, damaging of woodland. Afterward, the Prospect Park Alliance estimated that it would cost $200,000 to restore the burned forest.

==Geography==

Prospect Park occupies in central Brooklyn. It is bound by Prospect Park West and the neighborhood of Park Slope to the northwest; Prospect Park Southwest and the Windsor Terrace neighborhood to the southwest and west; Parkside Avenue, Ocean Avenue, Flatbush Avenue, and the neighborhood of Flatbush to the south and southeast; and Grand Army Plaza and the neighborhood of Prospect Heights to the north.

=== Design ===
Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux engineered Prospect Park to recreate in real space the pastoral, picturesque, and aesthetic ideals expressed in contemporary paintings. The overall design was inspired partially by Birkenhead Park in the United Kingdom. Prospect Park had recent precedents in the pastoral style, notably Mount Auburn Cemetery near Boston and Green-Wood Cemetery a few blocks away. Olmsted and Vaux felt they had greater success in Brooklyn because of the lack of obstacles there, but they were also assisted in part by park commissioner James Stranahan&#x27;s patronage and support of their plan.

The two designers wanted visitors to be able to traverse Prospect Park with a myriad of perspectives so that the features could be enjoyed in any order. Olmsted was more involved with the general design of Prospect Park, while Vaux was more involved with specific details. They created the large Long Meadow out of hilly upland pasture interspersed with peat bogs. They also moved and planted trees, hauled topsoil and created a vast unfolding turf with trees placed both separately and in groups. The designers wanted Lookout Hill to be a place of broad views out over Prospect Lake, the farmland beyond, and the bay and ocean in the distance. To create an illusion of an expansive space, Olmsted and Vaux designed the paths in Prospect Park to be meandering.

=== Layout ===
In Olmsted and Vaux&#x27;s final plan for the park, it was divided into three distinct zones: an open section, a wooded section, and a waterside section. The Parade Ground at the far southwestern corner was excluded from the system of zones.

The first zone consisted of the Long Meadow, a wide open space along the west side of the park. It contains two entrances through tunnels: Meadowport Arch and Endale Arch. The Third Street Playground, Harmony Playground, bandshell, and the picnic and tennis houses are also located here. West Drive traverses this section of Prospect Park.

The second zone is the wooded area in the middle of the park and contains the headwaters of the park&#x27;s watercourse. In this zone, on the northeast side of the park, there are several points of interest: the Ravine, the Vale of Cashmere, the Rose Garden, the Zucker Natural Exploration Area, and the Prospect Park Zoo. The area contains the Nethermead Arch, an elaborate triple-span bridge. Quaker Hill and the Friends Cemetery are located near the southwest boundary of Prospect Park. Lookout Hill, as well as a large open space called the Nethermead, are located to the south and east of Quaker Hill, respectively. The Ravine also contains the Midwood, an old-growth forest incorporated into Prospect Park during its construction.

The third zone is along the park&#x27;s south side and consists of Prospect Lake, as well as a peninsula jutting eastward from the lake&#x27;s northern shore. It is the outlet for the Lullwater, a meandering stream. The Lullwater contains the classical-style Boathouse, a city- and federally-designated landmark, on the Lullwater&#x27;s eastern shore. To the south, along the lake&#x27;s eastern shore, are the White Levy Esplanade, as well as the LeFrak Center at Lakeside, a multipurpose recreation center. The LeFrak Center at Lakeside consists of a pair of one-story structures, which share a planted roof. The rink&#x27;s ceiling contains abstract light-colored streaks on a blue background, which are intended to represent skaters&#x27; movements. Also part of the LeFrak Center is a building with a cafe, offices, and event space.

Parkside Avenue, a roughly west–east street, divides the southwestern part of Prospect Park from the rest of the park. This detached sliver of parkland is bounded by Parkside Avenue to the north, Coney Island Avenue to the west, Caton Avenue to the south, and Parade Place to the east. It contains the Parade Ground, which has fifteen numbered courts and fields for various sports.

== Landscape features ==
=== Watercourse ===

All of the waterways in Prospect Park are part of a single man-made watercourse. A winding naturalistic stream channel with several ponds feeds a lake at the south end of the park. In designing the watercourse, Olmsted and Vaux also took advantage of the preexisting glacier-formed kettle ponds and lowland outwash plains to create a drainage basin centered around the waterway. They crafted the watercourse to include a steep, forested Ravine with significant river edge flora and fauna habitats. As a result, the watercourse is able to accommodate significant bird and fish populations.

Much of the watercourse is lined with vegetation that is designed to absorb precipitation and additional water flow. Olmsted also included an expansive drainage system, which is still in use and extends under the Long Meadow, Ravine, and Nethermead. About two-thirds of Prospect Park Lake&#x27;s water typically evaporates. However, to prevent flooding after heavy precipitation, Prospect Park employees can control the outflow of water from the lake using a valve.

By the mid-20th century, these artificial waterways and the steep slopes around them had lost their original design character. In 1994, the Prospect Park Alliance launched a 25-year $43-million restoration project for the watercourse.

==== Smaller waterways ====
The water in Prospect Park originates at the top of Fallkill Falls in the center of the park, just north of Quaker Hill and east of Long Meadow. The Well House on the north side of the Lake originally provided the water for the watercourse, and was connected to an underground aquifer. The Well House became outdated when Prospect Park was connected to the New York City water supply system in the early 20th century. By the 21st century, Fallkill Falls was fed by a pipe from the city&#x27;s water system.
The water from Fallkill Falls runs into Fallkill Pool, past the Fallkill Bridge, through the Upper Pool and Lower Pool, where migratory birds rest and marsh and other water plants can be found. The Upper Pool abuts a dog beach, while the Long Meadow is adjacent to the Lower Pool. The water then passes under the Esdale Bridge, a footbridge over Ambergill Pond. The pond, and the Ambergill Falls just past it, was named by Olmsted and refers to the Old Norse word for &quot;creek&quot;. After passing through Ambergill Falls, the water flows under Rock Arch Bridge and past the Ravine, entering the Binnenwater, which is named after a Dutch word for &quot;within&quot;. The waters then cascade beneath the Binnen Bridge to the Lullwater, a small pond that contains the Boathouse on its eastern bank. The water then flows under the Lullwater and Terrace bridges to the Peninsula, which is managed both as bird sanctuary and recreational field.

==== Lake ====

The mouth of Prospect Park&#x27;s watercourse is the artificial, 60-acre Prospect Lake (also known as Prospect Park Lake). Prospect Lake includes several islands and is home to over 20 species of fish. Every year, the lake hosts the R.H. Macy&#x27;s Fishing Contest, a tradition that dates to 1947. Though NYC Parks generally allows licensed anglers to fish, it maintains a catch and release policy to prevent depletion of the fish population. In addition, visitors may explore the lake in kayaks and pedal boats, available at the LeFrak Center at Lakeside, or the &quot;Independence,&quot; a replica of the original electric launch which took day-trippers around the lake in the 20th century. On the shore of the lake, there are several &quot;rustic shelters&quot; that provide scenic views of the water.

Ice skating, popularized in Central Park, was a key reason for including Prospect Lake in the design of the park&#x27;s watercourse. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, red balls raised on the fronts of trolley cars signified that the ice was at least four inches thick. Red flags were also placed at Grand Army Plaza to indicate the ice&#x27;s sufficient thickness. Later, green flags were used to indicate that the ice was thick enough, and red flags indicated that the ice was too thin. Since then, safety concerns have ended skating on the lake; as a result of climate change, winters have become warmer in the 21st century compared to the 19th century, the ice on the lake has become too thin to accommodate skaters. Ice skating moved to the Kate Wollman Rink in 1960, and again to the Lakeside Center in 2012.

===The Ravine===
A section of Prospect Park&#x27;s interior is known as the Ravine. The region contains the headwaters of the park&#x27;s water system, as well as Brooklyn&#x27;s only remaining old-growth forest, the Midwood. Olmsted and Vaux saw the Ravine as the heart of Prospect Park and the centerpiece of mountainous tableaux similar to the Adirondack Mountains, and designed it in a similar fashion to their Ramble in Central Park. The perimeter of the area is a steep, narrow gorge. The watercourse goes through the Ravine en route to the Boathouse.

The original design of the Ravine was more aesthetic than functional, and decades of deferred maintenance had degraded the Ravine and made it hard to drain. During the 1970s, the brush was trimmed in order to make it harder for muggers to hide, and by the 1990s, the stream had dried up. In 1996, still recovering from decades of overuse that caused soil compaction and erosion, the Ravine and surrounding woodlands underwent a $4.5 million restoration. The Ravine was opened for tours two years later. By 2002, part of the Ravine had been restored and opened to the public.

Directly south of the Ravine is a meadow called the Nethermead, which occupies much of the space along the western bank of the watercourse between Center and Wellhouse Drive. To the southwest of the Nethermead is Lookout Hill, which occupies the remaining area between Center and Wellhouse Drives.

=== Long Meadow ===

The Long Meadow stretches down the western side of Prospect Park. The meadow contains two playgrounds, the Tennis House, the Picnic House, a bandshell, a dog beach, and NYC Parks maintenance facilities. In a contrast with the Ravine and the watercourse, the Long Meadow is mostly flat open space. As designed, it provided a visual buffer between the neighborhoods to the west and the interior of the park. During construction, Olmsted laid out hundreds of trees in meticulous patterns around the meadow.

Originally, the Long Meadow hosted sports such as archery, croquet, bowling, football, baseball, and tennis. To preserve the meadow&#x27;s pastoral quality, sheep grazed on the meadow until the 1930s. Today, much of the Long Meadow is used for a variety of purposes. The southern part of the Long Meadow contains seven baseball fields.

== Fauna and flora ==

, Prospect Park had 30,000 trees, comprising around 200 unique species. With few exceptions, the trees in Prospect Park were mostly planted manually. In its earliest years, Prospect Park had maintained a nursery of trees and plants, from which over a hundred thousand specimens were eventually taken. Now, Prospect Park Alliance regularly maintains the park&#x27;s flora, removing invasive species and adding native plants. Prospect Park contains four &quot;great trees&quot; that are specially recognized by NYC Parks. These include a Camperdown Elm south of the Boathouse, among the first planted in the United States; an American Hornbeam and a Japanese Pagodatree located near the Camperdown Elm; and an English Elm along West Drive. In late 2011, an oak tree was planted in the park as a memorial to Brooklyn native Peter Steele, a member of the band Type O Negative who had died in 2010.

Prospect Park also accommodates a significant bird population. Each year, hundreds of migratory bird species stop at the park, and during winters, urban birdwatchers have reported seeing 60 unique species at the park on a good day, and 100 unique species over a typical season. Over the years, a total of 298 species have been recorded at Prospect Park, including 11 not seen at other city parks. Though there are no official lists of birds that have been seen at the park, the Brooklyn Bird Club has kept records of the avian species seen there between 1967 and 1990. Popular spots for birds included Lookout and Quaker Hills, the Ravine, the Vale of Cashmere, and Lily Pond.

There are other fauna species in Prospect Park as well. In particular, the watercourse includes waterfowl, turtles, bullfrogs, fish, and crustacean species. In addition, squirrels are commonly seen in the park&#x27;s trees. Sightings of butterflies are also common, and since the 1990s and 2000s, increasing numbers of bats have been seen in Prospect Park.

== Landmarks and structures ==
=== Plazas and entrances ===

Prospect Park is shaped roughly like a concave hexagon. There are three circles or plazas on the exterior corners of Prospect Park; all of these circles and plazas contain &quot;major&quot; park entrances.

====Major entrances====
Grand Army Plaza is an oval plaza at the northern corner, at the junction of Prospect Park West, Flatbush Avenue, Eastern Parkway, and several side streets. Olmsted and Vaux had intended for the plaza to be the park&#x27;s main entrance, and it was constructed along with the park during the late 1860s. Grand Army Plaza&#x27;s largest feature is the Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Arch, a large triumphal arch in the center of the oval, which was dedicated in 1892. The plaza also includes four Doric columns, built 1894–1896; the &quot;Bailey Fountain&quot;, constructed 1929–1932 on the site of two former fountains; and several statues of famous figures.

Bartel-Pritchard Square, which is actually a circle, is at the far western corner of Prospect Park, at the junction of Prospect Park West and Southwest, where they turn into Ninth Avenue and 15th Street respectively. Dedicated with its present name in 1923, it is named after Brooklyn residents Emil Bartel and William Pritchard, who died in combat during World War I. The park entrance from the square was designed by Stanford White in 1896.

Machate Circle is at the southwestern corner, at the junction of Prospect Park West, Ocean Parkway, and Parkside Avenue. Originally named Park Circle, it was renamed in 1989 in honor of a police officer killed in the line of duty. The park entrance from Machate Circle was also designed by Stanford White.

Additional &quot;major&quot; entrances exist at the Parade Ground, on the park&#x27;s south side; Parkside and Ocean Avenues, at the park&#x27;s southeast corner; and Willink Hill, at Flatbush and Ocean Avenues on the eastern border. The Ocean/Parkside and Willink entrances were designed in the neoclassical style by McKim, Mead and White, and were built in the 1890s and 1900s. The Willink entrance is flanked by a pair of granite turrets, while the Ocean/Parkside entrance is located between the two portions of a curved granite colonnade. Opposite the Willink entrance, there are the Flatbush Trees, three concrete cylinders with green sheet metal canopies, installed in 1979 and redecorated in 2015.

====Other entrances====
There are numerous other entrances spaced out along the park&#x27;s border. These include five entrances on Prospect Park West, four on Prospect Park Southwest, and three on Ocean Avenue on the park&#x27;s eastern border. In total, there are eighteen park entrances. Of these, the Third, Ninth, and 16th Street and Lincoln Road entrances are considered &quot;major entrances&quot;, and are flanked by memorials or other decorations. No entrances to Prospect Park have been built since the 1940s, but two entrances were proposed for the Flatbush Avenue side in 2016 and are expected to be completed in mid-2020.

=== Bridges ===
==== Arches ====

Prospect Park originally included several arched bridges to provide grade-separated crossings for pedestrian and vehicular traffic; usually, the vehicular drive was located on top of the arch, and the pedestrian path was below. This contrasted with other parks at the time, which did not contain such separations. The arches were designed to be as small and natural-looking as possible so they did not interfere with the scenery. For the most part, the spaces under the arches were originally outfitted with benches, while the arches themselves blended with the foliage. Five arched bridges were ultimately built, all during the late 1860s and early 1870s.

Endale Arch, also known as Enterdale Arch, is located under East Drive, slightly south of the Grand Army Plaza entrance on the north side of the park, and adjacent to the northeast side of Long Meadow. It was one of the first two arches to be completed, in 1868. Its exterior contained interspersed yellow Ohio sandstone and red New Jersey brownstone. The interior was composed of brick set between alternately black and yellow wooden stripes, designed as such to prevent condensation from dripping downward. Endale Arch contained seats underneath it, but these were later removed. In 2014, the Prospect Park Alliance began a five-year restoration of the arch, which was completed in 2020.

East Wood Arch (or Eastwood Arch) is also located under East Drive, connecting the Nethermead Arch to the Willink Hill entrance on the eastern side of Prospect Park. It was the second of the two arches to be completed in 1868. East Wood Arch had a similar design to the Endale Arch, but had a simpler semicircular shape.

Meadowport Arch is located on the northwest side of Long Meadow and passes under West Drive. It was completed in 1870. There were two portals at its eastern end, perpendicular to each other, creating a cross-vault. The arch had Ohio sandstone and wooden lining inside, and the portals contained circular cornices, outward-facing piers, and octagonal domed finials. Meadowport Arch was restored in the 1980s, but has since fallen into disrepair.

Nethermead Arch, also completed 1870, carries Center Drive through the center of the park. The bridge contains three arches: one each above the Ambergill, the park path, and the bridle path. The span is made of Ohio sandstone and contains a trim of granite. Unlike some of the other arches, Nethermead did not have any interior wood, but instead, had patterned red brick. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described its triple span as &quot;one of the most astonishing structures in any city park&quot;.

Cleft Ridge Span is located under Wellhouse Drive, at Breeze Hill, on the eastern side of Prospect Park. It was the final arch span to be opened, in 1872. The span was distinctive in its use of red, ochre, and pale gray concrete blocks called &quot;Béton Coignet&quot;. Cleft Ridge might have been the first concrete arch span in the United States. Both the interior and exterior designs were elaborate, though these have since eroded.

==== Other spans ====

Lullwater Bridge and Terrace Bridge are the only bridges across the watercourse that were built to handle automobile traffic. Lullwater Bridge is located just downstream of the Boathouse, on Prospect Park&#x27;s eastern side. The current metal span, built in 1905, replaces an oak bridge on the site that was originally constructed in 1868. Further downstream, Terrace Bridge carries Well House Drive over the watercourse just before it empties into the lake. Built in 1890, Terrace Bridge also replaced an earlier wooden span, and it contains cast-iron tracery and brick vaults underneath, which have since deteriorated. It was so named because it was supposed to overlook the unbuilt Refectory, which had been canceled following the 1873 financial crisis.

From northwest to southeast, the Fallkill, Esdale, Nethermead Arch, Rock Arch, Music Grove, and Binnen Bridges also cross the watercourse upstream of the Lullwater Bridge. Fallkill, Esdale, and Rock Arch Bridges are located northwest of Nethermead Arch, while Music Grove and Binnen Bridges are located southeast of the arch. At the source of the watercourse, Fallkill and Esdale Bridges are both intended to look like wooden bridges, though are made of steel and concrete frames. Rock Arch Bridge, a boulder-lined span, crosses over Ambergill Falls; the waterfall had once been buried by the bridge&#x27;s stonework, but was restored in the late 20th century when the bridge was rehabilitated. To the south, Binnen Bridge and Music Grove Bridge were both designed as wood bridges. Binnen Bridge is located just north of the Lullwater, while Music Grove Bridge further upstream is located next to the Music Pagoda.

=== Drives and paths ===
When it was built, Prospect Park did not have any transverse roadways. Instead, it was circled by a series of four scenic drives, named West, Center, Wellhouse, and East Drive. The drives are paralleled by a more extensive system of pedestrian and bridle paths. Several paths in the park, as well as East Drive, follow ancient Native American trails.

The drives were originally wide and paved with gravel. The main loop, composed of West and East Drives, meanders around the park just inside its boundaries. The loops were paved with asphalt and opened to automobiles in 1918. Over the following decades, the hours at which vehicles could use the park were slowly restricted. Supporters of a car ban argued that the park should be a haven from the type of city stress that automobiles represent, and that having them use the park sacrifices the safety of those using the park for recreation, while opponents worried that banning traffic in the park would increase traffic outside. The park&#x27;s West Drive was closed to traffic in 2015. Following a trial run in which the park was car-free during summer 2017, the city determined that there were no major effects on nearby routes, and cars were barred completely from the park beginning in January 2018. All of the drives are designated as protected bike lanes.

There are also four hiking trails inside Prospect Park: the Lullwater, Midwood, Peninsula, and Waterfall trails. They range in length from , and NYC Parks classifies all of the trails as &quot;easy&quot;. The trails are named after the section of the park where they are located.

=== Monuments and statues ===

Prospect Park contains dozens of monuments and statues to notable figures, including:
* A bronze statue of Abraham Lincoln, sculpted by Henry Kirke Brown in 1869. Originally situated in Grand Army Plaza, it was relocated to the Concert Grove in Prospect Park in 1896, and restored in the late 1980s. With the Concert Grove&#x27;s restoration in the 2010s, it was proposed to move the statue back to its original position, but , it was still located in the Concert Grove.
* A bronze-on-marble statue of James S.T. Stranahan, sculpted by Frederick MacMonnies and located near the Grand Army Plaza entrance. It was dedicated in 1891 and honors Stranahan, one of the key figures in the park&#x27;s development.
* The Lafayette Memorial, a bas-relief on granite at the Ninth Street entrance on the park&#x27;s west side. The monument, which honors Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, was sculpted by Daniel Chester French and was completed in 1917.
* The Maryland Monument, a Corinthian column near Terrace Bridge. It was created by Stanford White and dedicated in 1895. The column commemorates the Maryland 400, members of the 1st Maryland Regiment who charged British forces on Lookout Hill in the Battle of Long Island during the American Revolution, despite being outnumbered.
* The Prospect Park War Memorial, along the eastern shore of the lake. Sculpted by Henry Augustus Lukeman, it was dedicated in 1921. The memorial consists of two bronze figures in front of a curved wall with memorial plaques, containing the names of 2,800 people who died during World War I.
* Monuments to classical composers, including Beethoven, Mozart, and von Weber, in Concert Grove. The surrounding area also contains tributes to poet Thomas Moore, writer Washington Irving, and classical composer Edvard Grieg.
* A proposed monument of Shirley Chisholm at the Parkside and Ocean Avenues entrance. It will be designed by artists Amanda Williams and Olalekan Jeyifous.

=== Notable structures ===
==== West side and Long Meadow ====

The Picnic House is located in Long Meadow on Prospect Park&#x27;s west side. Built in 1927, it replaced an earlier rustic structure that had burned down the previous year. The structure was designed by J. Sarsfield Kennedy.

The Litchfield Villa is located near the intersection of 5th Street and Prospect Park West, directly west of the Picnic House. The building was originally a private residence built in 1854–1857 in the Italianate style. NYC Parks has used Litchfield Villa as a maintenance and office building since the late 19th century. The villa was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1977. A garage compound used by NYC Parks abuts the villa directly to the south.

The Tennis House, constructed in 1909–1910 by Helmle, Hudswell and Huberty, is located on the Long Meadow at West Drive, west of approximately 8th Street. The structure is a neoclassical structure made of limestone and brick, with a red tile roof. It was first used as a locker room for tennis players, but later was converted into a non-public NYC Parks facility. By the 2000s, the structure had become dilapidated. In 2017, it was announced that the Tennis House would be renovated and converted into restrooms as part of a $5.1 million, four-year project.

Roughly southeast of the Tennis House is the Dog Beach, on the western shore of the Fallkill section of the watercourse. It is often used by dogs and their owners during summers, since Prospect Park has an &quot;off-leash&quot; policy that allows unleashed dogs during early mornings and late evenings. The beach was restored in 2017.

At 10th Street, to the west of West Drive, is the Harmony Playground and Bandshell. The bandshell, designed by Aymar Embury II, was built in 1939 on the site of a former &quot;zoological site&quot;, which was used for archery and hockey. The bandshell and the adjacent playground were restored in 2000 and given a musical theme. In June 2021, the Prospect Park Bandshell was renamed the Lena Horne Bandshell to honor Lena Horne, a successful entertainer and Brooklyn native, as well as to show solidarity with the black community. The bandshell hosts numerous concerts every summer through the BRIC Celebrate Brooklyn! festival.

==== Northeast side ====
The Rose Garden is located next to Flatbush Avenue, on the north side of Prospect Park southwest of the Grand Army Plaza entrance. It was built on the site of the Playground, a lawn that had been the first part of Prospect Park to open. During the late 19th and early 20th century, the garden had roses and a goldfish pond. The Rose Garden was renovated in the 1960s, after which the garden did not host any roses. In 2017, the Prospect Park Alliance announced plans to restore the garden, and in the meantime, it placed 7,000 pinwheels in an effort to attract visitors.

To the west, adjacent to the Rose Garden, is another garden called the Vale of Cashmere. The garden was named after Thomas Moore&#x27;s poem &quot;Lalla Rookh&quot;, which in turn referred to Kashmir in what was then northern India. The Vale of Cashmere was once used frequently by the well-to-do. It contains a fountain that originally had a sculpture of a nude youth and six turtles in the center, though the sculpture was stolen in 1941. The Vale became overgrown during the 20th century, and its fountain was abandoned. The Vale of Cashmere later became a popular spot for gay cruising, as documented in the book &quot;In the Vale of Cashmere&quot; by Thomas Roma. The woods around the vale were damaged in 2012 during Hurricane Sandy and were subsequently restored.

The Prospect Park Zoo occupies a plot slightly south of the Rose Garden across Flatbush Avenue from Brooklyn Botanic Garden. The zoo was opened in 1935 and has been operated by the Wildlife Conservation Society since 1980. , Prospect Park Zoo had 864 animals representing 176 species.

==== East side ====

The oldest structure in Prospect Park, the Lefferts Historic House, is located south of the zoo, near the intersection of Ocean Avenue, Flatbush Avenue, and Empire Boulevard. It was built in 1783 and was originally located near the Willink Hill entrance. The structure was relocated in 1920 to make way for the Willink entrance. The house is a New York City designated landmark and operates as a children&#x27;s museum of Brooklyn family life during the 19th century.

The Prospect Park Carousel is located immediately west of the Lefferts Historic House. The carousel contains 53 horses, created by master horse carver Charles Carmel in 1912, as well as three carvings of other animals and two chariots. The carousel opened in October 1952, superseding another carousel that had burned down over twenty years earlier. It was subsequently restored from 1971 to 1974, and again from 1987 to 1989. Prior to the opening of the current carousel, three separate wooden carousels had been built throughout the park&#x27;s history, and were located in different parts of the park.

The Willink Hill entrance contains the neoclassical Willink Entrance Comfort Station. The structure opened in 1912 and is designed similarly to the Tennis House.

Further south of the Willink entrance is the Boathouse on the Lullwater, on the Lullwater&#x27;s eastern shore. Built in 1905–1907, it was the first structure in the park built by McKim, Mead and White, and was also constructed in the neoclassical style. After being saved from destruction in 1964, it was listed on the NRHP in 1972.

South of the Boathouse, past the Cleft Ridge Arch, is the Concert Grove, located on the northeast edge of the Lake. Originally built in 1847, it was designed so park patrons could hear music being played on the later-demolished Music Island. The grove&#x27;s style complements that of the Central Park Mall but was laid out radially. The grove also contains busts of classical composers. A statue of Abraham Lincoln is located at the Concert Grove. In the middle of the grove is the Concert Grove Pavilion, also known as the Oriental Pavilion, measuring with a roof and columns in a Middle Eastern or Indian style; it formerly served as a restaurant but has since fallen into disrepair. In 2021, the Concert Grove Pavilion was restored.

The Samuel J. and Ethel LeFrak Center at Lakeside is located immediately south of the Concert Grove. It was completed in December 2013 and replaces the former Wollman Rink. The multipurpose, year-round facility is used for ice-skating, boating, biking, and roller-skating, as well as winter sports such as hockey and curling. The LeFrak Center accommodates over 200,000 visitors annually.

==== Nethermead and Lookout Hill ====
The Music Pagoda is located in the Nethermead, on the east side of the park along the watercourse&#x27;s west shore. The original pagoda, built in 1887, was a wooden structure with an octagonal roof and a stone base. It replaced a &quot;temporary&quot; music stand near the Lullwood. The Music Pagoda was used for concerts until it burned down in 1968. The current pagoda on the site is a re-creation of the original, built in 1971.

The Well House is located on the northern shore of the Lake, abutting the southern slope of Lookout Hill on the southwestern side of Prospect Park. It was the last structure in the park to be built by Olmsted and Vaux, having been built in 1869. It was made of gray stone and brick, and featured a hip roof and a doorway inside a Tudor arch. The house initially contained machinery that powered Prospect Park&#x27;s watercourse, and at one point, pumped of water into the watercourse each day. The water from the Well House was drawn from a well, which led to the Brooklyn Aquifer. Originally, there was a smokestack behind the Well House, as well as a cistern in front of the building. The machines became obsolete in the early 20th century when Prospect Park was connected to New York City&#x27;s municipal water system. Subsequently, the tower was demolished and the cistern was filled in. In 2017, the Well House was restored and turned into a composting restroom.

==== South side ====

The Prospect Park Peristyle, also known as the Grecian Shelter or Croquet Shelter, is located on the southwest corner of the park, south of the Lake. Constructed by McKim, Mead and White in 1905, this peristyle was built on the site of the 1860s-era Promenade Drive Shelter. The Prospect Park Peristyle is actually designed in the Renaissance architectural style and consists of a rectangular colonnade with Corinthian columns. It was rehabilitated in 1966 and listed on the NRHP in 1972.

=== Former structures ===

The Dairy Cottage, or &quot;the Dairy&quot;, was located near Boulder Bridge west of the zoo. It was a two-story stone cottage with two gabled wings; a public room and women&#x27;s quarters on the first floor; and a single residence on the second floor. The Dairy was built in 1869 or 1871 to sell fresh milk and other light refreshments to the public; a similar building was also built in Central Park. At the time, sheep and cows were allowed to pasture on the meadows of Prospect Park, and seven cows were purchased specifically to provide milk. However, according to the &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot;, news articles after 1879 do not make a mention of the Dairy providing milk. The cottage later became part of the Menagerie, the precursor to the modern-day zoo, and was encircled by several other zoo buildings to its north and east. All of these buildings were demolished in 1935 when the zoo was built.

There were two unusual structures built in Prospect Park in its early years. The first was a camera obscura booth located on Breeze Hill&#x27;s western slope, at the east end of the park, built in the early 1880s. The second was the Circular Yacht or Rotary Yacht, a floating carousel with yacht-shaped vehicles. Located near the Long Meadow, the Circular Yacht was constructed by inventor David Smith in 1878 and could hold up to 220 people at once. These structures were both demolished before the 1900s, and the camera obscura later became the site of the now-demolished Old Fashioned Flower Garden.

The park contained a Music Island near the east shore of the Lake. The island was used by musicians who were performing for audiences in the nearby Concert Grove. It was demolished in 1960 to make way for the Wollman Rink. Following the rink&#x27;s demolition in the early 2010s, a replica of the island was constructed, and it opened in 2012. Across the Lake, two structures were built on the peninsula in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Model Yacht Club House, built on the south side of the peninsula in 1900, was an octagonal wood-frame clubhouse that burned down in a fire in 1956. On the opposite or northern side of the peninsula, there was another shelter, similar in design to the Concert Grove Pavilion, which lasted from 1915 to around the 1940s.

On the west side of Prospect Park, there was a conservatory on the Long Meadow. It consisted of sixteen greenhouses located near Seventh Street and Prospect Park West. Though it was a popular visitor attraction, it was supplanted by the Brooklyn Botanic Garden past the park&#x27;s eastern edge. The conservatory&#x27;s greenhouses were renovated in 1929–1930, but the cost of upkeep soon became exorbitant. In 1955, the greenhouses were considered redundant and were demolished. At that point, the conservatory&#x27;s main attraction was an annual Easter flower show.

== Recreation ==
There are numerous sports hosted in Prospect Park, and specialized facilities exist for several sports. Seven baseball fields are located in the Long Meadow between 9th and 15th Streets. Two are major league-sized fields serving older age groups, while the other five are slightly smaller and intended for younger children, typically 8–12 years old. In the winter, ice skating, cross-country skiing, figure skating, curling, hockey, and tennis are provided in the LeFrak Center at Lakeside. The LeFrak Center also accommodates boating and biking. The Parade Ground also contains a variety of fields for several sports.

Runners also use the trails and drives of Prospect Park. The pedestrian lanes of East Drive and West Drive form an paved loop. The Prospect Park Track Club, formed in 1970, organizes regular training runs and races in and around the park. Reporting over 2,000 members, Prospect Park Track Club records itself as one of the largest running clubs in Brooklyn . Organizations including NYCRUNS and the New York Road Runners also host road running races in the park. This includes the New York City Half Marathon which, since 2018, has been run from Prospect Park to Central Park. NYCRUNS&#x27;s Brooklyn Marathon was first hosted in 2011, with a course that initially consisted of eight laps around Prospect Park; in 2022, the marathon adopted a new course that crossed Brooklyn and passed through the park.

Other sports are also played in Prospect Park. The Prospect Park Women&#x27;s Softball League has been playing softball games on summer evenings in Prospect Park since 1973. Circle rules football is also played seasonally inside the park. Since the 1930s, the nearby Kensington Stables has hosted horse-riding lessons in Prospect Park. Pedalboating is also open to the public on the lake. Prospect Park&#x27;s rolling hills also accommodate sledding during the winters.

The Bandshell hosts frequent concerts, most notably the &quot;Celebrate Brooklyn!&quot; Performing Arts Festival, a series of summer concerts founded in 1979 that draws performing artists from around the world. The festival is produced by BRIC Arts Media Bklyn.

=== Parade Ground ===
The site of the present-day Parade Ground, at Prospect Park&#x27;s southwest corner, was first proposed in 1866 and was to be used for training militia. The state approved the acquisition of a rectangular area just south of Parkside Avenue and handed control of the plot to the Prospect Park commissioners. The Parade Ground was designated to be used for sports and military drills. It was set apart from the main section of the park in fear that the high level of activity would damage the grass and plants and disrupt the park&#x27;s pastoral feel. Initially, the Parade Ground contained a long, wood-frame building, which included a two-story pavilion for officers&#x27; quarters, as well as a restroom to the south and a guard room to the north. Other uses included a gathering on June 15, 1927, when the Parade Ground attracted over 200,000 people to greet pioneering aviator Charles Lindbergh.

The militia no longer use the Parade Ground, but the plot is still an active athletic complex. In its present form, the Parade Ground has fifteen numbered courts and fields, used for soccer, baseball, softball, basketball, and volleyball. They encompass the Prospect Park Tennis Center, four baseball diamonds, two softball fields, a football field, a soccer field, basketball and volleyball courts, the Paul Ricard Pétanque Court and three giant multi-use fields. The Stewart Playground is also on the east side of the Parade Ground.

Many Major League Baseball stars got their start at the Parade Ground, including Joe Torre and Sandy Koufax. In 2003, the Parade Ground had a netball court installed next to the basketball courts. The next year, the Parade Ground underwent a $12.4 million restoration. The netball court was replaced by an outdoor adult fitness center in 2019, due to a lack of use, and a dog run in the Parade Ground opened in 2020.

== Management ==
A nonprofit organization called Prospect Park Alliance manages Prospect Park, while NYC Parks owns and operates the land and facilities. The Alliance&#x27;s responsibilities include maintaining and restoring natural and recreational areas, as well as providing educational and cultural programs. In the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, the Alliance had net assets (own equity) of about $37.2 million and liabilities of $3.1 million, which amounted to total assets of $40.3 million. Net assets increased $5.9 million from the fiscal year ending June 30, 2021.

Prior to the Prospect Park Alliance&#x27;s founding, there was no private maintenance of the park. The Alliance was created in April 1987 after the city had spent $10 million in federal funds to renovate the park in the early 1980s. The Alliance subsequently started new programs to reach out to the surrounding communities, and its renovation programs caused housing prices in the area to increase by the 1990s.

== Transportation ==
There are four New York City Subway stations that directly serve the park. The eastern side of Prospect Park is served by the park&#x27;s eponymous station () and the Parkside Avenue station (). The western side is served by 15th Street–Prospect Park (). Grand Army Plaza is served by the at the plaza&#x27;s eponymous station. Bus service is provided on the western side by the buses, the southwestern side by the bus; the eastern side by the buses; and the southern side by the B16 bus.

==Incidents==
===Animals===
During the 1970s, there were multiple incidents involving animal injuries or deaths at the Prospect Park Zoo. This included the scalding death of a monkey in 1975, allegedly by a zoo employee, as well as an acting zoo director who was accused of shooting at pigeons and killing zoo animals. A zoo employee also locked himself in a monkey enclosure for several hours in 1974 to protest the deaths of ten animals. These incidents, as well as several others at the Central Park Zoo, prompted protests by animal-rights groups who wanted to close the two zoos and move the animals to the larger Bronx Zoo. This directly led to the Wildlife Conservation Society&#x27;s takeover of the Prospect Park Zoo in 1980.

In May 1987, an 11-year-old boy climbed into the polar bear enclosure after hours at the Prospect Park Zoo and was subsequently mauled by two of the bears; both bears were then fatally shot by police officers. The incident contributed to the Wildlife Conservation Society&#x27;s decision to redesign the zoo to emphasize species more appropriate to its small size and to visitor interactions.

In July 2010, federal authorities captured 400 Canada geese in the park and gassed them to death due to air safety concerns brought up after the emergency landing of US Airways Flight 1549 in January 2009.

===Crimes and deaths===
Several murders have occurred in Prospect Park during its history. In August 1975, a 15-year-old recent graduate of Ditmas Junior High School, was strangled with a belt in a wooded area of the Vale of Cashmere. In June 1993, a 42-year-old man was shot to death while resisting a group of teenagers trying to steal his bicycle; the shooter received a maximum 25-year prison term. In April 2006, a 61-year-old man was found stabbed to death in the Vale of Cashmere. A 41-year-old homeless man was found beaten to death in a wooded area near a jogging path two years later, in June 2008. A 23-year-old man was fatally shot at the Parade Ground in March 2011, having recently been jailed on charges of being an accomplice in another man&#x27;s murder.

Other incidents have included the April 2018 suicide of lawyer and environmental activist David Buckel, who lit himself on fire to protest the use of fossil fuels.

<doc id="303860" wikidata="Q1064403" url="?curid=303860" title="Semicircular canals">
<text>The semicircular canals are three semicircular interconnected tubes located in the innermost part of each ear, the inner ear. The three canals are the lateral, anterior and posterior semicircular canals. They are the part of the bony labyrinth, a periosteum-lined cavity on the petrous part of the temporal bone filled with perilymph. 

Each semicircular canal contains its respective semicircular duct, i.e. the lateral, anterior and posterior semicircular ducts, which provide the sensation of angular acceleration and are part of the membranous labyrinth—therefore filled with endolymph.

==Structure==

The semicircular canals are a component of the bony labyrinth that are at right angles from each other and contain their respective semicircular duct. At one end of each of the semicircular ducts is a dilated sac called a membranous ampulla, which is more than twice the diameter of the ducts. Each ampulla contains an ampullary crest, the crista ampullaris which consists of a thick gelatinous cap called a cupula and many hair cells. The superior and posterior semicircular ducts are oriented vertically at right angles to each other. The lateral semicircular duct is about a 30-degree angle from the horizontal plane. The orientations of the ducts cause a different duct to be stimulated by movement of the head in different planes, and more than one duct is stimulated at once if the movement is off those planes. The lateral semicircular duct detects angular acceleration of the head when the head is turned and the anterior and posterior semicircular ducts detect vertical head movements when the head is moved up or down. When the head changes position, the endolymph in the ducts lags behind due to inertia and this acts on the cupula which bends the cilia of the hair cells. The stimulation of the hair cells sends the message to the brain that acceleration is taking place. The semicircular canals open into the vestibule by five orifices, one of the apertures being common to two of them.

Among species of mammals, the size of the semicircular canals is correlated with their type of locomotion. Specifically, species that are agile and have fast, jerky locomotion have larger canals relative to their body size than those that move more cautiously.

===Lateral semicircular canal===
The lateral semicircular canal (also known as horizontal or external semicircular canal) is the shortest of the three canals. Movement of fluid within its duct corresponds to rotation of the head around a vertical axis (i.e. the neck), or in other words, rotation in the transverse plane. This occurs, for example, when one turns the head from side to side (yaw axis).

It measures from , and its arch is directed horizontally backward and laterally; thus each semicircular canal stands at right angles to the other two. Its ampullated end corresponds to the upper and lateral angle of the vestibule, just above the oval window, where it opens close to the ampullated end of the anterior semicircular canal; its opposite end opens at the upper and back part of the vestibule. The lateral canal of one ear is very nearly in the same plane as that of the other.

===Anterior semicircular canal===
The anterior semicircular canal (also known as superior semicircular canal) contains the part of the vestibular system that detects rotations of the head in around the lateral axis, that is, rotation in the sagittal plane. This occurs, for example, when nodding one&#x27;s head (pitch axis).

It is in length, is vertical in direction, and is placed transversely to the long axis of the petrous part of the temporal bone, on the anterior surface of which its arch forms a round projection. It describes about two-thirds of a circle. Its lateral extremity is ampullated, and opens into the upper part of the vestibule; the opposite end joins with the upper part of the posterior semicircular canal to form the &quot;crus osseum commune&quot;, which opens into the upper and medial part of the vestibule.

===Posterior semicircular canal===
The posterior semicircular canal contains the part of the vestibular system that detects rotation of the head around the antero-posterior (sagittal) axis, or in other words, rotation in the coronal plane. This occurs, for example, when one moves the head to touch the shoulders, or when doing a cartwheel (roll axis).

It is directed superiorly and posteriorly, as per its nomenclature, nearly parallel to the posterior surface of the petrous part of the temporal bone. The vestibular aqueduct is immediately medial to it. The posterior semicircular canal is part of the bony labyrinth and its duct is used by the vestibular system to detect rotations of the head in the coronal plane. It is the longest of the three semicircular canals, measuring from . Its lower or ampullated end opens into the lower and back part of the vestibule, its upper into the &quot;crus osseum commune&quot;.

===Development===
Findings from a 2009 study demonstrated a critical late role for bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) in the morphogenesis of semicircular canals in the zebrafish inner ear. It is suspected that the role of BMP-2 in semicircular canal duct outgrowth is likely to be conserved between different vertebrate species.

Additionally, it has been found that the two semicircular canals found in the lamprey inner ear are developmentally similar to the superior and posterior canals found in humans, as the canals of both organisms arise from two depressions in the otic vesicle during early development. These depressions first form in lampreys between the 11 and 42 millimeter larval stages and form in zebrafish 57 hours post-fertilization 

==Function==

The semicircular ducts provide sensory input for experiences of rotary movements. They are oriented along the pitch, roll, and yaw axes. The lateral semicircular canal is oriented in the yaw axis, the anterior semicircular canal is oriented in the pitch axis, and the posterior semicircular canal is oriented in the roll axis.

Each duct is filled with a fluid called endolymph and contains motion sensors within the fluids. The base of each duct is enlarged, opening into the utricle, and has a dilated sac at one end called the membranous ampulla. Within the ampulla is a mound of hair cells and supporting cells called crista ampullaris. These hair cells have many cytoplasmic projections on the apical surface called stereocilia which are embedded in a gelatinous structure called the cupula. As the head rotates, the duct moves, but the endolymph lags behind owing to inertia. This deflects the cupula and bends the stereocilia within. The bending of these stereocilia alters an electric signal that is transmitted to the brain. Within approximately 10 seconds of achieving constant motion, the endolymph catches up with the movement of the duct and the cupula is no longer affected, stopping the sensation of acceleration. The specific gravity of the cupula is comparable to that of the surrounding endolymph. Consequently, the cupula is not displaced by gravity, unlike the otolithic membranes of the utricle and saccule. As with macular hair cells, hair cells of the crista ampullaris will depolarise when the stereocilia deflect towards the kinocilium. Deflection in the opposite direction results in hyperpolarisation and inhibition. In the lateral semicircular duct, ampullopetal flow is necessary for hair-cell stimulation, whereas ampullofugal flow is necessary for the anterior and posterior semicircular ducts.

This adjustment period is in part the cause of an illusion known as &quot;the leans&quot; often experienced by pilots. As a pilot enters a turn, hair cells in the semicircular ducts are stimulated, telling the brain that the aircraft, and the pilot, are no longer moving in a straight line but rather making a banked turn. If the pilot were to sustain a constant rate turn, the endolymph would eventually catch up with the ducts and cease to deflect the cupula. The pilot would no longer feel as if the aircraft was in a turn. As the pilot exits the turn, the semicircular ducts are stimulated to make the pilot think that they are now turning in the opposite direction rather than flying straight and level. In response to this, the pilot will often lean in the direction of the original turn in an attempt to compensate for this illusion. A more serious form of this is called a graveyard spiral. Rather than the pilot leaning in the direction of the original turn, they may actually re-enter the turn. As the endolymph stabilizes, the semicircular ducts stop registering the gradual turn and the aircraft slowly loses altitude until impact with the ground. 

==History==
Jean Pierre Flourens, by destroying the horizontal semicircular canal of pigeons, noted that they continue to fly in a circle, showing the purpose of the semicircular canals.

<doc id="303864" wikidata="Q307578" url="?curid=303864" title="Abdullah (name)">
<text>Abd Allah (), also spelled Abdullah, Abdhullah, Abdellah, Abdollah, Abdallah, Abdulla, Abdalla and many others, is an Arabic theophoric name meaning &quot;servant of God&quot; or &quot;God&#x27;s follower&quot;. It is built from the Arabic words &quot;abd&quot; () and &quot;Allāh&quot; ().

Although the first letter &quot;a&quot; in &quot;Allāh&quot;, as the first letter of the article &quot;al-&quot;, is usually unstressed in Arabic, it is usually stressed in the pronunciation of this name. The variants &quot;Abdollah&quot; and &quot;Abdullah&quot; represent the elision of this &quot;a&quot; following the &quot;u&quot; of the Classical Arabic nominative case (pronounced in Persian).

Humility before God is an essential value of Islam, hence &quot;Abdullah&quot; is a common name among Muslims. However, the name of the Islamic prophet Muhammad&#x27;s father was Abdullah. The prophet&#x27;s father died before his birth, which indicates that the name was already in use in pre-Islamic Arabia.

It is also common among Mizrahi Jews, especially Iraqi Jews and Syrian Jews. The name is cognate to and has the same meaning as the Hebrew Abdiel and, more commonly, Obadiah. There were two Jewish rabbis in Medina before Islam came; they were Abdullah ibn Salam and Abdullah ibn Shuria. Abdullah ibn Saba was a Yemenite Jew during the spread of Islam.

The variant used in the Russian language is &quot;&quot; (&quot;Abdulla&quot;) (cf. Fedul, which has similar origins), with &quot;&quot; (&quot;Abdul&quot;) and &quot;&quot; (&quot;Gabdulla&quot;) often used in Adyghe. The Spanish variant is Abdala. The Turkic Tatar language spells it as Ğabdulla (Габдулла).

The Christian Arabic Bible uses the word &quot;Allah&quot; for God. Presently in the Middle East, the name is sometimes used by Christians as a given or family name.

<text>This is a timeline of major events in the history of Jerusalem; a city that had been fought over sixteen times in its history. During its long history, Jerusalem has been destroyed twice, besieged 23 times, attacked 52 times, and captured and recaptured 44 times.

==Chalcolithic==
* 4500–3500 BC: First settlement established near Gihon Spring (earliest archaeological evidence).

==Bronze Age: Canaanite city==
* c. 2000 BCE: First known mention of the city, using the name &quot;Rušalimum&quot;, in the Middle Kingdom Egyptian Execration texts; although the identification of &quot;Rušalimum&quot; as Jerusalem has been challenged. The Semitic root S-L-M in the name is thought to refer to either &quot;peace&quot; (Salam or Shalom in modern Arabic and Hebrew) or Shalim, the god of dusk in the Canaanite religion.
* c. 1850 BCE: According to the Book of Genesis, the Binding of Isaac takes place on a mountain in the land of Moriah (see Chronology of the Bible). Biblical scholars have often interpreted the location of the mountain to be in Jerusalem, although this is disputed.
* c. 1700–1550 BCE: According to Manetho (via Josephus&#x27; &quot;Against Apion&quot;), the Hyksos invade the region.
* c. 1550–1400 BCE: Jerusalem becomes a vassal to Egypt as the Egyptian New Kingdom reunites Egypt and expands into the Levant under Ahmose I and Thutmose I.
* c. 1330 BCE: Correspondence in the Amarna letters between Abdi-Heba, Canaanite ruler of Jerusalem (then known as Urusalim), and Amenhotep III, suggesting the city was a vassal to New Kingdom Egypt.

==Iron Age==


* 1178 BCE: The Battle of Djahy (Canaan) between Ramesses III and the Sea Peoples marks the beginning of the decline in power of the New Kingdom in the Levant during the Bronze Age collapse (depicted on the North Wall of the Medinet Habu temple and the Papyrus Harris).
* c. 1000 BCE: According to the Bible, Jerusalem is inhabited by Jebusites and is known as Jebus.

===Independent Israelite capital===
Jerusalem becomes the capital of the Kingdom of Judah and, according to the Bible, for the first few decades even of a wider united kingdom of Judah and Israel, under kings belonging to the House of David.
* c. 1010 BCE: biblical King David attacks and captures Jerusalem. Jerusalem becomes City of David and capital of the United Kingdom of Israel.
* c. 962 BCE: biblical King Solomon builds the First Temple.
* c. 931–930 BCE: Solomon dies, and the Golden Age of Israel ends. Jerusalem becomes the capital of the (southern) Kingdom of Judah led by Rehoboam after the split of the United Monarchy.
* 925 BCE: Egyptian Sack of Jerusalem – Pharaoh Sheshonk I of the Third Intermediate Period invades Canaan following the Battle of Bitter Lakes. Possibly the same as Shishak, the first Pharaoh mentioned in the Bible who captured and pillaged Jerusalem (see Bubastite Portal).
* 853 BCE: The Battle of Qarqar in which Jerusalem&#x27;s forces were likely involved in an indecisive battle against Shalmaneser III of Neo-Assyria (Jehoshaphat of Judah was allied to Ahab of Israel according to the Bible) (see Kurkh Monoliths).
* c. 850 BCE: Jerusalem is sacked by Philistines, Arabs and Ethiopians, who looted King Jehoram&#x27;s house, and carried off all of his family except for his youngest son Jehoahaz. 
* c. 830 BCE: Hazael of Aram Damascus conquers most of Canaan. According to the Bible, Jehoash of Judah gave all of Jerusalem&#x27;s treasures as a tribute, but Hazael proceeded to destroy &quot;all the princes of the people&quot; in the city.
* 786 BCE: Jehoash of Israel sacks the city, destroys the walls and takes Amaziah of Judah prisoner.
* c. 740 BCE: Assyrian inscriptions record military victories of Tiglath Pileser III over Uzziah of Judah.

==Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian period==
* 733 BCE: According to the Bible, Jerusalem becomes a vassal of the Neo-Assyrian Empire after Ahaz of Judah appeals to Tiglath Pileser III of the Neo-Assyrian Empire to protect the city from Pekah of Israel and Rezin of Aram. Tiglath Pileser III subsequently conquers most of the Levant. At around this time, the Siege of Gezer, 20 miles west of Jerusalem, is recorded on a stone relief at the Assyrian royal palace in Nimrud.
* c. 712 BCE: The Siloam Tunnel is built in order to keep water from the Gihon Spring inside the city. According to the Bible the tunnel was built by King Hezekiah in preparation for a siege by the Assyrians, along with an expansion of Jerusalem&#x27;s fortifications across the Tyropoeon Valley to enclose the hill today known as Mount Zion.
* 712 BCE: Assyrian Siege of Jerusalem – Jerusalem pays further tribute to the Neo-Assyrian Empire after the Neo-Assyrian King Sennacherib laid siege to the city.
* c. 670 BCE: Manasseh, the ruler of Jerusalem, is brought in chains to the Assyrian king, presumably for suspected disloyalty.
* c. 627 BCE: The death of Ashurbanipal and the successful revolt of Nabopolassar replaces the Neo-Assyrian Empire with the Neo-Babylonian Empire.
* 609 BCE: Jerusalem becomes part of the Empire of the Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt after Josiah of Judah is killed by the army of Pharaoh Necho II at the Battle of Megiddo. Josiah&#x27;s son Jehoahaz of Judah is deposed by the Egyptians and replaced as ruler of Jerusalem by his brother Jehoiakim.
* 605 BCE: Jerusalem switches its tributary allegiance back to the Neo-Babylonians after Necho II is defeated by Nebuchadnezzar II at the Battle of Carchemish.
* 599–597 BCE: first Babylonian siege – Nebuchadnezzar II crushed a rebellion in the Kingdom of Judah and other cities in the Levant which had been sparked by the Neo-Babylonians failed invasion of Egypt in 601. Jehoiachin of Jerusalem deported to Babylon. 
* 587–586 BCE: second Babylonian siege – Nebuchadnezzar II fought Pharaoh Apries&#x27;s attempt to invade Judah. Jerusalem mostly destroyed including the First Temple, and the city&#x27;s prominent citizens exiled to Babylon (see Nebuchadnezzar Chronicle).
* 582 BCE: Gedaliah the Babylonian governor of Judah assassinated, provoking refugees to Egypt and a third deportation.

==Persian (Achaemenid) period==
* 539 BCE: Jerusalem becomes part of the Eber-Nari satrapy of the Achaemenid Empire after King Cyrus the Great conquers the Neo-Babylonian Empire by defeating Nabonidus at the Battle of Opis
:* Cyrus the Great issues the Edict of Cyrus allowing Babylonian Jews to return from the Babylonian captivity and rebuild the Temple (Biblical sources only, see Cyrus (Bible) and The Return to Zion).
:* The first wave of Babylonian returnees is Sheshbazzar&#x27;s Aliyah. 
:* The second wave of Babylonian returnees is Zerubbabel&#x27;s Aliyah. 
:* The return of Babylonian Jews increases the schism with the Samaritans, who had remained in the region during the Assyrian and Babylonian deportations.
* 516 BCE: The Second Temple is built in the 6th year of Darius the Great. 
* 458 BCE: The third wave of Babylonian returnees is Ezra&#x27;s Aliyah. 
* 445 BCE: The fourth and final wave of Babylonian returnees is Nehemiah&#x27;s Aliyah. Nehemiah is the appointed governor of Judah, and rebuilds the Old City walls.
* 410 BCE: The Great Assembly is established in Jerusalem.
* 365/364-362 and c. 347 BCE: Judea participates in Egyptian-inspired and Sidonian-led revolts against the Achaemenids, and coins minted in Jerusalem are reflecting the short-lived autonomy. Achaemenid general Bagoas is possibly the same as &#x27;Bagoses&#x27; in Josephus&#x27; &quot;Antiquities&quot;, who defiles the Temple and imposes taxes on sacrifices performed there.

==Hellenistic period==


===Under Alexander, the Ptolemies, and Seleucids===
* 332 BCE: Jerusalem capitulates to Alexander the Great, during his six-year Macedonian conquest of the empire of Darius III of Persia. Alexander&#x27;s armies took Jerusalem without complication while travelling to Egypt after the Siege of Tyre (332 BC).
* 323 BCE: The city comes under the rule of Laomedon of Mytilene, who is given control of the province of Syria following Alexander&#x27;s death and the resulting Partition of Babylon between the Diadochi. This partition was reconfirmed two years later at the Partition of Triparadisus.
* 320 BCE: General Nicanor, dispatched by satrap of Egypt Ptolemy I Soter and founder of the Ptolemaic Kingdom, takes control of Syria including Jerusalem and captures Laomedon in the process.
* 315 BCE: The Antigonid dynasty gains control of the city after Ptolemy I Soter withdraws from Syria including Jerusalem and Antigonus I Monophthalmus invades during the Third War of the Diadochi. Seleucus I Nicator, then governor of Babylon under Antigonus I Monophthalmus, fled to Egypt to join Ptolemy.
* 312 BCE: Jerusalem is re-captured by Ptolemy I Soter after he defeats Antigonus&#x27; son Demetrius I at the Battle of Gaza. It is probable that Seleucus I Nicator, then an Admiral under Ptolemy&#x27;s command, also took part in the battle, as following the battle he was given 800 infantry and 200 cavalry and immediately travelled to Babylon where he founded the Seleucid Empire.
* 311 BCE: The Antigonid dynasty regains control of the city after Ptolemy withdraws from Syria again following a minor defeat by Antigonus I Monophthalmus, and a peace treaty is concluded.
* 302 BCE: Ptolemy invades Syria for a third time, but evacuated again shortly thereafter following false news of a victory for Antigonus against Lysimachus (another of the Diadochi).
* 301 BCE: Coele-Syria (Southern Syria) including Jerusalem is re-captured by Ptolemy I Soter after Antigonus I Monophthalmus is killed at the Battle of Ipsus. Ptolemy had not taken part in the battle, and the victors Seleucus I Nicator and Lysimachus had carved up the Antigonid Empire between them, with Southern Syria intended to become part of the Seleucid Empire. Although Seleucus did not attempt to conquer the area he was due, Ptolemy&#x27;s pre-emptive move led to the Syrian Wars which began in 274 BC between the successors of the two leaders.
* 219–217 BCE: The northern portion of Coele-Syria is given to the Seleucid Empire in 219 through the betrayal of Governor Theodotus of Aetolia, who had held the province on behalf of Ptolemy IV Philopator. The Seleucids advanced on Egypt, but were defeated at the Battle of Raphia (Rafah) in 217.
* 200 BCE: Jerusalem falls under the control of the Seleucid Empire following the Battle of Panium (part of the Fifth Syrian War) in which Antiochus III the Great defeated the Ptolemies.
* 175 BCE: Antiochus IV Epiphanes succeeds his father and becomes King of the Seleucid Empire. He accelerates Seleucid efforts to eradicate the Jewish religion by forcing the Jewish High Priest Onias III to step down in favour of his brother Jason, who was replaced by Menelaus three years later. He outlaws Sabbath and circumcision, sacks Jerusalem and erects an altar to Zeus in the Second Temple after plundering it.
* 167 BCE: Maccabean revolt sparked when a Seleucid Greek government representative under King Antiochus IV asked Mattathias to offer sacrifice to the Greek gods; he refused to do so, killed a Jew who had stepped forward to do so and attacked the government official that required the act. Led to the guerilla Battle of Wadi Haramia.
* 164 BC 25 Kislev: The Maccabees capture Jerusalem following the Battle of Beth Zur, and rededicate the Temple (see Hanukkah). The Hasmoneans take control of part of Jerusalem, while the Seleucids retain control of the Acra (fortress) in the city and most surrounding areas.
* 160 BCE: The Seleucids retake control of the whole of Jerusalem after Judas Maccabeus is killed at the Battle of Elasa, marking the end of the Maccabean revolt.
* 145–144 BCE: Alexander Balas is overthrown at the Battle of Antioch (the capital of the empire) by Demetrius II Nicator in alliance with Ptolemy VI Philometor of Egypt. The following year, Mithradates I of Parthia captured Seleucia (the previous capital of the Seleucid Empire), significantly weakening the power of Demetrius II Nicator throughout the remaining empire.

===Hasmonean kingdom===
* c. 140 BCE: The Acra is captured and later destroyed by Simon Thassi.
* 139 BCE: Demetrius II Nicator is taken prisoner for nine years by the rapidly expanding Parthian Empire after defeat of the Seleucids in Persia. Simon Thassi travels to Rome, where the Roman Republic formally acknowledges the Hasmonean Kingdom. However the region remains a province of the Seleucid empire and Simon Thassi is required to provide troops to Antiochus VII Sidetes.
* 134 BCE: Sadducee John Hyrcanus becomes leader after his father Simon Thassi is murdered. He takes a Greek regnal name (see Hyrcania) in an acceptance of the Hellenistic culture of his Seleucid suzerains.
* 134 BCE: Seleucid King Antiochus VII Sidetes recaptures the city. John Hyrcanus opened King David&#x27;s sepulchre and removed three thousand talents which he paid as tribute to spare the city (according to Josephus.) John Hyrcanus remains as governor, becoming a vassal to the Seleucids
* 116 BCE: A civil war between Seleucid half-brothers Antiochus VIII Grypus and Antiochus IX Cyzicenus results in a breakup of the kingdom and the independence of certain principalities, including Judea.
* 110 BCE: John Hyrcanus carries out the first military conquests of the independent Hasmonean kingdom, raising a mercenary army to capture Madaba and Schechem, significantly increasing the regional influence of Jerusalem.
* c. 87 BCE: According to Josephus, following a six-year civil war involving Seleucid king Demetrius III Eucaerus, Hasmonean ruler Alexander Jannaeus crucified 800 Jewish rebels in Jerusalem.
* 73–63 BCE: The Roman Republic extends its influence into the region in the Third Mithridatic War. During the war, Armenian King Tigranes the Great takes control of Syria and prepares to invade Judea and Jerusalem but has to retreat following an invasion of Armenia by Lucullus. However, this period is believed to have resulted in the first settlement of Armenians in Jerusalem. According to Armenian historian Movses Khorenatsi writing in c. 482 CE, Tigranes captured Jerusalem and deported Hyrcanus to Armenia, however most scholars deem this account to be incorrect.

<text>Claiborne de Borda Pell (November 22, 1918 – January 1, 2009) was an American politician and writer who served as a U.S. Senator from Rhode Island for six terms from 1961 to 1997. He was the sponsor of the 1972 bill that reformed the Basic Educational Opportunity Grant, which provides financial aid funding to American college students; the grant was given Pell&#x27;s name in 1980 in honor of his work in education legislation.

A member of the Democratic Party, Pell remains the longest serving U.S. Senator from Rhode Island.

==Early life and education==
Claiborne Pell was born on November 22, 1918, in New York City, the son of Matilda Bigelow and diplomat and congressman Herbert Pell.

Pell&#x27;s family members included John Francis Hamtramck Claiborne, George Mifflin Dallas, and Nathaniel Herbert Claiborne. He was a direct descendant of English mathematician John Pell and a descendant of Senator William C. C. Claiborne. The &quot;Congressional Record&quot; also reports that he was a direct descendant of Wampage I, a Siwanoy chieftain.

In 1927, Pell&#x27;s parents divorced and his mother remarried Hugo W. Koehler of St. Louis, a commander in the United States Navy. Following World War I, Koehler served as an Office of Naval Intelligence and State Department operative in Russia during its civil war, and later as naval attaché to Poland. Said to be the &quot;richest officer in the Navy&quot; during the 1920s, Koehler was rumored to be the illegitimate son of Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria and to have assisted the Romanovs to flee the Russian Empire following the Russian Revolution of 1917. Pell was close to his stepfather, who died when Pell was 22. In later years, he made a concerted effort to determine the veracity of the rumors surrounding Koehler&#x27;s past, but was only partly successful.

Pell attended St. George&#x27;s School in Middletown, Rhode Island, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in history from Princeton University in 1940. Pell&#x27;s senior thesis was titled &quot;Macaulay and the Slavery Issue.&quot; While at Princeton, he was a member of Colonial Club and the American Whig-Cliosophic Society, and played on the rugby team.

==Post-college life==
After graduating from Princeton, Pell worked as an oil field roustabout in Oklahoma. He then served as private secretary for his father, who was United States Ambassador to Portugal. At the start of World War II he was with his father, who was then United States Ambassador to Hungary. Claiborne Pell drove trucks carrying emergency supplies to prisoners of war in Germany, and was detained several times by the Nazi government.

===Uniformed service===
Pell enlisted in the U.S. Coast Guard as a seaman second class on August 12, 1941, four months before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Pell served as a ship&#x27;s cook, was promoted to seaman first class on October 31, and then was commissioned as an ensign on December 17, 1941. During the war, Pell&#x27;s ships served as North Atlantic convoy escorts, and also in amphibious warfare during the allied invasion of Sicily and the allied invasion of the Italian mainland.

Pell was promoted to lieutenant (junior grade) on October 1, 1942, and then to lieutenant in May 1943. Due to his fluency in Italian, Pell was assigned as a civil affairs officer in Sicily, where he became ill from drinking unpasteurized milk. He was sent home for recuperation during the summer of 1944, but returned to active service later in the war. Pell was discharged from active duty on September 5, 1945.

After the end of World War II, he remained in the U.S. Coast Guard Reserve. He attained the rank of captain and retired in 1978.

===Personal life and family===
In December 1944, Pell married Nuala O&#x27;Donnell, daughter of Charles Oliver O&#x27;Donnell and Josephine Hartford. They had four children: Herbert Claiborne Pell III, Christopher Thomas Hartford Pell, Nuala Dallas Pell, and Julia Lorillard Wampage Pell. Herbert (September 11, 1945 – September 24, 1999) and Julia (May 9, 1953 – April 13, 2006) predeceased their parents. His grandson Clay Pell (son of Herbert) was an unsuccessful contender in the 2014 Democratic primary for Governor of Rhode Island.

===Diplomatic work, further education===
From 1945 to 1952, he served in the United States Department of State as a Foreign Service Officer in Czechoslovakia, Italy, and Washington, D.C. He was fluent in French, Italian, and Portuguese.

In 1945, Pell was a participant in the United Nations Conference on International Organization in San Francisco that drafted the United Nations Charter.

In 1946 he completed graduate studies in International Relations at Columbia University and received a Master of Arts degree.

===Post-diplomatic career===
In 1954, Pell was appointed vice president and member of the board of directors of the International Fiscal Corporation. He also served as a vice president and director of the North American Newspaper Alliance. He was also a director of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Foundation, Fort Ticonderoga Association, and General Rochambeau Commission of Rhode Island. He also served as a fundraiser and consultant for the Democratic National Committee. He served as Vice President of the International Rescue Committee. Stationed in Austria, he was responsible for assisting refugees from the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 to leave the country and resettle.

During Pell&#x27;s diplomatic career and other international activities in the 1940s and 1950s, he was arrested and jailed at least six times, including detentions by both fascist and communist governments.

==Political career==

In 1960, Pell won the seat of retiring U.S. Senator Theodore Francis Green, defeating former Governor Dennis J. Roberts and former Governor and U.S. Senator J. Howard McGrath in the Democratic primary, and former Rhode Island Republican Party Chairman Raoul Archambault in the general election.

Despite being called &quot;the least electable man in America&quot; by John F. Kennedy because of his many odd habits and beliefs, Pell proved a durable politician. He won reelection five times, including victories over Ruth M. Briggs (1966), John Chafee (1972), James G. Reynolds (1978), Barbara Leonard (1984), and Claudine Schneider (1990).

Often considered by his opponents to be too easygoing, Pell demonstrated his effectiveness as a campaigner. During his first campaign, when he was accused of carpetbagging, Pell published newspaper advertisements featuring a photograph of his grand-uncle Duncan Pell, who had served as Lieutenant Governor of Rhode Island during the 1860s, thus demonstrating Pell&#x27;s association with the state. When Briggs called him a &quot;creampuff&quot; during their 1966 campaign, Pell turned that to his advantage and mocked Briggs by obtaining an endorsement from a local baker&#x27;s union.

During his first campaign, Pell also used his foreign experience to great advantage, impressing some largely immigrant audiences in person and on the radio by campaigning in their native languages.

===Personality and beliefs===
Pell was known for unusual beliefs and behaviors, including wearing threadbare suits, using public transportation and purchasing cheap used automobiles despite his wealth, and an interest in the paranormal. His interest in the paranormal was critiqued by author Martin Gardner: &quot;In my opinion, however, no one in Washington has rivaled Senator Pell in combining of science with extreme gullibility toward the performances of psychics.&quot; He also wore his father&#x27;s belt as a memento, despite the fact that Herbert Pell was stouter than the rail-thin Claiborne Pell, requiring Claiborne Pell to wrap the belt around his waist twice to make it fit. Pell would also wear unique clothing while jogging, including a tweed suit jacket. According to another story about Pell&#x27;s eccentricities, at the conclusion of a meeting with Fidel Castro, Pell took Castro&#x27;s cigar because he thought it was a gift for him.

===Arrest allegation===
In 1972&#x27;s &quot;The Washington Pay-Off&quot;, author and former lobbyist Robert N. Winter-Berger wrote about Pell&#x27;s alleged arrest during a raid on a Greenwich Village homosexual bar in 1964. Pell denied the allegation and there were no police records, witness statements or other sources to corroborate Winter-Berger. Despite legal advice to sue for defamation, Pell declined, deciding that it would draw undue publicity to the allegations.

===Senate career===

Pell voted in favor of the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Medicare program, the Civil Rights Act of 1968, and the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Early in his Senate tenure, Pell was a major legislative sponsor of the National Sea Grant College Program in 1965 and 1966 that served to support marine research, and develop maritime industries. The Sea Grant program supported considerable growth of the oceanography and other marine science disciplines during the mid-20th Century.

Pell was largely responsible for the creation of &quot;Basic Educational Opportunity Grants&quot; in 1973, renamed Pell Grants in 1980, to provide financial aid funds to U.S. college students. Pell Grants initially provided for grants for prisoners, but Congress later eliminated that provision. For some years there was more money available than was applied for.

He was the main sponsor of the bill that created the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, and was active as an advocate for mass transportation initiatives and domestic legislation facilitating and conforming to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Pell was one of twenty-five Senators to co-sponsor the Health Security Act, a bipartisan universal health care bill that advocated the creation of a health insurance program run by the federal government to provide coverage to every person in America.

Pell served as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from 1987 to 1995. In 1990 he was re-elected to his sixth and last term of the Senate.

In 1996, his last full year in the Senate, Pell voted against the Defense of Marriage Act, which banned the federal government from legally recognizing same-sex marriage.

Pell declined to seek re-election in 1996 and retired on January 3, 1997. Pell served in the Senate for thirty-six continuous years, making him the longest-serving U.S. Senator in the history of Rhode Island. He was succeeded by Jack Reed.

==Retirement and death==
After retirement, Pell lived in Newport and was a communicant of St. Columba&#x27;s Chapel in Middletown. He occasionally attended public functions of organizations with which he was affiliated. He was also a distinguished visiting professor at Salve Regina University. Towards the end of his life, he was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

Claiborne Pell died on January 1, 2009. His funeral was held at Trinity Church in Newport. In addition to members of his family, Pell was eulogized by former President Bill Clinton, Senators Edward Kennedy and Jack Reed, and then-Vice President-elect Joe Biden. He was buried at St. Columba&#x27;s (Episcopal) Chapel (Berkeley Memorial Chapel) in Middletown, Rhode Island, near the graves of his son Herbert and his daughter Julia, who had predeceased him.

Soon after his death, the newspaper &quot;The New York Times&quot; termed Pell &quot;the most formidable politician in Rhode Island history.&quot;

==Authorship, recognition, organizations==
===Published works===
Senator Pell authored three books, &quot;Megalopolis Unbound: The Supercity and the Transportation of Tomorrow&quot; (1966), &quot;A Challenge of the Seven Seas&quot; (1966), (co-author), and &quot;Power and Policy: America&#x27;s Role in World Affairs&quot; (1972).

===Awards and honors===
Senator Pell received more than 50 honorary college degrees, including recognition from Johnson &amp; Wales University, the University of Vermont and the University of Massachusetts.

In 1983 Pell was awarded American Library Association Honorary Membership.

<text>Meddle is the sixth studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released by Harvest Records on 5 November 1971 in the United Kingdom. The album was produced between the band&#x27;s touring commitments, from January to August 1971 at a series of locations around London, including EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) and Morgan Studios.

With no material to work with and no clear idea of the album&#x27;s direction, the band devised a series of novel experiments which eventually inspired the album&#x27;s signature track &quot;Echoes&quot;. Although the band&#x27;s later albums would be unified by a central theme chosen by Roger Waters, and thematically consistent lyrics written entirely by Waters, &quot;Meddle&quot; was a group effort with Waters contributing primarily to the lyrics and the bass. It is considered a transitional album between the Syd Barrett-influenced group of the 1960s and the Waters-led era of the 1970s. Fans often refer to this album, especially &quot;Echoes&quot;, as the first instance of the group achieving their musical potential.

As with several previous albums, the cover was designed by Hipgnosis, and has been explained by its creator Storm Thorgerson – who was unhappy with the final result – to be an ear underwater. The album was well received by critics upon its release, and was commercially successful in the United Kingdom, but lacklustre publicity on the part of the band&#x27;s American label Capitol Records led to poor sales in the US upon initial release.

Returning from a series of tours across America and England in support of &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot;, at the start of 1971 Pink Floyd commenced work on new material at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London. At the time, EMI was equipped only with eight-track multitrack recording facilities, which the band found insufficient for the increasing technical demands of their project. They transferred their best efforts, including the opening of what became &quot;Echoes&quot;, to 16-track tape at smaller studios in London (namely AIR, and Morgan in West Hampstead) and resumed work with the advantage of more flexible recording equipment. Engineers John Leckie and Peter Bown recorded the main EMI and AIR sessions, while for minor work at Morgan, Rob Black and Roger Quested handled the engineering duties.

Lacking a central theme for the project, the band used several experimental methods in an attempt to spur the creative process. One exercise involved each member playing on a separate track, with no reference to what the other members were doing. The tempo was entirely random while the band played around an agreed chord structure, and moods such as &quot;first two minutes romantic, next two up tempo&quot;. Each recorded section was named, but the process was largely unproductive; after several weeks, no complete songs had been created.

Leckie had worked on albums such as George Harrison&#x27;s &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; and Ringo Starr&#x27;s &quot;Sentimental Journey&quot; both in 1970, and was employed as a tape-operator on &quot;Meddle&quot;, partly for his proclivity for working into the early hours of the morning. He has said that Pink Floyd&#x27;s sessions would often begin in the afternoon, and end early the next morning, &quot;during which time nothing would get done. There was no record company contact whatsoever, except when their label manager would show up now and again with a couple of bottles of wine and a couple of joints.&quot; The band would apparently spend long periods of time working on simple sounds, or a particular guitar riff. They also spent several days at AIR attempting to create music using a variety of household objects, a project which would be revisited between their next albums, &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (1973) and &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; (1975).

Following these early experiments – called &quot;Nothings&quot; – the band developed &quot;Son of Nothings&quot;, which was followed by &quot;Return of the Son of Nothings&quot; as the working title of the new album, which ultimately evolved into &quot;Echoes&quot;.

&quot;Meddle&quot; was recorded between the band&#x27;s various concert commitments, and therefore its production was spread over a considerable period of time. The band recorded in the first half of April 1971, but in the latter half played at Doncaster and Norwich before returning to record at the end of the month. In May they split their time between sessions at EMI, and rehearsals and concerts in London, Lancaster, Stirling, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Nottingham. June and July were spent mainly performing at venues across Europe. August was spent in the far east and Australia, September in Europe, and October to November in the US. In the same period, the group also produced &quot;Relics&quot;, a compilation album of some of Pink Floyd&#x27;s earlier works. A mix of the album was prepared at Command Studios on 21 and 26 September. New 2016 stereo and 5.1 mixes of the album were inadvertently released as hidden tracks on the &quot;Reverber/ation&quot; Blu-ray disc in &quot;The Early Years 1965–1972&quot; box set.

==Writing==

Although the tracks possess a variety of moods, &quot;Meddle&quot; is generally considered more cohesive than its 1970 predecessor, &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot;. The largely instrumental &quot;One of These Days&quot; is followed by &quot;A Pillow of Winds&quot;, which is distinguished by being one of the few quiet, acoustic love songs in the Pink Floyd catalogue. These two songs segue into each other across windy sound effects, anticipating the technique that would later be used on &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;. The title of &quot;A Pillow of Winds&quot; was inspired by the games of Mahjong that Roger Waters, Nick Mason, and their wives Judith Trim and Lindy Rutter played while in the south of France.

&quot;One of These Days&quot; was developed around an ostinato bassline created by Roger Waters, by feeding the output through a Binson Echorec. The bassline was performed by Waters and David Gilmour using two bass guitars, one on old strings. Drummer Nick Mason&#x27;s abstruse &quot;One of these days I&#x27;m going to cut you into little pieces&quot; vocal line was recorded at double speed using a falsetto voice, and replayed at normal speed.

The song &quot;Fearless&quot; includes field recordings of Liverpool F.C. fans in the Anfield Kop singing club anthem &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot;, which brings the song to an end in a heavily reverberated fade-out. &quot;San Tropez&quot;, by contrast, is a jazz-inflected pop song with a shuffle tempo, written by Waters in his increasingly deployed style of breezy, off-the-cuff songwriting. The song was inspired by the band&#x27;s trip to the south of France in 1970. Pink Floyd uncharacteristically displayed their sense of humour with &quot;Seamus&quot;, a pseudo-blues novelty track featuring Steve Marriott&#x27;s dog Seamus (whom Gilmour was dog-sitting) howling along to the music. Although &quot;Seamus&quot; often tops polls of the worst songs Pink Floyd ever created, the band would use animal sounds again on the 1977 album &quot;Animals&quot; (albeit as part of the concept of the album).

The final song on the album is the 23-minute &quot;Echoes&quot;. First performed as &quot;Return of the Son of Nothing&quot; on 22 April 1971 in Norwich, the band spent about three months on the track in three studios (Morgan, AIR and EMI). &quot;Echoes&quot; began with a studio experiment involving Richard Wright&#x27;s piano. Wright had fed a single note through a Leslie speaker, producing a submarine-like ping. The band tried repeatedly to recreate this sound in the studio but were unsuccessful, and so the demo version was used on what would later become &quot;Echoes&quot;, mixed almost exclusively at AIR Studios. Combined with David Gilmour&#x27;s guitar, the band were able to develop the track further, experimenting with accidental sound effects, such as Gilmour&#x27;s guitar being plugged into a wah-wah pedal back to front (connecting the guitar to the pedal&#x27;s output and the pedal&#x27;s input to the amplifier), an effect they used live from 1970 for the central section of “Embryo”. Unlike with &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot;, the new multi-track capabilities of the studio enabled them to create the track in stages, rather than performing it in a single take. The final, 23-minute piece would eventually take up the entire second side of the album.

&quot;Echoes&quot; also gave its name to the 2001 compilation album &quot;&quot;, on which a much-edited version of the title track was included. On the compilation, multiple edits throughout the entire song cut the running length of the piece down by some seven minutes. Some of the material composed during the creation of &quot;Meddle&quot; was not used; however, one song would eventually become &quot;Brain Damage&quot;, on &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;.

==Packaging==

The album&#x27;s title &quot;Meddle&quot; is a play on words: a medal, and to interfere. Storm Thorgerson of the art-design group Hipgnosis originally suggested a close-up shot of a baboon&#x27;s anus for the album cover photograph. He was overruled by the band, who informed him via an intercontinental telephone call while on tour in Japan that they would rather have &quot;an ear underwater&quot;. The cover image was photographed by Bob Dowling. The image represents an ear, underwater, collecting waves of sound (represented by ripples in the water). Thorgerson later expressed dissatisfaction with the cover, claiming it to be his least favourite Pink Floyd album sleeve: &quot;I think &quot;Meddle&quot; is a much better album than its cover&quot;. Thorgerson&#x27;s colleague Aubrey Powell shared his sentiments, saying: &quot;&quot;Meddle&quot; was a mess. I hated that cover. I don&#x27;t think we did them justice with that at all; it&#x27;s half-hearted.&quot; The gatefold contains a group photograph of the band, which would be their last until 1987&#x27;s &quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Meddle&quot; was released on 5 November 1971. It was later released as an LP by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab, and in April 1989 on their &quot;Ultradisc&quot; gold CD format. The album was included as part of the box set &quot;Shine On&quot; on 2 November 1992.

It reached number three on the UK Albums Chart, but lacklustre publicity on the part of Capitol Records led to weak sales in the US, and a chart position of number 70 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Pink Floyd had a strong following in the UK and other parts of Europe,&quot; recalled Rupert Perry, then head of A&amp;R at Capitol. &quot;But they needed to be bigger in the United States, where they were only doing 200,000 units. They were very much an album act – no singles – which was bad news for us. They had a high credibility factor without the sales.&quot;

On 29 November 1971, &quot;One of These Days&quot; was released as a 7-inch single in the US, with &quot;Fearless&quot; on the B-side. &quot;One of These Days&quot; and &quot;Echoes&quot; were performed in the 1972 concert film &quot;Live at Pompeii&quot; (the latter in two parts) and also on the BBC&#x27;s 1971 &quot;In Concert&quot;. &quot;Meddle&quot; was certified gold by the RIAA on 29 October 1973 and then double platinum on 11 March 1994, following the added attention garnered by the band&#x27;s later successes in the United States.

==Reception==

On release, &quot;Meddle&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Jean-Charles Costa wrote: &quot;&quot;Meddle&quot; not only confirms lead guitarist David Gilmour&#x27;s emergence as a real shaping force with the group, it states forcefully and accurately that the group is well into the growth track again&quot;, and the &quot;NME&quot; called it &quot;an exceptionally good album&quot;. Steve Peterson of &quot;Hit Parader&quot; cited &quot;Fearless&quot; as its best song and said of the album, &quot;This has got to be their best ever.&quot; Ed Kelleher of &quot;Circus&quot; called it &quot;another masterpiece by a masterful group&quot;, noting &quot;Fearless&quot; as &quot;fascinating&quot; and praising &quot;Echoes&quot; as &quot;a tone poem that allows all four band members much time to stretch their muscles&quot;. However, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; was more reserved, describing the album as &quot;a soundtrack to a non-existent movie&quot;.

In &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau said &quot;Meddle&quot; was a fairly good progression over the group&#x27;s previous work and featured folk songs highlighted by unique melodies, although he lamented the lyrics to &quot;A Pillow of Winds&quot;: &quot;The word &#x27;behold&#x27; should never cross their filters again&quot;. In his critique of &quot;Echoes&quot;, he believed the vocal melody imitates &quot;Across the Universe&quot; by the Beatles but over 23 minutes of music that flows with a &quot;timeless calm&quot; similar to &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot;. Daryl Easlea of the BBC felt it was a similar, but more consistent and tuneful version of &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot;, highlighted by &quot;Echoes&quot;, which he said &quot;dominates the entire work&quot; and is &quot;everything right about progressive rock; engaging, intelligent and compelling&quot;. In &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), Rob Sheffield said &quot;Echoes&quot; showed Pink Floyd to be a more developed group than before, &quot;coloring the slow guitar ripples with deep-in-the-studio sonic details that only the truly baked would notice, much less appreciate.&quot; Writing for AllMusic, editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine called &quot;Meddle&quot; the best album from their transitional years leading up to &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, as it &quot;spends most of its time with sonic textures and elongated compositions, most notably on its epic closer, &#x27;Echoes&#x27;&quot;. He noted a &quot;uniform tone&quot;, but not song structure, and wrote of the album&#x27;s significance in the band&#x27;s catalogue: &quot;Pink Floyd were nothing if not masters of texture, and &quot;Meddle&quot; is one of their greatest excursions into little details, pointing the way to the measured brilliance of &quot;[The] Dark Side of the Moon&quot; and the entire Roger Waters era.&quot;

The album was voted number 255 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000).

==Live performances==
A short concert tour ran from October to November 1971 to promote the album in the United States and Canada, which was the most extensive tour the group had done to that point. The tour was booked by Allen Frey, who continued to organise North American tours for the group throughout the 1970s.

Some of the album&#x27;s material had been played in earlier shows and the practice of playing songs before their official release later became a tradition for the group. The set list on the tour was varied, with the band playing material from their previous albums &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot;, &quot;More&quot;, and &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot;, plus the new album. The tour was the final time &quot;Embryo&quot;, &quot;Fat Old Sun&quot; and &quot;Cymbaline&quot; were played live by the band.

<text>The FAW Welsh Cup (), currently known as the JD Welsh Cup for sponsorship reasons, is a knock-out football competition contested annually by teams in the Welsh football league system. It is considered the most prestigious of the cup competitions in domestic Welsh association football.

The Football Association of Wales (FAW) is the organising body of this competition, which has been run (except during the two World Wars and the COVID-19 pandemic) every year since its inception in 1877–78.

In the early years of organised football in Wales, football was very much the sport of north Wales rather than the rugby union playing south – the FAW was founded in Wrexham in 1876, and Wrexham remained the site of the FAW&#x27;s head office until 1986; it was not until 1912 that a southern team, Cardiff City, won the Welsh Cup for the first time.

The winning team qualifies to play in the following season&#x27;s UEFA Conference League (previously teams qualified for the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, which was discontinued in 1999, and until 2021, qualified for the UEFA Europa League).

==Participants==
Until 1995, Welsh clubs playing in the Welsh or English leagues were invited to play in the Welsh Cup. On occasion some English clubs, mostly teams from border areas (for example, Chester City, Crewe Alexandra, Tranmere Rovers, Hereford United and Shrewsbury Town), were also invited to participate. However, in the event of an English club winning the Welsh Cup, they were not allowed to progress to the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. Instead, the best placed Welsh club in the Welsh Cup competition would take the European place.

From 1996 to 2011, only clubs playing in the Welsh football league system were allowed to enter the Welsh Cup. This rule excluded the six Welsh clubs who played in the English football league system: Swansea City, Colwyn Bay, Merthyr Tydfil (replaced by Merthyr Town), Newport County, Cardiff City and Wrexham. On 20 April 2011, the Football Association of Wales invited these six clubs to rejoin the Welsh Cup for the 2011–12 season, but only Merthyr Town, Newport County and Wrexham accepted. 

In March 2012, UEFA stated that Welsh clubs playing in the English football league system could not qualify for European competitions via the Welsh Cup but they could qualify via the English league and cup competitions, hence they were subsequently again excluded from the Welsh Cup. Colwyn Bay joined the Welsh league system in 2019, thus becoming eligible to compete in the Welsh Cup again.

On 13 January 2025, the Football Association of Wales announced plans to relaunch the competition to include Cardiff City, Swansea City, Newport County and Wrexham competing with an expanded 16 team Cymru Premier. The following week, the English Football Association rejected the proposal citing competition integrity and that the proposal would allow Wales&#x27; four English Football League clubs to qualify for Europe via a Welsh domestic cup as well as seeking to qualify for European competition via the English system should they be promoted to the Premier League.

==History==
Between the 1961–62 and 1984–85 seasons, the final was played as a two-leg match, originally on a points basis rather than aggregate score. In the 1985–86 season, it reverted back to a one game format (though a replay was required in the first two seasons), then changed to have a single game decided by extra time and penalties as necessary.

With six wins, Shrewsbury Town hold the record for the most times an English team has won the Cup, a record that will remain unbroken because English teams have not been allowed to compete in the cup since 1995. The last English winner of the Welsh Cup was Hereford United in 1990.

<text>Charles Hillman Brough (July 9, 1876 – December 26, 1935) was an American politician who served as the 25th Governor of Arkansas from 1917 to 1921. He signed a bill for women’s suffrage in Arkansas and supported it nationally.

==Biography==
Charles Brough was born in Clinton in Hinds County in central Mississippi. In 1894, he graduated from Mississippi College in Clinton. He earned his Ph.D. in 1898 from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. He graduated from the University of Mississippi Law School in 1902. He taught at Mississippi College and the former women&#x27;s institution, Hillman College, also in Clinton, Mississippi, and then the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. He was a deacon in the Baptist Church.

Brough was elected governor in 1916. He defeated attorney Wallace Townsend, an Iowa native who later served as the long-term Republican national committeeman from Arkansas. Townsend made another unsuccessful gubernatorial bid in 1920 against Brough&#x27;s successor, Thomas Chipman McRae.

During the Brough administration, numerous reforms were introduced such as the founding of the state reformatory for women and a girl&#x27;s industrial school was opened. He signed into law a bill which allowed women to vote in primary elections. Under Brough, Arkansas became the only southern state to allow women&#x27;s suffrage prior to the Nineteenth Amendment. Brough, a liberal Democrat, publicly supported anti-lynching laws. He was reelected as governor in 1918, when the Republican Party endorsed Brough against the Socialist Clay Fulks.

In 1919, the Elaine massacre in Elaine, Phillips County, took place in which white residents created false conspiracies about black residents wanting to kill whites although black residents were only trying to form a union to demand better wages as sharecroppers. Brough requested federal troops from the War Department and accompanied the troops to the scene. There, soldiers rounded up black residents and, as the Mississippi vigilantes and local posse were already doing, killed black residents indiscriminately. At least two and possibly more victims were killed by soldiers. Up to 237 black people were killed in the massacre. That was one of the deadliest racial conflicts in all of American history.

Brough was a personal friend of the Woodward family and was an early influence on prominent southern historian C. Vann Woodward.

Brough served as the director of the Public Information Bureau from 1925 to 1928 and in 1929 as president of Central Baptist College in Conway, Arkansas. He chaired the Virginia-District of Columbia Boundary Commission from 1934 to 1935. Brough was also a Civitan. Brough also unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate in 1932 but lost in the Democratic primary to Senator Hattie Caraway.

Brough died in Washington, D.C. Like many other Arkansas governors, he is interred at the Roselawn Memorial Park Cemetery in the capital city of Little Rock.

Asked how to pronounce his surname, he told &quot;The Literary Digest&quot;: &quot;Pronounced as if it were spelled &quot;bruff&quot;.&quot; (Charles Earle Funk, &quot;What&#x27;s the Name, Please?&quot;, Funk &amp; Wagnalls, 1936.)

<doc id="303889" wikidata="Q15156646" url="?curid=303889" title="Pfiesteria piscicida">
<text>Pfiesteria piscicida is a dinoflagellate species of the genus &quot;Pfiesteria&quot; that some researchers claim was responsible for many harmful algal blooms in the 1980s and 1990s on the coast of North Carolina and Maryland. North Carolinian media in the 1990s referred to the organism as the cell from hell. It is known to populate estuaries.
&quot;Piscicida&quot; means &quot;fish-killer&quot;.

==Life cycles==
Early research suggested a very complex life cycle of &quot;Pfiesteria piscicida&quot; with up to 24 different stages, spanning from cyst to several amoeboid forms with toxic zoospores. Transformations from one stage to another depend on environmental conditions such as the availability of food. However these results have become controversial as additional research has found only a simple haplontic life cycle with no toxic amoeboid stages and amoebae present on attacked fish may represent an unrelated species of protist.

==Toxicity==
&quot;Pfiesteria&quot; presumably kills fish via releasing a toxin into the water to paralyze its prey. This hypothesis has been questioned as no toxin could be isolated and no toxicity was observed in some experiments. However, toxicity appears to depend on the strains and assays used. Polymerase chain reaction-analyses suggested that the organism lacks the DNA for polyketide synthesis, the type of toxins associated with most toxic dinoflagellates. Researchers from the NOAA National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Medical University of South Carolina, and the College of Charleston (S.C.) have formally isolated and characterized the toxin in the estuarine dinoflagellete &quot;Pfiesteria piscicida&quot; as a metal complex and free radical toxin and also have identified how the organism transforms from a non-toxic to toxic state.

==Human illness==
Very little research on the human health effects of &quot;Pfiesteria&quot; toxins has been conducted. At a multi-state workshop at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, U.S., at the end of September 1997, attendees agreed on clinical symptoms that characterize a new illness associated with &quot;Pfiesteria&quot; exposure. These clinical features include:

*memory loss
*confusion
*acute skin burning (on direct contact with water); or
*three or more of an additional set of conditions (headaches, skin rash, eye irritation, upper respiratory irritation, muscle cramps, and gastrointestinal complaints (i.e., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and/or abdominal cramps).

With these criteria and environmental qualifiers (e.g., 22% of a 50-fish sample, all of the same species, have lesions caused by a toxin), it is likely that &quot;Pfiesteria&quot;-related surveillance data can better track potential illnesses.

&quot;Pfiesteria&quot; toxins have been blamed for illness in those who have come in close contact with waters where this organism is abundant. Since June 1997, the Maryland Department of Health and Hygiene has been collecting data from Maryland physicians through a statewide surveillance system on illnesses suspected of being caused by &quot;Pfiesteria&quot; toxin. As of late October 1997, illness was reported by 146 persons who had been exposed to diseased fish or to waters that were the site of suspected &quot;Pfiesteria&quot; activity. Many of these persons are watermen and commercial fishermen.

The strongest evidence of &quot;Pfiesteria&quot;-associated human illness so far comes from case studies of two research scientists who were both overcome in their North Carolina laboratory in 1993. They still complain of adverse effects on their cognitive abilities, particularly after exercising. Duke University Medical Center researchers conducted experiments on rats, which showed that the toxin appeared to slow learning but did not affect memory.

Treatment with Colestyramine shortly after exposure has been shown to alleviate symptoms.

<text>Banking in Switzerland dates to the early 18th century through Switzerland&#x27;s merchant trade and over the centuries has grown into a complex and regulated international industry. Banking is seen as very emblematic of Switzerland 
and the country has been one of the largest, if not largest, offshore financial centers and tax havens in the world since the mid-20th century, with a long history of banking secrecy, security and client confidentiality reaching back to the early 1700s. Starting as a way to protect wealthy European banking interests, Swiss banking secrecy was codified in 1934 with the passage of a landmark federal law, the Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks. These laws were used to protect assets of persons being persecuted by Nazi authorities but have also been used by people and institutions seeking to illegally evade taxes, hide assets, or to commit other financial crime.

Controversial protection of foreign accounts and assets during World War II sparked a series of proposed financial regulations seeking to limit bank secrecy, but with little resulting action. Despite various international efforts to roll back banking secrecy laws in the country which were largely minimized or reverted by Swiss social and political forces, in 2017 Switzerland agreed to &quot;automatic exchange of information&quot; (AEOI) with foreign governments and their revenue services regarding information of depositors not resident in Switzerland. This constituted &quot;de facto&quot; the end of Swiss banking secrecy for depositors who were not Swiss residents. Furthermore, after Switzerland ratified the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act agreement with the United States, because of concerns regarding their tax liability (the U.S. taxes its citizens regardless of whether they are resident in the U.S. or not) some Swiss banks have gone so far as to close accounts held by US citizens, and to ban the opening of new accounts by US citizens and by dual US-Swiss citizens, including those deemed lawful permanent Swiss residents. Thus banking secrecy remains in force only for those residing in and solely taxable in Switzerland.

Disclosing client information has been considered by Switzerland a criminal offence since the early 1900s. Employees working in Switzerland and at Swiss banks abroad have &quot;long adhered to an unwritten code similar to that observed by doctors or priests&quot;. Since 1934 Swiss banking secrecy laws have been violated to a major extent by only four people, namely: Christoph Meili (1997), Bradley Birkenfeld (2007), Rudolf Elmer (2011) and Hervé Falciani (2014). 

The Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) estimated in 2018 that Swiss banks held US$6.5 trillion in assets or 25% of all global cross-border assets. Switzerland&#x27;s main lingual hubs, Geneva (for French), Lugano (for Italian), and Zürich (for German) service the different geographical markets. It currently ranks number two behind the United States and on par with Singapore in the Financial Secrecy Index. The banks are regulated by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) and the Swiss National Bank (SNB) which derives its authority from a series of federal statutes. Banking in Switzerland has historically played, and still continues to play, a dominant role in the Swiss economy and society. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), total banking assets amount to 467% of total gross domestic product. Banking in Switzerland has been portrayed, with varying degrees of accuracy, in overall popular culture and television shows.

In 2023 Switzerland lost a lot of credibility as a banking centre after the collapse of Credit Suisse, one of the largest Swiss banks, subsequently acquired by its Swiss competitor UBS, and due to the way the affair was handled by the Swiss National Bank.

== History ==
Bank secrecy in the Swiss region can be traced to the Great Council of Geneva, which outlawed the disclosure of information about the European upper class in 1713. During the 1780s, Swiss bank accounts began insuring deposits, which contributed to their reputation for financial security. In 1815, the Congress of Vienna formally established Switzerland&#x27;s international neutrality, which led to a large capital influx. The wealthy, landlocked Switzerland saw banking secrecy as a way to build an empire similar to that of France, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Swiss historian Sébastian Guex notes in &quot;The Origins of Secret Swiss Bank Accounts&quot;:

After a small scale civil war in the 1840s between the Swiss cantons, the Swiss Federation was founded in 1848. The formation of the state, through a direct democracy, contributed to the political stability needed for banking secrecy. The mountainous terrain of Switzerland provided a natural environment in which to excavate underground vaults for storage of gold and diamonds. In the 1910s, during World War I, Swiss bankers traveled to France to advertise the country&#x27;s banking secrecy. The war&#x27;s contribution to political and economic instability sparked a rapid capital movement into Switzerland. As European countries began to increase taxes to finance the war, wealthy clients moved their holdings into Swiss accounts to avoid taxation. The French banked in Geneva, the Italians in Lugano, and the Germans in Zürich.

The Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks, colloquially known as the Banking Law of 1934, made the violation of banking secrecy a federal criminal offence. That major step beyond the prior enforcement of banking secrecy under civil law resulted from several developments of the early 1930s, including the introduction in the same legislation of an embryonic form of banking supervision, which Swiss bankers argued could endanger secrecy; evolving jurisprudence of the Federal Supreme Court; and a 1932 campaign against tax evasion in France led by Édouard Herriot&#x27;s government. Alleged wealthy French tax evaders included military generals and Catholic bishops. An additional provision, Article 47(b), was drafted before its ratification to protect Jewish assets from the Nazi party.

During World War II, Switzerland remained diplomatically neutral but its economy and financial system served the Axis powers by storing gold and cash balances in underground vaults, buying gold from the Nazi German state, and lending to both Germany and Italy, thus supporting their aggressive endeavors. Adolf Hitler maintained an account at the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) estimated at . After the United States formally asked the bank to transfer the money in the 1990s, UBS wired US$400 to 700 million worth of Reichsmarks to U.S. authorities. Banking regulations in Switzerland limit the amount of orphaned assets allowed to leave a bank&#x27;s custody. UBS, with consent from the Swiss government, froze the account containing Hitler&#x27;s assets indefinitely, and clipped the Reichsmarks, stripping the currency of value. During World War II, UBS also maintained accounts for hundreds of German Jewish businesspeople and households. After the Banking Law of 1934 was passed, the bank aggressively protected assets of the &quot;enemies of Nazi Germany&quot;. When Hitler announced an (aborted) invasion of Switzerland in 1940, UBS contracted the Swiss Armed Forces to blockade their retail banks and transport Jewish assets to underground military bunkers. The Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC) and Credit Suisse, did likewise.

===World War II and beyond===
After the end of World War II, Switzerland and its financial system benefited greatly from having remained unharmed while all the neighbouring economies were devastated, but had to face the reputational damage from its support to the Axis powers, which also led to threats to banking secrecy as the Allied victors sought to expropriate Nazi assets held under Swiss custody. By and large, the Swiss banking sector was able to successfully deflect the threat to its secrecy practices, not least as it supported France and the United Kingdom with significant lending. When British politician George Brown blamed &quot;gnomes of Zurich&quot; for a weak pound sterling in 1964, Swiss bankers began using the title as proof of their financial skill and adherence to secrecy. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, numerous international proposals for bank secrecy rollbacks were made by foreign states with little success.
After the 2008 financial crisis, Switzerland signed the European Union Savings Directive (EUSD) which obliges Swiss banks to report to 43 European countries non-identifying annual tax statistics. On December 3, 2008, the Federal Assembly increased the prison sentence for violations of banking secrecy from a maximum of six months to five years. In late 2008, after an international, multi-state investigation into Switzerland&#x27;s role in U.S. tax evasion, UBS entered into a limited, deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the U.S. Department of Justice. The agreement initiated the landmark Birkenfeld Disclosure of information on more than 4,000 clients.
In November 2013, the Zürcher Kantonalbank was classified as a systemically important bank in Switzerland by order of the Swiss National Bank (SNB), alongside UBS, Credit Suisse, Raiffeisen (Switzerland) and PostFinance, and must meet stricter capital requirements and prepare contingency plans for times of crisis. In another step toward loosening banking secrecy, Switzerland signed the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), after rejecting it twice in parliament. The FATCA requires Swiss banks to disclose non-identifying U.S. client information annually to the Internal Revenue Service. The agreement does not guarantee the semi-automatic information transfers, which remain at the discretion of Swiss government authorities. If a client does not consent to having their information shared with the IRS, Swiss law prohibits the disclosure. If a client does consent, Swiss banks send the IRS tax-related information about the account holder but are prohibited from disclosing identities pursuant to Article 47 of the Banking Law of 1934. The 2018 Financial Secrecy Index stated: &quot;this [does] not mean that Swiss banking secrecy was finished, as some excitable news reports suggest... the breach was a partial [dent]&quot;.

In March 2015, the Swiss government entered into bilateral &quot;Rubik Agreements&quot; with Germany, Austria, and the United Kingdom allowing foreign holders of Swiss bank accounts to retain their anonymity in exchange for paying predetermined back taxes. Switzerland adopted the International Convention on the Automatic Exchange of Banking Information (AEOI) in 2017, agreeing to automatically release limited financial information to certain countries for the sole purpose of tax auditing. This agreement includes the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) which obliges Swiss banks to automatically send foreign tax authorities the client&#x27;s name, address, domicile, tax number, date of birth, account number, account balance at years end, and the gross investment income. The CRS does not, however, override the Swiss Banking Law of 1934, so the client&#x27;s expenses (withdrawals) and investments are not disclosed. Thus tax authorities cannot &quot;go fishing&quot; for tax evaders, they must directly link a financial crime to the client&#x27;s account. The disclosed information can &quot;only&quot; be used for tax auditing and Swiss authorities may prevent disclosure.

In December 2017, the Swiss parliament launched a standing initiative and expressed an interest in formally embedding banking secrecy within the Swiss Constitution, making it a federally-protected constitutional right. In January 2018, a U.S. district court ruled that Swiss bankers &quot;[have] nothing to do with the choice that an American taxpayer makes to not declare offshore assets&quot;, later clarifying they should not be seen as facilitating tax evasion but rather provide a legal service that is made illegal by the client. The Swiss Justice Ministry announced in March 2018 that disclosure of client information in a pending court case involving a Swiss bank is subject to federal espionage and extortion charges in addition to charges relating to banking secrecy laws.

In 2023, Switzerland lost credibility as a banking system after the collapse of Credit Suisse, acquired by the Swiss competitor UBS, and the way the affair was handled by the Swiss National Bank.

== Banking and the Swiss economy==
Switzerland is a prosperous nation with a per capita gross domestic product higher than that of most Western European nations. The value of the Swiss franc (CHF) has been relatively stable compared with that of many others. Swiss neutrality and national sovereignty, long recognized by foreign nations, have fostered a stable environment for the banking sector to develop and thrive. Switzerland maintained neutrality through both World Wars, is not a member of the European Union or NATO, and did not join the United Nations until 2002. The Bank of International Settlements (BIS), an organization that facilitates cooperation among the world&#x27;s central banks, is headquartered in Basel. Founded in 1930, the BIS chose to locate in Switzerland because of the country&#x27;s neutrality, which was important to the organization founded by countries that had been enemies in World War I.

Banking has played a dominant role in the Swiss economy for two centuries. According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), total banking assets amount to 467% of total gross domestic product.

Swiss banks managed $2.4 trillion (CHF2.1 trillion) of assets belonging to wealthy foreigners in 2022, more than any other country and before Hong Kong ($2.2T) or Singapore ($1.5T) who are ranked 2nd and 3rd respectively, according to the study conducted by the Boston Consulting Group.

===Origin of funds===
Most of the wealth from overseas in Switzerland originates in Germany, France and Saudi Arabia (2018). According to the Swiss Bankers Association in 2022, the amount held by Russian clients in Swiss banks is between CHF150 and CHF200 billion ($160 and $214 billion).

==Regulation==

The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) is a public law institution that supervises most banking-related activities as well as securities markets and investment funds. Regulatory authority is derived from the Swiss Financial Market Supervision Act (FINMASA) and Article 98 of the Swiss Federal Constitution. The office of the Swiss Banking Ombudsman, founded in 1993, is sponsored by the Swiss Banking Ombudsman Foundation, which was established by the Swiss Bankers Association. The ombudsman&#x27;s services, which are offered free of charge, include mediation and assistance to persons searching for dormant assets. The ombudsman handles about 1,500 complaints raised against banks yearly. Generally speaking, lawyers will not work against the banks and regulators are &quot;too weak&quot; to act in case of a problem, according to the &quot;Financial Times&quot; of London.
===Automatic exchange of tax information===
In February 2013, the Swiss Federal Council allowed the signing of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) with the US. These agreements force all Swiss banks to inform the Internal Revenue Service of undeclared, offshore accounts. These new regulations are applicable from 2014, and in turn assure Swiss banks of continued operations within the US.

In July 2019, the US Senate approved the Double Taxation Treaty (DTA) with Switzerland, which had already been accepted by the Swiss parliament in 2010. The new agreement, applicable to accounts from September 23, 1999, onward, amends the tax treaty of 1996 and regulates requests for information on financial accounts by US authorities, as well as exemptions for retirement savings by US persons.

Starting in 2019, Switzerland began to share (with the country of origin or residence) the details of 3.1 million bank accounts held by foreigners, as part of the agreed automatic exchange of information. Swiss banks, insurance companies and trusts have a legal obligation to comply but charitable Swiss foundations are so far exempt. As of 2019, Switzerland received financial data from 75 countries and shared data with 63 (over 100 countries starting in 2023) representing 3.6 million accounts as of 2023. Around 9000 banks, insurers, trusts and other financial institutions in Switzerland provide this information to the Swiss authorities.

===Loopholes===
Swiss banks are obliged to reject or terminate business relationships if there are doubts about the real identity of the owner of the account. Swiss banks have a legal obligation to record the ultimate beneficial owners of all assets they handle worldwide, but doing so accurately can be tricky in jurisdictions where it is easy for third parties to mask who the owners are. Thus, loopholes exist through the use of shell companies, trust funds, and directors signing the paperwork without owning the assets.

Similarly, the use of a &quot;straw man&quot; or a family member is a way also to hide the true beneficial ownership in some cases.

Loopholes exist also with people with multiple nationalities who only declare one citizenship to the authorities for the purpose of tax reporting.

Another loophole consists (for US citizens) in setting up shell companies abroad and registering them with the IRS as &quot;offshore financial institutions&quot;. The IRS issues the entities unique Global Intermediary Identification Numbers, or GIINs, which relieve the banks of FATCA&#x27;s requirement to investigate whether they&#x27;re held by Americans. This loophole was allegedly used by billionaire Robert Brockman to avoid taxation.

The banking systems of Switzerland and Liechtenstein have close ties. Liechtenstein&#x27;s trust companies are clients of Swiss banks. Liechtenstein does not require trust companies to identify people with signatory powers, and does not prosecute tax evasion or tax fraud (2000).

To improve the tracking down and freezing of assets, Swiss NGO Public Eye has called for a national task force, a register of the beneficial owners of front companies and a reporting obligation for lawyers. The Tax Justice Network and FATF made similar recommendations in 2018, including breaking up the Big Four accounting firms. As of 2022, the Swiss government is following up on some of those recommendations. In addition, Transparency International is demanding that lawyers, financial advisors plus real estate and art transactions be subject to the same exacting anti-money laundering measures as banks.

===Enabling industry===

The &quot;enabling industry&quot; refers to lawyers, fiduciaries, notaries, and real estate agents who assist criminals in investing or hiding their ill-gotten wealth. Their activity is not covered by the Swiss Anti-Money Laundering Act as long as they are only advising clients to place money in a particular financial institution or country. Furthermore, lawyers in Switzerland can refuse to disclose almost anything to the authorities about their clients.

Under the Swiss Anti-Money Laundering Act, banks must report suspicious clients and transactions to the authorities. Lawyers and other advisors have no such obligation if they simply create trusts and other constructs rather than handle assets.

According to the Money Laundering Reporting Office Switzerland in 2017, official &quot;suspicious activity reports&quot; reached nearly 4,700 (worth $16.2 billion) up from 2,909 reported cases in 2016.

The Swiss Financial Services Act of 2020 (FinSA) requires financial advisers to obtain a licence (950 firms advising on nearly $200 billion have been approved by FINMA). The law also requires any &quot;retrocession&quot; paid by the bank to the advisor to be disclosed publicly.

===Assets seizure===

Under current rules, banking institutions and cantonal authorities can only report what is in their registers; looking into the origins of assets or connections between individuals is not permitted. For example, in 2022, a Russian oligarch reportedly handed his Swiss company over to his wife to avoid the sanctions against Russia.

Swiss authorities can &quot;freeze&quot; assets if the law requires them to. However, &quot;seizing&quot; assets is only permitted in cases involving crime or for destituted s.

At least a dozen destitute autocrats have had their assets frozen or seized by the Swiss government over the years. The amounts can be counted in billions of dollars. According to the Swiss media, some of the amounts have not yet been restituted to the people of the countries of origin to whom it properly belongs.

==Protections==
Breaches of banking secrecy laws in Switzerland are automatically processed pursuant to Article 47 of the Banking Law of 1934: those who disclose client information are subject to a maximum of five years&#x27; imprisonment and 250,000 francs (€215,000 or US$250,000) in fines. Whistleblowers and leakers of client information often face hostility from the public and sustain professional setbacks. Denounced as a criminal in Switzerland, a federal arrest warrant has been in place for Bradley Birkenfeld since 2008, after he disclosed UBS client information to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service in 2007. After the 2008 financial crisis, the Swiss Parliament initiated a series of international tax treaties that rolled back banking secrecy protections for foreign clients in response to pressure from the European Union, United States, and United Kingdom.

==Major banks==

, there are more than 400 securities dealers and banking institutions in Switzerland, ranging from the &quot;Two Big Banks&quot; down to small banks serving the needs of a single community or a few special clients. The largest and second largest Swiss banks are UBS Group AG and Credit Suisse Group AG, respectively. They account for over 50% of all deposits in Switzerland; each has extensive branch networks throughout the country and most international centers. Due to their size and complexity, UBS and Credit Suisse are subject to an extra degree of supervision from the Federal Banking Commission.

 only one in five Swiss people banks with either UBS or Credit Suisse, but most Swiss prefer one or the other. Credit Suisse was historically the bank of Protestant Zürich; UBS originated in Catholic Basel, near France.

===Swiss National Bank===

The Swiss National Bank (SNB) serves as the country&#x27;s central bank. Founded by the Federal Act on the Swiss National Bank (16 January 1906), it began conducting business on 20 June 1907. Its shares are publicly traded, and are held by the cantons, cantonal banks, and individual investors; the federal government does not hold any shares. Although a central bank often has regulatory authority over the country&#x27;s banking system, the SNB does not; regulation is solely the role of the Federal Banking Commission.

Raiffeisen Banks &quot;assumes the role of central bank&quot; in providing treasury services, and is the third largest group consisting of 328 banks in 2011, 390 in 2012 with 1,155 branches. According to the bank in 2012 non-U.S. businesses of Wegelin &amp; Co, the oldest Swiss bank, would be bought by the Raiffeisen group. The group has 3 million plus clients within Switzerland.

===UBS===


UBS Group AG came into existence in June 1998, when Union Bank of Switzerland, founded in 1862, and Swiss Bank Corporation, founded in 1872, merged. Headquartered in Zürich and Basel, it is Switzerland&#x27;s largest bank. It maintains seven main offices around the world (four in the United States and one each in London, Tokyo, and Hong Kong) and branches on five continents. UBS has been at the center of various tax evasion investigations and other criminal investigations since its founding. UBS was fined $100 million by the Federal Reserve in 2004 for trading in dollars with Iran and other sanctioned countries.

===Credit Suisse===
Credit Suisse Group was the second-largest Swiss bank. Based in Zürich and founded in 1856, Credit Suisse offers private banking, investment banking and asset management services. It acquired the First Boston Corporation in 1988 and merged with the Winterthur insurance company in 1997; the latter was sold to AXA in 2006. The asset management services were sold to Aberdeen Asset Management during the 2008 financial crisis. Credit Suisse has been at the center of various tax evasion investigations or money laundering activities since its founding.
Credit Suisse collapsed in 2023 and it was acquired by UBS the same year.

===Private banks===
The term private bank refers to a bank that offers private banking services and in its legal form is a partnership. The first private banks were created in St. Gallen in the mid-18th century and in Geneva in the late 18th century as partnerships, and some are still in the hands of the original families such as Hottinger and Mirabaud. In Switzerland, such private banks are called &quot;private bankers&quot; (in the local languages, a protected term) to distinguish them from the other private banks which are typically shared corporations. Historically in Switzerland a minimum of CHF1 million was required to open an account, however, over the last years many private banks have lowered their entry hurdles to CHF250,000 for private investors.

===Cantonal banks===

There are, as of 2006, 24 cantonal banks; these banks are state-guaranteed semi-governmental organizations controlled by one of Switzerland&#x27;s 26 cantons that engage in all banking businesses. Together the cantonal banks account for about 30% of the banking sector in Switzerland, with a network of over 800 branches and 16 000 employees in Switzerland. In 2014 consolidated total assets of all cantonal banks accounted around 500 bln CHF, which is comparable with those of one the &quot;Big Banks&quot;, UBS and Credit Suisse. The largest cantonal bank, the Zurich Cantonal Bank, has approximately 5 000 employees had a 2005 net income of CHF810 million.

==Controversies==
===Banking secrecy===

Switzerland, considered the &quot;grandfather of bank secrecy&quot;, has been one of the largest offshore financial centers and tax havens in the world since the mid-20th century. Despite an international push to meaningfully roll back banking secrecy laws in the country, Swiss political forces have minimized and reverted many of the proposed rollbacks. Disclosing client information has been considered a serious social and criminal offense since the early 1900s. Whistleblowers, despite legal protections, often face professional setbacks in Switzerland. Swiss bankers who maintain offices &quot;exclusively&quot; in Switzerland are shielded from a foreign state&#x27;s lawsuits, extradition requests, and criminal charges, as long as they remain &quot;within&quot; the country&#x27;s legal jurisdiction. In spite of minor adjustments to bank secrecy, bankers working in Switzerland and abroad at Swiss banks have long adhered to an unwritten code similar to that observed by doctors or priests. Switzerland&#x27;s main lingual hubs, Geneva (for French), Lugano (for Italian), and Zürich (for German) service the different geographical markets. It consistently ranks in the top three states on the Financial Secrecy Index and was named first many times, most recently in 2018. The Swiss Bankers Association estimated in 2018 that Swiss banks held US$6.5 trillion in assets or 25% of all global cross-border assets. These secrecy laws have linked the Swiss banking system with individuals and institutions seeking to illegally evade taxes, hide assets, or generally commit financial crime.

Secrecy laws have been violated by four people since 1934: Christoph Meili (1997), Bradley Birkenfeld (2007), Rudolf Elmer (2011), and Hervé Falciani (2014). In all four cases, the whistleblowers were served with federal arrest warrants, fined, and sustained professional setbacks in Switzerland.

As of 2015, Swiss banking secrecy was considered &quot;dead&quot; because of FATCA, but according to the Tax Justice Network in 2018, these schemes are &quot;full of loopholes and shortcomings&quot; which can still be exploited by lawyers to hide the assets of their clients. Besides, some autocratic or developing countries don&#x27;t have any automatic exchange of tax information with Switzerland.

In 2022, the Helsinki Commission of the U.S. Congress stated:

==== Freedom of the press ====
Since leaking financial data is a criminal offense in Switzerland (even if it is in the public interest) punishable with up to five years in jail, Swiss media argued in February 2022 that the banking secrecy law runs contrary to freedom of speech and freedom of the press in some cases. In 2022, the United Nations Human Rights Council asked for a better protection of journalists and whistleblowers in this regard.

==== Bank vaults and bunkers ====

A handful of larger Swiss banks operate undisclosed or otherwise secretive bank vaults, storage facilities or underground bunkers for gold bars, diamonds, or other valuable physical assets. Most of these underground bunkers are located near or at the foothills of the mountainous regions of the Swiss Alps. These facilities are not subject to the same banking regulations as banks in Switzerland and do not have to report holdings to regulatory agencies. The Swiss defense department estimates that of the ten former military bunkers available for sale, six of them were sold to Swiss banks to house assets during the 1980s and 1990s. Storage in these underground bunkers and bank vaults is typically reserved for clients that pass a multi-stage security clearance. Some of these bunkers are not accessible by road or foot and require aircraft transportation.

====Numbered bank accounts====

Many banks in Switzerland offer clients numbered bank accounts, accounts where the identity of the holder is replaced with a multi-digit number known only to the client and select private bankers. Although these accounts do add another layer of banking secrecy, they are not completely anonymous as the name of the client is still recorded by the bank and subject to limited, warranted disclosure. Some Swiss banks supplement the number with a code name such as &quot;Cardinal&quot;, &quot;Octopussy&quot; or &quot;Cello&quot; that provide an alternative means of identifying the client. However, to open this type of account in Switzerland, clients must pass a multi-stage clearance procedure and prove to the bank the lawful origins of their assets.

===Connection to illegal activities===
Swiss banks have served as safe havens for the wealth of dictators, despots, mobsters, arms dealers, corrupt officials, and tax cheats of all kinds.

Historically, mobster Meyer Lansky, Vatican-linked banker Licio Gelli of the lodge &quot;P2&quot; in Italy, Mexican president Carlos Salinas&#x27;s family amongst others, have reportedly used Swiss banks to launder money over the years.

Swiss banks have been commonly identified as holding ill-gotten Nazi gold. The Swiss National Bank, the largest gold distribution centre in continental Europe before the war, was the logical venue through which Nazi Germany could dispose of its gold.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine reported that throughout 1981 and 1982, the Israelis reportedly set up Swiss bank accounts to handle the financial end of the annual multi-million dollars arms deals between Iran and Israel during the Iran–Iraq War.

According to the Swiss Federal Prosecutor&#x27;s office and media, during the 1990s and early 2000s Al Qaeda members had accounts at Swiss banks, including at UBS.

Switzerland finally released a total of $683 million in Marcos funds to the Philippines Treasury in 2004.

Mark Pieth, a Swiss professor of criminal law, said Mobutu of Zaire had stolen US$30 billion over his 30 years in power but much of it he used to oil the wheels of power and pay off political and military allies. Billions were hidden in Swiss bank accounts illegally.

According to Haitian authorities, Jean Claude Duvalier had nearly $300 million of Haitian people&#x27;s money hidden in Swiss bank accounts.

Then-Nigerian President Sani Abacha is said to have stolen over a billion dollars in the 90&#x27;s from his country, some of it hidden in Swiss bank accounts.

In 2013, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), a Washington, D.C.–based nonprofit news organization, obtained records of companies and trusts created by two offshore companies. These included information on at least 23 companies linked to an alleged $230 million tax fraud in Russia, a case that was being investigated by Sergei Magnitsky. The ICIJ investigation also revealed that the husband of one of the Russian tax officials deposited millions in a Swiss bank account set up by one of the offshore companies.

Over the past 20 years, Switzerland has returned about $2 billion of ill-gotten money in at least ten cases, including to Tunisia, Egypt, Brazil, Nigeria, Malaysia and Uzbekistan (2022). Swiss bank accounts were utilised by the perpetrators of the 1Malaysia Development Berhad corruption and money laundering scandal.

More recent studies show that Credit Suisse alone held assets worth $100 billion over several decades which were linked to corruption and bribery to drug and human trafficking for more than 30,000 clients. Apart from the 2022 &quot;Suisse secrets&quot; revelations, Credit Suisse had several other cases of scandals reported by the media over the last decades.

In 2018, London-based Tax Justice Network ranks Switzerland&#x27;s banking sector as the &quot;most corrupt&quot; in the world due to a large offshore banking industry and very strict secrecy laws. The ranking attempts to measure how much assistance the country&#x27;s legal systems provide to money laundering, and to protecting corruptly obtained wealth.

As of 2019, key criminal probes involving Swiss banks were the Petrobras bribery case, the Mozambique &quot;tuna bonds&quot;, Credit Suisse &quot;spygate&quot; affair, Raiffeisen insider trading and UBS tax evasion in France.

In 2021, the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation reported that the Zürich police are investigating CHF 9 billion from Venezuela that has been received by 30 Swiss banks. A Swiss bank account was used to bribe a Venezuelan minister. Other major cases involving the Credit Suisse money laundering case for drug-traffickers in Bulgaria, Falcon Bank, 1MBD, Glencore, SICPA, SBM Offshore, PKB, J. Safra Sarasin, Cramer Bank and Lombard Odier Bank.

In 2021, Swiss firm Allied Finance Trust AG and five Swiss bankers were charged with tax fraud conspiracy in New York.

In 2021, UBS was criminally convicted by an appeals court in France for money laundering the proceeds of tax evasion by French citizens and fined €1.8 billion.

In 2023, Switzerland returned $138 million to Taiwan in connection with a corruption scandal relating to the sale of French frigates to Taiwan in 1991.

===Tax evasion===

Switzerland has been ranked among the top three tax havens in the world every single year since the financial crisis, most recently in 2018. In 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden also called Switzerland a &quot;tax haven&quot; during his speech to a joint session of Congress. Money placed in tax heavens, by definition, evades taxation and therefore diminishes tax revenues in the government&#x27;s budget of the country of origin to whom it properly belongs, substantially, including for development purposes.

====Background====

According to the 2018 Financial Secrecy Index, Switzerland&#x27;s banking secrecy laws have rendered it a premier tax haven since the 1900s. It also noted that this status has been frequently abused by criminals to illegally evade paying taxes in their home country. One of the most prominent attractions of the disclosure protection laws is the distinction between tax evasion (non-reporting of income) and tax fraud (active deception). Akin to the distinction between legal tax avoidance and illegal tax evasion in the U.S., the non-reporting of income is only a civil offense in Switzerland while tax fraud is a financial crime. When foreign clients deposit holdings into a Swiss bank account, the bank is legally prohibited from disclosing balances or client information to tax authorities. This prohibition can only be waived if the client has produced a written statement of consent or a financial crime has been directly linked to the bank account. More often than not, clients do not consent to foreign tax authorities, which leaves only the latter (financial crime) provision available. Many client services available in Switzerland (e.g. numbered bank accounts) are used to shield client data from tax authorities.

Many sovereign states do not legally require private bankers to confirm whether or not a client has paid their taxes, in any capacity. On top of this, Switzerland&#x27;s banking secrecy laws prohibit the disclosure of client information under a variety of federal, cantonal, and civil policies. Many foreign nationals open Swiss bank accounts to take advantage of these laws and tax distinctions. While citizens of Switzerland retain the full force of banking secrecy protections, foreign clients are afforded some of the most stringent bank–client confidentiality protections in the world. In exchange for banking services, the Swiss government charges &quot;a low, lump-sum option on the money they bank&quot;, after which Swiss tax authorities consider client tax burdens &quot;settled&quot;. After the Banking Law of 1934 was passed, Swiss bankers traveled across Europe to advertise the country&#x27;s banking secrecy during World War II. As European countries began to increase taxes to finance the war, wealthy clients moved their holdings into Swiss accounts to avoid taxation.

====Fines====
Swiss banks have collectively paid more than $12 billion in fines in recent years to the tax authorities in France, Germany, Italy, the United States and other countries for helping with tax evasion. Starting in 2022, fines on Swiss banks abroad will be tax deductible (unless crime is involved). In recent years Swiss banks have been fined by various regulators billions for FOREX and LIBOR rates manipulations.

== In popular culture ==
Banking in Switzerland, in particular Swiss banking secrecy practices, has been detailed in global popular culture to varying degrees of accuracy. According to official statements from the Swiss National Film Archives, inaccurate or exaggerated portrayals negatively impact Switzerland by reducing bankers to unflattering &quot;caricatures&quot; that are &quot;ever disposed to accept funds from questionable sources&quot;. In 2014, Sindy Schmiegel, a spokeswoman for the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA), stressed that financial regulation in Switzerland is dramatically more strict than portrayed fictionally. &quot;The Economic Times&quot; noted that popular culture portrays Swiss bank accounts as &quot;completely anonymous&quot;, later adding &quot;this is simply not true.&quot;

Swiss banking is prominently featured in the following films and television shows:

<text>Enrique Miguel Iglesias Preysler (; born 8 May 1975) is a Spanish singer and songwriter.

He started his recording career in the mid-1990s on the Mexican label Fonovisa were he released three Spanish albums Enrique Iglesias, Vivir and Cosas del Amor becoming the bestselling Spanish-language act of the decade. By the turn of the millennium, he made a successful crossover into the mainstream English-language market. He signed a multi-album deal with Universal Music Group for US$68 million with Interscope Records releasing a string of hit English albums such as Enrique, Escape, 7 and Insomniac. During this time he also released Spanish albums such as Quizás and 95/08 Éxitos under Universal Music Latin.

In 2010, Iglesias parted with Interscope Records and signed with another Universal Music Group label, Republic Records were he released two successful bilingual albums Euphoria and Sex and Love. In 2015, he parted ways with Universal Music Group after being there for over a decade. He signed with Sony Music and his subsequent albums were to be released by Sony Music Latin in Spanish and RCA Records in English.

Iglesias is one of the best-selling Latin music artists with estimated sales of over 70 million records worldwide. He has had five &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 top five singles, including two number-ones. Iglesias holds the record for the most number-one songs on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Songs chart with 27 songs and the Latin Pop Airplay chart with 24 songs. Iglesias holds the number-one position on the Greatest of All-Latin Artists charts and in October 2022 he was honored with the Top Latin Artist of All Time at the Latin Billboard Awards. Iglesias also has 14 number-ones on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Dance charts, more than any other male artist. He has earned the honorific title King of Latin Pop. In December 2016, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine named him the 14th most successful and top male dance club artist of all time.

==Early life==
Enrique Miguel Iglesias Preysler was born in Madrid, Spain, the third and youngest child of Spanish singer Julio Iglesias and Filipina socialite and magazine journalist Isabel Preysler. Iglesias was raised with two older siblings, Chábeli and Julio Jr. One of his mother&#x27;s aunts is actress Neile Adams, the first wife of American actor Steve McQueen, mother of actor Chad McQueen, and grandmother of actor Steven R. McQueen. His father&#x27;s family is from Galicia and Andalusia; his father also claims some Jewish and Puerto Rican ancestry on his mother&#x27;s side.

Iglesias found out later in life that he was born with a rare congenital condition known as situs inversus, where some of the body&#x27;s major organs, such as the heart, are situated on the opposite side of the body from where they would normally be located.

At first, Iglesias and his two siblings stayed with their mother; however, in December 1981, Iglesias&#x27;s grandfather Dr. Julio Iglesias Puga was kidnapped by the armed Basque group ETA. When Enrique was six years old he lived for a year in the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade with his mother.

For their safety, Enrique and his brother Julio were sent to live with their father in Miami. There, they were brought up mostly by the nanny, Elvira Olivares, to whom Enrique later dedicated his first album.

Iglesias attended Gulliver Preparatory School, a private high school in Miami, where he developed an interest in writing songs. He participated in his first live performance in a school production of &quot;Hello Dolly&quot;. After graduating from high school he attended the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida, where he studied business but dropped out after a year to pursue a recording career.

==Music career==
Iglesias did not want his father to know about his plans for a music career and did not want his famous surname to help advance his career. In secret he borrowed money from his family&#x27;s nanny and recorded a demo cassette tape which consisted of a Spanish song and two English songs. Approaching his father&#x27;s former publicist, Fernán Martínez, the two promoted the songs under the stage name Enrique Martínez with the backstory of being a singer from Guatemala. He was signed by Mexican record label Fonovisa and temporarily moved to Canada to record his first album.

===1995–1996: &quot;Enrique Iglesias&quot;===
On 21 November 1995, Iglesias released &quot;Enrique Iglesias&quot;, a collection of light rock ballads, including hits such as &quot;Si Tú Te Vas&quot; (If You Go Away) and &quot;Experiencia Religiosa&quot; (Religious Experience). The record was released by label Fonovisa, along with Iglesias&#x27;s following two albums. The record sold half a million copies in its first week, a rare accomplishment then for an album recorded in a language other than English. The record also ended up being certified Gold in another non-Spanish-speaking territory (Portugal) in its first week of release. The album sold million copies in its first three months and went Platinum in the United States.

His song &quot;Por Amarte&quot; was included in Televisa&#x27;s telenovela &quot;Marisol&quot;, but with a twist: instead of &quot;Por amarte daría mi vida&quot; (To love you, I&#x27;d give my life), the words were edited to suit the show, with &quot;Por amarte Marisol, moriría&quot; (To love you, Marisol, I&#x27;d die). The album also showcased Iglesias&#x27;s prowess as a polyglot, releasing both Italian and Portuguese editions, with most of the songs being sung in those languages.

Five singles were released from the album, including &quot;Por Amarte&quot;, &quot;No Llores Por Mí&quot; (Don&#x27;t Cry for Me) and &quot;Trapecista&quot; (Trapezist), all of which topped several of &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Latin music charts. The album still holds the record for most number-one singles on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot Latin Songs chart. The album went on to win Iglesias the Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Performance.

===1997–1998: &quot;Vivir&quot; and &quot;Cosas del Amor&quot;===
In 1997, Iglesias&#x27;s stardom continued to rise with the release of &quot;Vivir&quot; (&quot;To Live&quot;), which elevated him to the levels of popular English-language musicians (in sales) that year. The album also included a cover version of the Yazoo song &quot;Only You&quot;, translated into Spanish as &quot;Solo en Ti&quot;.

Three singles were released from &quot;Vivir&quot;: &quot;Enamorado Por Primera Vez&quot; (In Love For the First Time), &quot;Solo en Ti&quot;, and &quot;Miente&quot; (Lie), which topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Songs chart as well as the charts of several Spanish-speaking countries. Along with his father and Luís Miguel, Iglesias was nominated for an American Music Award in the first-ever awarded category of Favorite Latin Artist. Iglesias lost out to his father, but performed the song &quot;Lluvia Cae&quot; (Rain is Falling) at the event.

Insistent on playing large stadiums for his first concert tour that summer, Iglesias, backed by sidemen for Elton John, Bruce Springsteen, and Billy Joel, played to sold-out audiences in sixteen countries. Beginning in Odessa, Texas, the tour went on to play three consecutive nights in Mexico City&#x27;s Plaza de Toros, two nights at Monterrey&#x27;s Auditorio Coca-Cola, and two nights (with over 50,000 attendees each) at the Estadio Ciudad de La Plata in Argentina, totaling over 130,000 people. Additionally, Iglesias toured to 19 large indoor arenas in the U.S.

In 1998, Iglesias released his third album &quot;Cosas del Amor&quot; (&quot;Things of Love&quot;). Taking a more mature musical direction, the album, aided by the popular singles &quot;Esperanza&quot; (Hope) and &quot;Nunca Te Olvidaré&quot; (I&#x27;ll Never Forget You), both of which topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Songs chart and helped cement his status in the Latin music scene.

Iglesias did a shorter tour of smaller venues to accompany the release of the album, with one show being televised from Acapulco, México. This was followed by another larger world tour, consisting of over 80 shows, in even bigger venues. The &quot;Cosas del Amor&quot; Tour was the first ever concert tour sponsored by McDonald&#x27;s.

He won the American Music Award for Favorite Latin Artist for a second time, this time winning against Ricky Martin and Chayanne. The song &quot;Nunca te Olvidaré&quot; was also used as the theme song for a Spanish soap opera of the same name and Iglesias guest-starred and sang the song live on the finale episode of the series.

===1999–2000: &quot;Enrique&quot;===
In 1999, Iglesias began a successful crossover career into the English-language pop music market. Thanks to other successful Latin crossover acts, most notably Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez, and soon thereafter Shakira, Spanish-language and Latino musicians experienced a great surge in popularity amongst the public. After attending one of Iglesias&#x27;s concerts in March 1999, American actor Will Smith asked Iglesias to contribute a song to the soundtrack of his upcoming movie &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;; Iglesias&#x27;s contribution of &quot;Bailamos&quot; was released as a single that year, becoming an international hit and peaking at number one on the US &quot;Billboard Hot 100&quot;.

After the success of &quot;Bailamos&quot;, several mainstream record labels were eager to sign Iglesias. Signing a multi-album deal, after weeks of negotiations with Interscope, Iglesias recorded and released his first full record in English, &quot;Enrique&quot;. The pop album featured some clear Latin musical influences, and took two months to complete. It contained the popular song &quot;Rhythm Divine&quot;, a duet with Whitney Houston titled &quot;Could I Have This Kiss Forever&quot;, and a cover of the Bruce Springsteen song &quot;Sad Eyes&quot;.

In 2000, Iglesias performed at the Super Bowl XXXIV halftime show with Christina Aguilera, Phil Collins and Toni Braxton. Shock jock Howard Stern repeatedly played a tape of a (supposedly) very off-key Iglesias on his radio show, accusing him of &quot;not being able&quot; to sing live. On 8 June 2000, Iglesias came to New York and sang the song, live and unplugged, on Stern&#x27;s show with just an accompanying guitarist. After the performance, the two had an interview, and Stern remarked, &quot;I respect you for coming in here; you really can sing.&quot; Iglesias noted that the recording could have been him, but that it was probably a recording made during a television taping where he was required to lip sync and not sing properly. He would remark that the controversy was the best promotion he could have. The album&#x27;s single &quot;Be with You&quot; became Iglesias&#x27;s second number-one single on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot 100 chart.

=== 2001–2002: &quot;Escape&quot; and &quot;Quizas&quot; ===
In 2001, Iglesias released his second English-language album &quot;Escape&quot;. Where most of the Latin crossover acts of the previous year experienced some difficulty matching the record sales of their first English-language albums, Iglesias actually went on to sell even more with the album being certified Diamond for shipments of over 10 million copies. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Hero&quot;, became a number-one hit in the United Kingdom, and in many other countries. The entire album was co-written by Iglesias.

&quot;Escape&quot; is his biggest commercial success to date. The singles &quot;Escape&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Turn Off the Lights&quot; became radio staples, placing highly or topping various charts both in North America and elsewhere. A second edition of the album was released internationally and contained a new version of one of Iglesias&#x27;s favorite tracks, &quot;Maybe&quot;, as well as a duet with Lionel Richie called &quot;To Love a Woman&quot;.

Iglesias capitalized on the album&#x27;s success with his &quot;One-Night Stand World Tour&quot; consisting of fifty sold-out shows in sixteen countries. Including Radio City Music Hall and three consecutive nights in London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall, the tour ended with a big show at Lia Manoliu Stadium in Bucharest, Romania. The concert launched MTV Romania, with the video for &quot;Love to See You Cry&quot; being the first music video to be shown on the channel.

In 2002, Iglesias decided to release a fourth Spanish-language album titled &quot;Quizás&quot; (&quot;Perhaps&quot;). A more polished musical production than his previous Spanish albums and containing more introspective songs, the album&#x27;s title track is a song about the strained relationship Iglesias has with his famous father.

The album debuted at number twelve on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart, the highest placement of a Spanish-language album on the chart at that period. &quot;Quizás&quot; sold a million copies in a week, making it the fastest-selling album in Spanish in five years. All three singles released from the album all ended up topping the Latin chart, giving Iglesias a total of sixteen number ones on the chart. He currently holds the record for the most number-one singles on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Latin Chart. With the song &quot;Para Qué La Vida&quot; Iglesias reached a million spins on U.S. radio becoming the first Latin act to do so. The video to the song &quot;Quizás&quot; was the first Spanish-language music video to be added to the selection on MTV&#x27;s popular show &quot;Total Request Live&quot;.The album went on to win the Latin Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album.

That year he embarked on an arena tour of the Americas. The &quot;Don&#x27;t Turn Off the Lights&quot; tour was completed in the summer of 2002, with two sold-out nights in Madison Square Garden and another two in Mexico&#x27;s National Auditorium. The tour finished with a single show in the Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

=== 2003–2004: &quot;Seven&quot; ===
By 2003, Iglesias had released his seventh album, which he called &quot;7&quot;, the second to be entirely co-written by him. The album&#x27;s sound was heavily influenced by 80s rock and pop. The album features the song &quot;Roamer&quot;, which he wrote with his friend and longtime guitarist Tony Bruno and also featured an appearance from Kara DioGuardi, it also contains &quot;Be Yourself&quot;, a song about independence; the chorus talks about how Iglesias&#x27;s parents did not believe he&#x27;d ever succeed in his singing career. The first single was the song &quot;Addicted&quot;, and was followed closely by a remix of the song &quot;Not in Love&quot;, featuring Kelis which was a hit in the UK, Australia, Europe and Asia.

The Seven World Tour was sponsored by Pepsi with Iglesias featuring in an commercial alongside Britney Spears, Beyoncé and Pink and a second ad which featured Not In Love. His biggest world tour to date started with twelve shows in the United States ending with Iglesias playing at Houston Rodeo, and continued on to several countries, most of which he&#x27;d never previously visited, playing to sold-out stadiums and arenas in Australia, India, Egypt, and Singapore, before ending his tour in South Africa.

===2007–2009: &quot;Insomniac&quot;, &quot;95/08 Éxitos&quot; and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;===
After a two-year hiatus, Iglesias released his new album &quot;Insomniac&quot; on 12 June 2007. The album was so named due to it being recorded mainly at night. The record had a more contemporary pop style than that of his previous albums. Its highlights includes his first collaboration with a rapper on &quot;Push&quot;, featuring Lil Wayne, as well as &quot;Ring My Bells&quot; which had featured on the commercial for Tommy Hilfiger&#x27;s True Star Men and a cover of Ringside&#x27;s &quot;Tired of Being Sorry&quot;.

The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Do You Know? (The Ping Pong Song)&quot;, was released on 10 April 2007. It was Iglesias&#x27;s highest-charting song on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 since &quot;Escape&quot;. The song was also a hit throughout Europe, peaking in the top 10 in many countries. The Spanish version of the song, titled &quot;Dímelo&quot;, was number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Songs chart for eleven weeks.

Iglesias followed up with the ballad &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Me&quot;, which was released as a single in North America. The song was played extensively on AC radio and peaked high on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot AC. In Europe, the second single was &quot;Tired of Being Sorry&quot;, which performed well in many countries; he recorded a version of the song with French singer Nâdiya, which was number one in France for eleven weeks. A solo version of &quot;Push&quot; was added to the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Step Up 2 the Streets&quot;. The song was regarded as the third single from the album. A music video was released which features the film&#x27;s lead actors.

On 4 July 2007, Iglesias became the first Western artist to play a concert in Syria in three decades when he performed for a sold-out crowd of ten thousand in the capital Damascus and in the same week, he performed on Live Earth in Hamburg.

The Insomniac World Tour was launched at the Coca-Cola Dome in Johannesburg, South Africa, the same venue he ended his last world tour, and took him to sold-out arenas throughout Europe. It was his first arena tour of the UK, with him playing venues such as Manchester&#x27;s MEN Arena and Wembley Arena. The tour ended with Iglesias performing at the newly opened L.A. Live. A second leg of the tour took him throughout Latin America.

Iglesias&#x27;s song &quot;Can You Hear Me&quot; was chosen as the official song of the UEFA Euro 2008 football tournament. He performed the song live at the 29 June 2008 final in Vienna, Austria. The song featured on a re-issue of &quot;Insomniac&quot;, which was released in certain countries.

Iglesias released a Spanish greatest hits album titled &quot;95/08 Éxitos&quot; on 25 March 2008, which included his seventeen number-one songs on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Songs chart plus two new songs. The first single was the song &quot;¿Dónde Están Corazón?&quot;, which was written by Argentine star Coti, and became Iglesias&#x27;s eighteenth number-one single on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot Latin Songs. The album debuted at number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Latin Albums chart and number eighteen on the overall &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart. It was Iglesias&#x27;s second Spanish album to debut in the top 20 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 (&quot;Quizás&quot; debuted at number twelve in 2002). The album was certified double Platinum (Latin field) in the U.S.

The record&#x27;s second single, &quot;Lloro Por Ti&quot;, also reached number one on the Hot Latin Songs chart and had an official remix featuring Wisin &amp; Yandel. Iglesias did a tour of the US to promote the compilation. Beginning in Laredo, Texas, and ending at the Izod Center in New Jersey, he was accompanied through most of the tour with bachata band Aventura, who also performed &quot;Lloro Por Ti&quot; with him at the 2008 Premios Juventud.

Iglesias was a surprise performer at the 2008 Lo Nuestro Awards, opening the show with a medley of &quot;¿Dónde Están Corazón?&quot; and &quot;Dímelo&quot;. He also performed at the &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Music Awards.

After the success of his Spanish greatest hits compilation, Iglesias released a compilation of his English-language hits on 11 November. The album includes &quot;Can You Hear Me&quot; as well as two new songs. The first single, &quot;Away&quot;, features Sean Garrett, and was followed by &quot;Takin&#x27; Back My Love&quot;, featuring Ciara. The album debuted at number three on the official UK Albums Chart were it went double Platinum in both the UK and Ireland.

Iglesias was the winner of two World Music Awards in the categories of &quot;World&#x27;s Best Selling Latin Performer&quot; and &quot;World&#x27;s Best Selling Spanish Artist&quot; at the ceremony held in Monaco on 9 November 2008.

===2010–2011: &quot;Euphoria&quot;===
On 5 July 2010, Iglesias released his ninth studio album &quot;Euphoria&quot;, his first work to be released under his new label Universal Republic. The album is Iglesias&#x27;s first bilingual album, with seven original English songs and six original Spanish songs. Iglesias worked with three producers whom he had collaborated with before: RedOne, Mark Taylor, and Carlos Paucar. In a joint venture with Universal Latino, Iglesias released different singles in both English and Spanish simultaneously to different formats.

The first English single from the album, &quot;I Like It&quot;, which features the rapper Pitbull, was released on 3 May 2010 in the U.S. and became a success, reaching No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The song was also featured in the MTV reality series &quot;Jersey Shore&quot;. &quot;Cuando Me Enamoro&quot; was released as the lead Spanish single from the album, and became the theme song of the Mexican telenovela of the same title, produced by Televisa. The song debuted at number eight and number twenty-five on the U.S. Latin Pop Songs chart and the U.S. Hot Latin Songs chart, respectively. It became his twenty-fifth top ten single on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Songs chart and after four weeks of its release date, it became his twenty-first No.1 song on this chart. In Europe and Asia Iglesias releases Heartbeat with Nicole Scherzinger which became a Top 10 in many EU countries. In Australia there was a remix with Havana Brown and a Bollywood version with Sunidhi Chauhan was released in India.

In January 2011, the album&#x27;s third English single, &quot;Tonight (I&#x27;m Fuckin&#x27; You)&quot; featuring Ludacris and DJ Frank E broke into the top ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, also reaching No. 4. The song was released only for digital download in the United States but was featured on some editions of &quot;Euphoria&quot; in Europe and some Asian areas. The song became Iglesias&#x27; first number one on the U.S. Pop Songs and Radio Songs airplay charts. A remix version of the album track &quot;Dirty Dancer&quot; with Usher and Lil Wayne was released as the fourth English single and became his ninth Hot Dance Club Play chart topper, tying with Prince and Michael Jackson as the male with the most No. 1 dance singles. In the Latin market he released the song No Me Digas Que No which was his third collaboration with Wisin y Yandel and topped the Hot Latin Songs chart. Further, &quot;Ayer&quot; served as the album&#x27;s third Spanish single and seventh single overall. The Euphoria Tour took Iglesias across the U.S., Canada, the U.K., and several European countries. One of the tour&#x27;s legs took him to Australia, while fellow artist Pitbull joined him as an opening act. Prince Royce also served as opening act during the tour&#x27;s second leg across North America.

Euphoria won the &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Award for Top Latin Album, the &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Awards for Latin Album of the Year and Latin Pop Album of the Year, and was nominated for the Latin Grammy Award for Album of the Year.

In August 2011, Iglesias released the single &quot;I Like How It Feels&quot; to radio. He would perform the track alongside Tonight (I&#x27;m Lovin&#x27; You) and I Like It and the 2011 American Music Awards and the Dallas Cowboys vs Miami Dolphins Thanksgiving halftime show along Ludacris and Pitbull.

Later that year he returned to India in October 2012 to perform another series of shows called Tri-City tour in Pune, Delhi, and Bangalore playing to sold-out arenas and stadiums. On 31 May 2013, Iglesias performed at the Mawazine Festival in Rabat, Morocco. The show broke the highest attendance record as more than 120,000 fans gathered to watch the concert.

Iglesias released a number of singles prior to the album release, the first of which was &quot;Turn the Night Up&quot; followed by &quot;Heart Attack&quot; which was released to US Top 40 radio stations. Latin stations were served with the song &quot;Loco&quot;, a smooth bachata duet with urban bachata superstar Romeo Santos. The single became Iglesias&#x27; 24th No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot Latin Songs chart. A version of the song released in Spain featured Spanish Flamenco singer India Martinez and topped the charts in Spain. This was followed by El Perdedor, a duet with Mexican singer Marco Antonio Solis and was the theme to the telenovela Lo que la vida me robó. The song became his 24th #1 on the Latin charts.

On 14 March 2014, Iglesias released his tenth studio album, &quot;Sex and Love&quot;. The release of the album was accompanied by the single I&#x27;m a Freak and featured Pitbull. The album also featured a duet with Kylie Minogue called &quot;Beautiful&quot;, which appears on her twelfth studio album &quot;Kiss Me Once&quot;. In addition to the previously stated collaborations, the album featured guest appearances by Flo Rida, Yandel, Juan Magan, Jennifer Lopez, and Gente de Zona.
The next single to be released from the album was &quot;Bailando&quot;, featuring Descemer Bueno, and Gente De Zona. &quot;Bailando&quot; was immensely successful becoming his 25th #1 on Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart. Bailando was #1 for 41 consecutive weeks on Billboard&#x27;s Hot Latin songs chart becoming the longest reigning #1 in the history of the chart beating the record previously held by Shakira&#x27;s 25 week run. This record was later broken in 2017 when &quot;Despacito&quot; by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee featuring Justin Bieber Bailando was also a crossover success in part due to a Spanglish version of the song which featured rapper Sean Paul which saw the song peak at #12 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot 100 and Top 10 on the airplay chart becoming the highest charting Spanish song since the Macarena in 1996. The original Spanish music video of the song was also YouTube&#x27;s second most watched music video of 2014, behind Katy Perry&#x27;s hit single, &quot;Dark Horse&quot; and was the first Spanish language video to reach a billion views on the platform. &quot;Bailando&quot; currently has over 3 billion views on YouTube. The song won three Latin Grammy awards including Song of the Year. In addition to the original Spanish version, Iglesias also released two Portuguese versions of the song featuring the Portuguese singer Mickael Carreira and the Brazilian singer Luan Santana.

&quot;Sex and Love&quot; was Spotify&#x27;s 7th most-streamed album worldwide in 2014, and &quot;Bailando&quot; was the most-streamed song in both Mexico and Spain. Iglesias was also called the King of 2014, due to his tenth album, &quot;Sex and Love&quot;, and his hit single &quot;Bailando&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; called him &quot;The Crowd Pleaser&quot; of 2014. After more than a decade with Universal Music, Iglesias left the record label in 2015 and signed on with Sony Music.

===2015–present: &quot;Final&quot;===

Since the release of &quot;Sex and Love&quot;, Iglesias continued issuing singles. In 2015, he collaborated with Nicky Jam on the reggaeton megahit &quot;El Perdón&quot; which topped the charts in several countries and has over 1.3 billion views on YouTube. In 2016 Iglesias released his first single under Sony: &quot;Duele el Corazón&quot; featuring Wisin, which also topped the charts in several countries including the US Latin charts and also has over 1 billion views on YouTube.

The song &quot;Me Pasé&quot; featuring Farruko was released on 1 July 2021 and became a hit on Latin radio topping the Latin Rhythm Airplay chart, as well as extended his record for most #1s on Latin Pop Airplay Chart and reclaiming his record for most #1s on the Latin Airplay Chart.

Enrique announced his next album would be released in two volumes and be called &quot;Final&quot;, as they would be his last albums. Iglesias claimed, &quot;it&#x27;s something that I have been thinking about for the past few years&quot; but also insisted, &quot;I&#x27;m never going to stop writing songs because I love writing songs, but I&#x27;m going to do it in a different way, meaning they don&#x27;t necessarily have to be packaged as an album, so this project to me is important&quot;. On 17 September 2021 Iglesias released &quot;Final (Vol. 1)&quot;, which included his string of hits from 2015 on wards as well as new tracks such as the singles &quot;Pendejo&quot;, and &quot;Te Fuiste&quot; which featured Puerto Rican rapper Myke Towers. The album has over 3 billion audio streams and was certified 6× Platinum (Latin category) in the US

Also in 2021, Iglesias embarked on a co-headline tour with Ricky Martin. The tour was originally planned for a year earlier but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The tour consisted of twenty-six arena dates across North America and featured Colombian pop star Sebastian Yatra as the opening act. A year later Iglesias embarked on another co-headline tour of North America with both Martin and Pitbull. Named &quot;The Trilogy Tour&quot; originally consisted of twenty-four dates and a second leg of fourteen dates due to popular demand.

The song was later translated into English as &quot;First Day of My Life&quot; and recorded by Spice Girl Melanie C for her album &quot;Beautiful Intentions&quot; (2005). The song has since gone to become a huge hit throughout Europe, and peaked in the number one spot in numerous countries. Iglesias also co-wrote the single &quot;The Way&quot; for &quot;American Idol&quot; runner-up Clay Aiken. Four songs co-written by Iglesias appear on the UK band The Hollies&#x27; 2006 album &quot;Staying Power&quot;.

In 2013, Iglesias urged his followers to donate money through the American Red Cross to help the victims of the deadly Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines. The typhoon struck one month after the Philippines was hit by a 7.2-magnitude earthquake which destroyed homes and livelihoods of around 350,000 people.

<text>The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) is a public research university in El Paso, Texas, United States. Founded in 1913 as the State School of Mines and Metallurgy, it is the second oldest academic component of the University of Texas System.

UTEP is an &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot; institution on the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. It is the largest and oldest Hispanic-serving R1 university in the contiguous United States, exceeded only by institutions in Puerto Rico.

The campus is on located on hillsides overlooking the Rio Grande river, with Ciudad Juárez in view across the Mexico–United States border. It includes the Sun Bowl stadium, which hosts the annual college football competition the Sun Bowl every winter. Multiple campus buildings are in the Dzong architectural style, typical of Bhutan and Tibet.

==History==

===Early history===

On April 16, 1913, SB 183 was signed by the Texas governor allocating funding for a new educational institution that would later become UTEP, making it the second oldest academic institution in the University of Texas system. The school officially opened on September 28, 1914, with 27 students in buildings belonging to the former El Paso Military Institute on a site adjacent to Fort Bliss on the Lanoria Mesa. The school was founded in 1913 as the State School of Mines and Metallurgy, and a practice mineshaft survives on the campus. By 1916, enrollment had grown to 39 students, including its first two female students, Ruth Brown and Grace Odell.

On October 29, 1916, a devastating fire destroyed the main building of the school, prompting its relocation. In 1917, the new school facility was constructed on its present site above Mundy Heights at the Paso del Norte, with the land donated by several El Paso residents. In a period when United States architects were designing in styles adopted especially from Europe, Kathleen Worrell, wife of the university&#x27;s dean, was attracted by photographs of the Kingdom of Bhutan in a 1914 issue of &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine, which showed the &quot;dzong&quot; architecture style of its Buddhist monasteries. The resemblances between the local terrain and mountainous features of Bhutan inspired her to propose designing early buildings of the mining school in the dzong style. Liking its distinctiveness, administrations have continued to choose that style for additional facilities, including the Sun Bowl football stadium and parking garages. Dzong architecture has characteristics such as sloping sides, markedly overhanging roofs, and bands of colored decoration.

The University of Texas Board of Regents changed the name of the institution in 1919 first to the Department of Mines and Metallurgy and then to the College of Mines and Metallurgy of the University of Texas (TCM) in 1920. The school&#x27;s name was changed again in 1949 to Texas Western College of The University of Texas (TWC) or simply Texas Western College.

Notable events at UTEP include the training in 1961 of the nation&#x27;s first Peace Corps class, the construction of Sun Bowl Stadium in 1963, and the winning of the 1966 NCAA basketball tournament.

===The University of Texas at El Paso===
When the 60th Texas State Legislature designated the University of Texas as The University of Texas System in 1967, the name of the school was changed to The University of Texas at El Paso. While the 1967 law designated &quot;U.T. El Paso&quot; as the school&#x27;s official abbreviated name, the school is more commonly referred to by its trademarked name of &quot;UTEP&quot;. Known as the Miners since the school&#x27;s opening in 1914, TCM&#x27;s students painted a large &quot;M&quot; for Miners on the Franklin Mountains in 1923; this was later moved to a site adjacent to the Sun Bowl Stadium in the 1960s where it remains today.

The school has had achievements in academic and sports areas. In 1969, UTEP won the first of seven NCAA Men&#x27;s Cross Country Championships. In 1974, UTEP&#x27;s first doctoral degree program in Geological Sciences was approved. Also in 1974, UTEP won the first of seven NCAA Men&#x27;s Indoor Track and Field Championships. In 1975 UTEP won both the NCAA Men&#x27;s Outdoor and Indoor National Championships. UTEP is only one of a handful of universities to win at least 21 NCAA national championships in multiple sports.

The campus expanded in 1976 with the completion of the Engineering-Science Complex. That same year, the College of Nursing was founded. In 1977, the Special Events Center (now the Don Haskins Center) was built, featuring a 12,000-seat capacity for sporting events, live concerts, and other performances. An expansion of Sun Bowl Stadium followed in 1982, increasing its capacity to 52,000. The six-story University Library opened its doors to the public for the first time in 1984.

In 1988, Diana Natalicio became UTEP&#x27;s first woman president. When she stepped down in August 2019, she was the longest-serving sitting president of a major public research university. In 1989, UTEP&#x27;s second doctoral program was approved (in electrical engineering). Doctoral programs in computer engineering, psychology, and environmental science and engineering followed in 1991, 1993, and 1995, respectively. The university&#x27;s cooperative pharmacy and nursing doctorate programs began in 1996 and 2000, respectively. A biological sciences doctorate program was started in 1997 and a history doctorate followed in 1999. Doctoral programs in international business, civil engineering, and rhetoric and composition were started in 2003.
In 1999, UTEP launched its MBA online degree program. It was designated as a Comprehensive Doctoral/Research-Intensive University by the Carnegie Foundation the following year. In 2002, the $11 million Larry K. Durham Sports Center opened and the Sam Donaldson Center for Communication Studies was established. The Academic Services and Biosciences buildings as well as the Engineering-Science complex in 2003. UTEP celebrated its 90th anniversary the next year with the Miners football team going to the Houston Bowl, and the men&#x27;s basketball team made its 15th NCAA tournament appearance.

In August 2019, Heather Wilson became UTEP&#x27;s 11th president. She previously served as the Secretary of the U.S. Air Force.

In June 2023 the university was placed on &quot;Warning&quot; status by its accreditor, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, after the accreditor&#x27;s board found significant non-compliance with its standards for full-time faculty employment, program availability, qualified administrative staff, and academic program coordination.

==Academics and research==

The University of Texas at El Paso is subdivided into nine colleges and schools, each of which offers a variety of degree programs including undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate. UTEP offers 74 undergraduate degrees, 76 master&#x27;s-level degrees, and 22 doctoral degrees. UTEP follows a semester system with a spring, summer, and fall semester annually, along with a shorter wintermester in the month of January.

UTEP offers the USA&#x27;s only bilingual M.F.A. creative writing program.

UTEP reported $145.7 million in research and development expenditures for fiscal year 2023.
UTEP is classified as an &quot;R1: Research University (Highest research activity)&quot; in the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education.

==Campus architecture==


In 1916, only two years after the school opened, the original campus buildings were destroyed in a fire. The school was rebuilt on its present site in 1917. Kathleen Worrell, the wife of the school&#x27;s first dean, Steve H. Worrell, had seen pictures of Bhutanese buildings in an April 1914 issue of &quot;National Geographic&quot;. Noting the similarity of mountainous Bhutan (which is in the Himalayas) to the location of the campus, she suggested the new buildings be in the style of Bhutanese &quot;dzongs&quot; (monastic fortresses), with massive sloping walls and overhanging roofs. This idea was enthusiastically accepted by all.

El Paso architect Charles Gisbon of the firm Gibson and Robertson originated the Bhutanese Revival building designs. However, the school&#x27;s governing board purchased the designs and awarded them to prominent El Paso architect Henry Trost. Since then, all buildings through 1950 have followed this style, including those designed by Trost&#x27;s successor, Percy McGhee. In 2024, the student body voted to demolish one of the original Bhutanese Revival buildings under a new campus master plan, which called for razing several more historic structures through 2034. 

The kingdom of Bhutan has honored UTEP&#x27;s adoption of their country&#x27;s style. Prince Jigyel Ugyen Wangchuk has visited the campus, and in 2009 the Kingdom presented UTEP with a hand-carved wooden temple to be erected on the campus.

The Himalayan style of UTEP&#x27;s campus made it an appropriate site for the Chenrezig Himalayan Cultural Center of El Paso, a Tibetan Buddhist facility.

==School colors and logo==
Since the school was established as a department of the main branch of the University of Texas at Austin, the school&#x27;s colors were originally orange and white. However, in the early 1980s, Columbia blue was added so now the official colors are orange, white, and blue. When the new UTEP athletic department logo was introduced in the fall of 1999, a darker hue of blue was incorporated into the logo, as well as a silver accent to go with the customary orange.

==Athletics==
UTEP was the first college in the American South to integrate its intercollegiate sports programs. This change was made in the 1950s. When Don Haskins became basketball coach in 1961, he aggressively recruited black players. In 1966, Haskins&#x27; Miners won the NCAA basketball championship, defeating an all-white Kentucky team, 72-65 in the championship game. The Miners finished the season with a 28-1 record. At a time when many claimed black players lacked the mental and emotional &quot;necessities&quot; to compete at a high level, Haskins put his usual starting players in the championship game. They were the first all-black team to start in a game at that level. This story was retold in Haskins&#x27; autobiography &quot;Glory Road&quot; (2005) and in the 2006 film &quot;Glory Road&quot;, a production with a few historical errors, such as a game at Commerce, Texas that never occurred. Haskins coached his entire career at UTEP and compiled a 719–353 record with only five losing seasons. He was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1997, and the special events center was renamed the Don Haskins Center. He retired from coaching in 1999, and died in 2008. The entire 1966 UTEP team was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2007.

In 1968, the UTEP track &amp; field program revoked the scholarships of eight black athletes after they boycotted a meet at Brigham Young University in protest of perceived racism at BYU and in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints of the era. This included future gold medal winner and world record long jump holder Bob Beamon, who would briefly return to the school after the incident but not graduate. The coach at the time later regretted his actions, and felt that he and the school acted hastily.

UTEP&#x27;s sports programs have won a total of 21 NCAA Division I national championships. UTEP is tied for 10th overall among schools in Men&#x27;s Sports Division I championships.
*Men&#x27;s basketball: 1 (1966; the first of two NCAA men&#x27;s basketball titles won by a university from the state of Texas)
*Men&#x27;s cross country: 7 (an eighth title was vacated by the NCAA following the championship)
*Men&#x27;s indoor track &amp; field: 7
*Men&#x27;s outdoor track &amp; field: 6

UTEP owns the two largest venues in El Paso, Texas:
*Sun Bowl Stadium, seating capacity 51,500, opened its doors in 1963 and is the home to the UTEP football team and to the annual Sun Bowl game.
*Don Haskins Center, seating capacity 12,000, was built in 1976 and is primarily used by the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams. It is also known as &quot;The Bear&#x27;s Den&quot; as well as &quot;The Don.&quot; The arena is also used for concerts by mainstream artists.
*University Field (UTEP), seating capacity 500, was built in 1991 and hosts the women&#x27;s soccer team.
*Kidd Field, seating capacity 15,000, home of UTEP Track and Field teams.

In 2005, UTEP moved to Conference USA from the Western Athletic Conference.

On December 10, 2012, it was announced that Sean Kugler would be taking over as the new UTEP football coach.

In 2010, Tim Floyd became the head basketball coach. He was a protege of Haskins and is a former coach at the University of New Orleans, the NBA&#x27;s Chicago Bulls and New Orleans Hornets, and the University of Southern California. Floyd retired in 2017 due to recurring health issues and was succeeded by Rodney Terry, former head coach at CSU Fresno (Fresno State).

===Pickaxe hand symbol===
This hand symbol represents the traditional tool used by miners, the pickaxe, and is similar to the shaka sign and the letter Y in American sign language. This gesture is made by UTEP fans when UTEP players are shooting free throws at basketball games, or any time UTEP kicks off at a football game. It originated during a cheer camp by the UTEP cheerleading squad during the early 1980s.

===Nickname===
The first reference to the nickname &quot;Miners&quot; is found in the February 1919 (volume 1, number 1) issue of the &quot;Prospector&quot;, the school&#x27;s student newspaper. However, an earlier reference can be found in the handwritten bill (Senate Bill 183) that established the school in 1913, where the author, State Senator Claude Hudspeth, mistakenly wrote &quot;Miners&quot; instead of &quot;Mines,&quot; and thus referred to the school as the &quot;State School of Miners and Metallurgy.&quot; It is presumed the nickname &quot;Miners&quot; came from the fact the school was founded as the &quot;State School of Mines and Metallurgy.&quot; In doing research on this project, early mention of &quot;Ore Diggers&quot; and &quot;Muckers&quot; for the nickname was found, but nothing to determine if the name &quot;Miners&quot; was voted upon by the student body, or if a faculty member, John W. (Cap) Kidd, chose the name. Kidd was a big booster of athletics, especially football, and in 1915, when funds were lean at the school, Kidd donated $800 to equip the football team, though there is no evidence other than anecdotal he contributed this amount. He also assisted with coaching, although he was not the head coach. The present track facility on campus, Kidd Field, bears Cap Kidd&#x27;s name.

===School songs===
&quot;The Eyes of Texas&quot; was adopted by the 1920 student body after the song had been &quot;declared the school anthem for the University of Texas at Austin&quot;.

UTEP&#x27;s original fight song, &quot;Miners Fight&quot;, was also borrowed from the Austin campus. With the permission of the estate of Marty Robbins, the UTEP Music Department in the late 1980s wrote new words to the melody of his Grammy Award-winning country-western hit &quot;El Paso&quot;. This gave UTEP a fight song all its own, to a tune recognized across the nation.

===Rivalries===
New Mexico State University: UTEP has a strong rivalry with New Mexico State University, known as &quot;The Battle of I-10&quot;. UTEP and NMSU are just over 40 miles apart.

<doc id="303911" wikidata="Q804148" url="?curid=303911" title="Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde">
<text>Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde is the debut album by the American hip hop collective the Pharcyde. It was released on November 24, 1992, through Delicious Vinyl. The album was produced by former group member J-Swift, and features a guest appearance by Los Angeles rapper Bucwheed (known then as &quot;Buckwheat&quot;, from the Wascals). In the years after its release, &quot;Bizarre Ride&quot; has been hailed by music critics and alternative hip hop fans as a classic hip hop album and has appeared in numerous publications&#x27; &quot;best albums&quot; lists.

Released during the dominant gangsta rap era of West Coast hip hop, &quot;Bizarre Ride&quot; was described as &quot;refreshing&quot; due to its playful, light-hearted humor and lush, jazzy production. Along with albums such as &quot;To Whom It May Concern...&quot; by Freestyle Fellowship, and &quot;I Wish My Brother George Was Here&quot; by Del tha Funkee Homosapien, &quot;Bizarre Ride&quot; helped establish a new alternative scene on the West Coast, followed by artists such as Hieroglyphics, the Coup and Jurassic 5. Despite its wide critical acclaim, the album produced only moderate sales, peaking at No. 75 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart in 1993. However, on the strength of the second single, &quot;Passin&#x27; Me By&quot;, the album was certified gold in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on March 28, 1996.

==Conception==
===Background===
High school friends &quot;Slimkid3&quot; (Tre Hardson), &quot;Imani&quot; (Emandu Wilcox) and &quot;Bootie Brown&quot; (Romye Robinson) began their career in the entertainment industry as dancers and choreographers under the moniker &quot;Two For Two&quot;, making numerous appearances in music videos. Their most notable exposure came with a short stint on the television show &quot;In Living Color&quot;. While working on the show, the group met their future manager Suave, then a road manager for Candyman and Tone Loc. The trio met Derrick &quot;Fatlip&quot; Stewart and producer John &quot;J-Swift&quot; Martinez at an after-school music program called South Central Unit. The program&#x27;s teacher, Reggie Andrews, taught the group about essential elements of the music industry, and later oversaw the group&#x27;s writing and recording sessions. While attending SCU, the group recorded their first demo tape, which included the track &quot;Ya Mama&quot;. In 1991, the group signed a deal with Delicious Vinyl Records, following a performance of the track &quot;Ya Mama&quot; at an artist showcase. Soon after, the group made their first notable appearance, with the track &quot;Soul Flower&quot;, released on the &quot;Heavy Rhyme Experience&quot; album by the Brand New Heavies.

===Recording===
The four emcees, along with producer J-Swift, began recording &quot;Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde&quot; in late 1991. The first sessions were held at Paramount Recording Studios, which the group disliked as they found it too large for their needs. Additionally, they had to leave frequently because renting the studio full-time was too costly. To solve this, Delicious Vinyl&#x27;s founder and the album&#x27;s executive producer Mike Ross rented a smaller studio, Hollywood Sounds, where the group could work on the album without interruptions. J-Swift produced 10 songs and five interludes—15 of the album&#x27;s 16 tracks. Before the completion of the album, Swift had a falling-out with the group over internal problems. He claimed that he was not properly compensated for his work, and that the other group members had tried to take production credit, when he had crafted all the beats himself. Upon leaving, he recommended them a school friend, John &quot;L.A. Jay&quot; Barnes. L.A. Jay helped the group with the production on the final song, &quot;Otha Fish&quot;.

Accounts differ on the duration of the recording process, with Slimkid3 saying it took nine months, while Mike Ross says it was six or seven months. The group left a song off the album called &quot;My Man&quot;, due to it being unfinished and the label deciding to wrap the album because of inner group conflicts. According to Bootie Brown, the group intended to record four or five other songs for the album. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t a complete project&quot;, says the artist.

==Music==
===Lyrical content===
Much of the album&#x27;s acclaim was due to the eccentric, comedic content provided by the four emcees, who were described as a &quot;pack of class clowns set loose in a studio&quot; by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. The album&#x27;s wacky storytelling and light-hearted playfulness provided an alternative to the pessimistic, hardcore hip hop that had ruled the scene at the time. Due to its light lyrical content, the album has been described as an extension of the &quot;Daisy Age&quot;, established by De La Soul and the Native Tongues Posse. AllMusic described the group&#x27;s rapping as &quot;amazing&quot;, and stated, &quot;The L.A.-based quartet introduced listeners to an uproarious vision of earthy hip-hop informed by P-Funk silliness and an everybody-on-the-mic street-corner atmosphere that highlights the incredible rapping skills of each member.&quot; Instead of focusing on the troubles of the inner city, the quartet use their verses to provide humorous first-person narratives, with varying topics. On the album opener &quot;Oh Shit&quot;, SlimKid, Imani and Fatlip trade embarrassing tales about drunken antics, unusual sex partners and transsexuals. SlimKid, Imani and guest rapper Buckwheat use the song &quot;On the DL&quot; to vent personal stories that they&#x27;d like to be kept &quot;on the &quot;, with topics including masturbation and murder. On the single &quot;4 Better or 4 Worse&quot;, Fatlip dedicates an entire verse to prank calling, in which the rapper spouts insane and psychotic threats while a confused female victim continually threatens to call the police. The group&#x27;s debut single &quot;Ya Mama&quot;, described by the &quot;Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; as the album&#x27;s most memorable track, calling it a &quot;marathon game of the dozens&quot;, sees the four rappers trading comical insults towards each other&#x27;s mothers.

While the majority of the album has a focus on comedic stories, the song &quot;Officer&quot; touches on the topic of racial profiling. &quot;Otha Fish&quot; finds the group rising up and moving on from their past hang-ups as described in the previous track, &quot;Passin&#x27; Me By&quot;, the album&#x27;s hit single. On the song, the four recount heartbreaking tales of school-boy crushes that had eluded them.

===Production===
&quot;Bizarre Ride&quot; also featured the acclaimed production work of J-Swift, who provides the album with a lush, jazzy soundscape through use of live instrumentation and sampling. Swift relied on a large number of samples, by artists including James Brown, Donald Byrd, Sly &amp; the Family Stone, the Meters, Quincy Jones, Jimi Hendrix, Roy Ayers and Marvin Gaye. Aside from the samples, Swift also provided piano, bass and rhodes on the album, and fellow producer JMD provided drum arrangements.

==Release==
&quot;Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde&quot; was released on November 24, 1992, through Delicious Vinyl. The album had a moderate commercial success; it debuted at number 175 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, eventually peaking at number 75. It was certified gold by Recording Industry Association of America in 1996, for selling 500,000 copies in the US.

In 2017, to celebrate its 25th anniversary, Craft Recordings re-released &quot;Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde&quot; in multiple formats: vinyl, cassette, a double CD with bonus materials, and a five-disc vinyl set that included the album&#x27;s singles.

===Singles===
&quot;Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde&quot; featured four singles, all of which were accompanied by music videos. The group&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Ya Mama&quot;, originally from their 1991 demo, was released by Delicious Vinyl in June 1992, along with a low-budget music video. Though the song landed the group their record deal, it failed to reach any &quot;Billboard&quot; singles chart. Their first major exposure came with the release of the album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Passin&#x27; Me By&quot;. Utilizing a sample from Quincy Jones&#x27; &quot;Summer in the City&quot;, the song became the group&#x27;s biggest crossover hit, peaking at No. 52 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, and No. 1 on the Hot Rap Singles chart. The song was later featured on the soundtrack to, and in Adam Sandler&#x27;s 1999 film &quot;Big Daddy&quot;. The song is now considered a classic hip hop single. The album&#x27;s third single, &quot;4 Better or 4 Worse&quot;, was released in mid-1993, and featured the stoner song &quot;Pack the Pipe&quot; and the throwback track &quot;Return of the B-Boy&quot; as its B-Side. The single did not reach any &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. The final single, the SlimKid solo track &quot;Otha Fish&quot;, was released in late 1993. The song became the second charting single from the album, though not as highly placed as &quot;Passing Me By&quot;, reaching only the Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales chart. In 2012, all four singles were re-released in a limited edition box set.

A number of tracks from the album were later remixed. &quot;Ya Mama&quot;, &quot;Soul Flower&quot;, &quot;Otha Fish&quot;,and &quot;Passing Me By&quot; all featured a number of remixes, which were later included on the 2005 Pharcyde compilation album &quot;Sold My Soul: The Remix &amp; Rarity Collection&quot;.

==Critical reception==
At the time of its release, &quot;Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde&quot; received mostly positive reviews. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; James Bernard called the album a &quot;freewheeling hip-hop cabaret&quot;, commending it for being humorous. Similarly, a reviewer for &quot;Q&quot; magazine described the album as a combination of De La Soul&#x27;s &quot;daffy [...] invention&quot; and the accessible humor of the Fresh Prince. Dennis Romero of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; also drew comparisons to De La Soul and compared the Pharcyde to the comedian Richard Pryor. &quot;These rappers become instruments as they perform a wide range of styles&quot;, wrote the journalist. Adam Higginbotham of &quot;Select&quot; highlighted the variety of styles employed on the album. Summarizing the album, he wrote: &quot;They are deeply unconventional and stupid in the best possible way&quot;. Describing the Pharcyde as an &quot;unholy amalgam and simultaneous parody of America&#x27;s black entertainers&quot;, David Bennun of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; praised the album. &quot;[T]hey rap like they were a vocal harmony group who learned to talk instead of sing&quot;, he wrote.

&quot;The Source&quot; Brett Johnson saw the Pharcyde as a combination of the &quot;off-beat charm&quot; of De La Soul and the &quot;intense enthusiasm and energy&quot; of Leaders of the New School. He commended the instrumentals, which he described as a blend of &quot;soulful pianos and organs&quot; with &quot;head-nodding basslines&quot;, as well as the group&#x27;s vocal performance, but also thought the group might struggle to gain acceptance among the hardcore hip-hop audience. &quot;The question many will have to answer for themselves is whether a trip to the Pharcyde is a step backwards or a leap into the future?&quot;, concluded the writer. &quot;The Source&quot; later named it one of the best albums of 1993. &quot;NME&quot; thought the Pharcyde created &quot;their own sonic Utopia, a world that&#x27;s by turns riotously funny, twisted, mostly right-on and brooding with noir-ish cool&quot;. The magazine placed &quot;Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde&quot; at number 39 on their 1993 year-end list of best albums, calling it a &quot;cartoon-strip of blunt-smoking antics, sexual innuendo and unashamed political incorrectness, crammed with infectious funky beats&quot;. Charles Aaron, in his review for &quot;Spin&quot;, named &quot;Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde&quot; &quot;one of the most musically vivid hip hop records of the year&quot;, but added that &quot;it&#x27;s hard to hype a group so confused amused about itself&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed the album on their list of the best recordings on 1993, calling it a &quot;fusion of punchy rhythm and loopy rhyme&quot;.

===Retrospective===
In the years since its release, numerous publications have recognized &quot;Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde&quot; as a hip-hop classic. AllMusic&#x27;s John Bush hailed the album for the &quot;amazing rapping and gifted productions&quot;, &quot;easily some of the tightest and most inventive of any hip-hop record of the era&quot;, but thought it might be challenging for new listeners due to a lack of catchy elements. Colin Larkin described it as a &quot;multi-layered comic masterpiece&quot; in &quot;The Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot;. Ross Scarano, in his review for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, called it &quot;one of the most boisterous and creative acts of adolescent knuckleheadedness and confession in hip-hop history&quot;. Comparing it to other contemporaneous West Coast hip-hop albums, he called &quot;Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde&quot; &quot;fearlessly quotidian and relatively low-stakes&quot;, adding that the group used humor to deal with anxiety and pain. &quot;RapReviews&quot; Jordan Selbo thought the group employs &quot;style and a viewpoint deliciously and profoundly contradictory&quot;, &quot;[s]imultaneously subtle and brazen, overtly celebratory yet deeply dark and twisted, both ephemeral and timeless in scope&quot;. He viewed &quot;Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde&quot; as a historic document that captures the experience of Black people in the US. Paul Bowler of &quot;Record Collector&quot; praised the album for its uniqueness, for being &quot;a rare but joyous example of rap without ego&quot;.

Various publications placed &quot;Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde&quot; on their best-of lists. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; added it to the 2020 edition of their The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list. It was featured in the 2005 book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, in which its author Robert Dimery called it &quot;a true classic&quot;, commending the trio for &quot;keep[ing] it original&quot; and J-Swift for bringing &quot;greater depth and a lush, soulful sound&quot;.

===Accolades===


==Legacy==
Released at the time when West Coast was dominated by gangsta rap of N.W.A and G-funk sound of Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg, &quot;Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde&quot; offered an alternative to these styles, while embracing a jazz-influenced style of East Coast groups like A Tribe Called Quest. Despite its moderate commercial success, the album was hailed as a hip-hop classic by both journalists and listeners. Kanye West named &quot;Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde&quot; his favorite album. The album was also a formative influence on the Beta Band, whose Steve Mason also cites it as a favourite.

Influenced by the changes in their lives brought on by their rising popularity, the Pharcyde&#x27;s second album, &quot;Labcabincalifornia&quot; (1995), featured a completely different style. Largely produced by then-unknown J Dilla, it was panned by music critics on release, with some critics feeling that it fell victim to the sophomore jinx. However, over the years, &quot;Labcabincalifornia&quot; received critical acclaim, which the author Andrew Barker linked to the increased popularity of J Dilla.

<doc id="303916" wikidata="Q201201" url="?curid=303916" title="Transfiguration of Jesus">
<text>The Transfiguration of Jesus is an event described in the New Testament where Jesus is transfigured and becomes radiant in glory upon a mountain. The Synoptic Gospels (, , ) recount the occasion, and the Second Epistle of Peter also refers to it. 

In the gospel accounts, Jesus and three of his apostles, Peter, James, and John, go to a mountain (later referred to as the Mount of Transfiguration) to pray. On the mountaintop, Jesus begins to shine with bright rays of light. Then the Old Testament figures Moses and Elijah appear, and he speaks with them. Both figures had eschatological roles: they symbolize the Law and the prophets, respectively. Jesus is then called &quot;Son&quot; by the voice of God the Father, as in the Baptism of Jesus.

Many Christian traditions, including the Eastern Orthodox, Catholic Church, Lutheran and Anglican churches, commemorate the event in the Feast of the Transfiguration, a major festival. In the original Koine Greek, the word μετεμορφώθη (&quot;metemorphōthē&quot;), &quot;he was transformed&quot; is used to describe the event in Luke and Mark. In Greek Orthodoxy, the event is called the &quot;metamorphosis&quot;.

==Significance==
The transfiguration is one of the miracles of Jesus in the Gospels. Thomas Aquinas considers the transfiguration &quot;the greatest miracle&quot;, in that it complemented baptism and showed the perfection of life in Heaven. The transfiguration is one of the five major milestones in the gospel narrative of the life of Jesus, the others being baptism, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. In 2002, Pope John Paul II introduced the Luminous Mysteries in the rosary, which include the transfiguration.

In Christian teachings, the transfiguration is a pivotal moment, and the setting on the mountain is presented as the point where human nature meets God: the meeting place of the temporal and the eternal, with Jesus as the connecting point, acting as the bridge between heaven and earth. Moreover, Christians consider the transfiguration to fulfill an Old Testament messianic prophecy that Elijah would return again after his ascension (Malachi 4:5–6). states: 

== New Testament accounts ==
In the Synoptic Gospels, (, , ), the account of the transfiguration happens towards the middle of the narrative. It is a key episode and almost immediately follows another important element, the Confession of Peter: &quot;you are the Christ&quot; (Matthew 16:16, , ). The transfiguration narrative acts as a further revelation of the identity of Jesus as the Son of God to some of his disciples.

In the gospels, Jesus takes Peter; James, son of Zebedee; and James&#x27; brother John with him and goes up to a mountain, which is not named. Once on the mountain, states that Jesus &quot;was transfigured before them; his face shining as the sun, and his garments became white as the light.&quot; At that point the prophet Elijah (representing the prophets) and Moses (representing the Law) appear and Jesus begins to talk to them. Luke states that they spoke of Jesus&#x27; &quot;exodus&quot; (εξοδον) which he was about to accomplish in Jerusalem (). Luke is also specific in describing Jesus in a state of glory, with Luke 9:32 referring to &quot;they saw His glory&quot;.

Just as Elijah and Moses begin to depart from the scene, Peter begins to ask Jesus if the disciples should make three tents for him and the two prophets. This has been interpreted as Peter&#x27;s attempt to keep the prophets there longer. But before Peter can finish, a bright cloud appears, and a voice from the cloud states: &quot;This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him&quot; (). The disciples then fall to the ground in fear, but Jesus approaches and touches them, telling them not to be afraid. When the disciples look up, they no longer see Elijah or Moses.

When Jesus and the three apostles are walking down the mountain, Jesus tells them to not tell anyone &quot;the things they had seen&quot; until the &quot;Son of Man&quot; has risen from the dead. The apostles are described as questioning among themselves as to what Jesus meant by &quot;risen from the dead&quot;.

In addition to the principal account given in the synoptic gospels; in , the Apostle Peter describes himself as an eyewitness &quot;of his magnificence&quot;. Elsewhere in the New Testament, Paul the Apostle&#x27;s reference in to the &quot;transformation of believers&quot; via &quot;beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord&quot; became the theological basis for considering the transfiguration as the catalyst for processes which lead the faithful to the knowledge of God.

Although Matthew 17 lists the disciple John as being present during the transfiguration, the Gospel of John has no account of it. This has resulted in debate among scholars, some suggesting doubts about the authorship of the Gospel of John, others providing explanations for it. One explanation (that goes back to Eusebius of Caesarea in the 4th century) is that John wrote his gospel not to overlap with the synoptic gospels but to supplement them, and hence he did not include all of their narrative. Others believe that the Gospel of John does in fact allude to the transfiguration, in John 1:14. This is not the only incident not present in the fourth gospel, and the institution of the Eucharist at the Last Supper is another key example, indicating that the author either was not aware of these narrative traditions, did not accept their veracity, or decided to omit them. The general explanation is thus the Gospel of John was written thematically, to suit the author&#x27;s theological purposes and has a less narrative style than the synoptics.

== Theology ==

===Importance===

Christian theology assigns a great deal of significance to the transfiguration, based on multiple elements of the narrative. In Christian teachings, the transfiguration is a pivotal moment, and the setting on the mountain is presented as the point where human nature meets God: the meeting place for the temporal and the eternal, with Jesus as the connecting point, acting as the bridge between heaven and earth.

The transfiguration not only supports the identity of Jesus as the Son of God (as in his baptism), but the statement &quot;listen to him&quot;, identifies him as the messenger and mouth-piece of God. The significance of this identification is enhanced by the presence of Elijah and Moses, for it indicates to the apostles that Jesus is the voice of God &quot;par excellence&quot;, and instead of Moses or Elijah (representing the Law and the prophets) he should be listened to, surpassing the laws of Moses by virtue of his divinity and filial relationship with God. echoes the same message: at the Transfiguration God assigns to Jesus a special &quot;honor and glory&quot; and it is the turning point at which God exalts Jesus above all other powers in creation, and positions him as ruler and judge.

The transfiguration also echoes the teaching by Jesus (as in ) that God is not &quot;the God of the dead, but of the living&quot;. Although Moses had died and Elijah had been taken up to heaven centuries before (as in ), they now live in the presence of the Son of God, implying that the same return to life applies to all who face death and have faith.

=== Historical development ===

The theology of the transfiguration received the attention of the Church Fathers from the earliest times. In the 2nd century, Irenaeus was fascinated by the transfiguration and wrote: &quot;the glory of God is a live human being and a truly human life is the vision of God&quot;. Origen&#x27;s theology of the transfiguration influenced the patristic tradition and became a basis for theological writings by others. Among other issues, given the instruction to the apostles to keep silent about what they had seen until the resurrection, Origen comments that the glorified states of the transfiguration and the resurrection must be related.

The Desert Fathers emphasized the light of the ascetic experience and related it to the light of the transfiguration – a theme developed further by Evagrius Ponticus in the 4th century. Around the same time Gregory of Nyssa and later Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite were developing a &quot;theology of light&quot; which then influenced Byzantine meditative and mystical traditions such as the Tabor light and theoria. The iconography of the transfiguration continued to develop in this time period, and there is a 6th-century symbolic representation in the apse of the Basilica of Sant&#x27;Apollinare in Classe and a well known depiction at Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery on Mount Sinai in Egypt.

Byzantine Fathers often relied on highly visual metaphors in their writings, indicating that they may have been influenced by the established iconography. The extensive writings of Maximus the Confessor may have been shaped by his contemplations on the katholikon at Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery – not a unique case of a theological idea appearing in icons long before it appears in writings.

In the 7th century, Maximus the Confessor said that the senses of the apostles were transfigured to enable them to perceive the true glory of Christ. In the same vein, building on , by the end of the 13th century the concept of &quot;transfiguration of the believer&quot; had stabilized and Gregory Palamas considered &quot;true knowledge of God&quot; to be a &quot;transfiguration of man by the Spirit of God&quot;. The spiritual transfiguration of the believer then continued to remain a theme for achieving a closer union with God.

One of the generalizations of Christian belief has been that the Eastern Church emphasizes the transfiguration while the Western Church focuses on the crucifixion. However, in practice both branches continue to attach significance to both events, although specific nuances continue to persist. An example of such a nuance is the saintly signs of the &quot;Imitation of Christ&quot;. Unlike Catholic saints such as Padre Pio or Francis of Assisi (who considered stigmata a sign of the imitation of Christ) Eastern Orthodox saints have never reported stigmata, but saints such as Seraphim of Sarov and Silouan the Athonite have reported being transfigured by an inward light of grace.

=== Connection to the resurrection ===

Origen&#x27;s initial connection of the transfiguration with the resurrection continued to influence theological thought long thereafter. This connection developed both within the theological and iconographic dimensions – which however, often influenced each other. Between the 6th and 9th centuries the iconography of the transfiguration in the East influenced the iconography of the resurrection, at times depicting various figures standing next to a glorified Christ.

Most commentators in the Middle Ages considered the transfiguration a preview of the glorified body of Christ following his resurrection. As an example, in the 8th century, in his sermon on the transfiguration, the Benedictine monk Ambrosius Autpertus directly links the Supper at Emmaus appearance in to the transfiguration narrative of , and states that in both cases, Jesus &quot;was changed to a different form, not of nature, but of glory.&quot;

The concept of the transfiguration as a preview and an anticipation of the resurrection includes several theological components. On one hand it cautions the disciples, and therefore the reader, that the glory of the transfiguration and the message of Jesus can only be understood in the context of his death and resurrection and not simply on its own. When the transfiguration is considered an anticipation of the resurrection, the presentation of a shining Jesus on the mount of transfiguration as the Son of God who should be listened to can be understood in the context of the statement by Jesus in the resurrection appearance in Matthew 28:16–20: &quot;all authority hath been given unto me in heaven and on earth&quot;.

=== Presence of prophets ===

The presence of the prophets next to Jesus and the perceptions of the disciples have been subject to theological debate. Origen was the first to comment that the presence of Moses and Elijah represented the &quot;Law and the prophets&quot;, referring to the Torah (also called the Pentateuch) and the rest of the Hebrew Bible. Martin Luther continued to see them as the Law and the Prophets respectively, and their recognition of and conversation with Jesus as a symbol of how Jesus fulfills &quot;the law and the prophets&quot; (Matthew 5:17–19, see also Expounding of the Law).

More recently, biblical scholar Caleb Friedeman has argued that the appearance of Moses and Elijah together at the transfiguration was because both of them had witnessed similar theophanies at Mount Sinai. Friedeman asserts that, in light of both Old Testament theophanies, the transfiguration must be considered a theophany in which Jesus manifests his divinity.

The real presence of Moses and Elijah on the mount is rejected by those churches and individuals who believe in &quot;soul sleep&quot; (Christian mortalism) until resurrection. Several commentators have noted that the Gospel of Matthew describes the transfiguration using the Greek word &quot;horama&quot; (), according to Thayer more often used for a supernatural &quot;vision&quot; than for real physical events and conclude that Moses and Elijah were not truly there. In LDS doctrine, Moses and Elijah ministered to Christ as &quot;spirits of just men made perfect&quot; (Doctrine and Covenants 129:1–3; see also Hebrews 12:23).

== Location of the mountain ==

None of the accounts identify the &quot;high mountain&quot; of the scene by name. Since the 3rd century, some Christians have identified Mount Tabor as the site of the transfiguration, including Origen, referencing . Tabor has long been a place of Christian pilgrimage and is the site of the Church of the Transfiguration. In 1868, Henry Alford cast doubt on Tabor due to the possible continuing Roman use of a fortress which Antiochus the Great built on Tabor in 219 BC. Others have countered that even if Tabor was fortified by Antiochus, this does not rule out a transfiguration at the summit. Josephus mentions in the Jewish War that he built a wall along the top perimeter in 40 days, and he does not mention any previously existing structures. John Lightfoot rejects Tabor as too far but &quot;some mountain near Caesarea-Philippi&quot;. The usual candidate, in this case, is Mount Panium, Paneas, or Banias, a small hill situated at the source of the Jordan, near the foot of which Caesarea Philippi was built.

William Hendriksen in his commentary on Matthew (1973) favours Mount Meron. proposes that it was Mount Nebo, primarily on the basis that it was the location where Moses viewed the Promised Land and a parallelism in Jesus&#x27; words on descent from the mountain of transfiguration: &quot;You will say to this mountain (i.e. of transfiguration), &#x27;Move from here to there&#x27; (i.e. the promised land), and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.&quot; notes that Mount Hermon is closest to Caesarea Philippi, mentioned in the previous chapter of Matthew. Likewise, Meyboom (1861) identifies &quot;Djebel-Ejeik&quot;, but this may be a confusion with Jabal el-Sheikh, the Arabic name for Mount Hermon. Edward Greswell, however, writing in 1830, saw &quot;no good reason for questioning the ancient ecclesiastical tradition, which supposes it to have been mount Tabor.&quot; An alternative explanation is to understand the Mount of Transfiguration as symbolic topography in the gospels. As Elizabeth Struthers Malbon notes, the mountain is figuratively the meeting place between God and humans.

== Feast and commemorations ==
Various Christian denominations celebrate the Feast of the Transfiguration. The origins of the feast remain uncertain; it may have derived from the dedication of three basilicas on Mount Tabor. The feast existed in various forms by the 9th century. In the 15th century Pope Callixtus III made it a universal feast celebrated on August 6 to commemorate the lifting of the siege of Belgrade in July 1456.

The Syriac Orthodox, Indian Orthodox and Revised Julian calendars within the Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Old Catholic, and Anglican churches mark the Feast of the Transfiguration on August 6. In those Orthodox churches which continue to follow the Julian Calendar, August 6 in the church calendar falls on August 19 in the civil (Gregorian) calendar. Transfiguration ranks as a major feast, numbered among the Twelve Great Feasts in the Byzantine rite. In all these churches, if the feast falls on a Sunday its liturgy is not combined with the Sunday liturgy, but replaces it.

In some liturgical calendars (e.g. the Lutheran and United Methodist) the last Sunday in the Epiphany season is also devoted to this event. In the Church of Sweden and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, however, the feast is celebrated on the seventh Sunday after Trinity (the eighth Sunday after Pentecost).

In the Roman rite, the gospel pericope of the transfiguration is read on the second Sunday of Lent – the liturgy emphasizes the role the transfiguration had in comforting the Twelve Apostles, giving them both a powerful proof of Christ&#x27;s divinity and a prelude to the glory of the resurrection on Easter and the eventual salvation of his followers in view of the seeming contradiction of his crucifixion and death. The Preface for that day expounds this theme.

== Cultural echoes ==
Several church buildings commemorate the Transfiguration in their naming. Note for example the – the original 17th-century church there gave its name to the surrounding village (Preobrazhenskoye – &quot;Transfiguration [village]&quot; near Moscow) which in turn became the namesake of Russia&#x27;s pre-eminent Preobrazhensky (&quot;Transfiguration&quot;) Regiment and of other associated names.

<doc id="303917" wikidata="Q1036657" url="?curid=303917" title="Hypocrisy Is the Greatest Luxury">
<text>Hypocrisy Is the Greatest Luxury is the debut album by alternative hip hop crew the Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy, released in 1992. &quot;Hypocrisy Is the Greatest Luxury&quot; was met with critical acclaim.

&quot;Television, the Drug of the Nation&quot; was released as a single. It was recorded previously by Michael Franti&#x27;s first band, the Beatnigs.

== Critical reception ==

In a contemporary review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, music critic Robert Christgau said that, although some of the ideas and metaphors are unconvincing, Michael Franti&#x27;s &quot;intellectual grasp thrusts him immediately into pop&#x27;s front rank&quot;. He also praised DJ Rono Tse as &quot;a one-man hip hop band&quot; who, with the help of percussionist Mark Pistel, &quot;creates more music than he samples, stretching Bomb Squad parameters to carry the tracks whenever Franti falters.&quot; &quot;Hypocrisy Is the Greatest Luxury&quot; finished number 19 in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll. Christgau, the poll&#x27;s creator, ranked it number 14 in his own list.

In a retrospective review, AllMusic&#x27;s Ned Raggett said that the group &quot;tackled every last big issue possible with one of 1992&#x27;s most underrated efforts.&quot; He felt that, while its mix of &quot;Bomb Squad and industrial music approaches&quot; make it an appealing album, Franti&#x27;s thematic breadth and &quot;rich voice&quot; are highlights.

<text>José Cardoso (2October 192526October 1998) was a Portuguese author of short stories, novels, plays, and political satire.

==Life and career==

=== Early life ===
Pires was born in the Portuguese village of São João do Peso, which is within the district of Castelo Branco near the border of Spain. His father was in the merchant navy and his mother was a homemaker. Pires studied mathematics at the University of Lisbon, where he published his first short story. He left university to join the Portuguese Navy, from which he was later discharged for disciplinary issues. His writing was greatly influenced by the city of Lisbon, the streets of which are described in great detail in his novels and short stories.

Some of his paternal family members immigrated to the United States. Pires connected to American writing styles at a time when Portugal looked to France (and somewhat to north-eastern Brazilian regionalism) for its narrative models.

In a documentary produced for Portuguese television, Pires spoke about how after he saw his first film as a boy, it led him to seek refuge in cinemas. Pires would recount the plot of the movie to his peers at school. According to Pires, this helped mold his storytelling. He also talked about the formative role of , or film societies. These generally left-leaning associations, in his words, &quot;contributed to the political and social education of many people.&quot;

=== Publishing career ===

After his stint in the Portuguese Navy, Pires began working as a journalist and devoted himself to writing. He developed a reputation as an author who was capable of reconciling popularity with critical acclaim.

One of his most famous works is a novel titled &quot;O Delfim&quot; published in 1968.

In 1991, he was honored with the Latin Union Prize for Literature in recognition of his literary contributions. His 1997 memoir, &quot;De Profundis&quot;, was inspired by the experience of suffering a brain ischemia a couple years prior. In that same year, he won the Prémio Pessoa.

Numerous works have been adapted into films, including &quot;O Delfim&quot;. He was awarded Prémio Bordalo de Literatura da Casa da Imprensa twice and was one of the most influential Portuguese writers of his time.

<text>James Mercer FRS (15 January 1883 – 21 February 1932) was a mathematician, born in Bootle, close to Liverpool, England.

He was educated at University of Manchester, and then University of Cambridge. He became a Fellow, saw active service at the Battle of Jutland in World War I and, after decades of ill health, died in London.

He proved Mercer&#x27;s theorem, which states that positive-definite kernels can be expressed as a dot product in a high-dimensional space. This theorem is the basis of the kernel trick (applied by Aizerman), which allows linear algorithms to be easily converted into non-linear algorithms.

<text>Tove Irma Margit Ditlevsen (; 14 December 1917 – 7 March 1976) was a Danish poet and author. With published works in a variety of genres, she was one of Denmark&#x27;s best-known authors by the time of her death.

== Early life and career ==

Tove Ditlevsen was born in Copenhagen and grew up in the working-class neighbourhood of Vesterbro. Her childhood experiences were the focal points of her work. Ditlevsen was married (and divorced) four times.

In her life, Ditlevsen published 29 books including short stories, novels, poetry, and memoirs. Female identity, memory, and loss of childhood are recurring themes in her work. She began writing poems at the age of ten. Her first volume of poetry was published in her early twenties. In 1947, she experienced popular success with the publication of her poetry collection &quot;Blinkende Lygter&quot; (Flickering Lights). The Danish Broadcasting Corporation commissioned her to write a novel, &quot;Vi har kun hinanden&quot; (We only have each other), which was published in 1954 and broadcast as radio installments. Ditlevsen also authored a column in the weekly &quot;Familie Journalen&quot;, responding to letters from readers.

== &quot;The Copenhagen Trilogy&quot; ==
Three of her books, &quot;Barndom&quot; (Childhood), &quot;Ungdom&quot; (Youth), and &quot;Gift&quot; (meaning both poison and married), form an autobiographical trilogy. The first two books were translated by Tiina Nunnally and published in 1985 by Seal Press under the title &quot;Early Spring.&quot; The complete trilogy, with the third book translated by Michael Favala Goldman, was published in one volume in 2019 (with the titles &quot;Childhood&quot;, &quot;Youth&quot; and &quot;Dependency&quot;) and referred to as &quot;The Copenhagen Trilogy&quot;. 

In 2024, &quot;The New York Times&quot; Book Review named the English translation and collection of the trilogy one of the 100 best books of the 21st century. The list was compiled using a survey of various literary figures chosen by the newspaper and all books were valid as long as they were first published in the United States after January 1, 2000, including translations such as the one by Nunnally and Favala Goldman. 

Throughout her adult life, Ditlevsen struggled with alcohol and drug abuse, and she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital several times, a recurring theme in her later novels. The third volume of her autobiography, &quot;Dependency,&quot; primarily deals with her addiction. British writer Matt Rowland Hill identified &quot;Dependency&quot; as one of the five best addiction memoirs, on par with &quot;Confessions of an English Opium Eater&quot; and poet Mary Karr&#x27;s memoir of alcoholism. In the book, Ditlevsen describes how her dependency on narcotics led her to feign an ear ailment and underwent surgery that made her permanently deaf in one ear.

She died by suicide in 1976 from an overdose of sleeping pills.

== Recognition and legacy ==
Ditlevsen was awarded the Tagea Brandt Rejselegat in 1953 and De Gyldne Laurbær in 1956. In 2014, she was included in the literary canon for Danish primary schools.

Her poem &quot;Blinkende Lygter&quot;, from the poetry collection of the same name, is referred to and namesake for the 2000 Danish film &quot;Flickering Lights&quot;, directed by Anders Thomas Jensen and often named the most popular feature film in its native Denmark in various polls. Her novel &quot;Barndommens gade&quot; was made into a film in mid-1980s and Anne Linnet released an album with poems by Ditlevsen, sung by Linnet. The music from the album was also used in the movie &quot;Barndommens gade&quot;.

<text>Felix Nikolaus Alexander Georg Graf von Luckner (9 June 1881, Dresden – 13 April 1966, Malmö), sometimes called Count Luckner in English, was a German nobleman, naval officer, author, and sailor who earned the epithet &quot;Der Seeteufel&quot; (the Sea Devil), and his crew that of &quot;Die Piraten des Kaisers&quot; (the Emperor&#x27;s Pirates), for his exploits in command of the sailing commerce raider SMS &quot;Seeadler&quot; (&quot;Sea Eagle&quot;) during the First World War. After the war, Luckner became a war hero in Germany and was renowned around the world for his seamanship and chivalrous conduct during the war, which resulted in a minimal loss of life on both sides.

==Early life==
Luckner was born in Dresden, Germany, the great-grandson of Nicolas Luckner, Marshal of France and commander-in-chief of the French Army of the Rhine, who in the 18th century was elevated to the rank of Count (&quot;Graf&quot;) by the King of Denmark.

===First journey===
The young Luckner had dreams of being a sailor, but his father was determined that he should follow the family tradition and go into the cavalry. After failing his exams at various private schools, at the age of thirteen Luckner ran away to sea, with the promise in his mind that he would not return until he was wearing &quot;the Emperor&#x27;s naval uniform, and with honour&quot;. He signed up, under the assumed name of &quot;Phylax Lüdecke&quot;, as an unpaid cabin boy on the Russian sailing ship &quot;Niobe&quot; travelling between Hamburg (Germany) and Australia. His story might have ended there, because the Russian captain, fearing that the lives of other crew members would be endangered, refused to allow a lifeboat to be launched in order to pick Luckner up when he fell overboard in the middle of the ocean. The chief mate defied the captain (who had threatened him with a harpoon), and launched a lifeboat with the help of volunteers. As a number of albatrosses circled over Luckner, one swooped down and seized his outstretched hand in its beak, but Luckner grabbed the bird in desperation. Although severely pecked, he hung on for his life. The flapping of the bird&#x27;s huge wings and the circling of the other albatrosses gave the crew of the lifeboat a point to aim at in his rescue.

===Jack-of-all-trades===
Arriving at Fremantle, Western Australia, Luckner jumped ship and for seven years worked in a bewildering array of occupations: he was a seller of the Salvation Army&#x27;s &quot;The War Cry&quot;; an assistant lighthouse keeper at the Cape Leeuwin Lighthouse in Augusta, Western Australia, a job he abandoned when he was discovered with the lighthouse keeper&#x27;s daughter by her father; a kangaroo hunter; a circus worker; a professional boxer (due to his exceptional strength); a fisherman; a seaman; a guard in the Mexican Army for President Díaz, a railway construction worker, a barman, and a tavern keeper. He was incarcerated for a short time in a Chilean prison accused of stealing pigs, he twice suffered broken legs, and he was thrown out of a hospital in Jamaica for lack of money.

===Back in Germany===
At the age of twenty, Luckner entered a German navigation training school, where he passed the examinations for his mate&#x27;s ticket. By 1908 he had joined the Hamburg-Südamerikanische Line steamer &quot;Petropolis&quot;, intending to serve for nine months before volunteering to serve in the Imperial German Navy for a year, to obtain a naval commission. He had vowed not to return to his family except in uniform and was eventually welcomed back by his family, who had given him up for lost. In February 1912 Luckner was finally called up by the Navy and served on the gunboat .

==First World War==
In the early months of the First World War Felix von Luckner saw action at the Battle of Heligoland Bight (1914). At the Battle of Jutland (1916) he commanded a gun turret on board the battleship .

At the beginning of the War, Germany converted a considerable number of merchant ships into merchant raiders by equipping them with guns and sending them in search of Allied merchant shipping. Most of the armed raiders were not particularly successful, but they did tie up considerable Allied forces in hunting them. By early 1915, most of the armed raiders had either been hunted down and sunk or else had run out of fuel and been interned in neutral ports.

Hoping to revive commerce raiding, the Imperial Navy equipped the impounded three-masted sailing ship &quot;Pass of Balmaha&quot; (1,571 tons) with two 105 mm guns hidden behind hinged gunwales, several machine guns, and two carefully hidden 500 HP auxiliary engines. She was commissioned as the auxiliary cruiser &quot;Seeadler&quot; (&quot;Sea Eagle&quot;). As he was almost the only officer in the German Navy with extensive experience of large sailing ships, Luckner was appointed to command her.

===The Voyage of &quot;Seeadler&quot;===

====Raider====
&quot;Seeadler&quot; left port on 21 December 1916 and managed to slip through the British blockade disguised as a Norwegian ship. Many of the crew of six officers and 57 men, including Luckner himself, had been selected for their ability to speak Norwegian, in case they were intercepted by the British. By Christmas Day, &quot;Seeadler&quot; was southeast of Iceland, where she encountered the British armed merchant cruiser &quot;Avenger&quot;. &quot;Avenger&quot; put an inspection party aboard, but failed to detect the German deception.

On 9 January 1917, &quot;Seeadler&quot; came upon a single-funneled steamer, raised a signal requesting a time signal (not an uncommon thing for a sailing ship long out of contact with land to do), and raised the German ensign too late for the target ship to take any evasive action. Three shots were needed to persuade the 3,268 ton &quot;Gladys Royle&quot;, carrying coal from Cardiff to Buenos Aires, to heave to. Her crew was taken off unharmed, and she was scuttled.

The following day, &quot;Seeadler&quot; encountered another steamship, which refused to identify itself. The German ensign was raised and a shot fired across the bow of the &quot;Lundy Island&quot;, which was carrying sugar from Madagascar. The steamer still refused to heave to, and Luckner fired four rounds directly at her. The steamer then hove to and lowered her boats, but her captain ignored an order to come to &quot;Seeadler&quot;. A German boarding party was sent over and discovered that the crew had abandoned ship when the first shots were fired, leaving the captain alone on board. Captain Bannister later told Luckner that he had previously been captured by a German raider and had given his parole, which he had broken; thus, he was not anxious to be a prisoner of war again. Luckner continued his voyage southwards, and by 21 January he was in mid-Atlantic between Brazil and West Africa when he found the 2,199 ton French three-masted barque &quot;Charles Gounod&quot;, which was loaded with corn. She was quickly dispatched, but her log book recorded information about other ships she had met and their intended route.

On 24 January, the small 364-ton Canadian schooner &quot;Perce&quot; was met and sunk by machine gun fire, after taking off her crew and her captain&#x27;s new bride. The 3,071 ton French four-master &quot;Antonin&quot;, which was loaded with Chilean saltpetre, was overhauled on 3 February and soon scuttled. On 9 February, the 1,811 ton Italian &quot;Buenos Aires&quot;, also carrying saltpetre, was sunk. On 19 February, a four-masted barque was spotted, which immediately piled on sail in an effort to get away; however, &quot;Seeadler&quot; engines allowed her to overhaul the 2,431 ton British steamer &quot;Pinmore&quot;, which was carrying a cargo of grain. By coincidence, Luckner had himself sailed in &quot;Pinmore&quot; in his civilian sailing days, back in 1902. He took &quot;Pinmore&quot; into Rio de Janeiro in order to get more supplies, before eventually scuttling her.

The next ship to be stopped was the Danish barque &quot;Viking&quot;, but as there was nothing unusual about her cargo the neutral ship was allowed to proceed unmolested.

====More victims====
On the morning of 26 February 1917, the 1,953 ton British barque &quot;British Yeoman&quot;, carrying a welcome cargo including chickens and pigs, was stopped and sunk; the same evening the French four-master &quot;Le Rochefoucauld&quot; fell victim to the &quot;Seeadler&quot;. The boarding party discovered &quot;Le Rochefoucauld&quot; had only recently been stopped by a British cruiser which was looking for &quot;Seeadler&quot;.

On the evening of 5 March, &quot;Seeadler&quot; discovered a four-masted barque in the moonlight and signalled &quot;Stop immediately! German Cruiser&quot;. Bizarrely, the captain of the 2,206 ton French ship &quot;Dupleix&quot; rowed across to &quot;Seeadler&quot;, convinced another French captain was playing a practical joke on him. He was soon disabused of the idea when his ship was scuttled. &quot;Seeadler&quot; next victim on 10 March was asked for the time, but ignored the signal. Luckner ordered a smoke generator to be lit, and the 3,609 ton &quot;Horngarth&quot; turned back to render assistance to the &#x27;burning&#x27; sailing ship. A single shot put the British ship&#x27;s radio out of action; this resulted in the only loss of life in the &quot;Seeadler&quot; voyage. A British sailor, Douglas Page, was killed when a steam pipe was ruptured by the shot. &quot;Horngarth&quot; was soon scuttled by &quot;Seeadler&quot; now experienced crew.

By this time, Luckner had the problem of feeding and keeping safe nearly 300 prisoners, in addition to his own crew. Consequently, when on 20 March, the French four-masted barque &quot;Cambronne&quot; was captured, Luckner arranged for the ship&#x27;s topgallant mast and additional spars and sails to be removed, before putting his prisoners aboard &quot;Cambronne&quot; under the command of Captain Mullen of &quot;Pinmore&quot;. The much-reduced rigging on &quot;Cambronne&quot; ensured &quot;Seeadler&quot; would be able to escape before her location could be reported to the hunting ships.

The Royal Navy was well aware of &quot;Seeadler&quot; general location and set a trap consisting of the armed merchant cruisers &quot;Otranto&quot; and &quot;Orbita&quot; and the armoured cruiser HMS &quot;Lancaster&quot; at Cape Horn. However, a severe storm blew &quot;Seeadler&quot; considerably further south, before she entered the Pacific Ocean on 18 April and sailed north along the Chilean coast. By early June, &quot;Seeadler&quot; was east of Christmas Island and learned that the United States had entered the war. &quot;Seeadler&quot; therefore turned her attention to American shipping, sinking the 529-ton &quot;A. B. Johnson&quot; of San Francisco on 14 June, the 673 ton &quot;R. C. Slade&quot; the next day, and the schooner &quot;Manila&quot; on 8 July. By this time, &quot;Seeadler&quot; needed to be laid up so that her hull could be scraped clean. She put into the small island of Mopelia, also known as Maupihaa, a coral atoll some in diameter in the Society Islands, some from Tahiti.

====Wrecking and stranding====
&quot;Seeadler&quot; was too large to enter the sheltered lagoon of Mopelia, and consequently had to anchor outside the reef. On 2 August, disaster struck. According to Luckner, the ship was struck by a tsunami which wrecked her on the reef. However, some American prisoners alleged that the ship drifted aground while the prisoners and most of the crew were having a picnic on the island.

The crew and their 46 prisoners were now stranded on Mopelia, but they managed to salvage provisions, firearms, and two of the ship&#x27;s boats.

===Hide and seek===
Luckner decided to sail with five of his men in one of the long open boats, rigged as a sloop and named &quot;Kronprinzessin Cecilie&quot;. Ever the optimist, he intended to sail to Fiji by way of the Cook Islands, capture a sailing ship, return to Mopelia for his crew and prisoners, and resume his raiding career.

Three days after leaving Mopelia, the seamen reached Atiu Island, where they pretended to be Dutch-American mariners crossing the Pacific for a bet. The New Zealand Resident, the administrator of the island, gave them enough supplies to reach another island in the group, Aitutaki, where they posed as Norwegians. The New Zealand Resident in Aitutaki was suspicious but had no means of detaining the group, and Luckner quickly took his party to the island of Rarotonga. Approaching Rarotonga in the dark, Luckner saw a dark ship which he thought was an auxiliary cruiser, but in fact it was a beached ship.

Luckner pressed on to the Fijian Wakaya Island, arriving after a voyage of in an open boat. Most people on Wakaya accepted the Germans&#x27; story of being shipwrecked Norwegians, but one sceptic called a party of police from the old Fijian capital of Levuka. On 21 September, the police threatened that a non-existent gun on the inter-island ferry &quot;Amra&quot; would blow Luckner out of the water. Not wishing to cause bloodshed, and not realizing the police were unarmed, Luckner and his party surrendered and were confined in a prisoner-of-war camp on Motuihe Island, off Auckland, New Zealand.

Meanwhile, back on Mopelia, a small French trading ship, the &quot;Lutèce&quot;, anchored outside the reef. Leutnant Kling of &quot;Seeadler&quot;, having heard on the radio of his captain&#x27;s capture, sailed out to &quot;Lutèce&quot; and captured her at gunpoint. The French crew was put ashore with the other prisoners, and all the Germans embarked on the ship, which they renamed the &quot;Fortuna&quot;, and set course for South America. The master of &quot;A. B. Johnson&quot;, Captain Smith, then took the remaining open boat from Mopelia with three other American seamen, and sailed to Pago Pago, arriving on 4 October, where they were finally able to inform the authorities of the activities of &quot;Seeadler&quot; and arrange for the rescue of the other 44 sailors left stranded on Mopelia.

&quot;Fortuna&quot;, meanwhile, came to grief when she struck uncharted rocks off Easter Island. The crew scrambled ashore, where they were interned by the Chileans for the remainder of the war.

===Escape===
Luckner still refused to accept that the war was over for him. The commander of the prisoner of war camp at Motuihe had a fast motor boat, the &quot;Pearl&quot;, at his disposal, and on 13 December 1917, Luckner faked setting up a play for Christmas with his men and used his provisions for the play to plan his escape. He and other prisoners seized the &quot;Pearl&quot; and made for the Coromandel Peninsula. Using a machine gun, Luckner then seized the 90-ton scow &quot;Moa&quot; and, with the help of a handmade sextant and a map copied from a school atlas, he sailed for the Kermadec Islands, which contained a castaway depot on Curtis Island. A pursuing auxiliary ship, the &quot;Iris&quot;, had guessed Luckner&#x27;s probable destination and caught up with him on 21 December. A year after his mission began, the war finally ended for Felix von Luckner. He spent the remainder of the war in various prisoner of war camps in New Zealand, including Ripapa Island in Lyttelton Harbour, before being repatriated to Germany in 1919.

==Personal life==

Luckner was married twice. He married Petra Schultz from Hamburg, with whom he had a daughter, Inge-Maria, born in 1913. They were divorced in 1914. On 24 September 1924 he married Ingeborg Engeström in Malmö, Sweden.

==Postwar life==

On 12 May 1921, Luckner joined Regular Freemasonry of the Lodge &quot;Zur goldenen Kugel&quot; (&quot;Große Landesloge von Deutschland&quot;) in Hamburg. He wrote a book about his wartime adventures which became a bestseller in Germany, and a book about him by Lowell Thomas spread his fame throughout the Anglosphere.

In 1926 Luckner raised funds to buy a sailing ship which he called the &quot;Vaterland&quot; and he set out on a goodwill mission around the world, leaving Bremen on 19 September and arriving in New York Harbor on 22 October 1926. An entertaining speaker, he was widely admired for his seamanship and for having fought his war at sea with such a minimal loss of life. This opened many doors for him in the United States, where he spoke on hundreds of occasions across the country, both in German and later, increasingly, in English. He won the support of many notable people, including diplomats, politicians, and even World War I veterans belonging to the American Legion. Henry Ford presented Luckner with a motor car, and the city of San Francisco made him an honorary citizen. US President Calvin Coolidge wanted to meet him, but Luckner politely declined at the request of Foreign Office of the Weimar Republic. Feeling that his &quot;goodwill mission&quot;, as he called it in his travelogue, &quot;Seeteufel erobert Amerika&quot; (&quot;Sea-devil conquers America&quot;), could neither have greater success elsewhere, nor could he be financially sustained by the income as a speaker, however popular and successful; he returned to Germany, where he arrived on 19 April 1928.

Count von Luckner was a family friend and frequent visitor to the Heydrich family, who belonged to the Catholic minority in Halle. At their household, Count Luckner&#x27;s stories about the cruise of &quot;SMS Seeadler&quot; inspired one of their sons, a young Reinhard Heydrich, to enlist as an officer cadet in the inter-war &quot;Reichsmarine&quot; of the Weimar Republic, from which he was dishonourably discharged for &quot;conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman&quot; in 1931. In 1937 and 1938, Luckner and his wife undertook a round-the-world voyage in his yacht &quot;Seeteufel&quot;, and they were welcomed in New Zealand and Australia, although some viewed him as an apologist for the Nazi regime and for this reason, Luckner became a target for anti-German propaganda by the Australian press.

For example, Count von Luckner had great physical strength and was noted for his ability to bend coins between the thumb, index, and middle finger of his right hand and to tear up telephone directories (the thickest being that of New York City), with his bare hands. For this reason, on the occasion of his visit to Australia in 1938, the Sydney &quot;Labor Daily&quot; published a cartoon showing Kaiser Wilhelm tearing up the Belgian Neutrality Pact, Adolf Hitler tearing up another agreement, and Luckner tearing up a telephone directory, with the caption &quot;They All Have the Habit&quot;.

During their visit to Queensland, Australia, the Luckners were feted by the press and public. The Brisbane office of the Commonwealth Investigation Branch (CIB), maintained a surveillance of the Luckners during their visit, with the inspector in charge of the CIB in Brisbane, Bob Wake, attending a gala function arranged by the German Foreign Office in honour of the couple. The gala menu was decorated with a swastika. The CIB kept detailed records of all of their contacts, and when Australia declared war on Germany many of these contacts were arrested and interned.

During the Second World War, Adolf Hitler tried to exploit Luckner for propaganda purposes, although as a Freemason Luckner was not in one of the Nazis&#x27; favoured groups of people. Luckner refused to renounce his membership in &quot;the Craft&quot; or the various honorary citizenships granted in the US, and consequently he suffered by having his bank accounts frozen. In 1943, Count von Luckner saved the life of a German Jewish woman, Rose Janson, whom he provided with a passport he found on a bombsite, and which allowed her to subsequently escape to the United States via a neutral country. Towards the end of the war in April, Count von Luckner was living in Halle, where he was briefly placed under guard by the 414th Infantry Regiment of the United States Army, which was engaged in house-to-house fighting against Wehrmact and Waffen-SS troops within the town after the garrison refused to surrender. Count Luckner did not return to the town after hearing that local Nazis planned to subject him to execution without trial.

Luckner was a prolific autograph signer, and his original autographs turn up frequently at auctions and estate sales.

After the Second World War, Luckner moved to Sweden, where he lived in Malmö with his Swedish second wife Ingeborg Engeström until his death in Malmö at the age of 84 in 1966. However, his body was returned to Germany and was buried in the Main Cemetery Ohlsdorf, Hamburg.

== Writing ==
Luckner wrote the introduction for Alfred von Niezychowski&#x27;s book &quot;The Cruise of the Kronprinz Wilhelm&quot;, 1928, published by Doubleday &amp; Company, about his time on the auxiliary cruiser &quot;Kronprinz Wilhelm&quot;.

== TV series ==
Between 1973 and 1975, a Franco-German Co-production company produced a 39-episode adventure series entitled &quot;Graf Luckner&quot; for the German ARD television network, featuring Luckner as the hero. The French sub-title was &quot;Les Aventures du Capitaine Luckner&quot;.

Episode 26 of the television series &quot;Tales from Te Papa&quot; featured the sextant used by Luckner in his attempt to escape from captivity in New Zealand.

== The Count Felix von Luckner Society ==
On 29 March 2004 the society &quot;Felix Graf von Luckner Gesellschaft&quot; was founded in Halle, with the objective of commemorating Luckner&#x27;s life and work, especially his role in safeguarding the city of Halle in April 1945. The society also wishes to create a memorial and museum for Luckner in Halle and to restore his yacht &quot;Seeteufel&quot;, which is currently in poor condition and lying in Russia. Within a few months of its creation, the society had over 100 members in 14 countries.

<doc id="303928" wikidata="Q469639" url="?curid=303928" title="Escape from the Planet of the Apes">
<text>Escape from the Planet of the Apes is a 1971 American science fiction film directed by Don Taylor and written by Paul Dehn. The film is the sequel to &quot;Beneath the Planet of the Apes&quot; (1970) and the third installment in the original &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; film series. It stars Roddy McDowall, Kim Hunter, Bradford Dillman, Natalie Trundy, Eric Braeden, Sal Mineo, and Ricardo Montalbán. In the film, Cornelius (McDowall) and Zira (Hunter) flee back through time to 20th-century Los Angeles, where they face fear and persecution.

&quot;Escape from the Planet of the Apes&quot; was released in the United States on May 26, 1971, by 20th Century-Fox. The film received a mainly positive response from critics and is generally considered the best sequel of the original Apes series. &quot;Escape&quot; was followed by &quot;Conquest of the Planet of the Apes&quot; in 1972.

==Plot==
Prior to Earth&#x27;s destruction, the chimpanzees Cornelius, Zira and Dr. Milo salvage and repair Taylor&#x27;s spaceship and escape the planet. The shock wave of Earth&#x27;s destruction sends the ship through a time warp that brings the apes to 1973 Earth. Most specifically, the Pacific coast of the United States.

The apes are transported to the Los Angeles Zoo, under the observation of two friendly scientists, Dr. Stephanie Branton and Dr. Lewis Dixon. During their stay there, Dr. Milo is killed by a zoo gorilla.

A Presidential Commission is formed to investigate the return of Taylor&#x27;s spaceship and its inhabitants. During their interrogation, Cornelius and Zira deny knowing Taylor. They reveal, however, that they came from the future and escaped Earth when a war broke out. They are welcomed as guests of the government. The apes secretly explain to Stephanie and Lewis how humans are treated in the future, and tell them about Earth&#x27;s destruction. The scientists are shocked but still sympathetic, and advise the couple to keep this information secret until they can gauge the potential reaction of their hosts.

Lavished with gifts and media attention, the apes become celebrities. They come to the attention of the President&#x27;s Science Advisor Dr. Otto Hasslein, who discovers Zira is pregnant. Fearing for the future of the human race, Hasslein insists that he simply wants to know how apes became dominant over men. Cornelius reveals that the human race will cause its own downfall and that Earth&#x27;s destruction is caused by a weapon made by humans. Zira explains that the gorillas started the war, but the chimpanzees had nothing to do with it. Hasslein suspects that the apes are not telling the whole truth.

During the original hearing, Zira accidentally reveals that she used to dissect humans. Hasslein orders Lewis to administer a truth serum to her while Cornelius is confined elsewhere. As a result of the serum, Hasslein learns details about Zira&#x27;s experimentation on humans along with her knowledge of Taylor.

Zira joins Cornelius in confinement while Hasslein takes his findings to the President, who reluctantly abides by the council&#x27;s ruling to have her pregnancy be terminated and that both apes be sterilized. In their chambers, Zira and Cornelius fear for their lives. When an orderly arrives to offer the apes food, his jokes about their future child make Cornelius lose his temper. He knocks the orderly to the floor, before escaping with Zira. They assume the orderly is merely knocked out, but he is actually dead. Hasslein uses the tragedy in support of his claim that the apes are a threat. He calls for their execution, but is ordered by the President to bring them in alive, unwilling to endorse capital punishment until due process has been served.

Branton and Dixon help the apes escape, taking them to a circus run by Señor Armando, where an ape named Heloise has just given birth. Zira gives birth to a son and names him Milo, in honor of their deceased friend. Knowing that Zira&#x27;s labor was imminent, Hasslein orders a search of all circuses and zoos, and Armando insists the apes leave for their safety. Lewis arranges for the apes to hide out in the Los Angeles harbor&#x27;s shipyard for a while. He gives Cornelius a pistol as the couple does not want to be taken alive.

Tracking the apes to the shipping yard, Hasslein mortally wounds Zira and kills the infant she is holding. Cornelius shoots down Hasslein, and then dies at the hands of a sniper. Zira tosses the dead baby over the side and crawls to die with her husband, witnessed by a grieving Lewis and Stephanie.

It is revealed that Zira switched babies with Heloise before leaving the circus. Armando is aware of this and prepares to leave for Florida. Baby Milo then begins to talk.

==Cast==
In this film, actor Roddy McDowall returns to the character of Cornelius which he played in the first film but not in the second. A new ape character of Dr. Milo is introduced played by actor Sal Mineo. Charlton Heston, star of the first film and supporting actor in the second, appears in this third installment only in two brief flashback sequences.

==Production==
Despite &quot;Beneath the Planet of the Apes&quot; ending in a way that seemed to prevent the series from continuing, 20th Century-Fox still wanted a sequel. Roddy McDowall, in the franchise documentary &quot;Behind the Planet of the Apes&quot;, stated that Arthur P. Jacobs sent &quot;Beneath&quot; screenwriter Paul Dehn a telegram concerning the sequel that read &quot;Apes exist, Sequel required.&quot; and Dehn decided to create an out from the destructive ending of &quot;Beneath&quot; by having Cornelius and Zira going back in time with a Leonardo da Vinci–like ape after fixing Taylor&#x27;s spaceship before the Earth was destroyed. Dehn also consulted Pierre Boulle, writer of the &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; novel, to imbue his script with similar satirical elements. The screenplay, originally titled &quot;Secret of the Planet of the Apes&quot;, accommodated the smaller budget by having fewer people in ape make-up, and attracted director Don Taylor by its humor and focus on the chimpanzee couple.

Dehn also added to the latter part of the film regarding the chase for Cornelius, Zira and their son references to racial conflicts and a few religious overtones to the story of Jesus – a line of dialogue even has the President comparing the plan to kill an unborn child to the Massacre of the Innocents. While Kim Hunter had to be convinced by the studio to make &quot;Beneath&quot;, she liked the script for &quot;Escape from the Planet of the Apes&quot; and accepted the job, though Hunter also stated that &quot;I was very glad I was killed off&quot; and Zira was not required anymore after that film. Hunter stated that despite the friendly atmosphere on the set, she and Roddy McDowall felt a sense of isolation for being the only people dressed as chimpanzees. Production was rushed due to the low budget, being filmed in only six weeks, from November 30, 1970 to January 19, 1971.

The film holds a 77% score on Rotten Tomatoes based on 30 reviews. The critical consensus reads: &quot;One of the better &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; sequels, &quot;Escape&quot; is more character-driven than the previous films, and more touching as a result.&quot;

Roger Greenspun of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was positive, finding the premise &quot;quite beautiful&quot; with the theme of human guilt &quot;richly ambivalent, because the monsters are scarcely monstrous and the guilt is a function of unassailable strategic intelligence.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film three stars out of four and wrote, &quot;Comparatively, it is much better than the second, which was awful, but not as good as the first, which was quite good.&quot; Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;an excellent film. Far better than last year&#x27;s followup and almost as good as the original &#x27;Planet of the Apes.&#x27;&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the film &quot;works largely because Miss Hunter and McDowall, working under Don Taylor&#x27;s deft direction, are such gifted actors and because John Chambers&#x27; chimpanzee makeup is so convincing, as it was in the other pictures.&quot; David Pirie of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote, &quot;Infuriatingly, &quot;Escape from the Planet of the Apes&quot; continues the downward trend of a science-fiction series that started out with much ingenuity and promise ... the film is painfully sentimental in its attitude to the chimps, with Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall overplaying and vulgarising their former roles to the point where it&#x27;s hard to feel much concern about their final destruction.&quot;

==Spin-off media==
A comic book miniseries, a crossover with &quot;Star Trek&quot; serving to bridge the events of the second and third films and titled &quot;Star Trek/Planet of the Apes: The Primate Directive&quot;, was published from December 2014 to April 2015.
